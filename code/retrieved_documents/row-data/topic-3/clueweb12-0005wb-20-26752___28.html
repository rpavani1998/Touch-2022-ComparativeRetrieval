<p>Heh, cheesy headline, but they all seam together on this week's episode of

via his Bourne Media Group online presence and a bazillion other places like 
Photoshop World, Aperture Nature Photography Workshops, Bosque Del Apache, and 
much much more.&nbsp; I could link to it all but that would take an entire post 
of it's own, so will point you to his main presence at Photofocus and Twitter:
</p> 
<p>We had a great talk on this week's show, covering his photo background from 
Motocross to Wedding work, and of course his Avian work as well.&nbsp; We took 
a look at a little of the gear side, got some nuggets on branding and the 
business side, and even had a chance for a couple twitter questions.&nbsp; 
Great stuff and all packed into a mere 30 minute interview!&nbsp; Thanks again 
to Scott for taking the time to talk to me on the podcast!</p>

consider on matting and framing (hence mats in the title), and an in-depth look

LDP contests, so some teaser stuff there too.&nbsp; All in all, a great (but

for consideration too.&nbsp; Feel free, as always to share your thoughts, 
comments, and feedback either here at the PLM site with Diggs, on iTunes via 
the review option, on Twitter, in the blog comments, or with me directly via 
email.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thanks for tuning in, and we'll see you next time! </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 22: <strong>Your Questions, Adobe's Answers</strong></h5> 
<p>On this week's show, we take some listener questions, provide a little 
background and insight in some answers, the segue into our second half - an 
interview with none other than Tom, Hogarty, Senior Product Manager for Adobe 
Lightroom.&nbsp; It's a great segment, where we talk about the design of 
Lightroom, how it fits into the photographer's work flow, and where development 
of the industry as a whole is likely to head.&nbsp; And to top things off, a 
contest, with - you guessed it - a copy of Photoshop Lightroom 2 going to the 
lucky winner.&nbsp; More detailed notes available on the blog.</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 21: <strong>Portraits, Promotion, and Planning</strong></h5> 
<p>This week&rsquo;s podcast episode should be available shortly over at 
Personal Life Media. &nbsp; You&rsquo;ll want to listen when you really can 
dedicate the 25 minutes as it&rsquo;s a pretty rapid fire show this week.&nbsp; 
A couple learning opportunities presented themselves to me recently and I 
wanted to share these before they got too fuzzy.&nbsp; As a result, I 
didn&rsquo;t really get into the news of the last week, or address any listener 
questions.&nbsp; However, there are still some show notes and a sample portrait 
over at the blog, so be sure to stop there and pick up the feed.&nbsp; Diggs, 
reviews, and such (as always) are appreciated and encouraged!</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 20: <strong>The Power of the Pen</strong></h5> 
<p>On this weeks show, I take a look at the power of the pen - the artist 
statement.&nbsp; For those of us with aspirations of sharing our work with 
others via art shows, galleries, contests and competitions, the value of the 
artist statement can make the difference between getting into a show, gallery 
or other event and buying a ticket.&nbsp; So, if you want to learn what the 
artist statement is, how to write one, and things to consider, this is the show 
for you.</p> 
<p>Stop over at the blog for the rest of the show notes, and don't forget to 
Digg above here at PLM, and review the show on iTunes if you like it!&nbsp; 
Thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next week!</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 19: <strong>Blur Baby, Blur!</strong></h5> 
<p>Hey all, this week&rsquo;s show is done and boy are you in for a 
treat!&nbsp; Not only is there some pretty ground-breaking news from the 
computing world, but the theme for this podcast is blur!&nbsp; I take a 
(hopefully) clear look at different types of blur you can get in your images, 
what can work, what will not work, and how to correct for different 
types.&nbsp; Got some great listener questions and answers that tie in very 
nicely to the theme, and as, always the photo tip of the week.&nbsp; 
Here&rsquo;s a few of the show notes:</p> 
<p>News Links - HP z800 Specs - (listen to the show to find out why this is so 
amazing it&rsquo;s the only news story!)</p> 
<p>Focal Length/Crop Factor/Shutter Speed settings - check the blog for details
</p> 
<p>Listener Questions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>DOF Preview button</li> 
<li>Battery Length</li> 
<li>Portrait Lenses</li> </ul> 
<p>Be sure when you stop over to the good folks at PLM to get the podcast, to 
check out the Lensbaby Composer - a great resource for managing blur in your 
photos!&nbsp; Happy shooting all and don't forget to stop by the blog for the 
show notes.</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 18: <strong>How do you like to sound?</strong></h5> 
<p>In preparation for the next podcast, due in no small part to a technical 
difficulty with Garage Band, I&rsquo;ve set up a dedicated computer and 
recording space (call it my dedicated recording studio) and the audio quality 
is off the charts better than anything I&rsquo;ve done before.&nbsp; 
Ironically, the new topic for this weeks podcast is also about sound - the 
sound of shutters and how they can impact the feel of the camera, and how they 
can effect a moment is significant enough to warrant consideration.&nbsp; Make 
sure you tune in for this one from the good folks over at Personal Life Media 
to get all the news, info, and latest from Learning Digital Photography!</p> 
<p>Listen in to the podcast right here at Personal Life for the answers and 
full details on all the show segments.&nbsp; In the meantime, what does your 
shutter sound like?&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a Canon 
camera, listen to your camera whether it&rsquo;s Canon Nikon, Olympus, Sony, 
Pentax, Panasonic, Leica, Hasselblad, etc! Find out why in the podcast up now 
over at Personal Life Media&nbsp; The rest of the show notes, including 
additional links referenced in the show are over at the blog.</p> 
<p>Remember to Digg the podcast page too - more listeners means more questions 
and answers, and more fodder for podcasts!</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 17: <strong>News, Artists, and Inspiration</strong></h5> 
<p>Welcome to the show notes for week #17 of Learning Digital 
Photography.&nbsp; Here's the show notes for this week's podcast...</p> 
<p>First off, I've done some further tweaking to give a little more 
consistency and structure to the show for your listening pleasure.&nbsp; The 
three segments that I am going to try to regularly stick to will be:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>News, Events, and Information</strong> from around the community 
and industry - here I'll share nuggets, information, and other useful snippets 
from the most recent days and weeks of activity within the photography 
community.&nbsp; Sometimes I'll share information that's available elsewhere, 
and other times I'll offer my own perspectives on the news and events that 
shape the industry.</li> 
<li><strong>Authors and Artists</strong> from within and related to the 
industry of photography are also an area I would like to devote some time to 
since the Thursday Thoughts series has not seen much attention lately (not that 
I am planning to either - I think it's just on sabbatical!), and I had the good 
fortune of actually sitting down with an area professional recently which 
provided a source of inspiration for this weeks show.</li> 
<li><strong>Sources of Inspiration</strong> - As artists I think we are always 
searching for and discovering new sources of inspiration.&nbsp; Often these can 
come from well known venues such as photography magazines, galleries, and the 
like, but I am not adverse to featuring unusual or new sources either.&nbsp; 
This week, I will be featuring an unusual source of inspiration, so make sure 
you stop in for this segment too!</li> </ol> 
<p>Head on over to the blog for the remainder of the show notes and links!</p> 
more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 16: <strong>HDR, Web Links, and some news</strong></h5> 
<p>So, this last weekend I went on the photo meetup group outing for the month 
of February into Eldorado State Park, south of Boulder, and had many an 
opportunity to capture some landscape and macro work.&nbsp; Some great views 
were had and I only hope that they all come out as well as this one did.&nbsp; 
While hiking up a trail of slippery snow and ice (it was cold out Saturday 
morning), I saw this fissure that was pretty intense looking because it was 
only partially lit.&nbsp; I thought about it for a second and decided to 
bracket some exposures to see if it would turn out with some HDR 
massaging.&nbsp; Not only did it turn out better than I would have thought, I 
was also very pleased with how Photomatix did with this.&nbsp; I would highly 
recommend this software to anyone interested in HDR work.&nbsp; Not only is it 
more intuitive than Photoshop, the results were much more gratifying!&nbsp; You 
can buy Photomatix for PS, Lightroom and for either Windows or a Mac over at 
http://www.hdrsoft.com</p> 
<p>Some other web links I learned about recently also include fotoblur.com and 
usefilim.com&nbsp; Both are much more cognizant and respective of photography 
copyright than other social and photo networking sites like Flickr and Facebook 
(we all know about the Facebook Terms of Service fiasco, right?).&nbsp; One 
thing I like about both Fotoblur and Flickr is that you are limited in how many 
images you can upload daily.&nbsp; This requires you to be more careful about 
what you publish, and as a result, you are more thoughtful and objective of 
what work is worth posting and sharing online.</p> 
<p>Last but not least, the podcast that I had intended to put out last week 
was delayed for a few days as I put the finishing touches up on a home 
improvement project.&nbsp; (We finished out one of the basement rooms - expect 
to see some photos on that makeover forthcoming!)&nbsp; The good news is that 
not only is the basement room on the verge of completion, but that the podcast 
is up for this week.&nbsp; Naturally, the title of the podcast will match the 
blog post title, as the show notes follow closely to todays content.&nbsp; Stop 
on over to Personal Life Media for the show, or pick it up in iTunes!&nbsp; 
(Don&rsquo;t forget to leave your thoughts in the review section of iTunes 
too&hellip;the more the merrier!)</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 15: <strong>Multimedia Monday</strong></h5> 
<p>With the &ldquo;New and Improved&rdquo; podcast starting out at PLM this 
week, there&rsquo;s a couple exciting things to announce.&nbsp; First off, the 
drawing for the Think Tank Photo Streetwalker bag was done live on the podcast 
this week, and the winner was announced in the lead segment.&nbsp; Congrats go 
out to the winner (you know who you are!), so do get me your address so I can 
ship you the bag post haste!</p> 
<p>The meat segment (aka middle segment) I talk about some new sources of 
inspiration - specifically the grocery store and in a restaurant.&nbsp; The 
next time you are at a restaurant, take your camera because the table makes for 
a great tripod, and you can get some really cool shots.&nbsp; Case in point, is 
the new gallery I have set up here at the blog, titled Tabletop 
Photography.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m also sharing a few sources of inspiration from the 
grocery store too (tune in tomorrow for those).</p> 
<p>The listener questions were really good ones from Meredith and Jason, where 
I take a look at the value of carbon fiber and the issue of when and where are 
we permitted to photograph.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least, the photo tip of 
the week concerns copyright and registering your work, so make sure you stay 
tuned for that.</p> 
<p>Lots of photo goodness to share, so make sure you tune in for the audio, 
and stop by the blog to pick up the link for the photo gallery.&nbsp; Photos, 
podcasts, and questions galore.&nbsp; Enjoy the day and we&rsquo;ll see you 
back here tomorrow!&nbsp; Happy Shooting!</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 13: <strong>The Meat is in the Maintenance</strong></h5> 
<p>With another week come to a close, I got a late start in recording and 
putting together the podcast for today, so it&rsquo;s going up a tad 
late.&nbsp; However, as the old saying goes, good things come to those who 
wait.&nbsp; Here's the show notes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Photo News</li> 
<li>Maintenance Schedules</li> 
<li>Think Tank Contest almost Over</li> 
<li>Listener Questions &amp; Photo Tip of the Week</li> </ul>Happy shooting 
and we'll see you back here tomorrow.<br>
more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 12: <strong>The Show Must Go On...</strong></h5> 
<p>While the folks at Personal Life Media continue to work behind the scenes 
at getting the show re-branded, I&rsquo;ve been encouraged to keep producing 
podcasts so, this week, the podcast returns.&nbsp; Here's the show notes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Boneyard Backstory </li> 
<li>Think Tank Photo Streetwalker Review</li> 
<li>Blog/Podcast Maintenance</li> 
<li>Listener Questions and Answers</li> 
<li>Photo Tip of the Week</li> </ul> 
<p>As you may have noticed if you&rsquo;re picking up the feed, I am also 
uploading all the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s This&rdquo; images to the Canon Blogger 
Flickr Pool.&nbsp; As that content arc has ended, I thought it might be fun and 
of interest to see the entire gallery of photos that have gone up on that 
subject over a period of roughly 23 weeks.&nbsp; (Almost half a year of images 
there to rack your brain on!)</p> 
<p>As we head into the weekend, be sure to take your camera with you - never 
know when a photo opportunity will present itself, so as the Boy Scouts always 
said:&nbsp; &ldquo;Be Prepared!&rdquo;&nbsp; Happy shooting and we&rsquo;ll see 
you back here Monday morning!</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 11: <strong>The Final Broadcast of 2008</strong></h5> 
<p>That&rsquo;s right, this week is the final podcast broadcast for CB this 
year!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good one though with an announcement of the new 
product line I&rsquo;ll be reviewing.&nbsp; For those of you getting this in 
feed readers, here&rsquo;s the short version:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Christmas Wrap-up:&nbsp; A few last minute gift ideas for the photog-type 
in your circle</li> 
<li>The New Product Line Review Announcement (you gotta listen to find out!  )
</li> 
<li>The Value of Starting Over</li> 
<li>Listener Questions and Answers</li> </ol> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Dave from PA - Hot shoe flashes:&nbsp; tungsten or flourescent?</li> 
<li>Lynn from WI - Are 3rd party batteries safe?</li> 
<li>Kevin from CO - Best way to learn photography</li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>Tomorrow, the last What&rsquo;s This of the Year, and then lights 
out&hellip;nothing again until next week. The next edition of Thursday Thoughts 
will come back the second week of January (I couldn&rsquo;t find it in myself 
to ask someone to put something together for New Years Day any more than 
Christmas Day!) That means you&rsquo;re actually gonna have to spend time with 
family, friends, and loved ones for a few days. Oh darn!&nbsp; Hope that 
shopping is almost done!&nbsp; If not, be sure you tune in for those last 
minute gift ideas!&nbsp; Thanks for tuning in and we&rsquo;ll see you back here 
tomorrow!</p> 
<p>P.S.&nbsp; What made this week&rsquo;s podcast different from any other 
podcast I&rsquo;ve done this year?&nbsp; (Other than the fact that it&rsquo;s 
the last one of the year&hellip;)</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 10: <strong>Food For Thought</strong></h5> 
<p>Well, I was going to save the podcast for Tuesday, but decided since some 
of the information was from this week that I had better put it out before it 
gets &ldquo;old&rdquo;, so a new podcast is available for your listening 
pleasure.&nbsp; Consider it your Friday Food For Thought!&nbsp; (I know, I gave 
it a different title within the audio recording).&nbsp; Here's the short 
version of the show notes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Working for Free</li> 
<li>Basic Composition</li> 
<li>Holiday Events</li> 
<li>Listener Q&amp;A</li> 
<li>Photo Tip of the Week</li> </ul> 
<p>In other news, according to Google Analytics and Feedburner data, CB hit an 
all time high in reader count yesterday with 566 people tuning in for 
Jen&rsquo;s interview!&nbsp; Thanks again go out to Jen Rinaldi for taking the 
time to sit down and participate in the Thursday Thoughts series.</p> 
<p>Not much other news to share - going out on two meetup events tonight in 
downtown Denver so should have several Christmas-y type pictures for sharing 
throughout the week next week.&nbsp; Last but not least, here&rsquo;s your 
Friday Funny from What the Duck:</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 9: <strong>Can Christmas Cards be Cool Candy</strong></h5> 
<p>Yup, I talk about 3 different types of cards that make for cool holiday 
gifts this year for the photographer you know.&nbsp; That, along with online 
photo contests, the nomination announcement for the Top 8 of 2008 
blogs/podcasts are now open, and of course, listener questions.&nbsp; I do have 
to apologize for the audio quality as I had to record it on the fly using the 
MBP in my car!&nbsp; Not too shabby after putting it all together, but not the 
greatest either.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the show notes:</p> 
<p>Web Links</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Top Blogs of '08 Nominees</li> 
<li>Listener Questions and Answers</li> 
<li>Photo Tip of the Week</li> </ul> 
<p>With so many blogs and podcasts out there, it&rsquo;s tough though - some 
were in it last year, so should I give consideration to others?&nbsp; Who do I 
go with?&nbsp; Let me know your favorites in the comments and the tallying 
shall begin.</p> 
<p>In other blog-related news, don&rsquo;t forget to vote in the poll on the 
sidebar!&nbsp; Only a few weeks left there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve also got a link to 
my twitter, to my Google profile page (you&rsquo;ve got a Google profile page, 
right?), and more I am sure will be forthcoming.&nbsp; So twitter me, 
I&rsquo;ll tweet ya back!&nbsp; Until next week, Happy Shooting!</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 8: <strong>Money, Socializing, and Freebies</strong></h5> 
<p>Hey all, welcome to the Tuesday blog post for CB - today the latest in the 
Canon Blogger Digital Podcast Series is up for your mobile listening 
pleasure.&nbsp; It turns out I can ramble on for quite a bit as I take a look 
at three distinct topics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Making Money in Photography</li> 
<li>The Value of Social Networks</li> 
<li>and some Free Web Resources that you may have missed</li> </ul> 
<p>I also take the usual spate of reader/listener questions (great ones this 
go around, so thanks and shout outs to Marcus, Krista, and Nick!&nbsp; In the 
future, send me links to your websites so I can return the generosity on the 
podcast and here on the blog post.&nbsp; For now though - thanks!&nbsp; Also, 
I&rsquo;ve set up a special email address for listener questions.&nbsp; You can 
keep using the original (Jason &lt;AT&gt; canonblogger &lt;DOT&gt; com, but now 
a special one has been set up at:&nbsp; questions &lt;AT&gt; canonblogger 
&lt;DOT&gt; com too!&nbsp; So, share your questions, comments, and feedback 
through the many opportunities here at the blog and via email.</p> 
<p>A couple of show notes:</p> 
<p>The 1st segment is a more detailed look from yesterdays post on The Cost of 
Doing Business, and talks about the details involved in creating a business 
plan.</p> 
<p>The 2nd Segment looks at the value of social networking, so naturally here, 
I will suggest you stop by and say hi to me on Twitter, Flickr, and through the 
various forums I participate in.</p> 
<p>And last but not least, on the subject of freebies, my apologies for the 
two contest mentions from Popular Photography, but they have since closed (I 
hate it when they don&rsquo;t indicate that at the source page!), sorry!</p> 
more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 7: <strong>Creative and Communicative Processes</strong></h5> 
<p>The latest podcast episode has been published and in this week&rsquo;s 
episode I talk about a new podcast to hit the airwaves - Digital Photography 
Life, hosted by none other than Scott Sherman and Michael Stein.&nbsp; If these 
names sound familiar it&rsquo;s because I have talked about them and their 
podcast before when they used to host The Digital Photography Life.&nbsp; Tune 
in to the podcast to listen to the details&nbsp; Their show notes are posted on 
Scott&rsquo;s blog, and their show is right here at Personal Life Media.</p> 
<p>The podcast also raises an interesting question about the disconnect 
between creative thinking versus communicative thinking and looks at the 
disconnect that often occurs between these two mindsets.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not 
heard anyone talk about this specifically before, so would be interested 
especially in reader thoughts on this particular subject!</p> 
<p>Last but not least, I also look at some of the more exciting things that 
were a part of Photoshop User Magazine&rsquo;s latest issue (December 2008) 
including the Gonzo Gear Guide from Scott Kelby, and the 100 Greatest Photoshop 
tips!&nbsp; Of course the show, as always, is rounded out with a few Q&amp;A, 
and a Road Tip for you.&nbsp; So, download the latest to your iPod, MP3 player 
or listen on your commutes&hellip;</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 6: <strong>Photowalks and Software Cycles</strong></h5> 
<p>Tune in to this week&rsquo;s episode of the Canon Blogger Podcast Series, 
Episode #6, from either the blog or your feed readers today!&nbsp; I also 
tackle a few listener questions, and offer up a photo road tip for the 
listening audience.&nbsp; So, pick up the feed today, or stop in to the blog to 
not only download the show, but also to see the other content that isn&rsquo;t 
in the daily feeds (things like the Online Photography Test, Colors and 
Textures Galleries, polls and more!</p> 
<p>As I tinker a little with the audio quality of the show and try to make 
things more seamless and enjoyable, you&rsquo;ll notice I am pushing the show 
out in segments, with some music to break things up in little snips between the 
subject material.&nbsp; If you like it, chime in via the comments section of 
the blog.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t like it, well&hellip;chime in via the 
comments section of the blog.&nbsp; If you are ambivalent, well&hellip;chime in 
via the comments in the blog!</p> 
<p>Hmmm&hellip;seems like someone would like to hear what the listening 
audience thinks of the changes in the format for the audio podcast.&nbsp; And 
it also seems that the feedback can easily be done via:&nbsp; the comments 
section of the blog!</p> 
<p> If you&rsquo;ve listened to the show and are still yearning for more, 
please stop by fellow podcasters Scott Sherman and Michael Stein&rsquo;s new 
podcast series:&nbsp; Digital Photography Life.&nbsp; Formerly, these guys 
hosted the Digital Photography Show on another network and they&rsquo;ve since 
moved on.&nbsp; Their first show on the new network right here at Personal Life 
Media is up and ready for your listening pleasure, so do stop over and give it 
a listen - great to have them back on the air!&nbsp; Their podcast can be found 
linked on the right.</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 5: <strong>Nitty Gritty Details</strong></h5> 
<p>Today, I take a look at some lighting resources online, some great patterns 
inside CS3 (not available in CS4), and I take a few listener questions and 
answers, including recording software, crop factors, and photo 
terminology.&nbsp; Finally, I wrap up with some contest news, a road tip and a 
poll update.&nbsp; Be sure to tune in for a show chock full of useful resources!
</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 4: <strong>Don't Fear the Forums</strong></h5> 
<p>Today, I take a somewhat introductory look at the prevalence of photography 
forums across the internet.&nbsp; With communities cropping up for every nuance 
and interest, one literally has dozens, if not hundreds upon thousands to 
choose from.&nbsp; Everything from lighting, to portraiture, landscape, 
architecture, and even food photography has a community of avid 
participants.&nbsp; What to make of it all?&nbsp; Which ones are good and which 
are not as beneficial as others?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve referenced a few communities 
here from time to time, including ones that I still participate in on a regular 
and on-going basis.</p> 
<p>As my interests wax and wane into different specifics, I find myself moving 
from one community to another in search of what I am looking for and I suspect 
others do the same.&nbsp; What are we looking for?&nbsp; Well, that can vary 
depending on where we&rsquo;ve been and where we want to go.&nbsp; So, to kind 
of help clear the air on all the vagaries of photo forums online, I cobbled 
together my weekly podcast to talk about three basic types that I see all over 
the internet.</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 3: <strong>Off Camera Lighting</strong></h5> 
<p>In this week's episode, I look at off-camera lighting, specifically at 
radio transmitters, infrared transmitters and a number of different companies 
that deliver products.&nbsp; Pricing from various websites was also 
reported.&nbsp; As prices may change, and sales may happen, those are 
approximate according to the date of publication.&nbsp; So, if you have 
questions about off-camera flash, this may be a good starting point.&nbsp; Tune 
in to get the low-down on everything from PocketWizards to Cybersyncs, Skyports 
and more.</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 2: <strong>Monday Morning Quarterback</strong></h5> 
<p>Find out about various online groups and communities galore through Flickr, 
Strobist, and locally, the Colorado Strobists as great resources for learning 
past the DIY stage.</p> more. <br>

<p> </p> <br>

<h5>Episode 1: <strong>Noise, Lighting, and Links... Oh My!</strong></h5> 
<p>In this episode I take a look at some &quot;best practices&quot; for post 
processing noise and sharpening with your images inside of Photoshop.&nbsp; 
There's also a few web links of interest, including one on how to make your own 
backlight!</p> more. <br>
