 &nbsp; 
<h1>Sony Alpha 77 review &ndash; tomorrow today</h1>  By admin, on October 
17th, 2011 
<p></p> 
<p>It must be two years ago, at least, that an Australian sports photographer 
confided he had seen a Sony prototype which would blow away everything &ndash; 
an Alpha which could shoot at incredible frame rates (he mentioned 15fps) and 
follow focus. It may have been something unlike the Alpha 77, which follows 
focus 12fps with locked preset exposure, or in any appropriate exposure mode at 
8fps. Or it may have been an early experiment. Whatever it was, the 77 is close 
to this rumoured prototype .</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Alpha 77 is a successor to the Alpha 700. Here is beside my old and 
well-worn 700.</p> 
<p><strong>The viewfinder</strong></p> 
<p>The Alpha 77 is a camera that points the way for future development, 
whether of DSLT (Sony &lsquo;Translucent&rsquo; mirror technology) or entirely 
mirrorless SLR-mount bodies. It&rsquo;s the OLED viewfinder with 2.4 megapixels 
of self-illuminating RGB which changes the game. It makes the transition from 
optical to electronic viewfinders likely for everything except a limited choice 
of professional optical viewfinder DSLRs. EVFs will not be unique to Sony and 
it will continue to develop in resolution, colour fidelity and refresh rate.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>But this type of viewfinder has a specific limitation. Unlike earlier EVFs, 
the Sony OLED has a threshold below which it simply turns the pixel 
illumination off entirely. To save battery power, this is set to a relatively 
high black level and clips the three-quarter tones straight to d-Max. All EVFs 
are slightly unsatisfactory to the human eye because there&rsquo;s no real 
shadow detail to see if you switch your glance away from well-illuminated parts 
of the view. The new OLED has dead black shadows and it doesn&rsquo;t matter 
how much your brighten it, the cutoff is based on exposure level in the image.
</p> 
<p>If you own an A55/33/35 then the new finder is so far removed it might as 
well be an entirely different era, not just a generation. The area surrounding 
the huge visual image is dead black, not milky and luminescent like the A55. 
The shooting information is set neatly outside the image, not overlaid at the 
edge overlapping picture detail. The colours are bright and the information 
text, though smaller to the eye, is crisper and far more legible.</p> 
<p>One comment<em> (added after this was first published)</em> &ndash; the 
A55/33/35 may be considered better in very low light. In good light, the 
OLED/24 megapixel combination is excellent. In low light, it shows noise until 
focus and exposure are confirmed by shutter pressure, at which point the view 
clarifies and the noise reduces. In near darkness, its shows very strong noise, 
mainly red, which largely obscures any visible detail. In conditions where 
exposure was 15 seconds at f/2.8, ISO 100, using the A55 and A77 side by side 
the A55 was better. It looked grey and flat, but surprisingly detailed and 
bright into shadows which were too dark to penetrate by eye. The A77 gave a 
contrasty screen or finder image with little useful detail, nothing in the 
shadows, and very strong noise. Clearly the CMOS sensors are responsible for 
whatever level of detail is visible, and the A55 sensor seems to me have a 
couple of stops more lift to tones on the threshold of its sensitivity. The EVF 
types differ in the A55 showing more shadow detail with lower contrast, and 
lower colour saturation so the noise does not look bad. Bottom line, the A55 is 
half way to night vision; the A77 is like turning on an old UHF analogue colour 
TV, no signal, just noise.</p> 
<p>There will be users who complain that having vital information just above 
and below the image area means they don&rsquo;t see it because of their specs. 
But the A77 has the best eyepoint and visibility for this info of any model to 
date. All I can say is that if you ensure you are using the EVF correctly, you 
will always be in touch with what the camera is doing.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>This shows a &lsquo;busy&rsquo; finder display &ndash; in fact, 
everything overlaid on the photo here can be turned off leaving just the active 
focus point (a single one, if you use centre spot focus) and the neat 
information bars above and below the image area. The rest of the field is dead 
black too, not milky grey like the Alpha 55, and the contrast is high. This 
image is dropped in and has no connection to the information displayed!</em></p>
<p>The result is a very graphic view of your composition. Despite the 
impressive size of the apparent viewfinder image, it is not as large visually 
as the Alpha 900. The A700 for example is 95% field at 0.90X of a 1.5X sensor 
coverage, a viewfinder &lsquo;size index&rsquo; of 0.57X (0.95X0.9/1.5). The 
A900 is 100% of full frame at 0.74X, index 0.74X. The A77 is 100% of 1.5X 
format at 1.09X, index 0.726X. It&rsquo;s therefore closer to the A900 than the 
A700.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>The A77 eyepiece glass is much closer to the eye than the A55 or 
previous SLR models, and the upper positioned eye-sensor turns the finder on 
and off with precision saving power but causing no delays.</em></p> 
<p>But has Sony got the figures right? The A55 claims to be 1.1X and 100% 
view. Each camera has a different eyepoint &ndash; 27mm for the A77 compared to 
a mere 19mm for the A55 &ndash; but this should not be allowed to influence the 
stated apparent magnification. Placing one camera to each eye, the A77 has an 
almost 20% larger apparent viewfinder field (linear) than the A55 and about 30% 
larger than the A700. It is just a fraction smaller than the A900 as the 
calculations indicate.</p> 
<p>It looks to me as if the A55/35 manual misrepresents the EVF size in that 
camera, it very clearly is not larger than the A77. Perhaps they include the 
dead space not used for the image but for data. In the A77, the data display is 
tight and efficient and it can show everything you ever want including the ISO 
in use when you select Auto ISO.</p> 
<p>All the other figures agree. It also makes the A77 finder view an almost 
perfect match for Nikon&rsquo;s full frame DSLRs, which have a slightly smaller 
apparent screen size than the A900.</p> 
<p>The less-shadow-detailed aspect of EVF works for composition much the same 
way early Leica viewfinders did. The scene is simplified, and this tends to 
concentrate the eye on impact and simple compositions. Using the A900 alongside 
the A77, I was struck by the way the A900 puts you in touch with texture, 
colour, subtle light, and fine details. The A77 reduces the world to simpler 
tones and connects you to shapes, composition and impact.</p> 
<p>As for flicker, shearing when panning, clarity of focused detail &ndash; 
well, these are all limitations, but much reduced in this new finder. What is 
not so limiting as the A55 or the earlier NEX models is the speed of startup 
from sleep. The A77 finder really does go to sleep (the A55 is very good at 
failing to switch off) and wakes up so rapidly, as your eye approaches the 
finder, you don&rsquo;t miss the shot. Combined with the mere 1/20th second 
shutter lag, this SLT gets back to the responsiveness of classic non-AF SLRs.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>You can cycle through these displays or choose to skip one or more when 
pressing the Display button (there&rsquo;s a menu item to configure exactly 
what information each press shows you, with separate settings for the EVF and 
the rear screen). These diagrams from the manual do not represent the finder 
very well. Our colour version, using a finder overlay file supplied by Sony, 
gives an accurate view of what looking through an A77 finder is like.<br>
</em>
</p> 
<p>Here I am, I&rsquo;ve written stacks about the viewfinder and not even 
begun to describe it fully. Tell you what &ndash; go and find one, try it. I 
can&rsquo;t photograph it adequately (I have tried) and it would be exhaustive 
to go through the deep menu settings of the A77 which let you decide for 
example how many different information-display setups you scroll through when 
you press the Display button. Don&rsquo;t want EVER to see the horizon level 
guage? Then set the camera to skip it. Hate the graphic display of f-number and 
shutter speed scales against each other? Deselect that too.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>From the Alpha 77 Karma Sutra &ndash; left, position for portrait 
photography; right, position for those who like to video themselves and still 
look as if they are in eye contact with the viewer.</em></p> 
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the rear screen. It has a double hinge and rotate 
action, of which more later. It is a top grade screen, 3 inches and nearly a 
megapixel. If you plug an HDMI monitor in to the camera, that will take over 
providing a better solution for studio or video previewing. Even a 20 inch or 
larger HDTV set looks sharp when fed from the Alpha 77.</p> 
<p>The menus of the A77 require the attention to website presentation detail 
best reserved for the galley-slaves* ofdPreview. Trust me, if there&rsquo;s 
anything which can be set on any other Alpha, it&rsquo;s probably settable on 
the 77 or not there at all. I&rsquo;m sad to see that I can only control my 
auto ISO range minimum between 100 and 12800, and my maximum between&hellip; 
100 and 12800! Of course this is great. I can have auto ISO over any possible 
sensible range but not ISO 50.</p> 
<p><em>*Queried on dPreview forums &ndash; I&rsquo;m an ex-newspaperman. 
Galleys are proofs of type (or the metal itself) and if you&rsquo;ve ever 
worked on the TV listings or the Sports pages, you&rsquo;ll know what it means 
to be a galley-slave in editorial terms &ndash; form before function, and 
function before fun! Well, I can have fun. I do not have to reproduce every 
single screen and menu because there&rsquo;s no big boss saying that&rsquo;s 
how it is done!</em> <em>It&rsquo;s great work that dPreview undertake. But as 
someone else has already done it, I prefer to spend my energy doing the stuff 
they haven&rsquo;t done. Then you can read both.</em></p> 
<p>ISO 50? What use is that, with less dynamic range than 100?* It&rsquo;s a 
great deal of use. In my studio with powerful flash &ndash; which this camera 
can cope with perfectly, having a setting to over-ride exposure simulation in 
the EVF/screen and do auto gain for modelling lights &ndash; it gives me an 
extra stop instead of being forced to work at a setting like f/13 or get 
overexposure. Outdoors in bright light it combines with the 1/8,000th top 
shutter speed to remove the need for a 4X ND filter to get superwide apertures, 
but due to reduced dynamic range, it&rsquo;ll still clip whatever highlight 
would have been clipped with an overexposed ISO 100 shot. In the studio I can 
control my contrast to use it well.</p> 
<p>*This is Sony&rsquo;s own statement in the manual, page 139: <em>&ldquo;The 
recordable range of the brightness of a subject (dynamic range) is slightly 
narrower for areas where ISO is less than 100.&rdquo;</em>. DxO Labs tests 
actually say that colour depth, tone depth, dynamic range and signal to noise 
ratio are all at their best if you set ISO 50, but they also show that ISO 50 
is really ISO 63 overexposed a bit and ISO 100 is really ISO 80 underexposed a 
bit. Where that leaves the intermediate 64 and 80 settings on the camera we can 
only guess.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>As well as all the info in the finder and on the back LCD, you get this 
top plate LCD which means you can close the back one. Even when the camera is 
asleep (power save mode) the sensor must still be receiving and handling the 
image, as the exposure display will change when you move the camera around. 
I&rsquo;d guess this is a low power mode which also enables the system to 
continue to monitor exposure between frames during sequence shooting.<br>
</em>
</p> 
<p>At first I did not fall in love with the Alpha 77 &ndash; when my purchased 
firmware 1.02 version body locked up on me in front of one Canon and one Nikon 
user I was just a little angry with it. It could have done this somewhere 
quiet, on its own, without spectators. Even now with firmware 1.03 I am not 
sure it won&rsquo;t repeat the cataleptic fit, but it shows no signs of doing 
so. See my section on the Movie mode later on, though&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>The SLT mirror and ghosting</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve tested the Alpha 77 in the most demanding lighting conditions. 
Sony says the SLT mirror (a very thin film of plastic stretched on a frame) has 
new mirror and antireflection coatings. They have also paid extra attention to 
the design of the AF module and the interior of the darkchamber, to avoid 
reflections.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Though some colour fringes on the bright water definitely hit this 16-80mm 
CZ shot (along with a colour bokeh issue making those in the foreground magenta 
and those to the rear greenish) there was no hint of any ghosts or flare in 
dozens of shots taken in conditions like this.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>This light is extreme, and the patches of sun and reflection are placed 
exactly where the Alpha 55 tended to produce flare. The Alpha 77 shows no sign 
of it, and has not in any of our photographs so far.</em></p> 
<p>As far as loss of sharpness goes, I do not believe there is any more 
significant sharpness loss from the SLT pellicle than there is from, for 
example, the rear filter permanently fitted into a 300mm f/2.8 Apo G tele. Both 
are between the lens and the sensor and both are plane clear optical elements. 
If anything the glass thickness and distinct double air to glass surfaces of a 
rear mounted filter make it far more likely to degrade an image than the SLT. 
Almost any filter you fit in front of the lens is going to have a greater 
effect (unless you spend a stack of money, a really bad effect on 24 megapixels 
&ndash; we&rsquo;ve replaced our older Minolta, pre-digital Hoya and other 
filters with the latest Sigma EX DG after testing them).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This is just a routine test I ran at all ISO settings to check colour and 
tonal response. Not noise. I already knew before doing this that the noise 
thing was a non-issue for the simple reason that this sensor beats anything 
else out there; I&rsquo;ll start pixel-peeping for noise when another maker 
comes along and shows they can do this pixel density better. The colour is also 
very consistent indeed across the ISO range and the feathers in the mask retain 
the expected detail up to ISO 3200.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This picture was taken using a setting I quickly discovered is just perfect 
for news, PR, presentations and images needed quickly from events &ndash; the 
Small JPEG in camera, with DRO enabled, at ISO 3200. Sampling down to one 
quarter of the file size (still large enough for an A4 print) creates a dead 
sharp, low noise image. Photographers do some good, occasionally &ndash; this 
is a cheque for &pound;3000 being presented to DJ Dave Lee Travis for thePACE 
Centre charity, by the Master Photographers Association. Their annual dinner 
happened just a week after I got my Alpha 77. I was confident enough to risk 
taking all my press and PR shots on the new camera.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And this is a 100% pixel level view of that shot without any post 
processing.</p> 
<p><strong>Input and feedback</strong></p> 
<p>Then again, having to set up the camera and realising the full extent of 
the customisation possible through the Menu and Fn buttons, I felt depressed. 
This was almost like handling a Canon 7D &ndash; one of those cameras where, if 
someone passes it to you, you can never be sure if it has been configured only 
for photographing flocks of ibis flying behind bare poplar trees. Would its 19 
AF points and 11 cross type sensors do the 7D trick of locking on to a sweet 
wrapper someone dropped on the lawn instead of the wedding group a yard further 
away?</p> 
<p>Well, yes. The A77 can do that sort of wrong stuff if left on <em>wide area
</em> focus &ndash; but it doesn&rsquo;t light up the wrong AF points in the 
finder to fool you, and it does not require programming of AF preferences to 
avoid proximity or response speed errors (both Canon and Nikon pro models can 
disappoint if used &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo;, and need their defaults 
changing depending on your typical photo situations). Instead, if provides very 
accurate feedback about which sensors are being used. And it has Face Detection 
which really works, because this is a live view camera 100%. I have never liked 
Face Detection much until the SLT EVF generation arrived. Even then, not much.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Face detection kept the focus on photographer Paul Cooper (right) 
accepting the president&rsquo;s ribbon of the MPA from Henk van Kooten (left) 
despite Henk&rsquo;s focus-target jacket moving into the foreground of the AF 
zones. Taken by stage lights at ISO 3200</em></p> 
<p>I had to take a few shots where a person receiving a presentation was 
facing the camera, and the presenter often stepped into shot with back of head 
to the lens. With Face Detection on, the A77 never once switched focus to the 
nearer person, and always stayed locked on to the subject facing me. This is a 
situation where the above-mentioned makes, if allowed to use wide area or multi 
point AF, tend to shift focus to the foreground intruder because as 
conventional DSLRs they don&rsquo;t have Face Detection in optical viewfinder 
mode.</p> 
<p>The auto exposure of the A77 seems to be more closely linked to active AF 
points than any previous model. It may have 1,200 metering zones on the CMOS 
sensor but it will bias strongly towards correct exposure at the point or 
points of focus, especially if the central point coincides with a very bright 
are. I do not mean it is<em>literally</em> spot metering. I mean that, for 
example, in my office with medium lighting and a very bright computer screen if 
the camera is aimed at the screen the exposure in matrix mode, with centre spot 
focus, becomes correct for the screen and the rest dark. When the screen is 
moved away from the centre zone, exposure increases by two stops even though 
the overall image contains about the same brightness.</p> 
<p>What I&rsquo;m seeing may not be the same sort of meter-linking-to-AF that 
is found in the Canon EOS 400D, as an example. This will give you over or under 
exposure if the focus point hits a dark or light area. The A77 biases towards 
avoiding overexposure. A dark subject at the central focus point does not seem 
to brighten the image the same way a very light subject, like a screen, darkens 
it.</p> 
<p>This is not like separate metering cell TTL, the classic Minolta honeycomb. 
It isn&rsquo;t even like a camera with centre weighted or spot optically fed 
meter cells. Every point on the sensor is a spot meter even though you can only 
&lsquo;spot meter&rsquo; from the centre. Every point is equally sensitive down 
to EV&ndash;2 (ISO 100 with f/1.4 lens) and up to EV17. It is four times more 
sensitive as a matrix/centre-weighted meter than the Alpha 900 and a staggering 
16 times more sensitive than A900 spot metering mode. It also has +5 to -5 EV 
exposure compensation compared to the A700&prime;s+/-3EV<em>(A900 &ndash; 3EV, 
expanded to 5EV by later firmware, but the 700 was never improved &ndash; see 
comments, originally I referred to A900 as 3EV either way, as that&rsquo;s in 
the manual)</em>. And whatever things the SLT mirror does, it seems to feed the 
new AF module plenty of light &ndash; it&rsquo;s able to focus in conditions 
half as bright as the A900.<em>Added comment: the A77 metering is four times as 
sensitive as the new Canon D1 X, so although that camera has amazing 
sensitivity up to ISO 204,800 the A77 will actually meter exposure in lower 
light.</em></p> 
<p>So, after a couple of weeks, I began to realise that the A77 was giving an 
even lower failure-rate than the A55. I had learned which settings to prefer 
&ndash; three zone focus for example is far better than old-style wide area and 
almost makes single centre spot focus redundant. I was finding that exposure is 
generous but never highlight-clipped, because it&rsquo;s read from the actual 
imaging sensor; you can trust the simulation given by the EVF, too, and adust 
the +/- over-ride with confidence.</p> 
<p>The camera stopped being complex and started to suit my declining mental 
powers. Life is a curve. You start just learning to set shutter, aperture and 
focus. In your prime, you want to set twenty different things for every shot 
and switch from P to A to S to M with C or S or A and -2 sharpness and ten stop 
HDR then portrait look for the next one. Ultimately as the brain cells sneak 
off for a nap you find good old shutter speed, aperture and focus do you just 
fine.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>If you need reminding in big print, let the rear LCD see the light of 
day, and you get this big clear information pane on demand.</em></p> 
<p>Now some cameras have fooled me, there are no dials and they just hid this 
stuff from me so I&rsquo;d end up with bad things like the optically soft set 
of landscape pix I shot at 1/2000th and f/5.6 (wide open) on the NEX-5 last 
month. But the Alpha 77 with its top plate LCD info display, its &lsquo;come to 
life&rsquo; burst of finder shooting information when you take first shutter 
pressure and confirm focus &ndash; well, it is constantly reminding me what I 
am doing. I know other cameras and other Alphas have finder displays, even the 
NEX was probably telling my longsighted eyes what it was up to, but the Alpha 
77 presents working information better than any camera I&rsquo;ve used. It is 
simply a very clear and well designed display both in-camera and on the rear 
screen.</p> 
<p>If you enable image review, the SLT cameras slow down. I fold the rear 
screen to face the camera back. I have turned off image review. I shoot with 
confidence just as I would once have done on film and sometimes I do not check 
a single image until I&rsquo;ve copied the card contents to my computer.</p> 
<p><strong>Button pushing</strong></p> 
<p>The Alpha 77 has loads of buttons despite Sony&rsquo;s one-time insistence 
that they planned to have fewer mechanical components in future. There are nine 
push buttons, one rocker button and one control wheel on the back of the camera 
alone; five push buttons, one collar switch, one shutter and control wheel on 
the RH top. Then there&rsquo;s the stray stop-down button, the lens change 
release and the AF-mode switch living round the mount.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Rear screen folded away and protected &ndash; that&rsquo;s how I use 
the camera all the time. Plenty of buttons to push &ndash; and you can have fun 
swapping their functions round to confuse your friends!</em></p> 
<p>Several of these buttons can have their functions modified so they no 
longer do what it says on the silkscreened white or blue print (white for 
shooting mode, blue for playback). If you are particularly odd you can even 
swap round functions and confuse people who borrow your camera (shades of 
Canon!). If you are relatively normal you can leave this well alone. You may 
customise the stop-down preview button to show the final picture effect instead 
(stop-down plus picture style and shutter speed result) and through the menus 
you can change the behaviour of lens-resident Focus Hold. The instruction 
manual omits to mention these are on the lens, and not on all lenses &ndash; 
some owners have spent ages looking for the Focus Hold button which does not

<p>What&rsquo;s most odd about the A77 is that three of the main 
dedicated-function buttons are completely interchangeable. ISO (next to the

<p><em>*The entries I&rsquo;ve marked with an asterisk already have their own 
dedicated buttons for which these are normal function choices (AEL button, for 
example, covers all the first four but can only do one function, preset in 
menus).</em></p> 
<p>There is one button you may want to modify if you own lenses with a Focus 
Hold button. The AF/MF button, by default, performs this function with most 
lenses (it switches to MF when pressed, the same effect as holding focus). So 
it&rsquo;s almost a spare button, given that there&rsquo;s also an AF/MF switch 
on SSM/SAM lenses and a body AF/MF/S/A/C switch too. Since it sits right next 
to the AEL button and closest to the rear control wheel, it a natural choice 
for any function you might want to use in a hurry.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You can not change the function of the Finder/LCD manual switch button, the 
Drive Mode, the White Balance or the Exposure Override. You can switch the 
Preview and Smart Teleconverter buttons between two functions each only. The Fn 
button accesses all the parameters you can&rsquo;t reach directly through any 
custom button (like setting the Auto ISO range) and most that you can (like 
Face Detection). Its full function list is:</p> 
<p>Memory Recall (only present when mode dial set to MR)<br>

<p></p> 
<p>The Display button can not be customised and only serves to cycle through 
Display setups &ndash; but you can customise those, and thus what the button 
does for you (above, Menu to set which finder display states you wish to cycle 
through, ticked). The Help (?) button can also not be customised, which if you 
don&rsquo;t want potted hints and tips makes it redundant in shooting mode, 
though it serves as the Trash button when reviewing images. The Playback also 
can&rsquo;t be customised, nor can the Menu button (which can return to Last 
Used or Top by setting a preference), nor the top LCD illuminator button. This 
one is interesting because it toggles &ndash; the panel light remains on until 
the camera goes to sleep, or it&rsquo;s pressed again to turn off.</p> 
<p>In use, I found there was one button missing which would make a huge 
difference to this camera. The 12fps ultra high speed shooting mode is only 
accessible through the mode dial. Because of the way the camera handles bursts 
of frames and buffering, it would be useful to be able to shoot normally in any 
mode (single frame, or other continuous speed) and switch to 12fps by holding 
down or toggling a button (preferably holding down, say, the AF/MF lock 
reassigned for this purpose).</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a neat touch &ndash; as long as you have a lens with no MF/AF 
switch on it, you can set M focus on the body selector, and pressing the AF/MF 
button will do autofocus for you, letting it go will lock the focus back to 
manual. That&rsquo;s another reason to like my 16-80mm CZ on the A77 &ndash; 
ideal for studio products or architecture, or indeed for landscape. It does not 
work with the 18-55mm SAM. There is in fact a bit of an overall mess with SAM, 
SSM, and standard lens focus types including the assignable DMF (direct manual 
focus) to the AF-A mode. There are some lenses where you are warned never to 
use body MF setting always only to use the lens switch. What you will find is 
that some menu items are greyed out, and some buttons don&rsquo;t work, if a 
mismatched combination is set.</p> 
<p><strong>Lens compatibility</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>The new 16-50mm f/2.8 is enabled for in-camera lens corrections</em></p>
<p>This leads to the general question of lenses and the A77 generation. It 
seems there&rsquo;s some additional information chipped into some but not all 
lenses which enables the Lens Correction function (Vignetting, Chromatic 
Aberration and Distortion) for in-camera JPEGs. Raw files are unaffected, and I 
don&rsquo;t know if this information is used to enable better panoramas but 
that would be a practical fringe benefit. But since the 18-55mm SAM, 55-200mm 
mk2 SAM, and 18-250mm (an old design relatively) are in the release firmware 
along with the 16-50mm SSM maybe there&rsquo;s no info in the lenses 
themselves, and future firmware will add more.</p> 
<p>The oddest incompatibility is the manual&rsquo;s statement that Front 
Curtain Shutter should not be set on ON for &lsquo;Konica Minolta&rsquo; lenses
<em> (added note &ndash; see Comments at the end of this article, some 
discussion of this)</em>. First of all, the description of Front Curtain 
Shutter is misleading. When this is set to ON, it means NO front curtain 
shutter &ndash; electronic gating instead. When it is off, you are using the 
physical Front Curtain, the blades uncover the sensor to start the exposure. 
The manual does make it clear that by Front Curtain Shutter Sony means No Front 
Curtain Shutter.</p> 
<p>But what is a Konica Minolta lens? There are very few, nearly all were made 
by Tamron. Konica Minolta never even got round to rebranding the Apo G lenses, 
they just changed the box and the lens cap and left Minolta as the name on the 
lens. I have a 28-75mm Konica Minolta, a 17-35mm Konica Minolta and at one 
point I had an 18-200mm, and of course, the kit 18-70mm and various horrible 
full frame plastic lenses like the 28-100mm. I think there are 75-300mms in KM 
guise.</p> 
<p>Everything else prior to Sony was Minolta because KM simply never made any, 
or if they did, it amounted to no more than a box label change. To confuse 
things, some of these Konica Minolta like the 18-70mm, 18-200mm and 75-300mm 
became Sony lenses without a single substantial change. And many Minolta lenses 
became Sony lenses while retaining a heritage right back to pre-D days or the 
origins of the AF system itself. The 28mm f/2.8 is the most obvious example, 
the 50mm f/1.4 another.</p> 
<p>Why would an electronic front curtain produce overexposure or inconsistent 
exposure only with Konica Minolta lenses? Given the very fast response time 
(1/20th of a second) and high speed of the system (1/250th flash sync, 
1/8,000th shutter) the only thing I can think of would be the speed of aperture 
closing action. It is also something which would be invisible in revised 
lenses; maybe the Sony 18-70mm kit lens actually has aperture blades which 
close 50 milliseconds sooner than the KM equivalent.</p> 
<p>This would also mean earlier Minolta lenses, not just KM, might produce 
overexposure (aperture still not fully closed when exposure commences) or 
uneven exposure (aperture continues to close down during part of the electronic 
progressive gate-opening). The same would apply to many third party lenses.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is why the warning is made, and that singling 
out Konica Minolta lenses is an error. Any one individual lens may have 
sluggish diaphragm, indeed a common cause of overexposure in all A-mount lenses 
is incomplete stop-down. So the advice should be don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;Front 
Curtain Shutter&rsquo; set to ON with anything except Sony A-mount lenses 
&ndash; or test your independent lens before use.</p> 
<p>A warning about not setting Micro AF adjustment with third party lenses is 
given, as usual. This is because the makers borrow lens identity codes. The 
Sigma 12-24mm f/4.5-5.6 Mk1 has the same code as the Minolta/KM 28-80mm kit 
lens. This issue will also affect the behaviour of the Auto Lens Correction 
register, which in our body does not have any effect on the CZ 16-80mm for 
example but does correct the new 16-50mm. I would guess 
&lsquo;correctable&rsquo; lenses have extra information, older and third party 
lens won&rsquo;t. So don&rsquo;t bank on this function fixing JPEGs from your 
&lsquo;heritage&rsquo; of early Sony glass!</p> 
<p>Sigma has issued a list of lenses which are known to have AF problems with 
the Alpha 77/65, and will upgrade them free of charge. You can read the list 
here:http://www.sigma-photo.co.jp/english/news/info_111014.htm. It includes the 
18-250mm HSM OS, which we have. Ours does not seem to have any issues at all on 
our A77 with firmware 1.03. I&rsquo;ve also tested the 8-16mm and 100-300mm OS, 
70mm macro and 70-200mm f/2.8 HSM Macro MkII. These are not in the warning list 
and all seem to work well, even though they do not work reliably with the Alpha 
55.</p> 
<p>The A77 has Fast/Slow AF options and I&rsquo;ve used Fast. The accuracy of 
the AF is much better than any previous Alpha model.</p> 
<p><strong>Autofocus and exposure</strong></p> 
<p>The 19-sensor, 11-cross AF module is not most densely populated &ndash; the 
A900 has 10 extra hidden &lsquo;tracking assist&rsquo; line sensors bringing it 
up the same total (they are there, they just don&rsquo;t have screen markings) 
and its central double cross sensor is technically the best type around. But 
having eleven cross sensors does more good in practice.</p> 
<p>AF has a new mode, Zone. This creates three groups of sensors left centre 
and right which act like mini wide zones. Wide Area focus can, of course, 
locate widely spaced details which are concurrently in focus. Zone identifies 
the zone with the most focused points, then works within this area. It can use 
information about the change in confirmed focus within one zone to help track 
the subject into the next zone. It also gets the exposure right more of the 
time.</p> 
<p>Because the sensor is feeding image data to an analysing computer, Face 
Recognition and Object Tracking can be linked to the AF. There must be some 
theoretical speed penalty &ndash; something must be slowed down by microseconds 
if you enable these functions. I can&rsquo;t detect it. The only slowdown is 
the time you take to press the central controller button to register an subject 
for tracking. Smile Shutter is also possible. My subjects normally scowl so I 
don&rsquo;t use this.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>The focus point &ndash; here, centre focus spot aimed first at the 
family and then held using the shutter release to recompose the scene &ndash; 
helps determine exposure. The 1200-zone metering has correctly placed the 
baby&rsquo;s white clothes in the value range 250 to 254 RGB.</em></p> 
<p>The most reliable and accurate focusing method remains central single spot 
focus, or local selectable single spot. Now that all of these are cross-type, 
there is no compulsion to stick with the centre and recompose, but it&rsquo;s a 
habit hard to lose. I have already observed that the metering in spot mode is 
16 times more sensitive than spot metering in the 900, and I would guess that 
when the system biases matrix metering values to the centre focus point, 
there&rsquo;s a related gain if not that much. There is a proper near-IR AF 
illuminator in the camera body &ndash; Minolta tradition lives on! Without 
flash, it really is possble to focus in the dark and the EVF does a very grainy 
but usable job as a night vision viewer too. The illuminator also enables 
focusing on plain surfaces as it projects a pattern.</p> 
<p>The SLT mirror of the 77 diverts 30% of light to the AF module, but this is 
actually more than the old semisilvered patch and double mirror system used to 
let through in SLRs. The AF sensor itself may not be any more sensitive, 
it&rsquo;s simply getting a much better image feed. This 30%, by the way, means 
the light reaching the sensor is reduced not by the 1/3rd to 1/2 a stop 
sometimes mentioned, but by .6 of a stop or nearly 2/3rds of a stop. 50% would 
be one stop.<em> (See comments at the end of the article for some more precise 
figures on the mirror split provided by Dr Daniel Oi)</em>.</p> 
<p>My experience so far with the camera indicates that exposure is very 
reliable over the entire EV range. I simply leave it on the matrix multi-zone 
setting. The EVF warns me if it&rsquo;s going to bias too much to the focus 
point.</p> 
<p><strong>High speed shooting</strong></p> 
<p>This brings me to the aspect of high speed sequences. No cameras in this 
class has ever achieved 12fps, let alone at 24 megapixels. In theory you get 13 
raw or 11 RAW+JPEG frames before the camera slows down, and it looks as if the 
buffer must hold about 320MB. The camera does not have a dual processor like 
the Alpha 900, and it does not benefit from the robust performance of fast CF 
cards.</p> 
<p>Autofocus is provided in Hi drive mode, along with AE (8fps, accessed via 
the Drive function button, in any shooting mode). Using this shooting speed you 
have full control.</p> 
<p>In Speed Priority AE mode (the 12fps setting on the mode dial) the focus is 
locked before frame 1 if you have the camera set to Single (S) AF, but in 
exchange for this, you can set both the ISO and the aperture. You can also set 
these if you use Manual focus.</p> 
<p>If you set the focus mode to C (Continuous) then both AE and AF continue 
during shooting. You can set the ISO, but not the aperture, so the ISO is your 
only way control the shutter speed.<em>Added note: the Canon 1D X has now 
bettered this record high speed shooting by providing 14fps. This mode in the 
Canon locks both AE and Focus with the first frame, locks the mirror up, and 
you must use Live View on the rear screen to compose the shot. For focus 
tracking with viewfinder, the 1D X is limited to 12fps.</em></p> 
<p>12fps is very impressive. It makes a huge difference in action work. I 
often test sequence shooting on the local races, and I quickly found that even 
tracking a horse (necessary to keep it in the frame at all for more than one 
shot at 3fps) certain frame rates just produced two stages in its stride, 
repeated. The horse was galloping at 2.5 clops per second and I was shooting at 
5fps. With 7fps it gets better, 8fps or 10fps still better and with 12 fps you 
reach the point where four different positions of the legs are recorded.</p> 
<p>Also, it becomes possible to aim the camera at a fixed spot like a hurdle, 
and fire, capturing several positions of the horse before it leaves the field 
of view. It is not as necessary to pan with the subject every time to get more 
than one shot.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Animation of three hand-held frames, cropped from a Sigma 70-200mm shot 
taken at 70mm, showing how 12fps captures very fast action in relatively small 
steps. At 5fps, the second frame would have the horse leaving the right-hand 
edge.<br>
</em></p> 
<p>In practice, you certainly get your 13 raw or 11 R+J shots at 12fps or the 
slower AF-capable Hi 8fps setting &ndash; or indeed at the slower 3fps rate. 
But you don&rsquo;t get anything like the same continuous shooting capability 
as past models even if you knock the JPEG size right down. You&rsquo;ll get 
around 18 Normal Small JPEGs (6 megapixels, lowest quality) at 10 to 12fps 
before the rate slows down to an erratic 3fps with occasional half to one 
second pauses. For raw files, after your 13-ish burst is up, you may get 
between 0.5 and 1 frame per second with occasional one to two second pauses. 
With an average SD card (20MB/s write) you will wait 15-20 seconds after the 
last shot before being able to shoot fast bursts again.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s another sequence, this time as stills without the annoying 
animation you can&rsquo;t turn off </p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>And here, below, is a 100% crop from the original ISO 800 raw file 
processed using Adobe Camera Raw 6.5 (Sharpness 50, Radius 0.5, Detail 0, 
Masking 0; Luminance NR 25, Luminance Detail 50, same from Chroma NR)</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Sharpness? The 12fps C-AF setting forced the Sigma 70-200mm to be at 
f/3.5, two thirds of a stop down from full aperture, but also gave a shutter 
speed of 1/6400th. I could have perhaps picked another detail with slightly 
more punch, and looking at all the shots, my prefocused point was actually 
about 1 metre behind the horse (if the AF refocused during this sequence, I 
can&rsquo;t see any evidence in the images). The 8fps or Single-Shot AF 12fps 
settings allow control of aperture, and I know that f/5.6 would have cleaned 
up. Just remember you are looking at a section of an image something between 
6ft and 8ft wide, it&rsquo;s very easy to view a tiny clip like this as if it 
was just another digital image.<br>
</em></p> 
<p>I tried one technique, shoot 2, 3, 4, 6 frames with brief pauses &ndash; as 
if catching different moments of an event, in bursts. Even though I spread the 
10fps bursts over a ten second interval, by the time I had totalled 20 raw 
frames I was down to the single shot per second or worse situation.</p> 
<p>To follow up, I shot a burst then allowed the buffer to write for about 8 
seconds before firing again. I got seven frames at 12fps, which fits in with 
the card in use taking about 15 seconds to finish writing from a 13-frame burst.
</p> 
<p>For one of the horse racing tests, I shot one burst of frames and as the 
camera slowed down, two horses fell and two jockeys were injured, one requiring 
a stretcher. I was unable to get ANY pictures of the incident as it happened, 
and by the time the Alpha 77 was able to shoot again, the ambulance crew was on 
the track. Each race gave me just two chances to shoot a burst so I&rsquo;m 
afraid that testing every single setting combination on the camera was not 
possible.</p> 
<p><strong>Panorama speed mystery</strong></p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s something I don&rsquo;t understand about the raw, file and 
buffer handling of the Alpha 77. Shooting panoramas &ndash; which have to start 
with exactly the same frame by frame 24 megapixel data readout &ndash; I 
counted 42 frames apparently firing at something close to the 12fps maximum, 
then creating a panoramic JPEG, and the finished 6.7MB JPEG file was written to 
card and the buffer cleared before I had time to see if the light was still on.
</p> 
<p>What exactly is happening here? How could the processor and the buffer 
somehow handle the throughput of the wide panorama with at least double the 
number of continuous burst frames I could get with even the smallest JPEG 
&ndash; and then do all the computing to assemble the panorama and write it to 
card, leaving me ready to shoot immediately?</p> 
<p>I ask this because when shooting panoramas with the Alpha 55, my 15MB/s 
SanDisk Ultra II SD card failed &ndash; it was not fast enough, could not 
handle the data and became corrupted. Clearly panorama shooting is data 
intensive one way or another. But in the Alpha 77 it appears to be allocated 
buffer and processing power which is denied to more useful motordrive sequence 
shooting.</p> 
<p>Movie shooting does not enjoy the same fast buffer clearing. Shoot any 
higher quality movie beyond a mere blip on the button, and you can&rsquo;t fire 
a still frame for some seconds. With some HD-movie systems, you actually shot a 
still frame during the movie and lose nothing except a couple of movie frames; 
with others, you can end the movie by pressing the shutter and capturing a 
still. In yet other makes, you can shoot a still but lose two seconds during 
the movie. All these solutions are valuable when still shots could be 
important. The A77 movie function does not permit any such choice and may block 
all shooting by occupying the buffer to card writing process for many seconds.
</p> 
<p>And, in reverse, you can not initiate a movie while the card write light is 
on. I tried this with one of my horse race test subjects. I decided I would 
shoot the front runners going over a hurdle, get my 12fps burst, then do a few 
seconds of movie of the stragglers who reach the spot a few seconds later. 
Although I could have shot further (faltering) still frames, movie shooting was 
blocked out with a warning message telling me &lsquo;Writing to Memory Card 
&ndash; Unable to Operate&rsquo;. When raw shooting was set, this lasted many 
seconds, but interestingly with the small JPEG option only two or three seconds 
were blocked out.</p> 
<p>After my tests of the high speed shooting functions, I conclude that to 
cover some sports events well you would need a pair of Alpha 77s, or the 77 and 
some other camera &ndash; and you would need to keep a close eye on the card 
writing light. As a result of the performance with my SD cards giving write 
speeds around 20-30MB/s I ordered a SanDisk 45MB/s Extreme Pro, and plan to get 
a 95MB/s card when they are available.</p> 
<p><em>Added after receiving the SanDisk Extreme Pro 16GB 45MB/s card: burst 
shooting is not extended, using raw it varies from capturing 10 to 12 raw 
frames at maximum rate, sometimes with a single frame jumped (two groups of 5-6 
frames) which never happens with my ordinary Transcend 20MB/s card. Buffer to 
card writing is reduced to around 10 seconds from around 20, but at least with 
this extra card speed, there is no way to extend the approximate 1 second 
unbroken raw shooting burst.</em></p> 
<p>The Alpha 65 and 77 are the only DSLR/T cameras so far made which use the 
USH-1 SDXC specifiction to allow writing data at this kind of rate. They are 
ahead of the card game. But they need to have this capability. Anyone expecting 
to make full use of the high speed drive functions and best video quality of 
the 77 with cards like the faithful wallet full of Transcend 16GB Class 10s we 
have been using will be disappointed.</p> 
<p><strong>The dedicated Movie mode</strong></p> 
<p>On the mode dial of the A77 there is a movie position. This does not mean 
it has changed, like some Canon models, to be incapable of shooting<em>unplanned
</em> movie clips &ndash; you can do this at the press of a button, like other 
Sony models. What the Movie icon means is that you gain access to manual 
control of ISO, shutter and aperture. As a penalty, you lose AF.</p> 
<p>Why? That is easy to answer. The AF sensors in the 77 are rated for f/5.6 
aperture use. Default movie apertures range between f/3.5 (typically set on 
fast lenses) and f/6.3 (well, with an f/6.3 zoom lens there is little choice). 
AF works best in this range. If you really want to shoot AF movies at f/2.8 on 
a 200mm lens, try by all means. I have tried at f/3.5 and for every clip which 
has a smooth focus transition, there will be another where the SSM, SAM, HSM or 
plain old screw drive makes a sudden shift.</p> 
<p>So if you want to work at f/1.4, leaving focus to AF would be a disaster. 
Apart from making constant shifts, there&rsquo;s a big chance of hunting. I 
worked with the 24mm f/2 SSM Carl Zeiss for a while, and this lens does not 
find focus easily in low light with any camera. On the A77 for video it was 
auto-set to between f/2.8 and f/4 in low light. Video AF happens at the actual 
working aperture, not wide open like still AF. Being stopped down a little 
improved the 24mm&rsquo;s accuracy.</p> 
<p>And if you want to work at a smaller aperture than f/6.3 &ndash; say f/16 
for a deep focus effect with a superwide lens &ndash; then AF simply would not 
work at all. The Manual Focus restriction placed by using the Manual Movie mode 
is necessary despite the howls of protest it&rsquo;s produced from those who 
don&rsquo;t understand the technology involved. A side benefit of setting Movie 
mode on the dial is that your view through the finder is cropped correctly to 
the HD area before you start filming, which makes composition easier &ndash; 
see below.</p> 
<p>In the Movie position on the Mode dial you might believe you can use the 
self-timer. The manual ticks that box. We had to check it, but although you can 
set the Drive state, including self-timer, doing so has no effect on Movie 
shooting. Nor can you shoot stills with the Mode dial in this position. Various 
other manual details, such as indicating flash can be usedin this mode, are 
also incorrect or there&rsquo;s a small firmware glitch with the camera. I 
would expect the shutter release to be operational with the mode dial set to 
Movie, so that stills could be captured. It is disabled and<strong>you 
can&rsquo;t take still shots at all if the dial is in this position</strong>. 
Be warned!</p> 
<p>Not only that, but after I had pressed the Self Timer 10 second setting 
when in Movie mode, the LCD top display showed a single frame symbol plus the 
10 from the self-timer mode, and the shutter release was disabled even after 
returning the mode dial to Program or other settings. The Drive mode had to be 
reset to get it out of this tangle.</p> 
<p>As for the instant Movie button, it&rsquo;s not in the best place &ndash; a 
long thumb reach for on and off actions to start and end clips and the placing 
tends to make me tilt or move the camera needlessly. When adjusting the 
viewfinder dioptre to switch from working with spectacles to working without, 
it&rsquo;s so close to the dioptre control I push it occasionally by mistake. I 
would like the Movie mode to switch operation to the main shutter release OR 
the movie button.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that picture effects (see later pages) can be 
applied to movies, as can all other image adjustments, and will be seen in the 
finder as you shoot.</p> 
<p>But what you won&rsquo;t see until the moment you press the movie button is 
the working HD movie area. It is a surprisingly fierce crop from the full 
sensor, not just a top and bottom slice to HD 16:9 format. This is required for 
the Steady Shot digital, pixel-shift based movie stabilization which does not 
move the sensor like regular SS. It reduces the 1.5X area to something like a 
1.8X area, not as much &lsquo;zoom in&rsquo; as using the 1.4X smart converter 
but enough to cut heads and feet off subjects you have pre-composed using the 
full finder. There are indicator marks on the display, that&rsquo;s true, but 
you will find them hard to see in many conditions even if you remember to use 
them.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Shot with the 24mm f/2 lens &ndash; no way to move back or zoom out for 
the movie, but plenty of space you would think for the 16:9 HD crop.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>This is what the HD movie viewfinder field switches to when the Movie 
button is pressed (slightly re-composed horizontally but not cropped at all). 
The movie stabilization need the surrounding pixels. It highly effective, both 
through the live viewfinder and when viewing the results, and totally silent 
unlike sensor-shift SS. It also does not warm the sensor assembly up as much.
<br> </em></p> 
<p>A caveat to movie shooters. Select the highest quality AVCHD 2.0 formats 
(the camera will warn you) and you may not be able to play them, burn them to 
disc other than Blu-Ray, or import them into HD movie editing with programs 
like Apple<em>iMovie</em>. No doubt this will change with updates, but right 
now apart from Sony&rsquo;s PC-only<em>Picture Motion Browser</em> (they have 
now had half a decade to port it to Mac) there are few programs which can 
recognise the 1080/50 or 60p 28Mbps format and even fewer which edit it. You 
will need to buy software to do so. On my system,<em>Toast Titanium 11</em> 
includes<em>Roxio HD</em> viewer and because it is a Blu-Ray compatible disc 
authoring package, this was able to handle the .MTS files in all formats, and 
convert them to formats editable using<em>iMovie</em>. Roxio offers similar PC 
utilities.</p> 
<p>Sony <em>PMB</em> is also very useful for GPS data handling, map viewing 
and correcting GPS data. While<em>Adobe Bridge</em> with the GPS Panel 
(download from Adobe) installed allows viewing and editing of co-ordinates, it 
still has no link to<em>Google Maps</em>, Microsoft <em>Virtual Earth</em>, or 
any other useful location display.</p> 
<p><strong>Sound</strong></p> 
<p>There is no provision for audio notes or audio only recording, which is a 
bit of a waste of built-in functions as this would be possible and can be 
useful. Audio notations attached to images are popular with travellers and 
journalists.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The stereo sound is not much different to the NEX or Alpha 55 despite being 
capable of 48kHz (better than CD) sampling. The microphone under its unusual 
top grille seems less prone to wind noise than most DSLRs; the wind noise 
reduction feature, a bass cut filter, is additionally effective. Body handling 
noise is present, so is lens focus noise.</p> 
<p>The external mic socket provides 5v phantom power for popular condensor 
mics, and is stereo too. No provision for fixed gain is made &ndash; auto level 
or gain is always on. The camera needs an option to disable auto gain so that a 
preamp or mic with dB cut choices can be used to control a fixed sound level; 
better would be three levels, like Nikon; even better still a proper sound 
level monitor display and full control in fine steps like Canon. Without at 
least one of these options the Alpha 77 can not considered for semi-pro or 
professional live sound video work.</p> 
<p><strong>GPS Data</strong></p> 
<p>While I think that the GPS on the A77 has so far proved faster in locking 
and more accurate in positioning than the A55, it&rsquo;s hard to quantify as I 
have not used both together for long enough in difficult locations. To improve 
your GPS, download this file:</p> 
<p>http://control.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/GPS/assistme.dat</p> 
<p>Create a folder on your SD card inside the PRIVATE/SONY directory and call 
it GPS. Copy this file into it, put the card in your camera, switch on. Go to 
GPS in the main menus and make sure it&rsquo;s turned on, then look at the GPS 
ASSIST entry and you will find the assist data starts on the day you download 
and lasts a month. Visit the assist.dat download once a month or more often to 
keep your GPS working with the fastest and most accurate lockon and 
co-ordinates. Do not worry if you format or change cards, once in the camera 
the assist.dat file is copied to internal GPS memory. Your original card does 
not have to be present.</p> 
<p>Sony state 15 seconds or more to acquire or change position, and variable 
accuracy due to GPS being a US military provision which can be subject to 
deliberate degrading. In this model, when no GPS signal can be detected on 
power up, the camera simply turns off GPS embedding (on the A55, it uses the 
last co-ordinate). But if you are out and about, the last position may be shown 
on some pictures. I don&rsquo;t think I move that far in 15 seconds</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p><em>An example of GPS map location from Media Pro and Google Maps &ndash; 
click on the image for a full size screen shot.</em></p> 
<p>Adobe gripe &ndash; it&rsquo;s long overdue for <em>Bridge</em> to have a 
GPS map function when<em>Lightroom</em> does. As it happens I use <em>Media Pro
</em> for all my digital asset management. When this was Microsoft <em>
Expression Media 2</em> it has its own <em>Virtual Earth</em> window, but now 
it&rsquo;s been taken over by Phase One, that has been replaced by auto-opening 
a web browser<em>Google Earth</em> window. I don&rsquo;t really need to see 
maps at raw file stage, but it could help with filenames. I like my filenames 
to be a &lsquo;catchline&rsquo; format &ndash; an alphanumeric string which 
contains a key word about the subject. That could be simple like<em>
venice2011-15.jpg</em> or a bit more precise like <em>
guideccasangiorgiovenice2011-15.jpg</em>.</p> 
<p>Mouthful? Not ISO compliant? Not ancient PC friendly? Sure. But very useful 
indeed many years later when searching for stuff. And access to GPS map 
location helps me decide filenames, then later on input metadata for caption, 
keywords, description, and much more. With 15,000 finished images stored on my 
system everything which helps me identify them is valuable.</p> 
<p><strong>Image formats and styling</strong></p> 
<p>The Alpha 77 has a stack of great functions and features I will never use. 
That&rsquo;s because they are not available if you shoot either RAW or 
RAW+JPEG. They include multi-shot modes (combining tonal range for HDR, or 
reducing noise for low light and high ISO) and in-camera post processing 
effects.</p> 
<p>There are some of these JPEG-only modes I feel comfortable with. Panoramas, 
as an example, don&rsquo;t provide a raw file and you can&rsquo;t bracket 
exposures. You have to trust the camera despite the huge range of tones and 
light a wide panorama can cover. If you choose your start position well 
(including the brightest highlight area of importance) exposure is very 
reliable, and at low ISO with Fine quality, the JPEG is of a professional 
standard.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Standard JPEG (click images for 1000 pixel wide version)</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Three-shot HDR using 3EV spread</em></p> 
<p>Three-shot HDR also works well, especially at low ISO settings of 50 or 100 
and in Extra Fine JPEG. The 24 megapixel file gives plenty of scope for 
reducing to a smaller final result. There is also a special HDR Painting mode, 
which processes the file with a masking effect to create what is currently a 
popular &lsquo;look&rsquo;. Unlike the standard range of HDR settings, this is 
far from being a straight image and the lack of a raw file or normal JPEG to 
back it up means it&rsquo;s only for fun.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Over the top with HDR Painting style, High strength &ndash; it actually 
works best on dull, wet days with grungy subjects!</em></p> 
<p>More &lsquo;only for fun&rsquo; stuff includes soft focus, selective colour 
against mono (called &lsquo;Partial Color&rsquo;), toy camera, miniature 
effect, two monochrome looks including one which uses three exposures, 
&lsquo;pop color&rsquo;, posterization, retro photo, soft high key. All of 
these are irreversible real time post processing. You have no normal backup 
when shooting.</p> 
<p>The post-processing method offered by Nikon and others, where you can apply 
similar effects to raw or JPEG files already stored on your memory card and 
create a new version, is preferable. For standard HDR shots on Sony&rsquo;s 
current models, a normal JPEG is saved along with the three-shot HDR and 
that&rsquo;s good. For any of the Picture Effect post-processes, even 
multishot, no standard result is saved &ndash; all you get is the processed 
file, after a wait of 10 seconds or considerably less.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Selective yellow on monochrome &ndash; but that&rsquo;s the only shot I 
have. No raw, no standard JPEG&hellip;</em></p> 
<p>You do get a pretty accurate preview of the result in the EVF. If the 
stop-down preview button is set to &lsquo;Shot Preview&rsquo; mode instead of 
&lsquo;Aperture Preview&rsquo;, you also get a simulation of the effect of your 
shutter speed &ndash; so flowing water brief time exposures (up to 30 seconds) 
can be previewed to see exactly which shutter speed suits the water movement 
best. Along with exposure simulation, there should be no reason why your shot 
ever goes wrong.</p> 
<p>The Auto ISO Multi-Shot mode, Multi-Frame Noise Reduction, captures six 
frames and creates one JPEG. The pixel alignment seems very accurate and shots 
at settings like ISO 3200 show an improvement in detail which would be hard to 
obtain even by good raw processing. It&rsquo;s not so much the noise that is 
reduced, it&rsquo;s the overall quality of the image which improves. Using the 
high 25,600 ISO setting which can only be accessed in this mode shows that 
it&rsquo;s slightly inferior to a straight 16,000 ISO shot despite the 
six-frame synthesis.</p> 
<p>For all these multi-shot modes, the 12fps function of the Alpha 77, SSS, 
and the quiet, mirrorless shutter action combine well. They are all usable 
without much effort or worry, hand-held. The one &lsquo;tonal range&rsquo; 
adjustment which does operate in RAW+JPEG mode, though only the JPEG is 
changed, is the DRO or DRO+ setting which uses a single shot.</p> 
<p>High speed shooting also benefits exposure, DRO and white balance 
bracketing. Early information and the use manual state that you can define the 
number of exposures for bracketing, and the range covered, with the Alpha 65. 
In fact it is limited to three shots. The Alpha 77 gives you a choice of 3 
shots at +/-3EV, the same at 2EV, then 3 or 5 shots at 0.7, 0.5 or 0.3 EV 
intervals. It is missing the obvious 1 EV step choices and that will baffle 
many, especially HDR raw users who would like 5 shots at 1 EV intervals.</p> 
<p><strong>Flash</strong></p> 
<p>The Alpha 77 has a proper, threaded, high grade studio flash sync terminal 
as well as the usual Minolta i-type hot shoe. Like the Alpha 700 and 900 (and 
unlike the consumer level cameras, including the Alpha 580) it can have the 
HVL-F58AM or 43AM wireless control capable flash mounted on the camera to 
control group/channel wireless strobes with power ratio. It can also use HSS 
(burst flash with shutter speeds up to 1/8,000th and corresponding power 
attenuation). It can not officially use the HVL-F20AM as a wireless controller, 
but owners have found it works &ndash; with a slightly longer than normal delay 
in flash firing, according to Gary Friedman, who has compared it with the 
pop-up flash wireless control.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>The flash sync Prontor-Compur coaxial connector (PC flash socket) is 
sealed behind a cover shared with the Remote Release socket. This cover was so 
tightly sealed it threateed to break a fingernail opening it the first time, a 
small screwdriver was needed.</em></p> 
<p>The most important change for professional and enthusiast owners is the 
long-overdue addition of a menu item which prevents the EVF or LCD live view 
from showing actual exposure when Manual aperture and shutter are set.&nbsp; 
This item is under Live View Display, and is called &lsquo;Setting 
Effect&rsquo; &ndash; off or on. While this nomenclature is not exactly 
transparent, it describes the function well as all picture styles and creative 
effects normally shown in the finder are also bypassed. The important thing for 
studio flash users is that you can set 1/125 at f/16 with modelling lights, and 
see a normal finder view not a black hole. You still must remember to set white 
balance to Flash or Daylight, otherwise the camera will set it from the 
modelling light K.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It is best to use one of the three Memory registers (accessible through 
Menu screen after turning the Mode dial to MR, Memory Recall or Register) to 
store a manual exposure, fixed WB, low ISO, Setting Effect OFF preset for 
studio work. Then you can return to any other setting and get your accurate 
exposure and &lsquo;look&rsquo; preview back again.</p> 
<p>The internal pop-up flash (GN12) has the usual range of first, second 
curtain, fill-in, off, auto options; TTL Pre-Flash, ADI, and also manual power 
control down to 1/16th which can be useful for triggering slave flashes if you 
don&rsquo;t have a cable or a wireless trigger (and Minolta shoe adaptor). 
Because the body is weatherproofed, the flash shoe cover is a softer plastic 
type which seals tightly. Don&rsquo;t lose this shoe cover or swap it for one 
of your others.</p> 
<p><strong>And the rest</strong></p> 
<p>By the time I&rsquo;ve written this single review article, it will be 
one-third the length of the complete camera guide books we used to do for Hove 
twenty years ago. The Alpha 77 has so much more to discuss.</p> 
<p>You will be concerned about high ISO quality, diffraction, resolution, 
having good enough lenses. I would question whether the new 16-50mm, used wide 
open, is a &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; lens &ndash; let alone the 18-55mm SAM 
also being offered as a kit lens. Just don&rsquo;t worry. Whatever your 
existing lenses are capable of doing, the 24 megapixel sensor will give you 
more of it. Let&rsquo;s say your favourite lens is really only good up to 12 
megapixels. It will be just as good if you use the 12 megapixel Medium size 
JPEG option on the Alpha 77, and if you do that, the 1.4X Smart Teleconverter 
function will also deliver a 12 megapixel drawn from the centre of the field 
only &ndash; so most likely just as good.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Rather too distant heron, shot using the 2X Smart Converter for JPEGs 
(this is actually a clip from a raw file processed in aCR to match). ISO 3200, 
70-300mm SSM G lens. Click image for 1000 pixel version</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Click image for 1000 pixel 100% size clip from ACR processed version 
(my density choice)</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Click image for Capture One Pro 100% clip from raw (ditto)</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Click image for in-camera processed (JPEG Fine, Low level of NR) 100% 
clip (camera&rsquo;s density)</em></p> 
<p>I am now shooting with auto ISO set to go from 100 to 3200 instead of 1600, 
I have started using Medium and Small JPEGs with DRO+ to ensure exposure 
correction for events type shots, I&rsquo;ve tried all the lenses I have and 
the only thought is that I need to stick around f/8 to f/11 for safety. 
Balancing extra depth of field with a hint of diffraction loss. I&rsquo;m using 
the manual focus &lsquo;peaking&rsquo; function to check the accuracy of my AF 
(this shows a coloured line on correctly focused details, when the AF/MF button 
is pressed in). I am not so worried about low light, high ISO as I first 
thought. It&rsquo;s actually as good as the 16 megapixel sensor when needed, 
and when it&rsquo;s not, the extra resolution repays careful low ISO technique.
</p> 
<p>The new tilt, hinge, flip, swivel and cartwheel rear screen is just great 
for the few times I need to use it. The EVF may consume more power (470 images 
versus 530 per battery official rating) than the big rear screen but I no 
longer need to switch between the two for menu and function operations. Because 
of the new design, all positions found on other cameras from hanging-under to 
almost flat on top (R-1 style) are possible except facing forwards and 
positioned to the side. There are firmware or orientation sensor errors, as the 
imager can appear upside down in more than twisted position. The hinge design 
makes a vertical grip possible and also allows a wider range of tripods or 
quickmount plates.</p> 
<p>The A77 has all the focus and AE hold and lock, slow sync, focus point 
shift, exposure over-ride and other key functions I need. It claims to be 
weatherproof, and having nearly broken that thumnbnail off opening the flash 
sync cover&nbsp; I do believe the seal is tight. The card slot door is not so 
reassuring and I see no trace of any proper sealing, not even a labyrinth 
design.</p> 
<p>I am baffled by Sony&rsquo;s indecision about ON/OFF switch design, the 
camera labelling is the reverse of the Alpha 55/33/35 or 580/560 etc, though 
the action is the same. The direction is the reverse of the NEX-5. But there is 
one consistency, to turn any camera on the movement is always from left to 
right &ndash; whether Alpha 100, 700, 900 and whether the switch is rotary or a 
slider. Maybe this is the rule they stick to.</p> 
<p>You can not configure the directionality of the two control wheels, as you 
can with Nikon, and for some reason I have always tried to open or close the 
aperture by taking the wrong directione. That is because the wheel directions 
go against the old Minolta protocol that turning the aperture ring to the right 
opens up, turn to the left stops down.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Like the Alpha 700, the Alpha 77 has magnesium alloy body shell combined 
with other metal and plastic components. It has the proper strap-lug fixed into 
the mag alloy casting, like the 700 and 900. This lug and triangle-ring design, 
as opposed to the slot-type strap fixing of the lesser camera bodies, is always 
a clue that the structure is based on a good solid metal skeleton. The overall 
design and balance of the Alpha 77 are as good as any Alpha I&rsquo;ve used. 
There are hints of the 700 and also some memories of the Dynax 7xi present in 
the sculpturing of the body. To those who say it looks a bit like a Canon, yes, 
it&rsquo;s true that Canon design has caught up with 1990s Minolta style in the 
last couple of years&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p>From the initial press meeting with Sony, where cameras were prototypes and 
the images were not allowed to be shown, I decided that if I could work for a 
year with the Alpha 55 and have no problems then theAlpha 77 was a safe 
investment. The viewfinder is a pleasure to use, though EVFs differ from 
optical screens in one important respect, that the eye can not compensate for 
small errors in the dioptre setting. With an OVF like the Alpha 900, I can set 
the dioptre midway between what&rsquo;s needed for my sight with and without 
glasses, and get along fine with either. That can not be done with the EVF and 
it demands a precise dioptre setting for each. I have found it more comfortable 
to use without specs, so they spend too much time perched on my head, hanging 
from my collar or stuffed into a pocket.</p> 
<p>It will be another year before I know just how wise the decision to go with 
EVF SLT models has been. And maybe another ten thousand words.</p>

<p>I come from the Nikon D300 until the A77 cameout. One of the main features 
of the D300 was user custom settings. The a77 has 3. Also the Nikon D300 shoots 
up to 9 brackets for hdr the A77 shoots 5 but thats all i ever used anyways. 
What i find simply amazing is the speed of this camera. I like the Picture 
effects settings especially Rich tone Mono.<br>
 Someone needs to write a book 
for this camera but the Manual in PDF form comes in handy also i like the 
review David put forth as well.<br>
 So far the adjustable lcd screen. Image 
stabilizer and easibilty of controls and overall technology of the A77 blows 
everything out there out of the water even the Nikon D7000 which i traded for 
the D300.<br>
 PS i traded what i had for the Sony a77 and a sal 88 f2.8 lens.
<br> I own a 28-85 f3.5-4.5 lens and i prefer this lens on my camera the most 
but i use the teleconvertor built in as well.<br>
 After being hooked on RAW 
for so many years i don&rsquo;t see much difference processing in Lightroom 
with JPG format instead. I mean whats the difference i still have the same 
controls to use in lightroom</p> </li>

<p>Question: why is it that pressing the depth of field preview button 
eliminates magnification of the live view (or EVF) image? I&rsquo;d noticed 
this on the A55, which, as opposed to the A580, also has this 
&ldquo;feature.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s problematic, because the point of image 
magnification is to accurately manual focus, and this is just as needed in DOF 
preview as in straight focus.</p> 
<p>Contrast peaking provides a usually adequate alternative, but still this 
seems rather arbitrary behavior, and makes the DOF preview useless except for 
people with stupendous vision.</p> </li>

<p>Unfortunately , its not a limitation of pdaf (af only with f/3.5) &hellip; 
I thought it was too!<br>
 I had a55 and a65 , and sold them because of this 
&rdquo; limitation&rdquo;&hellip;..<br>
 But today i went to my local sonystore 
and tried a65 and a77 with older firmware 1.03 and the trick someone put in 
this forum&hellip; and it worked!<br>
 I could have manual speed and aperture 
with autofocus !<br>
 I tried with 2 lenses, the new sony 16-50 ssm f2.8 and 
sony 35mm 1.8<br>
 I did the trick , and i managed to shoot video , with 
aperture 1.8 and having autofocus.<br>
 It was very fast and accurate&hellip; 
So its not a limitation of pdaf but a limitation of sony.<br>
 I dont know why 
sony choosed to do this&hellip; I would like to buy a65 again, but if i do, i 
cant go to a newer firmware!<br>
 In the newer 1.04 it doesnt work&hellip;. So 
its a firmware problem&hellip;not hardware.</p> </li>

<p>Thank you David for the informative review. I am still trying to figure out 
the best settings for my A77. I shoot a lot of indoor ice-hockey, and have been 
a bit frustrated. I am shooting at ISO 1600-2500, 1/640 and a 2.8 aperture, 
using the Tamron 70-200 lens. I am getting good stop-action and lighting seems 
OK, buy my main trouble has been in capturing faces (through the helmet cage). 
Sometimes the person I am focusing on has a blurry face, but the people way 
behind him/her are clearer. I think my problem might be in the focus area. I am 
using spot metering mode, but am not sure what I should be using for the AF 
area. I am probably missing some other setting/trick as well. I would really 
appreciate any thoughts you have.</p> </li> 
<li> admin <br>

<p>First of all, the Tamron 70-200mm f/2.8 is not pin sharp at f/2.8 
especially on 24 megapixels. I tested this lens first on the Canon 50D (15 
megapixels) and it wasn&rsquo;t sharp wide open on that, but had a distinct 
slightly coloured, slightly coma-smeared halo to the detail. The Sigma also was 
not pin sharp, but instead of showing this artefact, just looked generally less 
sharp. The Sony/Minolta is very sharp centrally at 25ft or beyond wide open, 
but gets worse the closer you focus. I&rsquo;ve only found one lens recently 
which is truly sharp at f/2.8 and 200mm in this class, and that is the latest 
Nikon VR design. Canon hasn&rsquo;t managed to match it (quite). So even if you 
get perfect focus it may not as good as you want. The A77 has a micro AF 
adjustment and you absolutely MUST test the lens at the typical working 
distance, under the same lighting (this is important), at the focal length and 
aperture you use. There is a single AF adjustment for each lens, even for 
zooms. You will find that the Tamron probably needs a whole range of different 
AF adjustments to be perfect at f/2.8 &ndash; and you may simply have to 
remember these, or write them down, and set them for the conditions.</p> 
<p>For your sports shorts, the best option may be to turn off face detection 
and turn off object tracking. There are too many faces, moving too fast, and 
too many objects. Like Nikon&rsquo;s object tracking, the A77 will identify 
large brightly coloured shapes &ndash; such as a solid colour shirt &ndash; and 
your main subject may be wearing something more complex. Select the three-zone 
focus option, not Wide Area and not Spot or Local. This will give you best 
transfer of a focused point between the three zones, but they are all 
relatively central. It will normally prefer foreground to background, so your 
main danger is a player moving in front, but like Nikon it does not react 
immediately and if the movement in front is fast, the focus will not shift.</p> 
<p><br>
 Above is a full frame of an action shot with Sigma 70-300mm OS lens, 
70mm, f/8, A77, ISO 800, 1/1250th. My final version of this shot is not saved 
to 24 megapixels, I use the 17.5 megapixel export option in Adobe Camera Raw 
for a 50MB finished image as I find this small reduction improves the 
noise/sharpness significantly.</p> 
<p><br>
 This is a 100% pixel level clip showing how the lens and AF have 
correctly targeted the subject which I placed exactly centrally here, but other 
frames use the outer sensors and all have held focus well. The background and a 
combination of leaping dolphins and water have not shifted the focus. But 
getting the lettering on the child&rsquo;s lifejacket sharp probably would not 
have worked in lower light &ndash; certainly, higher than ISO 800 begins to 
lose fine detail on the A77, and wider than f/8 begins to get softer on this 
lens.</p> 
<p>I think you have an almost impossible problem with the light level as you 
really need ISO 6400 to get something like f/5.6 and 1/1000th.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your reply. It was informative, but not particularily 
encouraging. What camera/lens combo would you recommend for hockey photography?
</p> </li> 
<li> admin <br>
 December 7, 2011 at 12:07 am <br>

<p>Steph, when you are faced with 1/640th at f/2.8 and you are already at ISO 
2500, you&rsquo;ve really got a light level too low to guarantee perfect shots 
every time at the 200mm end. There&rsquo;s only one affordable camera made 
which can really do this &ndash; the Nikon D700 with 12 megapixel full frame 
sensor, and the Nikon VR 70-200mm f/2.8. Canon&rsquo;s 1D MkIV is better but in 
an entirely different price bracket.</p> 
<p>The simple fact is that the Nikon only has 5 megapixels when cropped to 
APS-C otherwise it would need a 300mm f/2.8 to match your setup! If you set 
your A77 to shoot Extra Fine JPEG and use the Small file size (6 megapixels) 
you will actually be getting, detail for detail, exactly as good an image as 
the D700/D3S can produce &ndash; and at that setting, you can use 6400 ISO if 
you want and it will look OK.</p> 
<p>If you want 12 megapixels to match the Nikon D700 full frame results, just 
set your lens to a maximum focal length of 135mm and never go longer, and use 
Medium size Extra Fine JPEG.</p> 
<p>Even better, continue to shoot just like you do but abandon the zoom lens. 
Shoot at ISO 1600 and get a Sigma 85mm f/1.4 or if you can afford it, a Sony CZ 
85mm f/1.4. This lens would actually give you as much pixel-level detail of a 
player as a Nikon D700 used with a 70-200mm lens set to 200mm, on your A77. 
Instead of using the full frame, crop. Crop any size you want, from 6 to 24 
megapixels. Forget about zooming, concentrate on framing, Use f/2 if you like! 
The lens will not only be sharper than the Tamron wide open, it will focus 
faster.</p> 
<p>In other words, you are not really at a disadvantage over the best semi-pro 
rig currently made for indoor sports, the D700/70-200mm VR. You are just using 
a camera with twice the sharpness crammed into half the image area. 
You&rsquo;ve got loads of pixels to play with for cropping and using a zoom 
lens is far less important. You can swap your bulky zoom for a truly fantastic 
ultra-fast portrait length lens and solve the problem.</p>
