<h1>Quick Review: Yongnuo YN468-II Speedlight for Nikon</h1> 
<p>by Andy Hendriksen on March 24, 2012</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Yongnuo, a company out of Hong Kong, has become well known for making 
pretty darn good speedlight alternatives to Canon or Nikon. They&rsquo;re 
generally several hundred dollars less expensive, and often just as good.They 
recently announced a couple new models, and I immediately ordered the very one 
I&rsquo;ve been waiting for them to make:the YN468-II for Nikon.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For some time, Yongnuo flashes weren&rsquo;t compatible with DSLR&rsquo;s 
TTL metering systems, which meant you needed to use them in manual mode. Not a 
big deal, but can be an absolute hassle at times. They have now implemented TTL 
into both their Canon and Nikon flash units, and this YN468-II is the first of 
this series to support Nikon&rsquo;s iTTL.&nbsp;The iTTL implementation works 
flawlessly, and my shots came out perfectly exposed every time. It also 
incorporates an improved laser-based system for autofocus assist, which worked 
very well in low light and consistently allowed myD7000 to focus when it 
otherwise couldn&rsquo;t quite figure it out. The flash will also automatically 
zoom between 24mm and 85mm based on the focal length of the lens attached to 
your camera.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For a flash that costs just a hair over $100, you&rsquo;d expect an awfully 
shoddy build. Fortunately, that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the case here. 
The speedlight feels incredibly solid in the hand, and is made with very nice 
feeling plastics. It doesn&rsquo;t have any latches that lock it into a 
position, but the clicks feel very solid and I have no concern about them 
wearing out over time. Build quality is certainly on par with Nikon and 
Canon&rsquo;s offerings.</p> 
<p>Yongnuo claims that the YN468-II has upgraded buttons, with a more solid 
click feel. While I haven&rsquo;t felt the original, I will say that these feel 
great, and are right in line with the quality of Nikon&rsquo;s own speedlights.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The packaging is basic, but very Nikon-like in it&rsquo;s gold and black 
glory. It comes with the speedlight in a velvet pouch, along with a snap-on 
diffuser and a tabletop stand. Triggering the flash as a slave worked 
perfectly, and I experienced no misfires or any issues at all.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The recycle speed is relatively quick, and with fresh batteries, it 
consistently from full power in under 4 seconds. Not blazing fast by any means, 
but quick enough for most scenarios. Considering how incredibly powerful this 
speedlight is at full power, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed that it&rsquo;s even 
that fast.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not a big flash user, and I almost always prefer available light 
for my work, but occasionally you need one to do the job, and the Yongnuo 
YN468-II far exceeds what it&rsquo;s price would lead you to believe. I wish 
there was more to say about this thing, but it really is just a great unit for 
an almost unbelievable price.</p> 
<p>Yongnuo is currently selling the YN468-II on Amazon for $109.95, and 
considering that&rsquo;s $200 less than you&rsquo;ll pay for Nikon&rsquo;s 
cheapest speedlight, theSB&ndash;700, I really don&rsquo;t think you can go 
wrong.</p>
