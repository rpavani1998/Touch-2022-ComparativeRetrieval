<h1>A Nikon Shooter&rsquo;s Canon Sessions (op/Ed)</h1> 
<p>by Gevon Servo on December 8, 2011</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>The Canon EOS 7D&nbsp;is&nbsp;the most interesting Canon camera to me. I am 
approaching the camera as aNikon shooter. While my Nikon D90 was in for repair 
I was loaned the Canon 7D by the one the only Chris Gampat. The effect of the 
camera on me was mind blowing especially with theCanon 35mm f1.4 and the Canon 
50mm f1.4. These two lenses were selected because they fall in line with my 
shooting style and fondness for prime lenses.&nbsp; The seven days I spent with 
this gear were phenomenal and educational all at the same time.</p> 
<p></p>

<h2>&nbsp;On the 7D from a Nikon shooters perspective</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The camera has great form and function. It was reviewed here some time ago. 
The EOS 7D, while not as new as other equipment out there, is a refined beast. 
Compared to the Nikon D90, theD7000, D300, and the D700 (my preferred camera 
bodies) the camera is a complete joy to hold. Shooting with the 7D was so good 
and so refreshing and made me feel right at home. The weight, while heavier 
than D90 was nice and reminded me of the D300 and the D700.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The controls made me feel like right handed person using a left handed 
person&rsquo;s guitar, but they were intuitive enough to get the hang of 
quickly. The buttons were felt like they were in weird places. However, they 
were easy to figure out once I took a second to look over everything. Finding 
the shutter, aperture, exposure compensation, and ISO eventually become second 
nature. The Canon 7D&rsquo;s AF, with its 19 points was nice, quick, and 
precise. The metering worked great. I understand why people like this camera so 
much.</p> 
<h2>On My Subjects</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>I chose to take this out on completely random shooting schedule with some 
coffee photography sprinkled in. The 35mm f1.4 and the 50mm f1.4 were perfect 
for coffee photography. Paired with the 7D, the camera gave my images a great 
softness when shot wide open and the colors were rendered very well.</p> 
<h2>Who is This Camera For in My View?</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Well this is not a camera for beginners. Rather, this is a camera for a 
slightly seasoned photographer. I don&rsquo;t think I would have appreciated 
this camera as much three years ago. If I was not so invested in Nikon I would 
consider switching to this camera or its eventual successor. This camera would 
work well in pretty much any style of photography.</p> 
<h2>On Canon vs Nikon vs &hellip;.</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The whole brand battle is marketing silliness. The cameras (no matter what 
brand), for all intents and purposes, take fantastic images if used correctly. 
It is a piece of equipment there to help explain visually: textures, 
structures, living forms, explosion, eruptions, the earth itself. We can see 
and capture all these things though these things that are our cameras. 
Photographers must find which cameras they are most comfortable with, that is 
all.</p> 
<p>The Canon 7D has been added to the long list of cameras I have had the 
honor of playing with here on the Phoblographer and the images are produced 
&rsquo;with the camera by me&rsquo;, not &lsquo;by the camera&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>I have not liked every camera I&rsquo;ve tested. However if I did not have 
and understanding of photography fundamentals, I would not be able to use most 
of them at all. The Canon 7D was nice piece of gear I would actually consider 
buying at some point.</p>

<p>Well it is nice to see an article emphasizing on the skills of the 
photographer instead of on the gear. Normally any Nikon vs Canon is pretty 
heated and for no reason. I totally agree agree with you: A skilled 
photographer can produce excellent picture regardless of the brand of the 
camera.</p> </li>
