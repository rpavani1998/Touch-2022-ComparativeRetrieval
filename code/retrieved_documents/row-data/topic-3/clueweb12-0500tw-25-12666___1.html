<p>This keeps happening every few years. I have a feeling that Nikon and Canon 
secretly discuss amongst themselves as to who will lead the professional pack 
for the next few years.</p> 
<p>This post is a quick comparison between the latest Nikon and Canon 
full-frame digital SLRs. But first, a quick question-</p> 
<p>Q- Which one of them will make you take better pictures?<br>
 A- Neither.
</p> 
<p>Cameras in this bracket have virtually identical image quality (IQ). The 
differences are more for their handling and features over and above great IQ. 
Any further difference in pictures- almost always- is because of the person 
using it, and not the camera.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>FX vs DX</strong></p> 
<p>Over the past few years, Canon has absolutely dominated the full-frame 
digital SLR market. A full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical 
dimensions as 35mm film. Most consumer dSLRs have smaller sensors, called APS-C 
sensors (25mm x 16mm, which stands for Advanced Photo System type-Classic). 
Full-frame cameras, by virtue of their large sensors, have much better 
low-light performance, color rendition, dynamic range (the range of levels it 
can show between highlight and shadow) than their APS-C cousins. Basically most 
of the reasons why you choose a dSLR over a pocket point-and-shoot. You also 
tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than 
on an APS-C camera. Full-frames tend to be heavier, and much more expensive 
(around twice or more) than their smaller frame counterparts.</p> 
<p>Canon&rsquo;s full-frame dSLR- called the 5D Mark2- till <strong>yesterday
</strong> was by far the most popular full-frame camera. It had great video 
shooting capabilities- something that its competitor- the Nikon D700 completely 
lacked; a higher megapixel sensor, and was overall lighter than the D700. The 
D700 did have a superior autofocus (AF) system, but that was really about it.
</p> 
<p>Last month, Nikon came back roaring to release the D800. A 36 megapixel 
imaging monster, this camera delivers almost every conceivable video option and 
then some. Tonight, Canon will release their next iteration- the 5D Mark III. 
The information presented here is not official Canon information, but a very 
reliable leak a few hours before the actual announcement.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Nikon D800</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nikon calls it a &ldquo;HD-DSLR&rdquo;, for high definition DSLR. 
It&rsquo;s specifications list is quite impressive:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>36.3 Megapixel</strong> full frame CMOS sensor.</li> 
<li><strong>ISO 100-6400</strong> (expandable to Lo1: 50, Hi2: 25600).</li> 
<li>Full HD 1080 movie, including raw HD output over HDMI.</li> 
<li><strong>51 point autofocus</strong> with 15 cross-type sensors.</li> 
<li>New AF module capable of focusing at low light down to -2EV.</li> 
<li><strong>4.0 frames per second</strong> continuous shooting. 5 fps with 
battery grip, 6 fps in DX mode.</li> 
<li>100% viewfinder coverage.</li> 
<li>3.2&Prime; rear LCD.</li> 
<li>Shutter durability of 200,000 cycles.</li> 
<li>Quiet shooting mode.</li> 
<li>Dual (CF and SD) card slots.</li> 
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode which combines multiple exposures upto +/- 
3EV apart.</li> 
<li><strong>Improved metering</strong> which allows better scene recognition, 
including face detection.</li> 
<li>Improved weather sealing and durable magnesium alloy construction.</li> 
<li><strong>Price: $3,000.</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Canon 5D Mark III</strong></p> 
<p>Not to be outdone, here comes Canon&rsquo;s 5D Mark III (as yet unreleased):
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What is inside is equally as impressive:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>22.3 Megapixel</strong> full frame CMOS sensor.</li> 
<li><strong>ISO 100-25600</strong> (expandable L: 50 to H2: 102400).</li> 
<li>Full HD 1080 movie.</li> 
<li><strong>61 point autofocus</strong>, up to 41 cross type sensors.</li> 
<li><strong>6.0 frames per second</strong> continuous shooting.</li> 
<li>100% viewfinder coverage.</li> 
<li>3.2&Prime; rear LCD.</li> 
<li>Shutter durability of 150,000 cycles.</li> 
<li>Silent and low vibration shooting modes.</li> 
<li>Dual (CF and SD) card slots.</li> 
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode.</li> 
<li>Multiple exposures.</li> 
<li>Improved durability, water and dust resistance.</li> 
<li><strong>Price (rumored): $3,500.</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A few observations about the 5DM3&prime;s design (based solely on the 
leaked pictures):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Canon has finally fixed the position of the on/off switch from near the 
back lower right of the LCD to the top of the camera, behind the main mode 
selector. This makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera 
and shooting.</li> 
<li>The &lsquo;Menu and Info buttons have moved up from their previous 
positions to the left of the viewfinder. There is a new &lsquo;Rate&rsquo; 
button, second from top in the row of buttons on the left side of the LCD.</li> 
<li>A new &lsquo;Start/Stop&rsquo; button has been added to the right side of 
the viewfinder. This seems to be a dedicated video recording button. There is 
also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel 
and joystick at the back.</li> 
<li>The top adds a &lsquo;M-Fn&rsquo; button (multi-function? depth of field 
preview?) button close to the shutter release. Apart from that, the top bank of 
buttons near the top LCD are the same.</li> 
<li>An additional button added to the front, at approximately 8 o&rsquo;clock 
when the mount is viewed from the front. This may be a dedicated depth of field 
preview button.</li> 
<li>The &lsquo;EOS 5D&rsquo; badge is more 7D like.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My comparison of the feature set of these two photography stalwarts coming 
up.</p> 40.714353 -74.005973 <br>
