<h2><b>Canon 20D DSLR Review<br>
</b></h2> <br>
<em>Fourth time is a charm... 
</em><em><strong><br>
</strong> </em> 
<p><em>Why the delay in this review? Mea culpa, mea culpa. I started using the 
20D back in early fall of 2004 and had formed a pretty good impression of the 
camera by the end of the year. I'd even written most of this review by then. At 
the time I started using the 20D I was considering writing Canon eBooks similar 
to my Nikon ones. Then Nikon conspired to launch four new cameras in a short 
period of time (plus the Fujifilm S3 Pro had arrived), which put me in a 
testing and writing time crunch. This review got put aside for awhile as a 
result.</em></p> 
<p><em>While I realize that there are some folk out there that would love to 
have me switch to Canon, this site is, after all, a Nikon-based site first and 
foremost, thus when needed, I divert all my attention to new Nikon products. I 
actually would have published the 20D review as it stood back in January but 
for one thing: I really wanted to take a closer look at the autofocus issue I 
point out to make sure it wasn't my inexperience with the Canon autofocus 
system that I was seeing. I didn't get the time to do that until late in the 
summer of 2005.</em></p> 
<p><em>So, mea culpa. Yes, this review is late. But I'd rather have it 
accurately reflect my thoughts. As to further Canon support from me, I'd have 
to say it's unlikely that I'll do more than review the occasional camera. I 
will continue to purchase and use various Canon DSLRs from time to time so that 
I can better understand the differences faced with someone thinking about 
purchasing a new state-of-the-art DSLR, but it's unlikely that I'll write an 
eBook on those products. I suppose that if I had a full publishing staff behind 
me I might have the time to research and write more Canon info, but I don't. 
I'm a one-man band, and I've decided to concentrate on a single set of 
instruments.</em></p> 
<h4>The Basics</h4> 
<p>Well, I've dipped another toe into the Canon pool. The competition between 
Canon and Nikon in DSLR bodies is important for both companies, as they each 
are pressing the other towards better digital SLR cameras, more so than any 
other company or factor. Indeed, there's been an interesting leapfrog effect 
going on between the two companies, so understanding the 20D tells you 
something about where the Nikon's D100 DSLR replacement might end up. </p>
<p>The Canon 20D represents the fourth re-design of the Canon consumer DSLR (I 
consider the Digital Rebel to be a derivative of the 10D). Back in May 2000 we 
had the 3.1mp D30 at an initial price of about US$3000. In February 2002 came 
the 6mp D60 at an initial price of about US$2100. In February 2003 came the 6mp 
10D at an initial price of about US$1500. And in September 2004 came the 8.2mp 
20D at that same price point. If you look carefully at that progression, it's 
clear that Canon has put a lot of work into a very short period of time. 
Besides the obvious improvements in sensors and lowering of price, the bodies 
themselves and things like the autofocus system have been constantly worked on 
and tweaked. </p>
<p>In traditional Canon consumer fashion, the 20D is a light, smallish body 
(certainly when compared to the 1D and 1Ds), and a bit oriented towards 
all-automatic shooting. Unlike previous Canon consumer DSLRs, the 20D seems 
much more &quot;finished&quot; and polished. Perhaps its the simple touch of 
adding a rubberized grip, but the overall impression is of a higher build 
quality than, say, the 10D. There are still some jarring edges (like opening 
the compact flash card slot immediately turns off the power to the camera), but 
overall the impression is that Canon has paid excellent attention to detail. 
</p>
<p>Most people asking me about the 20D ask about it in comparison to the Nikon 
D70s, so here's a short table of some of the primary features (pink is better; 
if both are purple I judge the differences to be minimal): </p> <i><b>Canon 20D

<br> <br>

<p>Both cameras have: Bracketing, built-in flash, a variety of JPEG recording 
sizes and qualities, the regular exposure modes plus scene modes, a hot shoe, a 
menu and playback system that uses the color LCD, and a host of other features. 
Effectively, they are very similar cameras in the gross specifications, with 
the three big pluses for the 20D being faster frame advance, wider autofocus 
area, and that extra two megapixels. More on this as we get into the details. 
</p>
<p>You get Program, Shutter-priority (Tv in Canon parlance), Aperture-priority 
(Av), and Manual exposure modes plus a faux Automatic depth of field mode; 
seven scene modes (Everything Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Close-up, Sports, 
Night Portrait, and Flash Off); diopter adjustments for the viewfinder; a 
wealth of useful information in the viewfinder (though no frame counter); 
excellent, though not-quite-state-of-the-art autofocus; 36-segment matrix, and 
centerweighted (Canon doesn't specify weighting in the manual, which I find 
problematic for users who like to understand and control their equipment) 
metering; exposure compensation and three shot auto bracketing; and depth of 
field preview. </p>
<p>Reading the feature list of the 20D, you might wonder if Canon left 
anything out. The big missing piece is true spot metering. Flash abilities, 
though much improved over the first of Canon's consumer offerings, still seem a 
bit lacking; I would have liked to have the ability to turn the on-board flash 
into a controller for remote wireless TTL, ala the D70s. I'm also a little 
surprised that there's no built-in intervalometer function. Given the advanced 
amateur target of the camera, it seems like there are a few feature ommissions, 
though none that cripple the camera. </p>
<p>One issue of significance to a few users might be the 1.6x angle of view 
change versus the D70's 1.5x. Canon is now producing a series of EF-S lenses to 
help with the reduced angle of view, but true wide angle aficionados will find 
themselves taking a hard look at third-party solutions such as Sigma's 12-24mm 
or 10-20mm. The 17-85mm EF-S that sells as a kit with some 20D packages is a 
decent lens, but that gives us only a 27mm equivalency. The new 10-22mm Canon 
EF-S lens isn't what I'd call distinguished in ability, but finally gets Canon 
into the right focal length range for serious wide angle work. I'm sure that 
Canon will produce more EF-S lenses as time moves on, but right now I'd have to 
say that not only does Nikon have more DX lenses, but the wide angle 
capabilities of those DX lenses are arguably better than what I've seen from 
Canon's first efforts. For example, while the Canon 17-85mm EF-S includes IS, 
it also isn't optically as strong at the wide end as Nikon's less expensive 
18-70mm DX lens (the D70s kit lens). Nor does Canon have anything close to the 
equivalent of the 18-200mm VR DX Nikon recently introduced. If you're thinking 
of the 20D as a serious landscape camera, make sure that you consider both the 
wide angle lens you'll be using, but also some of the other factors I point 
out, such as the acuity. The 20D doesn't automatically win a contest with the 
D70s in landscape shooting. </p>
<p>Overall, the feature set of the 20D is quite good, though like a lot of the 
Canon consumer bodies it doesn't try to win the game on feature set 
completeness (Minolta was perhaps best known for that tactic).</p> 
<p></p> 
<h4>Handling</h4> 
<p>While most people look at the 8mp sensor as the &quot;big&quot; improvement 
the 20D provides over its predecessors, I don't. In my opinion the largest 
improvement over previous Canon DSLRs simply comes in feel and build quality. 
Most of the rough edges in UI design and seemingly unfinished body pieces that 
originally appeared on the D30 are all gone now. I've played with a lot of 
Canon consumer bodies over the years, and helped workshop students with trying 
to get the most out of them, but the 20D is the first I've encountered that has 
no significant flaw somewhere in its design. </p>
<p>That's not to say the 20D is perfect, but this is by far the best consumer 
DSLR Canon has produced in the handling department. My remaining gripes will be 
minor and don't get in the way of taking pictures, for the most part. The one 
exception is that compact flash compartment door. If you dislodge the door into 
the open position, the camera shuts off, no matter what it was doing. 
Fortunately, it's a little difficult to open the door, but it can be done with 
gloves on without you at first noticing. </p>
<p>The first thing you notice about the 20D is its heft and feel. While it's 
not a heavy camera, it'll be a shock to you if the last body you picked up was 
a consumer film SLR, even though the weight difference isn't all that much on a 
scale. Personally, a pound-and-a-half (685g) is what I find to be a nice 
comfortable point; the camera isn't so light that it gets easily 
&quot;yanked&quot; when pressing the shutter release, but it's also not so 
heavy that it is fatiguing to hold for long periods. The 20D's weight is backed 
up by an impression that no body part is flimsy or unprotected (the ON/OFF 
switch, for example is slightly indented so that it can't easily be bumped out 
of its position and isn't likely to snag on something). </p>
<p>Another new item (for Canon) that's immediately noticeable is that there's 
a rubberized grip material added to the areas where you right hand tends to 
grab the camera. This gives the 20D a more professional, textile feel that the 
D30 through 10D didn't have. Let's just hope that Canon's method of attaching 
these rubber grips works better than some of the Nikon models that have sported 
rubber. Nevertheless, the new grip material makes the 20D much more comfortable 
to hold for long periods, so I welcome the change, even if I someday may find I 
have to reglue it. (I guess I'd better explain that remark: on my sample, there 
are two corners where the rubberized material feels vulnerable to getting 
lifted by either constant movement over it or by accidentally hooking on 
something--remember, I work in the bush more often than not, so things do poke 
at my cameras all the time.) </p>
<p>Long-time Canon users won't have any trouble recognizing the controls for 
the 20D, as we still have the dual wheel concept being used as the design 
foundation. In this case, the rear dial that lays flat on the back to the right 
of the color LCD has a feel much better than I remember on any previous Canon 
consumer camera. The five major control buttons (three in front of the top LCD, 
two on the upper right back) are still all there and still have dual 
personalities. In the case of the top three buttons, I continue to have a 
problem with the fact that they all have exactly the same feel. That's not a 
big issue, since the only one of those buttons that can effectively be changed 
while your eye is at the viewfinder is the rightmost one, and then only for 
exposure compensation, but I'd still like that right button to be immediately 
identifiable by feel--even a small cross-hatching on it would make it simple to 
distinguish. With gloves on, I'd double this request--you can actually mistake 
the backlight button for the AF/WB button with gloves on. </p>
<p>Because AF type, white balance, metering method, frame advance, and ISO 
indicators aren't in the viewfinder, five of the six functions of those top 
three UI buttons just simply can't be done while looking through the 
viewfinder. This is acceptable on a consumer DSLR, though I really think we 
should get more than &quot;acceptable&quot; on a camera of this caliber. If 
you've used a previous Canon DSLR, you're probably not even going to notice 
that, though. Overall, the 20D is enough like the 10D or D60 or Digital Rebel 
in control design that you could move to it and not be really struck by any 
difference in handling. </p>
<p>Except for one thing, that is. There's a new control on the back of the 
20D: a small, joystick type controller that sits above the big control wheel. 
This 8-way controller (which can also be pressed as a button in some actions) 
has three primary uses on the camera: it allows you to pick the autofocus 
sensor, it helps you navigate an image that's magnified on the color LCD, and 
it allows you to directly control the two-axis white balance adjustment system. 
To a Nikon user, it seems a bit awkward in actual use for autofocus though. 
Basically, you have to hit the AF point selector button<em>and then</em> move 
the joystick controller to select a particular autofocus point. Since you're 
likely to be using your right thumb for both these actions, this makes for a 
two-step process that's too slow for quick moving action. Here's how Canon<em>
should have</em> implemented it: press the joystick in to activate focus 
selection and move it to select a point; your thumb wouldn't move and you can 
do this much faster and reliably. Likewise, I don't understand why the joystick 
controller doesn't work for navigating images in 9-at-a-time mode. </p>
<p>Still, having the joystick controller available for a number of actions 
does rid the interface of one thing that I've found annoying in the past: 
having to use the wheel to scroll through things when a more direct approach 
would have been appreciated. You'll find it useful; just not quite as useful as 
it could be. </p>
<p>In the hand, the 20D is quite comfortable and balanced. Hand placement is 
quite good and the controls can be operated with modest gloves on. Even though 
the right grip extension is quite pronounced, it fits a small hand well, and 
the slight contouring makes it easy to hold the camera with one hand (not that 
I recommend shooting that way!). </p> 
<p>Some of the control placements may make the camera feel a bit uncomfortable 
to someone who has large hands or long fingers. Two controls that you tend to 
use more often--the exposure lock and autofocus point selector buttons--tend to 
force you to give up some of your grip on the camera to operate (you end up 
gripping the front of the camera mostly with the tips of your fingers with no 
thumb support). This is something big handed folk will find slightly more 
daunting than those with smaller digits. I'd say the 20D, like other consumer 
Canon DSLRs, is a body that best fits smallish hands; at least those folk won't 
feel contorted when using common controls. </p>
<p>A dial on the left top plate is used to set the camera's exposure mode (and 
the special scene modes). This dial is clearly labeled and easy enough to use. 
The scene modes restrict what other things you can set, but, like Nikon's scene 
modes, don't go far enough for me to make them useful. None of them really do 
anything particularly useful, in my opinion. The Automatic Depth of Field mode, 
while intriguing in principal, turns out to be rather limited in actual 
practice (and appears to be calculated from a circle of confusion of closer to 
0.035, which is far too lax for a small sensor body [for the 20D, I'd use 
0.015]).</p> 
<p>Program exposure mode can be overridden (Nikon calls this Flexible Program 
for those of you trying to make direct comparisons). Unlike the D70s, where 
each dial turn gives you the next 1/3 stop alternative, the 20D does a very 
strange thing: it gives you a third of a stop alternative followed by a 2/3 
stop alternative--every other 1/3 stop possibility is missing! It's as if they 
do a 1/2 stop change and then round to the nearest third of a stop setting. 
Given the other manual control on this camera, I would have liked to be a 
little more firmly in control of the Program overrides.</p> 
<p>Manual exposure mode works like this: the dial on the top plate controls 
the shutter speed and the rear wheel control the aperture (just the opposite of 
the Nikon default, where front controls aperture and rear controls shutter 
speed).</p> 
<p>ISO and White Balance settings can be quickly changed without going to the 
menu system if nothing is being displayed on the color LCD. Press the 
appropriate button, twirl the dial on the top plate to get to the value you 
want (shown on the second LCD on the back), then press the button again.</p> 
<p>The histogram display is still sub-optimal, in my opinion, and I'm a little 
irked that Canon hasn't gotten around to fixing it on their consumer DSLRs. 
It's too small and sometimes difficult to distinguish what's happening at the 
highlight extreme, which is exactly where we want to see the most information. 
The screen that shows the histogram just tries to do too much, in my opinion. 
The D70s has Nikon's usual large, easily visible histogram--you only have to 
see the two side by side to see how inferior the 20D's histogram is. Moreover, 
I really want to see the color channels, as well, which neither Nikon nor Canon 
is giving us yet on consumer bodies.</p> 
<p>Custom white balance is obtained by taking a regular photo of a centered, 
neutral object, then going back and pointing the camera at that photo. Not only 
does this (temporarily) waste storage space, but it makes for a slightly slower 
than usual custom setting procedure (not that Nikon has always done right by 
this--the D100's custom white balance procedure is a bit labyrinthine; the D70s 
is better in this respect, and supports a better and faster measuring method 
[if you remember to press the button twice] plus the same &quot;set from 
photograph&quot; option the 20D does). On the plus side, on the 20D you can 
directly set Kelvin temps and make CIE space corrections to white balance using 
the joystick controller. Both of these things are functions I wish the Nikon 
consumer bodies had.</p> 
<p>Surprisingly, image controls such as contrast, sharpness, saturation, and 
color tone are somewhat buried in the menu system under something called 
Parameters. (Nikon buries them on their consumer cameras under Optimize Image.) 
The good news is that you can define your own sets (3) for multiple image 
controls, plus there's a black and white capability built into the camera 
hidden here, too. Nice ability, but a bit buried in the menu system.</p> 
<p>Continuous motor drive and the self timer are available via a separate 
button on the top plate, which is simpler than on most Nikon bodies, which 
often require a two-step process, but bracketing, Image Quality, Image Size, 
and a few other functions are only accessible through the menu system on the 
20D. Fortunately, the menu system has been streamlined a bit from previous 
models and is easy to learn and use. Other than a few odd choices of words 
(such as Parameters, which is a vague noun), the menu system is mostly clear, 
consistent, and quick in actual use. The one place I'd say that isn't true is 
in the Custom Functions area, where Canon forces you to drop down a level to 
see what the other options are for a setting while wasting half the display 
with a summary of<em>all</em> the Custom Function values (as numbers, which 
won't mean anything to you until you've memorized them).</p> 
<p>The 20D takes two types of lenses: the traditional EF mount lenses, and new 
EF-S mount lenses. The two kit lenses that are available (and other EF-S 
lenses) mount at a different point (white indicator instead of the usual red). 
Canon did it this way apparently because the EF-S lenses stick a bit further 
back into the camera than do EF lenses, and Canon didn't want people sticking 
EF-S lenses onto cameras that don't support them, as the rear elements might 
interfere with the action of the mirror. (I'm actually a bit curious about 
that. Other digital lens designers are all trying to move rear exit pupils 
forward away from the sensor and using a rear grouping that doesn't modify the 
light path; Canon seems to be designing differently.)</p> 
<p>Previously Canon consumer DSLRs have had a serious slow-to-wake quality to 
them, but the 20D mostly breaks that habit. You can leave the power switch at 
the ON position and not significantly drain the battery while the camera is 
inactive. What you can't do is press, say, the Menu button and have the camera 
immediately awake (you have to partially press the shutter release first). I've 
left my 20D powered on for several days at a time between shooting sessions and 
appreciate the fact that I can simply just pick up the camera and shoot. One 
slight bauble: you need to press the shutter release partway to wake up the 
body--most other buttons won't wake the camera [the recently released 5D fixes 
this, by the way].</p> 
<p>Overall, handling is very good to excellent on the 20D. If you're coming 
from another Canon body, you'll find yourself right at home and the new and 
subtle improvements will be immediately welcome. If you're coming from a Nikon 
body, you'll be less befuddled than before and probably settle into the 
differences quickly.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h4>Performance</h4> 
<h4>Exposure</h4> 
<p>The 20D matrix meter is pretty good at tough scenes, though I find it has a 
clear tendency to blow out highlight detail more than most of the Nikon matrix 
meters do (the recent D50 being the exception). That said, I didn't find any 
exposures in my initial test shots that I was uncomfortable with. The meter is 
consistent and you can always dial in exposure compensation or turn on the 
exposure bracketing if you need to guard against highlight blowout.</p> 
<p>Be aware that metering changes when you press the exposure lock button to 
partial area metering (about 9% of the total image area). If you don't catch 
this distinction, you're going to have trouble getting the exposure you want. 
(I also don't like the fact that the only way you can cancel exposure lock is 
to wait for the camera meter to time out or press the focus point selection 
button; why wouldn't a second press of the exposure lock button unlock a locked 
exposure?)</p> 
<p>Manual exposure users should note that you get only two stops of metering 
information on each side of 0.</p> 
<p>  Overall, ambient metering performance seems accurate and consistent, but 
a little hotter than I'm used to with Nikon equipment (there's no easy way to 
spot meter and test head to head, unfortunately--I did try center weighted and 
found the Canon to be about a 1/3 stop hotter than my D70s, but that's within 
the ANSI tolerances, so without testing lots of bodies I can't say that Canon 
is running their meters hotter than Nikon). I did find that I was consistently 
wanting to set a small amount of underexposure compensation with both my 
Digital Rebel and the 20D. (Confession: having used Nikon DSLRs for so long, 
I'm very sensitive to highlight detail. Indeed, when used well, that's one of 
the key attributes of the Nikon and Fujifilm DSLRs: they can capture 
extraordinarily subtle highlight detail.)</p> 
<p>  Flash exposures are another story, however. Flash exposures on the 
original Digital Rebel can be quite inconsistent, with a tendency towards being 
too bright (blowing out highlights). On the 20D I found the inconsistency to 
have been considerably reduced, but not eradicated. Outside Program exposure 
mode, the camera is really performing Standard TTL and has a tendency to 
produce slightly hotter flash amounts than I normally like. Fortunately, flash 
exposure compensation can be dialed in quickly and directly (while looking 
through the viewfinder), so you can deal with this issue, if necessary. 
Overall, I wanted a bit more options from the flash, specifically Manual flash 
levels and wireless triggers using the internal flash.  Assuming you learn the 
idiosyncrasies of Nikon's flash system, something I'll admit takes me several 
hundred pages to describe, you'll end up with much more control over the 
internal flash on a D70s, especially for multiple flash. Still, E-TTL II seems 
to have solved many of the complaints I had about Canon's flash system.</p> 
<h4>Autofocus</h4> 
<p>One of the big marketing points about the 20D was its improved autofocus 
system. Indeed, I'd say that it is significantly improved over the 10D and 
Digital Rebel. In decent light it really doesn't matter which AF sensor does 
the focusing, it'll be fast and (almost) sure. As light levels plummet, the 
differing orientations of the outbound sensors start to come into play, and 
I've seen the AF performance drop significantly as a result (a typical problem 
with all consumer DSLRs). But in practice I didn't find any substantive issues 
in performance. The 20D is near or at state-of-the-art in autofocus performance 
for a consumer DSLR.</p> 
<p>However, I do have one minor concern. Why do I say that? Because I get a 
little of what I call &quot;focus wobble.&quot; Repeated focusing on the same 
object can produce slightly different results, with ever-so-slight misses in 
front of or behind the actual point with no predictability. This seems to 
happen more often in low light, but I've triggered it at least once in bright 
light. My working hypothesis is that Canon is using some sort of fall-back 
calculation in its AF system in certain instances. It's curious whatever the 
cause--I've not seen any Nikon DSLR be inconsistent in missed focus points. 
When a Nikon DSLR misses, it seems to always miss in the same direction and by 
pretty much the same amount, regardless of which way it was coming at focus or 
any other condition (as in the classic back-focus issues with a few of the 
original D70 models that came out of the factory mis-adjusted).</p> 
<p>But my 20D will sometimes miss a bit behind, sometimes a bit in front of 
the actual focus point. Lest you think this is a deal killer, it isn't. As I 
said, it's minor, and it only seems to happen when the AF system is 
&quot;stressed&quot; (e.g. low light). Indeed, trying to come up with a 
repeatable test bed that allowed me to duplicate the issue enough so that I 
felt the issue was not just my imagination took me quite some time to construct 
and is one of the reasons why this review sat on my desk unfinished for so 
long. The problem seems more pronounced with consumer lenses than the L (pro) 
lenses I have available, which would indicate to me that there may be tolerance 
levels in the autofocus motors of the consumer cameras that are larger than the 
higher-priced lenses. Still, I've found conditions under which I can get 
repeatable, slightly wrong AF results. I note that 20D focus inconsistency does 
get mentioned on a number of the Canon-oriented forums from time to time, so I 
think this is a very real attribute of the camera you need to pay close 
attention to.</p> 
<p>Again, don't get me wrong. The 20D's autofocus system works as advertised 
most of the time. Overall, it is fast to lock onto subjects and does so across 
a fairly broad area. For wide angle landscape work like I do most of the time, 
it's not an issue, as hyperfocal distance is more important than autofocus. And 
in normal lighting conditions I almost never encountered the wobble issue. But 
if I were shooting at high ISO values indoors (e.g. high school basketball--I 
first noticed the problem in some BBall shots in the local gym), I think I'd 
solely use L lenses and be watching my focus more carefully.</p> 
<p>Moreover, anyone shooting action in low light with the 20D really needs to 
understand the physical orientations of the outlying sensors; some are 
vertical, some are horizontal, and those differences can indeed influence focus 
speed and accuracy in some framings with some subjects.</p> 
<h4>Battery Life</h4> 
<p>Battery life is excellent, as good as any consumer DSLR to date. </p> 
<p>Canon rates the battery at about 1000 images at room temperature when no 
flash is used, and I can't find fault with that; if anything, my camera does 
better than that. Your overall battery life is going to be mostly determined by 
how much you use the color LCD more so than how many pictures you take, though. 
Needing more than two charged batteries for a day's worth of shooting isn't 
something I can imagine any 20D user encountering; I've been getting by with a 
single battery in most of my full day shooting sessions with the camera.</p> 
<h4>Write Speed</h4> 
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with the write speed of the 20D. After the poor 
performance of the Digital Rebel, I wasn't sure what to expect with the 20D, 
but if anything, it's slightly faster at writing images to a card than is the 
D70s (but it isn't quite as fast at clearing the buffer, so it's mostly a 
wash). On most of my fastest cards I was averaging between 5-6MB/second with 
raw files, slightly lower with JPEG (the fastest I achieved with JPEG was right 
at 5MB/second). Microdrives faired far less well, having only about two-thirds 
the performance.</p> 
<h4>Image Quality</h4> 
<p>Overall, the 20D produces very nice JPEG images, though they're a little 
&quot;softer&quot; than I expected (even with sharpness turned up). Color is 
good and well saturated, contrast is excellent in the mid-range of the tonal 
ramps, and overall detail is very good. You'll want to know more about each of 
those assessments.</p> 
<p>Color isn't perfect. Indeed, when you run Imatest on the 20D at the 
camera's default settings, you'll find that while the greens and blues are 
dead-on accurate, the reds all drift towards amber in the CIE 2D space. The net 
result is warm skin tones, which a lot of people like, but not fully accurate 
color. Using Parameter 2 instead of Parameter 1 lowers this red drift, but at 
the expense of overall saturation and contrast. In time, I found that I 
preferred Parameter 1 with the Saturation tuned to average. Even then, though, 
the colors weren't perfectly accurate, just very pleasing.</p> 
<p>Contrast is a tough subject to discuss, because there are multiple schools 
of thought here. For example, the Fujifilm S3 Pro favors expanded dynamic range 
over out-of-camera contrast, and you often have to post process some contrast 
back into many of its images because of that. What I've noticed on both the 20D 
and previous Canon cameras I've used is that Canon seems to concentrate on 
getting the middle of the contrast range right, at the slight expense of shadow 
and highlight detail getting shorted. Looking at a long gray ramp run, such as 
on the Kodak Gray Scale card, the blacks from 15 through 19 tend to block up on 
the 20D. The highlight end doesn't seem to fare as bad, but still has a 
tendency to block up a bit. But printed out, that slight &quot;contrast 
compression&quot; is exactly what most people want out of their snapshots. I 
think that Canon's target is dead-on to the amateur market's desire, but I find 
it sometimes problematic in my shooting (I live for shadow and highlight 
detail).</p> 
<p>Detail isn't as well resolved for an 8mp camera as you might expect. I was 
a little startled at first when my 8mp Coolpix 8800 was producing 
&quot;sharper&quot; images than my 20D. Some of that has to do with sensor size 
and depth of field--the 8800 has a couple of natural DOF advantages there. But 
even with Sharpness set to high, the 20D wasn't producing the level of acuity I 
expected. I'm sure this is intentional and part of the Canon engineering design 
decisions. It may very well be an interaction with noise reduction, but I 
suspect it was simply a &quot;we've got more pixels now so we don't have to be 
as aggressive with in-camera sharpening and antialiasing as we were 
before&quot; type of decision.</p> 
<p>The good news is that this tends to mask JPEG and moire artifacts. The bad 
news is that the D70s is a very aggressive camera in terms of acuity, so the 
difference between a 6mp &quot;sharp&quot; camera and an 8mp &quot;soft&quot; 
camera isn't as much as you'd expect in JPEG images. (Though I'd be lax if I 
didn't point out that the D70's aggressive behavior does tend to make noise 
more visible and more easily triggers moire problems.) That said, Canon's 
decision here doesn't bother me one bit, as I tend to always turn off in-camera 
sharpening and use my own post processing techniques to get to the detail 
without dialing up artifacts. If you're a never-post-process sort of shooter, 
you might find that Canon's default Sharpening settings doesn't go as far as 
you'd like, though.</p> 
<p>Noise is well controlled in the 20D, though Canon afficionados will be 
surprised to hear that the 20D is not the lowest noise camera I've seen at ISO 
1600 (the S3 Pro is, by a good margin). At the base ISO value, visible noise is 
pretty much non-existent (helped by the drop in the shadow tone ramp), while at 
higher ISO values the noise is not excessive and doesn't have the color noise 
properties that some cameras do.</p> 
<p>I hesitate to comment much on raw files, as I don't have enough experience 
running different converters on Canon images to make the kinds of statements I 
sometimes do about Nikon raw files. But what I've seen with Photoshop CS and 
Capture One is impressive: the 20D can produce raw files rich with detail and 
tonal values and low in noise, exactly what a raw shooter wants.</p> 
<p>Overall, I like the image quality the 20D produces quite a bit. For JPEGs 
at the default settings it's a bit softer and warm than you may want, so pay 
close attention to your settings if you're looking for high acuity and color 
accuracy.</p> 
<h4>Drawbacks</h4> 
<ul> 
<li> <i><b>Hanging onto the True Amateurs</b></i>. The scene exposure modes 
and lack of viewfinder information tell me Canon still has the rank amateur in 
their sights for this camera. Come on guys, the 20D is a far, far better camera 
than Joe and Jill Pointandshoot should be using (hint: Digital Rebel); don't 
carry over those design decisions. <br>
</li> 
<li><b><i>Not so Flashy</i></b>. Canon's default flash settings often seem hot 
to me (and on rare occasions a bit inconsistent). Still, the 20D is much better 
than the 10D was at flash, so Canon seems to be moving in the right direction 
with their algorithm changes.</li> 
<li><em><strong>Charmin-like Image Quality</strong>. </em>Even at high 
sharpening settings the 20D's images are just a bit on the soft side with JPEGs 
coming out of the camera. I find it interesting how each new camera--Canon or 
Nikon--seems to antialias and render back and forth across the mid-point of the 
acuity line. The 20D is Canon's softest consumer camera so far, and you'll 
probably want to use post processing sharpening instead of the camera's 
abilities to get the most out of that 8mp.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Positives</h4> 
<ul> 
<li><b><i>It's the Image Stupid. </i></b> Nice color, nice contrast, 8 
megapixel size, and very printable out-of-camera JPEGs. The raw DCRs give you 
even more ability to pull high quality images out of this camera. Just watch 
the highlight exposure carefully and use careful sharpening in your post 
processing to get the most this camera has to offer.</li> 
<li><b><i>Bang for the Buck</i></b>! US$1499 for a full-featured, 8mp DSLR is 
as good as it gets here in mid-2005 [price has drifted downwards since then, 
but the point remains]. There isn't another comparable DSLR currently within 
range of the 20D at the price point, though I suspect that this advantage will 
disappear completely by mid 2006.</li> 
<li><b><i>Canon is Learning. </i></b> Build quality and handling are much 
improved over the 10D, D60, and D30. A pro won't have any troubles using the 
20D as his back-up body to a 1D or 1Ds.</li> 
<li><b><i>Steroid-free Performance Enhancements. </i></b> Write-to-card speed 
is now fast and state-of-the-art, and the autofocus system is peppier, too. 
Couple that with the 5 fps frame advance, and the 20D borders on a camera that 
can be used seriously for sports.</li> </ul> 
<p>By this point, I'm sure I've said enough to provide fodder for any loyal 
Canonista to start lobbing back at me. Some will jump on small things I 
faulted, others will claim my ratings are biased, some will nod their head 
about something I wrote but still claim I'm not being fair. The thing is, I 
have the opportunity to use virtually any DSLR that's been made (well, okay, 
I've unloaded some of my older cameras that weren't getting used and I've yet 
to try a Pentax DSLR). I regularly rotate through the bodies that are available 
to me, especially when I'm teaching workshops. If the Canon 20D were really the 
drop-dead, do-all, gotta-stop-using-Nikon camera that some folk claim it is 
(and who regularly send me email trying to convince me of that), I'd be 
gravitating more towards the 20D than some of the other bodies in my arsenal. 
But as much as I find the Fujifilm S3 Pro a frustrating camera to use, I like 
it's JPEG quality better than the 20D and don't feel I'm giving up anything 
substantive in terms of image quality. As much as the D70 and D100 are older 
models and &quot;only&quot; 6mp, I don't find that the 20D's 8mp is beckoning 
me in any way shape or form--the 20D has a slightly soft 8mp and the D70 has a 
slightly sharp 6mp; they're simply not as far apart as the increase in pixels 
might suggest. Remember, the difference between 6 and 8mp works out to be about 
500 pixels in the long axis, or about 16%, not the 33% you might be thinking 
the numbers mean.</p> 
<p>Don't get me wrong, the 20D is the first consumer Canon I've actually 
enjoyed shooting with. It has a nice feel, takes nice pictures, has plenty of 
nice features, and really is everything a non-pro needs in a camera. But it<em>
isn't</em> a Nikon-killer, it isn't a no-brainer purchase decision, and it 
isn't going to be the sole product with those specifications for very long. 
It's just a very fine camera that many people will like a lot.</p> 
<p>Yes, I'm being a bit defensive. Just as with my Digital Rebel review I 
fully expect some loyal Canon users to send me hate mail. I suggest they go 
back and carefully read what I wrote. I don't know what it is about Canon/Nikon 
(or Mac/PC, or Toyota/GM, Fujichrome/Kodachrome, or any other corporate 
rivalry) that inspires people to near religious crusades, but it's not worth 
the time and effort, folks. My reviews are just that, my reviews. Use them how 
you'd like, but I still always suggest that once you've read about a few 
cameras that sound like they might appeal to you, go to a camera store and try 
them out. It's not that difficult to try a D70s and 20D side by side. You'll 
likely prefer one over the other, and you'll be able to decide for yourself if 
any difference you perceive is worth the difference in price.</p> <br>

&nbsp; <b>Qui</b><b>ck Evaluation </b> <br>

<p><b><br>
 Highly Recommended</b>; An excellent choice for the advanced 
amateur photographer, and the best Canon consumer DSLR to date, by far.</p> 
<p> features <br>
performance<br>
build<br>
value <br>
<br>
Why no five star 
marks? While the 20D gets high marks across the board, it never quite hits it 
out of the park in any area. Performance comes closest to making it to five, 
with Value also being a close call, but I don't give half stars. To elaborate:
</p> 
<p><strong>Features</strong>: the 20D falls a bit short on flash flexibility, 
useful customizations, and viewfinder information.<br>
<strong>Performance
</strong>: really really close, but the red color shift and overall softness 
bothers me, as does the AF wobble.<br>
<strong>Build</strong>: little handling 
gripes get in the way; the lack of full integration of the multicontroller is 
one that sticks out.<br>
<strong>Value</strong>: here the DR and D70s get in 
the way. Do you really get US$500 more with the 20D? For 50% more price, we 
need more to get five stars.</p> 
<p>That said, it's a close call all the way. In the consumer DSLR market, the 
20D is the new current state-of-the-art (the D70s is a very close second, which 
is why that Value rating didn't hit five).</p>

<p>Initial Review: 10/5/05:<br>
 Minor finish tweaks: 2/24/06 </p>
<p><strong>Switch or Not?</strong><br>
 So the big question is whether the 20D 
is good enough to convince a Nikon user to sell their equipment and switch to 
Canon. My answer: probably not. </p>
<p>That's not to say that the 20D isn't a very good camera. It is. Arguably 
better than a Nikon D70s in several ways. But to make a full switch from one 
brand to another (it goes the other way, too: I wouldn't recommend a Canon 10D 
user to get a Nikon D70s instead of a Digital Rebel or 20D, either) requires 
that the difference be clear, convincing, and likely unmatched. </p>
<p>Let's start with &quot;clear.&quot; The two clear differences come in the 5 
fps and 8mp traits, with perhaps the autofocus being another area (at least for 
bright light, off center use). While 5 fps sounds great in theory, in practice, 
it's difficult to follow action while mashing the shutter release down, because 
the 20D just doesn't have the short viewfinder blackout times the Canon 
1DMarkII or the Nikon D2h have. That limits just how useful that 5 fps is. The 
8mp gives you cropping flexiblity more than anything else, but not as much as 
you'd think (~500 pixels horizontally, 300 vertically). Thus, the 
&quot;clear&quot; differences aren't as dramatic as they at first look. </p>
<p>Which brings us to &quot;convincing.&quot; I'm just not convinced that any 
of the primary differences between the 20D and D70s can't be overcome by a 
careful shooter. When you add in the fact that the D70's out-of-camera acuity 
is higher than that of the 20D, the 8mp difference starts to wilt a little 
more. Yes, there are differences; no, 95% of the market isn't going to be 
getting anything useful from those differences. Given the US$500 difference in 
price, it'll take more convincing for me to say switching is useful. </p>
<p>Then there's the &quot;unmatched.&quot; At present, the 20D wins on any 
number of small points. It certainly has more wins than losses in any box 
score. But as with the Digital Rebel, Nikon's &quot;response&quot; is probably 
just around the corner. The D100 is due to be replaced in fall-2005, and the 
D100 is really the camera that goes up against the 20D (the D70 really matches 
against the Digital Rebel, so it's saying something that it holds up so well 
against a more expensive, better specified 20D). Is the 20D likely to stay 
unmatched at the Nikon end? My guess is no. Whether Nikon can top the 20D with 
the upcoming D200 is another story, but I certainly expect them to at least 
match it. </p>
<p>So, the bottom line is that, in the consumer realm, I see no reason to make 
a switch from Nikon to Canon (or vice versa). Conversely, I see no reason to 
avoid the Canon 20D, either. It's a fine camera that does what 90% of the 
market needs done. If you're starting from scratch in the DSLR world, you could 
do a lot worse than pick something other than the 20D. </p>
<p>At the high-end pro realm, the story is a bit different. A number of pro 
wildlife shooters have noted that the 20D has the second highest pixel density 
of any DSLR (the D2x is the highest as I write this). Because you can't always 
approach wildlife as close as you'd like, pixel density turns out to be an 
important issue. And US$1495 is a lot less than US$4995, so the 20D does indeed 
attract pros. Too bad about the focus inconsistency, though. </p>
<p>But again, at the consumer level, the story is much, much different. You 
won't go wrong being a Canon user or a Nikon user. The 20D is a very nice 
camera, as is the D70s. Personally, most amateur users would be better served 
by buying a D70s (or Digital Rebel) and using the money saved to buy another 
lens or a better tripod. </p>
<p>Postnote: with the introduction of the Nikon D200 and 30D the question 
reverses: switch from a 20D or 30D to a D200? My answer remains the same: for 
most consumers, I see no compelling reason to switch horses. The recent 30D 
update to the 20D just reinforces that. You can point out a specific thing or 
two that one camera has that the other doesn't, but unless that thing is 
something you require, don't get hung up on the &quot;newer is better&quot; 
marketing spiel that every camera company keeps trumpeting. Indeed, a 20D 
doesn't take worse pictures just because a D200 or a 30D was introduced. </p>
