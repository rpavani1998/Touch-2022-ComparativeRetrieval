<p>The web's best camera &amp; lens rental</p> 
<p>You're a photographer. And whether you&rsquo;re a budding amateur, a 
vacationer, or a full-on pro, you benefit from using the best equipment. Buying 
it can be expensive though, especially if you only need it for a few days or a 
few weeks. That's why we offer convenient and cost-effective rentals on all 
top-quality photography equipment. We stock a huge selection ofCanon, Nikon, and
Olympus lenses, camera bodies, and accessories, and we get them to you with an 
easy-to-understand reservation system, responsive and friendly service, and
<strong>two-way FREE shipping</strong>.*</p> It&rsquo;s easy to get started!

</li> 
<li> Click on the equipment you wish to rent<br>
</li> 
<li>Select the <em>begin</em> and <em>end</em> dates of your rental, using our 
easy reservation calendar<br>
</li> 
<li> Add the item to your cart<br>
</li> 
<li>Repeat steps 1-4 for any additional equipment<br>
</li> 
<li> Check out using our secure server</li> </ol> <br>
<br>
