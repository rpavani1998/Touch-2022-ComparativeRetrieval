<h1>The Complete Sony A55 Review</h1> 
<p>by Mike Pouliot on May 12, 2011</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Sadly, my time with the A55 has come to an end. So what are my overall 
thoughts on the camera? I&rsquo;m happy to report that I was pleasantly 
surprised by this innovative little camera. It&rsquo;s fast, easy to use and it 
produces excellent photos and video. Instead of rambling on and repeating the 
previous days&rsquo; posts, I&rsquo;ve made a list of my likes and dislikes. 
Please keep in mind that some of these may be a bit subjective, the following 
are simply my thoughts after using the camera for several days.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Testing</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Day 1 &ndash; Getting to know the A55</li> 
<li>Day 2 &ndash; Special features of the A55</li> 
<li>Day 3 &ndash; Tourist shooting with the A55</li> 
<li>Day 4 &ndash; Shooting video and testing the kit and 35mm F/1.8 SAM</li> 
<li>Day 5 &ndash; Low light shooting and ISO tests</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Likes</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>External screen: The bright, clear and beautiful external screen is 
probably my favorite part of theA55. Shooting with the articulating screen 
makes you want to shoot from strange angles and gives you a real sense of 
freedom. On top of that,Sony has included helpful shooting info and overlays 
which can be selected by the user when needed. My favorite is the on screen 
electronic level&hellip;no more crooked shots.</li> 
<li>Special features: I thought some of the special features were going to be 
kind of gimmicky. Thankfully,Sony actually made these features easy to use but 
more importantly, they are truly helpful. My favorite of the bunch had to be 
sweep panorama. SeeDay 2 for more info on each of the special features.</li> 
<li>Size and Weight: Most people do not like to take their camera with them 
for two reasons, size and weight. While it&rsquo;s not as small as amicro four 
thirds camera or even the Sony NEX, it is one of the smaller DSLRs on the 
market. I carried theA55 around for hours and I hardly noticed it was there.
</li> 
<li>Video: The video from the A55 isn&rsquo;t perfect, but it is pretty darn 
good for a consumer camera. If access to the shutter and aperture were 
available during shooting I thinkSony would have hit a home run with the A55
&lsquo;s video abilities.</li> 
<li>Electronic Viewfinder: While I&rsquo;d much rather use the external 
screen, I&rsquo;m very happy thatSony included an EVF on the A55. There are 
certain situations where an EVF is invaluable, like when shooting in the 
blazing sun. Thankfully the EVF can display the same shooting information that 
is available on the external screen.</li> 
<li>Progressive features: I think the real winning trait of the A55 is 
something I&rsquo;m going to call &ldquo;Progressive Features&rdquo;. What I 
mean by progressive features is theA55 offers users that may be new to DSLRs or 
advanced cameras the ability to just pick up the camera and make beautiful 
photos. But more importantly, theA55 gives users the means to grow as a 
photographer. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine giving myCanon 5D to my mom and expect 
her to be able to use it effectively. She would most likely get discouraged and 
give up on the camera. TheA55 on the other hand offers excellent auto settings 
that help guide the user to achieve the type of shot they desire. But theA55 
doesn&rsquo;t stop there. It almost encourages the user to try different modes 
and use it&rsquo;s different functions. Taking the fear out of photography is 
key for people that are starting out or trying to get better and I think theA55 
excels in this area.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Dislikes</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Buttons and Button Layout: While the A55 is very easy to use, it is 
littered with buttons. Even after a few days of shooting, I was still hitting 
buttons while just trying to grip the camera. Again, I only had theA55 for a 
little over a week so I probably would have adapted to the body but it was 
slightly annoying. My other beef is the pure amount of buttons on theA55. I 
enjoy having quick access to functions but do you really need a dedicated 
button for the D-Range/Auto HDR feature? Probably not.</li> 
<li>The External Screen: Yes, I know I have the screen in the likes and 
dislikes butSony made one big mistake with this, the swivel for the screen 
should be on the side and not the bottom. I could see this screen getting in 
the way for anyone using a tripod. It also makes getting overhead shots a 
little more difficult that it has to be.</li> 
<li>Auto Focus: Hands down my biggest complaint with the A55 is the AF. While 
it worked well most of the time, it did refuse to lock onto a subject on 
several occasions. Even when manually selecting the AF point, theA55 would 
struggle to focus at times. I&rsquo;m not sure if this can be chalked up to the 
fancy semi-transparent mirror or if is a software issue, butSony needs to 
address this issue. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to scare people off by making them 
think theA55 can&rsquo;t focus to save it&rsquo;s life because that&rsquo;s not 
the case. I just want to make it clear that you may encounter the occasional AF 
hiccup. I used theA55 for over a week and it never annoyed me to the point that 
I would have returned it if I had purchased the camera with my own money.</li> 
</ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>The Sony A55 vs. Sony NEX</h2> 
<p>When I first received the A55 I thought, OK so why not save a couple 
hundred bucks and go for theNEX? Now that I&rsquo;ve spent some time with the 
A55, I can now see that these are two VERY different cameras. If you are 
stepping up from a point and shoot (P&amp;S) and you don&rsquo;t think 
you&rsquo;ll ever really need anything beyond what an advanced P&amp;S can 
offer, than go with theNEX. It&rsquo;s small, light and more importantly it has 
very good IQ. If you are looking to upgrade from a P&amp;S or advanced P&amp;S 
and you want your next camera to be able to grow with you, go for theA55. You 
have WAY more lenses to choose from, IQ is much better, you get more features, 
in-body image stabilization, built in flash, and the list goes on and on.</p> 
<p>Chris reviewed the NEX-5 a while back.</p> 
<h2>Who is the Sony A55 for?</h2> 
<p>Like I said in Day 1, the A55 is a feature packed camera. The special 
features and some of the more common features make this an ideal camera for 
someone who is stepping up from a P&amp;S or advanced P&amp;S camera. The auto 
modes work well but on top of the plain auto modesSony has added other features 
which help the user get the most out of the camera. From full auto mode, you 
can advance to the Auto+ mode which allows you to delve into some of the 
additional functions like auto HDR. Once users get comfortable shooting in 
Auto+ the next natural step is to move to one of the PASM modes. I think that 
was well thought out. I could even see some of my technically challenged family 
and friends learning and&nbsp;growing with this camera.</p>

<p>nice camera, I like the flip out screen and sweep pano. But I can&rsquo;t 
give up my Pentax system just for those two features. you&rsquo;d think that 
others would get on board the sweep pano, after all most dslrs have hdr now so 
why not sweep pano?</p> </li>

<p>Speaking as a photography newbie, I&rsquo;ve been very happy with my a55. 
&nbsp;The new firmware version 2.0 allows the D-range button to be reassigned, 
but I wish the battery life were longer.</p> </li>
