The_conclusion <br>
<br>
 All three 
cameras have previously been tested on ePHOTOzine but tested in isolation is 
one thing, what about when they face the same conditions at the same time in a 
very practical test, rather than in the lab? It&rsquo;s at this point you start 
to get some idea about which camera is best at doing what function. Whether 
that&rsquo;s the quality of the lens, the ISO noise reduction or ability to 
deal with difficult exposures. In this shootout then, all the cameras were 
tested in the same conditions at the same time, shooting RAW for maximum 
quality unless stated otherwise. The Canon was equipped with a EF-S 18-55mm 
f/3.5 IS lens, the Nikon with a Nikkor 18-55mm DX VR f/3.5 DX VR lens and the 
Pentax with an smc Pentax-DA 18-55mm AL II lens.<br>
<br>
 Firstly though, a 
word about the conditions involved. All digital cameras process their images 
&ndash; otherwise there wouldn&rsquo;t be any. This isn&rsquo;t the age of film 
where the same film in different cameras can be directly compared. So, to get 
as close to raw picture quality as possible, all the highlight and shadow 
enhancement, colour and contrast adjustments and sharpness options were turned 
off in the firmware. Even the high ISO noise processing was turned off, except 
where it was specifically being tested. When looking at the RAW files in 
Photoshop, all the import filters that are normally applied when loading were 
set to zero. Each camera used the sRGB colour profile, the neutral or normal 
colour and contrast profile with everything set to zero enhancement. The Canon 
RAW files were CR2, the Pentax PEF and the Nikon NEF.<br>
<br>

EOS 550D,</strong> <strong>Nikon D90, </strong> <strong>Pentax K-7: Image 
quality</strong> <br>
<br>
<strong>Test 1: JPEG v RAW</strong> <br>
 For this 
test the cameras were set to shoot RAW and top quality JPEG at the same time. 
It&rsquo;s important to realise that the camera isn&rsquo;t taking two shots 
here, it&rsquo;s taking one, saving the RAW file as the basic file and the JPEG 
one after applying a set of specific algorithms. The advantage that RAW has is 
that you can set the processing priorities later. When loading the RAW file to 
compare against the JPEG, they look very different, but that&rsquo;s because 
the RAW import contains a set of parameters for hue, brightness in particular, 
contrast, sharpness etc. Reset all these import settings to zero and the 
difference between the RAW and JPEG file is dramatically reduced. So, your 
results in practice will depend on exactly how you decide to process the RAW 
file. If you don&rsquo;t want to, then use the JPEG files, learn your cameras 
tendencies and adjust your shooting parameters accordingly.<br>
<br>
 Now 
let&rsquo;s get to the comparisons. In the case of the Canon, the JPEG image is 
brightened up a lot to the point that the brickwork on the left was 
overexposed. With no adjustments to the RAW file on importing there&rsquo;s a 
much better result with more detail on the walls. In terms of detail, 
it&rsquo;s very close, there not much lost at all in the high quality JPEG 
save. Sharpness as well, is almost the same, but the CR2 is a little sharper. 
The tone of the RAW file is a little warmer and obviously, in this example, the 
colours are better because it now isn&rsquo;t overexposed. However, colour 
fringing on the RAW is certainly more apparent than after the little tweak the 
JPEG file gets. The other thing is that shadow noise is ever so slightly more 
apparent in the RAW file because basically it&rsquo;s been smoothed out in the 
JPEG file.<br>
<br>
 To the Nikon then, and the first point to note is that the 
JPEG file is warmer than the NEF file which is slightly cool in comparison. 
Again though, the JPEG file is much brighter, though the brickwork isn&rsquo;t 
as overexposed as the Canon JPEG. Also, you can see more noticeable colour 
fringing in the RAW file than the JPEG. There&rsquo;s slightly more contrast in 
the JPEG file (even though it&rsquo;s brighter), it retains as much detail as 
the RAW file but is softer.<br>
<br>
 Progressing to the Pentax the PEF RAW 
file is underexposed. There&rsquo;s clearly space on the right hand side of the 
histogram for more highlights. However, this has given it the perfect 
opportunity to brighten the image for the JPEG which is spot on. The RAW file 
is clearly sharper than JPEG file which also loses a little detail. Tonally, 
they are much the same, bearing in mind the brightness difference.<br>
<br>
 
Direct comparisons are interesting because the Canon metering has gone for a 
brighter image compared to the Pentax and Nikon. Shooting at f/8 in AP mode 
with centre-weighted average metering in all cases, the Pentax and Nikon 
produced shutter speeds of 1/200th sec, the Canon 1/125th sec. The extra light 
certainly brightens up the shadows, but the JPEG processing of the Canon has 
distinctly let it down by wading in and brightening it up to the extent that 
the brickwork is completely overexposed. The Nikon looks like it brightens just 
as much, but starting from a lower light level the result is better. The best 
outright result from an exposure perspective came from the Pentax which 
underexposed the RAW file, but brightened it and added just the right amount of 
contrast to give a near perfect JPEG file.<br>
<br>
 Now, stacking the JPEGs up 
against each other, the Nikon file is the sharpest with more detail. The Pentax 
file has the most contrast, but also slightly more tonal variation in the 
shadows. The Canon file is the softest with the least detail, but bear in mind, 
the differences are very minor.<br>
<br>
 Comparing the RAW files directly and 
the results are very similar but these observations can be made. Firstly, that 
the Pentax file is the sharpest, that the Canon is the softest, but they are 
extremely close. The Pentax has the most contrast but also more noise in the 
shadows than the other two. And now I&rsquo;m going to add the caveat that 
these are the results obtained with the lenses used for the test. Different 
lenses will give different sharpness and contrast, but they won&rsquo;t affect 
the noise or how the firmware treats processing the JPEG from the RAW data.<br>

<strong>Test 2: ISO speeds</strong> <br>
 All the cameras were 
tested through the range at which they can be compared, which is from 
ISO100-6400. For this, the Nikon has Low and High ratings, but they have the 
same speeds as ISO100 and 6400 respectively. The Canon also has a High mode of 
ISO12,800 which is very, very noisy. All camera and import filter based high 
ISO noise reduction was turned off to see the basic picture. So to the ISO100 
setting and it&rsquo;s good news all round. There&rsquo;s no noise here for any 
of them. At ISO200 there&rsquo;s some tonal variation in the shadows of the 
Pentax, but then this has more contrast so it&rsquo;s going to make it more 
apparent. The Canon looks very slightly more gritty the Nikon is much the same 
as at ISO100. At ISO400 the Nikon and Canon are still performing very well, 
there&rsquo;s only very minor effects, but the Pentax now shows clear tonal 
variation in the shadows, it&rsquo;s clearly worse than the other two, but in 
itself, doesn&rsquo;t affect the overall picture quality. At ISO800 both the 
Nikon and Canon show variation in the shadows and the Canon has some colour 
variation in the stonework. The Pentax has noise now in the shadows and 
it&rsquo;s also apparent across the leaves and other areas of the image.<br>

<br> The fun starts at ISO1600 with much more clearly defined, coloured noise 
across the entire Pentax image. The Canon also now has coloured noise across 
the image, though it&rsquo;s softer, while the Nikon shows better quality in 
the lighter areas, but the same kind of noise in the shadows. Very noisy 
shadows for the Pentax at ISO3200 and hard noise across the main image. The 
Nikon also has clumps of noise in the shadows and soft noise in the general 
image but it&rsquo;s significantly better. The Canon is also better, with soft 
noise. At ISO6400 there&rsquo;s sharp coloured noise all over the Pentax image 
with loss of detail in the shadows and the image is certainly darker. The Canon 
has lots of coloured noise across the image, though as before, it&rsquo;s 
certainly softer than that in the Nikon image. The Nikon has blotchy noise in 
the shadows and all over the image, but it&rsquo;s not too bad. Overall, this 
is the one area where the Pentax does fall behind the Nikon and Canon. Once you 
get past ISO200 it develops more noise at each setting. At the high end, the 
Nikon tends to sharper clumps while the Canon is softer but across the entire 
image. How noise reduction works at these high numbers though, is the question 
answered in the next test.<br>

<strong>Test 3: Noise reduction
</strong> <br>
 Although the options are well buried in most cases, 
there&rsquo;s a choice of noise reduction at high ISO ratings for all three 
cameras. The Canon has two settings, with the default Strong setting being 
automatically applied unless it&rsquo;s turned off. The Nikon has four strength 
settings, but like the Canon, there&rsquo;s very little difference between them 
so you may as well use the highest setting. The Pentax has five settings and 
there&rsquo;s quite a big difference between them, from hardly any effect to 
much more aggressive reduction. Stacking all three up against each other at 
ISO3200 on the strongest setting, there&rsquo;s a case to be made that the 
noise reduction of the Pentax is the best because it has the worst noise and 
yet it makes a good job of it. The Canon noise is softer than the Nikon but is 
more prevalent. The Nikon reduces it to clumps so some areas look better and 
others worse. From a straightforward question over which image looks best at 
ISO3200 with the noise reduction set to maximum the answer would be the Nikon, 
though there&rsquo;s not much in it.<br>

<strong>
Test 4: Sun in the frame</strong> <br>
 Once the sun starts to intrude on a 
shot you can guarantee that the metering will start to panic. It introduces an 
element that is far brighter than anything else in the scene, but the question 
is will it overcompensate? The zone metering system for each camera was used so 
as well as the bright sun they should take into consideration the scenery and 
sky. The darkest image is the one from the Pentax, which also explains why the 
burnout from the sun is smallest. The Canon is very similar to the Pentax but 
in straight zone metering terms the best result is from the Nikon which has 
weighted the scene with more consideration of the other elements, giving a 
better overall exposure. It&rsquo;s also come up with a bluer sky.<br>

<strong>Test 5: Backlit, contrasty scene</strong> <br>
 For this next test, the 
scene is backlit. The sun in the clouds behind the cathedral making the clouds 
very white. The foreground isn&rsquo;t dark as such, but it does contrast with 
what&rsquo;s in the background. The important point to note is that the vast 
majority of areas in this scene are darker than the sky. Both centre-weighted 
and zone metering were tried here for all cameras. First up the Canon on 
centre-weighted. With the focus and weighting on the building, but taking into 
account the light and dark zones everywhere else, it was expected to be a 
little lighter with loss of detail in the sky and that&rsquo;s the case. With 
the zone metering system the camera takes into consideration all the zones. 
Now, the sky zones are much brighter, but there are a lot more darker cathedral 
ones. In the case of the Canon&rsquo;s Evaluative metering they have balanced 
each other out and the result is virtually identical. For the Nikon, the 
centre-weighted version was quite similar, though slightly darker than the 
Canon. However, the zone metering version was a lot brighter showing that in 
this case, the metering has taken more note of the fact that there are a larger 
number of average, darker ones, than the brightness of the few sky ones. The 
Pentax has given the darkest centre-weighted image, putting more detail back 
into the sky and again the zone metering has recognised and counted the 
majority of the darker zones and not been fooled by the brighter ones. What can 
be drawn from this is that on zone metering, the Pentax and Nikon will expose 
for the ground rather than the sky and the Canon takes slightly more notice of 
the sky. It&rsquo;s important to realise that there is no ideal exposure here, 
because the tonal range is too great to be captured in one shot.<br>

<strong>Test 
6: Bright sky, dark foreground</strong> <br>
 This is a similar test, where the 
church front is in shadow but there is a nice swathe of blue sky to the left, 
with the sunny sky off to the right. So, there should be a good chance of 
getting both building and left-side sky together, at the expense of the white 
clouds to the right. This test was done with zone metering and gave some 
interesting results. The first is that the Nikon has lost the sky to the right 
while having the darkest building front. The white balance has also given the 
church front a very cold feel. The white balance of the Pentax and Canon are 
better. The Canon has brought in more sky, so has a lighter building. However, 
the Pentax has a darker building than the Canon and yet also more sky, giving a 
slightly better dynamic range result. So, again the Pentax and Nikon produced 
exposures slightly more aimed at the building, the Canon took slightly more 
notice of the sky, but the Pentax gave the best result overall.<br>

<br> <br>
<strong>Test 7: Predominantly black subject</strong> <br>
 It&rsquo;s 
time to do some spot metering here with a predominantly black test. The test 
subject is an old mill. On one side is blue skies and sunshine, on the other 
shadow on the black painted surface. Spot metering is designed to place 
whatever you meter off, in the middle of the exposure so when you look at a 
histogram, the area that was spot metered from, should be smack in the middle. 
So, in this case, the test is to see whether the metering ignores everything 
else that is going on and places the shaded, black surface in the middle of the 
exposure. The result of that will be a burnt out sky and overexposed picture. 
In picture terms that isn&rsquo;t what we want, so the second part of this test 
is to ask zone metering to balance the bright blue sky, with the black front 
and very black back of the mill.<br>
<br>
 First up the Canon and the spot 
metering has indeed rendered the dark black as a light muddy grey colour. It 
did fail with a slight blue colour cast but that&rsquo;s a separate issue. The 
zone metering also performed very well and captured the entire scene for the 
Canon. The Nikon spot metering produced virtually the same result so a good 
performance there and the white balance was better. However, the predilection 
of the zone metering to pay more attention to the landscape than the sky is 
clearly demonstrated here. The mill is more of a muddy grey, the sky has lost 
detail and the image is overexposed. It&rsquo;s no surprise then to see the 
Pentax give a similar result. Firstly, the spot metering ups the blacks into 
the middle as with the others, but not to quite the same degree, showing that 
there is less weighting there. On the zone test though, the image isn&rsquo;t 
that much different, showing more weighting towards the scenery like the Nikon, 
with overexposure in the sky, though it isn&rsquo;t as pronounced as the Nikon, 
showing a better dynamic range. Clear win for the Canon on this test, Pentax 
second.<br>

 This dual-shot test is the opposite 
of the previous one. Here we have a white door in the sunshine. Accurate spot 
metering should give a dull result with the white door tones in the middle of 
the histogram. The challenge for the zone metering is to read the duller 
brickwork surround it and shift the door tones into the top half of the 
histogram. Firstly the Canon on the spot test and here this is disappointing. 
The white tones are about a third of the way into the histogram, not in the 
middle so it&rsquo;s much too dark. On the zone metering its taken notice of 
the darker brickwork and now it is brighter, but with almost all the tones 
under the two third point it&rsquo;s still underexposed. The Nikon is better, 
but still, the white door isn&rsquo;t in the middle of the exposure. The zone 
metering version is brighter again than the Canon and is a much better result 
overall. We&rsquo;ve seen the Pentax tend to give darker results than the other 
two systems and this is very apparent with the spot metering test on the white 
door. It&rsquo;s completely wrong, the door tones are about 25% of the way into 
the histogram, rather than being in the middle. The zone metering gives a 
better result but even here, the door tones are now only into the middle of the 
histogram, so this is very underexposed. Best results here for the Nikon, Canon 
second.<br>

<br>
<strong>Test 9: Continuous focus and fast shooting
</strong> <br>
 If you want to pick out the killer shot when something is 
speeding past your lens, you&rsquo;re going to need the ability to either 
continually focus or shoot lots of images very quickly, or in fact, both at 
once. The test here then is to see how well the cameras focus on a car 
travelling in front of the camera. The test was timed to also include the 
number of images that the cameras could capture in the same time. The cars, by 
the way, are entering a town, just past a speed camera sign, so tend to slow 
down to the same speed. Of the three, only the Pentax has continuous focus 
marked on the lens as a switch, the Canon uses a joypad button then a menu 
selection, the Nikon uses a button and wheel combination.<br>
<br>
 First, 
let&rsquo;s just say that continuous focus on all three is tinged with wishful 
thinking. Something like the cars moving on the same plane across the camera 
are okay, something coming towards the camera or flapping about like a bird 
would be impossible. The focussing just isn&rsquo;t fast enough on any of them. 
The Canon did have a slight edge in focussing ahead of the Nikon though. In 
terms of drive and saving to the card, all three have a continuous high speed 
mode, but here the buffer size also comes into play. The Canon managed a poor 
six CR2 files before filling the buffer, the Nikon bagged nine in fast 
succession and then a final one once the buffer cleared to make 10 NEF files.
<br> <br>
 The Pentax shot more slowly than the others but only managed five 
PEF files. As a second element to the test, the cameras were then set to top 
quality JPEG and a 10 second capture test run. The Pentax now managed seven 
images, still poor, the Canon a far more exciting 18 shots and the Nikon equal 
with 18 shots as well. So, for action and drive, Canon and Nikon on JPEGs, the 
Nikon if you want it RAW.<br>

<strong>Canon EOS 550D, </strong> <strong>Nikon D90, 
</strong> <strong>Pentax K-7</strong> <strong>: White-balance tests</strong> 
<br> <br>
<strong>Test 10: AWB in daylight</strong> <br>
 Testing AWB in 
daylight is interesting because the actual colour temperature recorded can vary 
significantly, depending on exactly how much sunlight, sun itself or shade is 
in the scene. So, a number of images shot during different conditions were 
assessed for all the cameras and these were the results:<br>
<br>
Test Canon 
EOS 550D Nikon D90 Pentax K-7 <br>
Sunlight, clouds &amp; shade 4850K 4450K 
4450K <br>
Sun in frame 5850K 5400K 4950K <br>
Sunlight and a little shade 5400K
5600K 5000K <br>
Direct sunlight, no sky 5200K 5000K 4550K <br>
<br>
<br>
 So, 
as far as sunlight goes, it&rsquo;s rated at between 5000K and 6000K depending 
on the exact conditions. Typical temperature at mid-day in summer is rated at 
5500K. The middle two tests are the ones with the most sunshine in them. The 
Canon gives warmer results on the whole than the Nikon D90, the Nikon was 
accurate on the two middle tests, but when shade or lack of sky is a factor, it 
drops right down. Pentax gave the coldest results of all, coming in well under 
the other two, even on the two tests with copious amounts of sunshine. The plus 
point is that you&rsquo;ll get much bluer skies from this. The point to 
remember is that if the AWB used by the camera is lower than the actual 
conditions it will make the image colder. If the AWB used is higher than the 
actual conditions it will make the image warmer. Overall, the best results were 
from the Canon and Nikon, but if there&rsquo;s lots of shade involved, then 
it&rsquo;s the Canon.<br>
<br>
 Just to make life interesting for our cameras 
there&rsquo;s also another test here. We have a typical sunny scene, but there 
are deep shadows under the trees so maybe you don&rsquo;t trust the AWB because 
it could be influenced by the shade. So, the white balance was set to the 
manual Daylight option. Now you can see what the tendency of the cameras is 
because they use different points for their manual settings. The Canon used a 
temperature of 5200K, the Nikon 4950K and the Pentax 4850K. The actual results 
for this image show the Pentax and Nikon being very similar, with probably too 
much blue. The skies are very nice, but the trees on the Canon shot are 
definitely more green. If you shoot RAW it&rsquo;s all a moot point because you 
can set up the conversion to warm up or cool down shots to your personal 
preferences. What is shown here is what you get direct from the camera and in 
these cases my preference would be for the Canon ones.<br>

<strong>Test 11: 
AWB in cloudy conditions</strong> <br>
 On to a shot of a house under bright, 
white cloudy skies. The Canon gave a result of 4950K, the Nikon came in with 
4450K and the Pentax with 4600K. The Nikon result is definitely too blue and 
needs warming up &ndash; never mind in the greenery, the front of the house has 
a blue cast. The Pentax is better, the trees are greener and the red climbing 
vine is redder, but it&rsquo;s still too low and too blue. The Canon result is 
also too cold, but it&rsquo;s the best out of this lot by a long way.<br>

<br> <strong>Test 12: AWB under tungsten lighting</strong> <br>
 In this test 
of the AWB we&rsquo;ve got low light, no natural daylight, just some high power 
tungsten bulbs lighting the display. The Canon gets us off and running with a 
temperature of 3250K, the Nikon registered 3000K and the Pentax weighed in with 
2700K. The Pentax is clearly under the mark here, so there&rsquo;s a cyan 
colour cast. The Nikon is the closest, but is slightly under so there&rsquo;s a 
slight blue tinge while the Canon is a bit above so it looks warm. Given the 
material you&rsquo;d want a neutral or warm image, but in terms of accuracy, 
the Nikon was closest.<br>

<strong>Test 13: AWB under mixed 
fluorescent lighting</strong> <br>
 The lighting here is a large fluorescent 
unit overhead with the slightest amount of daylight coming in and hitting the 
bottom edge of the plinth. The plinth is white, the walls are an off-white 
colour. The Nikon came up with a temperature of 3700K, the Canon 3800K and the 
Pentax 3900K. For this test only, the JPEGs you see on the web page have had 
the levels equalised to exactly the same degree in each case. All three cameras 
had underexposed this scene, but by brightening them, it makes it easier to see 
the colour differences. The Nikon is easily the best result and despite being 
sandwiched between the other two, the Canon has more of a green tinge than the 
others. So, the Pentax produces a better result than it, even with a higher 
temperature.<br>

<strong>Test 14: AWB using flash
</strong> <br>
 Camera flash is supposed to be balanced at the same colour 
temperature as daylight, which is around 5500K. However, when using fill flash 
the camera pays attention to the lighting in the scene as well. So, this scene 
was actually very dark, with just a little light at the front. The cameras were 
all set to the same aperture and speed and used in manual mode so that ambient 
light had little effect. Firstly, the Canon recorded a temperature of 5700K, 
the Nikon 5250K and the Pentax 4800K. In some ways this mirrors what 
we&rsquo;ve seen all along. The Canon clearly is aimed at giving warmer results 
and has the most red in it. However, all three results are actually acceptable, 
though the Pentax is slightly on the blue side.<br>

<strong>Test 15: 
Custom WB</strong> <br>
 For the custom test there&rsquo;s bright daylight 
outside the target area and deep shade under it. The test here is to meter off 
a white sheet of paper to produce a custom white balance for the scene. The 
Pentax produced a temperature of 4350K, the Nikon 4950K and the Canon, 
unsurprisingly, 5200K. The Nikon and Pentax are the most accurate in terms of 
the light on the bricks at the back of the machinery. On the Canon, the 
brickwork is virtually yellow. On the Pentax the surface of the large wheel 
looks a lot less rusty than it should be. Of the three, the Nikon is certainly 
the best result, the Pentax, despite shooting well under what the Nikon 
produced, is the next best result, and the Canon, with its tendency to warm 
things up, is too ruddy, but all three are fairly good outcomes.<br>

<strong>7: Lens quality</strong> <br>
 For this set of tests a scene was shot 
at the wide angle 18mm, around the middle 35mm and at the telephoto 55mm 
settings on the kit lenses. With focal length multipliers of 1.5x or 1.6x, the 
actual field of view for each was 27-29mm, 52-56mm and 82-88mm. At each focal 
length a full range of aperture shots were taken, so you can compare any of the 
settings with each other. As perceived sharpness is affected by brightness and 
contrast, when looking at this all the exposures were adjusted so that they 
were the same. All the cameras were mounted on a tripod for this test, though 
the ISO wasn&rsquo;t increased in order to see how well the image stabilisation 
for each system also did.<br>
<br>
<strong>Test 16: 18mm focal length</strong> 
<br> At the wide angle with the open aperture of f/3.5 there&rsquo;s much the 
same barrel distortion on all three cameras and all three feature colour 
fringing in equal amounts. One noticeable difference &ndash; other than the 
overexposure from the Nikon, is that the sky has better smoothness from the 
Pentax than the Canon. At f/8, the sharpest part of the lens, the Pentax just 
edges it, the other two are inseparable. At the f/22 aperture there is again, 
no appreciable difference in the sharpness though the Pentax has a little more 
contrast.<br>

 Moving in to the middle of 
the lens around the 35mm marking on the barrel and there&rsquo;s a little 
distortion from the edges, but not a lot now, on images from all three cameras. 
At the f/5.6 aperture the Canon lens is slightly sharper than the Pentax and 
the Nikon which are the same, though the Pentax again has more contrast. 
There&rsquo;s possibly slight movement on the Pentax for this shot because, as 
you move into the middle of the aperture settings, the Pentax clearly retakes 
the lead and also, has more sharpness at the edges of the image than the other 
two.<br>

Test 18: 55mm focal 
length</strong> <br>
 At the end of the zoom on the kit lenses there&rsquo;s a 
little slanting inwards on the Pentax lens but all three now show pincushioning 
in the middle to a modest degree. At the f/5.6 aperture, the Pentax edges the 
Canon and then the Nikon in terms of sharpness and contrast. By the time the 
aperture is narrowed down to f/22 it&rsquo;s a test to see which system can 
deliver a decent image at a slow shutter speed. Of these, the Canon was the 
only real success, there&rsquo;s definitely movement on the Pentax and Nikon 
systems. In fact, while that&rsquo;s not a real surprise here, there&rsquo;s 
also some movement at other settings for all three cameras. At 0.3secs shutter 
speed it can be excused, but at 1/100th sec, with a standard focal length and 
being tripod mounted, it&rsquo;s not such a great performance. The image 
stabilisation for all three with these lenses isn&rsquo;t impressive. Overall 
though, the consistent result was that the Pentax lens was sharper than the 
other two.<br>

<strong>Canon EOS 550D vs Nikon D90 vs 
Pentax K-7: The conclusion</strong> <br>
 When testing over numerous criteria 
as has been done here, it would be unusual for one camera and kit lens to be 
best at everything and that&rsquo;s certainly the case. In terms of pure image 
quality, at ISO100, there&rsquo;s no real difference between the cameras. As 
the ISO is increased the Pentax quickly shows more noise than the others so 
that by ISO400 it&rsquo;s much more apparent in the shadows. The noise 
suppression on all three cameras is to be complimented, with perhaps the edge 
going to the Canon. The Pentax lens though has the most contrast and sharpness 
at a basic level. For white balance there&rsquo;s a clear difference of 
opinion, the Canon gives you a warmer image than the Nikon or Pentax. In terms 
of outright accuracy, the Nikon is the best here. It&rsquo;s also the best in 
terms of continuous or drive shooting in RAW, and tied with the Canon when 
using JPEGs. When it came to metering, in a variety of conditions, both inside 
and out, the Nikon and the Pentax were more reliable, with the Canon proving 
erratic at times. However, the Pentax clearly showed better dynamic range 
without enhancements, producing detail in the shadows, yet also coming up with 
generally more detail in darker skies. The Nikon was the worst in terms of 
dynamic range, losing highlights that the others captured. This comparison 
hasn&rsquo;t covered handling but a quick word here is that the D90 is very 
good with a wide range of buttons and solid build quality, the Pentax is next 
best being surprisingly heavy, but relying on menus for some things and the 
Canon is some way behind, with a plastic feel and lots of menu access.<br>
<br>

 So, is there an overall winner from the test? I&rsquo;m afraid not. The Pentax 
is as good as the Nikon and Canon at ISO100, and better at a number of things, 
but the image quality drops off when the ISO goes higher. If you are expecting 
to routinely shoot at high ISOs, then either the Canon or Nikon are good, the 
Canon also has an extra high mode that only really suits black and white. For 
pure landscape shots or if you just want to shoot JPEGs in sunny conditions 
I&rsquo;d go for the Pentax, while for people shots and landscapes featuring 
stonework you might want the warmer tones of the Canon. For more action or 
mixed lighting conditions, such as indoors, then the Nikon would be my choice.

<p>Excellent review, the only proper way you can compare group contenders-at 
the same time under near identical conditions. If I was looking to choose from 
these contenders this is exactly the sort of side by side test I would place 
great store in. Ultimately I would still want to handle the cameras for myself 
to see how they felt in my own hands, but at least I would be well informed on 
the technical aspects of their performance and thus better able to come to an 
informed decision.<br>
<br>
 If I had a criticism (only a small one!), could we 
please have these comparative detailed tests soon after the cameras come out 
-not when they are on their way out or have been around for many months.<br>

<br> Overall, great job.</p> <i>Last Modified By Moderator Team at 12 Nov 2010

<p>Whilst I would generally agree with these test results (there is no denying 
the D90 is a cracking camera body) I was a bit worried to see the glaring 
technical error in that the Pentax does actually start at ISO100, not, as 
highlighted, 200. One error questions the possiblity of others. Also, if you 
used NEF on the Nikon why did you not use PEF on the Pentax? The feel 
throughout this was an unfamiliarity with the Pentax and Pentax range in the 
hand, and a knowing nod to generally good Canons.<br>
<br>
 Finally, would have 
been nice to have seen the Canon and Pentax compared to a D90 with an 18-55 kit 
lens attached, not a VR (albeit budget). Just about everyone upgrades the kit 
lens soon after buying.<br>
<br>
 This site is generally justifiably trusted in 
its reviews and opinions. A pity this one was not so rigorously performed. A 
nice bit of Nikon Nation PR possibly? from what could have been a genuinely 
unbiased review, with research, showing the good points of all and in 
conclusion the D90 being the generally better camera.<br>
<br>

 PS I 
do own a Pentax (not a k7, prefer the K-x) but my comments would have applied 
equally for the other two if they had been mis-described. Also totally agree 
with kako, bottom line - go play with them before you commit.</p> <i>Last

<p>I notice that the canon 550D comes in at around &pound;100 less than its 
two competitors a fact which doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere in the 
review. Spend that extra money on a better lens than the kit lens and I wonder 
what the result would be?</p> <i>Last Modified By Moderator Team at 12 Nov 2010

<p>Then explain how a respected camera magazine rated the Pentax K7 ABOVE all 
3 for best overall DSLR in a recent test?? Clearly there is an element of 
subjectivity in this test! The images of ALL three cameras are just as good as 
ANY other DSLR camera, and all will produce high quility images good enough for 
publication!! The only point I tend to agree with is that noise control at high 
ISOs in the Pentax is not as good! But, as stated in the previous comment, the 
noise reduction is customizable. And of course the lowest ISO for the Pentax IS 
100 ISO!!<br>
<br>
 What about the build quality of the Pentax K7? It's build 
quality is far superior to the other models! And handling?? Well, unless you 
have hugh hands it is also more ergonomic than the Canon and Nikon.<br>
<br>
 
I'm not surprised at the rather cursory glance and instant dismissal of Pentax 
as this site is biased towards Nikon and Canon anyway!</p> <i>Last Modified By

<br>
I recently traded 
a K7 and bought a D700 with a D90 for backup. I like the D90 and I agree with 
your conclusions regarding high ISO noise and continuous AF.<br>
<br>
 However 
the Pentax does have a lot more features (not mentioned) and far better build 
quality (metal body and sealed). Handling on the K7 is really superb with far 
better access to custom settings, esp WB tuning and auto ISO settings. Again, 
not mentioned. In many ways its better than the D700 (no setting for auto ISO 
to adjust itself based on focal length for instance).<br>
<br>
 As far as I can 
remember it also does ISO100 perfectly well and has four NR settings for high 
ISO. These innaccuracies are surprising. The Nikon OTOH only does ISO100 as a 
non-standard setting. Auto WB is also a considerable improvement over the Nikon 
in incandescent light.<br>
<br>
 The Nikon has many advantages in terms of 
continuous AF and is easier to live with overall, but you dont need to put the 
Pentax down for faults it doesn't actually have. I won't accuse you of bias, 
but at least get your facts in order.</p> <i>Last Modified By Moderator Team at

<p>The review was a little disappointing in that there's a bit of difference 
in the kit lenses.<br>
<br>
 As each of the contenders have have a 
decent/affordable 50mm prime that almost everyone buys, it would be nice if you 
did the tests with that or a similar lens.<br>
<br>
 As it is when I see the 
conclusion state that the IQ is really close but the D90 is better, and then 
look at the differences in lenses, I have to wonder if it is the body or the 
glass, especially given the 18mp sensor on the 550D/T2i does not really get a 
chance to shine with the kit lens....</p> <i>Last Modified By Moderator Team at

<p>This review is a mess with regards to the K-7. <br>
<br>
 There are basic 
factual errors: The K-7 shoots ISO 100, if you can't access ISO 100 you most 
likely have shadow and highlight correction turned on. This a a software 
setting for JPEGs which will affect images considerably with regards to dynamic 
range, noise and overall exposure. You may also have had things like CA 
correction and lens distortion correction turned on? Again a JPEG software 
setting which will change the ouput, buffer etc.<br>
<br>
 And yet you haven't 
mentioned these settings. Like you don't mention in-camera shake reduction, 
weather sealing (camera or lens), 100% viewfinder, older lens compatibility... 
the list could go on.<br>
<br>
 Are you normally shooting with all the settings 
at default in-camera JPEG? It's pretty much not testing how noisy the sensor is 
here, but the default in-camera noise reduction. Proper tests show the K-7 in 
RAW is very similar to D300S and 7D, with perhaps slightly more noise and 
detail retention.<br>
 And the Nikon had quite a different lens. <br>
<br>
 And 
I have no idea how you managed<b>FOUR</b> shots in continuous shooting before a 
buffer jam. My K-7 with a 'fast SDHC' card shoots about<b>FIFTEEN</b> RAW files 
at 1/8000 second (so with no frame-rate slowness due to shutter speed) before 
any buffer issue. No indication of number of in-focus shots on here either.<br>

<br> No attempt to discuss any other factors like build quality, audible noise, 
ergonomics etc etc.<br>
<br>
 A very poor review. Perhaps not biased, but 
factually a mess.<br>
 My advice would be do a review properly, or don't review.

<p>I am in full agreement with the forum members that are critical of your 
review. How could you have not noticed that the K7 has a ISO 100 native. Your 
fast shooting analysis seems realy out of wack. Your review is not a serious 
analysis and it would be better not to publish this poor quality analysis if 
you want to keep your credibility...<br>

<p>This is one of the least credible reviews I've ever read, and it certainly 
draws into question the credibility of the other reviews on the site. Did you 
actually have a K-7 when you conducted these tests? Good grief.</p> <i>Last

<p>Thanks for posting. I'm sure the efforts put into producing tests like this 
and then reading comments here must often seem a thankless job.<br>
<br>
 I 
think some of the less forgiveable aspects of this &quot;test&quot; is that you 
shot nearly all of the K-7 images using center-weighted metering rather than 
segmented which would have been the equivalent of Evaluative/Matrix on the 
Canon/Nikon. (No wonder they were so 'consistent'.) This led to significant 
underexposure on many images.<br>
<br>
 The other is the apparent lack of 
effort on the part of the tester to familiarize himself enough with the Pentax 
to know that ISO 100 is not accessible if the D-Range/shadow correction 
features are enabled...another feature that will sometimes introduce some noise 
into the shadows.<br>
<br>
 So combining use of shadow correction and 
underexposing by misuse of center-weighted metering puts the K-7 at a 
significant disadvantage that it didn't need against formidable competition.<br>
<br> I understand why the D90 was tested with its pricier 18-105 kit lens 
rather than the 18-55 which would have made for a better comparison...don't 
think this would make that big a difference anyway. Certainly didn't help in 
terms of distortion.<br>
<br>
 As a suggestion for future tests of this sort on 
lenses, at the vary least you might want to include some relevant 100% crops 
that made you decide which lenses were 'sharper'. It can be a bit tough to 
judge these anyway as the scene had objects at many different distances so 
focus may not have been the same.<br>
<br>
 The 'write error' on the K-7 during 
continous shooting doesn't sound like normal behavior to me and is probably an 
issue that should have been resolved rather than assuming 'that's the way it 
is'.</p> <i>Last Modified By Moderator Team at 12 Nov 2010 - 2:47 PM</i> <br>

<p>All I can say is I am extremely disappointed that something this poorly 
done could make it to the presses on a major photography site.<br>
<br>
 If in 
fact Pete, the site owner, does own a Pentax than he would look at this head to 
head and scratch his own head.<br>
<br>
 Garbage like this damages this sites 
credibilty. When I initially clicked the link, which was posted on photo.net 
Pentax forum, I saw ephotozine and I expected a quality comparison, much in the 
same way I'd expect a good review from photo.net, dpreview, etc. From this 
point forward this site NEVER gets the benefit of that again.<br>
<br>
 So 
Pete, if you do have any control over what is posted on your site, you should 
be considering that I am most likely not the only person that feels your site 
has lost most of it's credibility in one quick instance. I would highly 
recommend you pull this review until the author can spend some quality time 
with all 3 cameras.<br>
<br>
 2 major inaccuracies, which just a quick glance 
at the spec sheet would alert the author to, are the RAW buffer, and the base 
ISO. Just these two major errors alone are enough to crush the credibility of 
this review.<br>
<br>
 Initially, I thought it was a typo that the K-7 didn't 
have ISO 100, but when I scrolled to the first set of test photos I noticed the 
reviewer really didn't test the K-7 at ISO 100.<br>
<br>
 Beyond that, the K-7 
metering is quite good, yet the reviewer managed to underexpose almost all the 
K-7 images by what appears to be close to a stop. I wonder if along with DR 
expansion, he also had exposure compensation set on the k-7 to -2/3 or -1.<br>

<br> With any speed card the K-7 buffer is 15 PEF or 14 DNG, using the fastest 
cards I have I actually get an extra few shots off before the buffer fills, as 
I always have with Pentax DSLRs since the K10D. This makes the buffer more like 
17 RAW vs. the 4 that the review states. This isn't a minor discrepancy, it's 
absolutely appalling that the reviewer didn't notice this and try to figure out 
why he might be getting such limited buffer from a camera with quite a large 
RAW buffer at 5.2 FPS.<br>
<br>
 These are the errors (the buffer and ISO) that 
rule out subjective influences because they are simply specifications of the 
camera and not open to debate. There are other areas of the review that I 
question, such as the metering where the reviewer notes Pentax was the most 
consistent, but Nikon wins? Huh? How is this possible?<br>
<br>
 The bottom 
line, you've lost a few people who might have looked at your site as a source 
of information, and I truly hope you can correct these issues before your site 
loses more credibility. I hope you realize that even one article on a website 
as poor as this can call into question everything else on the site.<br>
<b><br>

 If your reviewer needs a crash course on the workings of the K-7 before 
reattempting a less biased test, he can feel free to take a look at thethorough 
review of the Pentax K-7 found on photo.net </b></p> <i>Last Modified By

<p>Thank you for all joining to share your views. There's clearly some Pentax 
bias in some of your opinions, but this also highlights clearly that the review 
is flawed. As you're all new to the site you won't be aware that we are 
normally very accurate with reviews and this is a one off which we will 
address. We pride ourselves with not having any bias which is why I stepped in 
earlier to confirm this. We will re-evaluate the review and reshoot some of the 
test pictures making any necessary changes to the review.</p> <i>Last Modified

<p>A really interesting test design, but dissapointed that most all subjects 
are inanimate stuff like buildings, bridges, streets, etc. At least for me, the 
test of any camera is how it handles the most challenging and interesting 
subject matter of all...people. Particularly faces, skin tones, etc.<br>
<br>
 
Scenery is nice, but people are hard-wired to respond at the deepest level to 
the human image. For the next test, maybe consider showing us what a camera can 
do with human subjects.<br>
<br>
 Once again, the study design is good, but the 
range of subjects is a bit too clinical, impersonal, technical and less than 
engaging. - Rob</p> <i>Last Modified By rob27 at 5 Oct 2011 - 9:02 AM</i> <br>
