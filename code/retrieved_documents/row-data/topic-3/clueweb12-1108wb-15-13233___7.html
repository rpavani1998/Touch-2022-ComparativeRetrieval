<p><strong>Which is the ultimate high-speed pro digital SLR &ndash; the Nikon 
D3S or the Canon EOS 1D Mark IV? Digital Camera puts these two heavyweights 
through a head-to-head test&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>Both the Nikon D3S and Canon EOS 1D Mark IV have been designed for the same 
purpose &ndash; high-speed photography. As a result, they&rsquo;re targeted at 
professional photographers, especially those who shoot sports, press photos or 
wildlife. These subjects can present some of the most challenging and demanding 
conditions for photographers to work in.<br>
 Both cameras are tough, robust 
and built with a spec list sure to impress photographers who need accurate 
high-speed performance they can rely on. On paper, both the 1D Mark IV and the 
D3S offer some truly spectacular features, some of which would have seemed 
unthinkable even just a few years ago. Stats like this don&rsquo;t come cheap, 
but the cameras are also competitive when it comes to price. So which comes out 
on top in the battle for the &lsquo;best pro SLR&rsquo; title? Read on to find 
out..<br>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read our Nikon D3S and Canon EOS 1D Mark IV reviews, 
you&rsquo;ll know that both these high-end DSLRs have been designed for the 
same purpose &ndash; high-speed photography. As a result, they&rsquo;re 
targeted at professional photographers, especially those who shoot sports, 
press photos or wildlife. These subjects can present some of the most 
challenging and demanding conditions for photographers to work in.</p> 
<p>Both cameras are tough, robust and built with a spec list sure to impress 
photographers who need accurate high-speed performance they can rely on. On 
paper, both the 1D Mark IV and the D3S offer some truly spectacular features, 
some of which would have seemed unthinkable even just a few years ago. Stats 
like this don&rsquo;t come cheap, but the cameras are also competitive when it 
comes to price. So which comes out on top in the battle for the &lsquo;best pro 
DSLR&rsquo; title?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As befits such heavy hitters, we tested the cameras in a boxing gym. We 
shot our subject under different lighting conditions, with a range of poses and 
action set-ups. The D3S was tested with a Nikon AF-S 24-70mm f/2.8G ED lens, 
and the 1D with a Canon EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM.</p> 
<p>Both are at the top of their game, and unquestionably the best DSLRs on the 
market for sports and action photographers who demand superb quality, 
outstanding performance and super-quick shooting from their gear. Put two 
bruiser DSLRs like the D3S and 1D Mark IV into the ring and you&rsquo;re 
guaranteed a good, clean fight.</p> 
<p>Both cameras have evolved relatively seamlessly from their predecessors (the
D3 and 1D Mark III, respectively), so users already familiar with the Canon or 
Nikon layout will feel instantly at home. So how can you separate them when it 
comes to performance? On the following pages, we&rsquo;ll look at the key 
characteristics that make these cameras stand out, and then compare them 
head-to-head.</p> 
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s look at the sensors. The Canon EOS 1D Mark IV has 
a uniquely sized 16.1MP CMOS APS-H sensor, which is half way between full frame 
and APS-C. This gives a crop factor of x1.3, and while some users might be 
disappointed that the camera isn&rsquo;t full frame, others &ndash; especially 
sports photographers shooting from the touchline &ndash; will find that little 
bit of extra reach they can get from their telephoto lenses a real bonus</p> 
<p>Nikon has gone for full-frame, offering a 12.1MP FX CMOS sensor. While it 
might not boast the impressive pixel count of the Mark IV it&rsquo;s arguably 
not a camera targeted at the pixel-counting audience, and there are still more 
than enough pixels to facilitate a tighter crop if needed. This could prove a 
shrewd decision by Nikon, which has anticipated the demands of photographers 
and sought to combine the best of both worlds with impressive speed and 
guaranteed quality in equal measure.</p>

<p><strong>Nikon D3S vs Canon EOS 1D Mark IV: ISO and noise</strong></p> 
<p>Low-light shooting and super-high ISO performance appear to be the priority 
for the manufacturers of both cameras. WhenNikon revealed the D3S back in 
October 2009 it wowed the ever-demanding photographic community with 
astronomically high ISO settings. The large pixel pitch and a modified inner 
structure catapulted Nikon to the front<br>
 of the ISO race, with staggeringly 
impressive low-light performance thanks to an ISO range of 200 to 12800. But 
Canon fought back, and while in our tests shots taken at the 12800 setting were 
equally as usable as those from theD3S, there was definitely more noise.</p> 
<p>Both cameras can &lsquo;boost&rsquo; their high ISO performance to a 
whopping 102400. While images taken at this boosted ISO setting are incredibly 
noisy, it will facilitate hand-held shooting in near darkness without the need 
for a flash.</p> 
<p><strong>Nikon vs Canon ISO&nbsp;test results&hellip;<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>The exceptionally high ISO performance of both cameras is really good, but 
there&rsquo;s definitely more chromatic noise in the1D&nbsp;Mark IV 
images&nbsp; at the high end of the scale.</p>

<p> </p> <br>

<p><strong>Nikon D3S vs Canon EOS&nbsp;1D Mark IV: autofocus and frame rate
</strong></p> 
<p>Fast, accurate focusing combined with a fast frame rate (and generous 
buffer) is critical for action, press and wildlife photographers, and in this 
area both cameras performed exceptionally well in our tests, which we carried 
out under limited indoor light.</p> 
<p>Canon must be congratulated for the radical overhaul it has given to the 
comparatively clunky autofocusing that hampered the1D Mark III. Frustrated 
Canon users can now relish theMark IV&rsquo;s awesome performance. Using 45 AF 
sensors, 39 of which are the cross-shaped variety, Canon has really gone to 
town with asophisticated system that works a treat, especially when used 
alongside lenses with a maximum aperture of f/2.8 or faster. Once you navigate 
away from the default settings and start customising the camera to your 
specific requirements, the focus performance really comes into its own.</p> 
<p>The D3S boasts a 51-point AF system with 15 cross points, and it was fast 
and effective in our tests. This system is less of a radical departure than 
that of its predecessor, but then unlike the AF on the Mark III, it 
didn&rsquo;t need significant improvement. That said, Nikon has tuned the 
D3S&rsquo;s contrast detection system to provide focusing support during movie 
capture and Live View shooting.</p> 
<p>The D3S shoots at 9 frames per second (fps), unless you&rsquo;re using a 
Nikkor DX lens &ndash;&nbsp;then the camera switches to Crop mode, and the 
frame rate is increased to 11fps. However, do this and you&rsquo;ll lose the 
camera&rsquo;s full-frame potential. The Canon offers a constant 10fps, making 
it the winner in the speed stakes.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that both cameras are fast enough for most shooting 
situations, and while it might be superficial they sound and feel awesome too, 
especially when you fire off a round of shots. Even if you don&rsquo;t intend 
buying either of these cameras, go to your local camera store for a hands-on 
demo, just to feel and hear the drives in action. It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><strong>Nikon D3S</strong></p> 
<p>: The D3S&rsquo;s 51-point AF system was fast and responsive in demanding 
lighting conditions. It locked on to our subject and effortlessly tracked 
movement to deliver a set of pleasingly sharp shots. It&rsquo;s noticeable that 
the D3S produced images with a more muted colour palette in Auto White Balance 
mode. Combined with slight underexposure, the colours seemed more 
&lsquo;conservative&rsquo; than those captured by the 1D Mark IV.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Canon EOS 1D Mark IV</strong></p> 
<p>: The new pro EOS badly needed smarter autofocus. It&rsquo;s now got 45 AF 
sensors, 39 of which are cross-shaped (horizontal and vertical line detection). 
The new system worked extremely well in these challenging conditions. The 
colours captured by the 1D Mark IV here are pleasing and vibrant, with greater 
warmth than those from the D3S. They were more impressive and natural when 
viewed unaltered straight out of the camera.</p>

<p><strong>Nikon D3S vs Canon EOS&nbsp;1D Mark IV: metering and exposure
</strong></p> 
<p>Both cameras produced images with a good tonality and dynamic range. We 
tested the cameras in a variety of set-ups and modes, from the fully auto 3D 
Colour Matrix metering on theNikon D3S and Evaluative mode on the Canon 
EOS&nbsp;1D Mark IV to the spot metering modes on both cameras. Even in the 
challenging light of a locker room, both cameras&rsquo; intelligent metering 
systems worked a treat. In these shots we took a spot meter reading from the 
boxer&rsquo;s knee. Both shots produced healthy-looking histograms.</p> 
<p>(Click an test shot below to open the original JPEG&nbsp;in a new window

<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Nikon D3S</strong></p> 
<p>: This portrait reveals that the D3S can produce decent images with a good 
dynamic range and tonality.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Canon EOS 1D Mark IV</strong></p> 
<p>: The 1D Mark IV also did a good job of capturing a range of tones 
correctly in tricky lighting conditions.</p> 
<p><strong>Nikon D3S vs Canon EOS 1D Mark IV: detail and definition</strong>
</p> 
<p>On close scrutiny the detail in images from the D3S is impressive. The 
camera produced clean and crisp images despite the fact that it has fewer 
pixels. The Mark IV performed extremely well too. However, when put next to the 
D3S it&rsquo;s clear to see which camera&rsquo;s packing the punches. Both of 
the images below were shot hand-held. The fact that both cameras were able to 
deliver this quality of image when shooting at 9 frames per second or more is 
simply astonishing.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Nikon D3S</strong></p> 
<p>: The D3S might not have the megapixel advantage of the 1D Mark IV, but the 
detail and definition when zoomed in to 100% is superior.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Canon EOS 1D Mark IV</strong></p> 
<p>: While not quite as impressive as images from the D3S, the level of detail 
and definition captured by the 1D Mark IV is still pretty amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Nikon D3S vs Canon EOS 1D Mark IV: which is best?</strong></p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ve already bought into a Nikon or Canon system, the results of 
this test will be somewhat academic, as neither camera presents a compelling 
reason to switch systems. Both cameras are outstanding, and it&rsquo;s unlikely 
that anyone would be disappointed with their performance and the quality of 
images they produce.</p> 
<p>What distinguishes these cameras from other DSLRs is their ability to 
capture fast-moving action shots and work in low-light situations. In anISO test
 alone the Nikon would come out on top &ndash; our test shots show that theD3S 
delivers better results at higher settings. However, images with both cameras 
shot at ISO 12800 were impressive and very usable. Pushed to their extended 
limits the Nikon performed better, but both were arguably too noisy to be of 
much practical use.</p> 
<p>When it comes to speed, both of these cameras are pretty spectacular, 
especially when usingautofocus in fast-paced continuous shooting situations. 
Out of the box theCanon EOS 1D Mark IV delivered more accurate metering and 
colour rendition than the Nikon D3S, but the D3S could easily be customised to 
compensate for this.</p> 
<p>Both cameras are fully decked out with HD video capture features. The D3S 
can record standard HD movies at 720p and 24fps, which is impressive, but not 
compared with the 1D Mark IV&rsquo;s full HD 1080p at 29.97fps.</p> 
<p>Both cameras also have a hefty price tag &ndash;&nbsp;an RRP of over 
&pound;4,000 and street prices of &pound;3,600 and &pound;3,850 for the Nikon 
and Canon respectively. Combine this with the high-spec lenses you would need 
to maximise performance and you&rsquo;re looking at a considerable investment. 
The good news is that pro technology has a habit of migrating down the ranks, 
and it probably won&rsquo;t be long before you see some of these cameras&rsquo; 
staggering features on cameras at the more affordable end of the range.</p> 
<p>Having tested both cameras extensively, we have to call this fight a dead 
heat. We could nit-pick over this and that but at the end of the day, in use, 
both cameras deliver unparalleled user experience and outstanding image quality 
in the toughest of shooting situations.</p>
