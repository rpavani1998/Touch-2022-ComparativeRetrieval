<h1>On Sharing Photos on Flickr</h1> 
<p>by Gevon Servo on May 4, 2011</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Flickr is a great place to share your photography. We previously had a 
posting on&nbsp;how to get more page views on Flickr, but I wanted to go into 
the social media side of things. I am not a fan ofFacebook so&nbsp;Flickr is my 
site of choice for sharing my photography. It&rsquo;s very difficult for me to 
imagine not sharing my photography. There is a clear difference between 
photography for profit and photography for sharing.</p> 
<h2>New Sharing Features on Flickr</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Flickr has recently made it easier to share your photos with more places 
from their site. A button has been added to your photo page which has share 
links to Blogger, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, WordPress etc. Flickr has also 
given you a great deal of control on how you share your photos. You can share 
individual photos, sets, groups, or your photo-stream with Facebook friends 
while keeping them private. You can even set up accounts to automatically share 
any public image uploads directly to your Facebook feed. When users are signed 
out they can also share public and safe photos they see on Flickr directly to 
their Twitter and Facebook accounts. For more information on exactly what has 
changed at Flickr check out&nbsp;this FAQ.</p> 
<h2>Organization</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Flickr can be a chaotic mess without organization. To help organize you 
images, you can use tags, enabling image seekers to find your images relate to 
particular topics, like coffee or robots. Image Sets can be displayed as 
slideshows and be shared by embedding into a website. Flickr lets your organize 
your photos into sets and then organize those sets into collections. 
Collections, then, can be further grouped into higher-order collections. 
Organizing you helps people make sense of you images and gives them the ability 
to navigate through things easier.</p> 
<h2>Groups</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Flickr is a great place to discuss your images with like minded 
photographers. If you like&nbsp;foodie work, there is a group for that. Have a 
particular camera like aNikon D7000 or&nbsp;Canon 7D?&nbsp;There are groups for 
that. There are even groups for particular lenses like the35mm or 50mm. In 
essence there are thousands of groups to share you images with. Some groups 
like B&amp;H even hold cool contests. The key is to follow instructions of the 
groups when you sign up for them. Do this to make sure you are sharing the way 
the admins ask. If a group requires you to insert a tag in your photo, do so. 
Some groups only require you to chat with the other people there and comment on 
the images. This will help increase your image views and get you feedback.</p> 
<h2>Flickr is social media for Photogs</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Be social, just do not place an image there hoping people will comment. 
Remark on other users&rsquo; photography and share their images as well as your 
own. Talk about your photography. Here on The Phoblographer, we highlight 
images from our Flickr group because there are a lot of photographers, in our 
group, producing great images. There is a huge community aspect to photography. 
Be a part of it.</p>
