<p></p> 
<p>Why film? This year I hit a point in my photography where I had learned a 
great deal, but I realized that I needed something to challenge me.After seeing 
Chris Gampat shoot film&nbsp;and reading about the form, I finally decided to 
take the plunge. It felt like a fine way to refine my photography. The first 
roll, which recently got developed, came out better than expected. The camera, a
used Nikon N2020 from B&amp;H,&nbsp;worked much better than expected. It was an 
interesting learning experience. Film is not dead. It has been re-purposed for 
shooting when I want to slow down and wander the city looking for arty images. 
Which one do I prefer? For speed, convenience, and cost, digital. For getting 
back to the roots of photography, film.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>On the camera I chose</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>I first thought about shooting medium format, but then decided to work with 
gear compatible with my digital gear. The Nikon N2020/F501 SLR is something I 
bought because of its features. It works with the F mounts lenses I use with 
my&nbsp;Nikon D90. When it originally came out, the Nikon N2020 was a decently 
priced entry-level film camera with dual auto focus. Since it isn&rsquo;t too 
advanced, the was familiar enough for me as a digital user to get the hang of 
it.</p> 
<h2>Nikon 50mm f/1.8 D</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>For my first foray in to SLR film photography, I chose the 50mm because I 
am comfortable with it, and I have only used it digitally. TheNikon 50mm 1.8D
&nbsp;has an aperture ring, which I needed for this camera. It was amazing on 
the N2020.</p> 
<h2>Shooting &amp; Developing</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>I took my time with the Kodak Gold 200&nbsp;because I did not want&nbsp;to 
waste any frames. From research, I knew this Kodak film would give me great 
color and sharpness. The camera and film worked well together. I tried to shoot 
almost everything that I would with my DSLR: landscapes, street shots, plants, 
and even a cup of coffee. This all helped me to get a good feel for the gear. 
Frankly, I did not decide on a proper film developer though as I went to a 
basic local printer. Prints in hand, I was amazed all the images developed. I 
questioned my knowledge and found it tough not being able to look at the image 
right away.</p> 
<p>Digital spoils you with that ability.</p> 
<h2>What I have learned from film</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The slower you proceed, the more you see. I worried about: what to shoot, 
what I actually wanted to shoot, and the cost of it all if I messed up. The 
slightest mistake will waste a frame. Film forced me to put more thought into 
my shots; I couldn&rsquo;t go shutter-crazy. My inability to see the shots 
immediately drove me mad at times. I remember a story by Art Wolf on when he 
was in the Himalayan Mountains and had to wait until he got home to see what he 
shot. This made me want to get everything right in camera the first time. This 
inspired me to do this more with my digital photography as well. Film teaches 
patience which gave me the ability to really observe the grandeur of the world 
around you.</p>

<p>Nice, why F/N 80 as a budget camera it`s also cheap. But otherwise great 
tale.</p> </li>

<p>Really, really enjoy the color and contrast in the coffee shot! And 
it&rsquo;s so true that the concern about wasting film combined with the 
inability to review the shot makes &nbsp;you much more careful about 
composition, aperture, and shutter speed. Which probably means that I need to 
get out of winter photo-hibernation and put myself through film boot camp 
again&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>You&rsquo;ll love it.</p> 
<p>More over, I think that shooting film is about taking the ultimate chance 
as well.</p>
