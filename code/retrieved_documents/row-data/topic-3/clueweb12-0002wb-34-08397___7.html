<p>Canon's 60D DSLR camera</p> Canon More Images (2) <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Despite the availability of a variety of DSLR manufacturers, the Canon vs. 
Nikon debate is still going strong. Since the days of 35mm film, the two 
manufacturers have been close competitors. Traditionally, things seem to 
see-saw between the two, with each manufacturer becoming stronger for a while, 
before fading away to the other.</p> 
<p>Once you, as a photographer, become tied into one system, you'll probably 
become fairly fanatical about it! I've been a Canon user since I was about 15, 
while my assistant has always used Nikons, and we can argue about the two 
systems until the cows come home! If I were being totally objective, though, I 
would say that Nikon bodies tend to be marginally tougher and better laid-out, 
while Canon lenses still have the edge optically.</p> 
<p>If you're not tied into a system, the choice of cameras can seem 
bewildering. In this article, I'm going to take a look at two of the most 
popular enthusiast cameras -- theCanon 60D and the Nikon D7000. Both of these 
cameras are aimed at those who want to take their photography a step farther.
</p> 
<p>Which is the better buy? I'll take a look at the key points on each camera 
to help you make a better informed decision.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Resolution, Controls, and Body</h3> 
<p>The Canon wins hands-down on resolution, offering 18MP to Nikon's 16.2MP. 
However, it's unlikely that you'd even notice the difference unless you plan to 
regularly produce billboard-sized prints!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More importantly, there is a big difference in the bodies' construction. 
The Canon is made from a plastic shell (a vast departure from its predecessor, 
the 50D, which was made from magnesium alloy). The Nikon is made from magnesium 
alloy, and is certainly a far more suitable camera if you intend to shoot 
outside in disagreeable weather conditions. Both cameras have comfortable hand 
grips. But, even though the Canon is made of plastic, it's both bigger and 
heavier than the Nikon.</p> 
<p>When it comes to controls, neither of the cameras is perfect. Nikon has yet 
again put theISO button in a &quot;fiddly&quot; position, where it can't be 
changed while the camera is at eye-level. Nikon's &quot;Live View&quot; setup 
isn't great, either, but there are plenty of options for customization -- 
providing you take the time to set up the camera properly at initial purchase, 
and you know what you are doing!</p> 
<p>The Canon has lost quite a few buttons featured on the 50D, and the buttons 
it does have now only have a single function. It does benefit from a 
&quot;Q&quot; button, which takes users into the Q menu screen, which lists the 
key shooting parameters. Like the Nikon, it also has several customizable 
buttons.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>SD Cards</h3> 
<p>Both cameras will accept the new SDXC cards, which allow users up to 2TBs 
of space! However, the Nikon has two SD card slots, which is a great addition. 
This is particularly useful if you are shooting in different formats, or you 
don't want the risk of putting all your images on just one card.</p> 
<h3>HD Movie Mode</h3> 
<p>While both cameras offer an HD movie mode, only the Canon can shoot at 
30fps. The Nikon is restricted to 24fps in HD mode. But the Nikon does allow 
autofocus during movie recording.</p> 
<h3>LCD Screen</h3> 
<p>The Canon is by far the better camera in the LCD department. Not only does 
it offer the first DSLR flip-out LCD screen, but the screen has more resolution 
than the Nikon. It's also proportioned at 3:2, which means that it displays 
images at a more natural ratio.</p> 
<h3>Focusing System</h3> 
<p>In this department, the Nikon is king. Canon's 60D uses a now somewhat 
antiquated nine-point cross-type AF system, while the Nikon offers 39AF points, 
with nine cross-type points. While both cameras allow the users to pick a 
single AF point, the Nikon also allows for nine-, 21-, and 39-point dynamic 
area AF.</p> 
<h3>Image Quality</h3> 
<p>Both cameras perform well at high ISOs, giving printable results even at 
ISO 6400. The Nikon, however, produces much better color rendition in JPEG 
format than the Canon, although both produce stunningRAW images. Both cameras 
have a tendency to overexpose in high-contrast situations, although it's 
definitely more noticeable on the Nikon by quite a large degree. This is 
probably because Nikons tend to run a little bright on colors, which reflects 
back into the problem.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>In Conclusion</h3> 
<p>In my mind, the Canon 60D just edges the Nikon D7000 because of its 
slightly superior image quality and less fiddly controls. For those new to 
DSLRs, it's an easier camera to begin using well straight out of the box. And 
if you're interested in making movies, the Canon has far more options.</p> 
<p>I would, however, recommend the Nikon if you plan to work in inhospitable 
conditions (as it's far more solid) or are only ever going to shoot in JPEG. 
Otherwise, I'd recommend the Canon.</p> <br>
