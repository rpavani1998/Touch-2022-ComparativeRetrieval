<h2>Useful Photography Tip #12: Use an Old Polaroid Land Camera With Your 
Modern Speedlite Flash</h2>

<p></p> 
<p>As many of you know, we&rsquo;re fans of film here at The Phoblographer. 
Pretty much every staff member shoots with film at one time or another and we 
have a real feeling that all of photography&rsquo;s faces and mediums should be 
experienced in order for someone to find themselves and their identity. 
Personally, I&rsquo;m smitten with my Polaroid Land Camera 210. But it&rsquo;s 
limited in that I have pretty much no manual control over the shutter or 
aperture. In practice, that meant that I was shooting photos with some weird 
looks to them.</p> 
<p>And then I decided to start using a flash. I&rsquo;m smacking myself for 
not doing this earlier; as it&rsquo;s so easy to use and will immediately 
improve the quality of your images by tenfold.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Editor&rsquo;s Note: Thank you so much to my very good buddy 
Gabe Biderman for the Instant Film.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Gear Used</h2> 
<p>Polaroid Land Camera 210 (see our eBay banner on the sidebar if 
you&rsquo;re interested)</p> 
<p>Impact PC Male to Hot Shoe cable</p> 
<p>Canon 580 EX II</p> 
<p>Chris Gampat Hacked Beauty Dish</p> 
<p>Fujifilm 100-C Land Camera film or 3000-B</p> 
<h2>The Process</h2> 
<p>First off, attach the hot shoe to your flash with hacked beauty dish. Then 
connect the male end of the PC cord to the Polaroid Land Camera&rsquo;s PC 
female port: which is located on the front end of the camera not far from the 
lens. The lead image in this photo will give you a better idea.</p> 
<p>Set your flash to manual output: usually anywhere from 1/8th to full power 
is necessary. I usually work with 1/4 or 1/2 power.</p> 
<p>Cock the camera shutter, focus, and you&rsquo;re ready to shoot. Ensure 
that the cable and the beauty dish aren&rsquo;t in the framelines when you want 
to shoot.</p> 
<h2>Results</h2> 
<p>These scans aren&rsquo;t the best, they were done very quickly on my 
friend&rsquo;s Epson scanner.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I myself am also not the best scanner. I haven&rsquo;t done it since 
college to be honest, but here&rsquo;s my attempt.</p>
