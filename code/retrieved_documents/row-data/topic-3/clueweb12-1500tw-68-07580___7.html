<h1>Everything You Really Need to Know About Canon&rsquo;s Announcements at 
NAB 2012</h1> 
<p>by Chris Gampat on April 12, 2012</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>NAB is right around the corner, and Canon has taken to introducing loads of 
new products for the videography industry. We previously saw a prototype 4K 1D 
camera, and it has now been formally announced. Coined as the 1D C (for 
cinema), the new DSLR seems to take the cake as the current king of HDSLR 
cameras. With a full frame sensor, 60p Full HD video recording, and 4K 
capabilities, this seems like a winner&hellip;if you have $15,000 to burn.</p> 
<p>But wait, there&rsquo;s more!</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>EOS 1D C</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The 1D C seems to look just like a Canon 1D X. Here are the important specs:
</p> 
<p>- Video recording at 4K (4096 x 2160-pixel) or Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) 
resolution. 4K video is captured at an APS-H size though, so a 1.3x crop factor.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>- 18.1-megapixel full-frame 24mm x 36mm Canon CMOS sensor</p> 
<p>- The camera records 8-bit 4:2:2 Motion JPEG 4K video to the camera&rsquo;s 
CF memory card at 24 frames-per-second (fps) or Full HD 1920 x 1080 video at 
selectable frame rates from 24p to 60p.</p> 
<p>- Canon Log Gamma to enable the recording of high-quality video with rich 
gradation expression</p> 
<p>- Captured video (excluding 4K video) can be output from the camera&rsquo;s 
HDMI terminal to an external recorder using an uncompressed YCbCr 8-bit 4:2:2 
signal.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>- Optional Super 35mm sized crop recording.</p> 
<p>- ISO 100-51200</p> 
<p>- Dual DIGIC 5+ image processors</p> 
<p>- Shoots 12fps in still mode and 14fps with the mirror up</p> 
<p>- The Canon EOS-1D C digital SLR camera is scheduled to be available within 
2012 at a suggested retail price of $15,000.</p> 
<h2>C500</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>- 8.85-megapixel CMOS sensor</p> 
<p>- Available in PL mount and EF mount</p> 
<p>- 4K (4096 x 2160-pixel) resolution</p> 
<p>- 10-bit uncompressed RAW data stream with no de-Bayering</p> 
<p>- The camera offer the additional versatility of being able to output quad 
full-HD (3840 x 2160), 2K (2048 x 1080), full HD (1920 x 1080), and other 
imaging options.</p> 
<p>- All 4K formats can be selected to operate from one to 60 frames per second
</p> 
<p>- The cameras employ a 12-bit RGB 4:4:4 signal format during 2K output, 
which can be selected to operate from one to 60 frames-per-second (fps) as 
well. If switched to a 10-bit YCrCb 4:2:2 mode, the camera can operate up to 
120 fps.</p> 
<p>- The Cinema EOS C500 simultaneously records in-camera a 50 Mbps HD proxy 
video to a CF card that is immediately available to support offline editing.</p>
<p>- No word on pricing yet. <em><strong>UPDATE: May be around $30,000!
</strong></em></p> 
<h2>New Zoom and Prime Lenses for Cinema</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>- The CN-E15.5-47mm T2.8 L S* (for EF mounts)</p> 
<p>- CN-E15.5-47mm T2.8 L SP* (for PL mounts)</p> 
<p>&ndash; the CN-E30-105mm T2.8 L S* (for EF mounts)</p> 
<p>- CN-E30-105mm T2.8 L SP* (for PL mounts).</p> 
<p><strong>From the Press release:</strong> &ldquo;The new Canon XJ80x8.8B and 
XJ76x9B HD field lenses combine augmented telephoto and wide-angle performance. 
The premium XJ80x8.8B lens delivers an 80x zoom with a maximum wide angle of 
8.8mm (a horizontal angle-of-view of 57.2 degrees), which is approximately five 
percent wider than previous long-zoom lenses. These capabilities enable the 
XJ80x8.8B to capture everything from a panoramic stadium-wide shot to a 
telephoto close-up of an individual player&rsquo;s face. The XJ80x8.8B&rsquo;s 
wide-angle capabilities enable the lens to pull back from a telephoto shot and 
replace it with a dramatic close-up &ndash; thus adding to creative 
flexibilities.&rdquo;</p>
