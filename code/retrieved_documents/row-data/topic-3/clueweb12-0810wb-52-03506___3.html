<h2> So Close&nbsp;Canon </h2> Wednesday, September 17, 2008 at 12:29AM <br>

<p><br>
The 5D MkII has been officially announced, and the features match most 
of what was rumored, including a 1080p movie mode.</p> 
<p>At 30 frames per second.</p> 
<p>Remember how I said how stunning it was that Nikon chose 24 fps for the D90
&rsquo;s D-Movies? How it could have so easily been anything else? How if Canon 
came out with a movie-shooting DSLR that shot 30p I&rsquo;d be less than 
thrilled?</p> 
<p>Well it&rsquo;s worse than that. Because a 5D that shot 24p at full HD 
resolution would have been a very important camera. For Canon to have come so 
close and botched that one detail is almost unbearable.</p> 
<p>Maybe we can get Canon to offer a 24 fps mode in a future firmware update. 
Someone point me at Canon&rsquo;s headquarters. I need to stand on their lawn 
with a boombox over my head.</p> 
<p>UPDATE: Featured Comment from Joe:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I sometimes think that Canon has a pathological fear of true 24P. They have 
avoided serious contention to bethe Indy filmmaker&rsquo;s video camera year 
after year because of this.</p> 
<p>30P is not only useless in relation to 24P (and film) -<br>
it is actually 
dangerous.</p> </blockquote> 65 Comments | Email This  | Pimp This <br>

<h3>Reader Comments (65) </h3> 
<p>I'd have to agree with you on that. I'm waiting to read some kind of 
technical/practical justification as to why they chose 30p, but I can't help 
but feel disappointed as a video-shooting Canon DSLR user who has been 
anticipating a solid answer to the D90.<br>
<br>
They say it's geared toward 
photojournalists and wedding videographers. Those of you out there who are, 
what do you think of their choice to go 30p?</p>  September 17, 2008 | Aaron 
<br> 
<p>Very true, Stu, very true. So close. I'm still hoping for a European 
version with 1080 25p - but of course I strongly doubt they would be that 
clever. Then again, I don't know if European HD TV Sets work with 1080 30p and 
that might be a problem for Canon. I guess that only the final reviews will be 
able to tell.</p>  September 17, 2008 | DanyX <br>

<p>I hear you brother...<br>
<br>
I started reading down the stats page and 
saw 1080p and smiled and then saw 30fps and it all but disappeared.</p>  
September 17, 2008 | Frank <br>

<p>My thoughts exactly as I was reading through the specs this morning. 30p 
stuck out like a sore, swollen thumb. As soon as I read that I thought &quot;I 
bet Stu M. has something to say about this...&quot;. Sure enough...</p>  
September 17, 2008 | Ian Hay <br>

<p>Too bad its 30p. ;(<br>
But I'm still curios how the HD video is generated. 
Does the camera uses the full sensor or just the inner 1920x1080 pixels? If it 
uses just the inner pixels it must be hard to get a wide angle shot. And what 
would happen to the dof? Would be great if you have some answers!<br>
<br>
PS: 
this is a great blog! just found it after reading your book, which I also liked 
a lot and gave me great ideas! Thanks!</p>  September 17, 2008 | Anton <br>

<p>What's the exact downside of 30p? Isn't it somehow possible to convert it 
to 24p?</p>  September 17, 2008 | emotional-stuntman <br>

<p>What's gutting to me is the data-rate of the video. Presuming they are 
using interframe compression, if they would just bump it up 25% to 50Mbps 
(which a CF card should be able to handle) then a few more HD channels should 
consider it an acceptable HD acquisition device.</p>  September 17, 2008 | Saul 
<br> 
<p>It seems like there is no manual exposure or shutter speed control. <br>

<br>I just love that it records in Quicktime instead of AVI. It also has an 
external mic option which I seriously doubt I would use but options are better 
than no options.<br>
<br>
I am just loving this DSLR video revolution 
happening. Long time coming.<br>
<br>
Are you still getting the Panasonic LX3? 
Are you getting the Nikon D90 or waiting for the Canon 5DMK2?</p>  September 
17, 2008 | Ajit Anthony Prem <br>

<p>They surely don't want to compete against their 1080p professional 
videocameras... :S<br>
<br>
But hopefully there'll be a hacked firmware sooner 
or later that will do the trick :D</p>  September 17, 2008 | the_amo <br>

<p>I sometimes think that Canon has a pathological fear of true 24P. They have 
avoided serious contention to be _the_ Indy filmmaker's video camera year after

<p>Not that I have a lot of experience shooting 24fps but seems the 
conventional wisdom is that the industry is just caught up in the &quot;film 
look&quot; of 24p. It suffers with any panning or movement. Much better to 
shoot 30fps and convert in your edit app.</p>  September 17, 2008 | The MacDaddy
<br> 
<p>I have no Probs with 30 fps. If you can also use 24. 30 would be great for 
some not-so-slow-motion :-)<br>
<br>
But I think I'll stay at my Scarlet-choice.
<br><br>
george</p>  September 17, 2008 | George P.Schnyder <br>

<p>Joe, you hit the nail on the head.<br>
<br>
The Macdaddy, your inexperience 
shows. Converting 30p to 24p is a mess.</p>  September 17, 2008 | Stu <br>

<p>Technically, it should be Canon standing on your front lawn with the 
boombox, because they should be trying to get you back. And the boombox should 
be playing a parody of &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; with lyrics about updating it 
to 24p. It's 6 frames less for cryin' out loud! How hard can it be, Canon?!?!?
</p>  September 17, 2008 | DJ Smack Mackey <br>

<p>We need to start a grassroots movement to get Canon to wake up and realize 
how big of a blunder this is. Everyone (and I mean everyone) should write Canon 
insisting that they address this in a firmware upgrade (if that's even 
possible). On the other hand, this leaves the door wide open for Nikon and 
others. Is it possible we'll see a D800 soon with 1080/24p and external audio 
inputs?<br>
<br>
Based on some D90 footage I've seen recently which shows how 
evil the &quot;rolling shutter&quot; artifacts can be, I'm not totally 
convinced that DSLRs are the best option for indie filmmaking (and especially 
in cases with camera tracking for VFX). But if you plan and shoot carefully, 
the resulting footage could be really sweet.</p>  September 17, 2008 | prosckes

My thoughts on this are as follows:<br>
<br>
1. This camera 
is targeted towards ENG<br>
<br>
2. Because of ENG, most if not all U.S.A. 
newsrooms have a huge investment in 30 FPS as a standard of their edit bays.<br>
3. The real Killer DSLR will have a dual HD mode switch, go from 30 FPS down to 
24 FPS .<br>
4. As for panning, I think we have gotten way to many tools in the 
tool box. Learning to do lock down setups may prove to be a great experience, 
so when we get to a non shearing image DSLR we will have learned the fine art 
of less is more.<br>
5. Is keiretsu still the norm in Japan? If so this may 
also explain the 30 FPS of the Canon.<br>
<br>
more thoughts later, especially 
on using still images as reference points for a HD content shoot<br>
<br>

Laurence</p>  September 17, 2008 | Laurence <br>

<p>Canon and Sony simply can't afford to jeopardize their pro video divisions; 
especially Sony.<br>
<br>
Being green to video probably explains why the Nikon 
D90 and not D700 was the first to have video capabilities.</p>  September 17, 
2008 | Makea <br>

<p>It's too bad divisions at these types of companies don't talk to one 
another (i.e. still and the video teams). Then again maybe they did and wanted 
to avoid it eating into their video sales.<br>
<br>
It's sad that after all 
these years of pushing for 24p that many companies still don't get it and don't 
see the potential for sales and products for filmmakers.<br>
<br>
They tend to 
consider it a small niche market when it's much larger than that.</p>  
September 17, 2008 | Scott Squires <br>

<p>Wow, how awful.<br>
<br>
Perhaps they are waiting to pop it on their 1d so 
they can charge another 4 grand for it.<br>
<br>
I hope Red or Nikons next 
offering's really stick it up Canons...</p>  September 17, 2008 | Casey James 
Basichis <br>

<p>I just cant even begin to imagine how the 5DII with 24p could be any sort 
of competition for their dedicated motion cameras. I own well over $20k in 
Canon still equipment - with 4 bodies from 20D to 1DsII and glass - and neither 
this nor any other DSLR with 24p will be my motion choice.<br>
<br>
I think 
they made a blunder, but not that bad of one.<br>
<br>
I think they need to 
give their still bodies a kick in the pants so Nikon doesn't surpass them and 
they need to give their motion cams a kick in the pants to catch back up with 
Panasonic. Dont waste the time on the hybrid poo. (Or if you are going to waste 
the time, do it right.)</p>  September 17, 2008 | Brian <br>

<p>As I also wrote elsewhere:<br>
<br>
&quot;DPReview has some info about the 
format the 5D-MII shoots: h.264 at 38mbps, full 1080/30p, PCM uncompressed 
audio, in the MOV container. Unfortunately, that 30p is either 30.00 fps or a 
variable of 30.xxx fps, instead of NTSC's standard 29.97. This means that an 
editor like Sony Vegas will resample by default, and this creates extreme 
ghosting in the final export (unless you manually disable resampling in all 
your clips in the timeline -- something that not all video editors support).<br>
<br>Canon should have done the right thing: selectable frame rates at <b>exactly
</b> 29.97, 25.00, 24.00 and 23.976.<br>
<br>
To me, as an final step editor 
(rather than a shooter), this is my main complain. It makes editing and final 
quality much harder than it should be.&quot;</p>  September 17, 2008 | Eugenia 
<br> 
<p>I get the feeling that the industry doesn&acute;t like indy film makers.<br>
<br>Most of the camcorders, they produce for an affordable price lack of nice 
manual control or other options which are important for being creative. Even my 
old VHS-C Panasonic MC5 camcorder had more manuel control than the most 
toycorder out there.<br>
<br>
They are targeting at normal consumers who just 
want to point and shoot without getting into technics, or the cameras are so 
much expensive, that they are out of questions for low budget filmmaking.<br>

<br>It&acute;s a shame, that there is no acceptable inbetween solution!</p>  
September 17, 2008 | Martin Kulig <br>

<p>Martin. Just out of curiosity: how much did that VHS-C camera cost?<br>

When I was 12 my parents bought a sony v100 Prosumer video 8 camera. Which was 
I think about 2800 dollars. Then later they bought the Prosumer Hi-8 camera 
V5000. Which was about 2800 dollars. Now if I want to buy a Prosumer HD 
camcorder, with manual controls I'll still spend about 2800 dollars. So nothing 
much has changed.<br>
Also I think those manual controls weren't put on there 
to please the customers, but because doing everything in chips/circuitry was 
way too expensive back then. Autofocus of our video8 camera was nowhere near as 
good as modern cameras, so you need a manual option to override.<br>
I think 
the situation has reversed since then. Chips/circuitry aer really cheap now, 
while building manual controls into cameras calls for more moving parts, more 
broken units etc. So it does make sense I guess. It's just no good for indy 
filmmakers. (although I doubt much good came from your VHS-C on the indyfilm 
front) :-)</p>  September 17, 2008 | ShadowMaker SdR <br>

<p>I really think, and this is a sad corporate truth, that someone in the 
marketing engine decided to not &quot;cannibalize&quot; their other cams of any 
size and assumed 30fps is better than 24 since you could always &quot;go down 
to 24 in post,&quot; and that people would be excited by &quot;more frames per 
second.&quot; i also echo the concern above of how the 1080 is chopped out of 
the 21mp sensor and how that windowing will affect the image, jellywobble and 
DOF.</p>  September 17, 2008 | jdiamond <br>

<p>I&acute;m totally aware that i can not expect full functionality and 
quality of a professional filmcamera build into a consumer camcorder.<br>
I 
just followed the whole d90 threads and was in the beginning very euphoric 
about these fascinating first videos i saw.<br>
<br>
Maybe there is bad 
compression, lack of a microphone jack and what else, but i really thought, it 
could be a very cool compromise.<br>
<br>
My dream was over, when i saw the 
first wobble movies, result of the bad rolling shutter which was a dealbreaker 
for me.<br>
<br>
You are right, the VHS-C was quite expensive those days, but 
it was affordable.<br>
We have the technology today, to build just the right 
cameras, why don&acute;t we?</p>  September 17, 2008 | Martin Kulig <br>

<p>I am over impressed with the new specs for this Still camera and I find the 
1080 30p gimmick pretty lame. When we shot 35mm film in still cameras and 35mm 
in motion cameras, we did not expect to have one camera to shoot stills and 
motion. While I desire 1 camera to rule them all, I'm not sure if it will come 
to pass for 5 yrs. Still at 30p they have insured the lame uselessness of this 
camera's video abilities.</p>  September 17, 2008 | Trinity <br>

<p>If anyone will do this right.. it's going to be Jim Jannard or some other 
&quot;outsider&quot;.<br>
<br>
The specs we want as &quot;potential&quot; indie 
filmmakers are just not in the target marketing brackets of the major DSLR or 
HD cam players.<br>
<br>
But I can really appreciate the DLSR getting all 
&quot;in the face&quot; of a movie acquisition device. It totally makes sense 
to slap in 24fps capture on a DLSR that can use the lenses we already have. And 
at that $1k sweet spot.</p>  September 17, 2008 | Matt <br>

Footage 
doesn't look too bad. Note that it's all locked off though... Wondering if it's 
as &quot;skewy&quot; as the D90.</p>  September 18, 2008 | Ben Cain <br>

<p>Just wondering if anyone has any opinions on the 5D Mark II as a dSLR and 
not a video camera? Since it is a camera for still photography primarily and 
the video seems more like a gimmicky selling point. Anyone?</p>  September 18, 
2008 | Joe <br>

<p>&quot;One small detail recording format as well: <br>
<br>
Nikon D90 shoots 
M-JPEG (nice intra-frame compression).<br>
<br>
Canon 5D Mark II shoots only 
H.264, AFAIS. Bad, nasty, evil codec. (For production.)&quot;<br>
<br>
That's a 
pretty ignorant comment based on assumptions without knowing the details.<br>

<br>The Nikon uses a really low bitrate (averaging somewhere between 11-20mbs) 
on a much less efficient &quot;nice intra-frame compression&quot; system.<br>

<br>The fact that Canon uses nearly 40mbs on a codec light years ahead of MJPEG 
in terms of efficiency with at least twice the bit rate means its going to look 
a helluva lot cleaner.<br>
<br>
Avocade--have you seen raw footage from the 
D-90? Lots of quantization blocks even on nearly static scenes. Ugh...but hey, 
it's 24P!! WEEEE!<br>
<br>
I think it's obvious that Canon was protecting its 
pro video products by not including 24p, but who knows? I think there may be 
another shoe to drop here, and you know that they will probably add 
&quot;step-up&quot; features in their replacements for the 1D and 1 Ds.<br>
<br>
I happen to think that 30p is fine for narrative. It's not the same as 60p or 
60i in terms of brain response to temporal sampling. It's still not 
&quot;live&quot; looking and can feel filmic, in terms of being 
&quot;cinematic&quot;.<br>
<br>
I happen to think there are going to be some 
amazing 30p films made with this camera that get into Sundance, etc.</p>  
September 18, 2008 | Barlow and Lannie <br>

<p>And what happens when those 30p films that got into Sundance get 
distribution deals? They'll need a film print at 24 fps. Someone will have to 
convert, which is a mess. You may like 30p, and that's fine (although I can't 
think of any successful examples of 30p narrative for you to like), but it's a 
neither-here-nor-there frame rate both aesthetically and technically. I've seen 
filmmakers crushed by the ramifications of trying to strike film prints and 
create deliverables for a 30p film that got some attention. This is what Joe's 
&quot;30p is dangerous&quot; comment is about. The slightly-more-film-like look 
of 30p in their (probably Canon) DV camera seduced them, they used it, and then 
the time came for a film print and they were screwed.<br>
<br>
Anyone who has 
The Guide can always refer back to my rant on the evils of 30p. That doesn't 
mean that you're wrong for liking it on a personal level, but 30p is not a 
substitute for 24p. It has a very different look and huge limitations for 
distribution.</p>  September 18, 2008 | Stu <br>

<p>Stu,<br>
<br>
Very good points, of course, and let me backtrack a little. 
<br><br>
The reality is that just almost no ultra-low budget indie films ever 
see theatrical distribution. Right here in Salt Lake City, a good deal of 
theatres have switched to all digital projection, which could easily accomodate 
30p content.<br>
<br>
I'm sure we're still quite a ways away from a massive 
switch to digital theatres, but it's coming, and not a moment too soon in my 
book. I almost exclusively see my Hollywood movies at digital theatres--the 
quality is easily superior and doesn't degrade over time.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I 
think more about the internet and Blu-ray distribution, which is the reality 
for most indies with a dream and some balls.<br>
<br>
I just finished a 
corporate video that we did &quot;cinematic&quot; style, shot on an HVX at 720p 
29.97, and used a Brevis 35mm adapter with Nikon and Canon glass.<br>
<br>

Here's a rough cut segment I posted on vimeo some time ago:
http://vimeo.com/1647785<br>
<br>
I recommend downloading the original QT on 
the lower part of the page.<br>
<br>
I showed that piece at a local filmmaker 
gathering/festival on an HD projector, and no one who saw it afterwards asked 
if it was 30p. They just said it looked great.<br>
<br>
Like everyone else, I'm 
bummed that Canon would intentionally gimp the 5D MKII's HD, but I see all the 
advantages and say HELL YEAH!! Dynamic range alone is worth it to me. I'm sure 
more and better will come.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<p>but wait... isn't this still a 'still' camera? Why would you use (buy) a 
still camera to do anything other than shoot stills? Personally I'm buying this 
camera (with an impressive STILL track record) for shooting stills.<br>
<br>

When I want a camera to shoot HD, I'll then beg, borrow or buy a RED.</p>  
September 18, 2008 | nybe <br>

<p>Stu. You're right that 30P gives a lot of trouble for distribution.<br>
In 
theaters.<br>
But for the web, where I still tend to watch shorts on my 60hz 
monitor. Or a Direct to DVD release where 60hz (or a multiple of it) is still a 
big thing 30p will probably be just fine.<br>

<p>To all of you for whom 30p is &quot;just fine,&quot; congratulations. You 
have many cameras to chose from including this very enticing new option from 
Canon. But for some of us, 30p is as useless as a garage door that's three 
inches too narrow for our car.</p>  September 18, 2008 | Stu <br>

<p>@5tu - You mentioned a firmware upgrade... is that possible? thx [m]</p>

<p>It's not that I think 30p is as good as having 24p, due to the fact that we 
have about a century of conditioning about movies and what the motion should 
look like, but I think it's not gonna be as much of a problem for distribution 
as it once was.<br>
<br>
Question: If suddenly most theatres were digital, 
would you still consider 30p to be useless for narrative cinema?<br>
<br>
I 
still think more is to come from Canon and others in response to RED, but I 
happen to see the cup half full on this issue. It's disappointing that it isn't 
the BIG BANG camera every indie dreams of, but it's also a nice indicator of 
things to come.<br>
<br>
For cryin' out load, it's a high ISO, full-frame DSLR 
with a crazy new HD mode.<br>
<br>
Reminds me of the old &quot;frame mode&quot; 
mania when the XL1 came out, but now everyone's spoiled.<br>
<br>
Maybe the 
european version of the 5D MKII will have 25p and resourceful indies will find 
a way to get one in the U.S.</p>  September 18, 2008 | Barlow and Lannie <br>

<p>30p looks like video to me, so yes, personally I would find it useless. As 
digital projection becomes more prevalent, projection frame rate might become a 
creative choice. I will always choose 24p.<br>
<br>
Here's a direct quote from 
The DV Rebel's Guide on the subject:<br>
<br>
&quot;30p is not 24p. It sounds 
close, but it&rsquo;s significantly different. Think of it this way&mdash;30p 
is 25% more frames per second than 30p. If you could get a 25% discount on a 
new 24p camera, you&rsquo;d take it right? Now does 25% sound like a big 
difference? Quite simply, your audience will be able to tell that your 
&ldquo;film&rdquo; was shot on video if you shoot 30p instead of 24p.&quot;<br>

<br>We're no longer talking about anything technical here, but rather about a 
filmmaker's creative choice. I hate the way 30p looks and I love 24p. That is 
my preference as a filmmaker, and it is a fervent one. 30p is only of interest 
to me as an overcrank speed for 24 fps playback.</p>  September 18, 2008 | Stu

<p>24P or bust</p>  September 18, 2008 | John <br>

<p>I just think that 24p isn't the end-all-be-all. Don't get me wrong, it's 
preferable for filmmaking, but I think 35mm DOF is far more impactful on 
cinematic storytelling than the perceived difference between 24p and 30p.<br>

<br>It's funny that filmmakers are complaining about a DSLR that had 
rudimentary HD video functionality thrown in as a bonus.</p>  September 18,

<p>We are complaining, because it meant hope to have something usefull which 
is affordable otherwhise nobody would&acute;t care at all.</p>  September 18,

<p>JOE: I never had the need to upgrade from the 1DsII to the III. With the 
5D, however, once I see test images, I may just get the 5DII. I'll have to see 
how those extra pixels affect image quality. And no, I will not use the motion 
mode beyond a test or two.<br>
<br>
BARLOW: Your doc looks nice, but it looks 
like VIDEO on TV. Not like a narrative film should look.<br>
<br>
Also to 
Barlow: You ask why people are complainging about the camera throwing HD video 
in as a bonus? Isnt it obvious that no one is knocking the CAMERA? They are 
knocking the choice in FRAME RATE for the HD video.</p>  September 18, 2008 |

<p>Brian: I appreciate your comments and I understand what you mean, I just 
differ about the acceptability of 30p for filmmaking. I don't mind the slightly 
smoother look of the frame rate--it still doesn't look live, just a teensy bit 
smoother than 24p.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm on of those oddball types that sees all 
sorts of possibilities when we're talking about unheard of dynamic range and 
DOF for HD at that pricepoint.<br>
<br>
I can see lots of History channel and 
Discovery HD stuff being shot with it, despite the fact that it's a DSLR and 
not the usual HD ENG camera like a Varicam or F900.</p>  September 18, 2008 |

<p>Hey stu, this is mr. kulig<br>
<br>
Yeah I would put the lack of 24p right 
up there with the lack of a larger than 3 exposure autobracket with a -2/+2 
range.<br>
<br>
I think they just don't consider professional film fx use when 
they are decide on all these things. I wonder how the ergonmics play out while 
shooting video and adjusting settings.<br>
<br>
Despite the lack of 24p, it 
still has my interest. To be able to use my lenses while shooting video... 
would be awesome.</p>  September 18, 2008 | Brain <br>
