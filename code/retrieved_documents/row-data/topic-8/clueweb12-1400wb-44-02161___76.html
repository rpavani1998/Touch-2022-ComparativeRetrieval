<h2>Gosling Didn&rsquo;t Get The Memo&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2> By Ryan Tomayko under 
Then they fight you... on 12. March 2006 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been blissfully neglecting this site for months with the 
assumption that a large part of our goal was completed. After watching good 
people likeMartin LaMonica and Jon Udell balance out the mainstream tech press 
with coverage of lessish tools and languages,<em>and</em> having seen forward 
looking companies likeRedMonk inject themselves into the traditional analyst 
racket with smart, honest, and unignorable critique,<em>and</em> having seen 
herds of Java luminaries migrate to simpler, more agile tools and languages,<em>
and</em> after hearing Bill Gates say that less code was the only metric, <em>
and</em> having watched David, Bill, Ian, Adrian, Phillip, Aristotle, Harry, 
Mark, Mark, Chad, Curt, James and <em>many</em> other extremely talented 
programmers dismantle all the common hollow arguments for superfluous 
complexity and replace them with simple methodologies and<em>working code</em>, 
after all that I just figured there wasn&rsquo;t much to do around here.</p> 
<p>But I completely forgot about James Gosling:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;There have been a number of language[s] coming up lately,&rdquo; 
noted James Gosling today at Sun&rsquo;s World Wide Education &amp; Research 
Conference in New York City when asked if Java was in any kind of danger from 
the newcomers. &ldquo;PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems,&rdquo; he 
continued, &ldquo;but they are scripting languages and get their power through 
specialization: they just generate web pages. But none of them attempt any 
serious breadth in the application domain and they both have really serious 
scaling and performance problems.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>We&rsquo;ll get back to that in a second.</p> 
<p>I believe that a majority of people in IT now consider dynamic languages 
like Perl, Ruby, Python, and PHP to be very much capable of sitting at the 
table with Java and .NET for a wide range of common technical problems. 
Similarly, straight-forward systems like REST, Microformats, and Atom are 
generally considered legitimate alternatives to the vendor/analyst/press 
peddled technologies like WS-* for a wide range of integration issues. In other 
words, I could walk into most shops during a technology evaluation and put 
these technologies on the table as legitimate considerations without being too 
worried about being laughed out of the room. This is not to claim superiority 
for a given task, just that the competitive playing field is beginning to level 
off.</p> 
<p>This was not the case last year at this time, so what happened? Something 
must have changed. None of these technologies underwent huge feature or 
stability increases in the past year. I&rsquo;m unaware of any breakthrough in 
scaling these systems past what they&rsquo;re already capable of. There have 
been some improvements in running dynamic languages on the mainstream VMs, 
which many predicted would lead to quick acceptance, but that&rsquo;s not it 
either. So what changed?</p> 
<p>Minds changed. Respectful debate, honesty, passion, and working systems 
created an environment that not even the most die-hard enterprise architect 
could ignore, no matter how buried in Java design patterns. Those who placed 
technical excellence and pragmaticism above religious attachment and vendor 
cronyism were easily convinced of the benefits that broadening their definition 
of acceptable technologies could bring.</p> 
<p>The people who are still unconvinced are those that just don&rsquo;t care 
or are too lazy to spend a small amount of time researching and validating the 
arguments, which brings us back nicely to James Gosling&rsquo;s recent 
statements.</p> 
<h3>On The Current Quantity of Language</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;There have been a number of language[s]</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This part is notable because it&rsquo;s actually true. There have, in fact, 
been<em>some</em> number of languages. While I stand steadfastly by 
James&rsquo; analysis of the current quantity of language, we will quickly 
diverge in opinion from here.</p> 
<p>A quick note to aspiring Java pundits: play close attention to the next few 
statements. While none of them have any basis in reality, they have proven 
sufficient in creating fear and uncertainty in the minds of those who are 
evaluating these technologies.</p> 
<h3>On &ldquo;Scripting Languages&rdquo;</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems,&rdquo; he continued, 
&ldquo;but they are scripting languages</p> </blockquote> 
<p>James pulled this directly out of &ldquo;Effective Java Advocacy 
Beans&rdquo;, section 6.8.3 &ldquo;Dealing with questions on dynamic 
languages&rdquo;:</p> 
<p>First, call anything not statically compiled a &ldquo;scripting 
language&rdquo;. Attempt to insinuate that all languages without an explicit 
compilation step are not to be taken seriously and that they are all 
equivalently shitty. Best results are achieved when you provide no further 
explanation of the pros and cons of static and dynamic compilation and/or 
typing and instead allow the reader to simply assume that there are a wealth of 
benefits and very few, if any, disadvantages to static compilation. While the 
benefits of dynamic languages&ndash;first realized millions of years ago in 
LISP and Smalltalk&ndash;are well understood in academia, IT managers and Sun 
certified developers are perfectly accepting of our static = professional / 
dynamic = amateurish labeling scheme.</p> 
<p>This technique is also known to result in dynamic language advocates going 
absolute bat-shit crazy and making complete fools of themselves. There have 
been no fewer than three head explosions recorded as a result of this technique.
</p> 
<p>Also, avoid the term &ldquo;dynamic language&rdquo; at all cost. It&rsquo;s 
important that the reader not be exposed to the concepts separating<strong>
scripting languages</strong> like bash, MS-DOS batch, and perl-in-the-eighties 
from general purpose<strong>dynamic languages</strong> like Ruby, Python, 
Smalltalk, and Perl present day.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve tried our best to clear up any ambiguity related to the term 
&ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; in the past:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Wikipedia: Scripting Language describes the difference between specialized 
scripting languages and general purpose dynamic languages.</li> 
<li>The State of the Scripting Universe Van Rossum, Thomas, Hobbs, Conway, 
Pall weigh in on this misconception and others.</li> 
<li>Web Dominated by J2EE? is a rant on an article spreading the same 
misinformation.</li> 
<li>Arrogance, ignorance, and a blinding Sun is David Heinemeier Hanson 
correcting the same misinformation somewhere else.</li> 
<li>RADlab, scripting and scale, a blog entry by Gosling saying the exact same 
stuff and a comment thread full of people correcting Gosling&rsquo;s dated 
evaluation of dynamic languages.</li> </ul> 
<h3>On &ldquo;They Just Generate Web Pages&rdquo;</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p>and get their power through specialization: they just generate web pages. 
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Gosling shows his ignorance regarding the current feature set provided by 
dynamic languages and what people are using them for. A cursory glance over
rubyforge.org&rsquo;s project tree reveals that the number of projects that 
&ldquo;just generate web pages&rdquo; are really quite small: 151 of 1,342 
total projects are registered underInternet::WWW/HTTP::Dynamic Content and many 
of those projects are related to using the web (HTTP/URIs) as a platform for 
integration more than they are for &ldquo;generating web pages&rdquo;. I expect 
Perl and Python break down even wider.</p> 
<p><em>Update</em>: Seo Sanghyeon provides a list of popular Python related 
applications that have nothing to do with generating web content.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to note that exposing resource representations via 
HTTP/URLs has been moving into areas other than &ldquo;generating web 
pages&rdquo;. This was the plan when HTTP was originally designed but has only 
recently begun to really catch on. Specialization and enhanced capabilities 
related to generating and serving hyper-media over HTTP are and will continue 
to increase in value. The web server is becoming a key piece of integration 
infrastructure. What James refers to as &ldquo;generating web pages&rdquo; is 
now a general purpose technique for exposing resources to anything outside of 
the application process.</p> 
<h3>On &ldquo;breadth of application domain&rdquo;</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p>But none of them attempt any serious breadth in the application domain </p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to determine what kind of breadth is missing when you 
consider the capabilities provided by modern dynamic language environments, the 
platforms they run on, and the extensions and bridges that allow them to use 
damn near any other program or library available. James uses the example of 
&ldquo;interplanetary navigation&rdquo;, which is a really good example except 
that it isn&rsquo;t; most of us aren&rsquo;t working at NASA and those of us 
who are working at NASA are doing things like trying to get the payroll and 
accounting systems working together or building simple productivity 
applications. Gosling seems bent on meeting the needs of the 20% while leaving 
the 80% with a platform that&rsquo;slosing bids to dynamic/agile shops.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of power I do not envy&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Lastly, Peter Yared (former Sun hacker) and the rest of the folks over at 
ActiveGrid should also be interested to learn that no one is attempting to 
widen the viability of dynamic languages in the &ldquo;application 
domain&rdquo;.</p> 
<h3>On Scaling and Performance</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p>and they both have really serious scaling and performance problems.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>It is simply not possible for me to add anything to the massive set of 
material addressing this topic.</p>

<li>Large Scale PHP</li>

<li>RailsExpress.blog</li> </ul> 
<h3>Why people are upset</h3> 
<p>There have been multiple responses to Gosling&rsquo;s statements ranging in 
sentiment from outrage to amusement:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Curt Hibbs: It&rsquo;s sad, James Gosling is clueless</li> 
<li>Chad Fowler: Gosling Thinks Ruby Just Generates Web Pages</li> 
<li>David Heinemeier Hansson: Pay no attention to the heathens and 
Distinguishing power from versatility</li> 
<li>Assaf: James Gosling Explains what&rsquo;s wrong with Java</li> 
<li>James Robertson: The Static Empire gets Nervous</li> 
<li>Frank Wiles: Seriously funny</li> </ul> 
<p>All we&rsquo;re asking is that you stop spreading misinformation about the 
current state of dynamic languages to the press, analysts, and your customers. 
This does not require you to champion or otherwise support these technologies 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; just stop lying about them. One year ago, this type of 
behavior could be attributed to a lack of documentation and discussion on these 
issues, today it&rsquo;s impossible to attribute to anything but malice.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t downplay the &rsquo;scripting&rsquo; aspect, Ryan. 
Scripting is exactly what scares the shit out of Gosling and other application 
evangelists.</p> 
<p>A script is <em>not</em> an application. And that&rsquo;s exactly where 
it&rsquo;s strength lies.</p> 
<p>This is similar to how spreadsheets used to scare the shit out of people 
who based their careers on building financial applications. Eventually, they 
were forced to accept the fact that non-application specialists are going to 
take over and do their own financial shit using spreadsheets. They had to learn 
to move on.</p> 
<p>Gosling is keeping his head in the sand. Even the hypothetical future 
interplanetary staff, which he dragged in as his crown argument, will be 
writing scripts instead on relying on statically typed Java applications to 
guide them while they hurl through the space.</p>

<p>Fredrik:</p> 
<p>Goslings comments was the funniest thing i&rsquo;ve read this year. I have 
a feeling that &ldquo;interplanetary navigation&rdquo; will become some kind of 
standing joke/meme. We are now free to dismiss<em>any</em> technology that 
lacks &ldquo;interplanetary navigation&rdquo; features.</p> 
<p>I think this applet is the closest anyone have gotten to actually do 
&ldquo;interplanetary navigation&rdquo; in java.</p> 
<p>Seriously though. James Gosling is a troll. No reason to waste time on him, 
other than for the amusement value. Besides, he doesn&rsquo;t do 
&ldquo;interplanetary navigation&rdquo; so nobody in their right mind would 
take him seriously.</p> 
<p> comment at 12. March 2006 </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>assaf:</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind if Gosling uses &ldquo;scripting languages&rdquo;. 
Beyond the buzz and fud, scripting and dynamic are just features of the 
language. Features themselves are not that important.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s important? Can do vs. get it done. Java can do. PHP, Ruby, 
Python, get it done.</p> 
<p>Interplanetary navigation is still a dream of a far off future. Serving Web 
pages is the meat of Internet applications, enterprise applications, software 
as a service. It&rsquo;s where most of the development is taking place.</p> 
<p>If you only remember one thing, that Java is about interplanetary 
navigation, not serving Web pages, that&rsquo;s enough to summarize everything 
that&rsquo;s wrong with Java.</p>

<p>erikh:</p> 
<p>I still think that all of this language war stuff is malarky. Many 
languages fill very well-defined (or in some cases, better performing) domains 
and should be used there. Really, what programmer is worth his salt that only 
knows and writes in one language? Nitpicking over (relatively) vague terms like 
&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; and &ldquo;applications&rdquo; seems like something 
that belongs in a marketing conference or board room than in any technical 
discussion whatsoever.</p> 
<p>What I guess amazes me more is that someone like Gosling, with his 
education and apparent experience, is so worried about having his Ivory Tower 
renovated, has resorted to the technical equivalent of ad hominem attacks.</p>

<p>Alex said:</p>

<p>Yes, but there&rsquo;s an important distinction that&rsquo;s not being made 
here. There are languages specialized for a certain task that are incapable of 
being used for anything else. I think<code>bash</code> is a good example of a 
specialized &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo;.<code>bash</code> is for chaining 
commands together. That doesn&rsquo;t make it bad, it just makes it limited to 
that specific problem domain. Which, again, is perfectly fine and correct and 
the best possible way of performing that task. I wouldn&rsquo;t want it any 
other way.</p> 
<p>But Ruby, Python, Perl, Smalltalk, etc. are not specialized scripting 
languages. They are general purpose programming languages. I believe one of the 
reasons the term &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; has stuck with them is 
partially because it&rsquo;s become so common to create mini-languages (i.e. 
DSLs) in dynamic languages that are specialized for certain tasks. So 
it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to separate the specialized pieces from the general 
purpose pieces. Contrast that with static languages, where you are forced to 
create a completely separate &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; when you need to 
provide a constrained/specialized language (this is why XML is used so heavily 
in Java for things like O/R mapping, dependency injection, configuration, build 
processes, etc. &mdash; XML is Java&rsquo;s scripting language). In dynamic 
languages, you are generally not required to leave the core language to get 
that specialization: you use techniques like meta-programming and DSLs or just 
include/require/use some designated file at a designated point and let it do 
it&rsquo;s thing with the API.</p> 
<p>Using a general purpose language but extending it in places that would 
traditionally require &ldquo;scripting&rdquo; is the fundamental design 
principal behind Rails, Django, TG, Seaside, etc.</p> 
<p>When someone unfamiliar with modern dynamic languages and experienced in 
Java hears someone say, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re scripting languages, and get their 
power through specialization,&rdquo; they are being misled into thinking that 
these languages are like<code>bash</code> and can be used only for a single 
specialized scenarios, which is obvious not the case: they can be contrained 
and specialized as much or as little as required and become useful in<em>
multiple</em> specialized scenarios. That&rsquo;s really important.</p> 
<p>Now, what I&rsquo;m not entirely sure about is where PHP fits in all this. 
PHP was originally very much specialized for generating web content and 
that&rsquo;s its forte to this day. Like bash, this seems to be working 
extremely well. Is PHP more suitable as a &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; like
<code>bash</code> (albeit for generating web content) or a general purpose 
language like Ruby?</p> 
<p> comment at 12. March 2006 </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Aristotle Pagaltzis:</p> 
<p>Ryan: it&rsquo;s hard to put PHP in any category. It&rsquo;s geared heavily 
toward generating web content, though it can also be used outside the context 
of a web server, and such code doesn&rsquo;t end nearly up as grotesque as, 
say, writing servers inbash using netcat. But PHP has such weak metaprogramming 
facilities that I wouldn&rsquo;t use it for anything other than its main 
domain, and even that is just because of its ubiquity.</p>

<p>Eugene Lazutkin:</p> 
<p>You forgot to mention one vastly popular dynamic language: JavaScript. It 
looks like lowly JavaScript with its Ajax creates the next generation of 
client-side applications, while Java applets went nowhere in this direction. 
Need more proof? ;-)</p> 
<p> comment at 13. March 2006 </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Keith Wright:</p> 
<p>I think it might be nice to mention that while a lot of concerns about 
performance are overblown and FUD, there is a point at which performance 
becomes a real issue, which many have a habit of handwaving and say that you 
can always optimize that part to C.</p> 
<p>I am an application programmer, and while huge chunks of the program have 
very little cause to be concerned about performance (Dialogs and DB I/O and 
such), real world applications find themselves having to deal with larger and 
larger datasets, and more and more computations. In these portions of the 
program performance cannot be ignored. The difference between being able to 
handle 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 data points is the difference between a sale 
and no sale.</p> 
<p>So when I see how a language like Ruby does in performance tests, often 100 
times slower than the leader, I have to ask myself whether it has any place in 
application programming. Dynamic language designers shouldn&rsquo;t forget that 
computers are still very much valued in their ability to do computations (hence 
the name!) and they should&rsquo;t cede the whole program space to the 
venerable compiled warhorses.</p>

<p>twifkak:</p> 
<p>When I was, like, 10 years younger (and too young to care about dynamic 
languages or beautiful code), I visited the home ofKIPR fellow Dave Lavery, who 
happens to work for NASA. He was showing off to me some code he had helped 
write that &mdash; guess what &mdash;<strong>actually did interplanetary 
navigation</strong>. And guess what &mdash; <em>it was in LISP</em>.</p> 
<p>Now, 10 years ago, I was 12, so don&rsquo;t bet your life that my facts are 
straight. It may have been a prototype of the real thing, but I don&rsquo;t 
think that it was. From what I recall, it was real-time image analysis logic 
that helped one satellite automatically maneuver itself into connecting with 
another, via video camera.</p>

<p>alan:</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert, but dissing dynamic languages because they don&rsquo;t 
do &ldquo;interplanetary navigation&rdquo; is just contrarian unhistorical 
blather. When NASA wanted a space ship to navigate under its own autonomous 
control for the first time (Deep Space I, in a planetary shadow), it had the 
ship&rsquo;s computer run dynamic LISP code. Why? So solutions could be 
dynamically provided, if needed, and so that the basic code would be smart. But 
hey, I&rsquo;m no expert. Ask Norvig. Lisp has its dynamic nature, even when 
most of what it&rsquo;s running at the moment may be fully-compiled. Python can 
do many of the same tricks&hellip;and choice is good.</p>

<p>Actually, he does:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>For the command and control system, big parts of it are this rather large 
Java application. There are a lot of parts involved in this. The Rover itself 
has a computer onboard. There&rsquo;s no Java in that computer now. But on the 
ground-side, there are a number of parts of the whole command and control chain 
that goes out to the Rover that&rsquo;s done in Java. It&rsquo;s not like every 
last piece of every subsystem is based on the Java code. Great big pieces of it 
are. In particular, all the data visualization, user interface front-end stuff 
and I believe a whole lot of the database stuff is.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Anjan Bacchu:</p> 
<p>hi there,</p> 
<p>James Gosling did a lot of work on LISP to build Emacs.</p> 
<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a perspective of someone who&rsquo;s done a whole 
breadth of applications using Java. We all know that ruby/python can be used 
for 80% of the applications that java can be used. But we know(from the 80/20 
rule) that the only 20% of the journey is done when you say that 80% work is 
done. The last 20% takes 80% of the effort. If you&rsquo;re happy with the 80% 
work, fine.</p> 
<p>When he specifically says that breadth is NOT there in the other languages, 
you should NOT jump to conclusions about his motives. If you ask Bjarne 
Stroustrup about C++, he is known to defend C++&rsquo;s successes in a wide 
area of applications(which is wider than java&rsquo;s). Gosling has higher 
motivation that Bjarne ever did to keep their created languages going but at 
the same time we should not put ignorance and ill-motives.</p> 
<p>Even though one tends to accept/recognize when the trade press like to 
sensationalize such things, I feel terrible when a PhD/M.S talks like a 
Slashdotter/high schooler/&rdquo;Digg&rdquo;er. You expect more from people who 
have an M.S &mdash; after all they don&rsquo;t go to such schools just to learn 
Compilers.</p>

<p>Good old Albert knew it: It&rsquo;s all relative. Dynamic, static, 
assemblique. Who the f* cares. Use what&rsquo;s good for the job in order. 
Noone would use a dynamic language in a team of 30 developers in a company with 
a beaurocratic mindset. Neither would the open source guy who cares about 
solutions, clarity and beauty use a monster language like Java. The right tool 
for the right people for the right job. Peace and all be happy&hellip;</p> 
<p>Just to add another use of dynamic languages in big corps: Python for 
example is used by SAP for internal IT automation. This is stuff used by 
thousands and thousands of people on a daily basis internally (and the SAP IT 
is something that actually works.. producs are another thing;)). But they use 
Python in their products too. For example TREX (a search engine), it even 
includes a Python TCL GUI. And just another note here: They just closed the 
Java consulting depeartment in germany - a &ldquo;strategic decision.&rdquo;</p>

then James might not feel so left out.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Just to add another use of dynamic languages in big corps: Python 
for example is used by SAP for internal IT automation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Just random note along the same lines Oracle (10g for Windows) and 
IBM/Rational (used by both ClearQuest and ClearCase) both install Perl 5.6 in 
their default Windows installs.</p>

scripting in the form of Perl, Ruby et al, and hammer on about scalability but 
you fail to mention VBScript.</p> 
<p>No wait, I&rsquo;m serious. It fufils all the criteria you&rsquo;ve 
mentioned above. ASP is scalable, if you&rsquo;re sensible in your coding. Want 
a different problem domain? Excel automation, I&rsquo;ve seen trading houses 
and banks where prediction and reporting models are built in Excel using VB for 
Applications. Want to automatic your OS, write shell script equivilants? 
Windows Scripting Host and, again, VBScript files.</p> 
<p>So whilst it may not be trendy, it may not be open source, it may not have 
some word of mouth marketing scheme behind it the lack of VBScript&rsquo;s 
inclusion in your mind&rsquo;s list of scripting languags may show more 
snobbery than Gosling.</p>

<p>Indeed, ask.com was for many years getting along fine with a VBScript-based 
website. I worked for another company who found they had to use 45 web servers 
to run their EJB site rather than the 30 which it took to run their VBScript 
site.</p> 
<p>Now, both of these websites had backend systems which weren&rsquo;t 
script-based. The former was Teoma and the latter was Oracle. Perhaps the 
lesson here is that front-end websites simply don&rsquo;t need ultra-fast 
micro-benchmarked platforms.</p>

<p>Java kicks ass because of the JVM. And there are already tons of other

<p>Java itself is evolving probably better than other languages and it has the 
best API you need. Because in the end no language is that special but a good 
API saves you from a lot of trouble.</p> 
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t there any free Lisp (for commercial usage) with an API the 
size of Java (or at least threading + platform independent GUI + networking 
stuff) ?? I like Lisp and Python and I&rsquo;ve used Jython quite a lot at some 
point, but for for corporate work you really can&rsquo;t choose on the desktop 
side something else except Java or .NET (so we choose Java).</p>

<p>George:</p> 
<p><b>You seem to have a big problem with the term &ldquo;scripting 
language&rdquo; as Gosling used it.</b> Well lets dig in a little bit further 
on that.</p> 
<p>What is a scripting language? I mean, whats the bare bone of it, 
technically spoken? It is a language executed as script. That means it is 
called (from somewhere), then loaded, executed and ends, thats all, and what 
concerns me, I&rsquo;m perfectly fine with that. Its the same for me if it is 
interpreted, pre-compiled into P-code (or similiar) or executable, CGI or 
Fast-CGI, module or stand-alone, as long as it behaves like intended I&rsquo;ll 
befine.</p> 
<p>So why all the fuss about it? Why does Gosling mention it anyway, why are 
so many users/programmers upset with the term &ldquo;only scripting&rdquo;?</p> 
<p>I think the main reason is that there are different programming 
philosophies behind the kind PHP (Ruby, Perl etc.) on the one side is used in 
programming and Java is on the other side. Thats all, simple like that. Whereas 
a &ldquo;scripting&rdquo; language is executed and dies afterwards (which has 
its advantages like rapid development, ease of deployment etc. as mentioned 
above and in other linked pages), a &ldquo;compiled&rdquo; language does not 
(need to have, so it may use caching/pooling/memory objects much more efficient 
and has not to rely on backend systems and their performance that much).</p> 
<p>In my opinion that was what Gosling meant saying that scripting languages 
<b>&ldquo;[..] have really serious scaling and performance problems.&rdquo;</b>
. Okay, distilling all these into such a little sentence like Gosling did has a 
taste of FUD, but nevertheless Gosling may have relied on the fact that people 
who read his interview are a little bit technically educated (and even I did 
not point out anything<i>that</i> new until now either).</p> 
<p>So shame on Gosling, he could have made his point more clear on that. But 
on the other hand I do not have to read<b>&ldquo;Effective Java Advocacy 
Beans&rdquo;, section 6.8.3</b> to see another kind of FUD raising on.</p> 
<p>And of course I could do application programming using scripting languages.
</p> 
<p>I can do something very similiar to scripting in compiled languages too, 
using JSP or ASP or whatever&hellip; I do not see the point.</p>

<p>Sorry but JSPs are not dynamic as such, even if the expression language

<p>The reality is that large chunks of mission control @ NASA as well as the

I&rsquo;ve yet to figure out what those are, other than increasing my use of 
mediocre developers &mdash; the Turing completeness proves this false.</p> 
<p>As for scalability. It might affect you, it probably doesn&rsquo;t. Worry

<p>Java&rsquo;s evolutionary step towards Lisp has been important and in some

dragged programming half the way to Lisp, the next step seems smaller and

<blockquote> 
<p>Yes, but there&rsquo;s an important distinction that&rsquo;s not being made 
here. There are languages specialized for a certain task that are incapable of 
being used for anything else. I think bash is a good example of a specialized 
&ldquo;scripting language&rdquo;. bash is for chaining commands together. That 
doesn&rsquo;t make it bad, it just makes it limited to that specific problem 
domain. Which, again, is perfectly fine and correct and the best possible way 
of performing that task. I wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The situation you describe parallels closely the situation in real 
(non-virtual) world. In everyday situations we also see a number of specialized 
languages (non-programming languages), that are constrained and therefore 
limited in one way or another. For instance, some people occasionally use smoke 
signals to communicate messages. Others use semaphores, the blinking lamps, etc.
</p> 
<p>These languages are severely limited (which is exactly why the Monthy 
Python skit presenting Emily Bronte&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wuthering Heights&rdquo; 
with actors using flags for semaphores to engage each other in a dialog is so 
hilarious).</p> 
<p>Still, such languages are a subset of the &acirc;&#128;&#152;general 
purpose&rsquo; natural languages (and their dialects thereof). So, English is a 
general-purpose natural language. Its subset, Roger-Over-Out, is a rigid 
language used for most of the wireless human-to-human communications occurring 
today (there is also the less famous &acirc;&#128;&#152;Able, Baker, 
Charlie&rsquo; language, known and used by all radiophone operators in the 
services).</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Contrast that with static languages, where you are forced to create a 
completely separate &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; when you need to provide a 
constrained/specialized language (this is why XML is used so heavily in Java 
for things like O/R mapping, dependency injection, configuration, build 
processes, etc. &acirc;&#128;&#148; XML is Java&rsquo;s scripting language).</p>
</blockquote> 
<p>This is an excellent point. It reveals why static languages are not real 
languages &acirc;&#128;&#147; they need other languages to constrain them. 
Something&rsquo;s wrong with this picture. A real language shouldn&rsquo;t need 
an extra language to constrain it.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In dynamic languages, you are generally not required to leave the core 
language to get that specialization: you use techniques like meta-programming 
and DSLs or just include/require/use some designated file at a designated point 
and let it do it&rsquo;s thing with the API.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Another bang on point: real languages are context sensitive. Change the 
context, and the interpretation of the language constructs changes.</p> 
<p>If I may borrow an example from the natural languages &acirc;&#128;&#147; 
if someone in everyday situation suddenly starts waving a flag above his head, 
that could get easily misinterpreted as being an act of patriotism, of flag 
desecration, and many other things. But if the context for the formal 
semaphore-based communication is first proposed, than the flag waving attains 
much more clarity. This is what we may refer to as 
&acirc;&#128;&#152;metaprogramming&rsquo;.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Using a general purpose language but extending it in places that would 
traditionally require &ldquo;scripting&rdquo; is the fundamental design 
principal behind Rails, Django, TG, Seaside, etc.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In other words, such languages are context-sensitive. Can static languages 
be made context-sensitive?</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>When someone unfamiliar with modern dynamic languages and experienced in 
Java hears someone say, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re scripting languages, and get their 
power through specialization,&rdquo; they are being misled into thinking that 
these languages are like bash and can be used only for a single specialized 
scenarios, which is obvious not the case: they can be constrained and 
specialized as much or as little as required and become useful in multiple 
specialized scenarios. That&rsquo;s really important.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In other words, they require more intelligent handling. No wonder 
bureaucrats despise such languages &acirc;&#128;&#147; they assume some brain 
power behind the powers that use them. Not a desirable scenario in the 
bureaucrats&rsquo; worldview.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Now, what I&rsquo;m not entirely sure about is where PHP fits in all this. 
PHP was originally very much specialized for generating web content and 
that&rsquo;s its forte to this day. Like bash, this seems to be working 
extremely well. Is PHP more suitable as a &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; like 
bash (albeit for generating web content) or a general purpose language like 
Ruby?</p> </blockquote>

<p>By &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; (which is, I grant you, a loaded word) I was 
referring to the typing. While, when coding Java, your IDE blinks angrily at 
you when you try to call<code>new Integer(5).trim()</code>, you&rsquo;ll get no 
flak from JSP EL, because there, types are not evaluated until runtime. You 
could say<code>&lt;c:out value=&quot;${foo.stuff}&quot; /&gt;</code> in the 
view, and from the controller, pass objects of two<em>entirely</em> different 
classes that implement the getStuff() method. That&rsquo;s duck-typing, my 
friend, and that&rsquo;s dynamic.</p> 
<p>The technical details of how it manages this dynamicity are of no 
importance to me (and, in fact, it was touched on above that Lisp is a fully 
dynamic language that can be interpreted<em>or</em> compiled). Now&rsquo;s my 
time to step off my high horse &mdash; why are the technical details of the

<p>RTFA! No one is suggesting he champion, support, or advocate anything, just 
that he stop spreading information that&rsquo;s provably incorrect. It&rsquo;s

<p>Do you lie about anything that&rsquo;s not your preference? Does being a

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what all the fuss is. Who cares what James Gosling 
thinks? He&rsquo;s an obviously interested party, with a party line to spew. 
There are<em>lots</em> of industry luminaries, all spewing their corporate 
lines.</p> 
<p>The thing is, as you point out in your article, the knowledge that this is 
spew is well-documented. Either now or in months or in years, everyone who<em>
can</em> have their mind opened <em>will</em> have their mind opened, just by 
the current motion and inertia that platforms like Rails and PHP possess today.
</p> 
<p>By arguing with Gosling, it&rsquo;s making his words <em>more</em> 
legitimate. Like there&rsquo;s a debate here. There&rsquo;s no need for debate. 
We don&rsquo;t need to prove him wrong with articles and blog posts. We just 
need to keep successfully building real, working systems using the tools that 
we feel are appropriate.</p>

<p>Actually, and i realize James was pointing primarily at the newcomers to 
the dynamic language crowd, NASA has used Lisp extensively in the past.</p> 
<p>In Peter Siebel&rsquo;s book, Practical Common Lisp, he relays an anecdote 
from Eran Gatt regarding the use of Lisp in the Deep Space 1 mission in 1998, 
specifically pointing out the usefulness of having a read-eval-print loop 
available on a remote piece of hardware. And Lisp was, in fact, doing the 
navigation.</p> 
<p>More relevantly, perhaps, is that the bug which needed to be addressed 
concerned a race condition due to the concurrent nature of the software, not 
any of the type-safety or other shallow bugs that might be addressed by 
adopting Java instead.</p>

<p>Java is ugly. It was ugly when it was born (Smalltalk-like VM + C syntax). 
And now Java is an even uglier 10 year old. Java&rsquo;s older sister, Self, is 
now a fine 19 year old, though only available on Mac OS X (fine by me). Someone 
needs to tell Gosling his baby was ugly then, and even uglier now. Java is the 
new legacy, the new COBOL. Just as COBOL development continued after its 
natural life, so will Java. REST and WSDL will let us still use Java on life 
support until we replace it!</p> 
<p>Dynamic languages are making a resurgence, not a comeback since they never 
really went away, and for many it will be a good, productive and profitable 
time. Leave Java to the masses as they wallow in suffering&hellip;just code

<p>It&rsquo;s called parametric polymorphism (fragments of System-F) in

<p>Untyped so-called &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; languages are nice for many things,

<p>Achilleas Margaritis:</p> 
<p>The way a program is translated to machine code has no relation to what the 
program can do. A compiled language may offer very little capabilities, and a 
scripting language may offer much more capabilities, and vice versa. The real 
reason dynamic compilation exists is that it makes changing code more flexible 
than when precompiled.</p> 
<p>Mr Gosling&rsquo;s reaction is a good indicator for what I have been 
suspecting all these years: Java encourages bloatware. And this has nothing to 
do with the fact that Java is precompiled or dynamically compiled (from source 
code to machine code, that is, not bytecode); it has to do with the language 
itself.</p>

<p>Ryan, you were quick to make a personal attack on James Gosling accusing 
him of spreading misinformation and malicious lies, as-soon-as the tabloid

<p>It&rsquo;s been 5 days since the his real comments became available on

 It&rsquo;s been 4 days since Curt Hibbs 
wrote &ldquo;Reading the actual transcript shows a much more reasonable point

<p>You accuse James Gosling of using the term scripting language to denigrate 
PHP and Ruby by associating them with more limited language implementations 
like bash.<br>
<em>And then you do what you accuse him of</em> - you use the 
term dynamic language to hype PHP and Ruby by associating them with more 
powerful language implementations like Lisp and Smalltalk.<br>

<p>You say James Gosling is ignorant of the many different things that PHP and 
Ruby are used for (he mentions PHP 7 times, Ruby 1, Python 1, Perl 0) because 
he characterizes them as languages that just generate web pages.<br>
<em>And 
then you use PHP / Ruby on Rails &lsquo;generate web page&rsquo; examples</em> 
for 13 of 15 links on Scalability and Performance.<br>
 When you present that 
many &lsquo;generate web page&rsquo; examples it becomes understandable that an 
outsider like James Gosling has the impression that PHP and Ruby are just used 
to generate web pages.</p> 
<p>You accuse James Gosling of spreading misinformation about the current 
state of dynamic languages, presumably including the current state of PHP and 
Ruby performance.<br>
<em>And you do what you accuse him of</em> - as one of 
only 5 performance references you link to a 6 year old comparison of miniscule 
Python programs to Blackdown JDK 1.1.7, rather than a comparison of standalone 
PHP or Ruby with Java HotSpot 1.5.<br>

<p>Why are Ruby and PHP scripting languages? Simply because they are only 
useful as &lsquo;glue&rsquo; between programs which do the real work. If I use 
for example PHP, I have a web-server written in C, which uses a Module written 
in C to execute a language which uses Libraries written in C to access a 
database-server written in C. Can you write all this stuff in PHP? If not, PHP 
is only usable for scripting or with other words for glueing componentes 
together.</p> 
<p>Thats not that bad, such kinds of languages are usefull and neccessary. If 
you look at alle those examples of successful usage of those languages you see, 
thats they are always uses as glue. In games for example you need a glue 
language for game-logic, a DSL which allows the game-designer to specify logic 
without recompiling the whole engine. So the engine is written in C/C++ and the 
game-logic in some DSL. And why not use a existing language as DSL, maybe 
Python or Ruby.</p> 
<p>In Java I use a web-server written in Java, huge libs, written in Java to 
access a db-server written in C (I also could use a db which is written in 
Java, there are some). You can do this in Java and not in PHP so PHP is 
&lsquo;only&rsquo; for glue - hence a scriping language. Same goes for Ruby 
(even if ruby is a much better language then PHP, but also so slow that its nit 
possible to write even the runtime-libs of ruby in ruby without having an 
unbearable slow program).</p> 
<p>About Lisp: Everybody who writes about how Lisp is used in performance 
relevant appilcations should take a look at the code of these applications. In 
Lisp you can type your program statically to improve performance (look at 
&lsquo;declaim&rsquo;, &lsquo;declare&rsquo; and &lsquo;proclaim&rsquo; 
functions) and if you really want a Lisp program to compete performancewise 
with Java, you end up writing a statically typed program in Lisp using lots of 
declares which fix the types of nearly everything. But of course no one here 
knows that, because its not about truth, its only about hype.</p> 
<p>Maybe those scriping language will replace languages like Java sometimes. 
Computer are getting faster and at some point in time you can even affort a 100 
times slower language to gain some comfort. The same happend with C and Java: 
Javas is in average about 50% slower then C because of the gc and certain 
design decisions but it don&rsquo;t matter much because of the gain of 
productivity. But can the gain of productitivy justify a 10-100 times 
performance loss if you compare Java to ruby? At least not now I suppose.</p>

<p>By that token, Java must be a scripting language, since running a Java VM 
written in Java inside a Java VM would be very slow.</p> 
<p>Anyway, even PHP has the socket functions and the other stuff that 
you&rsquo;d need to write a webserver. The argument holds water only because 
the the PHP interpreter is tied to a webserver, which makes it practically 
impossible to write d&aelig;mons.</p> 
<p>For all the other popular dynamic languages, the argument does not hold. It 
is perfectly possible to write a webserver in pure Perl, Python or Ruby, and in 
fact Rails and Catalyst ship with such included for development purposes 
(although neither is not particularly optimised or feature-complete, so is not 
recommended for actual deployment). The same is probably true of Django, though 
I don&rsquo;t know about that.</p> 
<p>But that is not a given. Two or three years ago we have someone at the 
local LUG who gave a talk about how they wrote a pure-Perl webserver which got 
them much better performance than they could achieve using Apache + mod_perl.
</p> 
<p>Speed is not a particularly big problem for dynamic languages. Memory 
consumption is a<strong>much</strong> greater sticking point. F.ex. I generally 
use the libxml2 bindings for Perl rather than pure-Perl XML parsers to do XML 
processing; the extra speed is a nice bonus, but the real reason is that 
building a DOM for even a moderately large XML document using Perl data 
structures consumes mindboggling amounts of memory.</p>

<li> 
<p>Smalltalk is pretty damn fast these days &acirc;&#128;&#147; without type

<li> 
<p>Take a look at OCaml. This is a strongly typed, type inferencing, purely 
functional language. Any piece of OCaml code can operate on different types 
much like code in dynamic languages, but the compiler checks that the types it 
is invoked with are compatible with regard to the operations performed. You 
avoid most (but not all) of the drawbacks of static typing while getting all 
the benefits of static typing despite only rarely specifying an explicit type 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; yet the compiled code is<em>faster than C++</em>.</p> </li>

<p>Languages have a long way to go yet, no doubt, but one thing is already

<p> comment at 31. March 2006 </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Carl:</p> 
<p>You can write the Java VM in Java too, the problem is the bootstrapping, 
because no OS can execute Java by itself, so you need at least some loader in 
assembler. Its implemented this way in the JNode-OS, a pure Java OS with 
drivers, VM etc totally written in Java. Can you do something like this in PHP 
or Ruby?</p> 
<p>Sure, there are Webservers written in Ruby and Python - but without big 
parts of the libs written in C those would be unbearable slow. And even so, 
they can&rsquo;t stand against Apache speed-wise. In comparission: I&rsquo;ve 
benchmarked Tomcat against Apache on my system and to my own surprise Tomcat 
came out noticeable faster - even if I tested only the delivery of static 
content.</p> 
<p>Look at the actual shootout-pages for benchmarks. Sure those are 
microbenches - but microbenches are mostly a problem for java because of the 
dynamic recompilation in the vm which makes programs run more slowly in the 
beginning. But Ruby or PHP are hideous slow compered to Java in most benches. 
Only exceptions are benchmarks where most time is spend in libs like 
regular-expression-matching or simmilar. Only there, because of the highly 
optimized C version in the runtime-lib PHP and Ruby can perform similar to the 
java-implemented re-lib in the java-standard-libs performance wise.</p> 
<p>Thats not bad for a scriping language, because performance isn&rsquo;t 
relevant for scripting purposes as long as it don&rsquo;t takes an eternity. 
But for application development performance does count, many people are still 
bashing Java because of its alleged poor performance.</p> 
<p>Yes, you can have dynamic languages which are faster - but even Smalltalk 
and Lisp can&rsquo;t compete to Java normally. Same for Perl which is also 
faster then Ruby and PHP. Only Lisp can if you use lot of type constraining 
declares. So to get comperable performance in Lisp you also have to program in 
a way comparable to Java.</p> 
<p>And you are right, memory consumption is a problem too. Java is a well 
known memory hog, but if you substract the usage of the vm and the loaded 
standard-libs (which takes more space then the optimized libs for Ruby for 
example which are written in C) you see that Java uses noticable less space 
then Ruby for most oo-based applications. I think the reason is that in Ruby 
each object is implemented as a hash-table, while in Java objects are 
implementes like C structs. It&rsquo;s obvious why this costs much more memory 
- but it&rsquo;s not obvious how Ruby can made more optimal without totally 
redefining its runtime semantics.</p> 
<p>All things have a certain price: In Ruby the price of the comprehensive 
runtime meta programming is a increased memory consumption and a reduced 
performance. In Java the price for the better performance is the static types 
you have to use as a programmer (and I for myself don&rsquo;t even consider 
static typing as a burden, but thats different topic).</p> 
<blockquote>

</blockquote> 
<p>Static typing is an optimisation, but also compiler verifiable 
documentation and specification. I know, there are people refuse to see those 
both last points and see static typing only as a burden, not as a means to help 
you even in the design process.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Smalltalk is pretty damn fast these days &acirc;&#128;&#147; without type 
declarations. How do they do that?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Because of its runtime model which is very different from the runtime model 
of Ruby. And even Smalltalk (which is the oo-language with the most effort in 
efficient execution ever - even most concepts in the Java-VM are derived from 
experiences with Smalltalk) isn&rsquo;t comperable to java performancewise. 
It&rsquo;s fast enough for a wider range of applications compared to Ruby - and 
it&rsquo;s<em>not</em> a scripting language. No one ever called Smalltalk 
&rsquo;scripting language&rsquo;. And guess why&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Take a look at OCaml. This is a strongly typed, type inferencing, purely 
functional language.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I know OCaml very well. And yes, it&rsquo;s fast (but not always as fast as 
C++, only in certain areas). But guess what: It&rsquo;s totally static. Not a 
bit of dynamism. Compared to ocaml I even Java is a dynamic language. So I 
don&rsquo;t see your point here. And of course no one ever called ocaml a 
scripting language too. Guess why&hellip;.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Languages have a long way to go yet, no doubt, but one thing is already 
clear: ALGOL-derived static typing is detrimental and will be left behind 
sooner or later.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I agree with you in this point. But dynamic typed languages like ruby 
won&rsquo;t be the future too. Look, dynamic typing is as old as programming 
languages. Even assembler is dynamically typed. And Lisp as one of the oldes 
higher-level lprogramming language is also dynamically typed. So all people who 
thik that dynamic typing is some kind of new trend, are way off the mark. The 
reason why dynamic typing has some kind of &lsquo;revial&rsquo; in the moment 
is the hype created by RoR and the increasing computing power of todays 
computers. So you can affort a slower language to a certain degree now - but 
only in specific areas. Remember that Smalltalk is around for more then 30 
years now - and it never make a breakthru. So why should Ruby change that now?
</p> 
<p>I think the future lies more in statically typed languages with very 
sophisticated type-systems which give you much more expressive power then the 
type system of languages like Java has. But dynamic typing is and was only a 
kludge to have a certain level of expressiveness without going thru the 
difficult task to create a good type system. Everybody can create dynamically 
typed languages - it&rsquo;s in fact totally simple. But not everybody is able 
to crate a powerfull and expressive type system like for example a language 
like Haskell has. Thats the reason why there are so many dynamic typed 
languages, not because dynamic typing is something sophisticated.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any numbers at hand for current Java or Lisp compilers. 
This is certainly not true for the Stalin compiler for Scheme, for example. 
Stalin generates much better code for Scheme than any Java compiler I am aware 
of.</p> 
<p>Of course the Stalin approach to Java would pay off about as well as for 
Scheme. But then you&rsquo;d have to wonder why the language was so less 
expressive. You may as well use Scheme. So this comparison of Java and Lisp is 
more the result of where compiler developers put their effort than on anything 
inherent in the languages per se.</p>

<li> 
<p>Carl:</p> 
<p>The problem is that Stalin only works with relativly static and also only 
with &ldquo;closed-world&rdquo; programs.</p> 
<p>If you want to do Ruby-like metaprogramming or dynamic class loading and 
creation like in Java, its approach won&rsquo;t work. It works best if you do 
numerical programming because Stalin detects some common usage patterns and 
creates optimized code for those patterns. But for other usage patterns which 
are very common in your average Ruby or PHP program, Stalin won&rsquo;t give 
you much benefit (or won&rsquo;t even work because it don&rsquo;t support the 
whole Scheme standard).</p> 
<p>There where many attempts do full-program type propagation/inference etc. 
with dynamic programming languages but none really worked for a wide range of 
real programs. The reason is that if you have a dynamic programming language, 
progammers are really using this dynamism and then it&rsquo;s impossible for 
any type-inferencer to succeed. And if a programmer really takes care to 
program in a way a type-inferencer can type a dynamic program to a static one, 
then he also can write those types down from the beginning.</p>

<p>Stalin is also a decade old. The combination of applying Stalin-like 
compilation to partially-closed-world modules, with Anamorphic-like hot spot 
code generation, etc. could combine to get overall great results.</p> 
<p>Stalin is an approach you&rsquo;d apply to larger chunks of code you expect 
to be in production for some longer period of time, e.g. weeks or months. 
Partial-compilation to &ldquo;unroll&rdquo; some of the dynamism might make 
more of the code available to a Stalin compiler.</p> 
<p>I think my general point is that if you only think of a compiler as 
something like what Kernighan and Ritchie developed thirty years ago then, no, 
C or Java will almost always out perform Ruby for sufficiently CPU-bound 
examples.</p>

He has since addressed the flame war that erupted, but the whole ordeal got me 
thinking seriously about PHP and its scalability and performance abilities 
compared to Java. I knew that several hugely popular Web 2.0 applications were 
written in scripting languages like PHP, so I contacted Owen Byrne - Senior 
Software Engineer at digg.com to learn how he addressed any problems they 
encountered during their meteoric growth. This article addresses the 
all-to-common false assumptions about the cost of scalability and performance 
in PHP applications. [&hellip;]</p>

<p>Well, as for the &ldquo;interplanetary navigation&rdquo; issue, maybe we 
should hear from a NASA employee (Sean Kelly) what he thinks about Java and 
dynamic languages:</p> 
<p>http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/better-web-app.mov</p> 
<p>They have been using TCL/TK (dynamic language) to build GUIs for years, 
replacing C++. He says Java is &ldquo;not fun&rdquo; and far less productive 
than PHP, Python or Ruby for web development.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a 70 year old carpenter put up a wall faster with a hammer 
than a 20 year old carpenter using a nail gun.</p> 
<p>I have been programming for 26+ years and try to learn a new language every 
year. My favorite still being C, but I rarely ever consider using it.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen great systems written in languages most of you have never 
heard of (EDL anyone?).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen crappy systems written in 
Java/C/C++/VB/Lisp/Algol/Forth,etc,etc, etc. Compiled, interpreted or compiled 
to bytecode then interpreted, whatever.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen great systems written in those same languages.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen excellent programmers who have no idea why their software 
turns a high-end ORACLE RDBMS Server into an expensive brick.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen excellent DB admins who think that PL-SQL is the only 
language you should ever write in.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen countless projects fail because of issues at layer 8 of the 
OSI model (politics=Layer 8, for those of you who think there are only 7 layers)
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen excellent programmers who think that all their code 
performance problems are because the network is slow.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of things in 26+ years.</p> 
<p>And I only wish to make two comments (neither original):</p> 
<p>1) People are more important than technology.<br>
 2) It&rsquo;s a poor 
musician that blames his instrument.</p> 
<p>And leave two pieces of advice:</p> 
<p>1) Implement technology based on a deep understanding of the 
problem/business/project/requirements,etc.<br>
 2) Learn what you do not know.
