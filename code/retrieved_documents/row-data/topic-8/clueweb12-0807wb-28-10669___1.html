</p> 
<p>Lately there has been a substantial increase in interest and activity in 
Functional Programming. Functional Programming is sufficiently different from 
the conventional mainstream programming style calledImperative Programming to 
warrant some discussion on what it is, before we delve into the specifics of 
how it can be used in Python.</p> 
<h2><strong>What is Functional Programming?</strong></h2> 
<p>To quote from Wikipedia,<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm that 
treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state 
and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to 
the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><br>
For beginners, one of the most fluent starter pages I would recommend 
for the history and specifics of functional programming isFunctional 
Programming For The Rest of Us. This is a must read article which provides the 
reader with a good overview without getting too much into the nitty gritties of 
functional programming.</p> 
<p>Since a detailed discussion on functional programming (henceforth referred 
to FP) is beyond the scope of this post, I will just briefly summarise the most 
critical elements of FP.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Functions as the basic building blocks :</strong> Unsurprisingly 
FP requires the construction and usage of functions as the basic building 
units. In the simplest terms &ldquo;<em>int add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }
</em>&rdquo; is a simple addition function written in &lsquo;C&rsquo;. It takes 
two parameters x and y, adds them, and returns the result. This is a rather 
obvious and simple case but I stated it since I would like to refer back to it 
subsequently in this post.<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Functional Programming prefers functions without side effects : 
</strong> The <em>add</em> function above is a good example of a function 
without side effects. A function is said to be without side effects if the only 
changes it makes are those that are manifested in the return values. In other 
words such a function cannot change any global variables, write to the console, 
update the database etc. A fairly related term is<em>referential transparency
</em>. A function is said to be referentially transparent if its invocation can 
be substituted by the return value in a program without impacting the program 
in any other way.<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Immutability </strong>: Pure functional programming often requires 
you to deal with immutable data structures. Thus the value of any variable is 
not open to modification (Thus they are called values and not variables). This 
aspect complements the functions without side effects. Thus the way most 
changes to state are implemented are not by modifying an object in place (which 
is how imperative programming deals with it) but by cloning the data structure 
with some of the values getting modified and the modified data structure being 
returned by the function. Java programmers are aware of the immutability of the 
String instances wherein any modifications to the string result in a new String 
instance being created. Imagine the same happening to all the datatypes across 
the program.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Benefits of Functional Programming :</strong></h2> 
<p>Some of the nice benefits (I am tempted to say side effects) of functional 
programming are :<br>
<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Superior ability to deal with concurrency (multi threading) : 
</strong>Threaded programs are nasty to write. And nastier to debug. In an 
imperative environment, you not only have to deal with data structures being 
modified in place by some other parts of the program, in a threaded environment 
such modifications can happen using peer threads, even as your current thread 
whose logic you are focusing on is attempting to exercise that logic. Its an 
extremely unpredictable environment which has resulted in a number of 
how-to&rsquo;s for safe threaded programming using constructs such as locks, 
mutexes etc. Functional programming deals with the issue far more elegantly. 
Instead of controlling and managing unpredictability, it takes it out 
completely. Because a data structure once constructed will not be modified and 
because the source of the modifications can be clearly located to the function 
which instantiated the datastructure, the unpredictability of data changing 
right under you is gone. This can be a little expensive to manage and FP does 
sometimes come up with some compromises (or cool features depending on how you 
view it) such as Software Transactional Memory but a discussion on that is 
completely beyond the scope of this post.<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Easier testing and debugging : </strong>Because modifications to 
data are contained and because a function communicates with the context outside 
it only via its return values, testing and debugging become far easier. You 
essentially need to focus on testing each function individually. Similarly 
during debugging you need to be able to quickly locate the function likely to 
have the problem, after which you can easily focus on the function to be able 
to quickly resolve the issue. Mocking out functions can also help testing each 
function in isolation. In general because of fewer side effects, testing under 
functional programming is often a lot easier, and the importance of having to 
do &ldquo;integration&rdquo; testing and &ldquo;module&rdquo; testing is lesser 
since testing functions in isolation is likely to identify most issues, far 
more than in typical imperative programming.<br>
<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Why Python?</strong></h2> 
<p>Python is not the best functional programming language. But it was not 
meant to be. Python is a multi paradigm language. Want to write good old 
&lsquo;C&rsquo; style procedural code? Python will do it for you. C++/Java 
style object oriented code? Python is at your service as well. Functional 
Programming ? As this series of posts is about to demonstrate &ndash; Python 
can do a decent job at it as well. Python is probably the most productive 
language I have worked with (across a variety of different types of programming 
requirements). Add to that the fact that python is a language thats extremely 
easy to learn, suffers from excellent readability, has fairly good web 
frameworks such asdjango, has excellent mathematical and statistical libraries 
such asnumpy, and cool network oriented frameworks such as twisted. Python may 
not be the right choice if you want to write 100% FP. But if you want to learn 
more of FP or use FP techniques along with other paradigms<em>Python&rsquo;s 
capabilities are screaming to be heard<strong>.<br>
<br>
</strong></em></p> 
<p><strong>Sample Program :</strong></p> 
<p>I debated whether I should introduce various elements of functional 
programming using python in detail and then put it all together in a sample 
program all in future blog posts of this series, or whether I should start with 
a sample program which cover various aspects of function programming in this 
post and then explain various aspects in much more detail in future posts. For 
better or for worse, I have chosen the latter option. That means I shall be 
explaining one sample program and shall leave it to future posts in this series 
to get into greater details.</p> 
<p>The sample program I have chosen is that of a simple calculator. A typical 
calculator supports simple unary or binary mathematical operators and performs 
floating point operations. Without much ado we now get into the sample program.
</p> 
<p><em><strong>Immutable Data :</strong><br>
</em></p> 
<pre>from collections import namedtuple Context = namedtuple('Context','stack, 
current, op') def default_context(): return Context([],0.0,None)</pre> 
<p>Python is not particularly strong at immutable data. However one of the 
data structures, a tuple is immutable. A<em>namedtuple</em> is another data 
structure which supports both tuple like access through indices or through 
named elements in the tuple. For the calculator I shall need a<em>Context</em> 
which contains a<em>stack</em> for storing any incomplete operations, an 
attribute<em>current</em> reflecting the current value being shown on the 
screen and an<em>op</em> which might reflect a pending operation which is 
typically required for binary operators where the second value still needs to 
be provided. While namedtuple is a reasonable construct for simple tuple like 
objects, it would be helpful to have immutable objects as well &ndash; but 
thats to be covered in a future post.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Simple Functions</em></strong></p> 
<pre>def add(x,y): return x + y def sub(x,y): return x - y def mult(x,y): 
return x * y def div(x,y): return x/ y def reverse_sign(x): return -1 * x def 
pow(x,y): return x ** y</pre> 
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to describe here. The functions should be self 
explanatory. For purpose of emphasis I would like to note that in the above 
code, &ldquo;add&rdquo; is now an entry in the namespace which is a reference 
to a function. This reference can be passed around, assigned to other entries. 
Thus the code below should work (though it does not form a part of the 
calculator program). This is to demonstrate how python treats attributes and 
functions virtually identically consistent with theUniform access principle.</p>
<pre>otheradd = add add = sub assert otheradd(7,3) == 10 assert add(7,3) == 4
</pre> 
<p><strong><em>Currying</em></strong><br>
Currying is a treatment afforded in 
functional programming which allows a function of n parameters to be treated as 
a sequence of n sequential functions each of one parameter.</p> 
<pre>from functools import partial square = partial(pow,y=2)</pre> 
<p>Here <em>partial</em> is a function reference. <em>square</em> now refers 
to another function with its y parameter value being anchored to 2</p> 
<p><strong><em>Invoking functions dynamically</em></strong></p> 
<pre>unary_functions = {'!' : reverse_sign, '@' : square } def 
handle_unary_op(ctx,x): return ctx._replace(current = 
unary_functions[x](ctx.current), op = None) binary_functions = {'+' : add, '-' 
: sub, '*' : mult, '/' : div} def handle_binary_op(ctx,x): return 
ctx._replace(op = binary_functions[x]) def handle_float(ctx,x): if not ctx.op : 
return ctx._replace(current = x) else : return ctx._replace(current = 
ctx.op(ctx.current,x), op = None)</pre> 
<p>Note that I created a unary_functions dict (or dictionary or hashmap) where 
the key is the character which represents the function and the value is the 
reference to the function.</p> 
<p>Also note that in the <em>handle_unary_op</em>function, I invoke <em>
ctx._replace</em> method. On a named tuple it creates another tuple based on 
the existing namedtuple data, but with some of the values modified as specified 
in the keyword paramters passed to<em>_replace</em>. After looking up the 
appropriate unary function ie.<em>unary_functions[x]</em>, I also invoke it on 
the current value ie.<em>unary_functions[x](ctx.current)</em>. I also defined 
another dict for binary operators. The<em>handle_binary_op</em> method reflects 
how the op in the context is set to the appropriate binary function that should 
be triggered after the subsequent value is known.</p> 
<p>Finally the <em>handle_float</em> function either sets the current value to 
the incoming value or in case the current operator is already set it applies 
the binary operator to the current value and the incoming value and replaces<em>
current</em> with the computed value.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Additional Code</em></strong><br>
 When I wrote the calculator 
program, I wrote the functionality to introduce braces. However that 
functionality is not particularly important in this explanation. So it is being 
listed here for completeness.</p> 
<pre>def start_brace(ctx): newstack = ctx.stack 
newstack.append((ctx.current,ctx.op)) return ctx._replace( stack = newstack, 
current = 0.0, op = None) def end_brace(ctx): stack = ctx.stack current = 
ctx.current oldcurrent, oldop = stack.pop() oldctx = 
Context(stack,oldcurrent,oldop) return process_key(oldctx,current) tokens = { 
'(': start_brace, ')' : end_brace} def handle_tokens(ctx,x): return 
tokens[x](ctx)</pre> 
<p><strong><em>Processing one key</em></strong><br>
 I must confess I started 
off using key to represent the keystrokes, but along the way the key can also 
represent a complete floating point number (not just a single keystroke). Thus 
the key parameter can refer to a single character operator or a sequence of 
characters representing a floating point number</p> 
<pre>function_groups = { tuple(unary_functions.keys()) : handle_unary_op, 
tuple(binary_functions.keys()) : handle_binary_op, tuple(tokens.keys()) : 
handle_tokens } def process_key(ctx,key): if 
isinstance(key,(types.FloatType,types.IntType, types.LongType)) : return 
handle_float(ctx,key) elif isinstance(key,(types.StringType)) : for 
function_class in function_groups : if key in function_class : return 
function_groups[function_class](ctx,key) return ctx</pre> 
<p>In this case I set up a dictionary where the key is a tuple of all the keys 
representing a particular class of a function. Note that the<em>.keys()</em> 
method is a method which returns a list of all the keys in a dictionary. 
However since list is mutable, it cannot get used as a key into the overall 
hashmap, hence I convert it into a tuple.</p> 
<p>The <em>process_key</em> function takes the incoming key, passes it <em>
handle_float</em> if it is a number, or treats it as an operator. If it is the 
latter it searches for it in all the keys of each operator groups, and if it 
finds a match, it locates the corresponding handler function from the map and 
invokes it. Finally in case no match is found it ignores the key.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Processing a sequence of keys</em></strong></p> 
<pre>def process_keys(keys): return reduce(lambda ctx,key : 
process_key(ctx,key), keys, default_context())</pre> 
<p>Here you see a <em>reduce</em> function being invoked. This belongs to the 
family of<em>map</em> and <em>filter</em> functions which are used extensively 
in functional programming. I shall attempt to briefly explain it here, but this 
family of functions in addition to a number of others will again be dealt with 
in a future blog post.</p> 
<p>To interpret the usage read the above reduce statement right to left. Thus 
we start with a default context, and for each key in the sequence of keys, we 
invoke a lambda (thats like an anonymous function), which calls process key 
with the context and the key. Note that the first parameter to the lambda is 
either the initial value (the default context) or the return value of the last 
process_key (which is also a context) and the key is each key in the keys 
sequence injected sequentially.</p> 
<p>To further make it easy I re-represent the same function below differently 
which is much more readable and easier to understand. This shows one more 
strength of python. Because of its focus on readability, it actually can be 
used to write functional programs are much more readable by a large mass of 
programmers than most of the functional programming languages themselves 
(readability being subjectively interpreted by me as what is most natural for 
english or similar language speaking people).</p> 
<pre>def process_keys(keys): ctx = default_context() for key in keys : ctx = 
process_key(ctx,key) return ctx</pre> 
<p><strong><em>Usage</em></strong><br>
 As a mechanism to conduct some 
rudimentary tests on the code written so far, the following code is introduced. 
Here you can get an overall feel of the program.</p> 
<pre>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot; : assert process_keys((2,'+', 
3)).current == 5 assert process_keys((2, '!', '+', 5)).current == 3 assert 
process_keys((2, '@')).current == 4 assert 
process_keys((2,'+',3,'*',5)).current == 25 assert 
process_keys((2,'+','(',3,'*',5,')')).current == 17</pre> 
<p><strong><em>Some more slightly advanced Functional Programming</em></strong>
</p> 
<p>Finally to tickle your interest even more, here&rsquo;s a slightly more 
advanced usage of functional programming constructs. Here I shall add all 
numbers between 1 through 10.</p> 
<pre>from itertools import chain def plus_num_seq(n): count = 1 while count 
&lt;= n : yield '+', count count += 1 keys = 
list(chain.from_iterable(plus_num_seq(10)))[1:] assert process_keys(keys) == 55
</pre> 
<p>The <em>plus_num_seq</em> is a generator. Note the usage of the yield 
statement. Thus it will continuously generate tuples with the first element of 
the tuple being the &lsquo;+&rsquo; character and the second being the number 
with the number varying from values 1 through n. The<em>chain.from_iterable</em>
 flattens the generated list (it thus has 20 items for n = 10, each alternate 
one being the &lsquo;+&rsquo; character starting with the first items). Since 
we do not need the very first &lsquo;+&rsquo; character, I removed it using the 
[1:] slice operator.</p> 
<p>Just like <em>reduce</em> this style of code is quite typical of functional 
programming. Thats something I shall detail upon much more in future posts.</p> 
<p>Hope you enjoyed the post. Keep the feedback coming so I can better 
structure the subsequent posts based on the feedback.</p>

Pycon India 2010. The slides to the topic can be found at the bottom ofthis page

Certainly the next step would be for you to delve much deeper into the 
itertools module that contains a wealth of tools for list processing, one of 
the cornerstones of functional programming!
