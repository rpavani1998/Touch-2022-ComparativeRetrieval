Python: Virtualenv + pip // 2010-10-31 <br>
<p><em>&quot;In the Java world there was always a problem with dependencies. 
All the jars we had to mange by hand &ndash; quite awful. Thankfully there is a 
Maven project which helps us in requirements management. But what about Python? 
Is there any way to handle necessary libraries? Of course, there is! It is a 
tandem of virtualenv and pip.&quot;</em> by Marcin Swierczynski</p>  Category:

Generic relationships in Django // 2010-08-31 
<br> 
<p><em>&quot;Last week I&rsquo;ve completed an interesting task within our 
project: building internal link-shortening system based on persisted objects, 
not on constant URLs. The main requirement was to get as loosely-coupled design 
as possible. In the perfect world the &ldquo;shortenable&rdquo; classes should 
know absolutely nothing about link-shortening mechanism. How to get such a 
flexibility in Django? I&rsquo;ve used the ContentTypes framework with generic 
relations and it works pretty well!&quot;</em> by Marcin Swierczynski</p>

pthreads as a case 
study of good API design // 2010-07-25 <br>

<p><em>&quot;The pthreads API is inherently simple. Not in the sense that it 
makes multi-threaded (MT) programming a breeze (I doubt this is possible), but 
in the sense that it provides everything that&rsquo;s needed to write MT 
programs, and only that. In other words, pthreads solves a single problem, and 
solves it well.&quot;</em> by Eli Bendersky.</p>  Category: Link // Tags:

process as easy as possible we've implemented a backend template which provides 
a simple starting point for a new backend based on our simplified API. It also 
contains sample code, so you can better understand what each function

mean by this that Java programmers are dumb. I meant that Python programmers 
are smart. It's a lot of work to learn a new programming language. And people 
don't learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it because they 
genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they already 
know.&quot;</em></p>  Category: Link // Tags: Python, Software <br>
