<h2>The problem with Microsoft&hellip;</h2> 
<p><br>
Some rights reserved by&nbsp;Nick, Programmerman</p> 
<p>Gary Rivlin at Fortune Magazine has some recent articles about Steve 
Ballmer and Microsoft senior management (The problem with Microsoft&hellip; 
&amp;Why insiders think top management has lost its way). The articles make 
great fodder given the rise of Apple to be larger than Microsoft in both market 
capitalization and revenues. What is strange is that I love both of these 
companies. I&rsquo;m an ex-Microsoft employee. It was a great place to work. 
And I have been an Apple fanboy for a long time &nbsp;(spending my entire 
signing bonus in 1997 on Apple stock). Let&rsquo;s be clear Microsoft is still 
a large powerful company, they have just lost their way in defining the next 
generation of technology, business models, and customers.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Still, Ballmer needs to do something to shake Microsoft from what, at best, 
seems to be a textbook case of corporate ennui: MIT&rsquo;s Michael Cusumano, 
who has featured Microsoft in several books, including the new work&nbsp;<em>
Staying Power</em>, sees a company hopelessly stuck in neutral, in no small 
part because Microsoft has a weak board and no one expects Bill Gates, the 
company&rsquo;s top shareholder, with about 5% of shares outstanding, to oust 
the CEO, who was the best man at his wedding. &ldquo;Ballmer has been a good 
steward of Windows, and that&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; Cusumano says.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Gary Rivlin nailed my feelings and analysis on Microsoft in The problem 
with Microsoft&hellip;. Microsoft is a juggernaut. But the markets and choices 
are evolving. There are a few successes like Silverlight, Kinect, XNA and 
Office. But generally the article highlights deeper structural and cultural 
issues.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Windows Platform dominance &ndash; Licking the cookie</li> 
<li>Politicized management culture with &ldquo;Made men&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;political assassins&rdquo;</li> 
<li>Lack of urgency &ndash; Massive existing businesses SharePoint is the last 
$1B revenue business</li> 
<li>Killing products too early or too late &ndash; see Courier (too early) and 
Kin (too late it should never have made it to market)</li> 
<li>Stock stagnation &ndash; this has a lot of impact on hiring new talent, 
retaining talent that should retire (under water ESOP buys)</li> </ul> 
<p>There is lots to love about Microsoft. But I think there are even more 
concerns for the future. Just look at what the latest generation of big web 
companies are building on: Yahoo! (PHP, MySQL, Hadoop), Google (Java, Python, 
BigTable),Facebook (PHP, memcache, Cassandra, Linux), LinkedIn (Solaris, 
Tomcat, Oracle),Groupon (Java, Salesforce, EC2, Zynga (PHP, MySql, AMF), Quora 
(MySQL. memcache, PHP). Sure there are shining examples of companies building 
on SharePoint and SQL Server and Azure, but do they have the size and scale of 
those previously mentioned? And look atthe fight for mobile developers. 
Appcelerator&rsquo;squarterly developer survey shows percentage of developers 
&ldquo;very interested&rdquo; in developing for different platforms: iOS (91%); 
Android (85%); Windows Phone (29%); sure it&rsquo;s a head of Blackberry (27%). 
But this just reinforces my concerns and disappointment. Microsoft is a huge 
company. And I hope they can continue to build world class products, markets 
and inspire future developers.</p> Articles / Culture / Microsoft &mdash; 3

<h2>Canadians, Canadians, Canadians</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Steve Ballmer is coming to Toronto. </p> 
<p>He&rsquo;s speaking at the Can&gt;Win initiative presented by The Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce. The event is focused on helping to &ldquo;define 
strategies to secure Canada&rsquo;s global advantage&rdquo;. The effort is 
publishing16 one pagers from thought leaders (there 8 published as of Oct 15, 
2009) in a dialogue on what Canada must do next. I&rsquo;m waiting to see who 
is lined up to round out the remaining 8 dialogue pieces. I am a little 
underwhelmed as none of the published pieces are about telecommunications, 
technology, copyright, education or any of things that interest me. So 
I&rsquo;m hoping based on the event participants that these topics will be 
covered. Speakers like:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Dr. Indira Samarasekera, <br>
President, University of Alberta</li> 
<li>Parker Mitchell <br>
Co-CEO, Engineers without Borders</li> 
<li>Trish Wheaton <br>
Chief Marketing Officer, Chairperson, Wunderman Canada
</li> </ul> 
<p>I&rsquo;m hopeful that there will be some thought pieces on topics that 
interest me.</p> 
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t always a Steve Ballmer fan. He was that funny dancing man 
from Microsoft. But it was at Mix08 that I changed my mind. Sure, I had become 
an employee of Microsoft Canada and ultimately Steve is my boss. But it washis 
interview with Guy Kawasaki that forever changed my opinion of Steve.&nbsp; </p>
<p></p> 
<p>I was impressed with both the depth and breadth of his understanding of the 
Microsoft business. He was informed about strategy, about operations, about 
technology, about sales, about acquisitions. I was just blown away at the 
insight, honesty and the casualness of the conversation. It also helped me 
understand the &ldquo;Developers, developers, developers&rdquo;. Steve is a 
passionate guy. And he&rsquo;s very, very intense.</p> 
<p>If you get a chance, watch the full interview with Guy Kawasaki and Steve 
Ballmer. It changed my opinion.</p> Conferences / Microsoft &mdash; 2 Comments

<h2>Getting ready for PDC</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m starting to get ready for another trip to Los Angeles for 
Microsoft PDC. PDC08 was a great trip, however, it ended really poorly for me. 
I arrived home from LA and spent 5 days in Toronto General Hospital after 
complaining all week about chest pain. It turns out that after aheart attack, 
they take this stuff very seriously, and wanted to do an angiogram. I promise 
for PDC09 to not hole up in my hotel room and hide because my chest hurts!</p> 
<p>Thomas Lewis has a great post on Hotels for PDC09. I&rsquo;ve stayed at the 
Westin Bonaventure for PDC08 and CHI98. It&rsquo;s a great hotel. It was where 
True Lies was filmed.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Where do all the Microsofties hang after the event? If you are a fan 
of edgy chef personalities, you know that you always want to find the dives the 
chefs go to after their shifts are done. Later in the evening, after evening 
events and A/V checks are done, many of our kind will head over to the lobby of 
the<strong>Westin Bonaventure</strong> where everyone will be hanging out at 
the bar chatting up the news of the day and talking with attendees. Now, if you 
are looking to find all the hipster-Microsofties, then you want to head to the 
club at the rooftop of The Standard. The view there is awesome but the drinks 
can get expensive.&rdquo;<em>Thomas Lewis &ndash; Devil&rsquo;s Field Guide to 
the PDC</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>But I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m going to change it up for 2009. I&rsquo;m 
turning over a new leaf. And in a tribute to my turn-of-the-last-century 
industrialists I&rsquo;m thinking theMillennium Biltmore will be my home away 
from home for a few days in November. I stayed in theBiltmore as part of the 
planning committee for CHI2000. And while the hotel is not the family estate, 
it should be fun. It&rsquo;s only a few blocks from Westin, check out myBing 
Collection of the hotels to help find your friends in downtown LA, and 
it&rsquo;s something new. Plus how can you go wrong with the name Biltmore?</p>

<h2>Software, support &amp; visibility</h2> 
<p> It&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;ve asked about startups building on .NET in the 
past. And with the development of programs likeBizSpark the continued support 
of events likeStartupCampMontreal and Founders &amp; Funders, and 
yesterday&rsquo;sfunding announcement at Xobni, there a number of new 
opportunities for startups to get access to free software and exposure.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Microsoft Blue Sky competition for the <em>so-many</em> startuppers 
using MS technology&rdquo; &ndash;Heri </p> </blockquote> 
<p>BizSpark is a program aimed at providing startups with access to software, 
support and visibility. Startups need to meet the following requirements:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Is in the business of software development, </li> 
<li>Is privately held, </li> 
<li>Has been in business for less than 3 years, and </li> 
<li>Has less than US $1 million in annual revenue </li> </ul> </blockquote> 
<p>There are no initial costs. At the end of the three years there is a US$100 
fee. Startups can participate in BizSpark for up to 3 years, (assuming they 
haven&rsquo;t changed ownership or gone public in years 1 or 2). The program 
includesVisual Studio Team System Team Suite (VSTS) with MSDN Premium for 
development, testing and demonstration purposes. There are also production 
licenses for Windows Server, SQL Server, BizTalk Server, and Office SharePoint 
Server. It&rsquo;s a pretty complete package for startups looking to gain 
access to the tools for design and development.</p> 
<h3>How do I sign up?</h3> 
<p>First you need to find a Network Partner. </p> 
<h4>What is a Network Partner?</h4> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Network Partners are active members of the local software ecosystem 
engaged with high-potential, early stage Startups. They are organizations 
specifically focused on supporting software entrepreneurs and Startups, or 
whose activities include a focus on promoting and supporting software Startups, 
through programs, mentoring, networking, business advices, financial and legal 
assistance or similar services and activities.&rdquo; &ndash;Network Partner 
Program Guide</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Basically, these are the folks supporting startups. In Canada today, there 
were over 20 Network partners including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bootup Labs, Inc.</li> 
<li>Canada Web Hosting</li> 
<li>Communitech</li> 
<li>Extreme Venture Partners</li> 
<li>Flow Ventures</li> 
<li>GrowthWorks Capital</li> 
<li>Infusion Angels</li> 
<li>JLA Ventures</li> 
<li>Montreal Start Up</li> 
<li>National Angel Capital Organization</li> 
<li>nGen &ndash; Niagara Interactive Media Generator</li> 
<li>Ontario Centres of Excellence Inc.</li> 
<li>peer1 Networks</li> 
<li>RackForce Networks Inc.</li> 
<li>Tech Capital Partners</li> 
<li>The Launch Factory Inc.</li> 
<li>Wesley Clover International Corporation</li> </ul> 
<p>I keep looking for Network Partners to join the program. I&rsquo;ve been 
working on folks in Alberta, British Columbia and on the East coast. Turns out 
there is a lot of ground to cover in this country. If you have an organization 
that supports start-ups in Edmonton, Calgary, Sudbury, Charlottetown, Halifax, 
Dartmouth, St. John&rsquo;s, Quebec City, Yellowknife,drop me a note and 
I&rsquo;ll do my best to get them to register. Or if you think you should be a 
Network partner,sign up using the Champ ID = <strong>davcrow</strong>. </p> 
<p>If you can&rsquo;t find a Network Partner, drop me a note. </p> 
<h3>Other Programs</h3> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t meet the requirements for BizSpark, there are other 
partner programs. I&rsquo;m not an expert here, I find that most early stage 
companies are limited due to the &ldquo;being in business for less than 3 
years&rdquo;. The other program isEmpower for ISVs. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure 
where you fit if you&rsquo;re offering a SaaS solution outside of BizSpark. But 
there areprograms that can help, check out the SPLA and SaaS On-Ramp Programs
.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>BlueSky &amp; Ignite IT</h3> 
<p>There are 2 programs that offer developers and ISVs an opportunity to 
showcase their products and solutions. TheMicrosoft Blue Sky Innovation 
Excellence Award offers Canada ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) a way to 
gain access to product experts and members of theEmerging Business Team 
Portfolio Managers (think Christopher Griffin, Don Dodge, Cliff Reeves and 
others), exposure onMicrosoftStartupZone and a case study, access to new 
technologies and architectural guidance, software tools, among other things.</p>
<p>The Ignite IT Awards are a Microsoft Canada awards program aimed at 
celebrating the problems that were solved through IT solutions. There are both 
Developer and IT Professional stories. There are 2 prizes of $5,000 along with 
exposure. These aren&rsquo;t primarily startup focused, however, since a lot of 
startups should be using technology to solve a problem and theSubmission Form 
is nothing more than your elevator pitch. It&rsquo;s should be good practice to 
practice giving your pitch and creating a 60 second video demonstrating why 
your solution is valuable. Think demo or clip of happy users. My thought is 
that this could easily be repurposed to help explain to your potential 
customers the power and benefit of your solution.</p>

<h2>Blogging Azure</h2> 
<ul></ul> 
<p> Microsoft released the initial details about the cloud computing platform 
atPDC in October. The platform is roughly a 3 layered approach. Best I can 
figure it&rsquo;s very similar to an existing server configuration. Just like I 
have operating system and server topology in a data center design, I need to do 
the same in building a cloud application.</p> 
<p>Steve Marx provides an example Hello Cloud application in Learning to Build 
on Windows Azure. Basically he writes a standard ASP.NET application, and then 
separately configures the runtime environment. It&rsquo;s interesting because 
it allows for a level of abstraction around the platform: compute, storage and 
management. CloudEnterprise hasan interesting comparison of Windows Azure to 
Amazon AWS, Google App Engine and VMWare.&nbsp;</p> Feature Microsoft Amazon

<p>Table adapted from EnterpriseCloud.info</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to relate it to my experiences building Rails apps and 
deploying on EC2 and S3 instances. It feels different than the Amazon AWS 
approach. It feels less like hosting a VM instance on Amazon infrastructure and 
using their storage and queuing service to scale my architecture. But learning 
to use EC2, S3 and SQS took some time. I&rsquo;m thinking it will take 
additional time and prototyping to learn how to architect and build my web apps 
to run on Azure (bigger challenge seems to be teaching me C#). It&rsquo;s 
different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Improving the mobile browser</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The latest set of announcements at PDC have focused on improving the end 
user and developer user experiences. Windows 7is a continued evolution of the 
desktop user experience.Internet Explorer 8 is a web standards compliant 
browser.</p> 
<p>There is a gaping hole in the browser on Windows Mobile.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Why does a browser on mobile matter? Look at the Rogers market share this 
past quarter as a result of the iPhone. Is it phone bling? Definitely. But it 
is also a device that has a desktop class web browser.</p> 
<p>Skyfire announced their open beta today. It boasts an impressive set of 
features including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>New Super Bar that combines search and URL entry into one bar </li> 
<li>Skyfire can now be set as the default browser </li> 
<li>New search bar on the Homescreen </li> 
<li>New start page redesign </li> 
<li>Faster start-up and page loading times </li> 
<li>Share a link via SMS </li> 
<li>Invite friends to download Skyfire via SMS </li> 
<li>Save an image </li> 
<li>Download files </li> </ul> 
<p>And the best part is that Skyfire also supports Flash video on Windows 
Mobile. The web is the primary distribution channel for content, wether your on 
a mobile phone, a custom application or dedicated device. The richness of the 
experience can be improved (seeLukeW&rsquo;s summary of Mix07 Beyond the Browser
). And it&rsquo;s great to see a desktop class browsing experience come to 
Windows Mobile.</p> Articles / Development / Microsoft &mdash; 6 Comments <br>

<h2>Give customers choice</h2> 
<p>Mark Relph has been talking about Choice and Flexibility (part 2) for 
customers. Today with the announcement ofWindows Azure you can start to see how 
Microsoft is trying to offer the rich user experience choices and the choice of 
infrastructure, on premises or in the cloud, for developers, IT Pros and 
ultimately consumers.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>What you get is the opportunity to figure out what is right for you, your 
developers, your organization, your customers and your applications. The goal 
is to provide designers and developers a common set of Services that can be 
mixed an matched. If your a startup, you can decide to keep your application, 
infrastructure and services in the cloud leveraging the ability to instantly 
scale your applications and manage your costs. If you are an existing company 
with a large IT investment, you can leverage your existing corporate 
infrastructure layering in the pieces that allow you to grow or reduce your 
costs through the economies of scale offered by the cloud services.</p> 
<p>You can start see the applications and tools that Microsoft has been 
shipping in context. Internet Explorer 8 is a tool for accessing software in 
the cloud. Silverlight 2 is a way for designers and developers to create 
compelling rich Internet applications. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is 
a powerful environment for desktop software development. As developers you get 
a shared set of tools (Web Standards, Javascript, JQuery, .NET, XAML, C#, 
VisualStudio 2008) that can be used to build applications and services.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Developers can begin to build solutions that fit the needs of their 
audience. It is about being able to build the right solution for your company, 
your audience, and your market using the appropriate tools and technologies.
ProductWiki is building a web service for open product reviews. Me.dium is 
building a shared social browsing experience.ThoughtFarmer is enterprise 
collaboration tool that lives behind the firewall.Xobni is mail analytics and 
improved communications integrated in Outlook.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s about choice. The choice of device. The choice of user 
experience. The choice that fits your business and your customers. It&rsquo;s 
about the flexibility of the platform to grow and evolve as you do.</p> Articles

<h2>PDC kicks off tomorrow</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Getting ready to head to LA for Microsoft Professional Developers Conference
 (which begs the question as a non-professional developer what am I doing at 
PDC?). I&rsquo;m preparing for a week of some in depth Microsoft experiences 
and announcements. Next to the coffee or the bourbon, the keynotes are the best 
part of a conference. I&rsquo;m expecting big things from Ozzie, Scott Guthrie, 
Steven Sinofsky, and Don Box.</p> 
<p>I love the layout of the Timeline application. It&rsquo;s a great way to 
access details about each session and build a personal schedule. A higher 
resolution monitor (I&rsquo;m running at 1280 x 800) would have meant a little 
less scrolling, but generally a good experience. Here are some of the sessions 
out side of the keynotes I&rsquo;m looking forward to.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Future of C# presented by Anders Hejlsberg </li> 
<li>A Lap around &quot;Oslo&quot; presented by Douglas Purdy, Vijaye Raji </li>
<li>Windows 7: Design Principles for Windows 7 presented by Samuel Moreau </li>
<li>Oomph: A Microformat Toolkit presented by Karsten Januszewski </li> 
<li>Office Business Applications: Enhanced Deployment presented by Saurabh 
Bhatia, Andrew Whitechapel</li> 
<li>Developing for Microsoft Surface presented by Brad Carpenter, Robert Levy 
</li> </ul> 
<p>It&rsquo;s great to see sessions by the Mono team. Having spent a couple of 
days hanging out withGeoff Norton at FSOSS in Toronto.&nbsp; I am blown away by 
the work that is going on by the Novell team and the Silverlight team to build 
a new cross-browser, cross-platform runtime. They are building some great tools.
</p> 
<p>This will be my first deeply Microsoft conference. Yes, I&rsquo;ve attended 
the internal events, but I&rsquo;m really interested in observing and 
participating with the folks that build Windows applications, applications for 
the web on the Microsoft platform and learning more about their experiences.</p>

<p>Inspire the world with just 10k of code.&nbsp; It reminds me of Stuart 
Butterfield&rsquo;s5k competition. It&rsquo;s a great chance to win a 
conference pass, hotel accommodations and a gift card (money) for time in your 
Vegas.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>What could you create for the Web if you only had 10 kilobytes of code? 
It&rsquo;s time to exercise your minimalist creativity and get back to basics 
&ndash; back to optimizing every little byte like your life depended on it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Both of these challenges have the same prize:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>One winner will receive a pass to MIX09, hotel accommodations and a Visa 
gift card. Other great prizes are to be announced. Official entry requirements, 
procedures, rules and restrictions coming in November.</p> </blockquote> <b>
