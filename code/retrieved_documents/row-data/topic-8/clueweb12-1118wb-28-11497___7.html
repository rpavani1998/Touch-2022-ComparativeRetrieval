<h2>GoalStatement</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> I want to understand wikis and online communities. While there are many 
places to discuss, experiment or observe, there is currently no better single 
place thanMeatBall to discuss and learn. </li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> I want to make wikis and online communities available as tools for me and 
my customers. I think they are great for a lot of applications, allowing new 
forms of community and synergy and even global communication.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> I want to be part of the meatball community. I think this is a valuable 
place with interesting people. You can get a lot out of it and it's worth to 
put some effort into it. I'll try to get this into a balance.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> I want to know more about communities in general. I think a community is 
about advantages from synergy. Members have advantages within and from the 
community, the community must have advantages from its members. We are 
inventing a culture of win-win-situations for all that participate.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>InterestStatement</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> I'm a wiki provider and consultant and I want to earn money with wikis. 
My experience since 2000 in short: wiki technology is not enough, you need a 
special social competence, knowledge and culture to make wiki work.MeatballWiki 
always seemed the best place where this knowledge is collected and researched. 
There is no visible end of this learning process. I participate and help to 
grow this knowledge because I need it to be successful.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> May engagement for the concept of patterns should be visible. My latest 
work in this field is a book, &quot;Mustertheorie - Einf&uuml;hrung und 
Perspektiven auf den Spuren von Christopher Alexander&quot;, obviously German, 
published in Oktober 2007. ISBN 978-3-9001402-50-0. It's a paperback, 174 page.
[more...] The title roughly translated: &quot;Pattern Theory - Introduction and 
Perspectives on tha Tracks ofChristopherAlexander&quot;. BTW, I'm starting to 
look for a translater to English. Maybe I'll write a page MusterTheorie? (
PatternTheory) sooner or later. </li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Born 1955 in Salzburg, living in Graz, married, two children. I studied 
Chemistry at the Technical University in Graz and wrote my thesis about 
something like &quot;the molecular simulation of solid-liquid interfaces&quot; 
which involved writing a lot of FORTRAN software. In 1983, at the beginning of 
the PC revolution, I turned to commercial software development, working for the 
&quot;Forschungsgesellschaft Joanneum&quot; until 1988. Since then I have been 
working as an independent software developer and consultant. I feel as a 
communicator and mediator: translating the visions of my customers into 
software and enabling these visions by knowing and showing my customers the 
potentials of new technologies.</p> 
<p> In August 2000 I found WardsWiki and was immediately fascinated. After 
taking part for a few months, I started to study and program systematically to 
make the wiki available for interested people in the German speaking countries 
(Germany, Austria and Switzerland). About a year later everything was in place 
to support all types of (currently about 60) wiki projects at a few servers 
circled aroundhttp://www.wikiservice.at. </p> 
<p> Some examples (most are German): </p> 
<ul> 
<li> http://www.wikiweb.at/wiki.cgi (a closed German wiki information site, 
homage to Ward'shttp://wiki.org) </li> 
<li> http://www.thetolkienwiki.org/wiki.cgi (English) </li> 
<li> http://www.wikiservice.at/dse/wiki.cgi (Dse Wiki=german software 
developers wiki)</li> 
<li> http://www.wikiservice.at/buecher/wiki.cgi (for people that lov 
literature and books)</li> 
<li> http://www.wikiservice.at/gruender/wiki.cgi (for online community 
founders and people that feel similar)</li> 
<li> http://www.wikiservice.at/culios/wiki.cgi, CuliosWelt (for teens) </li> 
<li> http://www.wikiservice.at/esf/wiki.cgi (European social forum, it's 
framed in a number of different websites)</li> 
<li> http://www.wikiservice.at/fractal/wiki.cgi (FractalWiki) </li> 
<li> http://www.prowiki2.org/glarnerschulen/fractal/wiki.cgi (schools of the 
Swiss canton Glarus,AndresStreiff, prime place for wiki applications at school) 
</li> 
<li> http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi (supporting the D programming 
language community)</li> 
<li> http://www.dorfwiki.org/wiki.cgi (English and German, fractal for a 
number of projects)</li> </ul> 
<p> All these wikis are running from the same Wiki:ProWikiSoftware executable 
and are only configured for their different purposes and layouts.</p>

<h3>UseMod software</h3> 
<p> When I first came to the UseModWiki, I was looking for a free Wiki source 
and found everything I was searching for. I had some problems with the 
installation but with the generous help ofCliffordAdams I did it in about a day 
- thank you very much, Cliff! The first wiki was installed (Nov 10, 2000) to 
support a free, noncommercial, multilingual dictionary project[1]. A second 
wiki was installed for a project of the University of Graz[2]. </p> 
<p> A few months later (End of 2000) so many changes had been done to the 
usemod source, so many additions were visible ahead, that a fork was 
unavoidable. I'm sorry for the fork, Cliff, I'll always be in your debt. Now in 
2003 most of the code has been reworked and 3000 lines have grown to 12000 
lines of Perl code.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Choosing wiki software</h3> 
<p> I recommend UseMod software to everyone interested, it is one of the 
finest pieces of code I found during my 25+ years of software development. 
Although there are more than 100 wiki clones, you need only consider these:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> MediaWiki (PHP) </li> 
<li> MoinMoin (Python) </li> 
<li> PhpWiki (PHP) </li> 
<li> PmWiki (PHP, simple, good portal functions) </li> 
<li> ProWiki (Perl, also OpenSource since March 15, 2006) </li> 
<li> SwikiClone (Squeak = Smalltalk) </li> 
<li> TwikiClone (Perl) </li> 
<li> UseMod (Perl) </li> 
<li> ZwikiClone (Zope, Python) </li> </ul> 
<p> Now, everything depends on what you have available (Squeak &lt; Zope &lt; 
Python &lt; PHP &lt; Perl). Perl is available everywhere, but it is not really 
a &quot;clean&quot; language. If you like Perl: TWiki is the complicated 
administrators intranet dream,UseMod is the simple and extendable choice for 
open communities. If you prefer Zope, Smalltalk, Python you have only one 
choice. Using PHP you will probably useMediaWiki if you have an encyclopedia 
application,PmWiki if you like a portal layout, PhpWiki otherwise. So I think 
the choice is rather simple.</p> 
<p> But if you don't want to develop and maintain your own wiki software, I 
recommend that you contact me. I can guarantee that as a wiki founder you will 
more than busy and happy to think about and grow your content and community. 
Let me provide everything else you need. --HelmutLeitner </p>

<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> I'm quite happy with it, yes. It's interesting how different German wiki 
communities develop compared to international English communities. Some 
problems there are no problem here and vice versa. --HelmutLeitner </dd> </dl> 
<p> What kinds of problems are/are not present here/there? --ss </p> 
<p> Ok, some differences that are remarkable to me: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> In German wikis real names are used without problems and without the need 
of explicit rules about them (one could say: less problems with the concepts of 
&quot;order&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot;). There are nickname wikis, but 
only because the founders went into that directions (and the negative impact is 
obvious).</li> 
<li> instead of &quot;authority and anonymity&quot; German communities have 
constant discussions about &quot;truth and reality&quot;.</li> 
<li> A lot of German netizens and experts prefer to participate in English 
(international) communities. Typically I see this as a disadvantage, but it 
also means more &quot;normal people&quot;, more &quot;application 
orientation&quot; and more &quot;usability feedback&quot;. E. g. there seem to 
be more German than English schools that use wikis.</li> 
<li> The smaller percentage of dp experts increases the chance for female 
participation (one wiki has 30+% female contributors) because expert language 
(male jargon) seems to be a major negative influence.</li> 
<li> the commercial and technological view onto online communities is - while 
still dominant - much less dominant in the German communities.</li> 
<li> the minimalistic wiki layouts are a big problem in German communities, 
because &quot;normal people&quot; are more impressed by design quality than 
experts.FormOverContent is a tough message with us. </li> 
<li> the smaller &quot;language space&quot; seems to create a situation felt 
more comfortable, maybe because the public is smaller, maybe because the 
contexts of the participants are less different.</li> 
<li> one can't feel that tension between the mainstream participants (young, 
male, urban, north-american, ...) and a large silent public that doesn't fit 
this pattern well.</li> </ul> 
<p> I would assume most of these characteristics are less specific German than 
European (less experts =&gt; more female participation) or general (smaller 
public =&gt; more comfortable).</p> 
<p> -- HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Helmut, I may be dense, but I don't see the problems the pages 
WikiPediaIsNotTypical and WikiPediaIsNotAnEncyclopedia are meant to solve. I 
know I often say Wikipedia isn't a wiki, but mostly for the same reasons I say
VotingIsEvil: to create enough room for a real discussion of why some 
HardSecurity thing they are doing is not necessarily the best or only solution. 
I've also been known to say Wikipedia is not an encyclopedia when the conflict 
of the day happens to be mostly caused by intolerance to messiness due to fear 
of being a print-quality reference work, but that doesn't seem to be the your 
point either. --SunirShah </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> Sorry, you are right of course. There is something on my mind but I can't 
grasp it. I thought it would become clearer when talking about it. Delete these 
pages if you prefer. Or shall I do it? --HelmutLeitner </dd> </dl> 
<p> I'll let you decide to delete them. </p> 
<p> Is your concern the negative pressure on wikidom, and the general 
disintegration of wikidom?WikiPediaIsNotTypical seems to speak to that. -- 
SunirShah </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> WikiPediaIsNotTypical is an old page. I just read it again and I still 
think it very interesting. Of course it may be seen as a problem when one 
community talks about the other. Does it create problems for meatball in the 
relationship to theWikiPedia? In a way it is unavoidable to look at 
WikiPediaThePhenomenon?. What about refactoring these pages under a more 
neutral page title? --HelmutLeitner </dd> </dl> 
<p> </p>  Incidentally in case you think I am too sensitive to criticism you 
are welcome to rubbish what I've put on yourWhatIsScience page -- AndrewCates

explore things together. I hope that<em>you</em> will tolerate the nonsense I 
produce. --HelmutLeitner </dd> </dl>

<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> No, I didn't know it. Thank you for the link. -- HelmutLeitner </dd> </dl>
<p> Helmut: </p> 
<p> I like your suggestion of building a list of possible topics and the 
methodology you suggest. Furthermore, I suggest that we may wish to try to 
Categorize it a bit sooner rather than later. After all, our mutual interest in 
Collaboration should encompass the participation of others, especially since my 
first Post was onBrainstormMode in response to a question I found there from 
KatherineDerbyshire which not only caught my attention, but also yours and that 
ofMarkDilley. In fact, I would have posted this material on the original page, 
but was concerned a bit about making too much of a mess there since I am not 
yet quite comfortable enough with theUseMod markup to not worry about having to 
refactor the page later. I'm also not quite sure how I would incorporate this 
material into Sunir's opening suggestions regarding how to brainstorm here at 
Meatball, so I'm being a bit cautious for that reason too (especially, since I 
think I am more like you in that I may &quot;prefer a more piecemeal 
approach&quot;).</p> 
<p> As a compromise of all of these considerations: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> I've added three items to the alphabetic sequence you started, </li> 
<li> Written a very preliminary statement of Objectives, and </li> 
<li> Moved the material to the original page. </li> </ul> 
<p> I hope you approve and that you feel free to edit in any way whatsoever.

committee representative personally? I'm trying to decide whether to attend or 
to offer to present. Thanks (in advance). --HansWobbe </p> 
<p> Hans, yes, of course I'm planning to go to WikiSym 2005. I've no 
informations about other participants yet and I don't know anyone face 2 face. 
It's still too early to know what will happen but I think it will be worthwhile 
anyway, either small and family-like or bigger, a signal of breakthrough. Hope 
to meet you (you all) there. --HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> Great! It's going to be a bit of a juggling exercise for me to attend, but 
I'll make an attempt. Hopefully we will have this chance to meet. Would it be 
worth while to add our names to a list of (potential) attendees? --HansWobbe.

ex Banker ;-)) I hope you can make it. It does look as if I am going to be able 
to make this trip work since I have to be in San Francisco at the end of 
October, so I'm simply thinking I'll doing two conferences for the cost of one 
flight.<strong>Humour only warning</strong>: Now, if only I knew someone on the 
review committee, so I'd be able to ... :-) --HansWobbe. </dd> </dl> 
<p> </p>  Helmut, 
<p> You said this of K<strong></strong>mWiki: &quot;... I introduced myself 
there and for weeks there was no answer. It had no community feeling, more like 
people working on their projects, takaing notes side by side.... &quot;</p> 
<ul> 
<li> You may be interested in commenting on Wiki:RoleOfRecentChanges where I 
have made some related remarks on 13Apr05</li> </ul> 
<p> Re: &quot; (C2) not my primary wiki to discuss general pattern or wiki 
issues. If you want to transfer it to C2, feel free to do so.&quot;</p> 
<ul> 
<li> I may take up invitation and copy (not transfer)your new pattern writeup 
to C2.InterWiki does not seem to work as well yet. Maybe a healthy fork will 
emerge :)</li> </ul> 
<p> Re: &quot; I'll look into Wiki:SildaBeDiscussions ...&quot; </p> 
<ul> 
<li> If you do have observations and/or suggestions it is probably better 
placed in theCtwoCommentary I have created here. It has an example section on 
that encounter.</li> </ul> 
<p> I also have responded more to your contrbution to Wiki:CtwoBusinessValue. 
I have added some clarifications (e.g. reWiki:CrazyThingsThatMightSaveWiki) It 
has not attracted much (edit) attention, so maybe we can continue again in
CtwoCommentary here. </p> 
<p> I am not sure how to respond to your question of my views of Wiki mission. 
But can I offer you some of my usages, as examplified inWiki:GiveAndTake? </p> 
<p> Thanks for showing up again on WardsWiki -- DavidLiu </p> 
<p> David, I suppose you got little feedback because people basically agree 
with your observations. Meta-discussion were never loved by the C2 community, 
so that's why mb came into existance. When I founded the GermanDseWiki I found 
the same problem. Only a small percentage of the members (who were primarily 
interested in software) were also interested in talking about wiki details. In 
the end I split it into two wikis, just the same. This seems to be a standard
TargetGroup and founder problem. Never assume that a single online community 
can fit your interests and communication needs (they will change anyway).</p> 
<p> I agree with the RecentChangesAttentionSeeking you observed. PageBrushing? 
is a bad habit, but there are even some founders who do it regularly. The other 
one might be called HeadlinePage?. All this isn't needed when communication is 
working. --HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> Helmut where did I made observations on RecentChangesAttentionSeeking? 
What is ur time now as I just got up, and hopefully refreshed.</p>

</dl> 
<p> Helmut, I think the discussion you had with Costin at 
Wiki:WardsWikiProblemsDiscussion, where Costin held point of &quot;no current 
Wiki Community&quot; is a real enough aspect to be considered by all who wants 
C2 to succeed. And like it or not, RA point of &quot;Ward may not want wiki to 
grow&quot; is another consideration. Currently lots of discussion is here at
MeatBall in page CtwoCommentary. Its chaotic but it is wiki :) -- dl </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> <em>I'm just trying to understand the C2 situation, one can't from 
outside. It seems that people don't talk to each other, often hide their 
identity - as if this behaviour is meant to protect them. Very unusual. Then 
this &quot;it's terrible, but that's wiki&quot; attitude.WardsWiki isn't a 
typical wiki and it isn't as wiki should be. You are lost, if you use it as a 
reference system. --HelmutLeitner</em> </dd> </dl>

old (recent edits turned off, no page history, no one-click diff+page

their wiki although they still cling to it. It would be a job for a 
&quot;online community consultant&quot; to resolve these problems. --

<p> Helmut, see first Sunir comments in above paragraph. Then I would like to 
draw your attention toWiki:CommunityProblems and related pages. Lastly I like 
yourReflectionCommunity title but there is little in that page for me to 
comprehend. Any chance there is some resemblance to Reflection techniques used 
in Gestalt Therapy? --DavidLiu </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> <em>David, don't know much about these techniques and I didn't think in 
that direction. The point is, that I think society, organizations and processes 
will change, because of the new ways to cooperate in online communities. Sunir 
has done a lot of work about the changes expected or needed within the 
scientific system. I have thought a little about future book production. A lot 
of people are seeking a new economy and takeOpenSource as a model and derive 
its attractiveness from &quot;it's free&quot;. I think thats wrong, it's all 
about &quot;more participation&quot;. You want to care aboutWardsWiki and 
therefore you do it, you invite people to discuss it. In any old system you 
wouldn't be allowed to do this, being &quot;none of your business&quot;. In the 
future everything will be our business, depending only on our own capacity and 
interest. And people will demand the necessary transparency, cooperation and
FairProcess. -- HelmutLeitner</em> </dd> </dl>

English. I once introduced the pageTemporalContext to Ctwo and someone 
complained about using &quot;difficult terms&quot; (forgot how he/she worded it 
exactly). I am having a headache in things likeSuperordinateGoal, and often 
been wondering what extent of relevance these have to my needs to get informed 
on &quot;practical aspects&quot; of communications and teambuilding in an 
organization (not online community per se). I suspect there are lots of overlap 
and I like some one who have knowledge on both to share some insights.</p> 
<p> BTW, just saw W<strong></strong>ikiPediaIsNotTypical type discussions 
earlier in your page. And I have been wondering howcomeWikiSym has no WikiPedia 
presence. I must go read some relevant pages and come to understand bit more.
</p> 
<p> Cheers from DavidLiu </p> 
<p> JimboWales? will be at WikiSym. Wikipedia is having their own conference, 
Wikimania, in August. As for the Dummy's Guide,
http://meatballsociety.org/cgi-bin/wiki-guide is supposed to be this guide, and 
I have to write it by October forWikiSym. It will be under some 
PrimarilyPublicDomain or ShareAlike license just as soon as I get around to 
putting that notice there. --SunirShah </p> 
<p> Helmut Sunir answered the question re: Dummy's Guide in prior revision 
here. I am still interested in &quot;tips to successful online collaboration 
within a business organization&quot;. Since you have expressed interests in 
&quot;growing&quot; Ctwo, I will create a section in my homepage here with 
links to C2 pages related to that aspect, and bigger issues 
(opportunities/risks) I will still go through theCtwoCommentary page I have 
created. Please offer your views generously and frequently, or better still, 
get moreMeatBall people to offer their views at WardsWiki. </p> 
<p> Lastly on M<strong></strong>arkParrot, I take it this community has not 
yet startedDissuadeInteraction, so my suggestion is actually for him to go to 
WardsWiki and chair the Wiki:MeatBallCommentary discussion which I have created 
and welcome him to participate. If he agrees to do so there, we can see whether 
he will be accepted by members atWardsWiki. </p> 
<p> -- DavidLiu 20Apr update </p> 
<p> I deleted that page. Don't discuss our internal affairs on another site. 
We do not tolerate people extending their internal disputes here. Even
CtwoCommentary is inappropriate. -- SunirShah </p> 
<p> David, I'd like to help you with C2 but I think you can change the 
situation only from within. That means you mustn't concentrate on what you or 
other people want C2 to be, but put considerable energy in adding value - and 
work there. Otherwise the majority will see you as an outsider, not a member. 
You must become important for the community before you can change things of 
importance. I went to C2 and showed my face but there is little interest in 
what help I have to offer, so naturally I do not insist. Personally I dislike 
to talk about C2 in this situation, although I don't think it is inappropriate. 
The developments at C2 are notOffTopic here - CtwoCommentary may be undesirable 
because it might polarize the two communities. Meatball internals may be felt
OffTopic at C2, but that's not our business. -- HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> To Sunir/Helmut </p> 
<p> I apologize for getting people here upset for the MeatBall page I have 
created over there. But at the same time I did it in good faith and still think 
it was appropriate &quot;at the time&quot;. I have to thank Helmut for the 
&quot;be careful&quot; reminder there, as I was indeed a bit getting carried 
away about &quot;possibilities&quot;, which would need to be balanced with 
&quot;practicalities&quot;.</p> 
<p> Please allow the page to stay longer, and I will respond in my homepage 
here about future/ further annoyances/inconveniences caused to this community. 
I wish to discuss ideas (e.g. &quot;entry/exit protocol&quot;) and happened to 
used a real event to do so. Thanks for your extra patience. --DavidLiu </p> 
<p> Helmut your observations about C2 is excellent and eventually I would like 
to copy it over to C2 for the benefit of the community there. I cannot add to 
that observation as it would only add confusion. Thanks again --DavidLiu 22Apr 
morning</p> 
<p> Ummm...Sunir, discussing something about MeatBall on c2 may well be argued 
to be inappropriate for some reason, but it seems really bizarre to<strong>
forbid</strong> it, as you seem to have done above. Isn't that contrary to your 
usual philosophy, for one thing? It also gets into questions of enforcement if 
someone disagreed...EditWar that c2 page? Ban the user from MeatBall if they go 
against your will on the subject? It just seems rather peculiar.</p> 
<p> This is quite aside from whether that c2 page should exist (I agree with 
Helmut that it's off topic for c2, is all). --DougMerritt </p> 
<p> You're right. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking very clearly at 3am. I 
shouldn't have been so curt or quick to respond when my wits weren't fully with 
me. --SunirShah </p> 
<p> No problem, happens to all of us. :-) -- DougMerritt </p> 
<p> Just testing edit. Wasn't working for me (led me in 60+ seconds timeout) 
an hour ago. --HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> This time it worked within about 15 sec. -- HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> work quickly this time too, BTW I am at work and currently blacked out 
from C2. Think caused by current external facing IP (changes from time to time) 
being on C2 ban list since Mar05 -- dl</li> 
<li> continued...BTU are u showing your name at C2 at least once a day, like 
you suggested to me? You may also be interested in knowing about the QuickDiff? 
onDavidLiu I did on C2 this morning, around GMT 0th hour from home. -- dl </li> 
</ul> 
<p> David, yes I do. But when people answer, this becomes invisible (BTW on 
our wikis this isn't the case, look for example[3]). I've still to understand 
WardsWiki standards, especially people deleting content without reasoning or 
consensus (like CommunityProcess?) and people creating pages without giving 
their best (like CommunityProcess?). I asked Ron about that and we have an 
e-mail exchange (this tendency towards backstage communications also bothers 
me). It is a strange culture for me. -- Helmut</p> 
<p> Helmut, </p> 
<p> Latest news is Costin threatening a MindWipe?. Ironic as it was only a few 
days after I asked him whether hisWiki:WikiChangePropoal can defend against a 
hostile Costin.</p> 
<p> I think I contribted to the confusion between &quot;Costin the 
person&quot; vs &quot;Costin like behavior&quot;. The latter is the negative 
side such as arrogance. &quot;Costin the person&quot; has positive traits which 
I have taken for granted, such as clear thinking, diligence, etc.</p> 
<p> &quot;Following are my current and rambling views. Subjected to change as 
usual.&quot; I think Doug Merritt is not the only one who thinks I create too 
many pages, I know of at least one other who used to flame me using an 
unidentified IP at C2.</p> 
<p> I did create a lot of C2 pages, typically of three kinds 1) appln &amp; 
implementation related; 2) management and life strategy oriented; 3) wiki 
community &amp; communication oriented material.</p> 
<p> First two are considered to be marginally acceptable by the current group 
which is still strongly Unix biased. (At this moment computer science oriented 
page are mainstream, followed by XP and maybe technical wiki implementation 
stuff).</p> 
<p> As to 3), I think Costin is again not the only one who think I am 
inexperienced. It is true that I only started &quot;contributing in 2004&quot;, 
did not know a lot of &quot;social norms&quot; before I started to write, ask a 
lot of &quot;basic technical (unix) questions &quot; etc. People who are 
expecting contributions from &quot;better qualified (academic) people&quot; has 
been disappointed with my &quot;quality of contributions&quot;.</p> 
<p> Another viewpoint I have about the &quot;current contributors&quot; are 
that most of them are probably very young (work experience wise) and very 
bright (one approaching grand master level skill in chess, if not already 
there). The fact that Doug Merritt is able to be accepted there (he is older, 
based on his slips about his experience) shows the depth and breadth of his 
knowledge, in addition to his willingness to be the &quot;bad guy&quot; 
(aggressive gnome).</p> 
<p> I tend to think there are &quot;regular readers&quot; that are &quot;not 
contributors&quot;, yet do appreciate more current information about 
&quot;industry news / events&quot;. Since I have zero exposure to &quot;open 
source&quot; application development and appear to be &quot;promoting&quot; the 
much hated Microsoft I am not winning new friends fast enough.</p> 
<p> People like RA (the one no longer there) reflect a segment that the 
&quot;current contributors&quot; (meaning Costin camp) can do without. RA, and 
to some extent I get included, represent people that do not have good 
understanding of IT/computer science (e.g. teaching sector). They are verbose 
and are waste of time. These &quot;lesser people&quot; may be accepted if they 
just keep quiet and do the &quot;wiki chores&quot; (e.g. despam, fix up tabs). 
I have seldom seen the &quot;C2 high flyers&quot; doing these chores (not going 
to gain popularity with this last statement of mine).</p> 
<p> I think the majority of the contributors at C2 think &quot;application 
development and implementation&quot; mean writing compilers, devicing new Perl 
scripts against newly identified exposures, intricate 3D game programming, etc.
</p> 
<p> You may wish to find out for yourself what other people think &quot;Who is 
the community&quot; at C2, and if you get them to speak out you will have 
material for a good page about C2.</p> 
<p> <strong>My biggest lament about the site is that the worst enemies of the 
site started out as enthusiastic supporters. We need a way to ''&quot;Break 
that Pattern&quot;';</strong>'. </p> 
<p> David, it's hard for me to comment. It's necessary to find some common 
ground. This means that everyone has to compromise somewhat and accept that his 
view is not absolute, me, you, everyone! What are the expectations when someone 
creates a page? What is acceptable content (to avoidOffTopic for a moment)? How 
are de-facto decisions like the RA-ban treated (accepted, respected)? What are 
the options? What do you think are the positions of the other active users? 
What is your position? Where do you want to insist and where are you willing to 
compromise?</p> 
<p> Note that discussing RA issues is difficult, because he is banned and the 
issue has not settled. I've currently a friendly relationship to him, but I was 
once under the fiercest attacks imaginable - almost for nothing - and I'm not 
sure to never come into that situation again.</p> 
<p> Completely open and free communities are impossible, not because a 
community can't be open for difficult people, but because the community is then 
closed for people that haven't grown a skin 2 inched thick. Have you thought 
about why there are so few women atWardsWiki? It's not impossible, I've founded 
a community that has 40+% of female authors! If I have to choose I prefer a 
hundred civilized people to 3 difficult ones. There seems to be no way to have 
them both.</p> 
<p> A community can handle bans in a better way. For example I once banned EG 
(the only user I ever banned) because he simply became unbearable to me. I 
would have preferred otherwise (stand him longer, have a community decision). 
But I declared that I would unban him as soon as two members supported him (
Gr&uuml;nderWiki is a small community) and took some reponsibility for him. It 
took about four months until he got that support. He can write again, he 
contributes occasionally and there have been no problems since. --HelmutLeitner 
</p> 
<p> </p>  Thanks for the revert! -- Earle 
<p> </p> 
<p> Helmut, I find your method of converting the unwanted or unexpected into 
the constructive and collaborative to be inspiring. I just wanted to shoot you 
a smile in appreciation, since it's so hard to do that over the 'net. ;) --
SunirShah </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Thank you for writing WikiCooperationArticle . Should I link to 
http://wiklossary.nearlythere.com/ at the end of it? Sometimes the &quot;more 
and more links to information -- where does it ever stop?&quot; seems 
overwhelming. I don't want to ruin the &quot;everything you need to know about 
wiki on one page&quot; quality theWikiCooperationArticle has now. -- DavidCary 
</p> 
<p> Hi Helmut, </p> 
<p> After a long quiet, I went away and implemented a new CDML evaluator 
(lex/yacc based in python) which I'm using in Cerenity (http://cerenity.org/ )- 
which hasn't had a very wide release yet, but is fun so far. One site that's 
using it is the Kamaelia site - here:http://kamaelia.sourceforge.net/Home . 
Cerenity is now using a lex/yacc based parser for parsing the CDML. There's a 
few boundary cases (as you might expect) that cause a few problems, but 
generally these have worked quite nicely. Cerenity also only uses CDML for 
semantic or structural things, rather than simple markup, which I thought you 
might find interesting. (examples would be tab bars, indices, transclusions)</p>
<p> The really nice thing I like about your CDML though is the fact you can 
decide to markup text using a new CDML tag, and just let it exist with the text 
passed through BEFORE you write the code to understand the tag. Makes life a 
lot simpler, meaning you can put the cart before the horse if you like :-) 
Thought you might find it interesting.</p> 
<p> -- MichaelSamuels </p> 
<p> Michael, thank you for your work and for the information. Yes, I find it 
interesting and I'm happy that you find CDML as useful as I do. --HelmutLeitner 
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> I like your new mantra. -- SunirShah </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Hi Helmut, great to meet you at WikiSym. I'm trying to expand on 
WikiEnginesWithSisterSites. Can you point to examples and more information about
ProWiki's implementation? I could only find it briefly mentioned at 
http://www.prowiki.com/prowiki/wiki.cgi?AdvancedWikiFeatures --JohnAbbe </p> 
<p> John,it was a big pleasure to meet you. Where does a longer description 
fit in? I currently use the method only for the 80 wikis on myProWiki servers. 
If a wiki participates it writes its page changes to sister site log files 
/sistersite/pagename.sis in the format &quot;second[+|-]interwiki&quot;. It is 
then very efficient to read this sis file through a hash to get at sister pages 
list. It would be also efficient to distribute external incremental page index 
log (e. g. /interwiki/pagename.log) entries &quot;second[+|-]pagename&quot; to 
the sis files. --HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Hi Helmut, thank you for the very nice WikiSym memory photo. I'm so glad 
that I got to meet you and hang out with you atWikiSym. Warmest Regards -- 
BrandonCsSanders </p> 
<p> </p>  Helmut I have more background information at your C2 Home Page. But 
you would need to follow some links there to appreciate what I mean by 
dishonest editing --DavidLiu 22Nov05 
<p> David, I've currently no time to look into this. I'm also no a referee for 
c2. Perhaps you could write a little about what you mean by DishonestEditing? 
or - perhaps less offensive - UnfairEditing?. -- ~~~~ </p> 
<p> Hi Helmut. I tried to send you an email and it bounced back from chello.at 
(Jan 3rd, 2006). The server is apparently frustrated that you take too long a 
vacation and your mailbox is full :) Send me an email when you get back to 
work. --CostinCozianu </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Why don't you raise your objections on DAR wiki itself, Helmut? I'm sure 
they'd find it easier to answer them on a wiki they actually watch. Try[DAR 
wiki:Barn raising] perhaps. -- ChrisPurcell </p> 
<p> Chris, </p> 
<ul> 
<li> The answer goes with the request, just as I answer your question here, 
where you have written.</li> 
<li> I think it would be more impolite to criticize their project at their 
home than here.</li> 
<li> I want others that look for help here to understand that it is important 
to be clear about the mission.</li> 
<li> If they actually do not watch MeatballWiki and this page, what reason 
could they have to expect help?</li> </ul> -- HelmutLeitner 
<p> If someone in a village puts up posters saying when they are having a 
barn-raising, it makes no sense to write your reply on a poster. If they are 
looking for support, they may put up messages on several friendly-looking 
wikis. You can duplicate the text on their wiki. I'm sure they'd find it 
helpful:CriticismIsFeedback. -- ChrisPurcell </p> 
<p> Well, our MeatballMission might indicate why they'd expect help. I'll see 
what I can do. --SunirShah </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <em>On SuggestedWikiRoleModel</em>: Personally, I found it fascinating and 
very useful; I've used the terminology in two place now, (the 
&quot;Evolutionary Nexus&quot; website, where I was arguing forSoftSecurity, 
and showing the ways things can be, and onCommunityWiki, on several occasions.) 
and I can say: It was really useful!</p> 
<p> I agree partly with Sunir: We should &quot;just let people be 
people.&quot; But I think that these<em>rough expectations</em> are sufficient 
to communicate how the community sees itself. They can say, &quot;It's not 
exactly like this, but here is a base line of our personal expectations.&quot; 
Someone may disagree, and overstep theGuidePosts. But, that's okay, and is 
supposed to be allowed: That's why they're guide posts, and not fences, after 
all.</p> 
<p> But I'm mainly just putting in my two cents: I loved that project. </p> 
<p> -- LionKimbro </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Could you mark adding a category as a CopyEdit, Helmut? It saves 
HijackingRecentChanges. -- ChrisPurcell </p> 
<p> Sorry for the inconvenience. -- Helmut </p> 
<p> Helmut, what do you think about the TwinWikiBall project? -- FridemarPache 
</p> 
<p> </p>  Thank you so very much, my WikiFriend. A BarnStar does not even come 
close to letting me express my appreciation.
<p> I think there must be a way of adding a factor into a TrustMetric that 
better quantifies what I am trying to say, but now is not a time when I can 
focus on mathematical models. --HansWobbe </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Hello Helmut, pondering about your cryptic message &quot;OpenBusiness
+=cat&quot;, suggesting that something is added toOpenBusiness, I googled for it
</p> 
<p> Google:&quot;OpenBusiness+=cat&quot; no entry Google:&quot;+=cat&quot; 
425,000,000, i.e. 425 million entries</p> 
<p> At least I found: [a big collection of funny cat photos]. </p> 
<p> This helped me to relax in lots of big laughter, because today I am 
preparing my tax declaration for tomorrow. And we all know, this is much less 
fun, than practisingOpenBusiness. Even Einstein said something like: &quot;Tax 
declarations are more difficult than Relativity Theory&quot;. :-)</p> 
<p> I hope, that you or some other friendly, appreciated, collaborative, 
constructive peer takes the free TLDs WikiCat?.com, .net, .. for being 
developed in someOpenBusinessWiki like MeatballWiki or whereever you suggest, 
such that we can help each other toCreateAndShareWealth. </p> 
<p> ... </p> 
<p> After publishing my message on MeatballWiki, I just waited from 15:10 
until ca. 15:50, then I bought the TLDs to prevent, that WikiCat? is bought by 
&quot;third parties&quot;, not intrinsically involved in wiki, but only 
speculating on cat(chy) domain-names. You know how many entries there are under
Google:wiki and Google:cat. Now think of a cat(alog) of all wikis, practising 
OpenBusiness. As logo and for funny animations to make searching the tables 
(like a cat searches mice) more enjoyable we can get lots ofCreativeCommons 
pictures of funny cats. Please make a suggestion how we can market this idea 
for a maximum ofCreatingAndSharingWealth in the community. To check, that I 
have really bought the domains, click[4][5][6][7]. Please suggest a wiki and/or 
aWikiPage to redirect the URLs for practising OpenBusiness. </p> 
<p> -- FridemarPache </p> 
<p> Fridemar, sorry for the mental turmoil I created. &quot;+=cat&quot; is a 
kind of programmers slang, meaning &quot;added a category&quot;. With respect 
to you concepts, I'm still a lurker, failing to understand the gist of it. --
HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> Helmut, you know, that I programmed in C++ and other object-oriented 
C-dialects. And nearly all modern Computer languages offer the incremental 
assignment operator .. My last programming was Midi2Kb, a program that lets you 
use a piano Midi Kb as a PC keyboard extension. To the gist: &quot;Nothing is 
more powerful than an idea that comes at the right time&quot;. The wiki-mind is 
now getting aware of its own economic strength. We are seeing now the awakening 
of the Web 2.O, which is not only a semantic web, but a social pragmatic web 
too. Everyone is invited to participate inCreatingAndSharingWealth, especially 
the wikizens.OpenBusiness in wikis appears to be the advent of the vision of the
CluetrainManifesto. As an aside, it won't take long and some hundred million 
newcomer kids (OneLaptopPerChild project of the MIT) from developing countries 
will look for the lowest cost entry into the high tech content industry. I tell 
you, they will find and/or create aSocialCommonWealth. We are here to help each 
other. -- fridemar</p> 
<p> Fridemar, it is a sad fact, that the MeatballWiki community, however much 
we appreciate it and try to make it socially open, people from 
non-western-industrial countries or lower education don't join in. It is also a 
fact that the world is turning more and more into a casino-like economy, where 
reactions of an abstract market are unpredictable and people make their 
&quot;bets&quot; and hope for their luck.MemeHunting is just one kind of doing 
this, invent something and be positive, try to hype it. My personal attitude is 
to neglect this CasinoMainstream?, trying to do things that make holistic sense 
instead. Usually this is paid badly but my personal feeling in doing so is 
good, and I know quite a number of people that share this attitude. --
HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> Helmut, the common denominator I see, is the &quot;holistic&quot; 
approach. Until now, most of us were conditioned, to have &quot;a good 
feeling&quot;, when we contribute to wikis, although &quot;this is paid 
badly&quot;, or in less euphemistic terms: &quot;having a good feeling with 
unpaid work&quot;. This is another good example, how we are all doomed by the
StayPoor meme. I had this &quot;pattern&quot; too. Isn't it more holistic, to 
integrate the economic dimension into to all the more or less high-pitched 
reflexions, we do in the wikis. Excluding the economic wealth-creating effects 
of the collaborative work of the wikizens is not holistic enough for more and 
more wikizens. Each wiki peer, who works 8 hours daily in wikis and blogs 
should at least have an income of 2000 US$ a month from their wiki work, so 
that they are free to dedicate their best ideas, knowledge and skills to the 
prospering of the planet, without being hampered by paid work for &quot;third 
parties&quot;, who are not interested in the wellbeing of the whole planet. --
[fridemar] </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> Fridemar, I never followed the StayPoor meme. I'm an independent software 
developer and when I sawWardsWiki in August 2000, I saw an economic chance. I 
startedWikiService and rented wikis ever since, continuously earning money with 
wiki. That this is a highly competitive market and that it turned out to be 
less profitable than expected, that is a different story. I do earn money and I 
want to earn money with my wiki expertise, next year more than this year and 
the year before.</dd> </dl> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> It's great that you also have an economic model to make wiki work 
profitable and I wish you the best, but I do not understand it and therefore it 
doesn't motivate me to participate.</dd> </dl> 
<p> Helmut... </p> 
<p> It gives me considerable comfort to know that you are &quot;still 
lurking&quot;. After all, I generally find myself using you as a type of 
Audience &quot;protoType&quot; for the material I post, wondering ... &quot;Can 
I justify this adequately to Helmut?&quot; I find this helps me word those 
things I really care about, much more carefully. (Think of this as a type of 
Virtual Collaboration or even theBrainStorming we tried a few years ago.) -- 
HansWobbe. </p>

<li> I'll try to contact you as soon as I return for an actual conversation. 
That should be the week starting July 9th. --HansWobbe </li> </ul> 
<p> Hans and Helmut, what about BrainStorming StayPoor, in a real relaxed way. 
Please Helmut, don't be angry with me, if I take a quotation of you intoStayPoor
. I appreciate you both, no polemics intended, but social awareness-work. --
[fridemar] </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> Fridemar, isn't this a bit paradoxical? That you invite me to an unpaid 
discussion atStayPoor? -- Helmut (P.S. why should I be angry for the honour 
that you cite me?)
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> Helmut, you made an excellent joke, making aware the current paradoxical 
situation in wikis. I appreciate it in the same sense as Zen practicing peers 
appreciate the paradoxical effects near Satori. :-) --[fridemar] </dd> </dl> 
</dd> </dl> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Helmut, please notify in the digest, if you erase announced links of your 
peers, like done onWorkNet, without leaving an erase notice in the digest. 
Instead of this you left the original link notice in the digest (&quot;.. added 
some queries for the convenience&quot; ), such that peers, who appreciate the 
pre-established one-click google-searches, are confused, when they don't find 
them. -- fridemar</p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> Fridemar, sorry for any inconvenience I caused ... but what digest are 
you talking about? Would you kindly introduce me to a peer that appreciates the 
search links? --HelmutLeitner </dd> </dl> 
<p> Helmut, it's ok. </p> 
<p> Hey, we all use the digest, but thanks to a wiki conversation with Chris 
and Lion, I myself learned to appreciate this little marvel:DigestedSummary 
with extra care. Instead of writing</p> 
<pre> Fridemar: please notify in the digest, if you erase announced links of 
your peers .. / what digest</pre> we are recommended both to improve our 
writing something like:
<pre> Fridemar asks to notify in the digest when announced and given links by 
some author are erased by some other author. Helmut asks what digest is 
referred to.</pre> 
<p> Of course it would have even be a better formulation of 
&quot;Fridemar&quot;, if he had used the termDigestedSummary. </p> 
<p> Perhaps we can find one or another compromise, e.g.: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> on a new intro page, where the initial author has not yet made all 
his/her intended references explicit (e.g. on another new page as you did) it 
might be helpful to leave generic queries to Google, because this
<ul> 
<li> saves keystrokes to the peers, who want to explore the context and to

<dd> Fridemar, it may not seem this way to you, but by overwhelming pages with 
links to Google,<em>you</em> are destroying the accepted structure of the wiki: 
namely, that of aPatternLanguage specific to that wiki. You are changing the 
very nature of wiki (c.f.WhatIsaWiki), so the burden of proof is on <em>you</em>
 to prove that this makes sense and is welcome to the community. (Note that 
this is nothing to do with the discussion aboutDigestedSummary, which I agree 
with you on.) --ChrisPurcell </dd> </dl> 
<p> Chris, thank you for signaling the agreement on the DigestedSummary 
guidelines. I noticed that even Sunir doesn't strictly follow these guidelines. 
The same behaviour can be seen in the contributions of other appreciated active 
peers of this wiki. Fortunately we know how much our common success depends on 
good teamwork, so it should not be a great problem to find a good compromise 
between self-expression and self-sacrifice. By the way, your last digest helps 
to reduce some additional keystrokes for the peers, involved in this small talk 
discussion<em>, that we should better factor out of Helmut</em> 's <em>Homepage
</em>. -- fridemar </p> 
<p> </p>

<dt></dt> 
<dd> Fridemar, sorry for the misunderstanding. Moving between many wiki 
systems I typically think &quot;summary&quot; or &quot;page summary&quot; for 
what you named &quot;digest&quot;. You are of course right that the 
summary/digest should be in sync with the page content and reflect the process. 
My suggestion would be to concentrate on the content and not notify about 
changing layout or links.</dd> </dl> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> With respect to your suggestions towards a kind of &quot;polite-ical 
correctness&quot; or towards new &quot;standards of how to behave and structure 
our communication&quot; I admit that I like to stick to common habits that have 
grown in this and other communities, as long as you are alone promoting them.
</dd> </dl> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> I think it scholarly to teach others how exactly they should chose their 
wordings. I think you slightly hurt yourself by doing so. -- Helmut</dd> </dl> 
<p> Helmut, you are right, we are a community, where each one is learner and 
teacher in one person. The better the balance, the less it hurts. Sorry too for 
any imbalance in our interactions. -- fridemar</p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> I think it's the right thing to note such changes in the digest, but to 
mark them asCopyEdits; that way, one can choose approximately the level of 
detail one wants onRecentChanges. Of course, it's not easy to remember that 
such little things are possible when one frequently contributes to other wikis! 
As such, I would suggest to Fridemar that you digest the summary whenever you 
find another editor has left it stale &mdash; small-scalePeerReview :) --

<p> </p>  Helmut... I can talk most anytime during this month. Is there a date 
and time that would be particularly convenient for you? I am also checking 
email regularly via hwobbe@datafix.com --HansWobbe 
<p> Hans, do you want to skype? What is your timezone? I'm Vienna/Munique 
GMT+1. How far are we off? Your morning might fit into my afternoon:</p> 
<pre> 15-18pm GMT+1 =&gt; ? 6 hours =&gt; 9-12am Eastern Time </pre> -- Helmut 
<p> <strong>Helmut...</strong> </p> 
<p> I sent an email re a skype chat, but got a cryptic error message that 
indicated it might not have been transmitted. I'll send it again if you need 
it. --HansWobbe </p> 
<p> Hans, I got an e-mail and found you on Skype. -- Helmut </p> 
<p> Helmut... Great! I'm hoping that DataFix? techies will open a port in 
their firewalls as early as Wednesday. I'll let you know as soon as they 
finish. -- Hans</p> 
<ul> 
<li> I found your Skype contact info on my home system. I should probably run 
a quick microphone test since I haven't used it in a while. Then, all I'll need 
to do is learn enough about how to use the skype software that I won't embarass 
myself :.)</li> </ul> 
<p> Hans, just as you like. Sometimes, when connection is bad, we go back to 
kind of chatting using the Skype message window. If bandwidth is sufficient, we 
may turn on video. We use Skype really a lot and like it. -- Helmut</p>

<p> </p> JonasDaltonRand: I don't want to start a WikiDrama ? about this, but 
I don't think declaringWallaceCook unwelcome is good. Unwelcome to come here 
and write nonsense like &quot;Da Vinci was a robot EXPERT !&quot;, yes, but he 
may be able to contribute well. I don't know whether he can contribute 
constructively or not, but I would like someone in this community to try to 
give him advise. I can try myself, but I think he got the wrong idea by me 
saying &quot;Write something about communities&quot; and then he wrote StOre?. 
So, how can I guide him around? He's not integrated in here enough (obviously) 
and may not be accustomed to many things here, and this could be his way of 
showing it.
<p> Jonas, maybe you are right, maybe not. I think that Wallace shows a lack 
of social intelligence and it is not the goal of mb to teach people the basics 
of how to get along with each other. If you have the good will and tolerance to 
teach him and take responsibility for him, that's fine with me. Many of us did 
so, I did so, years ago. -- Helmut</p> 
<p> Did what &quot;years ago&quot;, Helmut? Do you know him in real life or 
something? --Jonas</p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> Jonas, years ago, I thought like you, positively, try to include 
everybody in our wikis, talk night long to convince people to go a cooperative 
path. There are famous examples likeErnstGruber, RobertAbitbol and others, 
where I've invested hundreds of hours. Over time I've become a bit realistic. 
Some people don't grok wiki, perhaps they do not grok the world, they probably 
never will and you can see it from their first actions with a 95+% probability. 
--HelmutLeitner </dd> </dl> 
<p> I don't think it's fair to paint everyone who confuses wikis with 
geocities with the brush of Robert and Ernst, who both seem to have more 
serious personal issues than misbehaviour on wikis. --SunirShah </p> 
<p> What did RobertAbitbol and ErnstGruber do that was bad? --Jonas </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> I did not say the Robert or Ernst did something bad. I, and others, where 
just unable to cooperate with them and use this wiki and other wikis together 
without conflicts. -- Helmut</dd> </dl> 
<p> </p> 
<p> It's tough to figure out what's the best thing to do over a wiki. In real 
life, I could read his body language. You almost have to play a statistical 
game. --SunirShah </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> I'm not so sure that reading body language is that easy. -- Helmut </dd> 
</dl> 
<p> It's a language like any other. You can learn how to read it better. I 
hear method acting classes are helpful. The real difficulty is 
FundamentalAttributionError?. -- SunirShah </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> In that sense I agree with you - it is just as easy to read body language 
as written text. But there is also a reading between the lines and lying ... I 
meant it is not so easy to read from body language whether someone will be a 
good friend or fair partner. -- Helmut</dd> </dl>

<p> </p> 
<p> Helmut, thanks for the metaphor! I have two related projects, and I 
thought you might like to assist. The first is straightfoward: I need set up a 
wiki to contain the prince and keep him at a respectful distance from the 
princess.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> I did this myself : http://thething.is/tt.pl </dd> </dl> 
<p> The second project is the first task for the prince: creating a git 
underlayer for wikis. The idea would be to make wiki branching and merging as 
routine as it is in open-source development. The most obvious benefit is that 
it seems to offer a nicer and more graduated alternative to theFishBowl. In 
discussing this idea, a friend pointed out (gitit @ 
johnmacfarlane.net/tools.html ) -- a wiki written in Haskell which uses git 
internally. At first, I'm hoping to implement the idea forUseModWiki and gitit. 
</p> 
<p> I imagine three near-term clients for this effort: Meatball, TeaTime, and 
Tim Gowers' polymath. Interested? --NathanielThurston </p>

<dd> Nathaniel, for the next few months I'm completely immersed in my projects 
as a software freelancer, milestones all arround, I'm sorry. --HelmutLeitner 
</dd> </dl> 
<p> Helmut, I've learned quite a lot about wiki software and communities in 
the past few weeks, and I have a feeling I might have invented a few things in 
process. I'd love a chance to compare notes with you to see if there is any 
truth to this feeling. --NathanielThurston </p>  It's actually very nice to see 
your &quot;footprints&quot; and to know that you still visit (if only every 
other month or so)! --HansWobbe.

<p> </p> 
<p> Helmut, your line of thought -- </p> 
<p> </p> 
<dl> 
<dt></dt> 
<dd> <em>The problem at the bottom of our current &quot;crisis pyramid&quot; 
is the social problem of sharing the available resources that could be only 
solved by some kind of generous solidarity. This solidarity is not visible and 
we understand no processes to grow it. Politics replaces it by economic growth 
and the promise that everyone will be a winner. This promise doesn't work and 
the economic growth leads us into the energy crisis, the climatic crisis, the 
financial crisis. So whatever happens, we are neither able to initiate it nor 
to control it. If the mechanics of theNooSphere were understood, those people 
at the top of the power/property/status pyramid would use it to stay on top and 
secure the better part of the cake. Current US health system confrontations 
show how easy it is to exploit the lack of solidarity to the disadvantage of 
the society as a whole (the great majority of people, especially the poorer).
</em> </dd> </dl> 
<p> -- provoked two points for me. </p> 
<p> First, KatKinkade?'s observations of TwinOaks?. [(Twin Oaks.)] Kat Kinkade 
co-founded Twin Oaks some 30+ years ago. She also helped seed two ofshoot 
communities, if I recall right: East Wind and Acorn. She wrote an excellent 
book on her experiences called &quot;Is it Utopia Yet?&quot; Near the end of 
her life, she left Twin Oaks for several years in frustration, though she 
returned before she died.</p> 
<p> She has several well reasoned criticisms tempered with love and affection 
for the ways of life she helped found.</p> 
<p> A taste of her criticism is written out here: 
http://www.thefec.org/node/897 </p> 
<p> &quot;...But I'm saying, if I were young again and were going to do a 
community again, it would not start with such rigid egalitarianism. And I'll 
tell you why.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;Hilke: Okay.&quot; </p> 
<p> &quot;Kat: Because the aim is to make everybody feel equally served by the 
establishment, and that's impossible. Equal time, equal money, equal whatever. 
But even if we had this godlike abililty to give everyone an equal amount of 
satisfaction in theory, there would be some who would immediately be 
dissatisfied, and they would be dissatisfied because they would look at what 
their neighbor had, and they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t have a 
clarinet.&rdquo; And you could say to them, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got a baby. 
Don&rsquo;t you think that baby is expensive?&rdquo; And they&rsquo;ll say, 
&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t count. The community is supposed to support 
babies.&rdquo; And they&rsquo;ll be angry, and they&rsquo;ll be envious of 
whatever anybody had. As far as I can see, envy seems to be built into the 
human, and I can see evolutionarily why that might be true. But it's not only 
built into the human, but also into the system of equality. And I read this 
about people: the more they strive for equality, the more they watch to see 
what their neighbors have, to see if they've got something that they don't. And 
that trait is so ugly and destructive and hateful that I would rather give up 
equality than have that trait around. I would like to destroy that. I would 
like to have a society in which we expect some people to have more than others. 
... But I wouldn't want anybody to be more than double, have twice as much as 
somebody else. ... And so, because I have changed my mind about this, I no 
longer get excited about, &quot;Oh, this isn't equal!&quot; I think, 
&quot;Yeah, it isn't. It isn't equal, and it's not gonna be.&quot; [sighs]&quot;
</p> 
<p> Another aspect is the role of <em>dreams.</em> Kat Kinkade was regularly 
frustrated because new people would come in full of inspiring ideas and dreams, 
which the community consensus would quickly shut down in favor of the status 
quo.</p> 
<p> This brings the second thing that came to me -- Damanhur. Damanhur is 
fundamentally rooted in<em>solidarity.</em> In the Constitution, as far as I am 
aware, the word &quot;equality&quot; nowhere appears. But solidarity is listed 
as a core principle in the introduction to the constitution, and is listed as a 
core principle in the very first point of the constitution.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <em>The Communities represent the ideal form of union and communal 
living. They are inspired by principles of solidarity and sharing.</em> </li> 
<li> <em>1. The citizens are brothers and sisters who help one another through 
reciprocal trust, respect, clarity, acceptance, solidarity, and continuous 
inner transformation. Everyone is committed to always giving others 
opportunities to aim higher.</em> </li> </ul> 
<p> One of many examples of how this plays into reality, is that the phrase 
&quot;Con Te&quot; (I am with you,) short for a longer phrase (something like: 
&quot;I am with you my brother and sister in spirit,&quot;) is the standard 
greeting. When I visited, I definitely felt the sense of solidarity.</p> 
<p> Further, dreams are fundamental to the fabric of Damanhurian reality, 
consciously cultivated, and the society reshaped to meet their fulfillment.</p> 
<p> Damanhur is not without it's problems: It's a lot of hard work, both 
inwardly and outwardly, and Damanhurians put a high emphasis on<em>continuity
</em> and finishing what you start -- backing out of projects freely chosen is 
strongly discouraged. Part of the reason there's so much solidarity is because 
the entire society is based in perpetual struggle consciously undertaken -- 
comfort is explicitly not an aim of the society. (I observed that much of the 
solidarity at Harvey Mudd College was because we all shared the 2-year long 
core curriculum, that we all struggled with together; A labor of love.) And if 
someone wants to see a given development<em>sooner</em> rather than <em>later,
</em> they can get very frustrated. It's clearly not for everyone, nor does it 
strive to be such. But it is worth noting for the contrast.</p> 
<p> -- LionKimbro </p> 
<p> Lion, maybe I didn't express myself well enough. I do not doubt there is 
and can be solidarity. There are great individuals and there are wonderful 
religious and idealistic movements that typically promote the 
&quot;giving&quot; aspects of existance. But somehow these community models are 
restricted. Either they restrict solidarity to those within (heathen, religious 
wars). Often they pay by a loss of freedom, by being hierarchical or 
autocratic. Or the systems are not general enough to work for all in a 
multi-cultural society, or they are invaded by status-quo traditions, and so on 
... --HelmutLeitner </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> I don't write to disagree, as much to extend &amp; share notes. </p> 
<p> I think the <em>realities</em> more than the <em>models</em> are broken: 
Solidarity is inner agreement, not external agreement. It clearly can't be 
forced, but more deeply - it can't be projected, either: You could become a 
monk, and then become one with everyone; But unless I become one with you as 
you become one with me, this realization is only potential, rather than real. 
Solidarity can be extended to another, but unless it is received and 
reciprocated, it can only be a glimpse of a future possibility. Only when there 
is mutual agreement does it have the possibility of becoming real.</p> 
<p> This is a political reality. There are efforts (such as [Humanities Team]) 
that work to do the political work to develop the political reality. I think 
that the religious/spiritual assertions connected with the Humanities Team 
effort prevent it from succeeding in it's present form, though I think their 
work is still worthwhile (in the spirit of: &quot;Keep your eye on the 
prize.&quot;) Many people are opposed to anything that sounds like &quot;New 
World Order,&quot; often<em>specifically</em> on religious grounds, but that 
would be poor reason to stop making the effort that may take centuries, 
millenia, or longer to complete.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2> 
<h4>JuanmaMP -- Wed Aug 26 18:13:38 2009</h4> 
<p> Helmut, I noticed that Spanish interface doesn't figure in properties of 
Prowiki in wikimatrix. Maybe, does it deserve update?. There's two features 
that catches my attention for the time being: unlimited page revisions (btw) 
and categories, so I'm going to try to study it (learning through comparing).
</p> 
<p> What do you think about DoubleClick? that not implemented? </p> 
<p> Thanks. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h4>HelmutLeitner -- Thu Aug 27 06:40:08 2009</h4> 
<p> Juanma, I've just added Spanish at WikiMatrix, thank you for pointing me 
to this. You mean DoubleClick? editing? AFAIK this needs Javascript and I've 
always tried to avoid that. But it would be probably trivial to add this, maybe 
even without changing the code, just by adding some Javascript to the page 
template.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h4>JuanmaMP -- Sun Aug 30 11:22:15 2009</h4> 
<p> Yes, Helmut; I meant DoubleClick? editing. I avoid Javascript, a little 
too for the being time. You're right the snippet is a short fragment.</p> 
<p> Sorry for the delay of my answer here, but I am collecting some javascript 
snippets fromUseMod descendants that I could apply in a wiki and then, I'll 
share them. (It will take a while)</p>
