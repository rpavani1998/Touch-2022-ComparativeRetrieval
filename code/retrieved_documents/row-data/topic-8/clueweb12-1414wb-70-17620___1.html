 Python 
List, Python Tuple, Python Dictionary <br>
If a Python list were like a pencil, 
then a Python Tuple would be like a pen.<br>
<br>
Most programming languages 
include structures in which you can hold a collection of values. The most 
frequent example you'll come across is called an &quot;array&quot; - but 
exactly what that does varies from language to language as a C array is very 
different to a Tcl array, for example.<br>
<br>
Python has FOUR (or five?) 
object types built into the language that can be regarded as collections.<br>

<br>  LISTS AND TUPLES <br>
<br>
Both LISTS and TUPLES consist of a number of 
objects which can be referenced by their position number within the 284c 
object. I can create a list by writing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;salad 
= [&quot;Lettuce&quot;,&quot;Tomato&quot;,&quot;Onion&quot;,&quot;Tuna&quot;]
<br>and then refer to salad[0] to refer to lettuce and salad[2] to refer to 
Onion. I can create a tuple by writing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit 
= 
(&quot;Apple&quot;,&quot;Banana&quot;,&quot;Cherry&quot;,&quot;Fig&quot;,&quot;Grapefruit&quot;)
<br>and then refer to fruit[0] to refer to Apple, and so on. You'll notice that 
when I created the list I used [...] notation, and when I created the tuple I 
used (....) notation, but when I refer to elements later I do so using square 
brackets every time.<br>
<br>
So what's the difference? With a list, I can 
change the elements, add extra elements, and so on, after it has been created. 
It's perfectly acceptable for me to write<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;salad[3] = &quot;Cheese&quot;<br>
for example if 
I want to replace the tuna. But if I write<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit[3] = &quot;Orange&quot;<br>
I will get an 
error message when the program runs. You can change a list but NOT a tuple! In 
technical jargon, a tuple is immutable by a list is mutable.<br>
<br>

You're 
probably wondering why the two structures are provided - are they both 
necessary? A Tuple is much more efficient in use, and there are many occasions 
you want to set up a collection of objects in order (an &quot;ordered 
collection&quot;) and refer to it many times later on. These days, though, with 
all the extra power of computers since Guido wrote Python, perhaps we could do 
without the tuple.<br>
<br>
 DICTIONARIES <br>
<br>
If you don't want to refer 
to the elements of a collection by their position number but prefer some other 
type of object as a key, you can use a python dictionary. Let's see an example 
of one of those:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;starter = 
{&quot;John&quot;:&quot;soup&quot;, &quot;James&quot;:&quot;pate&quot;, 
&quot;Joan&quot;:&quot;soup&quot;}<br>
There are three elements in that 
dictionary, and I can refer to starter[&quot;James&quot;] and get the string 
&quot;pate&quot;. You'll notice that I set up a dictionary with { ... } (curly 
braces, but yet again I refer to it using square brackets. If you want to 
perform an operation on element of a dictionary, you can find out the keys 
using the keys method<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print starter.keys() <br>
for 
example since you can't know what the elements are called just be looking at a 
count of the number of elements as you can with a list or tuple.<br>
<br>
If 
you're familiar with Perl hashes, PHP associative arrays or Tcl arrays, then 
you have a good parallel to a python dictionary.<br>
<br>

example usinga dictionary <br>
 STRINGS <br>
<br>
Strings can be treated as 
immutable ordered collection objects. In other words, I can write<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something = &quot;Marmalade&quot;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third = something[2]<br>
and have the letter 
&quot;r&quot; assigned to the variable third. This is a very useful facility in 
certain applications - for example if you're using Python in a bioinformatics 
application and you're doing sequence analysis.<br>
<br>

example usinga string as a tuple <br>
 ITERATORS <br>
<br>
An iterator is an 
object that generates a collection. If you set up a large collection (for 
example a list that contains all ten thousand lines from a data file), you're 
occupying computer memory ... and if the only thing you then do with it is 
process each element once, it's not efficient. Increase the number of lines in 
the file by a factor of 10 or 100 and you're likely to find that you're 
starting to create &quot;issues&quot; on the host computer. Iterators overcome 
this problem. For example<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for line in 
huge.readlines():<br>
will set up a temporary list containing all the data in 
the stream opened in object huge, then put each element into the variable line 
one by one. In contrast, if you write<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for line in 
huge.xreadlines():<br>
then you're using an iterator and lines from the file 
are only read in as required.<br>
<br>
If you want to write your own generator 
function, you can do so; to return an intermediate value, use the keyword yield 
rather than the keyword return.<br>

Thanks for your comment, &quot;Anon&quot;. This article is an overview 
comparison and not a definitive specification of lists, tuples and 
dictionaries. I never claimed it to be complete reference material ... so it's 
natural that it's incomplete. My suggested link includes an alternative
