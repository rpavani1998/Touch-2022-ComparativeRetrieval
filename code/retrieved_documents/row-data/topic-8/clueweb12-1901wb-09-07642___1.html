<h1>Python and Django, Ruby on Rails, and PHP</h1>  February 22, 2006 | 10:42 
p.m. CST <br>

<p>I've been a PHP / MySQL developer for almost a decade now and I like it a 
lot. I think I could probably do just about anything you can imagine or have 
seen on the web in PHP / Mysql. I haven't been looking for a change, but part 
of being good at anything in life means keeping an open mind and thinking 
critically. In trying to keep an open mind, I read and keep up with the latest 
news in web development. Unless you've been living in a cave you've probably 
heard at least something aboutRuby on Rails. Ruby on Rails has been making a 
ton of news lately in the web development community. And in case you don't 
know, Ruby on Rails is a programmingframework for the programming language Ruby.
</p> 
<p>Also another programming framework that is making some buzz in the 
community isDjango. Django is a programming framework for Python that I first 
heard about when I read the news onSimon Willison's blog that Django was going 
to be released as an open source framework.</p> 
<p>So trying to be the open minded critical thinker that I am, I thought I 
would give both of them a try. I tried Ruby on Rails first by working through a 
tutorial they had which walked you through making a simple to-do application. I 
admit that I'm no guru after working through one tutorial but I do have some 
initial impressions which might be of interest to people thinking about Rails 
or Django.</p> 
<p>First of all the installation process was a little tricky since in order to 
get Rails to work with Apache 2 you have to installFastCGI. After the install 
the tutorial was pretty straight forward and Rails did a lot of the tedious 
reparative tasks for you, which I liked. However, after finishing the tutorial 
I felt like the overall application was sluggish. I'm sure a lot of this has to 
do with the fact that Rails uses FastCGI instead of a module for Apache like 
mod_python and php4_module. I've heard but haven't experienced it first hand 
that Rails is a lot faster when you useLightHttpd instead of Apache 2. But for 
me that wasn't an option because I already had a lot of applications on my 
server that were dependent on Apache and I didn't want to run another web 
daemon on a different port on the same server.</p> <br>

<p>Just recently I've been trying Django. I just finished part one through 
part four of &quot;Writing your first Django app&quot;. I have to say that so 
far I'm really impressed with Django. It seems a lot more logical and seems to 
mesh more with myprogramming philosophy. The programming workflow and Django's 
stack just seem to make more sense. Not only does Django seem to make more 
sense, it's a lot faster than Rails when used with Apache 2. I don't have any 
benchmarks to prove it but you can just tell by the feel that Django's tutorial 
poll application is faster than Rails's tutorial to-do application.</p> 
<p>Another main difference between Django and Rails is that Django uses Python 
and Rails usesRuby. So what does that mean? Well if you like Ruby you're going 
to want to use Rails and if you like Python you're probably going to want to 
use Django. But what if you don't know either Python or Ruby, what then? You'll 
need to do some research or just take my word for it that Python is better! 
Python is stricter in the way that it does things, like being whitespace 
sensitive for example. Being whitespace sensitive means that it delimits blocks 
of code by line breaks, other programs like Java, C++ and PHP use curly braces 
to delimit code blocks. In the online bookDive Into Python, Mark Pilgrim puts 
it this way, &quot;After some initial protests and several snide analogies to 
Fortran, you will make peace with this and start seeing its benefits. One major 
benefit is that all Python programs look similar, since indentation is a 
language requirement and not a matter of style. This makes it easier to read 
and understand other people's Python code.&quot;</p> 
<p>One of the other features and main differences between Rails and Django is 
that Django has an &quot;Automatic admin interface&quot; which you can either 
take it or leave it. But if you want the automatic admin interface it's there 
to use, and guess what? It's not crap! It's actually pretty detailed and even 
styled. Having an automatic admin interface can cut down on building web 
applications like content management systems and blog applications. And what I 
found really cool about the admin interface that comes with Django is that it 
doesn't look like something your PhD math professor designed. It's actually has 
a nice detailed clean graphically designed interface.</p> 
<p>If you can't already tell my preference is defiantly swaying toward Django. 
The final catalyst that made the pendulum sway towards Django was listening to 
a three hourSnakes and Rubies presentation where Adrian Holovaty (one of the 
creators of Django) andDavid Heinemeier Hansson (the creator of Rails) both 
present their frameworks and then answer questions from the audience. In my 
opinion Adrian's presentation was far superior to David's it wasn't even funny. 
Adrian's presentation was very logical in that he explained the Django stack so 
that you could follow Django's workflow for creating applications. David's 
presentation on the other hand seemed to be in no particular order and very 
unorganized. Not to mention that David's over all demeanor was very cocky and 
arrogant which was a major turn off. After hearing both presentations and the 
questions that followed it felt very clear to me that Django is definitely the 
framework for me. Its overall philosophy goes with mine, it uses Python which I 
like more than Ruby and Django's workflow and stack seem a lot more simple and 
logical than Rails.</p> 
<p>Currently I'm now planning to finish reading Dive Into Python and the 
Django documentation and then move on to rewriting this blog using Django which 
is currently using PHP and my own PHP framework that I wrote.</p> 
<p>If you're bored with PHP and need a change, give Django a try! What's the 
worst that can happen, you broaden your knowledge base and become a better PHP 
programmer (or whatever you use) because of it?</p>

<p>Brent, I haven't looked into Django much mainly because I attached myself 
to Ruby. Ruby feels like I am speaking English instead of programming, which I 
find very attractive. I have chosen Ruby and Rails, but that is not to say that 
I am not going to also look into Python and Django. I'm addicted to indention 
so in that respect, Python is intriguing.</p> </dd>

<p>I too have been programming PHP for many years. The more I experiment with 
other languages, the more I dislike PHP. I've tried both Python/Django and Ruby 
on Rails (and Python/TurboGears) and like Python/Django the best. I especially 
like the way the URLs work.</p> 
<p>However, the buzz around RoR is so big, I sometimes feel I'll be left 
behind if I don't jump on the RoR bandwagon. I'll be honest, the Ruby syntax is 
different enough from other languages that it puts me off a bit. I'm going to 
give it a few more tries, maybe it will grow on me.</p> </dd>

<p>I personally don't have a list of what has been accomplished. I do know on 
the Django side thatpownce.com uses Django for it's server side solution. I 
think both Django and ROR have big websites that use their frameworks.</p> 
<p>I've personally been working on converting all of ciy.com's websites over 
to using Django. I really like it so far. It's hard getting used to the Django 
way of doing things, but you are going to have that probablem anytime you move 
to a new language or framework.</p> 
<p>I created a small irc channel for web geeks in my area called 
#joplin-web-geeks onfreenode.net. It has 2 people on it that are Django users. 
I also know that #django onfreenode.net is very active.</p> </dd>

<p>I had built a framework in php over the past five years, that powers lots

not only decided to learn Django, but also to stop any other development on my

<p>I have been evaluating RoR and Django recently (as well as Pinax/Django) 
and its been very difficult deciding between the two. They are both excellent 
frameworks.<br>
</p> 
<p>I have no exposure to Ruby other than experimenting with RoR, while I have 
written a few apps with Python and also the python-based Scrapy framework. So I 
have been leaning strongly to Django.</p> 
<p>I had also heard rumours of DHH being a YAP (Young Arrogant Programmer) and 
finally decided to watch the Snakes and Rubies video.</p> 
<p>I'll be honest, I did not find DHH cocky or arrogant. He came across as 
very opinionated and having strong beliefs. However, his opinions and beliefs 
seemed to clearly line up with the vision and principles he was espousing. Some 
of these opinions are not politically correct, but advance the end goal. In the 
context of web application development, I do agree with most of the decisions 
RoR makes. In fact, I find it refreshing that they had the balls to make some 
of these decisions. ie. AJAX support (screw the 7%), allowing code in the 
template, etc...<br>
</p> 
<p>Its as if all the mundane (who cares type) decisions and the obvious good 
for the 90% use case decisions have been made. Good riddance. If I didn't have 
a framework to being with, I'd have wasted my time basically making the same 
decisions and having to implement them all.<br>
</p> 
<p>After watching the video, I committed myself to doing a full app in RoR and 
so far... the experience is pleasantly surprising me at many turns.</p>

<p>Hey Drazen, This article was written over three years ago, so things have 
changed since this article was written for me, in that I have probably about a 
years worth of experience using Django full-time at my full-time job. Have a 
look athttp://www.ciy.com/, which is the parent organization for about eight 
different websites and organizations. The MOVE website is one of my favorite 
that I developed (http://www.ciy.com/move/).&gt; </p> 
<p>The two factors that made me choose Django over Rails are that Django has a 
very powerful and mature admin website built into the framework that you can 
use if you want. It saves a ton of time and is very customizable and was way 
better than anything Rails had when I was doing comparisons, so things might 
have changed since then.</p> 
<p>The other major factor that made me choose Django, was for Python. Python's 
syntax and way of doing things is so much cleaner and elegant in my opinion 
that ruby. I honestly get a headache when looking at ruby code. So ultimately 
it wouldn't have made good sense to choose something that gave me a headache 
and required extra time because it came without an admin website built in.</p> 
<p>And after working with Django for over a year, I am very happy with it and 
have started using Django's design patterns in my PHP framework that I have 
keep up over the years. Django is a little hard to get used to at first and I 
needed help from friends at times but ultimately I'm glad I made the investment.

<p>In DjangoBook it says its outside of its scope, indeed everywhere talks

<p>You basically just need python and whatever database you're using installed 
locally for development. Just run the included django dev server. I use Git to 
keep revisions of my code and when I'm ready to deploy I commit the changes to 
my remote repository and then I update the code that the live site is hosted on 
from the master repository. I run all my stuff on aLinode.com VM and so I have 
complete control on what is installed. I install, Apache, MySQL and mod_wsgi.
</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Put them wherever you want. I put mine in /home/code/www.example.com/.</p>

<li> 
<p>Django works well with MySQL, but most Django coders will tell you that 
they prefer PostgreSQL.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>You can use the built-in admin site however you like. Django developers are 
always thinking about security and as far as I know it's very secure.</p> </li>
