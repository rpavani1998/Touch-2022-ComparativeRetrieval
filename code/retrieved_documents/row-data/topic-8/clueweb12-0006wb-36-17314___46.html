<h1>Leading items and editorials</h1> <br>
<b>And so the year comes to the 
close</b>. And what a year! 2000 stands out for highs and lows for Linux and 
Free Software. This is the time of year when we take a step back and try to get 
an overall perspective, as well as some guesses as to what lies ahead. For 
those of you interested in previous such efforts, feel free to check out the 
end-of-year coverage from1999 and 1998 as well. 
<p> Also along the same lines, if you haven't yet checked out the year 2000 
LWN Timeline, now is your chance. Note that this is a work in progress; 
comments and feedback from our readers is essential in order to complete the 
timeline. Reader contributions are kept in a log, so credit will be given where 
due. A final version of the Timeline will be released in early January.</p>
<p> <b>What were the major trends</b> for Linux and Open Source/Free Software 
in 2000? Using a broad rule of thumb, we searched for repeating themes that 
came up virtually every month and found five of them:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Commercial companies releasing software as Open Source/Free Software</b>
. Examples can be found each and every month. Some of the most notable include 
Sun's release of Star Office under the GPL, IBM's release of AFS, SashXB and 
and the Jikes Java compiler, TRG's release of the NWFS 2.2 NetWare file system, 
Inprise's release of the InterBase database, and SGI's release of OpenGL, along 
with C, C+ and Fortran compilers for the IA-64 architecture, to provide only a 
few examples.
<p> A corollary of this plan was the tendency of Open Source development 
projects to become tightly tied to a single commercial entity. Following older 
examples, such as the tie between sendmail and Sendmail, Inc., Zope and Digital 
Creations, this year PostgreSQL gained Great Bridges as a sponsor. The Python 
team moved en masse, first to BeOpen, and later to Digital Creations. Perhaps 
most strikingly, the release of MySQL under the GPL license (its former license 
was not completely Free) was pushed primarily by commercial considerations. 
Companies were lining up to become strategic partners to the MySQL development, 
but wanted to see the GPL used to protect their interests.</p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>Increased international presence</b>. Not only is business booming 
overseas, which is easily visible both commercially and in the vibrancy of 
international contributions to development projects, but governments outside of 
the US have been notably interested in, and voicing support for, the Open 
Source content. Some striking examples include the Chinese government's 
interest in and support of Linux (January 2000), the integration of Open Source 
into plans to improve the European software industry (February 2000), a 
proposed French law requiring open standards and the availability of source 
code for software used by the government (April 2000), and the strong stance in 
support of Open Source by Siegmar Mosdorf, German Secretary of State in the 
Federal Ministry for Economy and Technology (July 2000).
<p> Of course, to provide a counter-example of the potential dangers when 
governments get involved, Poland taxed a commercial company for its use of Open 
Source software, contending that it must be accounted for as a donation. That 
is one trend that we hope not to see repeated!</p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>Patents</b>. We've hammered on this issue so much this year that we'll 
tread lightly for now. However, the RTLinux patent, the Amazon patent on its 
affiliate program, Microsoft's successful enforcement of its patent on the 
Active Stream file format against theVirtualDub (GPL'd) project and the latest, 
British Telecom's suit against Prodigy for violation of, essentially, a patent 
on the concept of a &quot;link&quot;, stand out as infamous examples.
<p> On the up-side, the European Patent Convention voted in November against 
legitimizing software patents, at least for now.</p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>Mergers and Acquisitions</b>. Never a month went by without the 
announcement of new mergers and acquisitions. Lineo took the lead with multiple 
acquisitions, including Zentropix, Use Inc., Moreton Bay, INUP, Fireplug and 
RT-Control. Other notable mergers/acquisition include VA Linux and Andover.net 
(completed in 2000), Walnut Creek and BSDi, and LinuxMall.com's trips to the 
altar, first with Frank Kaspar and Associates and later EBIZ. Red Hat also went 
on a buying spree, picking up Hell's Kitchens, BlueCurve, C2Net and, most 
notably, Cygnus (whereby they acquired their current CTO, Michael Tiemann). Of 
course, a couple of other hard-to-forget joinings: first, SCO and Caldera and 
second, Sun and Cobalt. Not a comprehensive list, by any means.
<p> That's just the commercial world, of course. Mergers happen outside the 
business world as well, such as the merger of the Linux Standard Base (LSB) and 
Linux Internationalization Initiative (LI18NUX) (May 2000), which resulted in 
the formation of a new entity, theFree Standards Group. </p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>Planned or filed IPOs that didn't happen</b>. If you look back at our 
predictions for the year 2000, this is one area where our attempts (and most 
everyone else's) at predicting the future failed. At the beginning of 2000, we 
looked forward to a boatload of Linux-related IPOs. Instead, only a few 
successful IPOs actually happened over the past year (Caldera, Lineo). The 
trend we found was actually more a story of planned or announced IPOs that 
never happened. Linuxcare's IPO was announced, then cancelled. LinuxFund 
announced an IPO, but never filed. Rackspace.com actually filed its IPO, but 
has been quiet ever since. An imaginary visit to the board rooms of many 
private companies would find many more IPO plans now littering the wastebaskets.
<p> Corresponding to the failed IPOs was the first layoffs in Linux-related 
companies. In May, 2000, we saw both 35% of Linuxcare's staff laid off and, in 
addition, almost the entire staff ofWide Open News, Red Hat's attempt at a 
Linux news service. Wide Open still exists, of course, but no longer produces 
original content.</p></li> </ul> Well, aside from those constant trends, <b>
there were a few successes that stood out above the rest</b>. For our choice, 
we would look at<b>the relaxation of US Cryptography rules</b> as one of those 
successes. This was a critical need; the security-hardening of Linux has 
blossomed as a result, though of course, still more work remains to be done.
<p> Note that the change mentioned above is political in nature and could be 
just as easily reversed. On the legal front, a good step forward was made in 
April, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit published 
its decision regarding Peter Junger's challenge to the Export Administration 
Regulations which prevented him from posting information on the Internet that 
contained cryptographic example code. Most critical in the ruling: 
&quot;Because computer source code is an expressive means for the exchange of 
information and ideas about computer programming, we hold that it is protected 
by the First Amendment.&quot; If this verdict holds, it should provide a more 
solid ground for the safety of cryptographic development in the US, as well as 
a wonderful precedent for future software- and freedom-related lawsuits.</p>
<p> <b>VA Linux's Sourceforge must stand out as another notable success</b>. 
Announced in January, Sourceforge has grown to host over 12,000 software 
development projects, all of them Free/Open Source. That is estimated to be 
over 75% of the &quot;free software universe&quot;. Although we wish them the 
best, we'll reiterate our stance in favor of competition and hope to see a 
staunch Free Software advocate or two come out with a comparable system in the 
coming year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <b>Some major development milestones</b> we'd like to celebrate: XFree86 
4.0, KDE 2.0, Perl 5.6.0, PHP 4.0, PostgreSQL 7.0, Gnucash 1.4, Python 1.6 and 
2.0, and Netscape 6 (the first based on Mozilla). Some exciting products not 
yet to a stable release included Helix Code'sEvolution and Eazel's Nautilus, 
both exciting projects for the future of the desktop. Don't shoot us for 
leaving out the other 99% -- this edition would never have made it out the door.
</p>
<p> <b>Now for the hard part</b>. What will the next year bring? Well, we'll 
refrain from any attempt to predict the overall economic health of the US or 
any other country in the world. Nonetheless, we will predict that Free Software 
and the value of the concepts behind it will weather both good news and bad. In 
the midst of a massive loss of value for Linux stocks on the NASDAQ exchange, 
IBM announced plans to pour a billion US dollars into Linux next year and more 
billions of dollars over the years to come. Dell has announced major 
commitments to the Linux platform. All of the major software companies out 
there are focused on Linux and Free Software, no longer as a get-rich trick, 
but as an essential part of their business plan.</p>
<p> Do heavy investments from the big companies presage the end or failure of 
small Linux-based companies? Highly unlikely. Just as the success of Microsoft 
spawned many small companies looking to make money off of integration, add-ons, 
support, etc., the heavy use of Linux and Open Source at IBM, HP, Compaq, Dell 
and, dare we say, Sun, will produce a fertile field for small companies. That 
arena will be particularly fertile<em>because</em> Open Source protects the 
rights and opportunities of all comers, providing natural obstacles to 
monopolies. Correspondingly though, the likelihood of one of those small 
companies growing large enough to push the entrenched beasts out of the field 
is much less likely.</p>
<p> <b>What else, then, will next year bring?</b> Continued progress on the 
desktop. We're not ready to plan for a victory celebration in 2001, though. A 
lot of work remains to be done to provide all the tools that desktop customers 
need and want, particularly tools that meet our standards: full-featured, 
high-performance<b>and</b> robust. We must not only match our competitors but 
exceed them.</p>
<p> Continued growth within corporate business plans. When times are tight and 
people are examining the bottom line carefully, the long-term advantage of 
using Free Software will shine. More and more companies will also see the legal 
advantage of Open Source. It will help protect them from lawsuits based on the 
number of copies of a piece of software they may be using. It will protect them 
from increasing software costs. It will provide a safe environment for 
collaboration and cooperation between companies, for strategic partnerships and 
more. We'll take another step down the road towards becoming a ubiquitous part 
of &quot;how things are done&quot;.</p>
<p> <b>More mergers and acquisitions</b>. The reality is that many companies 
are not yet making a profit. The new business climate demands that they do so, 
or at least clearly chart how quickly they are going to get there. Companies 
that cannot do one or the other will be looking either at failure or a sale. 
Given those options, sales will be much more popular. Of course, the prices 
we'll be seeing won't match the types of sales and acquisitions we saw during 
the IPO boom; bargain-basement prices are much more likely, particularly for 
companies that are not yet in the black.</p>
<p> <b>A lot of fun</b>. It hasn't stopped being fun yet. That's an important 
part of this community. So this isn't a prediction so much as a wish; let the 
fun continue forever (even if we can't predict its form!).</p>

<h1>Security</h1> <br>

<h2>News and Editorials</h2> 
<p><b>So what was different in 2000?</b>. The end of the year has come, and 
with it, an opportunity to look back on the year from a security perspective. 
After examining many potential topics and discarding them, the question was 
asked, what has changed the most since 1999? From the perspective of writing 
this column, the sheer volume of information that is being reported stands out 
as the largest change. It is amazing to look back on some of the LWN Security 
Summaries from 1999 and find some that display in a single page view or contain 
no more than six paragraphs of information.</p>
<p> It seemed worthwhile to see if we couldn't produce some rough numbers to 
illustrate this change. To do so, we looked at two pieces of information: the 
number of open source software vulnerability reports covered and the size of 
the LWN Security Summary.</p>
<p> Starting with the first item, we quickly scanned through old issues and 
estimated the number of new vulnerabilities we reported each month for both 
1999 and 2000. Lacking a proper database, we make no claims for absolute 
accuracy. We excluded vulnerabilities in commercial software and web scripts, 
since our coverage of those issues was not consistent between 1999 and 2000. 
Given those parameters, we found that the average number of vulnerabilities 
reported per month in 1999 was 13.67, while the equivalent number in 2000 was 
26.41, almost exactly double.</p>
<p> For the second item, we found the average size of a security summary in 
1999 to be around 6.2KB, while in 2000, the average was 16.1KB, an even larger 
growth. Of course, although sizes are easy to calculate accurately, they are 
less reliable as an indication of increased activity; maybe we are just getting 
more loquacious.</p>
<p> Nonetheless, our rough numbers strongly back up the assertion that 
security activity has more than doubled over the past year. Why? Well, like 
most statistics, you can use them to bolster just about any theory you might 
have, but our personal guess is that the increase is a simple demonstration of 
the result of more eyes on the code. Linux and free software is gaining in 
popularity, more and more people are using and scrutinizing the software, 
therefore more problems are being found and reported.</p>
<p> However, it does give us a kind of scary feeling about 2001 ... </p> 
<p><b>NSA security-enhanced Linux available</b>. The U.S. National Security 
Agency has madeits security-enhanced version of Linux available for download. 
The site describes what has been done, though in fairly abstract terms. It's 
available under the GPL, of course. (See also:Ted Ts'o's comments on Slashdot 
on this release).</p>
<p> Stephen Smalley also posted an excellent short summary of the features of 
the Flask architecture, used by Security-Enhanced Linux, and a comparison with
RSBAC (Rule Set Based Access Control) for Linux, another Open Source security 
extension. &quot;<em>RSBAC appears to have similar goals to the 
Security-Enhanced Linux. Like the Security-Enhanced Linux, it separates policy 
from enforcement and supports a variety of security policies. RSBAC uses a 
different architecture (the Generalized Framework for Access Control or GFAC) 
than the Security-Enhanced Linux, although the Flask paper notes that at the 
highest level of abstraction, the the Flask architecture is consistent with the 
GFAC. However, the GFAC does not seem to fully address the issue of policy 
changes and revocation, as discussed in the Flask paper.</em>&quot; </p> 
<p><b>Vendor security information update</b>. Spurred by this excellent post 
by Matt Power (Bindview) to BugTraq this past week, the security links listed 
in our right-hand column have had a major overhaul. BSD information has been 
added, now that our BSD coverage is officially included, and a new section with 
pointers to web pages that contain subscription information for security and 
security announcement lists for various distributions is now available as well.
</p> 
<p><b>The security of RSA's SecurID token emulator is challenged</b>. SecurID 
from RSA is a proprietary two-factor Authentication process, utilizing a 
combination of a password and a security card, on which RSA has based products 
for remote access and e-business.A SecurID module is available for Apache, for 
example.</p>
<p> This week, I.C. Wiener published a SecurID token emulator, prompting a 
discussion on BugTraq of the implications. Adam Shostack commented that such 
code has been in the wild since 1996 and that its current publication will have 
the value of allowing a real test of the assertion that the numbers on the 
SecurID card do not reveal sufficient information to determine the card's 
secret.</p> 
<p><b>Group crafts rating system for server security (CNet)</b>. A new, 
71-member organization, theCenter for Internet Security, plans to build 
benchmarks and rating methodologies in order to provide &quot;<em>a 
&quot;security ruler&quot; defining a minimum level of security and then 
incrementally greater levels of security from which an organization can choose 
the desired level of security for its systems</em>&quot;. Their plans are 
covered inthis CNet article. Note that the benchmarks are to be released to the 
public domain.</p>
<p> It will be interesting to see how this venture does. The center itself is 
not-for-profit, so we presumably shouldn't see expensive fees for getting 
products or systems &quot;rated&quot; by the center. On the other hand, members 
of the center will be the ones reviewing and approving new benchmarks and 
ratings as they come out, so it may well be difficult to both move forward in a 
timely manner and prevent bias toward member products.</p> 
<h2>Security Reports</h2> 
<p><b>dialog lockfile symlink vulnerability</b>. Matt Kraai reported a symlink 
problem with the manner in which dialog handles lockfiles. The Debian advisory 
below is the first and only reference to the problem we have found so far.</p>
<p> This week's updates: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Debian </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>More stunnel vulnerabilities</b>. More stunnel vulnerabilities have been 
reported, in addition to the ones discussedlast week. One such vulnerability 
involves the logging of the stunnel process id to a non-existent directory. 
More stunnel updates are being released to address these additional problems.
</p>
<p> One additional stunnel vulnerability that apparently does not impact Linux 
or BSD systems is the reportedweak encyrption vulnerability. </p>
<p> This week's updates: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Red Hat </li> 
<li>Debian </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>halflifeserver</b>.  Multiple buffer overflows and format string 
vulnerabilities have been reported in the halflifeserver. This week's updates:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>FreeBSD </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Kerberized telnetd</b>. Telnetd's allowance of arbitrary environment 
variables and a buffer overflow in the kerberos v4 library combined to allow a 
local root exploit on NetBSD. Note that this problem has not been confirmed on 
other BSD or Linux systems.</p>
<p> This week's updates: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>NetBSD </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>cgi-bin scripts</b>. The following cgi-bin scripts were reported to 
contain vulnerabilities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Technote's print.cgi script was reported to contain a file disclosure 
vulnerability.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>bsguest.cg and bslist.cgi from Brian Stanbeck were reported to contain 
security problems related to the failure to properly filter input data. Both 
scripts can be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Note 
that Brian appears to have released updated versions of these scripts (and a 
couple of others) on December 23rd, with a note that some security problems had 
been fixed.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Commercial products</b>. The following commercial products were reported 
to contain vulnerabilities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>BEA WebLogic Server fails to properly check input data, allowing the 
string &quot;..&quot; (double dot) to be entered. This can be exploited either 
to execute arbitrary commands or to crash the server. WebLogic Server 5.1 SP 7 
contains a fix for this problem. Check BugTraq ID2138 for more details. 
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Oracle WebDb engine, part of the Oracle Internet Application Server, is 
reported to contain two vulnerabilities, one allowing an attacker to inject 
PL/SQL queries and the other allowing unauthorized proxy reconfiguration 
attempts. Here isOracle's response, including workarounds and a promise that 
release 3.0.8 of Portal will address the problems.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Two additional problems in Oracle 8.1.7 were reported this past week by 
Juan Manuel Pascual Escriba, includinga local root exploit and a file overwrite 
exploit. 
<p> </p></li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Updates</h2> 
<p><b>GnuPG web of trust circumvention</b>. A couple of new GnuPG security 
problems were covered inlast week's LWN Security Summary. A security patch 
against gnupg-1.0.4 was also issued.</p>
<p> Note that the discussion last week mentioned two vulnerabilities but only 
discussed one of them, a problem with trust circumvention. Also fixed with the 
security patch was a problem withdetached signatures, which could cause 
false-positive verfications.</p>
<p> This week's updates: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Linux-Mandrake </li> 
<li>Debian </li> </ul> Previous updates: 
<ul> 
<li>Red Hat (December 21st) </li> 
<li>Trustix (December 21st) </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>ProFTPD memory leak</b>. Last week, we mentioned a potential memory lead 
in ProFTPD. After further discussion on the list, theofficial position is that 
the bug is not reproduceable.</p> 
<p><b>BSD ftpd single byte buffer overflow</b>. A one-byte buffer overflow was 
reportedlast week in the ftpd server provided with BSD. </p>
<p> This week's updates: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>NetBSD </li> </ul> Previous updates: 
<ul> 
<li>Trustix, not vulnerable, but new BSD ftpd packages provided anyway 
(December 21st)</li>

<li>Trustix, BSD ftpd packages updated due to a typo in the original patch 
(December 21st)</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>DNS-based IRC server denial-of-service vulnerabilities</b>. Check the 
December 14th LWN Security Summary for the original report of denial-of-service 
vulnerabilities and more in multiple IRC clients, including BitchX 1.0c17-2 and 
earlier.</p>

<h1>Kernel development</h1> <br>
<b>The current development kernel release is 
still 2.4.0-test12</b>. The -test13 series saw one new prepatch this week, 
test13-pre4, which includes the LVM update, the netfilter fix and more Makefile 
cleanups.
<p> For those of you following Alan's patches to the prepatch system, his 
latest patch is2.4.0test13pre4ac2. He's currently working on merging the 2.2.18 
fixes into the 2.4.0 tree.</p>
<p> <b>The current stable kernel release is still 2.2.18</b>. One new prepatch 
for 2.2.19 has been released this week,2.2.19pre3. A run_task_queue fix, 
resolving a lockup problem some people have been seeing, should be welcome.</p>
<p> <b>Other, minor discussions</b>. This was a relatively light week for the 
linux-kernel mailing list, with about half of the normal volume of posts. Here 
are a couple of discussion items that came up this week:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>In spite of Linus' comment</b>, &quot;<em>if you think you can skip 
christmas with a 4-year-old in the house, think AGAIN</em>&quot;, a bug report 
from Marco d'Itri regarding an innd mmap bug, plus work by Marco, Linus and 
others on Christmas Eve and Christmas day resulting in the finding of aslight 
faux-pas. It seems the only routines in the current 2.4 tree that actually 
write out dirty buffers are ones called under heavy memory pressure. Under 
certain conditions, a machine under no such pressure could be cleanly shut 
down, yet fail to update modified files. Expect to see a fix for this coming 
out soon, now that Christmas is officially over.
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>Linus encourages the use of gcc 2.96 and gcc 2.97 for testing purposes
</b>. It seems that Linus' complaints about the inclusion of a relatively 
untested version of gcc with Red Hat 7 have caused many people to assume that 
the use of such compilers was globally &quot;verboten&quot;. Linuspointed out 
that problems with the compiler, or with the kernel as demonstrated by the new 
compiler, can't be found if no one uses it. &quot;<em>Now, now, I'd love to see 
reports of expecially the new updated compiler. ... I just want people to 
mention the fact, so that I can correlate any bug-reports with a compiler 
version. Just in case. It can be important (and not just because of compiler 
bugs, but due to real kernel bugs that just were hidden by pure luck with other 
compilers)</em>&quot;. 
<p> So go dig up the new compilers, folks. If they can help turn up kernel 
bugs, then best use them before the first stable version of 2.4 is announced.
</p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>Wait queues and wake-ups in 2.2.19pre2</b> were the topic of another 
discussion thread. Hinging upon the discussion was whether or not the 2.4 wait 
queue API would be back-ported, or whether the 2.2 series would continue to be 
unique. Underlying this was a more primary issue, that the code introducing the 
2.4 behavior into the 2.2 tree was &quot;subtly broken&quot;. Further 
investigation turned up some race conditions that affected both the 2.2 and 2.4 
wait queue code. Fixes for those are in the works; here isAndrew Morton's draft 
patch for the 2.4 series. 
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Daniel Phillips posted a Request for Comment on a patch that <b>uses 
semaphores for daemon wakeup</b> instead of relying on the wait queues. The 
primary result is to produce much cleaner code; neither performance 
improvements nor penalties were expected.
<p> </p></li> 
<li> 
<p> <b>Other patches and updates released this week</b> include: </p>
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Jan Kara has ported his quota patch to -test12 and provided some notes on 
the patch, which includes both fixes and some additional functionality.
<p> </p></li> 
<li> Rasmus Anderson posted an updated version of his rcpci45.c patch, a 
general cleanup that includes an update to the new PCI API.
<p> </p></li> 
<li> Ingo Oeser has released an updated version of his OOM-Killer-API patch. 
This patch allows people to add the OOM handler of their choice to the 2.4 tree 
(The choice of an OOM handler for the 2.4 tree has not yet been determined, 
just discussed).

planned to take up work in Germany, France, Sweden and Italy within the first 
quarter of 2001.</p>
<p><b>Lunar Penguin bites the dust</b>. The Lunar Penguin distribution has 
been removed from the LWN Distributions list upon confirmation from project 
founder Chuck Smead that the project is dead. &quot;<em>I may resurrect it 
later but it's gone for now... :-(</em>&quot;. This distribution was first 
discussed in theJanuary 13th, 2000 Distributions Summary and was aimed at ISPs 
and e-business customers. (Thanks to Joseph Klemmer).</p>
<p><b>The First Annual PPC/Linux Community Awards</b>. PenguinPPC.org presents 
a roast/toast for the year 2000. There are mock awards followed by a serious

<h2>Distribution Reviews</h2> 
<p><b>Review: Best Linux 2000 R3 (Duke of URL)</b>. The latest distributions 
review from the Duke of URL coversBest Linux 2000 R3. &quot;<em>The install 
routine is arguably one of the better ones out there, rivaled by Mandrake and 
Caldera. This is an installation routine a neophyte could use. It is much 
closer to what the new user needs - an install program that holds your hand and 
gets you into the system as soon as possible.</em>&quot; </p>
<h2>General-Purpose Distributions</h2> 
<p><b>Redmond Linux beta 2 released</b>. Redmond Linux beta 2 has been 
announced. Redmond Linux is a Caldera-based distribution with a target audience 
for non-technical desktop customers. See theAugust 3rd, 2000 LWN Distributions

article is the second in a LinuxDevices.com series by Jerry Epplin that 
explores Linux on PDAs and handheld devices. This installment looks at the 
contribution made by handhelds.org. &quot;<i>Before you attempt to use any of 
the add-on development toolkits, I recommend that you first install the 
handhelds.org environment, and become familiar with its resources. That's 
because the add-ons rely heavily on the handhelds.org environment as a base for 
many of their services.</i>&quot; </p> 
<h2>Office Applications</h2> 
<p><b>AbiWord 0.7.12 released</b>. AbiWord 0.7.12 has been released. From the 
announcement: &quot;<i>This release represents a huge step forward for the 
AbiWord team. The new features, Gnome-integration, and bugfixes are too 
numerous to list here. If you've held off on using AbiWord because you felt 
that it was 'too unstable' or not well integrated with Gnome, this release 
might be right for you.</i>&quot; </p>

discusses the release of theQGtkWidget and QGtkApplications classes, which 
facilitate the interoperability of KDE and Gnome applications. &quot;<em>
QGtkWidget and QGtkApplications are classes for combining Qt and Gtk widgets in 
a single application. While this sort of thing doesn't make much sense under 
normal circumstances, it can be used to help KDE and GNOME applications 
interact better (think of adding GNOME control-center plugins to KControl and 
vice versa).</em>&quot; </p> 
<p><b>Wei Zhong Oriental Language Environment</b>. WZOLE, the Wei Zhong 
Oriental Language Environment,is available free of charge for non-commercial

disadvantages (the main one being the well-known difficulty of mastering the 
system). Here'sa Babelfish link to translate the front page into English, but 
using Babelfish on a document of this length is an unrewarding activity.

<h1>Linux in the news</h1> <br>

<h2>Recommended Reading</h2> 
<p><b>Open Source and 'Sexy' Projects (osOpinion)</b>. What makes an 
application &quot;sexy&quot;? This osOpinion piece gives some answers. &quot;<i>
Some hackers are writing an open source Cobol, something I never expected would 
happen (I have a January 1993 copy of the GNU's Bulletin, pg. 11, quote: 
&quot;?but no one has volunteered to do Cobol yet.&quot;). People are building 
an open source Delphi community -- and Delphi is a development of Pascal, a 
wonderful learner's language, but with limitations for serious work.</i>&quot; 
</p> 
<h2>Companies</h2> 
<p><b>Birth of a new Embedded Linux company (LinuxDevices)</b>. Tuxia in 
Augsburg, Germanylaunched itself into the Embedded Linux market. &quot;<i>
Tuxia's initial Embedded Linux product family, expected to become available 
early in 2001, is a software suite called &quot;TASTE&quot; (which stands for 
Tuxia Appliance Synthesis Technology Enabled). TASTE derives from Infomatec's 
JNT Internet appliance oriented Embedded Linux technology.</i>&quot; </p> 
<p><b>E-smith Launches Partner Program (ZDNet)</b>. ZDNet  reports on 
e-smith's partner program. &quot;<i>E-smith targets small businesses 5 to 100 
users with its Linux wares. Local and regional integrators and resellers as 
well as system builders represent the company's primary channel to reach that 
customer set. E-smith's partner program initially has signed up 19 companies.
</i>&quot; </p> 
<p><b>Open source stalwart Sendmail looks to wireless for profits (Upside)</b>
. Here's an article in Upsidelooking at Sendmail's acquisition of Nascent 
Technologies. &quot;<i>Sendmail, you'll remember, was the first open source to 
win backing by major investors way back in 1998 when it secured a $6 million 
round of financing from the Silicon Valley investment group Band of Angels.</i>
&quot;</p> 
<h2>Business</h2> 
<p><b>Linux: A Contender for The Enterprise Market (DB2)</b>. DB2 Magazine has 
taken a look atLinux as a contender in the Enterprise Market. After examining 
the reasons for choosing Linux, they move on, not too surprisingly, to talking 
about the combination of Linux and DB2. &quot;<em>For a true test of the 
installation process, I went to a local college and recruited a student who was 
completely new to Linux and databases. I handed him all the necessary how-to 
information and asked him to come by my computer lab when he thought he could 
install Linux and DB2. When he stopped by that evening, I set up the same two 
systems and had him install Red Hat 6.1, which took about 30 minutes, and then 
the DB2 database on both Red Hat boxes. It took him longer to fill in his 
information and download the source code from IBM than it took for him to 
install and configure the DB2 database on the Linux box. If that isn't ease of 
use, I don't know what is.</em>&quot; </p>
<p> Also from DB2 Magazine: Serving Up Linux, with details on the beta version 
of IBM's DB2 Universal Database Enterprise-Extended Edition (DB2 UDB EEE) for 
Linux. (Thanks to Cesar A. K. Grossmann).</p> 
<p><b>The year for open source (Upside)</b>. Upside names the year 2000 as the 
&quot;Year for Open Source&quot; in a two part series covering thefirst half and
second half of the year. &quot;<em>Gone is the talk about changing the software 
industry as we know it. In its place stands a familiar set of the goals: 
earning money, building market share, maximizing shareholder return and, of 
course, keeping an even keel in case this New Economy thing was everything it 
was made out to be three years ago.</em>&quot; </p> 
<p><b>Linux companies beat Microsoft in Itanium support (News.com)</b>. 
C|Net's News.com reports onLinux beating Windows to the Itanium punch. &quot;<i>
Itanium is scheduled to ship in the first half of 2001, but a new version of 
Windows tailored for the chip won't arrive until the second half, Intel and 
Microsoft representatives said. Meanwhile, compatible production versions of 
Linux from Red Hat, Turbolinux and Caldera Systems are scheduled to debut at 
the same time as the chip itself, the Linux companies said.</i>&quot; </p> 
<h2>Resources</h2> 
<p><b>Linux Laptop SuperGuide (ZDNet)</b>. The staff at the Linux Hardware 
Database have put togetherthe ultimate guide to finding the perfect Linux laptop
.</p> 
<h2>Reviews</h2> 
<p><b>Helix Gnome: Linux on the Desktop, Part 1 (Computer Source)</b>. The 
Helix Gnome installer and basic features are examined in this article from 
Computer Source Magazine. &quot;<i>This is an impressive desktop. The icons are 
beautiful, and the menus are well-coordinated. Although the default color 
scheme was pleasing, I was able after a few minutes to choose an alternative 
one I liked better. The menus, except for the inclusion of no less than five 
text editors/word processors, was complete and yet not overbearing.</i>&quot; 
</p> 
<p><b>A Sneak Preview of Emacs 21.0 (LinuxPlanet)</b>. LinuxPlanet plays with 
an emacs 21.0 prerelease. &quot;<i>On starting the program up, I immediately 
understood where the rumors of Emacs' GNOMEification had come from: where the 
program used to present a very sparse, black and white window with simple, 
unadorned, menus it now has a toolbar providing a set of basic buttons familiar 
to anyone who's ever used GNOME or a GTK app. The splash screen, I also 
noticed, showed something besides fixed-width fonts for a change: Emacs has 
support for scaled, proportional fonts.</i>&quot; </p> 
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2> 
<p><b>Linux is too much (ZDNet)</b>. Here's a ZDNet opinion piece claiming 
that Linux is too big and too complicated. &quot;<i>Does the average user 
really need a bunch of terminal apps, several hex editors, a mail and Web 
server, and a bevy of compilers? Heck, the average developer doesn't even need 
all that.</i>&quot; </p> 
<p><b>Instant Messaging on GNU/Linux (Linux Orbit)</b>. John Gowin from Linux 
Orbit writes about various Instant Messaging programs for Linux. &quot;<em>In 
this article series, we're going to take a look at some of the IM clients 
available for GNU/Linux and rate them. Were also going to look at some of the 
new universal clients available for GNU/Linux that let you use AOL, MSN, Yahoo 
and ICQ all at the same time, with only one client. In Part 1 of this series, 
we'll look at the AOL IM service and the Linux clients available.</em>&quot; 
</p> 
<p><b>Their gain, your pain (ZDNet)</b>. ZDNet's Evan Leibovitch  looks at 
&quot;Open licensing&quot; schemes. &quot;<i>So what is an 'open license'? The 
term apparently evolved from what most folks refer to as volume purchasing: 
buying software licenses in bulk without the extra boxes and CD-ROMs. With an 
open license, instead of all that packaging, all you need to keep track of are 
license numbers or unlocking keycodes - and those can even be delivered by 
e-mail.</i>&quot; </p>

Kernel made #4 onWired's Vaporware 2000, along with a mention of Linux-based 
organizers. Honors were shared with the Y2K bug, Microsoft's .NET strategy, 
wireless web pads, Bluetooth and Max OS X, which got the top, or to be more 
accurate, the bottom honors.

<h1>This week in history</h1> <br>
<b>Two years ago</b> The LWN staff took a 
much needed break.
<p> <b>One year ago</b> (December 30, 1999 LWN): LWN took a close look at the 
LinuxOne amended S-1 filing, and noted some suspicious claims within. Despite 
the large wave of Linux based IPOs going on at the time, that one failed to 
materialize.</p>
<p> The development kernel was version 2.3.35 and the stable kernel was <i>
still</i> version 2.2.13, but the fix of a major IDE bug would allow version 
2.2.14 to move forward. Support for the IBM S/390 was to be included in version 
2.2.14. The inclusion of the kernel based web server, khttpd, was debated. The 
discussion centered on whether adding the complexity of a web server to the 
kernel was justifiable, even if it produced an incredibly fast web server.</p>
<p> Tiny Linux, intended for small, obsolete computers, was released. Version 
1.0 came out in April, 2000 and the project is still active.</p>
<p> LWN mentioned a  Salon article that questioned the stability of the Linux 
and dot com stock market frenzy: &quot;<em>Sooner or later, dot-com mania must 
be headed for a fall -- whenever you see this many lemmings gathered together 
in one place, you just know a steep cliff has got to be nearby. Could the rush 
to invest in companies which base their business models on free software be the 
last straw? Certainly, many observers who have long looked askance at the last 
few years of Internet insanity have seized upon the VA Linux IPO as just the 
latest, freakiest example of how crazy things are getting.</em>&quot; </p>
<p> <b>Last, but not least,</b> the dark gloom of impending disaster loomed 
heavily over sys-admins and programmers everywhere, just a few hours until all 
hell would break loose due to zillions of unfixed<b>Y2K Bugs</b>. All of the 
advance work paid off and computers all around the world sailed smoothly into 
year<i>19100</i>. </p>  &nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

<pre> Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2000 00:43:31 -0800 (PST) From: Matt Dillon 
&lt;dillon@earth.backplane.com&gt; To: letters@lwn.net Subject: Yet more on 
Elevator algorithms and write ordering I'm afraid there is considerable 
confusion over write ordering in a filesystem. The confusion stems from an 
assumption that dependant operations are queued to the disk device all 
together. This assumption is not true of FFS with softupdates. FFS with 
softupdates turned on will queue all *NON* dependant buffers to disk all at 
once and doesn't care in the least whether the kernel, the disk device, or the 
physical disk itself reorders the writes. Dependant buffers are not queued 
until non-dependant buffers have completed their I/O's. FFS without softupdates 
will use synchronous writes where necessary to (try to) ensure that dependant 
buffers are not queued until after such I/O's have completed. EXT2FS is roughly 
similar to FFS. However, both EXT2FS and FFS (without softupdates) have cases 
related to directories, inodes, and file blocks where *NO* write ordering is 
correct even if you do things synchronously. Filesystems are more complex then 
they seem. Softupdates deals with these interdependant cases by actually 
unrolling portions of the buffers when writing them to disk to guarentee 
consistency on-disk, allowing it to operate almost completely asynchronously 
without endangering the filesystem A log-structured filesytem deals with such 
cases by writing a sequential log, but there is nothing preventing even a log 
structured filesystem from writing a bunch of log blocks in random order as 
long as it doesn't try to recover past any holes created due to a crash or 
commit the file structure until after the (asynchronous) log block I/O has 
completed. What this means is that a kernel, disk device, and physical disk 
should be allowed to reorder blocks however they please. It is up to the 
filesystem code to handle dependant operations. -Matt</pre> <br>

<pre> Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2000 10:44:44 +0000 From: Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS 
&lt;edmundo@rano.org&gt; To: letters@lwn.net Subject: problems in /tmp You'll 
probably get a lot of letters like this one ...
http://lwn.net/2000/1221/security.php3: &gt; Into this model was introduced 
/tmp, a shared directory to which &gt; anyone had write privileges and the 
ability to delete files created by &gt; other users. Since it is amazing how 
many otherwise experienced people don't know about the &quot;sticky bit&quot; 
on directories, you really should have mentioned here that /tmp is usually 
created with permissions 1777, which means it is &quot;append-only&quot;: you 
can't delete other people's files. This would also have been a good place to 
educate some of your readers about what exactly the &quot;problems in 
/tmp&quot; are. AFAIK, the main problem is a &quot;symlink attack&quot;: if an 
attacker can guess that a program might open the file /tmp/foo for writing, 
they can create a symbolic link from /tmp/foo to /etc/passwd, say. If the 
program is running as root, it overwrites the password file, unless the program 
was clever enough to use O_EXCL, but even then, there may be a possibility for 
a denial-of-service of attack. See the man pages for mktemp and mkstemp. On SCO 
UnixWare a brute-force solution to this problem is used: the kernel does not 
allow symbolic links to be created in a directory with the sticky bit set which 
does not belong to the caller. I don't know of any legitimate application that 
require symbolic links in /tmp, so this solution should perhaps be considered 
as an option for Linux. Edmund</pre> <br>

&lt;maierj@home.com&gt; To: lwn@lwn.net Subject: to: Liz Coolbaugh Hi Liz, 
First off, thanks for the good work. You do a great job with the security page 
at LWN. I especially like your editorializing of bugtraq threads...this week's 
comments on the /tmp discussion is a great example. I stopped following the 
thread (and the offshoots from it) after the first few posts seemed to say the 
same thing. If you hadn't linked to it in LWN, this would have caused me to 
miss Kris Kennaway's post. Anyway, I really like your work, and I appreciate 
the fact that you don't snub OpenBSD users ;-) WRT, the Kaspersky Lab virus 
review, you said:&gt;...or, perhaps, it's the fact that it takes a little more 
than &gt;a bogus email attachment in the Linux environment...?  I suspect that 
you made the above comment because the email attatchment can only run in the 
context of the user reading the mail, and that user should not be root. While 
this is correct, it simply means that malware is limited in the amount of 
damage that it can do to the system configuration. A malicious program in a 
unix environment could still destroy all of the files of the user. Most 
corporate environments have decent backup policies for end users, but home 
users typically don't back up files as often as they should, and a piece of 
malware that destroyed local user files could be very nasty for them. It is 
also important to note the increase in the tendancy for unix desktop user to 
prefer HTML-rendering mail clients. Many of these clients - especially the ones 
that are incorporated into a browser - may have active scripting vunerabilies 
that could allow manipulation or deletion of the user's local files. I suspect 
that the reason we have not seen more email-born malware in the unix 
environment is not due to the slightly limited scope of the damage that can be 
done. (Loss of data can be enough of a problem, even if the system 
configuration is unharmed.) Instead, I suspect that the currently heterogenious 
use of email clients make it more difficult to write a virus that will affect a 
large number of people in the way the Outlook-dominated Windows platform can be 
affected. If the *nix world starts to be predominated by a single email client, 
it will start to attract malware authors. This is especially true if the client 
is HTML/active scripting aware. Unfortunately, noone seems to be taking this 
seriously, and I have not seen any viable solutions offered. -- &quot;When you 
understand UNIX, you will understand the world. When you understand NT....you 
will understand NT&quot; - Richard Thiemehttp://www.slothnet.com - is currently

&lt;davina@lickey.com&gt; To: letters@lwn.net Subject: Rick Collette's 
&quot;petition&quot; to British Telecom I was very interested in your coverage 
of British Telecom's patent infringement lawsuit against Prodigy (LWN 
12/21/00). I happily clicked on the link to Rick Collette's 
&quot;petition&quot; to British Telecom, thereby myself infringing upon their 
patent (or at least contributing to your infringement). I was anxious to add my 
signature to what I assumed would be a petition to British Telecom urging them 
to drop their absurd lawsuit. Instead, I found the following: &quot;British 
Telecom is claiming they own the rights to the Hyperlink. That's saying that 
everything you click on a website, the method used to bring you from one page 
to another, belongs to them. They are currently suing Prodigy for this, and 
it's only going to worsen. We must stand up and put a stop to this craziness. 
The signatures collected here will be sent to the Linux Journal, deepLINUX, 
MSN, and any other media outlet that I can think of.&quot; This is *not*, in 
fact, a petition. This is merely a statement of fact. Why would anyone sign it? 
Webster's Dictionary defines a petion as &quot;1 a solemn, earnest supplication 
or request to a superior or deity or to a person or group in authority; prayer 
or entreaty&quot; OR &quot;2 a formal writing or document embodying such a 
request, addressed to a specific person or group and often signed by a number 
of petitioners&quot;. This &quot;petition&quot; is not addressed to British 
Telecom and does not actually make any request. When someone starts a real 
petition to British Telecom about this issue, I will be more than happy to add 
my signature to it. Regards, Davina Armstrong</pre> <br>
