<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL &amp; PHP or Perl or Python
</h2> <br>
<br>

<p><b>The acronym LAMP (or L.A.M.P.) refers to a set of free software programs 
commonly used together to run dynamic Web sites or servers:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Linux</b>, the operating system; </li> 
<li><b>Apache</b>, the Web server; </li> 
<li><b>MySQL</b>, the database management system (or database server); </li> 
<li><b>Perl</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>Python</b>, and/or (rarely) Primate, 
scripting/programming languages.</li> </ul>
<p><b>Though PHP does very well run on Windows but it produces synergic effect 
when used on Linux.</b></p>
<p><b>The acronym has three major uses:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Define a web server infrastructure </li> 
<li>Define a programming paradigm of developing software </li> 
<li>Define a software distribution package </li> </ul>
<p><b>To be precise, it is an open source Web platform.</b></p>
<p>Though the originators of these open source programs did not design them 
all to work specifically with each other, the combination has become popular 
because of its low acquisition cost and because of the ubiquity of its 
components (which come bundled with most current Linux distributions 
particularly as deployed by ISPs). When used in combination they represent a 
solution stack of technologies that support application servers. Other such 
stacks include unified application development environments such as Apple 
Computer's WebObjects, Java/Java EE, Grails, and Microsoft's .NET architecture.
<br><br>
The scripting component of the LAMP stack has its origins in the CGI 
web interfaces that became popular in the early 1990s. This technology allows 
the user of a web browser to execute a program on the web server, and to 
thereby receive dynamic as well as static content. Programmers used scripting 
languages with these programs because of their ability to manipulate text 
streams easily and efficiently, even when they originate from disparate 
sources. For this reason system designers often referred to such scripting 
systems as glue languages.<br>
<br>
Michael Kunze coined the acronym LAMP in an 
article for the German computing magazine c't in 1998 (12/98, page 230). The 
article aimed to show that a bundle of free software could provide a viable 
alternative to commercial packages. Knowing about the IT-world's love of 
acronyms, Kunze came up with LAMP as a marketing-like term to popularize the 
use of free software. O'Reilly and MySQL AB have popularized the term among 
English-speakers. Indeed, MySQL AB has since based some of its marketing 
efforts on the popularity of the LAMP stack.<br>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor)</b> is a reflective programming 
language originally designed for producing dynamic Web pages. PHP is used 
mainly in server-side application software, but can be used from a command line 
interface or in standalone graphical applications.<br>
<br>
PHP competes with 
Visual Basic and C++ as the third most popular programming language behind Java 
and C, based on world wide availability of practitioners, courses and vendors. 
Available under the PHP License, PHP is an open source language and is 
considered to be free software by the Free Software Foundation.</p> 
</blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>History</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b>PHP</b> was written as a set of CGI binaries in the C programming 
language by the Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, to replace a 
small set of Perl scripts he had been using to maintain his personal homepage. 
Lerdorf initially created PHP to display his r&eacute;sum&eacute; and to 
collect certain data, such as how much traffic his page was receiving. 
&quot;Personal Home Page Tools&quot; was publicly released on June 8, 1995 
after Lerdorf combined it with his own Form Interpreter to create PHP/FI.<br>

<br><b>PHP 3<br>
</b>Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers at 
the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, rewrote the parser in 1997 and 
formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive 
initialism &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor&quot;. The development team 
officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997 after months of beta testing. 
Public testing of PHP 3 began immediately and the official launch came in June 
1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing 
the Zend engine in 1999.[4] They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, 
Israel, which is actively involved with PHP development.<br>
<br>
<b>PHP 4<br>

</b>In May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released. The 
latest version as of September 2006 is 4.4.4. PHP 4 is currently still 
supported by security updates for those applications which require it.<br>
<br>

<b>PHP 5<br>
</b>On July 13, 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by Zend Engine 
II. PHP 5 included new features such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Robust support for Object-Oriented Programming (or OOP) through PHP Data 
Objects</li> 
<li>Performance enhancements taking advantage of the new engine </li> 
<li>Better support for MySQL through a completely rewritten extension </li> 
<li>Better XML support through a suite of interoperable tools </li> 
<li>Embedded support for SQLite </li> 
<li>Integrated SOAP support </li> 
<li>Data iterators </li> 
<li>Error handling through exceptions </li> </ul> 
<p><b>The latest version as of October 2006 is PHP 5.1.6.</b></p> </blockquote>
<p><br>
<b>Usage</b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>PHP generally runs on a web server, taking PHP code as its input and 
creating Web pages as output, but command-line scripting and client-side GUI 
applications are part of the three primary uses of PHP as well.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Server-side scripting<br>
</b>Originally designed to create dynamic web 
pages, server-side scripting is the principal focus for PHP. While running the 
PHP parser with a web server and web browser, the PHP model can be compared to 
other server-side scripting languages such as Microsoft's ASP.NET system, Adobe 
ColdFusion, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, Zope, mod_perl and the Ruby on 
Rails framework, as they all provide dynamic content to the client from a web 
server. To more directly compete with the &quot;framework&quot; approach taken 
by these systems, Zend is working on the Zend Framework - an emerging (as of 
June 2006) set of PHP building blocks and best practices; other PHP frameworks 
along the same lines include CakePHP and Symfony.<br>
<br>
The LAMP 
architecture has become popular in the Web industry as a way of deploying 
inexpensive, reliable, scalable, secure web applications. PHP is commonly used 
as the P in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache and MySQL. PHP can be used with 
a large number of relational database management systems, runs on all of the 
most popular web servers and is available for many different operating systems. 
This flexibility means that PHP has a wide installation base across the 
Internet; over 18 million Internet domains are currently hosted on servers with 
PHP installed.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Command-line scripting<br>
</b>PHP also provides a command line 
interface SAPI for developing shell and desktop applications, log parsing, or 
other system administration tasks. It is increasingly used on the command line 
for tasks which have traditionally been the domain of Perl, awk, or shell 
scripting.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Client-side GUI applications<br>
</b>PHP provides bindings to GUI 
libraries such as GTK+ and text mode libraries like ncurses in order to 
facilitate development of a broader range of cross-platform GUI applications.
