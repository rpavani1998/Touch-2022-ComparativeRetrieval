<h4>Innovate Faster in the Cloud with a Platform as a Service</h4> 
<h4>Best Practices for Open Source Adoption</h4> 
<h4>Developing .NET/C# Applications with VoltDB</h4> 
<h4>Micro Focus Silk Performer</h4> There's reason to celebrate today as 
SQLite 3.7 is released in GA.&nbsp; The lightweight, ubiquitous database 
includes some game-changing new features, which have arrived about two years 
after the 3.6 beta came out.&nbsp; Today'srelease will feature nested 
transactions, constrained foreign keys, write-ahead logs, and more.<br>
<br>

You can probably find a fewdevices around you right now that use SQLite.&nbsp; 
The FOSS database engine is embedded in everything from Skype and AIR, to 
programming language bundles like Python and PHP, to browsers like Firefox and 
Chrome, and all major smartphones. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
SQLite is an in-process 
library that can be used when a client/server database is not the best 
option.&nbsp; It implements a serverless, self-contained, transactional SQL DB 
engine that requires no configuration.&nbsp; SQLite 3.7 will add query planner 
enhancements, nested transactions, constrained foreign keys, and write-ahead 
logging, which has been one of the most anticipated new features.<br>
<br>

<h2>Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)</h2>There are several distinct advantages to 
using WAL instead of SQLite'srollback journal for implementing atomic commits 
and rollbacks.<br>
<br>

<ol> 
<li>In many cases, WAL is much faster.</li> 
<li>Better concurrency.&nbsp; WAL doesn't let readers block writers and vice 
versa. &nbsp;</li> 
<li>WAL's disk I/O operations are usually more sequential.</li> 
<li>Uses fewer fsync() operations, making it less vulnerable to issues in 
systems with broken fsync() system calls</li> </ol> <br>
Some disadvantages in 
this approach include an extra operation of checkpointing and less appeal as an 
application file-format.&nbsp; WAL is only available if the VFS supports 
shared-memory primitives.&nbsp; WAL also does not work over a network 
filesystem.<br>
<br>

<h2>Oracle Joins SQLite</h2> In related news, Oracle joined the SQLite 
Consortium last month.&nbsp; This means that Oracle will be have access to more 
complete test suites for validating Berkeley DB's SQLite API, which was 
unveiled in March.&nbsp; Oracle Senior Project Manager Gregory Burd had nothing 
but glowing compliments for thelittle engine that can.&nbsp; He said that 
SQLite 3's ANSI C API is the &quot;new 'ODBC'&quot; for relational DB access, 
and that SQLite makes &quot;the right trade-offs.&quot;&nbsp; Now Oracle has 
plans to continually work with SQLite developers, which means that conservative 
project manager of yours can get behind using SQLite knowing that Oracle is now 
behind it.<br>
<br>
The documentation should show you how to migrate from 3.6 
to 3.7.&nbsp; Gohere to find out how to 
use&nbsp;SQLite&nbsp;in&nbsp;different&nbsp;languages<br>
