 This is the third article in a series providing 
background information tomy talk for the MySQL User's conference, entitled 
MQL-to-SQL: a JSON-based Query Language for RDBMS Access from AJAX Applications.
<br> <br>
In the first installment, I introduced freebase, an open shared 
database of the world's knowledge and its JSON-based query language, the 
Metaweb Query Language (MQL, pronounced <em>Mickle</em>). In addition, I

 Yesterday, I wrote about how I think this year's 
MySQL conference will differ from prior editions. I also wrote that I will 
attend and thatI will be speaking on MQL-to-SQL. <br>

I promised I would 
explain a little bit more background about my talk, so here's the first 
installment.<br>

 I just received a 
confirmation that mypresentation proposal for the MySQL user conference 2011 
was accepted! The title for my proposal isMQL-to-SQL: a JSON-based Query 
Language for RDBMS Access from AJAX Applications, and it covers pretty much 
everything implied by the title.<br>
<br>
As always, the Hyatt Regency Hotel in 
Santa Clara, California serves as the venue. The conference will be held from 
April 11-14. Except for the venue and period, I think this year's conference 
will bear few similarities to previous editions. Let me try and explain.<br>

<h2>Java's future on Apple: Slightly less in doubt</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Last week, it looked like Apple was all &quot;You're not welcome here, 
Java.&quot; In the changeable world that is Jobsland, this week Apple was
offering to marry the language, reiterating their support for Java in OS X, and 
indicating that they would be supplying code and resources to the OpenJDK 
project.</p> 
<p>As I've noted before, this makes sense for Apple, because it gets them out 
of the JVM business, and makes Oracle the one-stop shopping solution for all 
your JDK and JRE needs. It also means that the Mac can be added as a 
regression-tested target for a new version of Java, hopefully</p>&nbsp; [Read

implement server side pagination (recommended for large sets of data) and to 
get and display the results in a text field featuring Ajax functionality. Ajax

 After having worked for two years and one quarter of a year with 
MySQL AB (now Sun), I have decided to resign and pursue another career. <br>

<br>Before I joined MySQL AB I was working as a database consultant and 
application developer. I knew that joining MySQL would mean giving that up, but 
I was happy to do so because I really liked the MySQL product. I was also 
attracted by the company itself, the flexible working hours, working from home, 
travelling abroad, and, very important, being one of the few companies that is 
capable creating FOSS software on a commercial basis.<br>
<br>
I have had a 
splendid time at MySQL AB, and later Sun. I met lots of smart people and 
travelled to a bunch of places I would probably not've had the chance<br>

 There are several JavaScript libraries that can 
be embedded in your webapplication to create a visually appealing interface.
Script.aculo.us is one of the popular ones and is built on the Prototype 
JavaScript Framework. The library provides an easy-to-use, cross-browser user 
interface JavaScripts that allows you to create fancy effects commonly visible 
on web pages these days.<br>

Ajax.Autocompleter that allows for server-powered autocompleting of text

<p> The last day I&rsquo;m suffering from different thoughts. So I&rsquo;ve 
decided to share&rsquo;em with you.<br>
<br>
 It is really possible to create 
the application such as gears, but independent from Google, that will run on 
most platofrms and browsers. What we need:<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Compile embeded MySQL (very lite edition) for most platforms (Windows, 
Linux and MacOSX, I believe that would be enough)</li> 
<li>Create Java Applet and JNI-wrapping library to access MySQL</li> 
<li>Create JavaScript library that will access MySQL through the applet</li> 
</ul> 
<p>And that&rsquo;s all. To use it you will need just to include the applet 
and JS-library into your page, after the first load applet will detect platform 
and will download embeded MySQL and native libraries.</p>  Google Test

<p>Here's the AJAX prototype example that I used in my AJAX presentation today.
</p> 
<p> I wanted to give an example of a good use of AJAX, and at the same time 
keep it simple. So I thought a good example would be to build a zip code 
verifier. As soon as the person enters the zip code it makes a request to the 
server to see if the zip code is in the database, and returns the city and 
state.</p> 
<p>So the user first sees this:</p> 
<p>Once the zip code is entered, and the response received it looks like this:
</p> 
<p>If the zip code is not found in the db:</p> 
<p>Ok, now lets build it...</p>
