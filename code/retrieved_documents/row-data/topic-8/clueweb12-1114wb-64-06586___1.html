<h2>Analyzing Illinois Pension Codes using the Open States&nbsp;Project</h2> 
<p>leave a comment &raquo;</p> 
<p>Tribune reporter Jason Grotto has been leading a team of Tribune and WGN-TV 
reporters ona series of investigations into the morass which is the Illinois 
pension system. Fora recent report, I helped them analyze the laws passed by 
the Illinois General Assembly to tell the broad story of how we got into this 
situation.</p> 
<p>If you look carefully, you can see me in the back corner of this room, 
hunched over my laptop. To my left is Ian Bicking, and to his left, Brian 
Boyer. (Photo by Joshua Ruihley)</p> 
<p>To do the analysis, we built upon the Open States Project framework 
developed by our friends atSunlight Labs. I&rsquo;ll write some more about the 
technical details below, but first, there&rsquo;s a good story. I metBrian Boyer
, my editor, at aSunlight Labs hackathon during the PyCon 2009 code sprints. At 
the event, we were working on code for the precursor project to Open States, 
although neither of us worked on code for Illinois&mdash;someone else had 
claimed that work. This was before the TribApps team was officially formed, but 
thanks to Sunlight, I was in a good position to apply for a spot on the team 
when it was created.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, in my first few weeks on the job, some of our reporters came 
to us interested in General Assembly research. By that point, it appeared that 
the Open States Illinois work was not going anywhere, so I worked out the 
basics of scraping the site and contributed my work to the project.</p> 
<p>Two years later, Sunlight has continued to invest in Open States, which 
means that the code I contributed then has gotten better without a bit of work 
from me&mdash;you can probably see why we get enthusiastic about open source 
development. As a foundation for Open States, they&rsquo;ve made a very robust 
library calledScrapeLib, which can be used to manage caching and robots.txt 
compliance for any web scraper. It even has an interesting tool called
scrapeshell which is appealing to me as someone who likes interactive code 
development. If I find myself scraping any other web sites, I&rsquo;ll 
definitely use Sunlight&rsquo;s library rather than build my own.</p> 
<p>Some minor changes that were made to the Illinois General Assembly website 
had broken the scraper for past legislative sessions, but that turned out to be 
pretty easy to fix, so I was quickly up and running with the 2011 version of 
the code, and I was able to turn to gathering the data Jason needed. (And of 
courseI offered my fixes back to the core project.)</p> 
<h2>How we used Open States for this story</h2> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Jason and Tribune reporter Ray Long described 
Illinois&rsquo; system in the recent story:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Pension experts say healthy pension plans require stable, well-structured 
rules that are rarely altered. But Illinois&rsquo; pension code is a tangled, 
convoluted mess of provisions riddled with giveaways, funding flaws, excessive 
borrowing and pension holidays. Since 2003 alone, the pension laws have been 
revised nearly 700 times, according to a Tribune/WGN-TV analysis.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The first step in establishing figures like this for the story was to run a 
complete scrape of the General Assembly&rsquo;s legislative activity back to 
2003.&nbsp; Running on my MacBook, this took about four days and produced about 
one gigabyte&rsquo;s worth of JSON data files (not to mention over 3.7 GB of 
cached files from the ILGA website.)</p> 
<p>Since 2003, the General Assembly has filed nearly 60,000 pieces of 
legislation, but only a few of those became laws, and of course, most of those 
laws don&rsquo;t impact the pension codes. I wrote python code to analyze the 
data produced by the scrape to identify only those bills which were actually 
passed and signed by the governor. I then wrote some custom code to analyze the 
full text of the public act (that is, the version of the bill which was signed 
into law) to find those which made changes to theIllinois Pension Code. 
(Specifically, I looked for the text<code>40 ILCS 5</code> which refers to that 
section of the Illinois Compiled Statues.<code></code>) This allowed me to 
produce an index to changes to the pension laws since the 93rd session of the 
Illinois General Assembly,in spreadsheet form. On a technical note, one of the 
nice features of the ScrapeLib library mentioned above, and the 3.7+ GB of 
cached web pages, was that as I refined my code to build the index, I was able 
to run it against the cached documents, which made things much faster.</p> 
<p>Some of the code I wrote, like that which extracts the list of statutes 
impacted by a bill, is probably of general use. I haven&rsquo;t shared that 
back with the Open States project yet because I want to do it in a way which 
they believe is extensible to other states. I starteda conversation about that 
on the Open States developer list, but we haven&rsquo;t settled the question 
yet. Some other parts are more unique to how the Illinois legislature works, or 
just to how our team wanted to look at this specific issue. Open States has 
some provisions for &ldquo;custom&rdquo; data properties, so perhaps in the 
future I&rsquo;ll find time to determine a good way to include that as well.</p>

<h2>Better web cartography with dot density maps and new&nbsp;tools</h2> 
<p>with 16 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Between Brian, Joe, and myself there hasn&rsquo;t been a time in the last 
six months where at least one of us wasn&rsquo;t working with census data.</p> 
<p>Back in February we attacked the less-detailed (redistricting) data for 
print andthe web. In April, May, and June we contributed to a joint effort with 
an esteemed cadre of news nerds to developcensus.ire.org, a site intended to 
make it easier for journalists to report from census data. And to prepare for 
this recent release, we even spent a week hacking near-complete prototype maps 
using data that the census had already released, Kings County, New York.</p> 
<p>We learned hard lessons about the scale and nuance of the census in the 
last few months, and along the way, further built out our toolkit for making 
maps. Last week the Census Bureau released detailed (summary file) data for 
Illinois, and we used our new tools to produce a couple of maps we&rsquo;re 
pretty excited about:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>2010 Census: Same-sex partners in Chicagoland</li> 
<li>2010 Census: Children less than five years old (shown above)</li> </ul> 
<p>These maps demonstrate a map style we haven&rsquo;t attempted before: dot 
density mapping. Dot maps let us represent multi-variate data more richly than 
choropleth maps&ndash;for example, illustrating variation in race and 
population density simultaneously. We were inspired in this effort by Bill 
Rankin&rsquo;sRadical Cartography project and Dennis McClendon&rsquo;s race map 
for the Encyclopedia of Chicago.</p> 
<p>Many of the tools needed to create the maps we wanted didn&rsquo;t exist. 
Using the fantasticTileMill as our starting point, we began to build a toolkit.
</p> 
<h3>Invar</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Invar automates the generation of map tiles, and the deployment of tiles to 
S3. It is the first and least glamorous of the tools we created, but crucially, 
it&rsquo;s very, very fast. Fast!</p> 
<p>The first time we ever tried to create our own tileset, it took hours to 
render and twice as long to deploy. Thanks to invar&rsquo;s parallelizing these 
tasks, we can now produce a map in minutes and deploy it just as fast. In fact, 
we now deploy our maps to four separate S3 buckets so that we can take 
advantage ofLeaflet&lsquo;s support for round-robining tile requests to 
multiple subdomains. Fast!</p> 
<h3>Englewood</h3> 
<p>Next we needed to distribute dots across geographies. We found one 
implementation of dot distribution in Python, which we extended into a module 
for reuse.</p> 
<p>Englewood (named after an ailing Chicago neighborhood that the newspaper 
writes many sad stories about) uses the Python bindings forGDAL to load data 
from PostGIS or shapefile. It scatters points within each feature and then 
writes the points out to a table or new shapefile.</p> 
<p>A small snippet of Python is required to configure Englewood. The following 
code renders the dots for our map of children less than five from a database. 
(A demo using shapefiles can be found inthe repository):</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> #!/usr/bin/env python from englewood import DotDensityPlotter def 
get_data(feature): &quot;&quot;&quot; This function is called for each feature 
Englewood processes and needs to return a dictionary of classes, with a number 
assigned to each. Englewood will divide this number by a &quot;dots_per&quot; 
value set below and create that many dots for that class within the geography. 
&quot;&quot;&quot; return { 'hispanic': 
feature.GetFieldAsInteger(feature.GetFieldIndex('hispanic_under5')), 'black': 
feature.GetFieldAsInteger(feature.GetFieldIndex('black_under5')), 'asian': 
feature.GetFieldAsInteger(feature.GetFieldIndex('asian_under5')), 'nhwhite': 
feature.GetFieldAsInteger(feature.GetFieldIndex('nhwhite_under5')) } # Example 
argument values passed into the DotDensityPlotter # In this case features are 
read from a PostGIS table (under_5_by_race_blocks_shapes)... source = 
'PG:dbname=chicagocensus host=localhost' source_layer = 
'under_5_by_race_blocks_shapes' # ...and written into another PostGIS table 
(under_five_dots) dest_driver = 'PostgreSQL' dest = 'PG:dbname=chicagocensus 
host=localhost' dest_layer = 'under_five_dots' get_data_callback = get_data 
dots_per = 1 dots = DotDensityPlotter(source, source_layer, dest_driver, dest, 
dest_layer, get_data_callback, dots_per) dots.plot()</pre> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Deployment</h3> 
<p>A fast and stable process is useless if you can&rsquo;t repeat it. 
We&rsquo;ve built out afabric configuration which allows us to make these maps 
in the quickest and most efficient way possible. Among other things, it allows 
us to keep some configuration (such as a bounding box) in a per-map YAML file. 
It parses this file and handles passing the correct arguments to invar for 
rendering and deployment. Perhaps most exciting, if you&rsquo;re using the new
TileMill 0.4 (available for OSX or Ubuntu) it can completely automate the 
production ofWax interactivity grids, such as we used to do the highlighting in 
our recent maps.</p> 
<p>Via Crayonsman (CC BY-SA 3.0)</p> 
<h3>Styling dots</h3> 
<p>Creating dot density maps created new challenges with regards to styling. 
Brian tried numerous approaches to color and size the dots, but ultimately we 
settled on a few principles that worked pretty well:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a dark, sparse base-layer (we used a custom-styled Google Maps layer, 
but would like to move to an Open Street Map base-layer in the future).</li> 
<li>Make your dots to stand out brightly. Try the fluorescent colors from the 
palette ofCrayola crayons.</li> 
<li>Play with transparency&ndash;you may want to take advantage of the effect 
of overlapping transparent dots.</li> 
<li>Make Dots scale on zoom.</li> 
<li>Whenever possible, use one dot per individual. It&rsquo;ll make for a more 
interesting map.</li> </ul> 
<p>Here is the style we settled on:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> #under-five { marker-fill:#f00; marker-line-width:0; 
marker-allow-overlap: true; marker-opacity:1; [group=&quot;asian&quot;] 
{marker-fill:#FF496C;} [group=&quot;black&quot;] {marker-fill:#76FF7A;} 
[group=&quot;hispanic&quot;] {marker-fill:#FFCF48;} [group=&quot;nhwhite&quot;] 
{marker-fill:#7366BD;} [zoom=9] {marker-height:.2;} [zoom=10] 
{marker-height:.3;} [zoom=11] {marker-height:.5; marker-opacity:.7;} [zoom=12] 
{marker-height:.8; marker-opacity:.7;} [zoom=13] {marker-height:1; 
marker-opacity:.8;} [zoom=14] {marker-height:1.5; marker-opacity:.8;} }</pre> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Wrapping up</h3> 
<p>Although I&rsquo;ve linked to a number of projects and code snippets in 
this post, you may find it useful to see a complete project. This week, with 
Illinois under our belt, I decided to apply the same methodology to my 
side-project,Hack Tyler. I produced a map of race in Smith County, Texas 
(relatedblog post). Part of Hack Tyler&rsquo;s <em>modus operandi</em> is 
developing in a completely transparent manner. As a result, you can see 
complete examples of both our backend and client-side mapping rigs in the 
following projects:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>hacktyler-maptiles</li> 
<li>hacktyler-census</li> </ul> 
<p>We hope that we&rsquo;ve pressed the envelope a bit with these new maps. 
Someone said that this was the year cartographers retake the internet. I hope 
that&rsquo;s true. Its about time that online maps were more than just shading 
boxes.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t break the homepage! Using unit tests to validate your 
WordPress + Varnish caching&nbsp;strategy</h2> 
<p>with 3 comments</p> 
<p>For the last few months my coworkers Ryan Mark and Ryan Nagle have been 
engaged in rebuilding the Tribune&rsquo;s blog-network,ChicagoNow.com (new 
version not yet launched). Much of the rebuild has revolved around migrating to 
a new architecture&ndash;Apache, WordPress, and Varnish. Being the 
&ldquo;Varnish guy&rdquo; on the team, I was asked to implement a similar 
caching strategy to what we had developed forTribLocal.com last summer. Perhaps 
the most important lesson I learned from TribLocal&rsquo;s development was that 
our cache layer was extremely fragile&ndash;it was prone to break when a new 
version of a site was deployed. Worse yet, minor changes to the VCL 
configuration frequently had unforeseen consequences that cascaded across the 
site.</p> 
<p>My intention with ChicagoNow was to do a much better job of 
compartmentalizing the various elements of the configuration to ensure changes 
were idempotent, however, Brian had an even better idea: unit tests. For those 
who want to cut to the chase, here is the Pythonunittest script for testing our 
Varnish cache layer. The script knits together three unrelated technologies in 
order to allow us to test how changes to the site affect the cache:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Python&rsquo;s standard library unittest module</li> 
<li>Kenneth Reitz&rsquo;s Python requests library</li> 
<li>Max Cutler&rsquo;s python-wordpress-xmlrpc library</li> </ul> 
<p>The unittest module provides a convenient framework for isolating tests 
from one another and python-requests dramatically simplifies the process of 
making various types of requests and testing the response headers. The VCL for 
the site attaches &ldquo;X-Cache&rdquo; and &ldquo;X-Cache-Hit&rdquo; debug 
headers indicating whether the response was a cache hit or miss and if it was a 
hit how many hits there have been. The final component in the stack is the 
python-wordpress-xmlrpc library, which makes it nearly trivial to create posts 
and comments programmatically. This is crucial to testing if the cache is being 
correctly invalidated. Let&rsquo;s take a look at a couple tests to see how 
these three components work together.</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> class TestLoggedOut(TestCachingBase): &quot;&quot;&quot; Tests for 
logged-out users. &quot;&quot;&quot; def test_homepage(self): url = 
build_url('/') response = self.get_twice(url) self.assertHit(response) 
self.assertMaxAge(response, 300) def test_homepage_login_logout(self): url = 
build_url('/') cookies = self.login() cookies = self.logout(cookies) response = 
self.get_twice(url, cookies=cookies) self.assertHit(response)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here we see two tests for logged-out users. The first test fetches the 
homepage of the site twice and assures that the second request was a hit and 
also that the max-age header is what we declared it to be in the VCL. The 
second test logs the user in and then out and then, while maintaining the same 
cookie jar, hits the homepage twice to ensure that the user gets cached results 
after logging out. Let&rsquo;s look at one more test from<code>TestLoggedOut
</code> to see how python-wordpress-xmlrpc comes into play:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> def test_edit_post(self): url = build_url('/%s/' % BLOG) post_id = 
self.new_post(BLOG) response = self.get_twice(url) self.assertHit(response) 
self.edit_post(BLOG, post_id) response = requests.get(url) 
self.assertMiss(response)</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>This test creates a new post on a particular blog, then hits the blog 
homepage twice to ensure it is cached. Then it edits the post that was created 
and hits the blog homepage once more to ensure that the cache was invalidated. 
Most of the actual functionality has been abstracted into the<code>
TestCachingBase</code> base class so the individual tests are brief and 
readable. The full test suite includes several other complex scenarios.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that we lack a good &ldquo;code coverage&rdquo; 
metric for this sort of testing and of course these aren&rsquo;t true 
&ldquo;unit tests,&rdquo; but using unit testing tools in this way goes a long 
way toward organizing the logic. The best thing about this cache testing rig is 
knowing that if we change something we can easily check if we have broken 
anything else (i.e. regression testing). This was a frequent problem with 
TribLocal and I think this implementation is going to go a long way toward 
preventing that from happening again.</p>

<h2>From spreadsheet to HTML in 15 minutes with python-tablefu, Jinja 
and&nbsp;Flask</h2> 
<p>with one comment</p> 
<p>The best Christmas carol</p> 
<p>We often need to take a spreadsheet of info and lay it out in HTML on 
deadline. Typically we useProPublica&rsquo;s TableSetter which takes a google 
spreadsheet and generates an HTML table. TableSetter can be tweaked in a bunch 
of different ways to customize the generated table, but as with all specialized 
tools it has it&rsquo;s limits. Luckly it&rsquo;s easy to create a rudementary 
tablesetter clone in python quite quickly.</p> 
<p>This week I got a spreadsheet of Christmas carols with YouTube embed codes 
to go along with a story about aNorthern Illinois University professor and 
carol expert who recently died. The shape of the data in the spreadsheet lent 
itself more to a top-ten-style list than a table, so TableSetter was not the 
best tool for the job. The spreadsheet was only 25 rows, but I was not about 
build all the HTML by hand.</p> 
<p>I exported the spreadsheet to a csv file, created a simple html template 
and wrote a simple script to mash the two together. I usedChris Amico&rsquo;s 
python clone of ProPublica&rsquo;s TableFu and the great templating library 
Jinja.</p> 
<p>Here is the result.</p> 
<h2>Here is the code</h2> 
<p></p> 
<pre> #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import jinja2 import 
table_fu TEMPLATE_DIR = 'templates' DATA_FILE = 'data/xmas-carols.csv' 
TEMPLATE_FILE = 'xmas-carols.html' OUTPUT_FILE = 'build/xmas-carols.html' # Set 
up jinja templates. Look for templates in the TEMPLATE_DIR env = 
jinja2.Environment(loader=jinja2.FileSystemLoader(TEMPLATE_DIR)) # Open the csv 
file and load it up with TableFu table = table_fu.TableFu(open(DATA_FILE, 'U')) 
# Get the template and render it to a string. Pass table in as a var called 
table. html = env.get_template(TEMPLATE_FILE).render(table=table) # Write the 
html string to our OUTPUT_FILE o = open(OUTPUT_FILE, 'w') o.write(html) 
o.close()</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>Jinja templates are very similar to Django templates. The biggest 
difference that I can discern is the much more powerful template syntax. It 
does stuff that I always thought Django templates should be able to do.</p> 
<p>Well this script is kinda boring without the template:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> &lt;ul id=&quot;xmas-songs&quot;&gt; {% for row in table.rows %} 
&lt;li&gt; {% if row['Year featured']|trim %} &lt;div 
class=&quot;featured&quot;&gt;{{ row['Year featured'] }}&lt;/div&gt; {% endif 
%} &lt;div class=&quot;name&quot;&gt;{{ row['Name'] }}&lt;/div&gt; {% if 
row['youtube'] %} &lt;div class=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;{{ row['youtube']|safe 
}}&lt;/div&gt; {% endif %} &lt;div 
class=&quot;written&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;Written:&lt;/small&gt;

<p>That&rsquo;s it. There are a lot of cool things you can do with TableFu 
that aren&rsquo;t illustrated here, andJinja does a ton of stuff, their 
documentation is pretty extensive.</p> 
<p>Oh there&rsquo;s one other thing. If you don&rsquo;t feel like dropping 
back to the shell to run the script to update your HTML with your new CSS or 
HTML changes, you may want to &hellip;</p> 
<h2>Sprinkle a little Flask into the mix</h2> 
<p></p> 
<pre> #!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- import jinja2 import

<p>There you go. Just run your script, visit http://localhost:5000/ and see 
your handiwork. Reload the page when you make changes. And when you&rsquo;re 
all done, just grab the output file and drop it where it needs to go.</p>

<h2>Bees with machine guns! Low-cost, distributed load-testing using&nbsp;EC2.
</h2> 
<p>with 20 comments</p> 
<p><strong>The challenge</strong></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> You don&rsquo;t get to start optimizing until you&rsquo;ve made the 
servers fucking cry.<br>
 &mdash;Brian Boyer </p> </blockquote> 
<p>In June we launched Chicago Breaking Business, which is, at least in terms 
of traffic, our largest site so far. Both before and during that project I had 
been iterating toward a load-testing solution that would meet the challenge of 
the above quote and provide us with a reasonable certainty that sites of this 
size (and larger) would not collapse under sudden waves of traffic. The 
traditional load-testing tools we tried (ab, flood, jmeter, etc.), while often 
useful, suffered from a number of problems when trying to simulate this sort of 
event:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Testing clients may have an operating system imposed maximum number of 
out-bound connections.</li> 
<li>Testing a staging environment from a development workstation introduces 
network latency, firewalling, and traffic shaping as variables in the tests.
</li> 
<li>Testing from a single client will cause Amazon&rsquo;s Elastic Load 
Balancer to route all connections to a single application server, no matter how 
many are available. (so-called &ldquo;sticky sessions&rdquo;)</li> </ul> 
<p>What we needed was a solution that allowed us to use multiple, 
topographically-close clients to all simultaneously assault our servers with 
traffic.</p> 
<p>Put it another way, what we needed were <em>bees with machine guns</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong></p> 
<p>Bees with machines guns is a fabric script that I put together to 
aggressively load-test our sites. It provides methods to spin up an army of EC2 
instances (the bees), assault a target server with a configurable amount of 
traffic, and then spin those instances back down.</p> 
<p>Here is an example of what a Bees session might look like:</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> $ fab -f bees.py up:2 Connecting to the hive. Attempting to call up 2 
bees. Waiting for bees to load their machine guns... . . . . Bee i-df450ab4 is 
ready for the attack. . Bee i-dd450ab6 is ready for the attack. The swarm has 
assembled 2 bees. Done. $ fab -f bees.py 
attack:http://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/,1000,100 Read 2 bees from the roster. Connecting 
to the hive. Assembling bees. Each of 2 bees will fire 500 rounds, 50 at a 
time. Stinging URL so it will be cached for the attack. [localhost] run: curl 
http://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/ &gt;&gt; /dev/null Organizing the swarm. Bee 0 is 
joining the swarm. Bee 1 is joining the swarm. Bee 0 is firing his machine gun. 
Bang bang! Bee 1 is firing his machine gun. Bang bang! Bee 0 is out of ammo. 
Bee 1 lost sight of the target (connection timed out). Offensive complete. 
Target failed to fully respond to 1 bees. Complete requests: 500 Requests per 
second: 81.670000 [#/sec] (mean) Time per request: 612.188000 [ms] (mean) 50% 
response time: 358.000000 [ms] (mean) 90% response time: 1541.000000 [ms] 
(mean) Mission Assessment: Target successfully fended off the swarm. The swarm 
is awaiting new orders. Done. $ fab -f bees.py down Read 2 bees from the 
roster. Connecting to the hive. Calling off the swarm. Stood down 2 bees. Done.
</pre> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>(Note: Bees assumes you have AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and 
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY set as environment variables&ndash;just as you would if 
you were using the Amazon command line tools.)</em></p> 
<p>Using the Bees I was able to verify that our new load-balanced and Varnished
 servers could handle a sustained load significantly beyond our requirements. 
Obviously this testing strategy doesn&rsquo;t attempt to address all scenarios 
and it should be used in conjunction with traditional testing tools such as
jmeter. That being said, it also provides a pretty interesting example of using 
EC2 to solve problems that can really only be properly addressed with 
distributed computing. This particular example is very well-suited to 
validating caching and scaling strategies.</p> 
<p><strong>The caveat</strong></p> 
<p>If you decide to use the Bees, <strong>please keep in mind the following 
important caveat</strong>: they are, more-or-less a distributed 
denial-of-service attack in a fancy package and, therefore, if you point them 
at any server you don&rsquo;t own you will behaving<strong>unethically</strong>
, have your Amazon Web Services account<strong>locked-out</strong>, and be 
<strong>liable</strong> in a court of law for any downtime you cause.</p> 
<p>You have been warned.</p> 
<p>Now then&ndash;how does your server handle thousands of simultaneous 
connections?</p>

<h2>Advanced django project&nbsp;layout</h2> 
<p>with 24 comments</p> 
<p>Default django project layout versus news apps project layout</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re releasing our project layout for Django, based on Gareth 
Rushgrove&rsquo;s lovely django-project-templates. If you&rsquo;ve found 
yourself unsatisfied with the default layout, or you&rsquo;re using ourfabfile 
orec2 image, you might be interested in using our project layout.</p> 
<p>The default Django project layout makes it dead simple to learn the 
framework and get an application up and running. But it can quickly get 
cumbersome as your application grows and you have to figure out how to handle 
deployment. A few projects, most notablyPinax, have their own ways to organize 
large projects.</p> 
<p>Here are the things that we need that the default layout doesn&rsquo;t 
provide a solution for:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Separate settings, Apache configuration files and WSGI handlers for local 
development, a staging server and a production server.</li> 
<li>A separate place for the various primary source data files (CSV, JSON, 
shape files) we typically have in a project.</li> 
<li>A place to put Django apps that does not clutter up the root directory of 
the project.</li> 
<li>A library directory to keep various reusable helper functions that are not 
Django applications.</li> 
<li>A template directory and media directory for the entire project.</li> </ul>
<p>Gareth&rsquo;s project is really well organized and addresses all of these 
issues. We tweaked his templates to match our use case.</p> 
<p><strong>Getting off the ground<br>
</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Clone my fork of django-project-templates.<br>

<pre>git clone git://github.com/ryanmark/django-project-templates.git</pre>
</li> 
<li>Install the templates. It will install the dependencies: PasteScript, 
Cheetah and Fabric. You may want to use a new virtualenv.<br>

<pre>python setup.py install</pre></li> 
<li>Create a new project from the News Apps Paste template.<br>

<pre>paster create --template=newsapps_project example_project</pre></li> 
<li>You&rsquo;ll be asked for staging and production domains, a git repository 
location and a database password. These setting will be put in the fabfile and 
will be used for deployment. You&rsquo;ll also be asked for a secret key which 
is used internally by Django. It&rsquo;s okay to press enter and accept the 
defaults. The template will still get created, you&rsquo;ll just have to edit 
the fabfile later if you plan on deploying the project to a staging or 
production server.</li> </ol> 
<p>The template contains a lot of personal preference but it&rsquo;s been very 
useful for us and&nbsp; handful of projects. We are all quite satisfied with 
it. Take it, use it, tell us what you think!</p>

<h2>Best practices in web development with Python and&nbsp;Django</h2> 
<p>with 27 comments</p> 
<p>At some point during the course of developing the Elections Center it 
became clear to me that each of us was spending too much development time 
trying to understand one another&rsquo;s code. Sometimes this was because our 
intuitions about the right way to do things were different, other times it was 
a difference of priorities, but most often it was simply due to a lack of any 
explicit best practice.</p> 
<p>Being something of a documentation and organization junky I took it upon 
myself to begin to collate a best practices guide. The hope was that in doing 
this we could both ensure craft knowledge was well-distributed as well as 
minimize the amount of &ldquo;why did he do it that way?&rdquo; moments when 
reading one another&rsquo;s code. (More famously,WTFs/minute.) In our 
fast-paced environment there is little justification for being confused when it 
could have been avoided by simply writing it down.</p> 
<p>What follows are the best practices we have established (by commission and 
arbitration) thus far. Some of them are tried-and-true policies (PEP 8), others 
are process-driven (the use of python&rsquo;s logging module), and a few are 
entirely idiosyncratic (formatting of CSS files). All of them combine to 
provide us with explicit expectations for reading one another&rsquo;s code and 
therefore a much easier time when are obligated to fix it at 10:30, on a 
Sunday, for a Monday morning paper.</p> 
<p>We hope you will find them inspirational and make many suggestions about 
how they can be improved.</p> 
<h3><strong>1. Version control</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Excluding bug-fixes, active development should not be performed on the 
stable branch.</li> 
<li>Large, discrete units of work should be developed on their own feature 
branches, so that another developer can pick it up if you get hit by a truck.
</li> 
<li>Feature branches should be prefixed with the owner&rsquo;s initials to 
prevent confusion, e.g. &ldquo;bb_polls&rdquo;.</li> 
<li>Feature branches should merge <strong>from</strong> master as often as is 
feasible, to prevent merge headaches later on.</li> 
<li>Completed feature branches should be merged into master and deleted from 
the remote repository so that they are not mistaken for work-in-progress.</li> 
<li>At the end of each iteration (when features are about to be deployed to 
production), master should be merged into stable and then stableHEAD should be 
tagged, e.g. &ldquo;v3.0&rdquo;. For example:<br>

<pre> git tag -a v3.0 -m &quot;Deploying iteration 3.&quot; git push --tags 
</pre></li> 
<li>In the event a release needs to be redeployed with fixes, increment the 
sub-version index, e.g. &ldquo;v3.1&rdquo;</li> 
<li>Follow the principle of &ldquo;merge early, merge often&rdquo; to prevent 
conflicts.</li> 
<li>Commit messages should accurately summarize each task included in the 
commit, otherwise<code>git log</code> is useless.</li> 
<li>Commit messages that reference tickets should use the <code>#1234</code> 
syntax so that they are automatically associated in issue tracker.</li> 
<li>Commit messages that close tickets should use the <code>Closes #1234</code>
 syntax to automatically tie the commit to the appropriate ticket.</li> 
<li>Always install dependencies in a <code>mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages 
$name</code> environment. This eliminates the possibility of version conflicts 
and makes setup as easy as<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3><strong>2. Python</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Follow PEP 8 best practices, this means (among other things):</li> 
<li>Four-space tabs are required.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use <code>from package import *</code>.</li> 
<li>Do use whitespace liberally.</li> 
<li>Do use descriptive lower_case_with_underscores variable names 
(understanding is much more important than brevity).</li> 
<li>Do put explanatory docstrings on all non-trivial classes and methods.</li> 
<li>If it isn&rsquo;t covered by PEP 8, refer to Idiomatic Python, which is 
far more thorough.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use print. Use Python&rsquo;s built-in logging so that output 
can be structured for different use-cases. (Also it makes transition to Py3k 
much easier.)</li> 
<li>Always request a logger with <code>log = 
logging.getLogger(&quot;project.app.module&quot;)</code>. Take note of the 
logger naming structure so that output can be filtered.</li> 
<li>Organize imports in a logical manner: standard libraries first, then 
third-party libraries, then our own modules. Alphabetization within groups 
takes only a few seconds and makes removing cruft easier.</li> 
<li>When in doubt, remember <code>import this</code>. (PEP 20)</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>3. Django</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Follow the Django Coding style with regard to naming, spacing, etc.</li> 
<li>Use pickled model fields with extreme caution.</li> 
<li>Build normalized models and denormalize only when necessary for 
performance. When feasible, do so without altering the original table.</li> 
<li>If you define a generic magic constant in a module (path, API key, url, 
etc) that is likely to be reused in another module define it in<code>settings.py
</code> instead.</li> 
<li>Use management commands instead of shell scripts. Remember that management 
commands can be invoked programmatically with<code>call_command()</code>.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget to activate the virtualenv when invoking a management 
command from cron:<br>

<pre> */5 * * * * source /home/newsapps/sites/$project/env/bin/activate 
&amp;&amp; /home/newsapps/sites/$project/repository/manage $command &gt;&gt; 
/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</pre></li> 
<li>Always include the RequestContext when rendering view templates. For 
example:<br>

<pre> render_to_response(&lsquo;template&rsquo;, template_dict, 
context_instance=RequestContext(request))</pre></li> 
<li>Put logic in view functions, not in templates. The simpler the template 
the better.</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>4. Javascript</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use jQuery in widgets that will end up on other sites.</li> 
<li>Otherwise, use jQuery.</li> 
<li>Whenever possible, put Javascript at the bottom of the page.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use inline Javascript.</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>5. HTML/CSS</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Add a top level ID to every kind of page (#race-page, #candidate-page)</li>
<li>Use IDs for elements that are unique to every page in the site. Use 
classes for everything else.</li> 
<li>Use hyphens for IDs and classes, no camelCase or underscores.</li> 
<li>Use descriptive and unique names for IDs. Use simple generic names for 
classes.</li> 
<li>Always define classes with nested rules: <code>#candidate-page .box-column 
.box .bar-chart</code>. Use your best judgment, don&rsquo;t go overboard with 
the nested rules, just enough to make sure your not going to style the wrong 
things. IDs rarely need to be nested</li> 
<li>Each CSS selector gets its own line. The block of rules has to share. It 
makes big CSS scannable:<br>

<pre> a:link {color:#336699;} a:hover, a:active {color:#6d9fd2;} a:visited 
{color:#336699;} a:visited:hover {color:#6d9fd2;}</pre></li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely on (because of IE6): 
<ul> 
<li>min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height</li> 
<li>overflow:hidden</li> 
<li>css tables</li> 
<li>attribute selectors</li> 
<li>psudo-classes (other than for a tags)</li> 
<li>&gt; (child selector)</li> 
<li>position:fixed</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>If you are positioning one block absolutely inside another, make sure the 
parent has a specified size.</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use inline styles.</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>6. Images</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use them.</li> 
<li>If you use them, make sure you use photoshop&rsquo;s &ldquo;Save for 
web&hellip;&rdquo; or figure out another way to optimize them.</li> 
<li>Use jpeg for images with lots of different colors and gradients, png/gif 
for images with few colors.</li> 
<li>PNG rules (if you&rsquo;re relying on PNG fix) 
<ul> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t use PNGs. If it hurts, blame Microsoft.</li> 
<li>If you use PNGs, don&rsquo;t use PNGs with alpha</li> 
<li>If you use PNGs with alpha, use them in img tags only.</li> 
<li>If you use PNGs with alpha as background images: 
http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6</li> </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<h3><strong>7. Testing</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Use unit tests to validate non-trivial methods.</li> 
<li>Always test methods that involve date math, statistical calculations, 
non-ducky type conversions, or extract data from arbitrary sources (Excel, web, 
etc).</li> </ul>
