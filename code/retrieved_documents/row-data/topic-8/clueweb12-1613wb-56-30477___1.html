<p>When it comes to sorting items by comparing them, merge sort is one very 
natural approach. It is natural because it simply divides the list into two 
equal sub-lists then sorts these two partitions applying the same rule. That is 
a typical divide and conquer algorithm and it follows the intuitive approach of 
speeding up the sorting process by reducing the number of comparisons. However 
there are other &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; sorting algorithms that do not 
follow the merge sort scheme, while maintaining a similar level of success. 
Such an algorithm is quicksort.</p> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<p>Back in 1960 C. A. R. Hoare came up with a brilliant sorting algorithm. In 
general quicksort consists of some very simple steps. First we have to choose 
an element from the list (called a pivot) then we must put all the elements 
with a value less than the pivot on the left side of the pivot and all the 
items with value greater than the pivot on its right side. After that we must 
repeat these steps for the left and the right sub-lists. That is quicksort! 
Simple and elegant!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is a pure divide and conquer approach like merge sort, but while merge 
sort&rsquo;s tricky part was merging the sorted sub-lists, in quicksort there 
are other things to consider.</p> 
<p>First of all, the best choice for a pivot is the bottleneck. Indeed it all 
depends on that pivot. Imagine that you choose the greatest value from the list 
&ndash; then you have to put all the other items of the list into the 
&ldquo;left&rdquo; sub-list. If you do that on each step you&rsquo;ll 
practically go into the worst scenario and that is no good. The thing is that 
in the worst case quicksort is not so effective and it&rsquo;s practically as 
slow as bubble sort and insertion sort. The good thing is that in practice with 
randomly generated lists there is not a high possibility to go into the worst 
case of quicksort.</p> 
<h3>Choosing a pivot</h3> 
<p>Of course the best pivot is the middle element from the list, leaving the 
list divided into two fairly equal sub-lists. The problem is that there&rsquo;s 
not an easy way to get the middle element from a list and this will slow down 
the algorithm. So typically we can get for a pivot the first or the last item 
of the list.</p> 
<p>After choosing a pivot the rest is simple. Put every item with a greater 
value on the right and every item with a lesser value on the left. Then we must 
sort the left and right sub-lists just as we did with the initial list.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that with this algorithm we&rsquo;re naturally going into 
a recursive solution. Typically every divide and conquer approach is easy to 
implement with recursion. But because recursion can be heavy, there is an 
iterative approach.</p> 
<h2>Implementation</h2> 
<p>As I said above, the recursive approach is something very natural for 
quicksort as it follows the divide and conquer principles. On each step we 
divide the list in two and we pass those sub-lists to our recursive function. 
But recursion is dangerous sometimes, so an iterative approach is also 
available. Typically iterative approaches &ldquo;model&rdquo; recursion with 
extra memory and a model of a stack, which is our case. Here we have two 
examples of quicksort &ndash; recursive and iterative in PHP. Let&rsquo;s see 
the recursion on first:</p> 
<h3>Recursive Quicksort<br>
<br>
</h3> 
<pre>$list = array(5,3,9,8,7,2,4,1,6,5); // recursive function 
quicksort($array) { if (count($array) == 0) { return array(); } $pivot = 
$array[0]; $left = $right = array(); for ($i = 1; $i &lt; count($array); $i++) 
{ if ($array[$i] &lt; $pivot) { $left[] = $array[$i]; } else { $right[] = 
$array[$i]; } } return array_merge(quicksort($left), array($pivot), 
quicksort($right)); } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 print_r(quicksort($list));
</pre> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Iterative Quicksort<br>
<br>
</h3> 
<pre>$list = array(5,3,9,8,7,2,4,1,6,5); // iterative function 
quicksort_iterative($array) { $stack = array($array); $sorted = array(); while 
(count($stack) &gt; 0) { $temp = array_pop($stack); if (count($temp) == 1) { 
$sorted[] = $temp[0]; continue; } $pivot = $temp[0]; $left = $right = array(); 
for ($i = 1; $i &lt; count($temp); $i++) { if ($pivot &gt; $temp[$i]) { $left[] 
= $temp[$i]; } else { $right[] = $temp[$i]; } } $left[] = $pivot; if 
(count($right)) array_push($stack, $right); if (count($left)) 
array_push($stack, $left); } return $sorted; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
print_r(quicksort_iterative($list));</pre> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Complexity</h2> 
<p>The complexity of quicksort in the average case is O(n*log(n)) &ndash; same 
as Merge sort. The problem is that in the worst case it is O(n2) &ndash; same 
as bubble sort. Obviously the worst case is when we have an already sorted 
list, and we constantly take for a pivot the last element of the list. But we 
should consider that in practice we don&rsquo;t quite use sorted lists that we 
have to sort again, right?</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Application</h2> 
<p>Quicksort is a great sorting algorithm and developers often go for it, but 
let&rsquo;s see some pros and cons of it.</p> 
<h3>Why using quicksort</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Recursive implementation is easy</li> 
<li>In general its speed is same as merge sort &ndash; O(n*log(n))</li> 
<li>Elegant solution with no tricky merging as merge sort</li> </ul> 
<h3><br>
Why not using quicksort</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>As slow as bubble sort in the worst case!</li> 
<li>Iterative implementation isn&rsquo;t easy</li> 
<li>There are faster algorithms for some sets of data types</li> </ul> 
<p><br>
Quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its 
principles. If you have two sorted lists, one with items with a greater value 
from a given value and the other with items smaller form that given value, you 
can simply concatenate them and you can be sure that the resulting list will be 
sorted with no need of special merge.</p> 
<p>In fact quicksort is a very elegant general purpose sorting algorithm and 
every developer should be familiar with its principles.</p>  Tags:
