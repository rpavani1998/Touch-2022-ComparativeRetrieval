<h1>Using Traits in PHP 5.4</h1> 32  | By: Shameer C | Posted: February 8, 2012
 |PHP Tutorials <br>

<p>Minimizing code duplication through better organization and code reuse is 
an important goal of Object Oriented Programming. But in PHP it can sometimes 
be difficult because of the limitations of the single inheritance model it 
uses; you might have some methods that you would like to use in multiple 
classes but they may not fit well into the inheritance hierarchy.</p> 
<p>Languages like C++ and Python allow us to inherit from multiple classes 
which solves this problem to some extent, and mixins in Ruby allows us to mix 
the functionality of one or more classes without using inheritance. But 
multiple inheritance has issues such as theDiamond Problem problem, and mixins 
can be a complex mechanism to work with.</p> 
<p>In this article I will discuss traits, a new feature introduced in PHP 5.4 
to overcome such issues. The concept of traits itself is nothing new to 
programming and is used in other languages like Scala and Perl. They allows us 
to horizontally reuse code across independent classes in different class 
hierarchies.</p> 
<h2>What a Trait Looks Like</h2> 
<p>A trait is similar to an abstract class which cannot be instantiated on its 
own (though more often it&rsquo;s compared to an interface). The PHP 
documentation defines traits as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Traits is a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such 
as PHP. A Trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance by 
enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent 
classes living in different class hierarchies.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider this example:</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php class DbReader extends Mysqli { } class FileReader extends 
SplFileObject { }</pre> 
<p>It&rsquo;d be a problem if both classes needed some common functionality, 
for example making both of them singletons. Since PHP doesn&rsquo;t support 
multiple inheritance, either each class will have to implement the necessary 
code to support the Singleton pattern or there will be an inheritance hierarchy 
that doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Traits offer a solution to exactly this type of 
problem.</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php trait Singleton { private static $instance; public static 
function getInstance() { if (!(self::$instance instanceof self)) { 
self::$instance = new self; } return self::$instance; } } class DbReader 
extends ArrayObject { use Singleton; } class FileReader { use Singleton; }</pre>
<p>The trait <code>Singleton</code> has a straight forward implementation of 
the Singleton pattern with a static method<code>getInstance()</code> which 
creates an object of the class using this trait (if it&rsquo;s not already 
created) and returns it.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to create the objects of these classes using the method 
<code>getInstance()</code>.</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php $a = DbReader::getInstance(); $b = FileReader::getInstance(); 
var_dump($a); //object(DbReader) var_dump($b); //object(FileReader)</pre> 
<p>We can see that <code>$a</code> is an object of <code>DbReader</code> and 
<code>$b</code> is an object of <code>FileReader</code>, but both are now 
behaving as singletons. The method from<code>Singleton</code> has been 
horizontally injected to the classes using it.</p> 
<p>Traits do not impose any additional semantics on the class. In a way, you 
can think of it as a compiler-assisted copy and paste mechanism where the 
methods of the trait is copied into the composing class.</p> 
<p>If we were simply subclassing <code>DbReader</code> from a parent with a 
private<code>$instance</code> property, the property wouldn&rsquo;t be shown in 
the dump of<code>ReflectionClass::export()</code>. And yet with traits, there 
it is!</p> 
<pre>Class [ class FileReader ] { @@ /home/shameer/workplace/php54/index.php 
19-22 - Constants [0] { } - Static properties [1] { Property [ private static 
$_instance ] } - Static methods [1] { Method [ static public method instance ] 
{ @@ /home/shameer/workplace/php54/index.php 6 - 11 } } - Properties [0] { } - 
Methods [0] { } }</pre> 
<h2>Multiple Traits</h2> 
<p>So far we have used only one trait with a class, but in some cases we may 
need to incorporate the functionality of more than one trait.</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php trait Hello { function sayHello() { echo &quot;Hello&quot;; } } 
trait World { function sayWorld() { echo &quot;World&quot;; } } class MyWorld { 
use Hello, World; } $world = new MyWorld(); echo $world-&gt;sayHello() . &quot; 
&quot; . $world-&gt;sayWorld(); //Hello World</pre> 
<p>Here we have two traits, <code>Hello</code> and <code>World</code>. Trait 
<code>Hello</code> is only able to say &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; and trait <code>World
</code> can say &ldquo;World&rdquo;. In the <code>MyWorld</code> class we have 
applied<code>Hello</code> and <code>World</code> so that the <code>MyWorld
</code> object will have methods from both traits and be able to say 
&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;.</p> 
<h2>Traits Composed of Traits</h2> 
<p>As the application grows, it&rsquo;s quite possible that we will have a set 
of traits which are used across different classes. PHP 5.4 allows us to have 
traits composed of other traits so that we can include only one instead of a 
number of traits in all these classes. This lets us rewrite the previous 
example as follows:</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php trait HelloWorld { use Hello, World; } class MyWorld { use 
HelloWorld; } $world = new MyWorld(); echo $world-&gt;sayHello() . &quot; 
&quot; . $world-&gt;sayWorld(); //Hello World</pre> 
<p>Here we have created the trait <code>HelloWorld</code>, using traits Hello 
and World, and included it in<code>MyWorld</code>. Since the <code>HelloWorld
</code> trait has methods from the other two traits, it&rsquo;s just the same 
as if we had including the two traits in the class ourselves.</p> 
<h2>Precedence Order</h2> 
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already mentioned, traits work as if their methods have been 
copied and pasted into the classes using them and they are totally flattened 
into the classes&rsquo; definition. There may be methods with the same name in 
different traits or in the class itself. You might wonder which one will be 
available in the object of child class.</p> 
<p>The precedence order is:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>the methods of a trait override inherited methods from the parent class
</li> 
<li>the methods defined in the current class override methods from a trait</li>
</ol> 
<p>This is made clear in the following example:</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php trait Hello { function sayHello() { return &quot;Hello&quot;; } 
function sayWorld() { return &quot;Trait World&quot;; } function 
sayHelloWorld() { echo $this-&gt;sayHello() . &quot; &quot; . 
$this-&gt;sayWorld(); } function sayBaseWorld() { echo $this-&gt;sayHello() . 
&quot; &quot; . parent::sayWorld(); } } class Base { function sayWorld(){ 
return &quot;Base World&quot;; } } class HelloWorld extends Base { use Hello; 
function sayWorld() { return &quot;World&quot;; } } $h = new HelloWorld(); 
$h-&gt;sayHelloWorld(); // Hello World $h-&gt;sayBaseWorld(); // Hello Base 
World</pre> 
<p>We have a <code>HelloWorld</code> class derived from <code>Base</code>, and 
both classes have a method named<code>sayWorld()</code> but with different 
implementations. Also, we have included the trait<code>Hello</code> in the 
<code>HelloWorld</code> class.</p> 
<p>We have two methods, <code>sayHelloWorld()</code> and <code>sayBaseWorld()
</code>, the former of which calls <code>sayWorld()</code> which exists in both 
classes as well as in the trait. But in the output, we can see the one from the 
child class was invoked. If we need to reference the method from the parent 
class, we can do so by using the parent keyword as shown in the<code>
sayBaseWorld()</code> method.</p> 
<h2>Conflict Resolution and Aliasing</h2> 
<p>When using multiple traits there may be a situation where different traits 
use the same method names. For example, PHP will give a fatal error if you try 
to run the following code because of conflicting method names:</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php trait Game { function play() { echo &quot;Playing a game&quot;; 
} } trait Music { function play() { echo &quot;Playing music&quot;; } } class 
Player { use Game, Music; } $player = new Player(); $player-&gt;play();</pre> 
<p>Such trait conflicts aren&rsquo;t resolved automatically for you. Instead, 
you must choose which method should be used inside the composing class using 
the keyword<code>insteadof</code>.</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php class Player { use Game, Music { Music::play insteadof Game; } } 
$player = new Player(); $player-&gt;play(); //Playing music</pre> 
<p>Here we have chosen to use the <code>play()</code> method of the <code>Music
</code> trait inside the composing class so the class <code>Player</code> will 
play music, not a game.</p> 
<p>In the above example, one method has been chosen over the other from two 
traits. In some cases you may want to keep both of them, but still avoiding 
conflicts. It&rsquo;s possible to introduce a new name for a method in a trait 
as an alias. An alias doesn&rsquo;t rename the method, but offers an alternate 
name by which it can be invoked. Aliases are created using the keyword<code>as
</code>.</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php class Player { use Game, Music { Game::play as gamePlay; 
Music::play insteadof Game; } } $player = new Player(); $player-&gt;play(); 
//Playing music $player-&gt;gamePlay(); //Playing a game</pre> 
<p>Now any object of class <code>Player</code> will have a method <code>
gamePlay()</code>, which is the same as <code>Game::play()</code>. Here it 
should be noted that we have resolved any conflicts explicitly, even after 
aliasing.</p> 
<h2>Reflection</h2> 
<p>The Reflection API is one of the powerful features of PHP to analyze the 
internal structure of interfaces, classes, and methods and reverse engineer 
them. And since we&rsquo;re talking about traits, you might be interested to 
know about the Reflection API&rsquo;s support for traits. In PHP 5.4, four 
methods have been added to<code>ReflectionClass</code> to get information about 
traits in a class.</p> 
<p>We can use <code>ReflectionClass::getTraits()</code> to get an array of all 
traits used in a class. The<code>ReflectionClass::getTraitNames()</code> method 
will simply return an array of trait names in that class.<code>
ReflectionClass::isTrait()</code> is helpful to check if something is a trait 
or not.</p> 
<p>In the previous section we discussed having aliases for traits to avoid 
collisions due to traits with the same name.<code>
ReflectionClass::getTraitAliases()</code> will return an array of trait aliases 
mapped to its original name.</p> 
<h2>Other Features</h2> 
<p>Apart from the above mentioned, there are other features that makes traits 
more interesting. We know that in classical inheritance the private properties 
of a class can&rsquo;t be accessed by child classes. Traits can access the 
private properties or methods of the composing classes, and vice versa! Here is 
an example:</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php trait Message { function alert() { echo $this-&gt;message; } } 
class Messenger { use Message; private $message = &quot;This is a 
message&quot;; } $messenger = new Messenger; $messenger-&gt;alert(); //This is 
a message</pre> 
<p>As traits are completely flattened into the class composed of them, any 
property or method of the trait will become a part of that class and we access 
them just like any other class properties or methods.</p> 
<p>We can even have abstract methods in a trait to enforce the composing class 
to implement these methods. For example:</p> 
<pre>&lt;?php trait Message { private $message; function alert() { 
$this-&gt;define(); echo $this-&gt;message; } abstract function define(); } 
class Messenger { use Message; function define() { $this-&gt;message = 
&quot;Custom Message&quot;; } } $messenger = new Messenger; 
$messenger-&gt;alert(); //Custom Message</pre> 
<p>Here we have a trait <code>Message</code> with an abstract method <code>
define()</code>. It requires all classes which use this trait to implement the 
method. Otherwise, PHP will give an error saying there is an abstract method 
which has not been implemented.</p> 
<p>Unlike traits in Scala, traits in PHP can have a constructor but it must be 
declared public (an error will be thrown if is private or protected). Anyway, 
be cautious when using constructors in traits, though, because it may lead to 
unintended collisions in the composing classes.</p> 
<h2>Summary</h2> 
<p>Traits are one of the most powerful features introduced in PHP 5.4, and 
I&rsquo;ve discussed almost all their features in this article. They let 
programmers reuse code fragments horizontally across multiple classes which do 
not have to be within the same inheritance hierarchy. Instead of having complex 
semantics, they provide us with a light weight mechanism for code reuse. Though 
there are some drawbacks with traits, they certainly can help improve the 
design of your application removing code duplication and making it more DRY.</p>

<p>Finally! This is almost as good as multiple inheritance (I guess). When I 
first tried to convert some projects to OOP, I gave up because I knew what I 
wanted, and after googling I found it was called Multiple Inheritance, and PHP 
didn&rsquo;t support it. This looks like &ldquo;trait&rdquo; is basically a 
super-class that any class using it inherits.</p>

<p>Though traits have all the advantages of multiple inheritance, it&rsquo;s 
not part of inheritance. It will have only methods that are not a part of the 
inheritance hierarchy and can be used in multiple classes.</p>

<p>Good and informative post Shameer, except for the introductory Singleton 
example (just look at the couple of &ldquo;getInstance()&rdquo; calls and 
you&rsquo;ll see why it&rsquo;s not just a whimsy opinion). Singletons are 
old-fashioned, plagued with lots of issues, ranging from mutable global access, 
strong coupling, to single responsibility breakage (the list goes on), even in 
shared-nothing architectures like PHP&rsquo;s. More clever approaches, such as 
Dependency Injection help throw away easily Singletons into the trash can, 
through low-level factories or builders. You still can have one thing of 
something, without writing a bunch of fuzzy static methods, even if 
they&rsquo;re crowded behind a trait.</p>

<p>Hi Alex,<br>
 Thanks for the comment. I agree with your opinion. Overusing 
the Singleton pattern is a bad programming practice. There are some cases we 
can make use of it without any harm though. I used it in this article just to 
show an example of using traits still I strongly discourage its usage I will go 
through those links.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t seem to find an answer to the question of what happens when 
trait properties conflict? Can you use the &lsquo;insteadof&rsquo; and

stuck?</p>

<p>Hey Aric,<br>
 Me too tried to find an answer but failed. From a basic 
experiment I concluded that conflict will occur if the property have different 
default values in traits. However you can assign a different value from a 
method.</p>

<p>Awesome. It&rsquo;s not multiple inheritance and so still wouldn&rsquo;t 
allow quite the logical structure that one might look for in certain scenarios, 
but it&rsquo;s a massive benefit nonetheless. I&rsquo;m envisioning how this 
would improve several projects of mine (mainly in cases where I automatically 
generate new classes that need some common properties and methods but are 
otherwise unrelated).</p>

<p>Really good article!<br>
 One thing that bothers me. If a trait can define 
methods, including constructor what happens if a class uses two traits who both 
define constructor method. Well, you get from that by explicitly defining which 
one to use by the keyword &lsquo;insteadof&rsquo;. And second needs to be 
aliased and I guess, that won&rsquo;t be a constructor method anymore.<br>
 
What&rsquo;s even more interesting though is that if use define 
&lsquo;SomeTrait::someMethod as __construct;&rsquo;, can you define your own 
constructor method by aliasing some another method from inside a trait what was 
not intended to be used as a constructor method?</p>
