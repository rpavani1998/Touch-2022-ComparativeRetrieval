<p>______________________________</p> 
<p>Confused? So were we, which is why we put together this Hacks/Hackers 
Survival Glossary as an explanation of terms that help us understand the 
information landscape. This is a crowdsourced document that provides a guide to 
technologies involved in modern content distribution, coordinated by 
Hacks/Hackers, a grassroots group that brings journalists and technologists 
together. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t know Drupal from Django, API from Ajax, mashup from 
metadata? This is the list for you. It&rsquo;s written for intelligent 
nontechies in (mostly) plain English. Feel free to distribute or contribute.</p>
<p>Instructions here: http://hckhc.kr/asJT3s</p> 
<p>______________________________</p> 
<p>API (Application Programming Interface) &mdash; The way computer programs 
share data and functionality with other computer programs. APIs are an 
increasingly critical part of the Internet&rsquo;s interconnection. Many say 
that the future of the Internet lies in APIs because they help distribute and 
combine content. On the Web, APIs are generally special URLs that give back 
machine-readable data, in formats like JSON or XML, rather than human-readable 
data, which is usually HTML. Facebook, Twitter and Google Maps all have APIs 
that allow other websites or computer programs to use their underlying tools. 
The New York Times and NPR have also released APIs that allow other programs to 
draw on archives of movie reviews, restaurant reviews and articles.</p> 
<p>algorithm &mdash; A set of instructions or procedures used in order to 
accomplish a task, such as creating search results in Google. In the context of 
search, algorithms are used to provide the most relevant results first based on 
those instructions.</p> 
<p>Android &mdash; Usually used in the context of Android phone, Android is a 
free and open source operating system developed by Google that powers a variety 
of mobile phones from different manufacturers and carriers. It is a rival of 
the iPhone platform. In contrast to Apple&rsquo;s tightly controlled 
architecture and App Store, Android allows users to install apps from the 
Android Market and from other channels, such as directly from a 
developer&rsquo;s website &mdash; which allows for X-rated content, for 
example. Some well-known Android phones are the Nexus One, the Motorola Droid 
and HTC Evo. Expect to see competitors to the iPad running a version of Android.
</p> 
<p>app &mdash; Short for application, a program that runs inside another 
service. Many mobile phones allow apps to be downloaded, leading to a 
burgeoning economy for modestly priced software. Can also refer to a program or 
tool that can be used within a website. Apps generally are built using software 
toolkits provided by the underlying service, whether it is iPhone or Facebook.
</p> 
<p>AJAX &mdash; A bundle of technologies and techniques that allow a web page 
to do things quietly in the background without reloading the whole page. AJAX 
is not a programming language, but rather an acronym used to describe that 
bundle, &ldquo;Asynchronous Javascript and XML.&rdquo; AJAX provides much of 
the functionality associated with Web 2.0. One of the first big uses of AJAX 
was Gmail, which allowed it to be much more responsive than other web e-mail at 
the time.</p> 
<p>Atom &mdash; A syndication format for machine readable web feeds that is 
usually accessible via a URL. While it was created as an alternative to RSS 
(Real Simple Syndication) to improve upon RSS&rsquo;s deficiencies (such as 
ambiguities), it still is secondary to RSS. (See also,RSS)</p> 
<p>blog &mdash; One of the first widespread web-native publishing formats, 
generally characterized by reverse chronological ordering, rapid response, 
linking, and robust commenting. While originally perceived to be light on 
reporting and heavy on commentary, a number of blogs are now thoroughly 
reported, and legacy media organizations have also launched various blogs. 
Originally short for &ldquo;web log,&rdquo; blog is now an accepted word in 
Scrabble.</p> 
<p>Blogger &mdash; A simple, free blogging platform created by Pyra Labs, 
which was sold to Google in 2003. &nbsp;It was one of the first mass blogging 
services and is credited with popularizing the format. Unlike WordPress, it is 
not open source. Many Blogger sites are hosted at blogspot.com.</p> 
<p>civic media &mdash; An umbrella term describing media technologies that 
create a strong sense of engagement among residents through news and 
information. It is often used as a contrast to &ldquo;citizen journalism&rdquo; 
because it also encompasses mapping, wikis and databases. MIT has a Center for 
Future Civic Media.</p> 
<p>cloud computing &mdash; &nbsp;An increasingly popular computing model in 
which information and software are provided on demand from over the Internet 
rather than staying on local computers. Cloud computing is appealing because 
companies can reduce the amount they spend on their own computer servers and 
software but can also quickly and easily expand as the company grows. 
&nbsp;Examples of cloud computing applications include Google Docs and Yahoo 
Mail. Amazon offers two cloud computing services: EC2, which many start-ups now 
use as a cheap way to launch their products, and S3, an online storage system 
many companies use for cheap storage.</p> 
<p>client side &mdash; Referring to network software where work takes place on 
the user&rsquo;s computer, the client, rather than at the central computer, 
known as the server. Advantages of doing so include speed and bandwidth. An 
example is Javascript, a programming language that allows developers to build 
interactivity into websites. The work is done within the browser, rather than 
at the hosting website. (See also server side)</p> 
<p>CMS (Content Management System) &mdash; Software designed to organize large 
amounts of dynamic material for a website, usually consisting of at least 
templates and a database. It is generally synonymous with online publishing 
system. The material can include documents, photos or videos. While the first 
generation of content management systems were custom and proprietary, in recent 
years there has been a surge in free open-source systems such as Drupal, 
WordPress and Joomla. Content management systems are sometimes built custom 
from scratch with frameworks such as Ruby on Rails or Django.</p> 
<p>CPA (Cost Per Action) &mdash; A pricing model in which the advertiser is 
charged for an ad based on how many users take a specific, pre-defined 
action&mdash;such as buying a product from an online store&mdash;based on 
viewing an ad. &nbsp;This is the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for advertisers 
because it most directly matches the cost of an ad to its effectiveness. 
However, it&rsquo;s not commonly used since it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to 
measure: it is often unclear when or how to attribute an action to a specific 
ad. (Also sometimes referred to as Cost Per Acquisition.)</p> 
<p>CPC (Cost Per Click) &mdash; A pricing model in which the advertiser is 
charged for an ad based on how many users click it. This is a common model for 
&ldquo;search advertising&rdquo; (the all-text ads associated with search 
results) and for text ads in general. CPC is well-suited for 
&ldquo;directed&rdquo; advertising, intended to prompt an immediate response, 
because a user&rsquo;s clicking on an ad shows engagement with it. Google 
AdWords is generally priced on a CPC basis.</p> 
<p>CPM (Cost Per Mille) &mdash; Cost per one thousand (often views). Much of 
online advertising &mdash; particularly display advertising &mdash; is priced 
on a CPM basis. (Mille = Latin for one thousand; we use &ldquo;K&rdquo; for 
&ldquo;kilo&rdquo; almost everywhere else in tech, but &ldquo;M&rdquo; for 
&ldquo;mille&rdquo; here, which causes some confusion.) CPM is well suited for 
&ldquo;brand&rdquo; or &ldquo;awareness&rdquo; advertising, in which the 
primary purpose of the ad is not necessarily to prompt an immediate response.
</p> 
<p>Creative Commons &mdash; A flexible set of copyright licenses that allow 
content creators to specify which rights they reserve and which they waive 
regarding their work that is supposed to codify &nbsp;collaborative spirit of 
the Internet. There are six main Creative Commons licenses based on four 
conditions that creators can choose to apply: Attribution, Share Alike, 
Non-Commercial, and No Derivative Works. The least restrictive of the licenses 
is Attribution, which grants anyone, from an individual to a large company, the 
right to distribute, display, or otherwise make use of the work so long as the 
creator is credited. The most restrictive is Attribution Non-Commercial No 
Derivatives, which grants only redistribution. First released in December 2002 
by the nonprofit Creative Commons organization, which was inspired by the open 
source GNU GPL license, the licenses are now used on an estimated 130 million 
works worldwide. The glossary you are reading is released under a Creative 
Commons Attribution Share Alike license in an effort to encourage wide 
distribution and contribution. (Also see open source)</p> 
<p>CSS &nbsp;(Cascading Style Sheets) &mdash; Instructions used to describe 
the look and formatting for documents, usually HTML, so that the presentation 
is separate from the actual content of the document itself. If you watch a web 
page that loads slowly, you will often see the text first load and then 
&ldquo;snap into place&rdquo; with its look and feel. That look and feel is 
controlled by the CSS. CSS, which was first introduced by the World Wide Web 
Consortium in the late 1990s, helped eliminate the clumsy and often repetitive 
markup in the original HTML syntax. W3cschools.com has a great introduction to 
CSS with tutorials.</p> 
<p>CSV (Comma-Separated Values) &mdash; An extremely simple data format which 
stores information in a text file. CSV is popular precisely because it can be 
easily read by many different applications, including spreadsheets, word 
processors, programming text editors and web browsers. Thus it is a common way 
for people, including governments, to make their data available. Each row of 
data is represented by a line of text. Each column is delimited/separated by a 
comma (,). &nbsp;To prevent confusion about commas in the data, the terms are 
often surrounded by double quotes (&ldquo;). Many applications support the use 
of alternative column delimiters (the pipe character, |, &nbsp;is popular). 
Example below:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Name&rdquo;,&rdquo;Address&rdquo;,&rdquo;email&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Jack&rdquo;,&rdquo;1 Main St., Town, 
NY&rdquo;,&rdquo;jack@hill.com&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Jill&rdquo;,&rdquo;2 Elm St., City, 
CA&rdquo;,&rdquo;jill@hill.com&rdquo;</p> 
<p>data visualization &mdash; A growing area of content creation in which 
information is represented graphically and often interactively. This can be 
used for subjects as diverse as an analysis of a speech by the president and 
the popularity of baby names over time. While it has deep roots in academia, 
data visualization has begun to emerge on content sites as a way to handle the 
masses of data that are being made public, often by government. There are many 
tools for data visualizations, including Seattle-based Tableau and IBM&rsquo;s 
Many Eyes. Data visualization should 1) tell a story, 2) allow users to ask 
their own questions and 3) start conversations.</p> 
<p>document-oriented database &mdash; An increasingly popular type of 
database. In contrast to relational databases, which rigidly require 
information to be stored in pre-defined tables, document-oriented databases are 
more free-flowing and flexible. This is important when you don&rsquo;t know 
what is going to be thrown at you. Document-oriented databases retrieve 
information more quickly, but store it less efficiently. The same 
document-oriented database might let you store the information for an article 
(headline, byline, data, content, miscellaneous) or for a photo (file, 
photographer, date, cutline). &nbsp;MongoDB is a popular open source 
document-oriented database.</p> 
<p>Drupal &mdash; A popular content management system known for a vibrant 
open-source community that creates diverse and robust extensions. Drupal is 
very powerful, but it is somewhat difficult to use for simple tasks when 
compared to WordPress. Drupal provides options to create a static website, a 
multi-user blog, an Internet forum or a community website for user-generated 
content. It is written in PHP and distributed under the GPL open source 
license. &nbsp;Whitehouse.gov uses Drupal.</p> 
<p>Django &mdash; A web framework that is popular among news and information 
sites, in part due to its origin at Lawrence Journal-World in Kansas. &nbsp;It 
is written in Python, a sophisticated dynamic language. Major projects built in 
Django include Disqus, Everyblock.com and TheOnion.com. News applications 
teams, including those at the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, use the 
framework to present large data sets online in easily accessible ways.</p> 
<p>embed &mdash; A term meaning to place a specific piece of content from one 
web page inside of another one. &nbsp;This is often done using an embed code (a 
few lines of HTML and/or Javascript) that you can copy or paste. &nbsp;This is 
a common way for video content to be spread around the Internet and is 
increasingly being used for interactive components. &nbsp;A recent example is 
PBS Newshour&rsquo;s oil spill tracker widget, which was placed on many news 
sites around the country. Note: This is different from the newsroom sense of 
&ldquo;embed,&rdquo; popularized during the 2003 Iraqi invasion, which means to 
have a journalist work from within a military unit.</p> 
<p>EC2 &mdash; A computing power rental system by Amazon that has become 
popular among technology companies because it is much cheaper than maintaining 
your own computer servers. Users can host their applications on EC2 and pay 
depending on usage. EC2 is an example of cloud computing. (Also see cloud 
computing)</p> 
<p>Facebook Connect&mdash; A technology from Facebook that allows a reader to 
log into a third-party website with their Facebook account, rather than 
creating a new profile for that website. Facebook Connect, which is an API, 
also allows the third parties to pull certain data from the user&rsquo;s 
profile, such as his or her name and age. In turn, the reader&rsquo;s 
activities on the website can also be displayed on her or his Facebook profile. 
&nbsp;Launched in 2007, Facebook Connect was one of the first examples of 
Facebook extending itself into a platform for the entire Web. (Also see OAuth, 
Open ID)</p> 
<p>Facebook community page &mdash; Introduced in April 2010, community pages 
were created as a counterpart to &ldquo;official fan pages,&rdquo; which are 
built around a specific person, company, organization, product, or brand. 
&nbsp;In large part, community pages are mostly auto-generated around interests 
or affiliations found in people&rsquo;s profiles, like cooking. There is not a 
way to actively add content to the page, unlike with Facebook groups. But 
because they are autogenerated, based on likes, they can quickly build gigantic 
memberships. Cooking, for example, has over 2 million fans. &nbsp;These pages 
are a bit confusing, and Facebook is still working on the kinks.</p> 
<p>Facebook fan page &mdash; A Facebook profile for a specific person, 
product, company or organization, usually administered by official 
representatives. This is different from a Facebook personal page, which must be 
owned by an individual, and different from a Facebook community page, which is 
built around an interest not related to a brand, such as &ldquo;cooking.&rdquo; 
It is also different from a Facebook group. Fan pages can gather thousands or 
millions of fans though &ldquo;likes,&rdquo; and official posts by the page 
administrator generally go into the fans&rsquo; news streams. &nbsp;Once a page 
has more than 25 fans, it can claim a short form URL, such as 
facebook.com/nytimes or facebook.com/wikileaks. Facebook community and fan 
pages are strong players in ongoing efforts to bring content to people where 
they already are, instead of requiring them to come to the content.</p> 
<p>Facebook group &mdash; Facebook groups are analogous to offline clubs. 
Unlike Facebook fan pages, groups do not have to be administered by official 
representatives. In addition, the activity posted in groups does not get pushed 
into users&rsquo; feeds. But as long as it has fewer than 5,000 members, 
Facebook groups are allowed to mass-message all their members.</p> 
<p>Facebook personal page &mdash; A profile page tied to a single individual. 
What information is controlled (in theory) by the individual. However, because 
there is a 5,000-person limit to friends, some celebrities have fan pages 
instead. As of 2009, individuals can choose a username, which makes their page 
available at facebook.com/username.</p> 
<p>Flash &mdash; A proprietary platform owned by Adobe Systems that allows for 
drag-and-drop animations, program interactivity, and dynamic displays for the 
Web. The language used, ActionScript, is owned by Adobe; this contrasts with 
many other popular programming languages that are open source. Creators must 
use Adobe&rsquo;s Creative Suite products and web surfers must install a Flash 
plug-in for their browser. Many claim that Flash players are unstable and 
inefficient, slowing down web pages and crashing operating systems. Apple has 
not allowed Adobe to create a Flash player for the iPhone operating system, 
which has created a feud between the two companies. HTML5 is emerging as an 
open alternative to Flash.</p> 
<p>framework &mdash; A software package that makes writing programs easier by 
providing all the &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; for a particular type of task (like 
writing a web app), allowing programmers to just &ldquo;fill in the 
blanks&rdquo; with their own project-specific needs. For instance, Web 
development frameworks like Ruby on Rails (written in Ruby, meaning programmers 
use Ruby to do the &ldquo;fill in the blanks&rdquo; tasks) and Django (written 
in Python), have easy-to-use, built-in support for common web development 
tasks, such as reading and writing to a database, writing content in html, and 
so forth. &nbsp;Watch Django and Ruby creators discuss the merits of their 
frameworks on DjangoProject.com.</p> 
<p>Foursquare &mdash; One of many new mobile services, along with Gowalla, 
SCVNGR and others, that combines geolocation with game mechanics. Launched in 
2009 at SXSW Interactive conference, Foursquare allows users to &ldquo;check 
in&rdquo; at locations (bars, restaurants, playgrounds and more) to inform 
people in their social networks of their whereabouts while earning badges, 
collecting points and becoming the &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; of certain locations. 
Despite a relatively modest user base at the beginning, Foursquare quickly 
attracted a lot of attention for its potential for marketing and customer brand 
loyalty.</p> 
<p>geotag &mdash; A piece of information that goes with content and contains 
geographically based information. &nbsp;Commonly used on photo sites such as 
Flickr or in conjunction with user-generated content, to show where a photo, 
video or article came from. There has been some discussion of its increasing 
relevance with geographically connected social networking sites, such as 
Foursquare. Twitter has implemented geotagging, and Facebook has announced 
plans to do so.</p> 
<p>Google AdSense &mdash; Google&rsquo;s online advertising network that 
allows content publishers to embed a piece of code to display Google ads on 
their sites. The ads are selected based on the content of the page. Ad revenue 
is split between Google and the publisher in an undisclosed proportion, 
generally believed to be two-thirds to the publisher. (Note: ads on 
Google&rsquo;s own sites are covered by Google AdWords, not AdSense.)</p> 
<p>Google AdWords &nbsp;&mdash; Google&rsquo;s text-based flagship advertising 
product, which provides the lion&rsquo;s share of the company revenue. Ads are 
displayed on Google&rsquo;s own sites based on search terms that users type in, 
and advertisers pay only when the users click on them. The search terms, called 
keywords, are purchased by advertisers; availability of a given keyword is 
based in part on an auction system, and in part on the responsiveness of the 
audience.</p> 
<p>Google Buzz &mdash; Launched in February 2010, Buzz is Google&rsquo;s 
attempt to counter Twitter and Facebook by leveraging the social graphs from 
users&rsquo; e-mail accounts. A more sophisticated version of Gmail 
&ldquo;status updates,&rdquo; Buzz allows users to post updates about what they 
are doing, link to what they are reading and post their current locations. The 
service can integrate with other Google services, as well as feed into Twitter. 
&nbsp;Despite an initial burst of publicity, Google Buzz has not gained 
tremendous traction. It attracted criticism when Google automatically and 
publicly connected users with people they had e-mailed most often in the past, 
making private information unexpectedly available. Google released enhanced 
privacy controls after the controversy.</p> 
<p>Google Docs &mdash; A free online service offered by Google, comprising 
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and other software, all of which is 
&ldquo;in the cloud.&rdquo; Users can work collaboratively on documents, 
editing them simultaneously. The service is increasingly being seen as eroding 
Microsoft Office&rsquo;s market share. The glossary you&rsquo;re reading right 
now was collaboratively created in Google Docs.</p> 
<p>Google Wave &mdash; An online collaborative space introduced by Google in 
which people can communicate and work together in real time; it resembles a 
&ldquo;souped up Instant Messenger.&rdquo; Participants can add rich text, 
images, attachments, videos and maps to create a multimedia collaboration. A 
playback option allows new users to get up to speed on projects and creates an 
environment that is both real-time and asynchronous. Despite a massive amount 
of attention, Google Wave has not gotten much traction. It is, as some people 
have said, &ldquo;a technological solution in search of a problem.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) &mdash; The dominant formatting language 
used on the World Wide Web to publish text, images and other elements. Invented 
by Tim Berners Lee in the early 1990s, HTML uses pairs of opening and closing 
tags (also known as elements), such as &lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt;; each 
pair assigns meaning to the text that appears between them. HTML can be 
considered code, but it is not a programming language; it&rsquo;s a markup 
language, which is a separate beast. The latest standard of HTML is HTML5, 
which adds powerful interactive functionality.</p> 
<p>HTML5 &mdash; The upcoming, powerful standard of Hypertext Markup Language, 
which has added advanced interactive features, such as allowing video to be 
embedded on a web page. It is gaining in popularity compared to proprietary 
standards, like Adobe Flash, because it is an open standard and does not 
require third-party plugins. Using HTML5 will allow web pages to work more like 
desktop applications. The latest releases of most browsers support HTML5 to 
varying degrees. &nbsp;HTML5 does not cover CSS and JavaScript, but often when 
people refer to HTML5, they often are using it as a blanket term, applying not 
only to changes to the HTML, but also to changes in CSS and JavaScript.</p> 
<p>iframe &mdash; An HTML tag that allows for one web page to be wholly 
included inside another; it is a popular way to create embeddable interactive 
features. &nbsp;Iframes are usually constructed via JavaScript as a way around 
web browsers&rsquo; security features, which try to prevent JavaScript on one 
page from quickly talking to JavaScript on an external page. Many security 
breaches have been designed using iframes.</p> 
<p>iPad &mdash; Released in April 2010, the iPad is Apple&rsquo;s tablet 
computing device, akin to a large iPod Touch; it uses the same operating system 
and development tools as the iPhone. It features a multitouch screen and comes 
in 3G and wifi versions. Some news organizations, including The New York Times, 
Wired and National Geographic, have created special applications designed for 
the iPad. Some have hoped that it would be the &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; tablet that 
would breathe new life into legacy print publications. Upon its announcement in 
January 2010, many noted its name was reminiscent of feminine hygiene products.
</p> 
<p>iPhone &mdash; Apple&rsquo;s smart phone has sold more than 50 million 
units worldwide since it launched in 2007. The first smartphone to introduce 
multitouch screen capability, it is considered in the same vertical as the 
Blackberry, Google&rsquo;s Android and Palm Pre. The critical mass of iPhones, 
along with Apple&rsquo;s pre-existing iTunes infrastructure, allowed Apple to 
launch the first truly robust marketplace for mobile applications, creating a 
whole new microeconomy for innovation.</p> 
<p>iPod Touch &mdash; Essentially an iPhone without the phone. Slimmer than 
the iPhone, the iPod touch can play music and run iPhone apps. It connects to 
the Internet via wifi.</p> 
<p>JavaScript &mdash; A Web scripting language used to enhance websites; it 
can make them more interactive without requiring a browser plugin. JavaScript 
is interpreted by your browser instead of by a web server, otherwise known as a 
client-side scripting language. JavaScript files generally end in .js. Despite 
its name, it is not related to the Java language.</p> 
<p>Joomla &mdash; A free, open-source content management built in PHP. It is 
more powerful than WordPress but not as powerful as Drupal. However it is known 
for its extensive design options. The name Joomla means &ldquo;all 
together&rdquo; in Swahili.</p> 
<p>jQuery &mdash; A incredibly popular open source JavaScript library designed 
for manipulating HTML pages and handling events. &nbsp;Released in 2006, jQuery 
quickly gained widespread adoption because of its efficiency and elegance. The 
definitive feature of jQuery is its support for &ldquo;chaining&rdquo; 
operations together to simplify otherwise complicated tasks. It is the most 
popular JavaScript library.</p> 
<p>JSON (JavaScript Object-Notation) &mdash; A Web data publishing format that 
is designed to be both easily human &mdash; and machine &mdash; readable. It is 
an alternative to XML that is more concise because, unlike XML, it is not a 
markup language that requires open and close tags.</p> 
<p>Key/value store &mdash; A simpler way of storing data than a relational or 
document database. Key-value stores have a simple structure, matching values to 
accessible &ldquo;keys,&rdquo; or indices. In Web development, key/value stores 
are often (though not always) used for optimization.</p> 
<p>LAMP &mdash; &nbsp;An acronym referring to a bundle of free open-source Web 
technologies that have become incredibly popular as a method for building 
websites. The letters stand for the Linux operating system, Apache web server, 
MySQL database, and either PHP, Perl or Python. This is often referred to as a 
&ldquo;LAMP stack.&rdquo; A rival alternative would be a bundle of Microsoft 
products. Serverwatch.com has a good explanation.</p> 
<p>legacy media &mdash; An umbrella term to describe the centralized media 
institutions that were dominant during the second half of the 20th century, 
including &mdash; but not limited to &mdash; television, radio, newspapers and 
magazines, all which generally had a uni-directional distribution model. 
Sometimes &ldquo;legacy media&rdquo; is used interchangeably with 
&ldquo;MSM,&rdquo; for &ldquo;Mainstream Media.&rdquo; Legacy media sits in 
contrast with social media, where the production and sharing is of equal weight 
to the consumption.</p> 
<p>library &mdash; In the context of programming, this contains code that can 
be accessed for software and Web development, enabling one to perform common 
tasks without writing new code every time. Many libraries are freely shared. 
One well-known library is jQuery, released in 2006 and now the most popular 
JavaScript library, which boasts that it allows coders to &ldquo;write less, do 
more.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>location-based services &mdash; A service, usually in a mobile Web or 
mobile device application, that uses your location in order to perform a 
certain task, such as finding nearby restaurants, giving you directions, or 
locating your friends. Foursquare and Gowalla are location-based services.</p> 
<p>mashup &mdash; A combination of data from multiple sources, usually through 
the use of APIs. An example of a mashup would be an app that shows the 
locations of all the movie theaters in a particular town on a Google map. It is 
mashing up one data source (the addresses of movie theaters) with another data 
source (the geographic location of those addresses on a map).</p> 
<p>metadata &mdash; Data about data. Examples of metadata include descriptors 
indicating when information was created, by whom and in what format. Metadata 
helps to organize information online and make it machine-readable. HTML is an 
example of metadata &mdash; it organizes the data in a web page so browsers can 
display it sensibly. Web pages often have hidden metadata that helps with their 
search engine ranks. Photos uploaded to Flickr carry metadata such as time 
taken, camera model and shutter speed. &nbsp;MP3s have metadata such as the 
artist name, track title, album name and so on.</p> 
<p>Microsoft Silverlight &mdash; Microsoft&rsquo;s answer to Adobe Flash, 
allowing the integration of multimedia, graphics, animations, and interactivity 
into web pages. It was initially released in 2007 and is occasionally spotted 
on the web.</p> 
<p>mobile &mdash; An umbrella term in technology that was long synonymous with 
cellular phones but has since grown to encompass tablet computing (the iPad) 
and even netbooks. In retrospect, an early mobile technology was the pager. 
Sometimes the term is used interchangeably with &ldquo;wireless.&rdquo; It 
generally refers to untethered computing devices that can access the Internet 
over radiofrequency waves, though sometimes also via wi-fi. Mobile technology 
usually demands a different set of standards &mdash; design and otherwise 
&mdash; than desktop computers, and has opened up an entirely new area for 
geo-aware applications.</p> 
<p>MySQL &mdash; The dominant open-source database management system on the 
Internet. It is popular because it is a free and flexible alternative to 
expensive systems like Oracle. Projects that use MySQL include Facebook and 
Wikipedia. The SQL stands for &ldquo;Structured Query Language&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;My&rdquo; is the name of the inventor&rsquo;s daughter. It is officially 
pronounced My-S-Q-L, but you will often hear it referred to as &ldquo;My 
Sequel.&rdquo; MySQL is a relational database management system, not a 
document-oriented database system. (Also see document-oriented database)</p> 
<p>OAuth &mdash; A new method that allows users to share information stored on 
one site with another site. For example, some web-based Twitter clients will 
use OAuth to connect to your account, instead of requiring you to provide your 
password directly to that third-party site. It is similar to Facebook Connect. 
This allows sites to validate users&rsquo; identities without having full 
access to their personal accounts.</p> 
<p>ontology &mdash; &nbsp;A classification system with nodes or entities, that 
allows non-hierarchical relationships, in contrast to a taxonomy, which is 
hierarchical. Taxonomies and ontologies are important in content to help 
related articles or topics pages. (Also see taxonomy)</p> 
<p>Open ID &mdash; An open standard that lets users log in to multiple web 
sites using the same identity through a third party. It is supported by 
numerous sites, including LiveJournal, Yahoo!, and WordPress. While Open ID has 
seen adoption among technical communities, its authentication method is not 
particularly intuitive, and it has not gained wide consumer acceptance.</p> 
<p>open source &mdash; Open source refers to a philosophy and a means of 
developing and licensing software and other copyrighted works so that others 
are free to inspect, use and adapt the original source material. There are many 
open source licenses. Some licenses are considered permissive (e.g. MIT and 
BSD), allowing inclusion in proprietary works, while others (e.g. GNU GPL) 
require that the resulting derivative works remain under the same license if 
distributed. While the term originally stemmed from software practices, the 
concept has now been incorporated into other fields such as medicine and 
agriculture. Many of the most popular technologies used in content 
distribution, including languages and publishing platforms, are open source. 
The glossary you are reading was developed using open source methodology and is 
available under a Creative Commons license.</p> 
<p>operating system &mdash; A basic layer of software that controls computer 
hardware, allowing other applications to be built on it. &nbsp;The most popular 
operating systems today for desktop computers are the various versions of 
Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and the open-source Linux. &nbsp;Smart phones also 
have operating systems. The Palm Pre uses webOS, numerous phones use 
Google&rsquo;s Android operating system, and the iPhone uses iOS (formerly 
known as iPhone OS).</p> 
<p>Palm Pre &mdash; A smart phone introduced in 2009 by Palm which uses webOS 
and allows for multitasking, unlike the iPhone. Despite rave reviews, the 
product is generally acknowledged to have come out too late to gain meaningful 
traction against the iPhone or Google&rsquo;s Android operating system. 
&nbsp;HP recently announced that it would acquire Palm, which was once the 
leading smart phone company.</p> 
<p>peer-to-peer (P2P) &nbsp;&mdash; A network architecture in which users 
share resources on their own computers directly with others. Often used to 
speed up videos and large multimedia pieces that can take a long time to 
download. Napster was an early example of a popular use of peer-to-peer 
architecture, although it was not fully peer-to-peer. Today, Skype and 
BitTorrent are based on peer-to-peer technologies.</p> 
<p>Perl &mdash; A dynamic language that is often used to parse and sort 
information because of its powerful abilities in manipulating text. Perl can be 
used to pull large quantities of data down from websites and standardize and 
replace information in batch. Perl was more popular in past years, especially 
in the computer-assisted reporting community, but it has been overtaken in 
popularity by languages such as Python and Ruby. Perl still has an active 
development community and is noted for the scope of its freely available 
libraries, which simplify development.</p> 
<p>PHP &mdash; A popular web scripting language to generate web pages that was 
first developed in 1995, when it stood for &ldquo;Personal Home Page.&rdquo; 
(It is now a recursive acronym, standing for &ldquo;PHP: Hypertext 
Preprocessor.&rdquo;) Popular websites that are written in PHP are Wikipedia, 
Facebook and WordPress. It is criticized as being slow because it generates web 
pages on request. However, Facebook recently released its internally developed 
version of HipHop for PHP, which is designed to make the language dramatically 
more efficient.</p> 
<p>platform &mdash; In the technology world, platform refers to the hardware 
or software that other applications are built upon. &nbsp;Computing platforms 
include Windows PC and Macintosh. Mobile platforms include Android, iPhone and 
Palm&rsquo;s webOS. More recently, in an extension of its commonly used 
definition, Facebook has created a &ldquo;platform,&rdquo; allowing developers 
to build applications on top of it.</p> 
<p>Posterous &mdash; A blogging and publishing platform to which users can 
submit via e-mail. Through APIs, it can push the content to other sites such as 
Flickr, Twitter and YouTube. It is a for-profit company based in San Francisco 
that came out of the YCombinator seed start-up program.</p> 
<p>PostgreSQL &ndash; An alternative to MySQL, another free and open-source 
relational database management system on the Internet. PostgreSQL is preferred 
by some in the technology community for its ability to operate as a spatial 
database, using PostGIS extensions. This enables developers to create 
applications that sort information based on geography, which can mean sorting 
by whether various places are within a certain county or pointing out the 
places that are geographically closest to the user.</p> 
<p>programming language &mdash; A special type of language used to 
unambiguously instruct a computer how to perform tasks. Programming languages 
are used by software developers to create applications, including those for the 
web, for mobile phones, and for desktop operating systems. C, C++, Objective C, 
Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby are examples of programming 
languages. HTML and XML are not programming languages, they are markup 
languages.</p> 
<p>Python &mdash; A sophisticated computer language that is commonly used for 
Internet applications. Designed to be a very readable language, it is named 
after Monty Python. It first appeared in 1991 and was originally created by 
Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer programmer who now works at Google. Python 
files generally end in .py.</p> 
<p>relational database &mdash; A piece of software that stores data in a 
series of tables, with relationships defined between them. A news story might 
have columns for a headline, date, text and author, where author points to 
another table containing the author&rsquo;s first name, last name and email 
address. Information must be structured, but this allows for powerful queries. 
Examples include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLite. Most modern websites use 
some kind of relational database to store content.</p> 
<p>RSS (Really Simple Syndication) &mdash; A standard for websites to push 
their content to readers through Web formats to create regular updates through 
a &ldquo;feed reader&rdquo; or &ldquo;RSS Reader.&rdquo; The symbol is 
generally a orange square with radiating white quarter circles. (Also see Atom)
</p> 
<p>Ruby &mdash; An increasingly popular programming language known for being 
powerful yet easy to write with. Originally introduced in 1995 by Yukihiro 
&ldquo;Matz&rdquo; Matsumoto, Ruby has gained increasing traction since 2005 
because of the Ruby on Rails development framework, which can create websites 
quickly. Ruby is open source and is very popular for content-based sites.</p> 
<p>Ruby on Rails &mdash; A popular Web framework based on the Ruby programming 
language that makes common development tasks easier &ldquo;out of the 
box.&rdquo; The power of Ruby on Rails, which was developed by the 
Chicago-based firm 37 Signals, comes from how quickly it can be used to create 
a basic website.</p> 
<p>S3 &mdash; An online storage system run by Amazon that&rsquo;s often used 
as a cheap way to store (and serve) photos and videos used on websites. It is 
short for Simple Storage Service. Its fees are often pennies per month per 
gigabyte, depending on location and bulk discount. The service is often used in 
conjunction with other Amazon Web Services, such as EC2, to allow customers to 
process large amounts of data with low capital investment. The New York Times 
used S3 with EC2 in this way to process its archives.</p> 
<p>SaaS (Software as a Service) &mdash; &nbsp;A pricing strategy and business 
model, where companies build a software solution, usually business-to-business, 
and charge a fixed monthly rate to access it on the Internet. It is a type of 
cloud computing. Salesforce.com is the best example, but other notables include 
Mailchimp and even Amazon Web Services.</p> 
<p>Scribd &mdash; A document-sharing site that is often described as a 
&ldquo;YouTube for documents&rdquo; because it allows other sites to embed its 
content. It allows people to upload files and others to download in various 
formats. Recently Scribd, which is based in San Francisco, moved from 
Flash-based technology to HTML5 standards.</p> 
<p>scripting language &mdash; A programming language designed to be easy to 
use for everyday or administrative tasks. It may involve trade-offs such as 
sacrificing some performance for ease of programming. Popular scripting 
languages include PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby.</p> 
<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) &nbsp;&mdash; A suite of techniques for 
improving how a website ranks on search engines such as Google. SEO is often 
divided into &ldquo;white hat&rdquo; techniques, which (to simplify) try to 
boost ranking by improving the quality of a website, and &ldquo;black 
hat&rdquo; techniques, which try to trick search engines into thinking a page 
is of higher quality than it actually is. SEO can also refer to individuals and 
companies that offer to provide search engine optimization for websites.</p> 
<p>SEM (Search Engine Marketing) &mdash; A type of marketing that involves 
raising a company or product&rsquo;s visibility in search engines by paying to 
have it appear in search results for a given word.</p> 
<p>semantic web &mdash; A vision of the web that is almost entirely machine 
readable, in which documents are published in languages that are designed 
specifically for data. It was first articulated by Tim Berners-Lee in 2001. In 
many implementations, tags would identify the information, such as 
&lt;ADDRESS&gt; or &lt;DATE&gt;. While there has been progress toward this 
front, many say this vision remains largely unrealized.</p> 
<p>server-side &mdash; Referring to when network software runs in a central 
location, the server, rather than on the user&rsquo;s computer, often known as 
the client. (Also see client side).</p> 
<p>Sinatra &nbsp;- A lightweight framework written in Ruby that can be used to 
set up web services, APIs and small sites at lightning speed.</p> 
<p>social graph &mdash; A mapping of the connections between people and the 
things they care about that could provide useful insights. The term originally 
promoted by Facebook and is now gaining broader usage.</p> 
<p>social media &nbsp;&mdash; &nbsp;A broad term referring to the wide swath 
of content creation and consumption that is enabled by the many-to-many 
distributed infrastructure of the Internet. Unlike legacy media, where the 
audience is usually on the receiving end of content creation, social media 
generally allows three stages of interaction with content: 1) producing, 2) 
consuming and 3) sharing. Social media is incredibly broad and refers to 
blogging, wikis, video-sharing sites like YouTube, photo-sharing sites like 
Flickr and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.</p> 
<p>structured thesaurus &mdash; &nbsp;A group of preferred terms created for 
editorial use to normalize and more effectively classify content. For example, 
the AP Stylebook is similar to (but includes more rules than) a structured 
thesaurus in that it gives writers preferred terms to use and standards to 
follow, so everyone following AP Style writes the word &ldquo;website&rdquo; 
the same way.</p> 
<p>tag &mdash; A common type of metadata used to describe a piece of content 
that associates it with other content that has the same tag. &nbsp;Tags can be 
specific terms, people, locations, etc. used in the content it is describing, 
or more general terms that may not be explicitly stated, such as themes. The 
term &ldquo;tag&rdquo; is also used in the context of markup languages, such as 
&lt;title&gt; identifying the name of the web page. In HTML, tags usually come 
in sets of open and closed, with the closed tag containing an extra slash 
(&ldquo;/&rdquo;) inside. For example: &lt;title&gt;This is the 
Title.&lt;/title&gt;.</p> 
<p>taxonomy &mdash; A hierarchical classification system. In the world of 
content, this can be a hierarchy of terms (generally called nodes or entities) 
that are used to classify the category or subject content belongs to as well as 
terms that are included in the content. In many cases, website navigation 
systems appear taxonomical in that users narrow down from broad top-level 
categories to the granular feature they want to see. An ontology is similar to 
a taxonomy in that it is also a classification system with nodes or entities, 
but it is more complex and flexible because ontologies allow for 
non-hierarchical relationships. While in a taxonomy a node can be either a 
broader term or narrower term, in an ontology nodes can be related in any way.
</p> 
<p>Tumblr &mdash; A free short-form blogging platform that allows users to 
post images, video, links, quotes and audio. The company is based in New York 
City and competes with Posterous.</p> 
<p>transparency &mdash; In the context of news and information, a term 
describing openness about information that has become increasingly popular. 
&nbsp;In many cases it is used to refer to the transparency of government 
releasing data to journalists and to the public. It is often used in the 
context of journalists being open about their reporting process and material by 
sharing with their readers before the final project emerges or providing more 
context in addition to the final product.</p> 
<p>Twitter &mdash; A microblogging and social media service where users can 
send out messages limited to 14o characters. Launched in 2007, Twitter became 
popular in part because it had a set of APIs that allowed other developers to 
build tools on top if it. Twitter users came up with their own conventions, 
including the @ symbol to denote user names (@nytimes), and #, the hashtag, to 
denote subjects (#sxsw). Twitter computes Trending Topics, which give a 
real-time view into the most talked about topics on the service.</p> 
<p>UI (User Interface) &mdash; The part of a software application or website 
that users see and interact with, which takes into account the visual design 
and the structure of the program. While graphic design is an element of user 
interface design, it is only a portion of the consideration.</p> 
<p>URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) &mdash; The way to identify the location 
for something on the Internet. It is most familiarly in &ldquo;http:&rdquo; 
form, but also encompasses &ldquo;ftp:&rdquo; or &ldquo;mailto:&rdquo;</p> 
<p>URL (Uniform Resource Locator) &mdash; Often used interchangeably with the 
&ldquo;address&rdquo; of a web page, such as http://hackshackers.com. All URLs 
are URIs, but not vice versa. While humans are familar with URLs as a way to 
see web pages, computer programs often use URLs to pass each other 
machine-readable content, such as RSS feeds or Twitter information. In 
addition, words that appear in URLs often help boost search rankings, which is 
why many content sites are now shifting to URLs with headlines as opposed to 
data strings.</p> 
<p>UX (User Experience) &mdash; Generally referring to the area of design that 
involves the holistic interaction a user has with a product or a service. It 
incorporates many disciplines, including engineering, graphic design, content 
creation and psychology. User interface is one element of user experience.</p> 
<p>Web 2.0 &mdash; Referring to the generation of Internet technologies that 
allow for interactivity and collaboration on websites. In contrast to Web 1.0 
(roughly the first decade of the World Wide Web) where static content was 
downloaded into the browser and read, Web 2.0 uses the Internet as the 
platform. Technologies such as Ajax, which allow for rapid communication 
between the browser and the web server, underlie many Web 2.0 sites. The term 
was popularized by a 2004 conference, held by O&rsquo;Reilly Media and 
MediaLive, called Web 2.0. (Also see Ajax)</p> 
<p>Web 3.0 &mdash; Sometimes used to refer to the semantic web. (Also see 
semantic web)</p> 
<p>webOS &mdash; Operating system used on the latest generation of Palm smart 
phones, including the Pre and the Pixi. Apps for webOS are developed using web 
standards (HTML, Javascript and CSS), which means there is a low barrier to 
entry for web developers to create mobile apps for webOS as compared to other 
mobile platforms. It allows for having several applications open at the same 
time, unlike the current iPhone.</p> 
<p>widget &mdash; In a web context, this refers to a portable application that 
can be embedded into a third-party site by cutting and pasting snippets of 
code. Common web widgets include a Twitter box that can sit on a blog, or a 
small Google Map that sits within an invitation. Desktop widgets, such as ones 
offered for the Macintosh Dashboard or by Yahoo!, can be placed on the desktop 
of a computer, such as for weather or stocks. Similarly, Android offers the 
ability to add widgets to the home screens.</p> 
<p>wiki &mdash; A web site with pages that can be easily edited by visitors 
using their web browser, but generally now gaining acceptance as a prefix to 
mean &ldquo;collaborative.&rdquo; Ward Cunningham created the first wiki, 
naming it WikiWikiWeb after the Hawaiian word for &ldquo;quick.&rdquo; A wiki 
enables the audience to contribute to a knowledge base on a topic or share 
information within an organization, like a newsroom. The best-known wiki in 
existence is Wikipedia, which burst onto the scene around 2000 as one of the 
first examples of mass collaborative information aggregation. Other sites that 
have been branded &ldquo;wiki&rdquo; include Wikinews, Wikitravel, and 
WikiLeaks (which was originally but is no longer a wiki).</p> 
<p>WordPress &mdash; The most popular blogging software in use today, in large 
part because it is free and relatively powerful, yet easy to use. First 
released by Matt Mullenweg in 2003, WordPress attracts contributions from a 
large community of programmers and designers who give it additional 
functionality and visual themes. Sites that use WordPress include the New York 
Times blogs, CNN and the LOLCats network. It has been criticized for security 
flaws.</p> 
<p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) &mdash;A set of rules for encoding 
documents and data that goes beyond HTML capacities. Whereas HTML is generally 
concerned with the semantic structure of documents, XML allows other 
information to be defined and passed such as &lt;vehicle&gt;, &lt;make&gt;, 
&lt;model&gt;, &lt;year&gt;, &lt;color&gt; for a car. It is the parent language 
of many XML-based languages such as RSS, Atom, and others. It gained further 
popularity with the emergence of Ajax as a way to send back data from web 
services, but has since lost ground to JSON, another data encoding format, 
which is seen as easier to work with.</p> 
<p>Yahoo! Pipes &mdash; An online service from Yahoo! that provides a 
drag-and-drop visual interface to create interesting combinations of data. 
&nbsp;This is stuff you would otherwise need to know how to program to do. 
Instead, inputs, operators and chunks of logic are represented visually &mdash; 
as consoles connected by pipes &mdash; with information flowing from sources to 
output. It can import and out put in almost any common data format, including 
RSS, CSV, and JSON. Yahoo Pipes is an excellent resources for tech-minded, 
non-programming journalists.</p> 
<p>________________________</p> 
<p>Now More Context!</p> 
<p>We relate the different terms to each other and make sense of the whole 
thing.</p> 
<p>- Ruby, PHP and Python are all scripting languages that are commonly used 
in website development. PHP is used in WordPress and Drupal. Ruby is the basis
</p> 
<p>for Ruby on Rails, a web framework. Python is the basis for Django.</p> 
<p>- Ruby on Rails and Django are similar and often considered rival systems 
because they both use a &ldquo;Model, View, Controller&rdquo; architecture. 
This means they are designed to separate the data (model) from the analysis of 
the data (controller) and its presentation to the user (view). Typically the 
model is stored in a database, the view is stored in html templates, and the 
controller is implemented directly in the underlying programming language (Ruby 
for Ruby on Rails, Python for Django).</p> 
<p>- XML and JSON are different ways of &nbsp;interchanging information. JSON 
is considered the better data exchange format whereas XML is considered a 
better document exchange format.</p> 
<p>- WordPress, Joomla and Drupal (listed in increasingly levels of 
complexity) are all content management systems written in PHP.</p> 
<p>- HTML5, which allows for more sophisticated use of graphics and videos in 
web pages, &nbsp;is considered an open standards rival to Flash, which is 
proprietary technology developed by Adobe Systems. Microsoft Silverlight is 
also a rival to Flash, but don&rsquo;t worry if you have never heard of it.</p> 
<p>- Facebook Connect, OAuth, and OpenID are different ways that users can use 
one account&rsquo;s information to log onto another website without having to 
create a new username and password.</p>
