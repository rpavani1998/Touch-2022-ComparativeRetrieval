<p>I&rsquo;ve been really positive about Cloud Foundry, seeing it as doing the 
sort of things for PaaS thatOpenStack does for IaaS. If Cloud Foundry succeeds 
in its aim, Organizations will have a PaaS solution that they can use where 
they want, with whichever cloud provider they want and with many different 
languages and frameworks.</p> 
<p>Anyway, Stackato is an infrastructure-agnostic PaaS built on top of Cloud 
Foundry. It extends Cloud Foundry and enables a private PaaS forPython, Java, 
Ruby,PHP, Perl, and Node.js applications. As a solution for organizations 
worried about data in the public cloud, Stackato enables customers to deploy an 
application to either a full public or a private internal cloud</p> 
<p>Focusing on the private arena means that Stackato needs to provide some 
functionality that is important to enterprise users and in line with this, they 
are today rolling out some additions to he product;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>New Admin Dashboard: The Stackato Admin Dashboard now offers visibility 
into the activity and events in a private cloud to help administrators better 
manage usage</li> 
<li>Application Monitoring with New Relic integration: Earlier this year, 
ActiveState announced its partnership with New Relic to provide real-time 
application monitoring. New Relic Standard Edition is now integrated with 
Stackato for Java, PHP, Python and Ruby applications and is included in 
Stackato&rsquo;s standard pricing</li> 
<li>Improvements in Java deployment to Stackato from Spring Tool Suite (STS) 
and Eclipse: ActiveState enables Java developers to use their existing desktop 
development environments to deploy directly from their desktop to the cloud.
</li> </ul> 
<p>The offering is now out of private beta and is fully open to any cloud/IT 
administrators or developers that want to try or test a private PaaS.</p> 
<p>Many of us have long said that PaaS holds the future of cloud services 
&ndash; given that large enterprises are till reluctant to move stuff en masse 
to the public cloud, offering such as Stackato will help broaden the appeal and 
usage of PaaS. the functionality they&rsquo;re rolling out today will help 
allay the concerns and fears of potential users.</p> References
