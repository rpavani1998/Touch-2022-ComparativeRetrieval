<p>Algorithms always depend on the input. We saw that general purpose sorting 
algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort andquicksort can be very efficient 
in some cases and inefficient in others. Indeed,insertion and bubble sort are 
considered slow, with a best-case complexity of O(n2), but they are quite 
effective when the input is fairly sorted. So, when you have a sorted array and 
you add some &ldquo;new&rdquo; values to the array you can sort it quite 
effectively with insertion sort. On the other hand, quicksort is considered one 
of the best general purpose sorting algorithms, but while it&rsquo;s a great 
algorithm when the data is randomized, it&rsquo;s practically as slow as bubble 
sort when the input is almost or fully sorted.</p> 
<p>Now we see that the effectiveness of algorithms depends greatly on the 
input. For input that is almost sorted, insertion sort may be preferred instead 
of quicksort, which is generally a faster algorithm.</p> 
<p>Because the input is so important for an algorithm's efficiency, we may ask 
if there are any sorting algorithms that are faster than O(n.log(n)), which is 
the average-case complexity for merge sort and quicksort. And the answer is yes 
there are faster, linear complexity algorithms, that can sort data faster than 
quicksort, merge sort and heapsort. But there are some constraints!</p> 
<p>Everything sounds great but we can&rsquo;t sort any particular data with 
linear complexity, so the question is what rules must the input follow in order 
to be sorted in linear time?</p> 
<p>Such an algorithm that is capable of sorting data in linear O(n) time is 
radix sort and the domain of the input is restricted &ndash; it must consist 
only of integers.</p> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have an array of integers which is not sorted. Because 
it consists only of integers and because array keys are integers in programming 
languages we can implement radix sort.</p> 
<p>First for each value of the input array we put the value of &ldquo;1&rdquo; 
on the key-th place of the temporary array as explained on the following 
diagram.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 If there are repeating values in the 
input array, we increment the corresponding value in the temporary array. After 
&ldquo;initializing&rdquo; the temporary array with one pass (with linear 
complexity) we can sort the input.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h2>Implementation</h2> 
<p>Implementing radix sort is in fact very easy, which is great. The thing is 
that old-school programming languages weren&rsquo;t very flexible and we needed 
to initialize the entire temporary array. That leads to another problem &ndash; 
we must know the interval of values from the input. Fortunately, modern 
programming languages and libraries are more flexible so we can initialize our 
temporary array even if we don&rsquo;t know the interval of input values, as in 
the example bellow. Indeed, PHP is flexible enough to build-up arrays in the 
memory without knowing their size in advance.</p> 
<pre>$list = array(4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5); function radix_sort($input) 
{ $temp = $output = array(); $len = count($input); for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $len; 
$i++) { $temp[$input[$i]] = ($temp[$input[$i]] &gt; 0) ? ++$temp[$input[$i]] : 
1; } ksort($temp); foreach ($temp as $key =&gt; $val) { if ($val == 1) { 
$output[] = $key; } else { while ($val--) { $output[] = $key; } } } return 
$output; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 9 print_r(radix_sort($list));</pre>The 
problem is that PHP needs ksort &ndash; which is completely foolish as 
we&rsquo;re trying to sort an array using &ldquo;another&rdquo; sorting method, 
but to overcome this you must know the interval of values in advance and 
initialize a temporary array with 0s, as in the example bellow.<br>

<pre>define(MIN, 1); define(MAX, 9); $list = array(4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6, 
5); function radix_sort(&amp;$input) { $temp = array(); $len = count($input); 
// initialize with 0s $temp = array_fill(MIN, MAX-MIN+1, 0); foreach ($input as 
$key =&gt; $val) { $temp[$val]++; } $input = array(); foreach ($temp as $key 
=&gt; $val) { if ($val == 1) { $input[] = $key; } else { while ($val--) { 
$input[] = $key; } } } } // 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5 var_dump($list); 
radix_sort(&amp;$list); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 var_dump($list);</pre>
Here the input is modified during the sorting process and it&rsquo;s used as a 
result.
<h2>Complexity</h2> 
<p>The complexity of radix sort is linear, which in terms of omega means O(n). 
That is a great benefit in performance compared to O(n.log(n)) or even worse 
with O(n2) as we can see in the following chart.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h2>Why Use Radix Sort</h2> 
<h3><br>
1. It&rsquo;s fast</h3> 
<p>Radix sort is very fast compared to other sorting algorithms as we saw on 
the diagram above. This algorithm is very useful in practice because in 
practice we often sort sets of integers.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h3>2. It&rsquo;s easy to understand and implement</h3> 
<p>Even a beginner can understand and implement radix sort, which is great. 
You need no more than a few loops to implement it.</p> 
<h2>Why NOT using radix sort</h2> 
<h3><br>
1. Works only with integers</h3> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure about the input, you're better off not using radix 
sort. We may think that our input consists only of integers and we can go for 
radix sort, but what if in the future someone passes floats or strings to our 
routine.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h3>2. Requires additional space</h3> 
<p>Radix sort needs additional space &ndash; at least as much as the input.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2> 
<p>Radix sort is restricted by the input&rsquo;s domain, but I must say that 
in practice there are tons of cases where only integers are sorted. This is 
when we get some data from the db based on primary keys &ndash; typically 
primary in database tables are integers as well. So practically there are lots 
of cases of sorting integers, so radix sort may be one very, very useful 
algorithm and it is so cool that it is also easy to implement.</p>  Tags:
