<h3>  PyCon 2011: web2py secrets tutorial (1/2) </h3> 
<p>web2py secrets</p> 
<p>Presented by Massimo Di Pierro</p> 
<p> We will provide an introduction to web2py with particular focus on its 
design objectives, its differences when compared to other web frameworks, and 
some of the most recently added features (components, plugins, openid/oauth 
integration).</p> 
<p>Abstract</p> 
<p> Web2py is a framework for rapid web application development of secure 
database-driven web applications. In this tutorial we will provide a brief 
introduction to web2py, the web based IDE, its internal design, and its 
internal file organization. We will explain the motivations behind some of its 
most controversial design goals. We will also discuss in some detail its Ajax 
capabilities by using web2py components and plugins for modular design of rich 
web interfaces.</p> 
<p> This will be a very concentrated version (10%) of a course (CSC438) on web 
frameworks the author teaches at DePaul University. The course has been taught 
3 times and the last time counted more than 30 students.</p> <br>

<h3>  PyCon 2010: Scrape the Web: Strategies for programming websites that 
don't expected it </h3>  Scrape the Web: Strategies for programming websites 
that don't expect it<br>
<br>
 Presented by Asheesh Laroia <br>
<br>
 Do you 
find yourself faced with websites that have data you need to extract? Would 
your life be simpler if you could programmatically input data into web 
applications, even those tuned to resist interaction by bots?<br>
<br>
 Year by 
year, the web is becoming a stronger force. Learn how to get the best of it.<br>
<br> We'll discuss the basics of web scraping, and then dive into the details 
of different methods and where they are most applicable. You'll leave with an 
understanding of when to apply different tools, and learn about automating a 
full web browser, a &quot;heavy hammer&quot; that I picked up at a project for 
the Electronic Frontier Foundation.<br>
<br>
 Atendees should bring a laptop, 
if possible, to try the examples we discuss and optionally take notes. Code 
samples will be made available after class with no restrictions. Intended 
Audience<br>
<br>
 Intermediate (or better) Python programmers, probably 
without extensive web testing experience<br>
<br>
 Class Outline My motto: 
&quot;The website is the API.&quot; Choosing a parser: BeautifulSoup, lxml, 
HTMLParse, and html5lib. Extracting information, even in the face of bad HTML: 
Regular expressions, BeautifulSoup, SAX, and XPath. Automatic template 
reverse-engineering tools. Submitting to forms. Playing with XML-RPC DO NOT 
BECOME AN EVIL COMMENT SPAMMER. Countermeasures, and circumventing them: IP 
address limits Hidden form fields User-agent detection JavaScript CAPTCHAs 
Plenty of full source code to working examples: Submitting to forms for 
text-to-speech. Downloading music from web stores. Automating Firefox with 
Selenium RC to navigate a pure-JavaScript service. Q&amp;A; and workshopping 
Use your power for good, not evil. <br>

<h3>  PyCon 2011: State of Pylons/TurboGears 2/repoze.bfg </h3> 
<p>State of Pylons/TurboGears 2/repoze.bfg</p> 
<p>Presented by Chris McDonough, Ben Bangert, and Mark Ramm</p> 
<p> A three-for-one talk by the main developers of three popular Python web 
frameworks! We'll (very) briefly cover the state of each of our individual 
frameworks and communities, and then we'll describe the results of our efforts 
to work together and share code.</p> 
<p>Abstract</p> 
<p> Pylons is a popular, lightweight Python web framework. </p> 
<p> TurboGears 2 is a full-stack framework built atop Pylons. </p> 
<p> repoze.bfg is a moderately popular, lightweight Python web framework. </p> 
<p> The main developers and community leaders of these frameworks have been 
working together and sharing as much as possible over the course of roughly the 
last year. We'll very briefly describe to the audience the states of our 
individual efforts, then we'll discuss how we intend to move forward and share 
more code and effort in the year to come. The talk will be more 
socially-oriented than technical.</p> 
<p> It's unusual for open source code and communities to bridge minor 
perceived differences in scope and style and to start sharing code and ideas 
openly. If you're a user of any of these frameworks, you'll want to be present 
for this talk.</p> <br>

<h3>  DjangoCon 2010: Switching addons.mozilla.org from CakePHP to Django </h3>
<p>Switching addons.mozilla.org from CakePHP to Django</p> 
<p>Presented by Jeff Balogh</p> 
<p> In January of 2010 Mozilla started switching addons.mozilla.org (AMO) from 
CakePHP to Django. We see about 120 million web requests per month and 1.4 
million visitors per day. This talk will be a case study of scaling and 
deploying a large website (and getting faster than PHP) with MySQL, memcached, 
virtualenv, Celery, Hudson, Redis, MongoDB, and more.</p> 
<p>Abstract</p> 
<p> To scale the backend of AMO, we rely heavily on caching in memcached (and 
soon Redis) to keep the load off our database, and multidb to spread the load 
we can't dump off on cache. Our caching ranges from object and query caching, 
to template fragment caching, up to full response caching. Frontend caching is 
external to Django and won't be covered. In addition, we work hard to measure 
and improve raw speed. Hitting indexes and keeping datasets small is critical, 
and the Django ecosystem has many great tools to help us profile.</p> 
<p> We create development environments using pip and virtualenv, so we 
naturally started using that setup to deploy the site in production. We ran 
into issues creating a reliable environment with this method; switching to a 
separate vendor repository solved our problems with only a small amount of 
added effort. We update and deploy new code at least once a week, and have to 
deal with the additional complication of managing and interacting with parts of 
the PHP site that have not been ported over.</p> 
<p> Apart from scaling and deployment, we've customized our application in 
ways that could be interesting to other Django users:</p> Jinja is our 
templating engine (but we keep the admin working) Babel helps us localize the 
site in over 30 languages Sphinx (not the documentation tool) serves our search 
results Celery and RabbitMQ help us do offline processing Nose and Hudson help 
us get over 90% code coverage in tests <br>

<h3>  PyCon 2010: Python in quantitative finance (#158) </h3>  Python in 
quantitative finance<br>
<br>
 Presented by Wes McKinney (AQR Capital 
Management, LLC)<br>
<br>
 This talk will show how Python and libraries such as 
NumPy were instrumental at AQR for building a robust research platform for 
prototyping and implementing quantitative trading models. We will discuss many 
different tools, including pandas, a new open source library designed for 
analyzing common financial and economic data sets.<br>
<br>
 A variety of 
examples will be presented to explore Python's current status as a replacement 
for other statistical computing environments (as compared with R, MATLAB, or 
other commercial and open-source statistical products). <br>

<h3>  PyCon 2010: Mastering Team Play: Four powerful examples of composing 
Python tools (#184) </h3>  Mastering Team Play: Four powerful examples of 
composing Python tools<br>
<br>
 Presented by Raymond Hettinger <br>
<br>
 
Starts with a quick review of the performance characteristics of major 
individual tools in Python: bisect, heapq, lists, deques, sets, frozensets, 
class structures, sorts, and weakreferences. Show how these tools can be 
powerfully combined to create elegant solutions to four hard problems. Random 
sampling: when one data structure isn't enough. Discuss how the nature of the 
problem dictates when to use one of two alternate data structures. Ordered 
dictionaries: with the right compostion of dictionaries, linked lists, and weak 
references, a dictionary can remember its insertion order without any impact on 
its big-Oh running times. NFA to DFA conversion. The classic, but difficult, 
algorithm for lexical analysis becomes simple when composing Python's dicts and 
frozensets. Running median: the obvious approaches are horribly slow. The 
problem centers around how to efficiently maintain sorted data while advancing 
a large sliding window one value at a time. A list of deques provides a 
dramatic and scalable improvement in running time. <br>

<h3>  PyCon 2010: Hg and Git : Can't we all just get along? (#154) </h3> 
<p>Hg and Git: Can't we all just get along?</p> 
<p>Presented by Scott Chacon</p> 
<p> There is a fair amount of unnecessary animosity between developers about 
version control systems, especially between Mercurial and Git users. In 
reality, these two systems are very similar and can actually cooperate pretty 
well. In this talk we will show just how similar Git and Mercurial are, look at 
some of their technical differences, and see how they can work together by 
looking at hg-git, the bidirectional Git/Mercurial bridge, implemented in 
Python.</p> <br>

<h3>  PyCon 2010: Django Deployment Workshop </h3> 
<p>Django Deployment Workshop</p> 
<p>Presented by Jacob Kaplan-Moss</p> 
<p>So you've written a Django site... now what? Writing the application is 
just the beginning; now you've got to put it into production! In this hands-on 
workshop we'll walk through the creation of a full Django deployment 
environment running on a cluster of (virtual) machines.</p> 
<p>This class will introduce students to a wide variety of technologies, 
including Amazon's EC2 and S3, Fabric, Varnish, nginx, mod_wsgi, memcached, 
PostgreSQL, pgpool, pg_standby, and more.</p> 
<p>By the end of the class, each student will have created an environment 
featuring:</p> Multiple levels of caching and load balancing. Multiple web 
application servers. Shared media servers. Redundant replicated database 
servers. Separate caching servers.
<p>We'll create this whole stack on Amazon EC2 virtual machines, so students 
will be able to take home a complete copy of all the deployment configuration 
for future review at their leisure.</p> 
<p>Note: the example application used in this class with be a Django site, and 
the class assumes at least a moderate comfort level with Django. However, the 
tools and techniques apply just as well to other Python web frameworks, so 
users of other tools will likely be able to follow along fairly easily.</p> 
Intended Audience
<p>Intermediate to advanced Django users with sites nearing or in production. 
Python developers using other web frameworks will likely be able to follow 
along -- see the note in the summary, above.</p> Class Outline Introduction: 
the deployment question Application server: mod_wsgi Database server: 
PostgreSQL Automated deployment with Fabric Multiple web servers; load 
balancing with nginx Adding memcached Database connection middleware: pgpool 
Database redundancy: warm standby Upstream caching: Varnish Final load testing: 
how'd we do? Requirements
<p>Students will need a computer and Amazon EC2 and S3 accounts, and will be 
asked to familiarize themselves with the process of starting and stopping EC2 
virtual machines before the class.</p>

<h3>  PyCon 2010: Cross platform application development and distribution 
(#116) </h3>  Cross platform application development and distribution <br>
<br>

 Presented by Stani Michiels and Nadia Alramli<br>
<br>
 You think Python gives 
you native cross platform applications for free? Think twice. Are you 
interested in distributing your application to other platforms but not sure how?
<br><br>
 We will give tips and examples on how to enhance the native feel of 
your application: notifications, registration of file types and more. The talk 
will also help you to avoid common pitfalls and provides solutions for 
designing cross platform user interfaces. (Although we use wxPython as an 
example, the principles are valid for other toolkits as well.) We'll show you 
where to start if you want to distribute your application to different 
platforms, briefly discussing tools like py2exe, py2app and Debian/Ubuntu 
packaging ecosystem. This talk is based on our experience from developing 
Phatch (Photo Batch Processor) and SPE (Python Editor). <br>
