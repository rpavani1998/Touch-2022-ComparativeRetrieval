<p>Some time ago I was asked to do a study of our most popular open source 
projects to assess 1) what governance models are out there and 2) if the 
governance model has any effect on the project's success (such as size of 
developer community) on the one hand and on the other hand on the business of 
the related vendor(s). Some of the results are quite remarkable and have 
general applicability, so I wanted to share them here:</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2> 
<p>By studying a selection - believed to be more or less complete - of the 
most popular open source projects and correlating their size with governance 
model, we have revealed a strong, and to some possibly surprising result:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>There are <em><strong>9 projects</strong></em> (Linux, KDE, Apache, 
Eclipse, Perl+CPAN, Mozilla+Addons, Gnome, Drupal and GNU) that stand out as<em>
<strong>significantly larger - roughly 10 times -</strong></em> than any others.
</li> 
<li><em><strong>All of these projects, categorized as &quot;XtraLarge&quot;, 
are developed as collaborative community projects governed by non-profit 
foundations</strong></em>. No single vendor project has so far been even close 
to reaching their magnitude.</li> 
<li><em><strong>There appears to be a glass ceiling limiting the growth of the 
Large single-vendor projects</strong></em> (MySQL, Qt, OpenOffice, Mono, JBoss).
</li> 
<li>While the unfathomable magnitude and velocity of the Linux project is well 
studied and commonly known, and the preference of collaborative foundation 
governed projects has started to become a generally accepted fact, it was 
surprising to find as many as 9 projects that all clearly stand out from the 
rest.<em><strong>A 9 to 0 is statistically a very strong result in favor of the 
foundation governance model.</strong></em> </li> 
<li>The other factor strengthening this result is the clear gap between the 
&quot;XtraLarge&quot; group and the other projects. This gives further 
confidence in the validity of the result. Even if the underlying data was 
deemed to be of poor quality, it is clear it does not have errors that could 
explain a difference of this magnitude.</li> 
<li>Another common trait all 9 &quot;XtraLarge&quot; projects share is the 
software architecture being either modular (Linux, Eclipse, Perl+CPAN, 
Mozilla+Addons, Drupal) or formed as a collection of software (KDE, Apache, 
Perl+CPAN, Gnome, GNU) - in fact many, like Eclipse and Apache are both of 
these.</li> </ul> 
<p>The Oracle controlled OpenJDK may prove to become an exception to the rule, 
since IBM in 2010 announced that it will contribute to OpenJDK development and 
abandon Apache Harmony. Previously Red Hat is already a contributor and Apple 
joined OpenJDK in 2011. While building an XtraLarge developer community around 
OpenJDK, if successful, is an impressive achievement of Sun and Oracle, the 
route taken there is perhaps not applicable to the general open source project: 
Java grew to its current level of importance as a proprietary product, and 
IBM's abandonment of Apache Harmony seems to have been the result of some kind 
of non-public but strong coercion from Oracle's side. This &quot;brute 
force&quot; strategy is simply not available to most open source projects 
aspiring to reach the XtraLarge category.</p> 
<p>By comparing the relative investment of Red Hat and Novell into the 
development of Linux, it was shown that both the largest and second largest 
Linux vendor clearly benefit from sharing development cost by collaborative 
development. Red Hat is the biggest Linux developer by providing 12% of the 
development effort, but having then in proportion a much larger, 62% market 
share. This indicates that the leverage Red Hat gets from the collaborative 
development of Linux is roughly<em><strong>Leverage = 5x</strong></em>. For 
Novell, the levarage is almost as significant, with 7.6% of development effort, 
29% market share, yielding a roughly 4x leverage factor.</p> 
<p>It was further observed that if Linux had been developed as a single vendor 
effort by Red Hat alone, we can see that the engineering effort would probably 
be about 10 times smaller than the total effort by the whole Linux community is 
today. This seems to be in harmony with the previous observation that the 
largest single vendor projects are roughly 10 times smaller than the 
&quot;XtraLarge&quot; foundation governed projects.</p> 
<p>From these results it follows as an obvious <em><strong>recommendation that 
vendors participating in open source development and business, should look into 
participating in collaborative community developed projects - where the 
standard and familiar governance form is a non-profit foundation</strong></em>. 
If a vendor is currently in control of an open source project, it should 
explore the option of transferring the project to an existing foundation, or 
alternatively creating its own foundation for it. Since the original vendor is 
always the strongest candidate to become the leading vendor also in a 
collaboratively developed project, the vendor could,<em><strong>as a rule of 
thumb, expect this strategy - if properly executed - to result in a 10x growth 
in the project and product, but also 10x larger addressable market, of which 
the vendor can expect to capture 50% or more as its own market share.</strong>
</em></p> 
<h2>Methodology</h2> 
<p>A few lists of open source projects were used as sources to create a (near) 
complete list of the most popular open source projects in the world. In 
particular, the included projects had to be:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Upstream projects, where code is developed (e.g. not a Linux distribution 
or something like XAMPP)</li> 
<li>Well established, large, and leading (or &quot;tied&quot; like Gnome vs 
KDE) in their category</li> </ul> 
<p>Sources used were the lists generated by the popularity-contest package in 
Debian and Ubuntu, SourceForge all time top downloads and this was complemented 
with a short list of projects known to be large and important but not found by 
the above sampling method.</p> 
<p>From the Debian and Ubuntu &quot;popcon&quot; lists any projects appearing 
in the top 1000 were collected. The explanation for this is that +98% of the 
top 1000 installed packages are common system libraries and utilities that can 
be grouped under &quot;gnu system tools&quot; or just discarded as 
&quot;other&quot; if not coming from GNU. But among these 1000 top packages one 
will also find code from familiar software like Perl, Python, PHP, Gnome and 
the Linux kernel itself.</p> 
<p>The SourceForge list turned out to be a disappointment, it seems it is 
topped by filesharing applications and even a lot of Windows-only software. 
Only a few projects judged to be relevant to the general area of &quot;LAMP 
server or Linux desktop&quot; were selected from here.</p> 
<p>Finally, a few obviously important but still missing open source projects 
were added by the author himself.</p> 
<p>This resulted in the following sample of open source projects.</p> Debian

<p><strong>Table 1: Sample of popular open source projects used in the study
</strong></p> 
<p>The size of the developer community of the selected projects was then 
estimated so that they could be ordered roughly by size. For the largest 
projects Linux, Apache, KDE, Gnome and Eclipse separate studies have been made 
into the volume and structure of the development effort (see Sources at the 
end), or some number of active participants is advertised by the project host. 
But even for these projects it is not trivial to compare the size of the 
communities relative to each other, since each such study still produces 
different measurements.1</p> 
<p>For the other projects OHLOH.net was used to get the commits/day, active 
devs/month and devs all time. While the OHLOH service was a convenient way to 
quickly gather statistics for such a large number of projects, the quality of 
the data seems to be rather unreliable. For instance OHLOH claims that MySQL 
has only 25 active developers in a given month, yet the author is personally 
familiar with more full time MySQL developers than that. On the other hand 
within the more than 1000 all time MySQL developers there are many duplicates, 
triplicates and quadruplicates due to people using different email addresses. 
It is also very unlikely that Thunderbird would have 3 times more developers 
than Firefox (both without plugins, only core). And there are caveats to be 
aware of, for instance searching for &quot;CPAN&quot; on OHLOH gives statistics 
about the Perl CPAN module, not the entire CPAN archive (which may be 
impossible to get form anywhere).</p> 
<p>Even so, the OHLOH numbers were used for most projects to get an ordered 
list and the eventual grouping into different sizes of communities, but this 
was balanced with a subjective check by the authors own observations of the 
projects. The main results of this study are statistically very strong, with a 
10x difference in size between different types of projects, and however large 
the margin of error due to OHLOH inaccuracies, it is certainly smaller than 
that.</p> 
<p>This resulted in the following table with various statistics on project 
size:</p> <br>

<p><strong>Table 2: Projects ordered by relative size, with various metrics
</strong></p> 
<p>Numbers in bold are based on published studies from the projects 
themselves. The other numbers are based on OHLOH.net.</p> 
<p>954 people contributed at least 1 patch to the core of Drupal 7, over a 3 
year development period. In addition to that, as of this moment, Drupal has 
some 8291 addon modules, a similar amount as the Perl CPAN archive. These facts 
don't fit nicely into any column in the above table, but underscores the size 
of the Drupal community - in fact, Drupal may be the largest open source 
project out there? The table shows the OHLOH numbers from 2010.</p> 
<p>For Perl the only statistic available is the number of modules on CPAN. 
Most probably the number of developers all time is smaller than 8500, but it 
gives a good order of magnitude. Same logic is used for Mozilla (where both 
Firefox and Thunderbird are combined as they share code and plugins).</p> 
<p>In 2011 an attempt was made to get more accurate numbers about the 
engineering investment into OpenJDK - this was motivated by the thinking that 
it could potentially now be of XtraLarge size and must in anyway be very close 
to a thousand developers collectively. The problem is that the OHLOH.net 
numbers for OpenJDK only report some 50+ monthly developers. This simply cannot 
be correct and the most likely explanation is that Oracle develops Java mostly 
behind closed doors with one or a few people periodically funneling bug fixes 
and new code towars OpenJDK. Hence the true size of OpenJDK development remains 
unknown for now.</p> 
<h2>Results</h2> 
<p>Due to the inaccuracy of the data, making a plot or other graph is not 
useful. Instead, projects can be grouped by size into XtraLarge, Large and 
Medium categories (small projects were omitted). These were then correlated 
against the known governance model:</p> XtraLarge<br>
 1000+ devs<br>
 100+ 
commits/day Linux, KDE, Apache, Eclipse, Perl+CPAN, Mozilla+Addons, Gnome, 
Drupal &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
Large<br>
 20-200 devs<br>
 50-100 commits GCC, 
Python, Samba MySQL, Qt, OpenOffice, Mono, JBoss PHP+PEAR <br>
Medium GIMP 
Subversion, GhostScript, Wordpress phpMyAdmin <br>
Missing data Xorg, GNU 
system tools OpenJDK &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Foundation Vendor &quot;Just a 
project&quot; <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Table 3: Correlating project governance model with size of 
development community</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p> 
<p>Categories are observed, not pre-determined, ie they follow as observations 
from the sample. For instance &quot;Multiple vendor consortium&quot; is not 
observed in the sample. (Eg. Eclipse 2001-2003.)</p> 
<p>While the Linux project produces essentially one deliverable, the kernel, 
others like KDE, Apache, Gnome are here entire foundations hosting many 
sub-projects, but considered here as one community. The justification here is 
that these collections of software projects still fall under some common theme, 
such as Apache mostly producing web software and supporting developer 
utilities. With the donation of OpenOffice to Apache this interpretation may 
perhaps have reached its limit, other than the Apache license, OpenOffice seems 
to have nothing at all in common with any of the other Apache projects.</p> 
<p>Similarly separate &quot;contributor modules&quot; archives - found in 
Perl, PHP, Drupal etc... - are considered part of the main project, as a 
modular architecture is a key enabler of growing a large community. To compare, 
if MySQL had been similarly community driven, phpMyAdmin could have been part 
of it, not a separate project as it is now.</p> 
<p>GIMP predates Gnome but is now part of it.</p> 
<p>GCC is part of GNU, but listed separately as data was available. The author 
estimates that &quot;the GNU project&quot; would also be an XtraLarge project 
if data had been found, as GCC alone tops the Large category already.</p> 
<p>Similarly OpenJDK may be the first vendor controlled project to break into 
the XtraLarge category, see discussion in conclusions.</p> 
<p>Python changed to Foundation in 2000. Subversion was previously led by 
CollabNet, but is since 2009 an Apache (Foundation) project and Wordpress is 
transfering to its own foundation in 2010 from Automattic, but both are here 
categorized as vendor projects since this is the model that existed for most of 
their lifetime.</p> 
<p>Qt, MySQL and GhostScript are the stars of 1990 dual-licensing era.</p> 
<p>OpenOffice was forked in 2010. The Document Foundation producing the 
LibreOffice fork already got 77 new contributors in a few months. In 2011 
Oracle donated the OpenOffice code to Apache Foundation, where IBM is investing 
developers and rallying for a community. This study classifies the historical 
OpenOffice by Sun, as it would be too early to say anything about the Apache 
and LibreOffice descendants.</p> 
<p>Mozilla Foundation has ~100MUSD revenues and employs many engineers, in the 
other foundation projects engineers typically work at participating companies. 
It is notable - and relevant for the following discussion on financial 
motivations - that this makes Mozilla Corp larger on a revenue basis than any 
of the for-profit vendors in the vendor column!</p> 
<p>Wordpress only has data for core, plugins and themes is here added as 
guesstimate to even reach Medium.</p> 
<p>Note that PHP was in 2011 moved to the &quot;Just a project&quot; column, 
after the author became aware that &quot;The PHP Group&quot; has never formally 
incorporated in any jurisdiction. Despite this fact, PHP does have a well 
defined process of membership and decision making similar to what more formal 
organizations tend to have. The lack of a legally incorporated organization 
seems to mainly be a problem in scenarios where PHP would need to assert 
trademark or copyright or otherwise enter into legal proceedings against some 
threat - scenarios which have never materialized. PHP may very well be the 
largest unincorporated project in the world.</p> 
<h2>Observations</h2> 
<p>All large projects have some form of formal governance, either single 
vendor or non-profit foundation.</p> 
<p>There are 9 projects (if including GNU, for which data was not available) 
in the top &quot;XtraLarge&quot; category. These projects clearly stand out 
from the following &quot;Large&quot; category.<strong>On average they are a 
factor of 10 times larger</strong>. (Gnome is a little smaller than the other 
projects in this top category, but it too clearly stands out from the projects 
in the next category with roughly a hundred or less monthly developers.)</p> 
<p><strong>All of the XtraLarge projects are non-profit foundation governed
</strong> and none of the single vendor projects have managed to grow even 
close to this size.</p> 
<p>The above result is statistically very strong. While the unfathomable size 
and velocity of the Linux project is well studied (18 000 lines of code changed 
per day!), this is not a single case but altogether 9 collaborative and 
foundation governed projects have reached this size.</p> 
<p><strong>There appears to be a glass ceiling for single vendor projects
</strong> prohibiting their growth from the Large category upwards. <strong>To 
truly reach their fullest potential, open source projects are recommended to 
consider the proven governance model of a non-profit foundation</strong> around 
which participants collaborate.</p> 
<p><strong>Oracle's OpenJDK may become the first vendor controlled project to 
reach the XtraLarge category.</strong> Red Hat already contributes to it and 
recently IBM announced it will abandon its competing Apache Harmony effort and 
contribute to OpenJDK instead. OpenJDK is however a special case: 1) Java grew 
to its current magnitude as a purely proprietary product and 2) while not 
publicly known, the move by IBM from Apache to OpenJDK seems to have been 
influenced by some kind of coercion from Oracle, such as related to the Oracle 
vs Google patent and copyright suit against Dalvik/Harmony, or holding some 
aspect of the JCP process hostage, etc. So while it is a remarkable achievement 
to build a large developer community around a previously closed source product, 
the path taken to achieve that is perhaps not applicable in a general case.</p> 
<p><strong>Large Vendor governed projects tend to be controversial:</strong>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>MySQL: Financial star, but now forked many times over. A lot of work to 
just keep it alive now.</li> 
<li>OpenOffice: Typical Sun: Stagnated and mismanaged since 2000. Now 
successfully forked: all Linuxes immediately backed it, 77 new contributors 
within 2 months.</li> 
<li>Mono: FOSS fundamentalists boycott it anyway because of .NET origin, the 
rest don't care that it is vendor managed.</li> 
<li>Qt: Technically superior, but lost total dominance to being 50-50 with GTK 
(part of Gnome) due to Trolltech over-controlling it. (Financially ok: Nokia 
acquired in 2008.)</li> 
<li>JBoss has been uncontroversial to the community, but was attacked by IBM 
backed Apache Geronimo for market share (but survived this).</li> 
<li>OpenJDK is likely to break into the XtraLarge Vendor spot, after Oracle 
bullied IBM into contributing to it.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Large Vendor projects are also known to have poor community 
contributions.</strong> (TODO: Find out about JBoss?)</p> 
<p>XtraLarge foundations &quot;acquire&quot; Medium projects. (Subversion, 
GIMP)</p> 
<p>It is a common claim that for an open source project to flourish, a modular 
architecture is imperative. This is of course recommended for any software 
project, but in open source it is seen as a pre-requisite to enable the 
distributed development typical of open source projects. It is easy to observe 
that all of the XtraLarge projects have either a modular architecture (Linux, 
Eclipse, Perl+CPAN, Mozilla+Addons, Drupal) or are collections of software 
(KDE, Apache, Perl+CPAN, Gnome and GNU). In fact, many like Apache, Eclipse and 
KDE are both of these.</p> 
<h2>Business value of having a (Xtra)Large community</h2> 
<p>Intuitively it seems obvious that it can only be positive - also 
financially - if a project can grow 10 times larger with one model than 
another. Yet, it is an appropriate question to ask, from a vendor point of 
view, whether it would still be financially preferable to keep control of the 
project at the vendor in order to monetize it better, even with the risk of the 
project then remaining significantly smaller. Note that this translates 
directly into the product receiving less investment into its development.</p> 
<p>To answer this question, we will look into the Linux project and the 
financial performance of its dominant vendors. Out of all projects and markets 
this is the one with most studies available. Also, the Linux vendor market can 
be seen as somewhat of a pioneer in open source businesses, so it is reasonable 
to expect - or wish - that dynamics first seen in this market can later be seen 
also in the other projects.</p> 
<p>The task is to estimate the benefit Linux vendors get from sharing 
development costs by collaborating, and on the other hand what they might lose 
in revenues and market share by being open. Looking at reports on Linux 
development on the one hand, and market shares of the different Linux vendors 
on the other hand, we can see that:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Red Hat is the largest contributor to Linux development at 12% of commits.
</li> 
<li>Red Hat has the most control of Linux development, employing 36% of the 
lead developers that review commits. (...and this used to be 50% few years 
ago.) So we make an additional observation that while sharing development cost 
with others, Red Hat is quite firmly in control of this project.</li> 
<li>Red Hat has 62% market share of Linux operating system sales</li> </ul> 
<p>The above means that Red Hat as the leading Linux vendor has an 
unproportionally large market share compared to the development investment.2 
Thus, the<strong>leverage</strong> that Red Hat receives from participating in 
the collaborative development of Linux is:</p> 
<p><strong>Leverage = 62/12 ~= 5x</strong></p> 
<p>To justify the logic behind the above calculation we should make some 
additional remarks: The revenues generated by a product will depend on</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The total addressable market (which for operating systems is some tens of 
billions USD)</li> 
<li>The product's market share</li> 
<li>One factor <em>limiting</em> the products market share is how well its 
functionality and features serve the needs of the total addressable market. For 
instance, early on one may have claimed that Linux wasn't suitable for all 
kinds of server workloads, and still isn't perhaps suitable to many users as a 
desktop operating system. How much of the total market opportunity a product is 
able to serve, is somewhat a direct result of the engineering investment 
received by the product.</li> </ol> 
<p>From the above treatment of Red Hat's role in the collaborative development 
of Linux on the one hand, and its market share on the other, we can conclude 
that if Red Hat was solely developing Linux as a single-vendor effort, then 
Linux would receive only 1/10 of the current total engineering investment. This 
in turn means the total market share of Linux of the total operating systems 
market might be about 1/10 of the current market share, since the product would 
be weaker and not serve well as many customers as it does today. (Of course, 
more likely, it might then be totally irrelevant and have a very small market 
share, if at all.)</p> 
<p>On the other hand, by developing Linux collaboratively, the total Linux 
market is 10 times greater, and<em>Red Hat has been successful in capturing 62% 
of that larger market</em>. This seems like a good strategy to follow, <em>
resulting in 5x more revenues than the alternative</em> strategy.</p> 
<p>It is also possible to do the same calculation for the second largest Linux 
vendor Novell:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>7.6% of all commits</li> 
<li>29% market share</li> 
<li>Levarage = 3.8x</li> </ul> 
<p>It seems also Novell is benefiting from the collaborative development model 
of Linux, having a market share almost 4 times larger than its engineering 
investment. This means that both Red Hat and Novell gain<em>significantly</em> 
from collaborative development - this is commonly called a win-win situation. 
(Of course, if Linux was a single vendor project, then Novell's share as the 
second largest vendor would tend to be zero or insignificant, so the benefit of 
participating in a collaborative project is in that light quite dramatic for 
the second vendor.)</p> 
<p>Finally, we should point out the harmony between these observations of 
vendors revenues and investment into Linux, with the above treatment of 
governance models of open source projects: We observe here that if Red Hat was 
developing Linux alone as a single vendor effort, it would be approximately 10x 
smaller. On the other hand, this is precisely the difference observed between 
the 9 foundation governed and collaborative projects in the 
&quot;XtraLarge&quot; category compared to the average size of the largest 
single-vendor projects.</p> 
<h2>Recommendations</h2> 
<p>From these results it follows as an obvious recommendation that vendors 
participating in open source development and business, should look into 
participating in collaborative community developed projects - where the 
standard and familiar governance form is a non-profit foundation. If a vendor 
is currently in control of an open source project, it should explore the option 
of transferring the project to an existing foundation, or alternatively 
creating its own foundation for it. Since the original vendor is always the 
strongest candidate to become the leading vendor also in a collaboratively 
developed project, the vendor could, as a rule of thumb, expect this strategy - 
if properly executed - to result in:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The project growing 10 times larger.</li> 
<li>The product thus receiving 10 times more investment into its development.
</li> 
<li>This larger development community therefore leading also to a 10 times 
larger addressable market.</li> 
<li>The vendor being able to capture 50% or more of that larger market.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>These are all infrastructure projects</h3>  Submitted by Paul Davis (not 
verified) on Mon, 2010-12-06 18:11.<br>

<p>With the GIMP as a major exception and possibly 2 others as minor ones, all 
the projects listed here are infrastructure projects - they deal with system 
services, provision of taken-for-granted functionality (email &amp; web) and/or 
the running of servers. The conclusions that can be drawn from this set of 
software are not obviously transferrable to niche or domain specific tools that 
operate with vastly smaller user-bases, much smaller development communities 
and no clear business model.</p>  &raquo;

<h3>re: infrastructure projects</h3>  Submitted by hingo on Mon, 2010-12-20

<p>This is a correct observation. The right way to interpret these results is 
that to grow really big, there are several things that need to happen, but 
using the collaborative foundation model is one of them. If the technology at 
hand only serves a niche (x-ray imaging, whatever), then of course that will 
limit its size anyway.</p> 
<p>The study was originally done for an infrastructure technology, so it was 
very relevant.</p> 
<p>Additionally, I have the theory that the more &quot;low level&quot; 
infrastructure you talk about, the bigger the addressable market of the 
technology, and this contributes to having a bigger community. So everyone from 
mobile phones to super computers need an operating system, and that's why Linux 
is the biggest of these in all respects. Not everyone needs a database, but 
those that do need one tend to cluster around a few common ones (MySQL for open 
source, Oracle, Microsoft on the proprietary side) regardless of the 
application or programming language. Then many need a web server, but this 
group is again smaller than everyone who needs a database. And for some reason 
the programming language space is much more fractured than the previous 
technologies, so we have Perl, PHP, Python, Java, .NET... many more 
medium-to-large alternatives than we had further down the stack.</p> 
<p>Then the same is repeated for applications, so Gnome and KDE obviously are 
bigger than any one particular application, etc..</p>  &raquo;

<h3>Modular architecture / collections of software</h3>  Submitted by Marc 
Laporte (not verified) on Sun, 2011-12-18 08:33. <br>

<p>&quot;It is a common claim that for an open source project to flourish, a 
modular architecture is imperative. This is of course recommended for any 
software project, but in open source it is seen as a pre-requisite to enable 
the distributed development typical of open source projects. It is easy to 
observe that all of the XtraLarge projects have either a modular architecture 
(Linux, Eclipse, Perl+CPAN, Mozilla+Addons, Drupal) or are collections of 
software (KDE, Apache, Perl+CPAN, Gnome and GNU). In fact, many like Apache, 
Eclipse and KDE are both of these.&quot;</p> 
<p>What is the % of projects which fit that (modular architecture / 
collections of software) description? If 95% of the projects out there fit a 
description, and the top-x also fit that description, can we really infer that 
it's a criteria for success? One could argue that it's just the most common way 
of building software.</p> 
<p>For FOSS Web applications (which is a huge category), almost all projects 
have an emphasis on modules/plugins/extensions. There is one notable exception: 
Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware, which is the:<br>

http://tiki.org/FOSS+Web+Application+with+the+most+built-in+features</p> 
<p>But I wonder if anyone could come up with other projects which are 
exceptions?</p>

<p>That is a valid question - maybe it's just a fact everyone is modular these 
days. From the projects categorized here, I wouldn't say that MySQL is modular, 
it is moving increasingly in that direction. I don't know enough about the 
Samba, Subversion or GhostScript code bases to have an opinion, but it seems 
all others are indeed quite modular. (For some like Qt and OpenJDK this just 
follows from being object oriented.)</p>  &raquo;
