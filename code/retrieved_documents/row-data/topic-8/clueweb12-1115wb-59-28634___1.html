<h1>50 Extremely Useful PHP Tools</h1> Posted by tung on June 17, 2010 in 
Featured | 0 Comment <br>

<p><em>By Jacob Gube</em></p> 
<p><strong>PHP</strong> is one of the most widely used open-source server-side 
scripting languages that exist today. With over 20 million indexed domains 
using PHP, including major websites like Facebook, Digg and WordPress, there 
are good reasons why many Web developers prefer it to other server-side 
scripting languages, such as Python and Ruby.</p> 
<p>PHP is faster (<em>updated</em>), and it is the most used scripting language
 in practice; it has detailed documentation, a huge community, numerous 
ready-to-use scripts and well-supported frameworks; and most importantly, 
it&rsquo;s much easier to get started with PHP than with other scripting 
languages (Python, for example). That&rsquo;s why it makes perfect sense to 
provide the huge community of PHP developers with an overview of useful tools 
and resources that can make their development process easier and more effective.
</p> 
<p>This post presents <strong>50 useful PHP tools that can significantly 
improve your programming workflow</strong>. Among other things, you&rsquo;ll 
find a plethora of libraries and classes that aid in debugging, testing, 
profiling and code-authoring in PHP.</p>
