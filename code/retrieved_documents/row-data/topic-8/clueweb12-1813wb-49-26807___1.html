Recently 
one of the Tweeps following me started fooling around and hit one of my sweet 
spots: Windows Azure. Basically, he mocked me for using Windows Azure forMyGet, 
a website with enough users but not enough to justify the 
&ldquo;scalability&rdquo; aspect he thought Windows Azure was offering. Since 
Windows Azure is much, much more than scalability alone, I decided to do a 
quick writeup about the various reasons on why we useWindows Azure for MyGet. 
And those are not scalability.
<p>First of all, here&rsquo;s a high-level overview of our deployment, which 
may illustrate some of the aspects below:</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Costs</h2> 
<p>Windows Azure is <em>cheap</em>. Cheap as in cost-effective, not as in, 
well, sleezy. Many will disagree with me but the cost perspective of Windows 
Azure can be real cheap in some cases as well as very expensive in other cases. 
For example, if someone asks me if they should move to Windows Azure and they 
now have one server running 300 small sites, I&rsquo;d probably tell them not 
to move as it will be a tough price comparison.</p> 
<p>With MyGet we run 2 Windows Azure instances in 2 datacenters across the 
globe (one in the US and one in the EU). For $180.00 per month this means 2 
great machines at two very distant regions of the globe. You can probably find 
those with other hosters as well, but will they manage your machines? Patch and 
update them? Probably not, for that amount. In our scenario, Windows Azure is 
cheap.</p> 
<p>Feel free to look at the cost calculator tool to estimate usage costs.</p> 
<h2>Traffic Manager</h2> 
<p>Traffic Manager, a great (beta) product in the Windows Azure offering 
allows us to do geographically distributed applications. For example, US users 
of MyGet will end up in the US datacenter, European users will end up in the EU 
datacenter. This is great, and we can easily add extra locations to this policy 
and have, for example, a third location in Asia.</p> 
<p>Next to geographically distributing MyGet, Traffic Manager also ensures 
that if one datacenter goes down, the DNS pool will consist of only 
&ldquo;live&rdquo; datacenters and thus provide datacenter fail-over. Not ideal 
as the web application will be served faster from a server that&rsquo;s closer 
to the end user, but the application will not go down.</p> 
<p>One problem we have with this is storage. We use Windows Azure storage 
(blobs, tables and queues) as those only cost $0.12 per GB. Distributing the 
application does mean that our US datacenter server has to access storage in 
the EU datacenter which of course adds some latency. We try to reduce this 
using extensive caching on all sides, but it&rsquo;d be nicer if Traffic 
Manager allowed us to setup georeplication for storage as well. This only 
affects storing package metadata and packages. Reading packages is not affected 
by this because we&rsquo;re using the Windows Azure CDN for that.</p> 
<h2>CDN</h2> 
<p>The Windows Azure Content Delivery Network allows us to serve users fast. 
The main use case for MyGet is accessing and downloading packages. Ok, the 
updating has some latency due to the restrictions mentioned above, but if you 
download a package from MyGet it will always come from a CDN node near the end 
user to ensure low latency and fast access. Given the CDN is just a checkbox on 
the management pages means integrating with CDN is a breeze. The only thing 
we&rsquo;ve struggled with is finding an acceptable caching policy to ensure 
stale data is limited.</p> 
<h2>Windows Azure AppFabric Access Control</h2> 
<p>MyGet is not one application. MyGet is three applications: our development 
environment, staging and production. In fact, we even plan for tenants so every 
tenant in fact is its own application. To streamline, manage and maintain a 
clear overview of which user can authenticate to which application via which 
identity provider, we use ACS to facilitate MyGet authentication.</p> 
<p>To give you an example: our dev environment allows logging in via OpenID on 
a development machine. Production allows for OpenID on a live environment. In 
staging, we only use Windows Live ID and Facebook whereas our production 
website uses different identity providers. Tenants will, in the future, be 
given the option to authenticate to their own ADFS server, we&rsquo;re pretty 
sure ACS will allow us to simply configure that and instrument only tenant X 
can use that ADFS server.</p> 
<p>ACs has been a great time saver and is definitely something we want to use 
in future project. It really eases common authentication pains and acts as a 
service bus between users, identity providers and our applications.</p> 
<h2>Windows Azure AppFabric Caching</h2> 
<p>Currently we don&rsquo;t use Windows Azure AppFabric Caching in our 
application. We currently use the ASP.NET in-memory cache on all machines but 
do feel the need for having a distributed caching solution. While appealing, we 
think about deploying Memcached in our application because of the cost 
structure involved. But we might as well end up with Wndows Azure AppFabric 
Caching anyway as it integrates nicely with our current codebase.</p> 
<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p>In short, Windows Azure is much more than hosting and scalability. 
It&rsquo;s the building blocks available such as Traffic Manager, CDN and 
Access Control Service that make our lives easier. The pricing structure is not 
always that transparent but if you dig a little into it you&rsquo;ll find 
affordable solutions that are really easy to use because you don&rsquo;t have 
to roll your own.</p> <br>
