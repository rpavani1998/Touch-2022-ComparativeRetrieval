After 
about three weeks I finally have the results for theLearn-Only-3-Languages 
survey.&nbsp; The sample size was really great.&nbsp; I got about 2,300 
responses to the survey!<br>
<br>
Unsurprisingly, you'll find Java towering 
above the other languages.&nbsp; The 2nd and 3rd place languages were 
JavaScript and Python.&nbsp; It confirms that a lot of developers believe 
Python will be one of the dominant languages of the future.&nbsp; I was 
surprised that PHP was so far down on the rankings, given its ubiquity on the 
web.&nbsp; Anyway, enough of what I think.&nbsp; Let's see what you think:<br>

<h3>Kasper Hansen replied on Wed, 2010/12/08 - 8:22am</h3> I'm surprised only 
1,595 of 2,300 have Java as one of the languages, since this is a java 
community.. What language did the ones who didn't choose Java - what is the 
trend?

<p>Technically yes, but they're different in syntax and have different field

<h3>Jay Huang replied on Wed, 2010/12/08 - 9:45am</h3> It's a very interesting 
result but again the poll is from Java community.&nbsp; It also indicates that 
most Java programers are sever side programmers since there is not really much 
space for Java on desktop or on the web. With the announcement of Google Chrome 
Web Store, I think that more developers will spend more time on HTML5, 
JavaScript and ActionScript, just like Java developers jumping into 
Android.&nbsp; It's really sad that Java Store just died silently.

<h3>Endre Varga replied on Wed, 2010/12/08 - 1:36pm in response to: kube82</h3>
Well, the poll asked for 3 languages, so it is more surprising is that Java is 
_over_ 33% (that would mean that every participant selected Java and any two 
other languages)

<h3>Byron Palmer replied on Wed, 2010/12/08 - 4:14pm</h3> I think the question 
that needs to be asked is what was the audience for this poll. If it really was 
Java developers then 30% do not think Java should be one of the three 
languages. If it was a cross section of all developers then I could easily 
believe that 30% would not think it was important. So please answer the 
question of the audience. This should have been paired with a question as to 
what is the person's primary language. But that makes analysis more difficult.
<p> For those who have difficulty with math, the total of all the languages is 
300% as each of the three language choices were added into the sum.</p>

<p>Yeah, there's not much space... except in defense... and in banking... and 
in oil... and in bioinfomatics... and in healthcare... and in retail... and

<h3>Clinton Begin replied on Thu, 2010/12/09 - 10:59am</h3> I clicked the link 
specifically to seen where ActionScript fell compared to JavaScript... sadly 
disappointed to see them combined. :-( I've recently seen this mistake made on 
a number of articles -- often posted at DZone. Perhaps a DZone article 
explaining the vast differences between ActionScript and JavaScript is in 
order? A. Shirkov is right to point out that not only are the languages 
different, but their field of use keeps them widely disparate as well.

wonderful summation, I located your blog checking goggle for any similar 
subject and observed this. I couldn't find as well significantly other tips and 
information aboutlip plumpers on this posting, so it was fantastic to discover 
this one. I will almost certainly be returning to think about a number of other 
articles which you have written another time.

<h3>Paco Gliss replied on Mon, 2012/01/16 - 5:00am</h3> I am a php developer. 
You ask me what language I would rather learn : I choose Java etc. But why the 
heck should I name php which I presently master ??? Your poll shows which 
languages developers might choose as a ***complementary*** or ***secondary*** 
language. It does not indicate which languages are actually favored ! IMHO,
