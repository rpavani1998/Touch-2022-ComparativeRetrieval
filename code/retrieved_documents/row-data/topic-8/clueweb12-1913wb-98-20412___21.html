<h2>The Web Application Framework Candidates</h2> 
<p>February 14, 2008</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The web application framework race is heating up, so let's take a moment to 
meet some of the candidates.</p> 
<h3>Java</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The current leader in the web application framework space, has a declining 
approval rating from the general public, but still maintains support from 
members of the static typing party.</p> 
<h3>Rails</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of the leading candidates from the dynamic typing party. This candidate 
has experience that proves she can bring change.</p> 
<h3>Merb</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>A candidate from the dynamic party who is quickly gaining support, running 
on his campaign of hope. Has a stance similar to that of Rails on many of the 
campaign issues.</p> 
<h3>Django</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Another strong dynamic party candidate, but having a hard time stealing the 
spotlight from the two dynamic party candidates, despite running on a strong 
platform.</p> 
<h3>Grails</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The leading candidate for the static typing party, particularly among 
moderate static typers, but having a hard time gaining support from 
conservative members of the static party who claim that he is too dynamic on 
some issues.</p> 
<h3>Scala</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>A candidate that appeals to some members of both the dynamic and static 
typing parties, quickly gaining notoriety on the web for his support of once 
unconventional ideas like functional programming.</p>

<h2>Evolutions - Migrations for Model-Centric Apps</h2> 
<p>November 24, 2007</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There is a project for Django called Evolution, which is conceptually 
similar to Rails' Migrations. There are some differences between Evolutions and 
Migrations, mainly due to the fact that Django is model-centric, meaning that 
you define the attributes of your models in the code and generate the database 
from that. Rails, or I guess ActiveRecord more specifically, as you probably 
know, is the opposite, where you define your database tables and an object 
model is generated at runtime from the database metadata. So I guess you would 
call that a database-centric ORM. Here's their take on the differences:<br>
</p>
<pre><code>Isn't this just ActiveRecord::Migration in Python? Superficially, 
yes, but not really. There is a degree of similarity - the Django Evolution 
syntax is a DSL for describing the changes that have been made to a model. 
However, there are also some significant differences. In addition to 
ActiveRecord::Migration, Django Evolution provides: 1. An audit trail - a 
permanent archive in the database of the changes that have been applied, and 
when. 2. An automated hinting scheme. If you don't want to write the migrations 
yourself, you don't have to. 3. Validation that an evolution script will leave 
the database in a state consistent with the current model definition. These 
differences are largely afforded by the model-centric design of Django itself. 
Whereas a Ruby on Rails model is a description of a database that has been 
created by hand, Django uses the Python model to creates the database. As a 
result, the model definition is canonical - not the database. This means that 
audit, hinting, and verification schemes can use the Django model as a point of 
reference. A Django Evolution script is much more than just an alternate syntax 
for SQL ALTER statements - it is an evolution scheme that is bound to the 
canonical model definition.</code></pre> 
<p>The DataMapper project is a model-centric ORM for Ruby apps and as that 
project continues to grow, their could be some ideas borrowed from Django 
Evolution, although they do already have their own thing going on with
Auto-Migration.</p> 
<p>But I'm a Ruby guy, so I've got to take one shot at them here :). They say 
&quot;the Django Evolution syntax is a DSL&quot;. Really?</p> 
<pre><code>MUTATIONS = [ AddField('Author', 'location', models.CharField, 
max_length=100, null=True) ]</code></pre> 
<p>I'm sorry, but if that's a DSL, then what isn't a DSL? In my opinion, there 
is too much Python syntax to call that a DSL. It's a subtle difference but this 
is a DSL:</p> 
<pre><code>add_column :authors, :location, :limit =&gt; 100 </code></pre> 
<p>The question when is it a language specific library and when it is a DSL? 
Would you call this a DSL?</p> 
<pre><code>Mutation m = new AddField(&quot;Author&quot;, &quot;location&quot;, 
CharField.class); m.setMaxLength(100); m.setAllowNulls(false); Mutations.add(m);
</code></pre>

<h2>Typo problems, new site coming soon (hopefully)</h2> 
<p>December 13, 2006</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This site is currently using Typo, which is blog software written using 
Ruby on Rails(RoR). It uses Mongrel to run RoR. Apache is the actual web 
server, it passes requests intended for RoR to mongrel, which then serves the 
request.</p> 
<p>I originally started this site with WordPress, which is PHP-based blog 
software. I'm not a big fan of developing with PHP, and I was hoping to start 
doing some custom things with my site, so I switched to Typo, so that my site 
would be running RoR, and I could make my own extensions using RoR.</p> 
<p>Since then, I've discovered a few major design flaws with RoR, so I'm not 
writing any code in RoR now. First of all, and this isn't really a design flaw, 
but more of a bug, is that some combination of Typo, Mongrel and Rails is 
causing a serious memory leak. Typo has caused my entire VPS instance hosted at
VPSLand to become unreachable. This has caused this site to be down over the 
past few days. I've never had that kind of problem with a Java app.</p> 
<p>Aside form the memory leak issues, and general difficult of setting up a 
stable rails site, the biggest thing I don't like about RoR is that your 
application model is inferred from the database at runtime. I'd much prefer it 
the other way around, where I write a domain model in code, and then the 
framework generates the database for me.<br>
</p> 
<p>The reason why it isn't like this in RoR is because Ruby isn't a statically 
typed language. There has been a lot of hype around dynamically typed 
languages, but I think they have disadvantages as well. Since I can't create a 
class in Ruby and declare what type each property is, there is no way to 
automatically generate a database based on the model.</p> 
<p>This is what got me interested in Django. Django is another web framework, 
but based on Python instead of Ruby. Python and Ruby are both dynamically typed 
languages, similar in a lot of ways, but they also have their differences. With 
the Django project, they chose to create pseudo-typing within Python, where you 
define the type of property of an object in a way that the framework 
understands it, but not the Python language itself.</p> 
<p>I like Python and Django, but I always thought to myself, wouldn't it be 
nice if the language was optionally typed, to that you could declare the type 
if you want to, so that the type could be used as metadata by a framework?</p> 
<p>I do most of my programming in Java, so I came to the realization that 
there are great things about Python, Django, Ruby and Rails, but Java, Stripes, 
Hibernate and friends have advantages too. I decided that although 
Python/Django and RoR (less so RoR, in my opinion) certainly seem like great 
ways to build web apps, I don't think there's an order of magnitude increase in 
productivity over Java, assome have claimed.</p> 
<p>But when turning back to Java, one thing I realized I missed was the true 
object oriented-ness that dynamic langauges allow. For example, in dynamic 
languages, to store a user object in the database, you use<code>user.save</code>
, whereas in Java, you do something like<code>userDao.save(user)</code>. Also, 
the succinctness of the dynamic languages are great, whereas Java verbosity can 
be almost ridiculous at times. Try this one on for size:</p> 
<pre><code>private static final List&lt;Map&lt;String, Date&gt;&gt; DAYS = new 
ArrayList&lt;Map&lt;String,Date&gt;&gt;(); static { try { 
Map&lt;String,Date&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;String,Date&gt;(); 
map.put(&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, new 
SimpleDateFormat(&quot;MM/dd/yyyy&quot;).parse(&quot;12/07/1941&quot;)); 
DAYS.add(map); map = new HashMap&lt;String,Date&gt;(); map.put(&quot;Iwo 
Jima&quot;, new 
SimpleDateFormat(&quot;MM/dd/yyyy&quot;).parse(&quot;02/19/1945&quot;)); 
DAYS.add(map); } catch(ParseException ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } } public 
static void main(String[] args) { for(Map&lt;String,Date&gt; day: DAYS) { 
for(Map.Entry&lt;String,Date&gt; e: day.entrySet()) { 
System.out.println(e.getKey()+&quot;, &quot;+e.getValue()); } } }</code></pre> 
<p>And then in a yet-to-be-discussed dynamic language:</p> 
<pre><code>def days = [ 'Pearl Harbor' : new java.util.Date('12/7/1941'), 'Iwo 
Jima' : new java.util.Date('2/19/1945') ] days.each { key, value -&gt; println 
&quot;$key, $value&quot; }</code></pre> 
<p>So, wouldn't it be nice if there was a dynamic, optionally typed language 
that would allow us to build a really great, object-oriented web application 
framework with a syntax as succinct as the syntax of fully dynamically typed 
languages? Well, there is, and it isGrails.</p> 
<p>Grails is a web-framework based on Groovy. Groovy is a scripting language 
that runs in the Java VM. It complies to Java bytecode. This is nice because 
you can build web apps using Groovy on Grails (GoG?), and then deploy to a 
regular Java application server, such as my personal favorite,Resin.<br>
</p> 
<p>The other nice thing about Grails is that it leverages all the existing 
Java frameworks, such asSpring and Hibernate. It puts a nice domain specific 
language on top of hibernate to make using Hibernate even easier.<br>
</p> 
<p>I'm just getting my feet wet learning Grails, and the best move I've made 
so far is to purchase the e-book version ofThe Definitive Guide to Grails. I've 
found the documentation on the grails site to be ok, but the book is great. 
It's a must read for anyone looking into Grails. My only criticism of the book 
so far is that they may have published it a little to early, because for 
example if states that Grails doesn't support many-to-many relationships, when 
in fact it does as of version 0.3.</p> 
<p>So the point of this long technical discussion is that from what I've read 
about Grails so far, it looks interesting. I'm going to try to get a new 
version of this site developed with Grails, and I'll try to make posts here of 
my progress, assuming Typo doesn't bring down my site again.</p>

<h2>Back from the Beyond</h2> 
<p>October 20, 2006</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So as I said I would, I've taken a look at Python and Django. In my brief 
look at it, I've learned a few things. One is that Python isn't that weird, 
it's just different. Handling blocks based on indentation is cool. Django is 
cool in a lot of ways. The thing I was most impressed with is the admin 
interface. The thing I was least impressed with is that the admin interface 
isn't very customizable. You get you what you get, which is a lot, but you 
don't have much control over it.</p> 
<p>But this blog post isn't really about Python or Django specifically, it's 
about languages and web frameworks. Here's what I've decided. Choosing a web 
framework and programming language is like choosing a guitar. There are die 
hard fans of different types. There are obscure niche types. There are widely 
used types. There are even variations among the different types. But the bottom 
line is that if you are a shitty guitar player, it's going to sound like shit, 
not matter which one you pick. And if you are a great guitar player, anything 
is going to sound pretty good. Choosing between them is really a matter a 
preference. The part where this analogy falls apart is that once you learn to 
play guitar, you can pick up any guitar and play, but just because you are a 
Ruby on Rails expert doesn't mean you can build a web site with Java, and vice 
versa. So it's not perfect, but you get the idea.</p> 
<p>I think up until recently, you couldn't argue with a straight face that 
building a Java application is not more complicated than building a Ruby on 
Rails app. Anyone who has tried to maintain a web app built with Struts 1.x, 
Spring, Hibernate 2.0, JSP 1.0 and an overly complex set of ant build scripts 
can attest to that. But I'm a believer in the latest innovations in Java. 
Annotations and Generics are making life easier. Stripes and Hibernate 3.2 with 
Annotations are much better than Struts (or webwork or Spring MVC for that 
matter) and Hibernate 2.0 respectively. JSP 1.2 is better than JSP 1.0, Maven 
is better than Ant, the list goes on.</p> 
<p>My theory is that we are at a point with Java where we can build 
applications with the same level of productivity as any other framework. I 
think we're beyondBeyond Java.<br>
</p> 
<p>So what I'm planning on doing in attempt to prove Bruce Tate wrong is to 
build a new version of my own blog in Java. I'm hoping this little side project 
will give me a chance to provide the world with an example of how Java 
applications can be built without endless XML sit-ups. I also feel the need to 
blog about it because it will motivate me into actually doing it. I have had 
lots of big ideas in the past and I rarely follow through with any of them, but 
this is one that I intend to. And so it begins.</p>

<h2>Python is Weird</h2> 
<p>September 20, 2006</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I've heard some good things about the Django framework. One thing that as 
me interested in Django is that the way it works in general is you define your 
domain model in code, in Python objects, and Django figures out how to build a 
database for you. Conceptually, I like this idea better thanRuby on Rails, 
where you define your domain model in the database, and then rails generates 
objects for you at runtime based on the database metadata. Also, you run it my 
installing mod_python in apache. Again, compared to rails with apache, 
FCGI/SCGI, lighttpd, mongrel, etc..., I don't know, let's just say I have found 
the process of setting up a rails production web/app server challenging. I 
haven't done it for Django yet, we'll see. Should be a small memory footprint 
too, making it easy to run multiple apps in my 192MB virtual server webhost.</p>
<p>But one thing I want to comment on now is that I find Python to be weird. 
Maybe this is because I have done most of my programming in Java, but when I 
started to learn Ruby, everything in Ruby just made sense, without Java's 
stupidity, such as NullPointerExceptions and primatives. I've soured on rails 
recently, but I miss Ruby. The language is succinct and powerful, it almost 
feels like writing psuedo code, except that it actually works.</p> 
<p>Anyway, let me just give a few examples of python weirdness. But before I 
do, let me say this. I don't know python well at all. Consider these statements 
to be my first impressions of Python. I'm in no way stating that python is poor 
language due to these oddities, they just strike me as odd and I feel the need 
to express it. So, on with the weirdness:</p> 
<p>So to get started, I started reading the Django install guide. I noticed I 
needed python 2.3 or higher. Fair enough, so python 2.5 is the latest, so I 
installed that.</p> 
<p>The next requirement is for MySQLdb. It says it works with python 2.3-2.4, 
doesn't say anything about 2.5. I decide to install python 2.4 to be safe. So 
just deciding which version of python to use is a little bit of a struggle.</p> 
<p>So now I have python 2.4 and MySQLdb. I want to try and do something simple 
to verify it is working. I find an example in the docs:</p> 
<pre>import MySQLdb 
db=MySQLdb.connect(passwd=&quot;moonpie&quot;,db=&quot;thangs&quot;) 
c=db.cursor() max_price=5 c.execute(&quot;&quot;&quot;SELECT spam, eggs, 
sausage FROM breakfast WHERE price &lt; %s&quot;&quot;&quot;, (max_price,))
</pre> 
<p>What's with the 3 quotes? Anyway, let's give it a try. First, I add 
c:python24in to my path, fire up a command prompt, and enter &quot;python&quot; 
in hopes of getting an interactive shell. Python isn't found. Why not, because 
the python executables aren't in c:python24in, they are in c:python24. Ok fine, 
I fix my path, but I decide to use the IDLE GUI instead. I try to enter a 
query, but I make a typo. I press the up arrow, but it doesn't bring up my 
previous command. I re-type it and get it right this time. The query is:</p> 
<p><code>select count(*) from users</code></p> 
<p>This returns 9 when I execute the query in mysql. What does Python return?
</p> 
<p><code>1L</code></p> 
<p>1L? What is that? Again, I am naive when it comes to python, this is not a 
fair criticism of Python, I have done very little to learn the language at this 
point, I just trying to illustrate a point. I know Java well. When I started 
learning Ruby, from the start, everything just worked as you expected it would. 
As I look into Python, I find one oddity after another. I'm sure if you know 
Python well you will consider many of the things in Java odd, so I'm just going 
to consider all of these things first impressions and move on to learn more 
about the language and give it a fair chance. But Python is still Weird.</p>
