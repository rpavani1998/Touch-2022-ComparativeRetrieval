<h2>Trembling Aspen</h2>  April 5, 2012, 3:17 pm <br>

<p>Aspen is a unique Python web framework developed by Chad Whitacre. I am 
still evaluating it, but one thing I can say unequivocally is that it&rsquo;s 
different. Very different. Aspen divorces itself from the MVC pattern that 
every major &mdash; and almost every minor &mdash; web framework has been 
relying on for the past decade. While each framework has its perks and 
annoyances, they all have this underlying MVC-like interface. Aspen throws that 
all away.</p> 
<p>Aspen lodges itself in a small niche between php-like spaghetti code and a 
complicated package structure full of python models, views, controllers, and 
templates. In Aspen, template and control code live in the same file, but in 
separate pages, calledSimplates. In a rebellion against regular expression url 
parsing, Aspen uses the filesystem to define url structure and paths; like in 
the old days of statically served HTML files.</p> 
<p>One thing I love about Aspen is how easy it is to get up and running. Aspen 
will serve a single HTML file with no python code without any boilerplate. It 
serves static files for css, javascript, and images just as easily. To add a 
dynamic page to your Aspen powered site, you simply use the aforementioned 
simplates, which include python controllers and Tornado inspired templates in 
the same file. Aspen provides numerous service connectors, sodeployment can 
also be trivial.</p> 
<p>Another great feature of Aspen is its documentation. At first glance, the 
docs seem sparse and rather limited. However, they are well organized, and 
every page seems to answer every question I have on the topic succinctly and 
quickly. Chad seems to have a terrific minimalist policy of telling you exactly 
what you want to know in as few words as possible. As a writer, I know just how 
difficult this is to accomplish without repeating oneself.</p> 
<p>On the negative side, I do have misgivings as to how well Aspen&rsquo;s 
filesystem urls it can scale. Chad has assured me that Aspen is up for running 
large sites. I appreciate the power of regex urls, and I don&rsquo;t 
necessarily like having arbitrary file extensions in URLS. I think locators 
should be succinct and divorced from implementation details. Ideally, I believe 
there may be a happy medium between Aspen&rsquo;s enforced folder structure, 
and the overly-abstract and overly-complicated url scheme Django and its kin 
provide.</p> 
<p>Another downside is that I haven&rsquo;t figured out a good way to unit 
test Aspen simplates. You can refactor much of the code into backend libraries 
and test that, of course, or you can start the service running and mock 
requests. However, I miss the TestClient feature from Django that allows me to 
mock a request without running the server. It provides a better analysis of 
code coverage, and is closer to the actual code.</p> 
<p>Now, with the review over, I&rsquo;d like to introduce a little project 
I&rsquo;ve started to provide some vital features that Aspen core is missing.
<br> Trembling is kind of a catch-all project with a few basic helpers and a 
few useful projects. Namely, trembling provides:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Basic sessions</li> 
<li>Basic user authentication</li> 
<li>Less than basic single request messages</li> 
<li>A simple redirect response</li> </ul> 
<p>Aspen itself does not define or require a model layer; you&rsquo;re free to 
use the ORM, DBAPI connector, or NoSQL database of your choice. Trembling 
arbitrarily chooses mongoengine for the models. I made no effort to make 
pluggable backends like Django does; Aspen does not encourage excessive layers 
of abstraction.</p> 
<p>I also don&rsquo;t know how secure trembling&rsquo;s session and auth 
features are. If you find a security hole, pull requests are welcome. Overall, 
I think the combination of Trembling and Aspen will be very useful for my 
future basic sites. I would also like to try it on a more complicated project 
just to see how well it performs.</p>  Tags: aspen, python, web framework <br>

<h2>Easily changing virtualenvs</h2>  March 20, 2012, 3:26 am <br>

<p>The <code>workon</code> script available in virtualenvwrapper is a useful 
tool for switching virtual environments on the fly. However, it fails for the 
workflow I prefer, so I wrote my own.</p> 
<p>I prefer to keep my virtualenvs in the same folder as whatever source code 
or project they apply to. Normally, I put them in a folder named venv, although 
sometimes I use different names, most often when I have multiple virtualenvs 
applying to the same source tree (e.g. venv27, venvpypy).</p> 
<p>My directory structure therefore looks like this:</p> 
<pre> /home/dusty/code/ + project1 | + src | | + pkg1 | | + pkg2 | + doc | + 
venv + project2 | + src | + venv27 | + venvpypy + project3 | + venv</pre> 
<p>... and so on</p> 
<p>The problem is, I may be anywhere in the folder tree when I want to 
activate a virtualenv. This means I'm doing stuff like<code>. 
../../venv/bin/activate</code> one time and <code>venv/bin/activate</code> 
another time. Trying to remember which parent directory I want often requires 
several tab completions to see the directory listing. This is annoying. So I 
wrote a bash function to activate the optionally named virtualenv in the 
current directory or any parent directory.</p> 
<p>I avoid bash whenever I can, so this may not be the prettiest bash script 
you've ever seen. </p> 
<pre>function v { # activate a virtualenv # usage: v # activate the virtualenv 
named venv # usage: v venvname # activate the virtualenv named venvname name
=venvif [ $1 ] ; then name=$1 fi olddir=$(pwd) quit=0 deactivate &amp;amp;&amp;
gt;/dev/null cwd=$(pwd) while [ $quit -eq 0 ] do cd $cwd if [ $cwd == '/' ] ; 
then quit=1 fi if [ -e $name ] ; then source &quot;$name/bin/activate&quot; quit
=1 fi</pre> 
<p>Put this in your <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Typing <code>v</code> on the 
command line will look in the current and all parent directories for a 
directory named venv, and will activate that venv. Typing<code>v [venvname]
</code> will walk the same tree looking for a directory named [venvname] to 
activate.</p> 
<p>If you want to make it prettier, feel free to fork it on github.</p>  Tags:

<h2>Hacking on PyPy</h2>  March 17, 2012, 6:05 pm <br>

<p>In another great Pycon2012 keynote, David Beazely asked the question, 
&ldquo;is PyPy easily hackable?&rdquo; After a great talk, he answered with a 
decisive, &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Having sprinted on Python 
I&rsquo;d like to answer his question in a bit more detail.</p> 
<p>I love David&rsquo;s presentation style. He has a novel method of using 
phrases like, &ldquo;blow your mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is really 
scary&rdquo; repeatedly until they lose their meaning and you no longer feel 
mindblown or scared. A variety of factors, including Beazely&rsquo;s thorough 
keynote address motivated me to join the PyPy team during the Pycon developer 
sprints.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d like to clear up one oversight in Dave&rsquo;s otherwise 
impeachable talk. One of the PyPy devs,Holger Kregel explained to me that PyPy 
does not have over 1 million lines of code. I don&rsquo;t have exact numbers, 
but for &ldquo;historical reasons&rdquo;, a non-python file containing Base64 
encoded data was given a .py extension. When excluding this file from the line 
count, around half a million lines of actual Python code exist, and about a 
quarter of these are tests.</p> 
<p>I was surprised how trivial it was to get started hacking on PyPy. I 
don&rsquo;t really grok the many layers of the translation toolset and PyPy 
interpreter, but it&rsquo;s pretty clear that the layers are well separated. I 
was hacking on the py3k branch of PyPy. I am happy to admit I was working 
primarily on changing<code>print</code> statements to <code>print()</code> 
functions and commas in exceptions to the<code>as</code> keyword.</p> 
<p>Here are the steps to start hacking on PyPy. Notice that the hour-long 
translation step is not part of the procedure. PyPy has a solid test framework, 
and the PyPy crew are focused on a 100% test-driven-development paradigm.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Clone pypy (this takes a while): 
<pre>hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/</pre> </li> 
<li>Pick a branch to work on. There are about 80 branches. I don&rsquo;t know 
what they all do. Popular ones during the sprints included py3k and 
numpy-ufuncs2</li> 
<li>Pick a feature to work on. For py3k support, the list of failing tests in 
thebuildbot is a good place to start. Numpy programmers had a list of fuctions 
that needed implementing, but I can&rsquo;t find the link. Ask on IRC, the PyPy 
crew are very helpful. Thebug tracker contains many features and issues that 
need addressing</li> 
<li>Add <code>/path/to/pypy/</code> to your path so you can run the <code>
pytest.py</code> command</li> 
<li>cd into the directory indicated in the buildbot output and run <code>
pytest.py path/to/test.py -k testname</code></li> 
<li>The test will likely fail. Hack away and fix it.</li> 
<li>When the test passes, commit, push to a bitbucket repo, and issue a pull 
request.</li> 
<li>Repeat!</li> 
<p>There are quite a few cons to working on this project. If you run hg in the 
pypy/modules/ directory, it will try to pick standard library modules from pypy 
and choke horribly. The pypy developers don&rsquo;t really believe in 
documenting their code. Being able to tell the difference between rpython and 
python (which have identical syntax) is important. In general, if a module 
starts with &ldquo;interp_&rdquo; it contains rpython, but if it starts with 
&ldquo;app_&rdquo; it contains python. The code does not appear to be 
well-documented.</p> 
<p>If you are hacking on Python 3 support, you need to bear in mind that the 
PyPy interpreter is written in Python 2. You are working on a Python 2 
application that executes Python 3 bytecode!</p> 
<p>On the positive side, rPython and Python are much easier to read and write 
than C. The PyPy devs are brilliant, but not intimidating. They are so 
confident in their test suite that they are comfortable programming in a 
&ldquo;cowboy coding&rdquo; style, hacking randomly until all the tests pass. 
Any one layer in the toolchain is easy to understand and develop. The IRC 
channel is full of friendly, knowledgable, helpful people at any time of day.
</p> 
<p>Overall, I am much less intimidated by this project than I was before I 
started the dev sprints. I still can&rsquo;t answer the, &ldquo;Is Python 
easily hackable?&rdquo; question fully. It&rsquo;s certainly easy to get 
started, but I don&rsquo;t know how easy it is to become intimate with the 
project. Dave Beazely&rsquo;s keynote made PyPy more approachable, and I 
approached it. Hopefully this article will encourage you to do the same.</p>

<h2>Why we need Python in the Browser</h2>  March 13, 2012, 10:49 pm <br>

<p>In his Pycon 2012 keynote speech on Sunday, Guido van Rossum covered many 
of the open &ldquo;Troll&rdquo; questions related to the Python community. 
I&rsquo;ve had occasion to either complain about or defend all of the topics he 
covered, and he did a wonderful job of addressing them. The issues could 
largely be divided into two categories: those that come from a fundamental 
misunderstanding of why Python is wonderful (e.g. whitespace), and those that 
are not an issue for the core python dev team, but are being actively worked on 
outside of core Python (e.g event loop).</p> 
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the question of supporting Python in the web 
browser. I honestly thought I was the only one that cared about this issue, but 
apparently enough people have complained about it that Guido felt a need to 
address it. His basic assertion is that the browsers aren&rsquo;t going to 
support this because nobody uses it and that nobody uses it because the 
browsers don&rsquo;t support it.</p> 
<p>This is a political problem. Politics shouldn&rsquo;t impact technical 
awesomeness.</p> 
<p>The fallacious underlying assumption here is that modern HTML applications 
must be supported on all web browsers in order to be useful. This is no longer 
true. Web browser applications are not necessarily deployed to myriad unknown 
clients. In a way, HTML 5, CSS 3, and DOM manipulation have emerged as a de 
facto standard MVC and GUI system. For example, many mobile apps are developed 
with HTML 5 interfaces that are rendered by a packaged web library rather than 
an unknown browser. Client side local storage has created fully Javascript 
applications that require no or optional network connectivity. There are even 
situations where it may not be necessary to sandbox the code because it&rsquo;s 
trusted. Many developers create personal or private projects using HTMl 5 
because it&rsquo;s convenient.</p> 
<p>Convenient. It would be more convenient if we could code these projects in 
Python. Web browsers can be viewed as a zero install interface, a virtual 
machine for these applications. Such a VM has no reason to be language 
dependent.</p> 
<p>It is simply unfair to all the other programming languages and coders of 
those languages to say, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t displace Javascript, so we 
won&rsquo;t try.&rdquo; Web browsers have evolved into a virtualization layer 
more like operating systems than single programs. While it is true that the 
most restrictive operating systems only permit us to code in Objective C, in 
general, it is not considerate to restrict your developers a single language or 
environment.</p> 
<p>It is time (in fact, long overdue) for Python to be supported in the 
browser, not necessarily as an equal to Javascript, but as an alternative. The 
web is a platform, and we must take Guido&rsquo;s statement as a call to 
improve this platform, not to give up on it.</p> 
<p>Update: I just stumbled across http://www.gnu.org/software/pythonwebkit/ 
and I can&rsquo;t wait to play with it!</p> 
<p>Update 2: From the number of comments on this article, it appears that my 
article has hit some web aggregator. To those users suggesting python to 
javascript compilers, I&rsquo;ve been aminor contributor to the pyjaco project, 
a rewrite of the pyjs library. It has the potential to be a great tool, and the 
head developer, Christian Iversen is very open to outside contributions. 
Let&rsquo;s make it better!</p>  Tags: pycon, python, webapp <br>

<h2>Pyjaco in a real app: Todos with local storage</h2>  January 8, 2012, 
10:15 pm <br>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get the memo, but there appears to be a movement to 
demonstrate emerging web technologies with a simple todo list application, much 
as hello world is used to introduce programming languages.</p> 
<p>In my last post, I introduced using jQuery with Pyjaco, the PYthon 
JAvascript COmpiler. Since then, I&rsquo;ve made severalcontributions to the 
project and have been involved in diverse discussions with Pyjaco developers 
regarding the current and future status of the project. This post goes further 
by acting as a tutorial for writing a basic todos app using Pyjaco.</p> 
<p>Pyjaco is alpha software. It is hard to write valid code, and harder to 
debug. I&rsquo;ve managed to both lock up Firefox and hard crash it while using 
the Pyjaco library.</p> 
<p>On the positive side, Pyjaco is under active, rapid development. The head 
developer,Christian Iversen is extremely responsive to both questions about 
Pyjaco, and to code contributions. This is a project with a lot of potential, 
and I see it as the current best bet for Python programmers hoping to avoid 
javascript one day in the future.</p> 
<p>In spite of the hiccups, it is possible to generate a working javascript 
app using just Pyjaco. Here&rsquo;s how.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s start:</p> 
<pre>mkdir pyjados cd pyjados virtualenv2 venv --distribute --no-site-packages 
source venv/bin/activate pip install git+https://buchuki@github.com/buchuki/
pyjaco.git@run_script</pre> 
<p>First we create a directory to work in and install a virtualenv. Pyjaco 
does not currently work with python 3, so in Arch Linux, I use the virtualenv2 
command. We then activate the virtualenv and install the pyjaco package. Here I 
am installing from my personal fork, as it contains some changes for generating 
the built-in standard library that have not yet been merged upstream. You 
should normally install directly from chrivers&rsquo;s git repository using
<code>pip install git+git://github.com/chrivers/pyjaco.git</code>.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s create a basic HTML 5 page with jQuery loaded:</p> 
<pre> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;PyJaco Todo 
List Example&lt;/title&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
src=&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;PyJaco Todo List Example&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</pre> 
<p>We can load this in our web browser using a file:// URL. This is the only 
HTML page in our app, and it can be refreshed to load our changes as we work.
</p> 
<p>Pyjaco doesn&rsquo;t simply translate Python into Javascript. Rather, it 
creates a basic standard library of Python-like objects that are utilized in 
the compiled javascript code. I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on this idea when I first 
heard it, as it introduces a dependency that currently weighs in at 65K before 
minification and compression. While this is not a terribly heavy library, there 
are efforts under way to shrink the builtins or to dynamically generate it to 
contain only those builtins that your code actually touches. At any rate, we 
need to ensure this library is available to our code. First we generate the 
library:</p> 
<pre>pyjs.py --builtins=generate --output=py-builtins.js</pre> 
<p><code>pyjs.py</code> is the name of the pyjaco command. It is expected to 
be renamed to pyjaco in the future. The<code>--builtins=generate</code> option 
tells pyjaco to generate the standard library, while the<code>--output</code> 
flag provides the filename for the new library file:</p> 
<pre>$ ls index.html py-builtins.js venv</pre> 
<p>We then need to load this library in the head of our html file. Let&rsquo;s 
also load the future<code>pyjados.js</code> script at this time:</p> 
<pre> &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;PyJaco Todo List Example&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
src=&quot;http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; 
src=&quot;py-builtins.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script 
type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;pyjados.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt;</pre> 
<p>Now, before we start coding the Python file that will be compiled to 
Javascript, I want to discuss what I consider to be the most confusing aspect 
of Pyjaco development. There are basically two types of variables in Pyjaco, 
Javascript variables, and Python variables. Javascript variables refer to 
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; variables that you would call in Javascript. These include
<code>alert</code>, <code>window</code>, <code>document</code> and the like, as 
well as variables in third-party Javascript libraries, such as the ubiquitous
<code>jQuery</code>. Further, any attributes on those objects are also 
Javascript variables, and the return value of any methods will also be 
Javascript variables.</p> 
<p>Python variables, on the other hand, refer to any variables that you define 
in your Python source code. If you create a dict or a list, for example, it 
will be compiled to a list or dict object from the standard library we just 
generated. In the compiled script, of course these Python variables are 
represented by Javascript objects, but from the point of view of a Pyjaco 
coder, it is important to keep the two types of files separate. Almost all the 
bugs I have encountered in my Pyjaco code have been caused by confusing the two 
types of variables.</p> 
<p>The distinction between python and javascript variables introduces a couple 
of complications to writing Pyjaco compatible python code. First we need to 
flag all of our Javascript variables using a decorator on methods that access 
them. Second, we need to explicitly convert our variables between Javascript 
and Python any time we access one from the other. I&rsquo;m told that this 
conversion can &mdash; and one day will &mdash; be done automatically by the 
pyjaco multiplexer, but in the meantime, we need to make it explicit. We do 
this by using two javascript functions supplied with the standard library we 
just generated, appropriately named<code>js()</code> and <code>py()</code>. You 
will see examples of these shortly.</p> 
<p>When I finally figured out the distinction, my first thought was, 
&ldquo;ok, let&rsquo;s prefer to always work with python variables.&rdquo; 
Therefore, in my initialization code, I tried<code>jQ=py(jQuery)</code>. 
Unfortunately, jQuery is a rather large object, and the<code>py</code> function 
apparently recursively converts all attributes from javascript to python. I 
ended up with a stack overflow.</p> 
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s create our first python code and watch it compile to 
Javascript. Name the file<code>pyjados.py</code>:</p> 
<pre>def setup(): print &quot;Pyjados Hello World&quot; &nbsp; jQuery(js(setup)
);</pre> 
<p>First we write a python function named <code>setup</code>. This function is 
a python object.<code>jQuery</code> is a javascript object that expects a 
javascript object as input. Therefore, we wrap<code>setup</code> in a <code>js()
</code> call and pass the result into the jQuery function. jQuery will now run 
<code>setup</code> when <code>document.ready</code> is fired.</p> 
<p>Now we compile the code using the following command inside our activated 
virtualenv:</p> 
<pre>pyjs.py --watch pyjados.py --output pyjados.js</pre> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the command doesn&rsquo;t exit. That is the <code>
--watch</code> option at work. If you now make a change to <code>pyjados.py
</code> and save it, it will automatically recompile it. The output file <code>
pyjados.js</code> is regenerated each time. This is the file we included in our 
html file. So now, open that html file in a web browser using a<code>file://
</code> url. Make sure the Javascript console is displayed and reload the page. 
You should see the words &ldquo;Pyjados Hello World&rdquo; printed on the 
console. Pyjaco automatically compiles<code>print</code> statements into <code>
console.log</code> output.</p> 
<p>Before we start implementing our Todo list, let&rsquo;s look at an example 
of accessing a javascript variable inside a function. Change<code>setup.py
</code> to utilize <code>alert</code>, as follows:</p> 
<pre>&nbsp; @JSVar(&quot;alert&quot;) def setup(): alert(js(&quot;Pyjados 
Hello Alert&quot;) &nbsp; jQuery(js(setup));</pre> 
<p>Did you look closely at that code? There is a missing close bracket on the 
alert line. You&rsquo;ll see the syntax error in your console where pyjs.py is 
watching the compiled code. Add the bracket and let it automatically recompile 
itself:</p> 
<pre>&nbsp; @JSVar(&quot;alert&quot;) def setup(): alert(js(&quot;Pyjados 
Hello Alert&quot;)) &nbsp; jQuery(js(setup));</pre> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze this snippet. First, notice how we told the compiler 
that<code>alert</code> is a Javascript variable when used inside <code>setup()
</code>. This is a bit odd, since the JSVar decorator is never actually 
imported into the namespace. This is a bit of magic in the Pyjaco compiler, 
just pretend it has been imported.</p> 
<p>Second, notice that since <code>alert</code> has been flagged as a JSVar, 
it must accept a Javascript variable. However, the string &ldquo;Pyjados Hello 
Alert&rdquo; is a Python variable. Therefore, we convert it using<code>js()
</code> as we pass it into the <code>alert</code> call.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s prepare to create some working todo-list code. Start by 
adding a form for submitting todos and a list to render the todos to the html 
body:</p> 
<pre> &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;PyJaco Todo List Example&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;form 
id=&quot;add_todo_form&quot;&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; 
id=&quot;add_box&quot; placeholder=&quot;Add Todo&quot;, 
autofocus=&quot;autofocus&quot;&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;add_button&quot;&gt;Add 
Todo&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/form&gt; &lt;ul 
id=&quot;todo_items&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</pre> 
<p>Nothing too exciting here. Note the ids on the elements, since we&rsquo;ll 
be utilizing these from Pyjaco using jQuery selectors.</p> 
<p>Now back into the python file. Let&rsquo;s create a class to manage the 
various todo elements:</p> 
<pre>class TodosApp: @JSVar(&quot;jQuery&quot;, &quot;js_add_form&quot;) def 
__init__(self): js_add_form = jQuery(js(&quot;#add_todo_form&quot;)) 
js_add_form.submit(js(self.add_todo)) &nbsp; def add_todo(self, event): print 
&quot;form submitted&quot; return js(False) &nbsp; def setup(): todo_app = 
TodosApp() &nbsp; jQuery(js(setup));</pre> 
<p>The <code>__init__</code> function hooks up the form&rsquo;s submit button 
to a method on the object. Notice that we need to flag not just<code>jQuery
</code>, but also <code>js_add_form</code> as a javascript variable. Pyjaco 
does not (currently) know that a javascript variable is returned when calling a 
method on an existing javascript variable. I like to add the<code>js_</code> 
prefix to variable names to help remind myself that this is a javascript 
variable.</p> 
<p>In an ideal world, we could convert this variable to a Python variable using
<code>py()</code>, but as noted earlier, calling <code>py</code> on a jQuery 
object results in a stack overflow or browser crash.</p> 
<p>Also pay attention to the way we wrap the <code>self.add_todo</code> method 
name in a<code>js()</code> call when we pass it into the <code>submit</code> 
handler. The<code>submit</code> method is a javascript function expecting a 
javascript object.</p> 
<p>The <code>def add_todo</code> method has its single parameter flagged as a 
<code>@JSVar</code>, since the method is being called internally by jQuery when 
the event occurs. We also wrap the<code>False</code> return value (to prevent 
event propogation on the submit handler) in a<code>js()</code> call so that 
jQuery recognizes it as a javascript<code>false</code> rather than a (true) 
object named<code>False</code>.</p> 
<p>Try the code. Ensure the compiler recompiled it, and reload the html file. 
Enter some characters into the text box and use the<code>Enter</code> key or the
<code>Add Todo</code> button to submit the form. The words <code>form submitted
</code> should be displayed in the javascript console.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s actually store and render a newly added todo. The todos are 
stored in memory in a python dict object. Initialize this object by adding the 
following two lines of code to the end of<code>__init__</code>:</p> 
<pre> self.todos = {} self.next_id = 1</pre> 
<p>And rewrite <code>add_todo</code> as follows as well as a new method named 
<code>render</code></p> 
<pre> @JSVar(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;js_add_box&quot;) def add_todo(self, 
js_event): js_add_box = jQuery(js(&quot;#add_box&quot;)) self.todos[self.next_id
] = py(js_add_box.val()) js_add_box.val('') js_add_box.focus() self.next_id += 1
self.render() return js(False) &nbsp; @JSVar(&quot;js_todo_items&quot;) def 
render(self): js_todo_items = jQuery(js(&quot;#todo_items&quot;)) js_todo_items.
html(&quot;&quot;) for id, todo in sorted(self.todos.items()): js_todo_items.
append(js('&lt;li&gt;%s&lt;/li&gt;' % (id, todo)))</pre> 
<p>Note that the <code>todos</code> dict is a Python object, so when we insert 
the value of the<code>js_add_box</code> into it, we must convert it from a 
javascript object using<code>py()</code>. Also note how, because we are writing 
in a python function, manipulating the python value<code>self.next_id</code> 
requires no conversion, and calling the python function<code>self.render</code> 
is also clean.</p> 
<p>In the render function itself, I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool that string 
formatting using % is supported by pyjaco (as an aside, the str.format method 
introduced in python 2.6 is not yet available) and that the python<code>sorted()
</code> function is available. Note also how we can loop over <code>items()
</code> on the <code>self.todos</code> dictionary just as if we were using a 
normal python dictionary.</p> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s add the ability to complete todos. Let&rsquo;s start by 
adding a template string as a class variable, and use that string inside the 
render function. This illustrates that pyjaco supports class variables:</p> 
<pre>class TodosApp: list_item_template = &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;li&gt; 
%(text)s &lt;/li&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;</pre> 
<p>and we change the for loop in <code>render</code> to:</p> 
<pre> for id, todo in sorted(self.todos.items()): js_todo_items.append(js(
TodosApp.list_item_template % { &quot;id&quot;: id, &quot;text&quot;: todo}))
</pre> 
<p>Reload the page again and notice how checkboxes have been displayed beside 
each todo. The next step is to make clicking these boxes actually complete the 
todos. We add a couple lines to our<code>__init__</code> method to connect a 
live click event to the checkbox items, which now looks like this:</p> 
<pre> @JSVar(&quot;jQuery&quot;, &quot;js_add_form&quot;, 
&quot;js_checkbox&quot;) def __init__(self): js_add_form = jQuery(js(
&quot;#add_todo_form&quot;)) js_add_form.submit(js(self.add_todo)) js_checkbox 
= jQuery(js(&quot;input[type=checkbox]&quot;)) js_checkbox.live(
&quot;click&quot;, js(self.complete_todo)) self.todos = {} self.next_id = 1
</pre> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to add <code>js_checkbox</code> to the <code>JSVar</code>
 decorator.</p> 
<p>The <code>complete_todo</code> method looks like this:</p> 
<pre> @JSVar(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;jQuery&quot;, &quot;todo_item&quot;) def 
complete_todo(self, event): todo_item = jQuery(event.target).parent() id = int(
py(todo_item.attr(&quot;id&quot;))[5:]) del self.todos[id] todo_item.delay(1500)
.fadeOut(&quot;slow&quot;)</pre> 
<p>The first line is using exclusively javascript arguments, and returns the 
<code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element containing the checkbox that was clicked. The 
<code>id =</code> line converts the javascript string id attribute of this 
element (which looks like &ldquo;<code>todo_5</code>&ldquo;, as defined in 
<code>list_item_template</code>) into the python integer id of the todo. The 
remaining lines simply remove that todo from the internal list and from the 
DOM, after a 1.5 second delay.</p> 
<p>In fact, we now have a fully functional todo list that allows adding todos 
and checking them off. Now, as a bonus, let&rsquo;s try hooking this up to the 
HTML 5<code>localStorage</code> object so that the list is maintained across 
page reloads. We start by adding a<code>store()</code> method to our class:</p> 
<pre> @JSVar(&quot;localStorage&quot;, &quot;JSON&quot;) def store(self): 
localStorage.setItem(&quot;todolist&quot;, JSON.stringify(js(self.todos)))</pre>
<p>The main line of code is easiest to read from the inside out. First we 
convert the<code>self.todos</code> dict to a normal javascript object using the 
<code>js()</code> function. Then we call <code>JSON.stringify</code> on this 
object to create a string suitable for insertion into<code>localStorage</code>.
</p> 
<p>Now add this call to the end of the two methods that manipulate the todo 
list,<code>add_todo</code> and <code>complete_todo</code>:</p> 
<pre> self.store()</pre> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>Refresh the page, add a couple todos, and inspect the <code>localStorage
</code> object in your console. You should see the stringified dict in the 
<code>todolist</code> value.</p> 
<p>Now all we have to do is ensure the <code>self.todos</code> dict is loaded 
from<code>localStorage</code> when the app is initialized. Add the following to 
the end of the<code>__init__</code> method (make sure to add <code>
js_stored_todos</code> to the <code>JSVars</code> decorator):</p> 
<pre> js_stored_todos = localStorage.getItem(&quot;todolist&quot;) &nbsp; if 
js_stored_todos: stored_dict =dict(py(JSON.parse(js_stored_todos))) self.todos =
dict([(int(i), stored_dict[i]) for i in stored_dict.keys()]) self.next_id = max(
self.todos.keys()) + 1 &nbsp; self.render()</pre> 
<p>Note that calling <code>py()</code> on the output of <code>JSON.parse</code>
 creates a python object, not a python dict. The code is therefore wrapped in a 
call to<code>dict()</code>, which converts the object to a dictionary.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, the resultant dict contains keys that are strings, whereas 
our original dict used integer keys. So a pure-python list comprehension is 
used to convert the dictionary to one with integer keys. This line is a bit 
hard to read, but I wanted to include it to demonstrate that Pyjaco can parse 
list comprehensions. Finally, we set<code>self.next_id</code> using the python 
<code>max()</code> call, which Pyjaco also automatically translates into 
javascript.</p> 
<p>Try it out. Load the pyjados HTML file, add some todos, check a few of them 
off, then close and reload the web browser. Your todos will be stored!</p> 
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this introduction to Pyjaco. It is a nice tool 
with a lot of potential. Currently, I find writing Pyjaco code to be 
approximately equally tedious to writing Javascript code. However, I feel that 
as I learn the ins and outs of Pyjaco, and as the developers continue to refine 
and improve the compiler, Pyjaco may one day be a perfectly viable alternative 
to writing pure Javascript or to the rather too Ruby-esque, but otherwise 
excellent Coffeescript.</p>  Tags: pyjaco, python, todos, web development <br>

<h2>pyjaco and jQuery</h2>  December 27, 2011, 10:53 pm <br>

<p>After giving up on CoffeeScript, I decided to play around with Pyjaco the 
Python to Javascript Compiler.</p> 
<p>While the code is readable, there is very little in the way of end-user 
documentation. I hope to address this with this blog post. The Pyjaco examples 
all embed generated javascript in an html page. I needed a way to generate an 
external Javascript file as I would include in an HTML file. I also wanted to 
find out if I could use Pyjaco with jQuery.</p> 
<p>The first step was to install a development version of Pyjaco:</p> 
<pre>git clone https://github.com/chrivers/pyjaco.git</pre> 
<p>Pyjaco normally requires a generated Javascript file mapping Python 
builtins to Javascript to be included with the created Javascripts. This must 
be generated:</p> 
<pre>cd pyjaco python2 generate_library.py cp py-builtins.js ~/pyjaco_test # 
directory for my new page</pre> 
<p>The next step was to create an HTML file that included jquery, the 
py-builtins.js script above, and a yet-to be defined javascript file named 
clicker.js that will be generated from a yet-to-be-defined python file. I also 
add a couple of DOM elements (a heading and paragraph) that are to be 
manipulated via jQuery:</p> 
<p> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
 &lt;html&gt;<br>
 &lt;head&gt;<br>
 &lt;script 
type=&rdquo;text/javascript&rdquo; 
src=&rdquo;jquery-1.6.4.min.js&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
 &lt;script 
type=&rdquo;text/javascript&rdquo; 
src=&rdquo;py-builtins.js&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
 &lt;script 
type=&rdquo;text/javascript&rdquo; 
src=&rdquo;clicker.js&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
 &lt;/head&gt;<br>
 
&lt;body&gt;<br>
 &lt;h1&gt;Click me&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
 &lt;p 
id=&rdquo;when_clicked&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
 &lt;/body&gt;<br>
 
&lt;/html&gt;</p> 
<p> That&rsquo;s the easy part. Writing python code that compiles to correct 
Javascript is the hard part. Pyjaco doesn&rsquo;t currently provide very useful 
compile-time errors, and it also does not yet map javascript errors back to the 
input python.</p> 
<p> There are (at least) two ways to compile python code in Pyjaco. The first, 
which is used in the Pyjaco examples, and appears to be the preferred method at 
this time is to create a custom<code>main()</code> method that uses various 
<code>pyjaco.Compiler</code> methods to combine the functions into a string of 
text. Seehttps://github.com/chrivers/pyjaco/tree/devel/examples for three 
examples.</p> 
<p> However, I was looking to have a complete python file that compiles to a 
complete javascript file. Pyjaco supports this as well, using the provided 
pyjs.py script. It took some investigating to understand how to reference 
javascript variables inside python functions. Decorator syntax is used to 
expose the variables for<code>jQuery</code>, <code>Math.random</code>, and 
<code>Math.floor</code> in the following example. The mystifying bit is that 
because we will be compiling this file to javascript as a string, it is not 
necessary (or possible) to import the<code>JSVar</code> decorator, as was done 
in the Pyjaco examples linked above.</p> 
<pre># clicker.py @JSVar(&quot;jQuery&quot;) def ready(): jQuery('h1').click(
on_click) &nbsp; @JSVar(&quot;jQuery&quot;, &quot;Math.random&quot;, 
&quot;Math.floor&quot;) def on_click(): if jQuery('#when_clicked').html(): r = 
Math.floor(Math.random() * 255) g = Math.floor(Math.random() * 255) b = Math.
floor(Math.random() * 255) color = &quot;rgb(%d, %d, %d)&quot; %(r,g,b) jQuery(
'#when_clicked').attr('style', 'background-color: ' + color) else: jQuery(
'#when_clicked').html(&quot;you clicked it!&quot;) &nbsp; jQuery(ready)</pre> 
<p> Notice that I&rsquo;m using the jQuery function instead of the $ alias, 
since $ is not a valid variable name in Python. This is a rather odd looking 
mix of Python and Javascript functions, but it works.</p> 
<p> I had to repeat the compile and test step a few times before coming up 
with the above file. The script can be compiled using the pyjs.py that comes 
with the pyjaco source distribution (and, thanks to asimple patch I submitted, 
will come with the binary distribution in the next release.) Here&rsquo;s how 
the script is run:</p> 
<pre>python2 ~/code/pyjaco/pyjs.py -N --output clicker.js clicker.py</pre> 
<p> The -N option tells pyjs not to generate the builtin library that we 
created manually in the first step.</p> 
<p> This translation step creates a <code>clicker.js</code> file that looks 
like this:</p> 
<pre>var ready = function() { var __kwargs = __kwargs_get(arguments); var 
__varargs= __varargs_get(arguments); var $v1 = Array.prototype.slice.call(
arguments).concat(js(__varargs)); jQuery(&quot;h1&quot;).click(on_click); return
 None; } var on_click = function() { var __kwargs = __kwargs_get(arguments); var
 __varargs= __varargs_get(arguments); var $v2 = Array.prototype.slice.call(
arguments).concat(js(__varargs)); if (bool(jQuery(&quot;#when_clicked&quot;).
html()) === True) { var r = Math.floor((Math.random()) * (255)); var g = Math.
floor((Math.random()) * (255)); var b = Math.floor((Math.random()) * (255)); var
 color= str('rgb(%d, %d, %d)').PY$__mod__(tuple([r, g, b])); jQuery(
&quot;#when_clicked&quot;).attr(&quot;style&quot;, (&quot;background-color: 
&quot;) + (color)); } else { jQuery(&quot;#when_clicked&quot;).html(&quot;you 
clicked it!&quot;); } return None; } jQuery(ready);</pre> 
<p> I find this rather unfortunately difficult to read. There is code for 
argument parsing that would not have been needed if I had hand-written 
javascript. Further the use of &ldquo;mock&rdquo; python builtins makes the 
javascript look less javascripty. However, the original python file looks much 
more readable than an equivalent javascript one would. I am hopeful that 
improvements to pyjaco will cause it to generate more readable javascript with 
less extraneous code.</p> 
<p> The entire example can be found on my github fork </p> 
<p> Christian Iversen is actively working on Pyjaco right now. I am excited 
about this project and hope that further community involvement will help it 
evolve into a practical and useful tool. I intend my next patch to be an 
autocompile tool that monitors files in one directory for change and outputs 
.js files in another directory, one of CoffeeScript&rsquo;s killer features. I 
am also considering a port to Python 3.</p>  Tags: javascript, jquery, pyjaco,

<h2>I can&rsquo;t use CoffeeScript</h2>  December 27, 2011, 5:45 pm <br>

<p>I had some space between wrapping up my last contract on December 20, and 
starting my new job on January 16. I decided it was finally time to build a 
simple task management system, something I&rsquo;ve attempted to do and never 
finished several times before. I currently use RememberTheMilk, which is a 
lovely service, but I don&rsquo;t like paying them for mobile access. Further, 
even though I trust this small company, I see no reason to share intimate 
information about the tasks I accomplish every day with them. My long term goal 
is to pull as much of my personal data out of the cloud as I possibly can. This 
project is a step towards that goal.</p> 
<p>There are numerous open source task manager apps out there that I&rsquo;m 
sure would suit my not-too-exotic tastes. However, I also wanted to take this 
opportunity to learn a bunch of new technologies for an offline-enabled and 
mobile-enabled web application.</p> 
<p>Therefore, I&rsquo;ve spent most of my vacation time so far researching 
some technologies I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to explore in the past year.
JQuery Mobile was at the top of the list. I think it&rsquo;s a lovely framework 
and I expect to continue using it.</p> 
<p>I also wanted to try out CoffeeScript, as I&rsquo;ve always hated writing 
Javascript, and I wanted to use some sort of client-side ORM for localstorage. 
I looked at backbone.js, but was more attracted toSpine.js. I have spent three 
days studying and playing with these two technologies. I am still undecided 
about Spine.js, but I have come to the conclusion that CoffeeScript is not for 
me.</p> 
<p>I understand all the hype around the project. JavaScript really does suck. 
And CoffeeScript does suck less, it has pretty language features and it is much 
more succinct than JavaScript. I can imagine a lot of people being really 
excited about CofeeScript, especially Ruby and PERL programmers, and possibly 
even php programmers.</p> 
<p>But not Python programmers. I tried to learn Ruby several times, and each 
time I was left with a foul taste in my mouth. It&rsquo;s not a bad language, 
it just doesn&rsquo;t fit in well with my personal philosophy. My personal 
philosophy happens to coincide almost exactly with theZen Of Python. I chose 
Python because it matched my philosophy&hellip; not the other way around.</p> 
<p>Like Ruby and PERL, CoffeeScript violently violates what I consider the 
most important rule of Python: &ldquo;There should be one &mdash; and 
preferably only one &mdash; obvious way to do it.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not going to 
argue why this is a good idea, I understand that some programmers prefer the 
&ldquo;even if I don&rsquo;t understand it, I can write code that will probably 
work&rdquo; paradigm that Ruby promotes.</p> 
<p>The simple truth is, writing CoffeeScript leaves me feeling like I&rsquo;ve 
done something dirty, no less dirty than writing JavaScript. There is no 
incentive for me to add a layer of complexity (the CoffeeScript to JavaScript 
compile step) to my code when I know my code is going to be &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; 
either way.</p> 
<p>CoffeeScript is a wonderful idea. It&rsquo;s far better than JavaScript. 
It&rsquo;s just not good enough. Luckily, the Python community is already 
working on pythonic answers, including the evilly poorly documentedpyjaco and 
the less-than-well maintainedpyvascript and pyjamas projects. I hope one of 
these or a new upstart will soon gain community momentum so frontend 
development is no longer painful.</p>  Tags: coffeescript, javascript, offline,

<h2>Finally happy with folding in vim (or how to get an overview of a python 
file)</h2>  August 31, 2011, 9:56 am <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always found vim folding to be somewhat mysterious. No matter 
which of the foldmethods I used, it seemed like it was always too tedious or 
too manual.</p> 
<p>Today, while editing a python file over a remote connection that has high 
enough latency to interfere with rapidly scrolling through the file, I finally 
set out to solve this problem. My goal was to get an overview of the file. Yes, 
there are plugins or ctags to do this, but I don&rsquo;t have ctags installed 
and have tried different plugins that didn&rsquo;t really work as I wanted.</p> 
<p>Indent folding does essentially what I want; when all folds are closed, I 
can see the overview of classes and module-level methods in the python module. 
When they are open, I see the whole file. I always felt that Indent mode should 
be ideal with whitespace-driven python, but in the past, I found that the 
default settings left far too many folds to work with.</p> 
<p>I already new about the <code>foldminlines</code> setting which only 
creates a fold if more than a specific number of lines is displayed. But today, 
I discovered<code>foldnestmax</code>.</p> 
<p>This setting is the maximum number of folds in the file. In a python file, 
if I set it to 1, folding happens only at the classes or module-level functions 
in the module. If I set it to two, it happens at each method in each class. I 
don&rsquo;t get a bunch of internal folds that I don&rsquo;t want.</p> 
<p>Another setting that I discovered today is <code>foldlevelstart</code>. If 
set to<code>99</code>, opening a new file will always have all the folds 
expanded, which is what I want.</p> 
<p>So now I have exactly what I want: a few top-level folds are created 
automatically based on indentation, but I don&rsquo;t have to fuss with 
interior indentation in other folds. Now I needed a refresher on how best to 
interact with these folds.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>zM</strong> <em>Close All Folds</em> Switch to 
&ldquo;overview&rdquo; mode</li> 
<li><strong>zR</strong> <em>Open All Folds</em> Switch to normal editing</li> 
<li><strong>zo</strong> <em>Open Fold</em> Open the class or method under the 
cursor</li> 
<li><strong>zc</strong> <em>Close Fold</em> Close the class method I&rsquo;m 
currently editing</li> </ol> 
<p>The last one is the most useful, because it works from anywhere in the 
method. If I&rsquo;m done with that method, I just<code>zc</code> and 
it&rsquo;s hidden from site. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about collapsing 
multiple levels of indentation or creating manual folds. It just works.</p> 
<p>There are other fold commands; see <code>:help fold</code> for an overview, 
but just using these settings and memorizing these four commands seems to be 
all I need.</p> 
<p>I suspect that javascript would also work well using a foldnestmax of 1. 
HTML would probably not work as well since normally the entire body is the top 
level of intent. Perhaps a foldnestmax of 2 or 3 would be helpful here. 
Luckily, I can change these values on per filetype basis using<code>autocmd
</code>.</p>  Tags: folding, python, vim <br>
