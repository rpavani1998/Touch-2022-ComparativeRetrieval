<blockquote> 
<p>I think a lot about choices and decisions at startups.&nbsp; That is the 
life of a software entrerpreneur:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;stready stream of 
hard work, occasionally&nbsp;punctuated by some really hard decisions.&nbsp; 
The decisions that are hardest are<em>not</em> the ones where you have the 
least amount of information &mdash;&nbsp;they are&nbsp;the ones that are 
hardest to undo or reverse.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By this defintiion, picking the language/platform to use at a startup is 
one of the harder decisions.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s<em>very </em>hard&nbsp;to change 
this decision.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the story of how I made not<em>one </em>but 
<em>two</em> big language/platform decisions, neither of which really worked 
out &mdash; and which I&rsquo;m now paying the price for.&nbsp; The good news 
is that the company did very well despite these mistakes for two simple 
reasons:&nbsp; First, I didn&rsquo;t make<em>awful</em> choices &mdash; just 
sub-optimal ones.&nbsp; Second, success in the early days of a startup is much 
more about getting market validation and traction than anything else.&nbsp; 
And, as it turns out, customers really don&rsquo;t care whether your SaaS 
application is built in PHP, C#, Ruby or Python.</p> 
<p><strong>On with my story&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>When I kicked off my startup, HubSpot, over 4 years ago (June, 2006) I 
wrote a set of articles on the topic of choosing a language/platform &mdash; 
specifically for startups.&nbsp; At the time, I was trying to pick between C# 
and Python for my then fledgling startup.&nbsp; The article was aptly titled, 
&ldquo;Python vs. C#: Business and Technology Tradeoffs&rdquo;.&nbsp; The 
article was very widely read, and still continues to drive traffic (likely 
because&nbsp;it ranks #1 in Google for &ldquo;Python vs C#&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>I made some pretty good arguments in that article, most of which I still 
stand behind to this day.&nbsp; We ended up picking C# at the time.&nbsp; The 
decision came down to&nbsp;one strong, dominant&nbsp;factor:&nbsp; I was more 
productive in C# than I was in anything else, and that mattered &mdash; a 
lot.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it was basically just me.&nbsp; In the early days 
of a startup, you&rsquo;re looking to mitigate unnecessary risk and get to 
market as fast as humanly possible.&nbsp; Within reason, my general advice 
is&nbsp; &ldquo;go with what you know&rdquo;.&nbsp; By &ldquo;within 
reason&rdquo;, I mean if what you know is a relatively mainstream language 
(Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, C# etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;There are definitely times to 
learn new things and&nbsp;experiment with new technologies &mdash; the early 
days of your product development&nbsp;is not the best time.&nbsp; Either you 
need to know the language/platfrom from soup to nuts&nbsp;yourself &mdash; or 
you need to have immediate access to people you can rely on, that do.&nbsp; So, 
I picked C# and .Net &mdash; which frankly, if I had to do over, I 
wouldn&rsquo;t have picked (more on that later).&nbsp; But, based on my 
circumstances at the time, I thought I chose rationally, and I was solving for 
the company, not my ego or enjoyment.&nbsp; The good news is that the mistake 
wasn&rsquo;t fatal.&nbsp; [Side note: Patrick, if you&rsquo;re reading this, 
I&rsquo;ll admit, you were right. I should write a follow-up article on this on 
the topic of trust].</p> 
<p>A couple of years later, I was faced with a different decision.&nbsp; I 
was&nbsp;working in&nbsp;HubSpot Labs.&nbsp; HubSpot Labs is&nbsp;a 
&ldquo;startup within a startup&rdquo;.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t have a written 
charter for HubSpot Labs (because frankly, I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how to 
write one of those, or if I did, who would read it).&nbsp; But, the idea was to 
build cool free&nbsp;tools (seehttp://grader.com).&nbsp; These 
tools&nbsp;pulled in&nbsp;website visitors, increased visibility of HubSpot, 
and helped us get some interesting data that we used to benefit our 
core&nbsp;business.&nbsp; At the time all this was happening, I was trying to 
decide between PHP, Python and Ruby.&nbsp; I knew I wanted a dynamic language, 
and I had whittled things down to those three choices.&nbsp; I picked PHP, and 
Python was my second choice.&nbsp; Though Ruby/Rails would likely have been 
fine too, there&rsquo;s something about it that I just found unnatural.&nbsp; 
If I had a dog, the dog would bark at the Ruby code.&nbsp; Python just feels 
more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; to me.&nbsp; But that's likely related to my C/C++ 
background.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I digress.&nbsp; Back to why I chose PHP:&nbsp;Main 
reasons were: 1) It was easy to get started.&nbsp; 2) It had decent OOP 
support.&nbsp; 3) There were lots of other people using it.&nbsp; 4) It was 
lingua franca on the web.&nbsp;&nbsp;The language served me well.&nbsp; It was 
an easy transition from my C++/C# days, and combined with an MVC framework like 
CodeIgniter, things weren&rsquo;t too bad.&nbsp; I&nbsp;actually had 
fun&nbsp;developing in the language, and after the first few months, I felt 
that the code I was producing was about as good as some of the code I&rsquo;m 
most proud of throughout my professional career.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have a love/like relationship with PHP.&nbsp; Sometimes I have good days, 
and sometimes I have great days.</p> 
<p>During my 2+ years of PHP development, I launched a bunch of web 
applications.&nbsp; Cumulatively, they&rsquo;re getting millions of page views 
a month now.&nbsp; Not bad.&nbsp; No major issues.</p> 
<p>So, you might then be wondering, why switch away from PHP and move to 
Python now?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I have better things to do with my time?&nbsp; 
Did I give in to peer pressure or somehow decide I wanted one more chance at 
being one of the &ldquo;cool kids&rdquo;.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll attempt at answering 
some of those questions.</p> 
<p><strong>Why HubSpot Labs Is Switching From PHP to Python</strong></p> 
<p>Here are some of the tradeoffs (PHP wins on some fronts, Python in others), 
for those faced with the decision now.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; The context here is a 
startup that is a bit further along (HubSpot was 2 years old and had&nbsp;about 
50&nbsp;employees at the time of this decision).&nbsp; But, some of the 
arguments still apply, even if you&rsquo;re earlier stage.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Python is well designed, PHP is not.&nbsp; </strong>Although PHP 
is a completely<em>workable </em>language &mdash; it&rsquo;s still not an 
elegant language.&nbsp; In the short to mid-term, that&rsquo;s not a 
particularly big problem.&nbsp; Any experienced developer that can create great 
software can likely also&nbsp;write really&nbsp;good software in PHP.&nbsp; 
(I&rsquo;m talking about PHP 5+ here &mdash; and ignoring all the ugliness that 
came before).&nbsp; But, there are limits.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not particularly 
bothered by the weird idiosyncracies of PHP (the &ldquo;needle vs. 
haystack&rdquo; problem).&nbsp; I can get over that pretty quickly.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s the<em>other</em> stuff &mdash; which is deeper and more 
nuanced.&nbsp; As a &ldquo;classically trained&rdquo; developer (undergrad 
CompSci), I appreciate that Python gets a bunch of the language&nbsp;stuff 
&ldquo;right&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s about how reflection is 
implemented.&nbsp; How functions are&nbsp;first-class objects.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
all the little things, which in aggregate, make for better cleaner, more<em>
elegant</em> code.&nbsp; <strong>Although it&rsquo;s perfectly possible to 
write good code in PHP, it&rsquo;s much easier to write great code in Python
</strong>.&nbsp; It is clear that Python was <em>architected</em> to be a 
robust, well-designed and well thought-out&nbsp;language.&nbsp; PHP &ldquo;just 
happened&rdquo;.&nbsp; Not to knock PHP (I actually<em>love</em> working in 
PHP) &mdash; but Python is just a better language.&nbsp; [Note:&nbsp; I still 
am viscerally troubled by the using whitespace to indicate code structure, 
instead of just using braces like the rest of the sane world, but it&rsquo;s a 
relatively minor gripe].</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Python has a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; web framework winner:&nbsp; 
</strong>Although conceptually I like having choices (and I believe&nbsp;in 
openness), practically, I really,<em>really</em> like standards.&nbsp; All 
things being equal, I much prefer that all of us are working with the same 
frameworks and libraries.&nbsp; Python mostly has that with Django.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s close to the de-facto choice for web frameworks in Python.&nbsp; 
Maybe not quite as dominant as Rails in Ruby-land &mdash; but close.&nbsp; 
Contrast that to PHP where we have Symfony, Zend, CodeIgniter,&nbsp;Kohana 
&mdash; and others.&nbsp; On the&nbsp;one hand, this kind of competition is 
good.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re all great frameworks (I use 
CodeIgniter right now), but the fact that there&rsquo;s no clear winner means 
that the market is&nbsp;fragmented.&nbsp; And, fragmentation is bad.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s<em>particularly</em> bad when it comes to web frameworks.&nbsp; The 
learning curve these days is not a new language (it takes a proficient 
programmer just a&nbsp;few days&nbsp;to get her arms around the basics of 
a&nbsp;new language).&nbsp; The learning curve is with the framework.&nbsp; The 
deeper and richer the framework is, the more there is to learn.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I<em>love</em> frameworks (dating back all the way to 
the Object Windows Library that Borland had for 
TurboPascal).&nbsp;&nbsp;Frameworks have an upfront cost, but provide a ton of 
value long-term.&nbsp; But, if there are a bunch of different frameworks 
floating around, the odds that any given person is working in the same 
framework you are lower.&nbsp; And as such, getting someone new up to speed 
takes longer.&nbsp; In Python land, the clear web framework winner is 
Django.&nbsp; This means that if I find a great Python developer for the team 
(more on this later), they&rsquo;ve likely used Django.&nbsp; That makes life 
much easier.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>3. <strong>PHP is lingua franca in the world of the web.&nbsp; </strong>One 
of the the early reasons I picked PHP, which is still true, is that it has 
become lingua franca on the web.&nbsp; If someone releases a new API, and 
provides a &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; for convenience, the first language supported 
will likely be PHP.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re looking to build WordPress plugins, 
you&rsquo;re going to be doing it in PHP.&nbsp; In fact, many of the biggest 
open source projects out there, that you might consider leveraging, are based 
on PHP.&nbsp; So, knowing PHP is a very, very useful thing.&nbsp; My advice is 
that even if you do decide to go with Python &mdash; be at least 
&ldquo;reasonably fluent&rdquo; in PHP &mdash; it&rsquo;ll come in handy.</p> 
<p>4. <strong>Low-End Web Hosting&nbsp;is a non-issue.&nbsp; </strong>Many 
people make the argument that PHP is a great choice of platform for startups 
because you can find a $9.99/month hosting provider that supports PHP.&nbsp; No 
need for higher-end hosting and you save money.&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s a 
poor reason.&nbsp; Yes, it&rsquo;s nice to know that there are thousands of 
hosting providers out there that all support PHP, and that you can get hosting 
really cheap as a result.&nbsp; But, if you&rsquo;re picking a language based 
on spending $10/month vs. $50/month or $100/month &mdash; you&rsquo;re focused 
on the wrong thing.&nbsp; Assuming that you stick with your low-cost provider 
for 18 months (a long time in startup-land), you&rsquo;ll have<em>maybe</em> 
saved $900.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just not a lot of money.&nbsp; My advice:&nbsp; 
Recognize that there are things like Amazon EC2 out there now, and over time, 
it&rsquo;s going to be just as easy to spin up servers for Python as it is for 
PHP.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>5. <strong>Not all Python fans are fad-focused elitists .&nbsp; </strong>
One of the arguments I hear continually online goes something like this:&nbsp; 
&ldquo;PHP is a perfectly fine language, and folks pushing Python are just 
fad-focused elitists that want to work on the latest cool new thing, instead of 
just picking what works and focusing on building apps that solve customer 
problems.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m paraphrasing a bit, but that&rsquo;s the gist 
of it.&nbsp; I can see<em>why</em> people sometimes feel this way.&nbsp; Lets 
say you&rsquo;re something like me:&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve learned PHP and used it 
to build and launch &ldquo;real world&rdquo; apps.&nbsp; For you, the cost of 
change is high (maybe even prohibitively high).&nbsp; Really hard to justify 
the change, because though you might grudgingly admit that Python is better, 
it&rsquo;s not<em>better enough</em> to warrant switching.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve 
got a startup to grow, you can&rsquo;t be bothered with trying to join the cool 
kids.&nbsp; But, I&rsquo;m to advocate for some empathy here.&nbsp; Lets say 
you were on the outside looking in (i.e. you&rsquo;re a gifted developer 
looking to join a cool new startup).&nbsp; Since you&rsquo;re really good, and 
demand for great developers always exceeds supply, you essentially get to pick 
where you want to work.&nbsp; All things being equal, you&rsquo;re going to 
pick the place that is doing Python vs. PHP.&nbsp; Of course, not all things 
are equal, and you might actually pick the startup whose business you think has 
the best chances of success or whose founders you like and respect.&nbsp; But, 
often, it&rsquo;s hard to know that stuff upfront, so you focus on what you<em>
do</em> know &mdash; that developing in Python&rsquo;s a better 
&ldquo;bet&rdquo;.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t fault people for solving for their 
self-interest and preference.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re not trying to talk you into 
switching, they&rsquo;re just saying that<em>it matters to them.</em></p> 
<p><em>6. </em><strong>Low Learning are less important than high 
ceilings.&nbsp;</strong>If you&rsquo;re in the software development business as 
a career choice (i.e. you&rsquo;re going to do it for a long time), then the 
larger consideration should be what&rsquo;s going to create the most value for 
you long-term.&nbsp; Some languages, like PHP, have very low learning curves 
&mdash; it&rsquo;s super-easy to get started.&nbsp; And, that&rsquo;s 
awesome.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy-going, fun, and you feel super-productive 
(especially if you&rsquo;re making a big change to something new).&nbsp; But, 
once you get past that initial dating period, you need to think about your 
future.&nbsp; You want to forge a relationship with a language that will be 
long-lasting, rich and deep.&nbsp; A language that brings the best out in you 
&mdash; over the long-term.&nbsp; Apologies for the strained metaphor here 
&mdash; but it had some resonance for me.&nbsp; So, back to the title of this 
article:&nbsp;<strong>PHP Is Fantastically Fun, But Python Is Marriage Material
</strong>.&nbsp; Apologies for the strained metaphor, but it resonated with 
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been programming for a long time, it&rsquo;s my calling, 
and with any luck, I expect to do it for a couple of more decades. Since I'm 
going to get into a long-term relationship with a language, I figured Python's 
a pretty good bet.</p> 
<p>Whew!&nbsp; That ended up being longer than I expected.&nbsp; If you made 
it this far, thanks for reading!&nbsp; By the way, if you&rsquo;re a gifted 
Python&nbsp;developer in the Boston area and looking to join what is quite 
possibly the best&nbsp;company to work for in Boston (we won an award, so it 
must be true), would love to connect.&nbsp; The HubSpot developer interviews 
are a bit, um,<em>rigorous</em>, but I promise that you&rsquo;ll meet some 
people that will have made the time spent worthwhile, even if things 
don&rsquo;t work out.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re interested, just drop me an email 
at {dshah} @ {OnStartups}{daht-com}.&nbsp; By the way, in case you didn&rsquo;t 
know, I&rsquo;m the founder/CTO at HubSpot, and an all-around nice guy.&nbsp; 
Just ask anybody.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And, if there are any arguments you&rsquo;d make on either side (PHP or 
Python), would love to hear them.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t want to start yet another 
language war, but I&rsquo;m fascinated by the topic of making hard decisions at 
startups, and this is one of the hardest.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote>

Hey Dharmesh, very nice article. You did put things right :) I'm a PHP 
programmer fighting to switch to python (which I already knew was better) for 
quite some time. Perhaps next year, right? :P

 Dharmesh, I'm a JS/PHP man myself, but I can see a lot of merit in your 
arguments.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
One thing I always try to explain to people 
(at least those who ask) is that it's not the tool but how you use. I wrote the 
software I'm most proud of 25 years ago in BASIC and 6809 assembler.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
In other words, you can write very elegant code in PhP, and total 
guff in Python, Haskell or Erlang (of course the reverse is also true).&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp; <br>
But you're arguing something subtly different - which is the 
relevance of one dominant framework. It's a very good point, and one which I 
haven't heard articulated so well before. I can see why it would make a 
difference...&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Finally, it may all be irrelevant, anyway. 
If node.js continues like this it will be non-blocking Javascript on both sides 
of the cavern.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Just think! Only one language to 
learn....&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>

I'm curious (especially because I thought you were going to expand on why, you 
now regret having chosen C# and .NET. I don't ask because I'm a fan of it, 
because I chose specifically to move away from the MS technology stack, but I'm 
curious to see someone else's perspective on it who wasn't influenced by having 
actually worked at MS (like me.)

hi!&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Interesting article. I usually don't do this, but 
I'll weight your words with gold and try it out myself. (Except when I find 
another better language for the web.. (I doubt it).&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I 
know Ruby (on Rails/Spoutcore/Cucumber), PHP(5.3), C++, C#, C, Pascal, Java, 
ASP, JSP, CSS(3)/JS/HTML(5)/LaTex/VB/XML..and still..&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I 
feel at home in the Web-Development, because I see more value in connected 
software than in isolated offline environments.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I'll 
develop a pure web-application (without a framework) in a team of 5 after 1-3 
months for a class where we're open to use any language.&nbsp;<br>
And you're 
right learning a language takes a day and getting productive with it takes a 
week. But learning a framework is more time consuming, especially sharing the 
knowledge you've achieved.
<p> posted on Wednesday, October 27, 2010 at 4:34 PM by Fernandos </p>  I can 
completely relate. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Back in 2007 after working on the 
Microsite stack for (gah!) 13+ years I wrote a blog post &quot;On the Hunt for 
a New Programming Language&quot;: (not being as good a blogger as you I never 
followed it up, but hey!)&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Basically Python was my 
favorite, but I chose PHP because it was more standard, i.e. more important 
apps that I cared about were written in PHP: MediaWiki, vBulletin, Drupal, 
WordPress, etc. Of those I now only really care about WordPress, but I care an 
awful lot about it because it's the most widely used CMS on the web, and to me 
that trumps all else (at least for things that are currently important to 
me.)&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I do lament the fact I don't get to use Python 
because I love it as a language (although I've grown intensely fond of 
variables that are prefixed with $; it makes it far easier to do refactoring of 
variable names than in most other languages.) And I love how Python uses 
whitespace; it's requires so much less syntax and few lines to do the same 
thing than semi-colons and braces. And I lament not having the expressiveness 
of Python vs. PHP. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
OTOH I think your point on shared web 
hosting misses an underlying theme and that's the because it's easier to get a 
PHP app set up far more people end up using PHP apps. Had Python been as easy 
to get set up then I think we'd see a lot more viable apps (vs. frameworks) 
based on Python and I think Python has missed huge opportunity and really 
played this aspect poorly. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I love that you view 
standards as critical; that's what I debate so often with developers who don't 
appreciate the value of standards, but I think the irony here is that Python is 
less standard because it requires a solid (and expensive) technical person to 
get it running. That's no problem for the hardcore dev, but it is a problem for 
the totally non-technical business person looking for a system that doesn't 
cost them lots of $$$ to implement.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Alas!&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>
-Mike&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
BTW, I've been advising web startups 
not to go the .NET stack route in instead choose one of PHP, Python, or Ruby so 
I would love to see you elaborate on why C# was a mistake.

Your new HubSpot Labs logo is really cool. The deadhead in me thinks it looks

&quot;If I had a dog, the dog would bark at the Ruby code.&quot; And if I had a 
cat, it would twitch its tail and otherwise look mildly irritated at Python 
code.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I kid, of course. It's true, however, that having 
worked extensively in both Python and Ruby, I find Ruby somewhat more 
comfortable. And it isn't even that I'm a heavy user of the more 
&quot;exotic&quot; features of Ruby that often come up in comparisons of these 
languages. There's an element of personal taste here.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I 
really don't think I could stand C# and .Net.

I'm a ColdFusion developer looking to branch out to other web development 
languages. Twice now, I've looked into PHP and gotten annoyed and sidetracked 
by the fragmented framework-space. I've always been a fan of Python, but have 
never taken the dive. I think you just pushed me to commit some time to Django.

Please drop the other shoe. 
Why do you say you regret having picked C# in the first place? Why did you 
later feel that you had to change from C# to something else?

point I had the option to choose .NET or Python for our primary web programming 
language. I choose .NET. Man do I regret that now.

php vs python.....mini mini mani mo......never been bitten by a python, but i 
wonder how the venom turns out. Php....agreed...easy to learn
<p> posted on Wednesday, October 27, 2010 at 9:42 PM by chuks </p>  I'm 
curious if you ever considered anything besides Django for Python. To me, 
Django appears to have that same allure of PHP (a low learning curve), but when 
you get past the dating period, you wish you had more flexibility. I'm thinking 
of Pylons here. Any thoughts?

<br>&nbsp; <br>
Django does not have a shallow learning curve, but it DOES have 
excellent documentation. The end result is similar: you can get productive very 
quickly. But there is a subtle difference; Django has many many deep and 
powerful features that you'll never touch until one day you realize that you 
need them.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
If django seems like it's inflexible, 
double-check to make sure you're not overlooking some extension point. Django 
has a pluggable backend for just about everything.
<p> posted on Wednesday, October 27, 2010 at 11:58 PM by jim robert </p>  Not 
that long ago whilst working at a company with about 2 million lines of Perl I 
was considering specifying another development language. The reason related to 
CORBA, the beast which had to be tamed, but which Perl just couldn't deal 
with.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I liked the idea of Python, and still do, but in 
the end I had to stick with Perl. The reason was entirely pragmatic - the 
company had cornered the market in Perl programmers locally, and I knew that 
there were fewer Python people out there. So, if we made the jump we'd be in 
danger of painting ourselves into another corner. Programmers can learn of 
course, but quite a few were (and still are around here) unhappy with the 
thought of Linux script languages. It's considered a dead-end as far as career 
goes.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I use Python myself a lot, although the white space 
issue still bugs me a bit.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
What did we do about CORBA? 
Wrote the interface in Java and called it from the Perl script. Slow and messy 
but functional.

through all of this while deciding on the platform for my startup - nice to see 
the validation! :) I chose PHP too for all the reasons that you have mentioned. 
Some reasonable open source well supported CMS are available in PHP. So to 
start off the block in quick time, with minimal resources, it is kinda hard to 
look the other way :)
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 1:31 AM by Nikhil </p>  Anyone who 
claims Python is the current fad elitist language is so far behind the times 
you might want to tell them about this new hip language called Java.
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 2:50 AM by Bob Jones </p>  I feel, 
with evolution of time, our opinions on a language/frameworkchange which might 
be because&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
1. Language/frameworks in the language have 
improved. &nbsp;<br>
2. You have improved your skill in the 
language/framework.&nbsp;<br>
3. The existing &quot;circumstances&quot; for the 
language/framework improved. Like easy hosting for django has come with amazon 
ec2 etc.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I will not be surprised if Dharmesh after 5 
years, writes an article saying, XYZ langauge/framework is better than Python 
because of a, b, c etc..

&quot;[Note: I still am viscerally troubled by the using whitespace to indicate 
code structure, instead of just using braces like the rest of the sane world, 
but it&rsquo;s a relatively minor gripe]&quot;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
In a 
language that used braces, would you still indent the code properly (i.e. like 
you do in python)? If you would, then you should recognize the fact that python 
helps you write code faster and easier to grasp visually by not having to match 
the opening and closing braces.
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 4:41 AM by Mircea </p>  I think of 
all the choices a founder must make, technology choice is among the least 
important. If the product can grow, the language is scalable, talent is 
available in wide swaths of the community, and there is robust third party 
development (frameworks, Open Source, CMS, etc) then I would say go with what 
you know best. Other costs, as you mentioned, are minimal compared with the 
cost of learning new languages and frameworks for a single founder. &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
That said, I am also classically trained and found some of the less 
robust features of PHP very annoying!
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 8:54 AM by Boots </p>  I love 
these arguments, it shows how much we grow over the years as we program. This 
is a time vs experience issue.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
1) Starting out, C# made 
you the most productive.&nbsp;<br>
2) Learning a new language/framework looks 
like a mountain to overcome.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
My opinion, the more 
languages you learn, the better programmer you are. I really didn't think 
closures or chaining was useful, then jquery changed all that. Now Javascript 
had the ability to do that all along, as well as other languages, but only now 
using it helps me be more productive in other languages.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>

Keep learning guys and use the best tool for the job, which may be what you 
already know. Oh and don't fall in love with it, because a few years later the 
equation changes and your developers will have more experience in X language 
and it makes sense to rewrite for it.

Clearly written by a Python aficionado. I've had to maintain someone else's 
Python (or cr*p as I like to call it) code. Python allows for very bad code to 
be written fast and easily. No type information to go on when debugging. The 
article author is assuming an idealistic world, where all coders write well 
written and logical code. If that were the case then not only Python but all 
the other good languages would be &quot;great&quot;. As for being Marriage 
Material, the author again is assuming an idealistic world, where a spouse is 
faithfully and doesn't nag all the time.
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 9:21 AM by charles_d </p>  1. The 
author asserts, without explanation or elaboration, that C# was the wrong 
choice. Why?&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
2. The author says: &quot;Low Learning are 
less important than high ceilings.&quot; What was limitations did you have with 
C# and .NET that weren't there with PHP or Python? Have you not seen ASPNET MVC 
or Entity Framework (or even NHibernate)? How do you make the rational argument 
that .NET is less productive or has a lower ceiling than PHP or Python, 
especially when you make the point that saving money on ultra-cheap hosting 
providers isn't that strategically great in business terms?&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; 
<br>Mr. Author: please do a new version of this article with more explanation 
of the points you make but don't back up.
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 9:29 AM by Mike C </p>  On 
advantage we've found in using Python at Resolver Systems is that it acts as a 
filter when you're recruiting. Many programmers know PHP, VB, Java or C#. Those 
languages are needed in the vast majority of programming jobs, so people who 
see coding as a means to a paycheck rather than a passion will (quite 
reasonably) learn one of them and work in it. They won't apply for a job at a 
company using Python because it would be a waste of time for them to invest in 
learning the language.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
On the other hand, people who are 
passionate about programming will either know Python or will regard the chance 
to learn it as a positive aspect of a job.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
So by saying 
&quot;we develop in Python&quot; on the job ad, you effectively pre-emptively 
filter out the bulk of the people who aren't keen programmers before they even 
apply, which greatly reduces the costs of recruitment -- which can be a killer 
for a startup because you absolutely must have the best people but have very 
little time to spend on hiring them.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Of course, 
programmers at a startup have to be more than great developers -- they need to 
be pragmatic, flexible, and business focused. But I don't know any short-cuts 
for identifying those before an interview :-)&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
(Oh, and 
perhaps as Python becomes more mainstream the filter will work less well. But 
it's probably not time yet to switch to Clojure just to make hiring easier...)
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 9:33 AM by Giles </p>  Just 
realised that Paul Graham said essentially the same thing as I just did,back in 
2004! 
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 9:58 AM by Giles </p>  After 
reading your article, and enjoying it, I'm trying to find one solid business 
reason for doing the unthinkable in a startup business environment, switching 
programming languages after having significant investment in another. In a 
startup every thought should be on maximum return on investment, and I cannot 
see anything in your post to indicate that was on your mind which leads me to 
believe that yes you were indeed &quot;fad-focused&quot;. The only point you 
had that had any return on investment mentality was the &quot;Python means I 
get better programmers applying&quot;, but I would wager that you would find 
more quality PHP programmers simply due to the sheer number of PHP programmers 
to Python programmers out there. Of course the invterview process would take 
quite a bit more skill and time to weed out all the bad ones. &nbsp;<br>
 Ok, 
so despite my counter argument, you've made me want to actually spend some time 
learning Python between my PHP and C# duties. As I said, I enjoyed your article 
and I think you made a lot of good points for a PHP programmer to look into 
Python. As for your decision in a startup I think it's insane, but I suppose 
you covered that in the beginning of the article. I think you should probably 
chalk this up to a giant FAIL decision, which I believe you do, and learn that 
in the grand scheme of things, a capable and current programming language 
should never be switched out. You cannot justify that cost in most situations.

django is bulky, i found it hard the first time i learned about it. but then i 
found bottle, now i am becoming lazier to open my php code than to write and 
experiment using bottle.
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 10:40 AM by pebbie </p>  I've 
never tried Django, so have no comparison to contribute. But I find it telling 
that the Django guys don't try to redefine the term &quot;MVC&quot;. Because 
they are not using it as buzzword in the first place, unlike all the PHP 
frameworks.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
That being said, PHP 
in itself is a workable framework. And the clumsy HTTP input arrays are itself 
a near perfect environment for web apps. Frameworks are icing on the cake, 
sometimes bloated und undelicious icing. But I believe it's better to have 
choice here than a one-size-fits-all API.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Again I don't 
know enough about Django, but the Python core libraries are not very well 
trimmed towards web apps. (E.g. none of the default http modules supports 
content-encoding out of the box.)
<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 1:03 PM by mario </p>  When a 
friend of mine left to work for you two years ago and told me you were using C# 
I was kind of stunned. Everything he said about the company was appealing (good 
use of social media, smart concept, and great use of tools as marketing) but 
that stack choice stuck out in my mind the most. Glad to see you've come over 
to the Django side. Also I can't agree with Tom Leys more. The fact that I can 
use Python in so many ways makes it so much more valuable. &nbsp;<br>

<p> posted on Thursday, October 28, 2010 at 3:31 PM by Brian </p>  Its kind of 
interesting that stack overflow.com and Answers.OnStartups.com are both built 
on c# and asp.net mvc. And its also interesting that a very smart Google 
engineer named J. Skeet, one of the top rated users on stackoverflow wrote a 
great in depth book on C#. Clearly language choice does not depend on how good 
you are as a programmer or how passionate you are about the craft of software 
design. It is a personal choice based on the qualities of a language that 
appeal to you (verbosity and strong typing in my case) and that work for you in 
terms of your own productivity.&nbsp;<br>
As long as you don't live in a bubble 
and study other languages and frameworks so you can make your own informed 
choice.
<p> posted on Friday, October 29, 2010 at 12:44 AM by Areg Sarkissian </p>  
@Areg Sarkissian -- Answers.OnStartups.com is an instance of the Stack Overflow 
software, isn't it?&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Anyway, not sure if you were thinking 
of my comment above when you said &quot;language choice does not depend on how 
good you are as a programmer or how passionate you are about the craft of 
software design&quot;, but if so, we don't disagree. There are many great 
programmers out there who prefer typed languages like C#. I've even met good 
developers who were fond of Visual Basic. It's not so much the choice of 
language that's important, but the willingness to learn other languages. To put 
it another way, good developers will know more than one programming language, 
or will be willing to learn another. Or as you put it, they avoid living in a 
bubble, and study other languages and frameworks so that they can make their 
own informed choices.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
When you combine this with the fact 
that (say) Python is a minority language, so is unlikely to be someone's only 
language (outside a few scientific specialities), it means that knowing or 
being willing to learn Python is quite a good indicator of a good programmer. 
That doesn't mean that every good programmer knows Python, but it does mean 
that if a programmer knows Python, or are willing to learn it on the job, they 
are probably good. This makes hiring easier.&nbsp;<br>

<p> posted on Friday, October 29, 2010 at 4:51 AM by Giles </p>  Great article 
indeed! I write C# for a living but love learning about Python and using it in 
my own products. This article touched on a lot of points we, developers are 
thinking but would never say due to being flamed by our peers.&nbsp;<br>
Thank 
you
<p> posted on Friday, October 29, 2010 at 7:41 AM by Carl </p>  I hadn't done 
any 'real' programming in quite awhile when I decided to develop my website. I 
choose PHP because it seemed like the shortest learning curve, tons of 
information available (manuals, sample code, forums, user community etc.. 
though this is probably true with most other languages as well), and the 
easiest to get started on to bring up a version 1/working prototype. Though, if 
I had experience in another language I sure I would have chosen it. If the site 
does kick off though I could see having to rewrite it in a more robust 
language. Seems like there have been other sites with extremely high traffic 
that have either redesigned on another language or added code to turbo boost 
PHP. There isn't always one 'best ' solution but more importantly use the 
proper tool to solve the problem. For now PHP is serving me well.
<p> posted on Friday, October 29, 2010 at 10:30 AM by matt </p>  To choose a 
language i'd say go with your gut fealing. That will keep you happy and 
motivated. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I started as a kid doing various types of 
assembler code (m68k, x86, mips) and for years I believed ppl who used high lvl 
languages were stupid. Later c, c++, perl, php, jscript (severside!), java, c#, 
then java again then c# and finally java. Also did a bunch of academic 
languages like ml. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
For web I probably hit the peak of 
productivity with perl and php - they were both quick and dirty (but the stuff 
I wrote was not very maintainable nor scalable). I really like both c# and java 
but in the end I decided for java because c# dosen't have much of an ecosystem 
- it's microsofts tool and framework or nothing - and I couldn't get into the 
really big projects (20mio+ budgets and large scale architecture) with c# but 
the opportunities were abundant with java. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I think 
developers today are spoilt for choise not only in languages but also dev 
invironments. Java really hit the golden age of dev environments maybe 5-8 
years ago. You can choose between IDEs such as netbeans, intellij, eclipse, 
jdeveloper and more - all for free - all with exellent refactoring, unittest, 
buildsystems etc. Truely amazing times we live in - if your not happy being a 
developer today then its never going to happen change your profession right 
away! :)

Similar arguments could possibly support the use of Java over php (as opposed 
to python) given the advantage of seamless interoperability, ubiquitous support 
on all server hosting providers (disregarding the minor hit on speed, ofcourse, 
which again can be mitigated by intelligent caching)
<p> posted on Saturday, October 30, 2010 at 12:46 AM by Abhishek </p>  Besides 
all the things you mentioned, one thing that stood out for both Python and 
Django was the presence of clear decision makers. With Guido as BDFL it means 
that progress can be made rather being mired in some of the community bickering 
that can go on with languages like Java.
<p> posted on Saturday, October 30, 2010 at 3:45 AM by Brent Hoover </p>  
Seems like this decision to switch to Python is even harder since the Python 
2.7 release on 4 July 2010 was the final end-of-life (albeit with extended 
support) for the 2.x branch and the new 3.x is not backward compatible with 2.x 
and Django support for 3.x is still pretty much awol at this time.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Will you start with 2.x and then migrate all 
of your body of work to 3.x when Django and other frameworks catch up? Or will 
you just transition newer development to 3.x and be in the position to support 
two baselines (either indefinitely or until you can migrate your 2.x stuff)?

Well... I think you are trying to push what you actually believe in rather than 
the fact. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
PHP and Python both are good, choosing between 
them is kind of choosing between two different type of apples. what ever that 
python does can be done in php as well. vice versa.&nbsp;<br>

<p> posted on Monday, November 01, 2010 at 3:53 AM by Ram </p>  I've spent a 
lot of time in PHP, and just enough time in Python to realize that I don't like 
the amount of &quot;magic&quot; that Python forces the developers to rely on. 
What I constantly found myself having problems with was the amount of 
inconsistencies in the prebuilt libraries and modules that we as a shop ended 
up using. Without having a PhD on the team of 8 programmers who happened to be 
a Python pro (but interestingly enough had no Django experience) was like a 
blind monkey trying to lead a pack of deaf rats. Gone were the days of 
troubleshooting errors without having to create a complex knowledge of the 
intricate workings of the source code, linear progression through the different 
modules, and other stuff. I can't tell you the number of times I spent hours in 
one rabbit whole, only to ask and find out that the problem was actually 
somewhere entirely different and really would never have looked there unless I 
just knew that was where to look. Yes, PHP sometimes probably involves a bit 
more programming *sometimes*, but I find that the Python programmer is one who 
is a)lazy and b)enjoys coming up with impossible to track down code using 
highly ingenious solutions to solve the most menial problems ever. Yes, 
sometimes the prebuilt stuff makes it easy, but as the latest comment prior to 
mine stated, Python has now deprecated the current revision of Python that is 
the only compatible version with django.
<p> posted on Monday, November 01, 2010 at 1:09 PM by Oknotsomuch </p>  An 
awesome article and one that's very much needed on the tubes right now. I'm a 
PHP developer for the most part, but a skeptic forever, and this kind of 
writing is always interesting to me.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I love/hate your 
comment about being a &quot;classically trained&quot; developer due to your CS 
undergrad work. I started out as a CS student as a freshman at Purdue (*lots* 
of Java development), but moved to our &quot;Computer Technology&quot; 
department, mostly because of their more practical (vs theoretical) approach to 
development. Unfortunately, the program focuses heavily on C# .NET and Oracle, 
and I find that PHP is a much better route for web development learning on 
one's own (as you mentioned). As far as education and web development go, I'm 
convinced that you can learn to write high quality web-aps on your own, but 
employers will *always* like to see a related degree.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
At 
any rate, I thank you for this article. PHP I feel is the best place to get 
started in web development due to the low learning curve and extreme popularity 
that you mentioned. While I know Python is fairly similar and much more handy 
for things like back-end scripting, I'm ashamed to say I haven't touched it 
yet. Either way, this article will surely get a review and mention on my own 
site!&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Thanks!

Excellent article, it was a very good read. I'm also considering switching from 
PHP, mostly because of all the bad rumors about PHP6 development. &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
I'm very very interested in this part: &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<i>
&quot;Python gets a bunch of the language stuff &ldquo;right&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s 
about how reflection is implemented. How functions are first-class objects. 
It&rsquo;s all the little things, which in aggregate, make for better cleaner, 
more elegant code.&quot;</i>&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Could someone please 
provide some reading material on this?
<p> posted on Monday, November 01, 2010 at 2:57 PM by WishCow </p>  Hi 
@Oknotsomuch, &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Your comments ring true with me given my 
experience with &quot;ideal&quot; solutions in the past (one of which I was a 
staunch advocate and wrote a book for) and more pragmatic solutions that just 
let people get things done. As I commented above, I currently program in PHP 
programmer but wish I could program in Python; unfortunately it just ain't in 
the cards for me at this time.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
But one thing you said 
struck me as unexpected:<i>&quot;b) enjoys coming up with impossible to track 
down code using highly ingenious solutions to solve the most menial problems 
ever.&quot;</i> One of the things that makes me want to work with Python are 
some of the things quoted as ideals in The Zen of Python:&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
The following 
aphorisms really resonated with me:&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
 - Explicit is better 
than implicit.&nbsp;<br>
 - Simple is better than complex.&nbsp; <br>
 - Flat 
is better than nested.&nbsp;<br>
 - Readability counts.&nbsp; <br>
 - There 
should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.&nbsp;<br>
 - If 
the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.&nbsp;<br>
 - If the 
implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>

All of those sound diametrically opposed to what you quoted as your issue 
&quot;b).&quot; Sounds like maybe the Python programmers you know are not 
really good Python programmers but instead followers who can't be bothered to 
know, understand and practice the doctrine, maybe? &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>

FWIW.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
-Mike&nbsp; <br>
P.S. What you describe sounds a 
lot more like what I've seen looking in from the outside looking in with Ruby 
and Rails vs. Python where many of the Rubistas I know delight in coding in as 
few lines as possible even if it makes it impossible to maintain. That's why I 
shied away from Ruby.
<p> posted on Monday, November 01, 2010 at 4:07 PM by Mike Schinkel </p>  I 
don't understand why people continue the language-wars argument. The reality is 
that all the languages mentioned have been used to develop successfull 
business's. Therefore, pick a language that you and your team is comfortable 
with and focus on building the product that solves the solution.&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Arguing Python is better than C# or PHP is 
better than Java is pointless. Each technical team will have a favorite, for 
different reasons...and I say develop with the language you feel most 
comfortable with. If you architect your product well, you'll do fine.
<p> posted on Monday, November 01, 2010 at 6:33 PM by mike </p>  I get asked 
questions about one language over another all the time. At the end of the day 
they all have their pros and cons, it really comes down to what you have the 
most experience with.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Crappy code is crappy code no 
matter what language it is written in. I am way more concerned about picking 
the right members of my development team than the language we decide to use.
<p> posted on Monday, November 01, 2010 at 9:14 PM by Adam </p>  Finding a 
good platform is very critical at start up. Cost most be taken into 
consideration as well as knowledge of the platform. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
So 
if all I know at start up is PHP, should I then refuse to launch or spend most 
of my time reviewing platforms than getting straight to work? No!&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
For me right now it does not matter whether PHP or Python is better. 
They both get the job done either way.<b>it's more about ease of programming.

Some will advocate that Java is the best but the 
truth is that there are always options.We can always upgrade like you've done 
if the need arises.
<p> posted on Tuesday, November 02, 2010 at 4:33 AM by seunweb </p>  In my 
opinion the point really being made here isn't that one is simply a better 
language than the other but what is more sustainable as a platform in the long 
run to scale-up a startup's operations. It's noteworthy that at the end of the 
day if you're just trying to get your solution up and running go with just 
about any platform you're comfortable with rather than having to add another 
layer of learning i.e. other than marketing, finance etc. Get the solution out 
there, mature it, reassess when scaling up and go with the platform that suits 
your needs the best. For all you know it might not even be Python.
<p> posted on Tuesday, November 02, 2010 at 9:46 PM by HSekhon </p>  in my 
opinion, C# is good to develop desktop application, PHP and Python is good to 
make web application. I prefer Python because I hate to press a lot of key 
(Shift+[ = {) and Python is easier to read.
<p> posted on Wednesday, November 03, 2010 at 4:34 AM by kjen </p>  I like 
Python a lot for it's inherit OOP, simple syntax and readability. But in the 
end it's also about what the company you program for already uses. Right now 
the world is mostly in PHP and that's what I've got the most experience in. 
Just like I need to work with Symfony 1.4 and not 2.0, even though I'd like to 
use 2.0 already (or one of the other frameworks). It might be different if 
you're setting up a site from scratch.. but then again all my knowledge, 
experience and pre-made ready-to-use code is in PHP - so why switch?&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
On the other hand I still use Python when hobbying and would gladly 
welcome an opportunity to work in it professionally. At least I prepared for 
that some, although for now my focus must be on PHP.

love to see your follow up article about why you regret starting with C#. I am 
coming from a desktop app perspective and couldn't imagine doing my work 
entirely in Python, but I'm also not that experienced in it. Would love to see 
what the issues are with C# and website development.
<p> posted on Monday, November 08, 2010 at 9:42 AM by Dave M. </p>  please

decision and currently leaning to c# (for the same reason you made your 
original decision)
<p> posted on Tuesday, November 09, 2010 at 10:28 PM by Jon </p>  After 
previously commenting I'm returning to comment again because I just got an 
email that reminded me of one of the key reasons why PHP or Python are much 
better for most startups than C# or Java. And this is to address what those who 
say<i>&quot;Technology choice isn't important, it's execution that's 
important.&quot;</i> They are right about the latter but not about the former, 
and in part it's because the former relates to the latter in ways they were 
probably not considering.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
From 1994-2006 I ran a 
successful catalog mail order business that sold commercial component software 
to Microsoft-centric software developers. We started with components for Visual 
Basic developers and evolved to components for .NET developers. One of our 
vendors was a company called Aspose and I only mention them here because it was 
a marketing email I got today from them. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Aspose's 
products allow developers to &quot;Create, Open, Modify, Convert and Save: DOC, 
DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF and many more.&quot; They claim their products 
are &quot;Trusted by more than 50% of Fortune 100 companies&quot; to which I've 
no reason to believe is false (my former company sold to almost 100% of Fortune 
100 companies because they all had Visual Basic developers somewhere within 
their company and we only need to resell one $100 component to claim them as a 
customer!)&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Apose's email pitch today included 
&quot;Aspose.Total isn't just a cheap alternative; it is quite simply the best 
value for your money. Prices for Aspose.Total start as low as $1999...&quot; 
And therein lies the problem. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
The entire culture around 
.NET and Java components is based on value pricing of software marketed to the 
Fortune 1000. And that's not a bad thing; for those companies spending money 
for functionality from a throat they can choke is far better than depending on 
open-source. But a $2000 per developer component package to solve one technical 
problem (of which there are many) is absolutely not appropriate for startup 
budgets. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
The culture around PHP and Python is freely 
downloadable open-source functionality that in most cases is on par with the 
commercial equivalent that is value priced in .NET+Java. And the open-source 
model ensures that, for the most part, the best components bubble to the top 
because there is no pricing friction that keeps developers from evaluating the 
different available options.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
In the .NET+Java world the 
components offered by the company that executes their business best bubbles to 
the top, not the best technical solution. I saw it repeatedly, the guys that 
could manage their sales force the best were the leading vendors, not the 
companies whose developers created the best component. And thus there is far 
more fragmentation among components in the .NET+Java space. Back in the day I 
counted at one time 37 different charting components available for sale to .NET 
developers, and it is very hard to determine which one met your needs without 
lots of time spent evaluating each of them. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
With PHP and 
Python the best solutions become relatively clear because of the community 
aspect of open-source, and there are rarely more than 3 reasonable options to 
evaluate. This one fact alone is an important reason to avoid .NET or Java for 
a startup and to go with PHP or Python.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
In summary, the 
reason why .NET+Java are bad for startups is that their ecosystems are 
optimized for serving enterprise needs at enterprise prices and with enterprise 
evaluation timeframes whereas the ecosystems for PHP and Python are much 
friendlier to the needs, financial constraints and evaluation timeframes of 
startups. Frankly I left my successful business selling .NET components back in 
2006 because I realized that open-source PHP+Python was a much better avenue 
than .NET+Java for web startups and I wanted to get more involved in the web 
space because, frankly the enterprise sales process disgusts me.&nbsp;<br>

FWIW.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; <br>
Agree with you comment above on .net; but I don't 
really think all of the software ecosystem in java is geared toward the 
fortune1000.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
There's quite a bit of open source community 
thats thriving if you know where to find it. &nbsp;<br>
But then again, if your 
requirement lies in specific niches then it may be true that the ecosystem that 
caters to your need is mostly geared toward the enterprise.&nbsp;<br>

Abhishek: Fair point about Java. I was lumping it in with .NET because I know 
that Java is heavily used in the enterprise. Although it does appear that 
out-looking-in that Java is similar to .NET (the local Java user group in 
Atlanta is all enterprise focused, for example) truth-be-told I don't have 
enough relevant experience in the Java ecosystems to speak with any authority 
on it.

I'm not trained as a developer, but I like to make a little website here and 
there. I did a little test run with Python and appengine(horrible choice by the 
way). Anyway, this article inspired me to try it, and I must say it's amazing. 
Thanks.
<p> posted on Saturday, November 13, 2010 at 4:08 AM by hiimleath </p>  If 
you're using Python for web apps, you should definitely check out web2py. I'm 
impressed with it's capability and the community is awesome.

<p> posted on Tuesday, November 16, 2010 at 12:13 PM by Greg Wilson </p>  Once 
again, awesome read... I'm not a programmer myself, but do dabble in it 
sometimes and the idea that php have lots of open source and freely available 
code, makes you want to go back to it again and again.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I 
kind of went for the one with the lower learning curve, mostly because of time 
constraints. Nice article Dharmesh
<p> posted on Tuesday, November 16, 2010 at 2:44 PM by Web hosting </p>  My 
opinion is next:&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
PHP as language is really good. If you 
know how to accelerate, cache, optimize, etc... your application it will work 
like a little baby.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
If you to run something like spiders, 
crawlers, things like real-time chat etc... PHP is useless... You can sit, cry 
and cry... (You can do it but doing it in PHP is like a suicide...)&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
So how I like to do stuff: &nbsp; <br>
1.)Write site in php. Do 
massive caching agains HTML, PHP, do things like Varnish + Nginx and optimize 
database as much as possible.&nbsp;<br>
2.)All serious process =&gt; redirect 
to python.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Overall I cannot judge those languages. Python 
is python, as far I am concerned built for one thing. PHP is something else 
built for another thing no matter that both can be used for serving web 
pages.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
P.s. For me, Python is easier than PHP lol&nbsp; 
<br> 
<p> posted on Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at 5:30 AM by 0x19 </p>  ASP.NET is 
not suitable for public-facing web sites. It's suitable for enterprise intranet 
and limited extranet applications.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I say this after 
having managed multiple ASP.NET projects, some with 7-figure budgets, for 
enterprise customers in the insurance, banking and health care industries. 
ASP.NET is a fine choice if you're building a real, web-based enterprise 
solution where you can dictate the OS (Windows) and browser (Internet Explorer) 
that your users will rely on.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Take a look at this very 
site, however. The home page at onstartups.com has 1,095 validation errors and 
more than 1,100 validation warnings!&nbsp;<br>

http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://onstartups.com/&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>

That's ridiculous, but it's par for the course for a website built on ASP.NET, 
in my experience. Part of that is Microsoft's fault - they actually make it 
difficult to generate valid code with their tools, but part of it is also due 
to the fact that (in my experience) many .NET developers simply don't know (and 
often don't care) about how to develop correctly for the web. They may often 
understand how to develop proper business logic, but their web knowledge tends 
to lag far behind.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I have a customer who moved his 
website to HubSpot a year ago. I told him that, while the service looked very 
nice, I couldn't recommend that he host his site on an ASP.NET-based system. A 
year later, he's frustrated and ready to move again. Don't get me wrong - 
you've done an admirable job of building a really cool set of tools, but you've 
managed to do that despite ASP.NET and not because of it, and from what I hear 
from him and other customers, there's an inflexibility in HubSpot's 
applications that I imagine can be attributed, at least in part, to the fact 
that the tools are built on top of ASP.NET.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I know - 
don't fix it if it ain't broke, but you may want to consider migrating HubSpot 
to Python before you move on to your next startup ;-)

Milam - Great insite, thanks for sharing! I once read a blog post where someone 
said &quot;ASP.NET doesn't let you build 'web' apps, it lets you build ASP.NET 
apps that just so happen to live on the web.&quot; So true...
<p> posted on Friday, November 26, 2010 at 7:03 PM by Mike Schinkel </p>  This 
article was well written! I feel the same way about there being multiple 
frameworks in PHP. I've been using PHP for almost 5 years and I love a lot 
about it, mainly the OOP. However, the more I work in Python it appears the 
maintainability of a Python application will be MUCH easier. I am talking about 
Django Framework vs one of the PHP Frameworks. I like some PHP Frameworks too 
and will still use PHP but the more I learn about Python it seems like 
everything you said on here is true.
<p> posted on Saturday, November 27, 2010 at 6:28 PM by Jesse </p>  I don't 
really have a strong preference between python or PHP, but this article lists 
more pros for PHP than it does Python... &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
The only pro 
for Python is #1 - Python is well-designed, PHP is not, but you don't give any 
reasons or examples as to WHY Python is well-designed (not that it isn't)&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp; <br>
Your other points read as follows:&nbsp; <br>
#2 - PHP has more 
frameworks&nbsp;<br>
#3 - PHP is popular&nbsp; <br>
#4 - PHP hosting costs 
less&nbsp;<br>
#5 - Some Python fans are fad-focused elitists&nbsp; <br>
#6 - 
PHP has a low learning curve&nbsp;<br>
