<h3>Nikon D4 beats Canon DSLRs, D3x, D700 in lab test</h3> jmeyer | News | 
16/03/2012 17:13pm <br>

<p>Our testing team has the Nikon D4 in for testing and has found that the D4 
beats the Nikon D3x, Canon EOS 1D Mark IV, Nikon D700 and Canon EOS 5D Mark II 
in our signal to noise ratio when shooting JPEGS.</p> 
<p>Our lab includes a specially designed chart which is shot in carefully 
controlled conditions, with the resulting images analysed using DXO Analyser 
software.<br>
 Our team tests for both signal to noise ratio &ndash; which 
indicates how clean an image will be, and dynamic range.</p> 
<p>Though the Nikon D4 came tops when shooting JPEGs, with raw images the 
Nikon D4 beats everything aside from the Canon EOS 5D Mark II between ISO 1600 
and 6400. Right up at ISO 6400, it is also beaten by the Nikon D700.</p> 0
