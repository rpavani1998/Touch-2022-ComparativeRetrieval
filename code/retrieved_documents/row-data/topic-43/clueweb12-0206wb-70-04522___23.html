<h1> How to Photograph Christmas Decorations </h1> 
<p>Every photographer, from amateur to professional, will take pictures of 
Christmas Decorations because these are beautiful, eye catching, and most of 
all, memorable.<br>
 From the view of the entire Christmas tree, to close-ups 
on simple and sophisticated decorations, it&rsquo;s all sparkle and lovely. For 
the shots, remember to have a tripod and a remote controller.<br>
 For the 
first Christmas tree picture, my friend Tudor used flash (with -2 exposure) in 
rear mode, in low light. Picture was taken in &ldquo;Program&rdquo; mode.<br>
 
The second Christmas tree picture has +3 exposure, no flash, and low light 
environment. Longer exposure time in this case: 20 sec.. Picture was taken in 
&ldquo;Shutter Mode&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
 The white balance in case of such 
photographs is better set to &ldquo;auto&rdquo; since the colors from the 
lights differ from the environmental light and other lights coming from nearby. 
After all, the multitude of colorful lights is what makes Christmas beautiful.
<br> Now let&rsquo;s see the close-ups: the most simple setting scheme is: 
&ldquo;Program&rdquo; Mode, rear flash, adjusted exposure (differs from scene 
to scene), tripod and remote control or 2 seconds shutter delay. For brighter 
scenes you can put the flash off and increase ISO.<br>
<br>
 On most of the 
photos, on post-processing, I added a warm filter to make the tree have a 
yellowish green, and to make the red color stronger.</p> 
<h1> How to shoot great pictures of caves &ndash; a guide to cave photography 
</h1> 
<p>During these summer months, I&rsquo;ve been traveling to various caves in 
Romania. First, I will show you the pictures I took with Nikon D40x, 18mm lens, 
and then I will tell you how to obtain something similar yourself.<br>
<br>
 
Doing cave photography is an exercise in frustration. The biggest problem is 
that you are working in near total darkness. Trying to photograph large 
formations, especially when they are beyond the limits of your headlamp, can be 
nearly impossible. (It&rsquo;s best to have your own lamp with you, however, in 
my case, the cave was illuminated for tourists since many years).</p> 
<p><strong>Composition</strong> is based on everything you already know about 
landscape photography as much as it is on your headlamp. Focusing can be 
similarly difficult. Lighting placement may seem easy at first until you get 
your processed images back and discover the glaringly over or underexposed 
portions of the photograph. By this time, you&rsquo;re probably miles away from 
the cave with no intention of returning to it anytime soon. This can be very 
frustrating.</p> 
<p>As for composition, you can make landscapes, covering the entire cave, you 
can focus on details &ndash; certain interesting formations, or, you can have a 
person standing there, adding the human factor to the natural environment of 
the cave. But, to be more specific, a good photograph does not have a person 
&ldquo;standing&rdquo; in the picture, but actually &ldquo;doing&rdquo; 
something: climbing or other action inside the cave.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The <strong>camera settings</strong> I used are:</p> 
<p><strong>1. shutter speed mode: </strong>around 1/30sec (longer exposure 
time will likely cause motion blur and overexposed areas near the lighting 
source)<br>
<strong>2. ISO 1600</strong> (Slower speeds limit your capability 
with the light sources you carry, faster speeds give you more of a problem with 
contrast and graininess)<br>
<strong>3. exposure +3,+4, +5</strong> (depending 
on how illuminated the scene was) &ndash; if your camera supports bracketing, 
do so &ndash; it&rsquo;s very hard to get the right exposure from the first shot
<br> <strong>4. flash on: rear mode</strong> (this is what creates a different 
light color in the pictures &ndash; the blue one, for near objects)<br>
<strong>
5. manual white balance</strong> (I played a bit with this one in the ice cave)
</p> 
<ul></ul> 
<p>Now let&rsquo;s talk about lighting -<strong> illuminating the scene
</strong>. Using the flash is not necessary if you want to create a mystery 
scene in which all is black but the lamp illuminated formation. But, I do 
believe that lighting is the most effective tool of a great cave picture (and, 
after all, you are providing all the lighting for the image), so I&rsquo;m 
going to point out some tips fromephotozine:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Cave photographers mostly use flashguns as their primary light, followed by 
bulbs as their second main source. Each have their own advantages and 
disadvantages. Bulbs of all shapes and sizes are still used a lot by cave 
photographers. There are several reasons why they have not been totally 
replaced by the use of flashguns &ndash; they have a higher light output than 
many strobes. When photographing a large room, nothing beats the output of a 
flashbulb. They also give off a wider arc of light than a strobe.</p> 
<p>Slaves are remote electronic switches that you attach to each of the 
different flash units distributed around your cave photo area. The flash on 
your camera sends out the message to all the slaves to fire when your camera 
shutter opens. In this way, they are all synchronized and give you the perfect 
exposure. This also helps to eliminate the need for tripod.</p> 
<p>A dramatic effect can be created by strongly backlighting a subject (along 
with a properly lit foreground) such that the backlight creates a slightly 
burned edge to offset it from the darker background. Try putting a light on 
either side of a subject with the lights aimed at one another.</p> 
<p>In close-up shots, the use of a softened light (soft box or even just a 
piece of tissue over the flash tube) is frequently better than a hard light. 
Sometimes the cave passage itself, if it is reflective, can serve as a bit of 
soft box on its own.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>As a last word, I remember you to do not touch or walk on formations or 
clean areas that are off trail &ndash; protect the nature or else you will only 
picture the past and not the eternity.</p> 
<h1> Rockets&rsquo; Red Glare: How to Photograph Fireworks </h1> 
<p><em>Fourth of July celebrations often end with a firework extravaganza that 
captivates us all with its awesome beauty. So be prepared to &ldquo;ooh&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;ah&rdquo; along with the crowd. And, if you&rsquo;re like many of 
us, plan to have your camera ready to capture the &ldquo;rockets red 
glare.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>What&rsquo;s the best way to take &ldquo;great&rdquo; firework photos? 
According to Chuck DeLaney, Dean of the New York Institute of Photography 
(NYI), the world&rsquo;s largest photography school, it&rsquo;s easy if you do 
a couple of simple things. &ldquo;Most of all you need a steady camera, a long 
exposure, and medium speed ISO setting,&rdquo; DeLaney explains.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>First, </strong>you&rsquo;ll want to take a time-exposure. If you 
have an SLR camera, this should be no problem. Many point-and-shoot cameras 
have a special Fireworks setting, but if the camera you are using 
doesn&rsquo;t, try to &ldquo;fool&rdquo; the camera into keeping the shutter 
open. Here&rsquo;s how: When you see a rocket shoot skyward, press the 
shutter-button. The darkness of the sky should cause your camera to keep the 
shutter open for a time-exposure, and you can end up with a splendid picture.
<br> What about using a single-use &ldquo;cardboard&rdquo; disposable camera? 
NYI says, forget it! These cameras usually have a fixed shutter speed, and you 
can&rsquo;t &ldquo;fool&rdquo; them into doing the right thing no matter what 
you do.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Second</strong>, and equally important, since you are taking a 
time-exposure, your camera should be on a solid, unmoving base throughout the 
exposure. A tripod is best. If you don&rsquo;t have a tripod, try bracing your 
camera against some solid structure &ndash; for example, a wall, a post, or a 
railing. They&rsquo;re not as good as a tripod, but they&rsquo;re better than 
hand-holding your camera. And hand-holding is the road to disaster &ndash; no 
one likes blurry fireworks photos.</p> 
<p><strong>Third</strong>, to add an extra-special touch to your picture, try 
to include something on the ground to give a sense of location to the firework 
display in the sky. For example, across the bottom of your frame you might show 
silhouettes of the crowd, or a statue (George Washington on horseback?), or the 
skyline of thecity. This one trick will do more to make your fireworks pictures 
stand out than any other single thing you can do. &ldquo;There are some special 
do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts that will help digital photographers get the best 
results,&rdquo; notes DeLaney. &ldquo;We<br>
 written a special article just to 
address those issues.&rdquo;</p>

<h1> Remote Controls for Your Camera </h1> 
<p>I had the idea to inform myself (and you) about this camera accessories 
because I felt the need of a remote control while shooting night Christmas 
scenes. To explain better, my Nikon D40x, like many other cameras, can not make 
an exposure longer than 30 seconds without a remote &ndash; at least 
that&rsquo;s what the manual says. I did managed to get to &ldquo;bulb&rdquo; 
option on manul mode, but, for that, I needed to keep my finger on the sutter, 
fact which causes the camera to shake and the picture gets blurry. Therefor, 
I&rsquo;ll start with pointing out the advantages of a remote control and then 
I&rsquo;ll give you a list of remote controls to choose from according to your 
camera.<br>
 A remote switch is a cable with a switch on the end &ndash; just 
as simple as that. It duplicates the action of the shutter button 
&acirc;&circ;&rsquo; half pressure activates the exposure metering and focus 
while full pressure fires the shutter. The units differ simply in the length of 
the cable and the type of connecter plug used to attach the cable to the camera.
<br> A remote switch will allow you to fire your camera without the need to 
touch it. This is very useful when the camera is fixed to a tripod or supported 
on a wall. It eliminates the movement that can be transmitted to the camera as 
the shutter button is pressed.<br>
 One of the question you might have is 
&ldquo;why are some cables longer than others? why is lenght important?&rdquo;.
<br> The answer is that when you are further away from the camera, you have 
more chances to remain unnoticed by the photographed subject &ndash; speaking 
of wildlife photography. Extension cables are suitable for such situations.<br>

 So let&rsquo;s go back to the situation I mentioned at the begining: I want to 
make a long exposure using a remote controler.<em>With a remote release, once 
you have pressed the button you can lock it down by sliding the button forward. 
Now the shutter will stay open without you having to keep pressure on the 
button. This &acirc;&euro;&tilde;running lock&acirc;&euro;&trade; means you are 
free to work with very long exposures, limited only by your 
camera&acirc;&euro;&trade;s battery life. To close the camera shutter, simply 
slide the remote switch button back and let go.</em><br>
So war I&rsquo;ve been 
talking about the traditional way of remote picturing, but, the&rsquo;s a new 
and more effective way these days: A wireless controller not only acts like 
your television remote controller, but it also works in the same way 
&acirc;&circ;&rsquo; by infrared. More than that, a friend of mine has an 
universal remote controller which is his TV controller and camera controller in 
the same device. A wireless controller has a transmitter and a receiver. The 
receiver is connected to the remote plug on the camera, and an extension cable 
can be attached if you need to be even further away.</p> 
<p><em>Question: </em>How long can this exposure be?<br>
<em>Answer: </em>
Digital cameras need power when the shutter is open to keep the CMOS sensor 
active. This means their maximum exposure time is likely to be shorter than 
that for film cameras.<br>
<strong>IMPORTANT TIP FOR LONG EXPOSURES: If you are 
interested in shooting star trails, you will reduce the noise levels in the 
images by shooting on cold winter nights rather than warm summer evenings.
</strong></p> 
<h2><strong>For Canon users:</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>RS-80N3: 80mm cable with N3 connector for professional and 
mid-range digital EOS cameras<br>
 RS-60E3: 60mm cable with E3 connector for 
entry-level digital EOS cameras<br>
 RS-60T3: 60cm cable with T3 connector for 
early EOS models<br>
 TC-80N3<br>
 Wireless Controller LC-5</strong></p> 
<p>More complex remote controler like the TC-80N3 have a few extra features 
over and above other remote switches: a built-in self-timer, interval timer and 
long exposure timer, which can all be set in one second increments from one 
second to 99 hours. It also features an exposure count setting.<br>
 As for the 
connectors, take a look at E3 and N3 in the firts place, but note that there is 
no adaptor that allows you to use a N3 remote switch with an E3-compatible 
camera. This means that it not possible to use a TC-80N3 with any of the 
E3-compatible cameras, such as the EOS 350D or 400D.</p> 
<h2><strong>For Nikon users:</strong></h2>

<h1> 4th July Fireworks Photography in 5 Easy Steps </h1> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
 Get a tripod with you. A cable release can 
also be helpful if you can get that attached to the camera.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Step 2:</strong><br>
 Try finding a high place for observing and shooting the 
sky show, with no unwanted obstacles.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
 Adjust your camera settings like this:<br>
 - 
continuous mode active with the maximum number of shots and about 1s delay 
between<br>
 - some cameras have a preset &acirc;&euro;&oelig;fireworks 
mode&acirc;&euro;&#157; that automatically adjusts shutter speed and aperture 
(like most of the Canon models), but if your camera doesn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t 
have it, here&acirc;&euro;&trade;s a hint: Shutter Speed: 2 , Aperture: 8.0<br>

 - if you done the first step, don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t worry to much about the 
ISO so let it as low as possible for low noise; also don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t 
set the flash on<br>
 - if the camera has a sharpening adjustment control, set 
it to very sharp</p> 
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
 When actually pressing the shutter button, 
wait for the burst to explode, but, until that moment, keep the button 
half-pressed (focused ready). Then, with the 1s delay set up, the rest should 
become easily synchronized. Get creative by framing your fireworks with the 
surrounding buildings or capturing the city lights below the fireworks. Some 
places allow a nice effect of the fireworks reflections on the water.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>
 Your final image can be processed on the 
computer in order to obtain more fireworks in one single picture: a merging 
process of more shots with no blending. (This is called double exposure 
technique)</p>

<h1> 3 Simple Solutions for Shooting Against the Light in Photography that Work
</h1> 
<p><br>
<br>
<strong>Shooting against the light</strong> has always been a 
tricky thing in photography: if you choose to set a longer exposure or just to 
increase the exposure compensation in order to have plenty of light over the 
near subject, the background will appear burned (<em>overexposed</em>). The 
other way around, if you choose the right exposure for the background (the 
usual auto or program mode will do that), then your subject will appear too 
dark (<em>underexposed</em>).</p> 
<p>The solutions I will present depends on the situation in which you will 
find yourself. Let&rsquo;s look at them.</p> 
<h2>Solution 1 &ndash; Use Flash Even in a Sunny Day</h2> 
<p>If you are close enough to your subject, like for instance in portrait 
photography,<strong>using the flash</strong> even if it is a very sunny day 
will fix the problem in a very simple and effective way.<br>
</p> 
<h2>Solution 2 &ndash; D-light Function</h2> 
<p>But what if your subject is too far away (like far buildings) and you 
can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t or just don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to try a 
different angle with the sun behind you? Or what if it is night and a lamp 
illuminates the place? Will you be pleased with the overexposed lamp due to the 
long exposure needed in night conditions? Some new cameras (HP Photosmart R727, 
R827, R927, Nikon D80, Nikon Coolpix S50 and S50c, S200, S500, P5000, the Nikon 
L series, ) come with a function called <strong>D-Lighting</strong> (or <strong>
adaptive lighting</strong>). This function will solve the problem automatically.
<br> </p> 
<h2>Solution 3 &ndash; Photoshop Manipulation</h2> 
<p>But what if your camera does not have this function? The salvation in this 
case is a<strong>Photoshop manipulation</strong>.<br>
 When shooting, make 
several frames with different exposures. In my example (with Canon PowerShot 
A520), the dark photo was made with: aperture F 3.2, exposure time 0.100 sec; 
and the light one with: aperture F 3.2, exposure time 0.400 sec. 
It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s much recommended to have a tripod and take the pictures 
using it because of 2 reasons: a brighter picture may require a longer exposure 
time (if you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t want to deal with a lot of noise you will 
prefer a longer time instead of higher ISO and aperture) so you need to avoid 
camera shake (no matter how steady your hands are, night condition will always 
require a tripod), and the second reason: the frames should be taken from the 
same angle and viewpoint. Unfortunately, at the time I shot the images in this 
example, I did not have a tripod so the bright image is blured due to camera 
shake, but I somehow managed to take quite similar frames.<br>
 In a Photoshop 
document, place the 2 frames as different layers in such way that the darker 
one will be under the lighter one.<br>
 Choose the <strong>eraser</strong> with 
<em>a size bigger than the lamp</em> (or whatever your overexposed object is),
<em> low hardness and low opacity</em> as shown in the figure. This will softly 
erase the area around the lamp in the lighter frame revealing the darker frame 
behind in such way that the 2 images will come together graduated, not 
suddenly. But the inner portion of the lamp from the darker image is not yet 
fully revealed. Change the eraser option like this:<em>smaller size to fit only 
the interior of the lamp, full 100% opacity and 100% hardness</em>.<br>
<br>
 
Once you erase the red marked area, you will notice that even if the pictures 
come together softly, the colors are not the same. You can adjust the gradient 
by moving onto the dark image layer, in the menu &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<strong>
Image</strong>&acirc;&euro;&#157; -&gt; &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<strong>Adjustments
</strong>&acirc;&euro;&#157; select <strong>Selective Color</strong>. Play 
around with the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<strong>neutrals</strong>
&acirc;&euro;&#157; until you are satisfied with the color gradient around the 
lamp. When all this is done, go to the menu &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<strong>Layer
</strong>&acirc;&euro;&#157; and select &acirc;&euro;&oelig;<strong>Merge 
Visible</strong>&acirc;&euro;&#157; (or press Shift + Ctrl+E). This step will 
merge the 2 images and now, if you are still not satisfied with this result, 
you can play around with<em>blur tool</em> and <em>healing brush</em> before 
saving the final image.<br>
<br>
</p>

</strong> check them on Amazon. They are quite amazing and useful.</p>

<h1> How to Shoot Roads in Photography </h1> 
<p> What do you have in mind when taking pictures on a highway? Maybe the road 
signs. Yes, it&rsquo;s a good idea but here I&rsquo;m not talking about that.
<br> Road construction requires the creation of a continuous right-of-way, 
overcoming geographic obstacles and having grades low enough to permit vehicle 
or foot travel. This means you will find interesting sinuous shapes of roads.
</p> 
<p>Notice that in most of the cases the road should be free of cars and 
walkers. Two exceptions are noticeable: the pictures depicting intense city 
traffic and the night roads when a car leaves behind a rail of light.</p> 
<p>As for the composition, <strong><em>it&rsquo;s always a good idea to start 
the road from a corner of the picture up to the middle or the other corner</em>
</strong>. In most of the cases it will appear larger in the starting corner 
and thinner at the end. However, sometimes, when symmetry allows, you can start 
and end your road line in the middle of the picture.</p> 
<p>As I said many times before, following the weather helps a lot: fog or rain 
give special effects, and, in the case of train rails, sunrise is also creating 
a mystical atmosphere.</p>
