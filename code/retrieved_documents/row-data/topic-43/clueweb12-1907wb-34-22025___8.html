<h2>  16 Giant Leaps Forward for the Nikon D3S DSLR Camera </h2> 1. For 
digital photography, as a whole, the Nikon D3 was definitely a major 
game-changer, especially because its greater ISO sensitivity captures better 
images in low light. The newer D3S isn&rsquo;t as revolutionary, but simply 
continues the good fight with various refinements that make it essentially a 
better D3. These improvements may not, at first, seem to be giant leaps 
forward, but any advances of DSLR capabilities at this level are likely to be 
viewed as jumping a chasm to the photographers who need what the D3S delivers.
<p>2. If you prefer to spend less time rooting through camera menus to select 
various settings, and more time shooting, then the Nikon D3S is a welcome 
alternative. A new, dedicated live view button is in plain sight at the back of 
the camera and you&rsquo;ll have quick access to an info button to choose color 
space and noise reduction.</p> 3. The 12.1-mega-pixel, full-frame (36 x 24 mm) 
sensor is also a breath of fresh air, as the D3S produces exceptional image 
quality from Nikon&rsquo;s RAW file format, 14-bit uncompressed NEFs (Nikon 
Electronic Format).<br>

Video, 3 LCD, CMOS Sensor, Scene Recognition, Body Only <br>
$5,119.00 <br>
<br>
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>4. Another significant improvement found in the Nikon D3S is the larger 
buffer, which allows for very acceptable images in lower light and more than 30 
RAW frames in one burst. This makes the D3S an excellent tool in the hands of 
sports and action photographers, who typically shoot 14-bit NEF files. The 
larger buffer also means that performance will not suffer in most shooting 
situations.</p> 
<p>5. A definite mighty leap beyond the D3 and most of the competition is the 
D3S&rsquo;s rather extraordinary ISO range, especially at the high end. Select 
ISO sensitivities above 6,400 and the D3S gives any photographer a one-stop 
advantage over the Canon EOS 1D Mark IV, for example.<br>

<br> <br>

<p>A third-party test demonstrated the D3S&rsquo;s capability to generate 
photos at ISO 12,800 and greater that register details and precise color and 
are free of banding. The sensor of the D3S has no equal when it comes to 
transforming light into balanced images.</p> 
<p>6. The DX format has its place for many digital photography assignments, 
but the 1.2X-crop mode should pique the interest of action photographers, which 
is one of Nikon&rsquo;s primary target markets for the D3S. The 1.2X-crop mode 
creates an 8.4MP file, which is comparable to the magnification of 
Canon&rsquo;s EOS 1-D series of cameras. Although the maximum frame rate of 9 
fps (frames per second) is the same as the FX format, you&rsquo;ll be able to 
record large/fine JPEGs in full-speed burst of approximately 105 frames, 
compared to 78.</p> 
<p>7. The Nikon D3S is the company&rsquo;s first professional DSLR with a 
D-Move mode and enhanced video capture at 720x1280p. The resolution may be the 
same as the D90, the first Nikon DSLR that could shoot video, but the D3S has 
contrast-detection AF (auto-focus) during filming and supports a plug-in stereo 
microphone.</p> 
<p>8. What excites digital photographers the most about the D3S&rsquo;s video 
capabilities is that it can shoot video throughout the entire ISO sensitivity 
range, including the &ldquo;High-Sensitivity&rdquo; mode, to ISO 102,400. The 
HS mode is extremely useful when the light level is low, although the resulting 
video is much grainer. Despite that the Nikon D3S will still produce acceptable 
video that most hobbyist/family video equipment is incapable of duplicating.</p>
<p>9. You&rsquo;ll be able to shoot video in any of the PASM modes. Press the 
OK button before or during shooting and you&rsquo;ll initiate real-time 
metering. Then, as you would with still digital photos, you can use the shutter 
and/or aperture settings to control the video brightness. Change the aperture 
during shooting and you&rsquo;ll increase or decrease the depth of field, 
without the need to pre-set the lens to a chosen aperture.</p> 
<p>10. The Nikon D3S shoots 11 frames per second in continuous, and DX, mode.
</p> 
<p>11. The D3S is equipped with a multi-CAM3500FX auto-focus sensor (51-point, 
15 cross-type and more vertical coverage), which is fine-tuned for improved 
acquisition and tracking.</p> 
<p>12. This Nikon model supports DX lenses. The viewfinder automatically masks 
(5.1 mega-pixels with a DX lens).</p> 
<p>13. The Nikon D3S has dual compact flash card slots (overflow, back-up, RAW 
on 1/JPEG on 2, Stills on 1/Movies on 2, copy).</p> 
<p>14. The D3S comes with a three-inch, 922,000-pixel LCD monitor.</p> 
<p>15.&nbsp; Contrast-detect auto-focus has been significantly improved at 30% 
faster; and live view operates with CD or phase detect (mirror up/down).</p> 
<p>16. Nikon has chosen to design the D3S to produce greater image quality at 
high ISO sensitivities, which does limits resolution, but this is the trade-off 
photographers must contemplate before plunking down $5,200 to $6,400 for the 
D3S body. The dealmaker is for those photographers who would prefer versatility 
and speed to additional resolution. If that describes you, then you 
shouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take a leap at the opportunity to own a Nikon D3S.
