<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Recently we asked our readers whether they preferred to use a <strong>Nikon
</strong> or a <strong>Canon</strong>. The results have been tallied and here 
are the findings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While it seems readers favour Nikon, it&rsquo;s hard to tell which one is 
actually the best. Canon and Nikon are both multi-billion dollar optical 
companies that have been making some of the finest optics for consumers, 
military and industrial applications for decades. They compete so heavily 
against each other in the same market that if one really were the best, the 
other would have gone out of business long ago. These companies tend to merely 
leapfrog one another in terms of who comes out top at the end of each year.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>The facts</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3><strong>Which camera the is most popular?</strong></h3> 
<p>Experts and users reviewed Canon and Nikon DSLRs worldwide. In looking at 
reviews and calculating an average score out of 10 points between 2006 and 
2011, this is what they rated.</p> 
<p><strong>Users</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Although it&rsquo;s close, Nikon is the users&rsquo; favourite. But what do 
the experts say?</p> 
<p><strong>Experts</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>There is not much between the two brands, as the experts believe that both 
cameras are deservedly good at an average of 8.7 for Canon and 8.6 for Nikon. 
However, on average Nikon is the most popular.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><strong>Who has the bigger global market share?</strong></h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Canon is the clear winner in the sales category, but while the massive 
sales volume tips the scales in its favour, it has no effect on camera 
users&rsquo; opinion on both brands, with Nikon only just ekeing out a win in 
the popularity contest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> 
<p>After all is said and done, it really is hard to pick a clear winner: the 
two brands are technically as good as one other and the determining factor 
comes down to personal taste. Why do you prefer one over the other? Tell us in 
the comments box below.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Buyer&rsquo;s tip</strong></p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a favourite, look at what each company is offering 
at the time of you investing in equipment. For example, value for money, 
compatibility, flexibility and what you are personally used to. This will allow 
you to make the best decision that suits you.</p>

<p>My father&rsquo;s Nikon FM from 1982 is fully compatible with my new lenses 
and his 1982 lenses are still compatible with my new Nikon. Nikon gives a free 
high quality photography course when you buy one of their cameras. Brilliant. I 
have only ever used Nikon, but I&rsquo;m sure Canon is pretty great. Nikon has 
my heart, and mind.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I have been using a Nikon product for the past 32 years and recommend Nikon 
to anyone out there looking for a camera. Easy usability and final results are 
never dissapointing. Hardly ever have to delete a photo. Definition is 
fantastic. I am now on a 3100 and just love it. I still have my SLR for film 
and would love to sell it even though it is in perfect condition. I have a D50 
with a telephoto lense and a 3100.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Funny enough, when I started looking at buying a DSLR, Canon was always on 
my mind. However, the day I got money in my hands, I bought a Nikon D60 and 
just loved it. A year later, I acquired the magnificent D300s. I was blown away 
and have never looked back since. I know Canon are good cameras (I sometimes 
use my brother&rsquo;s 550d, which is a great camera and nearly bought a 60D 
last year) but Nikon has now my preference&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>I switched from Pentax to Canon twenty years ago.<br>
 Lenses I bought then 
still fit my current 5D and 5D Mark II.<br>
 There is a ready second hand 
market for Canon products so it is easy to progressively trade up.<br>
 Nikon 
lens technology is great but Canon image sensor technology is better (IMHO).<br>
 Long term I bet on Canon because of its market dominance and hence its larger 
R&amp;D budget.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I always used a Nikon, I very good Nikon camera&rsquo;s, however I finally 
bought a Canon, and am thrilled with it. Nikon&rsquo;s camera&rsquo;s seemed to 
be a lot slower, perhaps they gave more options to edit where the Canon&rsquo;s 
quality is simply in image and their product and they allow the user to edit on 
the computer. I am happy with Canon. I just wish printing photographs was more 
simple now as I find the machines at camera printing shops either crop 
one&rsquo;s photo on their own accord and just seem too problematic. I 
sometimes miss the days of handing in one&rsquo;s negatives&hellip; (and I am 
not old). Smiles. Is the quality of home printing of the same standard compared 
to that of a shops? It&rsquo;s so lovely to sit with photographs in an album 
instead of a computer but I really battle to face trying to get them off the 
disk and deal with those machines&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>Seems like only 7% know their stuff. It does not matter, Nikon or Canon, 
pretty much the same thing. What is better BMW or Merc (lets not even go there 
).</p> 
<p>An important thing to realize is that both are proprietary systems, and 
once you have a few bodies and lenses with one brand, you are 
&ldquo;stuck&rdquo; with that brand. Not such a bad thing IMHO, as both are 
pretty much on par quality, lenses, etc.</p> 
<p>Some claim Nikon has better lenses, but they are more expensive, but I 
think a more accurate statement would be that Canon covers a wider range of 
lenses, therefore some Canon users choose to buy the cheaper options, but they 
have lenses just as good as the Nikon ones.</p> 
<p>I love the comment by Carel above. So true!! &ldquo;Which camera should you 
buy? Either a Canon OR and Nikon&rdquo; &hellip;both are excellent.</p> Reply

<p>When my Pentax died I was looking at replacing it with Canon 
(Brother-in-law influence). I did all the research of equivalent models and 
came up with Nikon suiting my purposes better. I then looked into Fuji (Photo 
Club peer pressure). Ended up getting the Fuji FinePix S5. It uses the Nikon 
D200 body with Fuji insides, and all Nikon lenses fit. My next body will be 
Nikon as I believe they have better colour definition and dynamic range. Canon 
has better sales purely because they market wider.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I only use Nikon and the reason for this is I can take any nikon lense from 
any year and it will fit my camera! The other reason is Nikon&rsquo;s business 
is cameras and lenses thats all they have been making since the 
beginning&hellip; So they focus only on making the best even better!!!</p> Reply

<p>I think that the photographer gets locked in a brand, the day he/she 
decides to do photography, the lenses are expensive. I change in brand will 
therefore be a huge cost.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the comments stating that both brands are 
great- they are and are global market leaders. It really does come down to 
personal preferences. Mine being Nikon because for me, I like the way they 
handle. I also echo the comments about Nikon &amp; lenses- my boss has a VERY 
OLD 400mm lens which has no af &amp; no gearing fits my trusty OLD D70. My best 
friend can use my lenses on his D200&hellip; I know that when I can afford to 
upgrade to one of the models in the D3/ D300 range, my lenses &amp; theirs(!) 
will fit. Nice having a boss who shares your passion for photography (and their 
lenses!) I also find the colour saturation better with Nikon &amp; it 
reproduces black with less &lsquo;blocking&rsquo;. Personal opinion- of course!
</p> 
<p>Great informative review too. Evidences the power of great marketing </p>

<p>In South Africa, the level, standard and professionalism of after sales 
customer service far exceeds that of Canon.. Just read the comments for both 
manufacturers on &ldquo;Hello Peter.com&rdquo; The superiority of the back up 
and after sales service of Nikon brand is more than a compelling reason to buy 
a Nikon product!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I bought a Nikon D50 in 2006 and take it with me on all our hiking trips. 
It fell a few times accidentally I had to clear the lenses due to dust on it 
maybe I am just very lucky &lsquo;touch wood&rsquo;. I once fell off a 6m high 
bridge (which broke underneath me) into a river with my Nikon hanging around my 
neck. Afterwards all I did was taking it apart and left it in the sun for a few 
hours to dry out! The next day I took photo&rsquo;s again, although the first 
few had a cloudy look (filter look) but since then nothing wrong. I am still 
taking beautiful pictures, (maybe a proffesional will tell me that I do have a 
low standard?) I&rsquo;M HAPPY . . .</p> Reply <br>

<p>The D50 is a very special camera. Although it is quite old now and 
&lsquo;only&rsquo; has 6 megapixels, the sensor is something special with great 
colours and low noise for its age. It has a special affinity for the 80-400VR 
lens and also works very well with the 18-200VR. I have tried to replace it 
with both D40x and D60, but have ended up selling them and keeping the D50.</p> 
<p>You need to go to the D90/D7000 to get a real upgrade,</p> Reply <br>

<p>Since my first camera almost 30 years ago I have always and only used Nikon 
and have alway believed in Nikon. However, two years ago I bought a D90 and 
ever since have had problems. I took it in to be repared 4 times and they never 
found the problem. Kept on replacing a part and kept on saying it was in 
perfect condition, but my old D50 still takes better pictures. I was very 
disappointed and must admit after all this time my I am thinking of trying 
Canon. The only problem is, as mentioned here below, I will have to replace all 
my lenses and that becomes costly&hellip;&hellip;. I had alwyas promoted Nikon, 
but not anymore.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I fully agree with John Gore, both brands are great and it&rsquo;s all 
about personal choice. It is also important for those that do compare the 2 
brands to make sure that they compare cameras that are on the same level 
otherwise the results will be misleading. I am currently using a Canon 60D and 
am very happy with the quality of the pics even with the kit lense.</p> 
<p>Nikon is much more aggressive in its marketing approach in SA than Canon.

<p>This article is a rehash of the one in Beste Product (Dutch) and Peta 
Pixel. Total sales figures do not say much as the camera market is segmentised. 
It gets even more difficult because Canon also make copier and printers which 
are often included in sales figures. Nikon may lead Canon sales in one area and 
vice versa in another.</p> 
<p>My area of interest is the pro DSLR segment where Nikon and Canon are 
constantly leap-frogging each other. Nikon has just released the D4 and D800 
which trump the 1DMkIV and 5DMkII but Canon has the new 1DX and will soon have 
the eagerly expected 5DII replacement. It really is a Merc/Audi/BMW scenario.
