<h1>The Complete Nikon D3100 Review</h1> 
<p>by Gevon Servo on February 19, 2011</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>This is it, and it looks good, the Nikon D3100. When I had my first 
hands-on I had hopes for this camera. Nikon did not let me down. If you are 
looking to buy an entry level DSLR camera, or a low cost one, theNikon D3100 
will be on your list. I have used it thoroughly, and had more fun with the 
Nikon D3100 than I thought I would. The Nikon D3100 has improved on the D3000, 
which I did not like. With its size, 11 points of autofocus, 95% viewer 
coverage, great metering, ISO capabilities and 14 megapixel CMOS DX sensor, 
it&rsquo;s a very capable camera .</p>

<h3><strong>Best Uses</strong></h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>This Camera was fantastic for photo walking. It was easy to put away or 
hold at your side with aBlack Rapid RS-7 strap. Working with kids was fun too. 
The Nikon D3100 was not heavy and with care, my kids could try the camera out. 
My wife really liked the size of the camera. It fit her hands and she was able 
to use it right away. For folks making the move up to DSLR photography this 
camera is ideal. If you want to replace a camera like the Nikon D40 or D60 this 
is a camera to look at. You can use this camera to try every style of 
photography.</p> 
<h3><strong>What I did not like.</strong></h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>I did not like the LCD screen of the camera, I wish it had a screen 
protector like theNikon D90 or a fold away screen like the Nikon D5000. A new 
photographer will not always know how to take care of their camera. It is 
something that is learned. My old Canon Powershot S3IS has a fold away screen 
and that is one of the reasons I let my 3-year take photos with it. Withthe 
Nikon D3100, I did worry about scratching the screen and was always cleaning it.
</p> 
<p>I also wish there was an internal motor to autofocus older AF (screw-type) 
lenses. I believe all Nikon DSLR&rsquo;s should have that.</p> 
<h3><strong>Who Should Buy It?</strong></h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Nikon D3100 is a great camera for educational use. Its ease of use and 
low cost make it a great tool.Families will also love this camera, it is great 
for school photo&rsquo;s, family events and vacations due to its convenient 
size.For Foodies this is a great camera to take to a restaurant. Folks who just 
want a decent camera forphoto walking or street photography, this camera would 
fit the niche nicely.</p> 
<h3><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>I thought I would have more problems with this camera because I am used to 
more robust DSLR&rsquo;s cameras, like theNikon D90 or the D7000. Strangely, 
however, I found myself likingthe Nikon D3100. The camera was extremely 
practical, light, nimble, and easy to use.</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p> 
<p>can you please give me advice. I want to by my first SLR camera, and I 
cannot choose beetwen NIKON d3100 and CANON t2i. I can get it for the same 
price with 18-55 kit lens. &nbsp;Must admit that I&rsquo;m a beginner and i saw 
in live both cameras and like Nikon better only for it&rsquo;s size (because 
it&rsquo;s smaller) but friend told me that Canon t2i is better camera. Please 
help!!Thank You!&nbsp;</p> </li> </ul>
