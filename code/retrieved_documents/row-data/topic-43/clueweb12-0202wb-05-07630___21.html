<p>Canon Powershot G10 - With a profile like the New York city skyline, does 
the new Canon Powershot G10 have a bustling metropolis of features or is it a 
ghost town? Matt Grayson investigates.</p>  Posted: 22nd October 2008 <br>

Comment  Jargon Buster: Off <br>

<p>Following in the footsteps of one of the most popular digital compact 
cameras is the Canon Powershot G10. It has a higher resolution, better 
processor and some rearranged buttons.</p> 
<p><strong>Skip to Verdict</strong></p> 
<p> <strong>Canon Powershot G10: Specification</strong></p>

<li>Size: 109.1x77.7x45.9mm</li> 
<li>Weight: 350g</li> </ul> 
<p>At &pound;421, the Canon Powershot G10 offers a 5x optical zoom, external 
hotshoe, optical viewfinder and RAW recording. The Nikon Coolpix P6000 at 
&pound;369 has a 4x optical zoom, external hotshoe, optical viewfinder and RAW 
recording. Keep your eyes peeled for a forthcoming review.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3 at &pound;318 has a 2.5x optical 
zoom, non-dedicated external hotshoe, no optical viewfinder and RAW recording.
</p> <br>
<br>
<em>The exposure compensation wheel can be seen with the new 
location of the ISO dial on the opposite side of the hotshoe. Note also the 
custom button in the top corner on the back remains.</em> <br>
<br>
<em>The 
back is roughly similar in design to the G9 but buttons have been redesigned.
</em> <br>
<br>
<em>The best shot dial sits on top of the ISO dial which used 
to be on the opposite side.</em> <br>
<br>
<em>The main menu is brighter and 
has larger writing. Some options such as Flash control access a wider sub menu.
</em> <br>
<br>
<em>The AF square can be resized by pressing the display 
button. It can also be moved around the frame for off-centre focusing.</em> <br>
<br> 
<p><strong>Canon Powershot G10: Modes and features<br>
</strong>From a 
distance, the Canon Powershot G10 looks remarkably similar to it's older 
brother the G9. A square on front or rear view best shows the chimney-like 
stack of dials on the right shoulder. These accommodate the regular Best Shot 
dial on the top with the ISO dial sat below. On the G9, the ISO dial was on the 
left shoulder and this has been replaced with a dedicated exposure compensation 
dial.</p> 
<p>The mound of dials doesn't look altogether unpleasant though. It's not 
overtly annoying and certainly has an underlying advantage with creating more 
space to place the new dial on the top. The front lens bezel is still removable 
by pressing the discreet button in the bottom corner while the 5x optical zoom 
from the 28mm wide angle lens is also still operated by the zoom rocker with 
its diminutive size and recognisable springiness.</p> 
<p>The back of the unit looks similar to the G9 with the slight exception of 
the buttons being made larger and any writing has now been printed directly 
onto the corresponding button. The chrome buttons designated to the playback, 
power and shutter release have also been turned black.</p> 
<p>It's an interesting turn of viewpoint to add a dedicated exposure 
compensation dial on the top of the camera. This could be a nod towards the 
recent love of HDR photography by a lot of people. It could also simply be that 
Canon are listening to the public and that's what they asked for. I'd like to 
think the latter and it wouldn't be the first time that they did, remembering 
the release of the Canon EOS 50e just over ten years ago.</p> 
<p>The two main menus are still available with the function button, which is 
located in the centre of the location pad that sits in the middle of the thumb 
dial, giving access to the quick functions such as resolution, white balance, 
bracketing and the neutral density filter.</p> 
<p>In contrast, the main menu goes more indepth allowing you to make changes 
to features such as the AF flexizone which allows you to manipulate the focus 
area and is a useful feature for photographers who enjoy focus stacking. The 
main menu is exhaustive and would take an age to cover everything but needless 
to say there are some interesting features in there such as i-Contrast which is 
Canon's version of the Nikon D-Lighting, image stabiliser adjust, Servo AF, 
flash control which then accesses a sub-menu for these settings and drive 
settings for a new self portrait feature which I'll cover in the focus and 
metering area of the review.</p> 
<p>Other features that aren't so welcome include Safety MF which is a feature 
that overrides any of your settings if the camera thinks that the photograph 
might be incorrectly exposed. Add to that all of the theme menu, which is a 
waste of memory and you've a few items that either you don't want to or don't 
need to use.</p> 
<p>The size of the flexizone AF square can be adjusted by pressing the AF 
button just above the thumb wheel/navigation pad ensemble. This button also 
doubles as the delete function when you're in playback mode and discretly 
erasing all the blurry pictures that you never admit to taking.</p> 
<p>At the launch of the Canon Powershot G10, I was told by one of the 
technical departments henchmen that the 5x optical zoom can be increased by 
simply adjusting the resolution of the camera. He explained this under the 
logical premise that on the zoom bar, digital zoom is signified by a blue bar.
</p> 
<p>When you get to the maximum optical length, reducing the resolution then 
changes the digital area to yellow. He said that this is an extension of the 
optical zoom but in my further tests, the image breaks down in a similar way to 
the digital zoom so I remain sceptical. He also failed to mention that the 
optical zoom bar is white. This means that a yellow bar is neither digital nor 
optical zoom. So which is it? I asked Mike Burnhill who is the Digital SLR and 
EF lens product specialist who knew the answer to the question.</p> 
<p>He said: <em>&quot;White is the optical zoom, Blue is digital zoom and 
Yellow is safety zoom which works at image sizes other than Large JPEG and RAW. 
So, yes with the white zoom bar the image is magnified etc by using moving 
optics i.e. a zoom lens.</em></p> 
<p><em>In safety zoom mode, you have a lower resolution and so there are 
pixels not used, instead of down-resing the image (lowering the resolution), as 
is normally done in digital zoom i.e. 15 down to 10 using the cameras internal 
software. Safety zoom uses a cropped area of the sensor that matches the 
resolution being used and then the optical zoom. So it's using the optical 
magnification plus crop factor and no interpolation or down-resing. Digital 
zoom, uses a cropped area and then interpolates the image to the selected image 
size.&quot;</em></p> 
<p>What Mike is saying is that the breaking up of the image wasn't from the 
zoom actually being digital but simply the fact that the resolution is so low.
</p> 
<p><strong>Canon Powershot G10: Build and handling<br>
</strong>As the type of 
camera you'd buy either as a back up for your existing DSLR or as a smaller 
alternative if you're not quite ready to carry around loads of stuff then it's 
expected to be a good build. In fact it's just as good as the G9 before it and 
the G7 before that and the G6 before that etc. One thing I'm unsure about is 
the size of the sensor. I think a larger one could've possibly been placed 
inside not only to cope with the inherent noise that'll inevitably come with a 
higher resolution, but also because more detail will be recorded in the image 
and impress more people.</p> 
<p>As it happens, the sensor is the same size as the G9 which makes me dubious 
about the forthcoming noise tests.</p> 
<p>The lens isn't USM but does have image stabilisation built in. It also goes 
as wide at 28mm which is great for landscape photographers but with a wider 
bottom end comes a lower top end and the smaller zoom to previous models 
reaches a maximum 140mm.</p> 
<p>I think the battery door could be more solid in it's construction but it's 
the little touches such as the metal tripod bush and solid plastic port covers 
instead of rubber ones that make the difference.</p> 
<p>The newly released DiG!C IV processor has been installed into the G10 
which, Canon say, is roughly 1.3x faster than the DiG!C III that is found in 
the G9.</p> 
<p>More elements have been added to the lens construction and the G10 now has 
11 elements in 9 groups compared to the G9 which has 9 elements in 7 groups.</p>
<p>The rear screen has been improved upon with a higher resolution of 
461,000dots. This equates to around 153,666 pixels and means more detail can be 
seen in playback and when monitoring for manual focus or noise detection.</p> 
<p><strong>Canon Powershot G10: Performance</strong><br>
 In the burst mode, 
the Canon Powershot G10 managed 14 images in the ten second time span which 
works out at roughly 1.4fps (frames per second). Start up time is around a 
second with a shutter lag of 0.12sec which sounds great but is in fact slower 
than a lot of standard compacts. This really surprises me as I would've thought 
it to be faster than that especially as the G9 gave results of around the 
0.08sec mark.</p> <br>
<em>The skin tone colour is the same as the G9 but the 
primary colours look more saturated.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>For those of you currently owning a G9, I've circled the original colour 
chart used on the Canon Powershot G9 review last year for comparison. The 
primary colours on the new camera look richer which will be down to the new 
DiG!C IV processor.</p> 
<p>I originally thought that maybe the newer photograph was slightly under 
exposed but the lights are at a uniform setting and the skin tone tile looks 
the same. I like the colour reproduction on the colour chart image and the mono 
tones have also come out nicely balanced.</p> 
<p>One thing I'm uncertain about is the slight sharpening seen in the tiles at 
full magnification. This could be an indication of noise creeping through at 
low ISO.</p> <br>
<em>The landscape mode image.</em> <br>
<em>The 
aperture-priority landscape image.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>I took the landscape image in landscape mode and aperture-priority. Of 
course the maximum the aperture can go to in aperture-priority is f/8 which 
isn't ideal for landscape shots but is better than f/3.2 that landscape mode 
chose.</p> 
<p>The reason that it chose this aperture value is so it could use ISO80 to 
give as smooth an image as possible. Obviously this causes problems with a 
narrow depth of field but using a smaller f/18 or similar aperture would give 
longer exposures unless the ISO is cranked up.</p> 
<p>The detail on both shots is great but a slight purple line from fringing is 
detectable on the white bars. I like the grass colour which doesn't change 
through either picture but is a realistic reproduction. The similarities in 
both shots makes me wonder why they bother with the landscape mode at all.</p> 
<p>I'm surprised with the portrait shots. It was a bright day when I took them 
and set the white balance to the sunshine setting. The cast is a bit too strong 
for my taste although it's not something that can't be fixed in post.</p> <br>

<em>Portrait mode has given a blue cast despite the white balance put to the 
correct setting.</em> <br>
<em>Fill in flash has given a warmer tone to the 
image and added catchlights to the eyes.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>Using a burst of flash has helped warm the image back up and added some 
much needed catchlights to the eyes. The shadow on the background is soft and 
hardly noticeable but one thing I did notice was the green line of fringing 
around the top of the head.</p> <br>
<em>Macro gets as close as 1cm, just be 
careful of the shadow caused by the lens and top of the camera.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>Like the G9, the G10 offers a macro facility that can get as close as 1cm. 
It's great to be able to get so close into your subject although out of all the 
angles I tried with this photograph of the headphones, this was the only one 
that didn't cast a shadow from the top of the camera and lens. Be aware of 
where the light source is coming from to avoid this problem.</p> 
<p>Another problem gained from such close focusing is the lack of light 
entering the lens. In this instance it has forced the camera to open the 
aperture to f/2.8 in order to expose correctly. This causes a thin focal plane 
which can be seen running along the lettering on the headphones.</p> 
<p><strong>Canon Powershot G10: Focusing and metering<br>
</strong>The Canon 
Powershot G10 offers plenty of overriding features for focusing. Macro mode 
switches between close focusing down to 1cm and infinity and staying on the 
back of the camera is the flexible AF button which allows you to adjust the 
size of the focus square and where it's positioned. For those of you who enjoy 
doing it yourself, the Canon Powershot G10 offers manual focus and it's enabled 
by pressing the up button on the D-pad. A sliding scale appears on the right of 
the screen which will show you the distances and where the focus point 
corresponds to it.</p> <br>
<em>Face detection works well and can even have 
metering tied to it.</em> <br>
<br>

<p>Within the menu system, you can change the AF frame from AiAF to Flexizone 
or face detect. An interesting new feature of the G10 is the self portrait face 
detection. Setting the camera up in the same way as a normal self portrait with 
the timer, it takes a photograph two seconds after it detects a new face in the 
frame.</p> 
<p>Metering options are accessed from the button on the opposite corner of the 
D-pad and you can choose from centre-weighted, evaluative and spot. The great 
thing about the latter two are that they can work as usual or they can be 
assigned to the flexizone and collaborate with the focusing. In turn this can 
then be assigned to the face detection which ensures faces are perfectly 
exposed and focused.</p> 
<p><strong>Canon Powershot G10: Noise test<br>
</strong>I was initially 
surprised that the G10 only goes to ISO1600 with the release of the EOS 50D and 
5D MkII at the same time and their obvious advancements in noise control. I 
thought we'd see a bit of that technology rub off on the high end compacts and 
at least see a boost to ISO6400.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, there's no such input from the Canon ISO Integration 
Department (I made that up) and noise remains terrible at high settings. ISO80 
is lovely with sharp detail on the petals. This detail doesn't leave but 
problems have started to leak through at ISO200. To be fair, this is at full 
size enlargement and for me, the image doesn't become unbearable until ISO1600 
anyway. While ISO800 has the purple blobs in the shadow area and a distinct 
loss of detail in the petals, it's not threatening enough to worry over.</p> 
<p>With the results of the noise test I can see why they didn't simply put a 
couple more setting in and I think the high resolution and small sensor can 
partly be to blame for this.</p> <br>
<em>The ISO80 test.</em> <br>
<em>The 
ISO100 test.</em> <br>
<br>
<em>The ISO200 test.</em> <br>
<em>The ISO400 test.
</em> <br>
<br>
<em>The ISO800 test.</em> <br>
<em>The ISO1600 test.</em> <br>

<p><strong>Canon Powershot G10: Verdict</strong><br>
It's a worthy successor 
to what is arguably the most popular DSLR back up camera. The addition of the 
bracketing dial on the top plate will help with quicker, more varied exposures 
as well as HDR fans. The two dials sat on top of the other still amuses me but 
interestingly, I've never thought it a bad idea.</p> 
<p>There's plenty to do on the G10 and it should help you out of plenty of 
scrapes when you don't have your DSLR.</p> 
<p>The new technology is an added bonus with the DiG!C IV processor speeding 
things up while the face detection self timer will help those of you 
specialising in self portraits.</p> 
<p>It's unfortunate they've not really improved on noise performance and I 
think this could be the only thing that limits the G10.</p>

Quote: Of course the maximum the aperture can go to in 
aperture-priority is f/8 which isn't ideal for landscape shots<br>
<br>
Thats 
more than enough for a camera with a sensor this small.<br>
<br>
 I`ll continue 
using my pro 1 as backup, apart from noise levels at higher iso`s the G10 does 
not come close enough.</p> <br>

<p>I'm a traditionalist. The image looks too soft in the background for my 
tastes.</p> <br>

Quote: I'm surprised with the portrait shots. It was a bright day when 
I took them and set the white balance to the sunshine setting.<br>
<br>
the pic 
your talking about doesnt seem to have any of the sort of harsh shadows, that 
you would normally associate with bright sun? Was your subject in the shade? 
and if she was, why did you choose a daylight setting?? of course it would be 
blue.......</p> <br>

Quote: Another problem gained from such close focusing is the lack of 
light entering the lens. In this instance it has forced the camera to open the 
aperture to f/2.8 in order to expose correctly. This causes a thin focal plane 
which can be seen running along the lettering on the headphones<br>
<br>
No 
automated focus bracketing feature for stacking ?<br>
<br>
 An updated Pro 1 is 
well overdue, the feature worked very well in the original</p> <br>

<p>I really enjoyed reading your test. I'm left with one question though; when 
you wrote: &quot;It's unfortunate they've not really improved on noise 
performance &quot;, and looking at the test shots you took with the G9, it 
actually looks to me like the noise performance of the G10 is quite a bit worse 
than that of the G9. More like the ISO 400 of the G9 equals the ISO 200 of the 
G10.<br>
 To me it looks like the image quality of the G10 is therefore less 
than the image quality of the G9. Or do I misinterpret the test results? I know 
there are other factors, but this seems to be the most important one in 
compacts.</p> <br>

I agree. I took into account that the G10 has a higher 
resolution than the G9 so will naturally suffer more. If I saw a comparable 
result I would've said it had improved. because of the results shown, it looks 
like noise problems will dog this classification for some time.</p> <br>

<p>The Panasonic LX3 looks like it might steal Canon`s crown as No.1 DSLR 
backup. Looking forward to the review of that camaera</p> <i>Last Modified By

<p>Reading the review, are we to understand that again, there is no remote 
shutter release socket on the G10? Apart from the noise problems with high 
ISOs, I have trawled numerous websites home &amp; away, in search of a gizmo 
that would provide this function, with little success. The lack of this 
facility seems to have been one of the main criticisms that people have had 
with the G9 and its a pity if Canon has not picked up on this and re-installed 
the feature with the G10.</p> <br>

<p>The G10 does have a remote socket.<br>
 The Canon RS60E3 remote release is 
the compatible one, although I've just ordered a Hahnel wireless equivalent.<br>
