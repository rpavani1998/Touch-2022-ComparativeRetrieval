<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Very few actually own both brands, so comparative evaluation 
isn't usually possible, and those that do may not have comparable models.<br>

<br> There are a few that change from one brand to another (usually because of 
a perceived difference), and they may have opinions (not necessarily more than 
opinion).<br>
<br>
 In truth there is no &quot;best&quot; of virtually 
anything. To evaluate &quot;best&quot; requires a very strict and limited set 
of parameters.<br>
<br>
 Generally speaking &quot;best&quot; is what I own and 
use, and if you have the same brand then you are smart too. <br>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Kiki <br>
<br>
 You'll find that you've asked one of those 
questions for which there will never be a clear answer.<br>
<br>
 The fact is 
that the manufacturers all know exactly what it is each others cameras can do 
and because they're competing with each other, these cameras tend to end up 
being very, very similar in what they do.<br>
<br>
 So people are likely to 
tell you that their favourite is the make and model that they use. People who 
own Canons and people who own Nikons like Nikons. And then there are the people 
who have a Sony or Pentax or Olympus or Panasonic etc etc.<br>
<br>
 Like 
Russel says above, you can read lots of review sites that try and compare one 
against another. But the truth is that if you are looking to but a new camera 
the best thing you can do is, first of all decide how much you can spend (and 
remember you've got to get memory cards, batteries, a lens (if that's not part 
of the package). So, it can mount up.<br>
<br>
 The once you have decided that, 
check out all the cameras that are available in that price range. Go into a 
camera store and ask to see them and be allowed to handle them. The read about 
them online.<br>
<br>
 And then decide which 'feels right for you. And go for 
it.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Hi Kiki, <br>
<br>
 I can see why this is causing problems, due 
to the unique nature of the DSLR/similar camera systems, once people start 
investing in lens, they are very unlikely to scrap that investment and change 
to another brand.<br>
<br>
 Probably less 5% of members will have <i>personal
</i> experience of more than one DSLR brand. <br>
<br>
 I have owned Nikon 
SLRs, both back in film days and now digital, but I have also owned Canon 
rangefinder and Digi P&amp;S cameras, but I still cannot say which is 
&quot;best&quot;; it is like comparing apples and oranges.<br>
<br>
 As has 
been said somewhere else here recently, there is far,<b>far</b> more variety 
between models within one brand, than between brands.<br>
<br>
 If you start 
comparing<b>similar</b> models across brands, then what makes one model better 
than another will be different for different people; I like having a tilting 
LCD screen, but that doesn't mean cameras without that feature would be no good 
for you.<br>
<br>
 If you push, you'll get a lot more replies like Glenn's 
pragmatic view; what anyone owns must be<i>their</i> best because it is all 
they know. If you were to count votes, all you will discover which brand is 
owned by most people. I can tell you that now; Canon, followed by Nikon, 
followed by ????<br>
<br>
 Does it mean Canon are best; no, I don't believe it 
does, successful brands are more often determined by things such as effective 
marketing and support rather than the technical merit of the hardware - history 
is littered with such examples; VHS over Betamax, etc.<br>
<br>
 Bear in mind 
also that availability of both hardware and especially support, varies widely 
from country to country. What suits me in the UK may not be so valid for you in 
Canada or another member on the opposite side of our planet.<br>
<br>
 Does 
that explain the situation in a helpful way?</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Hi Kiki, <br>
<br>
 I am assuming you are just starting with 
digital photography. If this is not true then I apologise.<br>
<br>
 A nice way 
to start is to pick the same brand as someone you know. Then you can ask advice 
and, even better, borrow their equipment. If you do not know anyone with a DSLR 
then you can ask here for advice. Unfortunately you cannot borrow equipment 
here.<br>
<br>
 I would start by going to a large camera shop and looking at 
the different brands in your price range. You can then get a feel for each 
make. One may just feel better to you. As others have pointed out the 
differences are very small. What is more important is to be happy with the 
equipment you choose.<br>
<br>
 Also note that the cost does not stop at the 
camera. There are many lenses and the cost of these can soon add up. Also note 
that it is more important to get a good lens than a good camera. The lens is 
what focusses the light. No lens is perfect. However some are less perfect than 
others. You should try and get the best that you can afford. The lens will last 
much longer than a camera body.<br>
<br>
 You may also want to save some money 
for image processing software (although there is a lot of good free software 
available) and perhaps a tripod depending on what you are photographing.<br>

<br> Hope this helps. <br>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Which is best? <br>
 There is no such thing. <br>
<br>
 Which is 
best for you within your budget and at the time you actually ask the may be a 
better question.<br>
 Pick a budget and you will find one or possibly two 
cameras that are 'better' within it. Go up &pound;100 or go down &pound;100 and 
the camera and the brand will change. It is also a fluid question in that there 
are cameras coming to the market on a monthly business and it stands to reason 
that they will be 'better' that the ones they replace. My job is an interesting 
one and I love it. I have the opportunity to play with and use just about every 
camera going on a daily basis. I have experience (limited I agree in some 
cases) with every camera that exists within the members here and I have to 
answer question on them with some level of conviction every day. I would have 
to say there isn't a 'best' camera brand. I personally prefer Nikon - they 
aren't better quality, they aren't better built, they aren't more 
reliable......they aren't better anything to be honest I just prefer the 
overall design, handling and texture of their pro bodies. I always have and 
likely always will - if I won the Lotto I would, given a choice of ANYTHING, 
still raid Nikon's catalogue.<br>
<br>
 Another way of looking at it is this: 
There is no such thing as a bad camera, actually there is no such thing as a 
camera that isn't capable of fantastic photographs. Some of the best 
photographs I've seen in recent years have been taken on a phone. They're not 
the best quality but that is irrelevant - honestly it just doesn't matter what 
pixels you have, what ISO you can use, what the lens cost, how many features 
your camera has, it all boils down to how good the person behind the lens is.

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Kiki's already got a DSLR - a Nikon D3000 or 3100 I'm guessing 
from the size of the body in one of her self-portraits.<br>
<br>
 For me, I 
went down the Nikon path because I had an old lens that I wanted to try and 
re-use from a film SLR from many years ago. My wife Kerry then ended up with a 
Nikon as well so we could shoot the same lenses. However she had a Canon film 
SLR before that.<br>
<br>
 Our transition from film to digital SLRs saw us end 
up purchasing a few bridge cameras on the way - mainly a Fuji Finepix and a 
Panasonic Lumix - both capable cameras for what we were doing at the time 
(point and shoot). I think no matter brand you end up with, you become 
comfortable using it and the way it works over time so it doesn't really 
matter. It's just that investment in lenses that keeps you sticking with the 
same brand. I suspect that if all the SLRs had the same mount such that you 
could use any lens on any camera easily, you might see more people swapping 
back and forth between brands.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Having been shooting in a studio with a Phase One kit today, 
(IQ180, that costs more than your average exec car) you might say that this is 
best. If you do high end fashion, it probably is, as you will have demanding 
clients, but if you are shooting for pleasure, or in low light, it would be 
dreadful investment.<br>
<br>
 There are not many brands I have not used over 
the years, but would hesitate to push anyone into a particular brand, because 
they all have their merits.<br>
<br>
 Look at the lens choice and what you plan 
to shoot with it.<br>
<br>
 Then look at your budget. <br>
<br>
 Try a few out 
for yourself, but only have part of an ear open when you ask for 
recommendations, as most folk will tell you their x or y brand is best.<br>
<br>
 However, probably best to play safe and stick with the big two. N and C. And 
stick with what you decide otherwise swapping and buying new lenses will set 
you back a small fortune as they are rarely compatible. Four thirds cameras 
being the exception, but maybe Olympus might be a dubious choice at present 
given their precarious position.</blockquote>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> IMO, most of the differences between DSLR cameras are in the 
controls and ergonomics. Virtually any DSLR will, if matched with a good lens, 
be able to shoot excellent images.<br>
<br>
 I would say that the differences 
between cameras are greater within the various grades of cameras within a brand 
than between two equivalent grades of Nikon - Canon. I haven't documented this 
but I strongly suspect it.<br>
<br>
 Ergonomics can be major factor in whether 
a camera would be suited to you and whether you might or might not enjoy 
shooting with the camera.<br>
<br>
 I once had a camera that I detested using 
for ergonomic reasons:, the Canon XT or 350D. I did not like it for a very 
silly reason, the camera shooting mode was changed by pressing a button on the 
rear of the camera, to the right of the LCD. My problem was due to the small 
size of the camera and the large size of my hands combined with how I hold a 
camera; my right thumb automatically rested right at that button. I would often 
inadventently change the shooting mode. Whenever I pressed the shutter button 
and the self-timer would begin to cook off, I would say to myself &quot;Gosh 
(you can substitute any X-rated word you desire - I used them all at one time 
of another) I did it again!&quot;<br>
<br>
 You would think that I could break 
myself of that habit but, I could not. Since I had no problems when I shot my 
larger Canon 10D camera (which IMO had a better control system), I gave the XT 
to my son-in-law (who has no problem because his hands are smaller than mine) 
and I bought a 30D to use along with my 10D. I followed up with a 40D and shot 
for years with the 30D and 40D cameras (haaving the 10D in reserve). But, a 
while ago, I used the old 10D which was on its last legs as a trade in for a 7D 
on the Canon Loyalty program.<br>
<br>
 I just love my three Canons. I like the 
7D best, followed by the 40D and 30D in that order. However, I really don't see 
a lot of difference in image quality between the three (see my China galleries 
which were all shot using a 30D and a 40D at:http://rpcrowe.smugmug.com/ ) but, 
the 7D is a bit more capable regarding auto-focus and has several bells and 
whistles which the 30D and 40D lack. I love the control systems on all these 
cameras but, the 7D wins hands down for ease of controlling.<br>
<br>
 Probably 
the most important parameter in image quality is the lens. However, even the 
very inexpensive kit lenses will produce very good to excellent image quality, 
especially if tripod mounted and shot around f/8 or f/11. More expensive lenses 
such as the Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 and the very expensive Canon 17-55mm f/2.8 IS 
lens also produce excellent image quality and are more versatile in that they 
have a larger aperture and can produce better imagery wide open. Therefore they 
can be used in lower light levels without flash.<br>
<br>
 That said, a hotshoe 
flash such as the Canon 430EX ii or 580EX ii (I use the older 550EX and 430EX 
which work just fine) used correctly will increase the versatility of any 
camera/lens combination, both for shooting indoors and for fill-light outdoors. 
A flash and a decent tripod will go a long way in leveling the playing field 
between the least expensive kit lenses and the most expensive glass. Despite, 
some claims to the contrary, a bounced flash modified with a diffuser/reflector 
can produce very natural looking and pleasing light.</blockquote>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> To my mind there is simply no such thing as a 'best' camera. <br>

<br> There are good and bad aspects to any camera - I think the criteria should 
be what suits you best. As I and others have mentioned, the ergonomics is very 
important, as much as the number of pixels or coffee-making facilities...<br>

<br> For someone who has never handled/used a DSLR before my advice would be to 
readup on what 'features' people use most, then go and play with a few cameras, 
in a decent camera shop. The people there will be able to tell you the strong 
points, and you do the rest - does it feel right? Can you reach all the buttons 
you'll think you need? Are there (honestly) too many functions I simply won't 
use?<br>
<br>
 All these, to me, are more important than &quot;Is it in my 
price range?&quot; - but that comes next. It would be ridiculous to buy a $5000 
camera to use as a point and shoot...having said that, if you've got the cash, 
why not!!<br>

<h2> Re: Poll: Which camera brand do you find best? </h2> 
<blockquote> Well, I've started out with Olympus, then went to FujiFilm in 
earlier digital photography days. In 2006 I found only Nikon and Canon were 
developing cameras towards my needs anymore, and after pouring over the 
technology stats, optical quality of lens range, sample images etc. for several 
weeks, I eventually landed on Nikon. Not ever since that point did I regret it. 
Most of my photo jobs are concerts and portraits, and in that range of lenses 
Nikon has the best glass hands down (Canon has nothing that can touch the Nikon 
14-24mm F2.8 G ED AF-S, the 70-200mm F/2.8 VR II or (back then) the 85mm F/1.8, 
now F/1.4)<br>
<br>
 Low light performance of the sensor is my most important 
niche, and Nikon has always been hands down far and above Canon in that aspect.
<br> <br>
 When it comes to the consumer range of DSLRs, Nikon's are more

 So I can't see me using Canon any time soon. </blockquote>  Reply

 1. Look here  and see that K5 is the highest 
rated 'non-monstrous' camera of all.<br>
<br>
 2. Go to a place, where you can 
see a lot of people with cameras. Observe what they have. 49% will have Canon, 
49% will have Nikon, 2% will have Sony. NOBODY will have Pentax. You will be 
the only one! You will be different! <br>
<br>
 3. Ask Canon and/or Nikon 
camera owners - how often do they get &quot;wow, what a cool camera you 
have!&quot; from total strangers? Now, ask me (a K5 owner, as you've already 
guessed)... And I'll tell you - I get more compliments about my camera, than 
about my pictures! Well, that's probably telling more about my skill as a 
photographer than about my camera, but still...<br>
<br>

The above is NOT a solicitation to buy a Pentax, meant as a joke, AND I can 
just as easily prove that you should NOT buy Pentax, as that you should.</i>

<blockquote> Which camera brand do I find best? <br>
 The one that I have with 
me at the time I want to take a shot that will allow me to take the shot that I 
want to take.<br>
 Some people shoot camera phones and get far better pics than 
I can take.<br>
<br>
 I've heard it said many a time that cameras nowadays are 
better than they were x number of years ago. So which is best depends on your 
reference point and what you are comparing against.<br>

 Here, at least, is part

 Oh, and 87.2% of statistics quoted in the pub are
