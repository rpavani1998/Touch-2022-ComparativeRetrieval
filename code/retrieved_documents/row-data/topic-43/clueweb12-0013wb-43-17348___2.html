<h1>Nikon Colour Character</h1> by Alex Brown 9. April 2010 18:25 <br>

Classic Nikon D300 territory: soft light, cool palette</i> <br>

<p>On a recent trip to Norfolk, I forgot to take a camera battery charger and 
so after my trustyNikon D300 ran down I was forced to resort to my vintage 
(well, 2005)Nikon D50 as backup.</p> 
<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve had the D300 for over a year and still feel I&rsquo;m 
coming to terms with it. It&rsquo;s somehow a serious camera and it turns out
serious&#8209;looking images; in particular, when it comes to colour it&rsquo;s 
at its best with cooler, softer, almost pastel&#8209;like scenes &ndash; which 
it renders with a painterly subtlety. When it comes to attempting warmth, it 
seems to me to to veer off course and crash into a citrus palette. As I've
written before, it&rsquo;s possible to do something about this. Yet somehow the 
original character of the sensor seems to come through.</p> 
<p>The D50, in contrast, seems to produce punchier, vidid (and 
not&#8209;so&#8209;serious images). What you see below is straight out of the 
camera converted from RAW to JPEG usingDxO Optics Pro and DxO user 
Andy_F&rsquo;s default settings (check out the forums to find Andy&rsquo;s 
excellent work on better colour accuracy from RAW conversions). And so if 
I&rsquo;m not imagining all this, in some ways (whisper it) I might even prefer 
the look I can get from the earlier camera &hellip;</p> <br>
<br>
<i>Bam! The 
Nikon D50 delivering obvious, saturated colours</i> <br>

<h4>Quotable</h4> 
<p>Note that everyone directly involved in the development of ISO standards is 
a volunteer or funded by outside sponsors. The editors, technical experts, 
etc., get none of this money. Of course, we must also consider the considerable 
expense of maintaining offices and executive staff in Geneva. Individual 
National Bodies are also permitted to sell ISO standards and this money is used 
to fund their own national standards activities, e.g., pay for offices and 
executive staff in their capital. But none of this money seems to flow down to 
the people who makes the standards.</p>

yes, but in the early days XML's &quot;draconian&quot; error handling was a 
vaunted feature (so the implication was: w/f or die) #xmlprague <br>
