 The Nikon Coolpix S30 is designed as the ideal family camera

large buttons and waterproof and shock proof body it should survive a little 
rough treatment, as well as survive trips to the beach or swimming pool.<br>

<h2>Nikon Coolpix S30 Handling</h2> <strong><br>
 Nikon Coolpix S30 Rear<br>

<br> Handling</strong> - The Nikon Coolpix S30 differs from most other compact 
cameras, in that it has four buttons on the left of the screen - these are used 
to control most options. The zoom control is on the right, with a middle on/off 
button on the top and simple to use shutter release and video start buttons 
either side. The camera is not only shockproof and waterproof, it has some 
clever design touches such as tiny feet on the screen corners so that if the 
camera is placed on it's back, the screen should avoid scratches.<br>
<br>
 Two 
year old and a five year old children were given the camera and were able to 
take photos, with the older child being able to easily understand the three top 
buttons. They were able to take photos, as well as record videos using the 
camera.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nikon Coolpix S30 Photo Mode Nikon Coolpix S30 Menu <br>

<br> <br>
<strong>Menus</strong> -&nbsp; The menus are made up of large text, 
with options selected using the four buttons on the left hand side of the 
camera. Each button corresponds to a coloured option on the screen, starting 
with the first option: Change colours, (red), Decorate (yellow), Scene (green), 
Sounds (blue), scrolling down, the second screens options are:&nbsp;Flash mode, 
self-timer, image size, movie AF, then the final screen is Setup. Colours lets 
you change exposure compensation, saturation and hue. Decorate lets you apply 1 
of 5 borders. Scene lets you choose from 1 of 10 scene modes. Flash mode (auto 
or off). Self-timer options are 10s, or smile timer. Size lets you 
choose:&nbsp;10m, 4m or 2m. Movies 720p or VGA. Movie AF:&nbsp;Single or Full 
Time AF. Setup options include electronic VR, date stamp, as well as battery 
type.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>Battery Life
</strong> - The battery life is rated as 240 shots according to CIPA standards, 
and using 2 alkaline AA batteries we were able to take over 225 shots before 
the battery went flat. This is quite good and should mean that you can go a 
long way without running out of power, with the potential for better battery 
life with Ni-Mh rechargeable batteries or lithium batteries. Another benefit of 
AA batteries is that they are readily available worldwide.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Coolpix S30 Battery Compartment<br>
<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> - We tested 
each camera's performance at focusing, shutter response, shot-to-shot time, 
continuous shooting etc. and have posted the results below. To test this we 
took 6 or more shots and calculated the average, so that consistent results 
were produced.<br>

<strong>Continuous 4 megapixels</strong> 
<strong>.</strong> <strong>5fps (~ shots)</strong> <br>
<strong>Continuous 
Shooting (with Flash)</strong> <strong>N/A</strong> <strong>1.3s</strong> <br>

<br> <br>
 Start up screen was switched off. Focus at the wide-angle end was 
reasonable at around 0.4 seconds amd shutter response when focused was very 
quick. Focus at the telephoto end was quite slow with the camera hunting for 
focus. Shot-to-shot time was reasonable as long as you aren't using flash.<br>

<br> 
<h2>Nikon Coolpix S30 Performance</h2> Here are a number of sample photos 
taken in our studio as well as a variety of other situations. Click 
&quot;Hi-Res&quot; to view the full size original images. Additional sample 
photos and product shots can be found in ourEquipment Database, where you can 
also add your own reviews and ratings.<br>
<br>

<h2>Nikon Coolpix S30 Sample Photos</h2> 
<p>Portrait | 1/30 sec | f/4.7 | 7.9 mm | ISO 200<br>
High-Res</p> 
<p>Fountain | 1/800 sec | f/3.7 | 5.2 mm | ISO 80<br>

<p>Macro | 1/1250 sec | f/3.3 | 4.1 mm | ISO 80<br>
High-Res</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br> <strong>Sample photos</strong> - The is very little red-eye in the 
portrait flash photo, and reasonable noise performance for a compact camera, 
although detail could be better. The macro performance of the camera was better 
than expected, with the camera offering a Close-up / Macro scene mode.<br>
<br>

<h2>Nikon Coolpix S30 Lens test images</h2> 
<p>Wide | 1/500 sec | f/3.3 | 4.1 mm | ISO 80<br>
High-Res</p> 
<p>Zoom | 1/200 sec | f/5.9 | 12.3 mm | ISO 80<br>
High-Res</p> <br>

<p>Digital-zoom | 1/100 sec | f/5.9 | 49.2 mm | ISO 80<br>
High-Res</p> 
<p>Trees | 1/160 sec | f/3.3 | 4.1 mm | ISO 80<br>
High-Res</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <strong>Lens test images</strong> - The images show good colour with 
reasonable detail at both the wide and telephoto ends of the lens, although the 
wide-angle shot shows quite soft corners and purple fringing in areas of high 
contrast. Digital zoom is best avoided and as this camera is designed for use 
under water it's important to make sure the front of the lens is always clean, 
as there is no lens protection.<br>
<br>

<h2>Nikon Coolpix S30 ISO test images</h2> 
<p>1/25 sec | f/5.9 | 12.3 mm | ISO 400<br>
High-Res</p> 
<p>1 sec | f/5.9 | 12.3 mm | ISO 1600<br>
High-Res</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>ISO&nbsp;noise performance</strong> - It was more difficult than normal 
trying to test the camera's noise performance, as the camera does not let you 
select the ISO&nbsp;setting. This meant we had to alter the lighting in the 
room to force the camera to alter it's ISO&nbsp;setting. The results aren't 
especially good, with the ISO200 and ISO400 shots showing lots of noise. 
However, the shots taken outside in good light (at ISO80)&nbsp;showed fairly 
low levels of noise apart from in dark blues and in some areas of the sky.<br>

<br> 
<h2>Nikon Coolpix S30 White-balance test images</h2> 
<p>AWB Tungsten Light 1/30 sec | f/4.2 | 6.4 mm | ISO 320<br>
High-Res</p> 
<p>AWB Fluorescent Light 1/10 sec | f/4.2 | 6.4 mm | ISO 400<br>
High-Res</p> 
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>White Balance Performance</strong> - Similarly the 
camera lacks any white balance settings, so instead we simply changed the light 
source and left the camera on it's automatic settings. The camera performed 
quite well under tungsten lighting, and better under fluorescent lighting.<br>

<br>

High-Res</p> <br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<strong>Digital filters</strong> - There aren't a huge number of 
effects available when shooting (highlight colours, soft pictures and diorama), 
however there are a number of frames available, as well as further playback 
editing options as shown above. A panoramic mode is not included.<br>
<br>

<strong>Video</strong> - 720p, options single AF, or full time AF. Recording 
video appears to drain the alkaline batteries quite quickly, with the camera 
reporting empty batteries if video recording is attempted with low battery 
life. Optical zoom isn't available while recording, but can be set before 
recording.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Value For Money</h3> The Nikon Coolpix S30 is the cheapest waterproof 
camera available with optical zoom, with the closest competitor being the
Olympus Tough TG-320, available for around &pound;20 more. You'll also need to 
buy a memory card and a case or bag to keep your camera safe and protected - 
have a look atour complete guide to camera bags. <br>

<h2>Nikon Coolpix S30 Verdict</h2> The Nikon Coolpix S30 is a waterproof 
camera that is easy to use and designed to survive being dropped and generally 
treated in a less than ideal way. This makes it ideal for families or those 
with small children, especially as it's design makes it very easy to use. The 
camera is good value for money and while it does not feature many controls, it 
should keep the point and shoot user happy with bright colourful photos that 
will be good for web use or prints up to A4. Flash performance is good and the 
camera has a very good macro mode making it worth looking at, particularly if 
you want to be able to lend your camera to your kids without having to worry 
about it.<br>
