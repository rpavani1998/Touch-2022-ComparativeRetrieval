<b>Posts:</b> 255  I will soon 
be upgrading my hybrid Nikon Coolpix P100 camera to a DSLR (and lens tha gives 
me at least 400mm). Two cameras are the best for me (features and price). They 
are:<br>
<br>
Canon EOS 60d (and the 400mm f5.6 canon lens) <br>
Nikon D3200 
(and the nikon 80-400mm lens)<br>
<br>
Which camera do you think is better (The 
Nindon D3200 should be available by May)? <br>

Ridge  Liron, there are guys on this forum that are much more qualified to 
answer that question than me. You can analyze thousands of pages of reviews and 
the internet is full of &quot;advice&quot; on which one will be the 
&quot;ultimate&quot;. All I can say is, choosing between the two is 99% 
personal taste and about 1% about their real performance.<br>
<br>
About the 
only thing I can say for sure is that it makes sense to stick with the system 
you choose originally. I have a few bodies and lenses, and everything is 
interchangeable. <br>

Location:</b> Downtown Vancouver, BC  Liron, you are choosing between a nearly 
2 year old camera and just announced camera. The just announced camera will 
have the very latest technology available. Nikon is doing some amazing things 
with their DSLR sensors as of late. As the D3200 is their latest (a little 
better than entry level) it will by no means be a slouch. It is very new and 
hasn't yet been tested for performance but word is that it will have similar 
performance to the D5100/D7000 class which is according to DXO having much 
better image quality, dynamic range, bit color depth among other things than 
the EOS 60D. The D3200 has the same Expeed 3 processor as the D4/D800, so will 
be very quick at processing the large amounts of info coming from that 24.2 MP 
sensor. Not to say the Canon is a slouch (it's not, it's just an older camera). 
Under normal circumstances both cameras will do fine for the average person. 
The DXO ratings just become more evident when getting into the finer details 
like pixel peeping, photo enlargements, color reproduction, etc. The other 
thing is the video features of the D3200 will most likely be better than the 
EOS 60D. The EOS 60D doesn't auto focus during movie capture from what I have 
heard. The EOS 60D on the plus side will shoot faster FPS, have longer battery 
life, a faster shutter speed (1/8000 compared to 1/4000) among other things 
(the average person will prob not need more than 1/4000 though).<br>
<br>
My 
advise though, is to do a lot of research before you make your decision. You 
will have a month or so before the D3200 is available which should give you 
enough time to decide. Just remember, what ever camera you decide on will be 
your camera for the next few years or so until you upgrade again (if u do). 
Make the right decision.<br>

<b>Location:</b> Vancouver  This 
is a common photographer's problem. You want to maximize your (photographic) 
Utility subject to certain constraints.<br>
<br>
Your Utility depends upon YOUR 
preferences. No one should apply their personal Utility to recommend a certain 
choice someone else.<br>
<br>
Your constraints are also personal. Most of us 
have financial constraints, for example, but the dollar amount is likely 
different for each person.<br>
<br>
Another constraint lies with legacy 
equipment. Although couplers are available to use lenses from one manufacturer 
on cameras from another manufacturer, I am leery of such devices. Department Of 
Unforeseen Consequences.<br>
<br>
I had a friend who was a very successful 
sports photographer (Official Photographer for the IOC, that sort of success). 
He was a lifelong Nikon user and had a complete set of Nikon super telephoto 
lenses. Very large investment.<br>
<br>
He decided he wanted to switch to Canon 
(this was a few years ago) and convinced Canon to switch him out for free. He 
handed over his Nikon gear and Canon gave him the equivalent Canon gear for 
free. Without such a trade, he would not have switched, even though at that 
time he was a millionaire.<br>
<br>
So legacy equipment is a strong limiting 
factor when making such decisions.<br>
<br>
That being said, I suspect that if 
I were starting over again, I would probably go with Sony. Right now, Nikon is 
stronger than all others, but I suspect that in the long run, Sony will win 
out. That is, one of my preferences would be to suffer a little now, but gain 
in the long run (a guess).<br>
<br>
As one person I encountered in the field 
recently said to me, &quot;Canon is lost. They don't know where to go.&quot; 
There is some truth in that. Canon seems to be developing on a top-down basis, 
rather than bottom-up. For example, their flagship DSLR, the EOS-1Ds was 
recently discontinued, being replaced by the EOS-1D X. Canon was charging 
around $7000 for the discontinued model, but its features now longer justified 
such a price. It seems that what Canon is doing is to move more into video 
features where they can charge a lot - like $15000 for a recent model. That is, 
they are offering features to justify high prices, not to satisfy existing or 
potential customers. (Top-down instead of Bottom-up.)<br>
<br>
Canon's new 
super telephotos are expected to offer superb performance, but again at Super 
Prices. One of the basic tenets of microeconomics is that if you lower the 
price, the demand rises. I don't think that Canon has the right price for 
profit maximization. Generally if demand rises, you manufacture more and 
manufacturing costs per unit decline (fixed costs are recovered over a greater 
number of units plus gains from economies of scale).<br>
<br>
I am new to 
Birding and am also retired from the workforce. I find this to be a nice hobby 
that gets me outdoors, gives me exercise and engages the brain in devising 
&quot;hunting&quot; strategies. There is a rising population of recent retirees 
and I've heard long-time Birders comment (complain) about the number of new 
Birders out and around with cameras.<br>
<br>
If Canon and other companies did 
a smart market analysis on their customers and potential customers, they might 
adjust their marketing approach to accommodate this new market driven by recent 
retirees who are engaged in a hobby where light super telephoto lenses are VERY 
nice to have.<br>
<br>
However.... <br>
<br>
If I had no constraints and given 
MY set of preferences, I would choose the Nikon from your set of choices. You 
have to understand your own preferences (Utility) and constraints and make your 
own decision. <br>

<b>Location:</b> Maple Ridge  You 
may also want to wait for the D400 or whatever the D300S replacement will be 
called. The D300S has been the unofficial &quot;benchmark&quot; Nikon bird 
camera for a while now, so the D400 should be of interest to many bird 
photographers. It will be at a higher price point though.<br>
<br>
Another 
thing you have to keep in mind is that bodies come and go, and in the end 
you'll spend a bigger portion of your budget on a lens/lenses than on bodies.

<b>Posts:</b> 74 Hi this is a good 
debate.. I ran into this when I first started birding seriously and I finally 
went with the Canon 7d and as I was on a tight budget I went with the 150mm - 
500mm Sigma I am happy with this but will say I have found a few soft spots 
with this lens so I will be getting a canon 100mm-400mm as that will fit into 
my budget. Like everything else everything is a personal choice and for me this 
is what works... <br>
