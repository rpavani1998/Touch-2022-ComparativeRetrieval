<h2>2. Nikon Coolpix S1000pj</h2> 
<p><strong>Two camera giants, two point-and-shoots over $300. Will the 
projector-equipped S1000pj prevail, or will the &quot;standard&quot; features 
on the S90 win out?</strong></p> 
<h5> The Projector<br>
</h5> 
<p></p> 
<p>The video projector built into the S1000pj, not surprisingly, is fairly 
limited. The definition is limited to VGA and the brightness tops out at 10 
lumens. Living-room projectors produce over 1,000 lumens!<br>
<br>
 That means 
the room you&rsquo;ll be doing your projecting in has to be really dark. Once 
you&rsquo;ve darkened the room, any plain white surface will do as a screen. 
You just press a button, adjust the focus, and browse at will, either using the 
buttons on the camera or the remote control.<br>
<br>
 You can move from one 
picture to another, zoom and move around within a picture, and play video files 
&ndash; though the sound quality from the built-in speaker is very limited. In 
short, it has everything you need to show your shots and movies to your 
friends. As far as the projector goes, despite the inevitable technical 
limitations, the camera delivers what it promises.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>At a time when all &ndash; or almost all &ndash; compacts have a 5x optical 
zoom, a 12 MP sensor, a 2.7-inch or 3-inch display screen, and similar size and 
cost, it&rsquo;s getting hard to set yourself apart from the pack. Nikon is 
taking a long shot &ndash; a digital camera with a built-in video projector. 
It&rsquo;s an original solution that makes the Coolpix S1000pj unique among the 
hundred or so cameras released in 2009.<br>
<br>
<strong>Handling</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>With its Picasso-style nose in the middle of its face and second eye above, 
the Nikon S1000pj is instantly recognizable. We&rsquo;ll let you decide how 
elegant-looking you think it is, but just about everyone on the team here found 
it extremely ugly.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The metal body looks sturdy, but the build quality isn&rsquo;t perfect. The 
fit of the battery compartment lid, for example, isn&rsquo;t great &ndash; on 
our test model, it tended to stay closed even when unlatched.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>At the rear is a 2.7-inch 230,000 dpi LCD screen, with a highly visible 
weave and pronounced clouding in shadows. Even worse, since it&rsquo;s a TN 
panel-based display, so everything becomes dark &ndash; and thus useless 
&ndash; when taking a downward-angled shot. For the rest, the S1000pj is laid 
out like other Coolpix models. Operation is simple and the interface is clear, 
if not elegant. The new controls related to the inclusion of the projector (see 
inset) are located on the upper part of the body.<br>
<br>
 The remote control 
that comes with the camera works in projector mode, of course, but also in 
snapshot mode. So you can use it to control the S1000pj (including the zoom) 
remotely, which may be an interesting feature for tripod users. However, 
it&rsquo;s very plastic-looking construction and mediocre surface finish are 
disappointing.<br>
<br>
<strong>Response</strong><br>
<br>
 T he 
S1000pj&rsquo;s responsiveness inspires no particular comment. Start-up is a 
little quicker than average, and focusing is neither slow nor fast. The delay 
between shots is a little long (2.5 seconds), and the burst mode is really 
quite disappointing. It&rsquo;s slow &ndash; barely over one frame per second 
&ndash; and it hangs after the fifth frame.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Image quality</strong><br>
<br>
 We&rsquo;ll cut to the chase: If 
the S1000pj has a weakness, this is it. The lens really lacks evenness, 
especially at wide-angle, with a fairly good centre but edges that are 
particularly fuzzy. Purple fringing is very visible at high contrast, even on 
medium-sized prints. In telephoto, the contrast is never good, even in the 
center, and the purple fringing is no fainter.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For sensor sensitivity, Nikon isn&rsquo;t among the best. Purplish zones in 
darker areas, a chronic weakness of this little 12 MP, already appear at 400 
ISO, along with the first evidence of smoothing intended to contain digital 
noise. From 800 ISO, details are diluted. We&rsquo;ll be charitable and not 
even mention the higher values.<br>
<br>
<strong>Video</strong><br>
<br>
 Video 
is not a strong point either. The 640x480 non-HD definition is unexciting, the 
recorded sound is mediocre, and the optical zoom doesn&rsquo;t work during 
recording and the image shows clouding in the shadows. The video performance is 
no worse than with a lot of compacts, true; but some do much better.</p> 
<p></p> Nikon Coolpix S1000pj<br>
<br>
Pros Cons<br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li>Original concept &ndash;video projector</li> 
<li>Clear interface and menus</li> 
<li>Comes with remote control</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Disappointing image quality; lacks sharpness and sensitivity</li> 
<li>Video is low-definition; no optical zoom in video mode</li> 
<li>Looks a little clunky; build quality could be better</li> 
<li>Poor display resolution, narrow viewing angles</li> 
<li>Lens lacks brightness (maximum f/3.9!)</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p>With the S1000pj, Nikon is trying out a new concept: &ldquo;Your personal 
theater on the go&rdquo; &ndash; a camera that lets you show your photos and 
video to your friends. Unfortunately, this doesn't overshadow the fact that the 
camera is just plain mediocre.</p> <br>

<p>Why is it that on every article the 'More on this topic' link never works 
and fails to load? Had the same trouble with the Nokia N900 article and others 
too.</p> RAMEON01  12/27/2009 11:59 PM <br>

<p>Please note that the distortion correction sidebar is incorrect. When 
shooting raw files with the S90, Adobe's Lightroom 2.6 and the Photoshop Camera 
Raw plug-in 5.6 will provide geometric distortion correction results to raw 
files similar to the native JPEG files and raw files processed by Canon DPP.<br>

<p>Ya pretty stupid article, the Nikon PJ is a new concept and for the tech to 
make projection there is ALOT of compromise to still be compact, they are 
comparing apples and oranges here...</p> omnimodis78  12/29/2009 5:16 AM <br>

<p>I read the full review, but one thing wasn't explained: why put these 2 
cameras head to head? The Nikon is a new-concept camera, and so it really 
shouldn't be put side by side with a rather orthodox canon model. Sort of 
devalues the objectivity of this site, and the validity of its author.</p>

<p>Wow, this article is really pathetic. Just stay out of camera comparisons 
if this is the quality to expect. Leave it up to dpreview and similar sites 
that are dedicated to that hardware.</p> Anonymous  01/06/2010 1:58 AM <br>

<p>Agree with Kaiser_25 and Omnimodis79, the comparison is not appropriate. 
Canon S90 should be compared to Panasonic LX3.</p>
