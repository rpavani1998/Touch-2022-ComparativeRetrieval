<p>Panasonic LX5 vs Canon S95 vs Nikon P300 - Three of the latest and most 
compact serious cameras from Panasonic, Nikon and Canon put to the test by

<strong>
</strong> <br>
<br>
 The introduction of the new Nikon Coolpix P300 is the 
latest compact camera designed to offer manual controls and improved image 
quality, yet does it have the image quality to knock the Canon and Panasonic 
aside? We decided to compare three of the most compact serious cameras to find 
out how they perform, and what they offer that makes them worth parting with 
your cold hard cash for.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Features</h2> You'd be forgiven if you got confused looking at the 
cameras, as they, in appearance at least, all appear to offer roughly similar 
features, with a wide angle optical zoom lens, a bright lens, 3 inch screens, 
and pop up flash. However, it's when you start delving deeper into the camera's 
specifications that you realise you are looking at three quite different 
cameras.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>The Nikon Coolpix P300</strong> 
features a normal sized 12 megapixel back lit CMOS sensor that you would find 
in many other compact cameras (such as theNikon Coolpix S9100), an f/1.8 - 4.9 
wide angle lens starting at 24mm equivalent, and a high resolution 3 inch 
screen with 920k pixels. Where the Nikon difference comes, is in the high speed 
8fps shooting and full HD video recording.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>The 
Canon Powershot S95</strong> is the most compact and features a larger than 
normal 10 megapixel CCD sensor, an f/2.0 - 4.9 wide angle lens starting at 28mm 
equivalent, and again a high resolution 3 inch screen. The Canon offers a 
clever dial around the lens, RAW support and customisable buttons.&nbsp;<br>

<br> <strong></strong> <br>
<strong>The Panasonic Lumix LX5</strong> is the 
largest of the three, as can be seen most clearly when viewed from the top, but 
is also the most advanced, offering a uniquely shaped 10 megapixel CCD sensor 
that supports multiple aspect ratios, a flash hot shoe, an SLR style command 
wheel, large hand grip, and a bright lens at both wide angle and telephoto, 
that starts at 24mm equivalent.<br>
<br>
 We have broken down the main features 
into an easy to read table, showing the best highlighted in green.<br>
<br>

<br>
 * Our own testing found the Nikon Coolpix 
P300 offered better battery life than this in use, while the Panasonic Lumix 
LX5 battery life was more often around 280 shots. The Canon Powershot S95 
provided around 200 shots in real use, which matches the CIPA rating.<br>
<br>

<br> 
<h2>Handling</h2> Hopefully the specifications and features of each camera has 
given you an idea of what each of these cameras offers, but it all becomes 
quite mute if the cameras are unable to offer the speed and image quality to 
back it up.<br>
<br>
 We tested each camera's performance at focusing, shutter 
response, shot to shot time, continuous shooting etc, and have posted the 
results below. To test this we took 6 or more shots and calculated the average, 
so that consistent results were produced, we also made sure to test all the 
cameras at the same time to ensure the cameras were being tested under the same 
conditions.<br>

<strong>
Continuous Shooting (at full resolution)</strong> <strong>8fps (7shots)</strong>
2.5fps (3 shots) 2fps (~) <br>
<br>
<br>
 Each camera excels at something, most 
noticeably the P300 with the fastest start up time, and fastest continuous 
shooting (by a long shot). The LX5 is to be commended for excellent focusing 
speed, and general all round quick performance, whilst not as quick as the 
P300, the 2.5fps continuous shooting is still adequate, and the rest of the 
performance figures are good. The S95 is not necessarily slow, however, in this 
competition it is noticeable that it scores as the slowest camera of the three, 
apart from shutter response which seemed the quickest (just).&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br> 
<h2>Performance</h2> Here we've tested each camera in the real world, and in 
studio tests, taking photos with each camera, at the same time under the same 
lighting conditions so that you can directly compare them. Click images to very 
larger versions.<br>

 Here the Nikon has produced the warmest most vibrant 
colours, followed by the Panasonic Lumix LX5, which has produced the most life 
like colours, while the Canon has produced slightly cooler colours. The LX5 has 
the most detail with excellent detail in both bright and shadow areas, with the 
S95 giving slightly softer results, and less detail in the shadow areas. The 
P300 offered the softest results, with the stronger contrast causing detail to 
be lost in the shadow areas of images.&nbsp;<br>

<strong>Portrait shots

<br>
 The S95 flash seemed to overexpose the image 
slightly, this was made worse by the screen on the back showing the image as 
brighter than it actually was, and the shot also shows the worst red-eye of the 
three cameras. The P300 produced the warmest colours, with lots of red-eye. 
Switching to the portrait scene mode produces softer skin, and removes red-eye 
from the subject (an example is shown in the full review). The LX5 gave the 
most detail, with the lowest red-eye of the three.<br>

<br>
<br>
 The 
P300 results are better than expected considering the smaller sensor size when 
compared at 100% view and the camera produces good results even at ISO3200, 
although noise is visible, the levels are low and detail is still good. The LX5 
does well at ISO3200 although the processing of the noise appears more visible. 
The S95 shows the softest results in these tests, as though the noise reduction 
settings are set too high. It's worth noting that the ISO range of the P300 is 
the lowest, ranging from ISO160 to ISO3200, the S95 goes from ISO80 - 3200, 
while the LX5 goes from ISO80 upto ISO3200 at full resolution, with ISO6400, 
and ISO12800 available at 3mp. You can view the full range of test shots in the 
full reviews.&nbsp;<br>

 The LX5 
gives the most accurate and neutral results under incandescent lighting using 
the auto white balance. The P300 follows on from that, producing warm, rich 
colours, while the S95 produces the warmest colours of all with a yellow shift 
to the image.<br>
<br>

<h3>Auto White Balance Performance - Fluorescent Lighting</h3> <br>

The S95 produces excellent results under fluorescent lighting, followed by the 
LX5's slightly cooler results. The P300 produces an image that has a slightly 
yellow tone to it, however colour is very good.<br>

the others.&nbsp;<br>

 The P300 and S95 zoomed in has very 
similar telephoto reach, with the S95 zooming the furthest to an equivalent of 
105mm. The LX5 zooms the least, to 90mm equivalent. Detail is very good on the 
P300 shot, although it is possible to see sharpening artefacts. Detail on the 
Canon Powershot S95 shots are very good.<br>

<br>
 The LX5 allows you to photograph 
your subject when it is just 1cm in front of the lens, producing excellent 
results. This is followed by the P300 with a close focusing distance of 3cm and 
excellent detail, with the S95 faring the worst in this test, only allowing you 
to focus on subjects 5cm away from the lens.&nbsp;<br>
<strong><br>
</strong> 
<strong><br>
<br>
</strong> <strong>Video Performance</strong>: The LX5 has the 
most control over video, but also offers only monochrome sound, while the S95 
and P300 both feature stereo sound. The P300 offers the highest resolution 
video at full HD, and also offers high speed video recording. The P300 and LX5 
both feature dedicated video record buttons and let you use the optical zoom 
while recording, while the S95 only has digital zoom while recording.<br>
<br>

<br> &nbsp; <br>
<strong>Value for money:</strong> The Nikon Coolpix P300 is 
the cheapest, from &pound;249, while theCanon Powershot S95, is around 
&pound;299, and thePanasonic Lumix LX5&nbsp;is the most expensive of the 
three,&nbsp;at around &pound;349. The other cameras in this category are 
generally much larger, and include the newOlympus XZ-1&nbsp;(&pound;399), with 
the best lens, theSamsung EX1&nbsp;(&pound;275) with swivel screen, and the two 
largest, with optical viewfinders, theNikon Coolpix P7000 (&pound;325), and

<strong>The Nikon Coolpix P300 packs almost every feature

<br>

<strong>Nikon Coolpix P300 winner at...</strong> <br>
 High speed shooting and 
video... very good image quality with bright saturated images, also 
the&nbsp;second smallest camera, but importantly offers hand grip at the front 
and back (unlike the S95), and offers the lowest&nbsp;price. Unfortunately the 
camera lacks RAW support, which could put some people off this camera, as you 
will have to trust the JPEG results straight from the camera.<strong><br>

 Canon Powershot S95 
winner at...<br>
</strong>The Canon Powershot S95 wins the competition for 
smallest camera with manual controls, and has a clever lens surround that 
quickly lets you set your most favourite settings, along with the scroll dial 
on the back of the camera, and another customisable shortcut button on the 
back. Unfortunately that size comes at a price, and the most noticeable 
downsides to the S95's size is the lowest battery life, rated at 200 shots, 
&nbsp;the camera's slippery when held, and the lack of optical zoom while 
recording videos. If Canon could improve on these downsides with the next model 
(S100?), and perhaps add a flash hot-shoe, then Canon would be onto a winner.

<br> <strong>The Panasonic Lumix LX5 is a serious compact with excellent image 
quality and is a brilliant choice for the serious photographer.</strong> <br>

<br> Panasonic Lumix LX5 winner at...<br>
</strong>The Panasonic Lumix LX5 is 
an excellent example of how to get a digital camera right, and really sets the 
benchmark when it comes to the serious compact camera. It offers excellent 
image quality thanks to the brilliant&nbsp;24mm Leica f/2.0 lens, larger than 
standard CCD sensor, and reliable image processing which can be seen in the 
superb auto white balance&nbsp;performance, and noise results.<br>
<br>
 The 
camera gives great&nbsp;expansion potential thanks to the flash hot-shoe, and 
rear accessory port. Further to this is features a well laid out menu system 
with an abundance of options, including numerous video options, and comes with 
a leather neck strap. The&nbsp;build quality is exceptional.<br>
<br>
<strong>

<br>

<h2><strong>Nikon P300 vs Canon S95 vs Panasonic LX5 Verdict<br>
</strong></h2>
 The three cameras provide a wide range of features, and go to show that the 
digital camera market is alive and well, with interesting, innovative, and 
competitive products, with each model differencing itself enough to make each 
camera worthy of your attention depending on your needs.<br>
<br>
 All of the 
cameras are capable of producing excellent images, especially when compared to 
standard point and shoot cameras, however the strengths and weaknesses are what 
sets these cameras apart. With two of them the strengths are most obvious, with 
another, the weaknesses are the most apparent. How the strengths and weaknesses 
apply to you depends on what you want from a camera, and if you want the 
smallest camera of the three, then the most obvious choice is the Canon 
Powershot S95.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The Panasonic LX5 is the most flexible and 
advanced with support for hot-shoe, and produces the highest quality images. 
While the Nikon Coolpix P300 is the fastest shooting with a backlit CMOS sensor 
and 8fps shooting, and also offers the highest resolution video.&nbsp;The Canon 
is the smallest with full manual support, including RAW, but unfortunately 
suffers from the lowest battery life, least grip-able body, and doesn't allow 
the use of optical zoom in videos, however, if you need the smallest camera 
with manual controls it's worth a look.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
 Overall the 
<strong>Panasonic Lumix LX5</strong> delivers excellent image quality, 
excellent build quality, excellent lens, rapid performance, and expansion 
options, making it an exceptional choice for any serious photographer, and is 
therefore my &quot;<strong>Editor's Choice</strong>&quot; and deserves high 
praise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The <strong>Nikon Coolpix P300</strong> with smaller 
sensor produces good results, better than some expected thanks to the backlit 
CMOS sensor, and extremely rapid performance in the form of 8fps shooting, high 
speed video and full HD video recording, and is therefore<strong>Highly 
Recommended</strong>&nbsp;(and a close second). <br>

<p>This is a good review, and it's nce to see manufacturers looking at other 
matters as well as pixel count. To address the point about the Canon's 
handling, there is a guy in the USA called Richard Franiec who makes an add-on 
grip for the S95 (and it's predecessor, the S90, which I have) which works 
really well and improves the handling a lot. It does mean extra cost though.</p>

<p>Excellent review. Thank you. All in all I will buy an Olympus XZ-1, 
although the LX5 runs it mighty close. I have not worked without an external 
flash for 40 years, and I already have an Olympus FL-36R, so the prices match, 
and the Olympus work I have seen has inspired me more than the work folk have 
posted from the Panasonic. It would be mighty difficult to separate LX5 from 
XZ-1 without that comparison. Comments from people who have not had both 
cameras for long enough to present a body of work are unreliable in this 
extremely finely balanced case.<br>
<br>
 To get a feel for these advanced 
compacts I borrowed a Canon S90, and I am surprised that a quick-reaction firm 
like Canon has not addressed certain shortcomings of the S90, like not having a 
hot-shoe, when designing the S95. It could have been a contender.</p> <br>

<p>What is monochrome sound? Is that the opposite of color sound?<br>

<p>Really nice review. It's nice to see how good all 3 cameras are. All your 
comparisons definitely show the 3 cameras are better at different things and 
that one camera is not completely perfect.<br>
 I knew the LX5 was probably 
slightly the best of the bunch based on image quality and features.<br>
<br>
 
As an owner of the S95, I got around the &quot;lack of optical zoom while 
recording videos,&quot; by using the custom firmware CHDK hack allowing optical 
zooming and manual focus. It also allows a few more tweaks like choosing super 
fine JPEG images. Also camera menu allows custom color settings for increasing 
sharpness and saturation giving a little better image quality.<br>
<br>
 But 
all 3 cameras are winners and I wouldn't mind owning any of them.</p> <i>Last

<p>A very balanced and useful review with pertinent information and examples. 
I have the older Canon S90 (and the older Lumix LX3) and found the content 
valuable in making my decision to skip this particular generation of newer 
models and wait for the next.<br>
<br>
 Thank you for an excellent summary of 
the cameras!</p> <br>

<p>Isn't it obvious, that Nikon P300 image quality is crap compared to the 
other two, or is it just me ?<br>
 May be this is just jpeg compression 
artifacts ?<br>
 I really wanted this camera, but I could not find a single 
sample image with a decent quality.<br>
<br>
<br>
 This is a very good review! 
Thanks a lot!</p> <br>

<p>Hi Albert<br>
<br>
 No pics from the Nikon P300 are most definitely not 
crap! I have brought this camera and the results are superb. I wanted the 
combination of 24mm fast aperture (1.8 at wide) lens combined with full manual 
controls and pocketable. Only this camera currently gives this as the LX5 is 
much larger and the Canon S95 only goes to 28mm. I own Sony a700 &amp; a55 
DSLRs and previously owned the Canon S90, so a lot to live up to in the image 
quality stakes. The sensor is smaller than both the LX5 or S95 so I was nervous 
about making this purchase but Nikon have worked wonders with the backlit 
sensor and low light results are amazing.<br>
 I suppose as with many compacts 
there may be some artifacts magnified very closely but this would be like 
trying to make 6ft x 4ft posters from it, in other words in the real world the 
images look superb. Check out some of those posted on the P300 Flickr forum.<br>
<br> An added bonus is the 1080p video is great quality too. <br>
<br>
 A great 
little camera!</p> <i>Last Modified By andy100 at 17 May 2011 - 7:44 PM</i> <br>

<p>A very helpful review as I was trying to decide between the S95 and the LX5.
<br> Regarding the grip problem on the Canon S90 and S95, Camera Leathers in 
the USA have cut panels in a very thin self-adhesive material to cover the S90 
and are working on the same for the S95. These panels are black and textured to 
give a better grip. I have bought pre-cut leathers from this company to cover 
my old film cameras and they are excellent to deal with. The panels for the S90 
cost $12.95 plus postage, so not excessive.</p> <br>

<p>First of all, unless I am mistaken I didn't see anything mentioned about 
Image Stabilizer which the Canon has. This greatly improves it's low-light 
capabilities.<br>
<br>
 Also, I don't understand the fuss about the grip of the 
Canon S95. I have owned the S90 for years and never was this an issue for me. I 
guess my fingers have superb grip.<br>
<br>
 The reviewer also mentioned the 
low battery life as an issue. Unless something has drastically changed from the 
S90, I don't see this as an issue at all. I've taken the S90 all over the world 
and have never had a problem with the battery. You just recharge it before a 
big day out. No problem.<br>
<br>
 Finally, the hotshoe issue? WTF is that? The 
fact that it doesn't have a hotshoe makes it a winner. It's more compact and 
easier to put in your pocket. I don't know why you would need an extra flash 
for this camera and I really hope Canon doesn't put one on the S100.<br>
<br>
 
In other words, there aren't really any negatives about the S95.</p> <i>Last
