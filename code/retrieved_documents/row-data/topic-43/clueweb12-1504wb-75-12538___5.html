<p>Not only he is a pro <strong>digiscoping</strong> enthusiast but also an
<strong> avid DSLR photographer.</strong> this interview is a great resource 
for those stuck wether to<strong>buy digiscoping</strong> gear for those long 
shots or stick with<strong> DSLR cameras</strong> for <strong>wildlife</strong> 
and<strong> outdoor photography</strong>. you can visit Richard's artwork at

<p><em>1- We believe that your area of specialty is digiscoping. Your artworks 
are mostly related to wildlife photography, macro and specially birds. Now what 
scope do you use? Do you use different scopes for different scenarios? If true 
then what models and brands works for you? How about eyepieces? How often do 
you change eyepieces for different cases?</em></p> 
<p>Many scopes are available and work well for digiscoping my personal choice 
is a Swarovski ST 80HD the high definition glass in this and other scopes is 
likely to produce the best result with digiscoping. Other scopes from 
Swarovski, Leica, Zeiss and other manufactures will give good results. Mine is 
on older Swarovski model but still highly regarded amongst digiscopers. The new 
Swarovski eyepieces can be used with this older scope, I own and use the new 
30x WD (wide angle) Swarovski eyepiece, but often stay faithful to the 20-60x 
eyepiece which is very good.</p> 
<p>It also gives flexibility for framing as you can zoom in and out using the 
eyepiece as well as the camera, though I rarely use it above 20x as the more 
magnification you use the more light you need or to put it another way the 
lower you shutter speed will need to be for the correct exposure. You need more 
light with the 30x so staying at 20x will give you better shutter speeds for 
freezing movement.</p> 
<p><em>2- Do you use digital camera for digiscoping or 35mm or both? What 
models? Are you planning for an upgrade? Please give us your reasons why you've 
chosen this equipment and not other brands that come close to yours.</em></p> 
<p>There is a large range now of digital point and shoot style cameras that 
are suitable for digiscoping I have used several models mostly Canon and the 
Nikon Coolpix range, currently I have a Canon Powershott A95 which for me is 
the benchmark for all other digiscoping cameras. Vignetting (dark corners to 
the image caused by the eyepiece, a sort of keyhole effect) disappears with the 
20-60x eyepiece after just a few clicks on the camera zoom. Its easier to use 
than many others and has a very useful flip out screen and a built in 
magnifier. Above all the images are sharp when focused correctly and at ISO50 
(another feature not available on many other cameras) there is very little 
noise. Its also available used for around &pound;100 now.</p> 
<p><em>I also own a Nikon Coolpix P5000, which has some nice features over the 
A95 such as 10 million pixels, a nice big clear screen and vibration reduction 
(VR) built in.</em> There is something I don't like about the representation of 
colour in this camera and other Nikon P&amp;S (point and shot) cameras. I 
always seem to prefer images out of a Canon camera. Having said that this 
camera has everything most people would want from a digiscoping camera.</p> 
<p>I always have my eyes open for the next suitable camera available but at 
the moment there is nothing that has tempted me to change either of the two 
mentioned.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>ST80HD scope using tube style adapter<br>

<p><em>3- What adapters do you use with your digiscope set? If you are using 
multiple scopes and digital cameras can you give us the purpose of each and 
which one works best in what condition for you? Are you planning for an 
upgrade? If you use multiple scopes/cameras on the field can you explain why 
you chose one over another in different cases?</em></p> 
<p>I use a tube style adapter that is made for the eyepiece and has three 
plastic screws to lock it in place. I only use one screw since then it can be 
easily removed to use the scope for viewing. Many variations on the theme are 
available now from companies that specialize in this sort of equipment. I have 
a couple of step rings that change the thread size from 28mm to 37mm or 52mm 
this way I can fit it to most digital cameras that have a filter thread.</p> 
<p><em>4- What is your favorite tripod? Do you use a monopod as well? If yes 
then let us know in what condition you prefer monopod over tripod? Do you use 
alternative heads for your pods? If true please let us know why and your brand 
of choice?</em></p> <strong>All of my supports are made by Manfrotto, i use the 
fairly basic and freely available 128rc head on a standard tripod similar to 
the Manfrotto 190v for digiscoping. I also use a sliding plate made by 
Swarovski to fit on Manfrotto heads.</strong> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This sites the scope further forward on the head counterbalancing the wait 
of a camera on the back end and helps to stop the whole setup being off 
balance, it also has a shallow grove that the scope sits in and stops it 
twisting around on the tripod, which suits my style of carrying the whole setup 
around on my shoulder. A monopod but be no good for digiscoping as the 
magnification involved is to high for this style of support the setup always 
needs to be kept rock steady, this is essentially when digiscoping. I use a 
monopod for DSLR telephoto photography and find it invaluable. I have also used 
a Manfrotto car clamp for digiscoping from my car with some success. In this 
way it's possible to use the car as I hide and get even closer to your subject.

<p><em>5- If there was no limit on your budget then what sort of digiscoping 
equipment you would buy? Please name the whole equipment and brands.</em></p> 
<p>Luckily I have come to I point where I have exactly what I want from a 
digiscoping setup. I have no plans to change my scope, but am always on the 
lookout for cameras that may have something else to offer. Unfortunately the 
perfect digiscoping camera doesn't exist as there aren't any specifically 
designed for the purpose. I honestly think the Canon Powershott A95 is the best 
digiscoping camera I have use. I produces sharp images to the point that if 
used correctly you can see detail in the feather barbs of the birds you are 
photographing.</p>

<p><em>6- What is the most difficult situation in digiscoping of birds and 
wildlife? And how do you over come it? Is there any book you might want to 
suggest to beginners and pros alike in this field?</em></p> 
<p>As with any photography the main factors we battle against are weather 
conditions. White birds like Egrets and Gulls are very difficult to expose for 
correctly on a sunny day in harsh sunlight, getting detail rather than blown 
out white areas of reflection with no detail is difficult. A dull windy day 
makes it very difficult to get enough light for a fast shutter speed and if the 
setup is moving around in the wind digiscoping is next to impossible. Its 
always best to keep everything low down to avoid shake especially in the wind, 
crouch down and use the tripod without the legs extended, or use the old trick 
of hanging you kit bag (or anything with a bit of weight to it) from the tripod 
to keep it rooted to the ground.</p> 
<p>To my knowledge there is yet to be a book published on digiscoping, but 
there are plenty of websites with useful information and forums with friendly 
likeminded memberswww.birdforum.net  is probably the best.</p> 
<p><em>7- What metering you use most of the time for digiscoping small birds? 
What about other wildlife scenes? Do you change your metering often or you stay 
loyal to one metering mode?</em></p> <strong>For digiscoping i generally use 
the aperture priority mode, and keep the F-number as low as possible typically 
below F5.6. Depth of field (DOF) is minimal with digiscoping, which makes 
focusing crucial, and the high magnifications involved mean that freezing the 
movement of both of the bird and setup in very important. I keep the F-number 
low and leave the camera to give the highest shutter speed available. There are 
rarely situations where I feel I need to use any other method.</strong> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>8- What is your best offer for a beginner if he wants to gather his/her 
first set of digiscoping equipment for birds? Please name the whole set. What 
if he is on a tight budget? And what if he is not on a tight budget? Please 
advice for both conditions.</em></p> 
<p>On a low budget, the Canon A95 is available at around &pound;100 used; an 
adapter and mechanical cable release could be another &pound;100. Look at he 
Kowa and Opticron range of scopes, there are second hand models around very 
cheap perhaps just a few hundred pounds, and they produce good results. A basic 
Manfrotto tripod and head will coast about &pound;200 but can be picked up 
second hand and other cheaper makes will do the job, a sturdy tripod is very 
important though, there is not point spending large sums on equipment if you 
are going to put it on a cheap wobbly tripod.</p> 
<p>If money is no object I would still go for Canon A95 but you could look at 
other well respected and more expensive digiscoping cameras like the Nikon 
Coolpix 8400 and the nwere P5000 which I have already mentioned. The top end 
Swarovski, Leica and Zeiss scopes with high definition glass, are around the 
&pound;1000 mark and will all do a good job, which you use is probably a matter 
of personal preference. Look at and try before you buy, if you can, ask other 
digiscopers/birders you see what they are using, and if you can have a look 
through there scopes, most are happy to help. For a tripod look for something 
sturdy but also bear in mind that these setups can be heavy especially if 
carried around for long periods, some new tripods are light and made of carbon 
fiber, which may just save you some back pain.</p> 
<p><em>9- What type of accessories are a must to have on the field when you 
are out for digiscoping? What are those items that one should bring with her in 
order to take quality photos and not to miss a scene?</em></p> <strong>The 
essentials are Scope, Camera, Adapter and cable release, if you are serious 
about digiscoping there is really no point in using a camera hand held to the 
eyepiece.</strong> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Electronic cable releases are available for some models, I have always got 
on fine with an old mechanical cable release that simple depresses the button 
and is mounted on a bracket. There is also less to go wrong. Various other 
accessories are available for digiscopers, such as monitor shades and 
magnifiers, and locating sights. Shades and magnifier held you to see the 
screen and are useful on sunny days and help accurately focus. Personally I 
have never felt the need for a locating site as I prefer to rely on my hand eye 
coordination. However sometime birds are very difficult to find in bunches or 
on the sea where there are no markers.</p>

<p><em>10- How often do you use post processing? What software you use and how 
they help you to improve your artwork?</em></p> 
<p>Photoshop is brilliant and may well come with your camera, the elements 
version has most of what you need. It is often necessary to tweak digiscoped 
images a little, brightening them up and using a little sharpening is normal.
</p> 
<p><em>11- There are many digital cameras that are suitable for digiscoping 
but don't have raw output. JPGs don't let you to adjust your photos like it was 
in capture time, how do you deal with that?</em></p> 
<p>I have only used one camera for digiscoping that would capture raw files, 
the Nikon Coolpix 8400 and it was painfully slow at writing them to the card. 
This feature would be nice in a digiscoping camera and is available on only a 
few cameras that are digiscoping friendly. Its often useful to take quick burst 
of JPG images however, rather than one every 2-3 seconds if you are lucky, 
which was the experience I had with the Nikon 8400. I was missing to many shots 
and reverted to JPG. Other P&amp;S cameras may now be faster at writing Raw 
files, I certainly hope so. Of course digiscoping is possible with a DSLR and 
these cameras certainly will capture and write RAW files very quickly.</p> 
<p><em>12- Can you give us the major techniques that one should use with the 
digiscope's digital camera set on the field to able to produce robust images 
like yours? Those that if one lacks, it'll be hardly possible to produce 
quality photos.</em></p> <strong>To reduce camera shake three things are a 
must, in many cases the cause of blurred images when digiscoping is the result 
of camera shake rather than poor focusing. You must use an adapter to firmly 
connect the camera to the scope, you must use a cable release to reduce 
movement and you must use a sturdy tripod.</strong> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Have look at different tripod heads too if you can, because you will often 
find that you need three hands. One to focus the scope one to hold the handle 
of the tripod head and follow the bird of compose the shot and another to press 
the button. I often found that I could hold the shutter release like a trigger 
under my thumb and move the scope around with the same hand, while focusing the 
scope with the other, only possible because of the arrangement of the setup. 
The chances are you will get used to yours and find a way to do something 
similar. Practice is the key, get out there and take pictures loads of picture. 
At first you may find only one in hundred are any good. Pretty soon it will be 
one in ten and so on.</p>

<p><em>13- What do you think has made your photos superb, your proficiency, 
your talent, or your equipment? Or a combination of all? We believe you are a 
professional in what you do, let us know more about you. How long you've been 
in to this, what are your favorite books and photographers and what camera you 
started with at the very beginning.</em></p> 
<p>Practice, its as simple as that, I have spent many, many hours in the field 
looking for subjects, playing with setting and photographing anything that 
gives you the chance to get close enough to it. I am not a professional but do 
sell images quite regularly for various uses and publication. I have been 
interested in nature all my life and photography for much of it. I have plenty 
of pictures of trees and water with specs you can just about make out as birds 
from my film SLR days. I got into Digiscoping 7 years ago and DSLR photography 
quickly afterwards. Certain good equipment helps but excellent pictures can 
come from the cheapest of cameras, photography is much more about technique and 
patience both with yourself and your subjects. You won't just wake up one 
morning with the skills you require it takes time. If you're anything like me 
you will enjoy the challenge.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>DIGISCOPED WITH CANON A95</em></p> 
<p><em>Digiscoping can by used for general wildlife photography as well as 
birds. I have used a digiscoping setup to photograph many animals from mammals 
like Deer and Hare to insects like dragonflies</em></p> 
<p>Copyright &copy; Richard Ford - www.Digitalwildlife.co.uk</p> 
<p>My first digital camera was a Nikon Coolpix 4500 for digiscoping, though I 
had played around with a borrowed digital camera (I honestly can't remember 
what it was) for some time before that. |For digiscoping the first time a saw 
images from Andy Bright these were the ones that inspired me to explore this 
area of bird photography, I don't think he does a lot of digiscoping now, these 
days he is an excellent DSLR photographer. One of the best bird photographers 
of today to my mind is Nigel Blake his owl photography is just stunning and 
involves time, skill and a knowledge of your subject that he has perfected. For 
general wildlife photographers how could you not think of Andy Rouse, just do 
and Internet search or buy any of his books I have found his case studies 
particularly useful.</p> 
<p><em>14. Do you use both DSLR and digiscoping on the field? How about using 
a DSLR camera with a digiscoping?</em></p> <strong>I do use both DSLR and 
digiscoping for bird and wildlife photography though rarely together, there is 
only so much kit I can carry around at one time.</strong> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Digiscoping with a DSLR is possible though my experience is that you need 
far more light than with the usual P&amp;S style cameras, this can be overcome 
to an extent by using higher ISO settings and noise levels at higher ISO's are 
getting lower with every new camera. Results can be good but for me it took a 
lot more effort than with the usual methods and cameras. For now at least I 
will be sticking with my P&amp;S style cameras for digiscoping. There are some 
interesting developments happening in this area though with high magnification 
digiscoped flight shots becoming achievable.</p>

<p><em>15. In Which situations you would use which set-up for wildlife and 
bird photography; digiscoping or DSLR?</em></p> <strong>Digiscoping is a high 
power form of photography, which I think is best used in a casual manner.
</strong> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I would take out the digiscoping setup and walk around a nature reserve 
taking advantage of whatever subjects are available, you don't need to get as 
close so you don't need to worry so much about field craft and being 
conspicuous to your subjects. You can often get close enough for a good image 
and still be at a distance where they are comfortable to continue feeding 
singing or whatever. I think DSLR photography takes more planning. I may set up 
a hide or attempt to go for a specific picture or subject.<br>
 I have taken a 
lot of Macro images over the last couple of years, some thing that many of the 
digiscoping cameras can manage quite well, the Coolpix 4500 if a well-respected 
camera in this respect. But a DSLR and a good macro lens can transport you into 
a new world you'll discover on your hands and knees.</p> 
<p><em>16. They say digiscoping is a weak practice when flight photography and 
avian subjects comes into account, how do you overcome this issue and what are 
your suggestions?</em></p> 
<p>Digiscoping birds in flight with the digiscoping gear I have is near 
impossible, there are a few chances of course like a hovering kestrel which may 
stay still long enough for a shot, and those that are experimenting with DSLR 
digiscoping are managing flight shot as well. Really however this is the domain 
of the DSLR and a telephoto lens. Flight photography is not something I have 
done a lot of, but is a challenge I am looking forward to getting my teeth 
into. That's what I love about this hobby, there is always a new avenue to 
explore, and always something to photograph, be it in your garden at a local 
nature reserve or abroad.</p>
