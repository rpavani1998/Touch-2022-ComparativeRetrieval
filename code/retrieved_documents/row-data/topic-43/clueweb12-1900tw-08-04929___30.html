<h1>Nikon 50mm AF-S vs AF-D</h1>  Jan  15  2010  January 15, 2010  By Nasim 
Mansurov 188 Comments <br>

<p>This article is a comparison between the new Nikon 50mm f/1.4G AF-S lens 
versus the olderNikon 50mm f/1.4D AF-D.</p> <br>

<p>First of all, I want to start out by saying that the Nikon 50mm f/1.4 is my 
favorite low-light and portrait lens. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4D lens was one of my 
first lenses that I bought and I have been using it more than any other lens, 
even today. I was very excited when the newNikon 50mm f/1.4G came out, because 
I loved the older version and couldn&rsquo;t imagine how good the new one would 
be with all of the new enhancements that Nikon has been adding to their line of 
lenses. So, as soon as the update came out, I pre-ordered one from B&amp;H and 
started using it more than the older version for my everyday photography needs. 
I use it for all indoors/low-light photography and especially to photograph my 
two boys.</p>

<p><br>
</p> 
<h3>1) Key differences</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Autofocus Speed, Internal Focus Motor: Just like the AF-D version, the new 
Nikon 50mm f/1.4G has no internal focus motor, which is why the autofocus speed 
on both lenses is slow. I was expecting the new &ldquo;AF-S&rdquo; version to 
be faster, but unfortunately, it is actually<strong>slower</strong> than the 
older lens. When both lenses cannot acquire focus, the time it takes for the 
new Nikon 50mm f/1.4G to go from infinity to 0.45m (on the distance scale) and 
back to infinity is about twice longer compared to the older &ldquo;D&rdquo; 
version. When I tested both cameras to focus from infinity to a nearby object, 
it was very clear that the newer lens acquires focus slower than the older 
version. But it is an extreme case and you are probably not going to see many 
situations where you have to go from infinity to close distance. For 
photographing my kids indoors that move non-stop, the new AF-S version focused 
almost as fast as the old one and I did not see any focus problems with it. In 
addition, the new 50mm f/1.4G is &ldquo;AF-S&rdquo;, which means Autofocus with 
a Silent Wave Motor, the autofocus will function on all entry-level cameras 
such as Nikon D40/D60/D3000 and D5000 that have no autofocus motor in the 
camera body (the older Nikon 50mm f/1.4D or Nikon 50mm f/1.8D will not 
autofocus on these cameras). With the Silent Wave Motor, the new Nikon 50mm 
f/1.4G is also much quieter than the older version.</li> 
<li>Optics and Sharpness: Optically, the new 50mm AF-S lens has more elements 
&ndash; 8 elements in 7 groups, compared to 7 elements in 6 groups in the older 
lens. While Nikon did not use any of the new &ldquo;N&rdquo; (nano-coated) 
glass in the new lens, sharpness-wise, the new 50mm f/1.4G is slightly<strong>
sharper</strong> than the older version, especially wide open (see samples 
below).</li> 
<li>Aperture Ring: The new Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is a &ldquo;G&rdquo; lens, and 
therefore, has noaperture ring (the old one does). Not a concern if you are 
shooting digital, but you cannot use it with the older manual focus film 
cameras.</li> 
<li>Bokeh (Background Blur): The older f/1.4D lens has 7 straight blades in 
its diaphragm, which results in aheptagon-shaped bokeh. The new 50mm f/1.4G 
lens has 9 rounded blades, producing a much more pleasant round-shapedbokeh. 
When shooting at maximum aperture, there is a visible amount of 
&ldquo;outlining&rdquo; in the bokeh (also present on the older 50mm lens), 
which is a visible line around the bokeh circle. But if you stop the lens down 
to f/2.0 or higher, this outlining effect pretty much disappears, making the 
bokeh look much smoother.</li> 
<li>Manual Focus Operation: One of the annoyances of the older Nikon 50mm 
f/1.4D, was the fact that you could not manually focus the lens while it was 
set for autofocus &ndash; you had to change the camera to &ldquo;Manual&rdquo; 
focus. With the new 50mm &ldquo;G&rdquo;, this problem is eliminated &ndash; 
you can either set the lens to &ldquo;M/A&rdquo; mode, which means 
&ldquo;Autofocus with Manual Override&rdquo; or &ldquo;M&rdquo; mode, which is 
fully manual. This is nice, because I now do not have to remember to change a 
camera switch in order to manually focus in extreme conditions.</li> 
<li>Filter size: The filter size on the f/1.4G version is 58mm, while the 
older f/1.4D&rsquo;s filter size is 52mm.</li> 
<li>Lens front Rotation and use with Filters: While the 58mm is not a standard 
filter size for 50mm lenses, the good news is that the lens thread on the new 
Nikon 50mm AF-S does not rotate when the camera autofocuses. In the older AF-D 
version, the lens barrel would change depending on the distance between the 
camera and the subject. I personally found this a little annoying on the older 
lens, because dust particles would occasionally get in between. Because of 
this, you will find that keeping the new 50mm lens clean is easier than the old 
one.</li> 
<li>Handling and weight: Both lenses are very lightweight (new 290g, old 260g) 
and are both great to handle. The only key difference worth noting is that the 
new 50mm AF-S lens has a larger barrel compared to the old 50mm lens.</li> 
<li>Vignetting/Light falloff: There is moderate vignetting visible at maximum 
aperture (f/1.4) on both lenses, which is practically eliminated when stopped 
down to f/2.0.</li> 
<li>Lens hood and Flare: The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G now comes with a lens hood! 
This is great, because the older version did not, and you had to buy it 
separately. When it comes to flare, I found that it is quite controllable on 
both lenses.</li> 
<li>Distortion: The new 50mm AF-S has a little more distortion than the older 
AF-D version. It is not heavily noticeable though and can be fixed in 
post-production, if it becomes an issue. Again, this is not a lens for 
architectural photography, so the distortion does not bother me at all.</li> 
</ol> 
<h3>2) Lens sharpness test at maximum aperture</h3> 
<p>The new Nikon 50mm f/1.4G AF-S is definitely a little sharper wide open 
than its predecessor. As can be seen from the below screenshots, the difference 
is certainly visible at maximum aperture. At f/2.8 and above, the lenses 
perform equally well, although the new 50mm tends to have slightly better 
corner sharpness all the way to f/5.6.</p> 
<p>Nikon 50mm f1.4D AF-D @ f1.4</p> 
<p>Nikon 50mm f1.4G AF-S @ f1.4</p> 
<h3>3) Final verdict and recommendations</h3> 
<p>So, is the new Nikon 50mm f/1.4G worth the upgrade? Absolutely! Although 
the focus speed is slightly slower when compared to theolder 50mm AF-D lens, 
there are many more benefits to the new 50mm lens, including increased 
sharpness and better bokeh. Those two reasons alone are worth the difference in 
pricing between the old 50mm and the new one. I personally shoot the 50mm 
lenses at near maximum aperture to get a shallow depth of field, so the 
improved performance at wide apertures is very important for me.</p>

<p>The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G AF-S is also my wife&rsquo;s most favorite lens that 
she uses for all of herfood photography. She loves the fact that the lens is 
very compact, light and yet produces stunningly beautiful images. She heavily 
uses this lens for wedding and other event photography as well.</p>

<p>Thank you for this article. I just got the lower end model the 1.4D 
recently and had a choice to get the 1.4S but was not sure if I should 
&ldquo;pay up&rdquo; the difference. I was thinking for my needs I don&rsquo;t 
need to (only for my blog) but reading this, I wish I had! Maybe next time! 
Anyway, great site &ndash; will be back more often!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Trissa, thank you for your feedback! Do not worry about the difference 
&ndash; 50mm f/1.4D is still a beautiful lens. It gave me so many great 
pictures and I still use it quite a bit on our D300 body.</p>

<p>You didn&rsquo;t miss out on anything. The G line means that they removed a 
feature, the aperature ring. They did this so it can&rsquo;t be used on a 
manual focus camera. Just because they put a new model out doesn&rsquo;t mean 
it&rsquo;s an improvement. And this lens actually has less distortion than the 
supposed upgrade. You did the right thing.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hey Nasim,</p> 
<p>What do you think of the 50mm 1.8D for food photography? The reason I ask 
is that there seems to be rather large price differential between the 1.4 and 
1.8</p> Reply <br>

) Nasim Mansurov February 17, 2010 at 6:55 pm <br>

<p>Asha, the 50mm f/1.8D lens will work great for food photography, as long as 
your camera has an autofocus motor. If you have a basic camera like the Nikon 
D40/D40x/D3000/D5000/D60, you will need to get an AF-S lens such as Nikon 35mm 
f/1.8G.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Harmanizan, the image quality truly depends more on the quality of light, 
rather than the type of lens you are using. We have recently experimented with 
the Nikon 35mm f/1.8 DX lens and we loved it so much that my wife now wants one 
for her food photography.</p>

<p>Harmanizan, I would take a serious look at the Nikon D5000 with the Nikon 
35mm f/1.8G DX lens as a combo for your first DSLR purchase. The 35mm lens is 
very inexpensive and delivers superb image quality on a DX body.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Nasim, i bought it already on yesterday&hellip; Yehuuuu&hellip; ;)<br>
 
guess what? Not D5000 but D90..<br>
 Heehe..<br>
 maybe i cannot sleep for one 
whole week.. ;)<br>
 First choice is D5000 but the salesman promote me to get 
D90.<br>
 Based on what u have writing before, its better to spend little bit 
more money<br>
 then invest on D90 right?</p> 
<p>Oh ya, can u suggest me any articles or website that show a 
expressway/summary to use D90? The manual is too complicated to stand.</p> Reply

<p>Harmanizan, congratulations with your purchase! The Nikon D90 is a superb 
camera and I love it more than my Nikon D300 :)</p> 
<p>It is definitely a good thing that you got the Nikon D90 over D5000 &ndash; 
you got yourself a semi-professional serious camera with great features. I love 
the fact that there is an LCD screen on top of the camera&hellip;don&rsquo;t 
know what I would do without it :)</p> 
<p>So do not regret it&hellip;you have made the right choice and the Nikon D90 
will serve you well for a long time!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Harmanizan, the 18-105mm lens is a good general lens for wide-angle and 
medium telephoto work. It is not the best lens in the world, but is good enough 
for most photography needs.</p> 
<p>I would recommend a fast aperture lens as your second lens. Either the 
excellentNikon 35mm f/1.8 or the superb Nikon 50mm f/1.4. The 35mm would 
probably work best on the D90, because the 50mm might seem a little too 
long&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>Great article! I currently have a 50mm 1.8D. I can&rsquo;t honestly say 
that the performance of either 1.4 is enough to make my trade up considering 
the price difference. However, if/when a time comes that I need to replace it 
I&rsquo;ll go for the 1.4S after reading your review!</p> 
<p>On thing though&hellip;my 1.8D allows me to manual focus when the camera is 
set to autofocus. The 1.4D really doesn&rsquo;t?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Sort of an off topic question. My &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; of lenses 
includes&hellip;</p> 
<p>- Nikkor 14-24mm 2.8<br>
 - Nikkor 24-70mm 2.8<br>
 - Nikkor 70-200.. 2.8 
VRII</p> 
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been using my 50mm 1.8 a LOT. It&rsquo;s got me thinking 
that I may not really need the 24-70mm. I can &ldquo;sneaker zoom&rdquo; the 
50mm for the same range. My only concerns are color and contrast. I&rsquo;ve 
heard the the 24-70mm is better with both. If the 50mm 1.4G is on par with the 
24-70mm in those areas then I&rsquo;ll get it and put the rest of the money I 
would have spent on the 70-200mm instead. What are your thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Hello Nasim,</p> 
<p>I just discovered your blog and I have to say, you have a passion for 
photography. The framing, sharpness and saturation in your photos are stunning. 
I have bookmarked your site for future articles.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I have a question I think you might be able to help with. I have a 
D70 with 18-70 f/3.5-4.5 lens. I also have the 50mm 1.8, 85mm 1.8, and a Sigma 
70-300 f/4-5.6 APO DG Macro. I am going to upgrade to the new D90 soon, but am 
not sure about the &lsquo;Kit&rsquo; lens (18-105). Do you have any experience 
with the Nikon 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 VRII? I thought about the Nikon 18-200 VRII, 
but from all the reviews I read (and samples I saw), I don&rsquo;t think it is 
as good. The only other lens I am looking at is Tamron 17-50 f2.8 VC. I 
don&rsquo;t want to spend $$ for the Nikon 17-55 2.8. I take mostly indoor 
photographs of kids and gatherings (with and w/o a dedicated flash).</p> 
<p>On a separate note: I do not use my non-VR 18-70 lens that often 
now-a-days. My 50mm and 85mm prime lenses produce much better pictures (even my 
Sigma zoom does). I hope the VR or VC does make a difference. May be the newer 
CMOS sensor in the D90 creates better images. However, do you think that the 
16-85 (with a 35mm f/1.8 down the road) or the Tamron 17-50 (w/constant 2.8 
aperture and a VC) would be a better choice? Thanks.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Mahmood, thanks for stopping by and dropping a comment! I&rsquo;m glad you 
liked our pictures and our website :)</p> 
<p>As far as the lens, I personally wouldn&rsquo;t buy the kit lens or the 
16-85mm and would go for the 35mm f/1.8 instead&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>Nasim, thanks for your fast reply. I am seriously considering Nikon 35mm 
f/1.8 as part of my gear in the near future. I have found the 85mm f/1.8 to be 
an excellent portrait lens (better than the 50mm f/1.8) and coupled with the 
35mm f/1.8, it would provide me the capabilities of indoor low-light snapshots 
and group pictures (thus eliminating the need for a dedicated 50mm prime). 
Having said that, I still need to decide on an all around zoom lens for 
convenience and flexibility. That&rsquo;s why I am trying to decide on the 
following:</p> 
<p># Nikon 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 VRII<br>
 # Tamron 17-50 f2.8 VC<br>
 # Nikon 
18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 VRI<br>
 # Tamron 17-50 f2.8 (non VC)<br>
 # Nikon 18-55mm 
f/3.5-5.6 VRI<br>
 # Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 VRII</p> 
<p>My obvious choice are the first two. The 18-200mm VRII is a very popular 
lens for obvious reasons, but if changing lenses is not a hinderance, there are 
other cost effective options (e.g., 18-55 and 55-200) that give better end 
results. Remember, I came to this conclusion not because I own any of these 
lenses, but because I&rsquo;ve read hundreds of reviews, opinions, and articles 
on them. Please tell me if I am wrong. So my question is, do I gain anything 
significant by opting for the Nikon 16-85 or the Tamron, or I&rsquo;ll be just 
fine with the 18-105 kit lens? Thanks again from Raleigh, NC.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Mahmood, considering that Nikon is giving away $300 on the Nikon D90 and 
18-200mm VR II lens combo, I would suggest getting the 18-200mm VR II (it is a 
great value). None of the other lenses you listed above currently have 
rebates&hellip;</p> 
<p>If you need the 18-200mm range, do not bother with getting two separate 
lenses. While you might get a slightly better performance with the two lenses 
separately, having to constantly change lenses is inconvenient and will add 
more dust to your sensor.</p> 
<p>The rebates end this weekend, so I would hurry up if I were you. Here is 
the link for the rebates page with all current deals.</p> 
<p>With the $300 rebate, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother looking at the 18-105.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Thanks for the review! I was also looking at Ken Rockwell&rsquo;s page on 
these lenses, but I still can&rsquo;t decide between the two.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m currently shooting from a Nikon D90 and I&rsquo;m getting into 
concert photography.<br>
 The 50mm f/1.4 really stood out to me because of 
it&rsquo;s large aperture and ability to take sharp pictures, but I&rsquo;m 
torn as to whether I should get the older AF-D or the new f/1.4g AF-S. Could I 
get your opinion on this? I&rsquo;m a fairly amateur photographer and I&rsquo;m 
not too well versed in these things yet.</p>

<p>I think you have a mistake on your article, the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G AF-S has 
an internal focus motor, it has a silent wave motor, which allows it to AF with 
cameras like Nikon D40/D60 D3000/D5000.</p> 
<p>If you want a fast AF, I would go for the Sigma 50mm F1.4.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Shalom, what camera body do you have, and what is the reason for wanting to 
purchase the 50mm or 35mm lens?</p> 
<p>If you have a DX camera and you are looking for a normal lens to be used in 
low-light environments, then theNikon 35mm f/1.8G is excellent. If you need a 
true portrait lens, however, theNikon 50mm f/1.4G would be a better choice.</p>

<p>Hi Nasim,<br>
 Reading so many comments and articles online actually made 
me more confused :).<br>
 I have a D60 right now and I wanted to get a D90 in 
the near future sometime. I wanted to buy a 50mm portrait type of lens right 
now though. I was also hoping to use it more versatile if possible (maybe also 
do some macro shots?)</p> 
<p>I know D60s don&rsquo;t have AutoFocus in the camera body so the lenses 
have to have them. D90 however does have it in the body. So what lens should I 
get which will allow me to take photos with my D60 until I have the funds to 
buy a D90? (will a lens AF conflict with a body&rsquo;s AF?)</p> 
<p>I was confused between this article&rsquo;s 50mm f/1.4G, 50mm f/1.4D, 50mm 
f/1.8G?, 35mm f/1.8.<br>
 I&rsquo;m still just learning but wanted to take it 
further. I currently just have the kit lens (18-55mm and the 80-200 zoom lens).
</p> 
<p>Can you clarify and help? I don&rsquo;t need a long answer, maybe you can 
point me somewhere? Thanks!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Farid, don&rsquo;t buy the Nikon 50mm f/1.8D, because it will NOT autofocus 
on your D3000. You certainly do not want to be manually focusing a portrait 
lens, especially if you are a beginner.</p> 
<p>For a little more in price, you can also get the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G lens,

<p>Mujahid, it would be tough to get 100% accurate focus at maximum apertures 
due to shallow depth of field. What I would do, is try to shoot at f/2.8 and 
above and watch your focus through viewfinder while rotating the focus ring on 
the lens. Don&rsquo;t forget to set your lens focus switch to &ldquo;M&rdquo;.
</p> 
<p>It is tough, but you can certainly get pretty good with manual focusing if 
you practice enough. Definitely review your images after each shot to see what 
you need to work on.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Siju, where did you see in reviews that the 50mm f/1.4D is sharper than 
50mm f/1.4G? It should be the other way around. The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is newer 
and certainly sharper than the 50mm f/1.4D, especially when shooting at maximum 
aperture. And bokeh certainly looks better on the newer &ldquo;G&rdquo; lens, 
because the older &ldquo;D&rdquo; lens has a 7 blade diaphragm which produces 
heptagon-shaped bokeh.</p> 
<p>If I were you, I would certainly go for the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G.</p> Reply

<p>Hi Siju,</p> 
<p>I struggled a lot deciding what walk-around lens to buy to go with my new 
D90 body when I upgraded from D70+18-70 combo. I considered the Nikon 18-105 
VRI, Nikon 16-85 VRII, Nikon 18-200 VRII, Sigma 17-70 2.8-4 OS, and Tamron 
17-50 2.8 VC. The Nikon 18-70 is an excellent lens, but the lack of VR or high 
aperture was making me use it less and less than my prime lenses, especially 
indoors. I finally decided on the 16-85 VRII and I am happy I did.</p> 
<p>The 18-200 is an excellent lens for someone who wants the convenience of a 
larger zoom range with VRII, doesn&rsquo;t want to change lenses and risk dust 
on the sensor. In my experience, the sensor will collect dust eventually after 
years of use anyway, and a advanced amateur photographer has to have the tools 
and know-how to clean the dust by his own. Besides, IMHO, a single lens cannot 
give you the picture quality of a combination of primes+zooms. I didn&rsquo;t 
want to invest on a non-Nikon lens for my primary walk-around, so the decision 
was between the 18-105 and 16-85. Here are the reasons why I went with the 
16-85: 2 ED and 3 ASP, compared to 1 ED and 1 ASP in 18-105, much better build 
quality, metal mount, rubber dust gasket seal (it is important), VRII, sharper 
(particularly in the corners &ndash; very important for me), distance scale, 
less distortion &amp; the extra 2mm. The 18-105 produces excellent image 
quality according to most reviews and for a casual shooter, that should be 
enough given the price difference.</p> 
<p>The 16-85 is a superb lens for landscape, travel, outdoor photography, and 
group photos with good light. The VRII helps a lot with low shutter speeds. 
However, it is not good enough for low-light indoor photos (neither are the 
18-200 or 18-105 lenses). So, one has to change lenses and go with a faster 
lens. I have the 50mm 1.8 and 85mm 1.8. I will probably buy the Nikon 35mm 1.5 
as Nasim mentioned or the Tamron 17-50 2.8 VC if I can spend some more (and 
sell the 50mm 1.8).</p> 
<p>I agree that it is a little overpriced given that it doesn&rsquo;t have 
high aperture on the long end, so I didn&rsquo;t buy it new. I bought it used 
for a reasonable price and fortunately it is working good for me. Hope this 
helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Zoran, that&rsquo;s because you probably have it set to 
&ldquo;Single&rdquo; mode and your autofocus is set to only shoot when your 
subject is in 100% focus. You can either change your shooting mode to 
&ldquo;Continous&rdquo; focus or &ldquo;AF-C&rdquo; or change your autofocus 
settings so that it lets you fire even when there is no focus on the subject.

<p>Trev, yes, the 50mm f/1.4s lens is a very old version of the 50mm from some 
early productions. See moreinfo here.</p> 
<p>I would not buy the s version &ndash; get the 1.4D instead, which will 
definitely work on most modern bodies with built-in autofocus.</p>

<p>Hi Nasim,</p> 
<p>Can you explain futher please what you mean about 50mm f/1.4 G thats more 
longer on D90?<br>
 So in your opinion what would you prefer on D90 50mm f/1.4G 
or 35mm f/1.8G ?<br>
 Thanks again&hellip;.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Jeff, the 50mm f/1.4G is &ldquo;longer&rdquo; than the 35mm f/1.8G on a D90 
due to the 1.5x crop factor associated with Nikon DX cameras that are NOT full 
frame (D90 is a DX camera). When you do the maths i.e., 1.5 times the focal 
length, your effective view using the 50mm will be 75mm which is 
&lsquo;longer&rsquo; than the 52.5mm that you effectively see using the 35mm 
f/1.8G. For this reason, I bought the 35mm f/1.8G. At only $200, its arguably 
the best price/pic quality value lens on the market today. I use it for about 
80% of my shooting (as my walking around lens) except for the 20% times I need 
longer reach where I use the 55-200mm. I hope that helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Jeff, sorry for a late response, been super busy lately :(</p> 
<p>Just like Obi stated below, 50mm might feel a little too long because of 
the crop factor on the sensor, which makes it a 75mm equivalent lens. What this 
means, is that you will see only a certain portion of the scene, but not the 
whole thing, sort of like if you were looking through binoculars (except not 
that long). The Nikon 50mm is great for portraits, but might be too long for 
everything else&hellip;</p> 
<p>If you find yourself taking pictures of portraits more than everything 
else, go for the 50mm. Otherwise, go for the 35mm or shorter focal length 
lenses.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I just got the D90 with the 18-105 a week ago and yesterday ordered the 
50mm/f1.8D (only $125). Here are the reasons I chose this one as my first prime 
lens:</p> 
<p>1. Since i spent more money getting the D90, i can leverage the internal 
camera motor to choose a cheaper lens<br>
 2. I looked thru my 18-105 set at 
35mm and 50mm, and 50mm did feel a little long but i could actually take nice 
indoor close-ups without having to get too close to the people (got more 
natural poses)<br>
 3. The price for 50mm/f1.4g or d was too high. 
couldn&rsquo;t decide whether the 1.8 to 1.4 upgrade was worth so much. is the 
f aperture a linear or exponential scale?<br>
 4. I read somewhere that Nikon 
may stop making the 50mm/f1.8D lens since it a money loser for them, so i 
wanted to get it while i can</p> 
<p>Now awaiting the lens. Hopefully, i wouldn&rsquo;t want to upgrade too soon 
to yet another lens. does the 35mm come in f1.4G, haven;t seen that anywhere.

answer to just by researching on the internet but haven&rsquo;t so far.</p> 
<p>My new 50mm/f1.8D will have an aperture ring on the lens. Can the camera 
override the manual aperture setting on the lens ring? e.g. what if I am 
indoors and have set the lens ring at f1.8 and then go outdoors where I only 
need say f11, do I have to remember to do this on the lens aperture ring or can 
the camera manage it in the Auto mode?</p>

<p>I had a quick question for you. I love the article by the way! I have a 
Nikon D200 and have the 50mm AF-D lens right now. I do mostly portraits. I have 
just started my business. I&rsquo;m having trouble in low light situations 
getting the sharpness that I want. Would the AF-S 50mm lens work well with the 
D200? Will I notice enough difference in the pictures to make it worth the 
money? Also one more question if you are familiar with the D200, what focus 
zone do you use the most for portraits. I found it to be a bit confusing on 
deciding which one to use for what. I mainly do families and children. Thank 
you for your help!<br>

<p>Randi, if you already have the AF-D version of the 50mm, there is no need 
to buy the AF-S version. You probably need to learn how to focus well with it. 
Focusing in low-light situations is tough and I would suggest using the AF 
assist lamp on your camera in &ldquo;S&rdquo; (single) mode to help you get 
better focus.</p> 
<p>In terms of focus zone, I use single area focus in most cases, unless I 
have a moving subject (in which case I would switch to dynamic area AF).</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Mr Nasim,<br>
 First of all, your site is truly magnificent for a newbie 
photographer like me. I chanced upon your site by accident while searching for 
infos on 50mm F/1.4G.<br>
 I need your advice. I&rsquo;m currently using a 
Nikon d5000 with the kit lens, 18-55mm. I want to take better portraiture 
pictures and after doing some research many suggested i get either a 50mm 
f/1.4G AF-s or the 85mm f/3.5G. Honestly, I think both are out of my budget.<br>
 If you could, can you advice me which compatible lens is suitable for 
portraiture and less expensive than the 2 I mentioned?and is it really 
necessary for me to get a lens with a AF-s if I just want to use it to take 
portraits? -TIA-</p> Reply <br>

<p>Yeow, shooting the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G @ f/1.4 can yield soft results due to 
a) shallow depth of field and b) improper focus. I personally rarely shoot it 
at f/1.4 and would suggest to shoot at f/2.0-f/4.0. If you need better bokeh, 
just stand closer to the subject. Shooting wide open on the AF-D model will 
also have soft corners and plenty of vignetting.</p> Reply <br>

 I am a very big fan of yours.<br>
 I am using d3x and many 
good lenses.I just sold my 24-70mm f2.8 and bougt 24mm 1.4 and af-s 60mm micro 
G and liked it a lot but it has focus issues with d3x because of absence of 
focus limiter and it is to narrow for me so I am looking for 50mm af-s .I have 
more macro lenses so the thing I need is a mid range lens.What do you think 
about it?<br>
 After that considering your reviews I want to buy a 16-35 vr 
which would be great with 50mm but they say that lens has problems with high 
resolution of d3x.Do you think the same?<br>
 If you say buy 16-35 than do you 
thing I need 24mm 1.4 in that case?<br>

<p>Ahmed, thank you for your feedback, I appreciate it!</p> 
<p>Can I ask why you need the 50mm or 60mm lenses? What type of photography 
are you trying to do? Also, in terms of 16-35mm, are you interested in it 
because of its ultra-wide capabilities? Since you are on a D3x, I would suggest 
to go with the 14-24mm f/2.8G instead, because it is sharper. Yes, I have also 
heard about low performance of the 16-35mm on the D3x, so I would not take the 
risk. After your 24mm f/1.4, most lenses will look like crap now, including the 
16-35mm ;-)</p> 
<p>Yes, I would keep the 24mm f/1.4 &ndash; it is certainly Nikon&rsquo;s 
sharpest wide angle lens.</p> Reply <br>

 After surfing all over the web for REAL people&rsquo;s comments 
and review, your site is the best! In fact, I bought the D90 (in April-10) 
after getting your advice and I&rsquo;m loving it (even though D7000 is out). 
Since then I&rsquo;ve been happily taking pictures of my baby girl. However, I 
think would like to go for a prime lens as to get a better indoor portrait of 
my baby.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m still pondering over these few models:<br>
 a) AF-S NIKKOR 35mm 
f/1.4G &ndash; latest, probably be darn expensive<br>
 &hellip; or could cause 
other primes price drop<br>
 b) Nikon 50mm f/1.4G &ndash; at MYR1850, maybe not 
now<br>
 c) Nikon 35mm f/1.8G &ndash; Still can afford MYR850, some say 
it&rsquo;s better than 50mm f/1.8 50mm. I dunno why?<br>
 d) Nikon 50mm f/1.8D 
&ndash; Cheapest of the lot at MYR 400.00</p> 
<p>Which one do you think would suit the D90 most, 50mm or 35mm?<br>
 
I&rsquo;m kinda on a limited budget here. Which of the Optimus Prime (hehehe) 
would you recommend?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Wochomi, I&rsquo;m glad you like your D90 &ndash; it is a terrific camera 
and it looks like it won&rsquo;t get updated until next year anyway, so you 
shouldn&rsquo;t feel too bad about the D7000.</p> 
<p>In terms of getting a portrait lens, the 50mm f/1.4G is excellent and my 
favorite of the group, but it might feel a little too long on a DX camera like 
D90. In that regard, the 35mm f/1.8G is better, since you can fit a lot more 
into the frame. If you have a large place to take pictures of your kid, go for 
the 50mm. If space is a problem, go for the 35mm.</p>

comparing the nikon 50 f/1.4 afd versus the afs version, and I just wanted to 
say wow, great article.</p> 
<p>As for me, I recently had my gear stolen (this past monday, it kinda sucks) 
and I am going into this from the viewpoint of trying to recover the most 
necessary lenses.</p> 
<p>Among the lenses I lost, was my prized 50mm f/1.2. My only downfall with 
the lens, was occasionally the lack of auto focus availability. But I also 
enjoyed using a closeup filter for it, which would not be compatible with the 
new AFS version (it has a 52mm filter size).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m torn between saving money and wanting to replace my gear with 
lenses that will have equal performance value with my old ones.</p> 
<p>In your professional opinion, would you reccomend I go for the old 50mm 
f/1.4 to save money and go towards replacing my other 2 stolen lenses and flash 
unit, or to get this one for the best possible image quality, which might 
compare to the f/1.2?</p> 
<p>I would like to use it for portraits, pictures of my friends, random 
awesome objects I see in my day to day activities and to a lesser extent band 
photography. So basically portraits and also photojournalistic types of 
photography eventually.</p> 
<p>I appreciate the help.</p> 
<p>Thank you Nasim,<br>

<p>Thank you for your feedback Mike and I apologize for a late reply!</p> 
<p>I am very sorry to hear that your camera gear got stolen&hellip;</p> 
<p>In terms of replacing your 50mm f/1.2, I think you should definitely give 
theNikon 50mm f/1.4G a try &ndash; the AF is something you will definitely 
enjoy after working with a MF lens for a long time. It saves a lot of time for 
sure. The f/1.2 is a great lens, but the manual focus is something I was never 
comfortable with, especially when dealing with large apertures between f/1.2 
and f/2.8&hellip; The Nikon 50mm f/1.4G is a great lens that I use more than 
any other and it will serve you well for the type of photography you want to 
do&hellip;</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Nice review you got there. I just bought this 50mm f/1.4 G lens. I&rsquo;m 
really amazed by its picture quality, and I really love how much I can control 
the DOF. I also have the 35mm DX 1.8 lens, but I&rsquo;ll sell it because I 
don&rsquo;t use it anymore on my D3000, I only use this 50mm, or the 18-55 kit 
lens which came with the camera.</p>

<p>Very good you article. I have a Nikon D3000 with a Nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G 
VR AF-S DX, and I am about to buy 2 more lenses.</p>

<p>Jorge, I have written a review of the Nikon 55-300mm lens earlier, so you 
can check out what I think there.</p> 
<p>In terms of 50mm vs 35mm lenses, see my Nikon 35mm vs 50mm article that I 
published yesterday &ndash; I cover all differences and provide 
recommendations. If your focus is portraits and you want to get the 
best-looking portraits, get the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G. If you just need a lens for 
general photography, get the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G.</p> 
<p>As for USA/Imported versions, use this link for the 50mm version and this 
link for the 35mm version. You definitely do not want to buy the imported 
version &ndash; it is the same as a &ldquo;grey market&rdquo; version, which 
means it will come with no warranty of any kind.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hello Nassim,</p> 
<p>I have less than a month with my two new lenses. Instead of buying the 
55-300 I bought the 70-300 VR and I am in love of the pictures I have taken 
with it.</p> 
<p>Talking about 35 vs 50 I choose the 35mm because of the price, I have not 
used it to much yet because I really love the 70-300, lol, but I took some good 
pictures with this 35mm lens also especially in low-light situations</p>

<p>Brian, those lenses are good for portraiture and reach (wildlife, etc), but 
not for wide-angle photography. If you want to take wider pictures, you might 
want to look into theNikon 35mm f/1.4G instead, because it is wider than 50mm. 
If you want to cover even wider frames, you might want to get a kit lens like 
the Nikon 18-55mm, which is a very inexpensive lens.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Mine back focuses when focused from other AF points it is consistently more 
spot-on on the center focus is this due to the d90 having only 1 cross type Af 
point in the center?</p> 
<p>I already sent it for calibration it still back focuses on the other af 
point are you using also a d90?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Marvin, the center focus point is always going to be more accurate than 
others, but you should not get a backfocus with all other focus points. Are you 
doing this indoors or outdoors in broad daylight? Try shooting with different 
focus points outside and see whether you still have AF issues. If you do, then 
your camera might be the problem&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nasim.<br>
 this is 1st time for me to read such a valuable blog and 
comments when it comes to choose the right lens for your needs. Thanks a lot 
for this !<br>
 I am an ameture photographer and have a D90 to work with. Kit 
lens seems obsolete since I got my hands on AF-D 35mm F2.0 lens ! its amazingly 
sharp and gr8 t0 shoot as a prime for my D90. Now i was wondering the next 
choice would be either 50mm AF-S 1.4G ( as recommended by you!) or MICRO AF-S 
60mm 2.8G ED. Please help me to compare these on Sharpness and versatality in 
taking portraits as well. I think using a MICRO will give me more detailing as 
reproduction factor is 1:1 (on FX ofcourse) and i can use it elsewhere also. 
Maybe I will compromise on speed on lens. thanks a lot.<br>

<p>Raj, both lenses are comparable, but don&rsquo;t forget that the 50mm is an 
f/1.4 lens, so you can get some really nice shots at very shallow depth of 
field. I personally favor the 50mm f/1.4G over the 60mm macro.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nasim,<br>
 Finally I got my AF-S 50mm 1.4G. Amazing results. But sure 
this is a unforgivable lens if you do not care about the focus point. I am 
using D90 and it seems to be a good portrait lens. But do you have anything to 
say about Internal Light reflections on DX with larger aperures like 1.4. I 
found portraits are diluted in contrast at f1.4 apertures. surely, at 2.8 and 
higher , the contrast is better.</p> 
<p>I also have 35mm AF-2D. I am planning to keep this as DAYLIGHT lens and the 
new 50mm AF-S 1.4G as Evening and indoor lens. Please advice if you may have 
some suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi nasim, thanks for a very interesting comparison of the two lenses. I 
read Thom&rsquo;s review on the nikkor 50mm f1.4G but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to 
look highly on it. After reading your article I&rsquo;m convinced the 1.4G is 
the one to go for. I went to a camera store the other day but the sales guy 
suggested to me the Sigma 50mm f1.4 (latest release) instead.</p> 
<p>What do you think of the Sigma in comparison to the nikkor 1.4G in terms of 
sharpness at wide open and colour rendition?</p> 
<p>BTW, I bought the 24-120mm f4 after reading your article. At first I was 
put off by Ken rockwell&rsquo;s review which suggests the 28-300mm is a better 
bet than the 24-120mm f4. I&rsquo;m glad i bought it and I love it, no regret.

<p>Hi Nasim,</p> 
<p>I recently came across your website and I am now scoping out all of your 
posts. An excellent resource for Nikon lovers! :)</p> 
<p>I have a question regarding my 50mm f/1.4 D lens. I have a Nikon D300 (the 
older version not the video one) and I have found that this lens is not only 
lacking it&rsquo;s sharpness that you seem to achieve with many of your images 
but also the autofocus is off. The little square I use to focus on something in 
a quick moment is off so the space below what I am focusing on is actually in 
focus. Arg. I can not figure this out. Maybe the lens in not compatible? Is the 
lens perhaps damaged? Have you had any experience or may know what is causing 
this issue and how it can be fixed? I love this 50mm lens but I just 
don&rsquo;t know what is wrong!</p>

<p>Sarah, thanks for your feedback. Looks like your 50mm f/1.4D has a front 
focus issue. If you still have it under warranty, I would send it with your 
camera to Nikon and have them fix the focus issue. Once corrected, all your 
images should be in good focus. The lens is surely compatible, so it is most 
likely a front/back focus issue.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nasim,</p> 
<p>Thank you for the reply. I took it to a dealer and found that it was 
&ldquo;overly&rdquo; used. I don&rsquo;t have a warranty because I bought it 
from someone. The barrel (not sure of the correct terminology) shakes. I heard 
that&rsquo;s bad. Let this be a warning to people who buy used gear

<p>Hi Nasim,<br>
 First of all, thank you for your wesite, it has been of 
great help for my photography :)</p> 
<p>I have a Nikon D3100 and I was thinking about getting the AF 50mm 1.8D. I 
know that I won&rsquo;t have the autofocus, but do you think it is a good 
option? The prices are much less than the AF-S version.</p> 
<p>Thank you,</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nasim. Great article and it was interesting to read all the comments 
following. I have a Nikon D7000 (upgraded from D90 and can&rsquo;t believe how 
much better the D7000 is!) and I recently purchased my first prime lens &ndash; 
the Nikon Nikkor AF 50mm 50 f/1.4 D F1.4 D, however, although some photos are 
great, I&rsquo;m also producing a lot of blurry ones too. I&rsquo;ve noticed on 
other forums that I&rsquo;m not the only one. I&rsquo;ve check the speed to 
make sure it&rsquo;s not too slow &ndash; one example of a blurry portrait was 
taken in the shade at f1.4 speed 1/320 ISO 100 and the whole image is blurry 
&ndash; ever so slightly but enough to be out of focus in it&rsquo;s entirety. 
Any tips on what I may be doing wrong? Thank you so much.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hello<br>
 I came across your website and liked your articles&hellip;</p> 
<p>I am using a D90 and currently have the 50mm f1.8 AF-S (Not G). I love the 
bokeh and soft focus it produces. I am thinking about upgrading to the f1.4 but 
unsure whether I will see a marked improvement in the photos between the f1.8 
&amp; f1.4. Also if I do which f1.4 lens to go for?<br>
 Just not sure if i 
need the f1.4 or what?!</p> 
<p>Also great Sunset panorama, would you mind explaining the settings and 
filters you used? I can&rsquo;t seem to capture the orange and reds in the same 
mannor when taking sunset pictures.</p> 
<p>many thanks,</p>

<p>Nasim,</p> 
<p>What shooting mode do you use when using the 1.4? Manual, Apeture priority 
or auto? Do you shoot w/out flash? How long did it take you to figure out which 
ISO/Shutter speed and F stop works best in manual mode in indoor lighting? Any 
rules of thumb?</p> 
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>Good day, thanx for the review! I just upgraded my D40x for the Nikon 
D7000. I have ordered the Nikon 50mm f/1.4G lens and want to buy a filter for 
it. I have no idea what to buy, but I do know that I don&rsquo;t want a cheap 
quality filter that will downgrade the capabilities of my lens. Any suggestion 
on a really good filter? My main reason for a lens filter is to protect it, and 
I think most of my subjects with this lens is my grandsons&hellip;any 
suggestions? I would appreciate to hear your recommendations!</p> Reply <br>

<p>i think you should always mention the price in your reviews,<br>
 either 
MSRP or street price will do.<br>
 for many of us, that particular factor is 
the real deal-breaker</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nasim,</p> 
<p>I want to ask for the 50mm f/1.4D, because there is no internal focus, 
whether that is not possible in pairs cpl filter?</p> 
<p>Can you give me advice between 50mm f/1, 8D and 50mm f/1.4D?</p> 
<p>Regards,</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nasim,</p> 
<p>For a Nikon FX (D800 almost here!) is it worthwhile going to a 50mm prime 
if I have the 60mm 2.8 D micro? I know I gain some speed but the 60mm is a 
pretty sharp lens, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be gaining much if I was looking at the 
50mm 1.8 which you and others recommend over the 1.4. Thanks!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nassim,</p> 
<p>I just bought a D7000. I bought a kit lens although I know it&rsquo;s not 
fantastic quality. I want to invest in a 50mm. I&rsquo;m hesitating between 1.4 
and 1.8. Great difference in price and quality obviously. I used to have the 
1.8. I shot some decent pics with it in Costa Rica. I had no macro so I used it 
as one to photograph insects at a fairly close range and although I 
didn&rsquo;t get the results of a macro, the pics were still pretty good. I was 
wondering if the 1.4 would make even sharper pics. Do you even recommend it 
with a D7000 ?</p> 
<p>Thank you for your advice. It&rsquo;s really nice of you to actually take 
time to do this.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Nassim, I love your work and photography tips. Your tips are very 
helpful to me. I have a nikon d3100 camera and want to buy a prime lens. I want 
to be able to use this lens for anything. But I also, prefer one that does well 
in low light situations. What lens would you recommend that won&rsquo;t cost a 
lot of money? ($150 max).<br>
 Thanks,<br>
