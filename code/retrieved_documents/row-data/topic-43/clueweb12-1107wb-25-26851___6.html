Canon 5D Mark III vs Nikon D800 <br>
 category: For-photographers <br>

<p>Canon just released the specifications of the new Canon 5D Mark III. The 
camera that is the successor of the very popular Canon 5D Mark II. I have been 
anticipating this camera for a long time, and so have lots of other 
photographers. On Februari 6th Nikon released the specs for the Nikon D800. The 
Nikon D800 replaces the Nikon D700, which was also a very highly acclaimed 
camera. The Nikon D800 is seen as the direct competitor to the Canon 5D Mark 
III.</p> 
<p>I myself am very interested in seeing a comparison of the specifications of 
these two highly anticipated cameras. I know that these are just the specs, 
which don&rsquo;t tell the whole story, but for the moment this is all we have. 
I have not been able to do a hands-on comparison of these two cameras yet, 
simply because they are not yet for sale.</p> <br>

<p>Before we have have a look at the specifications of the newest models, 
let&rsquo;s quickly go over the differences between the predecessors of these 
two cameras, the Canon 5D Mark 2 and the Nikon D700. This is interesting 
because Canon and Nikon seem to have listened very closely at the complaints 
and praises about their products when the were developing their newest models.
</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s start off by looking at the Nikon D700. Compared to the 5D Mark 
II, the D700 doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of megapixels. The Canon has 21 
megapixels and the Nikon has 12 megapixels. This is one of the most commonly 
heard complaints about the D700. But, it is also one of the few complaints that 
you can come up with about this camera. The sensor in the D700 is the same as 
the sensor in de Nikon D3, which was then Nikon&rsquo;s top model. However, 
when the Nikon D3 was released it was already critized for having a sensor with 
only 12 megapixels. The Nikon D700 does have an excellent Autofocus (AF) 
system. The AF was also exactly the same as the system found in the Nikon D3. 
In addition to that, the D700 had very good high ISO performance, which can 
still be considered very good today, almost 4 years later.</p> 
<p>The Canon 5D Mark II has very similar high ISO performance to the Nikon 
D700. Different tests seem to go back and forth as to which of these two 
cameras is actually the better one in the higher ISO regions. The AF 
performance on the Canon 5D Mark II was something that received a lot of 
complaints from a lot of people. It had the same AF system as its predecessor, 
the Canon 5D. This AF system was already considered to be inadequate when the 
original Canon 5D was released. We already talked about the sensor resolution a 
little bit. The Canon 5D Mark II has a lot of megapixels, 21.1 MP to be 
precise. This was a feature that attracted a lot of people to this camera. 
I&rsquo;m not going to go into details about the video capabilities of these 
two cameras, because to me this is not an interesting feature. But I will 
mention that the video capabilities of the 5D Mark II are better than the 
D700&prime;s.</p> 
<p>So, to recap the Canon 5D Mark II versus Nikon D700 comparison. The pluses 
of the 5D Mark II are that is has a lot of megapixels and it has very good high 
ISO performance. The biggest complaint was the poor AF performance. The pluses 
of the D700 are the excellent AF system and the very good ISO performance. The 
biggest complaint that was heard was the low sensor resolution. With this 
background information in mind, let&rsquo;s take a look at the specifications 
of the latest models.</p> Camera Feature Canon 5D Mark III Nikon D800 <br>

<br>

<p>To me, what stands out immediately in this comparison is the sensor 
resolution of the Nikon D800. Nikon has addressed the biggest complaint about 
the D700. In fact they haven&rsquo;t just addressed it, they have now made the 
sensor resolution the most prominent feature of the D800. The 36 megapixels of 
the new Nikon is a 200% increase compared to the previous model, which leaves 
Canon trailing behind by a mile. Or so it would seem&hellip; the real question 
is &ldquo;do we really need, or want, this many megapixels&rdquo;. I know that 
for me the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I currently use the Canon 5D Mark II as 
my main camera and I already think that 21 megapixels is too much. I much 
prefer the 13 megapixels of the Canon 5D classic. To me personally 12 or 13 
megapixels is enough, I don&rsquo;t like having to keep buying bigger and 
bigger memory cards, or having to swap out my CF card all the time because it 
is full. But of course that&rsquo;s just my opinion. Others, for example 
landscape and architecture photographers, are really happy with the increase in 
sensor resolution. A recentonline pole shows that about 41% of the respondents 
were happy with Nikon&rsquo;s choice to put a 36 megapixels sensor in the D800. 
The other 59% would have rather seen the 16 megapixel sensor of the Nikon D4 in 
the Nikon D800.</p> 
<p>The second feature that stands out to me is the AF system of the Canon. 
Again, Canon seems to have really done their best to fix the Achilles&rsquo; 
heel of the Canon 5D Mark II (and the 5D classic for that matter). And they 
seem to have succeeded. Canon has taken the Auto Focus system of their top 
model and placed it in the 5D Mark 3 body. This might seem like a very normal 
thing to do to a Nikon user, because Nikon has been doing this for quite a 
while. But, this is fairly unique for Canon. The last time that a Canon 
prosumer body (i.e. a model just below the top model) had the same AF system as 
its bigger sibling, was in the pre-digital age with the Canon EOS-3 film body. 
So, kudos to Canon for addressing this complaint in the best possible way. I 
have good hopes that the 5D Mark III will now actually be able to get AF lock 
in the dark situations where I would previously have to manually focus (or miss 
the shot altogether).</p> 
<p>The feature that I personally find most important is the high ISO 
performance. I shoot indoors a lot, and we have a lot of dark and dreary days 
over here. So I want to be able to shoot at 6400 and higher ISO without having 
to worry about lots of noise. I have to say that my 5D Mark II does not satisfy 
my needs as much as I would like to in this area. So, do the 5D Mark III and 
the D800 perform better in this area? Well, it&rsquo;s hard to say by just 
looking at the specs. Field tests will have to show how these camera&rsquo;s 
really compare to each other and their predecessors. But, we can take some 
clues from the specifications. Let&rsquo;s start by looking at the D800. The 
ISO range of this camera goes up to 25,600, which is the same as it&rsquo;s 
predecessor the D700. From this we can conclude that it is likely that the 
performance at higher ISO values is comparable to the Nikon D700. This 
conclusion is confirmed by a statement made by a representative of Nikon France 
in arecent interview. This representative said that the performance of the D800 
is equivalent to the D700 at all sensitivity levels, i.e. over the entire ISO 
range. When we look at the specs for the Canon 5D Mark III, we see that this 
camera&rsquo;s ISO range goes all the way up to 102,400. That is a full two 
stops better than it&rsquo;s predecessor, and the Nikon D800. This could mean 
that it&rsquo;s high ISO performance is also two stops better. If this is the 
case it would mean that the 5D Mark III would perform similar to the Nikon D3s, 
which is the top notch camera at the moment (by a mile) when it comes to image 
quality at high ISO&rsquo;s. But, like I said, we will have to wait until these 
camera&rsquo;s are available to the public to see how the specifications 
translate to actual real world performance.</p> 
<p>Another interesting difference in the specs is the continuous shooting 
speed. The Nikon D700 has a continuous shooting speed of 5 frames per second 
(FPS), and even 8 FPS with its Battery Grip attached. I&rsquo;ve read before 
from someone that this was their main reason for using the D700 over the Canon 
5D Mark II. The 5D Mark II has a frame rate of only 3.9 FPS. So, it&rsquo;s 
interesting to see that the D800 now has a lower frame rate of 4 FPS, while 
Canon has substantially increased their frame rate to 6 FPS. To me, these 
numbers are not very important however because I almost always use the camera 
in single shot mode. But to some people the FPS is a big deal and Canon now has 
the advantage in this department. Although the advantage is negated when the 
D800 is fitted with its Battery Grip, which gives the D800 the capacity to also 
shoot at 6 frames per second.</p> 
<p>One last feature I want to discuss is the dual card slots. This is a new 
feature on both of these cameras. We&rsquo;ve seen a dual card slots on non-pro 
models from Nikon before, but we haven&rsquo;t seen this before from Canon. I 
welcome this feature. Although, like many others I would have preferred dual CF 
card slots. But, I think that the body size of these camera&rsquo;s is just too 
small to neatly fit two CF card slots. One CF card slot and one SD card slot is 
a nice compromise.</p> 
<p>To wrap it all up, should we be happy with these new camera&rsquo;s? I 
think so. They are different enough to give us some choice. But they share 
enough nice features to classify both cameras as very worthy successors to the 
cameras that they replace.</p>

<p>Bedankt voor deze heldere analyse. Nu is het wachten op de testrapporten en 
ervaringen van gebruikers. Ik stel de aanschaf van een D800 nog even uit. Ik 
denk trouwens dat ik ook gek zou worden van de enorme bestanden die de D800 op 
zal leveren. Het betekent een behoorlijke vertraging van mijn hele workflow. 
Wellicht is nu het moment gekomen om van mijn D300s over te stappen op een 
gebruikte D700!</p>  Dimitris <br>

<p>I wll like to ask if the 36 MP does any good in the photos , I mean can you 
compare a photo from a 36 MP camera to a 12 MP ?</p>  Mark Daams <br>

<p>Dimitris, it all depends on how big you view the images. For a web sized 
image you most likely will not see much of a difference. If are you looking at 
prints though, you will start seeing a difference at large print sizes, for 
example sizes over 45 x 30 cm. At this point it is all somewhat speculation 
though because I myself haven&rsquo;t gotten my hands on the D800 yet. As soon 
as I have a production model D800 I&rsquo;ll try to do a mini review blog post.
