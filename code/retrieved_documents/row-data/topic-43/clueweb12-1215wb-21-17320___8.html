<h3>New Vancouver 2010 Logo</h3> 
<p>Here's the new logo for the 2010 Winter Olympics to be held in Vancouver:
</p> 
<blockquote> </blockquote>According to the Vancouver 2010 Website: 
<blockquote> For centuries, the Inuit people of Canada's Arctic stacked rock 
in human form to create the inukshuk, a steadfast guidepost that provided 
direction across the vast horizons of the North...
<p>With the deepest appreciation for Canada's aboriginal heritage and for the 
joy Canadians share in celebrating winter's snow and ice, the emblem of the 
Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games is a contemporary interpretation of the 
inukshuk. It is called &quot;Ilanaaq&quot;, which is the Inuit word for friend.
</p> </blockquote>I liked the old logo, but I like the new one, too. Though it 
does look kind of likeStrong Sad:

<h3>Nikon on the NEF Controversy</h3> 
<p>So Nikon starts using a new image file format in which part of it is 
encrypted. Usersnotice and complain. Nikon responds, and as a marketing person, 
I don't know whether to be in awe or contempt of their attempt to clarify their 
position while saying absolutely nothing:</p> 
<blockquote> The Nikon D2X professional Digital Single Lens Reflex camera has 
received widely positive acclaim for its overall performance and image 
processing quality. Recently, speculative statements which appear to be based 
on misunderstandings and misinformation about the D2X camera's 
&quot;encryption&quot; of certain white balance data have propagated on the 
internet.
<p>The purpose of this advisory is to clarify this matter with facts and 
explanations.</p> </blockquote>Excellent! We're all looking forward to it. 
<p></p> 
<blockquote> The Nikon D2X is capable of producing high quality images that 
can be saved in a variety of file formats, including the proprietary Nikon 
Electronic Format (NEF), standard TIFF and several levels of standard JPEG 
compressed files.</blockquote>Okay, so NEF <i>is</i> proprietary. At least 
they've admitted to that.
<blockquote> The NEF, a Nikon proprietary raw file design, was introduced with 
the Nikon D1 Camera and Nikon's original Capture software. The combination of 
Nikon camera, in-camera image processing, NEF file format and in-computer image 
processing with original Nikon Capture software was developed as a system that 
faithfully saved image files that represent the camera settings made manually 
or automatically by the photographer at the time a picture was taken.
</blockquote>Isn't the point of <i>any</i> digital camera file format to 
faithfully save image files that represent the camera settings made by the 
photographer?
<blockquote> Nikon's preservation of its unique technology in the NEF file is 
employed as an action that protects the uniqueness of the file.</blockquote>
This sentence says nothing.
<blockquote> At the same time, Nikon makes available a software developer kit 
(SDK) that, when implemented appropriately, enables a wide range of NEF 
performance, including white balance, for Nikon photographers and their 
productive use of the NEF file.</blockquote>Now we're getting to it. Nikon 
wants developers to license an SDK in order to be able to access certain 
information in the pictures that users create.
<blockquote> Since the inception of the system, Nikon has always provided 
photographers with choices about how they might use the system's performance 
and enjoy high quality images. Nikon&rsquo;s choices for opening and processing 
NEF files have been and continue to include:
<p> * Nikon Capture software<br>
 * Plug-in for Adobe&rsquo;s Photoshop<br>
 * 
Nikon PictureProject software<br>
 * Nikon View software<br>
 * Availability of 
Nikon Software Developer Kit (SDK) and the software that has been developed 
using the SDK</p> 
<p>Through use of the Nikon Software Developer Kit, authorized developers can 
produce software by applying creative concepts to their implementation and 
adding capabilities to open Nikon's NEF file and use NEF's embedded 
Instructions and Nikon's Libraries.</p> </blockquote>Was that last sentence 
actually written in Japan?
<p></p> 
<blockquote> Nikon photographers reap benefits from independent developers' 
approaches, because it allows the photographer to open and process their NEF 
images.</blockquote>As opposed to opening up the format, in which case 
independent developers<i>couldn't</i> open and process... uh, never mind. 
<blockquote> After a developer's software is created using the Nikon SDK, a 
NEF file can be opened, edited in either TIFF or JPEG format, and then saved in 
formats available in the developers' software. This process has been available 
since the first Nikon SDK for NEF.</blockquote>Wow! You mean if developers 
license your SDK, their software can open the photos I take? And then edit 
them? And then save them? Will the wonders never cease?
<blockquote> With each introduction of a new Nikon digital Single Lens Reflex 
model, Nikon updates the available SDK selection to provide new information; 
this is the situation with the D2X, D2Hs and D50 models. As stated above, 
application for the Nikon SDK is possible for bona fide software companies that 
send Nikon a written application for the SDK. Once approved, the SDK is 
provided to the developer at no charge and they are authorized to use it.
</blockquote>I love that term, &quot;bona fide software companies&quot;. Open 
source developers and interested end-users need not apply.
<blockquote> Nikon has provided its confidential SDK software to many software 
developers. With the Nikon SDK, developers may design excellent and creative 
compatibility between the NEF and their software, all without compromising the 
integrity of the NEF's original concept, and ensuring that work done by the 
photographer during the picture taking process can be incorporated into the 
rendering of the image.</blockquote>&quot;...design excellent and creative 
compatibility&quot;? I was joking above about this having been written in 
Japan. Now I'm not joking. I think it was, and I think that Nikon USA's PR 
people tried to edit it, but gave up when they couldn't understand what the 
hell headquarters was saying. &quot;...without compromising the integrity of 
the NEF's original concept&quot;? What exactly does that mean? How does it 
&quot;compromise integrity&quot; for software to directly read in a file?
<blockquote> The trilogy of performance, from Camera-to-NEF-to-Capture, has 
evolved though several generations of Nikon Digital SLR models, improving along 
the way. As a proprietary format, Nikon secures NEF's structure and processing 
through various technologies. Securing this structure is intended for the 
photographer's benefit, and dedicated to ensuring faithful reproduction of the 
photographer's creative intentions through consistent performance and rendition 
of the images. Discussions propagated on the internet suggesting otherwise are 
misinformed about the unique structure of NEF.</blockquote>Oh, so it's for 
photographers' own good that Nikon won't let them read the data in their 
photographs? Good to know. Thanks, Nikon!
<blockquote> Nikon's Camera System, NEF and Capture software are a tightly 
knit system, and they are all developed through the cooperative efforts of 
Nikon's design teams, and this collaboration results in achieving the highest 
image quality.</blockquote>Unlike those other digital camera vendors, who don't 
have proprietary formats, and so don't have &quot;tightly knit&quot; systems.
<blockquote> Nikon strives to provide photographers with excellent picture 
taking performance, compatible Nikon in-system image processing performance and 
by extension, compatibility with additional software developers' products, with 
the ultimate goal of delivering a high level of integrity for a photographer's 
creative vision.
<p>Nikon continues to welcome dialogue with bona fide software developers.</p> 
</blockquote>Nikon to all non-developers: STFU. 
<p></p> 
<p>The inimitable Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e used to call Microsoft's 
proprietary Office file formats (Word, Excel, etc.) &quot;roach motels&quot; -- 
&quot;roaches go in,&quot; he'd say, &quot;but they don't go out.&quot; In 
other words, once you start accumulating a library of data in one of these 
formats, it's very hard to walk away from Office. I don't know Nikon's true 
aims in creating a proprietary format. Perhaps they want to be able to revise 
it frequently without breaking compatibility. (Possible, but there have long 
existed methods of doing this with open formats.) Perhaps they have only the 
best intentions. But I think the Web community (if it's possible to say such a 
thing) now understands the roach motel concept, and though it's too late with 
regard to Office, we don't want to let it happen again.</p> 
<p>I have (as I go to check) 5,960 digital photos that I've taken since 1998, 
and I'm now accumulating new images at the rate of 1,500-2,000 per year. I'll 
have these photos with me for the rest of my life, always in digital format. 
The thought that I might be dependent on a proprietary SDK to read some of the 
information in any of them is upsetting -- and in fact I do have a few 
photographs taken with the mechanically and optically excellent Nikon D70 
camera we have at work. So the idea I had to buy my own digital SLR from Nikon 
is now out the window. I'll continue to live with my PowerShot SD300, perhaps 
upgrade to an SD500, and if I want a digital SLR, I'll take an extra-long look 
at Canon's models. Nikon will be off the list.</p>

<h3>The 2005 Theocracy Comeback Tour</h3> 
<p>With the Republicans' election wins in November, the United States now has 
the rough equivalent of a parliamentary majority. The party in power -- 
assuming it holds ranks -- can do pretty much whatever it wants. Leaving aside 
partisanship for a moment -- and only for a moment -- I find it curious that 
the Republicans seem to be focused on the powers they<i>don't</i> have instead 
of the powers they<i>do</i>:</p> 
<blockquote> Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, has agreed to join a 
handful of prominent Christian conservatives in a telecast portraying Democrats 
as &quot;against people of faith&quot; for blocking President Bush's [judicial] 
nominees.
<p>Fliers for the telecast, organized by the Family Research Council and 
scheduled to originate at a Kentucky megachurch the evening of April 24, call 
the day &quot;Justice Sunday&quot; and depict a young man holding a Bible in 
one hand and a gavel in the other. The flier does not name participants, but 
under the heading &quot;the filibuster against people of faith,&quot; it reads: 
&quot;The filibuster was once abused to protect racial bias, and it is now 
being used against people of faith.&quot;</p> </blockquote>Found here in the <i>
New York Times</i>, via OxBlog. 
<p></p> 
<p>Why spend one's political capital to get 10 blocked judicial nominees 
through the Senate? Is there some larger purpose at work here? Some deft, 
subtle strategy that eludes me? Because from where I sit, I can't see it. From 
where I sit, it looks like the Republicans are like a spoiled child on his 
birthday, looking at the tower of gifts and throwing a tantrum over the one 
gift he didn't get.</p> 
<p>It's worse than that. As far as I can tell, whatever the Republicans may 
wish their post-election message to be, in reality, based on their actions to 
date, it has been the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Social Security reform is a great idea. </li> 
<li>Bankruptcy reform is going to help the average person. </li> 
<li>It was urgent that Congress intervene in the Schiavo case. </li> 
<li>That Tom DeLay, he's one fine, upstanding character.</li> </ul>If I were a 
Republican, I'd be furious with my party for squandering its opportunity like 
this. As it is, I'm not a Republican (nor am I a Democrat), and so, 
partisanship picked up from the side table once again, I find much of what the 
Republicans have been doing to be disgusting.
<p>Social Security reform is a good idea in theory, but the President has 
never actually advanced a plan, and the plans advanced by his vassals have been 
incompetent at best. Bankruptcy reform is a reasonable idea in theory, but the 
bill passed was so one-sided against consumers, it could have come straight out 
of the Middle Ages.</p> 
<p>And then we come to the Schiavo case and the filibuster. In the former, the 
Republicans (and some Democrats), disagreeing with years and years of 
consistent judicial decisions, many (if not most) by judges appointed by their 
own party, tried to overrule the judiciary by legislative fiat, all to preserve 
a life when it was impossible to find<i>anyone</i> who could say that they 
would want their<i>own</i> life preserved in such a state, and all in the name 
of God. In the latter, the Republicans are now invoking the name of God again, 
saying that the removal of a longstanding Senate rule, used quite often by 
themselves when they were the minority party, is somehow against God's will.</p>
<p>It's not just disgusting. It's frightening. It's the attempted comeback of 
the theocracy. I suppose that's the larger purpose at work. The Republicans 
want to use their expanded powers to remove -- or at least minimize -- secular 
influences in government.</p>

<h3>&quot;Shorthorn&quot; and Innovation</h3> 
<p>This is pretty funny:</p> 
<blockquote> Despite the removal of WinFS from Longhorn, Allchin was adamant 
that the new OS will contain enough features to be compelling for consumers and 
PC makers.
<p>&quot;There's no question -- we made some trade-offs here. I couldn't do 
everything that everybody wanted from the customer perspective, and they were 
very clear in what trade-off they wanted us to make,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Still, he said, dubbing Longhorn without WinFS as &quot;Shorthorn&quot; is 
&quot;derogatory,&quot; because the operating system &quot;is packed full of 
capabilities.&quot; Some of the features he mentioned were &quot;great roaming 
support,&quot; .Net Framework 2.0, &quot;new browsing capabilities,&quot; the 
&quot;fresh&quot; user interface, improved migrations and deployments, 
&quot;more resilience to malware&quot; and &quot;a new photo experience.&quot;
</p> </blockquote>So Jim Allchin is upset because people are making fun of the 
scaled-back feature set of Longhorn? Am I supposed to be sympathetic?
<p></p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Apple is about to ship Tiger, and from the looks of it, Tiger 
might have just as many new features -- if not more -- than Longhorn. And since 
releasing OS X 10.0 four years ago, Apple has been averaging about a year 
between major operating system releases. In other words, it's entirely possible 
that they could have<i>another</i> new version out by the time Longhorn ships.
</p> 
<p>A reasonable question to ask is why Apple is able to innovate so much more 
quickly. I don't believe the average IQ is any higher in Cupertino than it is 
in Redmond, nor do I believe Apple has some secret project management sauce 
that Microsoft lacks. My assumption is that the difference is in the hardware 
base. Apple writes software only for its own hardware and can be ruthless about 
not supporting machines that are past their prime. Microsoft writes software 
for a vast and diverse universe of hardware and assumes people are going to try 
to install new operating systems on pretty much anything they can plug into a 
power outlet.</p> 
<p>I honestly don't know which is the superior approach. I'm fundamentally 
attracted to distributed systems, like the PC hardware market. But do 
distributed systems always win? It depends on how you measure winning. The 
Wintel platform has overwhelming market share, true. But Apple -- one little 
company with just over a third of the market capitalization of Dell alone -- 
somehow seems to consistently create new hardware that runs rings around 
anything done by Wintel manufacturers. How can that be?</p>

<h3>Trackbacks Disabled</h3> 
<p>I've temporarily disabled trackbacks on my blog. I was getting 50-100 spam 
trackbacks per day, and when my first attempt to installMT-Blacklist failed, I 
gave up for the time being and just disabled trackbacks on a global basis.</p> 
<p>What strikes me about spammers is how much work they're willing to create 
for vast numbers of people to get very little benefit to themselves. I think of 
the countless hours I've spent dealing with spam in both e-mail and on my blog, 
and how many millions of people have done the same, and it's all so that a 
relatively small community of pathologically sleazy people can make a little 
bit of money. A spammer who turns on a script to blast trackbacks across 
thousands of blogs overnight doesn't think or care about all the work he's 
creating for people; he just thinks about the fact that he might make one or 
two sales as a result.</p>

<h3>Apple's Quarterly Results</h3> 
<p>Apple announced their Q2 2005 results yesterday (announcement here, 
conference call coveragehere). I was honestly astounded:</p> 
<blockquote> For the quarter, the Company posted a net profit of $290 million, 
or $.34 per diluted share. These results compare to a net profit of $46 
million, or $.06 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the 
quarter was $3.24 billion, up 70 percent from the year-ago quarter...
<p>Apple shipped 1,070,000 Macintosh&reg; units and 5,311,000 iPods during the 
quarter, representing a 43 percent increase in CPU units and a 558 percent 
increase in iPods over the year-ago quarter.</p> </blockquote>Just when I was 
wondering if perhaps the iPod frenzy had cooled down a bit, they sell five 
million iPods in the quarter -- six and a half times as many as in the same 
quarter last year? And a 43 percent increase in CPU units? Clearly some of that 
is due to the Mac mini, but the hypothesized &quot;halo effect&quot; -- iPod 
purchasers later switching to the Mac -- must be real.

<h3>Multi-iPod Households</h3> 
<p>John Ludwig writes about the frustrations of a multi-iPod household:</p> 
<blockquote> And itunes really sucks at handling this. we like to keep all our 
music on one server and this just creates a legion of problems. Getting itunes 
on all machines to take notice of new music on the server. Sharing playlists 
across the network. Ratings collision -- we all have different ratings we want 
to maintain. And doing different loads of music onto each ipod.</blockquote>I 
have some experience with this myself, though not with nearly as complex a 
setup as John has. I'd say that iTunes is actually reasonably good at allowing 
different loads of music on a per-iPod basis -- at least it seems that way to 
me. But after that, multi-user support degenerates quickly. Ratings collision 
is a big issue -- as noted, each user may have different ratings to maintain. 
And then there's the issue of playback frequency -- iTunes makes it easy to 
create Smart Playlists that key off frequency and last-played date, but with 
multiple users, this isn't really useful for any one person.
<p>Apple, are you on top of this?</p>

<h3>Hardware Acceleration for Physics</h3> 
<p>This is potentially very cool:</p> 
<blockquote> [G]ame creators haven't taken the time to calculate the physics 
that govern the behavior of objects such as falling bricks. [Manju] Hegde, CEO 
of Mountain View, Calif., startup Ageia, wants to make it easy for them to do 
that with a chip for the personal computer that specializes in physics 
calculations.
<p>Dubbed PhysX, the chip will enable things like gelatinous creatures whose 
bodies shift shape like a liquid, crumpling fenders in car crashes, massive 
explosions with 10,000 pieces of debris, clothing that hangs realistically, and 
lava or blood that flows like the real thing...</p> 
<p>Ageia has $38 million in venture capital from firms such as Apex Partners 
and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. It has commitments for $30 million more 
from other investors.</p> 
<p>One reason Ageia has garnered such support is its chip could tip the scales 
in the PC's battle with game consoles.</p> 
<p>The PC gaming community is about to be overshadowed by another set of new 
consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Those machines will have plenty of 
extra processing power to handle better physics.</p> 
<p>The consoles will be able to calculate the interaction of moving objects 
and determine what the graphics chip needs to display on the screen at any 
instant. And they may have enough power to imbue the game environment with 
physical attributes, so that the grass sways when the wind blows.</p> 
<p>Hegde says a PC with a physics chip could match the consoles...</p> 
<p>But do gamers really want to buy an add-on card just to improve the realism 
in their games? Ageia's president, Curtis Davis, argues that they will when 
they realize physics is key to situations where they try to do something in a 
game and the environment doesn't respond. If you crash a plane into some trees 
and none fall, it destroys the fantasy...</p> 
<p>But Hegde said Ageia's first physics chip will be akin to network 
processors, with many processors operating in parallel. As such, he says the 
chip will be more powerful at specific physics tasks than a microprocessor.</p> 
<p>Hegde believes developers will make use of the physics chip because it 
results in better games.</p> 
<p>Ageia plans to have add-on boards with its chip out by Christmas. And it 
hopes at least five games will exploit its hardware physics by the time the 
add-on cards go on sale.</p> </blockquote>So, first, a reality check: the odds 
of widespread developer support for a physics accelerator card are low, to say 
the least. To take advantage of it, games would have to be rewritten to feature 
more opportunities for higher-quality physics, and the game business is tough 
enough as it is without spending money implementing features for less than one 
percent of the market.
<p></p> 
<p>Having said that, could this have a future in next-generation consoles? 
Given that Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony are all launching next-gen consoles in 
the next few weeks, this is a good time for Ageia to be coming out. By the time 
they're in the market, can show off what they're capable of, and have their 
prices down -- say, by early next year -- the console makers could be kicking 
off their next-next-generation early design efforts. Sony wouldn't use 
something like this; I'm sure they'd see the Cell as their solution to this 
sort of thing (which it may well be). But Microsoft? Nintendo? Could be.</p>

<h3>How Long to Be Robbed in Naples?</h3> 
<p>In the April 2005 issue of <i>National Geographic Traveler</i> (unavailable 
online, even with a subscription --<i>Geographic</i> doesn't get it) is an 
article on petty crime around the world, &quot;Thieves Among Us&quot;. It 
recounts an interesting experiment conducted in Naples:</p> 
<blockquote> Last summer, [Bob Arno and Bambi Vincent, a Las Vegas-based 
husband-and-wife team who have tracked petty crime worldwide] set up an 
experiment to determine how long it would take for a Rolex watch to be stolen 
in Naples's crime-plagued Spanish Quarter. Arno wasn't out on the street long 
when he heard a whistle -- a signal from a &quot;spotter&quot; to his cohorts. 
Soon after, one of them whizzed by on a Vespa, evaluating the goods on Arno's 
wrist (the real thing can fetch $3,500 on the black market). Moments later, 
several scooters cornered Arno and the bandits made off with the watch. Total 
lapsed time: four minutes. The gang miscalculated, however, as the Rolex was 
fake. &quot;It's about as stupid as you can get walking around with a Rolex in 
the Quartiere Spagnolo,&quot; he says.</blockquote>

<h3>Reporting Hate Speech = Hate Speech?</h3> 
<p>This is so absurd it's almost funny. A former aboriginal leader from Canada 
is on trial for hate speech directed against Jews. From aCBC story on the trial:
</p> 
<blockquote> David Ahenakew's lawyer says the reporter who wrote the newspaper 
article that led to the aboriginal leader being charged with a hate crime 
should have been charged with the same offence.
<p>Doug Christie told court Wednesday that James Parker, a former reporter 
with the Saskatoon StarPhoenix newspaper, knowingly disseminated hate by 
publicizing Ahenakew's anti-Semitic comments.</p> 
<p>&quot;Who distributed the allegedly hateful words?&quot; said Christie, who 
argues that Ahenakew thought he was having a private conversation with Parker 
when he praised Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust.</p> 
<p>&quot;If it had been Dr. Ahenakew, no one else would have heard them other 
than him and Mr. Parker. Mr. Parker had a story that was the best he could hope 
for in his life.&quot;</p> 
<p>Parker covered a conference on aboriginal health in December of 2002, when 
Ahenakew -- a former senator with the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations 
and a member of the Order of Canada -- made a speech in which he blamed Jews 
for starting the Second World War.</p> 
<p>Parker spoke to Ahenakew outside the conference, recording their 
conversation.</p> 
<p>In the interview, which was played in court Monday, Ahenakew referred to 
Jews as &quot;a disease&quot; and said Hitler &quot;made damn sure&quot; Jews 
didn't take over Germany and Europe. &quot;That's why he fried six million of 
those guys,&quot; Ahenakew said.</p> 
<p>The publication of the comments resulted in Ahenakew being charged with the 
wilful promotion of hatred against an identifiable group.<br>
</p> </blockquote>
I'm tempted to say something funny about this, because it's just plain stupid 
legal theorizing on behalf of a difficult-to-defend client (at least according 
to Canadian law), but is it part of the larger trend of attacking journalists 
for their reporting? Kevin Sitesreported a Marine killing a wounded Iraqi and 
was widelybranded a traitor out at the far right end of the blogosphere for it. 
<p></p> 
<p>(I should note, by the way, that I don't agree with Canadian law in this 
regard. Ahenakew's comments were disgusting, but I believe in freedom of speech 
as long as it doesn't directly incite violence against persons, which his words 
don't seem to do. Having said that, Ahenakew is a Canadian citizen and must 
know the laws there.)</p>

<h3>Oh Please Let This Be True</h3> 
<p>From The Digital Bits (via Dark Horizons) comes word on a possible new 
director's cut:</p> 
<blockquote> Oh man... have we got some GREAT news for you <b>Dune</b> fans 
today! We've done some digging with our sources at Universal, and we've learned 
the real reason behind their delay of the<b>Dune: Extended Edition</b> ( 
previously announced for 5/10, but then pulled &quot;indefinitely&quot; with no 
explanation given). Those of you who are familiar with the film know that 
there's a longer version that's been shown on TV, credited to director Alan 
Smithee (a pseudonym used by directors when they want to distance themselves 
from a project for whatever reason). Well get this... after years of saying he 
would never revisit<b>Dune</b>, at the 11th hour director David Lynch 
apparently decided that he might want to be involved in the new DVD after all. 
Which means that when it's eventually released, not only is the DVD going to 
include the original theatrical version of the film... it may also include a 
brand new &quot;director's extended cut&quot; edited by Lynch himself. No 
kidding. [Editor's Note - we've been told by studio sources that this isn't a 
done deal. It IS why the disc was delayed, but Lynch's involvement is still in 
discussion and no work has been started yet. So cross your fingers and let's 
hope it comes to fruition.]</blockquote>The rumor has always been that Lynch's 
first cut of<i>Dune</i> came in around four hours or so -- at least an hour and 
a half longer than the theatrical version. To see that at last would be a real 
treat.
<p>By the way, I'm fully aware that people either hated or loved David Lynch's 
version of<i>Dune</i>, with most of them hating it, so being excited about this 
probably isn't a popular position. While acknowledging the film's flaws -- 
Baron Harkonnen becomes a cartoon character instead of the clever (if 
corpulent) leader he is, for one -- I nevertheless fall into the &quot;loved 
it&quot; category.</p>

<h3>Stewart and Caterina in Newsweek</h3> 
<p>Now the Flickrites are everywhere. From the latest issue of <i>Newsweek</i>,
&quot;Hi-Tech's New Day&quot;:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The new economics of starting a Web business may even be changing the 
entrepreneur's celebrated goal: striking it rich with an IPO. With the market 
for new stocks still flat, many entrepreneurs just want to get scooped up by 
one of the few Internet giants like Yahoo, Google or media mogul Barry Diller's 
AIC/InterActiveCorp. In this respect and many others, the Vancouver-based 
Flickr is typical of the dot-com revival. It's yet another photo-sharing site, 
but with a few nifty innovations: users can tag their photos with keywords, 
adding them to groups of similar shots from other users, and can append 
comments to any picture. More than a year after married founders Stewart 
Butterfield and Caterina Fake started the company, it has drawn more than a 
million users -- without promotional expenses, of course.</p> 
<p>Earlier this year, the couple was close to raising money from top 
venture-capital firm Accel, which would have put their company on a traditional 
track and prepared them, one day, to go public. Instead, this month they sold 
to Yahoo for a rumored $35 million. Integrated into Yahoo, they won't have to 
build human-resource, finance or legal teams. &quot;We'll be taken care of and 
can concentrate on what we like doing best, which is building the 
product,&quot; Butterfield says. And if there's another tech swoon, or if 
another set of hungry entrepreneurs cook up an even better photo-sharing 
mousetrap, Flickr will have Yahoo's might to protect itself.</p> </blockquote>
This is a great answer to the &quot;why sell now?&quot; question.
<p></p> 
<p>My hope and belief is that, two or three years from now, when we look back 
on the Flickr acquisition by Yahoo, it will be seen in a new and even more 
significant light. Yahoo isn't just getting a photo sharing community, or the 
technology that powers it -- they're getting the people who arguably know more 
right now than anyone in the world about creating Web-based ecosystems.</p>

<h3>Webshots vs. Flickr?</h3> 
<p>My friend and general good-guy Robert Scoble had this to say about CNET 
acquiringHeyPix:</p> 
<blockquote> Congrats to James Park. He's president of Windup Labs. That's the 
company that didHeyPix and they just sold to CNET. 
<p>This might just be a bigger photo deal than Flickr going to Yahoo. Here's 
why.</p> 
<p>It's joining Webshots. Now, don't know about Webshots? I didn't either 
until recently. But Webshots has 23 million members (Flickr has less than a 
million). and they get 750,000 uploads a day. More uploads in five days than 
Flickr has had in all of its existence.</p> </blockquote>I have to say, this 
really surprised me. Can Webshots really be that big? I suppose I haven't paid 
much attention to them because they aren't really talked about all that much in 
the blog world:
<p></p> 
<blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Meanwhile, Flickr has been growing at an exponential rate:</p> 
<blockquote> </blockquote>So with all due respect to Robert, this is why the 
Flickr acquisition is far more important.
<p>As for why Flickr is growing so much faster than any other photo sharing 
service on the Web, I'm not the most qualified person to answer that... but I'm 
fairly sure it goes back tosomething I wrote a couple of weeks ago:</p> 
<blockquote> Open API Web services + open data repositories = Web ecosystems 
</blockquote>Flickr is an <i>ecosystem</i>. Is Webshots? Is Ofoto? Is 
Shutterfly?

<h3>Congratulations to UNC</h3> 
<p>I just wanted to say congratulations to the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill men's basketball team, whowon the national championship game last 
night.</p> 
<p>With UNC in the Final Four, I couldn't help but watch their last two games 
-- but I'm not a basketball fan, which makes me a bit of an odd duck in this 
part of the world (the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area, known as the 
&quot;Triangle&quot;). Basketball may not have been invented here, but this has 
to be where the soul of college basketball resides these days. Within a 15-mile 
radius, we have three teams with great basketball histories -- UNC, Duke, and 
North Carolina State. In fact, all three made the Sweet 16 of the NCAA 
tournament this year. When you think that the Triangle has apopulation of about 
1.2 million -- about 0.4 percent of the US as a whole -- that's fairly amazing.

<h3>Coming Together in Hatred</h3> 
<p>From a <i>New York Times</i> story out this past week:</p> 
<blockquote> International gay leaders are planning a 10-day WorldPride 
festival and parade in Jerusalem in August, saying they want to make a 
statement about tolerance and diversity in the Holy City, home to three great 
religious traditions.
<p>Now major leaders of the three faiths -- Christianity, Judaism and Islam -- 
are making a rare show of unity to try to stop the festival. They say the event 
would desecrate the city and convey the erroneous impression that homosexuality 
is acceptable.</p> 
<p>&quot;They are creating a deep and terrible sorrow that is 
unbearable,&quot; Shlomo Amar, Israel's Sephardic chief rabbi, said yesterday 
at a news conference in Jerusalem attended by Israel's two chief rabbis, the 
patriarchs of the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian churches, and 
three senior Muslim prayer leaders. &quot;It hurts all of the religions. We are 
all against it.&quot;</p> 
<p>Abdel Aziz Bukhari, a Sufi sheik, added: &quot;We can't permit anybody to 
come and make the Holy City dirty. This is very ugly and very nasty to have 
these people come to Jerusalem.&quot;...</p> 
<p>Interfaith agreement is unusual in Israel. The leaders' joint opposition 
was initially generated by the Rev. Leo Giovinetti, an evangelical pastor from 
San Diego...</p> 
<p>&quot;That is something new I've never witnessed before, such an attempt to 
globalize bigotry,&quot; said Hagai El-Ad, the executive director of Jerusalem 
Open House, a gay and lesbian group that is the host for the festival. 
&quot;It's quite sad and ironic that these religious figures are coming 
together around such a negative message.&quot; ...</p> 
<p>Mr. Giovinetti circulated a petition against the festival, titled 
&quot;Homosexuals to Desecrate Jerusalem,&quot; which he said had been signed 
by every member of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party in the Israeli Parliament. 
Another American who helped bring together the opposition was Rabbi Yehuda 
Levin, of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, which says it represents more 
than 1,000 American Orthodox rabbis. At the news conference in Jerusalem, he 
called the festival &quot;the spiritual rape of the Holy City.&quot; He said, 
&quot;This is not the homo land, this is the Holy Land.&quot;</p> </blockquote>
So, in other words, the one thing that seems to unite Christianity, Judaism, 
and Islam is hatred and fear of homosexuality. How sad.

<h3>My Favorite Restaurant in Paris</h3> 
<p>This is a snagged picture (because it would be awful to whip out one's 
PowerShot SD300 in a place like this) ofLe Coupe-Chou, my favorite restaurant 
in Paris:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Le Coupe-Chou (&quot;the cut cabbage&quot;) is on a narrow street near the 
Sorbonne. It's in a building that dates (at least parts of it do) to the 1600s. 
Entering it feels a bit like walking into a cave. I was there in the evening, 
and when it's dark, much of the light comes from candles and the fireplace. I 
sat at the table next to the fireplace in the photograph above (thanks to my 
friend Christophe, who made the reservations for me, given that my French 
wasn't quite good enough a couple of months ago).</p> 
<p>The service at Le Coupe-Chou is what I think of as traditionally Parisian: 
polite yet not chatty, unobtrusive yet efficient, and measured in time. The 
food was wonderful. And the prices are quite reasonable: the restaurant offers
<i>prix fixe</i> menus at &euro;24 and &euro;32 (the latter including dessert).
</p> 
<p>Le Coupe-Chou can be found at:</p> 
<blockquote> Le Coupe-Chou <br>
9 rue de Lanneau <br>
75005 Paris <br>
Tel: 01 
46 33 68 69</blockquote>Highly recommended.
