<h2>Nikon Coolpix L110 review - Performance</h2> 
<p>In use the Nikon Coolpix L110 feels good in the hand and the zoom control 
is smooth. However, some of the buttons can lack responsiveness and needed a 
slightly firmer or secondary push before producing the desired result on some 
occasions.</p> 
<p>The primary purpose of the L110 is, of course, being a superzoom and 
utilising that 15x optical zoom which extends smoothly and with a regular pace. 
At the longest end the 420mm holds fairly steadily and, while optical 
stabilisation would have been an advantage here to further steady &lsquo;live' 
during framing, the sensor-shift stabilisation helps provide further assurance 
of a sharper image capture. &nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Low-light situations add the benefit of an AF-assist lamp which includes 
the option to turn it off should this be undesireable.</p> 
<p>The 3in LCD screen to the rear is of good quality, though is overly-bright 
when compared to viewing images on a computer screen - so much so that the 
former makes some image areas appear overexposed when they're not. The jpegs 
have more highlight detail than is apparent on the LCD screen, which can make 
for some difficulty in providing accurate exposure. Also there is no viewfinder 
as per some competitors' superzoom compacts, so no other way to conceive taking 
an image when in bright sunlight. The L110 screen does have an anti-reflective 
coating that helps but isn't foolproof.</p> 
<p>The L110 has a macro mode that works up to 1cm from the camera's lens, 
though only at the wide end will it focus correctly as expected.</p> 
<p>Power comes in the form of 4xAA batteries - some may love it, others may 
hate it; in fact it may be the reason to buy or not to buy. One slight whinge 
is that the SD card is inserted in the same compartment as the batteries, yet 
the batteries aren't secured like many li-ion batteries would be. If the 
camera's upside down this isn't an issue, but the batteries can slide around or 
fall out when open, so the SD would have been better placed in its own area.</p>
<p>Easy Auto mode works as expected and is essentially an advanced automated 
option that auto-selects the best available settings for the scene at hand. For 
more control there's the Auto mode which allows user-defined White Balance and 
ISO settings. The L110 also has &lsquo;Color Options' to change shooting styles 
from Standard to Vivid, B&amp;W, Sepia or Cyanotype too.</p>

<p>I just got this camera, and I could do with going to see my doctor. It's a 
horrible camera, bad pictures in just about ever indoor setting with or without 
flash, the HD footage is a joke, the large screen fools you, did some footage 
under normal lights looked fantastic on the small screen on the camera, but 
once home it was on my pc I noticed it was very very grainy. The zoom is a 
joke, most large zooms offer some sort if speed control for finer zooming. This 
one on or off there is no slow zoom just fast. On HD footage the zoom is very 
slow and even at the slow speed it still has problems on the focus side of 
things I really wish I had kept my Canon S2 IS</p> <br>

<p>Bought it, played with it,... sure, few manual controls, but do leave the 
DSLR back in the car and get great results for point and shoot with this 
Nikon.Not a pro piece of kit but its terrific for the money and all that most 
amatuer punters will ever want.Trust the Auto</p> <br>

<p>Agree that the image quality is the biggest let down of this camera. And 
yet, it does offer 28-420mm equiv for &pound;200 and you'd be hard pressed to 
find that anywhere else. If the image quality was improved then this would be 
recommended. As it stands it's just short of the mark.</p> <br>

<p> This camera does a great job. read the manual and follow the mfg. 
directions before you write negative reviews!</p> <br>

<p>@ Chris Tomkin I have been Using Canon powershots for years But the wife 
treated me to this camera and its just about full auto on every thing. It is a 
bad camera and even my 10 year olds Son's Fuji z10fd takes better 
pictures...almost</p> <br>

<p>for an everyday camera I think its great its not a professional camera but 
you get what you pay for and I find the zoom and quality fine - pictures are 
good and for the price you are not going to get better!</p> <br>

<p>Can anyone suggest a site where i can see &quot;the bad or the good&quot; 
pictures taken by this Nikon L110 camera and not Photoshop corrected ! , I have 
been using Canon Film SLR Cameras and my first digital camera is still Fuji 2MP 
203, many of my friends have Canon digital cameras and no doubt very good 
quality, I need AA batteries &quot;a must have&quot; , a nice view finder, 8 to 
14 MP and Manual mode option with a price range up to 200$ camera, I know 
Canon's G11 is a great camera but I'm not willing to spend on that,I'm saving 
for another Canon lens, anybody ... ?</p> <br>

<p>I bought one and took it back within a week. Useless in low light and can't 
shoot a moving subject. Unreliable too: sometimes it focuses, sometimes it 
doesn't; sometimes it fires, sometimes it doesn't; sometimes the flash fires, 
sometimes it doesn't. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</p> <br>

<p>coolpix L110 is not professinal camera.shows poor perfomance in low light 
thogh it has an ISO ranging from 80-6400.No manual mode,shutter speed and 
aperture cannot be set manually.Its a better camera for portrait photos!</p>

<p>I bought htis Camera, but its poor performance in low light, absence of 
view finder, misleading monitor which gives false rendition of photos 
taken,absolutely poor picture quality,video mode that is no good in low 
light...the list is endless. I regret the decision to buy it - got taken in by 
the NIKON name.Earlier Canon Powershot A550 is way better in all aspects.</p>

<p>I came from Canon to Nikon but due to a limited budget, as article stands 
is a good deal for the money. Lacks of dial control that Canon has as standard. 
I hate a yellowish tone on tungsten and that too bright display but just have 
to set it lower and it's done. Love 4 AA Bats, chaeper, easier to charge and 
last a very good time. Some dumb when you need fast shooting, sometimes you get 
some lag that make you miss nice shots. Sports mode have a lot of noise not 
compared to cheaper Canon's. It's macro is a bit disappointing but zoom is 
great even on digital range. I thought IS should work better a night w/o flash 
but it doesn't make better than my older Canon or higher ISO should help more. 
I use 3200 but is noisy. At the end i need to save some money to get a better 
Canon cause this one is a good one but not the one i need. By the way my older 
is an A560.</p> <br>

<p>We cannot make this camera work as we think it should and are more than 
disappointed with it! Eats batteries. Way to slow to get good pictures.</p> <br>

<p>The camera at first was not getting good shots - but a quick read of the 
manual and all was well. Awesome camera - those that complain should really 
read the f* manual first</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>November 30 18:15</h4> 
<h4>Yura</h4> <br>

<p>I'm not a pro, but I think it's a really good camera. At first, I thought 
that it wasn't a good choice, but after I played a little with the settings and 
read the manual, it started to be nice. Of course, I don't think that the 
quality of the image is really good, but it's ok how it is. It's easy to use 
and it's kinda cute xD</p> <br>

<p>im gonna get one later...i hope i made the right choice..</p> <br>

<p>got this camera a couple of months ago had some trouble a first but after a 
couple of sessions with the manual all is well also i think that the battery 
life is pretty good</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>May 15 19:16</h4> 
<h4>Simon</h4> <br>

<p>I thought the picture quality indoors was pretty poor but excellent 
outdoor. I was going to sell the camera but after reading the comments above I 
think i should read the manual and stop being a bloke.</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>May 16 18:04</h4> 
<h4>Debbie Collins</h4> <br>

<p>Well, I have read the manual - but the indoor pics are terrible - any 
suggestions?</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>July 16 03:54</h4>

<p>go with &quot;indoor party&quot; on the scene mode to take quality pics 
indoors.I did a wedding using &quot;portrait &quot; setting and it was a big 
mistake then experimented with different scenes and &quot;indoor party&quot; 
were clear and crisp.</p> <br>

<h4>Unhappy with Nikon</h4> <br>

<p>I really like this camera for the range that it falls into. BUT, after two 
repair send offs. video still jerky and sound is awful for any type of live 
music. A concert? Forget it. Nikons website is user unfriendly and their 
customer service is the same it seems. Gave up trying to find access.</p> <br>

<p>After living with the L110 for just under a year, I am pleased with the 
purchase, which in the main, does a good job. particular Praise for the movie 
mode with the exception of a certain fuzziness at full zoom, other than that, 
sound and picture quality are fine. Easy to use and navigate, the camera mode 
menu caters for most situations and image quality is fine, although a tripod is 
best employed in some situations. I would have liked to see the lens barrel 
screwed to enable a hood and to enable the lens cap fitted in, (so protecting 
the lens whilst in standby). In conclusion, I'd reckon it value for money.</p>
