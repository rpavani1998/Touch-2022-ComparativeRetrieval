<p><strong>SPEED / TIMING</strong><br>
 Speed and timing tests on the Canon 
EOS 5D and the Nikon D200 were conducted using a 1GB SanDisk Extreme III 
CompactFlash card and fully charged batteries.<br>
<br>
<strong>Start-up to 
First Shot</strong><em> (Advantage: Nikon D200) <br>
</em>Both the 5D and the 
D200 start up very quickly &ndash; they got their first shots off within 1/5 of 
a second of the camera being turned on. The 5D took 0.19 seconds and the D200 
made an exposure after 0.16 seconds.<br>
<br>
<strong>Shot to Shot</strong> <em>
(Advantage: Nikon D200)<br>
</em>The D200 has a clear advantage in this 
category, with a 5 frame-per-second burst mode. The 5D manages only 3 frames 
per second. However, the 5D managed 71 JPEGs in a burst, while the D200 petered 
out after 30 JPEGs. The 5D finished writing those 71 images 21.62 seconds after 
the last one was shot, while the D200 took 25.16 seconds to write its 30 files.
<br> <br>
 The Canon's writing performance is impressive and a real testament 
to the power of the DIGIC II processor. Considering that the 5D's files have 
almost 30 percent more pixels than D200&rsquo;s files, it's clear that the 5D 
has the more impressive architecture &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a shame that the 
capture rate isn&rsquo;t a bit faster.<br>
<br>
 Still, there are many 
circumstances where shooting 30 frames in 6 seconds will get a shot that 
shooting 71 frames in 24 seconds will not &ndash; in sports and action 
photography, speed is the thing.</p> 
<p><strong>Shutter to Shot</strong><em> (Advantage: Canon EOS 5D) <br>
</em>We 
measured very little shutter lag in either the 5D or the D200. The 5D rated a 
0.01-second delay and the D200 waited 0.03 seconds. Neither delay ought to be 
significant in practice.<br>
<br>
<strong>Resolution</strong><em> (Advantage: 
Canon EOS 5D)<br>
</em>On our single camera reviews, we traditionally test each 
camera&rsquo;s resolution by collecting a sequence of images of an ISO 12233 
resolution chart at various aperture settings and focal lengths and importing 
the results into Imatest imaging software. Imatest reads the uploaded images 
and reports sharpness results in line widths per picture height (lw/ph). LW/PH 
is similar to lp/ph, the conventional unit of measuring resolution; however, 
lw/ph takes the size of the recording medium into account.<br>
<br>
 Having 
conducted full individual reviews on both the Nikon D200 and Canon EOS 5D, our 
typical full-chart resolution results can be found here:Nikon D200 / Canon EOS 
5D. <br>
<br>
 For this Head-to-Head review, we evaluated the sharpness of the 
two DSLRs with standard 50mm f/1.4 prime lenses on both models.<br>
<br>
 A 
common argument in favor of APS-sized sensors over full-frame chips is that 
they have the potential to retain better edge-to-edge sharpness because they 
read from a cropped segment in the center of the chip rather than the full 
space of the sensor. To test the validity of this claim as it relates to the 
12.8 megapixel 5D and 10.2 megapixel D200, we fitted each model with a standard 
50mm f/1.4 prime lens and took our resolution readings from the lower left and 
upper right portions of the recorded frames. The shots were taken without any 
in-camera sharpening, shooting the D200 in Normal and the Canon EOS 5D in 
Neutral Parameters. Both cameras were tested at ISO 100 with the lenses fully 
open to f/1.4, as well as with them stopped down to f/8. Unfortunately, with 
the D200&rsquo;s 1.5X magnification conversion, it was necessary to move the 
tripod slightly to retain equal compositions.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As you can see from the graph above, the additional 2.6 million pixels 
spread across the Canon 5D&rsquo;s full-frame CMOS sensor did yield better 
resolution results. However, the results are quite close with both lenses open 
all the way. At f/1.4, the additional pixels on the 5D gave the camera a slight 
advantage, although comparatively, it is far less of an edge than you might 
expect from the sensor differential. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the 5D 
performs in the same manner as most digital cameras, with stronger horizontal 
resolution, while the D200 by contrast exhibits greater resolution in the 
vertical direction with the standard 50mm lens wide open.</p> 
<p>When both prime lenses were stopped down to f/8, the 5D&rsquo;s performance 
edge became more pronounced and for the most part, resolution was more 
consistent on both cameras both vertically and horizontally. At f/8, sharpness 
was much more in line with expectations, relative to the cameras&rsquo; 
respective resolutions. Corner-to-corner sharpness on the Canon EOS 5D 
supported the claims of full-frame advocates and at least in this instance, 
refuted the argument for utilizing the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of the sensor on 
an APS DSLR.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The 5D does in fact offer more edge-to-edge resolution than the D200, and 
the difference is not just academic. While the results plotted in the charts 
above may appear as an insignificant difference between the 10.2 megapixel D200 
and the 12.8 megapixel EOS 5D, when observing 8 x 10-inch prints made from each 
camera &ndash; held roughly a foot away &ndash; the difference is clearly 
noticeable. The 5D produces sharper images with more observable detail, even at 
8 x 10. The results obviously become more pronounced as the print size is 
increased.<br>
<br>
 With the prime lenses, we also took a few shots of the ISO 
resolution chart, fully framed to its proper 3:2 markings, using the 
cameras&rsquo; out-of-the-box defaults. The overall resolution results here are 
much more imbalanced. As you can see from the Imatest results below, the Canon 
EOS 5D is much sharper in both directions than the D200. Although much of this 
discrepancy can be attributed to stronger in-camera sharpening on the Canon, 
neither image holds up to much sharpening post-capture.</p>

<p><strong>Color Fringing: Canon and Nikon 50mm f/1.4 Lenses</strong> <em>
(Advantage: Canon EOS 5D)<br>
</em>We tested the Canon EOS 5D and the Nikon 
D200 with a couple of lenses each. We had access to the Canon 24-105mm f/4L IS 
USM, and the Nikon AF-S VR 24-120mm f/3.5-5.6, which are both high-quality, 
versatile zooms. For a closer comparison, we looked at both manufacturers' 50mm 
f/1.4 prime lenses.<br>
<br>
 Both companies have been making that lens for 
decades. And they have made thousands upon thousands of them: 50mm f/1.4 used 
to be a common kit lens with film SLRs. We expected the lenses to be sharp, and 
they were. Distortion wasn't a problem, either. We were surprised by the extent 
to which they both exhibited color fringing, though. Even at f/8.0, our 
standard aperture for dynamic range testing, both lenses showed obvious 
fringing. Here are 200% crops of the sides &ndash; not the corners, but closer 
in, on the sides, from both lenses. These are shots from our dynamic range 
test, which conceivably creates a situation that is most vulnerable to fringing.
<br> </p> 
<p><br>
<em>EOS 5D</em></p> 
<p><em><br>
 D200</em></p> 
<p>The shots taken with the D200 show a more distracting degree of fringing, 
however, the artifacts were visible with both cameras. The fringing apparent in 
the shots recorded with the 5D and the 50mm lens showed fringing skewed to one 
side of the shapes, while the numbers on the chart recorded by the D200 were 
overpowered by discoloration on both sides of the figures.<br>
<br>
 It's 
disappointing to see the color problem in lenses that cost hundreds of dollars. 
We did not have an opportunity to print these images ourselves; however, 
well-made 8 x 10-inch prints would likely show the fringing effects. The f/1.4 
lenses are appropriate in low light, but for ideal image quality, they aren't 
nearly as good as Nikon and Canon's macro lenses.<br>
<br>
<strong>Color
</strong> <em>(Advantage: Draw) <br>
</em>Our typical color tests for 
individual camera reviews are conducted in controlled studio conditions using a 
GretagMacbeth color chart and Lowell Softboxes with tungsten bulbs. (If you 
wish to view individual color results for either camera, click here: Nikon D200 
/ Canon 5D.) We attempted to replicate our studio tests outdoors, using 
daylight illumination to examine the cameras&rsquo; exterior color 
capabilities. Both cameras were tested for saturation and color accuracy at 
each available ISO setting using their most natural color modes. For the EOS 
5D, we shot the daylight sequence in its Neutral parameter, while the D200 was 
shot in its default, Color Mode I.<br>
<br>
 The graph below is a visual 
representation of our results, with data for the Nikon D200 in shades of red 
and data for the Canon 5D in shades of blue. The red and blue bars represent 
the saturation percentage points away from 100 percent for the D200 and 5D, 
respectively, and the plotted points represent the color error score. The error 
scores are not in percentage points, but we place these plots atop this graph 
to let you see all the data at once. The closer the saturation percentage to 0 
(or 100), the more accurate the saturation; the closer the color error score to 
zero, the more accurate the color.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>We found the D200&rsquo;s colors to be much more saturated straight out of 
the camera. These slightly embellished tones should produce a more 
&quot;consumer-friendly&quot; appearance without any post-processing. The 
5D&rsquo;s colors, on the other hand, were a bit under-saturated when using the 
Neutral parameter (although that jumped to roughly 6-8% over-saturation when 
using the Standard parameter) yet maintained a greater degree of accuracy 
throughout the ISO range. The tones produced by the D200 had a greater mean 
color error and displayed more variance at the extremes of the sensitivity 
range.<br>
<br>
 However, when we switched the 5D into its Standard parameter, 
we noticed the camera tended to blow out single channels of color, while the 
D200 retained detail, albeit with contaminated color.<br>
<br>
 We shot a still 
life of some flowers and opened the images in Photoshop, then broke them down 
into their individual channels to see the color information in each one.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;Finally, here's the D200's red channel from a similar crop: </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The switch from Neutral (or Faithful) on the 5D will yield bolder colors 
straight out of the camera, although it comes at the expense of information. 
The D200, in both Color Mode I and Color Mode II, offers more detail in the 
individual channels and is much more editable. However, you'll notice in the 
image above, the D200 shifts the purple hue in the violet flower over to a more 
bluish tone (more cyan than purple). The D200 had a lot of trouble rendering 
this particular shade. The 5D's reproduction of the violet flower, on the other 
hand, is much closer to the flower's natural color.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 To utilize 
all the detail the EOS 5D is capable of capturing, the camera must be set to 
RAW and colors must be realized in post-processing. The D200, by contrast, 
processes JPEGs more favorably with more careful attention paid to the 
individual channels.<br>
<br>
<strong>Noise / High ISO Performance</strong> <em>
(Advantage: Canon EOS 5D)<br>
</em>The D200 performed admirably at low ISO 
settings, staying with the Canon 5D in terms of noise, color, and dynamic 
range. However, at higher ISO settings &ndash; ISO 400 and beyond &ndash; the 
5D began to pull away and justify its much steeper price tag.<br>
<br>
 To test 
the cameras&rsquo; performance at high sensitivities, we shot a succession of 
exterior images, gradually increasing in ISO. We utilized the noise results 
attained in our outdoor color tests (garnered with a GretagMacbeth color chart 
and Imatest imaging software) and plotted those results in the graph below.<br>

<br> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As much of our other test results concluded, the D200 remains close to the 
5D at ISO 400, with only moderate noise resulting from each camera. By ISO 500 
and 640, the 5D&rsquo;s slight advantage increases significantly and the 
benefits of the full frame CMOS sensor become apparent. As you can see in the 
chart above, the 5D&rsquo;s individual noise progression increases steadily, 
with the only drastic leap occurring from ISO 1600 to 3200, which is also a 
jump into the camera&rsquo;s &quot;ISO Expansion.&quot; This is unfortunately 
not the case with the D200. The Nikon&rsquo;s noise graph takes on more of a 
stair-step-like pattern, displaying its first jump in noise from ISO 500 to ISO 
640 and increasing almost exponentially at each step beyond. At ISO 1000, the 
cameras are in different classes. Images from the D200 are flat and lack the 
detail recorded in shots at half the sensitivity. The 5D also shows a slight 
drop in image quality, but still retains the quality characteristics that make 
the camera&rsquo;s images desirable.<br>
<br>
 Shots at higher ISO settings 
with the 5D contain less noise and more detail, but also show much smoother 
tonal transitions, which result in far more depth in the images. The 5D is also 
able to retain color accuracy while ISO is increased. This is unusual for most 
DSLRs, as shots at high ISOs generally lose some saturation and begin to appear 
somewhat washed, as is the case with the D200.<br>
<br>
 To&nbsp;help validate 
these results, along with illustrate the impact of&nbsp;noise reduction on each 
of the cameras,&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve included a series of night scenes below.<br>

<br> <strong>Long Exposures / Noise Reduction</strong> <em>(Advantage: Canon 
EOS 5D)<br>
</em>Electronic sensors build up noise during long exposures, and 
both the Nikon D200 and the Canon EOS 5D offer separate long exposure noise 
reduction settings. We tested noise reduction throughout each camera&rsquo;s 
ISO range and with exposures of up to 30 seconds. In general, we found that the 
D200 images were noisier. The Nikon noise reduction was more likely to make a 
visible difference in the image, but the result was still inferior to images 
shot at similar exposures with the 5D. The 5D's images started out less noisy 
and more detailed than the D200's &ndash; even with noise reduction, the D200 
couldn't catch up.<br>
<br>

<p><br>
<em>D200 - ISO800, NR-ON</em></p> 
<p>Both cameras built up noise most severely in the blue channel, which is 
typical of digital cameras, and it is easiest to see the effects of noise 
reduction in the blue channel as well. We have included a few samples to show 
what we saw: the D200 at ISO 3200, with and without sharpening, shows very 
prominent noise. Without noise reduction, the noise shows a 
&quot;pinpoint&quot; effect, with individual pixels apparently jumping and 
dropping significantly; with noise reduction on, the noise is more diffuse, 
decreasing detail and lowering contrast.</p> 
<p><br>

 D200 - ISO3200, NR-OFF</p> 
<p><br>
<em>D200 - ISO3200, NR-ON</em></p> </em> 
<p>The effect is harder to see in images from the 5D. Looking at blue-channel 
samples from the ISO 1000 shot, it would be hard to guess which is 
noise-reduced and which is not &ndash; they aren't as noisy as the D200 images, 
but noise reduction didn't seem to do much good.<br>
<br>
 We also ran some 
tests in our lab to provide some quantitative data on the cameras&rsquo; 
performance during prolonged exposures. The low light shots were captured in a 
studio setup, with the cameras set to ISO 1600 and with long exposure noise 
reduction engaged. The D200 was set to Normal Long Exposure NR, while the 
5D&rsquo;s Long Exposure NR was turned &quot;On.&quot;<br>
<br>
 The chart 
below shows our results. The horizontal axis indicates the exposure duration, 
while the vertical axis displays the corresponding noise at each exposure.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Although the D200 starts out far noisier than the 5D at 1.5 seconds, noise 
also increases more drastically on the D200 as exposures are extended. The 5D 
maintains a relatively constant line from 2 to 30 seconds; more noise enters 
the images at about 20 seconds, but it is not a drastic increase. We 
unfortunately did not have an opportunity to make any extreme long exposures 
(30 minutes or longer), though we suspect at some point the compounded heat in 
the 5D would lead to a more substantial increase in noise. However, at 30 
seconds or less, the 5D manages noise much more effectively than the D200.</p> 
<p>We have also included full shots from&nbsp;each camera, shot at ISO 1600 
with noise reduction OFF. These images are not magnified.</p>

</p> 
<p><strong>Dynamic Range </strong><em>(Advantage: Canon EOS 5D) <br>
</em>We 
tested dynamic range on both cameras using Imatest software, the same testing 
suite we use for color and resolution. To conduct the test, we shot a Stouffer 
4110 transmissive step chart on a light box. The chart is a strip of 
silver-based film, with a row of 40 progressively darker rectangles. The 
darkest rectangle is more than 13 stops darker than the lightest. We shoot the 
chart such that the brightest box is a pure white.<br>
<br>
 We feed the 
cameras' images into Imatest software, which measures the number of rectangles 
that can be distinguished in each image. That's a little more complicated than 
it sounds, because noise levels rise significantly in the dark rectangles. 
Imatest can detect steps of dynamic range even when the noise level would 
overwhelm picture information. To generate results that are relevant to 
real-world photography, Imatest provides separate ratings for overall dynamic 
range, and for dynamic range within certain noise ranges. For instance, at ISO 
100, the Nikon D200 detected 12.2 stops of dynamic range, but recorded only 
7.79 stops at Imatest's High Quality level. High Quality indicates that image 
noise was under 1/10 of a stop. The total range includes areas with more than 1 
full stop of noise. At Low Quality, with up to one stop of noise, the D200 
distinguished nearly 11 stops of dynamic range at ISO 100 &ndash; a higher 
score than the 5D, which came in around 10.5 stops. The low-quality rating is 
less important than high quality, because a full stop of noise pretty much 
overwhelms visible data.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The test concluded that the Canon 5D delivers better dynamic range than the 
Nikon D200, which is not entirely surprising considering the 5D's full-frame 
sensor has larger photo sites. This should yield better noise results and more 
dynamic range anyway. What's remarkable is how marginal the Canon's advantage 
is at low ISO settings &ndash; for High Quality, the two cameras' results are 
virtually the same at ISO 100. However, as the ISO is pushed, the cameras begin 
to part ways. Canon does a bit better than Nikon at ISO 200, delivering 0.58 
more stops. At 400, the 5D scores 0.86 stops better than the D200, and at 800, 
the 5D's advantage jumps to 1.77 stops. At 1600, the Nikon's noise does it in, 
and the D200 delivers under 4 stops, giving the 5D a 2.32-stop advantage. At 
the highest settings, noise jumps for the Canon as well, though it maintains a 
nearly-one-stop margin.<br>
<br>
 There is an important point to remember about 
these figures: we present them as a means of comparing cameras, not as an 
absolute guide to the range that users will achieve in normal shooting. The 
numbers we're presenting represent an absolute best-case scenario, and are much 
wider than users should expect when making a natural-looking print of a typical 
scene.<br>
<br>
 Therefore, we shot some still life settings with both cameras 
as well to look at how they handle highlights, very saturated color and shadow 
areas. We wanted to see how dynamic range performance plays out when the 
cameras aren't pointed at step wedges.<br>
<br>
 We put some flowers and a 
linen tester on a sheet of typing paper and shot a series of exposures, with 
the goal of getting the paper to look clean and white, while keeping color and 
detail in the flowers and the pale shadows they cast. There are a couple of 
challenges in this scene: first, the background starts looking very dingy when 
it's underexposed, but the shadows get ragged if it's too bright; and second, 
the bright red and purple flowers can saturate single channels.<br>
<br>
 We 
bracketed by 1/3 stops, and found something disappointing &ndash; the D200 
jumped from a bit too dark to too light in 1/3 of a stop. The 5D's highlights 
didn't blow out as much in a single step. To illustrate the difference, we've 
imitated the highlight warning feature on many cameras, and turned the blown 
out areas black on our sample pictures. The white areas in the 5D images 
maintain more texture than the D200&rsquo;s images<br>
<br>
 D200 darker:&nbsp;
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>D200 lighter:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>EOS 5D darker:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>EOS 5D lighter:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The prints we made of the lighter 5D image had much more pleasing whites 
than the D200 images &ndash; there is texture even in the lightest parts, while 
the lighter D200 image is blown out. The faint texture in the 5D's whites 
really doesn't make the image look darker, but it helps the camera deliver 
smooth transitions from the pale shadows to the whites. It's very hard to move 
from any color to pure white, and in our D200 shots, the edges of the shadows 
are ragged. We saw the problem in both ISO 100 and 400 shots.<br>
<br>
<strong>
White Balance</strong> <em>(Advantage: Nikon D200) <br>
</em>The D200 and the 
5D handle white balance about as flexibly as any camera out there. Both offer 
several presets, plus custom settings and direct Kelvin input. Furthermore, 
both cameras offer fine-tuning, which is the feature that most distinguishes 
their white balance systems. The 5D has Canon's unique two-axis fine-tune 
mechanism, which allows color shifts on both a blue-amber axis and a 
green-magenta axis. The D200 adjusts only along the Kelvin scale &ndash; a 
&quot;warm to cool&quot; axis that is the industry standard. Plotting the 
Kelvin axis on Canon's Blue-amber/Green-magenta chart would be simple: Kelvin 
runs diagonally between Canon's axes.<br>
<br>
 Canon's custom white balance 
picks up white readings from regular saved images, rather than from dedicated 
readings, as the D200 does. In practice, there isn't much difference between 
the two systems, but a user could theoretically save many, many images on the 
5D from which to select white balance readings, while the D200 saves just four 
custom white balance settings.<br>
<br>
 Both the D200 and 5D allow white 
balance bracketing. Both allow the user to set the bracket increment, and the 
5D allows the user to set the axis on which it brackets.<br>
<br>
 The 
difference here again lies in the degree of control afforded by one camera and 
not the other. While both cameras offer significant customization of color 
calibration in-camera, the Canon 5D goes a bit beyond and adds a degree of 
control not present on the D200. While many shooters may disregard the flexible 
four-directional white balance fine-tune on the 5D - preferring to render these 
adjustments post-capture - the ability to store an unlimited number of white 
presets (determined by the capacity of the memory card) may aid the efficiency 
of those shooters working in multi-light studio setups.</p> 
<p>While the Canon offers more flexibility in terms of color calibration, 5D 
users will unfortunately need it. In practice, the 5D&rsquo;s Auto and preset 
white balance settings did not prove to be nearly as accurate as the 
D200&rsquo;s. We tested the color balance of both cameras under three types of 
lighting: daylight, tungsten, and fluorescent. Daylight tests were conducted 
using the cameras&rsquo; Auto WB setting, as well as their Daylight preset. 
Tungsten and Fluorescent white balance tests were administered using the 
cameras&rsquo; designated preset settings.<br>
<br>
 We shot the GretagMacbeth 
color chart under the three types of illumination and ran the results through 
Imatest Imaging Software. The software exaggerates the white balance error to 
help observe the color bias. As you can see in the charts below, the D200 and 
5D both shift colors similarly, however, in all three setups the variances in 
the 5D images were much more pronounced.<br>

<strong>Portrait</strong> <em>(Advantage: Canon EOS 5D) <br>
</em>
Images of people are a mainstay of digital photography, for both professional 
and amateur photographers, so we think it's useful to directly compare how the 
5D and D200 stack up taking portraits. We shot portraits in a number of 
situations with the D200 and 5D, but to create the particular images 
specifically discussed in this section, we photographed one of our staff by 
window light with each camera on a tripod. We took custom white balance 
readings with each camera and bracketed exposure by 1/3-stops. Because both 
cameras offer Portrait image presets, we shot the cameras in Portrait at ISO 
100 and in their default parameters at both 100 and 400. For Nikon, that's 
Normal mode, and for Canon it's Standard. Because Nikon's &quot;Normal&quot; 
and Canon's &quot;Standard&quot; differ considerably, we also shot the Canon in 
&quot;Neutral,&quot; which we find closer to Nikon's Normal, and more useful 
for general photography. All images were shot as JPEGs.<br>
<br>
 The D200's 
images look best at exposures about 1/3 EV above the metered reading. The 5D 
looks best at its metered value. For what it's worth, the cameras' meters agree.
<br> <br>
 Our preferred image from the Canon 5D was the one shot on Neutral at 
ISO 100, without exposure compensation. The transitions from midtones to 
highlights are smooth, and the highlights retain detail. The color is natural 
from highlight to shadow. The detail drops off smoothly in the shadows &ndash; 
though it drops off sooner than in the D200 images.</p> 
<p><em>Click on any of the&nbsp;portraits below to view the full resolution

<p><br>
<em>EOS 5D - Neutral, ISO 100</em></p> 
<p><em><br>
 D200 - Normal, ISO 100</em></p> 
<p>The best shot from the Nikon D200 was shot at Normal, ISO 100, 1/3 stop 
above the metered reading. Seen by itself, the Nikon image looks good, but it 
suffers in comparison with the Canon. Color gradients are less smooth: while 
the Canon shot shows steady transitions of tone and hue across the 
subject&rsquo;s expansive forehead, the Nikon shot looks more patchy as one's 
eye moves from the highlights on the brow and the center of the forehead, to 
the pinker area above the left eye, to the darker area of his temple. The 
highlight area itself turns cool gray in the Nikon image, while its color 
remains warmer and more skin-like in the Canon shot. The Nikon handled the 
darkest tones very well &ndash; it shows more detail in the black sweater than 
the 5D does.<br>
<br>
 Consistent with our other testing, we found that the 
D200's performance deteriorated much more at ISO 400 than the 5D. At ISO 400, 
the D200's colors were less saturated and the gradients were rougher. The 5D's 
performance held up much better &ndash; though for portraits, we'd shoot each 
camera at the lowest practical ISO.</p> 
<p><br>
<em>EOS 5D - Neutral, ISO 400</em></p> 
<p><em><br>
 D200 - Normal, ISO 400</em></p> 
<p>The reasons to not use Canon's Standard setting are nowhere more apparent 
than in a portrait. Standard boosts contrast and sharpens the image more than 
is kind in human portraiture. The creases and textures one observes in the 
Neutral shot turn unambiguously into wrinkles and blemishes in Standard.</p> 
<p><br>
<em>EOS 5D - Portrait, ISO 100</em></p> 
<p><em><br>
 D200 - Portrait, ISO 100</em></p> 
<p>It's more puzzling to contemplate the cameras' specific Portrait modes. We 
don't recommend either of them. Nikon's is more straightforward: it decreases 
contrast and saturation, and opens up the shadow detail. The changes don't 
improve highlight detail or transitions, though, and left the image flat. 
Canon's Portrait mode increases contrast in our test and decreases yellow in 
the skin tones. The result is awful &ndash; magenta-pink cheeks with highlights 
the cold white of skim milk. We definitely found the results unappealing. The 
best way to get the benefits that a Portrait mode promises is through 
post-processing RAW files. We don't present manipulated RAW files in this 
review because that would be a test of image editing rather than the cameras, 
but for perfectly smooth color, rosy cheeks and open, detailed shadows, we'd 
suggest shooting in the mode that preserves as much image data as is practical 
and editing the images on a computer. Each shooting situation is unique, and a 
single Portrait mode can't address the range of variables a photographer is 
likely to see.<br>
<br>
<strong>Image Parameters</strong><em> (Advantage: Canon 
EOS 5D)<br>
</em>Canon and Nikon have taken different approaches to image 
parameters, which Canon calls &quot;Picture Styles&quot; and Nikon calls image 
optimization presets. Nikon's presets have a lot in common with the typical 
ones on compact digital cameras. The names would be recognizable to most 
novices: Normal, Portrait, Vivid, Vivid Plus and Softer. The effects themselves 
make big changes in images. Vivid and Vivid Plus punch up the colors so much 
that images shot on those settings really can't hold up to post-processing, 
while Portrait and Softer tone down colors a similar amount. The D200 accepts 
tone curves downloaded from Nikon Capture 4, PC software that Nikon 
magnanimously sells separately from its cameras.</p> 
<p>The 5D's Standard default parameter boosts saturation and sharpens the 
image more than Nikon's Normal setting. Canon's Landscape, like Nikon's Vivid 
and Vivid Plus, can over-saturate bold colors in blue skies, flowers and 
foliage. However, the Neutral and Faithful picture styles are more practical. 
Neutral images don't show the saturation boost or sharpening that Standard 
images do.&nbsp;In this mode the&nbsp;5D&nbsp;produces images that match the 
output of the Canon EOS 1D Mark II and Mark II n, and the company suggests that 
photographers shooting with both a 1D Mark II and 5D can get matched color 
across bodies. This offers a practical advantage for those shooters who pack 
both an EOS 5D and 1D Mk II n in their bag &ndash; the 5D for resolution and 
the 1D Mk II n for speed. The 5D&rsquo;s Faithful parameter is essentially the 
same as its Neutral setting, although it&rsquo;s calibrated for accurate 
results under 5200 Kelvin lighting &ndash; an assistance to studio 
photographers. Both Neutral and Faithful parameters produce images that can 
handle post-processing.</p>

<p><br>
<em>D200</em></p> 
<p><em><br>

<p>However, in terms of default parameters, Nikon's Normal setting is much 
less hyped up than Canon's Standard. The D200's Normal images look less 
sharpened and maintain more detail in all three color channels, even in areas 
of bold color, than the 5D's Standard. Most users, and particularly ones who 
adjust their JPEGs, will keep the D200 in Normal. On the 5D, we expect that 
Neutral or Faithful settings will be more useful than Standard, especially as a 
starting point for image-processing.</p> <br>

<p></p> <em></em> 
<p>Of course, the 5D and the D200 are cameras meant for delivering top-quality 
prints. For many photographers, that means shooting RAW, which makes parameters 
pretty much irrelevant &ndash; the presents might as well be on the user's 
computer in the RAW converter, rather than in the camera, because the RAW file 
preserves the original shooting data and the shooting parameters can be 
reversed or adjusted in conversion.<br>
<br>
<strong>Banding &ndash; Nikon D200 
</strong><br>
 The D200 can produce image artifacts when significant areas of 
the frame are substantially overexposed. The banding appears as a repeating 
pattern of vertical lines and is most pronounced at ISO 400, though it remains 
visible at other sensitivity settings as well. Nikon acknowledges the banding 
problem, but the company says it does not affect every D200. D200 owners who 
see lines in their files can send a sample image to Nikon Technical Support. 
Once Nikon technicians establish that a given camera has the problem, they 
authorize the owner to send it in for a free adjustment. For further 
information, go to:&nbsp;
http://support.nikontech.com/cgi-bin/nikonusa.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=13872
<br> <br>
 Our sample camera produces a visible effect from ISO 160 to 800. 
When we view the image in Photoshop at 100% magnification, we see vertical 
stripes in the normally-exposed areas above or below any large blown-out area. 
The stripes are two pixels wide, and in our samples, slightly lighter than the 
unaffected areas, but don't show any color cast. The effect is not impacted by 
image quality settings.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>We printed an image with the problem on an Epson Stylus Photo 2200. When we 
set the image to fit on letter-size paper (about 80% reproduction), the effect 
was visible only with a magnifying glass. At 100%, we could see it when we 
viewed the print from 7 or 8 inches &ndash; closer than normal viewing 
distance. At 160%, or twice the &quot;fit-on-page&quot; magnification, the 
effect was obvious at a normal viewing distance.<br>
<br>
 How big a deal is 
this? Consider what's required to make it happen: the shot must contain a 
good-sized blotch of blown-out pixels &ndash; exposed at least two stops more 
than would show any detail at all. Blown-out areas usually make for ugly prints 
even without fine vertical lines anyway.<br>
<br>
 On the other hand, many 
valid and interesting pictures have been taken backlit, or with light sources 
in the frame. Adding digital artifacts won't improve them and surely will 
impact the ability to sell them. We wouldn&rsquo;t completely downplay the 
existence of the artifacts as some have attempted. Both of these cameras are 
high-priced, high-performance models that users rely on for strong images. This 
is clearly an issue worth taking a hard look at when deciding whether to 
purchase the camera.<br>
<br>
 We don't know what causes the problem, and won't 
speculate whether it could be corrected with a firmware upgrade designed to 
address it. We have not seen the problem in any other camera &ndash; we shot 
the 5D in the same setup we used for the D200, and could not replicate the 
banding.</p>
