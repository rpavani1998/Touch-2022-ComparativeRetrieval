Canon 5D Mark II &ndash; 
First Impressions (Part Three)&rarr; <br>

<h1>Choices: Nikon D3x, Canon 1Ds III, Canon 5D II</h1> Posted on August 15, 
2010 by Bill <br>

<p>For the serious photographer, there comes a time when consideration of a 
new camera is on the mind.&nbsp; For me, the considerations involve whether 
upgrading will improve the overall quality of what I do.&nbsp; And yes, a good 
camera will produce better images, even though the key ingredient is always the 
photographer and the photographer&rsquo;s skills.</p> 
<p>So, I am considering three cameras for a possible purchase within the next 
six months.&nbsp; The question is, which offers me an opportunity for better 
quality given my style of shooting and the types of images I like to 
capture?&nbsp; Two other factors are important to me.&nbsp; The first is 
weather sealing.&nbsp; The second is build quality and durability.</p> 
<p>Why would I be concerned about weather sealing and durability?</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s simple.&nbsp; When one travels and when one enters into the real 
world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is 
paramount.&nbsp; The equipment must stand up to extreme temperatures, rain, 
snow, sleet, and heat.&nbsp; Second, just getting to the spot that one is about 
to shoot in involves airplanes, safari vehicles, trekking across long 
distances, dust, and sometimes moving by boat in both fresh and salt 
water.&nbsp; So, a weather sealed camera with top notch construction is a major 
consideration.</p> 
<p>Professional cameras generally are built to withstand about 250,000 shutter 
releases, versus consumer cameras that might manage 100,000.&nbsp; Most 
consumer grade cameras won&rsquo;t get close to that number.&nbsp; Yes, a Canon 
XTi will produce great images, I have some to prove it, but it won&rsquo;t last 
very long with the kind of travel photography that I do.&nbsp; It just 
isn&rsquo;t built well enough.</p> 
<p>Heavy is something I detest, but heavy means solid and heavy means better 
photographs.&nbsp; I hate to even think about it, I yearn for a light-weight 
camera that produces great images.&nbsp; But, heavy means the camera can take 
better photos at lower shutter speeds.&nbsp; Yes, a reality.</p> 
<p>So, let&rsquo;s consider three cameras.&nbsp; The Nikon D3x, the Canon 1Ds 
Mark III, and the Canon 5D Mark II.</p> 
<p>Why these three?</p> 
<p>All produce images above 21 Mp.&nbsp; And yes, more megapixels produce 
better resolution.&nbsp; All full frame cameras with no multipliers.&nbsp; What 
you see is what you get.</p> 
<p>So, other than price, which is substantial,&nbsp; what do each offer that 
fit within my requirements?</p> 
<p>The Nikon D3x.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Nikon&rsquo;s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by 
serious photographers.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, first, it tops the megapixel 
race.&nbsp; At 24Mp there is nothing out there, other than the Sony Alpha, that 
offers this much resolution.&nbsp; And it can do neat stuff, like move into 
another mode and capture shots at less megapixels but with astonishing 
speed.&nbsp; In other words, it is two cameras in one.&nbsp; Very high 
resolution and reduced resolution for images per second.&nbsp; A nice versitile 
camera.&nbsp; Wow, it may offer those of us who do both landscapes and wildlife 
photography a great resource.</p> 
<p>Canon 1Ds Mark III.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>At 21.1 megapixels it is a tad shy of the Nikon D3x offering, but it has 
been around for a good while and the images it produces are equal, in my 
opinon, to the new Nikon offering. It has one great advantage over the Nikon 
D3x, and that is sensor cleaning.&nbsp; I hate having to spend hours and hours 
getting rid of dust spots on my images.&nbsp; The D3x does not offer sensor 
cleaning.&nbsp; Next is price.&nbsp; I can buy a 1Ds Mark III for about $1,500 
less than the D3x.&nbsp; No it does not offer different shooting 
modes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t up the frames per second by choosing a 
different format.&nbsp; But, in terms of image quality, in my opinion, it is as 
good as the Nikon.&nbsp; Like the Nikon, it is a professional grade 
camera.&nbsp; Weather sealed and built like a small Abrams tank.</p> 
<p>Canon 5D Mark II.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The 5d Mark II offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a 
full-frame sensor and something entirely new, HD Movies!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; 
Movies too.&nbsp; Problem is, the movies I have seen are terrible, with jerky 
motion.&nbsp; Maybe not the all in one ideal.&nbsp; But, the real consideration 
here is the price.&nbsp; I can buy one for about $2,700, which is substantially 
less than the D3x and the 1Ds III.&nbsp; But, I ask, is it a professional grade 
camera?&nbsp; Canon says it has improved the weather sealing.&nbsp; But, Canon 
does not rate it as a professional grade camera.&nbsp; In other words, 
it&rsquo;s better than its sibling, but not yet a professional grade camera.</p>
<p>But, think a moment, I can buy two of the 5D Mark IIs for what I would pay 
for either alternative!&nbsp; That is interesting, it is in fact a major 
consideration.</p> 
<p>But one must think for a moment.&nbsp; If I am at Punda Maria in South 
Africa and the temperature is hovering around 130 degrees F in the shade, what 
camera do I want there?&nbsp; Or if I am in the Shetland Islands and snow and 
sleet are hitting me with temperatures well below freezing, what camera do I 
want in my bag?&nbsp; After all, I have spent probably as much as the camera is 
worth just getting to where I am about to shoot.&nbsp; So, cost is not always a 
valid consideration.&nbsp; Particularly so if one travels as much as I 
do.&nbsp; Heck, one trip will buy any of these cameras, and I do about four 
major trips per year.</p> 
<p>Hum.</p> 
<p>I look at it this way.&nbsp; I want a camera that will work when I need it 
to work.&nbsp; I want a camera that will withstand what I will put it 
through.&nbsp; I want quality.&nbsp; I want realibility.&nbsp; I want something 
that works when the light is there before me.</p> 
<p>So, I think perhaps I will buy the Canon 1Ds Mark III.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; 
Cost. Build quality. Proven image results. Besides the cost will come down 
substantially in the next six months.&nbsp; Why? Because Canon will respond to 
the Nikon D3x challenge with a mega mega megapixel camera.&nbsp; Maybe even one 
that offers two shooting modes. Full frame and partial frame at higher 
speeds.&nbsp; But, it will cost one heck of a lot more than the 1Ds Mark III 
which is available today.</p> 
<p>Course, the major consideration for me is that I own lots of Canon L 
glass.&nbsp; Glass is forever. Cameras come and go.</p> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<p>The Canon 300 mm f/4 L IS, see:&nbsp; 
http://www.bill.lockharts.com/index.php/tag/canon-300mm-f4l-is</p> 
<p>The Canon 100-400mm f/4.5.-5.6L, see:&nbsp; 
http://www.bill.lockharts.com/index.php/tag/canon-100-400mm-f45-56l</p> 
<p>And the fabulous 200mm f/2.8L, see:&nbsp; 
http://www.bill.lockharts.com/index.php/tag/canon-200mm-f28l</p> 
<p>BTW, I have a 1ds Mark II with about 12,000 shutter releases for sale. It 
has a scratch on the selection wheel, but other than that it is in perfect 
condition.&nbsp; I have it for sale at $3,500.&nbsp; A good price.&nbsp; It 
produces fantastic images.&nbsp; See:&nbsp;
http://www.bill.lockharts.com/index.php/tag/canon-1ds-ii</p> 
<p>And, I will have it professionally cleaned before shipment.</p>

<p>Nikon D3x is an awesome camera . One can only tell when we compare the 
detailed shots taken by Nikon d3x and canon 5dm2.<br>
 Nikon d3x is a clear 
winner . Its the best the Pros can get.</p> Reply <br>

<p>What nonsense! Both the Mk iii and the D3X are good top of the line pro 
cameras. Which is superior is splitting hairs and, if you have one, the 
question of buying the other should be answered by your accountant. The real 
question to answer is, &ldquo;what is the return on my investment?&rdquo;. If 
you buy the D3X because you think it is superior to the Mk iii, are you going 
to sell it when the Mk iv comes out, then sell the Mk iv when the D4X (or D3Y) 
is available, ad nauseam? The only beneficiary of that merry-go-round are 
camera dealers and used camera buyers.</p> 
<p>Bill makes a telling statement but doesn&rsquo;t follow through on it. He 
says that heavy is better. If he really means it, he should dump ALL his Canon 
equipment, not even consider Nikon, and immediately run out and buy a couple of 
Mamiya RZ67 Pro iiD bodies, a bunch of lenses, 2 Leaf backs, and a bunch of car 
batteries. Well Bill, do you have the power of your convictions or were you 
just leading us on?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Paul,</p> 
<p>I have written lots of nonsense in my time, this isn&rsquo;t the first or 
the last time that I will. </p> 
<p>But, one thing is for sure, I don&rsquo;t envision that anytime soon I 
would have the funds to jump into the medium format arena. And frankly, I have 
no desire to lug such equipment around.</p> 
<p>If I did, a Hassy would already be in my camera bag.</p>

<p>After sending my Canon 20D back to Canon 5 times; getting a brand new Canon 
1Ds MKII with a bad sensor; and sending my Canon 1Ds MKIII back to Canon for 
underexposing 2 full stops, I was ready to sell all my Canon lenses and move 
back to Nikon. Based upon Thom Hogan&rsquo;s (www.bythom.com) recent review of 
the Nikon D3X, and many other reviews of the Nikon, I have reconsidered this 
decision. I am a landscape photographer and I am very happy with the 1Ds 
MKIII&rsquo;s resolution, just not happy with Canon quality-control. It seems 
the D3X has its own set of problems that have been overlooked by reviewers that 
are afraid to honestly expose the flaws of this new camera. As these high-end 
cameras become more complex, and quality-control becomes more and more of an 
issue, professionals will need to demand more from Nikon and Canon, and stop 
tolerating poor workmanship and performance.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Omar,</p> 
<p>When one reaches 21MP the issue is glass. At this level, lens diffraction 
will be a major issue, especially for nature photography where one wants 
greater depth of field.</p> 
<p>The scores of the D3x indicate it is the best of the lot. And choices of 
lenses will be the bane of the photographer.</p> 
<p>Any flaw in a lens will show. Only the best glass can be used with these 
cameras.</p> 
<p>Thanks for the link!</p>

<p>I wonder much the sensor score would affect nature photography?</p>

<p>Phil,</p> 
<p>Glad to hear that you like the Canon 5D Mark II, given your background that 
is an impressive statement. And, perhaps you are right, Canon will likely 
announce its replacement for the 1Ds Mark III within the next three months. 
Some speculate that the whole 1D series will be combined into one camera that 
would offer something similar to the D3x.</p> 
<p>The real market for both the D3x and the 1Ds Mark III, is not nature 
photographers, it is the professional photographer who does studio work, 
weddings, or the sports shooters and newspaper reporters who use the camera on 
a daily basis. For those of us who do nature stuff, well, we have to hang our 
hats on what manufacturers offer to full-time photographers.</p> 
<p>But, I suspect that there are lots of photographers like myself out in the 
real world who are going through the same process that I am, that are looking 
at real choices that are available now.</p> 
<p>Waiting for another six months is certainly an option for me. What I have 
now produces good images when I take the time to think about what I am doing.
</p> 
<p>But, I thought it might be good here to start a thread about such choices 
to see if others are considering the same cameras that I am.</p> 
<p>What is good is that we do have some amazing options today. Five years ago 
we could not have foreseen what the technology would produce in such a short 
time. Five years ahead, we might very well be totally shocked at what is 
produced as technology gets better and better. One example is &ldquo;black 
silicon&rdquo; which is 100-500 times more sensitive to light that current 
silicon used in sensors. What a revolution that will offer the photographer if 
it does mature. Imagine that. That capability would simply change everything we 
do with a camera and offer up a new world of light.</p> 
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Hi Neil,</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s tough finding the right camera! I am pleased with the 1Ds Mark 
II, although the speed of the 1D Mark IIn and the 1.3 multiplier sure is great 
for wildlife. My quandary is wanting one camera that will do both, one that 
will withstand the rough treatment of travel and usage.</p> 
<p>At first blush, the Nikon D3x sounds like the answer, giving the 
photographer the option of shooting full-frame or a reduced sized shot at 
higher speeds. But, my gosh, $8,000! Course, I remember buying the 1Ds for that 
four years ago, so perhaps it is not out of line. The 1Ds Mark III originally 
hit the market at around that amount as well. So, maybe Nikon isn&rsquo;t too 
far off in the price. The big issue for me is all the Canon glass I own. 
Replacing my Canon lenses with Nikon lenses will push the price tag close to 
$20,000! That is, if I replace what I have for the Nikon choices.</p> 
<p>So that is an option well beyond my means.</p> 
<p>This is why I am considering the 1Ds Mark III. With outstanding image 
quality, it is difficult to pass up, particularly if the price for it drops in 
the next six months, and likely it will when its replacement is announced.</p> 
<p>As to the 5D Mark II, we are reading some bad experiences with new owners. 
Not all bad, but some issues are there. Course any new camera will have 
production issues. It is always best to wait for a few months prior to 
purchase. Even if the camera is what Canon says it is, I am still concerned 
about whether it will withstand the rigors I know I will put it through.</p>

<p>Bill, I think the camera you want hasn&rsquo;t been sold yet. Canon has to 
make a pro replacement for the 1Ds Mark III soon because the 5D MK II has a 
better processor, same megapixels, etc. and is relatively cheap. If I was you I 
would wait a bit and keep your ear to the ground. By the way, I purchased the 
5D MK II and it is a great camera. You would love the image quality but the 3.9 
mps may not be enough for wildlife shots. Good luck.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hard choice Bill, shame the 5D is showing some strange black dots next to 
bright areas&hellip;Canon yet to comment, here we go again? Of course if you 
are a nature tog and fond of fast AF&hellip;.don&rsquo;t buy the 5D mkII!<br>
 
1Ds mkIII against the D3x&hellip;.D3x is 12 months late (IMO) and therefore 
still overpriced compared to the 1Ds mkIII, but perhaps we should wait for real 
world examples? Perhaps IQ will be so mind blowing we have to have 
one&hellip;.or perhaps buy a couple of Alpha A900&prime;s and resize your 
images so IQ becomes irrelevant?</p> Reply <br>
