<h2> Review: Nikon D200 </h2>  This 10-megapixel digital SLR produces 
excellent images and comes in a sturdy package. But is it worth the $1,700 
price tag?  Written by Ben Long on April 3, 2006 <br>

<p>The Nikon/Canon rivalry is to photographers as the Apple/Microsoft rivalry 
is to computer nerds, or the BMW/Mercedes rivalry is to car aficionados. No 
matter which side you choose, if either, you can't help but appreciate the 
other side for fostering a competition that yields better products for everyone.
</p> 
<p>Years ago, Canon took Nikon by surprise with the release of the EOS D30. 
Since then the companies have battled it out for the hearts and camera bags of 
the mid-range digital SLR market, a market segment that includes hobbyist and 
professional photographers.</p> 
<p>With the release of the D200 (Figure 1), Nikon has for the first time 
unveiled a camera with a higher pixel count than Canon's competitive offering 
(the EOS 30D). At 10 megapixels, the D200 offers an extra two million pixels 
more than 8 megapixel 30D. Nikon also throws in some nice extra features, and 
wraps it all up with a price tag that's around $1,700, typically $300 more than 
the Canon offering.</p> <br>
<em>Figure 1. Front, side, and back views of the 
Nikon D200.</em> <em> </em> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p>Long-time Nikon users will be thrilled with the D200, thanks to its full 
feature set and excellent image quality.</p> 
<p><strong>Sturdy, with <em>Lots</em> of Buttons</strong><br>
 The D200 is a 
fairly large camera with a surprisingly lightweight. Weighing in at 1.8 pounds, 
the D200 doesn't bog down your camera bag. The body is constructed from a 
magnesium alloy and feels very sturdy, with sealed seams and excellent build 
quality. With this type of sealing, Nikon is raising the bar for mid-range SLRs.
</p> 
<p>Full disclosure: I am a confessed Canon shooter. As such, I find the Nikon 
interface annoying. That said, I really appreciate that Nikon has placed<em>all
</em> of the essential controls on external buttons. You won't have to dig into 
a menu to adjust quality, white balance, ISO, drive mode, focus mode, metering 
mode, exposure compensation, or bracketing. You can even reformat your media 
card using external buttons.</p> 
<p>What I don't like is that the D200's interface uses a separate button or 
switch for everything, rather than doubling up controls. This means there are 
many buttons and switches on the camera, and they're spread all over. Most 
controls are interlocked, so you have to push and hold one control while 
turning or pushing another. That makes it impossible to change a setting with 
one hand.</p> 
<p>Current Nikon users accustomed to this configuration can take this 
complaint with a grain of salt. But if you're a prospective buyer with little 
or no prior Nikon D-SLR experience, get your hands on as many cameras -- from 
as many vendors -- as you can. It's the only way to know which body design and 
interface make the most sense to you.</p> 
<p><strong>Features</strong><br>
 The D200 has an impressive feature list -- 
impressive both because of its breadth and because the features are actually 
tools that working photographers will use. Many of these have filtered down 
from the much more expensive Nikon D2x. So, while the D200 is priced at the 
high end of the mid-range market, you get much more than a higher pixel-count 
sensor: You get high-end features, as well.</p> 
<p>Some of the D200's stand-out amenities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A bright, beautiful 2.5-inch LCD screen.
<p></p> </li> 
<li>A depth of field preview button that's easily reachable with your shutter 
finger.</li> 
<li>A viewfinder that's surprisingly bright and clear.</li> </ul> 
<p>The D200 is a fun camera to shoot with. Though the shutter is not as quiet 
and silky as the D70s, the camera still has a very nice shutter feel.</p> 
<p>Of course, all of the standard shooting features you'd expect are here: 
full Program mode along with priority modes, and full manual. Nikon doesn't 
bother with pre-programmed scene modes, an intelligent step for this market.</p>
<p>The D200 provides shutter speeds of 30 seconds to 1/8000th of a second, an 
improvement over the 1/4000th of its predecessor, the D100, and right in line 
with the EOS 30D's equivalent shutter speed.</p> 
<p>Metering is provided by Nikon's excellent 3D Color Matrix Metering system. 
The D200 also provides a center weight meter and a spot meter. The Auto Focus 
system is similarly well-appointed, offering four different autofocus modes. 
However, I found it fairly easy to stump the autofocus system in low light. 
Low-light focusing was often slow, and occasionally failed completely.</p> 
<p>While the D100 had an ISO range of 200 to 1600, Nikon has finally realized 
that the slow end is as important as the fast end and extended the range to 100 
to 1600. The extra stop is a welcome improvement for daylight shooting. ISO is 
adjustable in third-stop increments and the camera provides an in-viewfinder 
ISO readout, making it possible to change ISO without taking your eye from the 
viewfinder.</p> 
<p>One of the D200's most impressive features is its auto-bracketing 
capability. While the EOS 30D provides a basic three-step auto-bracket, the 
D200 lets you bracket up to 9 shots. What's more, you can define a bracket of 
only 2 shots. I usually like to shoot a metered shot and an overexposed shot, 
so the 3-stop auto-bracket on my Canon camera always gives me an extra image. 
Ideally, I'd like to be able to define a custom spacing between each stop.</p> 
<p>JPEG shooters will appreciate the camera's white balance tweaking and 
bracketing features (the D200 can also bracket the flash, or both flash and 
exposure), as well as the ability to saved named white balance presets. All of 
the standard image parameters are available and adjustable, and the camera lets 
you save up to 45 custom settings.</p> 
<p>The D200 provides two kinds of noise reduction: Long Exposure Noise 
Reduction, which aims to reduce the stuck pixel artifacts that can occur when 
shooting long exposures, and High ISO Noise Reduction, which reduces the 
luminance and chrominance noise that higher ISOs produce.</p> 
<p>Some other high-end features are buried in the menu. An intervalometer lets 
you perform automated time-lapse shooting, with full control over number of 
images taken at each interval, duration of the interval, and number of 
intervals to shoot. It's is an excellent ability that more cameras should have.
</p> 
<p>Loosely related to the intervalometer is the repeating flash mode, which 
lets you program the flash to fire at regular intervals for a given amount of 
time. It's great for creative long-exposure photography.</p> 
<p>The D200 can even shoot multiple exposures. Program in the number of shots 
you want to include, and the D200 automatically composites those shots into a 
single multiple-exposure image. The Image Overlay feature lets you control the 
opacity of each composited image. Performing composites in-camera seems like 
kind of a waste of time, but the feature works and is well-implemented.</p> 
<p>The D200's menu is reasonably well-organized, but navigating with the 
four-way rear-mounted control is frustrating because you have to push 
repeatedly to scroll up and down the menu. Nikon should make one of the 
camera's two control wheels function as a menu navigator.</p> 
<p>However, the menu system includes a Recent Settings page which lists the 14 
most recently accessed items. This greatly speeds navigation.</p> 
<p><strong>Image Quality</strong><br>
 There's very little to complain about 
with the D200's image quality. Color accuracy, saturation, contrast, and tone 
are all excellent. Sharpness and detail vary with lens quality, of course, but 
you'll be hard-pressed to get a bad image (Figure 2).</p> <br>
<em>Figure 2. 
Like its predecessors, the D200 yields excellent image quality whether you 
shoot in JPEG or raw. Click on the image for a larger view.</em> <em> </em> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p>However, I found that the D200 didn't do as well as other cameras in 
low-light shooting conditions. Starting from ISO 800 and up, the camera 
produces noticeably more noise than Canon's EOS 30D (Figure 3). If you make 
your living shooting in darker conditions, this might be a deal-breaker.</p> 
<br> Figure 3. In these 100% crops, the Canon 30D image is on the left, and the 
Nikon D200 shot is on the right. As you can see, at ISO 1600 the D200 produces 
substantially more noise than the 30D. 
<p></p> 
<p>For JPEG shooters, the camera provides plenty of in-camera customization. 
If you're a raw shooter, you'll have lots of latitude during your conversion. 
The D200 raw format is now supported by all major raw converters, including 
Photoshop Camera Raw and Apple's Aperture.</p> 
<p><strong>Add-Ons</strong><br>
 Nikon offers a tremendous selection of 
lenses, including a dedicated DX series of lenses designed specifically for the 
smaller crop created by the camera's APS-sized sensor.</p> 
<p>The D200 supports a couple of other cool accessories. A WiFi transmitter 
can automatically transmit images to your computer, making for tethered 
shooting functionality without the tether. A GPS receiver is also available, 
letting you tag your images with position information at shoot-time.</p> 
<p><strong>Should You Buy It?</strong><br>
 For people who own Nikons and want 
to stay with what they know, the D200 is an exciting release. Great image 
quality and better overall specs make it a valuable addition to the Nikon 
product line. If you're not already a Nikon shooter, then the D200 is a great 
offering -- as long as you're comfortable with the camera's controls. Interface 
affinity is a very subjective thing, and you really must make that call 
yourself.</p> 
<p>While you're testing, ask yourself if you can easily get to the essential, 
everyday shooting functions: exposure compensation, ISO speed, bracketing, 
drive mode, and if you're a JPEG shooter, white balance. Then consider 
secondary operations: changing to priority or manual mode, metering, and focus 
modes.</p> 
<p>No matter where your camera loyalties may lie, the D200 will probably 
affect you thanks to Nikon's merging of high-end features in a mid-range price. 
Hopefully, this means that such features as expanded auto-bracketing and 
intervalometers will become expected features in more cameras in this market.

<h2>Who shoots at ISO 1600?</h2> 
<p>I find it amusing how often I've has read reviews of digital cameras (which 
are really Canon vs Nikon comparisons) that find it necessary to key on the 
noise produced by Nikon at ISO 1600. I have never intentionally shot at ISO 
1600 in my 40+ years of photography. When shooting in low light you use a 
tripod, and can then shoot at ISO 200-800 or whatever you choose. To me it 
seems that those with a Canon bias like to bring this up as some kind of camera 
superiority. The fact is, there little difference between the two camera 
makers, it really boils down to preference.</p>  Submitted by rschoone on Tue,

<h2>Great Camera</h2> 
<p>this is my 3rd dslr (fuji s2, Nikon d70s) and it is far away the best and 
will most likely be my camera of choice for years to come. The fuji took great 
photos but battery set-up was terrible; it's gone now. I still have the d70s, 
as a back-up, but it just doesn't feel like a real camera and I'm always 
knocking the program knob from manual to beach scene or something like that.</p>
<p>The D200 feels and sounds great, very solid; like my old F5. All the 
controls are well thought-out and well placed. You can change ISO, color 
balance, mode, exposure comp. all without taking your eye from the viewfinder; 
a big plus. Battery life could be better but it's not a big deal; I just carry 
an extra battery.<br>

<h2>Like the seals but WAY TOO NOISEY</h2> 
<p>Too much noise!</p>  Submitted by steama on Mon, 04/03/2006 - 06:49. <br>

<h2>Noise Picture not right for D200</h2> 
<p>I don't know where you were, but my D200 doesn't have noise like that, you 
might want to look over what you did and try again. You didn't mention the 
great lighting system this camera has, shooting one hand is easy and all the 
controls fall right into my hands, also the body ergonomics is way better than 
Canon ever has been. In comparison the D200 makes the newer Canon look like a 
$5 point and shoot if you ask me, and Canon has a long way to come up to par 
with Nikon.</p>  Submitted by futurexboy on Wed, 05/24/2006 - 18:12. <br>

<h2>Agree on the D200</h2> 
<p>First this is a heck of a machine, true high speed 5 fps, with professional 
quality and quantitiy, the D200 (at least mine does) shines like a bright star. 
This camera is AWESOME , you feel you have a real good camera in your hands, 
the controls are all in the right place , some things work different and i 
still have to think oh it is not my D80 or D60 but the D200.</p> 
<p>It delivers great pictures and i get getting better images out of it every 
time i punt my hadns around it to HUG it .</p> 
<p>yes it is noisy but i like the clack sound it makes </p> 
<p>it is my best and favourite camera</p>  Submitted by Guest on Wed,
