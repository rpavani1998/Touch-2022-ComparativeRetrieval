<h1>Camera-Specific Training at Lynda.com</h1>  February 27, 2012 by Ben Long 
&middot;1 Comment <br>
Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>

<p> There&rsquo;s a lot to know to be a capable photographer. Exposure theory, 
lighting, composition. On top of all that, there are all those buttons and 
dials on your camera. To help you understand exactly how your camera works, you 
might want to check out one of my camera-specific courses at Lynda.com. These 
courses will work you through all of the features of their respective cameras, 
and help you understand those features in the context of larger photographic 
theories. Courses are now available for theCanon EOS60D, the Nikon D7000, the 
Canon Rebel T3i, and the Nikon D5100. </p> <br>

<h1>Nikon Capture NX 2 Classes</h1>  August 12, 2010 by Ben Long &middot; 7 
Comments <br>
Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>

<p>If you&rsquo;re getting started with Capture NX2 and want to get up to 
speed quickly, then consider taking a class from the official Nikon school. 
I&rsquo;ll be teaching a half-day workshop in six different cities around the 
country starting in November. For $99 it&rsquo;s a great way to get quickly 
immersed in the application, and learn the ins and outs of editing with this 
exceptional tool. The workshops will be held in Santa Clara, Washington DC, 
Orlando, Chicago, New York City, and Dallas. Check out<strong>the official link
</strong> for more info.</p> <br>

<h1>Revisited: Do you need a full-frame sensor?</h1>  March 29, 2010 by Ben 
Long &middot; 10 Comments <br>
Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>Five years ago, I wrote <strong>this piece</strong> on whether you should 
buy afull-frame or cropped sensor digital camera. At the time, cameras with a 
full-frame sensor were substantially more expensive than cropped-sensor 
cameras, and a lot of people believed that, eventually, cropped-sensor cameras 
would be phased out and replaced by more affordable full-frame cameras. Five 
years later, we&rsquo;ve seen that that&rsquo;s not going to happen, but the 
question remains: do you need full-frame or is a cropped sensor camera okay?</p>

<h1>Using Nikon Capture NX2 With Adobe Bridge CS4</h1>  October 15, 2009 by 
Ben Long &middot; 10 Comments <br>
Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>

<p>Frequent visitors to this site know that I&rsquo;m a big fan of Adobe 
Bridge CS4. However, if you&rsquo;re a Nikon user who shoots raw, then you 
might prefer using Nikon Capture NX for your raw conversions, rather than Adobe 
Camera Raw. Capture NX is a great program, and, because it&rsquo;s made by 
Nikon, does far better with some Nikon raw files than Camera Raw does. However, 
the workflow tools in NX and NX2 don&rsquo;t compare to Bridge CS4, but 
fortunately, there&rsquo;s an easy way to integrate the two programs.</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>Capture NX2 is the eagerly-awaited follow-up to Nikon&rsquo;s excellent 
image editing, raw conversion software. While the raw converter only works with 
Nikon cameras, the editor itself is also compatible with TIFF or JPEG files. 
Why should you care if you don&rsquo;t shoot with a Nikon camera? Because 
Capture NX includes extremeley powerful editing tools wrapped up in a 
completely non-destructive editing environment.</p> <br>

<h1>Nikon D-300</h1>  March 7, 2008 by Ben Long &middot; 5 Comments <br>
Filed 
under:Reviews&nbsp; <br>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been shopping for a mid-range digital SLR, it&rsquo;s a 
safe bet to say you&rsquo;ve probably been considering the Nikon D-300. The 
latest rev of Nikon&rsquo;s mid-range camera, the D-300 offers some impressive 
changes from it&rsquo;s predecessor, the D-200. As with previous Nikon models, 
no other camera comes close to Nikon when it comes to feature list, and the 
D-300 backs up its features with improved image quality.</p> <br>

<h1>Specialty Lenses</h1>  November 30, 2007 by Ben Long &middot; 2 Comments 
<br>Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>In the digital age, it&rsquo;s easy to get so caught up in cool 
post-production effects and techniques that you forget about what can be done 
in-camera with the right lens. If you&rsquo;re a long-time film shooter, then 
you&rsquo;re possibly well-trafficked in the realm of specialized lenses, but 
if you&rsquo;re new to digital SLRs, then you may know what is possible to 
achieve inside your camera, with a simple lens change.</p> <br>

<h1>Nikon Compressed Raw Format &ndash; Lossy or Lossless?</h1>  October 15, 
2007 byBen Long &middot; 4 Comments <br>
Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>

<p>Like most digital SLRs, Nikon&rsquo;s family of digital SLRs offer the 
ability to shoot in raw mode. However, Nikon&rsquo;s raw offerings provide a 
twist, in the form of compressed raw. The promise of compressed raw files, of 
course, is that they take up less space and allow you to store more images on 
your card. Data compression algorithms fall into two categories: lossy 
techniques, which degrade the quality of your image; and lossless techniques, 
which reduce file size without affecting image quality. Nikon users often ask 
whether the compressed raw format is lossless or lossy, so I decided to look 
into the question</p> <br>

<h1>Creating an Integrated iPhoto/Capture NX Workflow</h1>  May 9, 2007 by Ben 
Long &middot; 5 Comments <br>
Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve played at all with Nikon Capture NX, you already know that 
it has some of the best editing tools on the market (if you haven&rsquo;t 
played with it, a free demo version is availablehere). But, if you&rsquo;re 
used to the workflow management and output features of Apple&rsquo;s iPhoto, 
you may be reluctant to give up iPhoto&rsquo;s powerful library features to 
switch to a Finder-based workflow driven by the Capture NX file browser. 
Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a very easy way to integrate the two programs. With 
an integrated iPhoto/NX workflow, you can import and organize your images in 
iPhoto, but edit them using Capture NX&rsquo;s superior raw conversion options 
and localized editing tools.</p> <br>

<h1>Capture NX and the Nikon 10.5mm Fisheye Lens</h1>  April 26, 2007 by Ben 
Long &middot; 4 Comments <br>
Filed under: Features&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>Nikon Capture NX provides an excellent auto correction edit for removing 
distortion from images shot with the Nikon 10.5mm fisheye lens. Though I 
mention this feature inReal World Capture NX, I didn&rsquo;t have enough room 
in the book to include examples, so we&rsquo;re going to look at the specifics 
of this feature here. With the Fisheye Lens edit, you can create cropped, 
rectilinear images with a single click.</p> <br>

<h1>Should you buy a Rebel XTi or Nikon D80?</h1>  November 10, 2006 by Ben 
Long &middot; 14 Comments <br>
Filed under: Reviews&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>As digital camera vendors continue to slice the low to mid-range digital 
SLR market into narrower and narrower niches, deciding which camera to buy 
becomes much more complex. In addition to there being more cameras to choose 
from, it has become more difficult to decide exactly how much you&rsquo;re 
willing to pay &ndash; no matter what price point you choose, there&rsquo;s 
probably a slightly better camera priced just $100 more. Two recent entries 
into this market, the Canon Digital Rebel XTi, and the Nikon D80 are a prime 
example of this phenomenon.</p> <br>

<h1>Nikon Announces D80</h1>  August 9, 2006 by Ben Long &middot; 4 Comments 
<br>Filed under: Reviews&nbsp; <br>

<p></p> <br>
Nikon today finally took the wraps off of their new N80, a 10.4 
megapixel successor to the D70s priced at $1299 in a bundle with a new lens 
&ndash; the DX 18-135 f/3.5-5.6 G ED-IF. While the N80 doesn&rsquo;t pack the 
same sensor as the $1800 D200, it does boast the same resolution and same image 
processing circuitry. While I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to see any output from 
the camera, Nikon did let me get my hands on a D80. As a long-time Canon 
shooter, I can say with authority that Canon is rapidly falling behind&hellip;

<br>
If you&rsquo;ve 
been trying to choose an image editor/raw converter and have been confused by 
all the options (Photoshop, Aperture, Capture One, Lightroom, etc.) then your 
quandry just got a lot more complicated. Nikon Capture NX, slated for release 
in the late summer or early fall gives all of those applications a run for 
their money, thanks to its innovative new approach to image editing. <br>

<h1>Should you buy a Canon EOS 30D or Nikon D200?</h1>  March 28, 2006 by Ben 
Long &middot; 43 Comments <br>
Filed under: Reviews&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>The Nikon D200, a 10 megapixel SLR with an APS-sized sensor began shipping 
in November of 2005. At $1700 for the body, it was $200 more than Canon&rsquo;s 
nearest competitor, the 8.3 megapixel EOS 20D. Canon has now fired back against 
the D200, but not with a similarly-pixeled competitor. The new EOS 30D offers 
several improvements over the 20D that it replaces, but rather than matching 
Nikon&rsquo;s pixel count, Canon stuck with the 8.3 megapixel sensor of the 
20D, and dropped the price of the 30D body to $1,399. Photographers who are 
looking for a mid-range Canon or Nikon camera now find themselves asking 
&quot;Do I need more pixels, or more dollars?&quot;</p> <br>

<h1>Should you buy a Nikon D70 or Canon EOS 20D?</h1>  June 2, 2005 by Ben Long

Filed under: Reviews&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>(Updated 6/17/05) Five years ago, Canon released the EOS D30 and shocked a 
lot of people by proving that there was a large market for a digital SLR under 
$5,000. While this may sound obvious now, a lot of camera makers were caught by 
surprise. Five years later, Nikon is still in something of a 
&quot;catch-up&quot; mode. Their first foray into this market, the D-100 was 
not price competitive and suffered from performance issues, while the D70, 
though a very good camera, was priced a little strange. If you&rsquo;re looking 
for a mid-level digital SLR &ndash; one that offers full features, speedy 
performance, excellent image quality, and a sturdy build and feel, then 
you&rsquo;ve probably been looking closely at the Nikon D70s and Canon EOS 20D. 
Both are excellent cameras, and I don&rsquo;t envy you the decision, but there 
are some quantifiable differences, which I&rsquo;ll explore in more detail in 
this article.</p> <br>
