<strong>DSLR 
advice please</strong>  I am looking into getting a DSLR.<br>
<br>
 Would like 
some advice if possible,<br>
<br>
 What make should I go for, or what make 
should I stay away from ?<br>
<br>
 Should I go for a bundle, or just build as 
I go ?<br>
<br>
 This looks ok as a bundle from Jessops <br>
<br>

http://www.jessops.com/online.store/...3410/show.html<br>
<br>
<br>
 I have a 
DSLR course booked for the end of Jan so would lime to be up and running before 
then.<br>
<br>
 I am currently setting up a website and would like to maybe 
make a few quid in the future if possible or maybe just use it to fund new kit 
etc etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Any help or advice would be appreciated. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>  Try before you buy, go into Jessops and ask to play with a Canon and a 
Nikon DSLR, you cant go wrong with either.<br>
<br>
 Got to go with what you 
feel comfortable with, Canon are slightly smaller than Nikon, for the man with 
effeminate hands <br>

 Just picked up a Sony A390 for &pound;200, 
brand new boxed with 12month warranty<br>
<br>
 Did a quick google search when 
I was in the shop and looks like I got a good deal. <br>

 the last 
thing you want to do is to buy into a system of camera and lenses, only to 
discover you'll want to change as your experience grows.<br>
<br>
 choose 
either Nikon or Canon, after having a play with both systems.<br>
<br>
 You 
will end up with far more invested in glass (lenses) than in any one camera 
body but, canon or nikon, you won't go wrong. <br>

 lol, i didn't see that - too late to the posting party. <br>
<br>
 
oh well. i did read the other day Sony's have a stupid big dynamic range on 
their chips, like bigger than film and my 5D II !<br>
<br>
 so, it's not all 
bad. <br>

 Whats wrong with the Sony ? Saved about 200 quid. 
<br> <br>
 I wanted to to do a bit more reaseach but the price was to could to 
pass up.<br>
<br>
 Also I think I could sell in six months for more or less 
what I paid if want to change to canon, nikon etc.... <br>

<br>  I'm no expert, but nothing wrong with the Sony IMO  I use a Sony A200 and 
love it. Pick up a nice, cheap Minolta 50mm prime lens and you'll get some 
great low light shots. Nice camera to start with, even if it does mean selling 
your lenses too if you decide to switch brands later.<br>

 If anyone is still looking, HotUKDeals has had various Canon 
DSLRs at good prices over the last few days.<br>

Canon's video is the best on the market, people are shooting for TV and film on 
Canon 5D &amp; 7D's.<br>

 I

 Think that will be 
the one I get, are you aware of a new model coming out as I'd prefer to pay a 
bit less if a next generation appears on the scene. As I know I'll need another 
lens to!<br>

Canon rumours say that there might be a new model launching later this year, 
but it's only rumours so far.<br>

 Have a google on it, I think there's a way 
to find out how many shots the body has taken, do your research first, but yeah 
I would buy a second hand one.<br>

 As above. <br>
<br>
 If it's been owned by someone 
like me, yes trust it.<br>
<br>
 If a professional has had it, walk away. It 
will be tired.<br>
<br>
 You can tell how mnay shots, check Google as above.

 Just the size, it's small, but if you add a battery 
grip it's much better to hold.<br>

 Depends what you mean by ( comparable phone?). 
<br> <br>
 Yes; the G3 is meant to be smaller than a DSLR. <br>
<br>
 No, it's 
NOT comparable to a phone camera. <br>

 Can I suggest 
that you go and physically handle the cameras to get a feel for them?<br>
<br>
 
It's how I settled on Nikon, instead of Canon.<br>
<br>
 The Nikon D70 I bought 
was so ergonomic. And my D300 is even better. <br>
