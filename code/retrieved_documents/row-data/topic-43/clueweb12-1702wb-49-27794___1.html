<h2>Canon or Nikon?</h2> 
<p>Canon or Nikon&hellip;which is better?</p> 
<p>Great question that I can&rsquo;t answer as I shoot BOTH.&nbsp; I am 
neither a fan boy, nor am I sponsored, by either brand. The camera and the lens 
mounted are the TOOLS of my trade. Not a religious experience or something lust 
worthy. When we shot film we shot in both Small (35mm)&nbsp; and Medium (645, 
6&times;6 and 6&times;7) format at the same wedding.&nbsp; Just as then, we use 
different camera for different requirements. As one of my partners also has a 
Mamiya with a PhaseOne back, we actually&nbsp; shoot 3 systems. For some people 
(lazy jpeg shooters) this causes huge problems with matching colour. Because we 
shoot in RAW to maximise quality, we face no colour variations between cameras.
</p> 
<p>With regard to the 2 &ldquo;big brands&rdquo;: My Nikons are much faster 
handling during an event and have a great flash system. OTOH my Canons while 
slower to use, have higher resolution, 1080p video mode, and some lenses I want 
to use not available from Nikon.</p> 
<p>Hope this answers some questions.</p> <br>

<p>I am an international photographer from New Zealand, based in Malaysia. 
Although I have shot many different types of weddings in many different 
locations, I believe the secret to my success is that I shoot every wedding as 
though it were my own. My photojournalistic style of shooting ensures candid, 
natural images that tell a unique romantic story &ndash; YOURS!</p>
