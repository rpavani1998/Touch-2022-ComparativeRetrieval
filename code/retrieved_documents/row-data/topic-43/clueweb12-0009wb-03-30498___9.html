<h3>Talented practioners of a new discipline</h3> 
<p>Walt Whitman wasn&rsquo;t part of the curriculum at the parochial high 
school I attended in Sydney a long time ago. Our attention was directed instead 
towards the English poets and a token Australian or two. So it was a surprise 
and a delight to be introduced to Whitman through the poem that closed
Doc&rsquo;s entry on Wednesday. What a gift, I thought, to be pointed in 
Whitman&rsquo;s direction; I immediately recalled an essay written byJohn 
Szarkowski twenty years ago on the work of the French photographer, 
Eug&egrave;ne Atget.</p> 
<p>Atget died in Paris in 1927, having spent the previous thirty years 
assembling a comprehensive catalog of French architecture, landscape, and 
everyday life. In that time, he exposed perhaps ten thousand glass 
negatives&mdash;as Szarkowski writes in another essay, Atget &ldquo;was not 
progressive, but worked patiently with techniques that were obsolescent when he 
adopted them, and very nearly anachronistic by the time of his death.&rdquo; 
Nor was his work appreciated by his fellow countrymen. The American photographer
Berenice Abbott rescued an enormous cache of his negatives from neglect and 
possible destruction. Through her efforts and Szarkowski&rsquo;s, Atget&rsquo;s 
reputation was secured.</p> 
<p>Doc&rsquo;s essay is titled, <em>It&rsquo;s the Writing, Geniuses</em>. 
Doc&rsquo;s genius lies in the way he builds his argument carefully and 
concludes it gracefully by pointing to Whitman&rsquo;s poem. 
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he seems to be saying. &ldquo;This will reward your 
attention.&rdquo;&nbsp;I suggest that&nbsp;accomplished bloggers, Doc included, 
are practising a discipline that Szarkowski defines here:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As a way of beginning, one might compare the art of photography to the act 
of pointing. All of us, even the best-mannered of us, occasionally point, and 
it must be true that some of us point to more interesting facts, events, 
circumstances, and configurations than others. It is not difficult to imagine a 
person&mdash;a mute Virgil of the corporeal world&mdash;who might elevate the 
act of pointing to a creative plane, a person who would lead us through the 
fields and streets and indicate a sequence of phenomena and aspects that would 
be beautiful, humorous, morally instructive, cleverly ordered, mysterious, or 
astonishing, once brought to our attention, but that had been unseen before, or 
seen dumbly, without comprehension. This talented practitioner of the new 
discipline (the discipline a cross, perhaps, between theater and criticism) 
would perform with a special grace, sense of timing, narrative sweep, and wit, 
thus endowing the act not merely with intelligence, but with that quality of 
formal rigor that identifies a work of art, so that we would be uncertain, when 
remembering the adventure of the tour, how much of our pleasure and sense of 
enlargement had come from the things pointed to and how much from a pattern 
created by the pointer.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced the best blogs owe much of their power to such an art 
of graceful pointing. And, that though they may not look like journalism, they 
sure as hell feel like art.</p>

<h3>Bakersfield and Sprott</h3> 
<p>Jeff Ward at Visible Darkness was surprised to learn that in 1990 
Bakersfield, where he grew up, was the 97th largest city in the US and Little 
Rock, where he currently resides, was 96th.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Shock number three. The 2000 figures show Bakersfield at 396,000. However, 
Little Rock must be growing faster. The 2000 figure is 548,000. I&rsquo;m sure 
this includes North Little Rock, just across the river, which is a fairly 
substantial place. But damn, I never thought this place was that big either. So 
much for my small town feeling. I don&rsquo;t suppose a half a million people 
qualify as a small town. But Little Rock still has something close to a small 
town mentality, though I confess that it&rsquo;s actually less 
&ldquo;hickish&rdquo; than Bakersfield&hellip;</p> 
<p>Just for giggles, I had to look up the figures for Canberra&mdash;313,000 
according to the tourist web site. So, the capitol of that continent is smaller 
than Bakersfield? Now that does make for an interesting picture. Okay, so 
Sydney is twice the size of LA&hellip; that wasn&rsquo;t the point. It&rsquo;s 
just strange trying to picture places you haven&rsquo;t been. I&rsquo;m sure 
Canberra has nothing in common with Bakersfield, it just seemed like a funny 
thing to compare. Or, at least it would be funny if you&rsquo;d ever been to 
Bakersfield.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been to both: Canberra many times and Bakersfield just once, in 
the late eighties, during my mid-life crisis, driving from San Francisco to Las 
Vegas via Death Valley with a girlfriend little more than half my age. 
It&rsquo;s probably true that Canberra has nothing in common with Bakersfield. 
Certainly, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards never wrote a song that mentioned 
Australia&rsquo;s capital city:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield <br>
Listening 
to gospel music on the colored radio station<br>
And the preacher said, 
&ldquo;You know you always have the<br>
Lord by your side&rdquo; </p> 
<p>And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran <br>
Twenty red 
lights in his honor<br>
Thank you Jesus, thank you Lord.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><em>Far Away Eyes</em> (from <em>Some Girls</em>) </p> 
<p>I always loved that song, though not because of the reference to 
Bakersfield. One of my happiest memories of being married is driving with my 
wife through Alabama on a Sunday afternoon in the early eighties, listening to 
gospel music on the colored radio station. We were looking for the crossroads 
store at Sprott. We turned a corner and there it was, still recognizable from 
the photographsWalker Evans made there in the summer of 1936. Many of the 
photographs he took in Alabama for the Farm Security Administration were 
reproduced at the beginning of<em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em>, the book 
that he and James Agee produced when<em>Fortune </em>declined to publish their 
collaboration as a magazine article.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>All over Alabama, the lamps are out. Every leaf drenches the touch; the 
spider&rsquo;s net is heavy. The roads lie there, with nothing to use them. The 
fields lie there, with nothing at work in them, neither man nor beast. The plow 
handles are wet, and the rails and the frogplates and the weeds between the 
ties: and not even the hurryings and hoarse sorrows of a distant train, on 
other roads, is heard. The little towns, the county seats, house by house 
white-painted and elaborately sawn among their heavy and dark-lighted leaves, 
in the spaced protections of their mineral light they stand so prim, so voided, 
so undefended upon starlight, that it is inconceivable to despise or to scorn a 
white man, an owner of land; even in Birmingham, mile on mile, save for the 
sudden frightful streaming, almost instantly diminished and silent, of a closed 
black car, and save stone lonesome sinister heelbeats, that show never a face 
and enter, soon, a frame door flush with the pavement, and ascend the immediate 
lightless staircase, mile on mile, stone, stone, smooth charted streams of 
stone, the streets under their lifted lamps lie void before eternity.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>We traveled through the South, visiting most of the places Walker Evans 
photographed as well as many of the towns where Robert Frank had taken pictures 
for<em>The Americans</em>. I just found our itinerary folded in the back of the 
copy of<em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em> that I carried with me. I realize 
it&rsquo;s time to read this extraordinary book again. In his preface to the 
Aperture monograph on Walker Evans, Lloyd Fonvielle wrote:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The text is an extended meditation on morality, perception, the limits of 
language, and the deceptions of art, all unified by elaborate descriptions of 
rural poverty executed with surgical precision and lyric genius. It contains 
the best of Agee&rsquo;s magnificent prose, as well as jarring passages of 
adolescent self-indulgence, self-pity, and pretension. The result is a work of 
maddening, frightful inspiration, a masterpiece by any standards but a 
masterpiece that parades its flaws with poignant, nearly tragic recklessness.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;adolescent self-indulgence, self-pity, and 
pretension&rdquo;&mdash;sounds just like a weblog. For all of its supposed 
faults,<em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em> remains one of my favorite books. 
I&rsquo;m glad to have been reminded of it.</p>

<h3>I always wanted to be a writer</h3> 
<p>Looking at Jeff Ward&rsquo;s photographs at Visible Darkness over the past 
few months, I often used to wonder why he stopped making those beautiful, 
mysterious, intelligent pictures. TodayJeff&rsquo;s reminiscence of 
transforming himself from a photographer to a writer unleashed a torrent of 
memories. Jeff gets the sounds of camera shutters just right: &ldquo;the 
near-silent<em>fftt</em> of a Leica or Rollei to the loud <em>WHAP</em> of a 
Mamiya RB-67&rdquo; and the<em>CLUNK</em> of the Nikon F series. For a long 
time, I used Nikon F models for exactly the same reason as Jeff: the viewfinder 
showed 100% of the frame. Then I settled on the Hasselblad. The viewfinder 
showed a fraction less but I loved the square frame, the 2&frac14; negative, 
the solid<em>THWUMP</em> of the shutter and mirror, and&mdash;above 
all&mdash;the sense of control. Again Jeff nails it:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The real stuff happens at the edges, and I wanted control. Control, 
control, control &hellip; the world must be ordered, there must be some sense 
behind it all. Standing in the empty concrete and brown spaces of Southern 
California, I tried to make it work. To find in those rectilinear spaces 
something that I felt was inside myself. What I found out was&mdash; the harder 
you look, the less likely you are to find it. I suppose what I wanted most of 
all was mystery, and mystery just won&rsquo;t come when called. Year after year 
of trying to make sense, when really all I needed to do was let go and let 
sense and mystery find me.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Year after year of trying to make sense&hellip;&rdquo; For the 
nearly twenty years that I was a photographer, I was never bored for an 
instant. Photography was endlessly fascinating: the perfect amalgam of art and 
science. I enjoyed sloshing around with chemicals, the solitude of the 
darkroom, the beauty and precision of expensive cameras, the physicality of 
taking pictures (requiring a kind of athletic grace more akin to sports than 
making art). Like Jeff, I was captivated by the intellectual challenge of 
transforming chaotic three-dimensional space into a cohesive flat plane.</p> 
<p>I loved the fact that it was difficult and I could do it. Most of all I 
loved the idea that pictures could touch people&rsquo;s hearts and change their 
lives.</p> 
<p>In 1987 I bought a Macintosh. I had commenced photographing in the Neonatal 
Intensive Care Unit of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Sydney and thought a 
computer might bring some order to my unwieldy project. Which it did. I showed 
the pictures&mdash;the best work I had ever done&mdash;atWatters Gallery in 
August 1987 to general, though not universal, acclaim. Some viewers thought my 
photographs were intrusive, that I had exploited vulnerable people at a 
desperately unhappy time in their lives.</p> 
<p>This was not true. I never photographed without permission and was acutely 
sensitive to every agonizing nuance. The only couple to ask that their baby not 
be included later changed their minds as their child hovered on the brink of 
death. For many parents, I had created a record of their child&rsquo;s struggle 
towards recovery and their responses to that struggle; for a lonely few, my 
photographs are the only tangible evidence of their baby&rsquo;s brief 
existence.</p> 
<p>Then I stopped photographing.</p> 
<p>It was not a sudden decision but rather a feeling that built up over the 
course of a year. Perhaps I had come up hard against the midlife crisis and 
this activity that had absorbed most of my waking attention gradually became 
meaningless to me. I certainly did other midlife crisis kinds of things: 
quitting my teaching job at the university art school, drinking too much, going 
out with girls half my age.</p> 
<p>Maybe my disaffection sprang from a conviction that television had rendered 
photography almost irrelevant, a process only hastened by its elevation to the 
status of an Art. Or I was appalled by the corrosive influence that 
&ldquo;theory&rdquo; had begun to exert on practice, as an opportunistic 
postmodernism analyzed pictures to within an inch of their lives before 
abandoning them in the cul-de-sac of political correctness.</p> 
<p>I know I yearned for those photographic values which started with Walker 
Evans and finished with Robert Frank and had fallen into disrepute. Possibly I 
accepted the fact that I&rsquo;d done the best I was capable of and it was 
better to walk away and begin anew.</p> 
<p>Most probably I had exhausted my reserves of love and compassion.</p> 
<p>Desperately needing a new obsession, I attended an Apple conference in 
early 1989 where I saw the beginnings of what would become 
&ldquo;multimedia.&rdquo; I realized that this new medium combined three of my 
passions: images, writing, and movies. Multimedia metamorphosed into CD-ROM and 
then the Web. I learned to write and kept practising.</p> 
<p>At the same time I discovered multimedia I fell ardently in love with a 
Japanese woman, a love affair that&mdash;although it lasted less than a 
year&mdash;rekindled a fascination for Japanese language and culture that had 
waxed and waned through all my time as a photographer. A few years ago I 
visited Nagasaki. Walking through the Peace Park, which contains an astonishing 
array of kitsch sculpture, I saw a gigantic statue of a Japanese woman looking 
lovingly at a dove perched near her shoulder. When I looked more closely, I 
realized she bore an uncanny resemblance toAyako.</p> 
<p>Jeff Ward learned to write because he wanted to talk online about the 
pictures he was making. I learned to write in order to fill the void that 
opened up when I stopped making pictures. Jeff never wanted to be a writer. I 
realized&nbsp;recently that I always did. Now we&rsquo;re a couple of 
ex-photographers who spend most of our time writing (though we both include 
photographs in our weblogs). Jeff thinks &ldquo;words are easier!&rdquo; 
I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>

<h3>The unbearable sweetness of friendship</h3> 
<p>Tonight at the video store, where I&rsquo;d gone to pick up Philip 
Kaufman&rsquo;s movie of Kundera&rsquo;s <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being
</em>, the rental clerk asked me if I had a reward card (<em>Rent Five, Get One 
Free</em>). I found it, along with two photo booth pictures that I&rsquo;d put 
there for safe keeping, then promptly forgotten.</p> <br>

<p>The photographs had been sandwiched between pages 200 and 201 of the copy of
<em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em> that I bought from Gould&rsquo;s 
bookstore six weeks ago. In Chapter 9 of Part Five (which ends on page 200) and 
Chapter 10 (which begins on page 201), Kundera attempts to explain the reasons 
for Tomas&rsquo;s compulsive womanizing. Chapter 10 opens:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Men who pursue a multitude of women fit neatly into two categories. Some 
seek their own subjective and unchanging dream of a woman in all women. Others 
are prompted by a desire to possess the endless variety of the objective female 
world.</p> 
<p>The obsession of the former is <em>lyrical</em>: what they seek in women is 
themselves, their ideal, and since an ideal is by definition something that can 
never be found, they are disappointed again and again. The disappointment that 
propels them from woman to woman gives their inconstancy a kind of romantic 
excuse, so that many sentimental women are touched by their unbridled 
philandering.</p> 
<p>The obsession of the latter is <em>epic</em>, and women see nothing the 
least bit touching in it: the man projects no subjective ideal on women, and 
since everything interests him, nothing can disappoint him. This inability to 
be disappointed has something scandalous about it. The obsession of the epic 
womanizer strikes people as lacking in redemption (redemption by 
disappointment).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>It&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that my copy of Kundera&rsquo;s novel 
originally belonged to one or other of the young women. In the book, Sabina 
(Tomas&rsquo;s mistress) encourages Tereza (his wife) to become a photographer, 
lending her &ldquo;three or four monographs of famous photographers&rdquo; and 
explaining &ldquo;what made each of the photographs interesting.&rdquo;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>[Tereza] felt a rush of admiration for Sabina, and because Sabina treated 
her as a friend it was an admiration free of fear and suspicion and quickly 
turned into friendship.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>What makes the photo booth pictures (formally) interesting is that they are 
framed as mirror images, except that the women have changed places so that each 
appears in the foreground of one photo and the background of another. The real 
interest is, however, in the pair rather than the single images; in the 
juxtaposition of two portraits of two women, happily mugging for a camera 
without an operator, as it records a tiny sliver of &ldquo;the endless variety 
of the objective female world.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Better than a show</h3> 
<p>It&rsquo;s been a photographic trip down memory lane at Visible Darkness. 
Jeff Ward&rsquo;s own gallery series&mdash;Social Studies in Southern 
California Bars 1989-93&mdash;is simply remarkable. Forget the thumbnail 
sketches, choose either the 800x600 or 1024x768 show, sit back, and let the 
images wash over you. So much hope, longing, sadness, optimism, and desperation 
packed into every frame. And pay attention to the edges of the frame, 
there&rsquo;s so much going on.</p> 
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s scattered other pictures though his blog over the past week: 
his own (Brak&rsquo;n&rsquo;Tune, Bakersfield, California 1990ish and 
California City, California, 1989) plus images by Lee Friedlander (Boston 1985
), Bill Owens ( &ldquo;We&rsquo;d rather play games than watch TV&rdquo;&mdash;
<i>Suburbia</i> 1973), and Lewis Baltz (from New Industrial Parks Near Irvine, 
California). The Baltz photograph brought back the fondest memories. He was the 
first to teach me how, by carefully balancing interior and exterior 
illumination, you could totally flatten three-dimensional space.</p> 
<p>I know just what Jeff means when he writes about how, even though he 
stopped photographing some years ago, photography &ldquo;never really lets you 
go.&rdquo;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been composing all manner of texts, excepting fiction. I 
approached photography much the same way, experimenting with everything except 
fabricated tableaus. Eventually, I&rsquo;d like to be bimedial. That&rsquo;s 
part of what this website has been about. Experimenting with combinations of 
words and images, just trying to see what I can make work. It think there is a 
synergy between text and image that is rarely explored, let alone exploited to 
full advantage.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Being bimedial. What a marvellous ambition. Sign me up, Mr Ward.</p>

<h3>Margaret Bourke-White &amp; online books</h3> 
<p>Jeff Ward wrote:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been radically unsuccessful at anything resembling normal sleep 
for a couple of days now. I was supposed to be on the road to visit my parents, 
but I&rsquo;ve ended up researching an idea. You see, in a few weeks I have to 
start writing a a book. I hadn&rsquo;t figured out exactly what I was going to 
do. The course is &ldquo;extended topics in nonfiction&rdquo; and the quantity 
of writing involved will be massive. I feel much better dealing with something 
I&rsquo;m comfortable with. Photography was my first choice, but specifically, 
what?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll use the blog to string it together first. I like the idea of 
doing it in public; it will be like having advance reviewers. The working title 
thus far is<i>Imaginary Heroes: The Rhetoric of Representation in 1930s America
</i>. Rolls right off the tongue, eh? I began to think of this while reviewing 
significant documentary photography books published between 1937-1941. The list 
was small at first, but it&rsquo;s been expanded a bit with a few books that I 
wasn&rsquo;t aware of until now.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Jeff&rsquo;s list includes <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> by Walker 
Evans and James Agee (of course),<i>You Have Seen Their Faces</i> by Margaret 
Bourke-White and Erskine Caldwell, and<i>An American Exodus</i> by Dorothea 
Lange and Paul Taylor.</p> 
<p>This is a marvellous idea for a book and, given how much I&rsquo;ve learned 
from Jeff&rsquo;s ideas about Walker Evans, I can&rsquo;t wait to read the book 
as it takes shape since Jeff is ideally qualified to write about the 
documentary photography of that (or any other) era.</p> 
<p>For me though, no-one holds a candle to Walker Evans. I&rsquo;ve always 
thought that Margaret Bourke-White and Dorothea Lange are monumentally 
overrated&mdash;the former melodramatic, the latter sentimental, both their 
reputations inflated by virtue of their sex. It&rsquo;s as though curators, 
desperate to include some women from that period in the documentary pantheon, 
had to settle for work which, had it been done by a man, would have been 
regarded as competent but undistinguished. (I have no doubt that Jeff will 
demonstrate conclusively why I&rsquo;m wrong and that&rsquo;s one reason I look 
forward to reading his book.)</p> 
<p>Perhaps this is simply a matter of taste, or ignorance. Although I hold 
Bourke-White and Lange in low regard, I adore the work of their near 
contemporaries Lisette Model and Helen Levitt. When I taught the history of 
20th century photography, the classes devoted to Model and Levitt were 
invariably well-received&mdash;particularly by students who&rsquo;d assumed 
that Diane Arbus was the only important woman photographer.</p> 
<p>I used to devote a class to the work of either one or a pair of 
photographers: Bourke-White and Lange shared a double bill (as did Ansel Adams 
and Henri-Cartier Bresson). Model, Levitt, and Arbus rated a class each. Over 
the sixteen week semester, I&rsquo;d show 21 photographers (11 whose work I 
loved, and 10 whose work I thought was important but didn&rsquo;t much like at 
all). I realize now how I imposed my prejudices on the students but at least 
they were clearly stated.</p> 
<p>No matter how much I dislike Margaret Bourke-White, she took one photograph 
that influenced my own picture-making enormously:</p> 
<p><br>
<i>Margaret Bourke-White: Henlein&rsquo;s Parents, Reichenau,<br>
 
Sudeten Section of Czechoslovakia, 1938</i></p> 
<p>When I first saw this picture, in John Szarkowski&rsquo;s <i>Looking at 
Photographs</i>, I nearly fell over, captivated by the way that Bourke-White 
had (perhaps accidentally) achieved a perfect balance between the interior 
flash and the external daylight, pulling everything into a single plane. 
It&rsquo;s an absolutely remarkable photograph: about picture-making (look at 
all the pictures within the picture, including the windows, as Szarkowski 
points out below); about generations (the portrait 
of&mdash;probably&mdash;Henlein&rsquo;s grandfather on the wall behind his 
father and that of his grandmother on the wall behind his mother, reflected in 
the mirror); and about history (what will become of them when the Nazis arrive? 
Or have they already taken over?).</p> 
<p>Szarkowski writes in the accompanying text:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Bourke-While had an excellent sense of simple, poster-like design, and a 
sophisticated photographic technique, both perhaps the legacy of her 
apprenticeship in the demanding field of industrial reportage. She was excited 
by the new opportunities presented by photoflash bulbs, which made possible 
clear and highly detailed pictures under circumstances that would otherwise 
have been difficult or impossible for photography. The use of two or three 
bulbs, synchronized to flash together as the shutter was released, could 
produce a reasonable simulation of normal interior light. Bourke-While became 
very skillful at this technique, which required especially delicate calculation 
when the level of the interior flash had to be balanced against the level of 
natural light visible through a room&rsquo;s windows. According to the accepted 
formula the outside landscape should be about twice as bright as the interior: 
otherwise the images seen through the windows would look like pictures on the 
wall.</p> 
<p>In the case of the picture opposite, the photographer evidently 
miscalculated a little, but the picture is surely more interesting as it is 
than it would be if naturalistically correct. The two kindly old people sit in 
a room that is hermetically sealed with illusions.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I was so taken by this photograph that I think I may have said to my friend 
Gerrit Fokkema: &ldquo;I will never, ever take a picture without flash 
again.&rdquo; And for many years all my pictures, whether taken indoors or 
outside, used flash to balance the illumination and flatten the picture plane, 
just as Margaret Bourke-White taught me.</p> 
<p>&lt;aside&gt;I&rsquo;m selfishly waiting for Jeff Ward to start writing his 
book online. Ever sinceSteve Himmer and Joseph Duemer discussed writing a novel 
online, I&rsquo;ve been seriously considering writing my own book about 
post-war Japan publicly. I think I&rsquo;ll hold back to see how Jeff 
approaches the activity but ever since he broached the subject my sleeping 
patterns have been shot to pieces too.&lt;/aside&gt;</p>

<h3>The James Bond spy camera</h3> 
<p>Frustrated with my current digital camera (a Sony DSC-S70), I followed a 
link fromScripting News to Ray Ozzie&rsquo;s weblog, where he sings the praises 
of theCasio Exilim EX-S1, &ldquo;the best camera [Ray] ever owned.&rdquo; As 
Ray puts it:</p> 
<p><i>The resolution is perfectly fine for on-screen viewing, it has a great 
flash, it has ample capacity when used with a 128mb memory card, it beats out 
even the Blackberry in terms of its battery life (weeks), and best of all, it 
boots and is ready to snap a picture in sub-one-second. Just works, just right. 
Strongly recommended.</i></p> 
<p>The EX-S1 is a 1-megapixel camera in a stainless steel body that&rsquo;s 
about the same dimensions as a credit card and only half an inch thick. It has 
a fixed focus 5.6mm/F2.5 lens (equivalent to 37mm on 35mm camera).</p> 
<p>The size impressed me immediately&mdash;one disadvantage of the Sony is 
that it&rsquo;s just too big to take with me<strong>everywhere</strong>. A 
greater negative, however, is the Sony&rsquo;s shutter lag, an unfortunate 
&ldquo;feature&rdquo; of most digital cameras. It&rsquo;s impossible to shoot 
fluidly with anything but a digital SLR (where the image is deflected by the 
mirror through the reflex prism to the viewfinder). With a digital camera, the 
image coming through the lens appears on the LCD screen. When you press the 
shutter release, the camera finds focus and the shutter closes (the image then 
freezes on the LCD screen), then the shutter is released. This can take up to a 
second and a half (less if you prefocus, but if the subject then moves you 
can&rsquo;t be sure that you&rsquo;ve focused accurately).</p> 
<p>The fixed focus design of the EX-S1 virtually eliminates shutter lag since 
there&rsquo;s no focusing to be done: everything is always in focus from 1 
meter to infinity.</p> 
<p>I had my doubts about 1-megapixel (the DSC-S70 is a 3-megapixel camera with 
a tack-sharp Zeiss lens) but I was interested enough to track down some 
detailed appraisals of the Casio camera&mdash;Ray&rsquo;s weblog post is merely 
a recommendation from a satisfied owner, not a review that balances the 
camera&rsquo;s strong points with its shortcomings.</p> 
<p>There are two comprehensive reviews, at Steve&rsquo;s Digicams and the 
Digital Camera Resource Page. Both are generally enthusiastic: about the 
camera&rsquo;s tiny size, its acceptable (not great) image quality, and range 
of manual functions. But, taken together, they reveal a number of problems:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>there is no easy way to turn the LCD screen on and off</li> 
<li>the 4-way selector switch on the back is too small to be operated easily 
with a finger tip</li> 
<li>the power button and the shutter release are so close together that 
it&rsquo;s easy to turn the camera off when you try to take a picture.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This could be a perfect example of the old adage: <em>Don&rsquo;t buy the 
first model of anything, wait until they get it right the second time around.
</em></p> 
<p>Nevertheless, I remain interested: the tiny size and no shutter lag make it 
an ideal point-and-shoot camera while the 1-megapixel (960x1280) image is more 
than sufficient for web display, asJeff&rsquo;s image gallery proves (Steve, 
inexplicably, took most of his gallery pictures at the interpolated 1200x1600 
resolution, so that most of them look soft). I&rsquo;ll check one out the next 
time I&rsquo;m near a camera store. Despite my misgivings, I may succumb to its 
obvious appeal.</p>

<h3>Horace Bristol&rsquo;s vision</h3> 
<p>Thanks to Jeff Ward for alerting me to Horace Bristol&rsquo;s <i>Japan</i> 
(a &ldquo;folio of 14-16 page pamphlets bound together in a wrap-around case 
with bone closures&rdquo;). I always considered myself well-informed about 
documentary photography in 30s America but I hadn&rsquo;t heard of Bristol and 
certainly didn&rsquo;t know that he had collaborated with John Steinbeck; nor 
was I aware of his Japan and Korea photographs. I was so taken by the 
&ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; photograph (at left) that I tracked down a copy of the 
Japan book viaabebooks.com and just received an email from the merchant to say 
that they&rsquo;ll ship it to me today. The picture thatJeff reproduced from 
Bristol&rsquo;s Korea book is terrific too&mdash;though I prefer the 
unashamedly &ldquo;staged&rdquo; quality of the Japanese photograph. Given that 
documentary photographs are never transparently truthful, but invariably 
constructed, I admire pictures that acknowledge the fundamental dishonesty that 
lies at their core, even as they pretend to depict &ldquo;reality.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>My kingdom for a 2-megapixel miniature camera</h3> 
<p>My search for a small, fast (i.e. minimal shutter lag) digital camera 
continues. I went to the city to buyMocha Coffee Tim Tams and check out the 
Casio EX-S1 which, contrary tomy expectations, was very comfortable to use 
(given that it&rsquo;s hardly bigger than a credit card).</p> 
<p>As soon as the salesman realized I was a serious buyer, he switched into 
upsell mode and showed meMinolta Dimage X, a 2-megapixel model with a 3x 
optical zoom (the 1-megapixel Casio has a fixed focus 5.6mm wide angle lens).
</p> 
<p>About 50% more expensive than the Casio, the Dimage X makes a great first 
impression. The shutter lag isn&rsquo;t appreciable, I can imagine taking it 
with me everywhere, and the 2-megapixel resolution is a lot more appealing. But 
the reviews all had a consistent theme: innovative design, marvellously compact 
for its feature set, disappointing image quality. Worse still, the camera 
doesn&rsquo;t the memorize flash mode after power off, a major disadvantage for 
someone who<em>never</em>, <em>ever</em> takes pictures with flash.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that the demand for itty-bitty digital cameras is strong. 
Sony has just announced theirDSC-U10, another 1-megapixel camera about the size 
of a tiny mobile phone. Although there&rsquo;s no optical viewfinder, it uses 
AAA batteries and memory sticks (of which I already have three). It might be 
worth a look when it ships.</p> 
<p>If the Casio had a resolution of two megapixels instead of one, I&rsquo;d 
buy it immediately. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to keep looking&mdash;though the 
features I&rsquo;m after may just be too idiosyncratic.</p>

<h3>Silkworms</h3> 
<p><br>
<i>Horace Bristol, Japan, 1949: Mature silkworms being placed on trays
</i></p> 
<p>I collected Horace Bristol&rsquo;s <i>Japan</i> (recommended by Jeff Ward) 
from the Post Office this morning. Just as Jeff suggested, it&rsquo;s a real 
find: beautifully constructed photographs of everyday life in postwar Japan in 
fourteen individual portfolios.</p> 
<p>I picked a photograph from the Silk porfolio, to honor Burningbird&rsquo;s 
insightful review of W.G. Sebald&rsquo;s <i>The Rings of Saturn</i>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Once I had the first key I could then see the second key, the second thread 
that binds the stories &mdash; a thread of silk. Sebald liberally sprinkles 
references to silk throughout the book, as an adult would sprinkle clues for a 
child at an Easter Egg hunt.</p> 
<p>References to Thomas Browne&rsquo;s father being a silk merchant; the 
purple piece of silk in the urn of Patroculus; the silken ropes given to 
Hsien-feng&rsquo;s viceroys so that they may hang themselves, an act of 
benevolence as their sentence decreed that they &hellip;<i>be dismembered and 
sliced into slices</i>.</p> </blockquote>

<h3>Dreams can come true</h3> 
<p>Wanting a small digital camera I could take with me everywhere, I seriously 
considered the Casio Exilim EX-S1, before finally concluding:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If the [EX-S1] had a resolution of two megapixels instead of one,

<p>Now via DPReview comes news that Casio &ldquo;has announced a new two

<h3>Sony does it (yet) again</h3> 
<p>Ain&rsquo;t capitalism wonderful? It looks like my search for a fast, 
carry-everywhere digital camera is over. TodayDPReview published Sony&rsquo;s 
announcement of the four megapixel ultra-compact fixed lens DSC-F77 and 
DSC-FX77 (Bluetooth) models.</p> 
<p>Measuring 92.6 x 71.0 x 27.0 mm (3.65 x 2.8 x 1 in), the DSC-F77 has about 
the same dimensions as the credit card sizedCasio Exilim EX-S2 that was 
previously at the top of my list (admittedly the Sony camera is significantly 
thicker but it&rsquo;s still a light, pocketable camera).</p> 
<p>More importantly, the combination of four megapixels and a Carl Zeiss lens 
ensures that the Sony&rsquo;s image quality will eat that of the Casio, or the
Minolta Dimage X.</p> 
<p>Trust Sony. This news comes a couple of days after their announcement of the
DSC-F717, an update of their DSC-F707 which is generally regarded as the best 
five megapixel prosumer digital camera. And they&rsquo;ve promised a raft of 
new models between now and Christmas. Sometimes I wonder why the other 
manufacturers bother. (Though, if they didn&rsquo;t, it wouldn&rsquo;t be 
capitalism.)</p>

<h3>In the realm of no senses</h3> 
<p>Loren Webster and Jeff Ward continue the discussion on sentimentality, as 
Joe Duemer points to the superb analysis of the sentimentalist warblogger 
narrative atLiberal Arts Mafia.</p> 
<p>Since I hardly disagree with either Loren&rsquo;s or Jeff&rsquo;s 
positions, perhaps this argument is taking place along two parallel paths. 
Whereas Joe pointed out&mdash;and I picked up on&mdash;the connection between 
sentimentality and brutality in warblogging posts, Loren and Jeff argued for 
sentimentality as a valid human response to lived experience (Jeff would use<em>
sentiment</em> as a synonym for feeling). But Joe and I are criticizing (as 
Jeff acknowledged) an excess of unreflective feeling, not feeling<i>per se</i>.
</p> 
<p>And if Loren found himself &ldquo;a little surprised by [his] own actions 
in defending the word&rdquo; and by being labeled a 
&ldquo;sentimentalist,&rdquo; I can only wonder at the irony of my newfound 
guise as the Scrooge of Blogaria, denigrator of human feeling and thoroughly 
unsentimental modernist.</p> 
<p>Fifteen years ago I quit a well-paid, tenured, enjoyable position as a 
lecturer in photography in a university art school because I no longer had the 
energy or inclination to argue with the ideologues who had taken control. 
Nowadays I rarely think about that unhappy period of my life but Mark 
Krupnick&rsquo;s essay<i>Why Are English Departments Still Fighting the Culture 
Wars?</i> brought it back in a rush:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> The usual explanation for the divisiveness in English is twofold. First, 
starting with the invasion of French poststructuralism in the 1960s, advanced 
literary interpretation changed from being formalist in method and 
traditionalist in ideology to a brand of French theory whose major 
distinguishing characteristic seemed to be that it required you to spend more 
time reading the theorists than reading the canonical texts of Western 
literature. The second major explanation for the culture wars is that they 
basically have been about politics, set off when &rsquo;60s radicals took their 
battles from the streets into university departments.</p> 
<p>But the culture wars have petered out in many departments. Why so much less 
so in English? I suggest that the bitterness of the canon wars, and so much 
else in academic literary studies, has had a great deal to do with the kind of 
people who become English professors.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Formalist in method and traditionalist in ideology&rdquo; perfectly 
describes the way I chose to teach photography. In first year it&rsquo;s common 
for photo students to try all kinds of wacky &ldquo;techniques&rdquo; as they 
regurgitate every hackneyed picture they&rsquo;ve ever seen. But, at the 
beginning of second year, they frequently ask a crucial question:<em>what 
should I photograph?</em></p> 
<p>My reply was always the same: &ldquo;Photograph what you love or what you 
hate, what inspires or terrifies you, what you yearn for or seek to 
understand.&rdquo; And I would quote Lisette Model&rsquo;s famous dictum:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The camera is an instrument of detection.. we photograph what we know and 
what we don&rsquo;t know&hellip; when I point my camera at something I am 
asking a question and the photograph is sometimes an answer&hellip; In other 
words, I am not trying to prove anything. I am the one who is getting the 
lesson.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Not surprisingly this was anathema to the theorists and I was frequently 
attacked for holding an idealist or transcendentalist position. Yet my only 
concern was that photography students use their cameras to engage their world 
with passion and commitment&mdash;for me, photography was a primarily a method 
for exploring ideas and emotions.</p> 
<p>Krupnick argues that &ldquo;the role of moral tutor in the United States 
has fallen to professors of English nearly as much as to the clergy&rdquo; and 
I may well have (unconsciously) taken on that role, a photographic variant of 
Krupnick&rsquo;s &ldquo;archetypal English-department academic,&rdquo; who,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>in contrast to academics in other fields, is involved in a quest to know 
himself or herself and arrive at a more intimate relationship with the good, 
the true, and the real. So English professors tend to experience alternative 
approaches to the truth as they see it as a personal affront, and cause for 
counterattack. The personal truly is political.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Rather, I saw the postmodernist position not as a personal affront but as 
rigid, unimaginative, and inappropriate for young students with a relatively 
constrained view of what could be possible in life and in art. Even had I 
wanted to, there was no point in staging a counterattack. I knew I was 
outnumbered when one of my brightest students recounted how Dr So-and-So from 
the Art Theory Department had told her that feelings were a bourgeois illusion, 
that she should work to embed in her photographs references to key theorists. I 
resigned and started working in multimedia and then Web development, not unlike 
Mark Krupnick, who jumped ship to teach religious studies. Again he could be 
writing about what happened in the art school:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> The baby boomers have prevailed. Now there are fewer clashes within 
cutting-edge English departments, because nearly everyone is a theorist or 
cultural-studies specialist. The victors don&rsquo;t always present a pretty 
picture. Baby-boom and younger academics in English often project a sanctimony 
about their secular political-cultural convictions that I never see when my 
Divinity School colleagues touch on their religious beliefs. Their moralism 
strikes me as being at odds with their obsession with intradepartmental power 
plays and their rapt attention to new fashions in criticism and whatever will 
advance their careers.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a story in which there are no winners, only losers. The students 
lost most of all.</p> 
<p><strong>Later.</strong></p> 
<p>Though I started out with Jeff&rsquo;s and Loren&rsquo;s sentimentality 
posts in the back of my mind, the teaching experience pushed to the foreground. 
Not necessarily a bad thing, given their backgrounds and interest in 
literature. I&rsquo;m intensely curious to see what Loren, Jeff,<em>and Joe</em>
 think of Mark Krupnick&rsquo;s essay.</p> 
<p>But I still want to address Jeff Ward&rsquo;s two long posts about 
sentiment, feeling, and sentimentality. I&rsquo;m aware of how deeply my own 
attitudes have been formed by my fascination with Japanese culture and 
aesthetics, most specifically Motoori Norinaga&rsquo;s conception of<i>mono no 
aware</i>, which roughly corresponds to <i>lacrimae rerum</i>, the pathos of 
things (or in Nancy S. Dye&rsquo;s phrase: &ldquo;the fragility and suffering 
that define being human&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write about <i>mono no aware</i> for a while. 
Now I have a good reason to make a start.</p>

<h3>Deflecting reality</h3> 
<p>Joseph Duemer asks:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>how come most of the personification I see in student poems&mdash;which I 
think are a fairly good representation of the culture at large&mdash;strike me 
as sentimental, which is to say, untrue? Is it only because the 
personifications&mdash;of wind, sun, moon&mdash;are so often cliches, or is 
there some further deflection of reality taking place?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Steve Himmer suggests a reason:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I wonder if it&rsquo;s an issue of students having the poetic tools 
they&rsquo;ve absorbed from the canon&mdash;the nature imagery, weather, 
etc.&mdash;but not cutting close enough with them to the experiences 
they&rsquo;re trying to represent. So those standard devices are rendered 
unable to stand in for anything except what they actually are.</p> </blockquote>
<p>When I taught photography, the photographs taken by first year students 
were&mdash;with very few exceptions&mdash;sentimental clich&eacute;s. Finally, 
at the beginning of a new school year, I suggested to the other instructors a 
strategy for addressing the problem. We drafted a flyer and posted it on all 
the notice boards in the department. It read:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>For this semester, the following subjects are declared off-limits to 
first-year photography students:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Closeups of bark on tree trunks</li> 
<li>Shadows cast by sunlight streaming though a blind</li> 
<li>Grizzled old men with silvery whiskers</li> 
<li>Coils of wet rope on sand</li> 
<li>Toddlers with ice cream smeared on their faces</li> 
<li>Nudes</li> 
<li>Grainy pictures printed on high contrast paper</li> 
<li>Portraits in which the subject stares at the camera</li> 
<li>Slow exposures of water running over rocks</li> 
<li>Unmade beds</li> </ul> 
<p>These subjects have been photographed so much over the past few years that 
they are exhausted and in need of a holiday. We expect to see them back, 
refreshed and enthusiastic, in six months time.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>For a few weeks, the students were bereft. They&rsquo;d imagined that 
photography consisted of re-photographing the photographs they&rsquo;d seen in 
books and magazines. But many of them rose to the challenge, freed themselves 
from their habitual seeing, and started to observe the world afresh. The 
photographs they made were marvellous.</p>

<h3>My brush with academia</h3> 
<p>I imagine my &ldquo;overdetermined revulsion&rdquo; (as AKMA might put it) 
for architects results from never having met one I liked.<em>What is it about 
architecture school,</em> I often ask myself, <em>that turns decent people into 
insufferable know-it-alls?</em></p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker, though: I&rsquo;d only have to meet one architect 
I liked for my revulsion to evaporate.</p> 
<p>I used also to loathe post-modernists and post-structuralists, for the way 
they ripped the heart out of art practice, taking something I loved almost as 
much as life itself, and trampling it into a noxious slurry concocted from 
fear, ambition, hatred, French theory, and PC claptrap mixed with generous 
portions of their own shit, piss, and vomit.</p> 
<p>Whenever Dorothea Salo writes about graduate school, I&rsquo;m reminded of 
the university where I taught photography and managed to complete an MA in 
visual arts. I don&rsquo;t know whether the system was particularly slack in 
those days but when I commenced the MA the emphasis was firmly on art practice: 
my obligations were to make photographs, write regular progress reports, meet 
occasionally with a supervisor, and present the finished work in a gallery 
where it would be judged by independent assessors.</p> 
<p>After a few false starts, I settled on a project&mdash;documenting everyday 
life in a neonatal intensive care ward. Although this bore little resemblance 
to my original proposal, I wasn&rsquo;t troubled, since I&rsquo;d always 
believed that art can&rsquo;t be made to a formula but invariably takes on a 
life of its own, that it is possible to exert a fine degree of control over a 
project without necessarily knowing where one is headed. &ldquo;You never know 
where you are with production,&rdquo; said Brecht, &ldquo;production is the 
unforeseeable. You never know what&rsquo;s going to come out.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But by the time I was photographing in the hospital, the pomo clique was 
firmly in control and I&rsquo;d grown used to having my values dismissed as 
&ldquo;idealist,&rdquo; &ldquo;transcendentalist,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;essentialist.&rdquo; (I felt a kind of perverse desire to be castigated 
as a &ldquo;bourgeois individualist&rdquo; but Maoist invective had fallen out 
of fashion by the mid-eighties.) In what must have been an accidental irony, a 
malicious joke, or a deliberate attempt to bring me under control, I was 
assigned the &ldquo;supervisor from hell&rdquo;: an up-and-coming young 
Marxist-feminist with a PhD in post-structuralist art theory.</p> 
<p>I knew instinctively that my project would be anathema, that her enervated 
theorizing applied to the raw emotion of my pictures could only harm me and the 
work. And I was already fragile, since I&rsquo;d placed myself in the most 
extreme situation I could imagine, other than war&mdash;the point at which life 
begins and is immediately under threat.</p> 
<p>Every day in the hospital I experienced moments of unimaginable happiness 
as well as periods of the deepest distress. Every day I saw ordinary people, 
faced with appalling misfortune, behave with the most extraordinary courage and 
dignity. I learned more than I can adequately describe. And I became close to 
people. There was no way I could expose their experience or mine to any 
&ldquo;theoretical analysis.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So I invented a dummy project.</p> 
<p>Out of the hundreds of finished 11 x 14 color prints from my various false 
starts and the thousands of unprinted negatives, I picked one failed project: 
pictures of suburban gardens, artfully lit with a mix of ambient daylight and 
fill-in flash, which I knew she would like&mdash;precisely because their 
emptiness and sterility had been the catalyst for my venturing into the 
intensive care ward.</p> 
<p>I took a half-dozen garden prints to our first meeting and encouraged her 
to tell me how they could be improved. A month later, I showed her another five 
or six photographs, sprinkling a fine dust of theory over the prints as I 
explained how I&rsquo;d put her advice into practice.</p> 
<p>What some might characterize as a performance of breathtaking dishonesty 
and cynicism was to me a strategy for survival&mdash;for which, as it happened, 
I was more than adequately equipped.</p> 
<p>Since I&rsquo;d always been prolific, exposing thousands of negatives, year 
after year, my three months worth of garden photographs looked like at least 
two years work. And because I was relentlessly self-critical, these rejected 
images would easily have gained me the MA. More importantly, after three years 
as a member of the Visual Arts Board (the Australian equivalent of theNEA), I 
was neither shocked nor surprised by the duplicity of art politics.</p> 
<p>So the charade proceeded. Every month I&rsquo;d bring a batch of &ldquo;new 
pictures&rdquo; for her to critique whilst I poured all my time, energy, and 
passion into photographing at the hospital. An hour of lies a month was 
inconsequential compared with the truth I encountered every day in the ward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d booked an exhibition at the Sydney gallery where I normally 
showed my work. Eventually, once I&rsquo;d chosen the prints with the help of 
some photographer friends and written the captions with the assistance of one 
of the nurses in the ward, I piled all the framed prints into my van one Sunday 
morning and headed off to the gallery.</p> 
<p>We held two openings: one for the parents of the babies I&rsquo;d 
photographed and the hospital staff, another for the usual art crowd. The 
photographs were well-received, the reviews were enthusiastic, the show would 
tour to other galleries, the assessors were impressed. To the delight of my 
parents, I got my MA.</p> 
<p>My supervisor never commented on the &ldquo;real work&rdquo; though I heard 
from reliable sources that she hated it. As I&rsquo;ve writtenin another post:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Some viewers thought my photographs were intrusive, that I had exploited 
vulnerable people at a desperately unhappy time in their lives.</p> 
<p>This was not true. I never photographed without permission and was acutely 
sensitive to every agonizing nuance. The only couple to ask that their baby not 
be included later changed their minds as their child hovered on the brink of 
death. For many parents, I had created a record of their child&rsquo;s struggle 
towards recovery and their responses to that struggle; for a lonely few, my 
photographs are the only tangible evidence of their baby&rsquo;s brief 
existence.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Looking back, I&rsquo;m astonished that I got away with the subterfuge. 
Dorothea might point out that circumstances conspired to ensure my success, 
that someone else&mdash;lacking my cunning and audacity&mdash;might well have 
been crucified. That&rsquo;s true. But, once fate or destiny put me under the 
invidious control of someone who lacked sympathy for the work I needed to make, 
I had no alternative but to marshall the resources necessary to outmaneuver 
her. In doing so, I learned that my only loyalty was to the individuals 
I&rsquo;d photographed and the images that resulted from our collaboration. I 
didn&rsquo;t give a rat&rsquo;s arse about my supervisor&rsquo;s opinion, pomo 
theory, or my academic career.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s hardly surprising that I&rsquo;ve constructed myself as the 
(flawed) hero of this narrative. My former supervisor would tell the story 
differently&mdash;and, for some readers (or many), her version might be equally 
persuasive. If I&rsquo;d listened to her unbiased advice, if I&rsquo;d been 
able to put aside my pathological distaste for art theory, if I&rsquo;d been 
really open to experience&hellip; I could have created a work of far greater 
depth and complexity. Better still, I might have continued to teach happily at 
the university instead of resigning my tenured position, splitting up with the 
lovely woman I&rsquo;d been seeing for a couple of years, and abandoning 
photography, thus diving headlong into a midlife crisis.</p> 
<p>All I know is this: at that time, she was absolutely the wrong supervisor. 
For me.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s only recently I&rsquo;ve realized that she could well have been 
precisely the right supervisor for someone else, an insight that depended on 
both the passing of time and my &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; a couple of 
post-modernists and/or post-structuralists I like and respect. Enter stage left:
AKMA and Jeff Ward.</p> 
<p>Whereas once I regarded pomo theory (and theorists) with revulsion, as a 
consequence of reading AKMA&rsquo;s and Jeff&rsquo;s weblogs over the past 
year, I&rsquo;m more open to viewing the world through theoretical (rather than 
purely experiential) eyes. I&rsquo;m also willing to admit&mdash;having 
encountered a variety of smart, engaging academics amongst the faculty of U 
Blog&mdash;that not everyone who works in a university is either a cynical 
opportunist, a ruthless careerist, or a time-serving hack.</p> 
<p>So, when Dorothea attacks academia and Jeff defends it, it seems to me that 
they are each describing different aspects of the same institution, since 
universities are just as subject to Sturgeon&rsquo;s Law (&ldquo;Ninety percent 
of everything is crud&rdquo;) as every other area of human endeavor.</p> 
<p>The Theodore Sturgeon FAQ explains how the Law originated:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In his 1972 interview with David G Hartwell (published in The New York 
Review of Science Fiction #7 and #8, March and April 1989) Sturgeon says:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Sturgeon&rsquo;s Law originally was &ldquo;Nothing is always absolutely 
so.&rdquo; The other thing was known as &ldquo;Sturgeon&rsquo;s 
Revelation.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The first reference I can find in his oeuve appears in the March 1958 issue 
ofVenture Science Fiction, where he wrote:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I repeat Sturgeon&rsquo;s Revelation, which was wrung out of me after 
twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people 
who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion 
was that ninety percent of sf is crud.</p> 
<p>The Revelation: Ninety percent of everything is crud.</p> 
<p>Corollary 1: The existence of immense quantities of trash in science 
fiction is admitted and it is regrettable; but it is no more unnatural than the 
existence of trash anywhere.</p> 
<p>Corollary 2: The best science fiction is as good as the best fiction in any 
field.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>It is this Revelation that has now become known as Sturgeon&rsquo;s Law.</p>
<p>As a codicil, the author of a Spanish web site refers to an old Arab fable 
I&rsquo;d not encountered before:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A young Caliph asked the Great Vizier how he could tell if a poem was good 
or bad. &ldquo;Always assume it is bad&rdquo;, he was told. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll 
only be wrong one time in a hundred&rdquo;.</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> 
<p>Whether one focuses on reducing the bad or adding to the good is probably 
determined by experience and temperament. Either way, if you&rsquo;re 
successful, the end result is the same: slightly less crud, though I 
doubt&mdash;given our moral and intellectual frailty&mdash;that we&rsquo;ll 
ever radically alter Sturgeon&rsquo;s ratio of 90:10.</p> 
<p>All I can say about my experience of academia is that I taught until my 
passion and commitment were exhausted and that in the time I was there I made a 
set of photographs that combined the best parts of me, the parents, children, 
doctors, and nurses I&rsquo;d photographed, and the dozen or so photographers 
whose work I&rsquo;d loved and studied for nearly twenty years. AsJeff Ward 
explained:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Some people would rather sing. In order to be heard, they rearrange the 
language they inherit into something that is unique to them. It is composed of 
the song of others; there is no choice in this. It is novel in its arrangement, 
but not in its themes. It is an engine that creates difference from uniformity.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Because nothing is always absolutely so.</p>
