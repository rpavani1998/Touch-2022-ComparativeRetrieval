you didn&rsquo;t think possible.<br>

Nikon 1 Series Camera 
Announcement. <br>
<br>
 Launching with two cameras equipped with pioneering 
image technology &mdash; the Nikon 1 V1 and the Nikon 1 J1 &mdash; Nikon 1 sets 
a new benchmark for speed, precision, innovation, and portability. Offering the 
world&rsquo;s fastest autofocus system and continuous shot, as well as 
innovative shooting modes, uniquely compact 1 Nikkorlenses and Nikon 1 
accessories, Nikon 1 redefines what a portable digital camera system can do.<br>
<br>

 Nikon 1 V1 <br>
<br>

<h2>Changing everything: Pre-post capture technology</h2> The Nikon 1 range 
has a processor that is many times faster than the most professional cameras 
and this unprecedented speed powers some never-before-seen functions. Equipped 
with pre and post capture technology, Nikon 1 cameras are the first 
interchangeable lens cameras that can start recording images before you fully 
press the shutter button, and continue after you&rsquo;ve clicked. These 
cameras don&rsquo;t just manipulate light - they redefine photography by 
manipulating time, letting you capture those few moments before, or after, a 
photograph was taken.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Nikon 1 J1 <br>
<br>

<h2>Groundbreaking automatic shooting modes: images as never before</h2> 
Equipped with exciting new shooting modes that harness the cameras&rsquo; 
incredible processing speeds and pre-post capture technology, Nikon 1 cameras 
are capable of recording moments in ways offered by no other camera in the 
world:<br>
<br>
 Motion Snapshot (MSS) brings a photo to life in just one 
click. It simultaneously records a slow motion movie and a still image, then 
instantly combines the two to create a photo that moves and captures the story 
of a moment as never before &ndash; a living picture.<br>
<br>
 Smart Photo 
Selector (SPS) captures the perfect moment in any scene; shooting 20 
full-resolution images in the time it takes you to snap a photo: you just press 
the shutter once and, utilising the pre and post capture technology, the camera 
starts to take the pictures before you&rsquo;ve even fully depressed the 
button. Your &lsquo;best&rsquo; five shots are saved based on facial 
expression, composition and focus and the &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; shot is 
presented to you. Never again will you miss the very second a dog catches a 
ball or the joy on your child&rsquo;s face while they are on a swing.<br>
<br>
 
Still image mode will make you a master of movement as you switch to shooting 
sharp, full-resolution shots of the action at up to 60 frames per second[3].<br>
<br> Movie mode opens up a host of advanced movie functions. You can take a 
high-resolution photo[4] while filming a Full HD movie, without interrupting 
recording, or film in extreme slow motion.<br>
<br>

<h2>First of the First: Advanced Camera with Interchangeable Lens (A-CIL)</h2> 
The launch of Nikon 1 heralds more than simply the introduction of a new camera 
range &mdash; it marks the launch of a whole new category that Nikon has named 
the Advanced Camera with Interchangeable Lens (A-CIL). Built to bring 
incredible levels of speed, simplicity and enjoyment to the way you capture 
your world, these portable A-CIL Nikon 1 cameras offer a brand new shooting 
experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Nikon 1 V1 <br>
<br>

<h2>The thinking camera &mdash; Nikon 1 V1</h2> The intelligent, 
iconic-looking Nikon 1 V1 is designed to propel your photography forward. 
Packing a high-resolution electronic viewfinder and multi-accessory port, it 
lets you pursue the moment and capture the unexpected from any location. The 
bright 1440k-dot electronic viewfinder delivers a clear, stable view and 100% 
frame coverage. It boasts a tough body with magnesium alloy (top and front) 
panel and a multi-accessory port gives you the freedom to expand your system 
further with the Nikon 1 range of system accessories. The Nikon 1 V1 is 
available in matte black and high-gloss white.<br>
<br>

<h2>Always a click ahead &mdash; Nikon 1 J1</h2> The quick-thinking Nikon 1 J1 
is a camera that can keep up with busy lives filled with precious opportunities 
to record loved ones in action. Equipped with everything you need to shoot life 
as it happens, this fully automatic Nikon 1 is minimalist camera design at its 
best. Its super-small body is available in a range of colours with compact 1 
NIKKOR lenses to match, and it boasts a built-in flash that offers extra light 
when you need it. It&rsquo;s so simple to use, all you need to do is decide 
what to shoot. The colours are high-gloss white, matte black, high-gloss red, 
silver and even hot pink.<br>

<h2><br>
 CX-format CMOS image sensor with the world&rsquo;s fastest autofocus 
system</h2> Taking its place alongside Nikon&rsquo;s existing DX and FX-format 
sensors (used on Nikon D-SLRs), the all-new Nikon 1 CX-format CMOS image sensor 
is designed for Nikon 1 cameras and the 1-mount. Offering the perfect balance 
between system size, speed, light sensitivity, resolution and depth-of-field, 
Nikon 1 demonstrates superb colour reproduction with 100-6400 (extended) ISO, 
low noise, RAW shooting and 10.1 megapixel resolution, delivering consistently 
superb stills and movies.<br>
<br>
 Equipped with a revolutionary super 
high-speed AF image system that boasts the most focus points in the world, this 
sensor keeps your subject in focus in any situation. If you&rsquo;re shooting 
shiny or moving subjects, it switches to the 73-point Phase-Detection AF 
system. If your subject is stationary, or poorly lit, it will opt for the 
135-point Contrast Detect AF system. Whichever system the camera chooses, the 
quick shot-to-shot turnaround gives you the freedom to shoot moments as they 
unfold, and Phase-Detection AF is available during movie recording for sharply 
focused action scenes every time.<br>
<br>

<h3>The power behind the 1: EXPEED 3</h3> EXPEED 3 is a super-fast image 
processor engineered to deliver unparalleled levels of speed and performance. 
To be as fast as a Nikon 1 camera, you need an engine that can handle speed, 
and this newly developed processor is equipped with two powerful engines that 
can process images at an incredible 600 megapixels a second.<br>
<br>
 EXPEED 3 
is fully capable of managing performance without sacrificing quality, it offers 
superior noise reduction, so you can enjoy clean, finely detailed images. It 
enables the camera&rsquo;s groundbreaking shooting modes, and is the reason you 
can snap a full-resolution photo while recording a movie, or shoot 
full-resolution stills at up to 60 frames per second.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Nikon 1 J1 
<br> <br>

<h2>A new tradition: 1-mount &amp; 1 NIKKOR lenses</h2> When crafting Nikon 1, 
Nikon&rsquo;s engineers didn&rsquo;t just focus on the new. In fact, when it 
came to the new 1-mount, they drew on more than 50 years of expertise: the last 
time Nikon created a totally new lens mount was the F-mount in 1959. The 
1-mount is what allows you to use the Nikon 1 system&rsquo;s range of 
interchangeable 1 NIKKOR lenses. Engineered to ensure each lens communicates 
perfectly with the camera, it&rsquo;s a key factor in the ability of Nikon 1 
cameras to deliver still image and movie recording without compromise.<br>
<br>

 The family of 1 NIKKOR lenses cover practically every type of scene, are all 
optimized for movie recording and boast a compact design:
<ul> 
<li>The extremely compact and lightweight 1 NIKKOR VR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 is a 
3x zoom lens with wide-angle capability. A brilliant lens for everyday 
scenarios, it boasts Vibration Reduction for steady stills and movies, and a 
retractable lens mechanism for superior portability.</li> 
<li>The 1 NIKKOR VR 30-110mm f/3.8 -5.6 is a truly portable telephoto zoom 
lens that gets close to distant subjects with ease. Built-in Vibration 
Reduction ensures steady stills and movies, and you can retract the lens when 
its not in use.</li> 
<li>The ultra-thin 1 NIKKOR 10mm f/2.8 lens is a fast wide-angle lens that 
slips easily into any bag for sharp shots on the go.</li> 
<li>The 1 NIKKOR VR 10-100mm f4.5-5.6 PD-ZOOM is made for anyone who loves to 
shoot movies. Boasting a power-drive zoom switch with adjustable speed, it 
captures video in superb clarity.</li> </ul> And all of this is just the 
beginning. Nikon know that the best lenses lead to the best images and future 1 
NIKKOR lenses are already in development.<br>
<br>

<h2>Expand your system &mdash; Stay compact: Nikon 1 system accessories</h2> 
The Nikon 1 range of optional system accessories help you get the most out of 
your shooting without weighing down your bag:<br>
<br>
 The tiny SB-N5 
Speedlight flash is a convenient way to control the direction and quality of 
light, or get creative with shots by &lsquo;bouncing&rsquo; the flash off the 
ceiling or walls. Compatible with the Nikon 1 V1, it can be rotated vertically 
or horizontally, and a capture illuminator (LED) on the front of the unit 
provides extra light when using Motion Snapshot or Smart Photo Selector in the 
dark.<br>
<br>
 The ultra-compact GP-N100 GPS unit is the easy way to tag 
images on the go. Compatible with the Nikon 1 V1, it attaches directly to the 
camera&rsquo;s multi-accessory port and automatically records latitude, 
longitude, altitude and time as &lsquo;geotags&rsquo; in the image data (EXIF).
<br> <br>
 The mount adapter FT-1 lets anyone use any NIKKOR D-SLR lens with a 
Nikon 1 camera. Compatible with both the Nikon 1 V1 and the Nikon 1 J1, it 
offers limitless possibilities to match a lens to the shooting situation and 
all AF-S and AF-I NIKKOR lenses are compatible with the Nikon 1 autofocus 
system[i].<br>
<br>
 But the complete range of Nikon 1 accessories 
doesn&rsquo;t stop there. A whole range of Nikon 1 branded camera and lens 
cases and straps, as well as lens hoods and camera grips are available to 
protect your equipment and contribute to more comfortable shooting. You can use 
Nikon&rsquo;s external stereo microphone, the ME-1, with the Nikon 1 V1. And 
both Nikon 1 cameras come with Nikon&rsquo;s new Short Movie Creator software, 
which automatically creates short movies from still images, movie footage and 
music &mdash; as well as your Motion Snapshots.<br>

<p>It had to come as some people consider these sort of cameras as the future.
<br> <br>
 I like the look of the V1 with the viewfinder.<br>
<br>
 Canon will 
follow soon I'm sure.</p> <i>Last Modified By franken at 21 Sep 2011 - 8:54 AM

<p>Looks like this is the camera I've been waiting for! Anyone know what the 
multipler is to convert the lens length to 35mm equiv?</p> <br>

<p>I believe the crop factor is x2.7</p> <br>

<p>I need to see samples, if good, very exciting indeed, turns my 300mm F/2.8 
into a fast focusing 810mm F/2.8! Can you imagine!<br>

<p>My best guess is that the crop factor would be 2.7x or something close, 
which makes the lenses:<br>
<br>
 10-30mm = 27-81mm<br>
 10-100mm = 27mm-270mm
<br> 30-110mm = 81mm-297mm<br>
<br>
 Crop factor can be calculated using the 
diagonal of the sensor and compare with 35mm sensor.</p> <br>

<br>Yes, if your DSLR body has a 35mm sensor, otherwise for a APS-C sensor, it 
was already 480mm.</p> <br>

<p>Well it had to happen sometime, Cameras that only require someone to turn 
them on and press the shutter button......<br>
<br>
 Is this really a step 
forward....? Or the bitter end to any imaginative creativity.....?<br>
<br>
 
Who knows, Can't see me liking a camera that has &quot; No Optical &quot; 
viewfinder, That said there was a time when I would never tavel by 
train....LOL... Now I go all over the place by train....<br>
<br>
 Interesting 
days ahead me thinks....</p> <br>

<p>This looks like some interesting game changing ahead- 60fps - at full 
resolution?<br>
 Does the buffer fill up after say 10 frames?<br>
 The camera 
is choosing your best shot :-/<br>
 Why is there not built in HDR at 60fps for 
quicker shutter speeds?</p> <br>

<p>For me it will all turn on whether Nikon's smaller sensor can match the 
1600 ISO noise performance of the 4/3 sensor in my E-PL3 Olympus.<br>
<br>
 
That is about the minimum acceptable in my view.<br>
<br>
 If it can, this 
looks to be a good camera.</p> <br>

<p>10.1 MP? typical Nikon, gives you less &amp; charges you more. <br>
<br>
 
Also typical Nikon, they have to have their own little name for everything. 
Micro (macro to everyone else) DX &amp; FX (full-frame &amp; APS-C to the 
rest). And now A-CIL. They can call it what they like, it's still a CSC.<br>

<br> 60 FPS? isn't that movie mode? What's the point?<br>
<br>
 And as for 
taking 60 shots then giving you what<i>it </i>considers the best? Forget it. <i>
I</i>want to say what <i>I </i>think is best. Aren't I the one supposed to be 
in charge of the creative bits? (God knows, it takes everything else away from 
you). As Vince says, there's no need for a tog with this. Stick it on a tripod, 
&amp; leave it to it. Only problem there is, it can't press it's own shutter 
button (HA!! one up for us mere mortals).<br>
<br>
 It's not thinking, Nikon. 
Machine's are incapable or rational thought. Leave us<i>some </i>room for input.

<p>manipulating time ! does it have a free sonic screwdriver. Nikons bods have 
certainly pushed the marketigng boat over the edge with this one lol , I am 
reading through this many times and still have to be blown away by anything 
other than novelty modes which are new ????<br>
<br>
 Lets just hope Canon are 
announcing a proper camera haha ....</p> <br>

<br>
It does 
nothing of the sort - 300mm is 300mm.<br>
<br>
 If you want the same angle of 
view as an 810mm, you already have it by just cropping your present camera's 
image.<br>
<br>
 Hey Presto, instant 300mm AND 810mm! </p> <br>

THAT is a massive statement - and may well lead to a big 'fall' 
Nikon...</p> <br>

If that's true why would I buy a Nikon DSLR then?<br>
<br>

 It's a good thing the V1 isn't made in Germany, by the way</p> <br>

<p>Indeed - as I do  (Own Nikons )<br>
<br>
 But for a brand-new, 
'never-been-tried' before technology product - AND with a 2.7 CF ??<br>
<br>
 I 
stand behind my comment.</p> <i>Last Modified By Mike Otley at 21 Sep 2011 -

<p>Sometimes all the hyperbole that modern advertising uses is self-defeating, 
as you imply.</p> <br>

<p>Interesting times Would love to see a Canon (or Nikon) body like this with 
an APS-C sensor and 35mm mount - as a direct swap for current DSLR's</p> <br>

<p>I'm confused.<br>
<br>
 What is the actual difference between these two? 
Why V1 and J1 - is one a stills tool and the other a video tool??<br>
<br>
 
Must be my age. Sorry...</p> <br>

<p>As far as I can see, one has a viewfinder and the other does not.</p> <br>

<p>No exposure bracketing or HDR function??? That is a surprising drop off.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned above by several people, There's so much automation 
in cameras nowadays that the photographer can take less &amp; less credit for 
any good results obtained. I won't be buying one of these things.</p> <br>

<p>The main reason for me not buying this camera is that it is probably a 
better photographer than me.<br>
<br>
 When I was in the business I would have 
loved it. Send the camera out on its own to do the job and I just send the bill 
and spend the profits</p> <br>
