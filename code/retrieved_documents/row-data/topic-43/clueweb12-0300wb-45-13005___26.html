Image Quality &raquo; <br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>  The new Ricoh GXR is a camera unlike any other - it's 
not very often that we get to say that! Ricoh have created a truly innovative 
modular system, where you swap both the lens and the image sensor at the same 
time, not just the lens as with a conventional DSLR camera. The GXR is also 
smaller than either a DSLR or the recent Micro Four Thirds cameras from 
Panasonic and Olympus. Can Ricoh succeed with their GXR interchangeable camera 
unit system? Read the World's first in-depth review to find out...<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>It&rsquo;s not every day that a brand new photographic system is unveiled, 
but that&rsquo;s exactly what Ricoh have delivered in the form of the new GXR 
camera. The Ricoh GXR is the World&rsquo;s first &ldquo;interchangeable unit 
camera system&rdquo;. Digital SLR&rsquo;s allow you to change the lens on the 
front of the camera - the GXR allows you to change the lens and the image 
sensor, which are combined into a single interchangeable unit. There are two 
such units available on launch - the S10, which features a 24-72mm zoom lens 
and 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch CCD sensor, and the A12, which combines a 50mm 
macro lens and a 12.3 megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor. Each unit simply slides into 
and out of the front of the GXR, with virtually all of the features of the 
camera body available for either unit. Ricoh are claiming that this new 
approach allows them to offer the best combinations of image quality and 
portability - one of the GXR&rsquo;s key selling points is its diminutive size, 
being much smaller than a traditional DSLR and even tinier than the Panasonic 
GF1 and Olympus E-P1/E-P2 Micro Four Thirds cameras. Compared to Ricoh&rsquo;s 
popular range of compacts, the GXR is bigger and heavier, but not by too much. 
The innovative Ricoh GXR does carry a rather substantial price premium, costing 
&pound;419/&euro;459/$550 for the body, &pound;600/&euro;670/$550 for the 
A12/50mm unit, and &pound;330/&euro;370/$440 for the S10/24-72mm unit.</p> 
<h2>Ease of Use</h2> 
<p>The Ricoh GXR is launching with two interchangeable camera units, the S10 / 
24-72mm / 10 megapixel unit and the A12 / 50mm / 12 megapixel unit, both of 
which were supplied to us by Ricoh UK, along with the VF-2 external viewfinder 
and the clever LC-2 self-retaining lenscap (which only fits the S10 unit). We 
did briefly consider splitting this review into two separate articles, one for 
each camera unit, as the combined nature of the lens and image sensor makes the 
GXR seem like a different camera when each one is fitted, if not from a 
handling point-of-view then certainly from a image quality perspective. But 
there's enough common ground when either is fitted to merit a combined review.
</p> 
<p>The GXR will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has used a recent Ricoh 
compact before, as it inherits the design approach and many of the features 
from the GR and GX series cameras. For everyone else, the GXR is simply a joy 
to use for any photographer that wants full control over their camera, with 
proven handling and a seemingly infinite level of customisation.</p> 
<p>The Ricoh GXR is a wide and fairly slim camera that is a little big bigger 
than the palm of my average sized hands, measuring 113.9 mm (W) x 70.2 mm (H) x 
77.1 mm (D) with the S10 unit fitted, and weighing around 263g without a unit 
fitted and 423g with the S10 (although still not including the the battery or 
memory card). The GXR is bigger and heavier than the GR Digital III, but not by 
as much as you'd first imagine, and it's a little smaller and lighter than the 
Panasonic GF1, the previous holder of the &quot;World's smallest and lightest 
interchangeable lens camera&quot; title.</p> 
<p>Utilising a magnesium alloy body, the GXR is an extremely well-built 
camera, continuing the long-established Ricoh tradition of producing serious 
photographic tools. It has an under-stated, all-black appearance which lends it 
a professional feel. There's a large rubberized handgrip on the front that 
allows you to get a good grip and a small area of the same material acting as a 
thumb rest on the rear of the body. The all-metal tripod mount is the final 
give-away sign that this is intended to be a serious product, although the 
design of the interchangeable unit camera system means that it's not in-line 
either with the lens or the centre of the body.</p> <br>
<strong>Front</strong> 
<strong>Rear</strong> <br>
<br>

<p>As mentioned above, there are only two camera unit options available when 
the GXR launches towards the end of this month (with more promised by Ricoh for 
2010), and we'll briefly consider each one here. You can also judge their image 
quality for yourself on Page 2 and see full-size samples (RAW and JPG) from 
each one on Page 3.</p> 
<p>The S10 incorporates a 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch image sensor and a 24-72mm, 
3x zoom lens. This combination is strikingly similar to the now discontinued 
Ricoh GX100 compact, which had the same size sensor and the same zoom range, 
with the latest GX200 model increasing the megapixel count to 12. Even the 
maximum aperture range - f/2.5-4.4 - is identical! Disregarding any differences 
in image quality, it seems to us that the S10 is almost exactly replicating one 
of Ricoh's existing compacts in the GXR format, albeit in a larger size and 
perhaps more importantly with a much bigger price-tag.</p> 
<p>More interesting is the A12 unit, which has a 12.3 APS-C image sensor and a 
50mm f/2.5 fixed-focal macro lens. This is a unique offering in the Ricoh 
range, and is notably the first ever Ricoh camera to feature the same-sized 
sensor that the majority of DSLRs use. When the GXR is fitted with this unit, 
it's automatically in the same league as a DSLR or the other compact cameras 
that have an APS-C sensor, the Sigma DP1 and DP2. The Panasonic GF1 and Olympus 
E-P1 / E-P2 cameras all use the smaller Four Thirds sensor size, so in theory 
the GXR with the A12 unit should deliver better image quality. The choice of 
the 50mm macro lens is also interesting, in that a focal length of 50mm is 
useful for street photography as well as close-ups of flowers, providing an 
angle of view roughly equivalent to human vision, and the fast maximum aperture 
of f/2.5 is a real benefit for low-light shooting and creating that 
out-of-focus bokeh look.</p> 
<p>In all this discussion about the benefits of particular lens and sensor 
combinations, it quickly becomes apparent that Ricoh are playing something of a 
guessing game with their camera unit offerings, hoping that they've hit upon 
the best solutions for the majority of photographers. That ultimately means 
that some photographers are going to be left out, as Ricoh obviously can't make 
every combination available. With a conventional DSLR, it's inherently much 
easier to change the lens and retain the same sensor - with the GXR system, at 
least on launch, you have to accept the change of both lens and sensor, and the 
particular combinations on offer.</p> 
<p>Personally speaking, I would have preferred to see the S10 use an APS-C 
sensor rather than the tiny 1/1.7-inch sensor - if I'm going to use a larger 
camera than Ricoh's existing compacts, then I'd prefer a bigger sensor with all 
the image quality benefits that it hopefully provides. With regards to the A12 
unit, the 50mm lens is a little too limiting in its outlook - ultimately I'd 
like the 24-72mm lens with the APS-C sensor. As Ricoh release more units, this 
kind of dilemma may become less prevalent, but there's no disputing that this 
is an inherent limitation of their new system that DSLRs don't suffer from in 
quite the same way.</p> <br>
<strong>S10 Camera Unit</strong> <strong>A12 
Camera Unit</strong> <br>
<br>

<p>One other benefit of the interchangeable camera unit that Ricoh is 
promoting is the avoidance of dust on the sensor. With a traditional DSLR, 
changing the lens exposes the image sensor, with dust inevitably finding its 
way onto it. Most DSLRs now employ some kind of built-in dust reduction / shake 
system to try and automatically remove the dust from the sensor, although you 
invariably need to clean it using a third-party solution or have it cleaned 
periodically by the manufacturer. With the GXR, the closed nature of the system 
promises to keep the image sensor dust-free, and I we certainly couldn't detect 
any in the images that we shot. On the flip side, though, dust can also get in 
via the lens barrel, particularly of a zoom lens, so it will be interesting to 
see if long-term users report problems, especially as there's obviously no way 
to clean the sensor yourself, or any automatic dust-reduction system built into 
the GXR body.</p> 
<p>Returning to the camera body, there are four external controls which form 
the creative heart of the GXR. Located on the top right of the camera (viewed 
from the rear) are the Mode dial and what Ricoh refer to as the Up-down dial, 
and on the back is the Adj. dial. These controls allow you to choose which 
shooting mode you want to use, with a choice of full auto, program shift, 
aperture-priority, shutter-priority and full manual, and to control the 
settings of the particular mode that you have picked.</p> 
<p>For example, in Manual mode, by default the Up-down dial sets the aperture 
and the Adj. button sets the shutter speed, providing quick and intuitive 
access. Furthermore, pressing the Adj. dial allows you to quickly adjust 5 
different settings that are commonly used. Press it in to alter White Balance, 
ISO Speed, Quality, Image Settings and the AF Target, which allows you to shift 
the target for AF or AE or both without having to move the camera. Even better, 
the Adj. menu is customisable - you can choose what the first four settings do, 
allowing you to control exactly what you want quick access to.</p> 
<p>A new addition to the GXR is the Direct button, positioned to the far left 
above the LCD screen. When pressed a graphical representation of most of the 
key settings is displayed on the LCD, very similar to the system that many 
DSLRs offer. You can use the navigation pad to move through the settings and 
change them, and the current shooting mode, aperture, shutter speed, flash 
setting, battery life and exposure compensation are also shown. This is a great 
feature the helps bridge the gap between compact and DSLR cameras.</p> 
<p>Continuing the customisation theme, you can configure the GXR and save the 
current settings as one of three My Settings modes, which are accessible by 
setting the Mode dial to either the MY1, MY2 or MY3 option. This allows you to 
configure the GXR for different uses and allows quick access to each 
configuration (the camera remembers the settings when it's turned off). The two 
Function (Fn) buttons on the rear of the camera can also be customised to suit 
your particular needs. Finally, the GXR uses an up/down rocker switch on the 
back of the camera for operating the zoom when used with an applicable camera 
unit (and image magnification during playback), although disappointingly it 
can't be re-configured when used with the A12 / 50mm unit. The navigation pad 
on the rear offers Fn1 and Fn2 settings, both of which can be re-configured to 
(by default they change the focus type and the manual flash amount) and 
pressing up and down increases and decreases exposure compensation. The GXR is 
easily one of the most customisable compact cameras that we've ever reviewed.
</p> <br>

<br>

<p>The Ricoh GXR's 3 inch, 920K LCD screen is the same as the one used by the 
Ricoh CX1 and GR Digital III. Both text and images really come alive on a 
simply breath-taking display that's the best of any camera that we've ever 
reviewed, including those with comparable 920K dot screens. The high resolution 
LCD provides a wide viewing angle and high contrast., with a special fluorine 
coat and hard coating to help prevent scratches, and 100% sRGB coverage for 
more accurate color reproduction.</p> 
<p>If you don't like composing your photos by holding the camera at arms 
length and looking at the LCD screen, there's also another way of framing your 
shots. You can additionally buy the completely removable optical viewfinder, 
the new VF-2. This slots into the hot-shoe on top of the camera, allowing you 
to hold the camera up to your eye and instantly giving the GXR the feel of a 
single-lens reflex camera. It's physically bigger and brighter than the VF-1 
model supplied with Ricoh's compacts, making accurate manual focusing much 
easier to judge. Compared to the direct competition, it's better than the 
Panasonic GF1's viewfinder, but not quite as good as the Olympus E-P2's.</p> 
<p>As the Ricoh GXR offers a full range of advanced exposure controls, it's 
quite complex in terms of its design. There are over 20 external controls, 
leaving just enough room for that gorgeous 3 inch LCD screen. Further appealing 
to the avid photographer in you, the Ricoh GXR has a range of focusing and 
metering modes that should cover most situations. On the focusing side, the 
multi AF system has 9 separate auto focus points, and there's also Spot AF, 
Manual focus, Snap mode (can be changed to focus at either 1m, 2.5m, 5m or 
Infinity) and Infinity.</p> 
<p>The Full Press Snap option allows you to take a photo at one of the Snap 
mode distances with a full press of the shutter button. This means that you can 
use both the camera's auto-focus system by half-pressing the shutter button, 
and over-ride it to instantly shoot at at a pre-determined distance without 
having to wait for the camera to focus. Completing the GXR's extensive range of 
focusing options is Pre-AF. This accelerates the already snappy focusing time 
by following the subject's movement before the shutter release button is 
pressed half way (only works when the focus is set to Multi AF or Spot AF). In 
terms of metering, the multi metering mode is 256 segment, and there's also 
center weighted average and spot metering.</p> 
<p>Multi-pattern auto white balance is a useful setting for scenes with mixed 
lighting - daylight and flash, or fluorescent and daylight, for example. 
Instead of just taking an average reading from the whole scene, which 
inevitably gets the white balance wrong for the secondary light source, the GXR 
breaks the image down into small areas and analyzes and sets the white balance 
for each one. In practice it produces a subtle but noticeable effect that is 
particularly useful for capturing more natural portraits when using flash. Also 
very useful is the ability to change the power of the built-in flash which can 
be set at 12 levels from full flash to 1/64, enabling you to balance the 
intensity for both the subject and background.</p> <br>

<br>

<p>There's the usual choice of Fine and Normal JPEGs, but Ricoh have also 
wisely provided a RAW mode setting. Even better, the RAW format that they have 
chosen is not a proprietary one, but Adobe's DNG format, which means that the 
Ricoh GXR's files are instantly available in any RAW software that supports DNG 
(virtually every one). This is an excellent move by Ricoh, with no waiting 
required for third-party software vendors like Adobe, Phase One DxO to play 
catch-up.</p> 
<p>The electronic leveler is a neat feature that helps to ensure level shots 
while viewing through the LCD monitor, both in landscape and portrait mode. You 
can view the horizontal indicator on the LCD monitor to ensure that shots are 
aligned horizontally. If you're using the external viewfinder, or can't see the 
LCD screen in very bright sunlight, then the camera can also be set to make a 
sound to indicate a level horizon. It doesn't sound like a big deal in theory, 
but in practice it really helps to make all those wide-angle shots perfectly 
level.</p> 
<p>The main menu system on the Ricoh GXR is straight-forward to use and is 
accessed by pressing the Menu/OK button in the middle of the navigation pad. 
There are three main menus, Shooting, Key Custom Options and Setup. Quite a lot 
of the camera's main options, such as image size, sharpness, metering mode and 
continuous mode, are accessed here, so the Shooting Settings menu has 23 
options spread over 3 screens, the Key Custom Options menu has 16 options, and 
the Setup menu has 34 options. Due to the high-resolution LCD screen and 
restricting the number of on-screen choices to 10, the various options and 
icons are clear and legible.</p> 
<p>If you have never used a digital camera before, or you're upgrading from a 
more basic model, reading the comprehensive and easy-to-follow manual before 
you start is a must. Thankfully Ricoh have chosen to supply it in printed 
format, rather than as a PDF on a CD, so you can also carry it with you for 
easy reference in the field.</p> <br>

<p>Ricoh are well known for delivering responsive cameras, and the GXR 
certainly continues that tradition. The start-up time from turning the Ricoh 
GXR on to being ready to take a photo is responsive at around 1.5 seconds. 
Focusing with the 24-72mm camera unit is quick in good light, taking less than 
0.5 seconds, and the camera happily achieves focus most of the time indoors or 
in low-light situations. The 50mm unit is a little slower, with a distinct 
pause as it physically moves in and out before locking onto the subject, and it 
often failed to focus at all on low-contrast subjects. This is perfectly 
acceptable for its main use as a dedicated macro lens, but makes it less 
suitable for street photographer where every second counts. Thankfully Ricoh 
have included a manual focusing ring on this camera unit, which speeds up 
operation if you're used to focusing in this way. You can also manually 
over-ride the auto-focus system by using this focus ring.</p> 
<p>It takes about 0.5 second to store a JPEG image, allowing you to keep 
shooting as they are being recorded onto the memory card, and there is 
virtually no LCD blackout between each image. Shooting in RAW mode is also very 
quick, with the GXR only taking around 1 second to store a RAW image, and you 
can also take another shot while it's being written to memory. In the fastest 
Continuous mode the camera takes 3 frames per second with the 50mm unit but 
only 1.6 fps with the 24-72mm unit, both rates for an unlimited number of JPEG 
or RAW images, which doesn't compare particularly well to even entry-level 
DSLRs.</p> 
<p>Once you have captured a photo, the GXR has an above average range of 
options when it comes to playing, reviewing and managing your images. You can 
instantly scroll through the images that you have taken, view thumbnails (81 
onscreen at once!), zoom in and out up to 16x magnification, view slideshows 
with audio, set the print order, delete, protect, trim and resize an image. 
Level Compensation allows you to correct the contrast and tone of an image 
after it has been taken, and White Balance Compensation the white balance. The 
Skew Correction function alters any photo that was taken at an angle so it 
appears as if it were taken directly in front of you. The new Flag Function 
Setting option allows you to choose up to 20 images that can then be quickly 
played back by selecting the Flag Function Display option, useful for showing 
off key images.</p> 
<p>Images are automatically rotated during playback to fit the current 
orientation of the camera. Pushing the Adjust dial instantly displays the image 
at a previously defined magnification (by default 9.8x), handy for quickly 
checking focus. The Display button toggles detailed settings information about 
each picture on and off, such as the ISO rating and aperture / shutter speed, 
and there is a small histogram available during both shooting and playback. The 
White Saturation display mode during image playback indicates over-exposed 
highlights by flashing those areas on and off. When taking a photo, pressing 
the Display button toggles between the detailed information, the histogram and 
gridlines to aid composition.</p> 
<p>In summary the Ricoh GXR is a remarkably intuitive and customisable camera, 
especially considering that it's a first-generation product in a completely new 
photographic system.</p> Low&nbsp;Price:&nbsp;$349.00 <br>
