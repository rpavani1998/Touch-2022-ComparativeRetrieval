<li> <strong>Pros</strong> 
<p>Compact for a full-frame SLR. 22-megapixel resolution. Large optical 
viewfinder. Bright, high-res rear LCD. Fast autofocus. 6fps continuous 
shooting. Excellent high ISO performance. 1080p video recording.</p> </li> 
<li> <strong>Cons</strong> 
<p>Expensive. Slow focus in Live View and Video modes. No built-in flash. Not 
compatible with EF-S lenses.</p> </li> 
<li> <strong>Bottom Line</strong> 
<p>The Canon EOS 5D Mark III looks a lot like its predecessor on the outside, 
but offers plenty of improvements under the hood. It's a solid option for 
advanced shooters with an investment in Canon glass, but doesn't match the 
rapid-fire shooting capabilities of the EOS-1D X or Nikon D4.</p> </li> </ul>

<li> Performance and Conclusions </li> 
<li> </li> </ul> 
<p>The long-awaited successor to Canon's extremely popular EOS 5D Mark II 
&nbsp;camera is finally here. As its name implies, the company's 22-megapixel 
EOS 5D Mark III ($3,499 list, body only) is an evolutionary upgrade rather than 
a revolutionary one. The full-frame Mark III's&nbsp;improvements are largely 
under the hood, but its larger, sharper rear LCD is one that's noticeable at a 
glance. The camera is quite impressive, but 5D Mark II owners will want to 
weigh upgrading carefully based on their&nbsp;specific needs. The camera 
impressed me, but it doesn't quite manage to knock&nbsp;out the more 
versatile&mdash;and more expensive&mdash;Nikon D4 ($5,995, 4.5 stars) as our 
Editors' Choice for full-frame D-SLRs.</p> 
<p>One quick note before we dig in: If you'll use this&nbsp;camera to earn 
your living, you should avoid grabbing one of the first units to hit the 
street, as Canon has identified anexposure issue that can occur under very 
specific circumstances. This&nbsp;problem didn't rear its head in any of my 
test shots, and&nbsp;since it's been addressed by Canon, it did not affect the 
5D Mark III's rating.</p> 
<p><strong>Design and Features<br>
</strong>The 5D Mark III is refreshingly 
compact when you consider that its 35mm full-frame image sensor is much larger 
than those found in more common APS-C D-SLRs. The camera body measures 4.6 by 
6.0 by 3.0 inches (HWD) and weighs&nbsp;2.09&nbsp;pounds with battery and 
memory card. It's not that far off from theD800 ($2,995.95), its closest 
competition on the Nikon side of the fence. That D-SLR is 4.8 by 5.7 by 3.2 
inches and weighs&nbsp;1.98 pounds&mdash;and manages to fit in a built-in 
flash. If you prefer a&nbsp;more-substantial camera, the Mark III's size and 
weight can be increased via the BG-E11 Battery Grip ($349), which connects to 
the bottom of the camera, and adds vertical shooting controls. The grip can 
accommodate two rechargeable batteries, doubling the operating life of the 
camera, and gives you the option to power the Mark III using disposable AA 
cells for use in those photogenic parts of the world where electricity is not 
readily available.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Anyone with a collection of high-end Canon EF lens will appreciate the 
camera's 22-megapixel full-frame sensor, which is the same size as a frame of 
35mm film&mdash;so your 28mm lens will give you the same field of view on the 
digital camera as it does on a film body. If you're a Canon user who is looking 
to upgrade from one of the company's popular APS-C D-SLRs, like theEOS 7D 
($1,699, 4 stars), you should take an appraisal of your lenses. You can't use 
EF-S lenses, which are designed for APS-C cameras, on a full-frame Canon body. 
This is a limitation that Nikon users don't face&mdash;it's possible to use 
APS-C DX lenses on a full-frame Nikon body like the D4&nbsp;via a special crop 
mode.</p> 
<p>If you've shot with a Canon SLR before, you'll feel comfortable with the 
Mark III's user interface. Rather than taking the front and rear Command Dial 
approach that the other major D-SLR players use, Canon engineers opted to 
employ the front main dial and rear Quick Control dial to adjust settings. Most 
physical controls on the camera control two functions using these two dials, 
and the on-screen menu lets you know which dial modifies which 
setting.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you haven't&nbsp;spent a lot of time behind the lens of a 
Canon D-SLR , it may&nbsp;take&nbsp;some getting used to&mdash;but seasoned 
Canon shooters are sure to feel right at home. There are numerous other control 
buttons on the camera, including a multi-controller to scroll through menus and 
manually select autofocus points, and buttons to adjust the Drive mode, ISO, 
and Metering mode.</p> 
<p>The rear LCD is simply amazing. The 3.2-inch display is packed with over a 
million dots&mdash;it's one of the most vivid that I've seen on any camera. 
There's no problem reviewing your images on a bright day, and it offers enough 
resolution to make manual focus during live view a reality. There's also a 
monochrome information&nbsp;display on the top of the camera so you can 
evaluate the current shooting settings at a glance. You'll also be able to see 
settings in the camera's large, bright viewfinder. It shows you 100 percent of 
the frame, so what you see through the finder is exactly what you'll get in 
your photo&mdash;this is an improvement over the Mark II's 97 percent coverage 
finder. The downside to this improved coverage is that you'll no longer be able 
to change the focus screen out as you can with the Mark II.</p> 
<p>When shooting in Live View or recording video, the camera does support 
autofocus. It does it in a manner like the Nikon D4&mdash;you need to press a 
button and the camera works to reacquire focus. It's a slow process that 
involves hunting back and forth until the focus is locked&mdash;this is much, 
much slower than the autofocus when shooting stills. You'll likely get better 
results manually focusing. There aren't any full-frame cameras on the market 
that currently offer full-time continuous autofocus like our Editors' Choice 
APS-C digital SLR, theSony Alpha 77 ($1,999.99, 4.5 stars)&mdash;that camera's 
pellicle mirror design allows it to use its fast phase detect autofocus system 
for both stills and video in any shooting mode. The Mark III records video in 
QuickTime format in a variety of resolutions and frame rates. It tops out at 
1080p30, but you can opt for 720p60 footage to capture smooth, fast motion or 
1080p24 for those times when you want to give your video a cinematic look.</p>
