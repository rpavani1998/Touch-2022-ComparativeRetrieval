<b> Review 1 of 17</b><br>

<p> Price Paid:&nbsp;<b> $1475.00</b></p>
<p><b>Summary:</b>From my 1st film Nikon Nikkormat,F80,F100, D70s,D50 to D90 
each &amp; every camera was built &amp; produced Top Class. Especially the 
build quality is Matchless. So nothing to fret about since the D90 is again a 
classic &amp; top quality camera in all respects.</p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b>I cannot comment to the Pro's level. As far as I am 
concerned it is very high quality, it's got the Lamborgani power &amp; Rolls 
Royce smoothness.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b>Since I am not a hard core Professional neither I am able 
to find any weakness nor any faults with the D90</p>
<p><b>Similar Products Used:</b>Early days I had used RollieChord, Rollieflex, 
(Twin lens Reflex), Canon AE1 SLR &amp; Olympus OM2 SLR</p>
<p><b>Customer Service:</b>I am In India &amp; when I visited my son in 
Australia bought me the D90 in Melbourne in May 2010. Any where in Australia 
what ever U buy anything for the matter the customer service is #1. Especially 
all the camera dealers, established &amp; authorized camera dealers are 200% 
friendly, pleasant &amp; enterprising persons.</p><br>

<b> Review 3 of 17</b><br>

<p> Price Paid:&nbsp;<b> $660.00</b> from <b>Mifsuds</b></p>
<p><b>Summary:</b>I've used it for over a year now, mainly for outdoor and 
wildlife photography, in the UK, the Falklands, and Antarctica, and it's hardly 
ever fallen short.<br>
<br>
It just always performs and is completely intuitive 
to use. It also has a great depth of controls and features, so you can tailor 
it to your needs and preferences, and I&rsquo;ve done A3 prints from it with 
stunning quality.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve compared results to a friend&rsquo;s D300 
images and we really can&rsquo;t tell any difference, though the D700 images 
have a bit more to them. With that and also comparisons to other friends&rsquo; 
equivalent Canon and Sony systems, I&rsquo;d only ever consider upgrading to a 
full-frame sensor model as I reckon this is about as good as DX sensors can get 
without squuzing yet more pixels on and creating noise issues. and anything 
in-between would be money better spent on lenses.<br>
<br>
The only feature 
I&rsquo;ve &lsquo;missed&rsquo; is a more advanced AF (like the D300&rsquo;s 
51-point AF system) to help with tracking fast-moving wildlife, but 
that&rsquo;s on 1% of the time.<br>
<br>
It feels a bit light and small to my 
taste, especially with larger lenses, but that's soon fixed with a battery grip.
</p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b>Features; build; design; performance; image quality; and 
also price when you consider how much more you'd have to spend to notice any 
significant difference.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b>AF-tracking struggles with fast-moving subjects (the 11 
AF points can constantly hunt and fail to maintain any useful lock... but then 
that just encourages good technique!); and the video mode is too limited to be 
really fun or useful.</p>
<p><b>Similar Products Used:</b>D70, D200, D300, D700,;Canon EOS 40D and 50D; 
Sony Alpha 350 (horrible noise issues at medium-high ISOs and in poor light) 
and Alpha 700</p>
<p><b>Customer Service:</b>Not needed.</p><br>

Thanks for the review! I am seeking to buy a new 
camera and all this info is very helpful! Good tip on the fast moving wildlife 
too! <br>

I also love my D90 but the Sony A350 
has a sensor chip made by Sony the same company that makes the D90 chip. <br>

<b> Review 5 of 17</b><br>

<p> Price Paid:&nbsp;<b> $1089.00</b> from <b>Camerta</b></p>
<p><b>Summary:</b>The Nikon D90 camera is the best one I have ever bought and 
have had some very high end stuff in my life. Technology has come a very long 
way. It replaces the Sony MVC CD500.<br>
<br>
The old one has some great 
attributes the new one does not have. One is the self timer where I can set the 
camera on a tripod, set the timer and stand back to take a pic of myself or 
something. The Nikon does not have this unless you buy at least one option. One 
is the Infrared trigger to set the camera off. And if you shoot inside, you 
need the double shoe option so the infrared that sits in the flash shoe can 
occupy one shoe while the flash the other.<br>
<br>
Another thing is the Nikon 
offers only 3 different size pictures, 3, 6, and 12 meg size in either JPG 
format or the Nikon NKX (or something like that). So this limits your size 
capabilities without resizing every shot. I suppose pro want the most mega 
pixels, but I don't. Smaller sizes work just fine and even make quite 
attractive 8 x 10 blow ups. The 12 meg will make poster size but also will use 
up a ton of disk space to save the pics. The Sony will allow you to set your 
pic size from about 80K standard/160K fine on the low end to 5 meg in 1 meg 
incraments giving you allot of choices. I use the low end fine for almost all 
shots and that works fine. I will have to resize ALL the Nikon shots to 
compress storage size on the hard drive.<br>
<br>
Another is the format type. 
Either JPG or the Nikon file type. If you use the Nikon file type you can use 
their software to manipulate the picture, but a good JPG picture program, and 
there are many even free ones, that will do an excellent job of the same basic 
thing so Nikon format is not needed. I don't see any advantage on editing raw 
format for the JPG editors that are out there. I use CompuPic which works quite 
well. Is not Photo Shop but does everything I want!<br>
I had to uninstall all 
the Nikon software where it simply took over my computer for photos and I have 
other things I use that work just fine, some basic ones are from Microsoft! The 
basic XP platform will 'see' the camera as another hard drive where you can 
copy and paste from the camera to the computer and do what ever. The Nikon 
software is not needed so I got rid of it.<br>
<br>
The Sony makes taking 
movies such a simple task! Just twist the dial on top of the camera to Movie 
and snap away! First snap starts the movie and second stops it giving you total 
control. The Nikon needs several buttons to start the movie and they are on the 
back of the camera making manipulation of movie start and stop a chore that 
could easily, way too easily mess up start and stop portion of the movie. The 
AVI the Nikon takes is extremely sharp, like a high end movie camera so in that 
aspect it is better than the Sony but that is the only advantage. Sony movies 
are fine in MPEG format, the eaze of the Sony makes it a far better choice but 
if you want quality of image the Nikon of course is the better choice.<br>
<br>

The Nikon offers a huge variety of lenses, the Sony has the built in plus a few 
external filter thread screw on aux lenses which work fine for the amature 
photog, the pro of course would frown deeply at that and dive for the Nikon. I 
have several add on lenses for the Sony and they work great for me. One in 
particular is super, is a semi fish eye that is fabulous for inside shots where 
it will take your subject, floor, ceiling and walls side to side getting the 
whole thing, if that is what you want. Any fish eye will distort the image but 
this one does not do a terrible job of it leaving the picture as is with 
distortion all but beyond notice.<br>
<br>
The Nikon I bought came with an 18 
MM to 105 MM lens. This is pretty much a good all 'round lens but others are 
definately needed for more cultured shots. Pictures are sharp as a razor and 
color is more than perfect.<br>
<br>
Batteries are another issue. The Sony has 
a wall powerd charger to a small 'brick' transformer you plug directly into the 
camera. The Nikon has a small wall powered charger but the battery has to come 
out of the camera. Set up in the camera is in CMOS so nothing is lost when the 
battery is removed but is a bit awkward.<br>
<br>
So the Nikon has far superior 
lenses. The Sony is a great amature camera.<br>
<br>
The Nikon shutter launches 
almost in a nano second taking a picture. The Sony has a lag of about a second 
and that makes some difficult shots hard unless you use burst. Nikon has burst 
also so both work fine. The Nikon is better of course because of the speed.<br>

<br>The Nikon is totally manual as were the 35 MM cameras if you choose as well 
as manual. The Sony is manual but not to the extent the Nikon is. The Sony 
requires allot of set up for manual shots, the Nikon is only a flick of a 
switch and away you go! Again, the Sony is best for the amature and the Nikon 
is for the pro where it has all the stuff in a camera a pro will need. The Sony 
in full auto works perfectly as does the Nikon.<br>
<br>
Haven't sent any Nikon 
pics to the printer, but I have a very high end printer so they should come out 
better than Kodak right here in the house. Especialy if I use the large mega 
pix size you should be able to count the cells on a person's arm from 200 feet! 
Ha!<br>
<br>
For all 'round use the Sony takes the cake. For more professional, 
accurate and detailed shots the Nikon takes that one.<br>
<br>
The Nikon uses 
SD Flash Cards for storage which is fast and no moving parts. The Sony uses 
mini CDs which in time will wear out and need expensive service. I have used 
only two CDs the whole 4 years I have used the Sony, they are CD-RW so when 
they get full I format them and start again. All my photos are saved on a 
dedicated hard drive partition and down loaded directly from the camera soon 
after the shots. The camera is used for that, on the Nikon I use a Flash Drive 
Adapter in a USB port to format the cards. Works great!<br>
<br>
So of the two 
which is the better? The Nikon has the advanage but the Sony has definite 
qualities that do not throw it out of the park.<br>

<p><b>Strengths:</b>Superior image quality, hardware durability, Support from 
Nikon. Is all but impossible to beat the quality for the money Nikon will give 
you. Yet the lesser brands will give you options and attributes as standard 
function Nikon will charge you dearly for. You get what you pay for but where 
the competition can do it, why not Nikon? Yet what ever you get on your Nikon 
you will have a superior product that will last you many years.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b>Some functions are very awkward like starting and 
stopping movie mode. To recharge a battery it has to be taken out, another work 
load.</p><br>

The D90 does 
have a self timer which can be set to either 2secs/10secs or custom timing set 
by the user all of which can be used without a remote of any kind.To access 
this function just hold down the middle button on the top right hand side then 
turn the rear wheel until the clock face timer symbol shows in the top 
lcd,adjusting the time delay requires going into the simple menu system and 
selecting your desired time delay. <br>
