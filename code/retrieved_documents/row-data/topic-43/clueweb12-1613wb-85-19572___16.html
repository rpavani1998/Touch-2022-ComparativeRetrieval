<h2>Nikon D3 Initial Thoughts</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve now used my new <strong>Nikon D3</strong> for three separate 
shoots of three separate bands with three separate lighting rigs and my initial 
impressions are very favorable. As many of you know, I parted ways with my 
entire Canon system recently, including the infamous<strong>EOS-1D Mark III
</strong>.&nbsp; Since the D3 and 1D3 are direct competitors, I&rsquo;ll 
restrict my comments to these two bodies.</p> 
<h2><strong>Feel and Handling</strong></h2> 
<p>Compared to the Canon 1D3, the body of the Nikon D3 feels smaller and oddly 
heavy with the 24-70mm attached. The 1D3 has a large squarish grip that 
inspires confidence despite feeling heavier on the left side of the camera than 
the right. With its heavily contoured profile the Nikon D3 feels smaller and 
more dense. Though I irrationally fear the D3 might tip over, the slightly 
smaller footprint gives the camera a pleasant weight distribution that does not 
shift when moving between landscape and portrait orientations.<strong>Though 
they don&rsquo;t look so different side by side, actually holding the cameras 
is a very different experience.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Need protection? Wrap it in Rubber</strong> &ndash; The rubber used 
on the Nikon is soft and thick feeling compared to the hard grips on the 1D3. 
While a soft and contoured grip might seem like a good thing,<strong>I am 
almost positive that the rubber used on the D3 is less durable than its Canon 
counterpart.</strong> Only time and the PH balance of my skin will tell.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Can too many buttons ruin a suit?</strong> &ndash; The buttons of 
the D3 are larger by comparison and give the back of the body a busy look. 
Though it doesn&rsquo;t win any awards for beauty,<strong>the D3 controls are 
very easy to manipulate and can even be used with gloves on</strong>. The same 
cannot be said of the Canon 1D3.</p> 
<p>Where the D3 really bests the Canon is in handling, size and placement of 
the control surfaces, shutter and rear AF-ON button. To my surprise, the front 
and rear<strong>control dials on the D3 can be used to adjust aperture and 
shutter speed without taking your index finger off of the shutter release
</strong>.</p> 
<p>The D3 also features oversized AF-ON buttons on both grips &ndash; a 
feature that is important to anyone who thinks that shutter release and 
focusing are two separate actions that shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have 
anything to do with each other. The Nikon AF-ON buttons have a short throw that 
ends with a<strong>firm stop</strong> when the button is fully depressed. The 
action of the AF-ON buttons on the 1D3 feels<strong>overly soft and lacks a 
clear stopping point.</strong> Furthermore the feeling and position of <strong>
the portrait and landscape AF-ON buttons are different which gives them a 
poorly implemented quality.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Gamepad versus Joystick</strong> &ndash; The multi-function 
controller of the D3 is sort of Canon&rsquo;s joystick and Set Button 
all-in-one. Whereas Canon&rsquo;s joystick is arguably their most immature 
control surface, the multi-controller is arguably Nikon&rsquo;s best. Compared 
to the 1D3, hitting the diagonal focus points on the Nikon is very, very easy. 
(I don&rsquo;t think Canon ever intended the joystick for use on the 1D3 as 
this feature was absent from the camera&rsquo;s initial firmware.)</p> 
<p><strong>The Baby with the Bath Water</strong> &ndash; The placement of the 
Trash Button next to the Play Button is one of the<strong>only things that 
bothers me</strong> about the D3 controls. Did I mention that the Trash Button 
on the D3 is in the exact same place as the Info Button on the 1d3? Without 
going into detail, this coincidence has been initially very unfortunate.</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Wider Throat</strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;m finding that Canon lenses 
are easier to mount on the 1D3 than Nikon lenses on the D3. Some of this is 
certainly because I haven&rsquo;t adjusted to the opposite mounting direction 
but I also think that<strong>the wider Canon EF mount and the little red bumps 
on Canon lenses are a big bonus</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Window on the World</strong> &ndash; Thanks to its 35mm sensor, the 
viewfinder on the D3 is larger and brighter than that of the 1D3. In addition, 
the D3 meter remains active in the view finder when adjusting the 
camera&rsquo;s ISO setting (something that drove me crazy when using the 
Canon). In case anyone is confused &ndash; having the meter active in the 
viewfinder when making ISO adjustments allows the photographer to adjust the 
sensitivity<strong>without metering, guessing at the proper ISO and metering 
again</strong>.</p> 
<p>I also think that the round, screw-type eyepiece and lockable diopter knob 
are nice features on the D3. If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered why so many Canon 
press photographers have their eyepieces taped down to the body, it&rsquo;s 
because they tend to<strong>come loose, crack and fall off</strong>. In the 
very worst case, the eyepiece will rub against your side, fall off and leave 
your carefully adjusted diopter to twist. When you bring the camera up to your 
eye to shoot, not only are you missing your eyepiece but you have a totally out 
of focus viewfinder. Guess who just missed the money shot&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Feel luck Punk? </strong>- The shutter release and the mirror 
blackout of the D3 are clear improvement over the 1D3. Although the two cameras 
are only tens of milliseconds apart in each of these specs, the difference is 
large enough that<strong>almost every Canon photographer</strong> I&rsquo;ve 
let try my D3<strong>is surprised at how quickly the camera acquires focus and 
shoots</strong>.</p> 
<p>Is there a downside? Yes. The mirror slap of the D3 is like a <strong>
machine gun</strong> and machine guns make Baby Jesus cry. The D3 also <strong>
lacks the &ldquo;silent&rdquo; shooting mode found on the Canon 1-Series
</strong>. I&rsquo;m going to miss this feature the next time I&rsquo;m caught 
at a quiet show without my blimp.</p> 
<h2><strong>Image Quality</strong></h2> 
<p>If all else is equal, the D3 is well matched to the 1D3 below ISO 1600. 
I&rsquo;d say that the 1D3 is capable of extracting slightly more fine detail 
thanks to its higher pixel density but Nikon files have a certain three 
dimensional quality that only comes with a full frame sensor.</p> 
<p>Above ISO 1600 D3 images processed with Nikon Capture NX 2 seem sharper, 
lower noise and move vibrant than those of the 1D3 processed with either Canon 
Digital Picture Professional or Adobe Lightroom. Though the 1D3 was no slouch 
above 1600 and there is little quantitative difference between the two cameras 
in terms of noise levels, the advantages of the D3 are clear to even the most 
casual of viewers at no more than 25% magnification.<strong></strong></p> 
<p>While the D3 has a measurable advantage over the Canon in terms of noise, 
saturation, and dynamic range at high ISOs, the difference is fairly 
small.&nbsp;<strong> My (completely) subjective feeling is that the increase in 
image quality at ISO 1600+ is greater than the sum of its parts. I think it has 
more to do with the film-like character of noise on the D3 than any combination 
of measurable factors.</strong></p> 
<p>I am surprised that in some of the worst conditions, the luminance noise 
pattern of the D3 still looks a lot like film grain. Under similar conditions, 
the luminance noise pattern of the Canon 1D3 looks mostly smooth with random 
&ldquo;pits.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2><strong>Autofocus </strong></h2> 
<p>(you knew I&rsquo;d cover this, so quit your whining)<br>
 Looking over the 
full sets from three separate shoots with three separate lighting rigs, I am 
shocked by two things:</p> 
<p><strong>1) how few totally out of focus images there are</strong></p> 
<p><strong>2) how many critically in focus images there are. </strong>In fact, 
there are so few unacceptably focused images from the D3 that the new camera 
has actually made it harder to finish editing.</p> 
<p>While I have no doubt that there are many satisfied 1D3 users out there, 
everyone must accept that I was not one of them. For the record, the problem 
with the Canon 1D3 was not that it couldn&rsquo;t take a perfectly focused 
photo (of which I have many).<strong> It was that it couldn&rsquo;t do it 
reliably.</strong></p> 
<p>My copy of the 1D3 would <strong>regularly</strong> and <strong>
unpredictably confirm focus incorrectly</strong> resulting in a poorly focused 
image. My best guess was that the camera&rsquo;s autofocus system is<strong>
easily confused</strong> and <strong>prone to hyperactivity</strong>. In 
AI-Servo mode, I worked around this problem by reducing the maximum frame rate 
to 8 and turning the cameras focus tracking to the slowest setting. &nbsp;In 
Single-Focus mode I often pumped the AF-ON button to make sure the focus was 
locked before shooting. Even with these workarounds I shot many more frames 
than I needed because<strong>the camera continually demonstrated that it could 
not be trusted</strong>. I am very pleased to say that <strong>I have no such 
problems with the Nikon D3</strong>.</p> 
<h2><strong>What do Inquiring Minds Want to Know?</strong></h2> 
<p>Though switching to Nikon was not without its casualties (read no 
85mmf/1.4&nbsp; AF-S prime yet), I am very happy with my decision. If there is 
anything that I did not cover in this initial review, I&rsquo;d happy write 
some more.</p> 
<p>Want to condemn me for my brand disloyalty in a public forum? That&rsquo;s 
fine too. =)</p> <br>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts comparing these two cameras and their systems. I 
think Nikon and Canon have very different design philosophies that play out in 
their flagships, and it&rsquo;s interesting to get your perspective on them.</p>

<p>i know the canon has 40 something af points, and d3 has 51. is it helpful 
having extra af points? do you typically use all 51 or do you prefer to use 
less? have you tried the 3d tracking feature? i find it a bit unpredictable but 
then again my camera is such a baby compare to d3 not to mention that i got no 
skill haha.</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>Chris,&hellip;this was a nice read on two strong workhorses of the digital 
capture industry. Note, that I did learn one thing from this,&hellip;and that 
is the ability to change SS and Ap while maintaining your index finger on the 
SR button. I tried it with my D3 and was able to do this&hellip;though it felt 
a little brainey for a second or two. I will now practice this techique and 
make it second nature.</p>

<p>very nice review, I went the same way you did a year ago, though from two 
markIIns. You kinda hit every thing that I observed back then. When I had my 
first day with the MarkIIs I lost an eyecup because I thought that when it was 
so new it would be tight&hellip; no way. Replacement eyecups must be canons 
largest export.</p>

<p>Regarding lenses, I would anticipate that, following the new 50mm f/1.4, an 
AF-S 85mmm f/1.4 should be coming down the pipe in the next year.</p> 
<p>That, and a wide-ish fast prime, and more distantly, perhaps an AF-S 
portrait lens like a 105/2 or 135/2.</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>I really liked reading your comments here, Chris. When I was deciding to 
ungrade recently I went with the D300 and I am really happy with Nikon&rsquo;s 
line of bodies and lenses out right now. Not to say Canon stuff completely 
blows, I just like the physical interface of the Nikon gear. Glad you&rsquo;re

<p>Hi Chris, this is a great article. This is probably one of the best 
articles I&rsquo;ve come across comparing the two high-end cameras. Btw, was 
your 1D3 from the faulty batch, or the AF was fixed already yet you still found 
it to be under-performing?</p> 
<p>Would like to find out more about the colour of the images that are 
straight out of the camera, for example when both cameras are on Standard 
preset or Neutral preset.</p> 
<p>And also flash performance between the 1D3 and the D3?</p>

<p>Thanks Chris for the very detailed reply! :)</p> 
<p>I do agree on the Canon flash being somewhat inconsistent. I&rsquo;m 
currently a Canon shooter, but am seriously considering to switch over to Nikon 
because I kind of prefer its out-of-camera color rendition (could you share a 
bit more about the D2X color as well?) and the better flash system.</p> 
<p>Autofocusing speed wise, is the D3 comparable to the 1DM3, be it center 
point alone, side points (non-cross points) and all 51 points activated? I 
haven&rsquo;t handled Nikon extensively but the Canon AF seems quite a bit 
snappier to me, especially under bright conditions. My apologies for throwing 
so many questions here!</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>I just switched from a Canon system to a Nikon D3. I have never had a 
camera that can focus so quickly and stay focused no matter the situation. I 
shoot sports and this is the only camera that gets the job done.</p> 
<p>I have used Canon equipment for over 20 years. this was an expensive change 
but it appears that I made the right decision.</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>Love the article Chris, although I am a Nikon shooter for the past who 
know&rsquo;s, I had the opportunity to shoot the D3 for a youth ice hockey 
tournament and was blown away because using only my 2.8 300mil, switching from 
FX format to Dx was a god blessing.<br>
 That D3 was a rental cause I had drop 
my 2.8 300mm- D2hs gear on ciment floor stadium seatings&hellip;.Yeah, My back 
up rig was my 2.8 400mm on a D200! THAT was a lousy set up for that 
kind&rsquo;a job :(<br>
 The D3 was set so a hold on the bottom front button 
and the back wheel it went from normal 24 X 36 to crop DX without putting the 
camera down.<br>
 That took me about 2 seconds to master and on it went&hellip;.
</p> 
<p>Besides, you&rsquo;ve got to drool for that 200-400 f4 too!</p> 
<p>Good reading</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad I stumbled upon this article. I am planning to get a new 
camera (to upgrade my uber outdated Canon 350D) and have been debating between 
the Canon 5D Mark II and the Nikon D700.<br>
 I&rsquo;ve spoken to one other 
person who has converted from a 5D Mark II to a D700 and am getting more 
convinced to get the D700 because it&rsquo;s better for shooting portraits esp. 
in low light.<br>
 I realise you have a different Nikon camera, but if you 
don&rsquo;t mind convincing me a bit more to chose Nikon over Canon, I&rsquo;d 
really appreciate it.</p> 
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

<p>I am also in the middle of making the switch from Canon to Nikon. While I 
shot Nikon and other brands of film cameras prior digital, when digital came 
along I moved the Canon 1D. At the time I felt it offered me the most for my 
money and had the features I preferred. Of course I do not think there is any 
disputing that image quality of the original 1D was first class for its time 
period.</p> 
<p>I have to say to anyone considering doing the same, it is an expensive 
proposition to consider making the switch if you have pro bodies and glass. Of 
course when you buy an upper end body, you know that the value drops 
significantly with every new model released.</p> 
<p>So far I have sold my Canon 1D, 5D, and I currently have an offer on my 
1DMKII. In addition I have sold off an E0S-3 that I picked up just because I 
like to keep a film body and the E0S-3 Eye focus always drew my interest. I 
even had an E-1 body I let go in addition to my 2 Canon Flashes and ST-E2 lens. 
I have also sold two lenses, and now I have my L glass to sell which does 
include a 300mm 2.8 Non IS L lens. I shoot a lot of sports but I am diversified 
in what I shoot.</p> 
<p>I decided on the D700 because it seems to offer the best of the D3 and 
still would offer me the focus speed that I enjoyed with my 1D and 1DMKII. Also 
the fact that I can increase the FPS by adding the grip made a lot of sense to 
me when I need that feature. I know from my experience I rarely shoot at 8fps 
unless I am looking to capture a quick sequence, so the 3 to 5fps is more than 
adequate. What I also realize is that the shot to shot time is on of the most 
important things to me so there is a grip in my future.</p> 
<p>So far I have purchased the D700 and a 50mm 1.4G AFS just to make sure I 
like the camera and solidify the commitment. I have had the camera 2 days and 
so far I am very comfortable with my decision. I held off selling all my L 
glass just until I reach a comfort zone but I think I am getting there.</p> 
<p>The new Nikon lenses with the Nano coated are expensive compared to what I 
originally paid for my Canon glass. I know both companies recently raised 
prices on glass. I can say at least Nikon offers a 5 year warranty on their 
glass compared to the 1 year from Canon. My lens list consists of the 14-24, 
28-70, 70-200 AFS VRII, and down the road the 200-400. I will probably end up 
with a 105mm as well because by the time you add the 1.3 multiplier for the 1D 
sensor you get pretty close.</p> 
<p>While I know the 1DMKIV is on the horizon, I am of the opinion that Nikon 
is the best way to go for me. The fact that Nikon has finally gone full frame, 
put the work into improving their lens technology, and improving their focusing 
system. So far I have found the D700 features highly adjustable and I do look 
forward to what I feel is more accurate metering and flash system that Nikon 
provides.</p> 
<p>Sorry about the long winded post, but this was a huge decision for me to 
make and yes it is costing me money to make the switch but I feel confident it 
will be worth in the end in the enjoyment and image quality that I will be able 
to achieve in the end.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thorough comment Jason. If it makes you feel any more 
comfortable with your decision, in the 13 months I&rsquo;ve been using Nikon 
I&rsquo;ve not once thought about switching back to Canon. Not once. Not even 
for the 1Dmk4.</p> 
<p>When I switched from Canon to Nikon I effectively lost one lens in the 
shakedown. It took a me couple of months to replace it (using rentals to bridge 
the gap).</p> 
<p>My current lineup is similar to your wish list:</p> 
<p>14-24mm<br>
 24-70mm<br>
 70-200mm VRII</p> 
<p>I would also eventually love to buy the 200-400mm. I&rsquo;ve used it about 
3 times for one-off assignments and it&rsquo;s just awesome. Light, sharp and 
responsive.</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>Hi Chris,</p> 
<p>I have a 1D Mark III and I use it with either a 24-70 or a 70-200 IS both 
f2.8.</p> 
<p>How do I compensate in camera for the overly saturated skin tones which 
tend to be too red and orange at times inspite of a custom white balance. I 
have read somewhere that one way is to use a cc filter. But which one? How do I 
determine which one to use and when? Is there another atlternative to resolving 
this inherent problem with the Canon Pro body?</p> 
<p>I shoot portraiture and color is critical to the service I provide. Let me 
know your thoughts&hellip; Thanx in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Angel, a lot of the color reproduction depends on which color space 
you&rsquo;re shooting in (Adobe RGB or sRGB), the color profile you&rsquo;ve 
set up on your camera (portrait, standard, neutral) and the program 
you&rsquo;re using to process the RAW files.</p> 
<p>If you can send me an email via the contact form with this info and a 
sample image, I may be able to help.</p>

<p>Hi Todd, thanks. I defintely agree that Nikon and Canon have two very 
different philosophies at work. They old statement that goes something like 
&ldquo;Nikon cameras are built for photographers by photographers and Canon 
cameras are built for photographers by engineers&rdquo; still holds true in a 
lot of the little details.</p> 
<p>Canon ergo made a huge leap forward with the 40D and 1D3. For instance, I 
think Canon has a nicer menu layout and a better AF selection system when using 
only 9 points.</p> 
<p>I would even go so far as to say that I was shocked by how bad 
Nikon&rsquo;s menus still looked the first time I turned on the D3.</p> 
<p>One of the first things I did with the D3 was set up the customizable My 
Menu to exactly mirror the list of settings I had in the Canon My Menu. However 
I soon found that I didn&rsquo;t have to change the same settings because the 
Nikon was doing more for me without the small tweaks. My Canon My Menu had 
about 8 settings that I changed fairly regularly. My Nikon My Menu has only 3 
(Toggle AF-ON, Format Card and Battery Info).</p> 
<p>Some additional things I love about the D3 vs. the 1D3 are:</p> 
<p>1) That the focus mode can be changed from Single to Continuous with one 
finger without lowering the camera.</p> 
<p>2) That the focus pattern can be changed to single with one finger without 
lowering the camera.</p> 
<p>3) That you can bracket with the shutter speed when shooting in manual mode.
</p> 
<p>4) That half pressing the shutter will lock exposure when using spot 
metering.</p> 
<p>5) That changing the AF point, shutter speed and aperture are all one step 
operations.</p> 
<p>6) That the camera will confirm focus in both single and continous focus 
modes.</p> 
<p>7) That there no difference in AF accuracy between single and continuous 
mode when shooting a static subject.</p> 
<p>8) That the LCD can be used to confirm critical focus at 100% magnification.

<p>Hi John. The Canon has 45 points, but only 19 of them are user selectable 
and f/2.8 spec. All 51 points of the Nikon array are user selectable but only 
15 are f/2.8 spec.</p> 
<p>That being said, I haven&rsquo;t found any benefit to actually using all 51 
points for concert photography even though I have all of them turned on.</p> 
<p>In practice I really only need 9 points that are accurate when focusing at 
f/2.8. If you&rsquo;re shooting slower than f/2.8 a lot of people will say you 
only need 1 accurate point.</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>Thanks for your comments JMD. I know using your middle finger to turn the 
front dial could feel a little odd at first but it can come in handy when you 
don&rsquo;t have a millisecond to spare. The first time I did this, it was an 
accident. I was in a panic to get the shot and put my fingers in the 
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; position.</p> 
<p>The decision to switch wasn&rsquo;t an easy one, but I had to make the 
choice I felt was better for the work (and my business) in the long run. The D3 
is the most versatile 35mm camera on the market right now and for the 
photographer that shoots a little bit of everything, it&rsquo;s damn close to 
perfect.</p>

<p>Thanks Rumle (I love your gravatar btw).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit curious why you sold off your MarkIIns. I always regarded 
that camera as one of the best sports bodies ever made. To support this, 
I&rsquo;ve met a few press and sports photojournalists who tried the 1D3 and 
went back to the 1D2mkIIn. Best, Chris</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>I think the story with updated Nikon primes is a matter of 
&ldquo;when&rdquo; and not &ldquo;if.&rdquo; I think we&rsquo;ll definitely see 
the 85mm soon and I would hope something like a 23mm as well.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad that Nikon tends to sit on this things.</p> Log in to

<p>Hi Keith, thanks for the note.</p> 
<p>I think that Nikon has a great thing going with their lineup right now. 
From the D300/D700/D3/D3x, they&rsquo;ve got a ton of things covered.</p> 
<p>The best thing about all of these camera bodies is how similar they are in 
terms of performance and features. For instance, they didn&rsquo;t leave the 
&ldquo;cool stuff&rdquo; out of the D300 just because it&rsquo;s not the 
&ldquo;flagship&rdquo; model. Gotta love it. (I sure do.)</p> Log in to Reply

<p>Thanks Wayne. I&rsquo;m fairly sure my 1D3 was part of the faulty batch. 
However the problems I experienced with the AF had very little to do with the 
&ldquo;bright and sunny&rdquo; conditions that the &ldquo;fix&rdquo; was 
supposed to address. It was definitely still underperforming.</p> 
<p>My feeling was that the ground-up redesigned AF that Canon put into the 1D3 
and 1Ds3 was just a lemon, fix or no fix.</p> 
<p>There is still a difference in the color of the images straight out of the 
camera but it&rsquo;s not the huge difference that existed one generation ago. 
I did not for instance love the color rendition of the D2x.</p> 
<p>Nikon&rsquo;s color came closer to Canon with the D300/D700/D3/D3x and 
Canon&rsquo;s color came a bit closer to Nikon. If I had to characterize the 
color bias of each camera it would be as follows:</p> 
<p>Canon cameras are bias towards redish tones. I would characterize Canon 
skintones as generally &ldquo;pink.&rdquo; I would often shoot on the neutral 
picture style as I thought standard was too contrasty and too red for me.</p> 
<p>Nikon cameras are slightly bias towards orange in terms of skin tones. 
Under Auto White Balance skin tones tend to have a warm look. I also find that 
greens and blues are slightly more saturated. I tend to shoot on Stardard.</p> 
<p>The flash performance between the 1D3 and D3 will vary wildly depending on 
what flash you have on top.</p> 
<p>I used the 1D3 with the 580EX II and the CPE4 Battery pack. The 580EX II is 
a very good flash with plenty of power. The combo worked well for the most part 
but would sometimes overexpose the subject at random. I never figured out why 
this was. The metering was also confused by reflective surfaces in the 
background. A number of professional photographers I know much prefered the 
original 580EX to the mark II because they felt that the original was more 
durable. They also liked that it was far less complicated to use in 
Master/Slave modes.</p> 
<p>Part of this could have been user error as well. One of the things that 
drove me crazy about the metering on the 1D3 was that you could not get the 
shutter to lock the metering in spot or center weighted modes. So even though 
you could link the spot meter to whatever AF point you were using at the time, 
you had to keep that AF point exactly on skin to get a properly exposed shot. 
This was particularly hard when tracking a moving subject like a groom in a 
black/white tux. Yuck.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re using an SB900, the flash system on the D3 is great. Unlike 
other Nikon flashes the 900 can be rotated 180 degress in both directions. The 
exposure is extremely accurate and the character of the light is amazing. 
It&rsquo;s got approximately double the power of the SB600 and in some 
circumstances, the flash is actually overpowered. The best thing about the 
SB900 is that it&rsquo;s dead simple to set up the master/slave settings.</p>

<p>Hi Wayne,</p> 
<p>I think out of camera color rendition is totally a matter of personal 
preference. I personally found D2x color a little too cool and magenta for me. 
By contast the 1D3 was considerably warmer, especially in the reds. I&rsquo;m 
loving the out-of-camera color on the D3.</p> 
<p>Nikon autofocus speed might be very slightly slower on the very first 
acquisition, but it&rsquo;s dead reliable and dead-on accurate which is more 
than I could say about my 1D3 even in the best conditions.</p> 
<p>In addition, the shutter release and mirror blackout are faster on the D3 
which more than makes up for any techical difference.</p> 
<p>Technical specs aside the best thing about the Nikon AF system is 
it&rsquo;s character. I find that the Nikon AF system gives much better 
feedback than Canon. The Nikon lenses tend to &ldquo;snap&rdquo; rather than 
&ldquo;ease&rdquo; into place when the AF locks on. The snap is strong enough 
that you can feel it in the finges of your left hand when holding the lens. The 
Nikon AF system is also much more reliable when shooting stationary subjects 
using Servo focus.</p> 
<p>One of the things that drove me crazy about using the 1D3 on Servo focus 
was that it was very hyper reactive. A burst of 5 frames focused on a 
stationery subject using the 1D3 in Servo focus would often return 5 different 
focus solutions with only 1 critically sharp. Canon&rsquo;s technical advice in 
this regard was to &ldquo;dumb it down&rdquo; by lowering the max FPS and 
lowering the focus sensitivity.</p> 
<p>The D3 will confirm focus in the viewfinder in Single and Servo focus 
modes. Canon only confirms in Single.</p> 
<p>A few days after using the D3 I was surprised by how well the camera works 
right out of the box. No tinkering, no adjustments, just pick it up and shoot.
</p> 
<p>Since switching brands is so costly and there are definitely upsides to 
using Canon, I would rent or borrow a D3 with one of the new zoom and use it 
for a couple of days before making any snap decisions.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t apologize for asking questions, I&rsquo;m happy to answer them.

<p>Hi Izzy,</p> 
<p>Thanks for the comment. I would love to hear your reasons for switching to 
Nikon after 20 years. I really admire sports photographers &ndash; you guys 
know what the players are going to do before they do it &ndash; amazing.</p> 
<p>I am also impressed by the tenacity of the D3 servo-focus system. There are 
times when I&rsquo;ve shot a quickly moving performer and I&rsquo;m sure that I 
missed the shot. When I look at the photos later, low-and-behold, the D3 nailed 
it.</p> 
<p>The D3 autofocus performs better than I previously thought was possible. 
It&rsquo;s almost magic.</p> Log in to Reply <br>

<p>Hey Eric,</p> 
<p>I have my FX/DX toggle on Back Button/Front Wheel and it&rsquo;s awesome.
</p> 
<p>The 200-400 would be my next lens purchase if I had $6K to throw around =)

<p>Hi Aisha,</p> 
<p>The Nikon D700 and Canon 5Dmk2 are very different cameras. The D700 is a 
better camera in almost every single regard except for resolution and video 
capability.</p> 
<p>My disappointment with the 5Dmk2 was THE REASON I switched to Nikon from 
Canon. Mainly, I was angry that they put such a crappy autofocus system into 
it.In my opinion, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have an 85 f/1.2 lens and a 
25mp photo if it&rsquo;s out of focus because the camera screwed up.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re taking a lot of portraits in low light, then the D700 and 
the right lenses will definitely focus more accurately than the 5Dmk2.</p> 
<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s hard for me to advise you without knowning how 
much Canon equipment you own. If you own a lot of Canon lenses and accessories, 
you might not want to switch. Even if the focus isn&rsquo;t the best, the 5dmk2 
would be a huge improvement over your 350D any day.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d be happy to answer your specific questions over email.</p>
