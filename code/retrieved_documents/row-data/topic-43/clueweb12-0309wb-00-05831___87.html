<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p><em>&ldquo;There was a little girl, and she had a little curl, right in the 
middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was VERY VERY good - and when 
she was bad, she was HORRID.&rdquo;</em> - Nursery rhyme</p> 
<p>The Leica Digilux 2, and its Panasonic twin, the DMC-LC1, are an 
interesting exercise in digital camera design and ergonomics - in essence, a 
throwback to the shape and handling and analog controls of mechanical 35mm 
cameras from the last half of the 1900s. As an operating tool in the hand, the 
Digilux 2 is very successful. There are many shooting situations where being 
able to scale-focus the lens, or set the shutter speed on a dial - even before 
the camera has been turned on - greatly simplify and speed up operation, 
compared to the push-here-while-twirling-that-and-watching-the-LCD controls 
common on most non-SLR digicams. The Leica-designed lens is almost supernatural 
in its ability to define details and separate tones and colors, and pushes 
right to the limits of what 5 megapixels can record - a bonus I wasn&rsquo;t 
even expecting.</p> 
<p>So ideally, I&rsquo;d start this review with the controls and handling and 
lens, because they are so distinctive.</p> 
<p>But as a reviewer, I have an obligation to point out the worst features of 
the Digilux first - the HORRIDS. If you get past these and are still 
interested, then we can have fun with the camera&rsquo;s good side - which is 
occasionally amazing.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>THE HORRID</h2> 
<p>No RAW buffer</p> 
<p>The Digilux 2 can save pictures in a RAW format. And it does have built-in 
memory of about 11 megabytes or so. Enough to handle a burst of three 
&ldquo;finest&rdquo; Jpegs (3.4 Mb each) in a little over a second before it 
has to pause and write to the memory card. But a Digilux RAW file is 9.6 
megabytes, so it fills that memory with one picture, requiring a pause after 
every exposure. The &ldquo;hang time&rdquo; varies according to the capacity 
and speed of the memory card in use: 5 seconds or so for a fast type II 512Mb 
SD card, up to as long as 13 seconds on the 64Mb SD card that comes with the 
camera. Six seconds on my &ldquo;regular&rdquo; 256Mb Lexars. So - you can 
shoot fast, or you can shoot RAW. Not both.</p> 
<p>As a photojournalist, I&rsquo;d rather shoot jpegs anyway, as much for the 
time savings at the computer after the fact as those during shooting. A RAW 
workflow is like the Zone system - a brilliant tool for some kinds of 
photography, just not mine. But combined with the next issue, the lack of a 
fast RAW buffer has been a &ldquo;deal-killer&rdquo; for many photographers who 
might really like to work with the camera otherwise.</p> 
<h2>Excessive noise reduction in ISO 200/400 JPEGS</h2> 
<p>When shooting JPEGS at ISO 200/400, the Digilux 2 employs a rather 
heavy-handed noise reduction routine. In Photo.net&rsquo;s review of the 
Digilux 1 people spoke of a &ldquo;Seurat filter&rdquo;. Well, this is more of 
a &ldquo;Cezanne filter&rdquo; - as though a palette knife had been scraped 
over the light tones in the image. Does a great job at removing noise. 
Unfortunately, it removes a lot of fine detail as well. And it mostly affects 
the lighter tones, whereas the strongest noise is in the shadows. Ooops! You 
end up with smeared highlights, noisy shadows, and a weird transition area 
between the two.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I queried Leica about what was going on here: Intentional noise reduction? 
Accidental JPEG artifacts? If it seems odd to ask for a manufacturer&rsquo;s 
comment in a review, I guess it&rsquo;s just my journalistic background - you 
ALWAYS try to get both sides. Here are the key points of their response, edited 
for space:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<em>Some noise at ISO 400 is not unusual for digital cameras. We 
tried to get a perfect colour management, sharpness and contrast but it is 
impossible to avoid completely noise....Image quality depends from the 
adjustments (colour, contrast, noise, sharpness). If you change the 
colour-management than you change automatically other settings or if you reduce 
the noise it could be that the images will not have the typical Leica 
sharpness. You can compare the effect with a 400 or 800 ISO film at the 35mm 
format. At 400 ISO there is a higher sensitivity. It is not a effect of jpeg 
compression. We are aware that noise is an issue so that we try more than our 
best to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; improve the technological and optical performance in 
future</em>.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Reading between the lines, I get the impression that Leica (or Panasonic, 
or both) was overly concerned with noise. They sort of ignored the fact that I 
was asking about the noise REDUCTION, not noise per se. Perhaps they were 
panicked by the hits the Sony 828 has taken on the subject - and overdid the 
noise suppression as a result. As a photojournalist, I&rsquo;d prefer 
&ldquo;sharp and noisy&rdquo; to &ldquo;blurry and noiseless&rdquo;. Or at 
least the option to choose for myself. There are workarounds, which I&rsquo;ll 
get into later. The most obvious one is to shoot RAW files, which bypass all 
&ldquo;in-camera&rdquo; firmware processing, and thus the noise supression. But 
get you back to the long delays between exposures.</p> 
<p>And if a camera has a bug that requires workarounds - it&rsquo;s still a 
bug.</p> 
<h2>The electronic viewfinder</h2> 
<p>Despite the Digilux 2&rsquo;s vague resemblance to a classic rangefinder 
camera, it is not a rangefinder. The viewfinder is electronic - a TV set behind 
an eyepiece. It&rsquo;s jittery and grainy. Not any uglier than other EVF 
cameras (except the new Konica/Minolta A2 - which is a big leap forward). 
Better than a videophone broadcast from Baghdad. But if you&rsquo;re used to 
the crisp texture of an SLR screen or the brilliant clarity of a good window 
viewfinder, it&rsquo;s unlovely.</p> 
<p>In addition to its general ugliness, the EVF also has three specific 
operational issues.</p> 
<p>First: Even at &ldquo;90mm&rdquo;, precise manual focusing is essentially 
impossible on the unmagnified screen. The camera can be set to magnify the 
center of the image 4x or 8x for manual focus (the magnification turns on when 
the focus ring is touched, and turns off a couple of seconds later), but even 
using this focus-assist, focusing at &ldquo;28mm&rdquo; is still troublesome.
</p> 
<p>Second: In really bright light the camera stops down the aperture to help 
control screen brightness. Usually - it opens back up for focusing (AF or MF). 
But on rare occasions (twice in 6 weeks) it has &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; to do 
this. Using ISO 100 and a high shutter speed, this left me shooting at f/2.4 
while trying to focus at f/5.6 (the reverse of an SLR, where you focus at f/1.4 
and shoot at f/5.6). Even at &ldquo;90mm&rdquo; and with the magnification 
turned on, the DOF was so wide that an &ldquo;infinity&rdquo; subject still 
looked sharp with the lens set as close as 4 feet - a recipe for fuzzy 
pictures. Pointing the camera at something dark and trying again cleared the 
problem each time.</p> 
<p>Third: the viewfinder lags behind reality by about 1/12th second (80 
milliseconds +/-). The shutter lag on the Digilux 2 is pretty minimal, but the 
viewfinder lag has cost me &lsquo;moments&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s the bad news.</p> 
<h2>THE VERY, VERY GOOD (and the merely nice)</h2> 
<p>On the flip side, at ISO 100 the Digilux 2 produces jpeg images at the rate 
of 1 per second-and-a-half even in single-shot mode that are not just very, 
very good - they are astonishing. And when the final pictures are this clear 
and detailed, the fact that the viewfinder image is grainy becomes a minor 
issue.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>THE LENS</h2> 
<p>The lens is a non-interchangeable 7mm-22.5mm f/2.0-2.4 Vario-Summicron 
zoom, equivalent to a 28mm-90mm zoom for 35mm film. The widest apertures at the 
marked focal lengths: 28mm f/2; 35mm f/2; 50mm f/2.1; 70mm f/2.2; 90mm f/2.4. 
Focusing and zooming are internal - so the lens never changes shape or size. 
Since the zooming is mechanical, it does not have to extend or retract during 
startup/shutdown, saving seconds. Closest focus is about 1 foot (.3 meters) - 
which covers an area of about 4.5 x 6 inches (11cm x 16cm) at 90mm - hardly 
macro, but tighter than most non-macro lenses, and much tighter than almost any 
rangefinder lens.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Vario-Summicron &ldquo;shoots&rdquo; wider than its 
&ldquo;28-90mm&rdquo; rating. The focal lengths are accurate if you crop the 
Digilux&rsquo;s 4:3 &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; format to the shape of a 35mm frame. 
But if you use the entire Digilux image, the results look more like 
8x10&rsquo;s (A4s) cropped from a 24-75mm zoom.</p> 
<p>Personally, I love wide (my main film lens is a 21mm) - so I found this a 
pleasant surprise. The downside: at the long end, the V-S is barely a portrait 
lens - a &ldquo;long&rdquo; normal. Of course, many rangefinder photographers 
don&rsquo;t shoot longer than 50mm or 75mm anyway - so it fits into the 
&ldquo;rangefinder&rdquo; ethos.</p> 
<p>Leica&rsquo;s film lenses have a slight bias towards cyan-green - or more 
accurately, away from magenta/red. The Vario-Summicron shares this tendency. It 
strips away magenta casts from sky and clouds. And water reflecting sky, or 
sky-lit shadows/shade, are rendered as cyan-blue, not purple-blue. Caucasian 
skin tones in sunset light tend towards golden, not ruddy. Darker skin tones 
are rendered in browns instead of purples. Evergreen trees are green, not brown 
or gray.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The lens is very sharp, has crisp edge definition, and does a superb job of 
separating and defining colors and tones. In most of my comparison images with 
film it has held its own alongside one of Leica&rsquo;s &ldquo;signature&rdquo; 
film lenses: the 35 f/1.4 Summilux-ASPH. At its peak apertures (f/4-5.6) it is 
projecting details so fine that they start interacting with the Bayer pattern 
on the image sensor, producing moires - witness the clothing textures and ebony 
tooling in the bagpiper picture - and dropping out fine details against the sky 
- see the tail-less bird below.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Seems as though Leica/Panasonic have subdued or left out the 
&ldquo;low-pass&rdquo; filter in order to maximize sharpness, even at the risk 
of the occasional &ldquo;eel&rdquo;. (Moire, moray - hmmmm....never mind). 
Although the lens has a minimum aperture of f/11, diffraction begins to soften 
the image visibly below f/8.</p> 
<p>At 28mm - barrel distortion is obvious, about 3-4% at the corners, and 
there is a moderate amount of purple/green color fringing (3 pixels-worth at 
the corners) in many pictures, Light fall-off is about 1.5 f/stops at the 
corners and is rather abrupt. (A note on barrel distortion - obviously a bad 
thing in many pictures. It does slightly reduce the stretching of faces and 
heads into football shapes (American football - rugby-ball elsewhere) near the 
corners, so it&rsquo;s a mild plus in &ldquo;people&rdquo; pictures.)</p> 
<p>At 90mm - no distortion I could measure, occasional purple fringing in dark 
objects against the sky, very low vignetting (looks like about 1/2 stop at its 
worst).</p> 
<p>Since the true focal-length range is 7mm-22.5mm, depth of field is 
extensive. BUT - it isn&rsquo;t infinite. It is very easy to get 
less-than-sharp pictures even at the &ldquo;28mm&rdquo; setting if you 
don&rsquo;t focus carefully. At 4 feet and f/2 there is clear softening of the 
image from peak performance within 4 inches either side of correct focus. At 
&ldquo;90mm&rdquo;-f/2.4 the image starts to degrade visibly within 1.5 inches 
either side of correct focus. There&rsquo;s a big difference between 
&lsquo;apparently sharp&rdquo; and really sharp. If you want to get the best 
this lens can produce - you won&rsquo;t count too much on DOF.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Vario-Summicron will blur backgrounds and foregrounds when used near 
its minimum focus at maximum aperture. When it does, the &ldquo;bokeh&rdquo; is 
about the prettiest I&rsquo;ve ever seen - the image just melts away from 
&ldquo;sharp&rdquo; with a soft and delicate contrast, and no hint of bright 
rings or double images. But &ldquo;bokeh&rdquo; is obviously a non-factor in 
most Digilux 2 pictures.</p> 
<p>In addition to the 3.2x mechanical zoom range, the Digilux 2 offers a 2x/3x 
&ldquo;digital&rdquo; zoom which transforms the lens into a 
&ldquo;56-180mm&rdquo; or &ldquo;85-270mm&rdquo;. As with all digital zooms, it 
simply magnifies the image from the middle of the sensor, without gathering any 
more detail. Essentially useless for anything other than 4x6 prints or video, 
IMHO - and at 3x, don&rsquo;t expect to use the resulting images to prove you 
actually saw &ldquo;Bigfoot&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nessie&rdquo;.</p> 
<h2>THE BODY</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Digilux 2 body is a basic Bauhaus &ldquo;form-follows-function&rdquo; 
box, with a lens on one side and a light-sensitive surface on the other. Even 
Louis Daguerre would recognize it as a camera. I&rsquo;ve seen comments that it 
is &ldquo;styled&rdquo; to look like a Leica rangefinder. But with its 
squared-off ends and large (69mm diameter) lens - it reminds me more of a Canon 
7 wearing the legendary 50mm f/0.95, or perhaps a Nikon SP with a Nikkor 50 
f/1.1 mounted, especially if the Nikkor and the Vario-Summicron have their 
massive lens shades attached.</p> 
<p>All of the &ldquo;photographic&rdquo; controls (exposure, focus, focal 
length, metering pattern, etc.) are analog dials, rings and levers. They all 
have a mechanical feel - though most obviously connect to electronics beneath 
the surface. The focusing ring is slightly &ldquo;light&rdquo; in touch, but 
allows one-finger focusing. The shutter dial rotation is oriented to match a 
Leica M6ttl or M7, rather than the &lsquo;opposite&rsquo; design of older 
Leicas or the MP.</p> 
<p>After you have used the on-screen menu lists to set up your major shooting 
preferences (RAW or Jpeg, image size/compression, 
saturation/contrast/sharpness, etc.) and minor shooting preferences (color or 
B&amp;W, ISO speed), it is possible to take pictures for hours, or even days, 
in all the automatic or manual modes, without ever again looking at a menu or 
LCD read-out, or touching a push-button - except, of course, the shutter 
release.</p> 
<p>Anyone who has ever used a Nikon F2 or Canon F1 or Pentax Spotmatic (or - 
yes, a Leica rangefinder) already knows where everything is and what it does.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The ergonomics of the Digilux are superb. With its centered lens, it is 
easier to hold, and much easier to hold steady, than the &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape 
used for most other top-end digicams, because the left palm has a corner to 
provide mutual support, instead of thin air.Since people vary, there is no 
perfect size and weight for a camera. The Digilux is heavier than a Leica 
rangefinder wearing a tiny 35mm Summicron, and lighter than the same Leica with 
a 35 Summilux ASPH. My shoulder loves it - my hands might wish for an ounce or 
two more heft at slow shutter speeds. The bulk is just inside the large end of 
my comfort zone - about the same as a small motor-incorporated film SLR (Nikon 
N/F80, Contax Aria).</p> 
<p>Build quality is average. I wouldn&rsquo;t swear to any part of the body 
being metal, although some controls probably are. The lens barrel and rings are 
aluminum or some other light metal, not brass. And there&rsquo;s a rather tacky 
seam down the middle of the bottom plate. But my Digilux took a 3-foot fall out 
of my camera bag onto carpeted concrete the first night I had it, and survived 
with no marks or damage.</p> 
<p>As with most rangefinder cameras, the viewfinder eyepiece is in the top 
left corner. This has great benefits for right-eyed photographers: you 
don&rsquo;t have to balance the camera on the tip of your nose (firmer 
support), people can see your face while you&rsquo;re shooting (a good way to 
establish and maintain trust), and, in the case of the Digilux, you 
aren&rsquo;t constantly planting nose-grease on the rear LCD. Left-eyed 
shooters end up the same place they do with most camera designs - out in the 
cold. (Has anyone ever built a camera that favors left-eyed photography? - 
seems unfair).</p> 
<p>The analog controls, with each control handling one function, are very fast 
and very transparent. Not only can you set them with the power off, you can set 
two or three things simultaneously: left hand setting focus or aperture or 
focal length while the right hand is thumbing on the power and setting the 
shutter or meter pattern. All of which gets you to the important thing - 
pushing the shutter release - in the shortest time possible.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Turn-on lag time</h2> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn on the camera and set the lens to 6 feet for a quick 
&ldquo;scale-focused&rdquo; street photography grab shot. We&rsquo;ll use the 
Digilux 2, and a couple of other popular digicams, the Canon G5 and the Sony 
828, which I tested at the local electronics-appliance store.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>On the Digilux: Total time to &ldquo;ready to shoot&rdquo; - turn on the 
camera and set 6 feet on the lens&rsquo;s analog scale - 2.7 seconds</li> 
<li>On the 828: Total time to turn on the camera, turn on &ldquo;manual 
focus&rdquo; and set 6 feet on the LCD readout - 5 seconds</li> 
<li>On the G5: Total time to turn on the camera, turn on &ldquo;manual 
focus&rdquo; and set 6 feet on the LCD&rsquo;s &ldquo;thermometer&rdquo; focus 
scale - 6-7 seconds</li> </ul> 
<p>Not to pick on the Canon and Sony, which do pretty well as digicams go. But 
a manual-focus &ldquo;feature&rdquo; buried somewhere in the electronics is 
simply not in the same league as a focus ring on the lens that can be set with 
a flick of the finger even before the camera is powered up.</p> 
<h2>The viewfinders and focusing</h2> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve already touched on the major flaws of the EVF. Every viewfinder 
ever conceived has been a Faustian bargain - there is always a trade-off 
between things it does well and things it does poorly. Rangefinder cameras 
can&rsquo;t frame accurately, can&rsquo;t focus closer than a couple of feet, 
have trouble aligning near and far parts of the subject precisely (parallax), 
and won&rsquo;t work with zoom lenses - but are very quiet and smooth. SLRs 
solve the problems of the rangefinder - at the cost of noise, shake and bulk. 
Both can be very fast to focus and provide clear (if different) views of the 
world.</p> 
<p>The EVF combines rangefinder quiet and smoothness with SLR-like framing, 
focus range, and zoom capability - at the cost of an unpleasant view and slow 
(if eventually accurate) visual focusing. And while rangefinders and even SLR 
screens can get out of alignment, with the EVF you are focusing using the 
actual pixels that will make up the final picture - the image sensor 
can&rsquo;t ever get out of alignment with itself. It&rsquo;s still ugly - 
especially when sitting on the sofa and &ldquo;fondling&rdquo; the little 
beast. But it&rsquo;s funny - once I start shooting and paying attention to the 
world and the moments around me - how quickly the ugliness fades into the 
background. I&rsquo;m too busy seeing pictures to notice.</p> 
<p>Some people have experimented with using accessory viewfinders, 
rangefinder-style, to avoid the EVF. I tried it myself - and went back to just 
using the built-in finder. Didn&rsquo;t like being limited to one or two focal 
lengths; didn&rsquo;t like the parallax error; didn&rsquo;t like the big lens 
protuding into the viewfinder corner; didn&rsquo;t like the extra bulk on top. 
Very strange - since I use the same finders, with the same limitations, all the 
time for film photography.</p> 
<p>I use all the camera&rsquo;s focusing modes, depending on the situation.</p>
<p> </p> 
<p>At focal lengths above &ldquo;50mm&rdquo;, autofocus is usually fastest 
(the AF lock time is about 1 second). But I use manual focus when I don&rsquo;t 
want the focus point to shift between shots, or when I&rsquo;m using 
&ldquo;trap-focus&rdquo; for action - or simply to avoid the AF lag when the 
&ldquo;moment&rdquo; finally happens.</p> 
<p>At 35mm and 28mm, I use scale-focusing for most fast work. For slower, 
critical manual-focus at f/2, I use the old film-maker&rsquo;s trick of zooming 
in to focus and zooming out to frame.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Again, the logic of the analog controls comes into play. With two rings 
side-by-side on the lens, it is simple and fast to change focal lengths and 
click between manual and autofocus without taking my hand off the lens or the 
camera away from my eye.</p> 
<p>The Digilux has a single AF point in the middle of the frame. The size of 
the focus area has two settings - a &ldquo;spot&rdquo; area smaller than 1% of 
the image, and a larger &ldquo;box&rdquo; about 1/5th the height and width of 
the screen. When using manual focus, the viewfinder can be set to magnify the 
center of the image when the focus ring is touched. At 4x, the magnified view 
appears in a box within the full-frame image, which supposedly allows one to 
keep track of the overall picture while focusing. At 8x, the magnified area 
fills the screen. I&rsquo;ve discovered that: 1) 4x really isn&rsquo;t enough 
enlargement for most critical focusing, and 2) holding the shutter button down 
lightly will turn off the magnification temporarily to allow a quick check of 
overall framing anyway (a nice &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; feature). So I always 
use the 8x setting.</p> 
<p>The internal viewfinder and rear LCD show identical views. Only one or the 
other is on at any time, and a button on the back toggles between them. The 
rear finder is almost as large as a 645 film frame, but is not hinged for 
low/high-angle shots. One very smart feature is that the viewfinder of choice 
can be set separately for shooting or reviewing pictures. So that flipping the 
shoot/review lever automatically switches you to your preferred viewfinder with 
one motion.</p> 
<p>In shooting mode, four levels of information can be shown in the viewfinder.
</p> 
<p>The most basic shows you nothing but the image and the AF &lsquo;box&rsquo; 
- until you touch the shutter button, at which point the aperture and shutter 
speed appear, along with a &ldquo;match-needle&rdquo; scale if you&rsquo;re 
setting exposure manually. There is one bug using manual exposure in this view: 
the needle and numerical readouts won&rsquo;t change in real time as you change 
apertures or shutter speeds. You must lift your finger and touch the shutter 
again to get an update on the &ldquo;new&rdquo; actual settings and metering.
</p> 
<p>A touch of the &lsquo;display&rsquo; button overlays a &ldquo;rule of 
thirds&rdquo; grid on the basic image.</p> 
<p>Another touch, and you get information overload: Exposure info, battery 
status, focus/flash/ISO/white-balance mode icons, remaining exposures, etc. 
etc. Las Vegas in a camera. But in this view, touching the shutter does turn on 
a &ldquo;live&rdquo; scale and readouts for manual metering that stay on for 10 
seconds, or as long as you keep moving the aperture/shutter controls. Finally, 
you can add a live histogram (brightness only, not colors) to the &ldquo;Las 
Vegas&rdquo; view.</p> 
<p>It is possible to see an &quot;auto review&quot; of each picture in the 
viewfinder after every shot, for 1 or 3 seconds. I immediately turned this off, 
since I am far more interested in the next picture than the one I've already 
taken. In which case there is simply a viewfinder black-out of 1 second while 
the camera starts to save the image.</p> 
<p>In picture review mode, the camera can show your collected images as a 3x3 
array of thumbnails, for fast navigation, or one image full-screen, or a zoomed 
view into that single image up to 16x.</p> 
<p>Three levels of picture information can be displayed in the single 
picture/1x view: nothing but the image; basic picture info (frame number, 
date/time of exposure, file size/type); and the basics plus detailed exposure 
info (histogram, aperture/shutter speed, metering mode, etc.). It&rsquo;s also 
possible to resize and crop images, set up DPOF info for requesting prints from 
a mini-lab, play slide shows and video, and some other stuff - none of which I 
use.</p> 
<p>Neither viewfinder is especially good for critical evaluation of exposure, 
color, or sharpness. You can tell if you missed the moment, or if the exposure 
or focus were really off. Otherwise I save my editing for the computer monitor, 
where the images are generally sharper, warmer, and darker than the camera 
displays them.</p> 
<p>I won&rsquo;t go into all the possible menus that can be brought up on the 
screens - every possible control from setting the internal clock/calendar to 
choosing how many prints to order. I&rsquo;ll just mention two other nice 
touches. You can select your 4 most often-used controls - perhaps ISO, 
contrast, white balance and auto-focus area - and assign them to a &ldquo;quick 
function&rdquo; list that can be accessed via the 4-way toggle button, saving a 
lot of scrolling through menus. And in most cases, simply touching the shutter 
button will &ldquo;clear&rdquo; all menus/functions and take you directly back 
to shooting. A fast &ldquo;escape&rdquo; key.</p> 
<h2>Shutter lag</h2> 
<p>I compared the shutter lag of the Digilux 2 to a Leica M6.</p> 
<p>I found an intersection where a building blocked my view of oncoming 
cross-traffic, so that I couldn&rsquo;t anticipate when a car would enter the 
scene. Then I shot a series of pictures with each camera, pressing the shutter 
as soon as I saw a car bumper appear from behind the building. Focus was set 
manually. With the Digilux, I shot two series, one using the internal 
viewfinder, and one where I watched the scene directly, to see if the EVF had 
any additional lag. In the resulting snaps, I marked how far the car bumpers 
had moved by the time the shutter actually exposed the picture. What I was 
measuring was shutter lag PLUS my reaction time - but it&rsquo;s still possible 
to compare relative lag times.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The diagram shows the results. Lines mark the actual bumper positions, the 
arrows mark the average for each group. Within each series, the variation is 
likely a combination of my reaction time and small changes in traffic speeds. 
The much larger variation for the M6 is interesting, and could be due to the 
mechanical linkage-chain in the shutter. The traffic was moving at 20 mph (I 
drove the street 3 times to check this) - which is 30 feet per second. Each 
foot of movement thus equals about 33.3 milliseconds.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>With the M6 (which has a known shutter lag of about 20 milliseconds), the 
average total distance traveled was 7 feet. Total lag (including my reaction 
time) was 233 msecs.</li> 
<li>With the Digilux 2 and direct viewing, the cars had, on average, moved an 
additional 1.5 feet, or an additonal lag of 50 msecs. Added to the 
Leica&rsquo;s 20 msecs., that makes a shutter lag of about 70 msecs.</li> 
<li>With the Digilux 2 using the EVF, the cars had moved yet another 2.5 feet, 
on average, for an additional &ldquo;viewfinder&rdquo; lag of 83 msec., and an 
overall lag of 153 msecs.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Despite the long time needed to save RAW files, when shooting fine jpegs, 
the lag between exposures is 1 to 1.5 seconds, about the same as thumb-winding 
a film camera.</p> 
<h2>Camera noise</h2> 
<p>The Digilux 2 is essentially silent. When the shutter is pressed, there is 
a faint internal &ldquo;tic-tic&rdquo; (I think it&rsquo;s the aperture blades 
shifting to shooting aperture). About on the level of the quietest leaf 
shutters, at most. No focusing sound - manual or auto. It&rsquo;s possible to 
dial up one of three &ldquo;Hollywood&rdquo; shutter sounds 
(&ldquo;clack&rdquo;, &ldquo;click&rdquo;, or &ldquo;cluck&rdquo;) that play 
when you fire the shutter. But to use them you must also put up with a loud 
&ldquo;beep&rdquo; that plays when the AF locks, and EVERY TIME you press a 
button on the back: choosing from menus, setting functions, scrolling through 
pictures, deleting pictures, confirming deletes, switching viewfinders. BEEP 
BEEPBEEP BEEPBEEPBEEP. Obnoxious. And the &ldquo;tic-tic&rdquo; is enough to 
tell me the shutter fired. So I leave the noises off.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Funny how often people eventually asked &ldquo;When are you going to take 
the picture?&rdquo; - after I&rsquo;ve already nailed a dozen candid moments 
and expressions from 4 feet away. Silence is golden.</p> 
<h2>The glove test</h2> 
<p>Just for grins, I put on a heavy set of ragg-wool gloves and tried 
operating the Digilux. In general, it was easy to handle all the controls 
(analog and digital) smoothly and without affecting neighboring 
buttons/rings/dials. Occasionally the focus would shift a bit when turning the 
aperture ring. The control wheel on the back was very slippery and hard to turn 
with gloves, but fortunately most of its functions can be handled by the 4-way 
button inside it, which worked fine. And while it was easy to slide open the 
door for the memory card and press/release it - it was then impossible to get a 
grip on the card and remove it the rest of the way. If you&rsquo;re going to 
shoot in cold weather - start with an &lsquo;empty&rsquo; memory card so you 
won&rsquo;t need to replace it - or bring tweezers.</p> 
<h2>Flash</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Digilux 2 has a built-in pop-up flash. Press a button on the back once, 
and the flash head pops up to a 60-degree angle for bounce flash. Press the 
button again, and the base pops up another 60 degrees, pointing the flash at 
the subject. The bounce flash is surprisingly powerful. I get nicely exposed 
bounce shots even at ISO 100 in settings where my &ldquo;film&rdquo; flash 
(Vivitar 2800) often poops out on slide film. (Having an f/2 aperture helps, of 
course). Due to the 60-degree bounce angle, the flash provides a small amount 
of &lsquo;kick&rsquo; light directly at the subject as well as bounce - but 
also sets a limit on how close you can shoot. Under an average ceiling, once 
you get closer than about 5 feet, the &ldquo;pool&rdquo; of bounced light is 
directly above, or even behind, your subject. Using direct flash, the huge lens 
shade will cast a shadow in the bottom of pictures shot at &ldquo;28mm&rdquo; - 
but the lens alone will not.</p> 
<p>So far as I can tell, the Digilux has about every possible flash capability 
generally available - normal sync up to 1/2000th second (yes, 3 zeroes is 
correct!); slow-speed sync; sync at the beginning or end of the exposure (I 
refuse to call it &ldquo;second-curtain-sync&rdquo; when the camera has no 
shutter curtains); flash exposure compensation of +/- 2 stops for fill. The 
camera also has a standard hot-shoe, with dedicated contacts for use with 
Leica/Metz flashes. Other flashes with safe trigger voltages can be used, but 
must depend on their built-in automation rather than TTL. No PC outlet - 
you&rsquo;d need some kind of adapter (radio, slave) for work with studio 
strobes. There is a physical lock/switch in the shoe that will turn off and 
lock down the pop-up flash if ANYTHING - even an accesory viewfinder - is 
mounted in the shoe. The switch also changes the flash firmware to 
&ldquo;external-flash&rdquo; mode - no pre-flash, but otherwise the same 
options as using the internal flash.</p> 
<p>There is a separate &ldquo;flash&rdquo; white-balance setting to compensate 
for the coolish color of the flashtube. I &ldquo;gelled&rdquo; my flash for 
that warm &ldquo;sunset light&rdquo; look, and to balance with tungsten lights 
indoors, by the simple expedient of coloring a piece of translucent office tape 
with an orange marker and sticking it on the front.</p> 
<h2>EXPOSURE AND IMAGE CONTROLS</h2> 
<p>The Digilux can expose in the standard 4 modes - manual, aperture-priority, 
shutter-priority, or program.</p> 
<p>These modes are set via the aperture ring and shutter dial. Set the 
aperture to &ldquo;A&rdquo; and the camera will choose the aperture as you 
choose the shutter speed. Set the shutter dial to &ldquo;A&rdquo;, and the 
camera will choose the shutter speed as you change apertures. Set both to 
&ldquo;A&rdquo;, and you are in program mode. The program mode can be biased 
towards either fast shutter speeds/large apertures or slow shutter speeds/small 
apertures by thumbing the serrated silver wheel on the camera back.</p> 
<p>In manual mode you set both the shutter and aperture yourself, using the 
internal meter readout&rsquo;s &ldquo;needle&rdquo; as a guide, or using a 
hand-held meter, or even just using the old &ldquo;Sunny-16&rdquo; 
rule-of-thumb. The meter can be set to center-weighted, spot metering, and 
&ldquo;multi-area&rdquo; patterns. The spot meter reads about 1% of the image 
area - roughly 2 degrees at &ldquo;90mm&rdquo; and 6 degrees at 
&ldquo;28mm&rdquo;. One advantage of a &ldquo;shutterless&rdquo; digicam is 
that the exposure can be metered directly from the live image sensor voltages 
instead of through a surrogate metering circuit/sensor.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Digilux 2 uses this ability to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the highlights 
when set to multi-area or centerweighted metering patterns. It pins the 
brightest pixels to about a level of 245-248 on the histogram, preventing 
burned-out whites.</p> 
<p>Outside of ISO speed, there are 4 main &ldquo;digital&rdquo; image controls 
for JPEG shooting (they have no effect on RAW files). Contrast, Saturation, and 
Sharpness can be set to &ldquo;Std.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Low&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;High&rdquo;. And apparently this is the sole difference (except 
cosmetics) between the Leica and Panasonic cameras - the Panasonic&rsquo;s 
settings are all a bit &lsquo;higher&rsquo; than the Leica&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I generally work with sharpness set to &ldquo;low&rdquo; and the other two 
set to &ldquo;std.&rdquo; Setting contrast and saturation to &ldquo;low&rdquo; 
results in very softly toned images, with histograms that end well short of 
black and white, and the appearance of a freshly-born TIFF from a RAW file. An 
excellent starting place for some kinds of landscape work, with a long tonal 
range (but obviously not sharpness) that approaches large-format images.</p> 
<p>Due to the meter&rsquo;s habit of protecting the highlights, changing the 
contrast when using autoexposure has the effect of lightening or darkening the 
shadows - moving only the left end of the histogram.</p> 
<p>There are also seven White-Balance settings: Auto, sunny, cloudy, tungsten, 
electronic flash, manual - and black-and-white.</p> 
<p>Generally, I find the AUTO setting to be most reliable for daylight use. 
&ldquo;Sunny&rdquo; is generally too blue (especially here in Denver, where 
there is a lot of extra UV light at a mile high). Cloudy and flash go a bit 
overboard in adding yellow/red. Tungsten does OK, but undercorrects a bit, 
leaving some residual yellow under house lights.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Manual setting also tends to run a bit on the yellow side. Looks great 
on the bluish LCD when reviewing pictures, but too yellow once the pictures are 
loaded into Photoshop. It&rsquo;s the best choice under non-daylight light 
sources, but needs to have a lot of blue compensation dialed in if the light is 
short on blue wavelengths (see blue-channel issues below).</p> 
<p>The B&amp;W mode is interesting, and I like to use it if I am looking for 
B&amp;W pictures. But it eliminates the option of playing with 
Photoshop&rsquo;s &ldquo;channel-mixer&rdquo; after the fact to darken skies 
and such. Comparing a &ldquo;B&amp;W&rdquo; shot of a Gretag ColorChecker to a 
color image converted via the channel-mixer, the camera&rsquo;s internal 
channel-mix is roughly Red 35%/Green 55%/Blue 10%. JPEG files are actually 
monochrome RGBs, not grayscale. And the B&amp;W setting doesn&rsquo;t affect 
RAW files, which by their nature still contain the full color data from the 
original Bayer pattern of the pixels.</p> 
<p>The blue channel has some issues, at least in JPEGS.</p> 
<p>1) Testing color rendition with the ColorChecker, most colors are rendered 
quite well, but blues - especially dark &ldquo;nylon sportswear&rdquo; blues - 
and to a lesser extent, yellows, tend to hypersaturate.</p> 
<p>2) Under lighting short in blue wavelengths - tungsten, fluorescent, sodium 
vapor - even when &ldquo;white-balanced&rdquo;, the blue channel develops large 
blobby noise, which shows up as an &ldquo;underpainting&rdquo; of yellow 
patches at all ISOs, but especially 400. The actual blue channel looks like a 
Kodalith image of out-of-focus oatmeal - no fine details, no tonality. Shooting 
at EI 100, manually white balancing, adjusting the white balance as far to the 
blue side as possible, and being generous with exposure (+1 EV) will boost the 
blue exposure to a reasonable level - pictures still need some Photoshop work 
to fix color balance and saturation, but at least the blue channel contains 
detail. The camera is still much happier with full-spectrum light (daylight, 
flash or blue photofloods).</p> 
<p>3) Blue lights bloom excessively in night exposures (see section below on 
night/time exposures)</p> 
<h2>OVERALL IMAGE QUALITY</h2> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s make it simple. I wanted a digital camera that could do better 
than the 2700-ppi scans I was getting from ISO 100/160 color negative films. I 
hoped wistfully for a camera that could come close to scans from ISO 100 slide 
films. That is what the Digilux 2 delivers. As I mentioned in discussing the 
lens, the sharpness and occasional moire patterns in fine details lead me to 
believe that Leica/Panasonic have chosen to limit the amount of low-pass 
filtration over the Bayer pattern - a route that Kodak, in the 14n/ProN/ProC, 
and Nikon, in the new D70, also seem to have followed.</p> 
<p>(BTW, in the film/digital comparisons here, the Digilux 2 images were 
upsampled about 40% to match image size with the film scans. In the D2-only 
examples, the pixels are 100% as they came from the camera unless noted 
otherwise.)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>At ISO 100 the images are very smooth and clean - not quite as sharp as 
Velvia, but a good match for the average 35mm 100 slide film. An overall look a 
lot like Ektachrome 100VS with some Kodachrome and Velvia touches thrown in - 
and with adjustable saturation and contrast. Clearly less &ldquo;grainy&rdquo; 
noise than scans from color negs. But there is occasionally a cyan-red 
patchiness (Chrominance noise?) in dark grays or blue-green areas like 
architectural glass.</p> 
<p>The most startling thing about digital color is that, properly white 
balanced, it is remarkably clean and free from color casts compared to chemical 
imaging/scanning. There is something to be said for working directly from the 
subject&rsquo;s original color wavelengths, rather than an image 
&lsquo;filtered&rsquo; through various stages of chemical dyes and 
scanner/enlarger optics. It&rsquo;s scary when you open a color image and all 
the grays have identical amounts of RGB - 160/161/160 or 120/119/120 or the 
like.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, the Digilux 2&rsquo;s jpeg images are somewhat 
&ldquo;brittle&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t nail exposure, white balance, 
saturation and contrast in the camera, and have to start making major 
corrections in post-processing, they can fall apart rather quickly.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>B&amp;W pictures follow the same pattern. At 100 the Digilux is a bit ahead 
of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; ISO 100/125 silver films in terms of grain/noise, 
but not TMax/Delta or ISO 50 film. Sharpness is a tiny bit lower, and the 
overall feel of grainless highlights and a touch of grain/noise in the shadows 
comes closest to chromogenic B&amp;W films such as Ilford XP2.</p> 
<h2>Workarounds for using ISO 400</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Shoot RAW and accept the lag between shots</li> 
<li>Add some &ldquo;grain&rdquo; in Photoshop to fill in the 
&lsquo;smoothed&rsquo; areas, and the results are still nearly as sharp as some 
&ldquo;old technology&rdquo; 400 B&amp;W films.</li> 
<li>Set the camera contrast to &ldquo;high&rdquo; - which increases local 
contrasts enough to &ldquo;burn through&rdquo; a lot of the noise smoothing, 
but drops out a lot of shadow detail.</li> 
<li>Or my preferred technique when I need ISO 400 jpegs: set the camera to ISO 
100, contrast and saturation settings to &ldquo;low&rdquo;, and underexpose 2 
stops (EI 400 instead of ISO 400).</li> </ul> 
<p>(Pause while the &ldquo;expose to the right&rdquo; fans stop choking and 
get their hearts started again).</p> 
<p>Then I lighten the resulting dark images in Photoshop (after converting to 
16/48-bits and upsampling to avoid posterizing/combing the histogram as much as 
possible) using curves and levels.</p> 
<p>Outcome: almost no smoothing, at least a 4x increase in resolution over the 
&ldquo;smoothed&rdquo; parts of a straight ISO 400 picture, an increase in 
noise (probably to about where it would have been at 400 if Leicasonic 
weren&rsquo;t smoothing it), and a slight increase in saturation. Nice crisp 
clear &ldquo;ISO 400&rdquo; pictures. Less grain than most 400 color negs 
I&rsquo;ve scanned, a bit worse than Provia 400f, especially in the shadows.</p>
<p> </p> 
<p>In the image above, the bottom row shows straight exposures at ISO 
100/200/400. The upper images were shot with the camera set to ISO 100 but 
underexposed 1 and 2 stops and lightened in Photoshop. Note especially the 
faint rays in the top of the label - erased in the 200/400 exposures, retained 
in the &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; ISO 100 shots.</p> 
<h2>&ldquo;Pushing&rdquo; Digilux images beyond 400</h2> 
<p>The Digilux 2 is limited to ISO settings of 100/200/400. For many 
photographers, that&rsquo;s not enough. Since my &ldquo;push-processed&rdquo; 
images from ISO 100 to 400 worked pretty well, I also experimented with 
underexposing and &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; ISO 400 images to higher EIs.</p> 
<p>Put simply - the JPEG noise reduction at ISO 400 has already fouled the 
image so badly that it can&rsquo;t hold up to any further strain on the pixels. 
Even at EI 800 the results are as ugly as the average ISO 3200 film. In a 
&ldquo;news emergency&rdquo; I could get a publishable newspaper picture at 800 
or 1600, but not something I&rsquo;d want to hang on the wall.</p> 
<p>If Leica sees fit to change the firmware and make the JPEG noise-reduction 
&ldquo;user-adjustable&rdquo; - or if one works from RAW originals - better 
results may be possible. Otherwise, once the light drops below what f/2 and ISO 
400 can handle, it&rsquo;s time for an f/1.4 lens - on an SLR with a bigger 
chip and less noise reduction, or a film rangefinder. Or flash. Or (uggh!) a 
tripod.</p> 
<h2>Night shots</h2> 
<p>Speaking of tripods (which I normally use about once a year) - I did try a 
few long exposures. The Digilux 2 is limited to an 8-second maximum exposure 
time, and uses a &lsquo;dark-frame&rsquo; second exposure to map and subdue 
&lsquo;hot&rsquo; pixels. I don&rsquo;t see much noise beyond the normal 
amounts for ISO 100 or 400 in an 8-second exposure - perhaps 50 specks out of 5 
million pixels that might be under- or over-corrected hot pixels. The 
dark-frame exposure is not user-adjustable, and kicks in at 1/2 second - which 
snuck up on me a couple of times when I was making hand-held 1/2-sec. pictures.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The wonky blue channel shows its stuff. Blue lights &lsquo;bloom&rsquo; 
like a 7-pixel gaussian blur, and over the rest of the picture the blue channel 
is essentially black. Red and yellow lights bloom a bit, green lights the 
least. White lights show purple fringes - red and blue blooming combined.</p> 
<p>The attached image is a crop, but not a 100% view of the pixels.</p> 
<h2>IN SUMMARY</h2> 
<p>As an operating tool in the hand, the Digilux 2 is almost exactly what I 
wanted in a digital camera. I love the silence and stillness. I like the 
compact, grippable ergonomics. The manual controls, quick start-up, and short 
shutter lag simply outperform anything less than an SLR (and even a few of 
those) when it comes to fast work on the street, or wherever the action is. The 
ISO 100 image quality is extremely good - challenging the results from film 
scans with twice as many pixels due to the lens&rsquo;s outstanding resolution.
</p> 
<p>I could wish for an alternative to the video viewfinder, so long as it 
retained the manual focusing, silence, and accurate framing. Don&rsquo;t see 
any way to do it without giving up something else, though.</p> 
<p>I could wish very strongly for an upgrade to the camera&rsquo;s software 
that would make it possible to turn off the noise-suppression at ISO 200/400 
via a menu selection similar to the color and saturation settings. 
Shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 100 lines of code. Leica - are you listening?</p>
<p>I could wish for an 8Mp sensor to capture more of the lens&rsquo;s 
abilities. And I&rsquo;ll acknowledge the usefulness of a bigger buffer for RAW 
shooters - though I personally wouldn&rsquo;t use it much.</p> 
<p>No kidding around, though. If I weren&rsquo;t primarily an ISO 100 
photographer, and willing to use creative workarounds on the few occasions I 
need 400, I would not be nearly so happy.</p> 
<p>This is probably as good a place as any to say that I did not buy the 
Digilux 2 for the Leica nameplate. I bought it for the straightforward analog 
controls. If Nikon or Canon or Minolta had produced a camera as 
&lsquo;manual&rsquo; as the Digilux 2, I would have bought 
Nikon/equipment/canon/Minolta - whichever came first.</p> 
<p>I chose the Leica over its Panasonic twin because it was available. As of 
this writing (late April 2004) I have yet to see a DMC/LC-1 in the flesh, 
whereas I&rsquo;ve already shot 2200 exposures with the Digilux. That&rsquo;s 
60 rolls of film - or $660 in film/processing costs. So I&rsquo;ve already 
recovered more than the Leica/Panasonic price difference.</p> 
<p>Another 2-3 months of shooting, and I&rsquo;ll be able to slap a 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh - It&rsquo;s paid for&rdquo; sticker on the Leica. At 
which point the Digilux will be the same price as any other well-used digital 
camera - free. And I will still have the analog controls, comfortable 
ergonomics, and really impressive Leica lens to keep using forever - or what 
passes for &ldquo;forever&rdquo; in the world of digital photography.</p> 
<p>Strong points</p> 
<ul> 
<li>full set of manual/analog photographic controls - even the 
&ldquo;auto&rdquo; settings are via dials, rings and levers.</li> 
<li>comfortable &ldquo;35mm camera&rdquo; ergonomics</li> 
<li>superb lens performance</li> 
<li>the &ldquo;wideness&rdquo; of the zoom at &ldquo;28mm&rdquo;</li> 
<li>dead silence and smoothness of shutter release</li> 
<li>short shutter lag</li> 
<li>compactness and light weight</li> 
<li>100% framing without parallax problems</li> 
<li>extremely good &ldquo;off the sensor&rdquo; exposures, that protect the 
highlights in multi-spot mode</li> 
<li>viewfinder and rear LCD separately assignable to shooting and review modes 
(1-switch changeover)</li> 
<li>automatic &lsquo;escape&rsquo; from most menus by touching the shutter 
button</li> 
<li>automatic &lsquo;escape&rsquo; from focus magnification for framing by 
holding the shutter button</li> 
<li>built-in bounce-flash capability</li> </ul> 
<p>Weak points</p> 
<ul> 
<li>excessive noise-smoothing at ISO 200 and 400, with no user control 
available</li> 
<li>long delays between shots when shooting RAW</li> 
<li>viewfinder &ldquo;lag&rdquo;</li> 
<li>the &ldquo;ugliness&rdquo; of EVF/LCD viewing/focusing in general</li> 
<li>too much DOF (on occasion) for reliable focusing with the EVF at 90mm and 
large apertures in bright light</li> 
<li>chip resolution that doesn&rsquo;t fully support the abilities of the lens
</li> 
<li>long end of the zoom range a bit short</li> 
<li>some often-accessed controls (e.g. focus magnification on/off) not 
available through the &ldquo;quick set&rdquo; of 4 custom functions</li> 
<li>and (yes!), digital image quality that is &ldquo;only&rdquo; better than 
most 35mm color neg. films, and can&rsquo;t go places that Tri-X and an f/1.4 
lens can go.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Basic Specs</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>5 megapixel 2/3rd&rdquo; CCD image sensor - Bayer RGBG pattern</li>

<p>Nice thorough review, and it looks like a nice camera - but is it really 
worth $1300 more than a Canon G5? Or to put it another way, worth the same as a 
Nikon D70 + two good lenses and a big CF card?</p> 
<p>R Quan , June 04, 2004; 06:03 A.M. </p> 
<p>An excellent review of the D2 from a known Leica expert. Many accolades are 
already rolling in. This review has added many many new points about the D2 not 
mentioned previously and is a significant contribution to our understanding of 
this camera. 24mm equivalent? What a great revelation! I would mention, 
somewhat randomly, these verbose opinions:</p> 
<p> Aethetics: </p> 
<p> The D2 is in my humble opinion the best looking camera ever. Flame me but 
I think so. Clean simple lines. Bauhausian. It retains some of the classic look 
of M cameras. I've had strangers ask &quot;Isn't that a really old camera?&quot;
</p> 
<p> Not as good as this or that: </p> 
<p> The D2 has its detractors. Almost any individual feature of a camera can 
be criticized as being inferior to another. The D2 is larger than camera A 
(your pick of P&amp;S's), the CCD is smaller than camera B (DSLR's), the 
megapixels are fewer than camera C (current crop of 8MP digicams), The EVF is 
inferior to camera D (Minolta A2). All cameras are combinations of features 
that are compromises based on the designer's goals and their perceived niche 
for the camera in the marketplace. I discredit reviewers that negatively latch 
onto one or another feature and declare the camera a failure because of it. IMO 
the D2's compromises and combination of features are ideal for my style of 
photography.</p> 
<p> D2 CCD vs the world: </p> 
<p> The D2's 5MP sensor creates wonderful images. For my work they hold their 
own against my 6MP Nikon DSLR at iso 100. The iso 400 images are the best in 
its size class. It is not quite fair to criticize the noise level compared to a 
larger APS sized sensor. It has been pointed out elsewhere on the web that chip 
size is similar to film format size. I don't hear much bashing of 35mm image 
quality compared to 6x6 or 4x5 formats because everyone recognizes that 
different film format sizes have different trade-offs. If the D2 had an APS 
sized sensor then the lens would be either impossibly huge or worse - limited 
in focal length and/or aperture. The D2 iso 400 images have a not unappealling 
noise level, like film grain. Tri-X film, introduced 50 years ago in1954, has a 
grain size that is much more prominent than chromagenic films yet plenty of 
people like it and use it and refrain from bashing the grain level as 
unacceptable. Would critics who declare the D2 at iso 400 unusable similarly 
say that Tri-X is unusable as well? I haven't yet gone to the trouble of 
acquiring in RAW partially because the quality of the .jpg's is for me quite 
good.</p> 
<p> Not as good as a DSLR: </p> 
<p> The D2 has more noise than a larger format DSLR. It doesn't have a usable 
iso 1600 or available iso 6400 setting. Of course the D2 can't mount a 10.5mm 
fisheye, 12-24 zoom, or 28f1.4/50f1.4/85f1.4. It can't shoot real macro, or 
sports or VR zooms or 300mm f2.8 teles. I own these lenses and when I need them 
I happily pull out my DSLR. In the meantime for my travel, family, street 
shooting the D2 is a much welcome relief from a DSLR and big bag of lenses. 
Since the D2 arrived the DSLR has seen very little use. Compared to a DSLR the 
D2 is smaller, lighter, MUCH quieter, more discrete, less attention getting. It 
just plain fits into my life much more compatibly than any DSLR. Sounds just 
like RFDR vs SLR debates for film cameras. My DSLR can't provide real-time 
histograms. For me the greater DOF is an advantage.</p> 
<p> B&amp;W: </p> 
<p> I love this option which is lacking on my DSLR. It is much easier to 
visualize real-time B&amp;W on the LCD screen compared to the DSLR's 
always-in-color viewfinder. I hear that one can visualize and shoot B&amp;W in 
RAW mode and retain the option of color images later using the RAW file. Even 
at iso 400 the B&amp;W .jpg's look quite good and seem to me to have less noise 
than color .jpg's.</p> 
<p> Viewfinder: </p> 
<p> The EVF is easily the D2's weakest feature. I was sure I would hate it but 
I found that while not great it really wasn't that bad. Deal breaker for some 
but not for me. My street shooting style is to hold the camera to eyelevel for 
the briefest amount of time to frame the shot so the quality of the EVF image 
is less important. The large lovely LCD makes up in good measure for the 
deficiencies of the EVF. I wish that a third push of the EVF/LCD button would 
turn both off to save power. I am wondering if a Hasselblad Reflex Viewfinder 
RMfX can be rigged to view the LCD from above.</p> 
<p> Lens: </p> 
<p> It is simply unbeatable. Nothing like it anywhere. For travel, personal, 
street shooting it is the perfect range and speed. The bokeh is quite 
beautiful. I would not give up any of its attributes to obtain a bigger CCD and 
modest image quality gain. It seems to me to offer 28/35/50mm Summicrons, 90mm 
Elmarit, and 28-35-50 Tri-Elmar lenses all rolled into one. No Leica M or DSLR 
has a single lens like this available. I don't miss changing lenses or missing 
shots because I had the wrong lens on the camera. I am considering pairing up 
the D2 with a 4MP Panasonic DMC-FZ10's Leica designed 35-420mm (equiv) f2.8 - 
what a light weight killer combo that would be...</p> 
<p> Cost: </p> 
<p> I don't complain about the premium cost of the D2 compared to the other 
digicams because I don't think any other digicam is comparable. The D2 lens is 
worth a fortune in equivalent Leica M glass. This fact alone was enough for me 
to go with it. No other digicam has a lens this valuable and Leica is renown 
for premium quality premium priced optics. Leica M's don't compete on price 
alone. I am not dismayed that a Leica is very expensive. I expect it. Few by 
now bother to criticize Leica M prices compared to VC Bessa, Hexar AF, or 
Minolta CLE. If Sony/Olympus/HP/Fuji/Canon/Nikon had a similar digicam for far 
less I might buy one but for now D2 is unique and I am able and willing to pay 
for it. To many photographers owning a Leica is worth the price. If you are 
unwilling to pay that price go for the Sony/Kodak/etc but you don't need to 
criticize Leica cameras as not worth it. They just are.</p> 
<p> Filters: </p> 
<p> A big blunder is offering a sophisticated and costly lens with bizarre 
69mm filter threads and not even offer filters for sale at the time of the 
camera's introduction. I luckily purchased my D2 in April from a seller who 
included a 69mm Panasonic MC filter (as well as a Panasonic remote release and 
Sandisk Ultra II SD card for cheap). Heliopan filters are only now starting to 
trickle in.</p> 
<p> Ergonomics: </p> 
<p> I agree with everyone that egonomics are superb. I would concur that many 
controls can be manipulated by feel alone such as the metering pattern switch. 
I do wish that the on/off switch was in the locaton of the meter pattern switch 
and vice versa since all my Nikons have the power switch around the shutter 
release button. The on/off switch on the Panasonic LC1 verson of the D2 is more 
ergonomic as it lies closer to the thumb than the D2 plus pushing the lever up 
for on and down for off makes more sense. The D2 is also missing the power-on 
LED of the LC1.</p> 
<p> Function button: </p> 
<p> I have mine set for WB, ISO, cine, and (playing with it for now) digital 
zoom. One excellent feature is that with the functon button the ISO and WB 
settings can be set with little practice without looking at the EVF/LCD. I 
would have liked custom settings as in some other digicams where I would 
combine B&amp;W/RAW/ISO400 as well as A-color/jpg/ISO100, etc.</p> 
<p> Focus: </p> 
<p> In manual focus I agree that MF2 (8x) setting works better for me. Zooming 
in to 90mm to set focus and then zooming out for framing also works well. I 
wish there was focus confirmation in manual focus and a distance read-out would 
be useful. In manual focus the lock release button can be used to set the 
distance by feel without looking, similar to tabbed Leica M lenses. For zone 
focusing street shooters this is a big advantage further reducing the lag time 
and making the D2 feel even more M-like. Like others I sometimes find that the 
focus ring slips from AF to AF-Macro accidentally.</p> 
<p> Flash: </p> 
<p> Built in bounce flash - who would have thunk it? Brilliant and pioneering. 
Works very well except if subject is too close to fall under the bounced light. 
In that case I put my left hand in front of the flash to bounce the light more 
vertically and off a nearby wall behind me (I've only tried this so far in 
B&amp;W to avoid potential color casts).</p> 
<p> Remote: </p> 
<p> The remote cable threaded down my shirt sleeve and switch in left hand 
combined with 1930's AUFSU waist level finder makes a very stealthy outfit. 
Good of course for vibrationless shutter release.</p> 
<p> User Manual: </p> 
<p> The Panasonic LC1 manual is available for download on the web and is far 
more useful compared to the Leica D2 manual</p> 
<p> http://im2.onecall.com/Image_Products/Panasonic/DMCLC1_man.pdf another 
interesting link: http://panasonic.co.jp/pavc/global/lumix/lc1/index.html</p> 
<p> D2 and M3: </p> 
<p> The M3 was, in 1954, a revolution in rangefinder camera design and 
ergonomics. The D2, on the 50th anniversary of the M3, is a similar 
breakthrough in the way serious photographers interact with their digital 
cameras. Leica has done it again.</p>

<p>I quote: &quot;...I wanted a digital camera that could do better than the 
2700-ppi scans I was getting from ISO 100/160 color negative films...&quot;</p> 
<p> What a joke. How about a 4000-6000ppi scans, huh? </p> 
<p>JON GUSS , June 04, 2004; 11:29 A.M. </p> 
<p>I have been an M-6 user for the past 10 years. I have never been able to 
adapt to gadget cameras very well. They have always been somewhat confusing for 
me and seemed to take away most of the personal touch in photography. I have 
waited to buy a digital camera until someone manafactured a camera much like my 
Leica. I do not have a lot of time to sit at a computer and use programs like 
Photo Shop (I lack the computer skills anyway.)being that I travel quite a bit 
in my work. Judging from the review, The camera will cover my need for great 
pictures while still retaining the basic feel of my M-6. It looks like the time 
has finally arrived to buy my first digital camera although I will feel guilty 
about leaving my M-6 behind.</p> 
<p>Jim Simmons , June 04, 2004; 01:45 P.M. </p> 
<p>Jon Guss, I think you'll still need to spend some time with Photoshop to 
get the most out of these D2 images. If you shoot Leica, your standards are 
high, and to reach those standards, you'll need to tweak the images in 
photoshop to make them be the best they can be. It's not hard to learn, as 
you'll only be using a small portion of all that photoshop was designed to do, 
but once there, you'll love the things that you can do that you could never do 
in traditional silver/dye photography - regional contrast control, manipulation 
of particular colors within the image, etc.</p> 
<p>Jamie W , June 04, 2004; 03:40 P.M. </p> 
<p>Here is my summary of the D2. It's a good camera, but shame about the 
price. But hey that's also my view of every Leica M camera.</p> 
<p> Seriously though. I think Leica completly missed the boat. They should 
have built a camera with a built in lens that used an APS sized digital sensor 
and a digital rangefinder. Since it is all digital anyways they should be able 
to have digitally projected infinatly variable frame lines, and a digital range 
finder &quot;cam&quot; system to go with the zoom. Hell with a setup like this 
they could even make a new digital mount for lenses designed with digital 
cameras in mind. Then when they fix the issue with w/a lenses they could have 
the new cameras use a mount that accepts both lenses, even if the M lenses 
needed an adaptor (kinda like the M can use screw mount lenses via an adaptor).
</p> 
<p> Oh well. Did I mention it's a shame about the price...</p> 
<p>Stephen W. , June 04, 2004; 09:03 P.M. </p> 
<p>Andy, </p> 
<p> As expected from your history within the Leica Photography Forum, your's 
is a great review; probably the best review I've read anywhere. However, 
digital of any kind is not my cup of tea and despite what some other people say 
regarding the availibility of processing outlets and Photoshop, I just don't 
like the PROCESS. I just prefer mechanical to digital, just me. BTW, my first 
computer class was in 1975.</p> 
<p> Thanks for a look into the future, just not my future. I don't like menus 
and not in your face composition of viewscreens or bulk of the high quality 
systems. I absolutely HATE planned obsolescence being an engineer and designer. 
I know you mention &quot;Paid For&quot;, but where's the pleasure of the 
process? I hate testing; thanks for doing so for the community.</p> 
<p> Best Regards, </p> 
<p> Steve</p> 
<p>Dan Barthel , June 05, 2004; 09:17 A.M. </p> 
<p>EVF's THANK YOU, NO WAY. It will be interesting when the Epson ships with a 
real optical viewfinder and Leica lens mount compatibility. That concept tempts 
me greatly.</p> 
<p> Dan</p> 
<p>John Falkenstine , June 06, 2004; 03:13 P.M. </p> 
<p>The camera reminds me strongly of English cars of years gone 
by...rationalization is required to oversee the fact that its an overpriced, 
outdated dud. Nonetheless it will have its fans. I predict that it will have a 
very short life. By making massive repetitive errors like this, Leica shows 
some classic business mis-steps that could lead to its demise.</p> 
<p>Adam S , June 07, 2004; 01:06 A.M. </p> 
<p>Great Review !! </p> 
<p> The Digilux 2 or can I say Panasonic LC1.... is a great camera. I have had 
them all. Pictures have a quality to them that is special. I can't put my 
finger on it but it's there. I know it depends on what you're using the camera 
for, but for me, the Digilux/LC1 works.</p> 
<p> Advantages (my opinion): Fast lens with lots of DOF. It might not be as 
easy to throw a background out of focus but you won't get blurry photographs 
like those taken with some DSLRs with fast heavy lenses attached. Also, it's 
hard for a DSLR to take shots in low light with as much DOF. You could use a 
tilt &amp; shift lens on a DSLR but there is more weight in your camera bag and 
you don't have the zoom. I took a low light shot of a band and a large crowd 
all inside a tent that came out amazing. Try that with a DSLR.</p> 
<p> Lens is permanently attached to camera so you won't get dust on the sensor 
(can be costly to fix on DSLRs).</p> 
<p> Professional feel. Sorry but I am tired of holding cameras that feel like 
a plastic toy. I know this won't make you a better photographer but hey, if I 
feel good about my camera, I will be using it more and should statistically end 
up with more good shots :)</p> 
<p> You don't need an external flash to get shots that look like they were 
taken in daylight (fantastic bounce flash feature).</p> 
<p> Controls are in the right place. Let's listen to the engineers of the past.
</p> 
<p> Has hot shoe and tripod socket that's located on same axis as the center 
of the lens (good features when you are trying to take panoramic photographs).
</p> 
<p> Huge screen. Great for previewing image while analyzing the histogram. 
Some people are saying it's like looking into view camera.</p> 
<p> In high continuous shooting mode, you subject will ask if you have taken 
the picture yet while you've already grabbed a dozen shots (read that 
somewhere). Of course, sound has to be turned off.</p> 
<p> Disadvantages: EVF, poor performance when camera is set to higher 
sensitivities, no RAW buffer. Can't win them all but I can wait till the next 
model comes out.</p> 
<p> Things to think about: Can you really see the extra shadow detail in your 
prints (i.e. matte prints from an Epson 2200)?</p> 
<p> On a trip, who want to carry a big backpack with a bunch of equipment 
(DSLR and 2.8 lenses along with tripod that will support them both). Also, 
think about all that extra glass you are carrying that your DSLR's sensor isn't 
utilizing.</p> 
<p> Small cameras are winning photo competitions. It's the photographer and 
not always the camera.</p> 
<p> You can get close to medium format results with stitching software. </p> 
<p> Not necessarily a Digliux 2 issues &gt;&gt; Who wants to pay for film and 
processing? Who wants to look back at all those angry people waiting while 
security has to hand check each roll of film at an airport?</p> 
<p> Camera is small enough where people don't get intimated. See what happens 
when you pull out that DSLR with a big lens attached. Also, can you say 
&quot;steel me&quot;.</p> 
<p> What did I miss. Sorry for the long post and the bad grammar. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Graham Welland , June 07, 2004; 04:55 A.M. </p> 
<p>Thanks for a balanced review that actually gave me some valuable user 
advice (iso 400 shooting technique). Thanks - I learnt something today!!</p> 
<p> I've had my D2 for a couple of months now and it is definitely my 
favourite 'real' digital rangefinder camera vs digital appliance. Despite the 
following I really enjoy using mine.</p> 
<p> For me, there are three issues with the D2: 1) auto-macro mode on lens. 
Like others I find that this moves too easily. 2) Focus/zoom feel - not as 
silky smooth as I'd like and a little lightwieght for my taste. 3) EVF - enough 
said!! I do like being able to compose in B&amp;W mode and still shoot colour 
RAW though. This helps.</p> 
<p> The filter situation is unforgiveable. I only want a step-up ring and even 
this is still not generally available. Polarisor is mega bucks and unobtainium 
too.</p> 
<p>Dean G , June 07, 2004; 05:03 P.M. </p> 
<p>So much is made out the &quot;big DSLR and BAG of LENSES&quot;. If you 
bring a &quot;BAG of lenses&quot;, it's only because you want to, not because 
you have to, for crying out loud. A 10D with a 24mm 2.8 prime for instance, is 
a nice compact camera. The D2/LC1 sounds nice, but this size thing.. it's just 
splitting hairs. I know it depends on what you're trying to do, but there seems 
to be nothing the D2/LC1 can do that a 10D or other DSLR can't do as well or 
better, but the equation doesn't necessarily work out the other way around. The 
D2 is not that much lighter, it is not that much smaller, and though the lens 
is fast, a camera like the 10D can gain 2-3 stops simply by having useable ISO 
200, 400, 800, and sometimes 1600.. or 3200 in a pinch. I have a 18-50mm Sigma 
DC zoom lens, compact and designed for APS sized sensors, barely larger than 
the 50mm 1.8 prime. Gives 28mm-80mm equivalent 3.5-5.6 (slow..but per above, so 
what?), and it works really well despite being.. er cheap. So it's not a 
magical Leica lens, but it's working with the magical Canon CMOS sensor, it's a 
tradeoff until I want (if ever) to buy an &quot;L&quot; lens. And I can just 
use a light weight and sharp prime if I want. This isn't really a vs dslr 
thing, but it keeps coming up, and I don't see the point. Better that the Leica 
D2 be compared to other upscale Point and Shoots, or perhaps the Oly E1 2/3 
camera, but the APS sized DSLRs are in a class by themselves IMO.</p>

<p>I find the most interesting part of the review is the fact that there is a 
tutorial on how to take acceptable ISO 400 images (that circumvent the in-built 
shortcomings) with a 1300 UK Pound camera.</p> 
<p> I think that says all that needs to be said about the overpriced D2. </p>

<p>Randall Shafer , June 15, 2004; 11:52 A.M. </p> 
<p>So when you get right down to it, it's a $600 Sony 717 with a $1200 Leica 
price sticker added and without the innovative features like laser AF assist 
and nightshot.</p> 
<p> I'm underwhelmed. But at least the country club set will no longer have to 
be embarrassed hauling around a Canon, Nikon or UGH--- HP.</p>

<p>I find it amusing that so many people see this review as an opportunity to 
polemicize about a camera they don't own and have never used. Why attempt to 
discuss when you can pontificate instead!</p> 
<p> The D2 isn't a camera for me (I have used one) but I certainly appreciate 
the thoroughness of Andy's evaluation. Thanks.</p>

<p>I can't wait to buy an improved, better version a few years from now. Once 
they resolve the snaggles of bad high ISO in-camera JPEGS and the truly, truly 
sad unacceptable spec of a 1 frame RAW burst rate... Are you kidding me? Is 
this a $200 fisher price toy camera for the kids? Leica, dudes: Get with it.</p>
<p>Phil Shima , June 18, 2004; 04:58 P.M. </p> 
<p>Andy - Great and thorough review. I'm glad I bought the Olympus C-8080. The 
money I saved will go towards a Leica MP body.</p> 
<p> Phil</p> 
<p>Dan Wajnman , June 25, 2004; 08:29 A.M. </p> 
<p>&quot;The Digilux 2 body is a basic Bauhaus 
&quot;form-follows-function&quot; box&quot; The original Barnack's Leica was a 
functional design, it accommodated two film-rolls and between them a lens, in a 
smallest possible shape. The lens was collapsible, making the camera 
wonderfully pocketable. Leica followed this design in all later models and 
although modern lenses could not be collapsed, the design reminded functional 
and the styling great. The D2 is a digicam camouflaged as a film camera. A bit 
like early cars, which looked like horse carriages. The styling is nice and 
everybody can recognize it as a horse carriage - sorry, as a film camera, which 
it is not. All this would not be important in the least, but the camera lacks 
functionality, it needs a grip and a movable LCD. This, I think, was sacrificed 
for marketing reasons, a pity. My other comment is concerned with the camera's 
small sensor and the resulting lack of DOF control. Great DOF is good for some 
situation but it cripples the camera for others, when one needs BOKEH and the 
3D effects it creates. The resulting images are very different to the ones 
captured on film or large sensors. This difference is in my opinion far more 
significant that the minute differences in noise and definition. Dan</p>

<p>My original posting was accurate. Prices on the Digilux are already 
tumbling=no buyers.</p> 
<p>S G , July 12, 2004; 09:22 A.M. </p> 
<p>Very helpful review by Andy. I have had the opportunity to handle the D2's 
in person, clearly the EVF is the biggest negative to me. That does not mean I 
won't buy this camera (wife's approval pending). I, for one, would like to 
state that I will buy this camera for the Leica brandname and the accompanying 
legend and quality. Same concept applies to exotic cars, timepieces, and other 
fine items - there are always cheaper and high quality items available. I doubt 
if the D2 bashers are not not guilty of succumbing to some premium brand name 
items. The premium demanded by Leica was not earned in one day. If the D2 is 
disappointing in quality, then Leica will have much to lose. There are 
obviously disparate views on the Digilux 2. I do have a question that perhaps 
someone could answer. The D2 won the DIMA contest. Does that lend some 
credibility to this camera or are the DIMA judges just nincompoops? Also, for 
those in favor of film Leica cameras but not the D2, can't you take good photos 
with other fine, cheaper film cameras (Nikon, Canon, etc., ) -- why Leica? I 
have never owned a Leica before but I do understand its appeal. My main reason 
for buying the D2 is that I know each photo I take with this camera will feel 
special...a word I would hardly use for cameras such as Nikon D70, Minolta A2, 
etc. etc.</p> 
<p>Kevin Parratt , July 27, 2004; 11:14 A.M. </p> 
<p>This is the year 2004. The viewfinder of the Leica Digilux 2 is lousy. 
Whilst the camera has many other impressive qualities, it is this first major 
drawback which compels me to hang on to my money. As a Leica M user, am I 
really meant to be seduced by the Digilux 2 styling? The lag time finally 
closes the books. Next please...!</p> 
<p>S G , July 28, 2004; 03:45 P.M. </p> 
<p>After my earlier comments (see above), I actually did purchase a Digilux 2, 
tried it for 2 weeks and then returned it. I did use the camera extensively for 
the 2 weeks so here are my comments / observations: - the design is beautiful 
and the camera just has a unique style to it - Exposures for the most part were 
fine, 90% of the time as I would want them to be although some results were 
very disappointing - Focus was the most disappointing for me, since of the more 
than 200 or 300 photos I took, about 75% were not focussed. This, of course, is 
due to handheld photography and varying light conditions; HOWEVER, when I have 
taken similar photos with a 35mm Contax SLR with 100 speed film, almost all 
photos were tack sharp. I do realize I could somehow improve my technique and 
'learn' to work the D2, however, there was just this nagging disappointment in 
this otherwise gorgeous camera. The spot AF also did not always seem to find 
the targeted spot. - Bottomline was that I was perhaps happy with just 5% of 
the results, which is not what I would expect from such an expensive camera. - 
Other points: EVF is not so bad as people make it out to be, but I did find 
myself using the LCD to compose photos a fair number of times since it is just 
awesome. The digital zoom is okay for amateur use and can be used on some rare 
occassions. Black &amp; White photos come out great in this camera, which I 
have found to be generally quite difficult with film cameras.</p> 
<p> I did my best to really like this camera and even thought of holding on to 
it, but in the very end I just could not convince myself to keep the camera. I 
was almost considering the purchase of a Canon EOS 10D, but since the good 
lenses are way too expensive and the whole kit makes for a heavy load, I have 
decided to get a Minolta A2, which is about 1/2 the price of the Digilux. I 
hate the look of the A2, but it seems to have top-notch features. Well, this 
was my first experience with Leica and not a very memorable one at that. Here 
are some sample photos I took with the D2:</p>

<p>What a great review. Of the 3 reviews I have read, this is the most 
complete. That said, however, I think Henri Cartier-Bresson would have disliked 
this camera - as I do.</p> 
<p> It is sad to see Leica produce such an inferior product. Beautiful it is, 
as are all Leicas (including my old but still functioning IIIc). Slow raw 
processing, slow and unsure focusing, and an electronic viewfinder really 
should not exist on a camera in this price range - digital or not (for another 
$5 they could have quadrupled the size of the buffer). In my opinion this 
camera will probably not do well for the Leica legend of excellence. Sad.</p> 
<p>David Haynes , August 12, 2004; 12:02 P.M. </p> 
<p>Excellent Review! </p> 
<p> I bought the D2 in April and it paid for itself (2 times over) the first 
job I used it on.</p> 
<p> I use both DSLRs, the D2 and film cameras (35mm, Medium Format and Large 
Format) in my business. Like other tools, it is appropriate to use the D2 in 
situations where it's strengths will be apparent. I have yet to see the perfect 
camera for all situations.</p> 
<p> This business of dogging the D2 for its weaknesses is akin to saying that 
my Deardorff 8x10 is no good because it cannot be hand-held, or that a 
Hasselblad is no good because its lenses aren't as fast as a 35mm or DSLR.</p> 
<p> The fact is that all cameras are tools and have both strengths and 
weaknesses. We wouldn't expect to use a clawhammer to remove an allenhead 
screw, would we?</p> 
<p> That said, in my opinion the D2 has been of great value to me. As a long 
time user of the Leica M system, I knew going in that any Leica camera would 
carry a premium price. That's just the way it's always been with Leica.</p> 
<p> I can only speak for myself, but for me the price seems fair. After all, 
I'm getting a Leica-designed Vario-Summicron that covers the fields of view of 
a 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 75mm and 90mm, plus a camera that produces magical image 
files in both JPG and RAW formats, for less than the price of a current M6 or 
M7 body (or most single lenses for the M system).</p> 
<p> Other than its twin (Panosonci LC1) the D2 is the only digital camera I'm 
aware of that allows the photographer to set all the shooting controls 
(aperture, zoom, focus, shutter speed, etc.) without powering on and entering 
various levels of level. In fact, there have been times when I've set up for a 
shot by feel alone, without even looking at the camera controls.</p> 
<p> Bottom line for me is that the D2 has let me get photographs in situations 
when I would not have otherwise gotten them with other available equipment.</p> 
<p>Dave Leung , August 16, 2004; 02:21 A.M. </p> 
<p>Thank you, Andy, for such a concise and well written opinion of Leica's 
latest digital camera. Following three months of shooting with the Digilux 2, I 
find myself sharing many of the same conclusions. If I had to name one aspect 
of the camera which most needed improvement, it would be one which was 
expressed earlier by S.G., namely, the focusing. I am unsure what malady 
plagues my Digilux 2, but I have had more than my share of misfocused pictures. 
I own and believe I know how to use autofocus cameras. I would have a difficult 
time believing that the out-of-focus shots are primarily due to operator error 
such as not properly aiming at the intended subject or forgetting to pre-focus 
while composing. Spot focusing helps somewhat, but it's not easy to judge until 
the image is viewed on a proper computer monitor. On the other hand, the 
biggest positive I take away is that I find myself taking more pictures again. 
The Digilux 2, for all it's imperfections and idiosyncrasies, is a joy to use. 
It's size, shape, and weight are ideal and thus, makes it very versatile. The 
low compression jpegs are remarkably detailed. Combine these with it's well 
placed controls a seasoned photographer would feel immediately comfortable 
using, and the Digilux 2 is without comparison in the digital realm. It's a 
tool which does nothing perfectly, but most things well. It is the Ideal 
Compromise! I've used DSLRS and other digicams, but this is the first digital 
camera which I enjoy using and find myself wanting to use. As I wrote earlier, 
I am taking more pictures again.</p> 
<h4> Some Digilux 2 Images </h4> 
<p>Andy Piper , August 19, 2004; 02:45 A.M. </p> 
<p>Just thought I'd add an update RE the focusing problems mentioned. </p> 
<p> I have had no problems, but others have mentioned them here and elsewhere, 
so they're real.</p> 
<p> 1) Some D2/LC-1s apparently have poorly aligned sensors, so that pictures 
shot at &quot;infinity&quot; or elsewhere on the focusing ring are not actually 
focused there. A warranty fix, and easy to test for.</p> 
<p> 2) There is a conceptual flaw in the D2/LC-1 AF indicator. Correct 
autofocus is indicated by a green dot that lights up in the viewfinder. 
INCORRECT or FAILED AF is indicated by a green dot that lights up -and then 
flashes.</p> 
<p> This means that if you shoot as soon as you see the green dot, you may be 
shooting an unfocused picture. You have to wait an extra moment to see if the 
dot remains steady - or flashes.</p> 
<p> A red dot for &quot;no focus&quot; would have been a better warning than a 
flashing green dot, which can look like a &quot;good focus&quot; indicator for 
the first .5 second.</p> 
<p> Since I don't use AF much, I missed this potential problem in the original 
review.</p> 
<p> Other than that - no significant additional news. Except that I've quit 
shooting SLOW color film. The Leica M6s live on B&amp;W and the once-a-year 
roll of 400 color - the Digilux gets the rest. I weep trying to scan my few 
&quot;legacy&quot; color slides. &quot;Darn - I wish I'd had the Digilux to 
shoot this with&quot; is what usually springs to mind.</p> 
<p> REALLY looking forward to the digital back for the Leica SLR coming this 
fall - as a preview for how the Digital M will perform.</p> 
<p>Georg Nyman , August 20, 2004; 12:44 P.M. </p> 
<p>Well, first I must admit, I did not read all comments before I started 
writing mine. But I was surprised how good that camera performs regarding image 
quality compared to the Leica M6 with the 1,4/35mm lens. Maybe some of the 
details of the film image are not visible on the web, but overall, having seen 
these comparison photos, I am asking myself why spending thousands of Dollars 
for the Leica M6 lenses if that digital camera can do it almost better. Another 
reason why I shoot more or less everything on 120/220 film - there is no 
digital camera (yet) available which can beat roll film performance. Overall a 
very interested review and very well done ( I do review myself as well ) - 
thanks for that excellent review! George N. Nyman PhD. http://www.gnyman.com</p>
<p>Paul Reading , September 04, 2004; 07:25 P.M. </p> 
<p>There is one flaw with the D2 which has not been discussed. the D2 has an 
AF lens and to move to or from manual focusing you need to depress a small 
button, this is a good feature. however, when you move from manual to AF, the 
ring can easily be turned one more step to AF-macro. On many occasions I have 
used the camera only to find that the AF mode has slipped into the macro mode 
in error. It should require another press of the small button to move to macro 
mode in my opinion.</p> 
<p>Jay Dougherty , September 23, 2004; 12:08 P.M. </p> 
<p>The price tag is a joke, a bad joke. The brunt of the joke is unfortunately 
Leica itself.</p> 
<p> Leica will not sell many. Back to the drawing board, folks.</p> 
<p>Anthony Brookes , September 30, 2004; 04:40 A.M. </p> 
<p>Having looked at a number of cumbersome large digital cameras the prospect 
of having one near M6 size with more conventional controls is attractive. 
Normally I am wary of new products but yours is the second review I have read 
which suggests the Digilux 2 is well worth looking at. If its resale value 
holds up when the inevitable 10mp version arrives then the initial cost of the 
D2 may be acceptable. I am now going out to try one as a result of your 
comprehensive review. Many thanks.</p> 
<p>Joseph Coalter , October 20, 2004; 10:03 P.M. </p> 
<p>This is a great review, just what I've been looking for. After reading the 
review, I purchased the Panasonic version for under $1,100. I use three Fuji 
medium format manual cameras, and I hope this digital will be a perfect 
companion to them. They will work in similar ways with similar capabilities. I 
hope to use the Panasonic to do test shots to support the big Fujis, and I 
should be able to do less bracketing after going through a learning curve. This 
camera fills a gap for me, and should be a good carry around camera for general 
use.</p> 
<p>Gianfranco Ceccolini , October 31, 2004; 05:09 P.M. </p> 
<p>First of all, I'd like to say that's a very good review of the camera. I've 
bought mine in April 2004 and till that date, had only found one single review 
which was good, but focused a bit on the good side. Reading a review that 
points both sides is a real pleasure. I agree with most of the points. Raw 
buffer inexistence is the common complaint in all I've read and I can't 
disagree with that. I despise it so much...</p> 
<p> The motive I'm writing this is because, albeit is a great review, it lacks 
the same point all others do so: The LCD screen. The big-light-high 
definition-etc LCD screen. I love it and it really changed my way of 
photographing.</p> 
<p> One of the reasons I bought a digital camera with fixed lens in place of 
and DSLR (I used a great Canon A-1 that belonged to my father since 1979 and 
was given to me in 2000 and my first idea when moving to digital was getting a 
DSLR, probably Rebel or D70)is because I can't stand the idea of having to 
clean the sensor once a year or so. Of course, there are other reasons I chose 
the Digilux 2 (desing, retro style, manual controls, Leica lenses, etc) but the 
&quot;sealed body&quot; was a strong point in my decision. Being used to the 
A-1, the Digilux 2 manual operations made the decision easy, even with the high 
price compared to other cameras. As told in the review, I could have bought the 
Lumix LC-1, but I live in Brasil and there's no authorized Lumix dealear that 
sells that model. I've been the second brazillian to get a Digilux 2 in the 
authorized Leica Dealer.</p> 
<p> As I started to use it, I got really impressed with some attributes and 
disapointed with others. It is my first digital, so I was kind of a newbie in 
the subject. Really expected the autofocus to be faster, for example. As the 
A-1 is manual focus, it doesn't matter. I continue on manual. I am able to 
focus quickly and I have a pre-focus technique using the numbers on the focus 
ring :-)</p> 
<p> As I got used to it, the thing that got me really in love with it was the 
LCD screen. I've seen previous digital cameras from friends, but the LCD screen 
thay had were really bad. Just served for picture identification while in play 
mode and framing when shooting. With the Digilux 2, things are different. I've 
got a Rolleyflex from a friend for some time and was realy interested in seeing 
the picture that would be taken on the unpolished glass. I have the same 
feeling with the Digilux 2, but in a better way. The LCD gives me the 
opportunity to see the picture BEFORE it is taken and that is something 
marvellous. The LCD quality is very good. Don't know if it's the best that 
technology permits to be done, but is the best compared to any digital camera. 
Being able to see the image prior to taking the shot, and not just an authopsy 
of the picture taken as with any DSLR, is really a bonus I didn't expect. Of 
course it isn't perfect and even doesn't work well in all conditions. The image 
seen in my computer's monitor is way better, but my eyes are learning to see 
the real photo through the LCD.</p> 
<p> This is a point that I've never seen anybody talk about and it's a real 
good thing that the digital world has given me. It changes drastically the 
approach to photography, the way the photographer interacts with the subject 
and widens the possibilities a lot.</p> 
<p> One more thing is about the resolution. I know that 5MP is less that the 
lenses &quot;deserve&quot; but RAW mode makes this a minor problem. Using 
Photoshop you can increase resolution to 5120x3852 pixels with minor losses. 
That is more resolution anyone could ask. I don't know if the quatilly loss it 
gives is a problem for professionals, but it solved my needs as an amateur...:-)
</p> 
<p> That's it. I love Digilux 2. Don't regret to spend the 1850 USD in it at 
all. Since April, I''ve taken 22000 (yes, twelve two tousend) photos and for 
sure it really paid for itself...</p> 
<p>Peter Bilitch , November 10, 2004; 03:20 A.M. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> For me this review was especially interesting, since it came out at the 
same time as I posted my Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC1 for sale on eBay, which is in 
turn about five months after I originally purchased it.</p> 
<p> I decided upon the LC1 largely from reading the personal experiences of 
people on the dpreview forums and seeing the images that they displayed. I also 
compared the images and musings visible on the forums for the various 8 
Megapixel offerings, such as the Minolta A2, the Olympus C-8080 and the Canon 
Powershot Pro1.</p> 
<p> The deciding factors for me to buy the LC1 were largely two-fold. One 
being a technical [theoretical] consideration, while the other was an more 
aesthetic [subjective] approach.</p> 
<p> The technical theorising concerned the speed and range of the lens, i.e. 
f/2 was faster than any other digicam offering and I was happy that the 28-90mm 
could provide a general purpose range for what might be termed as a 
'normalised' field of view.</p> 
<p> My criteria for aesthetic concerns, were won over by the colour rendition 
that I could see in the images I had seen. These images consistently displayed 
the warm tones of the familiar Leica hue.</p> 
<p> What failed to satisfy after almost half a year of daily use, was the 
frequent presence of noise, even in images that had been brightly lit at the 
time of exposure.</p> 
<p> I had seen examples of this before I bought the camera, but the vast 
majority of images posted, whether on the forums or on website reviews, were 
shot with the CCD exposure rated at 100 ISO, so I incorrectly assumed that the 
f/2 lens overcame the need for such a frequent use of higher ISO rates.</p> 
<p> I could obtain noise free images from exposures recorded by the CCD at ISO 
100, but everything else displayed a level of grain that I did not wish to see 
and more to the point, was something that I never learned to accept.</p> 
<p> There are users who say that the smooth gradation of the speckled grain 
from the noise produced by this camera, lends an air of character to the final 
image. Maybe so, maybe...</p> 
<p> It is interesting to note that despite the high level of manual operation 
available with this camera, even when the aperture ring is turned to the f/2 
setting, that the user is very often comprimised [forced] by the camera into 
accepting a f/2.4 aperture rating.</p> 
<p> The zoom range became something of a limitation, but this was the lesser 
of any issues for me. I simply find that I am becoming more interested in 
creating wider angled images and therefore want to explore beyond the field of 
view provided with a 28mm lens. Although this is currently a mute point with my 
new DSLR, because I have an f/2.8 20-35mm zoom lens which is transformed into 
an effective 30-52.5mm lens due to the 1.5x factoring by the CCD.</p> 
<p> So now that I have mentioned my new venturing into Digital SLR territory, 
I will satisfy the curious about which model of DSLR I purchased. It's the 
Nikon D70.</p> 
<p> To add just one comment about the D70 and why I chose this model. It does 
satisfy my search for less noise and yet I am quite sure that it will be 
replaced within two years from now, due to the current trend of digital SLR 
camera production to bring out new models every two years, which in turn is due 
to the relative immaturity and rapid advances in the digital technology. In 
other words, I wanted the Nikon D2H, but I decided to save myself 2000 Euros, 
at least for now that is...</p> 
<p> Here is an admittedly unfair comparison of noise results, but I think that 
they are interesting representations, and anyway I currently have no other more 
relevant images stored here at photo.net:</p> 
<p> Panasonic LC1 @ ISO 100 </p> 
<p> Nikon D70 @ ISO 1600 </p>

<p>Robert Schellhammer , December 06, 2004; 08:00 P.M. </p> 
<p>I bought the Panasonic version for cosmetic reasons. The price difference 
is non-existent if you factor in the need to increase the warranty to 3 years 
and buy RAW conversion software for the Panasonic.</p> 
<p>Gavin Sterrett , December 24, 2004; 01:14 A.M. </p> 
<p>Wow! I've read the review twice now and can't imagine why anyone who 
doesn't have money to burn would by such a hunk of junk. I liked the one 
commentator's analogy comparing it to a British car! The only redeeming factor 
I can see in this overpriced, outperformed dinosaur is its lens, which appears 
to be fabulous (as are all leica lenses). But I am afraid that doesn't come 
close to justifying its cost or shortcomings. I would rather spend $600 on a 
used Canon EOS D60 (which, from what I've just read and seen, outperforms this 
camera by a mile) and then spend the difference in price choosing from the vast 
array of fantastic EOS lenses available. But hey, I guess I just wouldn't look 
as cool walking around with my Canon as I would with a Leica!</p> 
<p>Jurgen Banda-Hansmann , January 02, 2005; 11:50 A.M. </p> 
<p>Andy, great article. I appreciated your balanced review. It helped me a lot 
in my decision process, buying my digital camera. I ended up with the LC 1. The 
better price and included accessories made the decision for me. The areas of 
critique are valid, though I got accustomed to the electronic viewfinder. Sure, 
with a DSLR, I wouldn't have to worry about the slow RAW recording and limited 
ISO, but the smaller size gave me oppurtunity to take pictures, I would not 
have been able to do with a bigger DSLR. At the end of the day, it is decision 
of personal preferences and style. Thanks for the really good review. Jurgen</p>
<p>Brett S , January 02, 2005; 05:04 P.M. </p> 
<p>here's my attempt to throw a little more kerosene on the D2 vs. DSLR flame 
war...</p> 
<p> I've owned a Nikon D70 for about 4 months. I think it's a great camera 
that takes very good photos. I bought it with the 18-70mm kit lens, and have 
purchased a few other lenses and filters to round out the package. I've 
probably taken about 1200 shots with it so far, and find that's it's pretty 
easy to use once you get acclimated to its setup. I have found that the only 
way I can get acceptable photos is by shooting in the 'M' manual mode, setting 
all controls myself. Autofocus is fairly good and fast, but in low light 
situations, the camera often is unable to focus at all, forcing me to switch to 
manual mode, and often causing me to miss shots entirely. I would have been 
better off with a $50 P&amp;S camera in those cases. Still, it has a great 
memory buffer and basically no lag time, even in RAW mode.</p> 
<p> So my feelings about my Nikon D70 are mixed. And when I factor in the 
accessories and glass that I've accumulated, the Nikon is no cheaper than the 
Leica. And is much more expensive than the Panasonic LC1. Altho it has more 
versatility.</p> 
<p> But I digress. Before I bought the D70, I borrowed a coworker's Panasonic 
LC1 for some quick photos I needed. I wasn't familiar with his camera at all, 
and wasn't aware of its pedigree. So I had low expectations for the results. 
However, I found the camera incredibly easy to work with, and the photos were 
clearly better than ANY I've ever taken with my Nikon. Which is why I find 
myself reading this review. I intend to keep the Nikon around for telephoto and 
macro work. But I'm planning to purchase either the Panasonic or Leica for all 
my other needs.</p> 
<p> Anybody who tells you that their DSLR takes better photos than the 
Leica/Panasonic has never compared the results. The photos you get with the 
Leica/Panasonic really ARE special. Compare specs all you want. But for me, 
it's all about the photos.</p>

<p>After the disappointment of seeing the silver 'metal' finish being rapidly 
worn on my Leica Digilux 1, I had hoped for an improvement with the Digilux 2 
finish. Alas, it too is already showing signs of the metallic finish wearing 
through to a very unattractive white underneath. Plastic, surely not, not for 
Leica, not at this price! I've had Leica M6s for years and they do not wear. 
Come on Leica, make you digital cameras with a better finish than this. A Leica 
should last forever! Is this the Panasonic effect?</p> 
<p>Brian Edwards , February 19, 2005; 06:32 P.M. </p> 
<p>I wonder who would be willing to pay for a camera body that will last for 
50 years but whose technology (i.e., sensor) will be essentially obsolete in 
one or two years. Unless the camera comes equipped with user- or 
factory-upgradable sensors (now there's an idea), I am not sure if I would be 
willing to pay through the nose for such a &quot;durable&quot; camera.</p> 
<p>John Falkenstine , March 07, 2005; 12:52 A.M. </p> 
<p>My June 6 2004 observation was correct &quot;Leica ist Kaputt&quot; now 
going into receivership as credit has been withdrawn from the company. When you 
sleep through a technology change, you pays the price. If you have a good name, 
you've got to keep it good. Making junk and hoping the good name will obfuscate 
that its junk just doesn't work in the technology world. Philips, the Ostrich 
from Eindhoven is next...</p> 
<p>Andy Piper , March 09, 2005; 02:09 A.M. </p> 
<p>John's post regarding Leica's financial position has several inaccuracies 
that need correcting (it must be those almost-spring breezes off the Santa 
Catalinas making him dizzy):</p> 
<p> &quot;My June 6 2004 observation was correct...(June 6 quote: &quot;I 
predict that it will have a very short life.)&quot;</p> 
<p> OOOPS! </p> 
<p> The Digilux has been out over a year, with no replacement on the horizon - 
hardly a &quot;short life&quot; in the digital world (where, for example, 
Leica's partner Panasonic went from the FZ1 through the FZ10 to the FZ20 in a 
year).</p> 
<p> ------- </p> 
<p> &quot;Leica ist Kaputt&quot; now going into receivership as credit has 
been withdrawn from the company.&quot;</p> 
<p> OOOPS! </p> 
<p> Leica is NOT even close to receivership. In accordance with German 
business law, banks have frozen SOME credit lines because Leica expects a big 
loss for 2004-05 (Euros 10 million against assets of Euros 83 million), and the 
banks want to know how Leica plans to stem the losses (to be revealed in a 
stockholders' meeting May 1). Sort of like a parent calling the kid at college 
and saying &quot;We aren't sending another check until you tell us how you 
spent the last one.&quot;</p> 
<p> In Leica's words (3-Q report March 1, 2005): &quot;These reductions of 
credit lines do not as yet endanger the Company?s solvency.&quot;</p> 
<p> ------ </p> 
<p> &quot;Making junk and hoping the good name will obfuscate that its junk 
just doesn't work in the technology world.&quot;</p> 
<p> Leica suffered a 35% decline in income from sales of its 
interchangeable-lens (&quot;system&quot;) 35mm film cameras, i.e. the M and R 
lines. Leica had a GAIN of 40% in income from sales of compact cameras - which 
includes the Digilux 2.</p> 
<p> In others words - it was the high-quality lines with the &quot;good 
name&quot; that went into the tank - and it's the so-called &quot;junk&quot; 
Digilux 2 that's saved Leica's bacon - or at least slowed the decline.</p> 
<p> OOOPS! </p> 
<p> To quote Leica again: &quot;Sales of the Leica compact cameras, among them 
the digital LEICA DIGILUX 2 model, grew by 40.2 % to Euros 13.7 million. From 
the point of view of the Company?s Board of Management, these facts prove 
Leica?s ability to offer attractive digital solutions. The sales volume of such 
solutions, however, could not make up for the declines in the analogue 
business.&quot;</p> 
<p> None of which affects the capabilities or limitations of the camera as 
described.</p> 
<p>Seamus Phan , March 14, 2005; 12:59 P.M. </p> 
<p>I bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC1 (the cousin to Digilux 2) a month 
back, after a long deliberation, and lots of &quot;jeers&quot; from other users 
who insisted I should spend the same amount and get something like a Nikon D70, 
or simply go for the much cheaper cousin, the FZ20.</p> 
<p> However, there is an innate charm to the LC1 (or Digilux 2), with all the 
manual or auto controls you need in 3 rings around the lens, and the build 
quality is the most refined in any digital camera I have seen (DSLRs included).
</p> 
<p> Needless to say, the images are great, and like many other reviewers and 
users acclaimed, the image is the key, and a bit of noise can always be cleared 
up with a variety of tools, including Noise Ninja, Kodak GEM Pro, and others.
</p> 
<p> As for the slow RAW processing without a built-in buffer, I use the RAW 
mode primarily for stills and scenics, and so the slow processing means 
nothing, since I shoot with a tripod and the cable release (remote), and take 
my time. For motion and action shots, the JPEG high works rather well, and the 
pictures always retain that illusive and hard-to-explain Leica quality.</p> 
<p> A great camera, a great pal to travel with, always loved.</p> 
<p>Jens Evensen , March 20, 2005; 07:48 P.M. </p> 
<p>I think this is a very good camera! I have been using it (the Panasonic 
LC1) since sept. 04. The colors are very good!</p> 
<p>John Falkenstine , March 27, 2005; 12:13 P.M. </p> 
<p>yup, yup I'm wrong on everything right? BTW my German is fluent, I read the 
company's financial report as well...I re-iterate what I said above. The 
company's income is not sufficient to support its continuing operation..It's 
late to the digital dinner table, its offerings are nothing special. Banks 
withold credit for a reason, and Leica's ability to manage itself financially 
have a poor track record. I don't exactly see folks standing in line to buy the 
company, and there's a reason for that..soon it might be much, much cheaper to 
buy Leica..</p> 
<p>Juan Monino , May 23, 2005; 02:08 P.M. </p> 
<p>Well, after reading this excellent review and all its critics, I still went 
and bought the D2 for $1279 including tax and s/h.</p> 
<p> I could buy the Panasonic version or even a Nikon D-70 for much less, but 
I decided to purchase a Leica D2, and I will tell you guys the reason why:</p> 
<p> The same reason I bought a Rolex watch instead of a SEIKO or a TIMEX: Even 
thought the SEIKO or the TIMEX watch offer better features than a Rolex and 
they are even more precise...a Rolex is a Rolex. And a Leica is a Leica, and I 
carry my Leica around the same way I carry my Rolex: with great pleasure, 
because I like it, and because I feel good ...and because I have the dough to 
afford it.</p> 
<p>John Falkenstine , May 29, 2005; 05:14 P.M. </p> 
<p>God bless the marketing of a myth....and those who need the myth to be wyth.
</p> 
<p>John Kelly , May 29, 2005; 08:10 P.M. </p> 
<p>On another forum its said that Pansonic is now going entirely 4/3... </p> 
<p> About time. </p> 
<p> 4/3 will enable much smaller lenses (far smaller diagonal than 2X3)and in 
turn a much smaller body...presumably 8mp, like Olympus.</p> 
<p> I sure hope they do it soon. They'd sell a zillion D3s at 3X Canon's price 
if they just managed to equal Canon G6.</p> 
<p>Landrum Kelly , June 11, 2005; 07:50 A.M. </p> 
<p>To Juan Morino: You may have the dough to buy a Rolex, but if you think 
that a camera with the capacity to save one (1) RAW file at a time is the 
photographic equivalent of a Rolex, then by all means spread the wealth around. 
There's a sucker born every minute, not to mention two con men ready to take 
advantage of him.</p> 
<p> None of this is express disrespect for Leica. It is to say that this 
camera is not up to the standards that we have come to expect of that great 
company. Great optics and intuitive analog controls do not by themselves make 
for great shooting.</p> 
<p>Arthur Yeo , August 25, 2005; 12:45 A.M. </p> 
<p>Andy, </p> 
<p> The Japanese website of Panasonic seem to indicate that all the so-called 
Leica lenses in the Panasonic cameras are actually designed by Panasonic and 
quality-controlled using Leica standard equipment and processes and that the 
designs of the lenses are approved by Leica AG.</p> 
<p> In other words, Leica did NOT design the Lumix lenses at all, let alone 
manufacturing them.</p> 
<p> When you have a chance, I would appreciate if you can clarify this point. 
Thanks!</p> 
<p>Philip Clarke , August 29, 2005; 07:28 P.M. </p> 
<p>One thing that should be noted is 28mm f2, no other digital that I know of 
does this, Canon G5 goes down to 35 f2 but then you have to add a supplementary 
lens. Taking into account the average Digital SLR (or the Epson rangefinder) 
magnification of 1.6 one needs a 17.5mm f2 err, which doesn't exist so for the 
wide angle digital user this camera is unique. One can buy a Sigma 20mm f1.8 
which gives about 30mm but it's massive and it's a Sigma.<br>
<br>
 So while 
others are shooting at f2.8 (with a 17mm) at iso 400 the Leica shoots at iso 
200, or as the article suggests iso 100 and pulled a couple of stops with the 
lens no longer at open aperture.<br>
<br>
 Now whose going to test this out for 
the group them ?</p>

<p>Having spent nearly two years with the Digilux 2, I've come to find that 
with all it's perceived shortcomings, this camera is still a joy to use. Though 
my 20D is probably technically superior, the Leica sees far more playing time.

<h4> <b>Digilux 2 Gallery</b> </h4> 
<p>Richard Clark , January 11, 2007; 03:20 A.M. </p> 
<p>In April 2005 I sold my Venice Beach house and took off looking for Zane 
Grey's America, I had all my Digital Video cameras but wanted a reasonable 
digital still camera with a good lens, singular, didn't want digital and dust, 
so bought the Digilux 2 from Samy's in Venice. I shot JPEG before I discovered 
RAW and posted shots to my Blog at kiwicafe.com. I had a ball, loved the camera 
for it's point and shoot, me not being a pro. Fast forward to 2007. I am now in 
New Zealand I used the Digi2 today, I love it. I bought a Nikon D200 plus ALL 
the lenses and gear but for me, I would get rid of it all and keep the 
Digilux2. I dropped it in a NZ river, on rocks, dried it off and it worked 
fine, seriously, but then I noticed a water spot in the centre of the lens 
where it dried, bugger! I am not a techy so decided NOT to dismantle but sent 
it to Germany where after 2 goes thay got it right. It's as good as new. There 
is now a new version with interchangeable lenses or the new M8, beyond my range 
today but if I hadn't bought the D200 I would be an M8 sort of guy, so there, 
bugger me but Leica is good.</p> 
<p>Andrew Bamji , September 10, 2007; 08:54 A.M. </p> 
<p>Digilux vs Panasonic? The camera(s) may be the same but the backup is 
different.</p> 
<p> I fell over with my Digilux 2 (composing a shot, missed a step but got the 
shot in the end). The CCD dislocated itself and the camera had to go back for a 
new one.</p> 
<p> Cost? Nil. had it been a Panasonic I would have paid a substantial sum for 
a re-do which would not have been covered by insurance. So you might save by 
buying cheap in the first place, but will end up paying for it in the end!</p> 
<p> When I can afford it I will go for a D3, not least as it takes M lnses, of 
which I have several!</p> 
<p>Brian Wright , February 03, 2008; 04:27 P.M. </p> 
<p>I,m just getting back into photography after 20 odd years...used to be a 
big Canon man A1,AE1-PROG..FP4 user. To be honest...i have always been 
mesmirised by the little red dot...so i have been doing some research and i 
have managed to locate a mint unused digilux 1 and 2...there is 300 pounds 
difference between the two...iam familiar with the 1 and think that it takes 
good shots at 100asa...so the question is since im just getting back into 
it..is the extrs for the 2 worth it as really all i need is auto with option 
for manual.From what i,ve seen the 1 does take natural 35mm type shots...iam 
not an experienced digital user. Cheers Brian</p>

France_Provence_ Taken By D2
<p></p> 
<p>Simply to say~!I love the camera, Bring me back to the old day. I have use 
one Digilux2 and 4 Panasonic lc1, there were all sold, but I just miss the 
camera so much, and also bought one 2nd few days ago. I was so happy with it. 
the Iq quality is very close to the film, also the operation is good, few 
weakness, but as old says &quot;if I can live with it&quot;. and they really 
don't make things like this camera anymore. It's hard to find the D2 and Lc1 on 
the net,( I am from Taiwan ). I may getting the D2 as will. they are the sam 
camera, if there is any differences, but if you can't see the differences on 
the IQ, what's the point to care the &quot;differences&quot;, I just love both 
of them. get one. and does lots photos for commercial work, like print out on 
the large wall...People always amazed the photo's were taken by this old and 
only 5mg pix camera. The lance is really very good quality, see what it does to 
the 5mg IQ, I really don't know what to complain about. and it's so cheap now 
as 2nd in the turn's of the overall quality. Jeff from Taiwan</p> 
<p>jeff chen , July 11, 2008; 11:16 A.M. </p> <br>
very one should know where 
it is_taken by D2 
<p></p> 
<p>I love the density of the camera, really love it </p> 
<p>jeff chen , July 11, 2008; 11:18 A.M. </p> <br>
No ND filter 
<p></p> 
<p>Was taken some where in Nice_ I didn't use any ND filters, use the Raw to 
save lots detail back from the sky and the shadow, The Raw was very good at the 
time, but the raw is better now in any cameras, but still good enough, I can 
live with it and happy.</p> 
<p>Robert Schellhammer , October 05, 2008; 05:23 P.M. </p> 
<p>It has been almost 4 years since I purchased the Panasonic version of the 
Digilux 2. The camera is still in use, since I haven't found a suitable 
replacement and it has certainly paid for itself. I love the 4:3 format and 
despite the modest 5 MP resolution, no one has complained about the file size 
since the quality of the lens and the spectacular quality of its jpeg 
rendition. I hardly ever shoot raw. This greatly reduces post-processing &amp; 
tweaking. I am considering the Digilux 3 or the Olympus E-3. For me the major 
issues are quality in the optics rather than post-process correction and the 
simplicity/user-friendliness of the tool. P.s. I shoot mostly architecture and 
have been quite happy stitching together several images when I need either more 
resolution or wider perspective. I have always enjoyed &quot;limitations&quot; 
as the fuel for creativity (or - is there some other way I can get there?).

<p>it was 11th january 2007 when I wrote about my love of the D2 . . . . and 
so time marches on, the older I get the less I am prepared to buy crap, no more 
Nikon, my Digilux2 has converted me to Leica big time, now I have the D2 and 
also an M8 with 3 lenses. Just held my first exhibition in New Zealand, Leica 
photography. Even sold a few. I have read all the reports as to what the Leicas 
can and can't do and my position today is that they give me a sense of image 
capturing where what I see is what I get, not what a camera/computer 
interprets. The lenses, awesome; 16/18/21, 50, 90 and now I am looking for an 
M6 body and a 28mm Lens, after that maybe a Noblex, maybe. Got rid of my D200 
with all the lenses, whew!</p> 
<p>John Thawley , February 05, 2009; 09:22 P.M. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> I'm head over heels about this camera. Even with it's quirky technical 
shortcomings, it is a camera that makes me want to go out and take pictures. 
While I make my living shooting with Canon kit, my Digilux 2(s) are never out 
of reach. The Leica Digilux 2 puts the fun back in making pictures.</p> 
<p> These pictures show my personalized pair. The leather treatment was done 
by cameraleather.com and the bags by m-classics.com. I also keep a native 
version and a Pansonic LC1.</p> 
<p> More about the Digilux 2 on my blog at http://www.johnthawley.com </p> 
<p> Great review... though I think times have changed. This camera has come 
into its own and time has revealed some genuine Leica DNA.</p>
