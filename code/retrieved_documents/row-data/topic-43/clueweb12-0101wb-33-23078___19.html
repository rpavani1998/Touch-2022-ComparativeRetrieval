<p>The <strong>Nikon CoolPix P7000 Digital Camera</strong> isn't loaded down 
with frivolous bells and whistles--it's got<em>seriously&nbsp;awesome</em> 
bells and whistles like a 10.1MP CCD sensor, a sharp,&nbsp;wide-angle to

shutter is pressed, then selects and saves the sharpest image, while 
the&nbsp;Electronic Virtual Horizon Display&nbsp;gives you a guide for precise 
leveling of the camera in landscape or portrait orientation during LCD monitor 
shooting.&nbsp; There's also the Smart Portrait System, with In-Camera Red-Eye

<p>P7000 Review First off let me say this, this camera is NOT a replacement 
for an SLR. For low light situations, or tacking pictures quickly of fast 
moving subjects there is no substitute for an SLR. That said, this is still am 
impressive little camera. Pros:&bull; EV Dial. Having a dedicated dial to 
adjust the EV settings is very convenient. I have found that the camera tends 
to make shots alittle to dark for my tastes, so I often shoot at it +.3 to 
overcome this&bull; Picture controls. I own a D700 and love how I can fine tune 
the saturation and hue to make colors pop. This camera will also allow you to 
do this, and it makes a noticeable improvement.&bull; The 3 User settings on 
the main command dial. You can program some very unique settings into the 
camera and quickly recall them for many situations. &bull; The hot shoe is 
great for mounting on a real flash. This built in flash works well on anything 
that is close to the camera, but it is very weak in even slightly demanding 
situations. &bull; White Balance. You can program three preset custom white 
balance cards. I use an Expodisc for my D700, you can use it for this little 
camera too! (Do not press the disk too hard over the lens or you could damage 
it) Also you can adjust the white balance manually by degrees Kelvin, just as 
with a pro SLR.Cons:&bull; ISO performance. I have to disagree strongly with 
the cameras proclaimed ability to do very well in low light. Pictures are 
noticeably noisy starting at ISO 400, so I try to limit it to only 200 or so. 
&bull; Autofocus. In optimum situations it works fine, but when zoomed out it 
can really start hunting for a lock on. After three or four failed attempts the 
camera actually will display a &quot;reinitializing the lens&quot; message, and 
will retract and redeploy the lens.. You can focus manually, and it displays a 
magnified image of what you're focusing on in the center to assist you. But 
it's a cumbersome system.&bull; Battery Indicator. The camera only tells you 
the battery power remaining when it's about to die!?! &bull; Menu settings. 
There are certain functions in the camera that are locked out depending on 
which shooting mode you have the camera set. For example Interval Timer is 
locked out of the main P,S,A,M priority settings&hellip;...why?&bull; WB 
Balance. Yes I listed the WB as a Pro above, but it also has a negative. Under 
normal in the house lighting everything is yellow, and I mean VERY yellow. This 
is easily overcome by fine tuning the white balance, but it's still an extra 
step that might cause you to miss a good shot. &bull; View Finder. The 
viewfinder is useful for bright sunny days, but it only covers 80% of the 
frame. What it covers is perfectly centered, but you have to bear that in mind 
when composing images. &bull; Low light function. Turn this on and see for 
yourself. Very noisy right from the screen! It's a very nice camera if you 
understand its limitations, anyone who loves fine tuning with settings on their 
SLR's will love this as a causal take everywhere camera.</p>

<p>I eagerly awaited this camera as a replacement for my Canon G10. I'm a 
Nikon fan-boy and was glad to see Nikon in this market segment. Alas, there are 
several deal breakers that put this camera behind it's chief rival. I bought 
the camera yesterday from the 9th Ave store and I'm returning it today. There 
was no floor sample for me to try.I saw a review and forum postings on [@] and 
didn't believe them. Image quality seems near- or equal-DSLR. I didn't bother 
with reviewing the images after I realized I don't want a camera with this kind 
of performance. Here's my experience with the camera, as limited as it is.1) No 
RAW buffer. The camera locks after a RAW image is captured and does not release 
until the file is written. Most enthusiasts and pros shoot RAW. Hello, Nikon, I 
thought you were listening to your customers. This is so eight years ago.2) 
Slow refresh after menu settings. The G10 returns to the image preview 
instantly after a setting has been changed. The Nikon hesitates before 
refreshing the screen. Especially annoying after changing ISO or White Balance. 
The Canon has a ISO dial. At least the Nikon has a dial for exposure 
compensation.3) Itsy-bitsy dials and buttons. I don't have large hands, but the 
controls seemed tiny to me, especially compared to the G10. The control wheel 
on the back of the camera, near the top of the body is too small to move 
easily, as are the other controls on the top of the body. Nikon is known for 
it's ergonomics, but who tested this camera?4) The camera got warm. The right 
thumb rest on the back of the body got warm after only a few minutes of use. 
Wasting energy here; Nikon claims 350 exposures per charge. I wonder if that's 
optimistic. And, no replacement battery is available as of this writing.5) 
Where's the articulated LCD? Canon G11 has one, other Nikon models have them. 
If you have to use the screen to aim the camera, why not have the convenience 
one that swings and rotates? 6) Why not a 24mm equivalent? OK, maybe it would 
have to be only 135mm or 180mm at the long end. I could live with that for a 
ultra wide. The screw on 20 or 21mm accessory lens is a colossal inconvenience; 
I had one on a Konica Minolta A2. What are the engineers thinking?7) Still no 
100% optical view finder. I HATE holding the camera at arms length to aim it: 
think camera shake and discrete image-making. Perhaps I speak for my colleagues 
when I contend we would prefer a true, 100% optical view finder. The ancient 
Nikon SP range finder film camera had one, the Leica has one. To fix these 
objections, the camera might have to be larger, but it would be a real 
photography tool.</p>

<p>OK, it doesn't have the articulating screen and the second command dial as 
P7100 but for a lot less, I can live with it. Firmware 1.2 fixes pretty much 
all the software issues that plagued this much maligned but capable camera. It 
should really help Nikon and the vendors move the remaining stock of this 
&quot;unloved&quot; camera. For me, although I am a Nikon guy, I held out to 
the bitter end and at one point even considered purchasing a G12, until the 
price drop and the firmware update. I am extremely happy with this purchase and 
the performance improvement.</p>

<p>I normally shoot a D300 but needed a small camera to put in my pocket. Very 
happy with the P7000. No real learning curve going from a Nikon DSLR to this. 
The LCD is great, very sharp.</p>

<p>Lots to learn, but that means there are many options available. I'm not 
entirely happy with the zoom, I thought it was a little longer range, but the 
indoor photos are GREAT and so is the close up feature.<br>
<br>
There are so 
many different options for &quot;scenes&quot;... night, portrait, sports, 
beach, indoor- just to name a few.. the list is LONG and each one seems to help!
<br><br>
Battery life, so far is good. (Battery and charger are INCLUDED which 
is a PLUS!)... and buying a spare battery always allows you to have power on 
hand!</p>

<p>I bought this camera so I wouldn't have to take my DSLR on vacation with 
me. It's a great size to just slip into your bag - although it is a tad large 
for your pocket. It is slow to turn on and zoom which is my main gripe.</p>

<p>Basically feels great in the hands, pics are true to color, a few too many 
buttons on the back for my taste, I do not have large hands but find I am 
conscious of touching them when using the camera, LOVE the auto exposure lock 
button, have always wanted the ability to lock in a different exposure and then 
lock in the focus (like a &quot;semi-auto&quot; mode), all in all I expect this 
to be my main camera for many years to come.</p>

<p>I was at first confounded by the menus but I'm growing acustom to them and 
I am getting to like them. They are no intuitive to me. The camera does lag a 
bit when switching from preview to shooting mode. I was quite impressed with 
the flash, small size but lots of power. Battery consumption is very favorable 
and the picture quality under a variety of conditions I do like. If you are a 
Nikon shooter like me this camera will take some of your existing flash 
accessories including the SU800. I'm so pleased I purchased another with the 
intent to convert to IR.</p>

<p>I went on a motorcycle trip for 18 days and 6000 miles with the coolpix 
wrapped around my neck to take photos of the magnificant views outwest. I 
really loved the results exspecially the landscape setting since most of my 
photos were taken while moving around 30-50mph they turned out better then I 
could have imagined. I took my D200 also and used it for when we stopped for my 
professional photos. Honestly some I took with both and I thought the coolpix 
did just as well some times. My only complaint was the shutter stuck half way 
thru my trip and I had to manuelly help it open, although when I came home 
B&amp;H sent me a brand new camera and took care of the problem quickly. I will 
see how this one does and I'm hoping it works well because I do like the 
results of the images.</p>

<p>I have two Nikon DSLRs but they are bulky and sometimes not welcome at 
concerts. The P7000 can be carried in a pocket for convenience. I had an older 
CoolPix but it was only 3mp, so the time for upgrade was evident. Four stars 
for a point and shoot you can't go wrong with.</p>

<p>I use this camera to shoot some of the pictures for my website. I also have 
a Nikon D40x that I have been using for quite some time and was wanting a 
backup camera to carry in my bag. Along came the P7000. It does everything that 
my main camera does, plus a whole lot more.<br>
<br>
I really like the ease of 
changing the shutter speed and aperture over my D40X. I haven't been able to 
find anything that I don't like about it, although the viewfinder could be a 
bit larger, more similar to what is on the D40x.<br>
<br>
It also provides us 
with an extra video camera for the footage we are planning to release on the 
website soon.</p>

<p>I love this little camera! My day job as a commercial pilot takes me all 
over and having an almost SLR-like camera in a small package is huge to me. 
Packing this along instead of my SLRs is cake. The image quality, build, and 
abilities of the camera are wonderful.<br>
<br>
From full manual control to a 
worthy zoom it is basically everything I wanted in a compact. My previous 
'travel' camera was the Sigma DP1 (phenomenal sensor/image quality), which is 
great in its own right but the P7000 goes a step further in overall usefulness. 
I wanted something with a faster start up time, good zoom and better 
auto-focusing for playing outside. The P7000 has all this and then some. In 
fact, my last trip to the Philippines I brought this along instead of one my 
SLRs. I wasn't disappointed!<br>
<br>
Only complaint I can muster is the 
viewfinder, but the LCD does a good job so it was a matter of adjustment 
really. While definitely not a replacement for my SLRs, it is a great little 
camera to have along at all times. Highly recommended!</p>

<p>Comments about <em>Nikon CoolPix P7000 Digital Camera</em>:</p> 
<p>I wanted a full featured point and shoot camera type of camera with a 
viewfinder, as I shoot a lot of scenery and wildlife while backpacking in the 
mountains. DSLR's are too bulky to haul around and LCD screens tend to wash out 
in bright light. This camera is the best of both worlds, compact, has superior 
zoom capabilities, along with HD video.</p>
