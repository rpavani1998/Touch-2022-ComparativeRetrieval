<p> The Canon EOS Rebel XSi (EOS 450D) is Canon's latest DSLR and the most 
full featured entry level DSLR in their Digital Rebel line of cameras. It 
builds on the Digital Rebel XTi but adds a new sensor (12MP vs. 10MP), a larger 
LCD screen (3&quot; vs. 2.5&quot;), Live View, Spot Metering, ISO display in 
the viewfinder, Highlight Tone priority, High ISO noise reduction and a number 
of other software features, which are also found on the Canon EOS 40D.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Externally, the Rebel XSi and XTi are very similar in size and shape and 
share a similar control layout. Due to the larger LCD screen of the XSi, a 
number of the control buttons have been relocated, but the same functionality 
is retained. To allow the center button of the rear 4-way controller to now 
activate the Live View mode, a separate ISO button has been added next to the 
main control dial.</p>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p> For the first time on any EOS DSLR, the Digital Rebel XSi uses only an 
SD(HC) memory card for image storage. All previous Digital Rebels, as well as 
the EOS 5D/10D/20D/30D/40D have used Compact Flash memory cards. The 1D series 
DSLRs have had the capability of using both SD and CF cards. The change isn't 
really a big deal since SD cards (and higher capacity SDHC cards) are now as 
easily available as CF cards, cost around the same in $/GB, and can be found in 
capacities of up to 16 and 32GB.</p> 
<p> Both the XTi and XSi use a pentamirror viewfinder system, but the 
viewfinder screen of the XSi is slightly larger and also, to my eye, appears to 
be slightly brighter. The difference in size isn't huge, but every little bit 
helps. The viewfinder screen of the XSi has a center circle which makes the 
area of the spot meter. Both cameras use the same diamond shape of 9 focus 
zones.</p>

<h2>Operating Speed</h2> 
<p>The Digital Rebel XSi is very responsive in terms of operational speed. The 
LCD display appears less than a second after the camera is powered up, but you 
can take a photo only 250ms (1/4s) after the power switch is moved to 
&quot;on&quot; before the LCD screen starts displaying data.</p> 
<p>In continuous capture mode, the Rebel XSi is capable of 3.5 frames per sec 
(fps) for about 55 frames before the buffer fills and the rate drops a little. 
The buffer is significantly smaller when capturing RAW, and in that case the 
3.5 fps drops to around 0.7 fps after only 6 frames. In RAW+JPEG mode, the 
buffer only holds 4 captures.</p> 
<p>These numbers make the XSi faster than the XTi (3 fps) with a larger JPEG 
buffer (55 frames vs. 30 frames). However, the RAW file buffer is somewhat 
smaller (6 frames vs. 10 frames), presumably at least in part due to the larger 
file size dictated by the higher pixel count. The EOS 40D is good for 6.5 fps 
for around 125 JPEGs or around 18 RAW images.</p> 
<h2>Controls</h2> 
<p> The Rebel XSi uses a control layout, which should be fairly familiar to 
most users. The 3&quot; rear LCD screen is used to display operating parameters 
and the various software menus, as well as to review images. As with previous 
Digital Rebels, there is no top mounted LCD screen. Menu navigation is done via 
the 4-way buttons (allowing navigation up, down, left and right through the 
menus). The center &quot;set&quot; button is also used to enable Live View 
modes. In Live View, focusing is enabled by pressing the &quot;*&quot; button. 
When not being used for navigation, the 4-way buttons are used to select 
capturing mode, metering mode, AF mode, and picture style.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> The menu structure is similar to that of the Digital Rebel XTi and the EOS 
40D. Like the 40D there's a customizable menu screen on which you can place the 
functions you use most so that you can access them rapidly. I put Image Quality 
Selection, Memory Card Format, High ISO Noise Reduction, Highlight Tone 
Priority, Mirror Lockup, and Custom WB there.</p> 
<p> For a complete and detailed description of all the camera controls and 
options, you can download a PDF copy of the Rebel XSi user manual.</p> 
<h2>Auto Focus</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The EOS Rebel XSi has a 9-point wide area AF sensor with the points set in 
a diamond pattern. The focus point can be manually selected, or the camera can 
decide which AF point(s) to use. There are 4 focus modes: One-Shot AF, AI Focus 
AF, AI Servo AF, and Manual. The central AF point is an improved cross type 
sensor with high precision for lenses with an aperture of f/2.8 or faster.</p> 
<p> In Live view there are two focus modes. One is the same as that used on 
the EOS 40D, where the reflex mirror flips down briefly and the normal AF 
sensors are used to achieve focus. This is termed &quot;quick mode.&quot; The 
second focus mode (only available on the XSi) is &quot;live mode&quot; and uses 
a contrast-based AF system. The live image is used and focus is determined by 
looking for maximum contrast. It has the advantage that the LiveView is not 
interrupted, but it's significantly slower (focus may take a few seconds) and 
it may not be quite as accurate in all situations as quick mode.</p> 
<p> Overall, I found that most of the time the AF performance of the XSi and 
XTi were quite similar. However, there were some situations in very low light 
where the XSi could get an autofocus lock, while with the same lens under the 
same lighting, the XTi failed. This is consistent with a statement found in the 
press release for the XSi in which Canon states, &quot;The EOS Rebel XSi 
Digital SLR utilizes a precise nine-point Autofocus (AF) system featuring a 
newly developed AF sensor that improves the camera's subject detection 
capabilities compared to earlier models.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Metering and Exposure</h2>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p>The XSi adds Spot metering to the Evaluative, Partial and Centerweighted 
patterns of the XTi. The spot metering area is marked by a circle on the 
viewfinder screen.</p> 
<p> Digital Rebel XSi metering: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>35-zone TTL full-aperture metering </li> 
<li>Evaluative metering (linkable to any AF point) </li> 
<li>Partial metering (approx. 9% of viewfinder at center) </li> 
<li>Spot metering (approx. 4% of viewfinder at center) </li> 
<li>Center-weighted average metering </li> 
<li>Range EV 1-20 (at 73&deg;F/23&deg;C with EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens, ISO 100) 
</li> </ul> 
<p> The Rebel XSi has the same Highlight Tone Priority feature as the EOS 40D. 
This appears to be a hardware function, which adjusts the tone curve in order 
to prevent blowing out highlights in a scene that would normally exceed the 
dynamic range of the sensor. Exactly how Canon does this, they don't say, but 
it is more than just a software function. It affects both RAW and JPEG files. 
It's not a miracle cure for blown highlights, but it does give you about an 
extra stop of latitude at the expense of potentially more shadow noise. With 
Highlight Tone Priority enabled, the ISO range is restricted to 200-1600.</p> 
<p> The XSi uses a 14-bit A/D converter, which could in theory give better 
tonal gradation, though in practice it's very difficult to see the difference 
from 12-bit images (such as those from the XTi).</p> 
<h2>White Balance</h2>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p> The XSi has the usual set of white balance modes: Auto, Daylight, Shade, 
Cloudy, Tungsten, White Fluorescent Light, Flash and Custom. It doesn't allow 
color temperature to be set as the EOS 40D does. In typical Canon fashion, Auto 
white balance doesn't do great under tungsten lighting, giving a distinctly 
yellow image. In tungsten mode the color balance under domestic tungsten 
lighting is closer to neutral, but still noticeably warm. If you want the most 
neutral color rendition under tungsten lighting, the custom WB mode is best. In 
this mode you first shoot an image of a white or gray card under the lighting 
conditions you will be using. The camera can them use this as a reference for 
subsequent shots.</p> 
<h2>LCD Monitor</h2> 
<p> The XSi has a 3&quot; (diagonal) LCD screen vs. the 2.5&quot; screen of 
the XTi. Both have 230,000 pixels, 100% image coverage and LCD brightness 
control with 7 levels. The XSi adds the option of 4 different color schemes for 
data display - black on white, white on black, light blue on dark blue and dark 
brown on light brown.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Viewfinder</h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The viewfinder of the Digital Rebel XSi is slightly larger than that of 
the XTi, but slightly smaller than that of the EOS 40D. The differences are not 
huge and you might not even notice them unless you compared the cameras side by 
side. The XSi viewfinder also seems slightly brighter than that of the XTi, but 
again the difference is small. Both the Xsi and XTi use a pentamirror system 
rather than the more expensive and heavier (but slightly brighter) pentaprism 
system.</p> 
<p>Like the EOS 40D, the Rebel XSi displays the ISO setting in the viewfinder 
at all times, along with the usual information such as shutter speed, aperture, 
exposure compensation, flash status, AF status, buffer frames remaining (when 
that number is 9 or less), flash exposure compensation setting, high speed sync 
setting and exposure lock indication.</p> 
<p>The XTi and XSi share the same 9 AF zone markings, but the XSi viewfinder 
adds a center circle marking, which defines the area covered by the new 
spotmeter in the XSi.</p> 
<h4>XSi Viewfinder Specifications</h4> 
<li>Coverage - Vertical/Horizontal approx. 95% </li> 
<li>Magnification - Approx. 0.87x (-1m with 50mm lens at infinity) </li> 
<li>Eyepoint - Approx. 19mm (from eyepiece lens center) </li> 
<li>Dioptric Adjustment Correction -3.0 to +1.0 diopter 
<h2>Digital Sensor</h2> 
<p> The Digital Rebel XSi uses a new sensor with 12.2 MP and a maximum image 
size of 4272 x 2848 pixels. This is up by about 20% from the 10.1 MP sensors 
used in the Digital Rebel XTi and EOS 40D (3888 x 2592 pixels) and should 
theoretically enable about 10% greater linear resolution.</p> 
<p> In practice, there's not a very noticeable difference in image resolution 
as you can see from the sample images below. These are 100% crops from JPEGs 
taken using the standard default parameters for sharpness with each camera.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> The Rebel XSi may have a slight resolution edge, but remember these crops 
represent looking at sections of a very large image, probably something around 
24&quot; x 36&quot; on a typical monitor screen. Despite the fact that both the 
EOS 40D and Digital Rebel XTi have the same pixel count, the EOS 40D image 
looks a little sharper. In all three cases, resolution may be increased 
slightly when capturing in RAW mode and making the optimal conversion to JPEGs.
</p> 
<p> The Digital Rebel XSi has &quot;anti-dust&quot; features built into the 
sensor, which includes an anti-static coating and an ultrasonic shaker to 
dislodge dust particles. There's also a software mapping function, which can be 
used to minimize the visibility of dust particles if for some reason you can't 
clean the sensor or you want to be absolutely sure of minimizing the effects of 
dust.</p> 
<h2>ISO Settings and Image Noise</h2>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p> Both the Rebel XSi and XTi have an ISO range of 100 to 1600 in full stop 
steps (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600). The EOS 40D has a range of from 100 to 3200, 
with the 100-1600 range covered in 1/3 stop steps (100, 120, 160, 200 etc.). An 
Auto ISO mode is available on the XSi and EOS 40D, but it's limited in its 
range. In most exposure modes the range is 100-800, but in manual exposure mode 
ISO is set to 400 in auto mode. In the basic zone modes (everything except P, 
Av, Tv, M and A-Dep), ISO is always set to auto mode and cannot be manually 
selected.</p> 
<p> In the set of test images below the three cameras are compared. Again all 
three cameras were set to their default settings and no additional noise 
reduction functions were enabled. These are 100% crops, meaning one pixel on 
the screen maps directly to one pixel in the image. Up to ISO 400 all three 
cameras give very clean images with little or no evidence of noise. At ISO 800 
noise starts to appear, but is still well controlled. At ISO 1600 noise is much 
more visible, with the EOS 40D showing the least noise, followed by the 12MP 
Rebel XSi and with the 10MP Rebel XTi showing slightly more noise.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Since a higher pixel count in the same sized sensor usually means smaller 
pixels, and since smaller pixels usually show higher noise levels at high ISO 
settings, these observations are consistent with what you would expect. 
However, noise is still pretty well controlled, even at ISO 1600 on the XSi and 
it's low enough that small to medium sized prints made from the images would be 
quite acceptable.</p> 
<p>A feature of the EOS 40D, which has found its way onto the XSi is a high 
ISO noise reduction mode. This appears to increase the amount of chroma noise 
reduction while not greatly affecting the luminance noise. The main downside of 
enabling high ISO noise reduction is that the camera can buffer fewer images 
when capturing in continuous mode. Presumably this is due to the increased 
processing power required for the noise reduction mode leading to slower 
compression and storage of images, so the buffer fills faster.</p> 
<h2>Live View</h2>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p> For the first time in a Digital Rebel series DSLR, Canon has added Live 
View to the XSi. Live view gives you a real time image on the LCD screen, just 
like a P&amp;S digicam. To do this the reflex mirror is locked up, and in that 
position the camera can't use its normal AF sensors.</p> 
<p> The XSi has two different methods of autofocusing while using the LiveView 
mode. The first is the same as that used on the EOS 40D. Pressing the 
&quot;*&quot; button on the back of the camera drops the mirror down and 
enables normal AF operation - though the image on the LCD blanks out during 
this process. When the &quot;*&quot; button is released, the mirror flips back 
up and the LCD displays the image in real time again. Although this sounds 
complex, it happens quite fast and Canon call this the &quot;Quick&quot; AF 
mode.</p> 
<p>The XSi also offers another focus mode (not found on any other Canon DSLR 
at the moment), which they call the &quot;Live&quot; mode. In this mode the 
image is continuously displayed on the LCD and the camera uses that image to 
find focus via a contrast sensing algorithm. The drawback of this mode is that 
it can be slow (focus may take several seconds) and it may not be as sensitive 
or accurate as the normal &quot;Quick&quot; AF mode using the dedicated phase 
detection AF sensors.</p> 
<p> It's also possible to use manual focus of course, and the LCD image can be 
magnified by 5x or 10x to assist in optimizing focus.</p> 
<h2>In-Camera Editing</h2> 
<p> Though you can't actually edit the images in the camera once you have 
taken them, you can apply effects to existing images when printing directly 
from the camera. These include a &quot;Vivid&quot; mode which increases 
saturation for more vivid greens and blues, a noise reduction mode to lower 
image noise and three black and white modes (neutral, warm and cool).</p>  Bob 
Atkins<br>

<p> The Digital Rebel XSi does have an extensive set of options, which you can 
select before an image is taken and affect the resulting JPEG image. There are 
preset picture styles (Standard, Portrait, Landscape, Neutral, Faithful and 
Monochrome) - all of which can be edited and modified for sharpness, 
saturation, contrast and color, as well as monochrome color filtering 
simulation (yellow, orange, red and green). You can also create 3 custom 
picture styles based on modified existing styles and you can create entirely 
new styles with the provided Picture Styles Editor software.</p> 
<p>If you choose to capture in RAW mode, the provided DPP (Digital Photo Pro) 
software allows you to apply any picture style to any image during the RAW 
conversion process.</p> 
<h2>Flash</h2> 
<p> The XSi has a retractable pop-up flash with a Guide number of 13/43 (ISO 
100 meters/ft). At ISO 400 with an f/4 lens, the flash range is around 6.5m 
(21.5ft). The flash covers the frame seen by a 17mm (or longer) lens mounted on 
the XSi. Recycle time is approximately 3 seconds.</p> 
<p>The XSi has a standard Canon hotshoe and is compatible with all of Canon's 
EX series speedlites (the current models are theCanon Speedlite 220EX Flash, (
compare prices) (review), Canon Speedlite 430EX II Flash, (compare prices) (
review) and Canon Speedlite 580EX II Flash, (compare prices) (review)). There's 
no PC connector for external studio flash, though of course hotshoe to PC 
adapters are available. Max sync voltage is 250v and the max sync speed is 
1/200s.</p> 
<h2>Memory Cards</h2>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p> The Digital Rebel XSi uses SD/SDHC memory cards. This is in contrast to 
all previous Digital Rebels and the EOS 5D/20D/30D/40D models, which use 
Compact Flash (CF) cards. These days, there's little difference between SD and 
CF cards in terms of price, capacity and availability. The fastest CF cards are 
still faster than the fastest SD cards, but in a Digital Rebel or even an EOS 
40D, the camera can't write fast enough to make use of the extra speed of the 
fastest cards.</p> 
<p> The only real issue related to SD/SDHC and CF cards is compatibility with 
what you already own. Today, most digital P&amp;S cameras use SD cards, so if 
you carry a P&amp;S digicam and an XSi you'll only need to carry one type of 
card.</p> 
<h2>Batteries</h2> 
<p>The XSi uses Canon Battery Pack LP-E5, which is currently only used by the 
XSi. The XTi uses a type NB-2LH battery pack. The new LP-E5 has higher 
capacity, but a different form factor so the two types of battery are not 
interchangeable.</p> 
<p> AC power can be supplied to the XSi via AC Adapter Kit ACK-E5. An optional 
Battery Grip BG-E5 is available, which can use 6 AA batteries or two LP-E5 
batteries. It also provides a shutter button and control dial along with AE/FE 
Lock, exposure compensation and AF point selection buttons in a vertical 
orientation.</p> 
<h2>Mechanical Design</h2> 
<p> The Digital Rebel XSi is very similar in size and shape to the XTi. The 
edges and corners are slightly more rounded and the rubberized patches on the 
back and grip sections of the camera are slightly rougher and 
&quot;stickier&quot;, making the camera a little easier to hold with one hand.

<li>Digital Rebel XSi - 129 x 98 x 62 mm - 524 g (with battery)</li> 
<li>Digital Rebel XTi - 127 x 94 x 65 mm - 556 g (with battery)</li> </ul> 
<p> Like the XTi, the XSi has a high strength plastic mirror box mounted in a 
small stainless steel chassis. The outer panels of the XSi are made from 
durable plastic.</p> 
<h2>Choosing a Lens</h2>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p> The Digital Rebel XSi is available as a kit with the new Canon EF-S 
18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS, (compare prices) (review). This lens covers the same 
angle of view that a 29-88mm zoom would on a full frame camera, so it's useful 
for many types of photography including landscapes, group shots and portraits. 
The Image Stabilized (IS) system is a new low-cost version of Canon's 
traditional IS, but the performance is good and it can add up to three stops of 
stability, making handholding the lens in low light easier, despite the 
relatively slow maximum aperture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> To complement the EF-S 18-55/3.5-5.6IS Canon has a new Canon EF-S 55-250mm 
f/4.0-5.6 IS, (compare prices) (review), which is good for situations like 
sports and wildlife photography where a longer focal length is needed. It gives 
an angle of view equivalent to an 88-400mm lens on a full frame 35mm camera. 
Like the EF-S 18-55IS, the EF-S 55-250IS uses a new, lower cost IS system, but 
again it seems pretty effective adding up to three stops of stability. Zoomed 
out to 250mm, IS gives you a good chance of a sharp image while handholding the 
camera at shutter speeds as low as 1/60s.</p> 
<p> Of course, for an inexpensive fast portrait lens, you really can't beat the
Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II, (compare prices) (review). That's a lens I always 
recommend looking at.</p> 
<p>There are many other lens options from Canon, Sigma, Tamron and Tokina. For 
an overview of what's available seeThe EOS System Guide </p> 
<h2>Compared to Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Sony</h2> 
<p> The 12MP Digital Rebel XSi falls between the 10MP Canon Digital Rebel XTi, 
(compare prices) (review) and the 10MP Canon EOS 40D, (compare prices) in 
Canon's lineup. The XTi doesn't offer such features as Live View, spotmetering 
or Highlight Tone Priority. The EOS 40D offers those, plus a higher frame rate 
(6.5 fps vs 3.5 fps), a larger image buffer, support for studio flash, and a 
more rugged construction. Which DSLR to choose depends on your needs and how 
much you want to pay. All three cameras are capable of producing excellent 
image quality, so the choice should be mainly based on camera features.</p>  
Hannah Thiem<br>

<p> In the Nikon lineup the closest cameras to the Digital Rebel XSi would be 
the 10MPNikon D40x, (compare prices) (review)Nikon D40x and the 10MP Nikon D80, 
(compare prices) (review) Nikon D80. The D40x is cheaper, but has a simpler 3 
zone AF system and no provision for the use of Nikon AF-S (internal ultrasonic 
motor) lenses. The D80 is closer to the XSi in terms of features, having an 
11-zone AF system, DOF preview and an optional vertical grip (all of which the 
D40x lacks). Both the D40x and D80 have the option of an ISO 3200 setting, 
which could be a consideration for those who do a lot of low light work.</p> 
<p> The 10MP Pentax K200D, (compare prices), is the closest camera to the XSi 
in the Pentax lineup. It offers several features not found on similar Canon and 
Nikon DSLRs including sensor-shift stabilization built into the camera body. 
This means that all your lenses become stabilized and you don't need to buy 
special IS or VR lenses. The K200D is also sealed against dust and moisture to 
a greater extent than most other DSLRs of its class. It features an 11-point AF 
system and an ISO range up to 1600. It does not have a Live View capability.</p>
<p> The Sony Alpha A350, (compare prices) (review) offers a 14MP sensor, ISO 
3200 capability, an advanced Live View system, a tiltable 2.7&quot; LCD, 
sensor-shift stabilization built into the camera body and a 9-zone AF system. 
Maximum frame rate is a little slow at 2 fps, but it does pack in a lot of 
features for around the same price as the Rebel XSi.</p>

<li>14-bit A/D conversion</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>  Hannah Thiem <br>

<p>The Rebel XSi seems to be a combination of the Rebel XTi and the EOS 40D, 
with a few new features of its own thrown into the mix. It has the basic form 
of the XTi with the same shutter speed range, the same flash sync speed and the 
same ISO range. However it also has features of the EOS 40D such as Live View, 
Highlight Tone Priority, High ISO Noise reduction, Spot metering, a 14-bit A/D 
converter and viewfinder ISO display.</p> 
<p> The performance is perhaps closer to the 40D than to the XTi. Resolution 
is measurably higher, though the difference in practice is quite small. Noise 
appears to be a little higher, perhaps because of the smaller pixels.</p> 
<p> Overall the XSi is an improvement over the XTi, though more in terms of 
features than image quality, which is good in both cameras. Upgrading from the 
XTi to the XSi makes sense if you need things like spot metering, a larger LCD 
and Live View, but if you're looking for a noticeable leap in image quality, I 
don't think you'll see it. If you want a significant increase in image quality, 
you'd probably need to look at a full frame DSLR like theCanon EOS 5D, (compare 
prices) (review).</p>

<p>Chinmaya Sn , April 21, 2008; 02:08 P.M. </p> 
<p>Since XSi is part of Rebel series, nice to see some of your thoughts on 
upgrade from XT or XTi.</p> 
<p>Steve P. , April 21, 2008; 07:30 P.M. </p> 
<p>I can't wait to read the full review. I'm wondering how some of the 
40D-esque features incorporated into the XSi work, and how it compares to the 
XTi.</p> 
<p>Geoff Francis , April 21, 2008; 08:26 P.M. </p> 
<p>Good review Bob. Based on your shot above, the noise at ISO 1600 looks 
quite a bit worse than the 40D.</p> 
<p>Bob Atkins , April 21, 2008; 08:58 P.M. </p> 
<p>You have to be careful about drawing conclusions from single measurements 
of noise. I don't know if the 40D and XSi use different noise reduction 
algorithms for example. Though high ISO noise reduction was turned off, I'd bet 
there are default noise reduction algorithms in use at ISO 1600.</p> 
<p> Also sharpness settings can make a difference to how the noise looks and 
it's possible the XSi and 40D use different default sharpness settings.</p> 
<p> So while there looks to be extra noise in the XSi image, it may not be 
true to say that XSi images are inherantly noiser than 40D images under other 
conditions, or when optimized for low noise.</p> 
<p> Both give very usable images at ISO 1600. Getting to the root of the noise 
and making fair comparisions requires more work than just shooting a couple of 
images (which is all I did for this test).</p> 
<p>Helen Clement , April 21, 2008; 10:09 P.M. </p> 
<p>Looking forward to reading your full review. I have just bought the Canon 
450D and the two lenses that you mentioned. I am still &quot;finding&quot; my 
way around the camera, with the odd focusing problem, but so far very happy 
with it. This is my first DSLR up from a P&amp;S Olympus.</p> 
<p>Marcus Ian , April 22, 2008; 10:30 A.M. </p> 
<p>In your full review I'd really like to see how you feel the XSi compares to 
the XTi in actual perf. (ISO noise (worse w/ higher mp count?), 14b vs. 12b a/d 
(for whites in bright sun), read/write times, etc.) I enjoy using my XTi, but 
have a few gripes (mainly things like the viewfinder size (compared to my 
EOS3)). Overall I enjoy it.</p> 
<p>Bob Atkins , April 22, 2008; 01:35 P.M. </p> 
<p>I haven't done the test yet (I'm still working on some Sony reviews that I 
have to finish first), but I can tell you what I expect to find based on 
previous testing of the 20D vs. 40D.</p> 
<p> I'd expect the average image quality of XTi and XSi images to be pretty 
much the same for the large majority of users under the large majority of 
conditions. 10MP to 12MP is a small change and it's very hard to see the 
difference between 12 bit and 14 bit A/D. I'm sure there will be some 
circumstances and some images which will benefit slighly from the upgrade, but 
unless you're making big prints you probably won't see them.</p> 
<p> Since I don't have an XTi on hand, I won't be doing any &quot;side by 
side&quot; comparisions, though I can do comparisions of the XSi with the 40D. 
I don't expect to see any huge differences in image quality between the 40D and 
XSi either.</p> 
<p> What you can measure on a test bench under microscopic examination of 
images and what you can actually see in a print aren't the same thing.</p> 
<p> UPDATE: I may be able to do an XTi vs. XSi comparision after all. One is 
promised to arrive this week and if it does, I'll do some comparison testing.
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Peter Kaczkowski , May 11, 2008; 05:34 P.M. </p> 
<p> Thanks for the helpful first look. I have been using an XTi from work for 
about a year and am planning to buy an XSi for myself ... barring some 
unforgivable flaw (which you did not find, thankfully!). Of course, I'm looking 
forward to the extended review.</p> 
<p> One characteristic that really irks me about the XTi interface is the lack 
of ability to 'lock' the buttons on the back. I find that in P-mode I am always 
changing the ISO inadvertently. I have thought of getting a viewfinder 
extension to move my face away from the back. Can one lock the buttons on the 
back? I'm glad to hear that th ISO is displayed in the viewfinder, so at least 
I might notice the change sooner! Also, is the XSi body slightly smaller than 
the XTi's? And do you notice any difference using the DIGIC III? --- Thanks 
much.</p>

<p> On the XSi, the ISO button isn't on the back but is very handy for my 
index finger. I've had no problems at all with anything changing inadvertently.

<p>Maria Obias , May 25, 2008; 08:15 P.M. </p> 
<p>I ordered my XSI today and am looking forward to using it. Please advise 
which SD card I should get for it. I checked SanDisk's website for product 
compatibility where they list which cards are recommended for which equipment 
and they do not have the XSI in the list yet. Many thanks.</p> 
<p>george ferrell , June 03, 2008; 10:00 P.M. </p> 
<p>I have used a Rebel XT and like the new XSi model with added file size, a 
larger LCD and additional range on the flash. I think the new battery may take 
longer to charge. The addition of an ISO button near the mode dial is helpful, 
too. Overall, seems to be a good user at a budget price.</p>

<p>The XSi really rocks! I got it two weeks ago and use it for Red Carpet 
photography for Getty Images. I was using a Canon Rebel XT and this XSi makes 
my work a lot easier. The focus is faster and more accurate. My shooting ratio 
has improved. I select shots based on composition not based on if I think it is 
in focus, because most of the shots now are in focus and are very sharp. I 
can't say enough about this camera. The live view is there, but I've not had 
the time to master it. Focus is an issue with that feature. I use a 17-85mm, 
28-135mm, and a Sigma 70-200mm. Between those three, I'm all set. My site has
samples.</p> 
<p>Dave Mishalof , June 08, 2008; 04:55 P.M. </p> 
<p>Interesting review. I know that the XSI comes with the two kit lens 
mentioned, but I also understand that the XSI is able to take advantage of 
&quot;L&quot; lens (new AF system and higher sensor density) Why compare noise 
to the 40D at iso 1600 when the normal range for the XSI camera is 100-800 and 
then not use Canon's better lens. The potenial resolution with this Rebel is 
higher, so it deserves to be tested with better glass. I realize that most will 
buy the Kit lens as their &quot;first&quot; lens but why not discuss what the 
potenial is with better glass, especially if you are comparing the purchase 
alternative to the 40D. Looking forward to your complete evaluation.</p> 
<p>Carlos Eduardo Livino , June 09, 2008; 03:43 P.M. </p> 
<p>I wonder if this XSi is a worthy upgrade from a 300D (6MP Rebel). I already 
have a 17-55 f/2.8 IS lens and 6MP give great results. That's why I've been 
postponing my 300D's replacement. But the newer camera seems to have lots of 
ergonomic/useability improvements (immediate startup, large LCD etc.). Any 
thoughts?</p> 
<p>John Brissett , June 18, 2008; 11:46 P.M. </p> 
<p>I just received my XSI last week!! Works great, but I must say that I'm new 
to the SLR field. Only problem so far is finding the compatible battery grip 
E-5, I had one on order through Buydig then after a week they canceled my order 
saying they were out of stock(It was in stock when I ordered it!). I am looking 
forward to upgrading my lens though, from the EF-S 18-55 IS kit lens. I'm 
looking for more zoom capabilities! as in distance, any suggestions for someone 
on a major budget? Thank You!!</p> 
<p>Keaton Andrew , June 27, 2008; 04:33 A.M. </p> 
<p>carlos, I'd say definitely upgrade if you easily can. I used to have the 
300D and every single camera I've had since then has blown it away. I've been 
shooting with a 20D and a 5D lately, and I think that the difference between 
the 300D and this latest canon camera would make it a worthy upgrade.</p> 
<p> that's my two cents!</p> 
<p>Nielson Assa , June 29, 2008; 03:45 A.M. </p> 
<p>I just got the XSi about 2 weeks ago and just got the chance to try it in 
Estes Park lake, Colorado.<br>
<br>
 The result of this camera is very good, it 
does beats my old XTi on the easier to use. Below are some of the result that I 
had taken with my new XSi, it's about 4pm with lots of sunlights. I am using 
Rebel XSi + canon lens 55-250mm IS and my friend (on the first picture) using 
40D + canon lens 70-300mm.<br>

<p>Sounds like a good DSLR body, already invested in Nikon system I doubt I'll 
ever buy one. Too bad...<br>
 See more XSi reviews here.</p> 
<p>Carlos Eduardo Livino , July 09, 2008; 09:00 P.M. </p> 
<p>Keaton, I received my XSi on the 23rd (of June, 2008) and you're right in 
that it's worth the upgrade. I still prefer the 300D in terms of handling, and 
of course mine had the ISO 3200 option (hacked firmware) whereas the XSi only 
goes to 1600. Apart from that, it's a huge step up in every respect. And I 
don't mind having 12MP at all - now I have more room to compensate for my poor 
composition skills...</p> 
<p>Harry C , July 19, 2008; 06:44 A.M. </p> 
<p>Bob great review. How much better is the 5D in image quality and noise? Not 
interested in the other features.</p> 
<p> Edit: found the 40D V's 5D thread</p> 
<p>Srikanth Kondeti , July 19, 2008; 04:27 P.M. </p>  Nice comparisions 
<p>Really nice to have this review. I have been waiting for to read this 
review since long time though I have read the reviews from other sites like 
dpreview.com n all. This is wonderful review.</p> 
<p>John Hanlon , July 20, 2008; 08:10 A.M. </p> 
<p>Excellent review Bob, as usual! </p> 
<p> By the way I noticed a small typo: &quot;...followed by the 10MP Rebel XSi 
and with the 12MP Rebel XTi showing slightly more noise.&quot; Looks like the 
pixel counts got switched. Keep up the good work!</p> 
<p>Diane Fields , July 22, 2008; 10:41 P.M. </p> 
<p> I found the review interesting. I had never shot with an xxxD body before 
but just bought a used 400D to use (primarily) with a small fast prime as my 
small camera instead of my G9 (which is a frustrating camera for me). I tried 
the 450D in a store with the 18-55IS and really liked the button placement, 
3&quot; LCD, but in the end got better value with the XTI. If I were buying new 
and as my main camera (I shoot with a 5D) I would likely choose the XSI unless 
I owned an XTI--not sure if I would upgrade at this point.</p> 
<p> I have to say--the IQ from these little cameras with a good lens really 
surprised me and I found most of the controls easy to use, so ergonomically it 
worked pretty well for me. I was surprised how much I liked shooting with the 
smaller body also. I'll be interested in reading your complete review--and pay 
more attention to the xxxD models in the future.</p> 
<p> (just a note--not sure why the post ended up with 2 different font sizes).

<p>I am an all round photographer; I shoot weddings and commercial images for 
the money and wildlife for fun. I love the 1.6 crop factor for wild life as it 
works well with telephoto lenses and I do not like the 1.3 crop factor of the 
1D Mk3 for this reason, sure I can crop the image of the full frame and 1.3 
cameras, but at the expense of pixel density; this is why I am looking to 
upgrade my camera bodies (30D &amp; XTi) with the 40D &amp; XSI. At present I 
use the XTi as a back up on wedding assignments, at this point I must point out 
that the focus on the XTi in low light conditions is VERY POOR; it will not 
focus with the Canon 85mm f/1.8 lens in low light conditions. I understand that 
the new XSi has revised focusing; I hope this has corrected the lousy focusing 
that the XTi has.</p> 
<p> Can anyone advise me on the above&hellip;. Thanks </p> 
<p>Masum Haider , August 18, 2008; 05:56 P.M. </p> 
<p>hi bob, all my life i have been using canon cameras. the one i have now is 
canon AE-1 bought in 1986 with a 50mm 1:1.4 lens and still gives nice pictures. 
i am thinking of buying a digital SLR and i was actually going thru your 
reviews about Rebel xsi, amazed to see that u have so much knowledge about 
cameras. I am still kind of undecided because i almost ended up buying canon 
40d but the price is too high, but when the new xsi came out i think that will 
be a better choice.....I shoot wedding pictures, portrait, sometimes wild life, 
nature and sports .. what kind of lense i should be using.please advise me with 
your expertise . thanks masum , staten island ny..</p> 
<p>Chris Young , September 12, 2008; 05:42 P.M. </p> 
<p>Just got the 450d a couple of weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I was 
pretty close to purchasing the 40d - but I didn't feel that 2x the price of a 
450d was reasonable. The 450d is a great body for beginners and the 
&quot;kit&quot; lens isn't the worst thing either.</p> 
<p> Anyone from serious photographer's looking for a spare body to the 
beginner looking for their first camera, the 450d is a perfect fit.</p>

thinking of upgrading to the new rebel for the faster AF alone. Any comments 
welcome. Thnx</p>

One of my first test 
shots with the camera 
<p></p> 
<p>I bought the 450D (XSi) and have now used it for a few thousand shots, the 
only quirk I am unhappy about is the lack of PC connector, so I had to buy a 
Nikon hotshoe to PC adapter to get it up and running which was a bit of a 
downer.</p> 
<p> Since it was impossible to get hold of the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 in the country 
where I live I bought the Canon EF-S 17 - 55 f/2.8 IS lens with the camera, and 
from every shot I have done so far with it I have to say it gives images of an 
unreal sharpness and quality. The colors are beautifully presented and the 
autofocus dead fast, I am extremely pleased with the setup so far and are very 
impressed over the camera and lens. I do agree a bit that a prime standard is 
the way to start out but from shooting unreal amount of film and 50 prime I 
find the standard primes to be rather boring, and using the 17 - 55 gives me 
most daily shots available on the camera, street, school play and no-flash poor 
lighting (thanks to the IS) travel, beautiful portraits at 55/2.8, school 
sports and all general shooting. I also tried some older lenses I own (primes) 
which again is really great with the camera, again sharp crisp very nicely 
colored shots. Way to go Canon...</p>

<p>The XSI is usefull at times since it is small and light but that kit lens 
(18-55) has such low resolution it is unuseable (except for, perhaps, a childs 
birthday party). Other optics will yield a much superior image showing the 
processor is decent. Ron</p>

<p>I just bought Canon Lens EFS 18-200mm IS and with my XSi, the picture taken 
with both is outstanding.<br>

<p>The body is very lightweight to carry but I think it is not dust and 
raindrop proff! A question: Is there any lens converter available by which I 
can use my all AE1 lenses with this EOS 450D Xsi?</p>

<p>I didn't see this so I am asking--- are the lenses for the XTI compatible 
with the XSI? I want to upgrade but I have a lot invested in lenses for my XTI 
and don't want to start over in buying lenses again.</p>

<p>The lenses you use on XTi should fit on XSi too, all EF &amp; EF-s lenses 
fit on that XSi camera. Check this page :

<p>I love my 450D. The only thing I need help on (as I'm fairly new to the 
photography business) is what is the best lenses to purchase for shooting 
weddings? I know I will need a wide angle and a zoom or maybe a wide-to-tele 
zoom? Any advice is greatly appreciated.</p> <br>
