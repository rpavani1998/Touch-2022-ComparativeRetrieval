<h1> Goodbye Nikon? </h1>  Last updated January 09, 2010 - Send Feedback <br>
 
Choices<br>

<h1>Introduction</h1> 
<p>February 11 , 2007, updated March 3, may 3, May 8, May 30</p> 
<p>Jan 10, 2010 &acirc;&#128;&#148; this page can now be termed 
&ldquo;historical&rdquo;. Nikon has far and away the best professional DSLRs 
(D3x, D3s) as of January 2010, see my reviews inDAP. DSLR leadership might well 
change in 2010, but Nikon&rsquo;s offerings are top of the heap as I write 
this, with Canon clearly lagging.</p> 
<p><strong>For some time now, I&rsquo;ve been considering a switch to Canon 
from Nikon</strong>. Yes, really.</p> 
<p>Readers of my <em>D2x vs EOS</em> review know that Nikon has been my 
preferred shooting platform for some time&mdash;for numerous objective reasons, 
as well as some subjective ones. But Nikon is failing to innovate at 
Canon&rsquo; rapid pace, or at least in the ways<em>I want them to innovate</em>
.</p> 
<p>With the late-February announcement of the new Canon EOS 1D Mark III , the 
comparison seems very unfavorable for Nikon&rsquo;s D2x and even worse for the 
D2H.  In short, Canon&rsquo;s EOS 1D Mark III is a superbly-built sports 
camera, offering an incredible ten (10) frames per second, and a gaggle of 
ground-breaking features never before available in a professional-caliber 
camera, including &ldquo;live view&rdquo;, a self-cleaning sensor, true 14-bit 
color, a 3&quot; LCD, silent mode, ISO 6400, and a variety of other 
improvements. On paper the EOS 1D Mark III looks like an incredible camera, and 
I have one on order.</p> 
<h3>Two systems</h3> 
<p>Owning both Canon and Nikon systems, it&rsquo;s not like I can&rsquo;t 
shoot both&mdash;except that carrying two systems gets tedious and heavy: two 
chargers, two extra batteries, two lens systems and at least two bodies. To 
some extent, there is overlap; non-&ldquo;G&rdquo; Nikon lenses can be used on 
EOS bodies using anadapter. But that means manual stop-down and manual focus. 
So &ldquo;switching&rdquo; to Canon really just means divesting myself of Nikon 
equipment I&rsquo;m unlikely to use, while keeping items that would prove 
useful should Nikon&rsquo;s offerings become more appealing&mdash;a camera is a 
tool and I need not sell all my tools,<em>some of which are better for one job 
or another</em>. </p> 
<h3>Disappointing 5D</h3> 
<p>I prize my converted Canon EOS 5D-IR for infrared use. But the 5D color 
rendering (stock camera) can be awful; I&rsquo;m not talking about the usual 
Canon color &ldquo;look&rdquo; which Nikon shooters are apt to dislike, but 
rather the tendency of the 5D to produce difficult-to-correct color shifts (see
<em>D2x vs EOS</em>), or to destroy certain colors, a fact I re-experienced 
with pale green reindeer lichen inNorway last fall (examples discarded out of 
disgust&mdash;sorry).<em>Multiple</em> disappointing color experiences with the 
5D have caused me to conclude that while infrequent, the #1 weakness of the 5D 
is its color rendering. (The EOS 1Ds Mark II has no such problems). A February 
2007 experience with an outdoor portrait reminded me how awful the results can 
be, but the conditions which cause it elude me.</p> 
<p><strong>So why did I buy a 2nd 5D</strong>? Simple&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t 
feel like lugging my 5D-IR for shooting infrared<em>and</em> a Nikon D200 kit 
for shooting color on my trips to Death Valley National Park [article] and Big 
Bend. Plus a $600 rebate ($300 X 2 Canondouble rebate when purchased with 
another item). (I crossed my fingers that my experience would be better on the 
rebate than that of others, butno luck). When the 1D mark III becomes 
available, I&rsquo;ll switch to the combination of 1D mark III + 5D-IR, and 
sell the unmodified color EOS 5D. Contact me in late June 2007 if interested in 
the unmodified Canon 5D.</p> 
<h3>The low end</h3> 
<p>To be clear, Nikon&rsquo;s offerings at the low and medium end are 
excellent (if you can call cameras from $500 to $1600 &ldquo;low end&rdquo;). 
The Nikon D40, D40x, D50, D80 are excellent cameras, ergonomically superior in 
multiple ways to the equivalent Canon offerings. The Nikon D200 doesn&rsquo;t 
just compare favorably to the Canon 5D, it surpasses it in build quality, 
having a sealed body, larger and easier to use buttons and other positive 
characteristics (see<em>D2x vs EOS</em> and <em>D200 vs D2x</em>). The 5D 
offers a larger viewfinder and higher resolution which for many users is the 
deciding factor. But at twice the price (originally $3300 vs $1600) and now 
still 70% more, the D200 is clearly a<em>far</em> better value.</p> 
<p>In short, Nikon is extremely competitive in the sub-$2000 range, and there 
is currently no rational reason for a photographer looking at that class of 
camera to be disappointed in any way with Nikon. But at the high end, Nikon is 
looking weak; the remainder of this article delves explores that assertion.</p> 
<h1>Resolution</h1> 
<p>The 16.7-megapixel Canon EOS 1Ds Mark II beats the Nikon D2x&mdash;not by a 
lot, but it&rsquo;s never<em>less</em> sharp. The 12.8-megapixel Canon EOS 5D 
beats the NikonD200 (though not the D2x) &mdash;with higher contrast too. </p> 
<p>The newly-announced Canon EOS 1D Mark III offers &ldquo;only&rdquo; 10.1 
megapixels, but that pixel count is more than adequate (and indeed preferable) 
for many uses, and it is pixel<em>quality</em> that matters considerably. Canon 
claims true 14-bit color depth and unprecedented low noise. While absolute 
resolution is always a big plus, a fine print requires high quality pixels, not 
just high resolution. One can also hope for improved color rendering with the 
1D Mark III&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be assessing that carefully.</p> 
<p><strong>The game has changed for resolution</strong>. It&rsquo;s no longer 
so much about absolute pixel count, but about what resolution can be achieved 
with the<em>entire system</em>. The combination of sensor resolution/photosite 
size and optical performance is what counts. All professional digital cameras 
shipped today having 8 megapixels or more often out-resolve many lenses, 
especially at wider apertures or at the corners/edges. A camera manufacturer 
that doesn&rsquo;taggressively improve the optical performance of its lens line 
has little to offer with a higher resolution camera body.</p> 
<h1>Focus errors</h1> 
<p>Focus Accuracy  problems with the Nikon D2x have cost me not just photos 
but considerable time re-shooting. The D200 seems better, but I&rsquo;ve 
concluded that Canon focus is simply more accurate (note: I haven&rsquo;t<em>
proven</em> this with objective testing, so it&rsquo;s only my working theory).
</p> 
<p>See <em>Focus Accuracy</em> and <em>Autofocus Accuracy&mdash;Canon EOS 1Ds 
Mark II / 85mm/f1.2L II USM</em>. </p> 
<p>The newly-announced Canon EOS 1D Mark III promises outstanding focus speed 
and accuracy. With its &ldquo;live view&rdquo; feature, achieving critical 
focus for static subjects offers an unprecedented ability to squeeze every bit 
of resolution out of the system, especially at wide apertures.</p> 
<h1>Nikon lenses</h1> 
<p>Nikon has not produced any fast &ldquo;prime&rdquo; (non-zoom) lens designs 
for many years. Nikon&rsquo;s prime-lens designs are dated, not using ED glass 
and aspherics adequately or at all, and optically mediocre for today&rsquo;s 
digital cameras. To add insult to injury, the fast primes are<strong>manual 
focus</strong> (58mm f/1.2 NOCT-Nikkor, 50mm f/1.2 AIS, 35mm f/1.4 AIS, 28 f/2 
AIS,24 f/2 AIS)&mdash;and some are not even available new anymore, or very hard 
to obtain.</p> 
<p>The only relatively new Nikon non-telephoto prime that I&rsquo;m aware of 
is the85mm f/2.8D PC-Micro-Nikkor (a superb lens which I regularly use on my 
EOS 5D with anadapter). My Nikon 50mm f/1.4D is excellent optically, but 
plastic build and not even AF-S. The50 f/1.8D is mediocre optically (multiple 
samples tested). All of the<em>autofocus</em> Nikon wide angle primes are 
f/2.8, except for the mediocre35mm f/2D. Who wants an f/2.8 prime lens when the 
17-55 f/2.8 DX is optically superior to them all?! </p> 
<p>To its credit, the all-new Nikon 200mm f/2 and 200-400mm f/4 are both 
outstanding. But I hardly ever shoot them. The17-55 f/2.8 DX and 28-70 f/2.8 
AF-S are both outstanding, but they are bulky and heavy and only f/2.8. The 
12-24 f/4 DX is a decent lens, but after 4 samples with optical problems, and 
with a slow f/4 aperture, it sits in my drawer.</p> 
<p>Nikon seems to be concentrating its optical design resources an an endless 
parade of consumer-grade &ldquo;DX&rdquo; optics, with four (4)<em>slow</em> 
zooms starting at 18mm alone! The optics might be quite good, but the build 
quality is disappointing.</p> 
<h1>Canon lenses</h1> 
<p>By comparison, <strong>Canon</strong> has produced an improved 85mm f/1.2L 
II, and an all-new 50mm f/1.2L; these two are <em>uniquely &ldquo;fast&rdquo; 
and optically stellar</em>. The Canon 35mm f/1.4L is excellent (excluding 
corners), and very nicely built too, with autofocus. I&rsquo;ll be surprised if 
Canon doesn&rsquo;t offer an all-new fast 24mm or 28mm lens soon.</p> 
<p>Canon&rsquo;s 135mm f/2L is optically outstanding, and it autofocuses 
accurately and instantly, quite unlike Nikon&rsquo;s dated and clunky135mm f/2 
DC, which has specially-bred chipmunks living inside to turn the focusing 
mechanism.</p> 
<p>Canon offers an image stabilized 24-105L. Nikon offers only consumer-grade 
stabilized lenses in that range. Canon offers four (4) professional-quality 
(&ldquo;L&rdquo;) 70-200 zooms&mdash;a key focal-length range.</p> 
<p><em>Canon does have some holes in its lens lineup</em>; the stellar 200mm 
f/1.8L should be resurrected, the24mm f/1.4L is marginal, and a 28mm f/1.4 is 
needed. The35mm f/1.4L is outperformed by zooms in the corners, though 
otherwise excellent. The24mm f/3.5L TS and 45mm f/2.8 TS need improvement (and 
flare badly in infrared). The100-400 f/3.5-5.6L is an annoying push/pull design 
with good but not great optical performance&mdash;clearly inferior to 
Nikon&rsquo;s200-400 f/4 VR, though likely as good as the awkward Nikon 80-400 
VR. </p> 
<p>Canon seems to be fully aware that many photographers desire modern optical 
designs in fast prime lenses, with first-rate build quality. A $1599, the50mm 
f/1.2L will never be a hot seller, and perhaps not even profitable, so Canon 
deserves kudos for spending the R&amp;D money and building such a unique lens.
<em>Such efforts demonstrate a serious commitment to quality and innovation</em>
. No bean-counter-run company would ever produce a 50mm f/1.2L.</p> 
<h1>Full-frame</h1> 
<p>Perhaps Nikon will announce a full-frame solution soon. But I&rsquo;m tired 
of waiting&mdash;if it&rsquo;s this month at Photokina, that won&rsquo;t be too 
late, but beyond that Nikon gets punted to my shit-list.</p> 
<p>Full-frame isn&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be, but Nikon has 
<strong>nowhere to go from the D2x resolution</strong> which is already far too 
demanding of optical quality. The fact is that the 5.5-micron pixels of the D2x 
are<em>already too small</em>, and thus too demanding of optical quality. 
Images suffer from low micro-contrast as a result, also&mdash;just compare a 
D2x image to an EOS 5D image.</p> 
<p>The D2x uses a measly 43% of the area of a full-frame sensor; a full-frame 
camera with D2x resolution would be around 28 megapixels. Electronics can only 
do so much to reduce noise, and optical laws favor full-frame as modern optical 
designs come into play (eg Canon) with improved corner performance.</p> 
<p>The D200 viewfinder offers an excellent viewfinder for a &ldquo;DX&rdquo; 
camera, but I&rsquo;ve come around to the view of many&mdash;I<em>like</em> the 
full-frame view of the Canon EOS models (for most subjects at least). Nikon 
ought to include the optional magnifying eyepieces<em>free</em> with the D200 (
DK-21M) and D2x (DK-17M).</p> 
<h1>Software</h1> 
<p>I still use Nikon <em>Capture</em> 4.4, which Nikon has not offered as a 
Universal Binary. I&rsquo;ve started exploringNikon <em>Capture NX</em>, which 
is now a Universal Binary for Apple Intel-based Macs. So far, it looks very 
promising.</p> 
<p>Canon&rsquo;s <em>Digital Photo Professional</em> has been a Universal 
Binary for months now, and it offers PowerMac G5 Quad performance on a MacBook 
Pro (now a MacBook Pro Core 2 Duo).</p> 
<p>Nikon charges $125 for <em>Capture NX</em> (about $125 street price). 
Canon&rsquo;s<em>Digital Photo Professional</em> is free. Why should one have 
to pay a premium to use RAW? Another $125 is no big deal if you&rsquo;ve bought 
a D2x, but if you&rsquo;ve gone with the $500 D40, then another $125 is a very 
stiff premium indeed.</p> 
<h1>Conclusions</h1> 
<p>Does Nikon even read this stuff?! Probably not. Sadly, I&rsquo;m not alone, 
based on the feedback I&rsquo;ve gotten since I first posted this article in 
February 2007. Nikon is at great risk of becoming a has-been in the 
professional market, a sad development, and one that is equally bad for Canon 
users; Canon needs a wolf nipping at its heels, as does Nikon.</p> 
<p>All the good things with Nikon remain true (which I cover in great detail in
<em>D2x vs EOS</em>). But Nikon seems to be on a consumer-driven mission, 
whereas Canon is innovating with the apparent aim to dominate the professional 
market. Pushing the envelope of both resolution and features, along with 
outstanding new optics, Canon is the new horse I&rsquo;ll be riding with the 
arrival of my on-orderCanon EOS 1D Mark III, while looking forward to a 
22-megapixel (rumored) Canon EOS 1Ds Mark III.</p>  Previous page: Eliminating
