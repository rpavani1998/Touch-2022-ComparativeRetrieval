<p>Nikon D5100 Digital SLR Hands On Preview - ePHOTOzine was at the launch 
event of the Nikon D5100 and have a hands on look at the new DSLR</p>  Posted:

<br>
<br>
 The Nikon D5100 is the latest digital SLR from Nikon and 
significantly updates and improves upon the D5000, including improved swivel 
screen, new effects, and full HD video mode. We had a hands on look at the 
camera and can give you our impressions of the new camera.<br>
<br>
 The D3100 
with Full HD has been a number one seller in the DSLR market in the UK for the 
last 2 months, with the D5000 regularly sitting in 2nd place. With the new 
Nikon D5100, Nikon hope to place the new camera in the number one spot 
overtaking the D3100, where it can sit in 2nd place.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Nikon's market share continues to grow at the expense of Canon and others in 
the UK market, with Nikon the number one DSLR seller in March. With the key 
features of the new Nikon D5100 it will be interesting to see if this trend 
continues. We spoke to Simon Iddon, the UK product manager for Nikon's DX 
range, from the D3100 to the D300s, about the new Nikon D5100.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
When held vertically, the screen rotates automatically.<br>
<br>
 Simon 
highlighted three key features that make the D5100 stand out: the new 
horizontal opening 3 inch screen is designed as the best approach for use with 
a tripod or video work. The camera is ideally suited for creativity using the 
creative effects, HDR and other modes, including the Full HD video. The D5100 
has the strong Nikon image quality as featured in theNikon D7000, thanks to the 
camera using the same 16.2 megapixel CMOS sensor&nbsp;- readour review to find 
out how the image quality performs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Nikon D5100&nbsp;Features</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>16.2 mp sensor, APS-C, DX series, same sensor as the D7000</li> 
<li>Full HD video 1920x1080/30/25/24fps - upto 20 minutes per video</li> 
<li>EXPEED 2 image processing</li> 
<li>3inch screen, 921k-dot (VGA resolution), horizontal vari-angle</li> 
<li>Dust / airflow control sensor cleaning system</li> 
<li>7 creative effects, available in photo and video mode:&nbsp;Colour Sketch, 
Selective Colour, Miniature effect, Night Portrait, Silhouette, High Key, Low 
Key</li> 
<li>Picture control system:&nbsp;Standard, Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, 
Portrait, Landscape</li> 
<li>Improved live view function, dedicated auto return lever</li> 
<li>Faster AF in live view, several AF modes, face priority, subject tracking, 
scene auto</li> 
<li>ISO100-3200, 6400, Hi.1 12800, Hi. 2 25600</li> 
<li>HDMI CEC connection allows control of the camera with a remote</li> </ul> 
<br> <br>
 &nbsp; 
<h3>Effects in detail&nbsp;</h3> The D5100 introduces seven new creative 
effects, as well as a new HDR mode. These are JPEG only, and it does not record 
a RAW file at the same time as the effects modes. Here are some of the examples 
shown at the press event.<br>
<br>
<br>
Colour sketch HDR Miniature <br>
<br>

Night vision Selective Colour Silhouette <br>
<br>
 &nbsp;  Effects:&nbsp;Low 
key,&nbsp;High key,&nbsp;Miniature, Selective colour, Colour 
sketch,&nbsp;Silhouette,&nbsp;Night vision, and new&nbsp;HDR mode (combines two 
shots, upto +/- 3 EV). The silhouette mode removes detail from the subject. The 
colour sketch mode lets you change the colour and line density. Using the 
selective colour mode it's possible to select up to three colours, with the 
rest of the image appearing in black and white.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Nikon D5100 Handling</h2> The camera has a good sized hand grip that feels 
great, with an elastic rubber coating. It's also 10% smaller than D5000, and 
has a 17% thinner TFT in comparison. The camera body feels very solid with an 
easy to access memory card cover. It's also reasonably easy to access the 
battery compartment.<br>
<br>
 A full array of connections on the side provide 
HDMI, External Microphone, USB, GPS connections. Very easy to access the live 
view mode thanks to the new auto-returning lever, much more intuitive than 
trying to locate a specific button in a sea of identical buttons. As you would 
expect the DSLR has a metal tripod mount, and there are a number of dedicated 
buttons on the camera including: Flash, Function (default timer button, can be 
customised), dedicated video recording, exposure, plus more.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Also announced today is a new Nikon ME-1 Microphone&nbsp;</h3> Designed 
specifically for use with DSLRs, it sits on the flash-hotshoe. Microphone - 
Stereo, vibration dampened with rubber isolating the microphone from the SLR 
body. Cable designed so as not to be in the way of shooting. Built in low level 
noise filtering, wind filter, battery powered, using the external microphone 
allows the vodeo to avoid picking up lens noise from focusing. Priced at 
&pound;119 and designed for any DSLR with support for external microphones. 
Read theNikon ME-1 Microphone press information. <br>
<br>
<strong>ME-1 Key 
features:</strong> <br>
 Flat and low frequency cut off <br>
 Vibration 
reduction (using rubber damping)<br>
 Water and dust resistant <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Menus</h3> The built in menus are clearly laid out with each section 
notable from it's dominant colour, such as the green photo menus, blue 
playback, red setup, etc. The playback editing options are particularly feature 
packed allowing most of the effects and more to be applied to photos taken.<br>

<br> Overview of menus: <br>
<br>
<br>
Playback Shooting Custom Settings <br>

<br> Setup Retouch Recent Settings <br>
<br>
<br>
 The retouch menu is worth 
highlighting as there is a large number of options available 
including:&nbsp;D-Lighting,&nbsp;Red-eye correction,&nbsp;Trim, Monochrome, 
Filter effects, Colour balance, Resize, Image overlay, RAW processing, Quick 
retouch, Straighten, Distortion control, Fisheye, Colour outline, Perspective 
control, Colour sketch, Miniature effect, Selective colour, and Movie editing.
<br> <br>
<strong>Battery&nbsp;</strong> <br>
 The camera uses a Lithium Ion 
battery, model EN-EL14, and is the same battery as used in the Nikon D3100 and 
Nikon Coolpix P7000. Battery life is not specified at this moment in time, and 
we will update when we know.<br>
<br>
<strong>Speed</strong> <br>
 Continuous 
shooting is quick at 4fps, the focusing system is quick with&nbsp;11 focusing 
points, and&nbsp;in use the camera's focusing seemed particularly quick. There 
is also a built in AF illuminator for when you are in less than ideal lighting 
situations.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Nikon D5100 Performance</h2> The camera's ISO ranges from ISO100 to 
ISO3200/6400 with Hi modes of 12800 and 25,600 available in normal use, and up 
to ISO102,400 setting available in the Night Vision scene mode (not a typo!). 
This should enable shots to be taken at night of wildlife or in other 
situations where you simply would not have otherwise been able to get a photo 
without using flash or alternative lighting methods. The camera does switch to 
black and white mode, however, I was unable to fully appreciate the mode in the 
brief hands on that I had, as lighting was generally quite good.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<h3>Video</h3> The camera features a dedicated video record button, accessible 
regardless of the mode dial position, meaning you can apply creative effects to 
videos for example. Offering&nbsp;Full HD at 30/25/24fps covers all potential 
uses including use in the US (NTSC), UK (PAL), and film industry (24fps). 
Videos are recorded in the H.264 MOV file format (instead of M-JPEG on D5000), 
and lower resolutions, such as&nbsp;720p are also available. The effects should 
be available without any noticeable effect on fps (to be confirmed).<br>
<br>

<strong>Value for money</strong> <br>
 Priced at &pound;679 body only or 
&pound;779 with 18-55 VR lens / with vr double kit lenses - this prices it
<strong>very</strong> competitively with the Canon EOS 600D, which costs around 
&pound;769 with IS kit lens, and on face value the Nikon D5100 appears what 
some might consider a more complete package, although the 600D features an 18mp 
sensor, compared to the 16.2mp sensor in the D5100.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Nikon D5100&nbsp;Verdict</h2> Initial impressions were very positive, with 
the Nikon D5100 appearing to hit all the key requirements, and improves on the 
Nikon offerings by building on both the success of the D3100 and the D5000. The 
camera also appears to out perform the Canon 600D in specifications as it goes 
beyond what the Canon offers, with quicker shooting, improved focusing, and 
enhanced creative modes. With the well known and well respected 16mp CMOS 
sensor from the Nikon D7000, it should be able to offer improved low light, low 
noise photography and theoretically better image quality, in fact, you should 
get the same excellent Nikon D7000 image quality, but at a much more wallet 
friendly price. I suspect Nikon are onto a real winner here, and we will be 
giving the complete verdict when we review the production DSLR in the next 
couple of weeks.&nbsp;<br>

<p>I understand that yet again this Nikon does not have a mirror up shooting 
mode, but only a flip flap as the mirror goes uo and down when the shutter is 
pressed in live mode. Is this so?<br>

<p>Not sure about that.... but it almost certainly has the Nikon 
&quot;quiet&quot; mode which has a sort of minor mirror-up function. I 
certainly find that it helps greatly in reducing shake on low shutter speed 
hand-held shots (on my D5000)</p> <br>
