<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard all kinds of opinions about the Leica M8 
digital camera but most of them were likely based on conjecture, and on the 
widely circulated stories about the tendency of the camera&rsquo;s sensor to 
turn certain polyester products purple when photographed in bright light. I 
wanted to do a hands-on evaluation because I&rsquo;ve used Leica products since 
1980 and I&rsquo;ve found their optics second to none. I love the feel and the 
ergonomics of the bodies and I&rsquo;m very comfortable with rangefinder 
focusing. I find the rangefinder focusing to be the second biggest selling 
point of these cameras, right after my regard for their astonishingly good 
lenses. I also wanted to try out the Summarit-M series of lenses, as they are a 
more reasonably-priced series of quality lenses from Leica.</p>  M8 with 
Summarit-M lenses: 35mm, 50mm, 75mm, 90mm<br>

<p>So, what&rsquo;s the Leica M8 all about? In a bare bones summary it is a 
digital version of the Leica M7 rangefinder camera with a few added 
attractions. That makes it a hand built, high precision rangefinder camera that 
takes a range of very well designed and produced lenses. It&rsquo;s not anSLR. 
There is no moving mirror in front of the sensor plane, and rather than 
focusing through the lenses all composition and focusing is done through a 
viewfinder frame that shows the boundaries of attached lenses with bright frame 
lines projected into the viewfinder. It is the extension of the Leica 
&ldquo;M&rdquo; franchise that has continued its relevance in the world of 
photography for over five decades.</p> 
<p>Since digital routed film, I&rsquo;ve been photographing with a constantly 
evolving assortment of Nikon and KodakSLR cameras. The current Nikon D700 is a 
wonderful camera which produces remarkably good files. The Nikon lenses are 
also very good. During this transitional period in photography I found myself 
constantly pining for a Leica &ldquo;version&rdquo; of digital. About a month 
ago a box arrived at my house and I found myself with a loaner Leica M8 and 
four of their new Summarit-M lenses. It happened on the same week that I took 
possession of my first Nikon D700. The coincidental appearance of the two 
cameras together led me to test them against each other in &ldquo;real 
world&rdquo; shooting situations. The results have been interesting, 
frustrating, fascinating and amazing. The Nikon D700 does everything well. The 
M8 does a small handful of things really well.</p> 
<p>(For background information about the Leica Rangefinder M series cameras, 
please see my 2001 article on theLeica M6.)</p> 
<p>It is amazing to consider how far digital photography has come in such a 
short time and how nice the files look. The Leica M8 has maintained its 
(admittedly niche) relevance in spite of its less than cutting edge technology. 
It&rsquo;s frustrating to note just how much better the Leica could be. 
We&rsquo;ll cover these issues in the course of this review. We&rsquo;ll also 
take a good, hard look at four new lenses that Leica recently introduced that 
nicely rebute the idea that all Leica glass is only affordable by investment 
bankers, surgeons and oil sheiks.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s start with a little background</h2>  Series 3: 35mm Summarit-M 
(Fair Bean Coffee House)<br>

<p>The Leica company was &ldquo;the&rdquo; camera company in the world right 
up until the 1960&rsquo;s. In the days before SLRs with &ldquo;instant 
return&rdquo; mirrors, Leica made the finest rangefinders available. They also 
made incredible lenses to go with their camera bodies. Rangefinder cameras were 
the gold standard because they offered very bright viewfinders and very 
accurate focusing for wide angle to moderate telephoto lenses. The typical 
photographer in the 1950&rsquo;s got along very well with lenses in the 28mm to 
90mm range. In 1954, at Photokina, Leica introduced a new style of rangefinder 
camera based on a new lens mount that has lived on relatively unchanged for 
over 58 years. The first model was called the M3 and that camera is still much 
sought after today because of its high magnification viewfinder, its relatively 
silent shutter and its bullet proof mechanical construction.</p> 
<p>While current competitors talk about shutters constructed to go up to 
150,000 or 250,000 exposures before failure, stories are legions of Leica M 
shutters going strong at a million or more actuations! The M introduced a new 
lens mount that allowed photographers to change out lenses very quickly, with 
less than a quarter rotation of the lens. The new mount also gave lens 
designers more room to work their magic with new generations of optics that, to 
professional photographers in that era, were amazingly good. I still use a dual 
range 50mm Summicron from the late 1950&rsquo;s on my Leica M6 film cameras to 
this day with results that rival the best current lenses from Japanese 
companies.</p> 
<p>Leica sold millions of M3&rsquo;s and later variants of the body style but 
they made a few missteps during the early years of the 1960&rsquo;s that left 
them in a precarious situation from which they have never fully recovered. They 
totally missed the idea that consumers would throng to SLR&rsquo;s to gain 
features like, a much wider range of available focal lengths, the ability to 
compose and focus through the taking lens and, of course, the lower price of 
the new generation of cameras. Nikon started the ball rolling in 1959 with the 
well received Nikon F. Pentax added a system that allowed metering through the 
lens for greater exposure accuracy. By the 1970&rsquo;s, Nikon, Canon, Pentax, 
Olympus and Minolta had pushed the entire market for cameras away from the 
rangefinder paradigm and drove consumers steadfastly into the arena of theSLR. 
Leica tried to gain back market share with severalSLR product introductions but 
by the time they hit the market their offerings were perceived to be very 
expensive and a few years behind their competitors when it came to features.</p>
<p>However, in one part of the market, the Leica continued to be popular with 
street photographers and artists who needed a highly capable imaging machine 
that was both stealthy and quiet. It was always easier to focus fast, wide 
angle lenses with the M cameras and few machines beat them when it comes to 
quiet and unobtrusive operation. They were the cameras of choice for top 
photographers like: Henri Cartier Bresson, Robert Frank, William Klein, Lee 
Freidlander, Sebastio Salgado and many others.</p> 
<p>These artists looked to the Leica M series rangefinder for three attributes:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the bright, easy to use, always in focus, viewfinder</li> 
<li>the high level of mechanical reliability</li> 
<li>the low aural and visual profile of the cameras, which helped the 
photographer work in a very candid manner</li> </ul>  75mm Summarit-M. ISO 640 
(Medici Coffee House, Austin)<br>

<p>The next biggest reason to own a Leica rangefinder has always been the 
glass.<br>
 Leica is one of the acknowledged leaders in the world when it comes 
to designing and building lenses for cameras (and microscopes). Leica earned 
this reputation by taking a lead in all areas of lens creation back in the 
1950&rsquo;s and never relinquishing that lead over the decades. When I wrote 
an article about theLeica M6, (compare prices) (review), for this site back in 
2001, many readers posted opinions about the relative value of the brand but 
few refuted the technical sophistication and superiority of their lenses. 
Granted, most photographers don&rsquo;t work with the highest level of 
technique that would make the differences between brands of lenses immediately 
apparent (tripod mounting, exact exposures, critical focusing, etc.) but many 
people did write to say that the effects of the Leica glass were 
&ldquo;special&rdquo;, &ldquo;had a three dimensional quality&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;added a special feel&rdquo;, etc.</p> 
<p>If I were to distill what it is about Leica lenses that make them superior 
I would have to start with the design philosophy they&rsquo;ve espoused for 
decades. The lens should be sharp and usable at its widest aperture! If you 
build an f/1.4 lens it should be usable at f/1.4. Most of their competitors 
build lenses with high apertures that could only be used in the direst of 
photographic emergencies and then with mediocre results. Leica&rsquo;s 
designers also design for the way people look at photographs. Their emphasis is 
on high apparent sharpness and great rendering of micro fine detail. If they 
have to sacrifice things like extreme corner resolution or ultimate resolution, 
they will do so. They are lenses that are meant to be used rather than tested 
on optical test benches (although the high level of implementation also enables 
them to perform well in those arenas as well).</p> 
<p>For example: A fast aperture, wide angle lens like the Leica 28mm f/2 
Summicron-M, (compare prices) (review), is highly usable at f/2 with the center 
two-thirds of the frame being critically sharp. Stopping down one or two stops 
only serves to sharpen up the extreme corners of the lens. TheLeica 75mm f/2 
Summicron-M, (compare prices), is highly corrected across the frame at f/2 
giving up only in the area of close focusing.</p> 
<p>While Leica&rsquo;s lenses are traditionally three, four or five times as 
expensive as lenses from their competitors, generations of working 
photographers (and very discerning amateurs) have not hesitated to buy them, 
knowing that the unique characteristics of these optics can be powerful 
differentiators in what is otherwise a very homogeneous marketplace.<br>
 
Here&rsquo;s what Leica has done for us lately.</p> 
<h2>The Leica M8</h2>  Kirk Tuck <br>

<p>They took the time-proven M series camera body and redesigned the guts to 
bring us a unique digital photographic tool. They worked with Kodak to include 
a very good sensor that yields some interesting trade-offs. The first thing 
you&rsquo;ll notice about the Kodak 10.3MP sensor is how much dynamic range it 
has. It&rsquo;s hard to blow out highlight detail with this piece of silicon. I 
captured samples of Noellia Hernandez drinking coffee and deliberately 
overexposed by one full stop. All of the highlight detail was easily captured 
when converting the industry standard .dng files in Adobe Camera Raw. This 
capturing technique, similar to the way we used to handle color negative film, 
also yields much cleaner shadow detail because it is captured much further up 
the curve where there are many more steps of shadow information.</p> 
<p>The second attribute of the sensor is the very neutral, very film like 
rendering of color and tonal relationships. The more experienced photographer 
is not satisfied with high color saturation at the expense of fine gradations 
of tone and color. In fact, after spending several weeks with the M8 I 
couldn&rsquo;t stand to look at files shot at &ldquo;standard&rdquo; settings 
on the Nikon D700. I wasn&rsquo;t happy again with the D700 until I reduced the 
saturation settings and started using profiles that were custom produced for 
that camera.</p> 
<p>Leica also took a good, hard look at the prevailing practice of putting 
&ldquo;anti-aliasing&rdquo; filters in front of camera sensors to reduce or 
illuminate moire patterns in the final files. Kodak has a history of producing 
cameras (like the KodakSLR/n) that use no anti-aliasing filters in front of 
their sensors. While moire patterns do show up from time to time, these cameras 
have the appearance of producing image files with much greater amounts of fine 
and micro fine detail which, in turn, allows for greater enlarge-ability and a 
greater overall perception of quality. Leica chose to go only with an infra-red 
blocking filter in front of their M sensor and the results can be wonderful. 
The feeling of sharpness and detail is wonderful. The results from my Nikon 
D700 are also very good, but they are, to a certain extent, interpolated data. 
This means that the camera is making up information to give me the impression 
of sharpness. In some cases this works well. In other cases, not so well.</p>  
75mm Summarit-M. (Starbucks)<br>

<p>When Kodak designed this sensor chip for Leica they had to take into 
consideration just how close the back of a Leica wide angle lens could sit in 
relationship to the sensor. Since Leica lenses don&rsquo;t have to be designed 
to compensate for the space required for a moving mirror they could optimize 
their designs and have the back of the lenses close to the film plane. When 
digital came along one of the obvious design issues was the difference between 
the way film and digital respond to the light coming through lenses.</p> 
<p>Film doesn&rsquo;t care about the angle that like strikes. It will engage 
at most any angle or direction. Digital sensors are a bit more finicky and 
require light to come into their pixel wells at a much less severe angle than 
can be handled by film. In order to keep the information of the sides and in 
the corners of the frames from falling off too quickly Leica and Kodak needed 
to come up with a way to compensate for the severe angles with which light 
strikes the edges of the frame. This is especially critical with wide angle 
lenses which already have a tendency to vignette as a result of their designs.
</p> 
<p>Their solution was to add micro lenses over the pixel wells to focus and 
deliver light energy in a more direct fashion. In a further enhancement the 
micro lenses over the outer areas of the sensor are increasingly offset to cope 
with the increasing angles of light. The result is a sensor that, in 
conjunction with software enhancements, yields files that are very even across 
the frame.</p> 
<h2>So, what are the inevitable trade offs in this sensor design?</h2> 
<p>Well, five years ago we would have pronounced this camera and it&rsquo;s 
sensors performance as &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo;. But now we have cameras 
like the Nikon D3 and D700 and the Canon 5D to compare it to. The Leica/Kodak 
sensor is not a low noise champion. At ISO&rsquo;s up to 1200 it is very well 
behaved and few would have issue with it&rsquo;s noise performance. At 
ISO&rsquo;s over 1200 it starts to become noisier and the old Kodak &ldquo;blue 
channel&rdquo;noise starts to intrude. The Kodak CCD&rsquo;s pixels measure 6.8 
microns and are not in the same league for low noise as the latest generation
CMOS chips used in the Nikons and Canons. In my mind this is not a deal breaker 
for two important reasons:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The camera doesn&rsquo;t vibrate like cameras with moving mirrors, which 
gives about two stops more hand holding ability.</li> 
<li>The prime lenses have much better performance at wider apertures than most 
of the more commonly used high quality &ldquo;pro&rdquo; zoom lenses from Canon 
and Nikon, adding another two stops to the mix.</li> </ol> 
<h2>What did Leica get just right?</h2>  M8-three important features <br>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t shot with an M series camera you certainly should seek 
out a dealer and play with one of these bodies. This is a design that they got 
&ldquo;just right&rdquo; over fifty years ago. It feels perfect in the hand and 
once you get the hang of the rangefinder and the clear, clean viewfinder 
you&rsquo;ll be spoiled for using SLRs. It is also much smaller and lighter 
than other professional camera and lens combinations. Big thumbs up for design 
and the integration of new digital components into a trusted body style.</p> 
<p>The shutter release on Leicas has always been exemplary. The M8 is no 
exception. A soft touch turns on the meter while a bit more pressure triggers 
the shutter. But it is important to understand that the point at which the 
shutter releases has a distinct feel that gives the photographer perfect 
feedback. The shutter fires exactly when you are ready to fire and not a 
microsecond before or after. And since the camera is manually focused there is 
never a time lag while the camera tries to figure stuff out. In fact, since 
there is no mirror to release the triggering of the shutter is almost 
instantaneous. From tap to snap the time elapsed is no more than 25 
milliseconds. Nearly twice as fast as the Nikon D700! Less time lag means more 
direct control, more pure reaction. This is the Leica&rsquo;s true high 
performance characteristic.</p> 
<p>I think they got the shutter itself just right. All previous generations of 
Leica M cameras used a very simple and very robustly built, cloth focal plane 
shutter. It lasted forever and was very quiet in operation. The trade off was a 
very slow 1/50th of a second electronic flash sync speed and a top shutter 
speed of 1/1000th of a second. Forget about using one of those shutters for 
fill flash in just about any situation! In the new M8 Leica switched to a metal 
and carbon fiber composite focal plane shutter offering the same high 
reliability but giving users a top shutter speed of 1/8000th of a second (the 
previous shutter topped out at 1/1000th of a second) and a flash 
synchronization speed of 1/250th of a second, which is very competitive.<br>
 
The trade off is a bit more mechanical noise from the shutter. But it is still 
quite low when compared to the obtrusively dynamic shutter noises that thunder 
out of my D700 body&mdash;and there is no mirror slap to add to the sound.</p> 
<h2>Leica got their new series of Summarit-M lenses just right.</h2> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal. Leica has always made the finest high speed lenses 
in the 35mm market but the trade-off has always been the ruinously high cost of 
those lenses. This limits the number of people who can afford to use the Leica 
as a system. For years, Leica enthusiasts have hammered away at Leica trying to 
convince them to make a line of more modestly specified lenses at a much lower 
cost.</p> 
<p>While high speed glass with sharp maximum apertures provides a look and 
feel to images that can rarely be equaled by competitors, there are many 
situations in which high performance at large apertures is not necessary. 
Typically, the depth of field at full aperture is razor thin, limiting the 
usefulness when more than one subject needs to be sharply focused. The 
interesting aspect of lens design is that it is much easier and much less 
expensive to design and produce lenses with less ambitious apertures. In fact, 
the complexity of a lens design generally is thought to increase by a factor of 
four for a one stop speed increase.</p>  finger grip on the Summarit-M 35mm <br>
<p>Part of the increase in complexity and cost in lens design is the need for 
extremely high manufacturing tolerances as the diameter of lens elements 
increases. The short version is that it&rsquo;s possible to make very high 
performance lenses with more modest apertures, at a fraction of the cost of 
more esoteric lenses! That is just what Leica has done.<br>
 Over the last year 
they have introduced four new lenses for the M cameras. The lenses are all 
called Summarits. That&rsquo;s the name Leica uses for lenses that have maximum 
apertures of f/2.5. The new lenses include: 35mm, 50mm, 75mm and 90mm. The 
barrel designs of the 75 and the 90 are very similar to the Leica R lenses and 
include rubber focusing rings. The 35 and the 50 are both very reminiscent of 
Leica lenses in the same range, designed in the 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s. 
They each have a protrusion, or a &ldquo;finger grip&rdquo; that provides a 
good purchase on the focusing ring to facilitate easy focusing in-spite of a 
fairly narrow, metal focusing ring. Compared toSLR lenses all four of the 
Summarits are tiny; the 35mm and 50mm especially so.</p> 
<p>The construction is flawless and each lens has a heft that belies its size. 
Even so, the entire quartet of lenses and an M8 body together will tip the 
scales at only around 2.5 kilograms!</p> 
<h2>How the Summarit-M Lenses Stack Up</h2> 
<p>All four of the Summarit lenses share the same neutral color and contrast 
characteristics. Except for the angle of coverage you would be hard pressed to 
believe that you were seeing images from four different lenses! Here are the 
family characteristics:</p> 
<h4>High Sharpness</h4>  50mm Summarit-M. (Downtown in Austin) <br>

<p>High sharpness across the full frame at full aperture, even higher 
sharpness when stopped down! The 35mm needs f/5.6 to achieve highest sharpness, 
the 50mm is eyeball slicing sharp at f/4 and the two longer lenses are just 
right by f/3.5. When I say they are sharp I mean that even my best and latest 
Nikkors can&rsquo;t compare.</p> 
<p>I shot one test of a model using the Leica 50mm at f/5.6 and the new, Nikon 
60mmAFS Micro at f/5.6 and they were very close. The Leica had a certain 
impression of sharpness that, to quote many Leicaphiles over the years, 
actually looked, &ldquo;three dimensional&rdquo;. There was nothing wrong with 
the rendition of the Nikon lens but its interpretation seemed clinical and 
lackluster in direct comparison with the Leica 5o.</p> 
<p>Of course, we weren&rsquo;t comparing apples to apples as the Leica had the 
advantage of drawing on a sensor that didn&rsquo;t have an anti-aliasing filter 
dumbing down the detail. It would have been interesting, but outside the scope 
of my capabilities, to adapt the lenses so that they worked on each 
company&rsquo;s camera bodies for the sake of comparison. However, when 
reviewing digital cameras and lenses it is important to change one&rsquo;s 
mindset and evaluate the body and lenses together as a unified system. That is 
the way they will be used.</p> 
<h4>No Flare</h4>  Flare Test. 50mm Summarit-M <br>

<p>I shot with the lenses for a month in the bright Texas sun and never saw 
even the slightest hint of flare. That stood out to me. In my Nikon system 
there is an inertia toward using zoom lenses. They offer so much flexibility. 
If we never compare the zoom lenses to anything else we generally find the 
performance convincing (or like so many aspects of digital images, we find it 
to be &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;). The reality is that the large number of 
elements in a modern zoom makes them flare &ldquo;magnets&rdquo;. If there is 
flare a complex zoom lens will find it. One of the advantages of prime lenses 
is their much simpler construction. With fewer elements and fewer glass 
surfaces these lenses are much more flare resistant. This is not just seen in 
the absence of classic diaphragm reflections in the images it also makes a lens 
much clearer and more &ldquo;contrasty&rdquo; by eliminating the 
&ldquo;veiling&rdquo; effects of less dramatic flare. Any amount of flare 
degrades sharpness, contrast and color saturation. I can see these effects when 
I compare a lens like theNikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor, (compare prices) with the 
Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8G ED AF-S, (compare prices). In many instances you can see a 
noticeable increase in lens performance with just the addition of an efficient 
lens hood.</p> 
<p>The best compliment I can give to this family of lenses is that in most 
cases, they are as good as their much more expensive Summicron and Summilux 
brothers and sisters. In my opinion, the 35mm Summarit is slightly superior to 
the 35mm Summicron, but it does give up nearly 2/3rds of a stop. I 
wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate for a moment to use any one of these lenses instead of 
the high-priced spread.</p>

<h2>My favorite two new lenses.</h2> 
<p>If I bought an M8, I would probably restrict myself to just three lenses: 
Leica 21mm f/2.8 Elmarit-M, $3,995, Leica 35mm f/2.5 Summarit-M, (compare prices
), and theLeica 75mm f/2.5 Summarit-M, (compare prices). The way the camera is 
set up the images experience a 1.33X crop factor. This means that each lens 
acts like a lens 1.33 times longer. The 35mm with the crop factor would be a 
46.55mm lens. That&rsquo;s close enough to my favorite focal length, which is 
the traditional 50mm, to make me very happy. I would like a wider lens as well 
and would choose the 21mm, which acts like a 28mm. I would be very happy to 
make the 75mm my longest focal length, an equivalent of approximately 100 mm. 
Anything wider than the 21mm would require a separate viewfinder. On the other 
end of the scale, I would have problems composing in the tiny frame provided 
for the 90mm lens. As usual, the M8 viewfinder has the marvelous quality of 
showing the area outside of the chosen frame. It&rsquo;s an attribute of bright 
line rangefinder cameras that is a good aid to both composition and to being 
able to anticipate objects moving into the prescribed frame.</p> 
<p>While I would have to step outside the Summarit family to put together a 
totally useful kit I would have the satisfaction of saving over $2,000 on two 
of the lenses!</p> 
<h2>Hands-on experience.</h2>  50mm Summarit-M <br>

<p>A month is barely enough time to say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to a camera, much 
less become proficient in its use. Fortunately my decades of experience with 
other M series cameras helped me quickly flatten out the learning curve.</p> 
<p>My first adventure with the camera came while photographing a cancer clinic 
in Austin, Texas. I was making photographs of doctors interacting with their 
patients and with nurses interacting with chemotherapy patients. The marketing 
people were looking for a very unobstrusive approach defined by using only 
natural light. They also insisted on not posing people. As I moved through the 
main room where chemotherapy was delivered I realized that some patients were 
in pain, others quite nauseous, so I tried to be as quiet and discrete as I 
could be. I alternated between two cameras for my work, using them 
interchangeably over a period of about nine hours. I used the Leica M8 with the 
35mm, 50mm and the 75mm Summarits and I used the Nikon D700 with several primes 
including the 28/2.0, the eight element 35/2.0, the 50/1.2 and the 85/1.4.</p> 
<p>I was able to shoot the D700 at 3200 ISO with files that were similar in 
quality to Leica M8 files shot at 1200ISO. That wasn&rsquo;t really a big deal. 
As I mentioned earlier in the article, I felt like I was able to pick up two 
stops of &ldquo;vibration reduction&rdquo; because the M camera had less 
vibration during its operation.</p>  Benjamin Tuck @ Asti Trattoria, 35mm 
Summarit-M<br>

<p>When I sat down to edit the images in Photoshop CS3, I noticed that the 
Nikon files were a bit cleaner where noise was concerned but that the color was 
more neutral with the Leica camera. The detail in the Leica files was 
marginally better. One thing I should make clear right off the bat is that the 
Nikon auto white balance runs rings around the auto white balance in the M8. 
They are easily two generations apart. Thankfully, I was shooting raw with both 
cameras. And when I did my post processing it was easier to make a neutral and 
pleasing image from the Leica!</p> 
<p>If I were restricted to shooting jpegs with the Leica I would never take it 
out of the bag. The color can be all over the map! The M8 is hopelessly 
outclassed by the Nikon D700. When we switch over to theRAW arena things even 
out nicely.</p> 
<p>The bottom line is, which camera helps you shoot with better composition 
and better timing? Which camera creates a better photo? By better photo I mean 
a photo that is seen and captured with less space between intention and 
reality. The M8 is a really mature shooter&rsquo;s camera, especially at the 
wide end. If I owned one I would probably spot weld the 35mm to the mount. 
Seeing beyond the edges of the frames spurs much more compositional 
experimentation than the tunnel effect of theSLR. The photographs that result 
have a much more sophisticated edginess about them that translates into more 
visual excitement. On a more prosaic note, the low profile and low noise 
attributes of the Leica helped the doctors and patients ignore my presence to a 
much greater extent than the noise and profile of a D700 with its loud, 
clacking mirror.</p> 
<p>There are other differences between the two cameras that I need to mention. 
TheLCD on the back of the Nikon D700, D300 and D3 cameras is 3 inches of 
glorious technology. The screens are bright and detailed with over 900,000 
pixels to play with. By contrast, the Leica is a 2.5-inch screen with fewer 
than 300,000 pixels of resolution. You will see a difference. Does it translate 
at all in the finished images? No. But the nicer screens are much better for 
evaluating results in the field. Is it a deal killer? Not at all. Most Leica 
users are documenters; they use their cameras to record, tending to capture 
more and chimp less. Many people use DSLRs like mini view cameras, checking 
every change of exposure, composition or menu parameter between every shot. 
It&rsquo;s all a matter or working styles.</p> 
<h2>My final assessment?</h2> 
<p>When I first played with the camera and lenses I was not impressed. With 
each passing week, I found my camera skills sharpening up and my reflexes 
improving. I grab the M8 almost exclusively when I head out the door now and 
find it much more fun than any of my other cameras to shoot. I can also wear it 
all day long with the 35mm lens without noticing the weight.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve begun to understand the way its RAW files work and when I take 
advantage of its monstrously large dynamic range by &ldquo;over-exposing&rdquo; 
and then drawing back the highlights in theRAW conversion software I&rsquo;ve 
been able to make gorgeous files with open, noiseless shadows at ISOs up to 640.
</p> 
<p>No doubt that doing business exclusively with the Leica M8 would be very 
difficult. I would miss my access to lenses with focal lengths up to 400mm. I 
would also miss the close focusing of my macro lenses and the tight flash 
control of the Nikon iTTL system. As an adjunct to my existing system I can 
certainly see many applications, such as shooting in board room situations, 
where this camera would excel.</p> 
<p>Last January, I photographed a corporate meeting, at the Breakers Hotel in 
West Palm Beach, with 80 top executives from a very large company. I was using 
several D300s and I was trying to be as discrete as possible. During one break, 
theCEO of the company came up to me and said, &ldquo;Your camera is too 
loud!&rdquo; I looked for a smile and one was not forthcoming. He was 
absolutely serious. I quickly fashioned a makeshift blimp out of some Zing 
neoprene pouches and gaffers tape but I was mortified by his critique. Had I 
been shooting with the M8 I doubt the CEO&rsquo;s bat-like ears would have even 
registered the sound!</p> 
<p>I must also say that no matter how good engineers are at softening the 
momentum of the mirror mechanisms in SLRs, the rangefinder cameras will always 
have less vibration, which translates into better images in the shutter range 
from 1/4 to 1/125s. Of course, the whole paradigm of hand-holdability would 
change in favor of the Nikons if they were to implement their VR2 in their 
prime lenses.</p> 
<h2>The good points about the Leica M8 and the Summarit Lenses</h2>  depth of 
field scale on the 50mm Summarit-M<br>

<ol> 
<li>More fun to compose through a bright line finder with moderate focal 
length lenses.</li> 
<li>Ultra fast shutter reaction time. No perceptible lag!</li> 
<li>Very neutral and believable images from RAW files.</li> 
<li>Four lenses and one body in the space usually take up by one body and one 
normal zoom lens.</li> 
<li>A camera body honed to ergonomic perfection</li> 
<li>Lenses that set a standard for sharpness and contrast.</li> 
<li>Lenses that can be used wide open without a care (and focused with greater 
accuracy.)</li> 
<li>Beautiful depth of field scales on each of the lenses.</li> 
<li>The .dng file represents an open standard and enhances the archival 
capabilities of the files.</li> 
<li>Very low noise shutter with no mirror noise.</li> </ol> 
<h2>And to be fair, my list of gripes about the camera (no gripes about the 
lenses!!)</h2>  battery location on the M8 <br>

<ol> 
<li>When you hit the limits of the image buffer some of the frames get 
corrupted and are unreadable (very bad).</li> 
<li>The camera has its own proprietary battery, which is small and would be 
incredibly hard to find in any secondary market.</li> 
<li>The camera is slow to start up when turned on.</li> 
<li>You give up the use of lenses longer than 90mm (framing a 135mm would be 
very dicey.)</li> 
<li>The frame lines are very approximate and I found, routinely, that the 
subject on screen contained more area than was shown in the finder. This makes 
tight composition much harder.</li> 
<li>The bottom of the camera must be removed in order to change the battery or 
swap out the SD memory card. You&rsquo;ll have both hands full when you attempt 
either operation.</li> 
<li>The battery charger has a nice dual light indicator showing that a battery 
is charged or is in process but the charger takes three hours to charge one 
battery, which is less than optimal for a $5500 camera.</li> 
<li>The jpeg files are not as good as their competitors files. (The M8 begs to 
shoot inRAW only.)</li> 
<li>The auto white balance is not in the same league as the current top of the 
line Canon and Nikon cameras. (You&rsquo;ll either be shootingRAW or you can 
set a custom white balance with relative ease, so this one is not a deal 
breaker.)</li> 
<li>The sheer cost. For a limited range of capabilities it is a frightfully 
expensive system. What do you expect from a limited edition, hand-built, German 
camera?</li> </ol> 
<h2>Kirk&rsquo;s Final Analysis</h2>  Summarit-M 75mm <br>

<p>If you have the extra cash and you are the kind of photographer who loves 
street photography and documentary styles of photography, this is a must have 
camera system. If you are willing to put up with film you can save a bundle by 
choosing a good, used M6 Leica instead. If you try to make do with any of the 
compact point-and-shoots on the market, you will inevitably be disappointed. 
Take it from someone who buys every &ldquo;remarkably new compact camera 
guaranteed to compete with SLRs&rdquo;, this system is in an entirely different 
universe when compared with cameras like the Sigma DP-1, etc.</p> 
<p>If you are a high-end wedding photographer who needs great focusing in low 
light and dramatically good lenses, this is the camera for you. Using this 
camera will change your approach to wedding photography, which will make your 
work look different from your competitors, which will give you effective market 
differentiation and may increase your bookings.</p> 
<p>If you like to work with mid-range prime lenses and are about to take a 
trip around the world with very limited luggage, this system is ideal for you. 
It&rsquo;s smaller and lighter than it&rsquo;sSLR competitors and will turn in 
just as good (or better) a performance.</p> 
<p>Like all new cameras, Leica is still working some kinks out of this one. 
When they finish getting all the little &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; right it will be 
a formidable image maker. I don&rsquo;t want to send my evaluation equipment 
back. I keep hoping someone will call from Leica and say, &ldquo;The shipping 
is way too expensive, why don&rsquo;t you just keep the system and enjoy 
it!&rdquo; Final word? I love photographing with this camera.</p>

<p>10/10 - First article I have read that fully explains the positioning and 
design philosophy of this camera. Now I finally understand its benefits and 
associated issues.</p> 
<p> I still can't afford one though :-)</p> 
<p>Kirk Tuck , October 22, 2008; 11:39 A.M. </p> 
<p>Gadge, if you want more information about what makes all M cameras a more 
compelling choice you might want to take a moment and read my review on the 
Leica M6 that is also located somewhere on Photo.net.</p> 
<p> The differences between traditional SLR's and the Leica M cameras is 
fleshed out in a little more detail.</p> 
<p> Thanks to all for the positive feedback I've received on the article so 
far.</p> 
<p> Kirk</p> 
<p>Jorge Diaz , October 22, 2008; 12:39 P.M. </p> 
<p> Excellent review.I sometimes use a Summar (circa 1932) on my M8 for 
definitely different photographic qualities. One thing about Leica M lenses is 
the relaxed life they have relative to SLR's opening and closing diaphragms on 
each shot.A lot of wear and tear is avoided.No springs to fatigue.Leica lenses 
are usually more expensive but they have superior longevity built in too. Cool 
model.Considering all that java. I got a jolt just by looking.</p> 
<p>Robin Smith , October 22, 2008; 01:55 P.M. </p> 
<p>Kirk, </p> 
<p> I like the review, but you say nothing about the dreaded IR issue. Was 
this because it is a non-issue for you? Did you use the IR filters?</p> 
<p>Kirk Tuck , October 22, 2008; 02:40 P.M. </p> 
<p>Robin, I did not use UV filters and I never encounter the dreaded IR 
effect. I shot in all kinds of light and with different kinds of fabrics but 
nothing happened. I would guess that the newest lenses have coatings with 
stronger UV resistance than previous ones which might serve to obviate the use 
of the filters. Absolutely no magenta or fringing. Problem resolved?</p> 
<p>Torben Daltoft , October 23, 2008; 12:39 A.M. </p> 
<p>This &quot;review&quot; is neglecting that the competitors have image 
stabilisation, plus a handful of other essential features (think of sensor 
cleaning)....and thus shows its value</p> 
<p>Kirk Tuck , October 23, 2008; 11:35 A.M. </p> 
<p>Wrong. I covered the benefits of no moving mirror mass and how it relates, 
shutter speed setting-wise, to the more conventional cameras. It is a camera 
meant to fill a niche, not to compete with DSLR's already in the market. The 
lack of mirror movement somewhat makes up for the lack of VR in the body. Not 
all cameras need to have every feature available. In fact, famous Leica 
enthusiast sees the &quot;no frills&quot; M cameras as a simplification back to 
basics and makes the case that the streamlined approach benefits seeing.</p> 
<p>John Fleshin , October 23, 2008; 01:34 P.M. </p> 
<p>Good review, glad I caught it, just had mine serviced and upgraded. Are you 
shooting the auto spot on or adjusting a mite? Was your sample with the new 
firmware and/or frame lines? Do you see any reason to shoot raw + jpeg? Am 
afraid I have quite a mixture of vintage glass, so your conclusions about the 
blue shift might well be a problem solved with new lenses?</p> 
<p> Were you able to use the Dual Range 50mm with it? </p> 
<p> Regards, John</p> 
<p>Kirk Tuck , October 23, 2008; 01:42 P.M. </p> 
<p>John. The camera had the latest firmware and frame lines. I used my Dual 
Range Summicron on it without any issues. I've never been a fan of shooting 
Raw+jpeg as I end up just using the raws in most cases.</p>

<p>Arne H. Heeringa , October 25, 2008; 07:51 P.M. </p> 
<p>Great article, though I might prefer the R-D1s because of its price. I've 
tried a Sigma SD10 which is kind of a no-nonsense camera with some good 
features like seeing more in the viewfinder than the actual frame only, like 
Leica. I gave it up in favour to my Nikon F2 and Nikkormat FTN because of it's 
bad AF, terrible battery life, bad AWB and bad lens. Great sensor though. Fact 
that the camera was changed for a new one by Sigma didn't change a thing. My 
Konica Revio KD420Z P&amp;S digital was way better before it was wrecked, but I 
want to do some creative photograhy myself too and don't leave everything to 
the camera. So I turned back to film with my Nikons, Olympus 35LC rangefinder, 
Rolleiflex, Agfa Isolette L and so on. I would like to stay with manual because 
AF don't seem to work for me and then Leica &amp; Epson are the only options. 
I've tried the manual Nikon lenses on a D200, but the sharpness couldn't be 
optimally focussed. About the point of the hand held photography I think though 
that 1/45 isn't that much of a big deal as 1/30 is no problem with the Nikons 
at all (it helps that they are very, very heavy) and you can do 1/15 most of 
the time. For the FTN I can use the Abrahamson softrelease for Leicas too, and 
then 1/8 works well too if you're carefull.</p> 
<p>CPeter J&oslash;rgensen , October 26, 2008; 12:54 A.M. </p> 
<p>First, the model certainly captured my attention and got me into reading 
the review. Nice model and nice treatment, especially using low ISO to force 
wider apertures and bring out the lens qualities.</p> 
<p> Second, I've been shooting with an M8 since a month or so after they first 
came out, and plan to upgrade to an M8-2 when they are available. (I've owned 
every M-model over the last 45 years, so I guess I just have to keep up my 
record. And I still have an M-7 and, of course, all the modern versions of 
standard Leica lenses from 21 through 135 (except the Summarits which attracted 
me to this article.)</p> 
<p> That said, I've never encountered the color shift problems that upset so 
many people. I am using the filters Leica sent on two lenses, but I don't 
notice any differences. Most of my lenses are not 6-bit encoded but again, I 
can't detect any perceptible deficiencies in the wide angle lenses under common 
shooting conditions. Leica makes the finest lenses for 35 mm and you pay a 
hefty premium for them. I also have an 18 mm Zeiss Distagon F4 that produces 
superb results without encoding or filters.</p> 
<p> The M8, like all the Ms except the horrible M-5, immediately find 
&quot;home&quot; in your hand and are a joy to use.</p>

<p>i can't second the comments about the d700 3200 and the m8 1250. i own both 
and the m8 at 1250 is nowhere near the d700 at 3200. the only way the m8 can 
shoot 1250 clean like the d700 (at 3200) is during daylight or failing light.
</p> 
<p> the achilles heel of the m8 (in my humble opinion) is the high iso 
performance. beyond that it is an excellent camera capable of stunning prints 
with loads of detail.</p>

<p>John, I'm always a bit divided when I talk about noise and cameras. I see 
the differences between the two when I look at the files on my monitor but the 
disconnection for me is how close many cameras with disparate noise signatures 
look when I print them. For me, on a 13x19 inch print the noise from the 
cameras seems to be how I described it. Like most Kodak sensors the M8 sensor 
has different levels of performance based on how much of the scene is shadow 
and how much is mid tone and highlight. Some of what I see as noise in the M8 
is a result of a less deep black than that produced by the Nikon D700 and D3. 
When I use curves to equalize the black levels between the cameras the apparent 
noise drops in the M8 and makes the files look much closer to the D700. People 
have written about this before in regards to the Kodak SLR/n camera.</p> 
<p> There are trade offs everywhere. I will say that it's great to get 
discussion from a photographer like yourself who actually shoots both.</p>

<p><b>You&rsquo;ve probably heard all kinds of opinions about the Leica M8 
digital camera but most of them were likely based on conjecture, and on the 
widely circulated stories about the tendency of the camera&rsquo;s sensor to 
turn certain polyester products purple when photographed in bright light.</b>
</p> 
<p>The opinions that I have heard have come from people who own(ed) the 
camera, not based on conjecture. The IR magenta was a small point of their 
disappointment. Mostly it was different failures of the camera, especially the 
shutter, which caused a trip to service, and a long (2 or more monthes) stay. 
This is what has kept me away from purchasing it.</p> <b>Well, five years ago 
we would have pronounced this camera and it&rsquo;s sensors performance as 
&ldquo;state of the art&rdquo;. But now we have cameras like the Nikon D3 and 
D700 and the Canon 5D to compare it to.</b> 
<p>But the M8 was revealed just <i>two</i> years ago. At which time the 5D had 
already been around for quite a while.</p>

thoughts of camera design issues..... 
<p></p> 
<p>I can understand that lots of early failures took the shine off owning the 
M8. My point, and really the only point a reviewer can offer, is that the above 
review is based on the camera in my hand. I think that over the span of two 
years the team at Leica have been hellbent on fixing as many of the design 
flaws as possible in each successive run of cameras. If I had a product this 
important I would certainly not sit on my hands when it came to improvements. 
Is it too much to believe that a product can be &quot;fixed&quot; during its 
production cycle? If you find that hard to believe how could we ever rely on 
products such as Microsoft Vista.</p> 
<p> I understand that the Canon 5D is three years old. My statement was that 
the implementation of the sensor would have been state of the art five years 
ago. Really.</p> 
<p> I wish there were a site we could all go to and find the real failure rate 
for cameras. It would make the process of buying cameras so much easier. Bottom 
line? I used the camera for six weeks and it did not fail or need life support.

<p>might i also add that in a year of professional, daily use my m8 never 
failed.</p>

<p>Version 2 firmware for the leica M8 greatly improves the white balance. 
Compared to my Nikon D700, I would say the auto white balance of the M8 is 
better, particularly in incandescent lighting. Also, I have to say that the 
shutter sound of the D700 and the M8 are different in tone and quality, but 
hardly different in volume to warrant using one over the other. (I just took 10 
pictures with each comparing them in my deserted kitchen and they're hardly 
different).</p> 
<p>Jeff Hughes , November 01, 2008; 09:00 A.M. </p> 
<p>Hello Kirk. A very nice review. You might like to know that it was your 
very compelling review of the M6 back in 2001 which prompted me to buy my first 
Leica. I picked up the M6ttl that year, the M7 a couple years after that, and 
the M8 two years ago. And a handful of their sterling lenses along the way, of 
course. For a non-pro and a not-rich-guy, it's been an expensive journey, but 
ultimately a transforming one. The Leica M remains far and away my favorite 
camera system. My M8 goes with me everywhere.</p> 
<p> I also own a Nikon D3 and so can appreciate the comparisons you draw. 
IMHO, notwithstanding the Nikon's much newer sensor, the two cameras produce 
comparable image quality. Very large quality prints are routine with both.</p> 
<p> As you mention, the one area the Nikon is head and shoulders above the 
Leica is high iso performance. I generally try to limit my M8 to iso 640 - an 
upper boundary in which it produces very clean images. The D3, conversely, I 
feel comfortable taking all the way up to 6400. The Nikon sensor is remarkable 
in its low light performance.</p> 
<p> Looking at the images you included in your review, it appears your demo 
unit is the original, classic M8. The just-released M8.2 reportedly has a much 
quieter shutter, albeit one with a top speed of 1/4000. The newer model also 
has revised frame lines which supposedly address the minor framing accuracy 
issue you describe. Leica does have an upgrade program where one can send in 
their original M8 and have those items replaced with the newer components.</p> 
<p> Thanks again for the very nice review. I've wondered a few times the last 
couple years if you made the switch to the M8. It's the best camera I've ever 
owned.</p> 
<p> And, yes, a very lovely model!</p> 
<p>Kirk Tuck , November 01, 2008; 12:56 P.M. </p> 
<p>One of the features I like best about the M8.2 is that the shutter charge 
can be delayed (and is less noisy) than the original M8.</p> 
<p>Nuno Borges , November 19, 2008; 03:53 P.M. </p> 
<p>Very well and honestly written. This is exactly why I find a full frame SLR 
and prime lenses a sounder proposition. A 5D even takes and values Leica glass 
for whoever feels the urge.</p> 
<p>Laurent Vuillard , November 25, 2008; 03:14 P.M. </p> 
<p>A subjective but out of experience comment/ I bought a summarit 75 nt 
willing to pay2400euros for the summicron. As a long time user of Leica lenses 
I am really positive that with an M6 this 75 is NOT of the same league as the 
35, 50, summicrons or 28 90 Elmarits that I used a lot, sharpness was not as 
good, full stop!</p> 
<p>Paul Wolossow , November 28, 2008; 03:45 P.M. </p> 
<p>Kirk, A first rate hands-on review. I will be buying an M8 over the next 
week or so to take advantage of the new $1500 rebate from Leica. If you get 
your hands on a M8.2 or M8 with the upgrade, please write a short review of 
them as well. My only dilemma now is which summarit-M lens to get first, the 
35mm (46mm) or the 50mm (66mm). The pictures you took with the 50mm look to me 
to have a more creamy bokeh.</p> 
<p> Thanks, Paul</p> 
<p>Kirk Tuck , November 28, 2008; 11:56 P.M. </p> 
<p>I played with an 8.2 and fell in love with it. If you read my M6 review 
you'd know the first lens I would recommend to anyone would be the 50mm. I have 
used most of the 50's for Nikon and Leica. That focal length just resonates 
with me.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Hello Kirk: good review,straight forward. Nice to read an article from a 
shooters point of view. I prefer or (understand) film, but must use the Digital 
World to keep a living. I use Nikons for some client work and editorial work 
but prefer the ease of the M system. I might have missed this in your article, 
but can one use the older M lenses that are not CPU or 6 bit coded? Will these 
pre 6 bit lenses work on the M8? I am mostly going to be shooting ASA 400 and 
in RAW if I get a M8. I shoot now with M6's, film Tri X not pushed and lenses 
are 35,50,21,(1990's lenses) you can see some of the work here on photonet or 
on flicker@ photo league thanks please let me know about the older lenses 
(1990's). Image is from Velvet Revolution Prague 1989 &copy; N Johnson</p> 
<p>Robert Gordon , December 17, 2008; 05:11 A.M. </p> 
<p>The older Leica lenses (including screw mounts) work fine on the M8 and 
M8.2. They just don't embed EXIF data in the image files.</p> 
<p>Mark Bohrer , January 07, 2009; 04:58 P.M. </p> 
<p>Kirk:<br>
 Thanks for the useful comparison of focal lengths on the M8. </p>
<p> In a recent trip to Chaco Canyon and Santa Fe using the M8, I found myself 
shooting ruins and urban scenes with 50mm f/1.4 (non-ASPH) and 35mm f/2 ASPH 
much more than 21mm ASPH. Part of that was lack of IR-cut filter for the 21mm, 
but the rest was the need for the shoe-mount Leica 28-24-21 finder. The finder 
is optically superb, but it's tough to frame tightly with it.</p> 
<p> =&gt; You do need a 28mm finder to see what you're getting with any 21mm 
lens on the M8. The M8 lacks a frame showing the 21mm's field of view, and it's 
more than the M8's entire viewfinder shows.</p> 
<p> In fact, with an unmodified M8 you get more than the frame-lines show with 
any focal length.</p> 
<p> The M8 makes pictures from my fiancee's Canon G10 look like cheap 
snapshots (no surprise, really). I'm also starting to prefer M8 and Leica 
primes to the 24-70mm f/2.8L on my EOS 1D mk II. Still need the 1D mk II and 
20D for 400mm and 500mm shots of wildlife.</p> 
<p> I shot personal pics of the Christmas Revels stage production with the M8 
and 35 f/2 ASPH, 50mm f/1.4, and 90mm f/2.8 Tele-Elmarit. The 90mm was tough to 
frame and use wide-open for stage shots in Oakland, California's Scottish Rite 
Temple. Also, auto WB is pretty bad, as you point out. But the pictures have 
that Leica look, and the M8 and lenses are much easier on my back.</p>

<p>IR filter use - </p> 
<p> Shoot outdoor Christmas lights with an M8 without an IR filter on the 
lens. Using auto WB, you'll get magenta-white lights instead of colored ones: 
http://tinyurl.com/9rdkml</p> 
<p> That's one of the effects of not using IR filters. I've also experienced 
flesh tones and fabric colors that were slightly off.</p>

<p>I'm always a bit curious about color balance. I understand the flexibility 
of raw and the ability to &quot;assign&quot; a color balance but I often wonder 
if the &quot;old fashioned&quot; way of actually filtering or partiallly 
filtering the lens would actually improve the image by adding back some of the 
missing color from the scene. I used to shoot a lot with Kodak's SLR/n and 
found that I could subdue the blue channel noise to a great degree by actually 
using color filters (80a, b, c) to pull the color temperature into a range that 
would not cause the camera's electronics to boost the blue channel. I know it's 
not as convenient but I wonder if the performance of all digital cameras 
wouldn't be improved with this method under incandescent light? Thoughts? 
Violent disagreement? Psuedo-Science?</p> 
<p>Mark Bohrer , January 22, 2009; 11:02 P.M. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Kirk:<br>
 You're probably right. My EE background tells me you don't want 
to get anywhere close to overloading the amplifier for any RGB channel. Your 
filter reduces the input signal enough to keep that from happening.</p> 
<p> An initial attenuation is much better than trying to reduce the signal at 
the output. A filter is less convenient up-front, but you'd spend less time in 
Photoshop later - if you have a single type of light to worry about. With 
multiple light-temperatured sources, you're going to play with it in Photoshop 
later anyway, though filtering for the one you want to dominate might help.</p>

<p>Kirk, </p> 
<p> Just ran across your article in scrolling though Leica info. and prices. 
Very well written and informative. You answered a lot of questions that had 
been floating around in the back of my mind. I had the pleasure of working with 
an M6 several years ago, and have wanted an 'M' ever since.</p> 
<p> Then, with the advent of the M8, it's been about more than I can stand to 
not place an order. Only problem is that my wife doesn't share the same 
dilemma! lol</p> 
<p> Michael</p> 
<p>Kirk Tuck , October 05, 2009; 02:41 P.M. </p> 
<p>So happy to have kept some great M glass on hand. The Leica M9 (I've only 
played with one, I didn't get on a list early enough!!!) is superb and the 
Leica we've mostly been looking for since digital took over. What a wonderful 
tool.</p> 
<p>Gautam Biswas , December 02, 2009; 03:28 A.M. </p> 
<p>Great review. You have almost made me a convert. I now need to find the 
cash. Since your review the model M8.2 has been released and the M9 announced. 
I look forward to your comments on these two models.</p> 
<p>David W. Griffin , July 27, 2011; 01:19 P.M. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Nowadays, the M8 has a slightly different role. First as the cheaper way 
into the Leica digital world at about $2500 give or take (rather than $7000 for 
the M9). Second as a dedicated IR camera. No mods needed, just replace your 
Leica IR cut filter with an actual IR filter (like the Leica IR or a very deep 
red or opaque filter). Normally you will need a tripod for this, but some shots 
can be taken handheld. The results can be quite satisfying.&nbsp;</p> <br>
