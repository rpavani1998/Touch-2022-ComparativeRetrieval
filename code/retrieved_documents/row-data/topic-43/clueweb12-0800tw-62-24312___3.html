 Last year, when Pune-based techie Ravi Sathyu uploaded his newly born son's 
pictures on Facebook, he got around 150 &quot;likes&quot;. But to his 
68-year-old mother, who has always had a caustic tongue, the photographs were 
&quot;slightly blurred&quot; and lacked &quot;character&quot;. Sathyu said she 
should meet an eye specialist. But a month later, he decided that his mother 
could be right about the &quot;monotonous&quot; part. <br>
<br>
 After 
experimenting with his wife's digital camera and consulting an artist friend 
who suggested he buy a &quot;proper camera&quot;, Sathyu walked into aNikon 
shop in Mumbai and bought a Nikon D3100, plus a few lenses, that cost around Rs 
50,000. &quot;I was also inspired by my favourite actress Priyanka Chopra [who 
features in a Nikon ad],&quot; says the 35-year-old. &quot;This time my mother 
didn't say the pictures were bad,&quot; he says. <br>
<br>
 The &quot;proper 
camera&quot; was a digital SLR, or single lens reflex, camera, which offers a 
far more accurate preview of framing compared with point-and-shoot cameras. <br>
<br>  Renowned Mumbai-based fashion photographer Ashok Salian also swears by 
DSLR cameras. Only, Salian is a &quot;loyal and exclusive&quot; user of Canon. 
&quot;Technology has made photography much easier,&quot; says Salian who has 
shot numerous Bollywood stars, including his favourite Dimple Kapadia before 
the release of Saagar in 1984. &quot;Most people acquire a DSLR camera to stay 
more creative,&quot; he says. <br>
<br>
 Salian and Sathyu are part of a 
growing tribe of Indians, professional and amateur, who are splurging on DSLR 
cameras like never before, thanks to their high disposable incomes. That makes 
India one of the world's fastest-growing markets for such cameras, at a time 
when camera sales are stagnating in the West and Japan. <br>
<br>
 Capturing 
Moments <br>
<br>
 For Japanese arch rivals Canon and Nikon, the biggest 
players in the segment, India along with China is leading the charge. Between 
them, the two companies sell almost 99% of the DSLR cameras that Indians buy. 
In a country where camera penetration is a mere 6%, the growth for DSLRs has 
been close to 100% in the past few years, saysCanon India senior vice-president 
Alok Bharadwaj. <br>
<br>
 He says in the Rs 4,500-crore Indian camera market, 
DSLR cameras account for Rs 750 crore. Another Rs 750 crore comes from selling 
interchangeable lenses and accessories. One of the biggest advantages of using 
a DSLR is that it lets the user choose from a variety of interchangeable lenses.

 The focus of the rivalry is high-end models. 
While Nikon models are in the range of Rs 32,950 to Rs 5 lakh, Canon's is a tad 
less than Nikon's. <br>
