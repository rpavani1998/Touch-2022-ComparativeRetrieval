<h2>No Full-Frame DSLR From Nikon</h2> By DSLRBlog Editors  | Published March 
3, 2006 <br>

<p>Looks like Nikon are still not interested in full-frame sensor DSLRs. In 
fact it seems they are quite happy to let Canon take the market as they think 
their cameras suffice. Check out this interview from DSLRPhotography.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In the first place, the current situation is that the picture quality of 
the DX camera can already sufficiently produce a satisfying photograph. So, 
what&rsquo;s the meaning of such a big sensor? Of course, there is also a price 
problem. We cannot put out an outrageously priced camera simply because we want 
to have better function on the camera.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
<strong>Question</strong>: But, isn&rsquo;t it true that the Canon 5D 
product is actually quite successful?</p> 
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: &ldquo;Certainly, there is a product like 5D out 
there. However, a camera is not only about the sensor, the product has to be 
considered with a combination of various elements. We have cost balance the 
various components of the camera, based on our judgement, there is no necessity 
to sell a camera with full frame sensor.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>DSLR Photography &ndash; Nikon about their full frame camera plan</p> 
<p>Is this a mistake? From a marketing point of view I think they will be seen 
as less &ldquo;pro&rdquo; while ever they do not have anything to match Canons 
5D and pro line-up. If they also concentrate on adding to the entry-level and 
see price as a big barrier (which from the interview they seem to) they will 
also further push their &ldquo;prosumer&rdquo; image.</p> 
<p>Interesting point about their sensors being developed through a partnership 
with Sony. With Sony DSLR cameras very much in development how long can this 
last? I imagine there are already moves to distance that relationship or at 
least diversify partners.</p> 
<p>Having said that it might be the feedback they get is Nikon fans are not 
pushing for full-frame. Who knows?</p>
