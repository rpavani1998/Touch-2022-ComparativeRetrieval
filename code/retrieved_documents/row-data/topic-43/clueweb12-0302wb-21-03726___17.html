<p><strong>The Nikon D7000 is one of the most talked-about cameras of the 
year. With a new 39-point AF system and 2,016 pixel RGB metering sensor, can 
the D7000 live up to the hype? What Digital Camera's Nikon D7000 review finds 
out...</strong></p>  Pros:  Fantastic AF system, excellent picture quality, 
great battery life <br>
 Cons:  A little expensive, screen could be higher 
resolution, kit lens doesn&rsquo;t show camera&rsquo;s full potential <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Since its announcement earlier this year, the Nikon D7000 has set tongues 
wagging from the word go. With brand new autofocus and metering systems this 
release is the first to see the latest 16.2MP sensor and is far from Nikon 
resting on its laurels. But just how impressive is the Nikon D7000 and can it 
set itself apart from the competition to be the ultimate camera in its class?
</p> 
<p> <br>
<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h2>Nikon D7000 review - Features</h2> 
<p>The Nikon D7000 is keen to stand apart from the older Nikon range as an 
all-new camera. Indeed, to dispel the myth of it being a D90 replacement, it's 
worth pointing out that both cameras will continue to run in the current Nikon 
range for the time being and the gap between one and the next is fairly 
considerable.</p> 
<p>The Nikon D7000 adopts a new 16.2-megapixel CMOS sensor, suggesting that 
the megapixel count for DSLR cameras is clearly still on the rise. The APS-C 
size of the sensor means the usual 1.5x magnification applies (i.e. 18mm is the 
same as 27mm in a full-frame 35mm equivalent). Paired up with the Expeed 2 
image processing engine, the D7000 also boasts Nikon's latest hardware for 
speedy processing and the capability to expand the already well-specified ISO 
100-6400 sensitivity to a top-end Hi2 setting - the equivalent of ISO 25,600.
</p> 
<p>For those looking to reel off bursts of images in continuous shooting mode, 
the D7000 offers a pleasing 6fps. Considered in the context against the Nikon 
D300s's 7fps, and side by side to the Canon 60D's 5.3fps, this is a 
well-specified offering that will prove tempting to those enthusiasts looking 
for speed as well as resolution and all-round capability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It's not just still images where the Nikon D7000 comes well equipped 
either: the ability to capture Full HD 1080p video at 24 frames per second sees 
off much of the competition thanks to its progressive capture.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere there's an all-new 2,016 pixel RGB metering module and a brand 
new 39-point AF system with nine cross-type sensors, dubbed the Multi-CAM 
4800DX.</p> 
<p>The rear of the camera has a fixed 3in, 920k-dot LCD screen and a 
viewfinder sat above this gives a full 100% field-of-view to ensure that 
exactly what you frame by eye is what you capture.</p> 
<p>To store your images there are twin SD card slots that can be utilised 
simultaneously or user-defined to operate in an overflow or stills/video 
format. It's interesting to see the omission of a CF card slot, which seems to 
now be exclusively reserved for more pro-grade models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, it's a phenomenal camera, in my opinion priced lower than what you'd 
expect.</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>November 23 06:41</h4> 
<h4>L Miles</h4> <br>

<p>I'll go with nearly everything you said, I cant say I have had much problem 
with the metering although it may just be I have not shot in the same 
conditions as yourself but should it arise I am sure a little bit of practice 
to recognise the conditions and compensate will be no problem. The User 1&amp;2 
settings are a real bonus compared to my old D200 as is the rear as well as 
front remote IR sensor, great for tripod/macro work specially when the double 
action mirror up then shoot setting is selected. I bought just the body as I 
have always been dubious about kit bundles &amp; not ever using the 105 zoom 
looks like a wise move on my part. My standard lens is the good old 50mm 1.8 
that on the D7000 produces razor sharp images even at 200% crop I am well 
pleased with this camera and think I made a good choice in buying despite as 
many believe to be a slightly high price its still one heck of a good camera.

<p>&quot;The D7000 uses Linear PCM (essentially the carrier format as found in 
Compact Disc audio), with a 16bit stereo, 48000Hz sample rate.&quot; Where you 
got this information?! D7000 pick mono sound, less than 48 kHz. Second moment. 
24 Megabits = 24 Mbps not MBps, as you wrote. MB = Megabyte; Mb = Megabits.</p> 
<br> <br>

<p>Re: the audio data. It's pulled from analysing the file straight from 
camera. (And the Mbps (bits) vs MBps (bytes) typo is now corrected.)</p> <br>

<p>These new Nikons are rather tempting</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Your test feels like a quick and superficial review. I used the D7000 for 
10 days solid, over 2000 frames, in a mix of urban, landscape, and wildlife 
settings, which revealed a different side to the camera. The AF system is 
easily confused in still mode, and generally poor in video mode. Why didn't you 
mention the sound of the lens focus mechanism which blights any video 
recording? Why also no mention of the lack of a manual switch to change 
metering mode? Selling the D7000 as a kit with the 18-105 is a stupid mistake 
by Nikon. It doesn't let the camera perform anywhere near as well as it should. 
Overall, the D7000 was released too early and needs a firmware upgrade to AF, 
metering and video sound.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>&quot;Why didn't you mention the sound of the lens focus mechanism which 
blights any video recording?&quot; - depends which lens you're using... 
&quot;Selling the D7000 as a kit with the 18-105 is a stupid mistake by Nikon. 
It doesn't let the camera perform anywhere near as well as it should.&quot; - 
it's sold as so in the interests of cost. However, this test does point out 
that the lens is a let down.</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>January 05 18:03</h4> 
<h4>SHR</h4> <br>

<p>The poor AF on video doesn't depend much on the lens. Used it with 50, 
70-200, 300. All were poor. It's terrible for a &pound;1100 camera. And Nikon 
hasn't made enough kits with the 18-200 available, which might make it a better 
performer. It's still a disappointing camera given what Nikon could have done 
for the price. Your test wasn't as thorough as a magazine of your reputation 
merits.</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>January 18 16:15</h4>

<p>I tried a D7000 for video. I couldn't find 1080P 25fps as an option in the 
menu. There seems to be no way of adjusting the apeture when in video 
(&quot;live view&quot;) mode, even if the camera's in MANUAL mode. And there 
didn't seem to be an easy way of metering when in video mode.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The D7000 is absolutely the best APS-C DSLR, and the 18-105mm kit lens is a 
joy to use. It is sharper than the popular 18-200mm lens and much cheaper! I 
can buy the superb 35mm/F1.8 lens with the money saved and with plenty of cash 
left! The D7000 + the kit lens and the 35mm lens is a killer system without 
breaking the bank.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>I bought the Nikon D7000 a few days ago but got it with the Nikon 18-200mm 
VR2 lens .. The 18-105 lens has a plastic connection to the camera so that was 
a no-no. Keep in mind that Nikon still allows you a worldwide guarantee on 
their lenses so u can shop for a 18-200 vr2 on ebay from america for &pound;435 
etc. The camera is tremendous. Stuff the video. I cant believe people are 
actually bothered about video on a camera like that. Its like buying a ferrari 
and then crying because you can beat Michael Schumacher in his Ferrari. Anyone 
who buys this camera for videos was clearly born in a test tube and related to 
the Wombles .....</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>February 11 20:27</h4>

<p>Here is another useful idea to anyone who thinks that Nikon are having a 
laugh charging &pound;230 for a battery grip. I ordered the battery grip for 
the Nikon D90 for &pound;24.45 and cut off the plastic connector that goes 
inside the battery compartment on the D90 and filed it down to about 3mm and 
filed the other end flat were it curved up and attached a rubber gasket between 
the grip and the camera. You need to remove the battery door on the D7000 which 
is done by opening it to about 30 degrees and wiggling it off. The 3mm of base 
height and the connecting screw which goes into the base of the D7000 secures 
it fine and the rubber protects the camera and forms additional grip. For now i 
have the looks of the proper grip for less than &pound;25 and when copies are 
made in a few months i will buy one so all the features on the grip work with 
the camera. It D7000 looks great right now and i have that essential extra grip 
for little or no money. Hooray to that. There wouldnt be an issue if Nikon were 
half decent and charged &pound;50 for it. &pound;230 is daylight robbery.</p>

<p>I Have had my D7000 since November so I feel I can write with some 
knowledge of this camera. All I can say its a cracker, all the twaddle I have 
read running it down seems to come from people who have not A. given themselves 
time to learn exactly how to get the best from it or B. people who cut and 
paste from comments in catagory A. This is a great little DSLR used right with 
a decent lens it produces well exposed pin sharp images. The AF is super fast 
running with the 18-200 VR you can go from camera off to picture taken in just 
over a second. Get the colour balance set up right and you can produce images 
that are very close to that fabulous (and sadly gone) Kodachrome with slightly 
muted colours and wonderful subtle tones. Set the cameras image control to 
vivid and Fujichromes hard greens &amp; reds springs out at you. Hot pixels? 
Hog wash, look at the pictures dont go hunt the spot, I'll print 10 16X20's and 
I bet you wont be able to point out one hot pix. Pricey? for a crop sensor DSLR 
yes, but Its one hell of a good camera, I should know I have had one long 
enough to get to know it properly, not a quick one of two day play around and 
after best part of 40 years shooting pictures with every thing from a MINNOX B 
to a RB67 to a Canon 1D I reakon I know a duffer when I see one.The D7000 can 
produce Exhbition quality images, what it cant do is compose the picture and I 
suspect some purchasers thought their snaps would somehow change into great 
compositions just by buying a new camera &amp; when it didnt they got upset. If 
you get one remember it takes some time to really know these cameras very 
comprehensive control system and how to get the best from them. A bit of 
patients and you will get great results stick it on auto and it will be just 
another DSLR, decent enough images but way below the real abilities of these 
great lttle cameras.</p> <br>

<p>@Lee Miles I like your comment nice one. I have a question do you think the 
D7000 is better than the D3 Ash</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>August 18 19:36</h4> 
<h4>Lee Miles</h4> <br>

<p>Hi Ashley I have not used the D3 so I am not really the right person to ask 
but to my mind the D3 is a professional camera and the D7000 is a top end 
amateur. Most professional gear I have tried is built to take a bashing but you 
have to pay for that build quality and of course the D3 is a full frame 
Although now a bit long in the tooth if I was a professional between the 2 I 
would go for the D3 as I would need that reliability, but having said that I 
have noticed a number of pro Nikon users are starting to carry the D7000 as a 
backup or snatch shot camera . And having looked carefully at the results from 
both cameras the difference is not much. I would say the D3 with the same lens 
is a tad crisper due to the full frame sensor but in low light the D7000 is 
almost identical &amp; on a gallery wall unless they are side by side at A3+ 
the difference takes enough working out to make (IMO) the D7000 a good choice 
up to serious club or exhibition level</p> <br>
<br>

<p>I've had a D7000 for about a year. Great camera, intuitive menu and 
controls. This camera does overexpose in bright conditions. I usually dial in 
exposure compensation. In addition, Nikon are stingy with their firmware 
updates. They should give it a 5 shot HDR capability and the ability to shoot 
HD video at 30fps. Otherwise, it's a good camera.</p> <br>
<br>

<h4>December 28 10:42</h4> 
<h4>Harold Williams Rogers</h4> <br>

<p>I have had a D7000 for a few months now for a replacement to the D80, it 
was expensive, but it is worth every penny, they have really thought of 
everything, even being able to take stadard AI lenses and still give auto 
exposure, so all my old Nikon and Tamron AI lenses work great, so I tend to use 
my old Nikor 1.4 50mm lens for fantastic image quality, I canr really fault 
this camera</p> <br>

<h4>james hamilton-bird</h4> <br>

<p>I bought one after reading the reviews of a great Nikon that's new on the 
block. being a Nikon user since my F2 in 1960 I am biased because in all those 
years not once was I let down. Going to test it with the ED 700-300 mm in 10 
shots or captures if you prefer I got 2 publications in the press. I have found 
that it could have been a fraction bigger but if you have not been used to a 
larger Camera it would not be a problem. I resolved this by adding a battery 
grip The Sensor is quite advanced at the price. I see Nikon do not put it in 
their Pro camera group but I also see a few pros adding it to their bags as a 
second or third body as I have. No camera is perfect but to date I have yet to 
find anything that has made me regret it's purchase the D700 stays at home it's 
that good for samples go to www.flickr.com/photos/birdseyeviewphotos look at 
the Swan pics.</p> <br>
