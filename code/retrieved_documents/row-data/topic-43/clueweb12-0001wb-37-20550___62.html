<h3>O'Reilly Focuses On Digital Asset Management</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Sebastopol, CA Every time you shoot, scan, or store a photograph, you are 
involved with DAM or digital asset management, which includes every part of the 
process that follows the taking of the picture through final output and 
permanent storage. However, most photographers, whether amateurs capturing a 
vacation, or professionals earning a living, don't really know the best way to 
systematically and efficiently manage workflow for their photography.</p> 
<p>A professional photographer for twenty years, author Peter Krogh explains 
the whole DAM system in &quot;The DAM Book: Digital Asset Management for 
Photographers&quot; (O'Reilly, US $34.95). He cuts the often overwhelming task 
of managing digital photos down to manageable size with a solid plan, practical 
advice, and a workable system for filing, finding, protecting, and re-using 
photographs.</p> 
<p>Having contributed to the development and testing of Adobe Photoshop CS2, 
Adobe Bridge, and the DNG Raw format, Krogh is uniquely suited to guide you 
through their use. He designed the book &quot;for anyone who is serious about 
his or her photographs,&quot; promising that, &quot;once you understand the 
concepts that are described here, working with your digital photographs will be 
simpler, more straightforward, and more secure than you can probably imagine 
now.&quot; Adobe Systems Senior Creative Director Russell Preston Brown agrees, 
saying, &quot;When I want to look good in front of a demanding crowd of 
photographers, I never hesitate to steal from this book. Peter Krogh definitely 
knows what he's talking about.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The DAM Book,&quot; produced in full color, will show you how to:<br>

 *Transition to new, more efficient ways of archiving images *Understand the 
best methods for filing and storing information, so you can easily and quickly 
find what you need<br>
 *Apply metadata and choose useful keywords<br>
 *Set up 
a system that will evolve and grow with your needs and technological innovations
<br> *Configure the hardware needed for a stable digital archive<br>
 *Protect 
yourself against the accidental loss of your images and enable full recovery 
should a drive failure occur<br>
 *Leverage AdobePhotoshop CS2 with Adobe 
Bridge navigational software to improve your workflow<br>
 *Integrate Bridge, 
Camera Raw, and Digital Asset Management software<br>
 *Use cataloguing 
software to organize your images<br>
 *Keep track of multiple versions of your 
images and find the best one quickly<br>
 *Migrate your existing archive into 
your new DAM system<br>
 *Import your film images into your digital archive</p> 
<p>Part of O'Reilly's Digital Studio series, &quot;The DAM Book&quot; will cut 
down on the time you spend searching your hard drive and file cabinet for a 
particular image. With the DAM system, you'll be able to assign and track the 
data content on your photos. And, if you're a professional, the DAM system will 
assure that your images bear your copyright and contact information, so there 
will be no more photos circulating in the marketplace unprotected. Professional 
or dedicated amateurs alike, will wonder how they survived without it.</p> 
<p><strong>O'Reilly's Digital Media Resources</strong><br>
 The world of 
digital media continues to expand with possibilities. Digital technology is 
becoming more accessible and is sparking creativity in a broader audience. 
Digital media artists, from the hobbyist or pro photographer to the graphics

<p>POWAY, Calif. (BUSINESS WIRE) Nov. 21, 2005 Two local companies 
specializing in photography gear, George's Camera &amp; Video Exchange (
http://www.georgescamera.com) and Delkin Devices, Inc. (www.delkin.com), are 
co-sponsoring the San Diego Photo Expo (http://www.sdphotoexpo.com) Saturday 
and Sunday, December 3rd and the 4th, at the Del Mar Fairgrounds' Mission 
Tower. Admission is free. This exciting new event brings free seminars on 
topics of interest for digital photography newcomers to seasoned professionals 
from the industry's top professionals. There are sensational savings for photo 
enthusiasts, and those who shop for them, on digital camera gear and no sales 
tax. Experts from Canon, Konica-Minolta, Nikon and more will be on hand to 
answer any questions. There will also be free raffles for attendees for camera 
and photography equipment and free photos with Santa for the kids, too! The San 
Diego Photo Expo will be the place to find great holiday gifts for all photo 
buffs. Finally, the first 200 people through the door each day will receive a 
free DVD on the basics of digital photography.</p> 
<p>George's Camera &amp; Video Exchange owner and operator David Rivera said, 
&quot;San Diego County's growing digital photographer population has clamored 
for a Photo Expo for years. Photo shows have thrived for decades in other parts 
of the USA, and it's high time someone produced one here. Now George's and our 
co-sponsor, local digital camera accessory manufacturer Delkin Devices, have 
committed to bringing San Diego more than just great deals on the best in 
digital photography equipment. The first annual San Diego Photo expo will be a 
full-blown digital photography festival, with attractions for everyone.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Internationally recognized photographers such as Monte Zucker, Gil Smith 
and Bambi Cantrell will share their professional and artistic expertise at the 
free lectures and workshops. Topics will range from wedding to portrait 
photography as well as basic digital photography. There will be seminars from 
the producer of the popular Jumpstart Guides that will get the newcomer 
started. World renowned Photoshop expert Eddie Tapp will demonstrate how 
software can help even the newest digital photographer produce work like the 
pros.</p> 
<p>Canon, Nikon, Konica-Minolta, Tamron, Nik Multimedia, Quantum, Wescott, 
Photogenic, Delkin and more will be represented with a full range of products, 
special prices, and factory experts on hand to answer questions. There will be 
a wide range of cameras and other photographic equipment for sale at great 
prices along with no sales tax on most items.</p> 
<p>There is a free raffle for all attendees for a digital SLR camera, memory 
cards, lenses, and more. The top prize is Nikon's hot new D50 Digital SLR 
camera with an 18-55 mm lens valued at $1100.00. Other Photo Expo prizes 
include Delkin's best selling DVD BurnAway and eFilm Pro memory cards, other 
photography equipment and gift certificates to George's Camera. The San Diego 
Photo Expo also welcomes the kids to the event with a free 4 x 6 picture with 
Santa.</p> 
<p>George's Camera and Delkin Devices have been serving San Diego for decades; 
George's since 1965 and Delkin since 1985. They are tapping all the expertise, 
contacts and resources they've accumulated and are pulling out all the stops to 
ensure the San Diego Photo Expo is fully comparable to those held anywhere, 
including Los Angeles and New York City. Already the Expo is set to offer far 
more photography value than San Diego has ever seen before, with so much going 
on, no single camera store can hold it all.</p> 
<p>The San Diego Photo Expo's huge selection of cameras and must-have 
accessories with eye-popping prices are enticing enough. The Expo's decision to

<h3>Lexar LockTight Security for the Nikon D200</h3> 
<p><strong>FREMONT</strong>, Ca., November 21, 2005 Lexar Media, Inc. (Nasdaq: 
LEXR), a world leader in advanced digital media technologies today announced 
that its LockTight(TM) technology will be supported in the Nikon D200 creating 
an ideal solution for photographers who want to fully utilize the advanced 
feature set in this new camera, including security functionality and burst mode 
shooting. Lexar Professional LockTight CompactFlash is a unique security 
technology that allows photographers and organizations to control access to 
information stored on the user&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&#132;&cent;s memory cards. 
Following full support in the Nikon D2X and D2Hs digital SLR cameras, the new 
Nikon D200 is the most affordable digital camera that includes built-in 
LockTight functionality.</p> 
<p>&quot;Security and controlling access to digital images continues to be a 
critical feature for vertical markets such as law enforcement, insurance, 
medicine or government. With LockTight, Lexar is offering a unique secure 
digital imaging solution for these markets,&quot; said John Omvik, director of 
professional product marketing, Lexar.<br>
 &quot;With the introduction of the 
D200, photographers and organizations in these markets now have three different 
Nikon cameras to choose from with varying feature sets and price points,&quot; 
he added.</p> 
<p>Beyond security, the Lexar Professional CompactFlash with LockTight 
delivers a minimum sustained write speed capability of 80X, enough to take 
advantage of the D200&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&#132;&cent;s burst mode of 5 frames 
per second, without delays in writing the data to the memory card (Lexar 
defines &quot;X&quot; within its speed-rating system as equivalent to a minimum 
write speed capability of 150 kilobytes per second). Any Lexar Professional 
CompactFlash card used with a Nikon D200 digital SLR camera is the ideal 
combination for shooting at weddings, sporting events or any venue where 
missing the perfect image is not an option.<br>
 &quot;The comprehensive 
feature set of the D200&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;including the unique LockTight 
compatibility and functionality&acirc;&euro;&ldquo;will appeal to many 
professionals around the world,&quot; said Kazuyuki Kazami, General Manager of 
Marketing, Nikon Corporation. &quot;Among the D200's target customer base are 
organizations that have a real need to protect their content, demonstrate a 
chain of evidence and restrict access to confidential or sensitive image data. 
Lexar&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&#132;&cent;s LockTight system offers us a unique way 
to address these requirements from our vertical market customers,&quot; he 
added.</p> 
<p><strong>How LockTight Works</strong><br>
 The combination of Lexar 
Professional CompactFlash with LockTight and 
Lexar&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&#132;&cent;s custom LockTight software creates a 
security solution ideal for photographers in fields such as forensic 
photography, scientific research, military and law enforcement. When used in 
conjunction with a camera that supports the LockTight system, access to the 
digital content stored on a LockTight card is restricted to authorized users 
and authorized cameras through card level, 160 bit authentication. Once the 
card has been registered to users and cameras, it will only work in those 
specific cameras and can only be accessed on a PC or MAC by those users with 
the login information established by the system administrator. A Lexar 
Professional CompactFlash Reader completes the security solution, as only the 
user&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&#132;&cent;s registered cameras and Professional 
CompactFlash Readers can recognize a secured LockTight card. LockTight cards 
that are not secured operate as normal cards.</p> 
<p>When used in conjunction with a camera that supports the LockTight system, 
LockTight CompactFlash employs a unique strategy to protect data, and, as a 
result, LockTight cards are always &quot;locked.&quot; A computer or camera 
cannot read or write data to/from a LockTight card until a critical 
authorization process takes place between the LockTight card and the host 
computer or host camera. This authorization process is where the 160-bit HMAC 
SHA-1 hash algorithm is employed.</p> 
<p>Lexar Professional LockTight CompactFlash cards are currently available at 
photo-specialty stores and through key market value added resellers in 
capacities of 512MB and 2GB. More information on 
Lexar&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&#132;&cent;s professional products can be found at

<h3>PMA supports CIPA counterfeit battery pack awareness initiative</h3> 
<p>PMA, Jackson, Mich., USA, announces support for a counterfeit lithium-ion 
battery pack awareness and warning initiative led by the Camera &amp; Imaging 
Products Association (CIPA), Tokyo, Japan. CIPA is an international association 
founded in 2002 to address problems related to digital and film cameras and

<h3>Intemos Launches DigiCamClean</h3> 
<p>8th November 2005 - Intemos, the same company that make DSLRClean, the 
revolutionary Digital SLR Sensor cleaning kit, have launched DigiCamClean - the 
only cleaning system specifically designed to clean small lenses such as those 
found in mobile phone cameras and digicams.</p> 
<p>DigiCamClean can be used to clean small lenses, viewfinders and any other 
small or hard to access optical surface.</p> 
<p>&quot;It started with a discussion with mobile phone camera users,&quot; 
said Intemos managing director Andrew Stagg.</p> 
<p>&quot;Users were finding that the lenses get dirty in pockets and bags and 
I even know people who have changed their mobile just to get a clean lens. It 
is a problem that I am also familiar with from my experience with compact 
cameras. Now, with DigiCamClean there is an effective way to clean even the 
tiniest lens.&quot;</p> 
<p>Developed utilising the same successful technology used in DSLRClean, the 
new DigiCamClean sticks use micropores to gently lift the dust off the surface 
of the lens. Simply sweep the tip across the surface and you instantly have a 
clean lens.</p> 
<p>DigiCamClean sticks are available in packs of 5 (price GBP6.95 USD11.95) or 
10 (price GBP8.95 USD15.95) fromhttp://www.intemos.com </p>

<h3>Zigview-R Introduced</h3> 
<p>Seculine's ZIGVIEW-R - the world's first TTL Motion Sensor shutter release, 
Interval &amp; Exposure Timer, based on the original Zigview Digital Angle 
Finder.</p> 
<p>Building on the success of Seculine's Zigview Digital Angle Finder, the 
Zigview R incorporates a host of new features including a motion sensor 
trigger, a sophisticated interval timer and a Bulb exposure controller making 
it the ideal accessory for wildlife, nature and macro photography or any 
situation where a covert or accurately timed approach is required.</p> 
<p>Simply attach the Zigview-R digital angle finder to the viewfinder of your 
camera, frame the subject area as required on the TFT colour display and input 
the required shutter trigger settings using the on screen menu's.</p> 
<p>The motion sensor fires the shutter when movement is detected based on 
brightness levels in 9 areas of the viewfinder image. This innovative design 
allows the sensor area to be over any distance and with any area of view 
including the most extreme telephoto and wideangle lenses, with the sensitivity 
of each trigger being variable to allow movement in parts of the field of view.
</p> 
<p>Zigview-R's interval timing facility can be set to fire the shutter over a 
period of up to 999 days with exposure intervals of between 1/2 second to 99 
days allowing huge variations of possibilities. This can be combined, if 
required, with its timed &quot;BULB&quot; feature which can be accurately set 
over a wide range enabling photographers to repeatedly control long exposures.
</p> 
<p>Both the Motion Sensing and Interval facilities can be started at the push 
of a button, on a countdown timer or at a specific time and date with almost 
limitless shutter applications.</p> 
<p>The Zigview-R can also be used as a Digital Angle Finder to display the 
image captured by its CMOS sensor through the viewfinder on the 2 inch TFT 
colour display. This is particularly useful when composing images in high &amp; 
low angle situations where it is awkward or impossible to see through the 
viewfinder.</p> 
<p>ZIGVIEW-R will work with most digital and film SLR cameras which have an 
electronic shutter release socket. It is supplied with an eyepiece adapter for 
common Nikon and Canon cameras and a 2.5mm shutter release connector. Other 
eyepeice and camera connectors are available as accessories.</p> 
<p>The Seculine ZIGVIEW-R will be available from Photographic retailers from 
the end of November with a suggested retail price of GBP199.99 inc Vat.</p> 
<p>For further details please visit http://www.intro2020.co.uk and visit the

<h3>Olympus follows KM Slump</h3> 
<p>In the wake of Konica-Minolta's loss reports, Olympus has indicated that 
profits fell 68 percent from the previous year in the first half of 2005. 
Revenue was helped somewhat by strong sales in medical equipment, but Olympus' 
workforce did not escape unscathed; 4,000 jobs will be cut. Overall, the 
company's management has acknowledged that market saturation has made the

<h3>Firmware Upgrade for D2X, D2Hs Cameras</h3> 
<p>Nikon appears to be rolling out the first firmware upgrade for its D2X and 
D2Hs digital SLR cameras.Nikon Asia's website now offers a Mac and Windows 
updater for firmware version 1.01 for both of these professional cameras. The A 
and B camera firmware are both updated, and installing both modules is required 
for proper camera functionality. According to Nikon's Asian website, the 
firmware upgrade addresses the following:<br>
</p> 
<p> -Autofocus performance has been increased.<br>
 (Note: some of our readers 
are reportingvastly improved AF ability with their recently upgraded D2X cameras
)</p> 
<p>-An issue that prevented the AF-assist illuminator from firing when the 
Speedlights listed below were used has been corrected.<br>
 SB-29S, SB-29, 
SB-23, SB-22S, SB-22, SB-20.</p> 
<p>-In images captured at a shutter speed of 1/250 s with a Speedlight SB-800, 
set to Distance-priority manual flash (GN), or Manual flash (M) with flash 
output set to full (M1/1) mounted on the camera, the top portion was often 
dark. This issue has been addressed. However, under the circumstances described 
above only, the guide number is reduced from that of full flash output level by 
approximately 0.6 EV.</p> 
<p>-Images captured at white-balance settings of Incandescent, Direct 
sunlight, Cloudy, Shade, and Choose color temp. tended to have a reddish tint. 
This issue has been addressed.</p> 
<p>-Errors in Dutch menus have been corrected.</p> 
<p>The firmware updates can be downloaded from Nikon Asia's website. 
Currently, neither Nikon Europe nor Nikon USA list these upgrades as available.
<br> In order to perform the upgrade, you will need a USB cable or memory card 
reader, a Compact Flash card (Microdrives are NOT supported), the AC adapter 
for your camera (or a fully-charged EN-EL4 battery), and the camera<em>Guide to 
Digital Photography</em>.</p> 
<p><strong>Links to downloads:</strong><br>
 D2X firmware update 1.01: (
Macintosh) (Windows)<br>
 D2Hs firmware update 1.01: (Macintosh) (Windows)</p> 
Update: As of 10:30am EST today, the updates are available from Nikon USA'ssite.

<h3>Nikon Bullish On Profits</h3> 
<p>Nov.7 - Fresh from the momentum of the D200 announcement, Nikon announced 
today that they were revising their profit gains for the first half of 2005, 
citing cost cuts in stepper equipment manufacture and sales of digital cameras. 
Also, a more bullish forecast on year-end profit was made. Nikon's current 
first-half profit reached 320B Yen, beating estimates by about 7 percent. 
Aeveral stock analyst groups see an even larger opportunity for year-end profit 
despite Nikon's &quot;overweight&quot; rating.</p>

<h3>Konica-Minolta To Cut Photo Imaging Business</h3> 
<p>Kyodo - Nov. 4th 2005 - Konica-Minolta Holdings Inc. indicated that it will 
heavily cut it's photography imaging business, including it's burgeoning 
digital camera arm.</p> 
<p>Citing strong pressure from both domestic saturation and stiff competition, 
KM will cut ten percent of it's workforce; a figure of approximately 3,000 
jobs. KM's earlier intentions were to focus it's business on developing and 
marketing digital SLR cameras, which is acknowledged to be the profit segment 
in the digicam business. That turnaround plan was estimated at the time to cost 
about USD 287 Million (34B Yen) over four years. Revised figures now put that 
plan at about USD 760 Million (90B Yen) for just fiscal year 2005 alone. 
Konica-Minolta now has revised it's year-end profitability; citing a loss of 
about USD 397 Million (47B Yen) by March of 2006. No dividends are expected to 
be paid out.</p>

<h3>Nikon Announces New Wireless Macro Flash System</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>Nikon has announced, along with its new D200 DSLR and 18-200 VR lens, a 
macro speedlight system for iTTL compatible SLRs, including the D2 series, D70, 
and D200. The macro speedlights can be purchased in either of two 
configurations or as separate components. The R1 system contains two wireless 
macro speedlights, adapter rings (52, 62, 67,72, and 77mm) and a set of gels 
and diffusers. The R1 system is triggered by Nikon DSLR's with built-in iTTL 
commander speedlights, or a SB-800 in commander mode.<br>
</p> 
<p>More information from Nikon USA:</p> 
<p>The R1C1 system also has two wireless speedlights, but it includes a 
wireless commmander module (SU-800) that can be used on the camera's hotshoe to 
control up to three groups of speedlights, including SB-800 and SB-600 iTTL 
speedlights. According to Nikon, all the components of this new wireless 
speedlight system will be sold individually as well, allowing photographers to 
connect up to EIGHT macro speedlights onto the ring adapter simultaneously.</p> 
<p>The R1C1 and the R1 systems greatly enhance the versatility of Nikon's 
Creative Lighting System, currently consisting of the SB-800 and SB-600 
Speedlights. They offer photographers a myriad of choices and options in 
creating customized lighting solutions, ranging from a compact, portable 
lighting set-up for close-up photography to more elaborate lighting 
arrangements using several i-TTL enabled speedlights. Regardless of the 
complexity of the lighting arrangements, Nikon's i-TTL technology promises an 
astounding level of simplicity in achieving the desired lighting effects and 
accurate exposures. Photographers can shed all cords and cables and the need to 
calculate flash and distance ratios, because, when used with a compatible Nikon 
camera, i-TTL technology is capable of making all exposure calculations in real 
time, wirelessly, during the exposure to deliver consistently accurate flash 
exposures in virtually any situation.</p> 
<p>Packaged as complete systems, the R1C1 and the R1 Wireless Close-Up 
Speedlight Systems are designed to produce automated creative close-up lighting 
solutions without any clutter or hassle of connecting cables. The system 
outfits come in a sturdy and fitted system case that includes all the 
accessories and adapters a photographer may need to begin capturing beautifully 
illuminated pictures immediately.<br>
<br>
 The R1C1 consists of two SB-R200 
Wireless Remote Speedlights, the SU-800 Wireless Speedlight Commander, and an 
SX-1 Attachment Ring that is used to attach the two SB-R200s to the front of 
the lens. Additionally, the outfit contains a comprehensive assortment of 
accessories to help users master and enjoy close-up flash photography, 
including the SW-11 Extreme Close-Up Positioning Adapter, SJ-R200 Color Filter 
Set, SW-12 Set Diffuser, SW-C1 Flexible Arm Clip and a set of five adapter 
rings to ensure the SX-1 Attachment Ring can be mounted on virtually any 
Nikkor(TM) lenses designed for close range photography.</p> 
<p>For photographers who want to use an SB-800 or the built-in Speedlight of 
D200, D70s and D70 cameras as a commander, the R1 Wireless Close-Up Speedlight 
System, which comes without the SU-800, is ideal.</p> 
<p>Components of the R1C1 and R1 Wireless Close-Up Speedlight Systems are also 
available individually, offering photographers versatility and creative 
control. The SB-R200 Speedlight is a highly capable lighting tool with a guide 
number of 14/46 (ISO 200, m/ft.). In addition to attaching it to the front of 
the lens for close-up photography purposes, photographers can also hold it in 
their hand while shooting for off-camera directional lighting, or freely 
position it by using the AS-20 Speedlight Stands, supplied with both the R1C1 
and R1 systems. The SU-800 Wireless Speedlight Commander, also available 
individually, adds versatility to the Nikon Creative Lighting System by 
providing wireless flash output level controls for<br>
 the SB-800, SB-600 or 
new SB-R200 remote Speedlight units when mounted on Nikon SLR cameras that are 
compatible with Nikon's Creative Lighting System. These include the D2X, D2Hs, 
D2H, D200, D70s, D70 and D50(TM) digital SLR cameras, as well as the F6 35mm 
film SLR camera.</p> 
<p>The Nikon R1C1 and R1 Wireless Close-Up Speedlight Systems will be 
available in December 2005 for an estimated selling price of $680.00* and 
$430.00* respectively. The Nikon SU-800 Wireless Speedlight Commander and 
SB-R200 Wireless Remote Speedlights will also be available individually in 
December 2005 for an estimated selling price of $265.00* and $155.00*

shutter speed! It also features the Active and Normal VR modes that was 
introduced with the 70-200/2.8 VR.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>NIKON(R) ADDS VERSATILE NEW 18-200MM F/3.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S DX VR 
ZOOM-NIKKOR LENS TO ITS DX NIKKOR LINE OF LENSES<br>
<em><br>
 New Lens Offers 
Enhanced VR Vibration Reduction System in a Compact and Lightweight 11.1x High 
Power Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLRs</em></p> 
<p>MELVILLE, NY, NOVEMBER 1, 2005 Nikon Inc. (www.nikonusa.com) today 
introduced the new 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor lens, a 
compact, lightweight 11.1x zoom lens that is ideal for high performance 
everyday photography and incorporates advanced features such as Nikon's Extra 
Low Dispersion (ED) glass, Silent Wave Motor technology (SWM) and Enhanced 
Vibration Reduction (VR II), in a DX-Nikkor design engineered exclusively for 
use with Nikon DX format digital SLR cameras. With a remarkable 18-200mm focal 
length range (picture angle equivalent to a 27-300mm lens in 35mm format), the 
lens conveniently covers everything from wide landscapes to tight portraits and 
action photography. Advanced Nikon engineering has lent the lens a compact 
lightweight design that offers excellent handling characteristics and superb 
optical quality.<br>
 &quot;Nikon's range of DX Nikkor lenses, designed 
specifically for Nikon digital SLR cameras, has grown substantially since the 
introduction of the category, and the new 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S DX VR 
Zoom-Nikkor lens is an excellent addition offering Nikon digital SLR 
photographers an advanced all-purpose lens with superb optical performance and 
Enhanced Vibration Reduction capabilities,&quot; said Edward Fasano, general 
manager for Marketing, SLR Systems Products, at Nikon Inc. &quot;Nikkor lenses 
are famous for their breathtaking sharpness, optimal contrast and consistent 
color rendition across its range of lenses with varying focal lengths. Now with 
the 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor, Nikon photographers will 
be able to take advantage of remarkable versatility in one lens with assurance 
of the outstanding Nikkor image performance that has made Nikkor lenses 
renowned worldwide.&quot;<br>
 Beyond the lens' incredible optical versatility 
is the benefit of Enhanced VR II Vibration Reduction an innovation that makes 
it possible to take substantially sharper handheld pictures at slower shutter 
speeds than would otherwise be possible. This provides the distinct advantage 
of being able to shoot more effectively in a much broader variety of 
challenging conditions. With the new Nikon VR II advantage, users can take 
pictures at shutter speeds as many as 4 stops slower* than they ordinarily 
could shoot without the image degrading blur associated with camera shake at 
slow shutter speeds. Nikon's VR technology further enhances picture taking 
potential with a choice of two modes to match most shooting conditions. VR 
Normal Mode primarily compensates for camera shake, and includes automatic 
panning detection, as well as automatic tripod detection. VR Active Mode 
effectively compensates for vibration in situations where it is more pronounced 
and more frequent, such as when shooting from a moving vehicle.<br>
 To further 
ensure outstanding optical performance, the 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S DX 
VR Zoom-Nikkor features two Extra-Low Dispersion (ED) glass elements and three 
complex aspherical lens elements that provide for higher resolution, 
high-contrast images while minimizing chromatic aberration, astigmatism and 
other forms of distortion. The lens also features Nikon's compact Silent Wave 
Motor technology (SWM), which combines fast and precise autofocusing with 
super-quiet operation, as well as Internal Focusing (IF) construction that 
allows the lens to focus without changing its external size, improving balance 
and handling chrematistics.<br>
 All of Nikon's DX Nikkor lenses are engineered 
exclusively for use with Nikon DX format digital SLR cameras, making the lens 
smaller and lighter while providing exceptional center-to-edge-to-corner image 
quality and overall optical performance. With the addition of the 18-200mm 
f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor lens, Nikon photographers can choose 
from over 50 Nikkor lenses,<br>
 ranging from the amazing 10.5mm f/2.8G ED AF 
DX Fisheye to the astounding 600mm f/4D ED-IF AF-S II super Telephoto.<br>
 The 
18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor lens will be available 
beginning in December 2005 for an estimated selling price of $699.95**. For

<h3>Nikon Unveils the D200</h3> 
<p>Nikon has finally revealed the long-awaited successor to it's popular D100 
camera. The existence of the D200 had been long suspected, and this month's 
series of leaks gave everyone glimpses of what was to come. Along with the much 
awaited 10.2 MP camera, Nikon has also announced a new 18-200mm VR zoom lens 
and new macro and wireless commander flash systems. The new camera will retail 
for USD1699 and will be available in late December. As always, Nikonians was 
one of the first sites to host a dedicated D200forum earlier this year. Now 
that the specifications are revealed, be sure to come and join the discussions!
</p> 
<p></p>

 * Multiple exposure 
enables up to 10 separate images to be used to create a single composite to 
produce imaginative and even surreal results.<br>
 * Image overlay function 
creates a composite image in-camera from two selected NEF (RAW) images. The 
original files remain unaltered, opacity can be precisely controlled and the 
resultant image can be saved in either RAW, JPEG or TIFF format.<br>
 * 
Connection to a GPS (Global Positioning System) unit via an optionally 
available GPS Adapter Cord MC-35 enables the recording of data including 
latitude, longitude, elevation and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) along with 
conventional shooting data for each image.<br>
 * A large 2.5-inch LCD monitor 
with a 170 degree viewing angle from every direction assists accurate 
assessment of sharpness by enabling image preview with up to 400% 
magnification. It also offers RGB information as a single display or separate 
histograms for each color channel to enable better exposure-related 
decision-making.<br>
 * The large top LCD panel makes it easy to read a wealth 
of data at a glance, such as shooting mode, battery condition, card 
information, gridline display, shutter speed, F stop and number of remaining 
shots.<br>

unlocks the extensive potential of NEF (Nikon Electronic Format). Not only does 
it make smoother fidelity for tonal and other color corrections possible, but 
it also empowers photographers to reprocess images at any time and save the 
results to the original NEF file as a new Instruction Set, or as a TIFF or JPEG 
file, while retaining the integrity of the original data at all times.<br>
 *
