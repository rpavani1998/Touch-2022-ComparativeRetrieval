<h2>A Quick Refresher Course on Composition</h2> 
<p>with one comment</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>We all get the gist of composition. Think of how many times you&rsquo;ve 
heard about therule of thirds or the golden spiral.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re just 
starting to take your photography seriously, however, there are times when we 
get caught up in things, or stuck on &ldquo;auto&rdquo;, and let this important 
aspect of photography slide to the backburner. When used properly, these 
elements of composition can make an image really come together. That&rsquo;s 
because you frame and arrange elements together in a way that accentuates the 
subject and your own personal style. The viewer will, hopefully, walk away from 
the image with an understanding of visual aesthetics, form, and design.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Lines</h2> 
<p>The use of simple lines can be the most effective in some cases. Lines (and 
curves) direct the movement of the eye and help provide images with definition.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Viewpoints and Perspective</h2> 
<p>The viewpoint you take when&nbsp;setting up 
shots&nbsp;drastically&nbsp;affects the outcome of an image. Experiment with 
different perspectives and learn how your lenses interpret them as 
well.&nbsp;Depth of field&nbsp;can also be a really important factor in certain 
instances with the chosen&nbsp;viewpoint. I aim to be aware&nbsp;of the various 
options for unique perspectives when I am out shooting. &nbsp;This often means 
looking for spots that provide height such as stairs or benches to shoot 
downwards. Alternatively, just by bending down and shooting upwards you can 
also capture a different viewpoint. For the photo below, I decided 
to&nbsp;point upwards to get a shot of some local politicians at a press 
conference &ndash; this avoided the standard straight-on&nbsp;perspective and 
allowed me to include the archway in the background.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Fill the Frame</h2> 
<p>When deciding what to include in the shot, I try and exclude anything that 
doesn&rsquo;t add to the overall meaning or aesthetic of the image. Distracting 
elements are therefore left out so that the subject is the clear focus of the 
image. Filling the frame can also be a creative compositional technique &ndash; 
imagine if I had zoomed out and shown the entire elephant in the photo below 
&ndash; it would have drastically changed the look and feel that viewers come 
away with.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Composition and &ldquo;The Decisive Moment&rdquo;</h2> 
<p>Developing an understanding of visual aesthetics and how they interact and 
enhance a subject can make a photo both compelling and artistic. With some 
practice, this understanding can become second nature. Additionally, it may 
help to look at the work of other photographers and even other forms of art to 
recognize different approaches to composition. Although capturing &ldquo;the 
decisive moment&rdquo; may take some serendipity, having a&nbsp;firm grasp on 
compositional techniques prepares you for that one millisecond when everything 
lines up. For the shot below, I leaned down to get at the same eye level as 
this protestor was being arrested during a demonstration. The officer&rsquo;s 
stance helps frame the scene and I clicked the shutter just as the protestor 
looked over.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Break the Rules</h2> 
<p>Rules are made to be broken &ndash; or at least bent. There are many 
established guidelines for composition but every so often, those need to be 
ignored. Play around and see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t work, and see 
which techniques&nbsp;fit each specific subject as well as &nbsp;your own 
preferences. Maybe the subject in the dead center works in a particular case. 
Maybe the camera shouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp;level or straight as in the image 
below. By purposely tilting it, I was able to accentuate the sense of movement, 
however it&rsquo;s definitely not something I would recommend most of the time.
