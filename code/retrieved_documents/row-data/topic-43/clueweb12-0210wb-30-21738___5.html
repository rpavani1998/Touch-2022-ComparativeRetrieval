<p>Depending on how you rate the addition of video capture and dual card 
slots, Nikon's D300S can be rated as either a major or minor upgrade to the 
D300. Aside from these features, little has changed from the earlier model. The 
sensor is the same DX-format 12.3 megapixel (effective) chip and both models 
include Nikon's latest EXPEED image processor which is the same as in the D90 
(the first DSLR to offer HD video recording).</p> 
<p>The review camera was supplied with the new AF-S DX Nikkor 18-200mm 
f/3.5-5.6 G ED &nbsp;VR II lens, an update to the AF-S VR Zoom-Nikkor 18-200mm 
f/3.5-5.6 G IF-ED (which was reviewed in December 2005). The new lens will also 
be covered in this review.</p> 
<p><b>Body and Ergonomics<br>
</b>The body of the D300S is almost identical to 
its predecessor. Both have the same rugged construction with lightweight 
magnesium alloy used for the exterior cover, chassis and mirror box plus 
extensive dust- and moisture-proof sealing.<br>
<br>
<i><br>

shows the extent of the weatherproof sealing in the D300S body. (Source: Nikon.)
<br></i><br>
The general control layout is also unchanged - aside from the 
addition of a LV (Live View) button just above the AF-area mode selector and 
the removal of the lock for the memory card compartment (which now opens by 
sliding forward, as in the D700). The large, bright viewfinder carries over 
from the D300 and, despite claims of &lsquo;100% frame coverage' it still 
doesn't quite show the full image as it is captured.</p> 
<p><br>

<p>Although the body dimensions of both models are the same, the D300S is 
approximately 15 grams heavier than its predecessor. Factors contributing to 
the additional weight could be the second card slot (which adds support for SD 
and SDHC media to the D300's CF card storage) plus any additional electronics 
for video recording.</p> 
<p><br>
<i>The dual card slots, a new addition in the D300s. (Source: Nikon.)
</i></p> 
<p>As well as giving users the option to choose the type of memory card they 
prefer, the additional card slot provides greater shooting flexibility and 
convenience.&nbsp; Photographers can nominate one slot as a &lsquo;primary' 
recording slot and set recording in three different ways when both slots are in 
use.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&lsquo;Overflow' recording directs image data to the secondary card 
automatically when the primary card is full. &lsquo;Backup' recording stores 
the same images on both cards, while choosing &lsquo;RAW primary, JPEG 
secondary' recording lets you write RAW data and JPEG data separately to each 
card. You can also copy images between the two memory cards.</p> 
<p>The multi-selector with the central button, which features on the D3 series 
and D700, replaces the buttonless selector on the D300. It's a minor change - 
but important for triggering movie start and stop.</p> 
<p>The shutter mechanism is unchanged from the D300 and is rated for 150,000 
cycles. However, a new &lsquo;Q' setting on the release mode dial enables 
photographers to reduce the sound of the camera's mirror-down during shooting. 
This feature is handy for shooting wildlife and taking pictures in situations 
where shutter noise would otherwise be intrusive.</p> 
<p>As in the D300, the flash is popped up with a button on the left side of 
the flash mounting. Another button below it accesses flash mode settings. Lens 
coverage with the built-in flash is wider than the 18mm of the D300. The D300S 
can provide coverage for 16mm lenses with its built-in flash, which has a GN of 
17 (metres/ISO200). Support is provided for the Nikon Creative Lighting System, 
which allows up to two groups of remote units to be activated by the built-in 
flash, acting as master/commander in the Advanced Wireless Lighting mode.</p> 
<p>The optional Multi-Power Battery Pack MB-D10 can also be used with the 
D300S body to extend shooting capacity from 950 shots/charge with the 
rechargeable EN-EL3e Li-ion battery supplied with the camera to as much as 
2,950 shots/charge.</p> 
<p><b>Controls<br>
</b>Aside from functions associated with the new Movie mode 
(see below), the control suite on the D300S has changed very little from the 
D300 and the menu structure is essentially unchanged. A new addition is the 
Virtual Horizon display, which was introduced with the D3 and is now available 
in the D300S.<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>The menu system on the D300S is almost 
identical to the D300. (Source: Nikon.)</em></p> 
<p>The 51-point AF system continues and, like its predecessor, the D300S is 
designed for use with CPU lenses (particularly types G and D). AF tuning is 
available for up to 12 lens types. (IX-Nikkor lenses cannot be used with this 
camera.)</p> 
<p>The AF-Assist light on the front panel will work with most lenses that have 
focal lengths ranging from 24mm to 200mm, although with some lenses (listed in 
the user manual) the light path will be blocked making autofocusing impossible, 
particularly in low light levels. The built-in flash is usable with lens focal 
lengths from 16mm to 300mm, although not with macro zoom lenses and lens hoods 
should be removed to prevent shadowing. Flash compensation of -3 to +1EV is 
provided, along with a flash exposure (FV) lock that works with add-on flash 
units.</p> 
<p>We've already covered the Live View system in our review of the D300 and, 
since the same functions and controls are provided in the new model, there's no 
real need to repeat what was written in the D300 review. Output and playback 
options are essentially unchanged from the D300, as is the software bundle.
Click here for a link to that review.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Nikon's Scene Recognition System is also included in the exposure 
controls. It uses colour and brightness data from the 1,005-pixel RGB sensor to 
identify different scene types and will adjust camera settings accordingly in 
full-auto mode. White balance and flash controls are the same as the D300's and 
the Active D-Lighting dynamic range control also carries over to the D300S.</p> 
<p>Picture Control style presets are unchanged from the D300 and each setting 
supports adjustments to sharpness, contrast, brightness, saturation and hue. 
The selected Picture Control can be displayed by pressing the Info button. The 
D300S offers four presets: Standard, Neutral, Vivid and Monochrome and two 
additional presets - &nbsp;Portrait and Landscape - can be downloaded from the 
Nikon website. Customised Picture Controls can also be saved to a memory card 
for sharing with other D300S cameras and compatible software.</p> 
<p><b>Movie Capture</b><br>
Video recording with the D300S is a slight 
improvement on the D90 and D5000 because the new camera has an external 
microphone jack - a first in a Nikon DSLR camera. It's located in the main 
interface compartment on the left side panel and supports stereo sound 
recording with any microphone that has a 3.5 mm diameter stereo mini-pin jack. 
This allows users to record stereo soundtracks. (Without an external 
microphone, audio recordings are monaural.)</p> 
<p>Use of an external microphone minimises the chance of recording sounds 
produces by lens movements during autofocusing and when the VR mechanism is 
operating. Microphone sensitivity can be adjusted in the Movie Settings &gt; 
Microphone sub-menu using the up/down movements provided by the multi selector. 
You can also turn the sound recording on or off (the default setting is ON).</p>
<p>Before embarking on video capture you must select the desired recording 
mode from the Movie Settings sub-menu in the shooting menu. Three options are 
provided: 1280 x 720, 640 x 424 and 320 x 216. You can also select which of the 
built-in Picture Control settings you'd like to use and choose between the sRGB 
(the default) and Adobe RGB colour space settings. If two memory cards are in 
use, you must also select which card to record to.</p> 
<p>Support for autofocusing depends on the Live View mode, although the camera 
should always be focused on the subject before recording begins. You can 
re-focus the lens while shooting in Tripod mode by pressing the AF-ON button. 
Sadly, it's glacially slow. In the Hand-held mode manual focusing is the only 
option possible.</p> 
<p>Aperture settings need to be locked in before you begin shooting video 
clips, although the selected aperture will only be used if you're shooting in 
Tripod mode. In Handheld mode, the camera sets apertures and shutter speeds 
automatically in response to changes in subject brightness.</p> 
<p>Movies can only be recorded in Live View mode and the frame rate is fixed 
at 24 frames/second. A typical video shooting sequence operates as follows:</p> 
<p>1. Set the camera to Live View mode by pressing the LV button and choose 
between the Tripod and Hand-held modes. With the Tripod mode, when</p> 
<p>2. Focus on the subject by half-pressing the shutter button if you're in 
autofocus mode; otherwise focus manually. Shooting can't begin until the camera 
has focused and the focus is locked at the start of the recording. Once 
recording begins, you can only focus manually.</p> 
<p>3. Press the OK button in the centre of the arrow pad to start recording.
</p> 
<p>4. To stop recording, press OK again. In Hand-held mode, recording will 
stop if the shutter button is half-pressed or the AF-ON button is pressed.</p> 
<p>Most shooting modes can be used for recording video clips, although matrix 
metering is used for all movie clip recordings, regardless of which metering 
pattern is set. A recording indicator and the remaining time available are 
displayed in the monitor. Exposure can be locked by pressing the AE-L/AF-L 
button or adjusted by up to &plusmn;3 EV in steps of 1/3 EV in P, S, and A 
modes with the exposure compensation control. Pressing the shutter release 
takes a still picture (at the pre-set stills resolution) while the video is 
being recorded.</p> 
<p>Playing back recorded video clips via the camera is simple. Press the LV 
button a second time to disengage Live View then press the review button. Use 
the arrow pad to select the clip you wish to play and press OK to start and 
stop the video playback.</p> 
<p><b>Sensor and Image Processing<br>
</b>The DX-format imager in the D300S is 
the same as the D300's sensor. A slightly modified version of the Sony IMX021 
CMOS chip that was first released in the Sony A700 camera, it has a total of 
13.1 million photosites, with an effective resolution of 12.3 megapixels. An 
RGB Bayer filter provides colour information.<br>
<br>
<em>The sensor unit from 
the D300S. (Source: Nikon.)</em></p> 
<p>Interestingly, the EXPEED image processing system which carries over from 
the D300, supports a slightly faster continuous shooting speed. The new model 
claims to be able to achieve up to seven frames/second with the supplied 
lithium-ion battery and eight frames/second with the optional Multi-Power 
Battery Pack MP-D10 or mains power.</p> 
<p>As in the D300, the D300S has a top resolution of 4288 x 2848 pixels plus a 
base sensitivity range equivalent to ISO 200 to ISO 3200. Additional Lo 1 and 
Hi 1 settings expand this range to ISO 100 and ISO 6400 equivalent settings. 
Auto ISO control is also provided.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The sensor cleaning system is similar to Nikon's other DSLR cameras and 
works by vibrating the low-pass filter in front of the sensor chip. Cleaning 
can take place at any time by selecting the<i>Clean image sensor</i> option in 
the setup menu. Mirror lockup is also provided for manual sensor cleaning.</p> 
<p>Simultaneous RAW+JPEG capture is offered at each of the three JPEG file 
sizes supported. Interval timer photography is also selectable via the shooting 
menu and users can set start times and interval times in hours, minutes and 
seconds.</p> 
<p>Two types of noise reduction processing are provided, separately covering 
long exposures and high ISO settings. When Long Exp. NR is turned on, all 
exposures longer than eight seconds are processed to reduce noise. Dark-frame 
subtraction appears to be involved in this mode as image processing times are 
roughly doubled.</p> 
<p>High ISO NR suppression can be set to High, Normal or Low levels or 
switched off. Processing kicks in at ISO 800 with the On setting and at HI 0.3 
and above when Off is selected. We observed little or no effect on processing 
times with any of the levels selected.<br>
<br>
All internal processing in the 
chip is handled in full 16-bit colour, which provides better tonal 
reproduction, improved colour fidelity and faster image processing. An 
integrated analogue-to-digital (A/D) converter on the chip allows photographers 
to choose between 12-bit and 14-bit raw file conversion. TIFF file capture is 
provided for photographers who require large files but don't want the hassle of 
shooting in raw format. Typical file sizes and buffer capacities for burst 
shooting are provided in the table below.</p>

<p>* JPEG compression set for Size Priority</p> 
<p>As in previous Nikon DSLRs that support movie capture, video is recorded in 
the AVI/Motion JPEG format, which is less efficient than the AVCHD and H.264 
formats supported by other digital still cameras. However, it's also easier to 
edit and better supported by third-party video editing software. Typical frame 
rates and clip lengths are shown in the table below.</p>

<p>The maximum size of individual movie files is 2GB. Actual clip lengths can 
be dictated by the memory card's write speed. Shooting may be truncated when 
cards are too slow to match the camera's data rate.</p> 
<p><b>The 18-200mm Lens<br>
</b>The supplied AF-S DX Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 
G ED VR II lens is designed for cameras with APS-C-sized imagers and provides a 
focal length range equivalent to 28-300mm on a 35mm camera. This is equivalent 
to an 11x zoom range and the angle-of-view coverage suggests this lens is meant 
as an all-round choice for photographers who want just one lens for the camera 
body.<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>The AF-S DX Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED VR II lens. 
(Source: Nikon.)&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p>Being a relatively slow lens - with maximum apertures ranging from f/3.5 to 
f/5.6 - it is also relatively compact and measures 96.5mm in length at the 18mm 
setting with a diameter of roughly 77mm (without the lens hood attached). 
Overall weight is approximately 565 grams.&nbsp; Zooming out to 200mm extends 
the lens barrel by roughly 65mm. The front element doesn't rotate during 
zooming, allowing angle-critical attachments to be used without requiring 
re-adjustment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>The optical diagram for the AF-S DX Nikkor 
18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 G ED VR II lens showing the location of the special 
elements. (Source: Nikon.)&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p>The optical design comprises 16 elements in 12 groups and includes three 
aspherical elements plus two ED (Extra-low Dispersion) elements. A seven-bladed 
diaphragm closes to a circular aperture for attractive bokeh. The closest 
focusing distance is 50 cm at all focal lengths, which provides a maximum 
magnification ratio of 0.22x at the 200mm setting. The front of the lens is 
threaded to accept 72mm diameter filters.<br>
<br>
The VR II tag indicates a 
second-generation Vibration Reduction mechanism. As in the previous system, two 
pairs of gyro sensors are used to detect pitch (vertical) and yaw (horizontal) 
movements. This information is sent to two voice coil motors, which shift 
certain internal elements to counteract the detected motion. Nikon claims users 
can shoot with shutter speeds roughly four f-stops lower than they could with 
an unstabilised lens.</p> 
<p>Two VR modes are provided: Normal and Active. The Normal mode is for 
shooting from a stationary base, while the Active mode is designed to provide 
compensation when shooting from a moving platform, such as a vehicle or ship. 
VR can also be switched off when the camera is tripod-mounted.</p> 
<p>The zoom ring is located towards the front of the lens barrel. Roughly 20mm 
wide, it has approximately 18 mm of ridged rubber grip with a trailing edge 
that carries engraved settings for the 18mm, 24mm, 35mm 50mm, 70mm 135mm and 
200mm focal lengths. Behind the zoom ring is a distance scale with settings for 
0.5, 1 and 3 metres plus infinity. The focusing ring lies behind this scale and 
has a 10 mm wide ridged rubber grip.</p> 
<p>Three slider switches are located on the side of the lens barrel behind the 
focusing ring, covering the M/A and M focusing modes, VR on and off and Normal 
and Active VR settings. A zoom lock is positioned further forward between the 
zoom and focusing rings. It's necessary because this lens is very prone to zoom 
creep when pointed downwards.</p> 
<p>The zoom ring moves through more than a quarter of a turn across its range. 
Maximum and minimum apertures change as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>On test, this lens was found to suffer from noticeable barrel distortion at 
the 18mm focal length setting. This was largely resolved by 24mm but changed to 
pincushion distortion, which was obvious from the 70mm focal length on. 
Rectilinear distortion is not uncommon in extended-range zoom lenses, although 
it is seldom quite so obvious over so much of the zoom range.</p> 
<p>In our Imatest tests, resolution remained relatively high throughout the 
aperture and focal length range, with best results coming from the shorter 
focal lengths and wider aperture settings. Edge softening was detected at all 
apertures and focal length settings, being slightly more pronounced at the 
widest apertures. The graph below shows the results of our tests.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lateral chromatic aberration was generally well-controlled and remained 
within the &lsquo;negligible' category at most aperture and focal length 
settings. No coloured fringing was detected in test shots.&nbsp; The graph 
below shows the results of our Imatest tests. (The red line marks the boundary 
between 'negligible' and 'low' CA.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Vignetting at wide apertures was barely visible with most focal length 
settings. However, at 200mm, darkened corners could be seen in test shots. 
Examples from the 18mm and 200mm focal lengths are shown below.<br>

<p><b>Performance</b><br>
Not unexpectedly, subjective assessment of test 
shots taken with the default standard Picture Control setting showed them to be 
similar to our test shots from the D300. Even without the Active D-Lighting 
function engaged, outdoor shots contained the wide dynamic range that's 
expected from a DSLR camera. Applying Active D-Lighting processing, even at the 
lowest level, was enough to record most of the highlight detail missed when 
this function wasn't used.</p> 
<p>Imatest showed the review camera's resolution to be similar to the D300, 
which is to be expected. However, colour accuracy was somewhat better, although 
saturation was marginally higher with the default Picture Control setting. 
Because we're not enamoured of Nikon's View NX (which is supplied with the 
camera), we chose to convert raw files with Adobe Camera Raw, version 5.5 of 
which supports the D300S and is currently available as a free download for 
users of Photoshop and Photoshop Elements.</p> 
<p>Not surprisingly, NEF.RAW files converted into 16-bit TIFFs produced higher 
resolution than JPEGs in our Imatest tests. As expected from our tests of the 
D300, resolution declined slightly as ISO sensitivity was increased and 
remained relatively high at the Hi 1.0 setting, which equates to ISO 6400. The 
graph below shows the results of our tests.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, in actual tests shots we noticed an increasing deterioration in 
sharpness as noise increased at ISO settings above 640, particularly in long 
exposures. Without long-exposure noise-reduction processing, noise started to 
become visible at ISO 800 and was obvious at ISO 3200 and 6400. However, 
colours remained reasonably accurate up to ISO 3200, although at ISO 6400 both 
contrast and saturation were slightly reduced. No stuck pixels were observed, 
even in 30-second exposures.</p> 
<p>In flash shots, little noise was visible up to ISO 1600 but shots taken at 
ISO 6400 were visibly affected and images appeared relatively flat and slightly 
soft. Application of noise reduction processing tended to soften high ISO 
images further, regardless of whether they were taken with flash or as long 
exposures. The test camera produced even flash exposures at all ISO settings 
and was capable of illuminating an average-sized room at ISO 200.</p> 
<p>Auto white balance performance with the review camera was similar to the 
D300's, with residual colour casts remaining in shots taken under both 
incandescent and fluorescent lighting. The manual pre-sets tended to 
over-correct with both lighting types and preset measurement was required to 
obtain neutral colours. Like the D300, &nbsp;the D300S provides a full range of 
tools to fine-tune colour reproduction in difficult lighting conditions.</p> 
<p>Response times were also similar to the D300. The review camera powered up 
almost instantaneously and we measured an average capture (AF plus shutter) lag 
of 0.2 seconds, which reduced to instantaneous capture when shots were 
pre-focused. It took less than two seconds to process and display each image 
file, regardless of whether it was captured as a JPEG, NEF.RAW or RAW+JPEG.</p> 
<p>In the Continuous High burst mode, we recorded 16 Large/Fine JPEGs in 2.1 
seconds, which represents a frame rate close to the claimed seven 
frames/second. Swapping to raw file capture with lossless compression, we 
recorded&nbsp; 10 frames in 2.1 seconds with the 12-bit setting and 10 frames 
in 3.2 seconds with the 14-bit setting, which is about 5 fps and 3 fps 
respectively. Ten 14-bit RAW+JPEG files were captured in 3.3 seconds and this 
burst took 11.6 seconds to process.</p> 
<p>Capture and processing speeds were essentially unchanged when bursts of 
RAW+JPEG images were recorded separately to different cards. For our tests, we 
used a SanDisk Extreme IV 4GB CF card and a Verbatim 4GB Class 6 SHDC card and 
were able to record 10 frames in 3.3 seconds. File processing was completed in 
11.8 seconds.</p> 
<p>In the Continuous Low shooting mode, we recorded 10 Large/Fine JPEGs in a 
2.9 second burst that took 5.2 seconds to process. The 14-bit raw files were 
recorded in 3.2 seconds and took 8.1 seconds to process, while for RAW+JPEG 
files the same capture rates were recorded but processing time extended to 10.2 
seconds.</p> 
<p>Video performance was similar to the D90 and D5000 and, as with these 
cameras, the smoothest, cleanest footage came from clips recorded in Tripod 
mode with the camera mounted on a sturdy tripod. Handheld clips were prone to 
motion artefacts and the monaural soundtracks were uninspiring. However, when 
subjects were stationary or very slow moving, images were sharp and detailed 
enough to provide satisfactory footage for display on a widescreen TV set.</p> 
<p><b>Buy this camera if</b>:<br>
- You want a solidly-built DSLR camera with 
a weather-resistant body and a professional-standard controls and functions.<br>
- You want a Live View system plus the ability to shoot HD video clips - and 
are prepared to accept the limitations in the Movie mode.<br>
- You have a 
selection of DX-Nikkor lenses.</p> 
<p><b>Don't buy this camera if</b>:<br>
- You're simply upgrading from the 
D300 - unless the new features are essential.<br>
- You require fast 
autofocusing and focus tracking in Live View mode.<br>
- You want 
body-integrated image stabilisation.<br>
- You plan to make extensive use of 
the video recording facilities. (The relatively poor audio quality of this 
camera will soon disappoint unless you invest in an external microphone.)<br>
