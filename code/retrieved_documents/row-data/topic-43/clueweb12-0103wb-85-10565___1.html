After years of rumors, sightings, and anticipation, the Nikon D200, a 10.2 
megapixel DSLR with a 5 frames-per-second burst speed and a brand-new autofocus 
module, finally enters the market. Priced at under $1700 online, it replaces 
the D100, which Nikon announced almost four years back &ndash; generations ago, 
in digital imaging terms. Nikon users will probably measure it against more 
recent cameras. How much better is it than the $840 Nikon D70s? How close is it 
to the $4,400 flagship Nikon D2X? It's also worth comparing it to the offerings 
in Canon's current lineup, particularly the Canon EOS 5D and 20D, two other 
cameras that are both a step down from the top of the line, but also popular 
with both professionals and serious amateurs. However, with extensive custom 
options, iTTL flash control with commander mode, and a rugged magnesium body, 
the perhaps long overdue D200 is sure to carve a niche for itself within the 
dense DSLR market.&nbsp;<br>
