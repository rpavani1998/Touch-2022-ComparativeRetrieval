<h2>Key Technology</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Much of the D800's core technology is lifted straight out of the $6000 D4, 
released earlier this year. Apart from their sensors and continuous capture 
rates in fact, the two cameras are more alike than they are different. Here's a 
breakdown of the D800's key technology, adapted in part from our previously 
published overview of the Nikon D4.</p> 
<h3>Sensor</h3> 
<p>At the heart of the D800 is a brand new Nikon-developed sensor that boasts 
36.8 million pixels in total, with a maximum effective output of 36.3MP. Its 
ISO span is 100-6400 natively, expandable to a range of 50 ('Lo1') to 25,600 
('Hi2') equivalent. Nikon's highest resolution DSLR to date, the D800 offers a 
50% higher pixel count than the flagship D3X. As well as being potentially very 
attractive to studio and landscape professionals, the D800 should pique the 
interest of a great many enthusiast Nikon users too - many of whom might have 
been 'stuck' at 12MP for years, with a D300, D300s or D700.</p> The D800's 
36.3MP CMOS sensor has by far the greatest pixel count of any non medium-format 
DSLR currently on the market. The ISO span is slightly wider than that of its 
predecessor the D700, at 100-6400, expandable down to ISO 50 and up to ISO 
25,600 (equivalent). <br>
<br>

<p>Easily overlooked is the D800's DX format capture mode. This isn't new (all 
of Nikon's FX format DSLRs have offered an APS-C format crop option) but at an 
output resolution of 15.4MP in this crop mode the D800 is a considerably more 
useful camera in DX format than the D700, D3 or D3S. It is also worth noting 
that the D800's sensor has a similar pixel pitch to the well-regarded 16MP 
D7000, which has very encouraging implications for image quality in both FX and 
DX capture modes.</p> 
<h3>D800E - 'cancellation' of anti-aliasing filter</h3> 
<p>Nikon uses slightly curious wording about the D800E - that the 
anti-aliasing effect of the optical filter stack in front of the sensor is 
'cancelled' - and the diagram below shows what this means (courtesy of Nikon). 
Anti-aliasing filters work by using a birefringent material to split light rays 
into two based upon the polarization of the light; a first layer splits it 
horizontally, the second vertically. The practical result is a slight blurring 
of the image, to avoid moir&eacute; and aliasing artefacts. In the case of the 
D800E, the first filter is instead directly counteracted by the second, 
resulting in no overall blurring.</p> <br>
With the D800, light passing through 
the lens that is transmitted to the image sensor is separated into four 
segments using a low-pass filter to prevent moir&eacute; and false colour.<br>
 
With the D800E, the effect of the low-pass filter is removed, and the light is 
transmitted to the image sensor with no blurring, achieving higher-resolution 
images. <br>
<br>

<p>This seems like an odd way of doing things; why not just remove the filter 
altogether? Our best guess is that it simply makes manufacturing the two models 
side-by-side easier: instead of having to make an entirely different filter 
stack for the D800E, Nikon just needs to change the first low-pass filter in 
the overall assembly. Crucially, this keeps the same infrared blocking and 
anti-reflective properties across the two cameras.</p> 
<h3>Autofocus</h3> 
<p>The D800 has the same new autofocus sensor as the D4 and, while its 
headline improvement is that it can now focus in lower light (down to -2EV) , 
this isn't the only step forward. The sensor module has also been redesigned to 
enable it to operate with slower lenses (and lens/teleconverter combinations 
that give slower effective apertures). The D800 features six AF Area modes - 
single point, 9-point, 21-point, 51-point, 51-point '3D' tracking, and Auto 
Area mode (shown below).</p> <br>
In single-point AF mode, the D800 simply 
focusses where you tell it to - you can set your desired AF point using the 
rear 4-way controller. In 9-point 'Dynamic Area AF' mode the camera will use 
the eight AF points surrounding the one you select as 'backup' in case your 
subject moves. <br>
<br>
In 21-point Dynamic Area AF mode the surrounding 20 AF 
points are used... ...and in 51-point Dynamic Area AF mode, the other 50 will 
also help out. <br>
<br>
In 'Auto Area' AF mode, all of the D800's 51 AF points 
are active, and the camera uses color information from its 91k-dot metering 
sensor to detect faces. With AF mode set to 'C' for 'continuous', Auto Area AF 
becomes '3D tracking AF'. In this mode, the D800 uses its 91k-dot metering 
sensor to identify your subject automatically, and the focussing system tracks 
it across the AF array (but sadly it doesn't spell out '3D' in the viewfinder 
in real life...) <br>
<br>

<p>As before, with lenses of f/5.6 or faster, 15 of its 51 AF points act as 
cross-type: sensitive to both horizontal and vertical detail. The 9 central 
focus points will continue as cross type when used with lenses with a maximum 
aperture of between f/5.6 and f/8. The D800's central AF point will still 
operate as a cross-type point with lens or lens/converter combinations with a 
maximum aperture of f/8. In addition, 10 AF points retain horizontal 
sensitivity at this aperture. In the diagram above, cross-type sensors are 
indicated in orange.</p> <br>
F5.6 or brighter F5.6-F8 F8 <br>
<br>

<h3>Auto ISO Improvements</h3> 
<p>Nikon has for a long time offered a degree of control over its Auto ISO 
settings, allowing the user to specify a minimum shutter speed that the camera 
should aim to maintain by raising the ISO. However shooters using zoom lenses, 
or worried about camera shake rather than freezing the action, may prefer a 
minimum shutter speed that relates to the focal length in use, rather than 
specifying an absolute figure. This has been resolved on the D800 and the D4 
with an Auto ISO system that detects the lens' focal length.</p> 
<p>When this is activated, the user can then also bias the program towards 
using slower shutter speeds and lower ISOs, or faster shutter speeds and higher 
ISOs, in five steps. Something we really like about the new Auto ISO system is 
that it doesn't have to be set via the D800's main menu system. 'Auto' is one 
of the main ISO value options accessed via the ISO button on the D800's top 
plate.</p> 
<h3>Video Mode</h3> 
<p>The parallel advances made in sensor technology and Internet video 
distribution have helped create the ability to capture and broadcast video 
footage. In turn this has put pressure on many professional photographers to 
capture clips alongside their stills. In addition, the broadcast and movie 
industries have adopted the EOS 5D Mark II to a degree that appears to have 
surprised even Canon. As a result, it's not surprising that the D800 features a 
very advanced, and well-integrated video mode, offering almost exactly the same 
functionality introduced in the D4 including a headphone outlet for monitoring 
audio and the option to record uncompressed video to an external drive via HDMI.
</p> 
<p>Like the D4, the D800 features a headphone port for audio monitoring of 
video capture during filming. There are 20 adjustment levels for audio 
recording (plus auto) and monitoring volume can be adjusted in 30 levels.</p> 
<br> 
<p>Uncompressed HD video footage can be sent out of the camera, straight to an 
external drive via the built-in HDMI port.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The D800 can shoot 1080p movies at 30, 25 or 24 frames per second and at up 
to 24Mbps. Video footage is compressed using the B-frame compression section of 
the H.264 standard, which tries to optimize the capture of motion without 
hugely inflating the file sizes. It also has manually configurable volume 
control, including a line-level audio option. However, what may prove to be the 
camera's biggest feature from the videographer's point of view is the ability 
to export its uncompressed video footage via its HDMI port. We suspect that 
this feature, beyond all others, may help endear the camera to the broadcast 
and movie crowd. Whether using this for recording the camera's best quality 
footage or to use an external monitor as viewfinder, it's a feature we expect 
to become increasingly common.</p> 
<p>Movies can also be shot at two different crops from the sensor, FX and DX. 
This makes it easy to vary the field-of-view for grabbing footage, even if 
you&rsquo;ve got a prime lens mounted. However, the &lsquo;FX&rsquo; size is a 
significantly cropped version of the full sensor (it&rsquo;s 91% of the 
sensor&rsquo;s width), so the field-of-view will be a little narrower than 
you&rsquo;d expect for any given focal length.</p> 
<p>The D800 also inherits the D4's improved aperture control in movie mode, 
with the addition of 'Power aperture'. This simply means that the user can 
adjust the aperture while recording video in the A and M exposure modes. It's 
also possible to set the aperture much more precisely, in 1/8 stop increments 
using the Pv and Fn buttons on the front of the camera. With a card in the 
camera you can only do this prior to commencing video capture, but with 
uncompressed video sent through the D800's HDMI port you can control aperture 
during recording, too. In principle this level of control should allow more 
exact matching of recording brightness across multiple camera / lens 
combinations.</p> 
<h3>Upgraded LCD Monitor</h3> 
<p>The D800's LCD monitor is the same as that used in the D4 and is upgraded 
compared to the D700's - it's a slightly larger 3.2&quot; 921000 dot unit, but 
according to Nikon has a substantially expanded colour gamut that's close to 
sRGB. It also has a light sensor to detect ambient light levels, and adjust not 
only the screen brightness, but also the saturation, contrast and gamma as 
well, in an attempt to give optimized output. The monitor also has a gel resin 
layer between the LCD and the cover glass to minimise&nbsp;any risk of fogging 
when the camera is exposed to rapid changes of temperature.</p> 
<h3>USB 3.0</h3> 
<p>In a first for digital cameras, the D800 features a USB 3.0 port. USB 3.0 
is the second major revision of the USB standard, and offers two-way 
communication (like FireWire) and a maximum data transmission speed of 5 Gbits 
per second with lower power consumption than USB 2.0. Although not yet widely 
adopted, 'Superspeed' USB 3.0 is being included in an increasing number of 'new 
generation' computers. Until then, the standard is backwards compatible with 
USB 2.0 (so you could plug the D800 into a USB 2.0 port using the supplied USB 
cable, and transfer files at the standard USB 2.0 speed).</p> 1. Introduction

<p>Am considering making the switch back to Nikon from Canon. 5D to D800</p> 
<p>Image quality and features will not make much of a difference for my style 
of photography. However, Nikon's ergonometric design and accessibility with in 
the camera -will.</p> 
<p>My pet-peeve about Canon is forging the user to get away from the 
viewfinder to find important features. Nikon make is easier.</p> 
<p>Reading this review, I am a little disappointed with two items - the 
increase of Megapixel size, and not increasing the ISO abilities. I rather have 
less pixels and greater ISO, than more pixels, as it slows down the workflow. 
Its not the size, but how you use it.</p> 
<p>I was expecting the 800 D to reach 111, 000 ISO as an expansion feature. 
However, I prefer a camera that can shoot up to 25, 000 ISO well rather than a 
poor showing of higher limits.</p> 
<p>Nonetheless I am very excited about the new 800 D. I also welcome a 
sponsorship from NIKON, http://www.artofheadshots.com</p>  Comment edited 1

<p>I shoot quite a bit of long exposure at night and am curious if anyone has 
sampled the D800 or D800E with long exposures at night? It would be interesting 
to find out if the smaller pixels of the D800 will &quot;fill up with 
light&quot; faster and start burning the image quicker than the D700.</p>  0

<p>These are exciting times!! Remember how stunned and amazed people were when 
Nikon broked new grounds with D90? Personally, I was hoping that the D700 
upgrade would be in the 18 - 22 MP range but looking back, the only thing that 
kept me from having a D3X was its stiff price. Nikon's D800 is breaking new 
grounds with an affordable, state of the art stills camera with video 
capabilities. This is another example of how technology keeps us jumping out of 
bed early each morning hoping to capture that one fleeting moment of eternity. 
I read a comment somewhere that says 'you don't go the war zones with a 36MP 
camera', well then, let's make D800 an instrument of PEACE !! Photography is 
about choices, changes, challenges and consequences. Cheers to innovation, 
personal truth and creative freedom !! 'If you love what you do, you'd never 
work a day in your life' I had fond memories with my D700; time to move on.....

<p>After having been &quot;taking pictures&quot; and schlepping around pro 
&quot;stuff&quot; for over 30 years (starting off soon with the most fantastic 
F2+motor and a bag full of lenses and other gear - at one time we had the bag 
on a scale - it went over 20 kilograms ! - ending with the 5DMKII+ 24-105...) I 
recently bought - in spite of and not wanting to wait any longer on DP for a

<p>You mention built-in flash as though it is a plus for the Nikon or drawback 
for the Canon.</p> 
<p>Perhaps, but mechanical interlocks have a downside, requiring more 
complicated controls and internal space, while making the camera slightly 
heavier and more expensive.</p> 
<p>My 20D had problems because of the built-in flash, used for perhaps 2% of 
the shots taken. I consider those problems far outweigh the convenience.</p> 
<p>Hence, on a camera with a high effective ISO there is little need for 
built-in interlocked flash.</p> 
<p>Use the space, money, etc to improve something else.</p>  Comment edited 2

<p>D800E candidates, remember these caveats: <br>
- If you plan to sell your 
D800E someday, there will be a much smaller market for it.<br>
- Very likely, 
the sharpness difference can be mitigated on a D800 with judicious use of a 
Lens Blur filter. If you're not planning on enlarging past 24x36 inches, you'll 
never notice any difference.<br>
- There are very few simple and fast solutions 
to remove moire once it's in an image. It can turn up in the strangest places.
</p> 
<p>If you need a D800E, you are probably experienced enough to KNOW that you 
need it for your work. Everyone else is likely better off with the D800.</p>  2

<p>I are sure? I pre-ordered my D800E today, and I was nr. 106 in the list. In 
D800 line I would be nr. 140. BUT given that Nikon will make those cameras in 
1:9 ratio, e.g ONLY one D800E per NINE (9) D800, you could guess, what will be 
real demand on new and used market.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

has nothing to do with having 1mp or 36mp in your camera!</p>  0 upvotes <br>
 
ByIvan Azzopardi (1 week ago) <br>

<p>36mp is good for those who uses prime lenses as there would be a room for 
cropping. the only thing i am not sure about the pixel-per-pixel sharpness like 
the D700. I think Nikon has to coach d800e users in order to nearly eliminate 
the case of moire effect. Maybe the D800 will be the same sharpness as the D700 
and the D800e with much more sharpness.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>A bit about the ergonomics/ handling to share, that somehow has been missed 
in all reviews so far... :)</p> 
<p>I'v had my D700 since it was released and one downside difference in the 
D800 ergonomics area, that no one has yet mentioned, is the thumb-rest area 
that protrudes form the back of the D800, is significantly smaller/ slimmer 
than the D700. This is for me somewhat anoying as it provides much less grip, 
when holding/ operating the D800 with one hand. It might sound like a small 
thing, but as a street photographer, I always hold my D700 in a fire-ready 
grip, and this small bump/ thumb-rest area, is a biggie for me, as it secures 
the grip alot and almost lets the D700 balance between my fingers with little 
effort.</p> 
<p>And just to clarify - I have had a real life D800(E) in my hands :)</p> 
<p>The major ergonomics improvement is the shutter button slant at 35 degrees. 
Great!, But still - I find i strange that they made it less &quot;grippy&quot; 
for one hand operation :(</p>  Comment edited 2 times, last edit 2 minutes

<p>It&acute;s an impertinence of Nikon to take a price premium for their 
D800E. Removing the AA filter is senseful, I modded my old Canon DSLR some 
years ago this way, never had moire problems but significant increased detail 
level. It&acute;s time to get totally rid of the AA filter in all cameras.</p>  
1 upvote <br>
 By DonAndre (1 week ago) <br>

<p>I don't agree. AA filtering is a good way of producing realistic looking 
images. The comparisons I have seen are not impressive at all. The difference 
is tiny and the AA free pictures look more artificial due to the jagged edges. 
There is not more detail, there's just more noise and more artifacts.</p> 
<p>However, I admit there are a few applications where AA filtering is not 
beneficial such as astrophotography. But that's niche markets.</p>  3 upvotes 
<br>  By EcoPix (1 week ago) <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if the D800E will be the more forgiving of lenses, 
because the extra bite of a razor sharp lens won&rsquo;t be so needed to 
overcome the AA filter effect, thus still giving an acceptable result, and they 
will be able to be stopped down more, to eliminate their corner problems.<br>

When stopped down a long way, the extra softness from diffraction will be 
somewhat countered by the camera&rsquo;s lack of diffusion, and that softness 
will help moir&eacute;. I know from my old Kodak AA-less camera that the bog 
standard zoom was preferable in some situations to the sharp primes, which 
created artifacts.<br>
It&rsquo;s the D800 that will be demanding on lenses, 
because you won&rsquo;t be able to stop them down past their sharpest, and you 
will have corner and curvature (and depth of field) probs.<br>
I&rsquo;m 
wondering if one reason Nikon decided to make the seemingly odd D800E may have 
been to help with the depth of field problem with high res cameras.</p>  0

 By EcoPix (1 week ago) <br>

<p>The link by Samos151 (below) to the Nikon users guide is relevant to this. 
One spin on what they&rsquo;re saying is, if your work&rsquo;s okay with 
shallow depth of field, go for the D800 because your lens will be sharp, but if 
you need to stop the lens down to f11 or more, use the D800E because it&rsquo;s 
sharper and the diffraction will cancel the moir&eacute; anyway. I could be 
wrong but I&rsquo;m getting the feeling it&rsquo;s all about depth of field.</p>

<p>About 12 years ago when the first Digital cameras with resolutions over 1m 
pixels became available, I again got serious about photography. I loved the era 
of 35m slides and setting up the projector with a 60&quot; screen. But also 
came many disappointments. The slide projectors never got better, just more 
convenient. (remember the carousel projectors by Kodak?) Effective slide 
presentations required lots of time and still the audience got bored. I finally 
abandoned the world of slides for print film but was never happy there. The 
sharpness and color was frankly crappy unless you had a fortune to spend with 
specialty photo labs or did your own developing.</p> 
<p>With digital came a new hope. Every year there were better cameras and I 
had the money to buy them (no longer having to buy film). It took 12 more years 
but now my photos amaze my friends instead of boring them.</p> 
<p>I understand that some folks still like film but that technology is just 
stagnant now.</p>

<p>Johnz, you're writing my script and I'll bet, many thousands of others. We 
who love taking photographs, (and when will that word become obsolete?), have 
never had it so good; the only cloud on the horizon being the ever increasing 
importance given to video so that the morony can show off their ghastly holiday 
'films'. At present, with a bit of care and the latest gear we can take shots 
approaching or even equalling pro standard. That is not and very likely never 
will be the case with video where the gap between pro gear, (and photogs.), is 
of Grand Canyon proportions. So please, please, will some major manf. bring out 
a camera that just takes photos. I'll bet there's a market.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>Westkip...you perhaps do not have children, grandchildren and may not have 
much family around you. This is perhaps why you are not interested in having 
video....but beyond even that, video captures an event much more complete than 
any single photo can, of course there is more planning involved so as not to 
have &quot;those boring holiday<br>
videos&quot; you talk of. You assume that 
everyone takes boring videos....take a look at some of the Tropfest short 
films. You can create a fantastic and exciting short 5min video. I had a Sony 
Z1P HD camera which took great video...but I would rather have an SLR with 
Video capability so I don't have to lug around a large video camera as well. I 
have a D700 and became very envious when Canon brought out the 5DMII. Just

well that the pixel wars would go on unabatted as more and more innovative 
solutions to what was once thought impossible. After more than 300,000 shutter

<p>Several thoughts--for the fellow who takes several thousand pictures a week 
storage is going to be a problem--the hard drive of the month club?<br>
You are 
going to need to spend at least as much on a computer--probably more to 
Photoshop files that big.--sending them over the internet to be printed is 
going to be a problem too.<br>
Photo paper cane &quot;Catch&quot; about 250 
lines per inch--so out of the box the D800 is good for 30&quot;--but when you 
print smaller--and most of your prints will be--the paper is going to catch 250 
no matter what you throw at it..<br>
Finally, I really wonder if the lenses can 
deliver 36MP to the sensor--maybe they can, but I would like to see some 
numbers--<br>
All that said I will buy a couple as soon as they are out--but 
especially the file size storage is going to be a mixed blessing.</p>  0 upvotes

<p>Relax - don't stress - I have some files from a D800, and after processing 
from raw, they are about 30mb each, and you can get 3TB hard drives, and use 
Blu-Ray writer to save to useable disks. I am editing on a 1.6 ghz chip, with 
only about 2gb memory, and apart from taking a bit of time, there is no big 
problem. Just remember that because of the tsunami and earthquake problem, the 
3TB drives are way more expensive. Stay with 2TB and a hard drive docking 
station, and you will be well away. True, you may have to spend out more on 
your computer, but in the course of events, you would have had to anyway. The 
native resolution gives a nice 16x24 inch print at 300dpi, and incidentally, 
most printers will give improved detail by printing at 400 dpi - try it on a 
very fine detail item, and you will be amazed how good they can be - enjoy the

<p>Okay! Thanks for that link, and also Nikon for being helpfully honest - 
admitting there are challenges with these cameras. They&rsquo;re conceding a 
depth of field problem. It&rsquo;s interesting they felt the need to re-educate 
us so we can handle their new bigger cameras. And they seem to be admitting 
it&rsquo;s not for portraiture &ndash; open up to f4 to soften the resolution!
<br>I reckon the last box on the last page (17) is the significant one, reading 
between the lines. While about moir&eacute;, it supports the notion of using 
the D800E&rsquo;s increased sharpness to counter diffraction at small f-stops 
and gain depth of field without too much softness.<br>
They&rsquo;re conceding 
the early tradeoff (f11) between focus and resolution, and the sharpness / 
moir&eacute; tradeoff, so it does seem to me they&rsquo;ve approached a 
resolution wall and can see the problems.<br>
Good on &lsquo;em for being so 
responsible though, or was it that they were worried about a deluge of 
complaints and queries from new owners thinking their cameras are faulty?</p>

<p>May be I'm wrong, but as long as I can understand, more pixels is equal to 
more resolution, more fine detail. Bigger pixel is equal to better light 
reading performance, but image quality is a relative factor that depend upon 
the mix of a variety of factors that are determined by the photographer and his 
or her context. So IQ is not in exclusive dependence from pixel quantity or 
pixels size.</p> 
<p>If I believe that I need resolution I know where to look, If I believe that 
all I need is low light performance it is quite easy too. But, if I know that I 
really want image quality, then I will have to look further away from the 
camera specs and brochures. To me, the deep sens of IQ is pretty evident in the 
Frans Lanting book &quot; LIFE A Journey Through Time&quot;. (in paper real 
book), a brave artist regard over the &quot;noises and blurs&quot; of image 
quality.</p>  Comment edited 42 seconds after posting  1 upvote <br>

<p>Really? whats not to like about the D800.... I've got the D700, S3 Pro, 
EPL-1 20mm f1.7 and the D5100... And all are great camera's</p> 
<p>Well I'm saving up for mine slowly.. Can't wait !!!...(But in no rush since 
the brain op) I mean 36mp thats the realm of Medium Format (and they rarely 
shoot over ISO 400 for advertising).</p> 
<p>If you need to chop the chroma noise at high ISO skip down to 12mp on the 
D800 (But I guess to this not necessary due to improvement in technology)..</p> 
<p>I do not think it is envy and consumer ignorance... I mean the Leica M9 
cost twice as much as D800 and I wish I could afford one (cannot fault any 
Leica Lens and a M9 is damn sharp at 18mp), but I find it practical to spend it 
on a D800 (invested on Nikon Lenses). So on that note I think Nikon is selling 
the D800 at really good price considering you got 36mp, 1080p video and 100% 
Viewfinder. What more can you want.</p>

<p>'Pixel binning' and while it was rumored prior to the announcement of the 
D800 I have not read anything since the announcement to indicate the D800 uses 
binning in any way. Which would mean that the cropped modes are just that, a 
cropped portion of the sensor.<br>
I have had a little experience with binning 
using my uncle's PhaseOne, and it can make a dramatic difference in dynamic 
range and noise reduction. When it is processed at the sensor level, opposed to 
software, it appears to be quite functional and beneficial. I think there is 
some sort of limitation when implementing it on CMOS sensors versus CCD, 
something related to the way the data is read and processed on a CCD type 
sensor.</p>  0 upvotes <br>
 By kayone (1 week ago) <br>

<p>The 'crop modes' will indeed be a smaller portion of the sensor, which 
means for any effective focal length, you will lose part of the field of view, 
which is crucial for the look of the photo depending on the amount of 
peripheral distortion and look depending on the FL. I mean we all know that a 
portrait of a model shot at 50mm looks very different from a portrait shot at 
100mm or 200mm, with the model taking an equal amount of space in the shot. 
That matters to me when shooting so this cropped sensor mode won't do it for me.

<p>Not to be mean but some seriously miss-informed comments here... </p> 
<p>Mega Pixel&ne;picture quality. <br>
Size of PIXEL = image quality.</p> 
<p>The 16MP D4 has much larger pixels, which reduce noise, increase low light 
quality and make for better images then the 36MP D800.<br>
(for a reference the 
camera on the Hubble telescope is only 16MP but each pixel's GIANT)</p> 
<p>D800 is more versatile and adaptable to a variety of contexts, like a swiss 
army knife, its a generalist's tool.</p> 
<p>The D4 is more specific in application and therefore can have more 
constraints to its focus (weight, size, etc.) its a specialists tool</p> 
<p>Canon is 10x larger then Nikon, and the PRO camera market is just a tiny 
part of Canon's bizness.</p> 
<p>The Canon C300 only seems like a mistake to uninformed photographers... In 
the market of that particular camera, you have RED, Arri and Panavision, and 
the price ranges are $10k to $150K for similar quality. The C300 is well placed 
to provide additional rev for canon for a bag engineering project.</p>  Comment

<p>OK, there is control of brightness whilst shooting, but inability to alter

&quot;flou&quot; and mysterious.</p> 
<p>I am sure they'll fix it in an update, but it does mean that, for the time 
being at least, all you can do is use differential focus, but it is not as 
effective.</p> 
<p>You can work on the RAW files in Lightroom 4 now. I have done, and now that 
it has much improved control of black point and shadow areas like Aperture 3 
has had for ages, noise reduction is greatly improved.</p> 
<p>Sensor sensitivity dies fast in shadow areas: sensors lose detail faster 
than the cones in our eyes do, such that an image well-exposed has always an 
exaggerated unnaturally contrasty feel to it, caused but all of the BLACK specs 
that are only there because the software sets the point at which it turns 
things black too high. Try moving the black point to p-5, or -10. It helps.</p>

They can do it though when an external HDMI recorder is used.</p> 
<p>Regarding the Vignette Control it will most likely work in movies, however 
as we do not have either of these cameras in the office yet we cannot

<p>Physics works, and that's why I think, it will not deliver significant

D90 has sensor pixel pitch about 55um, 
D800 has about 48um so the pixel area of D800 is only aprox. 76% of D90s pixel 
area.<br>
Yes the CMOS technology have improved from the time of D90, so I 
think that the noise charcteristic of pixels would be simillar on both sensors.
<br>The only significant improvement is the image resolution of D800. It means

<p>Having checked high ISO RAW files up to 6400 from 400iso from a Russian 
site, if Nikon wanted me to endorse this machine, I would be delighted to do 
so. At low Isos up to around 200 it gives the same almost noiseless files that 
the Canon 1Ds MkII does and then at 320 and 400 noise begins to appear, but 
noise reduction can vanish it well enough. It can be used at 1600 at 100% with 
nr (I used Lightroom 4 which does these huge files), and the results are good 
enough at 100%.<br>
The colour is very good. As others have commented the 
problem is to acquire suitably sharp optics.<br>
As a creative's first line of 
defence it gets my vote, but the temptation of course, will be to use it at 1/2

<p>The D4 gains improved aperture control in movie mode, with the addition of 
'Power aperture'. This simply means that the user can adjust the aperture while 
recording video in the A and M exposure modes. It's also possible to set the 
aperture much more precisely in video live view mode before recording starts, 
in 1/8 stop incrementss using the Pv and Fn buttons on the front of the camera. 
In principle this should allow more exact matching of recording brightness 
across multiple camera / lens combinations.</p>

<p>...continued: But the main problem (at least in this preproduction camera) 
was the noise. Hi2 setting is realy unusable (and also the file size of such 
images is huuuuge, which tells the true story about the noise). Hi1 and ISO 
6400 is usable only in the critical situations where very bad image is better 
than no image. From ISO 3200 downwards the images on the display seem to be 
pretty OK. It is not possible to reduce resolution in the RAW mode, but only in 
JPG modes, so the noise reduction using the resolution reduction is possible 
only on the JPG workflow. Even Nikon demonstrator told us, that real noise of 
D800 on pixel level is aprox one EV worst than the D700 noise (for example 3200 
noise of D800 is near to 6400 noise of D700). On the other hand he told, that 
the print of the same size has one EV better noise from D800 than from D700 
thanks to bigger resolution.<br>
My conclusion from todays demonstration is, 
that I personaly shall wait for the D700 price drop and buy D700.<br>

very sofisticated design up to smallest details. I was allowed to take pictures 
inside the shop and play with the camera settings, but it was obviously not 
possible to take the pictures with me nor show them on the full resolution 
display (there was only HDTV with HDMI connection, so we were looking only at 
bigger copy of camera back display). Even in that simple configuration it was 
possible to induce moire very easily and my opinion is, that the E version is 
realy useles for the majority of normal photographers. It is much easier to 
sensitively sharpen the small percentage of D800 images which would gain from 
the D800E in postprocessing than to remove moire problems from the majority of 
D800E pictures taken in non natural sceneries.<br>

<p>I shoot with a Phase One DF/P30+ and really look forward to the versatility 
of the D800E. Even though the 'Phase gets to a high of 1600 ISO, in reality, I 
rarely use anything above 400. I smile when I read everyone's dismay at a 
useable ISO of only 3200 with the new Nikon! The MF really shines as a portrait 
tool and I will have to wait and see if the D800 will come close to the color 
rendition, warmth &amp; 3 dimensional quality of the 'Phase files... BUT... the 
shallow depth of field - lack of any real wide angles - laughable 'Live View' 
make it a very specialized camera, and had me ordering a D800E within hours of 
the announcement of it's launch. When I compare files from my long gone D3X to 
the 'Phase files it seems the D3X start to loose it beyond 100% where the 
'Phase files get to near 300% before they start to fall apart. I'm sure the 
lack of the AA filter plays a role here. My only real concern now is how well 
this new sensor copes with long exposures...</p>  3 upvotes <br>

<p>Totally agree with EcoPix and a D400. I'm thinking the same - it would be 
great to get some facts about a D400 - especially a 24mp D400 !</p>  0 upvotes 
<br>  By EcoPix (3 weeks ago) <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just typed D400 into this enormous thread and got nothing. 
I&rsquo;m surprised no one is placing this in a D400 context. It&rsquo;s hard 
to make a final judgment or purchase decision about this camera without knowing.
<br>If a D400 has the Sony 24mp DX sensor, with Nikon&rsquo;s NR prowess, 
I&rsquo;ll go for it (better corners with wides, more practical file size).<br>

If a 16mp DX, which is the logical D300 upgrade, then I&rsquo;d rather get a 
D7000 and a D800. I don&rsquo;t need two heavy-duty cameras.<br>
If Nikon pull 
a wildcard and make the D400 a prosumer full-frame D4, as the D700 lovers want, 
that would make more sense of both D7000 and D800 market placement. But Nikon 
might be shy of doing that!<br>
If no D400 at all, the choice is simple.<br>

Any which way, it&rsquo;s hard for many of us to choose the D800 without the 
context of the complete revamped Nikon system. I wish they&rsquo;d just be 
honest with us and lay their cards fully on the table. Then we could plan our 
finances and kits. It&rsquo;s such a silly game!</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>From DPR Preview: &quot;We're not all that excited by a Picture Style 
button on the D800's rear but we can see it being useful, especially - again - 
for videographers.&quot;</p> 
<p>Not sure why the reviewer felt the need to add something negative here as 
the Picture Styles button seems to double as an Image Protect button. And I 
don't remember them knocking the Canon 5D Mk II for having a dedicated Picture 
Style button. The fact is without such a button the user would have to dive in 
the menu to change from a Standard profile to a flat one for video. Or for JPEG 
shooters, and saturated profile for say a grey, cloudy day. This is a big deal, 
and one reason the 5D Mk II includes such a button. So while DPR is &quot;not 
excited&quot; about this button, how many negative review points would we read 
about the need to menu dive if Nikon had omitted this external control?</p>  2

<p>We have to remember that these resolutions have been available since the 
Nikon D7000. What begs the questions is how come the D4 has a mere 16.2MP - 
less than the 2003 designed Canon 1Ds MkII.</p> 
<p>Frames per second is a reason, possibly (could fit better faster RAM in 
D800?- of course they could).<br>
But there's a class thing operating here, as 
with Canon.If you buy a 5D MkII, as Rockwell also pointed out years ago, 
low-contrast fine detail is smooths away.<br>
Skin textures, floorboards, 
fabrics etc have little or no texture or detail.Jpegs are a joke.</p> 
<p>Pay &pound;3500 more for a 1Ds MkIII and magically all the detail comes 
back. Amazing!! But at 400iso and above it is bad.</p> 
<p>Are Nikon using interpolation to uprez the D800 sensor output AND reduce 
quality, whilst making it n times slower? forcing pros and IQ conscious types 
to the D4, which Jessops say will be stocked in only stores Nikon select. Is 
this a class thing?</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>both Canon and Nikon have technical problems (lack the knowhow) to readout 
at fast speed, the main reason why the shame 18/16MP low resolution.</p> 
<p>at the same time, photographers also have problems to beam the huge data 
back via Internet (one reason people use JPEG), so many will still use low 
resolution output from a 30-60MP camera.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>Yes Marike, where there is little contrast the details vanish. I bought 
one. I KNOW. Go to my galleries and see the detail at 100% from a RAW file, 
lightroom processed, and notice how the stripes vanish in tonally flat areas. 
My 1Ds MkII does not do this, nor does the 1Ds Mkiii which has the same sensor

<p>And, before Occam cuts himself shaving, please note that the framerates are

 By munro harrap (2 weeks ago) <br>

<p>And the iD MkIV Canon has 16MP and can push files through at 10fps, so, 
yes, it is crippled. Nothing wrong with that. WHO needs more than 4fps? Are you 
taking the photograph, or is the camera?<br>
Even for sports etc, shutter lag 
is far more important . This is not bad . Not as fast as the original 1D from 
2002 (0.039) or the Sony R1 mirrorless (0.007), but fast enough.Double the 
speed of the Canon 5D MkII.</p> 
<p>The reason pros will go for the D4 is that their employers buy them, and 
due to concerns about loss of detail and texture due to the pixel count.</p> 
<p>Me, I think it may be absolutely wonderful IF the texture and detail is ALL 
there at 1600iso, and if it is possible to lighten and darken the image whilst 
filming. This Power Aperture thing does bother me. It seems you cannot change 
anything during filming- you have to stop and start again. And no news on 
whether like the 5D MkII , it corrects the video image for vignetting. No sign 
yet Nikon do this, and it is necessary, unfortunately.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>We don't know what readout speed is from the 36 MP sensor, but keep in mind 
that these are larger than usual components (in terms of mainstream chip 
design, this is a specialized, low volume part) that have not been benefiting 
from die shrink the at the rate that processors have. More pixels = more 
resistance = more heat = more noise. The 1Dmkiv is just as noisy as the 5Dmkii. 
I suspect that the 1Dx and D4 will have new tech to combat noise and maintain 
their high readout speed, but there are limits to what is technically feasible 
today. Tommorow...we'll see.</p> 
<p>And also keep in mind that AF puts a limit on frame rate. The 1Dx can flap 
the mirror at 14fps, but it can't focus that fast. Focus in SLRs relies on a 
sub-mirror, which must be in place and not shaking uncontrollably in order for 
sensors in the base of the mirror box to read off of. 12fps is probably at the 
physical limits of design right now. Same with shutters. Mechanical stuff only 
goes so fast with current tech.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>@munro harrap I'm sorry you had this experience with the 5D MK II, but you

doubt it. I have a 5D Mk II and detail is NOT smoothed away. Sorry.</p>  0

<p>I understand what Munro'is talking about, but I think it&rsquo;s a 
background, obligatory noise reduction rather than some photographic 
proletariat repression in the name of exaltation.<br>
I first knew it in the 
Kodak SLR/n, in which it was very noticeable. I now see it in my 5D2 files, but 
it's of no real significance there. I think any common print process would 
loose it.<br>
I don&rsquo;t see it in D800 files, and the minor grittiness I 
see in base ISO skies is actually reassuring for that reason. It means 
they&rsquo;re not fiddling with the image. Nikon are saying to hell with this 
tiny amount of noise, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But they&rsquo;re free to make a 
specialist instrument.<br>
The 5D2 had to please everyone from landscape &amp; 
still lifers to the available light set for which the noise mattered at higher 
gains. A good snappy lens does overcome it to all practical purposes.<br>
BTW, 
a casual glance at the D800E files will banish concern that there&rsquo;s 
interpolation happening, unless Phase One are also interpolating!</p>  Comment

<p>The D4 'only' has 16mp because the owners of that body (professionals) 
demand more than those who will be buying the 36mp consumer oriented D800.<br>

As for the image processing speed and its effect on maximum fps, well the D800 
can't do any more than 4fps because of the enormous calculations and 
corrections that have to be done to get acceptable image quality from a 36mp 
sensor.<br>
(yabokkie) Both Canon and Nikon went with lower mp sensors in their 
'top-of-the-line' bodies because they have finally conceded that mp's do not 
equal image quality as measured by dynamic range, color accuracy, noise 
performance, and image resolve. That is not to say that future sensor 
technology will never be able to compensate the limitations of physics. Though 
it is hopefully a sign that Canon, Nikon, Sony, etc are done with the pursuit, 
and will get back to advancing digital photography as an improvement over film 
- instead of a 'post-processing required' alternative.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>Alternative to post-scanning &amp; spotting film? <br>
May I revise my 
earlier comment for the record? I can&rsquo;t find any reference to background 
NR in the Canon 5D2. I see the effect, but I&rsquo;m not a camera engineer. It 
might be NR, or simpler.<br>
Maybe it&rsquo;s just the AA filter losing 
microdetail below a certain degree of robustness? In jpegs, the effect&rsquo;s 
probably amplified by sharpening &ndash; ie, the algorithm can &ldquo;latch on 
to&rdquo; the higher-contrast areas, which are bumped up by sharpening, but low 
contrast areas are left alone to be averaged.<br>
A really cracking lens, eg. a 
micro, seems to &ldquo;punch through&rdquo; and retain the texture, even in 
jpegs.<br>
I can vouch that the 5D2 beats the old 1Ds2 in fine texture detail. 
I can&rsquo;t comment on the 5D2 / 1Ds3, but dpReview concluded from rigorous 
testing that they&rsquo;re the same. It probably gets down to how the user sets 
up the cameras.<br>
Also it&rsquo;s possible for sensors to be out of 
collimation &ndash; I have a D200 that showed exactly that effect. It needed 
adjustment by Nikon.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>By the way, on the weekend I did a 5D2/D800E compo with similar subject 
matter &ndash; an outdoor scene. I carefully shot a 5D2 image, made with a 
micro-Nikkor at f8, and step-interpolated with sharpening to the D800 size. 
Then I compared it side by side at 100% view to the similar downloaded D800E 
file (70-200@160 f8, both jpeged raw).<br>
Comparing 21.7mp/ light-AA to 
36mp/no-AA, in this test the D800E shot certainly showed an increase in fine 
detail, but the difference wasn&rsquo;t as great as one might expect &ndash; a 
bit more texture and definition in fine twigs.</p>  0 upvotes <br>

<p>Nikon doesn't build every camera for every photographer. If they did they 
would only need one camera. As it is they have something like 12 dSLR cameras 
currently in their line-up, as I don't believe that the D3000, D5000, D90, 
D700, D3x and D3s have been dropped from the line-up.</p> 
<p>That's a big selection from a company that has suffered from multiple 
catastrophic natural disasters of late. The supply chain may be slower, but it 
hasn't stopped.</p> 
<p>So, I think Nikon has a lot of bases covered and I don't see a lot of valid 
reasons for the carping about feature choices or corporate greed, etc.</p>

<p>re the comment in this article:<br>
 'D4 owners interested in the D800 as a 
second body have the option of running the camera using the D4's EN-EL18 
battery.......we can't think of many situations where you'd want to take a 
charged battery out of a D4 and swap it into a second body of almost the same 
size and weight, but......it could mean that users of a D4/D800 combo might 
only need to carry one charger around'<br>
i think dpreview is missing the 
point - what professional has only one battery for his(/her) camera (i have 3) 
so with this combination they need only carry one TYPE set of batteries instead 
of one set for the D4 and another set for the D800 (and of course only one 
charger as you mentioned) .....and thinking about it what a great combination 
these 2 cameras are for a pro - one with massive low light capabilities and 
frame-rate and the other with massive pixel count (&amp; portability without 
the vertical grip if needed!) - i love it - best of both worlds - i want one of
