<p>This Nikon D5000 review shows a very strong entry-level DSLR camera that 
works well for beginner and intermediate photographers.</p> Nikon <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3> 
<p>The Nikon D5000 DSLR camera is a camera that generated a lot of buzz upon 
its release. After I had a chance to review theNikon D5000, I can understand 
the reason for the buzz.</p> 
<p>The D5000 is one of the best entry-level DSLR cameras I've had the chance 
to use. Much of the technology behind the D5000 is based on theNikon D300, 
which is a slightly older, much more expensive DSLR camera. For that technology 
to have trickled down to the D5000 already is beneficial for beginning and 
intermediate photographers.</p> 
<p>The best thing about the D5000 is it works well in fully manual mode, fully 
auto mode, or anything in between.</p> <br>

<h3>Pros</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Image quality is excellent</li> 
<li>D5000 provides great mix of manual control and ease of use for a DSLR</li> 
<li>LCD can twist and swivel away from the camera</li> 
<li>Battery life is good for DSLR camera</li> 
<li>Good collection of printed materials - quick start guide and user guide
</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Learning the function of each button could be time consuming</li> 
<li>Autofocus can be slow, especially in low light</li> 
<li>Experienced photographers will want more features</li> 
<li>LCD could use more resolution</li> </ul>

<li><b>Maximum image size:</b> 4288 x 2848 pixels</li> 
<li><b>Battery:</b> Li-ion (rechargable)</li> 
<li><b>Dimensions:</b> 4.1 x 5.0 x 3.1 inches</li>

<h3>Guide Review - Nikon D5000 DSLR Review</h3> 
<h3>Image Quality</h3> With an effective 12.3 megapixels of resolution and 
with a high-qualityimage sensor, the D5000 has excellent image quality. With 
the D5000,RAW images are of a better quality than JPEG images. 
<p>My D5000 review unit included an 18mm-55mm equivalent interchangeable lens, 
which had sharp focus and image quality. This lens worked great for wide angle 
shots; you'd want a different lens for telephoto shots, though. The lens 
focused clearly, both automatically and manually.</p> 
<h3>Performance</h3> 
<p>Start-up times are fast for the D5000, which doesn't always occur with a 
DSLR. At times, the autofocus doesn't work very fast, especially with low-light 
photography, but it is accurate.</p> 
<p>You can use the LCD (called &quot;live view&quot;) or the optical 
viewfinder to frame photos, but autofocus is slower when using live view, which 
is common among DSLR models.</p> 
<p>The in-camera editing features are easy to apply. </p> 
<h3>Design</h3> 
<p>I found the D5000 easy to hold and use with the 18mm-55mm lens. The 
camera's weight is balanced nicely, and all of the buttons and lens rings were 
easily within reach. However, for those looking for their first DSLR camera, 
it's worth testing the D5000 (or any DSLR model) before buying it, as DSLR 
cameras are vastly different in operational technique, size, and weight than
ultra compact point and shoot models. </p> 
<p>The D5000 works very well in fully automatic mode, including the autofocus 
feature of the lens. However, if you want to learn more about photography, 
configuring the D5000'smanual control features is easy, and the camera shows 
the settings used during image playback.</p> 
<p>Finally, the D5000 includes an LCD that can be tilted and rotated away from 
the camera body, which is nice. You also can rotate the LCD next to the camera 
body, protecting the LCD when not using the camera. Unfortunately, the LCD's 
resolution is less than some DSLR models.</p> <br>

<strong>Great 
Camera</strong>, Member Rafatkhan 
<p>Photographs are the memories and views on paper and D-5000 from NIKON 
brings out the images on paper. A camera par excellance. Good to shoot at any 
conditions. One should be proud to have one.</p> Write a review
