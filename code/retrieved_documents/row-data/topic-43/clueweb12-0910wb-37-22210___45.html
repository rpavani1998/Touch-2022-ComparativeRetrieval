<h3>Fuji X PRO 1 gets price and preorder option. A serious OM-D contender?</h3>
<p></p> 
<p>There is now a final price and preorder option for the Fuji X PRO 1:<br>
 
$1699 atAmazon US (Click here), Adorama (Click here) and BHphoto (Click here).
<br> Lenses are available too at Amazon (Click here), Adorama (Click here) and 
BHphoto (Click here). </p> 
<p>Along the Sony NEX-7 ($1200) this will become the main competitor of the 
Olympus OM-D which rumored price is around $1100. I have no clue if the X PRO 1 
will sell well with that price. And I guess there will be a tuff battle between 
the OM-D and that camera. Based on rumors and early X PRO 1 test (SeeFujirumors
) I guess that this is the advantages-disadvantages list:</p> 
<p><strong>Olympus OM-D advantages:</strong><br>
 - Cheaper<br>
 - Weather 
sealed<br>
 - Better video quality<br>
 - Super fast autofocus<br>
 - Smaller 
body (if you care about size)<br>
 - Lens line up (and powerzoom lens 
availability)<br>
 - built-in stabilization<br>
 - tilting LCD</p> 
<p><strong>Fuji X PRO 1 advantages:</strong><br>
 - Superb image quality<br>
 
- Hybrid viewfinder</p> 
<p>But this is just a list based on rumors and not yet tested cameras. But I 
want to hear your thoughts on this!</p>

<p>At $2,300.00 not in the same price category,</p> 
<p>Not an auto-focus contender if first reports bear out,</p> 
<p>Not a size contender as it&rsquo;s closer to the D3100.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to see about the rest.</p> 
<ul>

<p>Agreed. Currently has only 3 (native) lenses, and it&rsquo;s not even 
weather sealed .</p>

<p>The turf battle will be between the &ldquo;E-M5&Prime; and the NEX-7, and 
Olympus will price under that, as the NEX-7 has a larger sensor.<br>
 Camera 
prices relate to positioning as much as actual cost, no one surely believes the 
E-P3 cost twice as much to produce as the E-PM1?<br>
 The new Olly will compare 
really well against the NEX-7, especially being weatherproof, if it&rsquo;s $50 
cheaper.</p> </li>

<p>But, those first three lenses are pretty nice, as far as specs go. You have 
to admit, Fuji believes in this system and they are doing it right immediately 
out of the box. Something the other companies don&rsquo;t do! Instead of 
starting with crappy kit lenses they are going straight for the high end&hellip;
</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<h4>Berneck1</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>Higher price aside, this is very much a contender. To me, the X PRO 1 is a 
photographer&rsquo;s camera in its purest form. It&rsquo;s simplicity is what 
makes it close to a perfect camera. I hope the OM-D comes close to that 
simplicity, although it&rsquo;s harder because you won&rsquo;t have aperture 
dials on the lenses. So far, I like what I see.</p> </li>

<p>Agree completely&hellip; the Fuji looks great, but it is a bit of a chunky 
brick.</p> 
<p>I really hope that the OM-D is the same size, roughly, as the E-P3 
(assuming of course a little bump extra on top), so m4/3 maintains its size 
advantage.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>I have invested in the Nikon system and the m43 system (&ldquo;big&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;small&rdquo;). The Fuji looks very nice, and I would have seriously 
considered if this would be my first or second system. But I don&rsquo;t think 
there is room for a third, in between, system.</p> </li>

<p>It&rsquo;s still a different camera than the yet-to-be-seen OM-D series, 
more expensive and likely meant for more leisurely shooting, not stabilized, 
not weatherproof, but probably capable of very high image quality. It&rsquo;s 
competition, but it&rsquo;s also competition with Leica.</p> </li>

<p>First thing I don&rsquo;t understand is how Olympus were able to price the 
camera so low. They had priced the E-5 around 1700 EUR , body only and the E-P3 
at 1000 EUR with (old ) kit lens. Now this one at 1000 EUR with kit 
lens&hellip;something looks strange to me. I hope they haven&rsquo;t done any 
cost cutting in the wrong areas and that this does not affect the durability of 
the cameras, which I think was very good on E-system cameras. I would have 
expected the OM-D to cost around 1300-1400 EUR with the kit lens which would 
have been in line with other semi-pro full weather sealed bodies.</p>

<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re trying to make up for over-pricing the E-p3?</p>

<p>Maybe Fuji is priced too high? Along with V1, G1x.</p> 
<ul>

<h4>Z</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>a) Fuji overprices since they are aiming for a niche market, and likely not 
mass producing, as this is a brand new product for them. They need to pay back 
the high R&amp;D cost.</p> 
<p>b) Olympus likely already have decent estimates of how much the OMD will 
sell as m4/3 market is much more mature and better defined. Hence they can 
produce it at higher quantities and at a lower cost. Also much of the 
development cost (lenses, system) has already been paid back over the last 
couple years.</p> 
<p>Olympus/Panasonic are the Canon/Nikon of the mirror less systems! They can 
be much more competitive.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>Retro brick isn&rsquo;t any replacement for any of the above bottom level 
4/3 DLSRs so why should it cost as much?<br>
 Lack of modern control layout and 
ergonomy isn&rsquo;t valid reason for that.</p>

<p>[Repeating what I've stated on &quot;Olympus 12-50mm in Stock at BHphoto 
(updated GX1 status)&quot;]</p> 
<p>With 12-50 MSRPing at $500, there is no way OM-D bundled with this lens can 
be sold for $1150-1300 as rumor suggested as that would mean OM-D&rsquo;s body 
price is the same or lower than E-P3&prime;s.</p> 
<p>OM-D is either going to be boundled with 14-42mm or 17mm for $1200+ or 
$1150-1300 for body alone.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <br>

<h4>Rob</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>The E-P3&prime;s kit 14-42mm lens is $299 if you buy it separately. You 
can&rsquo;t necessarily subtract the cost of the lens from the bundle and get 
the body-only price.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <br>

<h4>Pei</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>The 14-42 is going for $120 on eBay and that&rsquo;s the actual street 
price. Who is going to pay $300 for lens that&rsquo;s forces on you every time 
you buy an Olympus?</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<h4>Jonko</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>Buying a kit lens separately without a body has always cost a lot more than 
the price difference between the body only camera and the camera with kit lens.

<h4>Pei</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>This is the only weather sealed m4/3 lens and the only powered Olympus 
lens. It is as kit lens as Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM is. Olympus will 
not try to discount this lens much so I doubt the price rumored includes the 
lens.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>$1700 is quite a niche non-professional camera in digital times, when 
equipment gets outdated in 2 years max. I would buy only if I can make money 
with it.</p>

<p>$1700 is close to the $200 where you can buy FF DSLR cameras. Hmmm&hellip;

<p>Exactly, and FF DSLR is a tool that designed for business, not leisure.</p>

<p>Full frames are selliing around $2000 right now, because they are already 3 
years old. Newer offerings from Nikon, Canon, Sony will cost $3000 (body only).
</p> 
<p>$1500-$1700 is still the semi pro zone and this is where, I think the OM-D 
( with lens) should be priced with its weather sealing, and magnesium body.</p>

<p>Yes, but Fuji claims that it&rsquo;s APSC sensor offers the same IQ as FF 
cameras, so in their logic it makes sense. Same IQ, less weight and less 
cumbersome and 200$ less, less gimmicky controls, I&rsquo;ll take one if the 
focus is fast enough !</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>Outdated in 2 years? Still plenty of people shooting with Canon 1DsII 
(released 2004) and 1DsIII (released 2008). The ones who feel the need to 
constantly upgrade are generally amateurs who obsess over dpreview and dxomark, 
while the pros are out shooting and making money.</p>

<p>pingflood, Fuji is nowhere near the camera that pro&rsquo;s will be using 
_for work_.</p>

<h4>pingflood</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>That was not my point. My point was that the whole &ldquo;outdated in 2 
years&rdquo; is something created by the people endlessly obsessing over 100% 
crops and noise data keep perpetuating, and is no doubt loved and encouraged by 
the manufacturers. The people who are busy shooting professionally don&rsquo;t 
waste time pouring over dxomark scores and comparisons, but rather pick the 
tools that are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; to do the job. Fact is, for the vast 
majority of people any camera made since, oh, 2004 or so is indeed &ldquo;good 
enough&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>The same people complaining about the noise visible in 100% crop of an ISO 
3200 shot has likely never PRINTED one of those shots. Even at 
13&times;19&Prime; prints, what looks like a &ldquo;too noisy&rdquo; image on 
the computer can make for excellent output.</p>

<p>@Pingflood please don&rsquo;t waste your/my time with your &ldquo;good 
enough&rdquo; drivel, it is insulting to people that are passionate about 
cameras and camera technology. I for one use a GF1 and a 7D for professional 
work and would love to get a 4/3 camera with better DXOmark scores. DXO scores 
are accurate a GF1 is not as good as a 7D but a Nex7 is, and that is my next 
camera. Unless the Fuji or the OMD gets high DXO scores.</p>

<h4>bilgy_no1</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>@Cansalt</p> 
<p>This is a bit sick: choosing the camera based on DXO sensor score.</p> 
<p>1) It says nothing about real results<br>
 2) there&rsquo;s more to a 
camera than just the sensor: how about lenses for a start?<br>
 3) All modern 
cameras produce excellent results, so choose one that suits you, and 
don&rsquo;t obsess over quasi scientific tests.<br>
 4) just enjoy shooting 
images.</p> </li> 
<li> <br>

<h4>pingflood</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>@Cansalt: You make it fairly clear what type of photographer you are when 
you quote wanting &ldquo;better DXOmark scores&rdquo; as the reason for a new 
camera, rather than better images. VERY few photographers today are limited by 
their gear in any way, and those who claim to be are either delusional or on 
the very cutting edge of some small niche. I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to figure 
out which category you fall under.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <br>

<h4>Cansalt</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>@Pingflood I did not make it clear enough but when I said that the DXO 
marks are accurate, I meant that in my experience the GF1 does not have a good 
enough sensor to replace my 7D. I wish it did. I have tested the GF1 in studio, 
and on assignment. I have compared several controlled shots from the GF1 
against the 7D and concluded that it falls short. Then I discovered DXO and it 
backed up my conclusions. The GF1 shines as a street shooting and family 
camera. The 4/3 system needs better sensors. period. I for one go on this site 
to see when we are going to get a better camera body (thus a better DXO mark 
score). Please explain to me why you frequent this site if your camera 
equipment is more than adequate. This is a future product (camera) rumors site.

<p>It&rsquo;s SLR + m4/3 for me. Not to undermine the small system because 
both can do some serious photography, just differently. It&rsquo;s nice because 
normally lens-size is a big factor even for SLR, and that limits things. But 
having both i can just say i have m43 for that, and get whatever size glass i 
need for my SLR.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

cameras with the GF670, which is aimed at fans of 1930s German Folders. Too bad

<p>Well..it is sort of impossible to compare an actual camera (XPro1)with a 
bunch of rumors. Duh.<br>
 I have to say&hellip;based on the lack of critical 
sharpness in the images coming from the Fuji Website and now the private sector 
I am VERY disappointed in the level of quality from the Fuji. I may just be 
seeing images with too much NR&hellip;but the Leica images downsized to 
compete&hellip;BLOW IT AWAY. Too bad.<br>
 Throw in the cost, lack of lenses 
(right now) and slow focus&hellip;and what initially sounded quite 
exciting&hellip;is not something I am drawn to. I thought I would have been.<br>
 I will keep my FF DSLR Kit and my MFT&hellip;.My mind might change somewhat if 
I could see some razor sharp images from the camera.</p>

<p>Charlie&hellip;(posted above you&hellip;sorry), I REALLY want XPro1 to be 
stellar too&hellip;.maybe I am missing something. I say&hellip;just keep my 
extensive MFT kit with all these lenses&hellip;and hang in until a camera comes 
out with more DR and we are good. If that happens the MFT cameras I have now 
can dance circles around the Fuji from a performance standpoint! What we need 
is dynamic range&hellip;(which the Fuji sensor has in spades). If we can have 
that, why go elsewhere?</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>What does BLOW IT AWAY mean? I see lovely printed images from small sensors 
such as m4/3 in magazines all the time (Japanese enthusiast mags like Camera 
Life, f5.6, etc). There is no absolute standard in IQ, it&rsquo;s all 
subjective.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<h4>Zonkie</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>I think $1100 will be body only price. Still considerably cheaper than the 
Fuji. Add to the advantages already listed the in-body IS and it&rsquo;s a much 
better deal than the Fuji (on paper). If, and only if, the sensor does deliver 
a very good performance as rumored (it doesn&rsquo;t have to match the Fuji one 
that&rsquo;s bigger, but should be within 1 f-stop behind).</p> 
<p>The advantage in resolution (due to no AA filter) and high ISO (due to 
APS-C sensor size) of the Fuji should not be too important compared to the kind 
of advantages that the OM-D might have. Honestly, if all is true about the OM-D 
I think that Olympus really has a winner this time.</p> 
<p>The NEX-7? A good competitor to the OM-D, with better IQ (if you shoot 
raw), but IMO with less appeal to photographers than an Olympus camera. Also 
not weather sealed, no in-body IS, few lenses,&hellip;</p> 
<p>I hope that Panasonic will join the party too with a great camera coming 
soon!</p> </li>

<p>Wow, wow slow down admin. We don&rsquo;t even know what the Fuji can do,

little more conservative with interpreting the rumors!</p> </li>

<p>Opposite to Bob B. I think the Fuji images I&rsquo;ve seen have stellar IQ. 
Many others on the net percieves them as I do. The Fuji will have better IQ (DR 
+ High ISO) than the OM-D (larger sensor + no AA filter. It is though a very 
special camera that not everyone need/can handle. The hybrid VF is very 
important to some as is the IQ.<br>
 The OM-D is more mainstream, the first 
(?)mature m43 camera that is more multi-purpose. Super AF speed is not on top 
of everybodys requirements list. Will it really deliver in the image side with 
improved DR?<br>
 It (the OM-D) may be it is a better built camera and with a 
little better IQ compared to G3/GX1. &ndash; And better EVF and speed. This may 
be enough for an upgrade for some, but not for me.</p>

<p>+10 I agree with you</p> 
<p> Fuji made their camera as A Photography tool rather than Panny 
[G3,GX1,GF3]which just made a camera like A COMPUTER TOYS WITH A LENS.</p> 
<p> Fuji is a Camera maker who knows exactly the need of photographer,..see 
the example ,.with the lens they comes up,..ALL OF THEM IS FIXED LENS&rsquo; 
,.again compare to Panny who just make another TOY with POWER ZOOM ,.NO FAST 
APERTURE as for the improovement,,the image quality is not better than the old 
14-45.</p> 
<p>even the newest GX1 has SMEARED COLOR,AND LESS DETAIL THAN THE OUTSTANDING 
GF1,.If have to say ,.there no progress what so ever in the term of image 
quality for the past 2 years,..</p>

<p>Agree with deniz. For me, the biggest drawback to the Fuji was focus by 
wire. I realise m43 system also &lsquo;suffers&rsquo; from this, but at least 
their CDAF isn&rsquo;t so bad, and I kind of accept it in a &lsquo;small&rsquo; 
system.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Fuji is a Camera maker who knows exactly the need of 
photographer&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about this. At $1700 USD, I need a camera featuring a 
accurate, superbly fast auto focus system. I do need a camera which assists me 
to focus manually efficiently and precisely, like what Canon or Nikon offer in 
their $1000 &ndash; $2000 bodies.</p> 
<p>I also want a camera offering me a wide range of lens.</p> 
<p>At $1700, I also would like to have 3D server focus, like what OM-D, Nikon, 
or Cannon have.</p> 
<p>Great IQ may be useless if you have poor focus system.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind buying a $1700 body as long as its price tag makes 
sense. When we buy almost $2000 camera system, we should evaluate the whole 
performance. We don&rsquo;t evaluate just the image quality and ISO, do we?</p>

<p>the price is just not fair, all people wanted was an x100 without bugs and 
the ability to take off the built in lens and change it.<br>
 it should have 
been 1100$ like the x100 with a kit lens prime<br>

<p>Sample images from the Fuji are starting to appear, and the consensus 
(which I share) is that the image quality isn&rsquo;t as impressive as the 
rumors had fantasized. It has plus and minus points, but in terms of overall 
image quality it looks as if it will be on a par with other good small-sensor 
16mp cameras.</p> 
<p>So far the new Olympus is strictly a vaporcamera, so it&rsquo;s a bit silly 
to compare the performance of something which we know only on the basis of 
hearsay (the Fuji) to something we don&rsquo;t know at all (the Olympus.)</p> 
<p>But it does seem to me that after everything shakes out in this 
newly-emerging &ldquo;premium mirrorless&rdquo; segment, the Fuji will sell 
mostly to people who value its traditional-style design, construction and 
controls; the Sony NEX-7 will sell to advanced-tech fans; and the Olympus will 
fall somewhere in between. That may in fact turn out to be the best place to 
be: A blend of classic feel and modern tech is probably what most of the 
customers in this segment really want.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, I can&rsquo;t help wondering what Panasonic will do. They 
certainly have the capability to design and build any kind of camera that they 
think will sell, and they can&rsquo;t help having noticed that there&rsquo;s 
money to be made here. The GX-1 has gotten good reviews, and a &ldquo;GX 
Pro&rdquo; with a built-in EVF and a few other goodies surely couldn&rsquo;t be 
too much of a stretch for them&hellip;</p>

<p>But is the GH2 working? I&rsquo;ve never seen it high on the Amazon sales 
list or the Japanese BCN rankings. And while some people clearly do love the 
current shape, it seems just as many complain that it&rsquo;s not a 
rangefinder-like form factor.</p> 
<p>Clearly the NEX-7 has generated far more buzz than the GH2 ever did, and 
when it comes down to it, what really is the difference between them other than 
the shape/design?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly the NEX-7 has generated far more buzz than the GH2 ever 
did&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Clearly you don&rsquo;t remember the GH2-mania when it first appeared 
&mdash; people were calling Panasonic and waiting on hold for hours trying to 
get their shipping status; forums were burning up with messages about &ldquo;I 
just bought one at Dealer X and they said they have two more&rdquo; followed by 
barrages of phone calls; forums also were burning with angry complaints about 
mixed messages from Panasonic (&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s shipping/no, it 
isn&rsquo;t shipping yet&rdquo;) etc., etc. I went through all that.</p> 
<p>Yes, &ldquo;the buzz&rdquo; certainly died down after that &mdash; 
Panasonic eventually got its distribution sorted out, and those of us who 
wanted a GH2 were able to get them and since then we&rsquo;ve quietly been 
making nice pictures and videos with them. Same is going to happen with the 
NEX-7 and the Fuji and every other new camera.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>I was thinking about getting the GX1 to replace my aging GF1, and was 
intrigued by X Pro 1 and OM-D. However, X Pro 1 is simply too expensive for a 
non-micro 4/3 camera, and while its image quality may be superior, I might be 
better off buyinga dSLR. And for OM-D&hellip;. unless its quality is much more 
superior than the GX1, it is too expensive for a retro design.</p> </li>

<p>JSB. I am not the only one who thinks that the files lack sharpness. I was 
a commercial photographer for over 30 years. Product illustration, etc. I like 
Fuji as a company I used their lenses on my view cameras for years. I now just 
shoot for the enjoyment and use a 5DMkII and some MFT equipment.<br>
 I think 
that the sensor has incredible dynamic range and the colors are really 
vibrant&hellip;but the images I have seen are not critically sharp. IMO. For 
$3500 for a kit with three lenses&hellip;it should all be there.</p>

<p>Admin, don&rsquo;t get carried away. The Fuji does not have to compete 
against the Olympus at its price point. The high ISO prints that Fuji presented 
already demonstrate that the image quality at high ISO values beats much larger 
sensors than its own. It will be very disappointing to keep up hopes for a MFT 
camera to even get close to that.</p> 
<p>I have some money to spend on new tech toys this year and I&rsquo;ll 
probably go with the Fuji and the 35mm lens. If the auto-focus is fast enough 
that is &ndash; and it doesn&rsquo;t need to be close to the PEN&rsquo;s or 
OM-D&rsquo;s performance. I already own an E-5 which is fast enough for me 
(probably still beats a PEN in real life situations). What I want is a small 
(enough) camera with excellent image quality at low light. I place my bets with 
Fuji for that.</p>

either, but they sure were listening when they came up with their latest gear. 
I will agree, however, that the Fuji and Olympus have the same

low noise performance. But, if holding up your flexibility flag helps you sleep

respect that. I have even considered moving away from the system, myself. There 
are still some times that I miss my 40D. However, the balance of size and image 
quality is what I like, so I deal with the things I dislike. Everything seems 
to have a compromise in some way.</p> 
<p>My point is that characterizing the OM-D as a &ldquo;rumored enthusiast

people wanting to compare it to cmaeras that are not in its league. First it 
was the new Nikon D4 and now it&rsquo;s the new pro Fuji. Me calling it a point 
&amp; shoot is akin to others comparing it to a D4 or the Fuji. What I find so 
surprising is how quick others like you are to come to its defence. Olympus 
makes great cameras but have yet to make one that is worth comparing to the new

<p>If I was shooting digital like them it would be no question that I would

<p>No competition really since these are two very different camera&rsquo;s. 
The small micro 4/3 sensor can never give good enough image quality at settings 
above ISO200. The Fuji will probably destroy the Olympus image quality five 
times over. However, autofocus is very disappointing on the Fuji and very good 
on the Olympus, even if it&rsquo;s exactly the same as on the current PEN 
series. I just can&rsquo;t understand why Fuji did not make the AF speed and 
accuracy better on this new expensive camera. The camera feels clumsy. Such a 
nice tool seriously crippled by a failing AF system. Well, at least it leaves 
something to be desired and it will be a good reason to upgrade to the next X 
camera. You can always wait a few months and buy a secondhand Olympus or Fuji 
for about 2/3 of the price. The Fuji X100 is now worth about 750 euros 
secondhand and in perfect condition. Price should come down a little more over 
the next few months to about 500-600 euros. Especially now the slightly 
superior XPro-1 is here.</p>

<p>Admin,<br>
 Do you have any information about whether Olympus will announce 
any new lenses with the OM-D? I ask because I don&rsquo;t see the point of 
putting a plastic lens on a a premium body. Yes, there is the 12mm, but that is 
one lens, it isn&rsquo;t weather sealed, and it&rsquo;s silver, which looks 
awful (imo) on a black body.</p> 
<p>Alternately, do you think Olympus sees the OM-D as &ldquo;the chosen 
one&rdquo; i.e. the one that will unite 4/3 and m4/3. I could see this given 
that they are coming out with a weatherproof adapter. If you want high (build) 
quality optics you use 4/3, if you want light you use m4/3.</p> </li>

<p>I wonder which one we can buy first. Not just order. Fuji is somewhat slow 
in getting product out to someplaces, though not as bad as Panasonic is 
sometimes.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>What would it take to upgrade my new E-P3 to the &ldquo;OMG&rdquo;?<br>
 * 
significant improvement in DR (2 steps may be ok&hellip; is that a logarithmic 
scale?)<br>
 * some improvement in high ISO performance<br>
 * built-in EVF<br>

 * faster/tracking AF at some 6fps<br>
 * still a small/compact system<br>
 * 
better button lay-out<br>
 * not too expensive<br>
 * built-in flash that can 
control other flashes<br>
 * better battery than in the E-P3</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s it. Of course, bonuses would be:<br>
 * improved video support
<br> * fast AF of 43 lenses &mdash; I haven&rsquo;t invested in such, but 
realize there are several top notch 43 lenses,<br>
 * weather sealing is very 
positive<br>
 * 16 Mpx is ok, but not really important<br>
 * I&rsquo;d like 
some support for GPS/tagging<br>
 * It would be nice if it looks good. </p> 
<p>Thus I do not require all rumors to be true.</p> </li>

<p>I do not own any of the EPs (none). Only the Panasonic cams.</p> 
<p>OMG has to be better than (ie., better sensor) the GH-2 and as versatile 
(ie., swivel LCD. Fixed one will not cut it even if it is OLED). I do not want 
a &ldquo;pro&rdquo; bodice. Plastic is fine if it lasts for &gt;2 years before 
the next one comes along. Lack of &ldquo;weather sealing&rdquo; (only God knows 
what that means!) did not affect the operation of G1 or GH-2s. I hate 
Panasonic&rsquo;s battery policy. That is a plus for Olympus (the only plus, I 
can think of!).</p> 
<p>I already have a NEX-7. It, ie., OMG, will have to convince me why I should 
not buy another NEX-7 and instead the OMG.</p> 
<p>Tough!!</p> </li>

<p>Umm Admin you have the headline wrong. It&rsquo;s more like &ldquo;Is The 
OM-D worthy of even wiping the Fuji X Pro 1&prime;s ass with it 
tongue&rdquo;!!!!</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest folks, that puny sensored device of the peasantry is 
no match for the Godlike Fuji. The Oly should be happy if the Fuji deigns to 
cast it&rsquo;s shadow upon it so that it may say it has been touched by 
greatness. There is no competition, the Fuji wins hands down. Oh ye Micro Four 
Turdists! Look upon your masters and weep with despair! We the Godlike 
Photographic Elite shall show no pity upon you, and if your are lucky may shit 
into your gaping mouths so that you may taste a little of what greatness is!

<p>+1 ,.I agree with the key word ,.IS IT WORTH FOR THE PRICE,.1700$</p> 
<p> If we want to categorize Fuji with M4/3 , I believe is not even fair,since 
M 4/3 {OM-D] has smaller sensor ,..but we should be proud if the new OM-D can 
match the image quality of bigger sensor -APS C Nikon ,Canon,Pentax,Sony 
etc,..in the term of DR and High ISO,.</p> 
<p> we should compare FUJI against another APS-C sensor camera both SLR and 
Mirrorless with close range of price for 1700$ -Canon 7D, Nikon D300s /D7000or 
Sony A 77+ mirror less NEX7 and the Up coming Pentax and ,Leica.</p> 
<p>So far I believe Fuji is making His Own CONSUMER,. a Photographer with 
their own taste ,passion, and Creativity,..just like the X100 OWNER.</p> 
<p> For the Olympus itself ,.there is no doubt in my mind OM-d will be A REAL 
WINNER on its own class/m43 up to date ,</p> 
<p> .and to me it seems like Olympus has more PASSION ,SOUL,LOVE as A 
PHOTOGRAPHY COMPANY In making photography tool rather than SONY and Panasonic 
as A GIANT ELECTRONIC COMPANY,.with their own interest and Features,..</p> </li>
</ul> </li>

<p>Come on ! X pro aimed for pro-Leica fans or highend standard user like me 
&amp; I don&rsquo;t consider OM will compete against it . You should aware from 
it&rsquo;s launching time when it compare with most of FF DSLR &amp; not any of 
current market mirrorless . Unless OM capable to produce IQ on par / close to X 
Pro then I&rsquo;ll definitely will get an OM but this is very unlikely . To me 
, X Pro is true premier mirrorless camera that challenge the DSLR without doubt 
that Oly / Pana failed to achieve so far .</p> </li>

<p>I do not think the X Pro-1 is for the OM-D, at least not for a couple of

<p>I do think Fuji is a contender for Olympus,  well at least 30% of it. They 
have wanted a part of it for a while.</p> </li>

<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with some m43 fanboy? I cannot believe there are people 
shouting $1100 being too low a price for the so-called &ldquo;OM-D&rdquo;!?! 
Money must be raining down in your country.</p> 
<p>Today you can get a 600D/T3i kit for sub 700eur. It gives full 
functionality with decent external control and most most importantly way better 
image quality than any m43 currently in market. (Oh I happen to be one sad 
owner of GF1,2 and I tried GH2 with raw file.)</p> 
<p>Olympus does not have leading sensor design capability nor does it have 
sensor manufacture. How can you convince yourself they will squeeze out super 
image quality out of thin air?</p> 
<p>Rumor has it: &ldquo;OM-D&rdquo; reproduce OM-4Ti look. And with that head 
bump, I do not believe it will achieve anything good in the portability 
department.</p> 
<p>Fuji is doing a niche product with some good ingredients: non-AA sensor for 
good sharpness + based on a good proven sensor, all metal construction, decent 
prime lens line and a well-thought simplistic design.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;OM-D&rdquo; is doing what?</p> 
<p>I wish the official release can enlighten me.</p> </li>

<p>Wow. A little bit of controversy there:</p> 
<p>&ndash; full-size images &hellip; released by the two photographers 
commissioned to shoot with the camera (apparently using a pre-production unit).
<br> &ndash; All the images &hellip; have been passed through Photoshop, 
according to the EXIF, but are said to be unprocessed.</p> 
<p>Once questions were raised about this, the images were blocked from the

<p>&lsquo;Micro&rsquo;4/3 sensor has always been like a plague in a really 
nice design camera such this OM-D. Now why would it be a contender for APS-C 
cameras?</p> 
<p>If comparing it with the other m4/3 cameras, I can understand. I, for 
example will never compromise on image quality. Well unless you take 
photography only for facebook or other sites, then who cares, it prolly just a 
&lsquo;small&rsquo; difference in quality compare to the bigger sensor cameras. 
It just depends on what kind of photographer you are or gonna be</p> 
<p>With the advent of Nex cameras, xpro-1, perhaps pentax in the future, the 
size isn&rsquo;t the obvious advantage anymore for the m4/3s. The size of aps-c 
sensor cameras are getting smaller than they used to. So what would be the 
advantage of m4/3, the quick autofocus? maybe, if you really into snapshoother. 
The weather sealed body? do you really need it?</p> 
<p>You wannna climb to top of the mountain or the other rough terrain to take 
some shots of nature&rsquo;s wonder? NOw why would you bring your m4/3 for that 
crucial moments?</p> 
<p>When you put some effort to get some descent photography, you wanna make 
sure you get the best image quality available for such effort.</p> 
<ul>

<h4>Steve</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>Sorry, but why do you feel the need to talk down your nose at other 
photographers? I think if you are so concentrating on sensor size and not on 
the glass in front of the sensor or good photographic technique then your 
expensive sensors will get you nothing worthwhile.</p> 
<p>A bigger sensor does not a better image make! I can show you many, many, 
many professionally shot and published images made using m 4/3 gear. It is the 
&ldquo;best&rdquo; gear for all situations? Of course not. No gear is. But to 
dismiss is as inferior due to something as silly as sensor size is ludicrous.
</p> 
<p>Only good for Facebook, huh. Why are you on a site called 
&ldquo;43rumors&rdquo; if you just want to insult the very concept of m4/3 
cameras?</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <br>

<h4>IHUR</h4> 2 months ago | Reply <br>

<p>So what if 2 photographers, both have good photographic technique. One is 
using the aps-c sensor with let say Nex5 or 7 + 24mm zeiss lens or others best 
quality lens available, and the other photographer using fully 
&lsquo;tweak&rsquo; m4/3 sensor like in GX1 camera+ the best lens available 
shooting at the some objects at same situation. Which of them will have the 
best image quality?</p> 
<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t wait to see the comparison there. If you&rsquo;re 
saying you have many professionally shot, try take same shot with bigger sensor 
cameray, I bet you would cry thinking that you could hv got some better image 
quality photos.</p> 
<p>But again, if you just shooting street, strangers and post it on the web, 
this might be one of your option</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>The more the price of the OMD comes close to the Fuji, the Fuji becomes a 
contender (and in my opinion, in a few ways may very well win, even without 
weather sealing). The farther away the price of the OMD is from the Fuji, the 
less Fuji is a contender.</p> 
<p>If the OMD is priced at $1,100 USD (body) vs a $1700 Fuji (body), I 
don&rsquo;t think they are in the same class. The real fight will be Nex-7 vs 
OMD.</p> </li>

<p>The real problem with the Fuji is that its a lot of case for a system thats 
still undeveloped and unproven. The OM-D comes in at the right time &ndash; 
there&rsquo;s many people who have bought into the system that are looking for 
something just a bit better than what&rsquo;s available now. If the rumours 
about the specs are true, then I think its the camera that a lot of us have 
been waiting for.</p> </li>

<p>While I think the Fuji is a lovely camera, I don&rsquo;t think it is an 
OM-D contender. It&rsquo;s just too different. I think the Fuji is really a 
Leica M contender, the poor man&rsquo;s Leica everybody was waiting for.</p> 
<p>The OM-D will no doubt compete against the NEX7, and that is a very 
interesting situation. I&rsquo;m in the market for a smaller system and have 
the funds for both the NEX7 and OM-D. To me the NEX7 seems like a 
gearhead&rsquo;s wishlist camera. Based on the rumors the OM-D seems much more 
like an amateur photographer&rsquo;s wishlist camera.</p> 
<p>For me the OM-D is still well in front of the NEX7. Can&rsquo;t wait to see 
what it&rsquo;s really like!</p> </li>
