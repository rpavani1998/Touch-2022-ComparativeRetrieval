<p> Refined Sugar: The Sweetest Poison of All</p> <br>

<h4>A multitude of common physical and mental ailments are strongly linked to 
the consuming of 'pure', refined sugar.</h4>  by William Dufty &copy; 1975 <br>

<h5>WHY SUGAR IS TOXIC TO THE BODY</h5> 
<p><b>I</b>n 1957, Dr William Coda Martin tried to answer the question: When 
is a food a food and when is it a poison? His working definition of 
&quot;poison&quot; was: &quot;Medically: Any substance applied to the body, 
ingested or developed within the body, which causes or may cause disease. 
Physically: Any substance which inhibits the activity of a catalyst which is a 
minor substance, chemical or enzyme that activates a reaction.&quot;1 The 
dictionary gives an even broader definition for &quot;poison&quot;: &quot;to 
exert a harmful influence on, or to pervert&quot;.</p> 
<p>Dr Martin classified refined sugar as a poison because it has been depleted 
of its life forces, vitamins and minerals. &quot;What is left consists of pure, 
refined carbohydrates. The body cannot utilize this refined starch and 
carbohydrate unless the depleted proteins, vitamins and minerals are present. 
Nature supplies these elements in each plant in quantities sufficient to 
metabolize the carbohydrate in that particular plant. There is no excess for 
other added carbohydrates. Incomplete carbohydrate metabolism results in the 
formation of 'toxic metabolite' such as pyruvic acid and abnormal sugars 
containing five carbon atoms. Pyruvic acid accumulates in the brain and nervous 
system and the abnormal sugars in the red blood cells. These toxic metabolites 
interfere with the respiration of the cells. They cannot get sufficient oxygen 
to survive and function normally. In time, some of the cells die. This 
interferes with the function of a part of the body and is the beginning of 
degenerative disease.&quot;2</p> 
<p>Refined sugar is lethal when ingested by humans because it provides only 
that which nutritionists describe as &quot;empty&quot; or &quot;naked&quot; 
calories. It lacks the natural minerals which are present in the sugar beet or 
cane. In addition, sugar is worse than nothing because it drains and leaches 
the body of precious vitamins and minerals through the demand its digestion, 
detoxification and elimination make upon one's entire system.</p> 
<p>So essential is balance to our bodies that we have many ways to provide 
against the sudden shock of a heavy intake of sugar. Minerals such as sodium 
(from salt), potassium and magnesium (from vegetables), and calcium (from the 
bones) are mobilized and used in chemical transmutation; neutral acids are 
produced which attempt to return the acid-alkaline balance factor of the blood 
to a more normal state.</p> 
<p>Sugar taken every day produces a continuously overacid condition, and more 
and more minerals are required from deep in the body in the attempt to rectify 
the imbalance. Finally, in order to protect the blood, so much calcium is taken 
from the bones and teeth that decay and general weakening begin.</p> 
<p>Excess sugar eventually affects every organ in the body. Initially, it is 
stored in the liver in the form of glucose (glycogen). Since the liver's 
capacity is limited, a daily intake of refined sugar (above the required amount 
of natural sugar) soon makes the liver expand like a balloon. When the liver is 
filled to its maximum capacity, the excess glycogen is returned to the blood in 
the form of fatty acids. These are taken to every part of the body and stored 
in the most inactive areas: the belly, the buttocks, the breasts and the thighs.
</p> 
<p>When these comparatively harmless places are completely filled, fatty acids 
are then distributed among active organs, such as the heart and kidneys. These 
begin to slow down; finally their tissues degenerate and turn to fat. The whole 
body is affected by their reduced ability, and abnormal blood pressure is 
created. The parasympathetic nervous system is affected; and organs governed by 
it, such as the small brain, become inactive or paralyzed. (Normal brain 
function is rarely thought of as being as biologic as digestion.) The 
circulatory and lymphatic systems are invaded, and the quality of the red 
corpuscles starts to change. An overabundance of white cells occurs, and the 
creation of tissue becomes slower. Our body's tolerance and immunizing power 
becomes more limited, so we cannot respond properly to extreme attacks, whether 
they be cold, heat, mosquitoes or microbes.</p> 
<p>Excessive sugar has a strong mal-effect on the functioning of the brain. 
The key to orderly brain function is glutamic acid, a vital compound found in 
many vegetables. The B vitamins play a major role in dividing glutamic acid 
into antagonistic-complementary compounds which produce a &quot;proceed&quot; 
or &quot;control&quot; response in the brain. B vitamins are also manufactured 
by symbiotic bacteria which live in our intestines. When refined sugar is taken 
daily, these bacteria wither and die, and our stock of B vitamins gets very 
low. Too much sugar makes one sleepy; our ability to calculate and remember is 
lost.</p> 
<h5>SUGAR: HARMFUL TO HUMANS AND ANIMALS</h5> 
<p>Shipwrecked sailors who ate and drank nothing but sugar and rum for nine 
days surely went through some of this trauma; the tales they had to tell 
created a big public relations problem for the sugar pushers.</p> 
<p>This incident occurred when a vessel carrying a cargo of sugar was 
shipwrecked in 1793. The five surviving sailors were finally rescued after 
being marooned for nine days. They were in a wasted condition due to 
starvation, having consumed nothing but sugar and rum.</p> 
<p>The eminent French physiologist F. Magendie was inspired by that incident 
to conduct a series of experiments with animals, the results of which he 
published in 1816. In the experiments, he fed dogs a diet of sugar or olive oil 
and water. All the dogs wasted and died.3</p> 
<p>The shipwrecked sailors and the French physiologist's experimental dogs 
proved the same point. As a steady diet, sugar is worse than nothing. Plain 
water can keep you alive for quite some time. Sugar and water can kill you. 
Humans [and animals] are &quot;unable to subsist on a diet of sugar&quot;.4</p> 
<p>The dead dogs in Professor Magendie's laboratory alerted the sugar industry 
to the hazards of free scientific inquiry. From that day to this, the sugar 
industry has invested millions of dollars in behind-the-scenes, subsidized 
science. The best scientific names that money could buy have been hired, in the 
hope that they could one day come up with something at least pseudoscientific 
in the way of glad tidings about sugar.</p> 
<p>It has been proved, however, that (1) sugar is a major factor in dental 
decay; (2) sugar in a person's diet does cause overweight; (3) removal of sugar 
from diets has cured symptoms of crippling, worldwide diseases such as 
diabetes, cancer and heart illnesses.</p> 
<p>Sir Frederick Banting, the codiscoverer of insulin, noticed in 1929 in 
Panama that, among sugar plantation owners who ate large amounts of their 
refined stuff, diabetes was common. Among native cane-cutters, who only got to 
chew the raw cane, he saw no diabetes.</p> 
<p>However, the story of the public relations attempts on the part of the 
sugar manufacturers began in Britain in 1808 when the Committee of West India 
reported to the House of Commons that a prize of twenty-five guineas had been 
offered to anyone who could come up with the most &quot;satisfactory&quot; 
experiments to prove that unrefined sugar was good for feeding and fattening 
oxen, cows, hogs and sheep.5 Food for animals is often seasonal, always 
expensive. Sugar, by then, was dirt cheap. People weren't eating it fast enough.
</p> 
<p>Naturally, the attempt to feed livestock with sugar and molasses in England 
in 1808 was a disaster. When the Committee on West India made its fourth report 
to the House of Commons, one Member of Parliament, John Curwin, reported that 
he had tried to feed sugar and molasses to calves without success. He suggested 
that perhaps someone should try again by sneaking sugar and molasses into 
skimmed milk. Had anything come of that, you can be sure the West Indian sugar 
merchants would have spread the news around the world. After this singular lack 
of success in pushing sugar in cow pastures, the West Indian sugar merchants 
gave up.</p> 
<p>With undaunted zeal for increasing the market demand for the most important 
agricultural product of the West Indies, the Committee of West India was 
reduced to a tactic that has served the sugar pushers for almost 200 years: 
irrelevant and transparently silly testimonials from faraway, inaccessible 
people with some kind of &quot;scientific&quot; credentials. One early 
commentator called them &quot;hired consciences&quot;.</p> 
<p>The House of Commons committee was so hard-up for local cheerleaders on the 
sugar question, it was reduced to quoting a doctor from faraway Philadelphia, a 
leader of the recent American colonial rebellion: &quot;The great Dr Rush of 
Philadelphia is reported to have said that '<b>sugar contains more nutrients in 
the same bulk than any other known substance</b>'.&quot; (Emphasis added.) At 
the same time, the same Dr Rush was preaching that masturbation was the cause 
of insanity! If a weasel-worded statement like that was quoted, one can be sure 
no animal doctor could be found in Britain who would recommend sugar for the 
care and feeding of cows, pigs or sheep.</p> 
<p>While preparing his epochal volume, A History of Nutrition, published in 
1957, Professor E. V. McCollum (Johns Hopkins University), sometimes called 
America's foremost nutritionist and certainly a pioneer in the field, reviewed 
approximately 200,000 published scientific papers, recording experiments with 
food, their properties, their utilization and their effects on animals and men. 
The material covered the period from the mid-18th century to 1940. From this 
great repository of scientific inquiry, McCollum selected those experiments 
which he regarded as significant &quot;to relate the story of progress in 
discovering human error in this segment of science [of nutrition]&quot;. 
Professor McCollum failed to record a single controlled scientific experiment 
with sugar between 1816 and 1940.</p> 
<p>Unhappily, we must remind ourselves that scientists today, and always, 
accomplish little without a sponsor. The protocols of modern science have 
compounded the costs of scientific inquiry.</p> 
<p>We have no right to be surprised when we read the introduction to McCollum's
<i>A History of Nutrition</i> and find that &quot;The author and publishers are 
indebted to The Nutrition Foundation, Inc., for a grant provided to meet a 
portion of the cost of publication of this book&quot;. What, you might ask, is 
The Nutrition Foundation, Inc.? The author and the publishers don't tell you. 
It happens to be a front organization for the leading sugar-pushing 
conglomerates in the food business, including the American Sugar Refining 
Company, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Curtis Candy Co., General Foods, General Mills, 
Nestl&eacute; Co., Pet Milk Co. and Sunshine Biscuits-about 45 such companies 
in all.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the most significant thing about McCollum's 1957 history was what 
he left out: a monumental earlier work described by an eminent Harvard 
professor as &quot;one of those epochal pieces of research which makes every 
other investigator desirous of kicking himself because he never thought of 
doing the same thing&quot;. In the 1930s, a research dentist from Cleveland, 
Ohio, Dr Weston A. Price, traveled all over the world-from the lands of the 
Eskimos to the South Sea Islands, from Africa to New Zealand. His<i>Nutrition 
and Physical Degeneration: A Comparison of Primitive and Modern Diets and Their 
Effects</i>,6 which is illustrated with hundreds of photographs, was first 
published in 1939.</p> 
<p>Dr Price took the whole world as his laboratory. His devastating 
conclusion, recorded in horrifying detail in area after area, was simple. 
People who live under so-called backward primitive conditions had excellent 
teeth and wonderful general health. They ate natural, unrefined food from their 
own locale. As soon as refined, sugared foods were imported as a result of 
contact with &quot;civilization&quot;, physical degeneration began in a way 
that was definitely observable within a single generation.</p> 
<p>Any credibility the sugar pushers have is based on our ignorance of works 
like that of Dr Price. Sugar manufacturers keep trying, hoping and contributing 
generous research grants to colleges and universities; but the research 
laboratories never come up with anything solid the manufacturers can use. 
Invariably, the research results are bad news.</p> 
<p>&quot;Let us go to the ignorant savage, consider his way of eating and be 
wise,&quot; Harvard professor Ernest Hooten said in Apes, Men, and Morons.7 
&quot;Let us cease pretending that toothbrushes and toothpaste are any more 
important than shoe brushes and shoe polish. It is store food that has given us 
store teeth.&quot;</p> 
<p>When the researchers bite the hands that feed them, and the news gets out, 
it's embarrassing all around. In 1958, Time magazine reported that a Harvard 
biochemist and his assistants had worked with myriads of mice for more than ten 
years, bankrolled by the Sugar Research Foundation, Inc. to the tune of 
$57,000, to find out how sugar causes dental cavities and how to prevent this. 
It took them ten years to discover that there was no way to prevent sugar 
causing dental decay. When the researchers reported their findings in the<i>
Dental Association Journal</i>, their source of money dried up. The Sugar 
Research Foundation withdrew its support.</p> 
<p>The more that the scientists disappointed them, the more the sugar pushers 
had to rely on the ad men.</p> 
<h5>SUCROSE: &quot;PURE&quot; ENERGY AT A PRICE</h5> 
<p>When calories became the big thing in the 1920s, and everybody was learning 
to count them, the sugar pushers turned up with a new pitch. They boasted there 
were 2,500 calories in a pound of sugar. A little over a quarter-pound of sugar 
would produce 20 per cent of the total daily quota.</p> 
<p>&quot;If you could buy all your food energy as cheaply as you buy calories 
in sugar,&quot; they told us, &quot;your board bill for the year would be very 
low. If sugar were seven cents a pound, it would cost less than $35 for a whole 
year.&quot;</p> 
<p>A very inexpensive way to kill yourself.</p> 
<p>&quot;Of course, we don't live on any such unbalanced diet,&quot; they 
admitted later. &quot;But that figure serves to point out how inexpensive sugar 
is as an energy-building food. What was once a luxury only a privileged few 
could enjoy is now a food for the poorest of people.&quot;</p> 
<p>Later, the sugar pushers advertised that sugar was chemically pure, topping 
Ivory soap in that department, being 99.9 per cent pure against Ivory's vaunted 
99.44 per cent. &quot;No food of our everyday diet is purer,&quot; we were 
assured.</p> 
<p>What was meant by purity, besides the unarguable fact that all vitamins, 
minerals, salts, fibres and proteins had been removed in the refining process? 
Well, the sugar pushers came up with a new slant on purity.</p> 
<p>&quot;You don't have to sort it like beans, wash it like rice. Every grain 
is like every other. No waste attends its use. No useless bones like in meat, 
no grounds like coffee.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Pure&quot; is a favorite adjective of the sugar pushers because it 
means one thing to the chemists and another thing to the ordinary mortals. When 
honey is labeled pure, this means that it is in its natural state (stolen 
directly from the bees who made it), with no adulteration with sucrose to 
stretch it and no harmful chemical residues which may have been sprayed on the 
flowers. It does not mean that the honey is free from minerals like iodine, 
iron, calcium, phosphorus or multiple vitamins. So effective is the 
purification process which sugar cane and beets undergo in the refineries that 
sugar ends up as chemically pure as the morphine or the heroin a chemist has on 
the laboratory shelves. What nutritional virtue this abstract chemical purity 
represents, the sugar pushers never tell us.</p> 
<p>Beginning with World War I, the sugar pushers coated their propaganda with 
a preparedness pitch. &quot;Dietitians have known the high food value of sugar 
for a long time,&quot; said an industry tract of the 1920s. &quot;But it took 
World War I to bring this home. The energy-building power of sugar reaches the 
muscles in minutes and it was of value to soldiers as a ration given them just 
before an attack was launched.&quot; The sugar pushers have been harping on the 
energy-building power of sucrose for years because it contains nothing else. 
Caloric energy and habit-forming taste: that's what sucrose has, and nothing 
else.</p> 
<p>All other foods contain energy plus. All foods contain some nutrients in 
the way of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals, or all of these. 
Sucrose contains caloric energy, period.</p> 
<p>The &quot;quick&quot; energy claim the sugar pushers talk about, which 
drives reluctant doughboys over the top and drives children up the wall, is 
based on the fact that refined sucrose is not digested in the mouth or the 
stomach but passes directly to the lower intestines and thence to the 
bloodstream. The extra speed with which sucrose enters the bloodstream does 
more harm than good.</p> 
<p>Much of the public confusion about refined sugar is compounded by language. 
Sugars are classified by chemists as &quot;carbohydrates&quot;. This 
manufactured word means &quot;a substance containing carbon with oxygen and 
hydrogen&quot;. If chemists want to use these hermetic terms in their 
laboratories when they talk to one another, fine. The use of the word 
&quot;carbohydrate&quot; outside the laboratory-especially in food labeling and 
advertising lingo-to describe both natural, complete cereal grains (which have 
been a principal food of mankind for thousands of years) and man-refined sugar 
(which is a manufactured drug and principal poison of mankind for only a few 
hundred years) is demonstrably wicked. This kind of confusion makes possible 
the flimflam practiced by sugar pushers to confound anxious mothers into 
thinking kiddies need sugar to survive.</p> 
<p>In 1973, the Sugar Information Foundation placed full-page advertisements 
in national magazines. Actually, the ads were disguised retractions they were 
forced to make in a strategic retreat after a lengthy tussle with the Federal 
Trade Commission over an earlier ad campaign claiming that a little shot of 
sugar before meals would &quot;curb&quot; your appetite. &quot;You need 
carbohydrates. And it so happens that sugar is the best-tasting 
carbohydrate.&quot; You might as well say everybody needs liquids every day. It 
so happens that many people find champagne is the best-tasting liquid. How long 
would the Women's Christian Temperance Union let the liquor lobby get away with 
that one?</p> 
<p>The use of the word &quot;carbohydrate&quot; to describe sugar is 
deliberately misleading. Since the improved labeling of nutritional properties 
was required on packages and cans, refined carbohydrates like sugar are lumped 
together with those carbohydrates which may or may not be refined. The several 
types of carbohydrates are added together for an overall carbohydrate total. 
Thus, the effect of the label is to hide the sugar content from the unwary 
buyer. Chemists add to the confusion by using the word &quot;sugar&quot; to 
describe an entire group of substances that are similar but not identical.</p> 
<p>Glucose is a sugar found usually with other sugars, in fruits and 
vegetables. It is a key material in the metabolism of all plants and animals. 
Many of our principal foods are converted into glucose in our bodies. Glucose 
is always present in our bloodstream, and it is often called &quot;blood 
sugar&quot;.</p> 
<p>Dextrose, also called &quot;corn sugar&quot;, is derived synthetically from 
starch. Fructose is fruit sugar. Maltose is malt sugar. Lactose is milk sugar. 
Sucrose is refined sugar made from sugar cane and sugar beet.</p> 
<p>Glucose has always been an essential element in the human bloodstream. 
Sucrose addiction is something new in the history of the human animal. To use 
the word &quot;sugar&quot; to describe two substances which are far from being 
identical, which have different chemical structures and which affect the body 
in profoundly different ways compounds confusion.</p> 
<p>It makes possible more flimflam from the sugar pushers who tell us how 
important sugar is as an essential component of the human body, how it is 
oxidized to produce energy, how it is metabolized to produce warmth, and so on. 
They're talking about glucose, of course, which is manufactured in our bodies. 
However, one is led to believe that the manufacturers are talking about the 
sucrose which is made in their refineries. When the word &quot;sugar&quot; can 
mean the glucose in your blood as well as the sucrose in your Coca-Cola, it's 
great for the sugar pushers but it's rough on everybody else.</p> 
<p>People have been bamboozled into thinking of their bodies the way they 
think of their cheque accounts. If they suspect they have low blood sugar, they 
are programmed to snack on vending machine candies and sodas in order to raise 
their blood sugar level. Actually, this is the worst thing to do. The level of 
glucose in their blood is apt to be low because they are addicted to sucrose. 
People who kick sucrose addiction and stay off sucrose find that the glucose 
level of their blood returns to normal and stays there.</p> 
<p>Since the late 1960s, millions of Americans have returned to natural food. 
A new type of store, the natural food store, has encouraged many to become 
dropouts from the supermarket. Natural food can be instrumental in restoring 
health. Many people, therefore, have come to equate the word 
&quot;natural&quot; with &quot;healthy&quot;. So the sugar pushers have begun 
to pervert the word &quot;natural&quot; in order to mislead the public.</p> 
<p>&quot;Made from natural ingredients&quot;, the television sugar-pushers 
tell us about product after product. The word &quot;from&quot; is not accented 
on television. It should be. Even refined sugar is made from natural 
ingredients. There is nothing new about that. The natural ingredients are cane 
and beets. But that four-letter word &quot;from&quot; hardly suggests that 90 
per cent of the cane and beet have been removed. Heroin, too, could be 
advertised as being made from natural ingredients. The opium poppy is as 
natural as the sugar beet. It's what man does with it that tells the story.</p> 
<p>If you want to avoid sugar in the supermarket, there is only one sure way. 
Don't buy anything unless it says on the label prominently, in plain English: 
&quot;No sugar added&quot;. Use of the word &quot;carbohydrate&quot; as a 
&quot;scientific&quot; word for sugar has become a standard defense strategy 
with sugar pushers and many of their medical apologists. It's their security 
blanket.</p> 
<h5>CORRECT FOOD COMBINING</h5> 
<p>Whether it's sugared cereal or pastry and black coffee for breakfast, 
whether it's hamburgers and Coca-Cola for lunch or the full &quot;gourmet&quot; 
dinner in the evening, chemically the average American diet is a formula that 
guarantees bubble, bubble, stomach trouble.</p> 
<p>Unless you've taken too much insulin and, in a state of insulin shock, need 
sugar as an antidote, hardly anyone ever has cause to take sugar alone. Humans 
need sugar as much as they need the nicotine in tobacco. Crave it is one 
thing-need it is another. From the days of the Persian Empire to our own, sugar 
has usually been used to hop up the flavour of other food and drink, as an 
ingredient in the kitchen or as a condiment at the table. Let us leave aside 
for the moment the known effect of sugar (long-term and short-term) on the 
entire system and concentrate on the effect of sugar taken in combination with 
other daily foods.</p> 
<p>When Grandma warned that sugared cookies before meals &quot;will spoil your 
supper&quot;, she knew what she was talking about. Her explanation might not 
have satisfied a chemist but, as with many traditional axioms from the Mosaic 
law on kosher food and separation in the kitchen, such rules are based on years 
of trial and error and are apt to be right on the button. Most modern research 
in combining food is a laboured discovery of the things Grandma took for 
granted.</p> 
<p>Any diet or regimen undertaken for the single purpose of losing weight is 
dangerous, by definition. Obesity is talked about and treated as a disease in 
20th-century America. Obesity is not a disease. It is only a symptom, a sign, a 
warning that your body is out of order. Dieting to lose weight is as silly and 
dangerous as taking aspirin to relieve a headache before you know the reason 
for the headache. Getting rid of a symptom is like turning off an alarm. It 
leaves the basic cause untouched.</p> 
<p>Any diet or regimen undertaken with any objective short of restoration of 
total health of your body is dangerous. Many overweight people are 
undernourished. (Dr H. Curtis Wood stresses this point in his 1971 book,<i>
Overfed But Undernourished</i>.) Eating less can aggravate this condition, 
unless one is concerned with the quality of the food instead of just its 
quantity.</p> 
<p>Many people-doctors included-assume that if weight is lost, fat is lost. 
This is not necessarily so. Any diet which lumps all carbohydrates together is 
dangerous. Any diet which does not consider the quality of carbohydrates and 
makes the crucial life-and-death distinction between natural, unrefined 
carbohydrates like whole grains and vegetables and man-refined carbohydrates 
like sugar and white flour is dangerous. Any diet which includes refined sugar 
and white flour, no matter what &quot;scientific&quot; name is applied to them, 
is dangerous.</p> 
<p>Kicking sugar and white flour and substituting whole grains, vegetables and 
natural fruits in season, is the core of any sensible natural regimen. Changing 
the quality of your carbohydrates can change the quality of your health and 
life. If you eat natural food of good quality, quantity tends to take care of 
itself. Nobody is going to eat a half-dozen sugar beets or a whole case of 
sugar cane. Even if they do, it will be less dangerous than a few ounces of 
sugar.</p> 
<p>Sugar of all kinds-natural sugars, such as those in honey and fruit 
(fructose), as well as the refined white stuff (sucrose)-tends to arrest the 
secretion of gastric juices and have an inhibiting effect on the stomach's 
natural ability to move. Sugars are not digested in the mouth, like cereals, or 
in the stomach, like animal flesh. When taken alone, they pass quickly through 
the stomach into the small intestine. When sugars are eaten with other 
foods-perhaps meat and bread in a sandwich-they are held up in the stomach for 
a while. The sugar in the bread and the Coke sit there with the hamburger and 
the bun waiting for them to be digested. While the stomach is working on the 
animal protein and the refined starch in the bread, the addition of the sugar 
practically guarantees rapid acid fermentation under the conditions of warmth 
and moisture existing in the stomach.</p> 
<p>One lump of sugar in your coffee after a sandwich is enough to turn your 
stomach into a fermenter. One soda with a hamburger is enough to turn your 
stomach into a still. Sugar on cereal-whether you buy it already sugared in a 
box or add it yourself-almost guarantees acid fermentation.</p> 
<p>Since the beginning of time, natural laws were observed, in both senses of 
that word, when it came to eating foods in combination. Birds have been 
observed eating insects at one period in the day and seeds at another. Other 
animals tend to eat one food at a time. Flesh-eating animals take their protein 
raw and straight.</p> 
<p>In the Orient, it is traditional to eat yang before yin. Miso soup 
(fermented soybean protein, yang) for breakfast; raw fish (more yang protein) 
at the beginning of the meal; afterwards comes the rice (which is less yang 
than the miso and fish); and then the vegetables which are yin. If you ever eat 
with a traditional Japanese family and you violate this order, the Orientals 
(if your friends) will correct you courteously but firmly.</p> 
<p>The law observed by Orthodox Jews prohibits many combinations at the same 
meal, especially flesh and dairy products. Special utensils for the dairy meal 
and different utensils for the flesh meal reinforce that taboo at the food's 
source in the kitchen.</p> 
<p>Man learned very early in the game what improper combinations of food could 
do to the human system. When he got a stomach ache from combining raw fruit 
with grain, or honey with porridge, he didn't reach for an antacid tablet. He 
learned not to eat that way. When gluttony and excess became widespread, 
religious codes and commandments were invoked against it. Gluttony is a capital 
sin in most religions; but there are no specific religious warnings or 
commandments against refined sugar because sugar abuse-like drug abuse-did not 
appear on the world scene until centuries after holy books had gone to press.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Why must we accept as normal what we find in a race of sick and 
weakened human beings?&quot; Dr Herbert M. Shelton asks. &quot;Must we always 
take it for granted that the present eating practices of civilized men are 
normal?... Foul stools, loose stools, impacted stools, pebbly stools, much foul 
gas, colitis, haemorrhoids, bleeding with stools, the need for toilet paper are 
swept into the orbit of the normal.&quot;</p> 
<p>When starches and complex sugars (like those in honey and fruits) are 
digested, they are broken down into simple sugars called 
&quot;monosaccharides&quot;, which are usable substances-nutriments. When 
starches and sugars are taken together and undergo fermentation, they are 
broken down into carbon dioxide, acetic acid, alcohol and water. With the 
exception of the water, all these are unusable substances-poisons.</p> 
<p>When proteins are digested, they are broken down into amino acids, which 
are usable substances-nutriments. When proteins are taken with sugar, they 
putrefy; they are broken down into a variety of ptomaines and leucomaines, 
which are nonusable substances-poisons.</p> 
<p>Enzymic digestion of foods prepares them for use by our body. Bacterial 
decomposition makes them unfit for use by our body. The first process gives us 
nutriments; the second gives us poisons.</p> 
<p>Much that passes for modern nutrition is obsessed with a mania for 
quantitative counting. The body is treated like a cheque account. Deposit 
calories (like dollars) and withdraw energy. Deposit proteins, carbohydrates, 
fats, vitamins and minerals-balanced quantitatively-and the result, 
theoretically, is a healthy body. People qualify as healthy today if they can 
crawl out of bed, get to the office and sign in. If they can't make it, call 
the doctor to qualify for sick pay, hospitalization, rest cure-anything from a 
day's pay without working to an artificial kidney, courtesy of the taxpayers.
</p> 
<p>But what doth it profit someone if the theoretically required calories and 
nutrients are consumed daily, yet this random eat-on-the-run, snack-time 
collection of foods ferments and putrefies in the digestive tract? What good is 
it if the body is fed protein, only to have it putrefy in the gastrointestinal 
canal? Carbohydrates that ferment in the digestive tract are converted into 
alcohol and acetic acid, not digestible monosaccharides.</p> 
<p>&quot;To derive sustenance from foods eaten, they must be digested,&quot; 
Shelton warned years ago. &quot;They must not rot.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sure, the body can get rid of poisons through the urine and the pores; the 
amount of poisons in the urine is taken as an index to what's going on in the 
intestine. The body does establish a tolerance for these poisons, just as it 
adjusts gradually to an intake of heroin. But, says Shelton, &quot;the 
discomfort from accumulation of gas, the bad breath, and foul and unpleasant 
odors are as undesirable as are the poisons&quot;.</p> 
<h5>SUGAR AND MENTAL HEALTH</h5> 
<p>In the Dark Ages, troubled souls were rarely locked up for going off their 
rocker. Such confinement began in the Age of Enlightenment, after sugar made 
the transition from apothecary's prescription to candymaker's confection. 
&quot;The great confinement of the insane&quot;, as one historian calls it,10 
began in the late 17th century, after sugar consumption in Britain had zoomed 
in 200 years from a pinch or two in a barrel of beer, here and there, to more 
than two million pounds per year. By that time, physicians in London had begun 
to observe and record terminal physical signs and symptoms of the &quot;sugar 
blues&quot;.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, when sugar eaters did not manifest obvious terminal physical 
symptoms and the physicians were professionally bewildered, patients were no 
longer pronounced bewitched, but mad, insane, emotionally disturbed. Laziness, 
fatigue, debauchery, parental displeasure-any one problem was sufficient cause 
for people under twenty-five to be locked up in the first Parisian mental 
hospitals. All it took to be incarcerated was a complaint from parents, 
relatives or the omnipotent parish priest. Wet nurses with their babies, 
pregnant youngsters, retarded or defective children, senior citizens, 
paralytics, epileptics, prostitutes or raving lunatics-anyone wanted off the 
streets and out of sight was put away. The mental hospital succeeded 
witch-hunting and heresy-hounding as a more enlightened and humane method of 
social control. The physician and priest handled the dirty work of street 
sweeping in return for royal favours.</p> 
<p>Initially, when the General Hospital was established in Paris by royal 
decree, one per cent of the city's population was locked up. From that time 
until the 20 century, as the consumption of sugar went up and up-especially in 
the cities-so did the number of people who were put away in the General 
Hospital. Three hundred years later, the &quot;emotionally disturbed&quot; can 
be turned into walking automatons, their brains controlled with psychoactive 
drugs.</p> 
<p>Today, pioneers of orthomolecular psychiatry, such as Dr Abram Hoffer, Dr 
Allan Cott, Dr A. Cherkin as well as Dr Linus Pauling, have confirmed that 
mental illness is a myth and that emotional disturbance can be merely the first 
symptom of the obvious inability of the human system to handle the stress of 
sugar dependency.</p> 
<p>In Orthomolecular Psychiatry, Dr Pauling writes: &quot;The functioning of 
the brain and nervous tissue is more sensitively dependent on the rate of 
chemical reactions than the functioning of other organs and tissues. I believe 
that mental disease is for the most part caused by abnormal reaction rates, as 
determined by genetic constitution and diet, and by abnormal molecular 
concentrations of essential substances... Selection of food (and drugs) in a 
world that is undergoing rapid scientific and technological change may often be 
far from the best.&quot;</p> 
<p>In Megavitamin B3 Therapy for Schizophrenia, Dr Abram Hoffer notes: 
&quot;Patients are also advised to follow a good nutritional program with 
restriction of sucrose and sucrose-rich foods.&quot;</p> 
<p>Clinical research with hyperactive and psychotic children, as well as those 
with brain injuries and learning disabilities, has shown:</p> 
<p>&quot;An abnormally high family history of diabetes-that is, parents and 
grandparents who cannot handle sugar; an abnormally high incidence of low blood 
glucose, or functional hypoglycemia in the children themselves, which indicates 
that their systems cannot handle sugar; dependence on a high level of sugar in 
the diets of the very children who cannot handle it.</p> 
<p>&quot;Inquiry into the dietary history of patients diagnosed as 
schizophrenic reveals the diet of their choice is rich in sweets, candy, cakes, 
coffee, caffeinated beverages, and foods prepared with sugar. These foods, 
which stimulate the adrenals, should be eliminated or severely restricted.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The avant-garde of modern medicine has rediscovered what the lowly 
sorceress learned long ago through painstaking study of nature.</p> 
<p>&quot;In more than twenty years of psychiatric work,&quot; writes Dr Thomas 
Szasz, &quot;I have never known a clinical psychologist to report, on the basis 
of a projective test, that the subject is a normal, mentally healthy person. 
While some witches may have survived dunking, no 'madman' survives 
psychological testing...there is no behavior or person that a modern 
psychiatrist cannot plausibly diagnose as abnormal or ill.&quot;</p> 
<p>So it was in the 17th century. Once the doctor or the exorcist had been 
called in, he was under pressure to do something. When he tried and failed, the 
poor patient had to be put away. It is often said that surgeons bury their 
mistakes. Physicians and psychiatrists put them away; lock 'em up.</p> 
<p>In the 1940s, Dr John Tintera rediscovered the vital importance of the 
endocrine system, especially the adrenal glands, in &quot;pathological 
mentation&quot;-or &quot;brain boggling&quot;. In 200 cases under treatment for 
hypoadrenocorticism (the lack of adequate adrenal cortical hormone production 
or imbalance among these hormones), he discovered that the chief complaints of 
his patients were often similar to those found in persons whose systems were 
unable to handle sugar: fatigue, nervousness, depression, apprehension, craving 
for sweets, inability to handle alcohol, inability to concentrate, allergies, 
low blood pressure. Sugar blues!</p> 
<p>Dr Tintera finally insisted that all his patients submit to a four-hour 
glucose tolerance test (GTT) to find out whether or not they could handle 
sugar. The results were so startling that the laboratories double-checked their 
techniques, then apologised for what they believed to be incorrect readings. 
What mystified them was the low, flat curves derived from disturbed, early 
adolescents. This laboratory procedure had been previously carried out only for 
patients with physical findings presumptive of diabetes.</p> 
<p>Dorland's definition of schizophrenia (Bleuler's dementia praecox) includes 
the phrase, &quot;often recognized during or shortly after adolescence&quot;, 
and further, in reference to hebephrenia and catatonia, &quot;coming on soon 
after the onset of puberty&quot;.</p> 
<p>These conditions might seem to arise or become aggravated at puberty, but 
probing into the patient's past will frequently reveal indications which were 
present at birth, during the first year of life, and through the preschool and 
grammar school years. Each of these periods has its own characteristic clinical 
picture. This picture becomes more marked at pubescence and often causes school 
officials to complain of juvenile delinquency or underachievement.</p> 
<p>A glucose tolerance test at any of these periods could alert parents and 
physicians and could save innumerable hours and small fortunes spent in looking 
into the child's psyche and home environment for maladjustments of questionable 
significance in the emotional development of the average child.</p> 
<p>The negativism, hyperactivity and obstinate resentment of discipline are 
absolute indications for at least the minimum laboratory tests: urinalysis, 
complete bloodcount, PBI determination, and the five-hour glucose tolerance 
test. A GTT can be performed on a young child by the micro-method without undue 
trauma to the patient. As a matter of fact, I have been urging that these four 
tests be routine for all patients, even before a history or physical 
examination is undertaken.</p> 
<p>In almost all discussions on drug addiction, alcoholism and schizophrenia, 
it is claimed that there is no definite constitutional type that falls prey to 
these afflictions. Almost universally, the statement is made that all of these 
individuals are emotionally immature. It has long been our goal to persuade 
every physician, whether oriented toward psychiatry, genetics or physiology, to 
recognise that one type of endocrine individual is involved in the majority of 
these cases: the hypoadrenocortic.15 </p> 
<p>Tintera published several epochal medical papers. Over and over, he 
emphasised that improvement, alleviation, palliation or cure was 
&quot;dependent upon the restoration of the normal function of the total 
organism&quot;. His first prescribed item of treatment was diet. Over and over 
again, he said that &quot;the importance of diet cannot be 
overemphasised&quot;. He laid out a sweeping permanent injunction against sugar 
in all forms and guises.</p> 
<p>While Egas Moniz of Portugal was receiving a Nobel Prize for devising the 
lobotomy operation for the treatment of schizophrenia, Tintera's reward was to 
be harassment and hounding by the pundits of organised medicine. While 
Tintera's sweeping implication of sugar as a cause of what was called 
&quot;schizophrenia&quot; could be confined to medical journals, he was let 
alone, ignored. He could be tolerated-if he stayed in his assigned territory, 
endocrinology. Even when he suggested that alcoholism was related to adrenals 
that had been whipped by sugar abuse, they let him alone; because the medicos 
had decided there was nothing in alcoholism for them except aggravation, they 
were satisfied to abandon it to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, when Tintera 
dared to suggest in a magazine of general circulation that &quot;it is 
ridiculous to talk of kinds of allergies when there is only one kind, which is 
adrenal glands impaired...by sugar&quot;, he could no longer be ignored.</p> 
<p>The allergists had a great racket going for themselves. Allergic souls had 
been entertaining each other for years with tall tales of exotic 
allergies-everything from horse feathers to lobster tails. Along comes someone 
who says none of this matters: take them off sugar, and keep them off it.</p> 
<p>Perhaps Tintera's untimely death in 1969 at the age of fifty-seven made it 
easier for the medical profession to accept discoveries that had once seemed as 
far out as the simple oriental medical thesis of genetics and diet, yin and 
yang. Today, doctors all over the world are repeating what Tintera announced 
years ago: nobody, but nobody, should ever be allowed to begin what is called 
&quot;psychiatric treatment&quot;, anyplace, anywhere, unless and until they 
have had a glucose tolerance test to discover if they can handle sugar.</p> 
<p>So-called preventive medicine goes further and suggests that since we only 
think we can handle sugar because we initially have strong adrenals, why wait 
until they give us signs and signals that they're worn out? Take the load off 
now by eliminating sugar in all forms and guises, starting with that soda pop 
you have in your hand.</p> 
<p>The mind truly boggles when one glances over what passes for medical 
history. Through the centuries, troubled souls have been barbecued for 
bewitchment, exorcised for possession, locked up for insanity, tortured for 
masturbatory madness, psychiatrised for psychosis, lobotomised for 
schizophrenia. How many patients would have listened if the local healer had 
told them that the only thing ailing them was sugar blues?</p>

<p>Additional Information on Sugar</p> 
<p>This page is not only about white sugar. It is also about brown/ raw/ 
turbinado&nbsp;sugar, molasses, syrups, and other concentrated sweeteners like 
: dextrose (glucose) , fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose, dextrin, 
dextrains,&nbsp; and honey. Our body digests and absorbs these concentrated 
sources of sugars rapidly, and quickly turns them into saturated fatty acids 
and cholesterol. If we do not burn off the fat through activity, it will start 
accumulating under our skin,in our lever in our arteries and other organs.</p> 
<p>One thing is common characteristic for all those sweeteners: they are 
concentrated and composed of simple sugars&nbsp; (monosaccharide&nbsp; and 
disaccharide). Simple sugars are also called rapid sugars because they do not 
need digestion and are absorbed rapidly in our bloodstream.</p> 
<p>After being absorbed in our bloodstream, they rise blood glucose levels too 
high. This condition is called hyperglycemia, and is one of the symptoms of 
diabetes. If or pancreas function as it should, it will produce enough insulin 
to remove excess glucose from our bloodstream with amazing efficiency.</p> 
<p>But huge production of insulin can not be stopped in the same moment as 
sugar stop coming in the bloodstream. To much insulin will then cause too rapid 
fall of glucose level in the blood. That is called hypoglycemia, and symptoms 
may include depression, dizziness, crying spells, aggression, insomnia, 
weakness, and even loss of consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When blood glucose falls too low, our adrenal glands will mobilize the 
body's stores of glycogen (starch like carbohydrate , many glucose molecules 
hooked end to end in a chain,stored in liver and muscle) and will also 
stimulate the synthesis of glucose from proteins and other substances present 
in our body.</p> 
<p>A diet rich in sugars will catch our pancreas and adrenal glands in a 
biochemical see-saw, overworking them. It could weaken pancreas and result in 
diabetes. Cardiovascular complications that follow excess glucose or fats kill 
many diabetics.&nbsp;If our body is unable to use all of the extra fats and 
cholesterol produced from sugars,it must dump the additional load. Fats can be 
deposited in the cells of our liver, heart, arteries, fat tissues, kidneys, 
muscles, and other organs.&nbsp; That is beginning of&nbsp; fatty degeneration.
</p> 
<p>One of the aspects of fatty degeneration is deposition of visible fat in 
places where it is not normally found in healthy people. Fatty degeneration 
includes atherosclerosis, fatty liver and kidneys, some tumors, obesity and 
some forms of diabetes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sugars inhibit the function of our immune system, and increase diseases 
caused by poor immune function, such as colds, flu, AIDS, allergies, 
infections, ...</p> 
<p>Sugars increase our body's production of adrenaline by four times, which 
puts the body into a state of&nbsp; 'fight or flight'&nbsp; stress, without 
anything to fight or flee from , except the consumption of sugar. This stress 
reaction increases the production of both cholesterol and cortisone. Cortisone 
inhibits immune function.</p> 
<p>Sugars lack the vitamins and minerals required for their own metabolism. To 
be metabolized, sugars must draw on our body's stores of these nutrients. The 
more sugars you eat, the more vitamins and minerals you need.</p> 
<p>It can leach B, C, D&nbsp; vitamins, and those minerals:</p> 
<p>calcium, phosphorous, iron, selenium, zinc, chromium, vanadium, tin, boron, 
bismuth, rear earth elements etc. from our teeth, bones, and tissues.</p> 
<p>As these are depleted, our body becomes less able to carry out other 
functions that require minerals and vitamins to be present: to metabolize fats 
and cholesterol; to convert cholesterol into bile acids for removal from our 
body through the stool; or to burn-off excess fats as heat or increased 
activity. As a result , our cholesterol level rises; our metabolic rate goes 
down; fats burn more slowly; gall stones are crystallizing in or liver; we feel 
less like exercising, and our weight is increasing. &nbsp; We have already 
started walking our way to cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.</p> 
<p>As you see , sugar is where it all starts, I mean disease. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sugar causes irritation and weakening of the mucous membranes of the body 
and robs the teeth, bones and blood of a great percentage of their minerals. 
Inflammatory diseases of the breathing and digestive organs result from the use 
of brown and white sugar.</p> 
<p>If , after reading those facts you feel to stop eating sugar , we are 
recommending next alternatives:</p> 
<p>dry fruit, fresh fruit, fresh fruit juice,&nbsp; resins, apple syrup, rice 
malt, barley malt.</p> 
<p>But, do not just replace sugar with malt, or apple syrup.&nbsp; It is also 
important to generally decrease consumption of concentrated sweeteners. Eat 
more fresh fruit and compote.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The easiest way of decreasing consumption of sugar is by decreasing 
consumption of meat.</p> 
<h3>How to stop eating sugar ?</h3> 
<p>There is a balance between meat consumption and sugar.</p> 
<p>If you eat meat, you need sugar, and visa versa. Serious trouble can happen 
if the balance is off which is easy since sugar is addictive, like a drug. If 
you are a vegetarian and eat mostly carbohydrates, the effect of extra sugar is 
heightened.</p> 
<p>One of the major drawbacks is that sugar raises the insulin level, which 
inhibits the release of growth hormones, which in turn depresses the immune 
system. Not something you want to happen if you want to avoid sickness.</p> 
<p>According to Kathleen DesMaisons in her book Potatoes Not Prozac sugar 
sensitive people , those who have a more volatile reaction to the substance, 
usually have low levels of serotonin and low levels of beta endorphins.</p> 
<p>The level of beta endorphins have a direct impact on a person&rsquo;s self 
esteem, tolerance for pain, sense of connectiveness and to the ability to take 
personal responsibility for action. It follows that with higher levels of beta 
endorphins the disease management process would be easier.</p> 
<p>When blood sugar spikes it signals the adrenal glands to release more 
adrenaline. This leads to adrenal fatigue and in turn makes blood sugar ups and 
downs ever more pronounced. Note this, for many of us have adrenals already 
fatigued from overeating of sugar.</p> 
<p>According to William Duffy in &quot;Sugar Blues&quot; the difference 
between sugar addiction and narcotic addiction is largely one of degree. Here 
are some suggestions to make the withdrawal easier:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>As you are reducing the amount of sugar also reduce the amount of meat you 
are eating</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Eat a bit of ginger before meals</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Taking Colloidal minerals that contain trace minerals&nbsp;Chromium and 
Vanadium would solve problem of craving for Sugar and sweets !</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Craving for Sugar and sweets is a symptom of Chromium and Vanadium 
deficiency.</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t eat any concentrated sweetener for breakfast</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Eat your breakfast as late as possible and start with fruit</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Make pause between fruit and other food</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Never eat fruit together with a rest of food</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Make treats like cookies sweetened with rice syrup (a honey like sweetener 
made from cultured rice) or barley malt</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Get to know some new foods that have a subtle sweet taste from natural 
sugars. Try manna bread (tastes like a muffin but is made only from sprouted 
grains) or oatmilk.</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Get to know more about the sugar/depression/energy connection. Read Food 
and Healing, Sugar Blues, or Potatoes Not Prozac</p></li> </ul> 
<p>More about sugar:</p> 
<p>Sugars are classified as either simple or complex carbohydrates. Refined 
sugars such as white, brown, and turbinado sugars, and the unrefined simple 
sugars, such as fruit sweeteners and concentrated fruit juices, are all simple 
carbohydrates. The grain syrups: barley malt and brown rice syrup, contain 
complex carbohydrates besides some simple sugars.</p> 
<p>Complex carbohydrates are a string of simple sugars (glucose) strung 
together that must be broken back down into simple sugars before they can be 
absorbed into the bloodstream; whereas simple sugars can go directly into the 
bloodstream.</p> 
<p>An influx of sugar into the blood stream upsets the body's blood sugar 
balance, triggering the release of insulin, which the body uses to keep blood 
sugar at a safe and constant level. Insulin also promotes the storage of fat, 
so when you eat sweets high in sugar and fat, you're making way for rapid 
weight gain and elevated triglyceride levels, both of which have been linked to 
cardiovascular disease. Complex carbohydrates tend to be absorbed more slowly, 
lessening the impact on blood sugar levels.</p> 
<p>Refined sugars have been stripped of the vitamins, minerals, and fiber that 
were originally present before processing. White sugar is 99.9 percent sucrose, 
and brown and turbinado are 96 percent sucrose. Brown sugar is white sugar with 
molasses and/or caramel coloring added. Turbinado sugar, also called raw sugar, 
is slightly less refined and contains a trace amount of a few minerals.</p> 
<p>Consequently, consuming large amounts of refined sugars places an extra 
burden on the body to supply the nutrients, specifically the B vitamins, 
chromium, magnesium, and zinc, needed to convert glucose (blood sugar) into 
energy. According to USDA biochemist Richard Anderson, refined sugar may also 
impair the absorption of trace minerals like copper and chromium present in 
some of the other foods we have eaten.</p> 
<p>Refined simple sugars also have an impact on brain chemistry. They raise 
serotonin levels, which can leave you feeling drowsy. However, the unrefined 
simple fruit sweeteners have less impact on brain chemistry because they are 
high in the sugar fructose, which does not affect serotonin levels.</p> 
<p>Choosing natural sweeteners&nbsp; rich in complex carbohydrates and reading 
labels before buying a product will help you reduce your consumption of refined 
sugar. Natural sweeteners retain most of their vitamins and minerals, and many 
contain complex carbohydrates. Below is a list and brief description of some of 
the natural sweeteners available.</p>

from flowers. Although honey is a natural sweetener, it is considered a refined 
sugar because 96% of dry matter are simple sugars: fructose, glucose and 
sucrose.</p> </dd> 
<dd> 
<p>It is sweeter and higher in calories than refined white sugar. Honey does 
contain some B vitamins, minerals, and enzymes. However, the enzymes are 
generally destroyed by high heat causing the honey to lose nutritional 
properties when used in baking. God to use in special cures, but not as a every 
day food !</p> </dd>

<dt> Granulated Cane Juice </dt> 
<dd> 
<p>is made from organically grown sugar cane juice that has been filtered and 
dehydrated. Its a simple sugar that tastes much like brown or turbinado sugar; 
however, its less refined and contains more vitamins and minerals. Granulated 
cane juice can be used as a substitute for both white and brown sugar, but it 
is still rich in sucrose.</p> </dd>

<dt> Molasses </dt> 
<dd> 
<p>is a by&shy;product of the refined white, brown, and turbinado sugars. 
Sweet molasses or light molasses is the liquid left after the first extraction 
of sugar crystals. Blackstrap molasses is the liquid left after the last 
extraction of sugar crystals, and has a stronger, bittersweet flavor and is 
richer in potassium, calcium, iron, and B&shy;vitamins than sweet 
molasses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though molasses is better than white sugar, it still 
contain a lot of it, so I can not recommend eating molasses.</p> </dd>

<h3>Substituting One Sweetener For Another</h3> 
<p>by Don Buscher, MSN</p> 
<p>The granulated brown rice and cane juice sweeteners are roughly equal in 
sweetness to refined white, brown, or turbinado sugar and can be substituted on 
a cup for cup basis without changing t anything else in the recipe.</p> 
<p>When you substitute a liquid sweetener for a dry one or vice versa, you 
will have to adjust the recipe to end up with the right batter consistency. The 
chart (below) will help you modify your recipes when using natural sweeteners.
</p> 
<p>SWEETENER SUBSTITUTIONS</p> <br>

<p>To replace 1 cup dry sweetener with 1 cup liquid sweetener:</p> 
<p>reduce another liquid by 1/3 cup or add 4-5 tablespoons flour.</p> <br>

<p>To replace 1 cup dry sweetener with 3/4 cup honey:</p> 
<p>reduce another liquid by 1/4 cup or add 1/3 cup flour.</p> <br>

<p>To replace 1 cup liquid sweetener with 1 cup dry sweetener:</p> 
<p>add 1/3 cup water.</p> <br>

<p>To replace 1 cup liquid sweetener with 3/4 cup honey:</p> 
<p>add 1/4 cup water.</p> <br>

<p>Note: When using thick liquid sweeteners, heat the jar in hot water for 
five minutes to make pouring easier and spray measuring cups with vegetable 
spray to prevent sticking.</p> <br>

<p>Facts about White sugar consumption</p> 
<p>The average American consumes an astounding two pounds of sugar each week, 
which is not surprising considering that highly refined sugars in the forms of 
sucrose (table sugar), dextrose (corn sugar), and high-fructose corn syrup are 
being processed into so many foods such as bread, breakfast cereal, ketchup, 
mayonnaise, peanut butter, spaghetti sauce, and a plethora of microwave meals.
</p> 
<p>Adults purchase over 50% of all chocolate sold in USA.</p> 
<p>An average American consume 147 pounds of sweeteners each year.</p> 
<p>Monoglycerides used in some ice creams are a possible cancer causing agent 
in test animals.</p> <br>
