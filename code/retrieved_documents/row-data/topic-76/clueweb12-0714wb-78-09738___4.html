<h3> Ask Sarah: Sweeteners </h3> <br>
 This is the first Monday of Ask Sarah 
and I'm already having a good time. Thank you everyone for sending along your 
creative and thoughtful questions! I can't wait to share them with you.<br>
<br>
<b>Question from Amy in NYC:</b> A few months ago I gave up Splenda, mostly 
prompted by my friend asking me if I'd ever tasted it on it's own because it 
&quot;tastes like chemicals.&quot; So, my question is the following, what is 
your favorite natural sweetener? Agave nectar? Do tell.<br>
<br>
 I love this 
question because it reflects how totally confusing seemingly simple choices can 
be. Which reminds me of something...I was recently in line at a coffee shop and 
the woman in front of me ordered a turbo iced coffee with 6 artificial 
sweeteners, blueberry flavored syrup, and whipped cream on top. A COFFEE! But 
maybe she's thinking choosing a particular sweetener is the healthier choice 
because that's what the commercials tell her? I'd guess there are hundreds of 
natural and<i>less than natural</i> sweeteners on the market - all promising to 
be the best for you in their own way.<br>
<br>
<b>Amy, the short answer is that 
your friend is right.</b> Splenda is horrible for you and should be avoided at 
all costs (as should all artificial sweeteners including sweet'n'low, equal, 
nutrasweet etc). So, what to use?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>For coffee/tea:</b>
&nbsp; Try pure cane sugar. It's actually the least processed of granulated 
sugars and easiest on your body. That said, ideally you wouldn't put sugar in 
your coffee anymore but a few sprinkles a day really isn't a big deal. Try to 
test yourself and put a little less and less in each week and see if you can 
cut it down to just a little cane sugar or none at all. If the coffee shop 
doesn't have cane sugar then agave is also an okay choice. Stevia looks 
interesting and it sounds like a good idea although I feel like it's a new 
product and I don't really trust it yet. Stevia isn't approved by the FDA in 
the US, Canada, or the European Union because of concerns re: toxicity levels 
so don't try it until they feed it to the mice for 20 years then tell us the 
mice died or grew long noses or something gross...oh poor mice!<br>
<br>
<b>For 
cooking/baking:</b> If you're cooking/baking my favorite sweetener is maple 
syrup or other unprocessed, whole and natural foods. Get creative with cooking 
and incorporate sweet fruits and vegetables - add mashed bananas, dates, dark 
chocolate, top something with applesauce, make sweet potato muffins! Honey, 
agave, molasses, and cane sugar are also good substitutions but never cook with 
artificial sweeteners - your creations will taste like chemicals and your body 
will become intoxicated.<br>
<br>
 Since I don't have much of a sweet tooth I 
haven't experimented with other fun sounding items like rice syrup, barley 
malt, and date sugar. Have you?<br>
<br>
 So, moral of the story. Use items 
that are the least processed as possible. Find pure cane sugar for coffee but 
try to cut back on sugar in coffee and if cooking/baking use maple syrup, 
molasses, honey, sweet fruits and vegetables or pure cane sugar.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> Some of my favorite sweet treats using natural sweeteners: <br>
Raw Carrot 
Cake <br>
Grilled Nectarines with Honey &amp; Mint <br>
Chocolate Dipped Mango 
Bites <br>
<br>
 Interesting breakdown of white sugar substitutes - I need to 
test a few of these out! Have you had luck with any of these substitutions?<br>

<p>Oh Sarah this is so wonderful! Thanks so much for the information on 
sugars. I am always confused! I have recently switched from brown rice syrup to 
maple syrup but would love to omit sugar forever!<br>

<p>Sarah- <br>
<br>
I would love to know your thoughts on Stevia (which oddly 
enough I think tastes different than Truvia- although I believe it is supposed 
to be the same plant?) I gave up my Splenda addiction about a year ago and 
always bring my own Stevia packets to Starbucks every morning. The team is 
happy to add them to my green team lemonade (in place of the usual simple syrup 
they would typically add). Am I still putting a bad product into my body? Or is 
this all natural claim something I can trust? I would like to avoid adding 
extra calories to my morning addiction.<br>
<br>
PS- I love this blog and 
remembering all the fun family visits we had over the years! I still remember 
watching Adventures in Babysitting over and over again!</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>Hi Hannah!<br>
<br>
I think Stevia is a better option than splenda so in 
general it is a good switch. Here is what I know:<br>
<br>
This leafy herb has 
been used for centuries by native South Americans. The extract from stevia is 
100 to 300 times sweeter than white sugar. It can be used in cooking, baking 
and beverages, does not affect blood sugar levels, and has zero calories. 
Stevia is available in a powder or liquid form, but be sure to get the green or 
brown liquids or powders, because the white and clear versions are highly 
refined.<br>
<br>
So seek out the green or brown unrefined stevia (may have to 
call a few specialty stores) but the real goal is to wean yourself off of it 
(eek I know!). A little here and there won't hurt but in general try to add 
less and less over the next month and see how you feel.<br>
<br>
Good luck!</p>
