<p><strong>White Sugar Blues<br>
 By Carina Goodrich</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Why Change to other sweeteners for good eyesight?</strong></p> 
<p>I just finished reading &lsquo;Beekeeping for Dummies&rsquo;, like 
obviously many other (crazy?) folk, I am excited by the idea of 
&lsquo;growing&rsquo; and harvesting my own honey.&nbsp; For all of my life, 
&lsquo;alternative&rsquo; sweeteners have been the norm, due to my 
mother&rsquo;s interest in nutritional health and good eyesight.&nbsp; Honey is 
the main sweetener we use, being able to find local fresh and raw honey out 
here in the countryside.&nbsp; With four sweet tooths (or is it teeth?) in the 
house, we definitely get through the honey.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Aside from the fascinating world that honey opens your eyes to, and the 
amazing properties of other natural sugar substitutes, why avoid white sugar? 
There are several reasons. The most prominent in relation to refractive error 
has to do with a trace mineral called chromium. White sugar in the body sneaks 
into the mineral reserves and steals away chromium. A lack of chromium has been 
demonstrated to be a significant factor in the development of 
myopia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Chromium is essential for glucose utilization in muscle fibers, making it 
necessary for good muscle function. Chromium aids in the process of glucose 
uptake in insulin receptors, affecting spleen function and other blood sugar 
issues.&nbsp; Sufficient levels of chromium allow the muscle around the lens to 
sustain near focus as well as the ability to change focal length, for extended 
periods.</p> 
<p>Chromium is a nutrient that already tends to be a bit scarce particularly 
in the standard modern diet.&nbsp; The effect of white sugar leaching already 
scanty chromium supplies in the body is of major concern in our modern world 
where sugar is packed into just about every kind of processed food imaginable, 
and in much higher quantities than our bodies were designed to cope with. 
Particularly for children on a white sugar, white flour, even moderate amount 
of junk food diet, the sugar intake is enough to cause life-long effects.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>Some of these are visible, such as blood sugar imbalances resulting in 
behavioral changes, or obesity, but some effects are internal and only show 
themselves through symptoms such as reduced vision.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 It is 
interesting to note that the World Health Organization listed processed sugar 
as one of the five substances to which citizens of industrial nations are 
addicted.</p> 
<p>Foods which contain biologically available chromium include: brewer&rsquo;s 
yeast, liver, wheat germ (fresh), whole wheat, beetroot, thyme and 
mushrooms.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sugar also affects your moods, meaning that a habit of going on the 
&lsquo;sugar hit&rsquo; rollercoaster can be rough on your state of mind and 
those around you.&nbsp; The boost to your blood sugar level that comes with 
white sugar is hard and fast, then quickly drops you in the energy and mood 
trough, looking for the next hit.&nbsp; Your body actually craves complex 
foods, which provide energy to burn for hours, and minerals to keep all the 
cell processes going.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even if you eat a generally healthy diet, containing plenty of fresh fruit 
and vegetables, pretty much eliminating white sugar from your diet will help 
your visual system to better achieve the required nutrient levels for good 
eyesight. Be aware that often a craving for sugar indicates a lack of minerals 
in the body. Try increasing your nutritional mineral intake to help make a 
quicker transition from sugar cravings to good food cravings, and improve your 
energy levels.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Bodies are made of food,&rdquo; said Dr. Janet Goodrich in her book H
<em>elp Your Child to Perfect Eyesight without Glasses</em>.&nbsp; Everyday 
remind yourself that food is both your fuel and what all the new cells in your 
body are made from.&nbsp; Food is also a comfort and a pleasure.&nbsp; I 
believe in a diet that is 85-95% healthy and body wise, and the other 5-15% for 
enjoyment of life in a body!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Whether you live in the city or the country, food producers are finding 
better ways to process and distribute natural foods that give sweetness without 
the negative side effects of sugar.&nbsp; Alternatives such as stevia (an herb 
which is actually good for you, and many many times sweeter than sugar), maple 
syrup and fruit juice concentrates are more and more available, and being 
chosen by consumers as the facts about white sugar (and artificial sweeteners) 
continue to emerge into the mainstream.</p> 
<p>Please remember that artificial sweeteners are usually toxic and we do not 
recommend them. When finding substitutes for sugar, ensure that they are 
natural products, which your body will be able to enjoy, process and eliminate 
without harmful side effects.</p> 
<p>My favourite, honey, is the oldest known sweetener and has many health 
benefits when eaten raw. These derive from its antibacterial qualities and the 
presence of small amounts of pollen (which is very high in nutrients).&nbsp;<br>
 Many cultures ingest approx. 1 teaspoon per day of raw honey as a nutritional 
supplement.&nbsp; Eating raw local honey in this manner (harvested within a 50 
mile radius) can also help relieve the symptoms of pollen related allergies.</p>
<p>When used in baking honey helps baked goods stay fresh and moist 
longer.&nbsp; Be aware that strong flavoured honeys may influence the taste, so 
choose a mild flavoured honey for cooking.&nbsp; In<em>Beekeeping for Dummies
</em>, Howland Blackiston offers the following helpful advice: when 
substituting honey for sugar in baking, follow these guidelines;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe by &frac14; cup for each cup of 
honey used.</li> 
<li>Add &frac12; teaspoon of baking soda for each cup of honey.</li> 
<li>Reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees (F) to prevent overbrowning.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Ask at your local supermarket and health food store for their range of 
natural sugar substitutes.&nbsp; And if you can find a source of fresh, raw 
honey, it&rsquo;s definitely worth it to stock up!&nbsp; (Honey also keeps very 
well.&nbsp; Stores were found in the tombs of the Egyptian Pharaohs that were 
still edible!)</p>

<p>Sugar can easily be replaced by honey. I&rsquo;ve eaten honey as part of my 
healhty diet whilte I was restoring my vision. Here are some useful things to 
know about honey&hellip; There are different types of it, and here&rsquo;s what 
makes honey good:</p> 
<p>Diostase level &ndash; the higher the better. 50 + is very good, 10 &ndash; 
poor (this is what most honey you&rsquo;l see in your shop today is)</p> 
<p>Sucrose level &ndash; the less, the better (you get some artificial sugar 
added sometimes to add weight etc &ndash; watch that!)</p> 
<p>Moisture level &ndash; the less moisture a honey has, then better. 
It&rsquo;s something to do with it&rsquo;s age.</p> 
<p>Other things to thinlk about if you care about your health:<br>
 - replace 
white rise with borwn<br>
 - replace whilte bread with brown<br>
 - no solt<br>

 - cut down or elliminate ocnsumption of milk, as your body abd bones only need 
it mostly when youre still growing</p>

<p>Wow Carina, I just found your blog because I did a search on cinnamon 
&ndash; ever time I use it, I find that my night vision improves. So I was 
intrigued by this. do you have any comments about cinnamon or any awareness of 
its affects for vision?</p> </li>

<p>i used Stevia extract as a sugar substitute because i am diabetic. Stevia 
is really sweeter than sucrose.~&ndash;</p> </li>

<p>i was also reading somewhere that the bees are becoming extinct, there 
getting something called the bee flu and when they return back to the hive they 
actually infect the entire hive and that is slowly killing off the bee 
population. its really sad because so many people depend on honey and its 
natural ingreadents for many things.. i use honey as a tool for weight loss.</p>

<p>I cook my oatmeal with milk already (first in water, then milk). Aside from 
peanut butter, as Heather mentioned, I also like a couple tbsp grated coconut, 
or a banana and cinnamon, or raisins, apricots, or any kind of nut in any 
combo. Prunes are good &hellip;</p> </li> </ol> <strong>Leave a Reply</strong>
