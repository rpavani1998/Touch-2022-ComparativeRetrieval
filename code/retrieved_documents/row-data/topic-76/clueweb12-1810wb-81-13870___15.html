 Remembering Rosemary 
|&nbsp;Print&nbsp;| &nbsp;E-mail <br>
<br>
 Written by Stephanie Barron of 
Artisan Naturals &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p><strong>Featured Ingredient:</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rosemary essential oil</strong> (<em>Rosmarinus 
officinalis</em>) has stimulating properties that are purported to increase 
skin cell turnover, and improve circulation.&nbsp;The scent is uplifting and 
stimulating which can in turn diminish mental fatigue and improve mental 
clarity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 2002, when I was in my Esthetician program, we 
literally had a major test once a week so we were always cramming. The group at 
my table passed around a little vial of Rosemary essential oil to inhale as we 
focused on the subject for that week. I can&rsquo;t say for sure that it was 
the Rosemary that helped, but the students at our table consistently received 
better scores than the rest of the class.</p> 
<p><strong>History:</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Middle Ages, Rosemary was burned for fumigations that 
were used to drive away evil spirits and protect from plague.</p><strong>Recipe:
</strong> 
<p><strong>Rosemary Scalp Therapy</strong></p> 
<p>4 ounces of Jojoba oil</p> 
<p>20 drops of Rosemary Essential Oil</p> 
<p>10 drops of Lavender Essential Oil</p> 
<p>5 drops of Sandalwood Essential Oil</p> 
<p>2 drops of Clove Essential Oil</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Directions:</strong> Mix all of the ingredients in a plastic bottle 
with a dispensing cap. Shake well and apply to roots. For best results, leave 
on at least 30 minutes before washing hair. For added benefit, gently warm oil 
in hot water bath or microwave before applying.</p> 
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Use this recipe for dry scalp, dandruff, eczema, or 
whenever you want an aromatic pick me up.</p> <br>

 Curb Your 
Cravings and Get Off the Sugar Treadmill for Some &ldquo;Sweet&rdquo; Relief 
<br> <br>
 Written by Donya Fahmy of Dropwise Essentials  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p> <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you aware of the effect sugar has on the 
way you feel everyday? Is the short-lived euphoria you experience when eating a 
sweet treat followed by feelings of depression, crankiness or even mental fog? 
Do you find yourself reaching for another snack or sweet to counteract those 
feelings or just to feel better? If you answered yes, then you are probably a 
true sugar addict. How can you know for sure?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; People with 
a &ldquo;sweet tooth&rdquo; report many of the same common symptoms that all 
addicts have: increased consumption of the substance over a short period of 
time, withdrawal symptoms when it is denied, and regular intense cravings for 
it. Apparently, sugary treats stimulate the brain&rsquo;s reward center in the 
same way that alcohol and drugs do, by sparking the release of the pleasure 
chemical dopamine.</p> <br>

 Texture is 
Back! <br>
<br>
 Written by Robyn Atticks of Shear Miracle Organics  
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Say good-bye to flat, perfectly straight hair &amp; say hello 
to texture. Texture has an organic character. It&rsquo;s hair with a 
personality ~ soft, fun &amp; free! Curls, waves &amp; body are what are going 
on right now. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of hair that is purposefully perfectly 
messy with a little frizz &amp; wildness to it. Embrace the beauty of Texture!
<br> <br>
 Keeping your Terrific Textured Tresses looking fabulous is your top 
priority. So what are the most important things to know?<br>
<br>
 When 
coloring your hair, you will want to find a stylist that uses naturally 
inspired ammonia-free hair color. Bold color can enhance textured hair by 
boosting shine, making curls look healthier. Are you a stylist or salon owner

&nbsp; Looking for a salon who uses organic products? 
http://www.shearmiraclesorganichaircare.com/content/salons <br>
<br>
 Textured 
hair is naturally more porous &amp; drier than straight hair. Using the right 
products is key to easy beautiful hair. Prepping your hair with only the purest 
products is the first place to begin. Use a shampoo &amp; conditioner suitable 
for your hair type that is made with organic ingredients. Why? There are many 
harmful ingredients that are added to most products available, such as 
sulfates, which can dry out your hair, stripping your hair of its natural oils 
that protect it. Researching the ingredients in your products to find out why 
they are used &amp; what benefit they have is important. To find out what 
ingredients are used in Shear Miracle Organics &amp; why, please visit:
http://www.shearmiraclesorganichaircare.com/content/ingredients <br>
 The key 
to terrific texture is to polish the natural curl pattern by making sure hair 
has enough moisture. Don&rsquo;t rinse out the conditioner all the way.<br>
<br>
 Once hair is prepped, shake your curls loosely &amp; work a light to medium 
hold gel evenly through your hair. Again, check your ingredients &amp; insist 
on only putting products on your hair that will keep it healthy &amp; 
beautiful. Avoid using anything with alcohol, silicones or plastics. One 
favorite by SMO isElevate Spray Gel. This vegan &amp; gluten-free (all SMO hair 
products are) medium hold gel is perfect for non-tacky style ease. The more the 
hair is manipulated, the softer the hair becomes while still providing all day 
hold. After sitting under a hair dryer, allowing the hair to dry naturally or 
gently using the diffuser, it&rsquo;s time to finish the hair. A good curl 
enhancing cream or pomade will keep textured hair silky, shiny &amp; healthy. 
Usually with these types of products, a little goes a long way. Again, watch 
out for pomades made with petroleum, mineral oil or wax. SMO&rsquo;sBee Waxed 
Pomade is made of shea butter (no, not bee&rsquo;s wax) &amp; hemp seed oil, 
which deeply moisturizes &amp; nourishes the hair from it&rsquo;s roots giving 
soft, frizz-free texture. For extra volume, turn your head upside down &amp; 
rub your fingers on your scalp, lifting the hair away from your scalp &amp; 
scrunch the pomade on your ends.<br>
<br>
 You are now ready to add some 
texture to your life? Texture is taking over. Have fun with it.<br>

 Your skin needs you! |&nbsp;Print&nbsp;| &nbsp;E-mail 
<br> <br>
 Written by Robyn Atticks of Shear Miracles  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p>Everyone wants to look good and stay healthy, right? A simple way to do 
this is to properly care for your skin. Your skin needs you!<br>
<br>
Skin is 
the largest organ of your body and serves as a protective barrier between the 
inside you and the outside you. The story of your life can be seen through your 
skin. It can tell people everything from what you eat to where you live. Ok, 
maybe not exactly what you eat or exactly where you live, but pretty close. 
Skin is affected by everything that you do. That's because skin acts like your 
body's filter.</p>What does your skin say about your life's story?<br>

<p>We all know what unhealthy skin looks like. Sallow, dull, uneven 
appearance, wrinkles develop easier, are deeper and more noticeable. Sometimes 
skin will be excessively oily or dry, have blemishes and even rashes can occur. 
How do you keep these things from happening?<br>
Skin is in a constant state of 
growth with old cells dying and new cells forming. Because of this, properly 
taking care of your skin isn't only about how you look. It's also about being 
healthy. That's why Shear Miracles by Robyn ~ Organic Salon Products takes 
&quot;A Holistic Approach to Beauty for Salons &amp; Spas&quot; bringing 
awareness to the fact that it just doesn't make sense to use products with 
ingredients that harm your health to enhance your beauty. According to the The 
American Heritage&reg; Dictionary of the English Language holistic means 
emphasizing the importance of the whole and the interdependence of its parts. 
Another words, we care about your whole person.</p>
<p><br>
Since your skin is constantly growing and changing, you can see why 
it&rsquo;s important to be vigilant in daily taking care of it.&nbsp; Keep your 
skin hydrated by drinking plenty of&nbsp; water throughout the day, and 
maintain a balanced diet to provide the vitamins and minerals your skin needs. 
Stick with fresh organic fruits and vegetables, whole sprouted grains and foods 
high in Omega 3s.</p>
<p><br>
Proper skincare also involves cleansing it properly, feeding it with 
nutrient rich ingredients. That's why we use milk and honey in all of our 
facial cleansers along with carefully selected herbs and oils that work at 
bringing your skin into proper balance. (We have an equally effective Vegan 
Cleanser with an organic apple juice base, too.) Milk and honey have wonderful 
hydrating antimicrobial and cleansing properties and are greatly enhanced when 
used together, giving the skin a glow while containing many anti-aging benefits.
<br>Honey prevents infection, speeds healing, and moisturizes the skin. Packed 
with antioxidants, honey can protect your skin against the damaging effects of 
the sun and prevent premature wrinkling. The properties in milk gently 
exfoliate and soothe your skin keeping it soft and supple.</p>
<p><br>
Your skin also needs to be hydrated. Hydration refers to the amount of 
water found in your skin. When&nbsp; your skin is properly hydrated it will be 
smooth and plump (verses saggy and flaky). Neglecting this most important part 
of your skin's health, can result in blemishes, wrinkles and many more negative 
effects. Eat plenty organic fresh fruits and vegetables. Drink at least 1/2 
your body weight of pure water in oz per day. Avoid using toners. These contain 
drying agents that do more harm than good for your skin. We recommend our 
specially designed hydrators that we have formulated for each specific skin 
type.</p>
<p><br>
Since your face is always showing, it gets exposed to all the elements 
of life. The sun, wind, air pollutants, you name it - so it needs extra 
moisture to keep it balanced and healthy. Even if you feel like you have oily 
skin, it needs to be moisturized.&nbsp; Oily skin is out of balance and getting 
it into balance will help your skin produce the perfect amount of oil that your 
skin needs. (Many customers, after using just 1 full set of our Shear Delight 
Organic Skincare system for oily skin, have reported that they no linger have 
skin that is excessively oily. They then switch to out Miracles Happen 
Anti-Aging or Natural Beauty Normal Skincare System.) Moisturizers prevent 
wrinkles, protects from environmental stress and damage, improves overall 
complexion and your makeup application will be smoother and more even.</p>
<p><br>
These 3 steps are essential to properly caring for your skin. </p>

 Sugar Showdown! Finding Healthier Substitutes for Your Sweet Tooth 
|&nbsp;Print&nbsp;| &nbsp;E-mail <br>
<br>
 Written by Donya Fahmy of Dropwise 
Essentials &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p>It seems like lately, every time you turn on the television or radio, or 
pick up a magazine there&rsquo;s a story about sugar and its role in the 
nation&rsquo;s growing epidemic of diabetes and obesity. You&rsquo;ve likely 
been hearing a new term called Diabesity, which encompasses the intricate 
relationship between sugar, diabetes, and obesity.<br>
<br>
Ever since the 
American Heart Association&rsquo;s 2009 recommendation to limit our daily 
consumption of added sugar to between 100 and 150 calories (vs. the 355+ 
calories that is actually consumed), the link between our overly sugar-laden 
diets and our ever-expanding waistlines has become painfully clear.<br>
<br>

Understanding the potential health consequences of eating too much sugar is one 
thing, knowing what to do about it is an entirely different story &hellip; 
Looking at sugar consumption as a long-term health imperative rather than a 
simple weight management issue might give you the motivation you need to tackle 
it. Start with small manageable steps and work up from there.</p>
<p><br>
First, aim to significantly reduce your consumption of (and eventually 
eliminate) highly processed sugars like corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup 
&ndash;which can be addicting and wreak havoc with your blood sugar levels.<br>

<br>The next step (which can also be taken simultaneously) is to substitute 
whole grains for white flour and add more raw fruits and vegetables. After 
that, try to uncover all the hidden sources of added sugar that may be 
sabotaging your best intentions, and find healthier alternatives. I&rsquo;m 
talking about sugar that&rsquo;s added to less obvious things like peanut 
butter and spaghetti sauces, and frozen, canned, or other packaged foods. Avoid 
fruit juices with added sugar and watch out for those flavored yogurts that 
boast only 150 calories per serving! Some of those tiny containers have as much 
as 45 or 50 grams of sugar per serving!<br>
<br>
Last, but not least, become a 
savvy consumer of alternative sweeteners. The marketplace for alternative and 
especially natural sweeteners has exploded over the past few years, but with no 
practical means to evaluate all the options, the average consumer still turns 
to artificial sweeteners like NutraSweet, Equal, or Splenda, as low-calorie 
solutions to manage their weight.<br>
<br>
The problem with artificial 
sweeteners is they may actually contribute to obesity because they trick the 
body into thinking they&rsquo;re sugar molecules. When the tongue and brain 
recognize sugar the body produces insulin. Excess insulin in the body is 
converted into fat, leading to weight gain. Several studies support this 
finding while others conclude that Aspartame, for example, may be neuro-toxic 
under certain conditions and should be avoided altogether.<br>
<br>
So how can 
you work your way through the maze of alternative sweeteners (natural and 
synthetic) to find the right substitute? Here are some quick tips to help you 
get started:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare Glycemic Index Scores. Look 
first and foremost for the impact of a sweetener on your blood sugar levels. 
The easiest way is to find its Glycemic Index (GI) score and compare it to that 
of white sugar (68). The Glycemic Index basically measures how fast 
carbohydrates convert to glucose in the blood. The higher the number the faster 
the conversion. Lower numbers are better. Honey is in the 70s, maple syrup is 
around 55 and high fructose corn syrup is just above 90, while palm sugar is 
around 35 and agave nectar is in the low teens.<br>
<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Sugar By Any Other Name. Make sure that your sweetener of 
choice isn&rsquo;t simply another version of white sugar. Most of the sugar in 
the food and beverages that people purchase at the supermarket is refined cane 
sugar. Evaporated sugar cane juice is simply the solid that remains when sugar 
cane juice evaporates. It&rsquo;s considered less refined than white sugar but 
has the same GI score so avoid products made with this sweetener.<br>
<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weigh Pros &amp; Cons. Not all natural sweeteners are 
created equal. Some have better GI scores than sugar but no nutritive benefits. 
Others like Molasses, are high in minerals and antioxidants but not suitable 
for broad use as a sweetener. Stevia has added health benefits, almost no 
calories, and a GI score of zero, but sometimes leaves a bitter after taste. 
Sugar alcohols like Xylitol and Erythritol are very low in calories and have 
dental health benefits but are not natural and if eaten in excess, can have a 
laxative effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context, Texture and Taste. 
Find out which natural sweeteners work best for sweetening beverages and which 
work best for cooking and baking. Many times, these may not be one and the 
same. Erythritol and Stevia are often recommended for sweetening beverages, 
while Brown Rice Syrup (made from sprouted brown rice) and Agave tend to work 
better for baked goods. Keep in mind, the latter are liquids so they 
can&rsquo;t be used spoon for spoon as a substitute for table sugar in recipes.
<br><br>
Above all, stay open minded and willing to experiment with different 
types and brands of sweeteners, until you find the right combination for your 
particular needs. Remember to balance your taste buds&rsquo; needs with your 
body&rsquo;s overall health needs and don&rsquo;t rely strictly on substitutes 
as a way of managing your weight or your blood sugar levels. Try to get most of 
your sugar from natural sources and limit the amount of sugar per serving to 12 
grams or less.</p>

 Is Your Love Affair with Sweets 
Sabotaging Your Weight Loss Efforts and Putting You at Risk? <br>
<br>
 Written 
by Donya Fahmy of Dropwise Essentials &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s a new year and every new year brings with it &ldquo;New 
Year&rsquo;s resolutions&rdquo; designed to help us improve our lives in some 
way &ndash;either by ditching a bad habit or acquiring some new good habits. By 
far, the most common New Year&rsquo;s resolutions have something to do with 
losing weight or getting into shape. And somehow, no matter how well 
intentioned these resolutions are, for many of us, our weight loss efforts 
never seem to really get off the ground.<br>
<br>
If losing weight and getting 
into shape were that simple we all would have accomplished it by now! The truth 
is, there are many factors that contribute to weight gain, and consequently our 
ability to successfully manage our weight. While most of us are focused on how 
to lose weight we may be ignoring an even more insidious health threat that 
coincidentally, also hinders our ability to diet successfully.</p>Whether you 
follow the weight loss advice of health gurus like Dr. Oz or Dr. Mercola, or if 
you keep up with the latest findings on weight loss, one thing is becoming very 
clear: managing your body&rsquo;s insulin response is the key to not just 
weight loss but to ultimate health. That&rsquo;s because too much sugar creates 
a cascade of health problems that not only hinder our attempts to lose weight 
and keep it off, they put us at risk for chronic inflammation which is now 
considered to be the main contributing factor in the development of most 
diseases &ndash;including heart disease and even cancer.<br>

<p>The statistics on sugar consumption are staggering. By one estimate, the 
average American consumes over 150 pounds of sugar and sweeteners (like corn 
syrup) every year! Phew! That&rsquo;s a LOT of sugar. According to research and 
analysis firm Datamonitor, U.S. consumers&rsquo; reliance on sugar and 
sweeteners for total energy consumption is more than twice the global average.
<br><br>
Other studies indicate that 75% of the American diet is made up of 
refined carbohydrates like sugar, white flour, white pasta and potatoes. It 
turns out that sugar is actually more fattening than fat. What that means for 
anyone who is serious about losing weight and getting healthy is cutting way 
back on sugar and simple carbohydrates, which your body quickly converts into 
sugar!<br>
<br>
Sugars and starches are carbohydrates and carbohydrates are one 
of our body&rsquo;s main sources of energy (the other being fat). When your 
body needs energy it will first look for carbohydrates to burn as fuel. If 
there are fewer sources of carbohydrates available, then your body will break 
down your fat reserves for energy. That&rsquo;s the key to successful weight 
loss and maintenance. By limiting your intake of sugars and starches, you force 
your body to use up your fat reserves instead.<br>
<br>
What happens if you 
don&rsquo;t? The opposite. When you consume more sugar than your body needs for 
energy, your blood sugar becomes elevated so your pancreas secretes a hormone 
called insulin. Insulin is designed to balance blood sugar by carrying glucose 
to your cells where it is normally burned off for energy. Storing sugar in 
these cells is your body&rsquo;s way of balancing its blood sugar levels. This 
is a normal insulin response. But if we consume more sugar than our body needs 
for energy then the excess insulin in our blood is stored as fat to be burned 
for energy at some point in the future.<br>
<br>
Like it or not, most of us 
have become addicted to sugar in one if not all of its various forms. Our love 
affair with sweets leads to consistently elevated blood sugar levels. When that 
happens, our energy-burning cells begin to become resistant to the action of 
insulin (hence the term &ldquo;insulin resistance&rdquo;).<br>
<br>
If insulin 
can&rsquo;t be balanced due to insulin resistance, our entire hormonal system 
can be thrown out of whack, leading to unintended weight gain and ultimately to 
diabetes and obesity. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that as we age 
our metabolic processes slow down and we simply don&rsquo;t need as many 
carbohydrates as we did when we were younger, so our continuing overconsumption 
of sugars and simple carbs makes it all the more difficult to lose those extra 
pounds!<br>
<br>
While weight gain is the most visible result of this hormonal 
imbalance, a much deeper more insidious process is taking place within our 
bodies that is far more dangerous to our long-term health. Sugar is acidic, so 
when large quantities of sugar remain in the body, it creates an acidic and 
hostile environment that leads to cellular damage and inflammation. This causes 
us to age prematurely on the inside as well as on the outside.<br>
<br>

According to Dr. Andrew Weil, sugar and other refined carbohydrates appear to 
trigger a chemical reaction that creates pro-inflammatory compounds in the 
body. A conclusion that is further supported by the findings of a 2010 study 
published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that women who 
consume excess sugar are prone to chronic inflammation.<br>
<br>
If 
you&rsquo;ve resolved to lose weight and get healthy this year, first consider 
some of the ways you can cut back on your consumption of sugar (especially 
processed sugars) and simple carbohydrates. Part of the trick is to free 
yourself from the addictive taste of sweets and the best way to do it is to go 
cold turkey for a couple of weeks. This may seem difficult at first, but you 
may also be surprised to learn that after doing without for a while, you no 
longer crave sweets as much as you once did. If you&rsquo;re really lucky you 
might actually find the overly sugary taste of certain foods a turn off to your 
taste buds!</p>

 A Healing Story from 
Grateful Body <br>
<br>
 Written by Shannon Schroter  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p> <br>
<strong>The Incredible Healing Power of Plants</strong><br>
<br>
 
Recently, I had a serious accident - a big pot of boiling oil spilled and 
gushed over my hand. I received deep 2nd degree burns over the top and inside 
surface of my right hand. Thanks to working intimately with herbs since the 
early 80's, I've seen some pretty wonderful and compelling things - magical 
healing and miraculous recoveries. So by the time I had returned from the 
emergency room, I had already decided to rely on plant medicines to treat my 
burn.<br>
<br>
 This article is basically a super-quick account of the healing 
process. It also details the plant medicines I relied on for treatment. Most of 
these herbs are thesame ones that we use to make Grateful Body Skin Care 
products. I have only one reason for recounting this incident for you . . . to 
vividly demonstrate the capacity of whole plants to keep your skin healthy, 
protected and thriving.<br>
<br>
 This burn experience has been an 
uncomfortable yet validating journey, because Grateful Body has been preaching 
the advantage of using whole, vital plants to take care of your skin for over a 
decade. We are always saying that real skin care is about one thing -<strong>
infusing the skin with an abundance of authentic, vital nourishment</strong>. 
My badly burned skin has healed well, with almost zero scarring, thanks to that 
philosophy and a generous community of friends in the plant kingdom.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>~ Shannon, Grateful Body Product Formulator</em> <br>
<br>
<em>&rarr; 
<strong>WARNING!</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;Graphic pictures of burned skin at the 
bottom of this article!</em></p><br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
my burned hand, I've got what looks like a giant, charred marshmallow on the 
end of my arm - it smells like a deep-fried ashtray.<em>(It's my sword hand, so 
I must be extra aware of ninjas.)</em> In the emergency room they gave me 
morphine and that was swell but I've already decided that I will treat this 
burn myself. My main concern now is to prevent infection and to see if I can 
reduce the inflammation. Several times a day I'm putting big juicy slabs of 
fresh<strong> aloe vera1</strong> on the wound - it's very comforting. I am 
also using a poultice of the fresh leaves of<strong>comfrey2</strong> and 
<strong>plantain3</strong>. I mix it in with the aloe, it feels like it's 
drawing the heat out. Soon, I make a paste with<strong>sangre de grado4</strong>
- a blood red sap from the Amazon tree - and mix in<strong> goldenseal5</strong>
and freshly ground<strong>turmeric root6</strong> to prevent infection. It 
doesn't hurt that much now - but that will change.<br>

Grateful Body products</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 <em>In Aphrodite's Feast and

Fungal/Rx</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 <em>In ClearSkin/Rx</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 
<em>We use turmeric as a preservative - it's found in most Grateful Body 
products.</em> <br>
<br>
&nbsp; <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm happy to see the 
bright crimson color fading and the skin is beginning to firm up a little - but 
it still looks like jabba the hut. I'm still concerned about infection, so I add
<strong> echinacea5</strong> and <strong>tulsi6</strong> <em> (holy basil)</em> 
to my herbal paste. It's clear that I must work to ease tissue trauma; for this 
I make a salve of<strong> figwort7</strong>, <strong> burdock8</strong>, 
<strong> red clover9</strong>, <strong> yellow dock10</strong> and <strong>
plantain11</strong>  using <strong>borage extract12</strong> as the base. This 
smells and feels very good and is also helping to stop the very annoying cycle 
of blisters abruptly appearing, bursting and then discharging various weird 
fluids. It's a bummer but I'm really grateful for this 'front-seat' view for 
watching the amazing healing capacity of the skin when appropriately supported.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's still some heat radiating from the burn area. I can't 
even imagine all the different healing processes that must be going on, but if 
I put my emotional reactions to the side for a little bit, I can get a sense of 
the vast, instinctual intelligence of the body. But this insight is brief, for 
it really hurts now - there's a lot of nerve damage to repair. And there's a 
fair amount of swelling. So swelling and pain are my guides. Before I go to bed 
I cover it with a new ointment of<strong>calendula13</strong>  (marigold), 
<strong>white willow bark14</strong> and <strong>st. john's wort15</strong> and 
tightly wrap it. The firmer I wrap my hand the better it feels - just holding 
it tight is very comforting. I keep daydreaming about lavender, so I add to my 
schedule a regular application of<strong> lavender16</strong>, <strong> rosemary
17</strong> and <strong>helichrysum18</strong>  essential oils. Just the 
wafting aroma is enough to heal.<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been 
a challenge, but it's clear the crisis state is over and the pain is almost 
gone. Now I'm using a concentrated lotion of<strong> rosehip seed oil19</strong>
,<strong> meadowsweet oil20</strong> and <strong>witch hazel21</strong>  with 
<strong>millet seed22</strong>, <strong> horsetail23</strong>, <strong> gotu 
kola24</strong> and <strong>marshmallow root25</strong>. I carry it around in a 
little bottle and it really helps to soothe, smooth and lubricate the rapidly 
healing skin. The skin is very, very thirsty now and absorbs this lotion 
quickly. I've also made a salve from<strong> reishi26</strong> and <strong>
chaga mushrooms27</strong> to stimulate the skin's immune strength. I feel very 
lucky to be with Grateful Body, surrounded by all these super-fine plants and 
oils. And I've had a genuine personal experience - a potent validation - of how 
effective and healing<em>'biologically appropriate'</em> and <em> 'whole-plant 
based'</em> skin care can be. <br>

 Take the Edge Off 
the Holidays: 5 Natural Holiday Stress Relief Tips <br>
<br>
 Written by Donya 
Fahmy of Dropwise Essentials &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<p>The holidays are usually a joyous and wonderful time of the year for most, 
but for many of us they can also be very stressful. Whether it&rsquo;s related 
to gift-giving anxiety, travel upsets, inclement weather, difficult family 
dynamics, isolation or overindulgence, this time of year can make us all more 
susceptible to colds, flu, fatigue, depression and general malaise.<br>
<br>

Instead of allowing ourselves to go into hibernation mode as there is less and 
less sunlight during the holiday season, we pull our coats tight and brave the 
cold weather, traffic jams, crowds, and long lines to get our gift shopping 
done (often at the last minute). We stay out late, drink too much, eat too 
much, and scramble under pressure to complete projects or plans before the 
close of the year.<br>
<br>
Add the pressure of living up to the expectations 
of family and the inevitable weather-related travel upsets and you&rsquo;ve got 
a recipe for major stress.<br>
<br>
So what can you do to take a little bit of 
the edge off this time of year? Here are some tips to help you keep your stress 
to a minimum and improve your mood so you can enjoy the holiday season with 
some sanity:<br>
<br>
Get plenty of rest. Stay hydrated and remember to breathe 
&hellip; deeply! Try to get at least 8 hours of sleep a night or make up for 
lost sleep by taking naps or sleeping in. Lower alcohol consumption and drink 
plenty of other fluids, especially water, to stay hydrated. And remember to 
breathe deeply.<br>
<br>
Avoid refined carbohydrates and sugars. OK, I know 
this is a tough one, but it can make a huge difference in how you feel! Refined 
carbs tend to spike then deplete your serotonin levels leaving you exhausted. 
So, indulge a little, but try to stick to healthier treats like dark chocolate 
or seasonal fruits. Balance things out by eating serotonin-enhancing foods like 
whole grains, root vegetables, beans, legumes, seeds and nuts, along with a 
little lean protein (turkey or fish).<br>
<br>
Slow down. Take time to savor 
and enjoy the rituals of the season. Stay present with yourself and everyone 
around you and practice forgiveness and acceptance. Remember, you can choose to 
let go of whatever is troubling you for the moment.<br>
<br>
Reach out to 
others, especially those in need. The holidays can magnify feelings of 
isolation or loneliness for those who can&rsquo;t be with family or don&rsquo;t 
have family to be with. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to reach out for help and comfort 
if you are in need. Helping others in need also has a profoundly healing and 
uplifting effect, both physiological and psychological.<br>
<br>
Surround 
yourself with uplifting and nurturing sounds and smells. During the holiday 
season it is especially important to surround yourself with soothing and 
uplifting smells and sounds. Listen to music that makes you happy and calm even 
if its not holiday music. A great place to start is with one of our Soothe 
collection of aromatherapy products. The combination of lavender, geranium, 
clary sage and chamomile essential oils in this blend help you stay calm and 
grounded, even when things around you are a little chaotic.<br>
<br>
If you 
need a little extra help adjusting your mood try our Inspiration blend with 
it&rsquo;s uplifting mix of citrus essential oils &ndash;sure to put a smile on 
even the most stubborn of scowls. If traditional holiday smells stress you out 
or make you depressed, avoid them as much as possible.</p>

 The Art of Holiday Gift Giving: 5 Unique 
Ways to Share Your Gratitude and Touch Their Hearts <br>
<br>
 Written by Donya 
Fahmy of Dropwise Essentials &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
For many people, giving gifts, 
especially during the holidays, is an obligation rather than a sincere act of 
love, kindness, generosity or gratitude. Doesn&rsquo;t that explain those 
completely random gifts we receive that have little practical or even 
sentimental value?<br>
<br>
We all know the tendencies; some of us use gift 
giving as a way to over-compensate for a perceived lack of self-worth or desire 
to be liked, while others feel the need to keep score. They&rsquo;re the ones 
who make decisions about who to gift based on historical performance (i.e. who 
gave a gift the previous year), or try to level the playing field by giving 
gifts of approximately the same or perceived value as the ones they receive. 
This mental score-keeping is time-consuming, emotionally and mentally 
exhausting, and distracts us from the true intention of gift-giving, which 
truly is acknowledging those we love and care about.<br>
<br>
A gift is an 
important way of expressing how you feel about another person &ndash; 
it&rsquo;s your way of showing them gratitude for having them in your life. And 
while our gift-shopping and gift-giving gyrations don&rsquo;t always reflect 
that, I believe that it&rsquo;s still the driving force behind why most of us 
give gifts.<br>
<br>
Here are 5 quick gift ideas that can support the real 
intention of giving this holiday season.<br>
<br>
Gifts from the Heart<br>
<br>

Gifts from the heart are the most meaningful and can take on many forms: gifts 
of time, love or support (baby-sitting, house-sitting, pet-sitting, tech 
support for the computer-challenged, gardening or decorating advice, cooking 
lessons, house-cleaning). Start by asking your friend or loved one &lsquo;What 
do you need?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What can I help you create?&rsquo; This way you 
can help them do or create something that&rsquo;s authentically important or 
meaningful to them.<br>
<br>
Gifts of Experiences<br>
<br>
Sharing experiences 
with someone you care about can be deeply satisfying and gratifying because it 
builds and strengthens the bond between you. The event itself can be something 
simple like dinner and a movie, going to a concert, a play, or a sporting event 
together, or something more involved like spending a day hiking or exploring in 
nature, a visit to the local museum, volunteering for an event, or even a day 
at the spa. The emphasis should be on togetherness over anything else.<br>
<br>

Handmade Gifts<br>
<br>
Another great way to show someone you care is by using 
your talents to make them a gift or buy them something hand-crafted! Great 
handmade gifts include food, clothing, jewelry, home d&eacute;cor, pet 
accessories, and bath and body items like soaps, candles, lip balms, or lotions 
and potions.<br>
<br>
No time to do it yourself? No problem. Handmade gifts 
have a personal touch even if you don&rsquo;t make them yourself. Try our line 
of handmade, all-natural aromatherapy bath and body products you can combine 
with other items for your own hand made gift baskets or our ready-to-order 
aromatherapy gift sets.<br>
<br>
The Gift of Touch<br>
<br>
The far-reaching 
positive effects of touch are not strictly limited to romantic gestures or even 
therapeutic massage. With the amazing power of touch, you literally have at 
your fingertips a variety of ways to offer gifts of gratitude to those you care 
about. If you have a massage therapist then send them to yours with a gift 
certificate. If not, ask people you know for a referral, contact a local spa or 
offer to give them a massage yourself! Or give the gift of a Mani-Pedi. For the 
Do-It-Yourself types, try our Hand &amp; Foot Care Gift Set. Available in 5 
different aromatherapy blends to choose from.<br>
<br>
The Gift of Giving<br>

<br>Giving the gift of charity can be a wonderful way of showing gratitude 
while helping those in need this holiday season. If you choose to give this 
type of gift make sure it is properly aligned with the recipient&rsquo;s values 
and needs. For example, someone who is not an animal lover may not appreciate a 
donation made in their name to an animal rights organization, while a friend 
who has pets might find it heart-warming and gratifying.<br>
<br>
For gifts to 
charitable causes, consult the Charity Navigator Holiday Giving Guide to help 
you evaluate different charities and aid organizations. Or give the gift of 
economic independence with a micro-loan to a poor entrepreneur through Kiva or 
a gift of hope through Heifer International.<br>

 From Chappy to Happy: Discover the Best Lip Balm Ingredients to 
Keep You Smiling <br>
<br>
 Written by Donya Fahmy of Dropwise Essentials  
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The human body is amazingly resilient. It can take a lot of 
neglect and even a fair amount of abuse before the signs of damage start to 
show. But some parts of the body, like your lips, are a lot more delicate and 
sensitive, showing almost immediate signs of distress. And unlike the rest of 
your skin, which has the ability to hydrate and regulate moisture, your lips 
have no sebaceous glands or lipids (fats) to help them retain moisture.<br>
<br>
What&rsquo;s worse is lips are at the front and center of your visage so when 
they become dry or cracked, not only do they look bad they feel bad too. So 
what can you do to keep your lips soft, supple and happy instead of chappy?<br>

<br>Some causes like overexposure to the elements &ndash;wind, sun, hot or cold 
dry air&ndash; or chronic congestion that forces you to breathe through your 
mouth rather than your nose are often unavoidable. Other causes like frequently 
licking the lips or overuse of petroleum-based lip balms and glosses are easier 
to address.<br>
<br>
happy lipsLike the rest of your skin, your lips need a 
good balance of ingredients that are emollients (softeners) and humectants 
(moisturizers that attract and hold water to the skin). The good news is there 
are a wide variety of emollient ingredients you can use. The bad news is the 
ones found in most lip products are petroleum-based and work via something 
called &ldquo;occlusion&rdquo; which means the act of closing off. They are 
spread onto the skin to slow or prevent moisture evaporation and are made from 
oils and waxes that can&rsquo;t be penetrated by water.<br>
<br>
They coat 
lips, forming a short-term barrier that can provide temporary protection from 
the elements but quickly wear off (or are often licked off) and must be 
constantly re-applied. Because they offer no lasting benefits, they are not the 
best choice for long-term or ongoing lip care.<br>
<br>
Choose Only the Best 
Ingredients for Your Kisser<br>
<br>
At a minimum you should hold your lip balm 
products to the same standard as the moisturizers you use on your skin and 
face, but because lips are more delicate you would do better to hold them to an 
even higher standard. The main things to look for are:<br>
<br>
Base Oils. 
Products made primarily with raw or unprocessed plant-based vegetable or nut 
oils and butters like jojoba, virgin coconut, high-oleic safflower, extra 
virgin olive, sunflower, hemp, avocado, castor (an excellent humectant) and 
shea or cocoa butter &ndash;preferably certified organic. Oils like olive and 
coconut that most closely resemble your skin&rsquo;s natural sebum and are rich 
in Vitamin E and other antioxidants, will work best and deliver consistent 
results.<br>
<br>
Herbal Infusions or Extracts. Products that include 
skin-friendly herbal ingredients like calendula, chamomile, comfrey, chickweed, 
and yarrow provide added protective benefits.<br>
<br>
Natural Waxes. Although 
waxes can act as emollients and protective barriers, their purpose in your lip 
balm is more functional than beneficial &mdash; adding stiffness so it can be 
dispensed in a push-up tube. Choose lip balms made with natural waxes like 
beeswax, candellila, or carnauba wax.<br>
<br>
Essential Oils. Look for 
products that are made with 100% pure essential oils versus 
&ldquo;fragrance&rdquo; and flavor oils, which may contain unidentified, 
potentially harmful ingredients like phthalates or synthetic sweeteners. Too 
much flavor invariably leads to frequent, involuntary, and excessive lip 
licking &ndash;one of the main causes of dry chapped lips. Essential oils will 
open your senses, and though they smell good they won&rsquo;t taste good enough 
to make you lick your lips.<br>
<br>
Remember, when you lick your lips, eat, or 
drink while wearing lipstick or lip products, or kiss someone who is wearing a 
lip product, you ingest some of the product&rsquo;s ingredients. So it goes 
without saying that if you want healthy happy lips avoid products made with 
petroleum or synthetic chemicals and stick to products made with only the best 
natural and organic ingredients. Not only will they make your lips look and 
feel better, you won&rsquo;t have to worry about the consequences of ingesting 
them!<br>
