<h2>  LET US GET YOU TWICE THE RESULTS IN HALF THE TIME </h2>  February 3rd, 
2012 | Author:Tina <br>

<h2>You know the story.&nbsp; You embark on a new fitness routine.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;re pumped up and you&rsquo;re ready to lose that body fat once and 
for all!</h2> 
<p>You make yourself get up an extra hour every day to walk on the treadmill, 
do the elliptical, or ride your bike.&nbsp; You work yourself up to 45 to 50 
minutes and you start to sweat.&nbsp; You may feel better.&nbsp; You may sleep 
better.&nbsp; You may even notice your energy and outlook are 
better.&nbsp;&nbsp; But what about your body fat?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s happening 
(or not happening) there.</p> 
<p>Many of you know that I have been a self confessed Cardio Junkie for nearly 
30 years.&nbsp; As someone who came into this businessduring the 80&prime;s 
(the era of Jane Fonda, leg warmers, thongs and dance aerobics), I fell into 
the trap of believing cardio was the key to my own fat loss, fitness and 
health.&nbsp; I worked out every day, for hours a day, sometimes teaching as 
many as 3-4 aerobic classes per day, and guess what, I was still too fat!&nbsp; 
(The low fat, high carbohydrate diet of the day didn&rsquo;t help much either).
</p> 
<p><strong>The point is, I was working out hours a day doing every kind of 
cardio you can imagine, AND I WAS STILL FAT!&nbsp; I just don&rsquo;t want my 
clients to make the same mistakes I did!&nbsp; The fact is, you can get TWICE 
THE RESULTS in HALF THE TIME by simply changing the way you do cardio!</strong>
</p> 
<p><strong>So what about the formula:&nbsp; Eat less + increase 
activity=weight loss.???</strong></p> 
<p><em>Sorry folks, but it is not true. </em></p> 
<p>In fact, if you follow this&nbsp; myth of weight loss,&nbsp; you will end 
up stranded somewhere, frustrated that you didn&rsquo;t reach your weight loss 
goal.&nbsp; Or, even worse, you may will circle the world of mainstream empty 
weight loss promises and come back to where you started, more overweight than 
when you began.&nbsp; Let put this stubborn concept to rest once and for all.
</p> 
<p><strong>I repeat, Eat Less + Increase Activity DOES NOT EQUAL Weight Loss.
</strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;How is this possible,&rdquo; one might ask? Cardio burns calories 
right? And less calories equals fat loss right? That is where many people are 
mistaken. Yes, consuming less calories than you burn each day will result in
weight lossbut not necessarily fat loss. &ldquo;What is the difference,&rdquo; 
you say? Well, here it is. If you lose weight without regard to the amount of 
fat you have, chances are you will look the same (i.e. love handles, flabby 
thighs and arms that continue to wave long after your hand has finished). You 
will be smaller,yes, (also known as &ldquo;Skinny Fat&rdquo;) , but is that 
really what you want?&nbsp; Probably not. You want to look toned and healthy 
and without visible fat stores that make up a body that looks out of shape.</p> 
<p>So now that we have established the difference between weight loss and fat 
loss, how can we make sure the weight we lose is fat? Besides having the proper 
diet, which is the key to losing fat, we look to exercise to supplement this 
goal. Typically, every client I have ever trained, has come to me prepared to 
do endless hoursof cardio exercise. Most people just can&rsquo;t seem to get it 
through their head that not only don&rsquo;t they have to spend hours on the 
treadmill,<em>but that they shouldn&rsquo;t.</em></p> 
<p>Here is why. When you get on that treadmill, bike, or elliptical trainer, 
your body begins to use energy. This is fantastic. Going faster makes your 
lungs and heart work harder to keep up with the intensity, thereby making them 
stronger and more efficient the more often you do this. That&rsquo;s great too. 
Now, eventually, after all your recently ingested energy is consumed, your body 
will look elsewhere for energy to fuel you.</p> 
<p><strong>Now is the point where it gets tricky. Want your body to use fat 
for fuel? This means going slow-like you&rsquo;re running a Marathon rather 
than running a sprint race.</strong> Most of you have all seen the little 
diagrams on most cardio equipment. Here is your fat burning zone, here is your 
cardio zone. These diagrams are correct. When you get into the cardio heart 
rate zone, your body will eventually become catabolic, which means it will 
start burning muscle for fuel. This is especially true if you don&rsquo;t use 
your muscles (do resistance training, like Pilates) on a regular basis.</p> 
<p>When you go slow and keep your heart rate in the &ldquo;fat burning&rdquo; 
zone, your heart and lungs no longer have to work as hard, so they aren&rsquo;t 
getting stronger anymore. Furthermore, your calorie burn rate drops down to a 
point where you have to stay on that dang machine for two hours to burn off the 
calories equivalent to what you ate for breakfast!</p> 
<p>So, based on this information, most people tend to think that going faster 
will kick that calorie burn up. And as long as we are going faster, lets go 
longer and really amp up that weight loss for faster results.<strong>The only 
problem is-&nbsp; This is how you end up getting fat.</strong></p> 
<p>If you burn muscles as an energy source, you also burn up your potential to 
burn more calories in the future. Muscle requires more energy (FOOD!) to 
sustain itself, so if you are using your muscles as fuel, you are in effect 
lowering your metabolism. Furthermore, the better your heart and lungs 
function, the more effective they become at the fast paced cardio, the less 
calories you will burn over time doing the same amount of cardio. So now you 
end up having to domore cardio to equal the calories burned when you first 
began this exercise routine.</p> 
<p><strong>So where are we now? </strong>We have less muscle and burn less 
calories than we did when we stepped foot in the gym. Now, our weight loss 
progress has all but stopped, so we get discouraged, and quit going to the gym. 
Most will probably give up on their diet to boot.</p> 
<p>And here is where it gets tragic. Since we&rsquo;ve&nbsp; lost muscle mass 
our metabolism is slower. Then we quit eating healthy and go back to the way we 
were eating before. And guess what? Any weight we may have lost comes back and
<em>then some</em> since our calorie burning ability has diminished.&nbsp; Can 
anyone say yo-yo diet?&nbsp;<em><strong>Now the excuse becomes, &ldquo;I tried 
diet and exercise, and it didn&rsquo;t work for me at all!&rdquo;</strong></em>
</p> 
<p>So now that you are completely discouraged and don&rsquo;t know what to do, 
here is the light at the end of the tunnel.</p> 
<p>Losing fat isn&rsquo;t really that difficult if you know what to do. Keep 
that anti-inflammatory Paleo diet, do resistance training (Pilates) a few times 
a week, and if you want to boost your calorie burn,<strong>have a cardio 
routine that works for you instead of against you.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The answer is High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</strong>, and 
it is the only type we ever prescribe for my clients at Pilates 1901. Interval 
cardio is short bursts of high intensity work immediately followed by brief 
periods of rest, for 20 to 30 minutes. No more than that!</p> 
<p>This type of cardio has loads of benefits. Your heart and lungs get the 
required demand put upon them to make them stronger. You don&rsquo;t stay in 
the high cardio range long enough to burn muscle. You exercise your heart rate 
recovery (HRR) which trains your body to be able to recover from intense 
exercise quicker. And the kicker?<strong>Multiple studies have shown this type 
of training is proven to keep your body burning more calories for up to 2-4 
hours after your workout!</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Now is the time to forget the notion that more is better when it 
comes to cardio.</strong> Don&rsquo;t spend hours on the machines and put 
yourself at risk for failure in the battle against fat. Use the HIIT philosophy 
to maximize your time in the gym and not only start seeing results but keep 
seeing them.</p> 
<h3>You&rsquo;re busy!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got things to do!&nbsp; Why would 
you want to waste one minute doing something UNPRODUCTIVE?</h3> 
<h3>At <strong>Pilates 1901</strong> we have seen to it that you have many

<h2>  FIVE NO FAIL THINGS YOU MUST DO TO GET YOUR BODY BACK IN 2012! </h2>  
December 27th, 2011 | Author:admin <br>

<h2>AREN&rsquo;T YOU HIP TO YOUR OWN EXCUSES BY NOW?<br>
</h2> 
<h3>Try doing these FIVE Fabulous things instead to get the body you deserve 
this year!<br>
</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>#1. HOLLA! </strong></h3> 
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t just THINK your goals, SAY THEM LOUD and SAY THEM 
PROUD! Declaring your intentions publicly is the ONLY WAY to GET REAL about 
OWNING YOUR DECISION. If you can&rsquo;t say itoutloud to your friends and your 
family, you won&rsquo;t get past the first hurdle.<br>
</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>#2. GET JIGGY WITH IT</strong>!</h3> 
<p><strong>This means you got to MOVE to make the changes you want for a 
sleek, hard body. We&rsquo;re not saying you have to punish your body- quite 
the contrary! BUT YOU&rsquo;VE GOT TO BURN to TURN your body into a FAT 
TORCHING MACHINE. The Good News? It&rsquo;s not HOW LONG but HOW EFFECTIVE your 
workouts are that matter. &ldquo;LESS&rdquo; can really yeild 
&lsquo;MORE&rdquo; Killer results!<br>
</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>#3. WORD </strong></h3> 
<p><strong>Our most successful clients are the ones who take the time to WRITE 
DOWN what they are EATING AND DRINKING every day! This simple exercise in 
accountability makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE in ATTITUDE and ACTION. By being 
MINDFUL of what is going into your body, you are GAINING POWER over all the 
little daily decisions that add up to HUGE RESULTS! Repeat after me: Keeping a 
food journal is NOT OPTIONAL!</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>#4. CHILL</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>A THIN body is a BODY IN BALANCE. You can&rsquo;t expect to lose 
weight if your hormones are raging from stress, low blood sugar and lack of 
sleep. Self care requires a moment between stimulus and response. You MUST have 
that moment to MAKE GOOD CHOICES. So the next time you think you don&rsquo;t 
have time to cook, drive past the drive thru and into the grocery salad bar 
instead. The next time you think you have to stay up late to get it ALL DONE, 
remember that your lack of sleep undermines your resistance and ability to burn 
fat. Remember the next time you think you&rsquo;ll save a few extra calories by 
SKIPPING BREAKFAST, you&rsquo;re really just sabotaging yourself and setting 
yourself up for irresistible cravings later in the day. Best advice? BREATHE. 
AND EAT.</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>#5. HOMEY&rsquo;S</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>There&rsquo;s nothing like community and shared experience to help 
you reach your goals. That&rsquo;s why you must declare your intentions 
publicly and then enlist the support of your friends and loved ones. Expanding 
that &ldquo;family&rdquo; to include your friends at work or your workout 
facility is not only a nice idea, but an essential one. Any goal worth 
achieving is worth investing in and that means GOING BEYOND the statement into 
ACTION. There is strength in community. There is power in accountability. 
Enlist that help wherever you can find it and expect GREAT RETURNS. At 
Pilates1901 we know it works. We do it every day!</strong></p>

<h2>  TOP 10 NUTRITION MISTAKES THAT ARE KEEPING YOU FAT </h2>  January 18th, 
2011 | Author:admin <br>

<h2><strong>Are you one of the millions of people who have spent countless 
amounts of money and a ridiculous amount of time on a diet or exercise program 
that proved absolutely no results?</strong></h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Are you wondering what you are doing wrong or how you will ever be 
able to lose the weight you have been desperately trying to lose for so long?
</strong></p> 
<p>You and millions of other people are completely confused about what 
constitutes good nutrition and what is really &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. Not only are 
they overwhelmed and frustrated with all the conflicting information on the 
market today, they (and probably you) just don&rsquo;t know where to begin.</p> 
<p><strong>The following ten mistakes </strong><strong>from nutrition expert 
Isabele De Los Rios</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>are preventing 
millions of people from finally enjoying the body they&rsquo;re dreaming 
of.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of these do you think is holding you back?</strong></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>1. Dying a Sweet Death</strong></h3> 
<p>It is no longer a secret or even a shock to most people that refined sugar 
causes weight gain and is one of the leading causes of obesity in the world. 
Sugar is also extremely addictive (causing feeling of highs and lows in the 
body similar to most drugs). And the negative side effects are just as bad as 
drugs, if not worse. Americans, truly, don&rsquo;t realize how much sugar they 
are consuming in one day. Most soft drinks, juices and even some 
&ldquo;health&rdquo; drinks have anywhere between 5-10 teaspoons of sugar in 
each 8 oz serving. Can you imagine putting 8 oz of water in a cup and then 
adding 10 teaspoons of white sugar and then drinking it? Well this is exactly 
what you are doing when you drink any kind of soft drink, juice and most other 
drinks on the market today.</p> 
<p>And its not just drinks that are loaded with sugar. Most cereals and 
packaged foods have sugar (or some form of sugar) listed as the first or second 
ingredient (which means it is the ingredient in the highest quantity).</p> 
<p>The following words on a nutritional label mean &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; and 
should probably be avoided:&nbsp; Corn Sweetener, Corn syrup, or corn syrup 
solids, Dehydrated Cane Juice, Dextrin, Dextrose, Fructose, Fruit Juice 
Concentrate, Glucose, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Honey, Lactose, Maltodextrin, 
Malt syrup, Maltose, Maple syrup, Molasses, Raw sugar, Rice Syrup, Saccharose, 
Sucrose, Syrup, Treacle, Turbinado Sugar, Xylose</p> 
<p>Fortunately for those looking for a lean, defined body, once you stop 
eating sugar, your addiction will quickly disappear. People who are 
&ldquo;on&rdquo; sugar crave it all the time. People who are &ldquo;off&rdquo; 
sugar, don&rsquo;t even miss it.</p> 
<p>Weaning yourself off sugar and sugar containing products will cause a 
drastic and immediate change in your weight. The first few days may be a bit of 
a &ldquo;detox&rdquo; (just like a drug) but these symptoms quickly disappear 
(and so do the pounds!)</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>2. Toxins in a little blue, pink and yellow packet</strong></h3> 
<p>Many times when people decide to give up sugar, they quickly resort to 
artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners are definitelynot the answer! 
Sorbitol, saccharin, aspartame and sucrolose are actually worse for you than 
sugar itself. All of these artificial sweeteners have been linked to cancer, 
tumors, and obesity. Yes, artificial sweeteners cause weight gain by disrupting 
your body&rsquo;s natural hormones. Studies have shown that when people give up 
their daily &ldquo;Diet Drink&rdquo; (filled withaspartame) they quickly lose 
up to 10 pounds just by eliminating the consumption of this toxic sweetener.</p>
<p>So it is equally as important to eliminate any food that contains the above 
mentioned sweeteners as it is to eliminate sugar from</p> 
<p>your daily intake. Most people&rsquo;s next question is then, &ldquo;Well 
what is left if I wanta little something sweet?&rdquo; A great alternative to 
sugar and</p> 
<p>artificial sweeteners is the supplement STEVIA. Stevia is a naturally sweet 
plant native to Paraguay that is 30 times sweeter than sugar in its unprocessed 
form. With hundreds of studies showing Stevia is a safe alternative, it&rsquo;s 
the next big thing. No wonder. It&rsquo;s all-natural, contains zero calories, 
and has a zero glycemic index. Stevia leaves are 250-400 times sweeter than 
sugar and perfect for helping anyone wean themselves away of refined white 
sugar and artificial sweeteners. Stevia products are great for beverages, soft 
foods, and baking. Stevia products are available in most local natural foods 
and healthfood stores. In grocery stores, Stevia products are typically found 
in the health food aisle with other supplements.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>3. Laboratory Experiments should</strong> not be considered 
&ldquo;Food&rdquo;</h3> 
<p>Have you noticed how much fatter Americans have gotten since more 
&ldquo;weight loss&rdquo; and &ldquo;diet&rdquo; foods have been put out on the 
market?</p> 
<p>Well, I assure you it&rsquo;s no coincidence. Processed Foods can truly be 
considered &ldquo;Non Foods&rdquo; since they resemble more of a science 
experiment than they do real food. To make differentiating between healthy 
natural food vs. non foods, just stay away from anything that contains 
ingredients on a labelthat you can&rsquo;t pronounce. If the ingredients list 
to your favorite cereal is more complicated than your college organic chemistry 
final, chances are you should stay away from it at all costs. These chemicals 
are all toxins to your body (just as artificial sweeteners are) and your liver 
becomes extremely overwhelmed trying to rid your body of these harmful toxins.
</p> 
<p>Why is this important in your efforts tolose fat? Well, the other job of 
your liver is to burn body fat and if it is too busy ridding youof toxic 
overload, it has no time (or energy) to get rid of your unwanted fat.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>4. Carbohydrates falsely accused</strong></h3> 
<p>There was a brief moment in time when I thought Dr. Robert Atkins was going 
to beelected president. Swarms of people were flocking to his weight loss 
program as the next big revolution in weight loss. Yes, some of these people 
did lose weight but they also were fatigued, extremely constipated and theyall 
had the kind of bad breath that no amount of Altoids could conquer. Why? 
Because they were allowing their bodies to enter a state of 
&ldquo;ketosis&rdquo; which does cause people to lose weight but also quickly 
lands them in the hospital. Does this sound like the kind of long term health 
plan you should be following?</p> 
<p>I do agree that reducing the amount of carbohydrates in your meal plan will 
help you loseweight and lean down. But you must reduce the bad and increase the 
good. Eating fibrous carbohydrates like fruits and vegetables actually turns 
your body into a fat burning machine. Eating starchy carbs like rice and 
potatoes after a workout will also help you develop the lean, muscular physique 
most men and women are looking for. It is the processed and refined wheat and 
grains that are causingeveryone to blow up like balloons.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall into the &ldquo;no carb&rdquo; trap. Learn the right carb 
approach to look great and feel great at the same time.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>5. Training for Sumo Wrestling</strong></h3> 
<p>Sumo wrestlers make a concerted effort to get fat for their sport. So if 
your number one goal was to GET FAT this is exactly what you could do:</p> 
<p><em><strong>1. Skip breakfast and eat very little all day long</strong></em>
</p> 
<p><em><strong>2. Eat the bulk of your caloric intake in a</strong></em></p> 
<p><em><strong>large heavy meal, filled with complex carbohydrates in the 
evening</strong></em></p> 
<p><em><strong>3. Go to bed after eating this heavy meal.</strong></em></p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s it. This strategy has been working for sumo wrestlers for 
years. And you know who else it is working for? The 130 million Americans who 
are overweight or obese. You must develop the habit of eating frequent meals 
all day long to develop the kind of warp speed metabolism that is going to 
allow you to get lean and stay lean (no sense in getting there without being 
able to maintain it right?) Eat 5-7 well portioned meals each day and you will 
see your body burn fat faster than you can say &ldquo;sumo wrestler.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>6. Shriveling up like a prune</strong></h3> 
<p>If you often feel like you are starving all day no matter how much food 
you&rsquo;ve consumed, chances are you may be severely dehydrated. Many people 
actually mistake hunger for dehydration and eat tons more calories than they 
actually need when all they really needed to do was drink some water!</p> 
<p>It would be impossible to pick up any diet or weight loss book without it 
saying somewhere &ldquo;drink 8-10 cups of water each day.&rdquo; Even if all 
health and nutrition ngurus don&rsquo;t agree on all the same principles, they 
do all agree on one: water is the magic potion to ensure weight loss. When you 
consider that water helps the body metabolize stored fat, rid the body of waste 
(as in unwanted fat and toxins), and is a natural diuretic and a natural 
laxative, no wonder it is an absolute MUST when fat loss is your goal. Drink a 
minimum of &frac12; of your bodyweight in ounces of filtered water each day to 
ensure that your body rids itself of the unwanted fat youare aiming to lose.</p>
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>7. Being scammed by &ldquo;Health Food&rdquo;</strong></h3> 
<p>Yes, you have been scammed. You and approximately hundreds of thousands of 
other people who have purchased pre-packaged&ldquo;health&rdquo; foods. There 
are many health foods on the market today that are causing people to gain 
weight, as well as making it near impossiblefor them to lose weight. Have you 
ever purchased the foods that someone claimed to be &ldquo;guaranteed to make 
you lose weight&rdquo; only to see the scale go up instead of down? Frustrated 
dieters all over the world can&rsquo;t figureout why their new weight loss 
shake is not working like the commercial suggested. Well, one of the nasty 
culprits causing millions ofpeople to pack on the pounds is hydrogenated oil. 
There are thousands health foods that contain this toxic oil. Weight Watchers 
and Lean Cuisine meals and bars almost all contain hydrogenated oil. (And they 
are supposed to be good for you?) Even some energy sports bars and shakes are 
loaded up with hydrogenated oils and many other toxic preservatives.</p> 
<p>Another nasty culprit is processed soy. This is always a shock to most 
people (especially die hard vegetarians) who have been falsely led to believe 
that soy is actually good for you. Well if you lived in Asia you would quickly 
see that most Asians eat soy in small quantities and in the form of old 
fashioned fermented soy (such as miso, tempeh, natto, shoyu and tamari) not the 
processed, toxic soy that is used in so many vegetarian type products and 
weight loss products on the market today. The worst of today&rsquo;s soy 
protein products are soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, texturized 
vegetable protein and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. These ingredients are found 
in everything from shake powders, energy bars and veggie burgers to canned 
tuna. The worst soy oil products are margarines and shortenings made from 
partially hydrogenated soybean oil containing dangerous trans fatty acids. So 
avoid these forms of toxic soy at all costs. Not only will you be saving 
yourself from a myriad of health problems (like decreased thyroid function and 
hormone disruption) you will also see a dramatic loss in unwanted body fat.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>8. Avoiding Fat like the plague</strong></h3> 
<p>While some thought Atkins was the best thing since sliced bread, others 
thought that fat was the root of all evil. This is only partially true and the 
complete elimination of all fats from your diet is a BIG mistake. Yes, you 
should eliminate unhealthy fats like hydrogenated oils (sorry, that means no 
French fries or doughnuts). But the healthy fats found in wild fish and nuts 
are absolutely necessary for your body to function at optimum. These 
fats,called Omega 3 essential fatty acids, are actually so critical to your 
body&rsquo;s functioning, that it is very difficult to experience any weight 
loss without including them in your meal plan.</p> 
<p>Where do you find these Omega 3&rsquo;s? You find them in salmon, walnuts, 
flax seeds and organic eggs. Make these foods an integral part of your eating 
regimen and you will see some great results in your weight loss efforts. A high 
quality Omega 3 supplement also works wonders for your body and helps to burn 
off unwanted fat. Take a few capsules with each meal to ensure you are getting 
your Omega 3&rsquo;s daily.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>9. Ignoring your muscles needs for fuel</strong></h3> 
<p>Protein is not just for bodybuilders. It&rsquo;s for every person who wants 
to achieve a lean, slender and toned physique (Did I just describe every person 
on the planet?) Protein not only fuels your muscles, it also helps stabilize 
your blood sugar and prevent hunger. So you get thebenefit of lean, toned 
muscles and a way to NOT be hungry. Sounds like a win, win to me.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, most people go the entire day without eating any protein at 
all. It&rsquo;s no wonder these are the same people that complain of a flabby 
body, fatigue, and hunger pangs that just won&rsquo;t go away. Include a source 
of healthy protein into each meal (that includes snacks). Wonderful sources of 
protein are grass fed meats, free range poultry, organic eggs, wild fish, and 
organic raw nuts.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3><strong>10. Believing that dieting is the only way to lose weight</strong>
</h3> 
<p>If you still think that going on the next crash diet is the only way to 
lose weight than I have some bad news for you: You have a long life of Yo-Yo 
dieting ahead of you. The only way to reach your ideal weight and stay there is 
to develop a healthy way of eating that you enjoy and that you can maintain 
(key word is Maintain!)</p> 
<p>No unrealistic and unhealthy diet scheme is ever going to get you looking 
and feeling the way you have been wanting to look and feel for so long. So, if 
a long life with a lean, healthy and vibrant body is what you are looking for, 
commit yourself right now to learning exactly how this is possible for you for 
the long term.</p>

<h2>  WHAT TO EAT TODAY FOR FLATTER ABS TOMORROW! </h2>  January 13th, 2011 | 
Author:admin <br>

<h2>Tired of that tube around your midsection?&nbsp; <br>
You CAN get rid of 
it.</h2> 
<p>This *post, from<strong> KC&rsquo;s Best Fat Loss Program, the Pilates Fat 
Loss Formula</strong>, details the top 8 foods to eat to gid rid of that pooch!
</p> 
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t just read this!&nbsp; Heed this! </strong></p> 
<p>And don&rsquo;t miss our <strong>FREE METABOLISM 101 WORKHOP on Saturday, 
Jan 22nd at 1pm</strong>. Come and learn how you, like so many other women, can 
banish that fat forever and regain your youthful appearance!</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>IN THE MEANTIME.&nbsp; EAT THESE FOODS!</strong></p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Yogurt</strong></p> 
<p>People who get their calcium from yogurt rather than from other sources may 
lose more weight around their midsection, according to a recent study published 
in the International Journal of Obesity. The probiotic bacteria in most yogurts 
help keep your digestive system healthy, which translates into a lower 
incidence of gas, bloating, and constipation, which can keep your tummy looking 
flat.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for:</strong> One to three cups a day of low-fat or fat-free 
yogurt. Choose unsweetened yogurt that contains live active cultures. Add a 
handful of fresh chopped fruit for flavor and extra fiber.&nbsp; We love Fage 
Greek Yogurt!&nbsp; Low fat- high in protein!&nbsp; Yummy!</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Eggs</strong></p> 
<p>You won&rsquo;t find a more perfect protein source. Eggs are highly 
respected by dietitians because of their balance of essential amino acids 
(protein building blocks used by your body to manufacture everything from 
muscle fibers to brain chemicals). We like them because they keep our hands out 
of the cookie jar. Researchers at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center 
found that when people ate eggs in the morning, they felt less hungry 
throughout the day than when breakfast consisted of complex carbohydrates like 
bagels. The protein and fat in the egg may be contributing to the feeling of 
satiety.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for:</strong> One egg a day, unless you have high blood 
cholesterol, in which case you should check with your doctor first. (One egg 
packs about 213 milligrams of cholesterol.)</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Berries</strong></p> 
<p>Most are loaded with fiber, every dieter&rsquo;s best friend. The more 
fiber you eat &mdash; experts say that it&rsquo;s best to get between 25 and 35 
grams every day &mdash; the fewer calories you absorb from all the other stuff 
you put in your mouth. That&rsquo;s because fiber traps food particles and 
shuttles them out of your system before they&rsquo;re fully digested. Berries 
(and other fruits) are also high in antioxidants, which not only help protect 
you from chronic diseases like cancer but may also help you get more results 
from your workouts.&nbsp; Antioxidants help improve blood flow, which can help 
muscles contract more efficiently.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for:</strong> At least half a cup daily, or about 30 
calories&rsquo; worth. Don&rsquo;t limit yourself to the usual suspects, like 
raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries. If you can find them, add 
boysenberries, gooseberries, and black currants to the mix for excitement.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Almonds</strong></p> 
<p>These delicious and versatile nuts contain filling protein and fiber, not 
to mention vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant. They&rsquo;re also a good source 
of magnesium, a mineral your body must have in order to produce energy, build 
and maintain muscle tissue, and regulate blood sugar. &ldquo;A stable 
blood-sugar level helps prevent cravings that can lead to overeating and weight 
gain,&rdquo; says David Katz, MD, a professor at the Yale University School of 
Medicine. But what makes almonds most interesting is their ability to block 
calories. Research indicates that the composition of their cell walls may help 
reduce the absorption of all of their fat, making them an extra-lean nut.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for:</strong> An ounce a day (about 23 almonds), with 
approximately 160 calories. An empty Altoids tin will hold your daily dose 
perfectly.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Apples</strong></p> 
<p>A 2003 study in the journal <em>Nutrition</em> found that overweight women 
who consumed three apples or pears a day for three months lost more weight than 
their counterparts who were fed a similar diet with oat cookies instead of 
fruits. &ldquo;A large apple has 5 grams of fiber, but it&rsquo;s also nearly 
85 percent water, which helps you feel full,&rdquo; explains Elisa Zied, RD, 
author of<em>So What Can I Eat?!</em> (Wiley, 2006). Apples also contain 
quercetin, a compound shown to help fight certain cancers, reduce cholesterol 
damage, and promote healthy lungs.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for:</strong> An apple (or two) a day. A study published in 
the<em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</em> found that the Red 
Delicious, Cortland, and Northern Spy varieties had the highest antioxidant 
activity.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Salmon</strong></p> 
<p>Seafood, especially fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel, is an 
excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids. These uber-healthy fats may help 
promote fat burning by making your metabolism more efficient, according to 
Kleiner. An Australian study showed that overweight people who ate fish daily 
improved their glucose-insulin response. Translated, this means that seafood 
may help slow digestion and prevent cravings. If that doesn&rsquo;t hook you, 
consider this: Seafood is an excellent source of ab-friendly protein.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for:</strong> Two four-ounce servings per week. Wild salmon, 
though pricey, contains more omega-3 fatty acids than farm-raised. (If it 
doesn&rsquo;t say wild, it&rsquo;s farm-raised.) If seafood&rsquo;s not your 
thing, you can get your omega-3&prime;s from flaxseed (grind and sprinkle on 
your cereal) or walnuts.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Leafy Greens</strong></p> 
<p>Their cancer-preventing carotenoids won&rsquo;t help shrink your waistline, 
but their low calorie count definitely will. One cup of spinach contains only 
about 40 calories, while a cup of broccoli has 55 calories and satisfies 20 
percent of your day&rsquo;s fiber requirement. Most leafy greens are also a 
good source of calcium, an essential ingredient for muscle contraction. In 
other words, they help fuel your workouts.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for</strong>: Three servings daily. Keep a bag of prewashed 
baby spinach in your fridge and toss a handful into soups, salads, pasta 
dishes, stir-fries, and sandwiches. When you get sick of spinach, reach for a 
bunch of arugula, broccoli rabe, or broccolini, a cross between broccoli and 
Chinese kale.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Quinoa</strong></p> 
<p>Never heard of it? Pronounced KEEN-wah, this whole grain contains 5 grams 
of fiber and 11 grams of protein per half cup. Cook it as you would any other 
grain (although some brands require rinsing). Quinoa&rsquo;s nutty flavor and 
crunchy-yet-chewy texture are like a cross between whole wheat couscous and 
short-grain brown rice.</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for:</strong> At least one half-cup serving (a third of your 
whole-grain requirements) per day. Try substituting AltiPlano Gold brand 
instant quinoa hot cereal (160 to 210 calories per packet), in Chai Almond and 
Spiced Apple Raisin, for oatmeal. Look for it in health-food stores.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Veggie Soup</strong></p> 
<p>Researchers at Pennsylvania State University found that people who ate 
broth-based (or low-fat cream-based) soups two times a day were more successful 
in losing weight than those who ate the same amount of calories in snack food. 
Soup eaters also maintained, on average, a total weight loss of 16 pounds after 
one year. &ldquo;Plus, it&rsquo;s a simple way to get your vegetables,&rdquo; 
says Susan Kleiner, PhD, RD, author of Power Eating (Human Kinetics, 2001).</p> 
<p><strong>Shoot for: </strong>At least one cup of low-calorie, low-sodium 
vegetable soup every day!</p>

<h2>  HELP FOR HANGOVERS&hellip; AVOID THE CALORIES AND THE MISERY </h2>  
December 29th, 2010 | Author:admin <br>

<h2>HELP TO PREVENT AND CURE YOUR HOLIDAY HANGOVER&hellip;</h2> 
<p><strong>#1.&nbsp; Fuel First</strong><br>
 A liquid dinner is a bad plan; 
eat before you go out. ( I like a combo of healthy carbs, proteins and fats, 
like a sliced steak salad or peanut butter and apple.) To digest food, your 
body closes the valve into the small intestine, where alcohol is most quickly 
absorbed, so you&rsquo;re less likely to get buzzed.</p> 
<p><strong>#2.&nbsp; Steer Clear</strong><br>
 Opt for pale spirits (vodka, 
white wine, gin) over red wine, bourbon and whiskey. Darker booze contains more 
congeners, chemicals that up inflammation in the body, intensifying your 
hangover.</p> 
<p><strong>#3.&nbsp; Master Mixing</strong><br>
 Diet soda empties out of your 
stomach more quickly than regular, so you&rsquo;ll get woozy faster if you use 
it. Avoid energy drinks as mixers, too. The caffeine makes you feel less tipsy 
than you are, so you may not realize when you&rsquo;ve hit your limit.</p> 
<p><strong>#4.&nbsp; Clean Up</strong><br>
 When brushing your teeth, wash 
your hands and face, too. Alcohol suppresses the T cells the body needs to 
defend itself, leaving you vulnerable to germs at the bar, exacerbating 
hangover symptoms.</p> 
<p><strong>#5.&nbsp; Have H2O</strong><br>
 Gulp a glass or two of water. 
Dehydration (a side effect of alcohol, a diuretic) reduces the liquid around 
blood cells, making your brain shrivel and leading to headaches, dizziness and 
nausea.</p> 
<p><strong>#6.&nbsp; Nix the Alarm </strong><br>
 You may crash hard, but your 
quality of shut-eye will be less than dreamy. Alcohol disrupts brain chemicals 
that regulate sleep, so you&rsquo;ll spend less time in restorative sleep and 
more in light sleep.&nbsp; Sleep late and you just might bypass any post-party 
pain.</p> 
<p><strong>#7.&nbsp; Start Cracking </strong><br>
 &ldquo;Eggs are my go-to 
hangover cure. They contain cysteine, a substance that breaks down 
acetaldehyde, a hangover-causing toxin in alcohol.&nbsp; Other good choices: 
broth and bananas, which restore the sodium and potassium, respectively, you 
lost during the night&rsquo;s frequent bathroom trips.</p> 
<p><strong>#8. Sip Wisely </strong><br>
 Brew peppermint tea with honey or 
pour a glass of 100 percent fruit juice. Mint soothes your stomach, and honey 
and fructose (fruit sugar) help the body metabolize alcohol faster. But skip 
the hair of the dog&mdash;it only delays your misery.</p> 
<p><strong>#9.&nbsp; Kill the Pain</strong><br>
 Pick ibuprofen. It inhibits 
prostaglandin, a pain messenger linked to increased hangover severity. Avoid 
aspirin, which can irritate your stomach, and ditto acetaminophen: It has to be 
metabolized by your liver, which is already working overtime from the alcohol.
</p> 
<p><strong># 10.&nbsp; Hit the Gym</strong><br>
 You can&rsquo;t flush out 
alcohol with exercise, but some people find that a workout makes them feel 
better, probably due to the feel-good chemicals physical activity 
releases.&nbsp; Try a moderate combo of cardio and core work!</p> 
<p><strong><em>And to make sure your skin isn&rsquo;t looking too 
hungover&hellip; try these great tips!</em></strong></p> 
<p><br>
<strong>#1.&nbsp; Hydrate</strong>: First things first &ndash; drink 
water! Drinking alcohol dehydrates your body, causing your skin to lose its 
firmness and dewy appearance. It also causes blood flow to be directed away 
from your skin and to your vital organs, so your skin has poorer circulation. 
All of these result in that dry, dullness you see in the mirror. So, load up on 
that H2O!</p> 
<p><strong>#2.&nbsp; Reduce puffy eyes</strong>: While good old tea bags will 
do the trick, cold spoons will give you that<em>aaah </em>feeling. Place two 
spoons in your freezer for about ten minutes, then hold the back of them your 
eyes for about five minutes. You&rsquo;ll see the puffyness decrease and look 
more awake.</p> 
<p><strong>#3.&nbsp; Perk up your skin: </strong>After you wash your face, 
lock in some moisture &ndash; Try any of Dermadoctor&rsquo;s KP Duty. It gets 
rid of dryness and flakyness and&nbsp;repairs and heals your dry skin.&nbsp; 
CeRave is another product Dr Kunin recommends for winter skin.</p> 
<p> <strong>#4.&nbsp; Makeup</strong>: Layer on mascara and line your upper 
lids to draw attention away from redness in the whites of your eyes. A touch of 
highlighter on the inner corners of your eye will make them look brighter. 
Sweep a highlighter or a shimmery bronzer over your cheekbones and along your 
T-zone to give your skin a subtle glow.&nbsp;&nbsp; A bold creamy lip color 
will not only distract from tired eyes and dullness, it will add some dewyness 
to your look.</p> 
<p>Of course you can save face, save calories and save all the misery by just 
practicing a little moderation&hellip; BUT just in case&hellip;.</p>

<h2>  How to get motivated again: 5 steps to avoid All or Nothing thinking! 
</h2>  December 28th, 2010 | Author: admin <br>

<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> <strong>All or nothing thinking can negatively 
affect your weight-loss efforts in ways you don&rsquo;t even realize.</strong> 
For some, the idea of either doing things to &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; or not at 
all may even keep them from losing weight altogether. This article by Jennifer 
Scott will help you understand the connection between weight-loss difficulties 
and this mind frame and provide steps on how to lose weight and avoid all or 
nothing thinking. 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Step One: Get a Life (Change)!</h3> 
<p> The first way to avoid all or nothing thinking is to shake the idea that 
losing weight is something you do &ldquo;right&rdquo; just temporarily and then 
the work is done. The fact is, most people who successfully lose weight &mdash; 
and more importantly,<em>keep</em> that weight off &mdash; make healthy, 
permanent lifestyle changes such as getting regular exercise, consciously 
practicing portion control and finding ways to prevent emotional eating.</p> 
<p>If you look at your weight-loss efforts as something you&rsquo;re only 
doing &ldquo;for now,&rdquo; those new, healthy changes won&rsquo;t be 
permanent. But if you try to do too much too soon, the changes will last only 
days. Small, gradual changes are what will work. And seeing the big picture 
&mdash; that little slip-ups don&rsquo;t count, but long-term changes do 
&mdash; helps keep things in perspective.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Step Two: Give In Now and Then</h3> 
<p> Severely limiting your food intake or completely cutting out your favorite 
foods sets you up for a binge. That ever-present sense of deprivation not only 
makes overeating a risk, it also makes life downright miserable. Temptation 
becomes much less powerful when you know it is fleeting and can be quelled with 
less than you think. So, allow yourself a small portion of something 
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; that you really love now and again instead of telling 
yourself it&rsquo;s off-limits for good. While this can be daunting at first, 
you will become accustomed to satisfying your craving with a small treat and 
you&rsquo;ll learn when to say &ldquo;when&rdquo; and in turn feel more 
confident in your weight-loss efforts.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Step Three: Stop Saying the &ldquo;D Word&rdquo;</h3> 
<p> D for diet, that is. Following a strict diet naturally lends itself to 
giving in to all or nothing thinking: You&rsquo;re either &ldquo;on your 
diet&rdquo; or you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;blown your diet&rdquo; and if you&rsquo;ve 
done the latter &hellip; well, you might as well quit altogether and eat 
whatever you want, right? That kind of &ldquo;black and white&rdquo; thinking 
can make your weight-loss efforts much more difficult and may even prevent you 
from losing weight at all.</p> 
<p>Few of us can stick to a diet plan that restricts entire food groups or 
relies on one type of food &mdash; such as freeze-dried, pre-prepared meals 
&mdash; as its mainstay. (Honestly, how long do you<em>really</em> think you 
will be able to eat those for each meal?) Believe me, I&rsquo;ve been there: Go 
on a diet that requires you to eat foods you don&rsquo;t like and you will 
eventually<em>dread</em> every meal. Find the middle ground: Somewhere between 
following that overly-strict diet and eating everything you want, there is a 
point at which you can be both happy<em>and</em> healthy.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Step Four: Forgive Yourself</h3> 
<p> So, you decided to follow that &ldquo;give in&rdquo; step last night and 
allow yourself a cookie. But before bed you enjoyed a few more. And then this 
morning &hellip; you polished off the package for breakfast. Does that mean 
it&rsquo;s time to go off the rails the rest of the day just because you blew 
it this morning? No way!</p> 
<p>Not allowing yourself to make mistakes is the worst mistake you can make. 
Here&rsquo;s some food for thought: All or nothing thinking is a way to let 
yourself off the hook. Subconsciously you think: &ldquo;Oh, now I&rsquo;ve 
screwed up. Glad I don&rsquo;t have to bother anymore!&rdquo; &hellip; for some 
of us, quitting something just because we didn&rsquo;t do it perfectly is an 
easy escape route.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s an old saying: &ldquo;No matter how far you&rsquo;ve gone 
down the wrong path, it&rsquo;s never too late to turn back.&rdquo; and that is 
true in<em>every</em> aspect of life. So don&rsquo;t think just because you 
made less-than-ideal choices today, you can&rsquo;t start over tomorrow. It 
sounds trite, but every day truly is a new beginning. You can&rsquo;t erase 
last night&rsquo;s binge, but you<em>can</em> aim for a much healthier today!
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Step 5: Celebrate Small Victories</h3> 
<p>Reward yourself for the small challenges you surmount. Acknowledging your 
achievements &mdash; no matter how insignificant they seem &mdash; with 
non-food rewards will help you stay motivated throughout your weight-loss 
journey. Yes, brown bagging a healthy lunch four days in a row instead of 
getting fast food is a victory. Doing an exercise video a just twice this week 
is a triumph if you didn&rsquo;t do it at all last week. Rewards don&rsquo;t 
have to cost a dime &mdash; they can be as simple as allowing yourself time to 
read a chapter of a favorite author or enjoying a long bath.</p> 
<p><strong>Take it easy on yourself as you learn how to be a new, improved, 
healthier you. After all, you&rsquo;re only human &hellip; a soon-to-be much<em>
lighter</em> human!</strong></p>

Sooner!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s never been a better time to lose that unwanted

<h2>  So called &ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; Holiday Calorie Bombs to Avoid&hellip;. 
</h2>  December 22nd, 2010 | Author: admin <br>

<h2><em>&hellip; And what to eat instead&hellip;</em><br>
</h2> 
<p> The holidays are here and with them come a multitude of parties&mdash;some 
that we&rsquo;re psyched about, some that we&rsquo;re obligated to attend. All 
of them, no doubt, will have a buffet table packed with delicious holiday 
treats: mini quiches, Swedish meatballs, the dozens of clever ways people 
devise to stuff cream cheese into pastry puffs, elaborate chocolate confections 
and spiced buttery baked goods.&nbsp;<br>
</p> 
<p> Your tactic for avoiding temptation may be to steer clear of all the 
special treats and divert yourself with only healthy foods. Great in theory, 
but not so perfect in practice. Lots of foods that are packed with 
antioxidants, vitamins and minerals are also full of calories. And when 
you&rsquo;re mindlessly munching as you&rsquo;re mingling, those calories can 
add up fast!&nbsp; Check out this post from Eating Well Magazine, because 
knowledge is power!</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume that just because something is healthy it is also 
low-cal. If you like the healthy treats that sometimes show up at holiday 
parties, that&rsquo;s great! Have them&mdash;in moderation. If you&rsquo;d 
rather sample some of the special seasonal treats, just put two or three of the 
most delicious-looking hors d&rsquo;oeuvres on your plate and enjoy.</p> 
<p> So before you head out to party, check out these surprisingly unhealthy 
holiday calorie bombs and better bets to choose instead.</p> 
<p><strong> Surprising Calorie Bomb: Mixed nuts. <br>
</strong>Yes, nuts of 
all kinds are full of heart-healthy fats and the various types provide good 
amounts of other nutrients too (e.g., calcium, folate, selenium, vitamin E). 
But grab a couple of small handfuls and you&rsquo;re easily getting a half 
cup&mdash;nearly 450 calories and 40 grams of fat!</p> 
<p><strong>Better bet:</strong> Go ahead and have one small serving of a 
spiced-nut mix that feels more like a treat.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Surprising Calorie Bomb: Veggies with ranch dressing.</strong><br>
 
Hanging near the crudit&eacute; tray is a great way to keep calories in 
check&mdash;so long as you stay away from the ranch (or blue cheese) dressing, 
which delivers a devastating 150 calories and 16 grams of fat per two 
tablespoons. Yes, I said two tablespoons.</p> 
<p><strong>Better bet:</strong> If you&rsquo;re just eating to eat (not that I 
advocate that&hellip; but it happens), go for the vegetables, unadorned. Or put 
a small scoop of hummus on your plate. It has a more reasonable 50 calories and 
3 grams of fat.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Surprising Calorie Bomb: Cheese and crackers.</strong><br>
 On any 
ordinary day, you&rsquo;d know that cheese is a high-fat, high-cal 
choice&mdash;but when those simple little cubes are sitting there amid all the 
holiday treats, they start to look like a good choice. Beware: If you grab five 
of those little 1-inch cubes, you&rsquo;ve just housed 345 calories. Add a 
small handful of crackers to that and you&rsquo;re easily at 500 calories.</p> 
<p><strong>Better bet: </strong>If you truly want cheese and crackers, limit 
yourself to a few&mdash;say five crackers (about 80 calories) and top each with 
a very thin layer of a cheese spread (think: goat cheese or even cheese ball).
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Surprising Calorie Bomb: Spiced cider.</strong><br>
 It&rsquo;s an 
office party and you&rsquo;re staying away from the spiked punch for various 
reasons. But if you&rsquo;re trying to be festive with a couple cups of spiced 
cider (240 calories), you&rsquo;re doing just as much damage as you would if 
you were having a glass of wine&mdash;from a calorie perspective anyway.</p> 
<p><strong>Better bet:</strong> Stick to 1 cup of cider, then switch to 
seltzer with lime.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Have a Happy Holiday everyone and watch out for those calorie 
bombs!&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be closed Friday and Saturday, Dec 24th and 25th for

<h2>  10 WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS FITS FOR THE HOLIDAYS! </h2>
 December 16th, 2010 | Author:admin <br>

<p>We all&nbsp; have a not-so-forgiving little black dress to get into for New 
Year&rsquo;s Eve. And in between now and then we have to survive a myriad of 
Holiday parties, each&nbsp; one providing it&rsquo;s own eating and drinking 
challenges. So, with that dress as my goal, these 10 tips from<em> Eating Well,
</em> should help us slip into it Dec 31st, &ldquo;Spanx free&rdquo;&nbsp; and 
wear it happily.</p> 
<p><strong>1. Eat breakfast.</strong></p> 
<p>Breakfast gives me a much-needed energy boost for the rest of the day. But 
perhaps more importantly (at least this time of year!), research shows that 
people who are most successful at losing weight eat breakfast every day. There 
are 3 things to include to make your breakfasts healthy: whole grains and lean 
protein to help you stay full right through until lunch, and some fruit for 
added fiber.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>2. Plan for the occasional treat.</strong></p> 
<p>Studies suggest that feeling deprived&mdash;even if you are consuming 
plenty of calories&mdash;can actually trigger overeating. Making any food 
off-limits just increases its allure: you can&rsquo;t avoid a trigger food your 
whole life, but you can learn how to eat the foods you binge on in moderation. 
If cookies are your downfall, it might be too tempting to keep in your 
house&mdash;but you can go our for a really good one (Great Harvest Bakery) or 
pick some up on the way to a party so you don&rsquo;t take them home.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>3. Fill up on fiber.</strong></p> 
<p>Boosting your fiber intake is one way to help prevent weight gain&mdash;or 
even promote weight loss. Recent research showed that boosting fiber by 8 grams 
for every 1,000 calories consumed resulted in losing about 4 1/2 pounds over 
the course of 2 years. Try it for yourself. If you&rsquo;re consuming 2,000 
calories per day, aim to increase your fiber by 16 grams.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>4. Give up grazing (at the buffet)<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Yes, eating regularly will help prevent you from feeling deprived and 
hungry, but grazing at the Holiday buffet can easily supply several 
meal&rsquo;s worth of calories. At the buffet you must opt for a small plate, 
raw stuff first, food that doesn&rsquo;t touch or stack on the plate and one 
and only one special treat.</p> 
<p>Plan four &ldquo;eating episodes&rdquo; each day&mdash;three meals and a 
snack&mdash;spaced at regular intervals to avoid going long stretches without 
eating (which can also trigger overeating). At each, include a little protein 
for additional staying power. (Keep hunger at bay with these yummy snacks in 
100-, 150-, 200- and 250-calorie increments.)</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>5. Boost your burn!<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>What you eat&mdash;or &ldquo;calories in&rdquo;&mdash;is only one half of 
the weight-loss equation. Exercise is equally important. Set a weekly goal to 
burn 1,000 calories through &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; exercise&mdash;such as our 
HIT classes, bootcamp and Cardio tramp workouts. And try to add activity into 
your everyday routines too.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>6. Keep your food diary!</strong></p> 
<p>Recording everything&mdash;the holiday cookie binge as well as the carrots 
and celery&mdash;makes you accountable for what you eat and can be incredibly 
motivating. And keeping track of your calories can help you lose weight, too, 
as it helps tip you off to behaviors that lead to weight gain.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>7. Eat with intention.</strong></p> 
<p>Have all your meals in a designated place without distractions (i.e., not 
in front of the TV or at your desk in front of your computer). Eat slowly, 
stopping to put your fork down between bites, feeling yourself becoming fuller. 
Making an effort to be mindful no matter what you&rsquo;re eating can help 
break the tendency to binge, experts say.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>8. Hide tempting foods.</strong></p> 
<p>When office workers were given candies in clear dishes to place on their 
desktops, they helped themselves to candy 71 percent more often than a similar 
group that was given the same candy in opaque dishes so the candy wasn&rsquo;t 
visible, according to research out of Cornell University. The same goes for 
your snacks at home: stash the chips inside a cupboard and keep the apples out 
on the counter.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>9. Make overeating a hassle.</strong></p> 
<p>The more stops you introduce in getting a food&mdash;such as needing to 
open a package or having to thaw something frozen&mdash;the more opportunities 
you have to ask, &ldquo;Am I really hungry?&rdquo; Repackage cookies in 
single-portion bags (or pay more for individually portioned snacks); wrap 
leftover slices of lasagna individually in foil and freeze.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>10. Think small.</strong></p> 
<p>If you want to have your fruitcake and eat it, too, try simply controlling 
portions. A salad plate or kid-size plate is perfect for your main meal. Use a 
small bowl for soup and a white-wine glass instead of a big red-wine glass.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Your thoughts&hellip;.</strong></p> 
<p><em><strong>How do you make sure that your party clothes fit?</strong></em>

<h2>  CAN I DRINK ON A DIET? </h2>  December 3rd, 2010 | Author: admin <br>

<h1></h1> 
<h1><br>
</h1> 
<h1>Can I Drink and Diet? Of Course You Can</h1> 
<p>There is nothing to stop you having one or even two alcoholic drinks a day 
if you want to. Or you could try keeping off the booze through the week and 
letting your guard down a bit for only one day on the weekend &ndash; it could 
work for you.<em><strong>You still can&rsquo;t make like an unrestrained 
Doberman in the butcher shop, but you can have a few drinks to unwind and still 
manage to lose your unwanted fat.</strong></em></p> 
<p>But. You knew there&rsquo;d be a &ldquo;but&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t you? 
Let&rsquo;s get the hopeful, positive stuff over with before turning to the 
grim bits. Of course you can drink (alcohol) and diet. There is nothing to stop 
you having one or even two drinks a day if you want to. Red wine is actually 
promoted as a healthy drink in moderation, so you might want to have a glass 
with a meal.</p> 
<p>If you are going to drink alcohol and successfully diet at the same time, 
you need to be very aware of how many calories as well as standard drinks you 
are consuming. Like everything related to sensible diet, the amount of alcohol 
you can safely consume in a day according to the health police is very very 
little. The size the authorities measure a standard drink in can look a bit of 
a lame joke to a seasoned and thirsty drinker. However, that&rsquo;s the sad 
reality. If you intend to drink and diet, your alcohol consumption will be the 
square root of not very much at all.</p> 
<p><em><strong>If you keep off the booze through the week and let your guard 
down a bit for only one day on the weekend, it could work for you</strong></em>
. You still can&rsquo;t make like an unrestrained Doberman in the butcher shop, 
but you can have a few drinks to unwind. Remember, it&rsquo;s like one cheat 
meal per week, have 2 or 3 drinks on one day on the weekend as a regular treat 
&ndash; if you can stick to it. If you don&rsquo;t have this discipline, your 
weight loss efforts will fail.<br>
<em><strong><br>
 If you factor your 
(minimal) alcohol intake into your daily calorie count</strong><strong>it is 
worth remembering that alcohol = empty calories</strong></em> . So the only 
benefits to gain from an alcoholic drink are those related to alcohol as a 
relaxant. But as a relaxant, alcohol takes away the desire to exercise, to eat 
well and to give a damn about your fatty bits.</p> 
<p>If you really want a drink or two a day, carefully study a calorie counter 
guide. I&rsquo;ve known girls to drink rum and diet coke in the misguided 
belief that the diet coke is saving them enough calories to justify the sugar 
saturated, calorie laden rum component. Similarly, gin and tonic has a sneaky 
number of calories but a lot of these are in the tonic water.</p> 
<p>Wine is not the worst choice for a weight control diet and if you can bear 
a spritzer of half wine and half flat or fizzy water; you can double your 
drink, but limit your alcohol. One 7 ounce beer is around 100 calories. That 
means for every &ldquo;standard&rdquo; beer you drink, you could walk briskly 
for 10-15 minutes to negate the calories consumed or go without 100 calories of 
some other, more nutritious food or drink.</p> 
<p>It sounds quite feasible till the 3rd or 4th beer. After that, you will 
probably be making sly glances at the vending machine in the corner of the pub 
and checking through your loose change. Alcohol has an affinity for salty, 
fatty snack foods.<br>
<em><strong><br>
 There is no fat in alcohol, but the 
sugar can be a killer for your diet. If you consume more sugar than your body 
needs, your clever body will plan to park it somewhere in case you need it 
later. While it is parked, it will convert to fat. So if you drink even a 
moderate amount of alcohol while trying to lose weight, your body is likely to 
thank you by slapping lard deposits in all your bumpiest storage facilities.
</strong></em></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s up to you. You can lose weight and not give up alcohol in the 
process. You may not be able to. I&rsquo;ve successfully lost a lot of weight 
using both strategies; moderation and total abstinence. I have never kept 
weight off when I did not give up drinking. Drinking lowered my resistance to 
food cravings and I gave into them over time. Abstinence has meant that I 
always have my wits about me regarding my daily food choices and I am always 
motivated enough to exercise and enjoy my healthy lifestyle.</p> 
<p>I do miss a good red or a cold beer, but for me the trade off is worth the 
sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, if I feel myself waiver, I just take a hard look at 
my naked butt in the shower.&nbsp; Works every time!</p> 
<p>And just in case you think you&rsquo;ll skip the cocktail and go for a nice 
cup of egg nog, remember an 8 ounce glass of that magic will cost you 350 
calories,&nbsp; 191 of them as fat calories.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather have the 
wine!</p> 
<p><em><strong>Share your holiday drinking tips with others &ndash; add it to 
the post below.&nbsp; It takes a village, after all!</strong></em></p> <br>

and pie) is usually met with some resistance or even disdain!&nbsp;<strong>
That&rsquo;s why I went undercover to discover these super sleuth turkey recipes
</strong> that are so good, your loved ones will never dream they&rsquo;re 
eating<strong>LEFTOVERS.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Have a trick or two up your sleeve? </strong>Don&rsquo;t be 
stingy.&nbsp; Post yours below so everyone can benefit!&nbsp; Because even 
Secret Agents need a little help now and then&hellip;.</p> 
<p><em>Tired of Thanksgiving turkey? Here&rsquo;s 5 amazingly creative meal 
options:</em></p>

<h2>  Save 400 calories with this Thanksgiving Sweet Potato Recipe! </h2>  
November 13th, 2010 | Author:admin <br>

<p><strong>Pilates 1901 and the Leaner Stronger Sooner Fat Loss program&rsquo;s
</strong><strong>Holiday Eating Recipes </strong>continue with this wonderful T
<strong>hanksgiving Sweet Potato Meringue recipe</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of 
these recipes are from a wonderful book called,&nbsp;<strong>The Simple Art of 
Eating Well</strong> by Jessie Price.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combined, these delicious 
recipes will save you and your family a whopping 1273 calories at the table 
this Thanksgiving!&nbsp; And all without feeling deprived!</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3><strong>Meringue topped Sweet Potatoes</strong></h3> 
<p>This lightened-up take on the classic Thanksgiving sweet potato casserole 
is spiked with crushed pineapple and toasted pecans. We top it with an airy, 
slightly sweet meringue. You can pipe the meringue to make it look fancy or 
simply spread it neatly with a rubber spatula.</p> 
<p><strong>Healthier Secret: Sweet potatoes need not taste like dessert. 
</strong><br>
 If you didn&rsquo;t know better, it would be easy to mistake the 
classic marshmallow-topped sweet potato casserole for a dessert instead of a 
side dish. So we cut the butter and sugar and use evaporated milk for 
creaminess and crushed pineapple (with just 2 tablespoons of brown sugar) for a 
mellow touch of sweetness. Plus we skip the marshmallows and top it with 
meringue.<em>The result:&#8200;we cut more than 400 calories and 15 grams of 
fat per serving.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Sweet Potato Casserole</strong><br>
 2 1/2 pounds sweet potatoes 
(about 3 medium), peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks<br>
 2 large eggs<br>
 2 
tablespoons brown sugar<br>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
 1 tablespoon 
canola oil<br>
 1 cup low-fat evaporated milk<br>
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
<br> 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
 1 8-ounce can crushed pineapple, undrained<br>
 1/2 
cup chopped pecans, toasted (see Tip)</p> 
<p><strong>Meringue Topping</strong><br>
 4 teaspoons dried egg whites (see 
Note), reconstituted according to package directions,<em>or</em> 2 large 
pasteurized egg whites, at room temperature<br>
 1/4 cup granulated sugar</p> 
<p>1. Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to 
a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain 
well and transfer to a food processor. Process until smooth.<br>
 2. Preheat 
oven to 350&deg;F. Coat an 8-inch-square (or similar 2-quart) broiler-safe 
baking dish (see Tip) with cooking spray.<br>
 3. Whisk whole eggs, brown 
sugar, cinnamon, oil, evaporated milk, vanilla and salt in a large bowl until 
smooth. Add the sweet potato; whisk until smooth. Stir in pineapple and its 
juice. Spread the mixture in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with pecans.<br>
 4. Bake the casserole until heated through and the edges are bubbling, 35 to 
45 minutes. Set aside while you make the topping.</p> 
<p><strong>To prepare meringue topping:</strong> Position rack in top third of 
oven; preheat broiler. Beat egg whites in a medium bowl with an electric mixer 
at high speed until soft peaks form (see Tip). Beat in granulated sugar in a 
slow, steady stream. Continue beating until stiff peaks form.</p> 
<p>Spoon the meringue into a gallon-size sealable bag. Seal the bag, pressing 
out as much air as possible. Cut a 1/2-inch hole in one corner. Pipe the 
meringue onto the casserole, making marshmallow-size dots. (Alternatively, use 
a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch tip or spread the meringue over the 
casserole as if you were frosting a cake.) Broil until lightly browned, 
watching carefully to prevent burning, 30 to 90 seconds.</p>

<li>To toast chopped nuts, place in a small dry skillet and cook over 
medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant and lightly browned, 2 to 
4 minutes</li> 
<li> A broiler-safe baking dish is one made of metal or earthenware. Glass 
baking dishes, such as Pyrex, may shatter under the broiler.</li> 
<li> To make soft peaks, beat egg whites with an electric hand mixer until 
they are stiff, but still soft enough to curl over when beaters are turned 
upside down.</li> 
<li>Pasteurized dried egg whites are a wise choice in recipes that call for 
uncooked egg whites. Look for brands like Just Whites in the baking section of 
most supermarkets.</li> </ul>

<h2>  Holiday Eating Series: Sausage Stuffing that's legal! </h2>  November 
11th, 2010 | Author:admin <br>

<h2>Sausage Stuffing</h2> 
<p>Calories Saved: 187</p> 
<p><strong>Healthy Eating&nbsp; Secret: Stuffing is best made from scratch. 
</strong><br>
 Instead of prepackaged stuffing mix, start with good, wholesome 
ingredients. This sausage stuffing has about half the calories and 87% less 
saturated fat than traditional sausage stuffing because we use more apples and 
vegetables and less bread and sausage. Plus we go with whole-wheat bread for 
added fiber and turkey sausage because it has less fat than regular pork 
sausage.</p> 
<p><strong><em>This classic stuffing pairs turkey sausage with the tangy 
sweetness of apples. By using turkey sausage instead of pork, we cut the fat 
content from 19 grams to 4.</em></strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 8 cups cubed whole-wheat bread (10-12 slices)</li> 
<li> 8 ounces bulk turkey sausage</li> 
<li> 1 1/2 teaspoons canola oil</li> 
<li> 3 stalks celery, chopped</li> 
<li> 2 medium onions, chopped</li> 
<li> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li> 
<li> 3 Golden Delicious <em>or</em> McIntosh apples, peeled and chopped</li> 
<li> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage <em>or</em> 2 teaspoons dried rubbed 
</li> 
<li> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme <em>or</em> 1/2 teaspoon dried </li> 
<li> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li> 
<li> 2 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth </li> 
<li> 1/4 teaspoon salt </li> 
<li> Freshly ground pepper to taste</li> </ul> 
<p>1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Spread bread on a baking sheet and bake until 
lightly toasted, 15 to 20 minutes.</p> 
<p>2. Meanwhile, cook sausage in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, 
stirring with a wooden spoon to break it up, until no longer pink, 5 to 10 
minutes. Drain in a colander to remove excess fat.</p> 
<p>3. Add oil to the pan and heat over medium-low heat. Add celery, onions and 
garlic; cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add apples and cook, 
stirring, until tender, 8 to 10 minutes more. Transfer to a large bowl.</p> 
<p>4. Add the sausage, toasted bread, sage, thyme and basil to the bowl. Toss 
well. Drizzle broth over the mixture and toss until evenly moistened. Season 
with salt and pepper. Transfer to a lightly oiled 9-by-13-inch baking pan.</p> 
<p>5. Cover the stuffing with foil and bake until heated through, 35 to 45 
minutes. If you want a crisp top, uncover it for the last 15 minutes.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>This recipe makes: 10 servings, about 3/4 cup each</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Calories per serving</strong>: 183 calories; 4 g fat (1 g sat, 2 g 
mono); 17 mg cholesterol; 26 g carbohydrate; 2 g added sugars; 11 g protein; 4 
g fiber; 512 mg sodium; 317 mg potassium.</p> 
<p>Active time: 50 minutes | Total: 1 hour 20&nbsp; minutes | To make ahead: 
Prepare through Step 4; cool, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Let stand 
at room temperature for about 45 minutes before baking.</p>

<h2>  Feel Like You're Retaining the Boston Harbor? </h2>  October 30th, 2010 
| Author:admin <br>

<p></p> 
<h3>HOW TO BEAT WATER WEIGHT GAIN</h3> 
<p>We all go through it at one point or another&ndash;our pants get snug, our 
fingers swell, and we feel puffed out. To make matters worse, the number on the 
scale goes up even though we&rsquo;re sticking to a healthful routine. Most 
women retain water for several days, or for even a week or two, before 
menstruation. Although the causes aren&rsquo;t quite clear, experts believe 
fluctuating hormone and blood sugar levels may play a role.</p> 
<p>The good news is while we can&rsquo;t completely sidestep Mother Nature 
altogether, these 4 diet and lifestyle tweaks can help us minimize bloat and 
help our bodies get rid of excess water weight in no time flat.</p> 
<p><strong>Pump Up Potassium </strong><br>
<br>
 Many fruits and vegetables 
boast potassium, a mineral that helps maintain the body&rsquo;s water balance. 
Potassium-rich fruits include canned pumpkin (just in time for Thanksgiving), 
papaya, bananas, plantains, and dried fruit including dates, raisins, and 
prunes. Choose fresh, dried or canned fruit made without added sugar and aim 
for 1.5 to 2 cups a day.<br>
<br>
 Potassium-rich vegetables include spinach, 
sweet or white potatoes, beet greens, mushrooms, bok choy, parsnips, and tomato 
products (paste, sauce, or pureed). Choose fresh or canned products made 
without sodium or added sugar, and aim for 2 to 2.5 cups a day. Check out our
VITABOT online nutrition program to learn more about serving sizes.<br>
<br>

<strong>Sideline Sodium</strong><br>
<br>
 Current dietary guidelines recommend 
capping sodium at no more than 2,300 milligrams per day; those with high blood 
pressure (or a family history of the condition), diabetes, or kidney disease, 
adults over the age of 40, and African Americans are encouraged to consume no 
more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium each day.<br>
<br>
 When grocery shopping, 
look for foods and beverages labels that boast &ldquo;sodium free,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;very low sodium,&rdquo; &ldquo;low sodium,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;unsalted,&rdquo; &ldquo;no salt added,&rdquo; and &ldquo;without added 
salt on labels;&rdquo; choose fresh meats and poultry over &ldquo;deli 
meats;&rdquo; and choose fresh fish and shellfish over processed, canned 
options (though you can rinse canned fish to remove about half the 
sodium).&nbsp; Reading Nutrition Facts Panels on packages (and on Calorie 
Count) is a great way to find lower sodium options.<br>
<br>
<strong>Float Your 
Bloat</strong><br>
<br>
 While sodium contributes to bloating, water does 
not.&nbsp; In fact, good old H20 can make us eliminate excess fluid and sodium. 
Women should aim for about 5 to 6 8-ounce cups each day (you can add one or two 
cups of skim milk, up to one cup of 100% fruit juice, and even a few cups of 
coffee or tea can also count towards meeting your daily water quota). 
It&rsquo;s okay to have sparkling water or club soda, but be sure to read the 
fine print on labels since many of them have added sodium.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Work up a Sweat</strong><br>
<br>
 Even though being bloated may make you want 
to do nothing but drown yourself in comfort foods while sprawled out on the 
sofa, taking time to go on a brisk walk, take aCARDIO TRAMP class, or circuit 
train in aPilates Bootcamp workout to help you sweat out even more sodium and 
feel lighter on your toes.</p>

<h2>  THE TRICK TO MANAGING TREATS&hellip; </h2>  October 28th, 2010 | Author: 
admin <br>

<h1>DON&rsquo;T LET HALLOWEEN SCARE YOU INTO OVEREATING&hellip;</h1> <br>

Halloween candy showed up in August (as though we needed to get a jump on our 
holiday shopping!) and will still be on sale in November. What is the trick to 
managing your weight when the food you love is everywhere?This post, from 
caloriecount.com is a great primer for negotiating the Halloween treat maze.<br>
<br> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Scaring Away the Cravings</strong></p> 
<p>Halloween can be a scary time of year for those trying to eat less. You may 
be haunted by all the candy in the house, leading to a full-blown chocolate 
binge, sugar hangover, and vows to do better tomorrow.&nbsp; We call this the
<em>Eat-Repent-Repeat Cycle.</em><br>
<br>
 The tricky part is that labeling 
the foods you love as evil actually increases their power over you. When what 
you really crave is considered &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; you feel guilty for even 
wanting it and deprived because you can&rsquo;t have it.</p> 
<p><em>The result? </em>You find yourself foraging treats from the pumpkin 
basket and burying the candy wrappers at the bottom of the garbage can so your 
children won&rsquo;t find out. Of course they inevitably discover that 
you&rsquo;ve been sneaking and stealing their candy. Talk about guilt! &nbsp;
<br> </p> 
<p><br>
<strong>How to Stop Raiding Your Kid&rsquo;s Trick-or-Treat Loot
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Minimize your exposure.</strong><br>
 Wait until the last minute to 
buy Halloween candy then buy only what you really think you&rsquo;ll need for 
the big night. Get the stuff kids love rather than bags and bags of your 
favorites.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember, it&rsquo;s not your food.<br>
</strong>All too often we 
eat whatever shows up&ndash;Halloween candy, donuts in the break room, or 
samples in the grocery store. But you didn&rsquo;t choose to put it there so 
stop mindlessly putting it in your mouth!</p> 
<p><strong>Get your own.</strong><br>
 You&rsquo;ll be less tempted to get 
into the kid&rsquo;s holiday candy if stop depriving yourself the rest of the 
year. Scary, I know.<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Share! </strong><br>
 If you really want some candy, ask your child 
to share a few pieces with you. Through observation, they learn that it is 
possible to balance eating for nourishment with eating for enjoyment.</p> 
<p><strong>Eat what you love.</strong><br>
 Skip the sugary kid candy (unless 
that&rsquo;s what you love) and instead choose a few that you really love. Set 
them aside to eat when you really want them. I like to keep mine in a plastic 
bag in the freezer.</p> 
<p><strong>Save room for dessert. </strong><br>
 If you&rsquo;re going to eat 
Halloween candy (you know you are!), then adjust for it. After all, does it 
really make sense to eat all your dinner to earn dessert?</p> 
<p><strong>If you love it that much, act like it!</strong><br>
 Enjoy those 
M&amp;Ms&reg; one at a time, mindfully without distractions.</p> 
<p><strong>Just right! </strong><br>
 The fun-sized treats are the perfect 
size for a few mindful bites of heaven. And those first few bites are always 
the best, so think before you dive in for more.</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Eat fearlessly <em>without </em>guilt.</strong>We all know that 
guilt leads to more eating, not less, so let it go.<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t torture yourself with exercise.</strong><br>
 Being 
physically active feels good and provides numerous benefits for your health. 
Just be careful not to turn it into punishment for eating or penance for eating 
something &ldquo;bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Pass it on.</strong>
Halloween is a great time to teach your kids how to enjoy a little candy as 
part of a healthy and active lifestyle.</p> 
<p>At <strong>Pilates 1901 </strong>we believe in a realistic approach to 
health and fat loss. &nbsp;Your life should not be one of denial &ndash; it 
should be one of joy! &nbsp;Just keep in mind that your goal, a vibrant, 
healthy, lean and strong body is not supported by sugar!<br>

<h2>  AS THE DAYS GET SHORTER, DO WE GET FATTER? </h2>  October 18th, 2010 | 
Author:admin <br>

<h2>Why it matters when we eat after dark&hellip;</h2> 
<p>Few of us realize the degree to which our sleeping patterns affect our 
weight.&nbsp; But this week, a well-designed study shed some light on how the 
absence of darkness while we sleep may contribute to weight gain, at least in 
mice.&nbsp; It may be that &ldquo;a calorie is not always a calorie&rdquo; when 
the biological clock is upset by exposure to light.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, as this 
article from caloriecount.com suggests,<em><strong> the time when food is eaten 
may be more important than was previously thought.</strong></em></p> <strong>
<br> Staying Up Late</strong> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> With the invention of the light bulb at the start of the 20th 
century, humans became exposed to unnatural light at night.&nbsp; Now, besides 
staying up after nightfall, people commonly fall asleep with lights on from 
TVs, computers, other gadgets, and outdoor lights. <br>

<p><strong>Weight Gain and Sleep</strong></p> 
<p>The scientists exposed three groups of mice to different light cycles. 
Group-1 was exposed to 16 hours of bright light and 8 hours of darkness; 
Group-2 was exposed to 24 hours of bright light; Group-3 was exposed to 16 
hours of bright light and 8 hours of dim light. The three groups of mice ate 
the same amount of food and got the same amount of exercise, but the mice in 
Groups-2 and -3 gained almost 50 percent more weight than the mice in Group-1 
and they experienced a rise in blood sugar too. The dim illumination was akin 
to having a portable TV in a bedroom.</p> 
<p><strong>Eating Instead of Sleeping</strong></p> 
<p>The researchers noticed that the mice exposed to light ate more than half 
of their calories during normal sleeping hours, and so they went back to the 
lab to control the time when the mice ate. The three groups of mice were 
exposed to the same differing light cycles, but the time when they ate was 
controlled. It turned out that the mice in Groups-2 and -3 did not gain weight 
when their mealtimes were restricted to normal activity hours. What mattered 
more than light was timing of meals.</p> 
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong><br>
</p> 
<p>Hunger can strike at all odd hours and when it does late at night, no 
matter what time it is, the hunger pangs refuse to ebb. You invariably seek 
solace in your refrigerator when you start looking for a midnight snack. 
Midnight hunger pangs are a common phenomenon but they are not only 
inconvenient but also has bad effects on your health.</p> 
<p>Snacking at midnight first of all disrupts the metabolism. The body is used 
to getting relaxed late at night and the metabolism also is slow. When you eat 
at this time, the digestive system pushes to digest the food. This disrupts the 
metabolic cycle and the additional food does not get digested by the time you 
are up in the morning ready for breakfast.</p> 
<p>Therefore it is highly likely that you will not have the right amount of 
breakfast. This makes you eat between meals during the day, which tends to add 
on to the weight. Also the digestive system that is meant to rest at night does 
extra work.</p> 
<p>Secondly, late night snacks usually are not healthy. The hunger is sudden 
and you usually do not prepare something for yourself. Cheese and bread or 
fruits are the common available options. If you have an unhealthy snack, it 
adds on to your weight and disrupts the metabolic activities as mentioned 
earlier.</p> 
<p>If you have fruits, chances are high that you will have acidity and you 
might not be able to sleep properly. The digestive system gets overworked and 
the extra food content disrupts the whole cycle and if you develop a habit of 
snacking at midnight, your digestion will get thrown out of gear.</p> 
<p>There are many tips to avoid midnight snacking. If you have the urge, drink 
a glass of water or two. You can also opt for herbal tea with artificial 
sweetener. Warm food tends to satisfy your appetite better. Stick to your meal 
times. Have the last meal 3 hours before sleeping and top it with a light salad 
so that there is enough fiber in the body along with a lot of water content. 
Brush your teeth before sleeping. That will prepare you mentally not to eat.</p>
It is probably much too soon to extrapolate the results of the mice studies to 
humans, but it is interesting to think about whether weight gain and glucose 
control is related to when calories are consumed. Light probably disrupts the 
biological clock, and when that&rsquo;s combined with nighttime eating, weight 
gain and blood sugar problems may ensue. <br>
<strong>But in the meantime, 
it&rsquo;s best to make eating after the sun goes down an exception and not the 
rule.</strong> <br>
