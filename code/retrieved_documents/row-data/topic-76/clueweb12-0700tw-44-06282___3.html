<p>The cornerstone of any good weight-loss program, of course, is watching 
what we eat. But for those of us with a sweet tooth, that can be tough. 
However, Fitness Expert Basheerah Ahmad says you don't necessarily have to give 
up sugar completely.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's no secret that Americans love sugar,&quot; she says. &quot;In 
fact, over the last 20 years in the U.S., we have increased our consumption of 
sugar from 26 pounds to 135 pounds per person per year. High consumption of 
sugar in the body can relate to heart disease, obesity and diabetes.&quot;</p> 
<p>So how can we get our sweet fix and stay as healthy as possible?</p> 
<p>&quot;Now in order to help you choose which sugar is best for you, I've 
separated our sweeteners into two categories,&quot; explains Basheerah. 
&quot;The first are natural sugars, and the second are artificial sweeteners. 
So, with our natural sugars, we have table sugar or white sugar, very 
chemically refined and void of nutrients. In fact, the body has to borrow from 
healthy cells in order to metabolize it.</p> 
<p>Then we have our raw sugar or brown sugar, a little bit chemically refined, 
but it has a little bit more nutritional content.</p> 
<p>Now we have our honey. Most of us think honey comes from bees, it doesn't 
get any more natural than that. But what we forget is, it's extremely refined. 
And also, honey has more calories per serving than any form of sugar. So be 
careful when consuming large amounts of honey.</p> 
<p>Now for those of you who are cutting calories and want to avoid natural 
sugars altogether, you may have considered using artificial sweeteners. But you 
have to remember artificial sweeteners are loaded with chemicals, some with 
names I can't even pronounce. So are they really the better choice?</p> 
<p>My personal favorite is any sugar that comes from the Stevia plant. Not 
only does it have zero calories, but it's also completely natural.&quot;</p> 
<p>So the next time you need to get your sugar fix, reach for something that's 
low in calories, but also natural and won't hurt your body.</p>
