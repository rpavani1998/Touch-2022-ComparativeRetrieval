 Baking Without Sugar <br>

<h2>Solving the sweet mystery</h2> <br>

 Brian Hinton solves the sweet mystery.<br>
Since early childhood, 
sweet treats have been the comfort food of choice for most of us.&nbsp;Go into 
any supermarket and usually, there are free cookies to 
sample.&nbsp;Grandma&rsquo;s cookies, cakes and muffins have been imprinted on 
us for life, and we look for these tastes in the bakery section each and every 
visit.<br>
 Over thousands of years, our bodies have used natural sweeteners 
such as fruit, honey, leaves and bark to satisfy the craving for 
sugar.&nbsp;Today, natural sugars are refined to the point of providing zero 
nutrition, due to consumer concerns about weight gain, depression, 
inflammation, migraines and Type 2 diabetes.<br>
<br>
 As an industry, we sell 
sugar in many guises, from the icing on a cake to the soft breads and rolls 
that are part of our daily diet.&nbsp;Times are changing, with the successor to 
low-carb being low sugar or no sugar added, according to the New York Times. 
&nbsp;By the start of 2007, it&rsquo;s estimated that over 11 per cent of all 
new food products on store shelves will be labelled &ldquo;reduced 
sugar.&rdquo;&nbsp;For the retail baker, replacing sugar offers many pitfalls; 
and with new labelling regulations coming into effect at the end of this year, 
any use of sugar substitutes requires an additional nutritional declaration.<br>
<br> Those who would demonize sugar, include all types of refined sugar, 
glucose, HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), invert sugar and icing sugar in the 
term or broad category.&nbsp;That being the case, what are the choices for the 
baker looking for a refined sugar replacement?<br>
<br>
 First, a return to 
sweeteners long forgotten &ndash; honey, molasses, rice, barley and maple 
syrups.&nbsp;Honey is available in light, amber and dark, with taste and colour 
determined by the surrounding flora.&nbsp;For the baker, darker honey, such as 
buckwheat, can give character to baked goods such as muffins and cookies. The 
most economical and readily available is No. 1 blended Canadian, which comes 
pastuerized (this process kills yeasts and some bacteria) or non-pastuerized. 
Molasses varieties include blackstrap, which is produced during the refining of 
white sugar &ndash; look for the unsulfured grade.&nbsp;This dark syrup has a 
pronounced taste and flavour, and is high in minerals, including iron. Barbados 
molasses comes from whole cane sugar, and is less sweet, with a fraction of the 
minerals.&nbsp;Rice or barley syrups are produced by using enzymes to convert 
the starch into a sweet syrup.&nbsp;Malt syrup is better tolerated by diabetics 
because it doesn&rsquo;t stimulate insulin production.&nbsp;Maple syrup is 
limited as an inclusionary ingredient, but does provide excellent flavour 
profiles &ndash; both on its own, and with vanilla.<br>
<br>
 The use of sugar 
in daily breads and buns is totally unnecessary, other than to provide a cheap 
bread softener.&nbsp;Many other ingredients are available that perform the same 
function.&nbsp;Artificial sweeteners have no place in a yeast dough; common 
substitutes for sugar being lower levels of non-diastatic malt syrups or 
molasses which support yeast fermentation activity, and promote crust browning.
<br> <br>
 For white sugar to syrup recipe conversions, start at straight 
weight exchange, and reduce the liquids by 25 per cent &ndash; some minor 
adjustments may be required.&nbsp;Because of their high humectancy, syrups will 
attract moisture and keep products soft for extended periods of 
time.&nbsp;Caloric values will remain high, and other ingredients have to be 
introduced that mimic the tenderizing qualities of white sugar.&nbsp;Consider 
resistant starches and gums, since they are readily available in small 
quantities, together with recommended uses.<br>
<br>
 When we look at 
modern-day sugar substitutes, a different picture emerges &ndash; the choice 
beween polyalcohols and a chlorinated sugar or a&nbsp;no-calorie sweetener, 
such as&nbsp;SPLENDA&reg;&nbsp;Sucra-lose,&nbsp;is a difficult 
one.&nbsp;Formulating with substitutes at the retail level is error prone, and 
diagnosing how to fix inferior baked goods can be hit and miss.&nbsp;When 
looking at a cookie form-ula with 20 to 25 per cent sucrose, the sugar not only 
acts as a bulking agent, but provides sweetness, colour and appropriate 
texture. These characteristics are essential, and must be maintained when a 
switch to artificial sweeteners is made. The public&rsquo;s reaction when 
seeing them on an ingredient declaration varies, depend on whether they are 
organic focused, just want to lose weight or are insulin dependent.<br>
<br>
 
As a retail baker, most of my recipes combine two or three sugar substitutes, 
the easiest to source being SPLENDA&reg; or SPLENDA&reg;&nbsp;Sucralose &ndash; 
artificial sweeteners which can be bought either commercially or from a local 
supermarket.&nbsp;The others that I use most frequently include Maltitol and 
Xylitol, each bringing a specific function to the baked goods.&nbsp;We use 
Maltitol in a straight one-to-one substitution in sponge cakes, and 
SPLENDA&reg;&nbsp;in cookies and muffins.&nbsp;For many years, diabetics have 
used products sweetened with poly-alcohol sugars like Sorbitol, Xylitol, 
Maltitol, and Mannitol. These are natural sweeteners that do not trigger an 
insulin reaction (Xylitol can be derived from birch tree pulp).&nbsp;They have 
half the calories of sugar, and are not digested by the small 
intestine.&nbsp;Sorbitol is 50 per cent as sweet as sugar, its GRAS (generally 
recommended as safe) rating in baked goods for use at 30 per cent.<br>
<br>
 
One natural sweetener loved by naturopaths everywhere is stevia, which is grown 
in South America, and a relative of the chrysanthemum.&nbsp;Its leaves provide 
an intense sweetness &ndash; some 300 times that of sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp;As yet, 
it is not recognized by Health Canada or the FDA as a sweetener, so it cannot 
be used as a dietary supplement.&nbsp;As with all artificial sweeteners, 
consumption over extended periods of time, toxicology tests and long-term use 
will determine stevia&rsquo;s safety in food products.<br>
<br>
 The overall 
trend for more healthy baked goods is being vocalized by all segments of 
consumers, from the schools through to seniors looking for good nutritious 
foods to form part of a well-balanced diet.&nbsp;The position of sugar in the 
ingredient list and the nutritional facts table will largely determine how the 
general public views the baking industry&rsquo;s ability to supply nutritious 
and beneficial foods.<br>
