<h1> 6 Best Sweeteners To Use For A Healthy Vegan Diet Plan </h1>  27 September
<br> <br>
<br>

<p>The <b>best sweeteners</b> are the ones that are as close to whole as 
possible, don't cause too much of a blood sugar swing and still taste good. 
It&rsquo;s a good idea to try to minimize the use of sweeteners in general, but 
if you have a sweet tooth like me, choosing good ones lets you give in without 
throwing off your healthy eating plan.</p>

<p>Hey guys! This is Heather from HealthyEatingStartsHere.com. Today I wanna 
talked about the best sweeteners to use.</p> 
<p>So, I&rsquo;m gonna go over my top ones but first thing I just wanna say 
that whenever you&rsquo;re using sweeteners the best idea is to minimize how 
much you&rsquo;re using. A little bit is okay and some are better than others 
but same time you could always over do it, so keep it minimal and then what you 
want to choose are one of these.</p> 
<p>So my top sweetener is fruit, I loved to use fresh fruit on top of my 
morning porridge. Dried fruits and baking so raisins, things like that can 
sweeten things up really nicely. And then pureed fruits are really good at 
mixing things when you&rsquo;re doing some baking as well.</p> 
<p>So my main example would be apple sauce, great to use in baking and you 
wanna go for the unsweetened kind because fruit has the natural sugars in it 
already.</p> 
<p>So there you go, fruit is my best sweetener.</p> 
<p>Then if you want to use something other than a fruit, you can go for a few 
options and the one I used most often is unrefined sugar and I store it in my 
apple sugar jar once I finished my apple sauce and if you can see there it 
looks like little grains of sand. Ok.</p> 
<p>You wanna look for that kind of texture rather than a crystal sugar because 
the crystals have been refined in some way, where&rsquo;s that stuff it&rsquo;s 
just, it&rsquo;s a cane sugar so it&rsquo;s just a juice from the cane, the 
middle of the cane just dried, where every time you see a crystal it&rsquo;s 
been refined in some way.</p> 
<p>Now white sugar has had all of the nutrients stripped away and then the 
main thing they get stripped off is molasses so that&rsquo;s another sweeteners 
that I like to used because it has all of those nutrients in it.</p> 
<p>But when you look at something like brown sugar, one thing I learned that 
was pretty surprising to me is that brown sugar is just white sugar same 
refined white crystals which is a bit of molasses added back to them.</p> 
<p>So while I like molasses okay, I don&rsquo;t like brown sugar because 
it&rsquo;s mainly just the white part; and then there&rsquo;s some other types 
of refined sugars like this one is Demerara. I don&rsquo;t know if you can see 
that very well on camera, but that&rsquo;s just crystals that have been turned 
a little bit brown by molasses.</p> 
<p>Same thing with muscovado sugar looks like just brown sugar and turbinado 
as well, it&rsquo;s darker so there&rsquo;s more molasses in there but 
it&rsquo;s still crystals. So again, you wanna look for this grainy looking, 
grainy looking sugar.</p> 
<p>Stevia is a fairly new one and it&rsquo;s a leaf and it&rsquo;s not 
actually a sugar, it&rsquo;s sweetens but it&rsquo;s not sugar. So it&rsquo;s 
really great for diabetics or hypoglycaemic or people who just have blood sugar 
fluctuation problems.</p> 
<p>So Stevia is best when if you use it in the whole leaf form, so that would 
be, it comes as green leaves that look pretty much like tea leaf and 
you&rsquo;ll see them in some tea bags, if you look in the ingredients 
sometimes. There&rsquo;s especially one brand of tea I forget which one it is 
now but they often use stevia.</p> 
<p>And then they also grind that up into a powder, if you wanna make sure 
you&rsquo;re looking for the green powder because it comes from the leaf, 
where&rsquo;s the white powder is somewhat the same as white sugar where things 
have been taken away.</p> 
<p>So it&rsquo;s always best when you&rsquo;re looking at fruits to go for the 
whole food form as much as possible; and sweeteners are the same thing. You 
wanna be getting as close to whole as possible. Stevia also comes as a liquid 
extract, and that&rsquo;s okay they used them, the green leaf to extract.</p> 
<p>I think the green powder is a better choice but if you want to, the liquid 
is okay as well.</p> 
<p>Some other sweeteners that I used so there are some liquids brown rice 
syrup is a good one. Molasses as I mentioned, it has all of the nutrients from 
the sugar even though it is technically processed and a little bit refined 
because it comes off.</p> 
<p>The sugar is okay because it&rsquo;s the- it&rsquo;s the good part; 
it&rsquo;s got a lot of iron, magnesium, stuff like that. And it taste great in 
gingerbread cookies.</p> 
<p>Maple syrup is another liquid one, and when I talk about a maple syrup, 
I&rsquo;m talking about like the pure stuff not the maple flavoured pancake 
syrups. Those aren&rsquo;t, those aren&rsquo;t maple syrup.</p> 
<p>The pure stuff is okay it is a little bit processed; they have to cook it 
for a really long time to get it sweetened up but in the big scheme of things, 
it&rsquo;s a pretty decent sweetener to use.</p> 
<p>A couple that I don&rsquo;t use and that often get thought of in the 
healthy category, I just wanted to mention quickly, so agave syrup is very 
highly processed they comes from a cactus.</p> 
<p>And cactus isn&rsquo;t really sweet on its own so you know they have to be 
processing it a lot in order to make it sweet and they -when it first came out 
they were saying that it didn&rsquo;t have the same effect on blood sugar 
levels but they&rsquo;re finding that it does.</p> 
<p>So I don&rsquo;t use agave, there are other options that don&rsquo;t have 
the same downsides. The other things are the artificial sweeteners so those are 
ones where they say that because it doesn&rsquo;t have an effect on blood 
sugar. I&rsquo;m talking about things like Splenda, NutraSweet, Sweet n low, 
all those things, they&rsquo;re chemicals &ndash;so they&rsquo;re- 
they&rsquo;re not good.</p> 
<p>Stevia is the option, the natural option to use if you want a no calorie, 
no blood sugar or fat sweetener. So that&rsquo;s a little overview of what I 
used and my favourite ones. And again, my favourite to used is fruit and 
anything else I just try to minimize as much as possible and keep as whole as 
possible when I get it.</p> 
<p>So, I wanna hear from you guys and what your favourite sweeteners are? Let 
me know by leaving comment and I will see you guys next time.</p>

anything else I just try to minimize as much as possible and keep as whole as 
possible when I get it.</p> 
<p>So, I wanna hear from you guys and what your favourite sweeteners are? Let 
me know by leaving comment and I will see you guys next time.</p> <br>

<h2>Fruit</h2> 
<p>My favorite sweetener by far is fruit. I slice fresh fruit into my morning 
porridge, I use applesauce and blended banana in baking, and I use dried fruits 
like dates and raisins in anything from oatmeal to cookies to coleslaw.</p> 
<h2>Unrefined Sugar (Sucanat)</h2> 
<p>There are unrefined versions of cane, palm and other sugars. Be sure to 
look for the word 'unrefined', and at the shape of the sugar. Unrefined sugar 
looks like grains of sand, not like crystals. The name on the one I buy is 
sucanat, and Wholesome Sweeteners is a brand to look for at your grocery store.
</p> 
<p>Any time you see a crystallized sugar, it's been refined and then formed 
into a crystal. Brown sugar is just white sugar with a bit of the molasses 
added back to it. Demerara, turbinado, 'raw' sugars &ndash; they've been 
refined, crystallized and coated in molasses to make them brown. I remember 
being blown away the first time I heard that.</p> 
<h2>Stevia</h2> 
<p>Stevia is a leaf, which doesn't sound very much like a sweetener, but it's 
actually even more potent than sugar. The cool thing about stevia is that it 
doesn't affect blood sugar levels, so this is really great for diabetics and 
hypoglycemics. Stevia is one non-sugar, zero-calorie sweetener that's actually 
natural and isn't harmful to you.</p> 
<p>You can find it in a few forms. The best is to use the leaf, the powdered 
leaf or a liquid extract. The white powder is a refined form, and isn't as good 
for you. You only need a tiny bit of stevia to sweeten, so be careful with it.
</p> 
<h2>Grain Sweeteners</h2> 
<p>Brown rice syrup is one of the best sweeteners because it's a fermented 
form of sugar and doesn't cause as much of a blood sugar swing as most others. 
It is processed, but not so much that it loses all of its nutrients. It's a 
really mild flavor, and will add a low level of sweetness to whatever you're 
making.</p> 
<h2>Molasses</h2> 
<p>When sugar is refined into white crystallized sugar, part of what's taken 
away is molasses. All of the nutrients from the sugar are in the molasses, so 
it's really high in things like iron, magnesium and B vitamins. It is a 
processed product, but overall it has a lot going for it. Gingerbread just 
isn't the same without that molasses flavor.</p> 
<h2>Pure Maple Syrup</h2> 
<p>I love the taste of maple syrup... It's not the best sweetener because it 
does give a kick to your blood sugar levels, but it's also not the worst and 
isn't refined too much. Just don't have too much at once and you'll be fine. 
(Note that this does not include the maple-flavored pancake syrups &ndash; 
those ones are terrible, stay away from them.)</p> 
<h2>Not-The-Best Sweeteners</h2> 
<p>There are a couple of sweeteners that I don't use, and because they 
sometimes get included in lists of 'healthy' sweeteners, I wanted to briefly 
mention why I don&rsquo;t choose them.</p> 
<p>Agave nectar is a syrup that comes from cactus. Now, cactus is not 
naturally sweet and the syrup has to be heavily refined to get it there. In my 
opinion, the sweeteners above that are much closer to their whole food state 
are the better option.</p> 
<p>Splenda and other artificial sweeteners (NutraSweet, Sweet n low, etc) are 
chemicals, and may not add calories or raise your blood sugar, but will have 
other negative effects. Some of them have been shown, some of them haven't, but 
with so many other good options try to steer clear.</p> 
<p>So, I think fruit, sucanat, stevia, brown rice syrup, molasses and maple 
syrup are the best sweeteners.<b>What&rsquo;s your favorite sweetener?</b> Let 
me know by leaving a comment below.</p>
