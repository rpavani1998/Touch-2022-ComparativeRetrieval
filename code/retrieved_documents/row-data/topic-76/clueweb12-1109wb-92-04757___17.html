<p>You can find news reports and research that indicate mercury, whether 
present in fish, vaccines, High Fructose Corn Syrup, proximity to coal-burning 
power plants or occurring naturally in the environment may be linked to 
increasing incidents of autism.<em>National Center for Biotechnology 
Information &ndash;A comprehensive review of mercury provoked autism.</em></p> 
<p>You can also find research that indicates no connection, particularly 
between mercury in vaccines and autism. I imagine vaccine manufacturers might 
have a vested interest in research results considering possible litigation.<em>
Discover &ndash;Vaccines and autism: yet another dead link.</em></p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re the parent of an autistic child, you struggle to find 
answers and solutions. My only experience with autism has been as the director 
of a day care center. We admitted a young autistic boy and discovered quickly 
we were unprepared for his behavior &ndash; throwing toys at and hitting the 
other children. Constantly. I cannot imagine how his parents coped.</p> 
<p>When do we admit that there is a correlation between the toxins we&rsquo;ve 
released into our environment, what we eat and drink, what medicines we take 
and our overall health? We are incredibly complex organisms about which we have 
relatively rudimentary knowledge. What research might prove for one group might 
not be true for others. There are more questions than answers.</p>

<h3> Mercury in High Fructose Corn Syrup &ndash; Take&nbsp;Two January 29, 2009
</h3>  Filed under: food, health &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 2:02 pm <br>

Refiners Association, HFCS, high fructose corn syrup, IATP, mercury, US

<p>The battle rages on about the presence of mercury in High Fructose Corn 
Syrup (HFCS)&hellip;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>According to an article published in the journal, <em>Environmental Health 
Journal, </em><em>m</em>ercury was found in nearly 50 per cent of tested 
samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A separate study by the US Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy 
(IATP) claims mercury was detected in nearly one-third of 55 brand name food 
and beverage products where HFCS is the first or second highest labeled 
ingredient, including, it claims, products by Quaker, Hershey&rsquo;s, Kraft 
and Smucker&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<em></em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>The Corn Refiners Association claim that:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;The study appears to be based on outdated information since the corn 
industry has used mercury-free versions of the two re-agents mentioned in the 
study, hydrochloric acid and caustic soda, for several years.&rdquo;<em> </em> 
<em>Source: Mercury tainted HFCS in produce, say researchers</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In the meantime, I was struck by a post in Amie&rsquo;s Notebook &ndash; 
Excuse me while I get on my soapbox for a moment&hellip;</p> 
<p>Amie&rsquo;s six year old daughter, Lucy, is a victim of mercury toxicity.
</p> 
<p>High fructose corn syrup is present in almost any prepared food you eat. 
It&rsquo;s there because it:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Is cheap, cheap, cheap</li> 
<li>Increases the shelf life of prepared foods</li> 
<li>Makes baked good brown more evenly</li> 
<li>Retains moisture and enhances other flavors</li> 
<li>Makes food taste sweet so you&rsquo;ll eat and buy more, more, more</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It is also completely avoidable.&nbsp; The pervasiveness of HFCS in 
prepared food products quite possibly means that exposure to mercury is greater 
for folks who eat those products on a daily basis. Pondering the acceptable 
level of mercury exposure is a little like taking my daughter into a horse barn 
for a wee bit. The last time she ended up in the hospital because she 
couldn&rsquo;t breathe. The difference is that mercury exposure is not always 
so dramatic as it is forLucy.</p> 
<p>Even without the possibility of mercury contamination, I avoid it like the 
plague and have for years. Don&rsquo;t kid yourself, food manufacturers do not 
produce food products for your health. They are in business to make money. 
Period.</p>

<h3> High Fructose Corn Syrup and&nbsp;Mercury January 26, 2009</h3>  Filed 
under:food, health &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 12:26 pm <br>
 Tags: FDA, HFCS, high 
fructose corn syrup, mercury, U.S. Food and Drug Administration <br>

<dl>

<p>Yet another reason to forgo eating or drinking prepared foods and beverages 
made with high fructose corn syrup&hellip;</p> 
<p>Mercury was found in nearly 50 percent of tested samples of commercial high 
fructose corn syrup (HFCS), according to a new article published today in the 
scientific journal, Environmental Health. A separate study by the Institute for 
Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) detected mercury in nearly one-third of 55 
popular brand-name food and beverage products where HFCS is the first or second 
highest labeled ingredient&mdash;including products by Quaker, Hershey&rsquo;s, 
Kraft and Smucker&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p>HFCS use has skyrocketed in recent decades as the sweetener has replaced 
sugar in many processed foods. HFCS is found in sweetened beverages, breads, 
cereals, breakfast bars, lunch meats, yogurts, soups and condiments. On 
average, Americans consume about 12 teaspoons per day of HFCS. Consumption by 
teenagers and other high consumers can be up to 80 percent above average levels.
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Mercury is toxic in all its forms,&rdquo; said IATP&rsquo;s David 
Wallinga, M.D., and a co-author in both studies. &ldquo;Given how much high 
fructose corn syrup is consumed by children, it could be a significant 
additional source of mercury never before considered. We are calling for 
immediate changes by industry and the FDA to help stop this avoidable mercury 
contamination of the food supply.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In the Environmental Health article, Dufault et al. found detectable levels 
of mercury in nine of 20 samples of commercial HFCS. Dufault was working at the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration when the tests were done in 2005. She and 
co-authors conclude that possible mercury contamination of food chemicals like 
HFCS was not common knowledge within the food industry that frequently uses the 
sweetener. While the FDA had evidence that commercial HFCS was contaminated 
with mercury four years ago, the agency did not inform consumers, help change 
industry practice or conduct additional testing.</p> 
<p>For its report &ldquo;Not So Sweet: Missing Mercury and High Fructose Corn 
Syrup,&rdquo; IATP sent 55 brand-name foods and beverages containing HFCS as 
the first or second ingredient to a commercial laboratory to be tested for 
total mercury. Nearly one in three products tested contained detectable 
mercury. Mercury was most prevalent in HFCS-containing dairy products, followed 
by dressings and condiments.</p> 
<p>In making HFCS, caustic soda is used, among other things, to separate corn 
starch from the corn kernel. For decades, HFCS has been made using 
mercury-grade caustic soda produced in industrial chlorine (chlor-alkali) 
plants. The use of mercury cells to produce caustic soda can contaminate 
caustic soda, and ultimately HFCS, with mercury.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;The bad news is that nobody knows whether or not their soda or snack 
food contains HFCS made from ingredients like caustic soda contaminated with 
mercury,&rdquo; said Dr. Wallinga. &ldquo;The good news is that mercury-free 
HFCS ingredients exist. Food companies just need a good push to only use those 
ingredients.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>While most chlorine plants around the world have switched to newer, cleaner 
technologies, many still rely on the use of mercury cells. In 2005, 90 percent 
of chlorine production was mercury-free, but just 40 percent of European 
production was mercury-free. Four U.S. chlor-alkali plants still rely on 
mercury cell technology. In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama introduced 
legislation to force the remaining chlor-alkali plants to phase out mercury 
cell technology by 2012.</p>

<h3> The Dirty&nbsp;Dozen December 11, 2008</h3>  Filed under: food, green, 
health &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 5:43 pm <br>
 Tags: artificial colors, artificial 
sweeteners, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, hydrolyzed soy protein,
milk, pork, raw milk, shellfish, soft drinks, white flour, white sugar <br>

<p>Jordan Rubin, author of&nbsp; &ldquo;Perfect Weight America&rdquo; lists 
the &ldquo;Dirty Dozen&rdquo; food items that we all should avoid for better 
health. He concedes that some might be controversial. While I have eliminated 
most of the foods on his list, there are some that surprised me, like skim milk.
</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>All Pork Products</strong> &ndash; Pigs are omnivores, which means 
that they consume both plants and animals. Pigs will scavenge and have been 
known to eat any kind of food, including dead insects, worms, tree bark, 
rotting carcasses, garbage, and even other pigs. Pigs harbor a range ofparasites
 and diseases that can be transmitted to humans. These include trichinosis,<em>
Taenia solium</em>, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host 
large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract.&nbsp; 
The presence of these diseases and parasites is one of the reasons why pork 
meat should always be well cooked or cured before eating. Religious groups that 
consider pork unclean refer to these issues as support for their views. Another 
reason not to eat pork is that factory hog farms are some of the worst 
polluters in America&rsquo;s history. SeeBoss Hog. While I&rsquo;m not a 
vegetarian, I&rsquo;ll think twice before buying any more pork.</li> 
<li><strong>Shellfish and crustaceans</strong> &ndash; Lobsters, crabs, 
shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, crayfish and scallops are bottom scavengers or 
filter feeders. When I lived in Oregon, we would go upriver to swim and catch 
crayfish. I never thought much about what crayfish eat until my sister&rsquo;s 
dog pooped in the water. The crayfish went crazy, coming out of their hiding 
places from all over, to devour the tasty goodness. No more crayfish for me, 
thanks. Even though I love shrimp, I don&rsquo;t eat much of it after 
researchingPoison Shrimp&nbsp;Cocktail. And oysters, clams or mussels in 
Arizona? Not so much.</li> 
<li><strong>Processed meats and hydrolyzed soy protein</strong> &ndash; 
Processed meats contain nitrates for flavor, color and as a preservative. Steer 
clear of breakfast links, hot dogs, Salisbury steaks, bologna, sausages, 
salami, and lunch meats of all kinds. Nitrates can turn into nitrites which 
have been found to cause cancer and tumors in test animals. Hydrolyzed soy 
protein usually contains a significant amount of genetically modified soy. 
According to theFDA, hydrolyzed protein is used to enhance flavor and contains 
monosodium glutamate. When added this way, the labels are not required to list 
MSG as an ingredient. Yum.</li> 
<li><strong>White flour</strong> &ndash; White flour is white because the 
wheat has been stripped of the wheat germ, bran, and half of the healthy fatty 
acids and then bleached. Enriched white flour just means that a few isolated 
and synthetic vitamins and minerals have been added back into the flour. Look 
for whole-grain breads or flour as a healthy alternative.</li> 
<li><strong>Hydrogenated oils</strong> &ndash; During the hydrogenation 
process, hydrogen gas in injected into oil under high pressure to make the oil 
solid at room temperature and prevent the oil from becoming rancid too quickly. 
The process produces trans fats. The consumption of trans fats increases 
one&rsquo;s risk ofcoronary heart disease by raising levels of 
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of &ldquo;good&rdquo; HDL 
cholesterol. Health authorities recommend that consumption of trans fat be 
reduced to trace amounts. If the ingredient list contains the words 
&ldquo;shortening&rdquo;, &ldquo;partially hydrogenated vegetable oil&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;hydrogenated vegetable oil&rdquo;, then the food contains trans fat. 
Even if the label says &ldquo;zero trans fat&rdquo;, the FDA allows 
manufacturers to have less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving and still 
legally use the term &ldquo;zero trans fat&rdquo;. So much for truth in 
labeling.</li> 
<li><strong>Pasteurized, homogenized skim milk</strong> &ndash; This one 
surprised me. Instead of skim milk, Mr. Rubin recommends unpasteurized milk 
from grass-fed animals instead of homogenized, pasteurized milk. Since raw milk 
has risks based on the sanitary practices of the farm where it is produced, the 
next best thing is cultured or fermented dairy whole-milk products, such as 
yogurt and kefir. I&rsquo;ve often wondered why humans are the only species 
that drink the milk of another animal. That being said, I still have a nonfat 
latte every morning and love my cheese.</li> 
<li><strong>White sugar</strong> &ndash; Sugar&ndash;including sucrose, corn 
sweeteners, honey, and molasses&ndash;is, in a sense, the number-one food 
additive. The average American eats up to three pounds of sugar every week. Of 
course, few people actually go through that much actual table sugar, but it is 
found in almost all of the processed foods we eat. It turns up in some unlikely 
places, such as pizza, bread, hot dogs, boxed rice mixes, soup, crackers, 
spaghetti sauce, lunch meat, canned vegetables, fruit drinks, flavored yogurt, 
ketchup, salad dressing, mayonnaise, and some peanut butter. Carbonated soft 
drinks are the worst offenders in the American diet.</li> 
<li><strong>Soft drinks</strong> &ndash; Soft drink are empty calories with 
little or no nutritional value, considering most are made with high-fructose 
corn syrup. If you drink one can of soda per day, you will consume 55,000 extra 
calories in one year, or 15 pounds of weight gain. I find soft drinks too sweet 
for my taste. I&rsquo;d rather drink water.</li> 
<li><strong>High-fructose corn syrup</strong> &ndash; Manufacturers use HFCS 
because it&rsquo;s cheap. You&rsquo;ll find it in soda, fruit juice, baked 
goods, canned fruits, dairy products, cooks, gum, jam, jellies, 
pickles&hellip;you get the picture. The problem with HFCS is that the body 
handles fructose differently than all other sugars. Fructose does not stimulate 
leptin, the hormone that tell you &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full&rdquo;. In fat, it 
reduces ghrelin hormone levels, which tell you &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still 
hungry&rdquo;. Fructose propels the liver into fat-promoting mode by activating 
the formation of enymes that lead to elevated levels of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; 
cholesterol and triglycerides.</li> 
<li><strong>Artificial sweeteners</strong> &ndash; As many as 194 million 
Americans regularly eat and drink sugar-free products. Whether or not 
artificial sweeteners are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for our health, why consume an 
artificial product when a natural one if available? Plus, if they worked, why 
are so many Americans fat? I weaned myself from my Diet Mountain Dew habit over 
a year ago and feel much better as a result.</li> 
<li><strong>Artificial flavors and artificial colors</strong> &ndash; Food 
additives have been linked to behavioral problems in children. They have also 
been associated with allergies and skin rashes. I dislike most prepared foods 
and normally shop the perimeter of the grocery store. I&rsquo;d rather eat my 
own cooking.</li> 
<li><strong>Beer, wine and alcoholic drinks</strong> &ndash; This one pains me 
since I do like my glass of wine in the evening. However, his book was written 
for folks who are trying to lose weight and alcohol in all its forms is highly 
caloric. Of course there&rsquo;s the problems associated with excessive 
drinking.</li> </ol> 
<p>All in all, I follow most of Mr. Rubin&rsquo;s recommendations. Combine 
that with daily exercise and I weigh within two pounds of my weight in high 
school. Never felt better.<br>

<h3> High Fructose Corn Syrup is&nbsp;Natural July 16, 2008</h3>  Filed under: 
business, food, green, health &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 8:36 am <br>
 Tags: calories,
Corn Refiners Association, diet, fat, HFCS, high fructose corn syrup, obesity, 
processed foods, sugar, sweeteners, USDA, weight, weight loss <br>

<p>The Corn Refiners Association welcomed clarification from the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration concerning the use of the term<strong>natural</strong> for 
products containing High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS).</p> 
<p>You bet they do. They can hardly wait to slap &ldquo;made with natural 
ingredients&rdquo; on products made with HFCS. This is big business and 
there&rsquo;s money to be made.</p> 
<p>High Fructose Corn Syrup is used to sweeten lots of foods:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Regular soft drinks</li> 
<li>Fruit drinks, such as fruitades and fruit punch</li> 
<li>Candy and gum</li> 
<li>Grain products, such as cakes, cookies,&nbsp;crackers, pies, and sweet 
rolls</li> 
<li>Cereals</li> 
<li>Canned fruits</li> 
<li>Milk-based desserts and products,&nbsp;such as ice cream, sweetened yogurt 
and sweetened milk</li> 
<li>Jams,&nbsp;jellies, and peanut butter</li> 
<li>Condiments, such as ketchup, mayonnaise, salad dressings (particularly 
low-fat)</li> </ul> 
<p>So, how does this affect the number of calories we consume?</p> 
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends 1800 calories 
per day for females age 31-50 and 2200 calories for males the same 
age.&nbsp;Compared to current recommendations issued in 2005, we were already 
consuming more than enough calories in 1961 according to the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.</p> <strong>USDA 2005 
Daily Calorie Recommendation</strong> <strong>1961 FAO</strong> <strong>2003 FAO
</strong> <br>
1800 females / 2200 males 2882.5 3753.74 <br>
<br>

<p>As our collective waistlines grew, we were exhorted to eat less red meat, 
switch to margarine, and eat fewer eggs as if they were the sole culprits in 
our battle of the bulge.&nbsp;Compared to 1961, we&rsquo;ve done just that. 
We&rsquo;re even eating more fish and vegetables. So where are the extra 871.24 
calories coming from?</p> <strong>Calories per Day from</strong> <strong>1961
</strong> <strong>2003</strong> <br>
Butter 65 40 <br>
Eggs 67 56 <br>
Red Meat 
140 119 <br>
Poultry 64 197 <br>
Fish 20 28 <br>
Vegetables 64 78 <br>
<br>

<p>In the same time period, the&nbsp;increases in&nbsp;sugar &amp; sweeteners, 
vegetable oils, and cereal grains are dramatic. These three categories alone 
account for a 685.31 calorie increase.&nbsp;Why? Simple. These are the main 
ingredients of packaged, processed foods in America.</p> <strong>Calories per 
Day from</strong> <strong>1961</strong> <strong>2003</strong> <br>
Sugar &amp; 
Sweeteners 515.75 657.03 <br>
Vegetable Oils 267.5 606.46 <br>
Cereal Grains 
627.32 832.39 <br>
<br>

<p>High fructose corn syrup may&nbsp;be getting a pass these days&nbsp;in the 
press. &ldquo;A number of recent studies . . . have convinced me that HFCS does 
not affect weight gain,&rdquo; says Barry Popkin of the University of North 
Carolina, who was an early proponent of the HFCS-obesity hypothesis.<strong>
Sure. Maybe if it wasn&rsquo;t in every food item you buy!</strong> Not just 
items where you know you&rsquo;re buying a fix for your sweet tooth like candy, 
ice cream,&nbsp;snack cakes or fruit pies. No, it&rsquo;s in spaghetti sauce, 
cereal, ketchup, and salad dressings too. If it&rsquo;s sweet, it sells.</p> 
<p>The next time you go to the grocers, look at the list of ingredients.</p> 
<p>These are all sugar. Sugar, invert sugar, sucrose, balactose, dextrose, 
fructose, maltose, lactose,&nbsp;glucose, (any ingredient ending in&nbsp;-ose), 
corn sweetener, corn syrup, glycogen, mannitol, sorbitol, monosaccharides, 
polysaccharides, honey, molasses, malt syrup, maple syrup, maple sugar, date 
sugar, brown sugar, fruit juice concentrates, raw sugar,&nbsp;turbinado sugar 
and,&nbsp;of course,&nbsp;our newly &ldquo;natural&rdquo; friend, high fructose 
corn syrup. You cannot add sugar in one form or another to every food product 
in the market and then decry the&nbsp;obesity epidemic. I&nbsp;run 6 miles at 
least 4 times a week and still must avoid processed foods to keep my weight in 
check. What about the average person with a desk job?</p> 
<p>Avoiding added sugars, including high fructose corn syrup,&nbsp;cuts out 
about a ba-zillion prepared foods which is okay with me. I love to cook and 
pretty much anything that isn&rsquo;t homemade is either tasteless crap or too 
sweet. And as long as my knees hold up, I&rsquo;ll keep running.</p>
