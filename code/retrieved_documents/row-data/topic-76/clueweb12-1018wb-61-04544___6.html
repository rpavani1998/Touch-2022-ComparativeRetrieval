<p><strong>By&nbsp;Stacey Colino</strong><br>
<strong>From Live Right Live Well
</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Agave syrup, stevia, honey and other natural sweeteners are all the rage 
these days, as more people worry that white sugar and high-fructose corn syrup 
are making them gain weight and increasing their risk for type 2 diabetes. But 
are natural sweeteners really any better than plain baking sugar?</p> 
<p>A reality check: For the most part, your body can't tell the difference 
between one type of sweetener and another. And most sweeteners contain similar 
amounts of calories: approximately 16 per teaspoon.</p> 
<p>&quot;Added sugar, no matter where it comes from, is added sugar -- and in 
excessive amounts, it could increase body fat,&quot; says registered dietitian 
Lona Sandon, an assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center. &quot;No matter what your sweetener comes 
from, you need to stick with it in moderation and not overdo it.&quot;</p> 
<p>But different sweeteners do have different properties when it comes to 
cooking and health. When researchers at Virginia Tech compared the antioxidant 
content of various sweeteners, they found considerable variability:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Most antioxidants: Dark and blackstrap molasses</li> 
<li>Some antioxidants: Maple syrup, brown sugar, honey</li> 
<li>Minimal antioxidants: Refined sugar, corn syrup, agave nectar</li> </ul> 
<p>Here's a guide to how sweeteners otherwise stack up, along with directions 
for best using each one:</p> 
<p><strong>Agave Syrup</strong><br>
<br>
Agave syrup is a natural sweetener 
made from the sap of the agave plant. It contains the same calories as white 
sugar, but it's considerably sweeter -- so you don't need to use as much. If a 
recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar, you'd use only 1/3 cup of agave, says 
registered dietitian Angela Ginn, a Baltimore-based spokeswoman for the 
American Dietetic Association.</p> 
<p>Also, agave syrup is low on the glycemic index, meaning it doesn't raise 
blood sugar quickly. But &quot;because it has a higher percentage of fructose 
than what's in high-fructose corn syrup, it may raise triglyceride levels in 
your blood, according to studies done at UT Southwestern,&quot; warns Sandon.
<br><br>
<br>
<strong>Stevia</strong><br>
<br>
This sweetener is derived from 
the leaves of the stevia plant and contains almost no calories -- yet it can be 
used cup-for-cup as a replacement for sugar, says Ginn.</p> 
<p>&quot;You can use it for baking, but it's not very sweet and it may make a 
cake more dense,&quot; says Ginn. You can also sprinkle it in your coffee or on 
berries or oatmeal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Honey</strong><br>
<br>
In addition 
to antioxidants, honey also has some antibacterial properties.</p> 
<p>&quot;Honey is ideal for beverages because it's easily absorbed,&quot; says 
Ginn. &quot;And it's great for mixing in yogurt, drizzling on chicken or using 
in salad dressings.&quot;</p> 
<p>However, because of its consistency, it's &quot;not as good for 
baking,&quot; she says.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Maple Syrup</strong><br>
<br>

Genuine maple syrup is very sweet and has a slightly woodsy flavor, says Ginn, 
&quot;so a little goes a long way.&quot;</p> 
<p>Besides its typical use on pancakes, waffles or French toast, maple syrup 
also works as a glaze on root vegetables, like sweet potatoes, acorn or 
butternut squash, turnips and carrots.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Molasses</strong>
<br><br>
Molasses is derived from sugar cane or sugar beets. It contains more 
antioxidants than all other natural sweeteners, and it also contains a small 
amount of iron, says Sandon.</p> 
<p>Because it lends foods a rich, dark flavor as well as a touch of sweetness, 
it's a good choice for baking spice cakes, gingerbread or ginger snaps.<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Brown Sugar</strong><br>
<br>
Made from molasses and white sugar, 
light brown sugar is best for baking (cakes, cookies, pies and sweet breads) or 
sprinkling on oatmeal.</p> 
<p>The dark brown variety, in contrast, gives foods (like baked beans, stews 
and gingerbread) a richer flavor, thanks to the extra molasses it contains, 
says Ginn.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Raw Sugar</strong><br>
<br>
Raw sugar comes 
from sugar cane, just like white sugar, but it's less refined, so it's coarser 
in texture and has a golden color (from the molasses it retains). But it isn't 
any healthier than the white stuff.</p> 
<p>Often used in tea and other beverages or as a topping on baked goods, raw 
sugar can be sweeter than white sugar -- so you'll need less to achieve the 
desired sweetness, says Ginn.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>White Sugar</strong><br>

<br>It may not be as trendy as other natural sweeteners, but white sugar 
&quot;holds up better than the others in high heat,&quot; says Sandon. It also 
&quot;gives a better texture to baked goods because of how it absorbs water and 
adds volume to whatever you're preparing.&quot;</p> 
<p>So there you have it: The whole sugary story so you can make wiser choices 
to satisfy your sweet tooth.<br>
