<h1>Sweeteners</h1>

Sugar is a carbohydrate created naturally in fruits and 
vegetables, or by honey bees. Sweetening and flavor are its obvious functions, 
but it also plays a number of roles in baking. It comes in either&nbsp;<strong>
DRY</strong>, such as granulated white or powdered sugar or brown; <strong>
LIQUID</strong>, such as honey or molasses; or, <strong>ARTIFICIAL FORMS
</strong>, and there are many types.</p> 
<p><strong>SARAH SAYS:</strong> If you want to substitute one sugar for 
another, the rule of thumb is to use dry sugar for dry sugar and liquid sugar 
for liquid sugar. You can't exchange a dry one for a liquid one and vice versa 
without wrecking havoc, even if a substitution chart shows you otherwise. Also, 
each dry or liquid sugar has its own attribute, so when you substitute it, 
expect changes in the outcome.<br>
<strong><br>
Sugar History: Where did sugar 
first come from?<br>
</strong>Around 20,000 BC, people in the islands of the 
South Pacific were the first to find the sugar in sugar cane that grew 
naturally in their area. However, India was the first country to extract 
natural cane juice to make the first crude sugar, which they called 
&quot;gur&quot; (loosely translated as &quot;tasting sweet&quot;) in 500 BC. 
From India, the knowledge of making sugar spread westward into the middle east 
and then to Europe by the Crusaders.</p> 
<p>For hundreds of years, sugar was a highly prized and expensive 
&quot;spice&quot; that was used only in the homes of nobility and royalty. 
Christopher Columbus took sugar cane to plant in the Caribbean, leading to the 
production of sugar in the New World.</p> 
<p>In the mid-1700's, a German scientist developed an alternative to sugar 
cane through the use of sugar beets. Since then, sugar beets are also grown and 
processed to produce sugar. There is no difference in the sugar produced from 
either cane or beet.</p> 
<p>Today, sugar is derived from sugar beets or sugar cane that are crushed and 
dissolved in water. The raw syrup is boiled down to concentrate it to a point 
where some fraction crystallizes. The remaining heavy syrup (see 
&quot;molasses&quot;) is separated from the 95+% pure sugar. The crystals are 
further processed several times to increase its purity yielding, eventually, 
the pure white crystals we commonly use. Some other commonly used sugars are 
also produced during the processing.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
In addition to beet and cane sugars, there are other types of 
sugar used in baking that come from different sources. After processing, the 
beet and cane sugars are chemically the same. <br>
<strong>SOURCES</strong> 
<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong> <br>
Beet Sugar A variety of garden beet 
extensively cultivated for the sugar which can be extracted from the roots. <br>
Sugar Cane 
<p>A tall grass whose sap yields sugar. Perhaps the oldest source of sugar 
known.</p> <br>
Fruit Sugars Sugar from grapes and other fruit with a high 
sugar content. <br>
Honey Sugar harvested from bees. <br>
Milk Sugar Fine white 
powder much less sweet than cane sugar, made from milk extract. <br>
Refined 
Sugar White crystals of either sugar beet or sugar cane. <br>
Sugar Maple A 
North American tree from whose sap maple sugar is made. <br>
Turbinado OR Date 
Sugar OR Sucanat Sugar from the sap of the date palm. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

Monosaccharides: (single sugar molecules) 
<ul> 
<li>Glucose / Grapes, various fruits. Much less sweet than cane sugar.</li> 
<li>Fructose / Fruit, honey. Fructose = granulated fructose = fruit sugar = 
levulose (fruit sugar)</li> 
<li>Galactose / Milk</li> </ul> <br>
Disaccharides: (each molecule is made of 
two single sugar molecules) 
<ul> 
<li>Sucrose (glucose + fructose) = sugar / The technical name for sugar. A 
sweetener which is extracted from plants, such as beet or cane, producing 
natural sugar.</li> 
<li>Lactose (glucose + galactose) / Milk extract. Fine white powder much less 
sweet than cane sugar.</li> 
<li>Maltose (glucose + glucose) / Bee. A sugar produced by the action of malt 
on starch.</li> </ul> <br>
How do fructose (one of the sugars found in fruit), 
lactose (a sugar found in milk) and sucrose (commonly table sugar) compare in 
sweetness? Fructose&nbsp; ====&gt;&nbsp; Sucrose ====&gt;&nbsp; Lactose<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Here are some questions that I am frequently asked about sugar. The answers 
may surprise you:<br>
Is the sugar in fruit better for you than table sugar?<br>
Sugar is a natural product. The sugar in your sugar bowl is the same substance 
(sucrose) found naturally in sugar cane, sugar beets, apples, oranges, carrots 
and every other fruit and vegetable we eat. The body uses sugar from sugar cane 
and sugar beets in the same way as the sugars in fruit and vegetables. The 
sugars found in all carbohydrate foods all become glucose, fuel for the 
body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
How does refined sugar compare to the sugar in 
fruit?<br>
From a nutritional point of view, it doesn't matter what foods 
provide the sugars in our diet. Once digested, all sugars are put to the same 
good uses. All fruit and vegetables contain some sucrose along with other 
sugars, like fructose and glucose, in addition to fiber and a variety of 
vitamins and minerals. Most of the sugar added to foods is enjoyed as a part of 
foods from all four food groups, giving us both good nutrition and good 
taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Is it better for you to eat honey instead of 
sugar?<br>
Honey, brown sugar, white sugar and maple syrup all have similar 
nutritional values. They all provide carbohydrate and energy, but insignificant 
amounts of vitamins and minerals. Sugar and other carbohydrate sweeteners play 
an important role in making other foods taste better, and, through their many 
uses in cooking, increasing the variety of foods available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Is sugar bleached to make it white?<br>
No. There is no 
bleaching agent added at any time during the refining process. Pure sucrose 
crystals are naturally white.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>SARAH SAYS: When making lemon curd, sugar raises the coagulation point of 
the egg yolk. It also protects it from premature coagulation during the 
addition of the lemon juice. If the juice were added directly to the 
unprotected yolk, the yolk would partially coagulate and, when strained, a 
large percentage of it would be left behind in the strainer. Be sure to mix the 
sugar well with the egg yolks before adding the juice.</p> <br>
