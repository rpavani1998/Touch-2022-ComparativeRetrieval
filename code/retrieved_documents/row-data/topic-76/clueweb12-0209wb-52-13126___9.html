<h1>Low-carb diet: Can it help you lose weight?</h1> 
<h2>Could a low-carb diet give you an edge in losing weight? Help you keep 
weight off permanently? Here's what you need to know about the low-carb diet.
</h2> By Mayo Clinic staff 
<h2>Definition</h2> 
<p> A low-carb diet limits carbohydrates &mdash; such as grains, starchy 
vegetables and fruit &mdash; and emphasizes dietary protein and fat. Many types 
of low-carb diets exist, each with varying restrictions on the types and 
amounts of carbohydrates you can eat.</p> 
<h2>Purpose</h2> 
<p> A low-carb diet is generally used to lose weight. Some low-carb diets say 
that they have health benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing risk 
factors associated with heart disease, certain cancers, diabetes and metabolic 
syndrome.</p> 
<p> <strong>Why you might follow a low-carb diet<br>
</strong>You might choose 
to follow a low-carb diet because you:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Want to change your overall eating habits</li> 
<li>Enjoy the types and amounts of foods featured in low-carb diets</li> 
<li>Want a diet that restricts certain carbs to help you lose weight</li> </ul>
<p> Check with your doctor or health care provider before starting any 
weight-loss diet, especially if you have any health conditions, including 
diabetes.</p> 
<h2>Diet details</h2> 
<p> As the name says, a low-carb diet restricts the amount of carbohydrates 
you can eat. Carbohydrates are a type of macronutrient found in many foods and 
beverages. Most carbohydrates occur naturally in plant-based foods, such as 
grains. Food manufacturers also add carbohydrates to processed foods in the 
form of starch or added sugar.</p> 
<p> Common food sources of naturally occurring carbohydrates include: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fruits</li> 
<li>Vegetables</li> 
<li>Milk</li> 
<li>Nuts</li> 
<li>Grains</li> 
<li>Seeds</li> 
<li>Legumes</li> </ul> 
<p> Your body uses carbohydrates as its main fuel source. Sugars and starches 
are broken down into simple sugars during digestion. They're then absorbed into 
your bloodstream, where they're known as blood sugar (glucose). From there, the 
glucose enters your body's cells with the help of insulin. Some of this glucose 
is used by your body for energy, fueling all of your activities, whether it's 
going for a jog or simply breathing. Extra glucose is stored in your liver, 
muscles and other cells for later use or is converted to fat.</p> 
<p> The theory behind the low-carb diet is that insulin prevents fat breakdown 
in the body by allowing sugar to be used for energy. Proponents of the low-carb 
diet believe that decreasing carbs results in lower insulin levels, which 
causes the body to burn stored fat for energy and ultimately helps you shed 
excess weight and reduce risk factors for a variety of health conditions.</p> 
<p> <strong>Typical menu for a low-carb diet<br>
</strong>In general, a 
low-carb diet focuses on proteins, including meat, poultry, fish and eggs, and 
some nonstarchy vegetables. A low-carb diet generally excludes or limits most 
grains, beans, fruits, breads, sweets, pastas and starchy vegetables, and 
sometimes nuts and seeds. Some low-carb diet plans allow certain fruits, 
vegetables and whole grains. A daily limit of 50 to 150 grams of carbohydrates 
is typical with a low-carb diet. Some low-carb diets greatly restrict carbs 
during the initial phase of the diet and then gradually increase the number of 
allowed carbs.</p> 
<p> In contrast, the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that 
carbohydrates make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calorie intake. So, 
if you consume 2,000 calories a day, you would need to eat between 900 and 
1,300 calories a day from carbohydrates, or between 225 and 325 grams of 
carbohydrates a day.</p> Next page<br>
