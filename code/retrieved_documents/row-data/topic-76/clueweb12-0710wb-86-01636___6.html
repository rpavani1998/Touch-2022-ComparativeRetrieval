<p>If you're trying to lose a few pounds, trading your regular soda for the 
diet version could be doing more harm than good. True, swapping a can of Coke 
Zero for the regular kind slices 139 calories from your daily intake, but 
research from the University of Liverpool in England suggests thatyour body 
processes artificial, calorie-free sweeteners the same way it does regular sugar
.<br>
</p> 
<p> Just as your taste buds can't differentiate between regular and artificial 
sweeteners (aside that chemically aftertaste), the receptors in your intestines 
aren't able to tell the difference either. Once the intestines sense sweetness, 
they seek out glucose to absorb. So even though that Equal is calorie-free -- 
your body may still take calories from somewhere else if these receptors are 
activated.</p> 
<p> <br>
&quot;Artificial sweeteners can also activate the glucose sensor and 
increase the capacity of the intestine to absorb more sugar,&quot; Soraya 
Shirazi-Beechey, lead author of the study and a professor of Molecular 
Physiology and Biochemistry at Liverpool University, tells the Daily Mail. 
&quot;If someone wants to lose weight, I don't think artificial sweeteners are 
going to help,&quot; she says. &quot;My recommendation is to eat natural foods, 
but to eat less of them.&quot;<br>
</p> 
<p>It's unclear from Shirazi-Beechey's research whether the amount of glucose 
absorbed after sensing an artificial sweetener would equal the 
calorie-equivalent of a regular soda.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Although this research is preliminary, it is part of a growing body of 
evidence that sweeteners are not a fool-proof alternative to regular sugar. 
Other studies have found that sweetenersdon't satisfy the cravings in the brain 
the way real sugar does, meaning that after that diet soda you may still be 
craving something sweet.</p> 
<p>But for soda addicts in particular, the switch to diet may cut significant 
calories and be a good stepping stone to healthier beverages, such as water and 
occasional fruit juices.<br>
</p> 
<p>In fact, the jury is still out on artificial sweeteners, as a recent study 
found theymay help prevent weight gain. So while science continues to debate, 
cut back on sugar and sweeteners all together -- everything in moderation is 
the real key to weight loss.<br>

<h4>u262f 9-04-2009 @ 6:38PM</h4> 
<p>I completely agree with the last sentence. The &quot;real sugar&quot; 
(which sugar proponents seem to call refined white sugar) vs. sweeteners debate 
is merely a distraction from the fact that both are bad for you. What we seem 
to be finding is that refining and concentrating things is bad. We are 
biological creatures, and we exist only in a very fragile, limited, messy 
balance of many factors. When we strip one thing out of its setting and 
concentrate it heavily (like extracting sugar crystals from the cane or beet or 
fruit or corn or anything else), we're making it much harder to maintain that 
healthy balance. This is why eating natural foods that hasn't been processed 
very much tends to work. When the sugars are inside the cane (or beat or corn 
or fruit), they come balanced with vitamins, fiber, water, and other nutrients, 
many of which we probably don't understand or haven't &quot;discovered&quot; 
yet.<br>

<p>Fairly accurate summary</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<h4>syam 9-05-2009 @ 10:44AM</h4> 
<p>agree on this article. we should take Artificial Sweeteners as a sugar's 
substitute.</p>

<h4>deadharbor 9-06-2009 @ 10:37AM</h4> 
<p>There are no free stuff in this world. All I know is that why I overdid 
artificial sweeteners, my diet was a mess and my weight kept going up. Now I 
eat better.</p> 
<p>reply</p> <br>

<h4>thirdpartyvote 9-07-2009 @ 9:33PM</h4> 
<p>I don't use artificial sweetener. I use a little bit of sugar...not much.. 
I am 56, weigh 126, have 22% body fat, exercise five times a week.. I eat brown 
rice toast with a tsp of butter and 1/2 tsp sugar for breakfast, usually 
another slice of toast with tofu salad for lunch, a salad and canned wild 
salmon for dinner (or if my friends drag me to a restaurant, I'll have 
chicken). I eat dark chocolate, coffee, green tea, dark chocolate sorbet, 
sometimes, but rarely a cookie. Sugar does not cause so much weight gain. It is 
that High Fructose Corn Syrup, aka HFCS, aka &quot;invert sugar&quot; that has 
been hiding in all our foods (jus about all breads, including all the healthy 
brands). That stuff was forced on Americans in 1985 due to corporate pressure. 
It makes the appetite rage. Don't eat HFCS.</p>

<p>My husband is a (non-insulin dependent) diabetic and has been using Splenda 
for years with great success. I have finally given up eating or drinking 
anything with cane sugar in it, and while my weight still requires watching, I 
feel better! (Less sluggish, more alert, and this may sound weird, but I feel 
cleaner!) Splenda took me about 5 minutes to adjust to and I haven't looked 
back. My new treat is FUZE fruit beverages. Low carb and only 5-40 calories 
(depending on flavor) per serving! All I need to find now is a healthy, low cal 
crunchy snack that tastes just like Lay's Potato Chips and I'll be in heaven!

The big question is who is funding the &quot;Scientific 
Research&quot;.<br>
<br>
Follow the money.......</p>

<p>Took me a minute to figure out the pattern in the picture of the sweetener 
packets. They're arranged in groups of 8, so that at the center of each group 
of 8 is an octagon--the shape of a stop sign.</p>

<p>Artificial sweeteners are toxic. If I ingest any of them by accident, 
within about an hour, I am dizzy, off-balance, fuzzy-headed and sometimes get a 
headache. I will actually feel as if I'm on roller skates. They go directly 
into my inner ear and wreak havoc. Stay away from them, folks!<br>
<br>
Here's 
a little story. I drank a soft drink from a fountain at a convenience story 
recently, and soon was experiencing these symptoms. I called the store and 
asked them to check their fountain and told them I had reason to believe they 
had hooked up a diet drink to the regular spout. Sure enough, the clerk came 
back to the phone and said I was right, that they had accidentally hooked up 
the diet stuff to the regular dispenser.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps even one 
person find out why they are experiencing dizzy spells. It took me YEARS to 
figure out the connection. We need to get the word out to people what 
artificial sweeteners can do.</p>
