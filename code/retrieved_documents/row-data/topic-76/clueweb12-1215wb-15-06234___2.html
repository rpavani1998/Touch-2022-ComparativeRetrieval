<h1>Mini-Pledge Week 12: No Sweeteners</h1>  By 100 Days of Real Food, on May 
27th, 2011 <br>

<p>Knowing our society&rsquo;s obsession with all things sweet I have a 
feeling this could be the most difficult&ldquo;real food&rdquo; mini-pledge 
yet. But don&rsquo;t feel discouraged because even if you only join us for a 
day or two, I promise it will still be an eye-opening experience proving just 
how sugar-obsessed our society really is. And I am not just referring to white 
sugar and otherrefined sweeteners, which we already tackled a few weeks ago. I 
am talking about all added sweeteners even including honey and maple syrup. As 
I&rsquo;ve said a thousand times before, no matter what sweetener you chose 
(natural, organic, raw, etc.)&hellip;a sugar is a sugar and it should always be 
used in moderation. So what better way to learn how to reduce your consumption 
of sweeteners than to completely live without them for a few days? And if you 
think this challenge sounds like a daunting task then right there is my proof 
that we really are sweetener-obsessed after all.</p> 
<p>So here is next week&rsquo;s mini-pledge, which starts on Monday:</p> 
<p><strong>Mini-Pledge Week 12: May 30 &ndash; June 5</strong> &ndash; Avoid 
all added sweeteners including, but not limited to: white sugar, brown sugar, 
raw sugar, honey, maple syrup, date sugar, maple sugar, sucanat, splenda, 
stevia, agave, fruit juice concentrate, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, 
brown rice syrup, and cane juice.</p> 
<p>It blows my mind looking through cookbooks when I see recipe after recipe 
for things like pancakes, soups, and sauces that call for a tablespoon or even 
a teaspoon of sugar&hellip;is such a small quantity even necessary? And then at 
the grocery store they sell product after product, even savory items like bread 
and crackers, that can&rsquo;t make it on the shelves without being sweetened. 
And I admit I am just as guilty as the next person with my big ol&rsquo; sweet 
tooth, although my taste buds have definitely changed &ndash; for the better 
&ndash; since taking our100 Days of Real Food pledge. Abstaining from highly 
processed junk really gaveour palates an adjustment and now just a little bit 
of sweetness seems to go a long way.</p> 
<p>Aside from preferring the added flavor of sweeteners I think we might have 
a mental obsession with it as well. How many times have you sprinkled a little 
sugar onto your dish or into a recipe without even trying it first? Just the 
other day I decided to put this little philosophy to the test. Whenever I fix 
my girls oatmeal I always drizzle a little honey on it before adding the 
cinnamon and raisins, yet I admit I&rsquo;ve never even tried serving it 
without any honey at all. So after a little mental struggle on if I should or 
shouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;roll the dice&rdquo; by leaving out the sweetener all 
together I decided to add extra cinnamon just in case it could help make up for 
the loss of honey. And what do you know&hellip;my 4-year-old gobbled it down 
like it was the same bowl of oatmeal I&rsquo;ve been fixing her for years. I 
was honestly a little surprised, but of course pleased!</p> 
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said for every mini-pledge it is up to you if you want to 
join our weekly challenge and it&rsquo;s also of course your decision if you 
want to sign up for the entire week or just for a day or two. This is the 
perfect pledge to try on a smaller scale because I would much rather everyone 
give this a chance rather than not do it at all. And following are some 
resources and meal ideas to help you along the way!</p>

<p>Why, oh why does this have to begin on Memorial Day? I&rsquo;ve done a 
great job in cutting white sugar and artificial sweeteners from my diet. This 
is going to be hard, but I&rsquo;m willing to give it a shot!</p> </li>

time and see how it goes. Enjoy your holiday weekend!</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m in! Honestly I pretty much do this a lot of the time anyway. I 
just don&rsquo;t add sweeteners to most things, at least for myself. I make my 
husband&rsquo;s tea with sugar and of course when I make him desserts. I make a 
chicken recipe that uses brown sugar, but I&rsquo;ll just skip that one this 
week. I enjoy a brownie or a cupcake once in a while, but I hardly ever have 
those things on hand! I never understood why some people take strawberries and 
dip them in sugar; strawberries are incredibly sweet to me just naturally!</p>

<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll bite!</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t actually consume many added sugars &mdash; and most would be 
very easy for me to cut out, as they&rsquo;re generally just a little added 
treat anyway. The hardest one is probably going to be store-bought bread. 
There&rsquo;s added sugar in just about all of them, even the 
&ldquo;healthiest&rdquo; ones. (Especially the 100% whole wheat breads &mdash; 
they overcome the supposed bitterness of the whole wheat flour with 
sugar&hellip; so annoying.)</p> 
<p>So, does this mean chocolate is completely out? </p> 
<p>(Oh, and I&rsquo;ve got a weekend in Vegas scheduled during this 
time&hellip; I&rsquo;ll do my best, though!)</p> </li>

<p>My family already rarely eats refined sweeteners. We do use honey, agave, 
and pure maple syrup in treats and on our occasional pancake nights. But I am a 
firm believer in cutting out treats most of the time. I personally struggled to 
lose weight after my first baby and believe I eventually got into the best 
shape of my life after baby&rsquo;s 2, 3 and 4 (still on my journey since #4 is 
only 6 months old) by cutting out sugars on a daily basis, period. Only have 
treats once in a while&hellip; And I have never felt or looked better! Our 
society is not only emotionally addicted to sugar, but it is PHYSICALLY 
addicting! So thank you for encouraging people to get their lives in control 
and to stop eating so much sugar&hellip; Refined or not!<br>
 I have a degree 
in health science and am pretty passionate about health. Thanks for helping 
others. My family will be doing this challenge! 5 of us. Baby is too little to 
cut it out of her formula. </p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to join for 2 days. If those go well, I&rsquo;ll try for 
the other 8. I&rsquo;ve cut out most (not all) refined sugars and all refined 
flours. This one will be hard though!!</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give it a shot! I have significantly reduced the amount of 
sweets I eat over the past few months anyway, but am continuously horrified to 
find sugar or corn syrup in all kinds of foods where it doesn&rsquo;t belong. 
This challenge will be a good exercise in reading labels to ferret out more of 
those hidden added sweeteners.</p> 
<p>I just found your blog recently and am loving it. Thanks for the 
inspiration!</p> </li>

<p>We don&rsquo;t add sweeteners to anything but there are some recipes that 
we cook that use them. I&rsquo;m going to take this one day by day (opting out 
for a family birthday later in the week) and see how I do. Are your 
choc./peanutbutter powerballs alright though?</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;ll opt in and take it day-by-day. Just me &ndash; all of us without 
sugar for a week could get very UGLY! I have a feeling I&rsquo;ll be eating a 
lot of naturally sweet fruit to conquer my cravings&hellip;.off to have a 
watermelon smoothie.</p> </li>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll take this one day by day. Cutting out the honey will be 
the most difficult&hellip;..even the great bread I now use from great harvest 
has honey.</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;ll do it for the week. I&rsquo;ve been needing to do this, anyway. 
I don&rsquo;t eat much refined sugar, and don&rsquo;t keep it in my house, but 
I sweeten tea, granola, yogurt, and toast with way too much honey or maple 
syrup, so hopefully a purge will help me cut back in the long run.</p> </li>

<p>Started this one a day early. Found out there is sugar in Lawry&rsquo;s 
seasoned salt, which we use a lot when we grill. It is crazy how much sugar is 
added in food you wouldn&rsquo;t guess.</p> </li>

<p>Starting the day and reading the toothpaste tube (Sorbitol), mouthwash 
(Sorbitol). I could use plain baking soda I suppose. It is amazing where 
sweeteners natural &amp; unnatural are hidden in our lives. I have a very dry 
mouth since I have a partial. My dry mouth gel (Sorbitol). No gum, no mints. I 
caved early in the day when I was so dry I could not stand it anymore.</p> 
<p>This is the first challenge that I am finding almost impossible to do. I am 
looking at every opportunity to achieve the goal like putting lemon or orange 
slices in my ice water, but I am falling short a lot. I am not discouraged 
though. I know this one is very hard and meant to open our eyes to hidden 
things sneaking in to our normal day &amp; our diet.</p> </li>

<p>It has only recently been approved in the U.S. and is still banned in some 
countries. It is a plant that has been around for a long time, but the way it 
is being processed and used (and marketed) is &ldquo;new.&rdquo; Michael Pollan

<p>In the 10 ways to sweeten without sugar, it suggests using applesauce in 
place of sugar, however I know it can also be used in place of oil. So If I was 
substituting 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil in say a fruit bread recipe, 
would that same 1/2 cup also count for replacing 1/2 cup of the sugar as well 
or should I use a full cup of applesauce?</p> </li>

<p>I would like to be part of this March 2 would be my start date (if that is 
possible). I want to lose some weight (go from 210 to 190) by eliminating my 
refined sugar intake and reducing my fruit intake to those with low levels of 
natural sugar eg. berries. I do help a guide for at least moral support to be 
consistent with this .<br>
 All help would be greatly appreciated,<br>

<p>Stevia is an all natural sweetener that comes from a plant and is a great 
alternative! Why would you tell people to not use this? The only type they 
should stay away from is truvia because it is mixed with an artificial 
sweetener.</p> </li> </ul>
