<h1>Natural Sweeteners: Any Better Than White Sugar?</h1> 
<p> </p> 
<p>By Stacey Colino for <em>Live Right Live Well</em></p> 
<p>Agave syrup, stevia, honey and other natural sweeteners are all the rage 
these days, as more people worry that white sugar and high-fructose corn syrup 
are making them gain weight and increasing their risk for type 2 diabetes. But 
are natural sweeteners really any better than plain baking sugar?</p> 
<p>A reality check: For the most part, your body can&rsquo;t tell the 
difference between one type of sweetener and another. And most sweeteners 
contain similar amounts of calories: approximately 16 per teaspoon.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Added sugar, no matter where it comes from, is added sugar -- and in 
excessive amounts, it could increase body fat,&rdquo; says registered dietitian 
Lona Sandon, an assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center. &ldquo;No matter what your sweetener comes 
from, you need to stick with it in moderation and not overdo it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But different sweeteners do have different properties when it comes to 
cooking and health. When researchers at Virginia Tech compared the antioxidant 
content of various sweeteners, they found considerable variability:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Most antioxidants: Dark and blackstrap molasses</li> 
<li>Some antioxidants: Maple syrup, brown sugar, honey</li> 
<li>Minimal antioxidants: Refined sugar, corn syrup, agave nectar</li> </ul> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a guide to how sweeteners otherwise stack up, along with 
directions for best using each one:</p> 
<p><strong>Agave Syrup</strong><br>
Agave syrup is a natural sweetener made 
from the sap of the agave plant. It contains the same calories as white sugar, 
but it&rsquo;s considerably sweeter -- so you don&rsquo;t need to use as much. 
If a recipe calls for 1 cup of sugar, you&rsquo;d use only 1/3 cup of agave, 
says registered dietitian Angela Ginn, a Baltimore-based spokeswoman for the 
American Dietetic Association.</p> 
<p>Also, agave syrup is low on the glycemic index, meaning it doesn&rsquo;t 
raise blood sugar quickly. But &ldquo;because it has a higher percentage of 
fructose than what&rsquo;s in high-fructose corn syrup, it may raise 
triglyceride levels in your blood, according to studies done at UT 
Southwestern,&rdquo; warns Sandon.</p> 
<p><strong>Stevia</strong><br>
This sweetener is derived from the leaves of 
the stevia plant and contains almost no calories -- yet it can be used 
cup-for-cup as a replacement for sugar, says Ginn.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;You can use it for baking, but it&rsquo;s not very sweet and it may 
make a cake more dense,&rdquo; says Ginn. You can also sprinkle it in your 
coffee or on berries or oatmeal.</p> 
<p><strong>Honey</strong><br>
In addition to antioxidants, honey also has some 
antibacterial properties.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Honey is ideal for beverages because it&rsquo;s easily 
absorbed,&rdquo; says Ginn. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s great for mixing in yogurt, 
drizzling on chicken or using in salad dressings.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>However, because of its consistency, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not as good for 
baking,&rdquo; she says.</p> 
<p><strong>Maple Syrup</strong><br>
Genuine maple syrup is very sweet and has 
a slightly woodsy flavor, says Ginn, &ldquo;so a little goes a long way.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Besides its typical use on pancakes, waffles or French toast, maple syrup 
also works as a glaze on root vegetables, like sweet potatoes, acorn or 
butternut squash, turnips and carrots.</p> 
<p><strong>Molasses</strong><br>
Molasses is derived from sugar cane or sugar 
beets. It contains more antioxidants than all other natural sweeteners, and it 
also contains a small amount of iron, says Sandon.</p> 
<p>Because it lends foods a rich, dark flavor as well as a touch of sweetness, 
it&rsquo;s a good choice for baking spice cakes, gingerbread or ginger snaps.
</p> 
<p><strong>Brown Sugar</strong><br>
Made from molasses and white sugar, light 
brown sugar is best for baking (cakes, cookies, pies and sweet breads) or 
sprinkling on oatmeal.</p> 
<p>The dark brown variety, in contrast, gives foods (like baked beans, stews 
and gingerbread) a richer flavor, thanks to the extra molasses it contains, 
says Ginn.</p> 
<p><strong>Raw Sugar</strong><br>
Raw sugar comes from sugar cane, just like 
white sugar, but it&rsquo;s less refined, so it&rsquo;s coarser in texture and 
has a golden color (from the molasses it retains). But it isn&rsquo;t any 
healthier than the white stuff.</p> 
<p>Often used in tea and other beverages or as a topping on baked goods, raw 
sugar can be sweeter than white sugar -- so you&rsquo;ll need less to achieve 
the desired sweetness, says Ginn.</p> 
<p><strong>White Sugar</strong><br>
It may not be as trendy as other natural 
sweeteners, but white sugar &ldquo;holds up better than the others in high 
heat,&rdquo; says Sandon. It also &ldquo;gives a better texture to baked goods 
because of how it absorbs water and adds volume to whatever you&rsquo;re 
preparing.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So there you have it: The whole sugary story so you can make wiser choices 
to satisfy your sweet tooth.</p>
