<h1>The Dish on Sugar &amp; Sweeteners</h1> April 12, 2011 <br>

<p>Low or zero-calorie doesn't always mean zero effects on your waistline.</p> 
<h6><em>(note: I originally published this post last year but somehow the 
formatting got really fouled up in the blog transition so I had to re-publish 
it&hellip; here you go!)</em></h6> 
<p>I get a TON of questions about sugar and sweeteners. Most people just want 
to know which are okay to eat and which are bad. But, of course, I can&rsquo;t 
just say &ldquo;eat this, not that&rdquo; without some kind of explanation 
behind it. In an effort to keep this as short and sweet (pun intended) as 
possible, I&rsquo;m going to boil it down to a few key points</p> 
<p><strong>1. ALL sweeteners, caloric or non-caloric, can contribute to 
weight-gain or prohibit weight loss.<br>
 2. Sweeteners that come from nature 
are always better to consume than those that come from a lab or factory.<br>
 
3. Regardless of the source, it&rsquo;s ALWAYS best to minimize your exposure 
to sweeteners.</strong></p> 
<p>Allow me to explain these points in some further detail.</p> 
<h4><strong>1. ALL sweeteners, caloric or non-caloric, can contribute to 
weight-gain or prohibit weight loss.</strong></h4> 
<p>Contrary to the popular belief that only calories can impact your 
waistline, there is strong evidence to suggest otherwise. Studies have shown 
that any sweet sensation can cause an insulin release in your body. When our 
bodies release insulin, we are in a storage-mode since insulin&rsquo;s job is 
to put nutrients into your cells. Most people who consume artificial sweeteners 
are thinking that they&rsquo;re doing themselves a favor by avoiding calories, 
but what&rsquo;s happening in their bodies is pretty much the opposite of their 
goal.</p> 
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how it goes&hellip;</strong></p> 
<h4><strong></strong><strong>Eat something sweet (regardless of calories) &gt; 
Insulin is released &gt; Body stores nutrients.</strong></h4> 
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but when you were taking in that non-caloric 
sweetener, you were trying to avoid storing anything, right? The point was that 
you were avoiding consuming calories and maybe even trying to lose some body 
fat. Well, here&rsquo;s the newsflash. It&rsquo;s just not going to work.</p> 
<p>Granted, there are some people out there who are not overweight and who 
consume non-caloric/chemical sweeteners. Maybe they&rsquo;re not having the 
same weight loss problems that others are, but they are still going to incur 
negative effects of putting those chemicals into their system.</p> 
<p><strong>But don&rsquo;t take my word for it. </strong><strong>Here are just 
a few of the studies published on the topic of the metabolic effects and 
insulin response resulting from the consumption of artificial sweeteners:
</strong></p> 
<p>A 2008 study in&nbsp;<em>Behavioral Neuroscience </em>&ldquo;A Role for 
Sweet Taste: Calorie Predictive Relations in Energy Regulation&nbsp;by Rats
&rdquo; (PDF)<br>
 Medscape article: &ldquo;Use of Artificial Sweeteners Linked 
to 2-Fold Increase in Diabetes&rdquo;<br>
 Pubmed article: &ldquo;The effect of 
artificial sweetener on insulin secretion. 1. The effect of acesulfame K on 
insulin secretion in the rat (studies in vivo).&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 PSS Episode 21 &ndash; time 34:30&nbsp;(does it halt/stall 
weight loss? yes! )<br>
PSS Episode 15 &ndash; time 23:30&nbsp;(sweeteners in 
tea/coffee)</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Besides negative metabolic effects, artificial sweeteners have been 
identified as the cause of a litany of health problems including but not 
limited to:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>migraines and headaches</li> 
<li>dizziness / poor equilibrium</li> 
<li>convulsions and seizures</li> 
<li>nausea and vomiting</li> 
<li>fatigue and weakness</li> 
<li>change in mood</li> 
<li>change in vision</li> 
<li>change in heart rate</li> 
<li>diarrhea</li> 
<li>joint pain</li> 
<li>memory loss</li> 
<li>sleep problems / insomnia</li> 
<li>hives / rash<br>
<em>(Source: Mercola.com)</em></li> </ul> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but if I was suffering from any of the above 
symptoms, I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;d be able to keep myself on the 
healthiest eating plan. So besides having the above-listed negative 
side-effects, the ramifications from the consumption of artificial sweeteners 
can be very far-reaching. For more on the subject, I would recommend checking 
out dorway.com and mercola.com and searching through some articles.</p> 
<h4><strong>2. Sweeteners that come from nature are always better to consume 
than those that come from a lab or factory.</strong></h4>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s really easy to fall for hype and marketing when it comes 
to the latest and greatest in the world of what Robb Wolf likes to call 
&ldquo;better living through chemistry.&rdquo; Unfortunately, chemical 
sweeteners are not what he&rsquo;s talking about there. The bottom line: 
ANYTHING that comes from nature will ALWAYS be better for you than something 
that was made in a lab or a factory. Period. I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s a 
fist full of honey vs a teaspoon of Splenda &ndash; give me the honey!</p> 
<p><strong>Non-chemical sweeteners include:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>raw honey</li> 
<li>regular honey (which has been pasteurized/heated and has fewer nutrients 
than raw)</li> 
<li>molasses</li> 
<li>date sugar, palm sugar, coconut sugar</li> 
<li>fruit juice</li> 
<li>maple syrup (real/organic/grade b)</li> 
<li>cane sugar</li> 
<li>green leaf stevia</li> </ul> 
<p><em>We can also classify things like high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), agave 
and brown rice syrup as non-chemical sweeteners though that sort of makes me 
cringe to say it.</em></p> 
<p>Non-chemical sweeteners are not necessarily &ldquo;healthy,&rdquo; it 
simply means that they&rsquo;re refined from something that was found in nature 
and are not made from chemicals. Typically, non-chemical sweeteners can be 
metabolized by our bodies while chemical sweeteners cannot and are considered 
toxins within our system. As with all toxins that enter our system, they are 
stored in our fat cells.</p> 
<p><strong>Chemical sweeteners include:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Aspartame (branded as Equal)</li> 
<li>Saccharin</li> 
<li>Stevia that is white (branded as Truvia and Sun Crystals currently)</li> 
<li>Sucralose (branded as Splenda)</li> 
<li>and a new one that will be available soon called Tagatose.</li> </ul> 
<h4><strong>Which sweeteners are okay to use in moderation &amp; which to 
avoid entirely.</strong></h4> 
<p><strong>Okay in moderation, use organic whenever possible:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>honey, preferably raw (this is what I use most of the time if I need a 
sweetener for something)</li> 
<li>grade b maple syrup (the real stuff! I reach for this second when I want 
that maple-y flavor in a recipe)</li> 
<li>molasses</li> 
<li>date sugar</li> 
<li>fruit juice</li> 
<li>green leaf stevia</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Never use!</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Aspartame (Equal)</li> 
<li>Saccharin (Sweet n Low)</li> 
<li>Stevia- when it&rsquo;s white/bleached (Truvia, Sun Crystals)</li> 
<li>Sucralose (Splenda)</li> 
<li>Tagatose</li> </ul> 
<h4><strong>3. Regardless of the source, it&rsquo;s ALWAYS best to minimize 
your exposure to sweeteners.</strong></h4> 
<p><strong>Finding hidden sweeteners in common foods &amp; snacks: </strong>
<strong>Be a sweetener detective!</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Check the total carbohydrate grams in the food, then check the sugar 
grams- remember that 4g of sugar is 1tsp</li> 
<li>Look for ingredients that end in &ldquo;-ose&rdquo; or &ldquo;-tol&rdquo; 
&ndash; this means it&rsquo;s a sweetener. For example: sucralose, glucose, 
sucrose, fructose, dextrose, maltose, lactose, levulose, mannitol, sorbitol, 
xylitol</li> 
<li>Look for the words sugar, nectar, syrup, crystals. These are typically 
derived from more natural sources, but are STILL sweeteners and you should be 
aware of their presence.</li> 
<li>When reading ingredient lists, remember that the first item listed is the 
largest percentage of the item, and so on. So, if a sweetener is listed within 
the first few ingredients, the item will have a pretty high amount of sweetener 
in it relative to the rest of the ingredients.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Kashi GoLean Crunch Cereal: </strong>1 cup serving size, 37g Carbs, 
13g Sugar (More than 1 Tbsp!)&nbsp;&#8232;<strong>Sweeteners:</strong> 
Evaporated Cane Juice Crystals listed 3rd after the grains and the added soy 
protein concentrate (which are both topics for another day), then Brown Rice 
Syrup listed 4th and Honey listed 8th.</p> 
<p><strong>Yoplait Strawberry Yogurt:</strong> 1 container serving &ndash; 
6oz&#8232;<strong>Sweeteners:</strong> Sugar listed 2nd, High Fructose Corn 
Syrup listed 4th.</p>

<p>Hi Diane,<br>
 great insight, this has definitely made me rethink my use of 
sweeteners &ndash; i mostly use truvia, thinking i was doing the right 
thing&hellip;i think it might be time for a detox, YIKES!!!<br>
 i am just 
curious on your thoughts on coconut sugar and coconut nectar?? i have seen this 
pop up in a few recipes and just recently spotted it at the market. i was 
tempted to try it but thought i would so a little more research before i wasted 
the money.<br>
 thanks for your valuable insight!</p> reply <br>

<p>They&rsquo;re natural sweeteners, not chemicals, but still sugar. I 
wouldn&rsquo;t advocate using ANY sweeteners with abandon, but most of the 
natural ones are fine here or there &ndash; not daily. Chemical sweeteners are 
never okay.</p> reply <br>

<p>can you elaborate on agave a bit? Thanks!</p> reply <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> Diane Sanfilippo says: January 6, 2012 at 9:46 am <br>
<br>

<p>It has a very high fructose content, leaving it very similar to HFCS in 
composition. Fructose metabolism happens in the liver first, which is not ideal 
for us&hellip; taxing our livers with excess fructose isn&rsquo;t something we 
want to do. Our livers need to work on so many metabolic and detoxification 
processes that lessening the blow in any way we can is a good plan. Google 
&ldquo;non alcoholic fatty liver disease&rdquo; if you want more on that.</p>

<p>Hi Diane,</p> 
<p>Great site! Thank you! I would also love more insight on agave. Also if a 
product has stevia listed as an ingredient, is it safe to assume they used the 
plant, or could it still be the white powder or some other fake version?</p> 
reply <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> Diane Sanfilippo says: August 31, 2011 at 7:10 pm <br>
<br>

<p>Hi there-</p> 
<p>Thanks and welcome to the site. Agave is comprised in the greatest 
percentage of fructose (possibly higher in fructose than high fructose corn 
syrup depending on the brand/type/etc.). When our bodies process fructose, our 
liver needs to begin the metabolic process before the sugars are broken down 
into their usable form of glucose in the body. The problem with agave is that 
it&rsquo;s basically a glorified HFCS from a metabolic perspective, if not even 
worse. Our livers are hard at work just trying to detox our system, so putting 
more pressure on them with refined sweeteners isn&rsquo;t something we want to 
do. A raw honey will be much more of a while/unrefined food and while 
relatively high in fructose as a percentage of it&rsquo;s makeup, it&rsquo;s 
much lower in fructose when compared to the refined sweeteners.</p> 
<p>I would not eat packaged foods sweetened with stevia personally on any 
regular basis, though here or there they are probably okay. What&rsquo;s the 
product? I just avoid &ldquo;foods&rdquo; like that as a general rule anyway.

<p>I have a brand of stevia called Sweetleaf. The ingredients list inulin 
fiber and stevia extract as the only two ingredients and the box says 
it&rsquo;s chemical free. The powder is white, opinions?</p> reply <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> Diane Sanfilippo says: September 27, 2011 at 7:31 pm <br>
<br>

<p>What are you using it for and how often? It&rsquo;s probably made from the 
alcohol version of the stevia which is how they make the extract, but I 
personally wouldn&rsquo;t use it with any regularity. Stevia is green in 
nature. Use it green or leave it. Would you use a clear honey without 
it&rsquo;s natural yellow hue?</p> reply <br>
<br>
</li> </ul> </li> 
<li> Amanda says: October 28, 2011 at 10:58 am <br>
<br>

<p>What about the liquid stevias from Sweetleaf that are flavored? The 
ingredients are water and Stevia. If not, where can we find green stevia?</p> 
reply <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> Diane Sanfilippo says: October 28, 2011 at 11:07 am <br>
<br>

<p>I added some links to the stevia above&ndash; here it is also: 
http://amzn.to/ryUEYR</p> 
<p>The liquid extract is okay, but I would just watch out for 
over-use/reliance on it for sweetness regularly. It may also contain additives 
and ingredients you don&rsquo;t want to consume.</p> reply <br>
<br>

<p>Thank you for this and for the links. I have metabolic syndrome and started 
low carb in April, lost 10 lbs and no more but was using artificial sweeteners. 
I have stopped using them except Truvia, which I see is on your list (will cut 
it out, too)! I have lost weight since cutting back so much and starting the 
Leptin Rx. I am thinking your 21-day sugar detox could be for me. Now if I 
could just quite my 2x/week graveyard shift&hellip;.</p> reply <br>

difference from grade A?</p> reply <br>

<p>This is so interesting, thank you! Could I share this in my blog?<br>
 And 
a few questions: 1. does fruit raise insulin levels in the way other sweeteners 
do? 2.how many portions of fruit a day do you recommend? 3.You don&rsquo;t 
recommend agave as a sweetener? If not, could you explain a little bit more 
about this? Thank you! </p> reply <br>

<p>Do sugar alcohols fall under the same guidelines? I rarely see those 
addressed in articles about artificial sweeteners. I don&rsquo;t suggest that 
they are good for you but am wondering if the negative impact is the same as 
the other artificial sweeteners mentioned.</p> reply <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> Diane Sanfilippo says: December 23, 2011 at 10:26 am <br>
<br>

<p>My guess is that the sweet taste will affect it. I have also heard about 
some issues with IBS/IBD triggering from sugar alcohols. I just don&rsquo;t 
think they make much sense. If we&rsquo;re going to eat something sweet, 
calories should follow. That&rsquo;s nature.</p> reply <br>

<p>Hi  I appreciate this post so much and I apologize for this question as it 
may have already been addressed&hellip;I realize that you say white powdered 
stevia is not good because of its processing, but what about NuNatural&rsquo;s 
stevia&hellip;which has no other ingredient in it other than stevia? I would 
really appreciate your say on this because I consume that stevia.</p>
