<h1>Artificial sweeteners: Understanding these and other sugar substitutes</h1>
<h2>Whether your goal is cutting calories or eating healthier, options for 
sugar substitutes abound. Understand their pros and cons to make an informed 
choice.</h2> By Mayo Clinic staff 
<p> If you're trying to reduce the sugar and calories in your diet, you may be 
turning to artificial sweeteners or other sugar substitutes. You aren't alone. 
The popularity of artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes is on the 
rise as manufacturers and consumers seek lower calorie alternatives to regular 
white sugar without sacrificing sweetness.</p> 
<p> Today, artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a 
variety of food and beverages marketed as &quot;sugar-free&quot; or 
&quot;diet,&quot; including soft drinks, chewing gum, jellies, baked goods, 
candy, fruit juice and ice cream. In addition, other sugar substitutes are 
being touted as healthier sweeteners than regular sugar, even if they don't 
have fewer calories, such as honey and agave nectar.</p> 
<p> Just what are all these artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes? And 
what's their role in your diet?</p> 
<h2>Understanding artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes</h2> 
<p> Sugar substitutes are loosely considered any sweetener that you use 
instead of regular table sugar (sucrose). Artificial sweeteners are just one 
type of sugar substitute. Some sugar substitutes, such as aspartame, are 
promoted because they add virtually no calories to your diet. Newer sugar 
substitutes, including stevia and agave nectar, claim to be lower calorie, 
tastier and healthier options.</p> 
<p> The topic of sugar substitutes can be complex and confusing. One problem 
is that the terminology regarding sugar substitutes is often open to 
interpretation. For instance, some manufacturers call their sweeteners 
&quot;natural&quot; even though they're processed or refined, as is the case 
with stevia preparations. And some artificial sweeteners are derived from 
naturally occurring substances &mdash; sucralose comes from sugar, for example. 
Sometimes sugar substitutes are categorized by whether or not they contain 
calories.</p> 
<p> Regardless of what they're called or how they're classified, sugar 
substitutes aren't magic bullets for weight loss. Take a closer look.</p> 
<h2>Artificial sweeteners</h2> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are synthetic sugar substitutes but may be derived 
from naturally occurring substances, including herbs or sugar itself. 
Artificial sweeteners are also known as intense sweeteners because they are 
many times sweeter than regular sugar.</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners currently approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acesulfame potassium (Sunett, Sweet One)</li> 
<li>Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet)</li> 
<li>Neotame</li> 
<li>Saccharin (SugarTwin, Sweet'N Low)</li> 
<li>Sucralose (Splenda)</li> </ul> 
<p> FDA approval is being sought for other artificial sweeteners. And some 
sweeteners, such as cyclamate, are not approved in the United States but are 
approved for use in other countries.</p> 
<p> <strong>Uses for artificial sweeteners<br>
</strong>Artificial sweeteners 
are attractive alternatives to sugar because they add virtually no calories to 
your diet. In addition, you need only a fraction compared with the amount of 
regular sugar you would normally use for sweetness. Artificial sweeteners are 
widely used in processed products, including tabletop sweeteners, baked goods, 
soft drinks, powdered drink mixes, candy, puddings, canned foods, jams and 
jellies, dairy products, and scores of other foods and beverages. Check the 
food label to see if a product contains artificial sweeteners.</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are also popular for home use. Some can even be used 
in baking or cooking. Certain recipes may need modification, though, because 
artificial sweeteners provide no bulk or volume, as does sugar. Check the 
labels on artificial sweeteners for appropriate home use.</p> 
<p> Some artificial sweeteners may leave an aftertaste. You may need to 
experiment with artificial sweeteners to find one or a combination that you 
enjoy most.</p> 
<p> <strong>Possible health benefits of artificial sweeteners</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Weight control.</strong> One of the most appealing aspects of 
artificial sweeteners is that they are non-nutritive &mdash; they have 
virtually no calories. In contrast, each gram of regular table sugar contains 4 
calories. A teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams. For perspective, consider that 
one 12-ounce can of a sweetened cola contains 8 teaspoons of added sugar, or 
about 130 calories. If you're trying to lose weight or prevent weight gain, 
products sweetened with artificial sweeteners rather than with higher calorie 
table sugar may be an attractive option. On the other hand, some research has 
suggested that consuming artificial sweeteners may be associated with increased 
weight, but the cause is not yet known.</li> 
<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong> Artificial sweeteners may be a good alternative 
to sugar if you have diabetes. Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners generally 
don't raise blood sugar levels because they are not carbohydrates. But because 
of concerns about how sugar substitutes are labeled and categorized, always 
check with your doctor or dietitian about using any sugar substitutes if you 
have diabetes.</li> 
<li><strong>Dental cavities.</strong> Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners 
don't contribute to tooth decay.</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Possible health concerns with artificial sweeteners<br>
</strong>
Artificial sweeteners have been the subject of intense scrutiny for decades. 
Critics of artificial sweeteners say that they cause a variety of health 
problems, including cancer. That's largely because of studies dating to the 
1970s that linked saccharin to bladder cancer in laboratory rats. Because of 
those studies, saccharin once carried a warning label that it may be hazardous 
to your health.</p> 
<p> But according to the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies, 
there's no sound scientific evidence that any of the artificial sweeteners 
approved for use in the United States cause cancer or other serious health 
problems. And numerous research studies confirm that artificial sweeteners are 
generally safe in limited quantities, even for pregnant women. As a result of 
the newer studies, the warning label for saccharin was dropped.</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are regulated by the FDA as food additives. They 
must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before being made available for sale. 
In some cases, the FDA declares a substance &quot;generally recognized as 
safe&quot; (GRAS). These GRAS substances, including highly refined stevia 
preparations, are deemed by qualified professionals based on scientific data as 
being safe for their intended use, or they have such a lengthy history of 
common use in food that they're considered generally safe and don't require FDA 
approval before sale.</p> 
<p> The FDA has also established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for each 
artificial sweetener. This is the maximum amount considered safe to consume 
each day over the course of your lifetime. ADIs are intended to be about 100 
times less than the smallest amount that might cause health concerns.</p> 
<h2>Sugar alcohols and novel sweeteners</h2> 
<p> Sugar alcohols (polyols) are carbohydrates that occur naturally in certain 
fruits and vegetables, but they also can be manufactured. They're not 
considered intense sweeteners, because they aren't sweeter than sugar &mdash; 
in fact, some are less sweet than sugar. Sugar alcohols aren't considered 
noncaloric or non-nutritive sweeteners because they contain calories. But 
they're lower in calories than is regular sugar, making them an attractive 
alternative. Despite their name, sugar alcohols aren't alcoholic. They don't 
contain ethanol, which is found in alcoholic beverages.</p> 
<p> Novel sweeteners are combinations of various types of sweeteners. Novel 
sweeteners, such as stevia, are hard to fit into one particular category 
because of what they're made from and how they're made.</p> 
<p> As with artificial sweeteners, the FDA regulates the use of sugar 
alcohols. Approved sugar alcohols and novel sweeteners include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Erythritol</li> 
<li>Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates</li> 
<li>Isomalt</li> 
<li>Lactitol</li> 
<li>Maltitol</li> 
<li>Mannitol</li> 
<li>Sorbitol</li> 
<li>Xylitol</li> 
<li>Stevia preparations that are highly refined (Pure Via, Truvia)</li> </ul> 
<p> Note that the FDA has not approved the use of whole-leaf stevia or crude 
stevia extracts for use as a sweetener. Rather, only certain highly refined 
stevia preparations can be used in food products. Stevia also is available as a 
dietary supplement.</p> 
<p> Tagatose and trehalose are considered novel sweeteners because of their 
chemical structure. They're categorized by the FDA as GRAS substances. Tagatose 
is a low-carbohydrate sweetener similar to fructose that occurs naturally but 
is also manufactured from lactose in dairy products. Foods containing tagatose 
can't be labeled as &quot;sugar-free.&quot; Trehalose is found naturally in 
mushrooms.</p> 
<p> <strong>Uses for sugar alcohols<br>
</strong>Sugar alcohols generally 
aren't used when you prepare food at home. Rather, they are found in many 
processed foods and other products, usually replacing sugar on an equal basis. 
When added to foods, sugar alcohols add sweetness, bulk and texture. They also 
help food stay moist, prevent browning when heated, and add a cooling sensation 
to products.</p> 
<p> Sugar alcohols are used in a broad range of products, including chocolate, 
candy, frozen desserts, chewing gum, toothpaste, mouthwash, baked goods and 
fruit spreads. Sugar alcohols are often combined with artificial sweeteners in 
products to enhance sweetness. Check the food label to help see if a product 
contains sugar alcohols. Food labels may list the specific name, such as 
xylitol, or simply use the general term &quot;sugar alcohol.&quot;</p> 
<p> <strong>Possible health benefits of sugar alcohols</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Weight control.</strong> Sugar alcohols are considered nutritive 
sweeteners because they contribute calories to your diet. Still, sugar alcohols 
have fewer calories than does regular sugar &mdash; about 2 calories per gram 
on average. This means that sugar alcohols can be considered lower calorie 
sweeteners, and they may aid weight-control efforts.</li> 
<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong> Unlike artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols 
can raise blood sugar levels because they're carbohydrates. But because your 
body doesn't completely absorb sugar alcohols, their effect on blood sugar is 
less than that of other sugars. Different sugar alcohols can affect blood sugar 
differently. You can consume sugar alcohols if you have diabetes but you still 
must pay attention to the total amount of carbohydrates in your meals and 
snacks. Talk to your doctor or dietitian for guidance.</li> 
<li><strong>Dental cavities.</strong> Sugar alcohols don't promote cavities.
</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Possible health concerns with sugar alcohols<br>
</strong>As with 
artificial sweeteners, the FDA regulates sugar alcohols as food additives. 
Sugar alcohols typically are labeled as &quot;generally recognized as 
safe&quot; (GRAS) and don't require FDA approval before sale.</p> 
<p> There are few health concerns associated with sugar alcohols. When eaten 
in large amounts, usually more than 50 grams but sometimes as little as 10 
grams, sugar alcohols can have a laxative effect, causing bloating, intestinal 
gas and diarrhea. Product labels may carry a warning about this potential 
laxative effect.</p> 
<h2>Natural sweeteners</h2> 
<p> Natural sweeteners are sugar substitutes that are often promoted as 
healthier options than processed table sugar or other sugar substitutes. But 
even these so-called natural sweeteners often undergo processing and refining, 
including agave nectar.</p> 
<p> Among the natural sweeteners that the FDA recognizes as being generally 
safe for consumption are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Date sugar</li> 
<li>Grape juice concentrate</li> 
<li>Honey</li> 
<li>Maple sugar</li> 
<li>Maple syrup</li> 
<li>Molasses</li> 
<li>Agave nectar</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Uses for natural sweeteners<br>
</strong>Natural sweeteners have a 
variety of uses both at home and in processed foods. They are sometimes known 
as added sugars because they're added to foods during processing. They may be 
used to sweeten drinks such as tea and cocktails, in desserts, as pancake and 
waffle toppings, on cereals, and for baking, for example.</p> 
<p> <strong>Possible health benefits of natural sweeteners<br>
</strong>
Although natural sugar substitutes may seem healthier than processed table 
sugar, their vitamin and mineral content isn't significantly different from 
that of sugar. Honey and sugar, for instance, are nutritionally similar, and 
both end up in your body as glucose and fructose. Choose a natural sweetener 
based on how it tastes and its uses, rather than on its health claims.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Weight control.</strong> Natural sweeteners, like sugar alcohols, 
are considered nutritive sweeteners because they contribute calories to your 
diet. In fact, they contain the same amount of calories as does regular table 
sugar. If your goal is weight control, products sweetened with natural 
sweeteners may not help since they add the same amount of calories to your diet 
as table sugar.</li> 
<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong> Natural sweeteners can raise your blood sugar, 
just as table sugar can. Some proponents of agave nectar, also called agave 
syrup, say that it's a low-glycemic sweetener and doesn't cause blood sugar 
spikes. However, scientific evidence doesn't support such claims about agave 
nectar. Agave nectar can trigger a need for insulin.</li> 
<li><strong>Tooth decay.</strong> Natural sweeteners can contribute to 
cavities.</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Possible health concerns with natural sweeteners<br>
</strong>
So-called natural sweeteners are generally safe. But there's no health 
advantage to consuming added sugar of any type. And consuming too much added 
sugar, even natural sweeteners, can lead to health problems such as tooth 
decay, poor nutrition, weight gain and increased triglycerides. Also, be aware 
that honey can contain small amounts of bacterial spores that can produce 
botulism toxin. Because of that, honey shouldn't be given to babies less than 1 
year old.</p> 
<h2>Moderation is key with artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes</h2> 
<p> When choosing sugar substitutes, it pays to be a savvy consumer. Get 
informed and look beyond the hype. While artificial sweeteners and sugar 
substitutes may help with weight management, they aren't a magic bullet and 
should be used only in moderation. Just because a food is marketed as 
sugar-free doesn't mean it's free of calories. If you eat too many sugar-free 
foods, you can still gain weight if they have other ingredients that contain 
calories. And remember that processed foods, which often contain sugar 
substitutes, generally don't offer the same health benefits as do whole foods, 
such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
