<h3> The Dirty&nbsp;Dozen December 11, 2008</h3>  Filed under: food, green, 
health &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 5:43 pm <br>

sweeteners, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, hydrolyzed soy protein,
milk, pork, raw milk, shellfish, soft drinks, white flour, white sugar <br>

<p>Jordan Rubin, author of&nbsp; &ldquo;Perfect Weight America&rdquo; lists 
the &ldquo;Dirty Dozen&rdquo; food items that we all should avoid for better 
health. He concedes that some might be controversial. While I have eliminated 
most of the foods on his list, there are some that surprised me, like skim milk.
</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>All Pork Products</strong> &ndash; Pigs are omnivores, which means 
that they consume both plants and animals. Pigs will scavenge and have been 
known to eat any kind of food, including dead insects, worms, tree bark, 
rotting carcasses, garbage, and even other pigs. Pigs harbor a range ofparasites
 and diseases that can be transmitted to humans. These include trichinosis,<em>
Taenia solium</em>, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host 
large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract.&nbsp; 
The presence of these diseases and parasites is one of the reasons why pork 
meat should always be well cooked or cured before eating. Religious groups that 
consider pork unclean refer to these issues as support for their views. Another 
reason not to eat pork is that factory hog farms are some of the worst 
polluters in America&rsquo;s history. SeeBoss Hog. While I&rsquo;m not a 
vegetarian, I&rsquo;ll think twice before buying any more pork.</li> 
<li><strong>Shellfish and crustaceans</strong> &ndash; Lobsters, crabs, 
shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, crayfish and scallops are bottom scavengers or 
filter feeders. When I lived in Oregon, we would go upriver to swim and catch 
crayfish. I never thought much about what crayfish eat until my sister&rsquo;s 
dog pooped in the water. The crayfish went crazy, coming out of their hiding 
places from all over, to devour the tasty goodness. No more crayfish for me, 
thanks. Even though I love shrimp, I don&rsquo;t eat much of it after 
researchingPoison Shrimp&nbsp;Cocktail. And oysters, clams or mussels in 
Arizona? Not so much.</li> 
<li><strong>Processed meats and hydrolyzed soy protein</strong> &ndash; 
Processed meats contain nitrates for flavor, color and as a preservative. Steer 
clear of breakfast links, hot dogs, Salisbury steaks, bologna, sausages, 
salami, and lunch meats of all kinds. Nitrates can turn into nitrites which 
have been found to cause cancer and tumors in test animals. Hydrolyzed soy 
protein usually contains a significant amount of genetically modified soy. 
According to theFDA, hydrolyzed protein is used to enhance flavor and contains 
monosodium glutamate. When added this way, the labels are not required to list 
MSG as an ingredient. Yum.</li> 
<li><strong>White flour</strong> &ndash; White flour is white because the 
wheat has been stripped of the wheat germ, bran, and half of the healthy fatty 
acids and then bleached. Enriched white flour just means that a few isolated 
and synthetic vitamins and minerals have been added back into the flour. Look 
for whole-grain breads or flour as a healthy alternative.</li> 
<li><strong>Hydrogenated oils</strong> &ndash; During the hydrogenation 
process, hydrogen gas in injected into oil under high pressure to make the oil 
solid at room temperature and prevent the oil from becoming rancid too quickly. 
The process produces trans fats. The consumption of trans fats increases 
one&rsquo;s risk ofcoronary heart disease by raising levels of 
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of &ldquo;good&rdquo; HDL 
cholesterol. Health authorities recommend that consumption of trans fat be 
reduced to trace amounts. If the ingredient list contains the words 
&ldquo;shortening&rdquo;, &ldquo;partially hydrogenated vegetable oil&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;hydrogenated vegetable oil&rdquo;, then the food contains trans fat. 
Even if the label says &ldquo;zero trans fat&rdquo;, the FDA allows 
manufacturers to have less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving and still 
legally use the term &ldquo;zero trans fat&rdquo;. So much for truth in 
labeling.</li> 
<li><strong>Pasteurized, homogenized skim milk</strong> &ndash; This one 
surprised me. Instead of skim milk, Mr. Rubin recommends unpasteurized milk 
from grass-fed animals instead of homogenized, pasteurized milk. Since raw milk 
has risks based on the sanitary practices of the farm where it is produced, the 
next best thing is cultured or fermented dairy whole-milk products, such as 
yogurt and kefir. I&rsquo;ve often wondered why humans are the only species 
that drink the milk of another animal. That being said, I still have a nonfat 
latte every morning and love my cheese.</li> 
<li><strong>White sugar</strong> &ndash; Sugar&ndash;including sucrose, corn 
sweeteners, honey, and molasses&ndash;is, in a sense, the number-one food 
additive. The average American eats up to three pounds of sugar every week. Of 
course, few people actually go through that much actual table sugar, but it is 
found in almost all of the processed foods we eat. It turns up in some unlikely 
places, such as pizza, bread, hot dogs, boxed rice mixes, soup, crackers, 
spaghetti sauce, lunch meat, canned vegetables, fruit drinks, flavored yogurt, 
ketchup, salad dressing, mayonnaise, and some peanut butter. Carbonated soft 
drinks are the worst offenders in the American diet.</li> 
<li><strong>Soft drinks</strong> &ndash; Soft drink are empty calories with 
little or no nutritional value, considering most are made with high-fructose 
corn syrup. If you drink one can of soda per day, you will consume 55,000 extra 
calories in one year, or 15 pounds of weight gain. I find soft drinks too sweet 
for my taste. I&rsquo;d rather drink water.</li> 
<li><strong>High-fructose corn syrup</strong> &ndash; Manufacturers use HFCS 
because it&rsquo;s cheap. You&rsquo;ll find it in soda, fruit juice, baked 
goods, canned fruits, dairy products, cooks, gum, jam, jellies, 
pickles&hellip;you get the picture. The problem with HFCS is that the body 
handles fructose differently than all other sugars. Fructose does not stimulate 
leptin, the hormone that tell you &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full&rdquo;. In fat, it 
reduces ghrelin hormone levels, which tell you &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still 
hungry&rdquo;. Fructose propels the liver into fat-promoting mode by activating 
the formation of enymes that lead to elevated levels of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; 
cholesterol and triglycerides.</li> 
<li><strong>Artificial sweeteners</strong> &ndash; As many as 194 million 
Americans regularly eat and drink sugar-free products. Whether or not 
artificial sweeteners are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for our health, why consume an 
artificial product when a natural one if available? Plus, if they worked, why 
are so many Americans fat? I weaned myself from my Diet Mountain Dew habit over 
a year ago and feel much better as a result.</li> 
<li><strong>Artificial flavors and artificial colors</strong> &ndash; Food 
additives have been linked to behavioral problems in children. They have also 
been associated with allergies and skin rashes. I dislike most prepared foods 
and normally shop the perimeter of the grocery store. I&rsquo;d rather eat my 
own cooking.</li> 
<li><strong>Beer, wine and alcoholic drinks</strong> &ndash; This one pains me 
since I do like my glass of wine in the evening. However, his book was written 
for folks who are trying to lose weight and alcohol in all its forms is highly 
caloric. Of course there&rsquo;s the problems associated with excessive 
drinking.</li> </ol> 
<p>All in all, I follow most of Mr. Rubin&rsquo;s recommendations. Combine 
that with daily exercise and I weigh within two pounds of my weight in high 
school. Never felt better.<br>

<h3> 6 Dirtiest Foods in&nbsp;America September 30, 2008</h3>  Filed under: 
food, green &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 5:00 am <br>
 Tags: E. coli, food poisoning, 
foodborne illnessses, hamburger, Listeria, poultry, raw eggs, raw milk, 
Salmonella, shellfish, Staph <br>

<p>An estimated 76 million cases of foodborne disease or food poisoning occur 
each year in the United States according to theCenters for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC). Most of these cases are mild and cause symptoms for only a 
day or two. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and 
diarrhea.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Most of these infections are undiagnosed and unreported. Some cases are 
more serious. The CDC estimates that there are 325,000 hospitalizations and 
5,000 deaths related to foodborne diseases each year.&nbsp;More than 250 
different foodborne diseases have been described.&nbsp;Most of these diseases 
are infections, caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites.</p> 
<p>The most commonly recognized foodborne infections are those caused by the 
bacteria<em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, and <em>E. coli</em>, and 
by a group of viruses called calicivirus, also known as the<em>Norwalk</em>
&nbsp;and Norwalk-like viruses.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Food and Drug Administration estimates that 2-3% of all foodborne 
illnesses lead to secondary long-term illnesses. For example, certain strains of
<em>E. coli</em>&nbsp;can cause kidney failure in young children and infants; 
<em>Salmonella&nbsp;</em>can lead to reactive arthritis and serious infections; 
<em>Listeria</em>&nbsp;can cause meningitis and stillbirths; and <em>
Campylobacter&nbsp;</em>may be the most common precipitating factor for 
Guillain-Barre syndrome.</p> 
<p>Since &ldquo;Man does not live by bread alone&rdquo;, how can you avoid 
getting food poisoning? Here is a list of the foods most likely to make you 
sick, according to the CDC.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Raw Shellfish</strong><br>
 Oysters and other filter feeding 
shellfish can concentrate<em>Vibrio</em> bacteria that are naturally present in 
sea water, or other microbes that are present in human sewage dumped into the 
sea. A large number of studies have detected norovirus in oysters. 
Additionally, infected fishermen have contaminated oysters as they harvested 
them.&nbsp;Sounds like an aphrodisiac to me.</li> 
<li><strong>Ground Beef</strong><br>
 A single hamburger may contain meat from 
hundreds of animals. When meat is ground, more of the meat is exposed to the 
harmful bacteria. According to the USDA, pathogenic bacteria, such as<em>
Salmonella</em>, <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Listeria</em>, 
and<em>Staph</em>&nbsp;cause illness and can be present in your meat. These 
harmful bacteria cannot be seen or smelled. Do you want cheese with that burger?
</li> 
<li><strong>Alfalfa Sprouts</strong><br>
 The conditions under which sprouts 
are grown are ideal for growing microbes as well as sprouts. That means that a 
few bacteria present on the seeds can grow to high numbers of pathogens on the 
sprouts.</li> 
<li><strong>Milk</strong><br>
 Each year, people become ill from drinking raw 
milk and eating foods made from raw dairy products. Unlike most of the milk, 
cheese, and dairy products sold in the United States, raw milk and raw dairy 
products have not been heat treated or pasteurized to kill germs. Raw milk and 
raw dairy products may carry many types of disease-causing germs such as<em>
Campylobacter</em>, <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Listeria</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, 
<em>Yersinia</em>, and <em>Brucella</em>. My brother-in-law described working 
in a dairy as a young man when the milking machine fell into cow manure (still 
sucking away). When he said they simply plugged it back onto the cow&rsquo;s 
udder, I got a little queasy. Got raw milk?</li> 
<li><strong>Raw Eggs</strong><br>
 Bacteria can be on the outside of a shell 
egg. That&rsquo;s because the egg exits the hen&rsquo;s body through the same 
passageway as feces is excreted. That&rsquo;s why eggs are washed and sanitized 
at the processing plant. Bacteria can be inside an uncracked, whole egg. 
Contamination of eggs may be due to bacteria within the hen&rsquo;s ovary or 
oviduct before the shell forms around the yolk and white.<em>Salmonella</em>
&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t make the hen sick. It is also possible for eggs to become 
infected by fecal contamination through the pores of the shells after 
they&rsquo;re laid.</li> 
<li><strong>Poultry</strong><br>
 The following are bacteria associated with 
chicken:
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Enteritidis</em> may be found in the intestinal tracts of livestock, 
poultry, dogs, cats and other warm-blooded animals. This strain is only one of 
about 2,000 kinds of<em>Salmonella&nbsp;</em>bacteria; it is often associated 
with poultry and shell eggs.</li> 
<li><em>Staph </em>can be carried on human hands, in nasal passages, or in 
throats. The bacteria are found in foods made by hand and improperly 
refrigerated, such as chicken salad.</li> 
<li><em>Campylobacter</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is one of the most common causes of 
diarrheal illness in humans. Preventing cross- contamination and using proper 
cooking methods reduces infection by this bacterium.</li> 
<li><em>Listeria</em><em> </em>was recognized as causing human foodborne 
illness in 1981. It is destroyed by cooking, but a cooked product can be 
contaminated by poor personal hygiene (in other words, wash your hands).</li> 
</ul> </li> </ol> 
<p><strong></strong>You can reduce your risk for foodborne illness by 
following safe food-handling recommendations and by avoiding consumption of 
unpasteurized milk, raw or undercooked oysters,&nbsp;eggs, or ground beef, and 
undercooked poultry.&nbsp;Additional information on food safety is available at
