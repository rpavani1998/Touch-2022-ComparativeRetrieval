<h3>How Much Sugar Can I Have?</h3>The World Health Organization suggests that 
no more than 10% of your daily calories come from added sugar. That's a good 
goal. So let's turn that into grams, so you can use Nutrient Facts Labels to 
track your sugar consumption. Last week, you calculated the number of calories 
you should be taking in every day (if you didn't - go back and review thefirst 
lesson). Only 10% of that number of calories should come from added sugars. For 
example, if you need 2,000 calories per day, than only 200 calories should come 
from extra sugar. You can determine how many grams of sugar that is by dividing 
the number by 4 (there are 4 calories in one gram of sugar). So in our example, 
200 calories would equal 50 grams of sugar.
<p>If you don't like calculating numbers or that seems like a drastic cut in 
sugar, then you can choose a different goal. Look at your food diary from last 
week. How many sugary foods did you eat or drink each day? Do you usually drink 
three cans of a sugary soda? You can set a goal of just one soda each day 
(without adding any additional sugary foods). Did you start most of your days 
with a sweet mocha latte from the coffee shop? How about switching to drip 
coffee or tea a few days each week? Once you meet these goals, you can set new 
ones.</p> 
<h3>Using Sugar as a Condiment</h3> 
<p>You don't have to give up sugar completely - you can use sugar like a 
condiment instead of an ingredient. Each teaspoon of sugar has 16 calories or 4 
grams of sugar. So instead of buying a presweetened breakfast cereal with 15 
grams of sugar in one serving, buy a whole grain cereal and add some fruit and 
sprinkle a little sugar on top. You'll get your sweet flavor, but you'll eat a 
lot less sugar.</p> 
<p>You can use honey the same way. Nutritionally, honey is about the same as 
sugar, but since it adds more flavor, you may use a teaspoon of honey on some 
of your foods.</p> 
<h3>Using Artificial Sweeteners</h3> 
<p>Artificial sweeteners, which are also called &quot;non-nutritive 
sweeteners,&quot; add sweetness to many foods and beverages without adding any 
calories or nutrition. They are well-known ingredients in diet sodas and 
snacks, and some are easily identified in little colorful packets alongside 
sugar in your favorite coffee shop or restaurant. Common sweeteners include 
saccharin (Sweet'N Low), Sucralose (Splenda) andaspartame (Nutrasweet). Another 
non-caloric natural sweetener is an herb calledstevia.</p> 
<p>Some people find the use of artificial sweeteners to be controversial, 
although there is plenty of research that demonstrates the safety of these 
sweeteners. Some people object to the flavor of artificial sweeteners, which 
are different from natural sugars. If you don't like artificial sweeteners, you 
don't have to use them. If you like the non-nutritive sweeteners, just remember 
that while they don't add calories to your diet, they really don't add anything 
good either. So, go ahead and replace a regular soda with a diet soda, but 
don't use them to replace healthy beverages such as milk, 100% fruit juices, 
water and vegetable juice.</p> 
<h3>Tips for Reducing the Sugar in Your Diet</h3> 
<p>Buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads and pasta, 
plain oatmeal, lean meats, poultry, fish, and dairy products (other than 
sugar-sweetened yogurts). Avoid the overly processed foods and read the labels 
onpackaged foods to look for added sugar. Buy plain yogurt and add a little bit 
of honey, some chopped nuts and lots of blueberries.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Serve fresh berries for dessert instead of ice cream. Make your own trail 
mix with dried fruit, mixed nuts and whole-grain cereal and take to work for a 
snack instead of candy bars, cookies or pastries.</li> 
<li>Add a lemon slice to sparkling soda instead of sugary soda.</li> 
<li>Avoid ice cream sundaes, malts and shakes, and cold, blended coffee 
drinks, which are all high in sugar. Mix 100% fruit juice with club soda for a 
healthier soft-drink.</li> 
<li>Buy fresh fruit instead of cookies and pastries.</li> 
<li>Most of the fruit smoothies sold at coffee shops are filled with added 
sugar and not much fruit. Make your own smoothies at home with bananas, berries 
and a little non-fat milk.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Your Assignments This Week</h3>Now that you're going to pay more attention 
to the added sugar in your diet, choose a goal similar to one of these:
<p>I will only drink one can of sugary soda instead of three cans on at least 
three days this week (or four days or all week).</p> 
<p>I will eat less than X number of grams of sugar three days this week (or 
four or five days). Calculate that number by using the example from the reading.
</p> 
<p>Continue to use your food diary. It will help you keep track of how you are 
progressing.</p>Your next lesson will help you incorporate more fruits and 
vegetables into your diet, even if you're a picky eater - very important 
because fruits and vegetables are so good for your health.
