<h2>How can I break the cycle of IBS attacks? </h2> Diarrhea and pain should 
resolve in just a few days. Constipation, especially if it's been chronic, can 
take several weeks after you initially calm down your gut. Please hang in there.
<br><br>
 The best thing to do to break the IBS cycle is to really restrict 
your diet for a few days (and only a few days - this is a short-term diet only) 
to nothing but<strong>soluble fiber foods</strong> and <strong>soluble fiber 
supplements</strong>, and lots of strong hot <strong>peppermint tea</strong> 
(if you're prone to acid reflux, try<strong>fennel</strong> or chamomile or 
anise instead of the mint). Peppermint is a powerful muscle relaxant and a 
painkiller. Fennel is the best for bloating and gas - it can really help. Try 
to be mildly active, even if just around the house, as gentle exercise will 
work the muscles of the bowels and help get them back into a pattern of normal 
contractions. Walking or stretching or an easy yoga practice is ideal. Exercise 
is especially crucial for constipation.<br>
<br>
 The soluble fiber will 
stabilize the GI contractions that are going haywire with IBS and causing pain, 
and will normalize bowel function from either extreme (diarrhea/constipation) 
as well. So stick to foods like plain white rice, plain instant oatmeal, cream 
of rice cereal, dry corn or oat or rice cereals, pasta, white breads or toast, 
peeled potatoes, etc. Boring, I know, but it's just a few days. Make sure 
you've added in a soluble fiber supplement like<strong>Acacia Tummy Fiber
</strong>, too - this is crucial. Start with 1/2 level teaspoon twice a day, 
and then gradually increase until you stabilize. Have plenty of fresh water or 
the herbal teas. For soluble fiber to normalize your bowel function you must 
drink enough water - aim for at least 128 ounces of water each day.<br>
<br>
 
After a few days, you should be feeling much better, and your gut will have 
stabilized. Start carefully expanding your diet - the<strong>recipes</strong> 
for zucchini, banana, pumpkin breads work well here, and so does the jok rice 
porridge soup. Begin to incorporate insoluble fiber foods - carefully! - by 
blending fresh fruit with soy or rice milk into smoothies, and blending cooked 
veggies into soups or pasta sauces. Have the smoothie with rice cereal or 
oatmeal, and the soup with rice or polenta. Try a bit of grilled fish or 
skinless chicken breast with your pasta/rice. Safe treats are the<strong>recipes
</strong> for vanilla or chocolate puddings, peppermint fudge cake, banana 
cream pie. Keep your fat content very low and be extra careful with insoluble 
fiber. As you stay stable, you can expand to all the other<strong>IBS recipes
</strong>, and just follow the general guidelines (still low fat, no triggers, 
careful with insoluble fiber) but you'll be back to a healthy diet overall and 
not just plain soluble fiber. You should always continue to make soluble fiber 
the basis of your diet, though, and have those foods as the foundation of your 
meals and snacks.<br>
<br>

<h2>How can the same diet work for diarrhea AND constipation? </h2> The same 
diet (as well as supplements like<b>Acacia Tummy Fiber</b>, Equalactin, 
Citrucel, Fibercon, Benefiber, etc.) will work for diarrhea and constipation 
BOTH, because the basis of the diet is soluble fiber. Soluble fiber works to 
alleviate all symptoms of IBS, from diarrhea to constipation to painful cramps 
and gas - it's magic.<br>
<br>
 Why is soluble fiber so special? Because unlike 
any other food category, it soothes and regulates the digestive tract, 
stabilizes the intestinal contractions resulting from the gastrocolic reflex 
(which go awry in people with IBS due to a brain-bowel miscommunication), and 
normalizes bowel function from<em>either</em> extreme. This means it regulates 
both over-motility and under-motility of the colon (people with IBS suffer from 
one or the other, or even fluctuate between the two). So, soluble fiber 
prevents and relieves<em>both</em> diarrhea and constipation. <br>
<br>
 
Nothing else in the world will do this for you. How is this possible? The 
&quot;soluble&quot; in soluble fiber means that it dissolves in water (though 
it is not digested). This allows it to absorb excess liquid in the colon, 
preventing diarrhea by forming a thick gel and adding a great deal of bulk as 
it passes intact through the gut. This gel (as opposed to a watery liquid) also 
keeps the GI muscles stretched gently around a full colon, giving those muscles 
something to easily &quot;grip&quot; during peristaltic contractions, thus 
preventing the rapid transit time and explosive bowel movements of diarrhea as 
well. By the same token, the full gel-filled colon (as opposed to a colon 
tightly clenched around dry, hard, impacted stools) provides the same 
&quot;grip&quot; during the muscle waves of constipation sufferers, allowing 
for an easier and faster transit time, and the passage of the thick wet gel 
also effectively relieves constipation by softening and pushing through 
impacted fecal matter. If you can mentally picture your colon as a tube that is 
squeezing through matter via regular waves of contractions, it's easy to see 
how a colon filled with soluble fiber gel is beneficial for both sides of the 
IBS coin. Once you're stabilized soluble fiber will also help prevent further 
problems.<br>
<br>
 Both soluble fiber supplements (like <strong>Acacia Tummy 
Fiber</strong>, Equalactin, Citrucel, Fibercon, Benefiber) and soluble fiber 
foods (like rice, pasta, oatmeal, potatoes, white bread) will work. Insoluble 
fiber (like bran, raw fibrous veggies, salad greens, unpeeled fruits) will also 
relieve constipation, but at the risk of triggering violent GI spasms that can 
be very painful. These spasms can actually seize up the colon muscles in a type 
&quot;charley horse&quot;, which then results in no motility and constipation 
once again. For this reason, the soluble fiber base is key, and insoluble fiber 
(which should absolutely be eaten) needs to be treated with care, and eaten 
according to the<strong>guidelines</strong>. Also drink lots of fresh water and 
exercise, of course - but you already know that.<br>
<br>
 Fats of all kinds 
are also triggers for constipation as well as diarrhea, because fats are a very 
powerful GI tract stimulant just like insoluble fiber. Fats can cause the same 
type of rapid spasms<em>or</em> &quot;charley horse&quot; muscle contractions 
in the colon, and again result in either diarrhea or constipation. The major 
trigger foods - red meats, dairy, egg yolks, fried foods - are high in fat and, 
for the meat, dairy, and eggs, also have proteins that are very difficult for 
the body to digest. They can basically grind digestion to a halt for 
IBS-constipation folks, or send it spasming out of control for the 
diarrhea-prone, and result in severe attacks either way. Coffee (even decaf) is 
a powerful GI tract irritant, and can have the same effect.<br>
<br>
 In 
general, people with constipation are afraid to eat the soluble fiber foods 
(for some reason I've never gotten to the bottom of they're thought of as 
&quot;binding&quot;), but not afraid of the supplements because they're usually 
marketed as laxatives (though they're technically not). On the other hand, 
people with diarrhea are comfortable with the soluble fiber foods but terrified 
to try the supplements, because they feel (quite understandably) that a 
&quot;laxative&quot; is the last thing they need. I spend a lot of time 
volleying back and forth trying to convince both groups of folks that a diet 
based on soluble fiber, avoiding the trigger foods, and carefully incorporating 
insoluble fiber, will only help and not hurt them, no matter what their 
specific IBS symptoms.<br>
<br>

<h2>How can foods have both soluble and insoluble fiber?</h2> Most all grains, 
cereals, legumes, and tubers have an outer insoluble fiber layer, and a soluble 
fiber interior (and the same is true for some fruits and vegetables, such as 
apples and zucchini). It's very easy to actually see this with your own eyes. 
If you take a cooked grain of brown rice, wheat berry, kernel of corn, potato, 
or bean you can separate the tough exterior (the bran, skin, or shell) from the 
creamy interior. When the bran is removed from wheat berries and they're milled 
the result is white flour; when the bran is removed from brown rice the result 
is white rice. There aren't many similar common commercial processes that 
remove the insoluble fiber exterior from legumes, fruits, or vegetables, but 
finely blending, pureeing, or peeling these whole foods will greatly minimize 
their trigger risk. Oatmeal, brown rice, and corn meal (polenta) tend to be the 
best-tolerated whole grains for IBS.<br>
<br>

<h2>Should I take a soluble fiber supplement? How much?</h2> Most (but not 
all) soluble fiber supplements (such as<strong>Acacia Tummy Fiber</strong>, 
Equalactin, FiberChoice, Citrucel, Fibercon, Benefiber, Fybogel, Regulan, 
Metamucil) are marketed as over-the-counter laxative and anti-diarrheal 
products, so they are bound by the FDA prescribing guidelines for those 
products. This means that the supplements must have the dosage limitations on 
their packaging that apply to OTC anti-diarrheal and laxative drugs, even 
though they are not drugs but fiber supplements. The FDA packaging guidelines 
for this category do not discriminate between the drugs and the fibers. This 
explains why the dosages for these products that your doctor recommends for IBS 
may conflict with the package information.<br>
<br>
 The dosage information for 
IBS that I have been given by doctors and fiber supplement manufacturers, and 
that I believe works best for preventing IBS symptoms, is as follows: For the 
powders (<strong>Acacia Tummy Fiber</strong>, Citrucel, Benefiber, Metamucil) 
start at 1/2 - 1 teaspoon twice a day and over the next week or two (or three 
or four) work up to 2 tablespoons twice a day, or whatever is the equivalent of 
10-12 grams of soluble fiber per day. If you're using pills (Equalactin, 
FiberChoice, Citrucel, Fibercon) start at 2 pills twice daily and work up to 2 
pills six times daily, or the equivalent of 10-12 grams soluble fiber per day. 
You can also mix and match the powders and pills (for example, take the powders 
at home but keep the pills on you at work or for taking before restaurant 
meals). If you're combining powder and pill supplements, I think it's 
definitely best to make sure that your total daily dosage is equal to what it 
should be for just the pills or fibers alone. You don't want to take the 
maximum dose for the pills and then take the maximum dose for the powders on 
top of this. Please note that the supplements are not meant to be the main 
source of fiber in your diet - they are an<em>addition</em> to the fiber you 
need to be eating (both soluble and insoluble) from foods.<br>
<br>
 If you do 
not see a measurable improvement in your IBS symptoms within one week (for 
diarrhea) or two weeks (for constipation) of using the maximum dosage of a 
soluble fiber supplement, this could certainly point to a problem other than 
IBS, and you should see your doctor again. If you have any questions or 
concerns about the dose and frequency of taking soluble fiber supplements, 
check with your own physician.<br>
<br>
 For all fiber supplements, make sure 
you have a large glass of water with each dose, and drink fresh water 
frequently throughout the day as well. Soluble fiber needs plenty water to work 
-<em>this is essential.</em> I believe you can take soluble fiber supplements 
every day for the rest of your life and it will only help your IBS.<br>
<br>
 
If you're at all prone to bloating or gas avoid Metamucil and Fybogel 
(psyllium) and try<strong>Acacia Tummy Fiber</strong>, Equalactin, FiberChoice, 
Citrucel, Fibercon, or Benefiber instead. Outside the USA, look for Benefiber 
(avoid Normacol, which contains a laxative), or<strong>order Acacia Tummy Fiber 
online</strong>. Also, be aware that the sugar-free versions of the supplements 
can contain artificial sweeteners, which can trigger IBS attacks. In addition, 
citric acid is often added to orange-flavored supplements, and this can cause 
acid reflux in some people. If these are concerns for you, choose a 
sugar-sweetened or unsweetened, unflavored variety of supplement. Aside from 
the concerns about psyllium, there doesn't seem to be one type of soluble fiber 
supplement that is more or less likely to be well-tolerated by people in 
general. There is a great deal of individual variation here in how someone 
responds to any particular supplement. So if you have gas or bloating from 
starting a supplement that doesn't disappear after a week or so, don't be 
discouraged, just try a different brand and perhaps a different formulation 
(the pills instead of powder, or vice versa). It may take several different 
tries to find the supplement that works best for you, but the results can be 
well worth the effort.<br>
<br>
 The USDA recommended <em>minimum</em> fiber 
intake for adults is 25 to 35 grams daily, and soluble fiber should account for 
one third of this amount. Some scientists actually recommend up to 60 grams of 
fiber a day, so the USDA recommendations are not maximum dosage limitations. 
The typical American eats only a meager 10-15 grams of fiber daily. For 
comparison, the average fiber intake in China is 33 grams of fiber a day, and 
it ranges as high as 77 grams per day in some regions.<br>
<br>
<strong>Dosages 
and fiber content for common soluble fiber supplements:<br>
<br>
</strong> 
<strong>Acacia Tummy Fiber</strong> provides 6 grams of organic soluble fiber 
per level tablespoon dose.<br>
<br>
 Benefiber provides 3 grams of soluble 
fiber per tablespoon dose.<br>
<br>
 One tablespoon of Metamucil smooth texture 
orange and original texture orange (these are not the sugar-free varieties) 
contains 2 grams of soluble fiber and 1 gram of insoluble fiber.<br>
<br>
 Two 
Metamucil wafers provide 2 grams soluble fiber and 1 gram insoluble fiber.<br>

<br> Two Fibercon tablets contain 1 gram soluble fiber. <br>
<br>
 Two 
Equalactin tablets contain 1 gram soluble fiber.<br>
<br>
 Two FiberChoice 
tablets contain 4 grams soluble fiber<br>
<br>
 One tablespoon of Citrucel 
provides 2 grams of soluble fiber.<br>
<br>
 Two Citrucel caplets provide 1 
gram of soluble fiber.<br>
<br>
 Fiber supplements have health benefits in 
addition to controlling IBS symptoms. Soluble fiber (both foods and 
supplements) not only normalizes bowel function, it also helps stabilize blood 
glycemic levels, slows the rate of carbohydrate absorption, improves regulation 
of blood sugar, and lowers insulin requirements. Soluble fiber also decreases 
LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) blood cholesterol levels, and therefore reduces the risk 
of heart disease. Studies have also shown that fiber helps prevent colon cancer.
<br><br>

<h2>I have really severe bloating. What can I do?</h2> Bloating is one of the 
most frustrating IBS symptoms, and unfortunately one of the most difficult ones 
to treat. There is good news, though.<strong>Fennel tea</strong> can work 
wonders to ease both bloating and gas. You can buy fennel seeds in bulk from 
the spice section of a health food market or at a spice shop. Just brew a 
tablespoon or so of the seeds in a tea strainer and drink several cups a day. 
Fennel tastes like licorice and has anti-gas as well as anti-spasmodic 
properties, making it especially helpful for IBS. It's also a very safe herbal 
remedy that you can use daily without any risks.<br>
<br>
 The other factor to 
consider in treating bloating with IBS is your choice of soluble fiber 
supplement. Soluble fiber is a miracle worker for many people in managing all 
IBS symptoms, whether cramping, diarrhea, and/or constipation. However, one of 
the most common soluble fiber supplements is psyllium (sold as Metamucil, 
Konsyl, Fibrogel, or as bulk husks). Psyllium can cause bloating for some IBS 
patients, and if this happens to you try an alternate supplement.<strong>Acacia 
Tummy Fiber</strong>, Equalactin, FiberChoice, Citrucel, Benefiber, and 
Fibercon are all effective soluble fiber supplements that do not contain 
psyllium and should not cause bloating. In fact,<strong>Acacia is a prebiotic 
fiber</strong>, which means that it increases good gut flora, and actively helps
<em>reduce</em> bloating and gas. <br>
<br>
Avoid chewing gum if you're prone 
to bloating - it can cause you to swallow a lot of air. And one last thing to 
try is eliminating all carbonated beverages from your diet. Carbonation in 
general is a potential trigger for IBS attacks, and it's particularly likely to 
exacerbate bloating. Have a nice hot cup of the fennel tea instead of soda pop 
or sparkling water.<br>
<br>

<h2>Won't eating all these high carb soluble fiber foods make me fat?</h2> No 
- they won't. You're more much more likely to lose weight with the IBS diet 
than gain. The high soluble fiber foods at the foundation of the IBS diet 
(rice, pasta, oatmeal, potatoes, white bread) should not cause weight gain as 
you're also going to be eliminating high fat foods such as red meats, dairy, 
egg yolks, and fried foods. Soluble fiber (and insoluble fiber, which you'll be 
incorporating carefully but as much as possible) is calorie-free as it passes 
through the body undigested, and it is also quite filling. Soluble fiber also 
stabilizes blood glycemic levels because it regulates the rate at which food 
leaves the stomach, which helps keep appetite levels under control and is very 
helpful for diabetes. If you wish to avoid the soluble fiber foods with that 
are high on the glycemic index, you can use brown rice, oatmeal, buckwheat 
(soba) noodles, corn meal (polenta), quinoa, and barley (the whole grains that 
are safest for IBS), plus root vegetables, instead of white rice or potatoes. 
Many people who are overweight actually find that they effortlessly lose weight 
with the IBS diet because the decrease in fats and increase in soluble fiber 
foods results in a calorie reduction. The nice corollary to this is that for 
people with IBS who are underweight, the diet can let them gain weight and 
maintain it because they no longer have to be afraid that eating will trigger 
an attack, so they end up eating more food in sheer terms of quantity than 
they've been able to in the past.<br>
<br>
 Soluble fiber foods are always 
plant foods, and almost always high carbohydrate foods, but it is simply untrue 
that a higher carb/lower fat and protein diet is unhealthy or leads to weight 
gain or diabetes. Americans average only 45-55% of their diets from 
carbohydrates, and our obesity rate is now 35%. In contrast, Asian countries 
average 60-75% of their diets from carbs (with white rice as the staple) and 
their obesity rates are 1-2%. They also have lower colon cancer, heart disease, 
diabetes, and osteoporosis rates. For glucose concerns, your body eventually 
breaks down all carbohydrates (simple and complex, and no matter what the 
source or how much/which type of fiber they contain) into glucose, as this is 
the only fuel the brain can use.<br>
<br>
 It is always more nutritious to eat 
whole grain foods such as brown rice and whole wheat breads than refined grains 
such as white rice and white bread, because it is the bran portion of the grain 
that is removed during the refining process, and the bran is high in vitamins 
and minerals. However, the bran is also pure insoluble fiber, and thus a 
trigger for IBS attacks. This doesn't mean that you won't eat any whole grains 
on the IBS diet - in fact, you will incorporate as many of them as you can 
tolerate into a high soluble fiber foundation, but you'll do so very carefully. 
You'll also be adding many fresh fruits, veggies, beans, and nuts to the 
soluble fiber foods, but again with care. This will dramatically increase the 
safety of these insoluble fiber foods in terms of the strength of the 
gastrocolic reflex they trigger (people with IBS suffer from irregular 
gastrocolic reflexes, and are prone to having the muscle contractions triggered 
by this reflex go violently out of control, resulting in cramps, diarrhea, 
and/or constipation). Insoluble fiber (and fats) are the single greatest 
stimulants of the gastrocolic reflex.<br>
<br>
 The difference in soluble vs. 
insoluble fibers in foods can be confusing because many foods contain both. 
Grains and cereals especially have insoluble fiber in their outer layers (the 
bran, husk, or hull of wheat berries, rice grains, corn kernels, etc.) but 
soluble fiber in the interior. This is actually true for many fruits, 
vegetables, beans, and lentils as well (the skins are insoluble, the interior 
flesh soluble). You are going to be eating these whole foods, but their 
insoluble fiber makes them too risky to eat alone, on an empty stomach, or in 
large quantities at once. That's where the plain soluble fiber food choices 
(the white rice, pastas, white bread, potatoes, etc.) can act as safe 
foundation foods for people with IBS. It's as much a matter of<em><strong>how 
you eat</strong></em> as it is what you eat. So do make sure you get the whole 
foods in your diet, but recognize that their insoluble fiber (and fructose in 
the fruit, sulfur in the cruciferous vegetables, etc.) pose challenges to IBS 
folks and don't be afraid to eat the high soluble fiber foods first and 
foremost. They will address all the symptoms of IBS across the entire spectrum, 
and they won't pile on the pounds as a result, I promise.<br>
<br>
 
Anecdotally, I get many letters from people who have lost weight effortlessly 
as a result of the IBS diet - anywhere from 5 to 150 pounds. In most cases this 
was a happy fringe benefit for people who were much more concerned with getting 
their IBS under control, but some letters are from people who heard about the 
diet from friends with IBS, and started using it themselves purely to lose 
weight without giving up great food.<br>
<br>

<h2>Are artificial sweeteners safe for IBS?</h2> Unfortunately, there is no 
such thing as a &quot;natural&quot; artificial sweetener, and there is no such 
thing as an artificial sweetener that is proven safe for IBS. Virtually all 
artificial sweeteners (as well as other chemical additives and preservatives) 
can provoke gastrointestinal upsets in people with IBS, as by definition we 
have more sensitive guts.<br>
<br>
Saccharine, Equal and Nutrasweet (both 
aspartame), sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (xylitol, malitol), and Splenda 
(sucralose) are the most popular artificial sweeteners in the US. They can all 
cause digestive side effects ranging from gas and bloating to severe abdominal 
cramps and urgent diarrhea. In some cases, they can provoke these symptoms in 
people who don't even have IBS, so imagine what they can do to you.<br>
<br>
 
Sorbitol (and other sweeteners ending in &quot;ol&quot;) are sugar alcohols, 
chemically extracted from fruits and vegetables but very poorly absorbed by the 
gut. It's this malabsorption that results in the low calorie count of sugar 
alcohols, but also in the dramatic digestive upheavals they can cause. Sugar 
alcohols are so likely to cause gas, cramping, and bowel dysfunction that foods 
containing these sweeteners are labeled with a warning about their side 
effects, and cautions against eating a large amount. Personally, I would 
caution you against eating<em>any</em> amount of a sweetener that's virtually 
guaranteed to wreak havoc on your gut.<br>
<br>
 Splenda is the newest 
artificial sweetener on the market, and it's misleadingly marketed as 
&quot;natural&quot; because it's engineered from real sugar. In fact, the 
deceptive &quot;natural&quot; label has resulted in nine consumer class-action 
suits in several states and three federal commission complaints, and is also 
being disputed by the American Sugar Association, which is suing Splenda's 
manufacturer. Splenda is a laboratory engineered altered molecule of sugar that 
replaces three hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine 
atoms. Yum! Splenda is not recognized by the body as a food substance, and it 
passes through the gut without being digested. This is about as far from a 
&quot;real&quot; food as you can get, and there is nothing remotely natural 
about it.<br>
<br>
 Saccharine has had carcinogenic warnings about its use for 
years, and aspartame has generated thousands of consumer complaints to the FDA 
about side effects from its use. Aspartame must also carry a warning label for 
people who do not effectively metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine, one of 
aspartame's components. There aren't any clear cut long-term studies on 
saccharine's or aspartame's effects on gastrointestinal health, but there is a 
lot of anecdotal evidence that they can cause digestive upsets, particularly if 
you're already susceptible to these problems.<br>
<br>
 In general, anyone with 
IBS has a lot to lose and nothing to gain by using artificial sweeteners in 
even small amounts. The risks range from possible to guaranteed cramps, 
bloating, and diarrhea, and as everyone with IBS knows, once you provoke 
symptoms it is much more difficult to regain stability. If you're craving 
something sweet, you're better off savoring a small portion of a treat made 
with real sugar. Sugar is not a health food, and if you want to indulge it 
should certainly be eaten in moderation. For IBS, however, sugar is a much 
safer option than any artificial sweetener.<br>
<br>

<h2>I need to gain weight. How can I do that with the IBS diet? </h2> It is 
hard to gain weight quickly with the IBS diet because it is so low fat. But, 
you should definitely be able to reach and maintain a healthy weight (and you 
shouldn't be losing weight past a healthy point for you). The best thing is to 
snack on the soluble fiber foods all day long, so you're eating as much as 
possible but not in large quantities in one sitting. Try to also incorporate the
<strong>dessert recipes</strong> after lunch and dinner. The sugar, while 
certainly not a health food, will get you some extra calories. Make sure that 
you are adding healthy fats (olive, canola, flax, avocado, nuts, fatty fish 
like salmon and tuna, etc.) and safe proteins (fish, skinless chicken breasts, 
egg whites, soy, etc.) to your soluble fiber staples - not in huge quantities, 
but enough to keep your diet balanced. You want to go low fat but not fat free. 
Once you're stabilized, you should be able to have a high soluble fiber 
snack/meal that is up to 30% healthy fats. If you're at all touchy, keep things 
around 20%. If you cook, try snacking on the<strong>fruit breads and dreamy 
lemon rice pudding</strong>. They're very stabilizing but will add calories for 
you and they're nutritious too.<br>
<br>
 Ironically, weight lifting is also a 
great way to gain and maintain muscle mass and thus body weight. I have heard 
from a lot of people who have found weight lifting to be one of the few things 
that will let them keep their weight up at a safe level. Other forms of 
exercise don't seem to do this, but there's something special about weight 
lifting that really works in this situation.<br>

<h2>Is the IBS diet suitable for diabetes?</h2> It's usually pretty easy to 
adapt the IBS diet guidelines to the needs of a diabetic. As a precaution, one 
of the best things to do is see a local nutritionist or dietician and give them 
the dietary guidelines for both IBS and diabetes that you are following, and 
ask for their guidance. But in general, the high soluble fiber foundation, 
careful incorporation of insoluble fiber, low fat content, and avoidance of 
trigger foods such as red meats and dairy that are crucial to managing IBS are 
very helpful for diabetics as well. Soluble fiber (both foods and supplements) 
not only normalizes bowel function, it also helps stabilize blood glycemic 
levels. Soluble fiber slows the rate of carbohydrate absorption, improves 
regulation of blood sugar, and lowers insulin requirements. Soluble fiber also 
decreases LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) blood cholesterol levels, and therefore reduces 
the risk of heart disease, which is a serious risk for diabetics. The extremely 
low saturated fat content of the IBS diet also helps reduce the risk of heart 
disease.<br>
<br>
 People who are trying to balance the IBS diet with low 
glycemic foods for diabetes can choose brown rice, oatmeal, buckwheat (soba) 
noodles, corn meal (polenta), quinoa, and barley - the whole grains that are 
safest for IBS - plus root vegetables for their soluble fiber staples, instead 
of higher glycemic index foods like white rice or potatoes.<br>
<br>
 One 
common area of uncertainty in following a diet for both IBS and diabetes is how 
to handle sugar and desserts. Most people with IBS do not have problems with 
plain refined sugars (like white or brown baking sugar), which means that 
IBS-safe dessert recipes simply depend on a low fat, dairy-free foundation. 
However, this is an area of much more serious concern for diabetics. 
Unfortunately, simply using artificial sweeteners as an alternative is likely 
to be problematic for IBS. Artificial sweeteners in general can cause all sorts 
of gastrointestinal side effects, from gas and diarrhea to severe cramping. 
This is particularly true for sorbitol, which is the artificial sweetener most 
commonly used in commercial diabetic candies and cookies. In general, be quite 
cautious with<em>all</em> artificial sweeteners, including saccharine, 
NutraSweet, and Splenda, as people with IBS seem to be more sensitive than most 
folks to food chemicals, additives, and preservatives.<br>
<br>
 For home 
cooking, it can be very difficult to significantly reduce the sugar content of 
dessert recipes. Sugar is crucial to the food chemistry of many desserts, 
particularly baked goods. Sugar affects not just the taste but the texture of 
cakes and sweet breads, and altering the sugar content of these recipes to any 
great extent can drastically change the outcome. Often, the best solution to 
this issue is to simply avoid desserts altogether. If this is a sad prospect 
for you because you have a sweet tooth, check with the doctor who manages your 
diabetes about the advisability of having just an occasional small portion of 
an IBS-safe dessert made with real sugar.<br>
<br>

<h2>Is wheat safe for IBS or not?</h2> Wheat causes confusion for many, many 
people with IBS who are unsure about whether or not it is a safe food for them. 
There is no flat yes or no answer to this concern because it depends. Whole 
wheat, with its outer layer of bran, is high in insoluble fiber. This means 
that it's a trigger. That's why whole wheat bread, whole wheat cereals, and 
bran can cause such awful problems for people with IBS.<br>
<br>
 However, when 
you remove the bran from whole wheat you end up with white flour (the regular 
kind you can buy in any grocery store, that you use for home baking breads, 
muffins, etc.). Though this is still wheat flour, it is not<em>whole</em> wheat 
flour, and this makes a world of difference. White flour contains no insoluble 
fiber but it does have soluble fiber, which is the stabilizing force of the IBS 
diet (just picture the thick gel that results when you dissolve a piece of 
white bread in a glass of water). This is why white breads are such great safe 
staples.<br>
<br>
 When you read the ingredients on packaged foods they might 
not specify if the wheat flour used is &quot;white&quot; or &quot;whole&quot;, 
but it's usually pretty easy to tell. For breads, a brief glance will tell you 
if there is whole wheat in it (you'll see little brown flakes). If the bread is 
pure white, like French or sourdough, you're safe. For most crackers, pretzels, 
muffins, etc. only white flour will be used. The exception is health food store 
products, which are likely to use whole wheat. However, they will almost always 
tout this fact so you won't be left wondering.<br>
<br>
 The whole wheat (and 
other insoluble fiber) intolerances so common to IBS are markedly different 
from true food allergies. If you're allergic to wheat, it will make no 
difference if the grain is left whole or refined by removing the bran. In 
addition, with many allergies even minuscule quantities of the trigger, whether 
eaten with other foods or alone, can trigger violent reactions. Fortunately, 
with IBS this is rarely the case, so we just have to be careful with whole 
wheat and other insoluble fibers. If we do take care we can easily and 
frequently eat them in small quantities when they're combined with high soluble 
fiber foods. In addition, with wheat, once the bran has been removed so has the 
risk of an IBS attack, and this gives us great dietary freedom when it comes to 
white breads and other refined wheat flour foods.<br>
<br>

<h2>Can I eat dairy if it's skim or lactose free? What about yogurt?</h2> To 
keep your IBS stable it's best to eliminate all dairy products from your diet 
completely. Dairy is an IBS trigger<em>even if you're not lactose intolerant
</em>. It's simply not just the lactose. It's also not just the high fat 
content of most dairy products that can cause your IBS to flare. Even skim and 
lactose-free dairy can trigger IBS attacks. In addition to fat and lactose, 
dairy contains components such as the proteins whey and casein, which can cause 
severe digestion problems. Though yogurt is traditionally recommended as an 
&quot;easily digestible&quot; dairy product because fermentation has reduced 
the lactose levels, even non-fat versions contain whey and casein, and should 
be avoided. You're much better off using soy or rice milk substitutes for 
dairy. If you want the benefits of the live cultures in yogurt choose a soy 
yogurt or<b>probiotic supplement</b> instead. <br>
<br>

<h2>How can I stay stable while traveling or on holiday?</h2> As usual with 
IBS, the best defense is a good offense, and for traveling this just means 
taking some time to think things through in advance. It will be well worth your 
while to make careful but flexible plans, take some simple precautions, and 
prepare to ask questions or make special requests on your trip to get your 
dietary and stress management needs met. By the way, feeling guilty about 
somehow being &quot;difficult&quot; in this regard is not allowed. Taking care 
of your health is a legitimate priority and that's that.<br>
<br>
 For the 
travel itself, whether car, plane or train rides, bring your own food and a
<strong>soluble fiber supplement such as Acacia Tummy Fiber</strong>. Do not 
assume that the meals being provided by travel services, or the tourist 
restaurants along your route, will offer any safe choices whatsoever. Odds are 
they won't. It's very important that you are extra careful to follow the<strong>
IBS dietary guidelines</strong> from the first day of your trip to the last, as 
travel is virtually always upsetting to your body even if you're not 
immediately aware of the effects. This physical stress can quickly rear its 
ugly head in the form of an IBS attack if you allow it, so concentrate on 
prevention at all costs. The power of precautionary measures is what will 
enable you to enjoy your vacation, not suffer through it.<br>
<br>
 In addition 
to taking dietary precautions, maintain your stress management program while 
traveling, or at least a modified version of it, to the best of your ability. 
You may have to replace morning aerobics with evening walks, find a quiet 
corner of your bedroom to regularly practice meditation or yoga, or ensure in 
advance that if you're staying in a hotel room it's in a quiet location so your 
sleep is uncompromised. Do whatever it takes, and feel free to substitute any 
alternative that works for you.<br>
<br>
 If exercise is key to your IBS 
management as well, make it a priority of your trip. Take your work out clothes 
and shoes with you and unpack them first so they're staring you in the face. If 
you don't have the option of exercising as planned once you're actually on 
holiday, change tactics and adapt - find any variation that works and run with 
it. Maintenance is the key here and flexibility will get you everywhere.<br>

<br> Disruptions to your sleep cycle are common when traveling, particularly if 
you change time zones. Make an extra effort to overcome this potential trigger 
as quickly as possible. If you can, pack your own pillow whenever you travel, 
and you'll likely sleep much better. As a daily rule, try to go to sleep 
earlier than you think necessary and get a little extra rest - this will 
definitely minimize your risk of attacks. Even scheduling a few naps here and 
there can make a world of difference. After all, family holidays are supposed 
to leave you happily well-rested!<br>
<br>
 For special holiday meals, be 
careful with what you drink, not just what you eat. If you're splurging a 
little with wine or champagne, make sure you've had a soluble fiber snack or
<strong>soluble fiber supplement</strong> first so your stomach isn't empty. 
Better still, have the alcohol with your meal or dessert. Don't turn to 
sparkling cider as an alternative to alcohol. The high fructose content plus 
the carbonation is a deadly ticket to digestive distress. The safest drink is 
an herbal tea (such as<strong>peppermint</strong> or <strong>fennel</strong>) 
or just fresh water.<br>
<br>
 Remember that although it's an annual rite on 
some holidays to stuff yourself like a Thanksgiving turkey, too much of any 
food is a bad idea. Keep your digestion stable by keeping your meal size 
reasonable. You can always have seconds later. To help prevent overeating in 
the first place, have a good sized breakfast of a soluble fiber staple such as 
oatmeal or cream of rice. At dinner, take just a little of everything and enjoy 
every bite!<br>
<br>
 Bundle up and go for a walk outside after your meal. 
Keeping gently active will keep your digestive tract functioning properly. Even 
if the rest of the family settles down for a post-meal nap, take that walk 
alone and savor the quiet time.<br>
<br>
 If there's a special treat that you 
know is a trigger but you just can't resist, try this: limit yourself to a 
small amount, have the treat after you've eaten some soluble fiber foods, and 
have a<strong>soluble fiber supplement</strong> with a glass of water right 
beforehand. This will help keep your digestion stable even as you splurge.<br>

<br> Take things easy the day after a big feast. Have light meals and lots of 
herbal tea, get extra sleep, and go for another long walk. Give your body a 
chance to recover from any indulgences and congratulate yourself on staying 
healthy for the holidays!<br>

<h2>What about a diet for IBS and Fibromyalgia?</h2> Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
is estimated to affect 15-20% of the general population, but a much higher 
percentage of people with Fibromyalgia suffer from IBS. Because fibromyalgia 
can require some dietary restrictions in its own right, it's helpful to know 
that these can easily be incorporated into the IBS diet. Acid-forming foods 
such as red meat and dairy that are problematic for the joint pain of 
fibromyalgia are completely avoided when you're eating for IBS. Stimulants like 
black tea and coffee are easily replaced with<strong>herbal teas that actively 
aid digestion</strong>, such as peppermint, fennel, chamomile, and anise. Foods 
in the deadly nightshade family (potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, eggplants) 
bother some people, but not others, with fibromyalgia; if they're problematic 
for you they can simply replaced with other vegetables. Refined table sugar, a 
stimulant which can negatively affect fibromyalgia, is not a problem for IBS 
(though certain sugars, such as fructose and lactose, often are) but neither is 
it helpful, so it can simply be omitted from your diet. Unrefined sugars such 
as maple syrup or honey may be more tolerable, or stevia can be used. Acidic 
foods such as citrus and vinegar are often as problematic for IBS as for fibro, 
and again easy substitutions can be made. Aside from these considerations, the 
general<strong>dietary guidelines for IBS</strong> (high soluble fiber, low 
fat, the careful incorporation insoluble fiber) are quite helpful for 
Fibromyalgia as well.<br>
<br>

<h2>What about taking vitamins and minerals?</h2> Vitamin and mineral 
supplements in general often cause GI problems for people with IBS. Ask your 
local pharmacist about the most tolerable brands of vitamins in their store. GI 
upsets are very common with vitamins, and pharmacists are familiar with this 
request. Prenatal vitamins may be an option, as they are sometimes formulated 
specifically to help minimize the risk of GI side effects. You may be able to 
simply phone in a prescription request for these from your doctor - just 
explain why you need them. You may also want to ask your doctor about 
intraveneous vitamins or vitamin shots if you are unable to tolerate oral 
vitamins.<br>
<br>
Liquid vitamins or powder caplets may also be more tolerable 
than pills. Another thing to consider is the fillers and additives in many 
vitamins; check the ingredients for lactose, artificial colors, and 
preservatives, as many people with IBS are sensitive to even small quantities 
of these substances. A health food store may have a wider variety of 
additive-free vitamins than a drug store. It's often helpful to take two or 
three smaller-dose vitamin/mineral supplements each day instead of one large 
dose. This will not only reduce the risk of GI upsets, but will aid your body 
in absorbing the nutrients as well. If you can't find smaller-dose vitamins, 
try just breaking a regular pill in half.<em>Always </em>take your vitamins 
with a meal, and never on an empty stomach.<br>
<br>
 Vitamin C is particularly 
notorious for causing gas, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Vitamin C is 
ascorbic acid, and as the name implies, it's acidic. When it enters the 
alkaline environment of the lower intestinal tract it can create diarrhea and 
gas. In Germany, vitamin C is actually an approved laxative, so imagine what it 
will do to you if you have IBS. The recommended dose for Vitamin C is generally 
under 2,000 mg. daily. Over that, and you really risk the GI side effects. 
Unless your doctor has recommended otherwise, make sure your multivitamin does 
not exceed one hundred percent of the US RDA for Vitamin C.<br>
<br>
 Calcium, 
magnesium, and iron all require special consideration as well. Calcium can have 
a constipating effect, which can be helpful or hurtful depending on your 
symptoms. Magnesium can have a laxative effect, and this too can either aid or 
exacerbate IBS, depending on the individual. For many folks with IBS, it's best 
to make sure that your mineral supplement is not giving you a megadose of 
either one of these ingredients, but simply a balance of the two. Calcium 
carbonate contains just calcium and no magnesium, and is a good choice if you 
always tend towards diarrhea. If you're IBS-C (prone to constipation), try 
calcium citrate instead, which contains magnesium. With either form of calcium, 
there should be Vitamin D included in the supplement as well for the best 
possible absorption. It's a good idea to take only 500 mg. of calcium per dose, 
as your body may not be able to absorb more than this all at once.<br>
<br>
 
Iron can cause stomach upsets and be quite constipating, particularly if it's 
ferrous sulfate and not ferrous gluconate. Iron also blocks the absorption of 
calcium. If you aren't anemic or prone to anemia, you may well not need an iron 
supplement at all. If you do need to take an iron supplement and you're also 
taking calcium, have these supplements with different meals. Iron is best 
absorbed in the presence of Vitamin C. If you're trying to juggle all of these 
different supplements, it can be helpful to take your multivitamin with C and 
iron at one meal, and your calcium or calcium/magnesium combination with 
Vitamin D at another meal.<br>
<br>
 If you're also taking a <strong>soluble 
fiber supplement like Acacia Tummy Fiber</strong>, don't worry about timing 
your supplement around your vitamins/minerals. Soluble fiber will not interfere 
with the absorption of vitamins/minerals any more than food would. You can also 
take herbal supplements such as peppermint or fennel at the same time you have 
your vitamins/minerals.<br>
<br>
 As a rule, it's always best to get your 
nutrition from as wide a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, 
and nuts as possible. There are many nutrients in whole foods that simply can't 
be extracted into pills. If you're struggling to add enough nutrition to your 
diet, check the IBS guidelines for incorporating<strong>insoluble fiber foods
</strong> into your meals, and take a look at <strong>IBS safe recipes</strong> 
that offer good examples of how to do this. Until you're able to stabilize your 
IBS, you may not want to add in any vitamin/mineral supplement at all (unless 
medically necessary); this will eliminate the risk of the potential GI upsets 
from the supplements.<br>
<br>

<h2>Can I still drink alcohol?</h2> Alcohol is a strong GI irritant (and a 
potential colon carcinogen). Just one drink can definitely trigger IBS attacks, 
especially if you drink on an empty stomach. The worst drinks are those that 
contain other triggers as well, such as carbonation (beer, champagne), coffee, 
dairy (pina coladas, creme liqueurs), or fruit juices that are high in 
fructose. However, even a plain glass of wine or shot of liquor can cause GI 
problems.<br>
<br>
 If you're unsure whether or not alcohol in small quantities 
bothers you, it's best to totally remove it from your diet and get yourself 
stabilized. At that point you can very carefully try (if you still want to) 
adding a little alcohol back in to see how it affects you. Your tolerance will 
likely be greater once you have gotten your gut under control; when that 
happens your GI tract is less likely to be continually hypersensitive, so there 
is reason to have hope for the future here.<br>
<br>
However...what you 
definitely don't want to do is<em>assume</em> that just one drink won't hurt 
you, so you never take the step of completely eliminating all alcohol from your 
diet. By continuing to drink (especially on a daily basis) you'll simply keep 
suffering the consequences. This is a very common pattern with the foods and 
drinks people really don't want to give up - a juicy steak, ice cream sundaes, 
or that favorite cocktail before dinner. This is just human nature and it's 
easy to understand, and I definitely sympathize. But, it's always better to 
know for sure how your body reacts to a potential trigger instead of blindly 
assuming that something isn't bothering you simply because you don't want it 
to. IBS doesn't often respond to wishful thinking.<br>
<br>
 As a general rule, 
unless you're 100% stable and have no IBS symptoms whatsoever when you drink 
(either immediately or the following day), it's a safe assumption that alcohol 
in all forms is likely to cause GI troubles for you. Does this mean that you 
can never drink any alcohol at all ever again? It might - but it also might not.
<br><br>
<em>How</em> you drink as well as what you drink could make quite a 
difference here. A single glass of wine enjoyed after a high soluble fiber meal 
may be very tolerable for you, especially on an occasional (instead of daily) 
basis. Judging by reader feedback on this topic, white wine may be safer for 
IBS than red, and beer seems to be particularly problematic. Having a drink 
when you're feeling relaxed instead of harried can make a difference as well. 
On the other hand, a double martini on an empty stomach after a stressful day 
is practically guaranteed to cause trouble.<br>
<br>
 If you do decide to take 
a chance with alcohol, please make sure to have at least one glass of water for 
each alcoholic drink. Alcohol is very dehydrating, and becoming even slightly 
dehydrated can seriously impact constipation and bloating. If you have an 
inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, it's best to 
avoid alcohol altogether. IBD results in an increased rate of colon cancer, and 
alcohol is known to raise your risk of colon cancer as well.<br>
<br>
 On a 
happy note, cooking with alcohol is usually very tolerable, as the alcohol 
evaporates and any carbonation will totally dissipate. You'll be left with all 
of the flavor but none of the risk!<br>
<br>

<h2>What about coffee? Isn't decaf okay for IBS?</h2> Nope - just one cup of 
coffee is all it takes to completely disrupt the gut of most people with IBS. 
Coffee is a very powerful GI tract irritant - and it's NOT the caffeine that's 
the culprit. Caffeine is a stimulant, so it can aggravate IBS as well, but this 
just means that regular coffee has an awful double whammy.<br>
<br>

Decaffeinated coffee is still practically guaranteed to trigger abdominal 
spasms, diarrhea, and a very unpleasant sense of urgency. Why? Because all 
coffee beans, decaf included, contain an enzyme that irritates the entire 
digestive tract.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, though coffee is known for its 
laxative effect and many folks with IBS-constipation use coffee for just this 
reason, the end result will actually be a worsening of IBS symptoms -<em>
including constipation</em>. The abdominal cramping and GI irritation from 
coffee increases gut motility violently and artificially, which is likely to 
cause a rebound effect of greatly slowed or halted gut motility if you're 
constipation-prone. In other words, the short-term laxative gain from coffee is 
likely to actually exacerbate IBS-constipation in the long-run. If you have 
IBS, your colon contractions are by definition dysfunctional; using coffee to 
irritate your colon to the point of spasms every morning will simply cause more 
severe, and chronic, gut motility problems.<br>
<br>
 Coffee is also highly 
acidic, and acidic foods can aggravate IBS as well as upper GI disorders such 
as GERD. Adding insult to injury, drinking coffee first thing in the morning, 
on an empty stomach, offers absolutely no buffer for the acid, irritant, and 
stimulant effects of the beverage. In addition, mornings are routinely 
stressful for many people, as they're tired, rushed, and trying to get out of 
the house to school or work. Adding a deadly dietary trigger like coffee into a 
hectic morning schedule is virtually guaranteed to cause IBS problems.<br>
<br>

 If you've been drinking decaf, you can quit cold turkey without caffeine 
withdrawal, and you should see improvements in your IBS immediately. Your first 
morning without coffee will likely be your first morning without abdominal 
cramps. If you're used to coffee with caffeine, quitting can trigger caffeine 
withdrawal, and you may suffer headaches for up to two weeks. You can try to 
wean yourself onto a half-decaf, half-regular coffee habit, and then gradually 
eliminate coffee completely. This will help prevent the headaches but will also 
prolong the IBS symptoms, so you'll have to choose the lesser of the two evils.
<br><br>
 If you love coffee (and this is often the underlying reason people 
continue to drink it - they likely know that it's affecting their IBS, but it's 
never easy to give up something delicious) there are some interesting 
substitutes to try.<em>Rocamojo</em> is a roasted soybean drink available at 
health food stores that satisfies many hard-core coffee drinkers.<em>Teeccino
</em> is blend of herbs, nuts, fruits and grains that are roasted, ground and 
brewed just like coffee, and is also available at health food stores.<em>Chai
</em>, an Indian spiced-tea drink (decaf versions are available), is positively 
luscious when brewed with soy or rice milk, and has the same hearty quality 
that coffee offers. You can buy Chai tea bags, loose leaf tea, ormake it from 
scratch with very little effort. Or, you could try something completely 
different, and switch to a helpful herbal tea for your morning (and afternoon, 
and evening) beverage. Peppermint, fennel, chamomile, anise, and ginger are all 
digestion-friendly teas that will actively help - not hurt- your digestive 
health.<br>
<br>

<h2>Is it okay to just avoid fruits, veggies, and insoluble fiber foods 
altogether?</h2> Nope, it's definitely not a good idea to simply eliminate 
<strong>insoluble fiber foods</strong> from your diet. Insoluble fiber is found 
in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, and you can tell 
instantly that these are among the very healthiest foods in the world. If you 
don't eat them you're setting yourself up for serious long-term health problems.
<br><br>
 However, if you have IBS, insoluble fiber is a huge potential 
trigger, and your colon simply can't handle it if you eat these foods with 
abandon. You can (and absolutely must) eat insoluble fiber foods, as often and 
as much as safely possible, but<em>within the IBS dietary guidelines</em>. This 
is crucial not just for normal bowel function, but for overall good health. 
Treat insoluble fiber foods with suitable caution, and you'll be able to enjoy 
a wide variety of them, in very healthy quantities, without problem.<br>
<br>
 
The number one rule here is:<strong>Never eat insoluble fiber alone or on an 
empty stomach. Always eat it with a larger quantity ofsoluble fiber, and you 
will help keep your IBS stable.</strong> <br>
<br>
 The second rule to remember 
here is that while you should be having lots of fresh fruits and veggies every 
day,<strong>make sure you cook, peel, chop, seed, dice, and/or puree most or 
even all of them.</strong> Peeling and seeding fruits and veggies will remove 
the toughest insoluble fiber altogether. Chopping, cooking, and pureeing will 
mechanically break down the insoluble fiber in fruits, vegetables, beans, and 
nuts before you eat it, making it much less likely to provoke problems.<br>
<br>
<strong>If you're just starting to re-incorporate insoluble fiber into your 
diet, you can do this quite safely without having to be afraid of triggering 
symptoms.</strong> The best way to begin is to blend fresh fruits into 
smoothies with a bit of soy or rice milk. Use a base of bananas, mangoes, 
and/or frozen peaches for soluble fiber, and add just a handful of 
strawberries, blueberries, cherries, and/or pineapple. Blend the drink until 
totally smooth and you'll really minimize the insoluble fiber. Blend a big pot 
of well-cooked fresh veggies into soups or sauces, and serve over rice or 
noodles. This is an especially good way to incorporate greens, which are highly 
nutritious but also some of the most difficult insoluble fiber veggies for most 
IBS folks.<br>
<br>
 It's also helpful to make sure you're already eating as 
much of the healthiest soluble fiber foods as possible: root veggies (sweet 
potatoes, pumpkin, beets, rutabagas, carrots, etc.), mangoes, bananas, peeled 
apples and peeled pears, peeled peaches and apricots, and avocados.<br>
<br>
 
See how do you do with brown rice, oatmeal, buckwheat (soba) noodles, corn meal 
(polenta), quinoa, and barley. These tend to be the best tolerated whole grains 
for IBS. Try adding in small amounts of well-cooked and pureed beans or lentils 
as soup or dip additions to your diet. Take this process slowly, and you can 
actually significantly increase your tolerance of legumes. Your body will 
produce the enzymes you need to digest bean sugar (raffinose) if you're eating 
beans on a regular basis. If beans consistently give you problems, try lentils 
instead, as they're often easier to digest. Finely grinding nuts and adding 
them to a soluble fiber foundation is an easy and safe way to incorporate 
another very healthy variety of insoluble fiber. Try adding Beano to all of 
your insoluble fiber foods, eat these foods in tiny amounts at first, then 
gradually and consistently increase your quantities.<br>
<br>
 Try baking easy, 
low fat quick breads such as zucchini bread, carrot cake, pumpkin bread - this 
is a terrific (and delicious!) way to add fruits and veggies safely.<br>
<br>
 
Take this whole process slowly and gradually, and remember that if you've been 
totally avoiding insoluble fiber foods you're going to have to start eating 
them carefully, and giving your body time to adjust. You will increase your 
tolerance for these foods and digest them better the more you eat them, as long 
as you follow the guidelines. It's especially important to emphasize that even 
people with IBS that is constipation-predominant need to be careful with 
insoluble fiber foods. Insoluble fiber is terrific for relieving constipation
<em>if you have a normal gut</em>. If you have IBS, however, then by definition 
you do NOT have a normal gut, and insoluble fiber can trigger symptoms and 
actually exacerbate constipation.<strong>No matter what your specific IBS 
symptoms, you need insoluble fiber for healthy bowel function, so once again, 
the key here is not to avoid insoluble fiber foods altogether, but to<em>
carefully</em> eat as much of them as possible.</strong><br>
<br>
 It can be 
tremendously helpful to take<strong>Acacia Tummy Fiber</strong> or another 
soluble fiber supplement right before you eat insoluble fiber foods. If you 
find herbal teas such as peppermint, fennel, chamomile, or ginger helpful drink 
those with the foods, and try taking<strong>Peppermint Caps</strong> as well. 
All of these things will help keep your gut stable and let you tolerate the 
addition of insoluble fiber foods. For the sake of your overall health, making 
a real effort here is well worth it. As always with IBS, the more you can take 
pro-active steps to prevent problems in the first place, the better off you'll 
be.<br>
<br>

<h2>What about soy foods? Do they cause gas and bloating?</h2> While soybeans 
have a terrific nutritional profile, and soy foods allow people with IBS to 
greatly expand their diet in many ways, all beans contain raffinose, a natural 
complex sugar. The digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract can have 
trouble breaking this complex sugar apart into simple sugars for absorption. As 
a result, in the lower intestine raffinose is metabolized by bacteria, and 
forms carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane; this can cause abdominal bloating 
and gas.<br>
<br>
 Because soybeans contain all the essential amino acids, soy 
foods such as tofu and tempeh are great sources of protein. Soy is also a good 
source of B vitamins, particularly vitamin B6. Plus, whole soy foods are high 
in soluble fiber, which is a necessity for the dietary management of IBS. So, 
can you add soy to your diet without exacerbating IBS gas and bloating? 
Absolutely!<br>
<br>
 The key here is to start your soybean venture with small 
amounts, and increase soy foods in your diet gradually. This will help 
tremendously to increase your body's enzyme production. Your body actually 
produces different enzymes to digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins - how 
you eat literally affects what you're able to (easily) digest. So, as you eat 
more soy or other beans, your GI tract will adapt to larger amounts of 
raffinose and become more adept at handling the complex sugar.<br>
<br>
 
Eventually, once your gut adjusts to a regular dose of raffinose, eating soy 
foods shouldn't cause gas or bloating. But, if you've never had soy in your 
diet, you're going to have to go very carefully as you start. This may mean 
starting with just half a cup of soymilk a day, or a few small servings of tofu 
each week. Take the process slowly and try a variety of soy foods in your diet 
as you gradually increase the quantities. You can also try using Beano when you 
eat soy - this can really help.<br>
<br>
 So, start slow, increase gradually, 
and always have soy with a soluble fiber foundation, and you should be able to 
make good progress. Remember that it's much better to have just a little bit of 
soy on a regular basis than to have none at all. Over a few weeks your gut 
should adjust, and once you're used to digesting it, soy should not be a 
problem. And, it's well worth increasing your tolerance to soy as this will 
give you a great deal of flexibility in cooking. The wealth of soy foods on the 
market (from milks to cheese, ice creams to hot dogs) offer terrific 
substitutes to almost every dairy product and red meat imaginable. Having a bit 
of patience with your body, and giving it time to adjust to digesting 
raffinose, will give you a tremendous payoff in dietary variety.<br>
<br>
 
However, if you feel that you just can't eat soy at all, don't worry - there 
are a great number of rice, almond, and oat substitutes for dairy products 
available, and more are appearing on the market every day. In the end what 
really matters is that you're able to eat well<em>and</em> keep your IBS under 
control. The trick here may be using soy or it may require other substitutions 
- but it<em>never</em> means deprivation! <br>

<h2>Are meal replacement drinks safe for IBS?</h2> Unfortunately, most meal 
replacement or supplemental nutrition shakes have ingredients that can 
seriously worsen IBS. Among the most common brands, virtually all Boost drinks 
contain dairy, and most varieties have artificial flavors, artificial colors, 
and can be very high in fat as well. Ensure brand drinks contain dairy, most 
are fairly high in fat, and some varieties have caffeine and artificial 
flavors. Both Boost and Ensure also typically use corn syrup as a sweetener, 
which can cause problems for IBS folks who are sensitive to fructose. Even 
Modulen, a nutritional drink marketed for inflammatory bowel disease patients, 
contains casein (a dairy protein), milk fat, and a fat content that is far too 
high for maintaining digestive stability in IBS. Modulen also contains 
Transforming Growth Factor-&szlig;2 (TGF-&szlig;2), from cow's milk, which 
doesn't sound like something I'd like to drink.<br>
<br>
 The best choice among 
the canned drinks, though not a great one, seems to be SlimFast soy fruit 
shakes. These contain no dairy and are very low in fat, and they also have a 
decent amount of soluble fiber. Unfortunately, they're sweetened with fructose. 
This means that while they may be a tolerable drink for some, for others who 
are prone to diarrhea, gas, or bloating from fructose, they're not a safe bet.
<br><br>
 The optimal solution for a meal replacement beverage is to simply 
make your own. While this isn't as convenient or quick as buying a canned 
drink, at least you can control the ingredients and ensure that your digestion 
stays stable. Try whipping up a fast fruit smoothie in the blender with soy, 
rice, oat, or almond milk (and additional soy powder for extra protein if you 
like), bananas or mangoes, peaches, cherries, blueberries, or strawberries. 
Choose whatever combination of fruits you find most tolerable, and add a bit of 
sugar, stevia, or honey for extra sweetness. No drink will ever really replace 
the complete nutrition you should get from a full meal, but if you're trying to 
add extra calories to your diet or simply need some fast energy, a homemade 
smoothie is a much healthier and safer choice than any of the commercial canned 
beverages.<br>
<br>

<h2>Is the IBS diet suitable for GERD or acid reflux?</h2> People with 
Irritable Bowel Syndrome are statistically more likely to have upper GI 
problems (like GERD or reflux) as well. The good news is that the vast majority 
of dietary changes that help IBS will also help prevent or minimize heartburn - 
there are just a few special considerations you'll need to take.<br>
<br>
 The 
general IBS diet guidelines of low fat, high soluble fiber, and the careful 
addition of insoluble fiber, are well-suited to reflux as well. In particular, 
going low fat will be very beneficial for IBS and reflux both, so make sure 
you're avoiding the high fat<strong>trigger foods</strong>. While acidic foods 
can sometimes (but not always) bother IBS, they are very hard on reflux, so be 
careful with citrus, vinegars, and cooked tomatoes.<br>
<br>
 Coffee is an 
acidic food that is also a powerful GI tract irritant and it will wreak havoc on
<em>both</em> your lower and upper digestive tract - please avoid it completely 
(even decaf!) Tea is not a safe replacement beverage, however; both black and 
green teas contain caffeine (problematic for IBS) and tannins (not good for 
reflux). Carbonated drinks and chewing gum increase the amount of swallowed air 
in your GI tract, and are also bad news for reflux and IBS both.<br>
<br>

Herbal teas are an excellent option instead, with one big exception: 
peppermint, which is one of the single best herbs for IBS (particularly pain 
and cramping), is such a powerful smooth muscle relaxant (which is why it helps 
IBS) that it can seriously exacerbate heartburn. Choose<strong>fennel</strong>, 
chamomile, or anise teas instead. You may also be able to use peppermint in the 
form of<strong>enteric coated peppermint oil capsules</strong>, which do not 
dissolve in the stomach. Instead, they pass through the digestive tract intact 
until they reach the intestines, so they are often very helpful for people with 
both reflux and IBS who cannot tolerate peppermint in other forms (such as teas 
or candies). If you do have reflux and want to try peppermint oil capsules, 
it's usually best to take each capsule on an empty stomach, about one hour 
before a meal. The &quot;no alcohol, no tobacco&quot; rule for IBS also applies 
to reflux, so if you have both digestive problems it's time to change any 
hard-partying ways (sorry).<br>
<br>
 Sulfur-containing vegetables (garlic, 
onions, leeks, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, asparagus, and Brussels 
sprouts), can produce significant gas in the GI tract and this can trigger IBS 
attacks, and the sulfur can also exacerbate reflux. As with all other fruits 
and veggies, however, these are extremely nutritious foods with significant 
health benefits, so they need to be<strong>treated with caution</strong> but, 
if at all possible, not simply eliminated from your diet.<br>
<br>
 Chocolate, 
in the form of unsweetened cocoa powder used for baking, is usually very 
tolerable for IBS (both the fat and caffeine have been removed). Unfortunately, 
chocolate in<em>any</em> form can worsen reflux, so you may well have to forego 
this particular treat altogether. Why the discrepancy? Chocolate contains 
theobromine (a compound that's also found in tea and coffee), which relaxes the 
esophageal sphincter muscle (just like peppermint), and triggers reflux. So 
chocolate, like peppermint, is one of the few foods that can be perfectly safe 
for lower, but not upper, GI problems. Other foods in this category are hot 
peppers, which contain capsicain. While they can be tolerated, especially in 
smaller amounts, by some folks with IBS, the capsicain can dramatically trigger 
reflux and you'll probably want to avoid hot peppers (such as jalapenos, 
habaneros, cayenne, etc.) altogether. This does NOT mean you have to avoid all 
herbs and spices - to the contrary, most are actually digestive aids, and it's 
only the capsicain family you need to avoid. There's no need to stick to bland 
foods unless you actually want to!<br>
<br>
 Some other general guidelines that 
are helpful for IBS are equally beneficial for reflux, particularly eating 
small meals frequently and taking soluble fiber supplements. Keeping your GI 
tract filled with soluble fiber throughout the day will make a world of 
difference in helping your digestion (both upper and lower) stay stable. When 
it comes to your soluble fiber supplement, be extra careful to avoid citric 
acid, which makes many &quot;orange&quot; flavored supplements taste, well, 
orange. Citric acid is, rather obviously, acidic, and this can make a soluble 
fiber supplement highly problematic instead of helpful for your digestion. 
Choose a plain, unflavored soluble fiber supplement like<strong>Acacia Tummy 
Fiber</strong> instead of a citric acid variety, and you'll get all the 
benefits without any risk.<br>
