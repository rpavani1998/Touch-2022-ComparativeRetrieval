<h3>By LISA LEAKE</h3>

<p> Note to reader: This column addresses the &quot;100 Days of Real 
Food&quot; mini-pledge series, which details 14 weekly steps for cutting out 
highly processed food.</p> 
<p> Let's face it ... our society is obsessed with all things sweet. Which is 
why I have a feeling this might be the most difficult &quot;real food&quot; 
mini-pledge of them all. And even if you only join us for a day or two instead 
of the entire week, I promise it will still be an eye-opening experience 
proving just how sugar-laden packaged foods really are. And I am not just 
referring to white sugar and other refined sweeteners, which we already tackled 
a few weeks ago. I am talking about all added sweeteners even including honey 
and maple syrup. As I've said a thousand times before, no matter what sweetener 
you chose (natural, organic, raw, etc.) &quot;sugar is sugar,&quot; and it 
should always be used in moderation. So what better way to learn how to reduce 
your consumption of sweeteners than to completely avoid them for a few days?</p>
<p> Mini-Pledge Week 12: Avoid all added sweeteners including, but not limited 
to: white sugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, honey, maple syrup, date sugar, maple 
sugar, sucanat, splenda, stevia, agave, fruit juice concentrate, corn syrup, 
high-fructose corn syrup, brown rice syrup and cane juice.</p> 
<p> Nothing sums up the sugar problem our society faces better than these 
startling facts from the recent &quot;Is sugar toxic?&quot; 60 Minutes news 
report:</p> 
<p> &quot;Americans are now consuming nearly 130 pounds of added sugars per 
person, per year. ... Dr. Robert Lustig, a pediatric endocrinologist at the 
University of California, believes the high amount of sugar in the American 
diet, much of it in processed foods, is killing us. And as Dr. Sanjay Gupta 
reports, new scientific research seems to support his theory that sugar is 
toxic, including some linking the excess ingestion of sugars to heart disease. 
(To reduce heart disease) a government commission in the 1970s mandated that we 
lower our fat consumption. 'When you take the fat out of food, it tastes like 
cardboard,' says Dr. Lustig. 'And the food industry knew that, so they replaced 
it with sugar ... and guess what? Heart disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes 
and death are skyrocketing.'&quot;</p> 
<p> It blows my mind when I am looking through cookbooks and I see recipe 
after recipe calling for a tablespoon or even a teaspoon of sugar in things 
like pancakes, soups, and sauces ... is such a small amount even necessary? And 
then at the supermarket product after product, even savory items like bread and 
crackers, can't seem to make it on the shelves without being sweetened as well. 
And I admit I am just as guilty as the next person with my big ol' sweet tooth, 
although my taste buds have definitely changed - for the better - since taking 
our &quot;100 Days of Real Food&quot; pledge. Abstaining from highly processed 
junk food really gave our palates an adjustment, and now just a little bit of 
sweetness seems to go a long way.</p> 
<p> So this week it's time to put you to the test - even if it's only for a 
couple days. This is the perfect pledge to try on a smaller scale because I 
would much rather everyone try it for a short period of time than not at all. I 
promise you'll be surprised at the findings. Good luck!</p>
