<p><b>Harvesting Herbs</b> &#150; <i>Heirloom Seeds</i> eLetter</p> 
<p><i> This is my first year at growing an herb garden. The plants are all 
doing well, but my question is, when and how do I harvest the leaves for use? 
&#150; Peggy Ann in Bogalusa, Louisiana.</i></p> 
<p> After the crop matures, but before they bloom, pick the leaves for fresh 
use early in the morning just after the dew dries on the leaves. You can 
refrigerate the leaves in a plastic storage bag for about a week. For drying 
herbs, cut the stems of the plant just before the plants bloom. Tie the stems 
in small bunches and hang in a dry, airy place or in the shade indoors. If 
drying outside, bring the herbs inside at night to protect from morning dew. 
Herbs can also be dried using an electric dehydrator, following the 
manufacturer's instructions. Once thoroughly dried, store leaves in an air 
tight glass container. Place container in a cool dark location. Crumble leaves 
just before use, not before storage. When harvesting herbs to use the seeds, 
pick heads when mature, but before the seed pods shatter. Dry on trays, 
separate the seeds from the chaff when thoroughly dried, and store in air tight 
glass containers.</p>

<p><b>The Last-Minute, Y2k Count-Down, Just-In-Case, Action List</b></p> 
<p> If you're like I am, just recovering from Christmas, it may only now be 
dawning on you that THIS IS THE WEEK! I find a list of just-in-case preparation 
action items to be helpful, so am taking the liberty of sharing it with you:</p>
<ul> 
<li>FILL BATH TUB(S). To avoid seepage, put a rubber stopper or SaranWrap-like 
plastic over the drain.</li> 
<li>CHECK YOUR FLASHLIGHTS, with extra batteries and bulbs on hand.</li> 
<li>WASH AND CLEAN EVERYTHING REQUIRING WATER. This may include laundry, 
dishes, sinks, water storage facilities, the dog, etc.</li> 
<li>TOP OFF VEHICLE GAS TANK(S). [No matter what Bill Richardson says!] Also 
check oil and other fluid levels and tires &#150; some stations may be closed 
over the entire holiday.</li> 
<li>CASH. Get whatever amount of cash your local bank situation and personal 
comfort level dictates.</li> 
<li>CLEAN &amp; FILL WATER STORAGE VESSELS. Remember to add appropriate 
preservative.</li> 
<li>FILL OIL LAMPS, HEATERS, Etc., with extra wicks and fuel on hand</li> 
<li>TOP OFF PROPANE TANKS (if any)</li> 
<li>FREEZER CONTENT EMERGENCY PLAN. Have in mind what you want to do with the 
contents of your freezer in the event of an extended power interruption.</li> 
<li>PULL APPLIANCE /EQUIPMENT PLUGS for the roll-over period, to protect 
against possible power ups and downs during the transition period. Leave a 
light on 24 hours a day to help determine when power is off &#150; it may 
return with a surge.</li> 
<li>FINALLY, set out all those things you've been going to read &quot;just as 
soon as I have time.&quot;</li> </ul> 
<p> And let's hope we won't NEED any of this! Happy transition!</p> 
<p> Please add to this list by emailing me and this <i> eLetter</i>.</p>

<p><b>Colloidal Silver</b> (many excellent points) &#150; David Litell</p> 
<p> If silver is so bogus, why have many water purifier companies added silver 
for decades to charcoal filters as an agent functioning to slow/stop pathogen 
growth in ye olde charcoal filter??!!! Why haven't government regulatory 
agencies declared these to be a public health hazard and issued cease 
manufacture mandates to those manufacturing companies? Wouldn't the water 
flowing through the filter dissolve some silver for ingestion? Water is a 
solvent. Of course, then, you'd have the health problem of colloidal silver in 
your newly purified drinking water.</p> 
<p> In India, an old, old, tradition is silver hammered into almost 
translucent sheets,and wrapped around foods eaten at wedding receptions. In 
Himalayan mountain areas like Nepal, a thin, translucent silver sheet was/is 
sprinkled on dried fruits for travelers, to facilitate their walk over high 
mountain passes. Silver conducts electricity and temperature rather well. 
Bodies are electromagnetic. Hmmmmm Oh, one does eat the silvered fruit.</p> 
<p> When used with herbs, vitamins, and minerals, for colds, flu and so forth, 
colloidal silver has helped me and other folks I've spoken to, overcome 
pathogenic loading. It even works well as an adjunct to antibiotics and codeine 
cough syrup! (Antibiotic dose reduction)</p> 
<p> I think, like other trace minerals, don't overuse silver. (Enzyme 
activation pathways altered, perhaps?) Employ it as part of a strategy. Address 
symptoms with aggressive herbal energy movement (TCM, Tibetan, Ayurvedic 
styles), homeopathics, and nutritional support (vitamin, mineral, trace 
mineral, enzymes, proteins, amino acids, essential fatty acids, plant sterols, 
glucans, and so forth).</p> 
<p> <b>Your concerns</b> about possible problems and delays next year are 
important to help folks regain self-reliance, and be responsible for themselves 
and their immediate nuclear family. (The Feds don't respond as well as the fire 
department!) We need to move beyond 'water comes from the faucet,' 'electricity 
comes from the wall,' 'St. John's Wort is herbal Prozac,' 'Ginseng is just 
ginsenosides,' 'Ma Huang is ephedrine,' 'Golden Seal is berberine 
hydrochloride,' and so on!</p> 
<p> You may print my comments. The more information the better. (Twelve blind 
men describing an elephant is superior to one or two!)</p>

<p>The <b>Y2K Progress Report Card</b><b> for Federal Departments and

government's<b>internal</b> systems have made no change in rating &#150; still 
<b>B+</b>, however, its <b>&quot;High-Impact Programs&quot;</b> have slipped 
from a C to a<b>C-</b>. In many cases, the federal agency responsible for a 
particular program may be compliant, but its business partners &#150; state and 
local governments, and the private sector who assist in delivering the service 
&#150; are not ready.<b>18 [of the 43] High Impact Programs remain at risk of 
failure</b>.</p>

<p>Horn summarized: &quot;The Year 2000 problem is not limited to January 1, 
2000, but may randomly occur over the next few months.&quot;</p> 
<p><i> Remember, these are all based on <b>self-reported data</b> &#150; 
unaudited by the GAO or any external agency &#150; and we all know that 
computer projects usually take longer to complete than estimated. Check out the 
July 29thGAO report indicating that the 100% completion touted in May is not 
true. Also,<b>end-to-end testing</b> is very important to ferret out data 
exchange problems and other &quot;bugs&quot; &#150;<b>impossible until 
subsystems are complete</b> &#150; which often <b>includes non-federally 
controlled</b> governments and organizations.</i></p> 
<p><b>On The Edge with Burton Goldberg: Step One in Preventing Illness</b>, <i>
Alternative Medicine,</i>November 1999. It usually takes years, often decades, 
of development before degenerative diseases manifest themselves. Using 
alternative medical diagnostic techniques, you can identify trouble brewing far 
in advance, and take steps to avoid disease altogether. Alternative medicine 
gives you the opportunity of seeing a disease coming long before it ever 
develops. It allows you to find indicators of disease at its earliest possible 
phase and then to take measures to halt its progress. This the first step in 
preventing illness.</p> 
<p> Now, we all know it's difficult to get people to spend their money, time, 
and effort in prevention. But let me tell you, it's worth it. I'm 73 years old. 
I have no health problems, no aches or pains, and I feel great, but I'm doing 
Chelation Therapy. Why? With heart disease, most attacks come without warning 
because of conditions that have been quietly building up for years or decades 
without manifesting any symptoms. I tested the condition of my cardiovascular 
system and found that I had some arterial occlusions (blocked blood vessels). 
Further, we now know that &quot;vulnerable plaque&quot; within the artery walls 
is responsible for 85% of heart attacks, and that viruses and bacteria play a 
major role in heart disease. There were a number of factors, therefore, that I 
wanted to change in the quality of my blood. Chelation can do 
this&#150;removing toxins, providing anti-inflammatories, adding nutrients, and 
boosting the immune system.</p> 
<p> Prevention like this means catching the disease before it develops. But 
using EDS you can also avoid an adverse reaction to a drug by testing it before 
you take it. Consider the DPT (Diptheria-Petrussis-Tetanus) vaccine, routinely 
given to young children. Vaccines pose a real danger to our kids; many cause 
serious side effects and sometimes permanent damage or death. It doesn't have 
to be this way.</p>

<p><b>Guava Fruit May Benefit Type 2 Diabetics</b>, <i>Reuters Health </i>via 
<i>InteliHealth Professional Connect</i>, Dec 24th<i>.</i> Hong Kong &#150; A 
traditional Chinese medicine comprised of guava fruit and leaves ground into a 
powder appears to lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes, 
without any side effects, according to Dr. Albert Wing-nang Leung of the 
Baptist University here. A mainland Chinese study of 55 type 2 diabetics 
demonstrated that 80% of patients improved during 2 months of therapy with 2 to 
3 grams of guava extract taken three times a day, according to a report by the 
Diabetes Research Group from Guangxi Hospital.</p> 
<p> &quot;Although the guava preparation is already commercially available, 
we're not sure how well the initial study was controlled and we want to do the 
study again in Hong Kong,&quot; Dr. Leung said in an interview.</p> 
<p> Dr. Leung and his colleagues will attempt to isolate the active ingredient 
from guava extract, which has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine, 
and identify its mechanism of action prior to commencing human clinical trials. 
Dr. Leung was speaking at a Chinese medicine seminar in Hong Kong, which was 
designed to identify areas in which Western and Chinese schools of medicine can 
collaborate in the future.</p>

at the greatest risk of being hit by the Y2K computer bug, according to a 
United Nations-created organisation working with Y2K co-ordinators around the 
world.</p> 
<p> There &quot;remains a medium to high risk that localised Y2K-caused errors 
could adversely affect public health and safety in the early days of 
January,&quot; according to a report on global preparedness by the 
International Y2K Co-operation Centre.</p> 
<p> The health and hospital sector has been slow to address Y2K, according to 
the report by the International Y2K Co-operation Centre, and &quot;this risk is 
most pronounced in developing countries and in smaller organisations 
worldwide&quot;.</p> 
<p> ... The UN is also set to help countries that require long term or 
expensive technical assistance to obtain funding and provide humanitarian 
assistance as needed.</p>

<p><b>UN ReliefWeb Coverage During the Y2K Rollover Period</b>, Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), December 23, 1999. New York/Geneva 
&#150; The United Nations' most comprehensive humanitarian Website &#150;
www.reliefweb.int/y2k/ &#150; maintained by the OCHA, will play a special role 
during the rollover period from 31 December 1999 to 4 January 2000. It will 
expand from its normal coverage of humanitarian issues and events, to also 
serve as the United Nations central Web site for public information and 
analyses related to significant Y2K impacts around the world, with special 
attention to their humanitarian implications.</p> 
<p> ReliefWeb currently provides daily updates on over 40 humanitarian 
emergencies and posts documents from more than 300 cited sources. It covers 
breaking news and provides historical background, maps and more than 5,000 
background links by country. In order to maintain its strict policy of 
impartiality and neutrality, all information is posted without editing its 
content. During the Y2K rollover period, ReliefWeb staff within the OCHA will 
be monitoring events and adding updates to the Web site 24 hours a day. Readers 
may access information specific to the Y2K rollover by logging on to
www.reliefweb.int and clicking onto the Y2K page. This material will also be 
cross-referenced in the country and complex-emergency sections of the site.</p> 
<p><b>Grassroots Information Coordination Center (GICC) to Track Community 
Impact of Y2K</b>, Coalition 2000, December 24th. Anticipating that getting 
good information on Y2K impacts will be difficult, a grassroots effort has 
formed to quickly collect and provide accurate information on Y2K impacts at 
the community level. The Grassroots Information Coordination Center (GICC) 
announced today that they are providing a unique Y2K information resource as a 
trustworthy adjunct and grassroots alternative to government and industry 
information sharing efforts. GICC is providing a forum where volunteers will 
&quot;follow the sun&quot; on New Year's Eve and long afterwards to provide 
late-breaking news of Y2K-related events. This is expected to provide the 
public a truly unique information source as well as a public history of how the 
Y2K event unfolds at the community level.</p> 
<p> In a truly democratic process, the project provides a participatory, open 
space where anyone can post and view Y2K incident reports. These reports will 
subsequently be independently verified and analyzed for trends by GICC 
analysts. Analyst reports will then be included at the forum. Topics are 
arranged by subject category, and sorted by date.</p> 
<p> The web-based forum, located at www.greenspun.com/bboard/  is going live 
on December 28th. GICC has its origins in the efforts of theState of Utah and 
Coalition 2000. Coalition participant Jennifer Bunker is a member of the Utah's 
Governor's Coalition for Y2K Preparedness, and initially suggested using Utah's 
Joint Information Center's to collect the community's perspective of Y2K events 
as they occurred. This suggestion quickly grew to a grassroots initiative to 
monitor the crossover period not only locally but nationally and 
internationally as a way to both understand events as they unfold and as a 
means to help in recovery efforts. Founders of the GICC felt that such a site 
could counter misinformation, as well as provide a viable alternative to other 
information sources.</p> 
<p> No one owns GICC. Rather, it's autonomous, widespread, self-organizing, 
and &quot;chaordic,&quot; cutting across traditional lines of generational and 
political affiliation, and is on the cutting edge of the kind of grass roots 
civic initiatives changing the face of contemporary society.</p> 
<p> Only a little more than a week old, its history is as follows. Seeing the 
need for keeping the public informed and vigilant, Jennifer Bunker of the Utah 
Governor's Y2K Coalition, teamed up with Coalition 2000 founder Steve Davis and 
20 other individuals to build the system and combine resources of many Y2K 
community action groups nationwide. National eyes will be directed at the Utah 
Center, where Senator Robert Bennett (R, Utah) will be watching the world as 
the millennium ticks over.</p> 
<p> Timebomb 2000 System Operator (SYSOP) Diane Squire brought the essential 
SYSOP expertise to the group. Based on her experience with the Timebomb forum 
she was quickly able to establish the necessary web-based sites using Philip 
Greenspun's LUSENET software.</p> 
<p> At the same time, the nascent GICC reached out to the Center for Y2K and 
Society, who've targeted their efforts in support of the vulnerable members of 
our society, and have begun their own Y2K newsqiggl. The Center picked up the 
project's torch and they are now carrying it to America's nonprofit sector.</p> 
<p> Through the publicity efforts of Coalition 2000 and others, plus 
consultation by co-founder Gary Gach, of theFoundation for American 
Communications, GICC is reaching out to the media who are already interested in 
the Utah project due to the involvement of Senator Bennett, the Chairman of the 
Senate Y2K Committee</p>

<p><b>Complementary Healthcare Self Sufficiency for Y2K</b></p> 
<p> In the Year 2000, we will be challenged in many ways: physically, 
emotionally, mentally and spiritually. As we have seen in previous issues, 
these challenges can effect our health. Our goal then, is to establish the 
maximum health state possible for ourselves and our loved ones, which is a 
state of wellness. In addition, we want you to be prepared for the many health 
conditions that occur in your family.</p> 
<p> See our full article summarizing previous wellness and healthcare 
articles, as well as introducing important new first aid kit and preparedness 
suggestions in the<i>Wellness eJournal</i>. This article was updated to clarify 
our Paradigm, add two more books, and remind us about using non-toxic antifreeze

<p><b>Evaluation of Herbal Guides</b>: Wellness Way's &quot;Quickie&quot; 
Herbal Remedies guide and Legion of Light's &quot;Herbal Awareness Guide&quot;
<br> by Rachel Lord, RN, CMT, MH, Owner, Just for Health, Denver Colorado</p> 
<p> Guides cannot be the only source for health information, only a starting 
point or a reminder. As guides go, the Wellness Way &quot;Quickie&quot; guide 
is more detailed and useful than the Awareness guide.</p> 
<p> The Quickie guide is two sided and <i>legal</i> sized, and lists, in four 
columns:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Herb name</li> 
<li>Mechanism of Use &#150; what the herbs does for health</li> 
<li>May Be Helpful In &#150; conditions it may help</li> 
<li>Precautions &#150; important information</li> </ul> 
<p> I liked the explanation under Mechanism of Use, as well as the 
Precautions.. These are important to both understanding and proper care.</p> 
<p> The Awareness guide is two sided and <i>letter</i> sized, and lists:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Condition</li> 
<li>Several herbs</li> 
<li>Other remedies, including dietary products to take or avoid</li> </ul> 
<p> Some people may prefer the condition-to-herb listing better than the 
herb-to-condition listing. However, in this case, important information is 
missing, especially the Precautions.</p> 
<p> Perhaps it would work to use the Awareness guide to find possible herbal 
remedies, then use the Quickie guide to find additional information. Being a 
professional herbalist, I prefer to learn more about the herbs to start with, 
before taking on the responsibility of my own self care.</p> 
<p> I suggest that people only <i>start</i> with an herb guide, then go to a 
next level of literature &#150; a very detailed book or the guides in the
CompWellness<i>Wellness eJournal</i>. Then ask trusted retailer for help in 
selecting the best product containing the herb, or the raw herb itself.</p> 
<p> Remember, don't just treat symptoms &#150; <i>look for base problem</i>. 
My concern about the Awareness guide is that it only tells how to treat 
symptoms. Symptoms are often warnings of serious health problems and just 
covering them up can mask what is really going on and lead to trouble.</p> 
<p> As always with self treatment, if there are no results in a reasonable 
period of time &#150; a couple of days for acute, recent conditions, to a few 
weeks for chronic conditions, then seek help from your primary healthcare 
professional and others to whom you are referred.</p>

<p><b>Colloidal Silver </b>(Continued)</p> 
<p> Dr Andrew Weil's Colloidal Silver comments in the November 15th issue Q 
&amp; A Section created several comments and well as some research on our part. 
Another comment follows:</p> 
<p> I appreciate your newsletter, but in the case of Andy Weil you are merely 
promoting a promoter. His comments that exercise and St. John's Wort are the 
only alternative remedies for depression are ludicrous. There are many others, 
most notably SAMe which has had dozens of double-blind studies done (some at 
our own Veterans Hospitals) going back to the sixties, all with the same 
positive results. Furthermore, St. John's Wort only works on certain types of 
depression making it viable in only about 20% of cases.</p> 
<p> His comments about Colloidal Silver are equally hilarious since my own 
personal experience and hundreds of testimonials are in complete opposition to 
his statement.</p> 
<p> He is also a big promoter of Canadian rapeseed oil (Can-ola) which is a 
highly processed, toxic product that is so fragile when heated it turns into a 
trans fat. And all these restaurants tell us they are doing our health a favor 
&#150; what a joke.</p> 
<p> I don't care if he is on the cover of <i>Time</i> magazine and is hyping 
&quot;alternative&quot; health. To me it seems just like a new version of the 
old special interest &quot;sell.&quot; If you don't know what I mean, who do 
you think is behind the Food Pyramid? I'll bet my money that Weil is on the 
payroll of the herb growers/processors/encapsulators and the Canadian Dept of 
Agriculture.</p>

<p><b>Natural Solutions to Drug-Resistant Infections</b>, by CJ Puotinen, <i>
Well Being Journal,</i>Vol 9, No 1, January/February 2000. When penicillin and 
other wonder drugs revolutionized Western medicine in the 1940s and '50s, it 
seemed as though every infectious illness could be cured with a few pills or 
injections. But half a century after it began, the golden age of antibiotics is 
ending with the alarming news that the drugs that were supposed to save the 
world have instead spawned an epidemic that may destroy it. Click for details.

<p><b>Perhaps the Greatest Immune-Enhancing Supplement Known to Man</b>, by 
Richard McGraw, PhD,<i>Healthlinks Newsletter</i>. We have entered the age of 
immune dysfunctions. Almost all illness is the result of a weakened immune 
system. We have entered the age of the super-resistant germ. Antibiotics can no 
longer stop the onslaught of new and mutating bacteria as you have seen 
reported in the news media.</p> 
<p> We must look to our own immune system's defenses to protect us. A properly

<p> As we have presented, the third component of wellness is <i>attitude</i>. 
When fitness, nutrition, and other forms of physical and spiritual healthcare 
therapies are not working as well as we'd like, it is very important to look at 
the mental aspect of our health. But, our friends and healthcare professionals 
are often reluctant to encourage us in this direction, thinking that they are 
suggestion that we are crazy and need months of therapy on a coach. However, 
recent developments in psychotherapy, such as EMDR, NLP, Thought-Field Therapy 
and others in our<i>Complementary Healing eGuide</i>, can work very quickly or

<p><b>CompWellness Network, Part IV &#150; Professional Healthcare</b></p> 
<p> In the Year 2000, we will be challenged in many ways: physically, 
emotionally, mentally and spiritually. As we have seen in previous issues and 
will see in this issue, these challenges can effect our health. Our goal then, 
is to establish the maximum health state possible for ourselves and our loved 
ones, which is a state of wellness.</p> 
<p> <i>Wellness</i> is a state of high-level health that requires a strong 
effort to reach and a continual effort to maintain. The result, however, is the 
best possibility of good health &#150; now and throughout life. Wellness has 
four parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fitness &#150; your body needs 20-30 minutes of exercise about 5 days per 
week. About 60% of US adults do not exercise enough and 25% not at all; for US 
youth, the numbers are 50% and 15%. See ourFitness articles.</li> 
<li>Nutrition &#150; what and how much you consume effects how you feel, how 
long you'll live, and how you deal with illness and disease. It includes 
healthy foods, supplements and the all-important<i>water</i>. See our Nutrition 
articles.</li> 
<li>Attitude &#150; regular non-physical exercise of the mind and spirit 
effects your mental and emotional state. This integrates your Fitness and 
Nutrition efforts. See ourAttitude articles.</li> 
<li>Help &#150; regular visits to healthcare professionals who assist you to a 
healthy state as well as customize your wellness plan. See our Professional 
Healthcare article below.</li> </ul> 
<p><i> CompWellness Network </i>is applying this four-part program using the 
full spectrum of healthcare modalities &#150;Acupressure through Yoga, 
including conventional<i>Western</i> Medicine. The goal is for you and your 
healthcare practitioners to work together on your<i>wellness plan</i>, using the
<i>least-aggressive</i><b> </b><i>therapies</i> available to treat injuries and 
illness, and to assist you with<b> </b><i>recovery and prevention</i>.</p> 
<p><b>Professional Healthcare</b>, adapted from the <i>Complementary Healing 
eGuide</i>&#153;</p> 
<p> You are in charge of your own health, and Complementary Healthcare 
practitioners are available to help you. The body is a self-healing, 
self-maintaining mechanism as long as there are no interferences in its ability 
to function normally. We've all been admonished to eat right, exercise 
regularly and maintain a good mental and spiritual attitude &#150; very 
important to any health program. However, we often do not know what the<i>right
</i> foods are, what is <i>optimum</i> exercise for us, or how to <i>gain</i> a 
better attitude.<i>Complementary Healthcare</i> modalities help in all these 
areas.</p> 
<p> <i>Complementary</i> means acting as a complement to, or completing, one 
another.<i>Complementary Healthcare</i> is an <i>inclusive</i> term that 
recognizes the interaction of many modalities in assisting an individual to 
wellness. It implies a holistic approach that encourages a cooperative spirit 
among healthcare practitioners and is preferred to the term<i>alternative</i>, 
which creates a separation among healthcare modalities.</p> 
<p> Western allopathic medicine &#150; <i>conventional medicine</i> &#150; is 
associated with therapies that frequently require prescriptions for drugs and 
sometimes surgery.<i>Conventional</i> medicine holds a valuable place in the 
total spectrum of healthcare, especially for emergency situations and 
catastrophic illnesses.</p><i> </i> <i> </i> 
<p><i> Most of the modalities in Complementary Healthcare</i> use a holistic 
approach to healthcare which integrate with conventional medicine, and do not 
replace it.<i>Holistic</i> means treating the whole person &#150; body, mind, 
emotion, energy and spirit. Treating only the physical body allows many of the 
unhealthy patterns to continue. Therefore, many more conventional practitioners 
are learning and practicing holistic methods.</p> 
<p> The goal is for all healthcare practitioners to work together, assisting 
you with<i>recovery and prevention</i> and using the <i>least-aggressive 
therapies</i> available to treat injuries, illness and other conditions. This 
will lead to a complete Wellness plan.</p> 
<p><b>Complementary Healthcare Movement</b></p> 
<p> There is a strong Complementary Healthcare movement in the United States. 
The media, companies, unions, associations and insurance companies are 
beginning to understand that Complementary Healthcare is as equally effective 
as exclusively conventional medicine for the majority of our health conditions, 
with the bonus that Complementary Healthcare is usually less expensive. Doors 
are opening, information is becoming more public, and activity is increasing to 
accelerate this Movement.</p> 
<p> For instance, in March of 1997, the Colorado Legislature passed the 
milestone<i>Alternative Medicine </i>bill. It allows Medical Doctors, under 
certain conditions, to practice non-conventional healthcare modalities<i>without
</i> having to worry about disciplinary actions by the Colorado Medical Board, 
solely on the grounds that an MD practices &quot;alternative&quot; modalities. 
Historically, Medical Boards in all states have taken aggressive action against 
MDs practicing outside conventional<i>standards of practice</i>. Ask your 
Medical Board or legislature what the progress is in your state.</p> 
<p> With that legal worry lessened for Colorado MDs, they can not only 
practice the full spectrum of Complementary Healthcare, but feel more 
comfortable discussing and recommending other modalities to their patients. It 
will take some time to see a major change in the attitudes and practices of 
MDs, but now the door is open. This creates several opportunities on which we 
can all capitalize:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>More cooperation between the conventional medical community &#150; MDs, 
nurses, physical therapists, clinics, hospitals and journals &#150; and other 
healthcare modalities.</li> 
<li>More Wellness Programs implemented in small, medium and large 
organizations &#150; corporations, unions, associations, school districts and 
family businesses &#150; which use the full spectrum of healthcare modalities 
for prevention and cure.</li> 
<li>Reduced healthcare costs. </li> 
<li>More insurance coverage for Complementary modalities </li> 
<li>Creative insurance plans covering <i>conventional</i> medicine at much 
lower rates &#150; initially with higher deductibles and co-payments &#150; 
leaving 50%-60% of normal insurance outlay available for using of other 
healthcare modalities.</li> </ul> 
<p> This will not come easily, but it will come naturally as both the public, 
the media and our health infrastructures discover &#150; first hand &#150; that 
Complementary Healthcare works, and works well(ness).</p> 
<p> Please join the CompWellness Network in this movement. Show others the <i>
Complementary Healing eGuide</i> and encourage them to learn more about and the 
use of Complementary Healthcare modalities for themselves, their families and 
their organizations.</p> 
<p><b>Practitioners</b></p> 
<p> There are many<i> </i>Complementary Healthcare modalities and practitioners
<b> </b>to help you in your quest for wellness. Many modalities are discussed in
<i>Complementary Healing eGuide</i> chapters, in which <i>highly-recommended 
practitioners</i> are featured.</p> 
<p> These practitioners adhere to the same strict <b>standards</b> that you 
should apply to<b>any other healthcare practitioner</b>:</p><i> </i> <i> 
<ul> 
<li>Highly recommended by a trusted source</li> 
<li>Properly educated in their modality</li> 
<li>Registered or licensed in their locality, as available </li> 
<li>Housed in suitable office space</li> </ul></i> 
<p> CompWellness Network practitioners have contributed time, money and energy

<p> Santa Fe, the capital of New Mexico, is located in the North Central part 
of the state and supports about 60,000 people in the city and about 120,000 in 
the metro area. One of the oldest cities in the US, it boasts the oldest 
continuously-used government building, as well as a church and a home in the 
US, though St. Augustine FL makes similar claims about the latter two. On the 
other hand, it is probably one of the most saturated area for art and art 
galleries in the US, sometimes called &quot;Gallery Heaven&quot; &#150; see a 
sampling inExploring, below.</p> 
<p> There are many Complementary Healthcare individual practitioners and some 
headquarters for major Complementary Healthcare schools. Given the population 
size, we were not surprised that only a couple of Complementary Healthcare 
centers can be found in the Santa Fe. However, it has a very strong showing for 
healthfood stores: threeWild Oats and two independents. Albuquerque, at almost 
ten times the size and about 60 miles Southwest of Santa Fe, has many more 
Complementary Healthcare centers. We also visited Taos, a town about one-tenth 
of Santa Fe, to visit Indian drumming foundation &#150; showing the health 
benefits of drumming &#150; and discovered an interesting 
&quot;telecommunity.&quot; </p> 
<p> <b>International Institute of Chinese Medicine (IICM) and Clinic</b></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> IICM was founded in 1984 by Dr. Michael Zeng who came to America from the 
People's Republic of China, bringing with him an extensive knowledge of 
Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Over the past decade, he 
and his wife, Dr. Nancy Zeng, using their 35 years of experience in TCM and 
Western Medicine, have established a program in Oriental Medicine largely based 
on the type of training TCM doctors receive in mainland China. The curriculum 
addresses all modalities which exist in TCM. IICM is a private, non-profit 
institute that has graduated over 400 students in 15 years of operation, most 
of whom have gone on to successful careers in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine 
(OM).</p>

<p><b>The Physicalmind Institute</b><b>&reg;  and The Method&reg; </b></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> We caught Joan Breibart, the founder of this Santa Fe-based international 
institute for Joseph Pilates' physical therapy and fitness work, by phone the 
evening before we visited her facilities. She described their phenomenal growth 
over the last eight years as doubling each year, adding a few thousand teachers 
to the only 200 that existed in 1991. This was coincident with the 
rapidly-growing understanding that<i>fitness</i> is a very important part of <i>
wellness</i>. She has built a fine network of schools as well as an 
international referral service for Pilates teachers and studios.</p> 
<p> After eight years of intense effort to educate and inform the public about 
the benefits of bodymind fitness, the Physicalmind Institute feels we are now

<p> One the way back to Colorado, we stopped in Taos to visit All One Tribe 
Foundation and the historic plaza. We talked to the very-energetic Executive 
Director, Julia Pyatt. She briefed us on the vision, mission, drums, and the 
therapeutic value of drumming, as well as the special soft, wide, Velcro-held 
leather handle for their drums, it can be used and be very beneficial for 
developmentally-challenged people. They are also planning a Year 2000 drumming 
event.</p> 
<p> To affirm their visualization for the coming Millennium, people in cities 
and towns around the world will drum together in unison for the final hours of 
1999. As they drum, an affirmation of their collective vision for Unity will be 
read in every major language of the world.</p>

<p><b>Exploring Santa Fe</b>, by Josephine Hehnke</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> &quot;Dos Equis, please&quot; feeling rather decadent ordering a beer at 
11:30 am but what the heck, we're on vacation, I thought, on the scenic train 
fromSanta Fe to Lamy, New Mexico. We had arrived in Santa Fe Sunday evening 
ahead of a snowstorm raging in Colorado.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> After checking in at the Sunterra Villas de Santa Fe and discovering to 
our delight that we had a one bedroom suite, a quick dash to Albertson's was 
called for to stock up on eggs and potatoes for breakfast the next day.</p> 
<p> At our request on Monday morning, the hotel shuttle took us to the Loretto 
Hotel in time to catch the 9:30 walking tour of the historic downtown area. 
This superlative tour of the capitol building and many historic buildings and 
sights by A Foot, ended back at the Loretto when it began snowing heavily. A 
call to the Villas quickly summoned the hotel shuttle to our rescue.</p> 
<p> We met a friend at the hotel who took us to Cordelia's, a nice 
out-of-the-way restaurant for a leisurely lunch of northern New Mexico cuisine, 
and were asked the New Mexico state question, &quot;red or green?&quot; We 
requested to have the chile served on the side so we had control of the 
spiciness of the dish. Before we finished lunch, the sun had come out and was 
already melting the snow.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Next was a quick tour of a few of the galleries on Santa Fe's famous 
Canyon Road(they close at 5 pm): theCanfield Gallery, the Galerie Zuger, and 
two others displaying the works ofJean-Claude Gaugy and William Vincent. In the 
historic plaza area, we foundPasqual's &#150; the food was good, and it was fun 
sitting at the community table and meeting fellow tourists from Taos and 
California .</p> 
<p> Tuesday, after a late breakfast, the hotel shuttle deposited me at the 
Santa Fe Southern railroad station where we rendezvoused to catch the 11 am 
departure to Lamy. The train travels South through some very scenic country 
arriving at Lamy, a town of 100, at 12:30. A local caterer was set up in the 
train station with frito pies, sandwiches, burritos and chocolate chip cookies. 
After a quick lunch, we set off to photograph Lamy's two sites listed on the 
National Historic Registry: a church, which is being renovated by the 
townspeople on weekends, and a vacant building which at one time served as a 
brothel and since then off and on as a restaurant.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> After returning to town at 3:30 and scouting the city's historic central 
plaza, we decided on theAnasazi Restaurant for supper. We shared the scallops 
wrapped in bacon and the mixed grill of grouper and petite filet. The food was 
excellent but we wanted to do some more exploring of the town and requested a 
recommendation for dessert, and were directed to theSantacafe just a few blocks 
further down the street. The service was impeccable, the dessert superb and the 
ambiance outstanding.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Wednesday, regretfully we had to leave but not before doing some Christmas 
shopping at the plaza's Palace of the Governors where local Indians &#150; 
having gone through a careful screening process &#150; sell their wares. We 
found beautiful gifts for almost all those on our list, then bid a fond 
farewell to Santa Fe, advising, &quot;We'll be baaaack!&quot;</p>

<p><b></b><b>Reader Comments &#150; Colloidal Silver </b>  (Email your 
comments to us atInfo@CompWellness.net)</p> 
<p>The following Q &amp; A from the last issue created several comments and 
well as some research on our part. First the Q &amp; A, then support for Dr. 
Weil's statements followed by reader comments.</p> 
<p><b>Colloidal Silver &#150; Better than Antibiotics?</b>, by Dr. Andrew Weil,
<i>Ask Dr Weil</i>, November 11th.</p> 
<p> A woman who's son had an infected hip joint asked about using 
&quot;natural colloidal silver<i>&quot;</i> Dr. Weil responded &quot;...As far 
as colloidal silver is concerned, I can't see how it would help. In fact, it 
could be harmful. ... The promoters of colloidal silver make some fantastic 
claims: They say their products extend life, protect you from cancer, and cure 
just about anything. They'll tell you that mineral deficiencies lead to a 
weakened immune system and cancer. All of this is nonsense. Colloidal silver 
supplements are also heavily advertised as powerful antimicrobials and immune 
system stimulants, capable of curing up to 650 different diseases. Again, none 
of these claims have been proven.</p> 
<p> At one time, silver products were useful as germicidals, but they've been 
replaced gradually by more effective ones. And no matter what the promoters of 
colloidal silver tell you, the human body doesn't need silver. Safety is an 
issue, too. If taken orally, it can accumulate in the body's tissues and cause 
a disfiguring skin condition calledargyria. Skin pigmentation, especially 
around the nose and mouth, turns bluish, permanently. ... Medical literature 
also contains reports of neurological problems that developed in long-term 
users of oral silver products. ... What you might do &#150; what's better than 
using colloidal silver &#150; is investigate electromagnetic stimulation for 
bone healing, a treatment that is backed byscientific evidence.</p> 
<p><b>Research Inaccuracies</b> &#150; Larry C Ford, MD</p> 
<p> &quot;You may find the following false statement in some Colloidal Silver 
literature:</p> 
<p>&quot;'Laboratory tests in 1988 by Larry C. Ford, MD, UCLA School of 
Medicine, and other researchers showed that destructive bacteria, virus, and 
fungal organisms are killed within minutes of contact with simple metallic 
silver.'&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> In a phone conversation with him just prior to publication of this issue, 
Dr Ford stated unequivocally that he did not say anything of the kind. The 
statements about metallic silver attributed to him are false and misleading and 
were simply forged on his letterhead. He does not recommend that silver or 
other heavy metals be ingested into the body unless approved by the FDA and 
prescribed by an appropriate health professional.</p> 
<p> Unfortunately, this false statement about Dr. Ford's research has been 
quoted and re-quoted across the Internet and in Colloidal Silver literature.</p>
<p><b>FDA Issues Final Rule On OTC Drug Products Containing Colloidal Silver
</b>, Food and Drug Administration<b> </b>Talk Paper<i>, </i>August 17, 1999.
</p> 
<p> &quot;The FDA has issued a Final Rule declaring that all over-the-counter 
(OTC) drug products containing colloidal silver or silver salts are not 
recognized as safe and effective and are misbranded. ... In recent years, 
colloidal silver preparations of unknown formulation have been appearing in 
stores. These products are labeled to treat adults and children for diseases 
including HIV, AIDS, cancer, tuberculosis, malaria, lupus, syphilis, scarlet 
fever, shingles, herpes, pneumonia, typhoid, tetanus and many others. According 
to the Final Rule, a colloidal silver product for any drug use will first have 
to be approved by FDA under the new drug application procedures.</p> 
<p> &quot;The Final rule classifies colloidal silver products as <i>misbranded
</i> because adequate directions cannot be written so that the general public 
can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. They are also 
misbranded when their labeling falsely suggests that there is substantial 
scientific evidence to establish that the drugs are safe and effective for 
their intended uses.&quot;</p> 
<p> The report also discusses argyria, ingredients, application, and the 
extensive the public response process.</p> 
<p><b>Cautions</b></p> 
<p> Research into the literature shows two areas of caution for those wishing 
to use Colloidal Silver based on the compelling testimonials that follow. The 
cautions are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Make sure that the contents of the colloidal silver product is as it says 
by double checking with reputable vitamin and mineral stores</li> 
<li>Be cautious of inexpensive and home-built Colloidal Silver generators 
because they may not make colloids of the recommended size.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>The Best Thing</b> &#150; K Waldrop</p> 
<p> &quot;I have found colloidal silver to be the best thing I've ever used 
for mouth ulcers or canker sores. These used to be long-lasting and very 
painful for me, but one application of CS usually makes them disappear 
overnight! I don't care what else it does. That's enough for me.</p> 
<p> &quot;I understand that you basically have to overdose on the stuff to get 
the blue skin pigmentation. But then too much carrot juice can also turn you 
orange! Moderation is the key to everything.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>In Support </b>&#150; D Castagno, DD</p> 
<p> &quot;... I have used colloidal silver personally for over five years now, 
as have many people I am in contact with on a daily basis. I will agree that 
there are many colloidal silver products on the market and just like anything 
else we should be cautious and be careful not to 'overdo'.</p> 
<p> &quot;Colloidal silver manufactured in the proper manner and ingested in a 
reasonable manner is very safe and very effective. Yes, there is a need for 
silver in our body. Silver in previous years was reported in the heart, spleen, 
kidney, blood, liver, uterus and ovaries in addition to being concentrated in 
the tonsils and thyroid. (Reference-<i>Your Thyroid Can Be A Pain In The Neck
</i> by Nicholas Alexander) and initial references from the US Department of 
Agriculture prior to the 1940's. Silver is also effective against syphilis, a 
pharmaceutical made from silver was used in a very effective manner against the 
very debilitating disease.</p> 
<p> &quot;Properly processed silver is known as ionic-colloidal silver, is 
very effective and affordable to the patient.</p> 
<p> &quot;I could go on. I just thought you may want to know that some of the 
information you were distributing was not true. The above information is not 
based on my opinion and experience alone but days and years of research in many 
medical books. Thanks so much, I am sure your intentions are good, there is 
just so much disinformation in the holistic health field, I thought you may 
have an interest in the above.&quot;</p> 
<p> <i>D Castagno is an independent holistic health researcher and writer, 
working on an article regarding silver utilizing references from the late 
1800's and the early 1900's.</i></p> 
<p><b>Be Informed and Prepared!</b> &#150; Leslie V</p> 
<p> &quot;I agree that electromagnetic stimulation is the better way to heal 
bones. This has been known for years yet the modern medical institutions don't 
practice it; they just hit you with more drugs that they haven't checked for 
their ability to work with other drugs.</p> 
<p> &quot;Yes if you take large doses of colloidal silver, you will get 
argyria. Anyone taking at those levels is very excessive. The recommended doses 
are between 5 and 10 PPM (parts per million) per day in one glass of water. For 
short terms such as sickness, etc you can go up to 100 PPM but go back to the 
low doses as soon as possible, usually within three days (there's that 72 hour 
thing again). You should go off the silver for a week each month to allow the 
system to clear itself. The dang stuff works if taken as directed.</p> 
<p> &quot;Taking it without reading and understanding doses is what gets 
people into trouble and makes the bad name for the stuff. It may not be as 
strong as the new antibiotics but, it won't kill off all the good stuff in your 
body while trying to kill the bad. Silver was used for thousands of years 
&#150; silver spoons and forks and plates &#150; and people knew the little 
amount of silver they were ingesting was helping them. Silver will kill the 
'bad bugs' within six minutes. Anyone can run this test with the standard high 
school lab tests and find out that a small drop of around 5 PPM to a petrie 
dish will kill the bad guys and help the good guys. How this works, I don't 
know. I've read very technical explanations that have convinced me.</p> 
<p> &quot;I put a 5 PPM dose into my water bottle when I fill it up. After 
that is gone, I then switch to my regular water. This gives me a slightly less 
than 5 PPM dose a day. So far the nasal drainage has stopped, I'm feeling 
better and eating less and having more energy. Something must be working so 
I'll stay on this low dosage just as a maintenance.</p> 
<p> &quot;...I read an interesting article in Organic Gardening last night. 
The article was speaking to the fact that just two generations ago we were a 
lot more self sufficient and less reliant on outside sources for food and 
healthcare. All in all we were very healthy and major disasters hurt the 
population less.&quot;</p> 
<p> <i>Leslie V is a computer and communication professional for a major 
cellular company, as well as a very well-prepared citizen.</i></p> 
<p><b>Essential Silver</b> &#150; Floyd K</p> 
<p> &quot;My daughter was given no more than six weeks to live. After several 
days of reading various [on-line] sites, I decided to buy a battery powered 
generator. It worked well, but the three 9 volt batteries dropped in voltage 
very quickly and they aren't cheap[, so I made my own &#150; directions are 
available.]</p> 
<p> &quot;By this time my daughter's condition had deteriorated very 
noticeably. Large sores developed from simple things such as bumping a table or 
a flea bite. She began taking the colloidal silver and within two weeks the 
sores were gone.... Six months ago, during a checkup she was told she had 
cervical cancer. I had her douche with a bottle of CS for a few days. The next 
checkup it was gone. It has been 18 months now since her death was forecasted, 
and she is still going.</p> 
<p> &quot;My wife had colon cancer eight years ago. We did the full medical 
program: surgery, chemo and radiation. It was in remission. Then eight months 
ago it was back. She took 8 oz of CS a day for two weeks. When she went back 
for a progress diagnosis, it was gone.</p> 
<p> &quot;Many of my problems are gone also. The hip the doctors have wanted 
to replace for 15 years is no longer a problem. The Deprouse (sp) constrictor 
that was pulling my fingers in is gone. I can still play the organ. The 
migraine headaches are gone. Also a dozen or more minor things as well.&quot;

<p><b>CompWellness Network, Part III &#150; Attitude</b><br>
 by Tom Goode, 
Arlene Green andRonda Del Boccio</p> 
<p> In the Year 2000, we will be challenged in many ways: physically, 
emotionally, mentally and spiritually. As we have seen in previous issues and 
will see in this issue, these challenges can effect our health. Our goal then, 
is to establish the maximum health state possible for ourselves and our loved 
ones, which is a state of wellness.</p> 
<p> <i>Wellness</i> is a state of high-level health that requires a strong 
effort to reach and a continual effort to maintain. The result, however, is the 
best possibility of good health &#150; now and throughout life. Wellness has 
four parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Fitness &#150; your body needs 20-30 minutes of exercise about 5 days per 
week. About 60% of US adults do not exercise enough and 25% not at all; for US 
youth, the numbers are 50% and 15%. See ourFitness articles.</li> 
<li>Nutrition &#150; what and how much you consume effects how you feel, how 
long you'll live, and how you deal with illness and disease. It includes 
healthy foods, supplements and the all-important<i>water</i>. See our Nutrition 
articles.</li> 
<li>Attitude &#150; regular non-physical exercise of the mind and spirit 
effects your mental and emotional state. This integrates your Fitness and 
Nutrition efforts. See ourAttitude articles below.</li> 
<li>Help &#150; regular visits to healthcare professionals who assist you to a 
healthy state as well as customize your wellness plan.<i>Articles are in 
process.</i></li> </ul> 
<p><i> CompWellness Network </i>is applying this four-part program using the 
full spectrum of healthcare modalities &#150;Acupressure through Yoga, 
including conventional<i>Western</i> Medicine. The goal is for you and your 
healthcare practitioners to work together on your<i>wellness plan</i>, using the
<i>least-aggressive</i><b> </b><i>therapies</i> available to treat injuries and 
illness, and to assist you with<b> </b><i>recovery and prevention</i>.</p> 
<p><b>How's Your Attitude?</b><br>
 by Tom Goode, ND</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> The answer to this question not only determines your success in your 
world, it determines the health of your body. Latest studies in mind-body 
science, have determined that the way we think &#150; our outlook &#150; is a 
strong indicator of how well our cells function in warding off disease. 
Optimists recover faster from surgery while living longer with serious 
diseases, including AIDS.</p> 
<p> In his book, <i>Learned Optimism</i> (Pocket Books, 1998) author Martin 
Seligman, PhD teaches us to dispute the underlying beliefs that result in our 
negative thinking. Yes, even pessimists can improve their thinking and enjoy 
the same health benefits.</p>

<p></p> 
<p> If you want to have wellness &#150; a healthy, balanced life &#150; the 
best place to start is attitude. Let your attitude be the compass you carry 
with you and check frequently to make sure you are on the right path.</p> 
<p> The journey to wellness has many challenges, surprises, twists and turns.

<p>Attitudinal Awareness Guide, <i>Emotional/Attitudinal Causes of Physical 
Problems,</i>Neil Cohen (2-sided, laminated, legal size, $6.95). Developed by 
long-time naturalist, nutritionist and herbalist, through years of research and 
feedback from experts on the mind and emotions, Neil's<i>Guide</i> is a 
in-depth summary of the main organs and parts of the physical body, with their 
associated relationship to specific attitudes and emotions which can positively 
and negatively affect them.</p> 
<p> For instance, on the Immune System, Neil says it &quot;represents 
strength, vitality and enthusiasm on the physical, emotional and mental levels. 
... A strong immune system indicates a healthy level of self-esteem and 
enthusiasm for life.&quot;</p> 
<p> In the summary he says, &quot;Healing ourselves requires that we remove 
the conditions that cause our dis-ease. In this process, we find that the 
causative factors of illness are not strictly physical problems. They can 
relate directly to the mental and emotional life we live as well. Our thoughts 
and feelings are powerful, dynamic forces that influence every aspect of our 
lives and are a major causative factor in either health or dis-ease.&quot;</p>

<p> Healthcare in the year 2000 and beyond will be as much prevention and 
preparation as it will be responding intelligently to symptoms. Building strong 
body systems involves learning some new ways to deal with old problems. It will 
be helpful to reach tip-top shape before Year 2000 challenges start to take 
their toll on our body systems &#150; which may start as early as December. 
Here are some straight-forward answers to a complicated medical problem that 
effects a hoped-for complementary treatment of infection.</p> 
<p>Colloidal Silver &#150; Better than Antibiotics?, by Dr. Andrew Weil, <i>
Ask Dr Weil</i>, November 11th.</p> 
<p> <i>My son was recently hospitalized for an infected hip joint. The first 
antibiotic he was given didn't work. ... What about &quot;natural colloidal 
silver?&quot;</i></p> 
<p> An infected hip joint is a serious condition, and antibiotics, given for a 
long period of time &#150; and if necessary, surgical drainage &#150; are the 
best treatment. I certainly wouldn't recommend going off the antibiotics in a 
case like this.</p> 
<p> As far as colloidal silver is concerned, I can't see how it would help. In 
fact, it could be harmful.</p> 
<p> The term <i>colloidal</i> means the minerals are of a certain size, 
facilitating use by the body. The promoters of colloidal silver make some 
fantastic claims: They say their products extend life, protect you from cancer, 
and cure just about anything. They'll tell you that mineral deficiencies lead 
to a weakened immune system and cancer. All of this is nonsense. Colloidal 
silver supplements are also heavily advertised as powerful antimicrobials and 
immune system stimulants, capable of curing up to 650 different diseases. 
Again, none of these claims have been proven.</p> 
<p> At one time, silver products were useful as germicidals, but they've been 
replaced gradually by more effective ones. And no matter what the promoters of 
colloidal silver tell you, the human body doesn't need silver. Safety is an 
issue, too. If taken orally, it can accumulate in the body's tissues and cause 
a disfiguring skin condition calledargyria. Skin pigmentation, especially 
around the nose and mouth, turns bluish, permanently. Those affected have been 
described as looking like corpses suddenly come to life. Medical literature 
also contains reports of neurological problems that developed in long-term 
users of oral silver products.</p> 
<p> ...What you might do &#150; what's better than using colloidal silver 
&#150; is investigate electromagnetic stimulation for bone healing, a treatment 
that is backed byscientific evidence.</p>

<p><b>Youth Drug Reduction for Safety and Wellness &#150; Start Reducing Now
</b></p> 
<p>Toddlers Overmedicated<b></b><i>, Well Being Journal</i>, 
November/December. American parents are much too quick to give over-the-counter 
medication to their toddlers for such things as sniffles, achy throats or 
queasy stomachs, notes a federally funded study at the National Center for 
Health Statistics. A preponderance of evidence suggests that many medications 
provide few benefits and, in some cases, may even be harmful. &quot;Everyone 
thinks that if you take a pill, you'll get better, and that's a terrible 
message for anybody,&quot; notes Debra Esemio-Jensen, M.D., head of the 
pediatrics clinic at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY. She is 
opposed especially to the use of cold medicines. &quot;I think there are a few 
indications for [use of] Tylenol, but not for cold medications: zero, zippo, 
none.&quot; Pediatrician Anne Gadomski, M.D. also notes: &quot;The high use of 
these medications may be a tremendous waste of money, and many of them 
unnecessarily expose children to toxicity.&quot; (From<i>Journal of American 
Medical Association</i><i>, </i>quoted in <i>Way of Life Newsletter, </i>
September 1999.)</p> 
<p><b>Good Food vs Bad Medicine</b>, <i>Alternative Medicine, </i>October 
25th. In a report released today, the nonprofit Center for Science in the 
Public Interest (CSPI) contended that a review of two dozen scientific studies 
shows that certain foods and food dyes can adversely affect children's 
behavior. CSPI, in a 32-page report titled &quot;Diet, ADHD, and 
Behavior,&quot; charges that federal agencies, professional organizations and 
the food industry ignore the growing evidence that diet affects behavior.</p> 
<p> The report cites 17 controlled studies that found diet can adversely and 
dramatically effect children's behavior. Most of the studies focused on 
artificial colors, while some also examined the effects of milk, corn and other 
common foods. The percentage of children who were affected by diet and the 
magnitude of the effect varied widely among the studies. Six other studies did 
not detect any behavioral effect of diet.</p> 
<p> &quot;It makes a lot more sense to try modifying a child's diet before 
treating him or her with a stimulant drug,&quot; said Dr. Marvin Boris, a 
pediatrician in Woodbury, New York, whose 1994 study found that diet affected 
the behavior of two-thirds of his subjects.</p>

<p>&quot;<b>Physicians Concern About Vaccinations</b>,&quot; <i>Well Being 
Journal</i>, November/December. In a recent study almost one-third of 
physicians fear there is a risk of serious adverse reaction to the pertussis 
(whooping cough) vaccine, and 13 percent thought the same about the measles 
vaccine. Many are concerned about litigation from parents. Many said they were 
unlikely to recommend a third dose of the DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis)

<p>&quot;<b></b>Vaccine Mandates,&quot; <i>Well Being Journal</i>, 
November/December. &quot;Although we recognize that vaccines, in the past, have 
prevented many serious illnesses, it is simply a fact that every insurance 
policy has a premium. Every medical intervention carries both risks and 
potential benefits. The risk:benefit calculation is different for each 
individual patient, and can only be made by the patient (or the patient's 
guardian) in consultation with the attending physician.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;It is the right of every patient to refuse a medical intervention, 
even if recommended by the attending physician, and it is the duty of the 
physician to advise according to his or her own best judgment. Informed consent

internationally recognized in the Nuremberg Code....&quot;</p>

<p><b>Fitness &#150; More on Walking</b></p> 
<p>Exercise and the Diabetic, and a New Great Hint for Walkers, <i>Alternative 
Medicine,</i>October 18th. &quot;High levels of fitness may reduce the risk for 
diabetes in men. Researchers evaluated the relation of fitness and physical 
activity to the onset of diabetes in 8,633 men. The least fit 20 percent of the 
participants had a 3.7-fold greater risk for diabetes, compared with the 40 
percent considered more fit. So here it is again: a sedentary lifestyle may 
contribute to the progression of diabetes. (<i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i> 
1999;130:89-96.) Okay, nothing new here. But now hear this:</p> 
<p> Walking produces both low strain on the tibia and low strain rates, [which 
are lower than running, and] the Stepmaster exceeds every activity tested in 
its potential to affect bone mass. Nothing new here either. But here's a tip 
for walkers:<i>To &quot;turn bone on&quot; it's a good idea to run for 60 
seconds at the start of your walk, and then slow to your usual brisk walk</i>. 
This gives a short blast to the bone &#150; usually enough to turn bone on.</p>

<p><b>Low Cholesterol Can Be Too Low!</b>, <i>Alternative Medicine, </i>
October 18th. Cholesterol levels below 180 are a risk factor for hemorrhagic 
stroke (rupture of a blood vessel)! A controlled study reported from the 
University of Washington in Seattle showed that 230 was the average cholesterol 
level of 3,700 individuals checked.</p> 
<p>There is a steady increase in risk for ischemic stroke (diminished blood 
supply because of obstruction) above 230. Below 180, however, the risk is for 
hemorrhagic stroke. About 10 percent of the population have cholesterol levels 
below 180. Although low cholesterol is necessary to maintain the integrity of 
the vessel wall, levels that are too low lead to &quot;leaky vessels.&quot; The 
Japanese, who typically have low cholesterol levels, have a higher than average 
rate of hemorrhagic stroke.</p> 
<p><b>Unpasteurized Apple Juice</b>, <i>Alternative Medicine, </i>October 
18th. You may already be familiar with the outbreak of E. coli in unpasteurized 
apple juice. It turns out that the E. coli was present on the apples used to 
make the juice, and even the standard procedures at the state-of-the-art plant 
that produced the unpasteurized juices were inadequate to eliminate 
contamination.</p> 
<p> This demonstrates the problems we encounter in food processing. Not only 
are carbohydrates seriously and damagingly concentrated in fruit juices, but so 
are the contaminants! Think of how many apples are necessary to produce one 
glass of apple juice. And think of how much more concentrated the toxins can be.
</p> 
<p> Eat the apple, as nature intended, [rather than drink] the juice. This 
research concludes with a warning that applies to children, the elderly, and 
anyone whose immune system is compromised. Doesn't that mean just about all of 
us?</p> 
<p><b>Year 2000 &#150; More News to Encourage Complementary Healthcare Methods
</b></p> 
<p><b>Medicare hears bleak diagnosis of Y2K readiness, </b>by Steve Woodward, 
<i>The Oregonian,</i> November 12th. The Year 2000 computer problem has lodged 
itself in the weak spot of the nation's Medicare system, which provides medical 
insurance coverage for 38 million elderly and disabled Americans. That weak 
spot is the computerized connection between the nation's 800,000 doctors and 
Medicare's 75 contractors, which process claims on behalf of the federal 
government.</p> 
<p> If the electronics claims system doesn't work, physicians wouldn't be paid 
by Medicare for weeks, if at all [making it tough to stay in business].</p> 
<p> Even in cases where both Medicare and physicians have Y2K-ready computer 
systems, the electronic partners are experiencing failure rates of as much as 
20 percent when they hook their systems together in tests. But the fact that 
worries Medicare watchers the most is that 98 percent of the nation's doctors, 
hospitals and other health providers haven't yet tested their systems with 
Medicare, according to an October 11th report in <i>American Medical News</i>, 
published by the American Medical Association.</p> 
<p> Claims-filing failures wouldn't be lethal to patient care. But significant 
disruptions in the Medicare reimbursement system &#150; either from improperly 
submitted claims or from a surge in paper claims &#150; could create cash-flow 
nightmares for medical clinics and hospitals that rely on reliable Medicare 
payments to keep their operations going.</p> 
<p> HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, is the federal agency that 
oversees the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The agency has warned doctors and 
hospitals that it will not make payments on improperly submitted claims.</p> 
<p> To overcome the information gap, the Health Care Financing Administration 
has launched an all-out, 11th-hour effort to persuade doctors to test their 
systems.</p>

<p><b>CompWellness Network, Part II &#150; Nutrition</b></p> 
<p> <i>Wellness</i> is a state of high-level health that requires a strong 
effort to reach and a continual effort to maintain. The result, however, is the 
best possibility of good health &#150; now and throughout life. Wellness has 
four parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Fitness &#150; your body needs 20-30 minutes of exercise about 5 days per 
week. About 60% of US adults do not exercise enough and 25% not at all; for US 
youth, the numbers are 50% and 15%. See ourprevious issue.</li> 
<li>Nutrition &#150; what and how much you consume effects how you feel, how 
long you'll live, and how you deal with illness and disease. It includes 
healthy foods, supplements and the all-important<i>water</i>. See this issue.
</li> 
<li>Attitude &#150; regular non-physical exercise of the mind and spirit 
effects your mental and emotional state. This integrates your Fitness and 
Nutrition efforts.</li> 
<li>Help &#150; regular visits to healthcare professionals who assist you to a 
healthy state as well as customize your wellness plan.</li> </ul> 
<p><i> CompWellness Network </i>is applying this four-part program using the 
full spectrum of healthcare modalities &#150;Acupressure through Yoga, 
including conventional<i>Western</i> Medicine. The goal is for you and your 
healthcare practitioners to work together on your<i>wellness plan</i>, using the
<i>least-aggressive</i><b> </b><i>therapies</i> available to treat injuries and 
illness, and to assist you with<b> </b><i>recovery and prevention</i>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Nutrition Tips</b> by Jennifer Workman, MS, RD, from her website, The 
Balanced Approach.</p> 
<p> Start thinking about your body the same way you think about your car. What 
would happen if you never changed the oil in your car or put in the wrong gas. 
You wouldn't be surprised if the car stopped running efficiently or you ended 
up calling a tow truck. Learn how to create a relationship with food that will 
maximize your energy, help you lose unwanted body fat and increase lean muscle.
</p> 
<p> The following tips should help whether you are a competitive athlete, a 
person battling a medical situation, or simple trying to increase energy, 
efficiency or manage weight. The goal is to help increase the efficiency of the 
system instead of clogging it up or depriving it of something critical. [See<i>
expanded tips</i> in the article on her website.]</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Figure out your best ratio</b> of protein, (good) fat and 
carbohydrates, based on your activity level and body type [see site for more on 
this subject].</li> 
<li><b>Go back to using real food</b>. Go for quality instead of quantity. Go 
for tasty, as well. Americans may overeat because the food is too plain so we 
go searching for sweets or chips instead of having a warm, satisfying meal. 
Make sure all six of the following flavors are present:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Sweet &#150; sugar, milk, butter, rice, breads, pastas, wheat, sweet 
fruits, honey, sucanat</li> 
<li>Sour &#150; yogurt, lemons, cheese, vinegar, blue cheese</li> 
<li>Salty &#150; sea salt, olives, orsa salt, tamari, soy sauce</li> 
<li>Pungent &#150; ginger, cumin, wasabe (Japanese horseradish), peppers, 
spicy foods</li> 
<li>Bitter &#150; dark green leafy vegetables, spinach, kale, collard greens, 
mustard greens, tumeric, eggplant</li> 
<li>Astringent &#150; lentils, most beans, pomegranate, aloe vera juice</li> 
</ul> 
<p></p> 
<li><b>Eat your main meal at lunch. </b>Your digestive fire is strongest and 
the body is best set up to digest most efficiently between the hours of 10 and 
2 PM. Then have a snack or small meal again with a little protein, then a 
lighter dinner.</li> 
<li>G<b>as and bloating are not normal.</b> There is an 85% digestive disorder 
rate in America. Indigestion is the only way your body can tell you that you 
are eating something that is not easily digested.</li> 
<li><b>Alternate your grains</b>. Wheat and many of the other gluten grains 
&#150; oats, rye, barley, spelt, kamut and corn &#150; are high in B vitamins 
and fiber, but they can add mucous to the system and aggravate the digestive 
tract, causing gas and bloating. Using them once every four or five days is 
probably OK for most, but Americans are eating wheat five times a day or more. 
In most other cultures like Asia, Latin American and India, rice is the staple 
grain, which is much easier to digest and is less allergenic than wheat and 
gluten. Look for grains that are free of gluten and will digest easily &#150; 
basmati rice, quinoa, amaranth, millet, sweet potatoes and baked potatoes 
&#150; in the form of cereal, breads, crackers, cookies and flours.</li> 
<li><b>Drink enough water.</b> Drink at least 64 ounces of water per day 
&#150; more if you are larger than average. This means eight 8-ounce glasses of 
water or two 1-quart&quot;sippers&quot; per day. Pop and beverages containing 
sodium or alcohol actually increase your need for water, not reduce it. Herbal 
Teas without artificial sweeteners are a good substitute.</li> </ul>

<p><b>Nutritional Suggestions</b>, by Philip Incao, MD</p> 
<p> Dr. Incao, a highly-respected family practitioner, gives several 
nutritional recommendations to his patients. Most are very applicable to 
preparing for the uncertainties of the future to achieve and maintain wellness. 
These recommendations are very compatible with Jennifer Workman's 
recommendations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b><i>Fresher, more organic and simpler</i></b><i> is best for all foods. 
Avoid processed and sprayed foods, as well as those with many additives.<b></b>
</i></li> 
<li><b><i>Timing foods</i></b><i>. Digestion and bodies work better by eating 
richer and heavier proteins and fat foods &#150; meat, fish, eggs, butter, 
oils, beans, seeds and nuts &#150; before 3 PM, and fruits and sweets after 3 
PM. Vegetables and grains can be eaten most anytime.<b></b></i></li> 
<li><b>Enjoyment of food</b> is a sign of health. When our body and soul are 
in balance, what we tastes good is good for us. [Fitness and nutrition help our 
bodies, attitude helps our soul &#150; seenext issue.]</li> 
<li><b>Beverages</b>. Vegetable juices are rich, alive, powerful and 
infinitely better than any supplement or vitamin in pill or powder form. Avoid 
additives &#150; corn syrup, sugar, artificial sweeteners &#150; as well as 
soft drinks, coffee, cocoa and alcohol.</li> 
<li><b>Breads</b>. Rye is preferred to wheat, especially white flour products 
such as pastas, crackers and pastries. Also, sourdough is preferred to yeast. 
Refrigerate flour to avoid rancidity. Freeze rye breads that may be ordered in 
quantity.</li> 
<li><b>Cereals[grains]</b>. Preferred: miller, oatmeal and oat groats, brown 
and wild rice, barley, unroasted buckwheat groats, spelt and bulghur wheat, or 
tabouli.</li> 
<li><b>Eggs</b>. Eat sparingly before 3 PM. Avoid eggbeaters, as well as 
powdered and hard-boiled eggs.</li> 
<li><b>Fruits</b>. Unsulpured dried fruits are better stewed or cooked. Avoid 
canned, sweetened or frozen.</li> 
<li><b>Sprouts</b>. Sunflower, broccoli, fenugreek, radish, garlic, clover, 
buckwheat and wheat are good. [Follow safe sprouting procedures, such as 
thoroughly cleaning seeds before sprouting in a sanitized medium. For more on 
food safety, seeBacterial Food-Borne Illness by Colorado State University 
Extension]</li> 
<li><b>Meats</b>. Fish, chicken or turkey &#150; broiled or baked. Use 
sparingly. Avoid other meats and all shellfish, as well as fried, smoked, 
salted or processed meats, and those with nitrites, nitrates, antibiotics or 
hormones.</li> 
<li><b>Soy </b>and<b> Legumes</b>. Soy is best fermented &#150; miso and 
tempeh. Unfermented products &#150; milk, cheese, butter and protein products 
&#150; contain many toxins or antinutrients. Soy and other legumes &#150; 
lentils, beans and peas &#150; can replace animal protein. Use tofu sparingly.
</li> 
<li><b>Oils</b>. Butter and virgin olive oil. Avoid all others, especially 
rancid or continuously heated oils, margarine and shortening. Heat makes oils 
more rancid and more toxic. To fry or saut&eacute;, us a little butter or olive 
oil in the least heat possible.</li> 
<li><b>Nuts</b>. Raw almonds and products, not peanuts or products, or any 
roasted or salted nuts.</li> 
<li><b>Seeds</b>. Sunflower, pumpkin, sesame, chia and flax. Avoid roasted or 
salted seeds.</li> 
<li><b>Seasonings</b>. Chives, garlic, parsley, bay, basil, sage, thyme, 
savory, kelp and vegetable seasonings. To warm the digestive fires &#150; 
cayenne, ginger and horseradish.</li>

<p><b>Complementary First Aid, Part VIII &#150; Breathing</b></p> 
<p>by Tom Goode, ND, Managing Director, International Breath Institute</p> 
<p> Whenever we encounter any need for first aid from being in an accident or 
disaster, to helping our children with a scrape or cut, the first thing to do 
is to focus on our breathing. Slowing and deepening our breathing activates the 
parasympathetic nervous system to restore our body's healing resources &#150; 
including clear thinking so we know what action to take. Continued full 
breathing increases our body's supplies of natural pain relievers and relaxes 
the muscles. Simple to say, easy to do as first aid.</p> 
<p> The autonomic nervous system has two parts, the sympathetic, which 
controls arousal for the fight or flight mechanism, and the parasympathetic, 
which controls relaxation. With slow, full, deep breathing we send the message 
to slow down the heart rate, decrease blood pressure and restore normal 
functioning.</p> 
<p> A 7-Breath Series is simple, effective and easy &#150; try it yourself. 
Breathe ... now. Push your stomach out as you take a slow deep breath and feel 
the energy enter your belly and chest. Pull it up into your shoulders and head. 
Sigh as you it go. Feel better? Do it once more. Breathe in and up, pull to the 
top and release. Go ahead, make the sound &#150; Aaahhhhh &#150; at least in 
your mind.</p> 
<p> As you continue to read, continue to breathe. Breathe slowly and deeply, 
expanding the belly fully. Breathe in an easy, continuous cycle without holding 
the breath. Continue for seven breaths as you read. Pause until you finish the 
seven breaths. Notice how relaxed your body becomes.</p> 
<p> Now breathe in slowly once more, this time imagining that you are pulling 
energy through the feet to a spot just above the head where a pool of energy 
gathers. As you release the breath, imagine the pool of energy above your head 
washing down your spine and flowing out your feet into the earth as you relax 
your shoulders and allow the abdomen to go soft. Pause and become aware of any 
sensations in along your spine and in your body. Repeat the process, imagining 
the breath collecting any tension as it moves through your body and out the top 
of your head to be purified by the sun. As you relax, the pool of bright energy 
washes back down your spine and through your body re-energizing and relaxing 
you. Enjoy the gentle relaxation and when you are ready, take another breath.
</p> 
<p> The larger benefit comes to us with continued practice yielding states of 
profound relaxation leading to physical health and emotional balance. After the 
stress of a first aid requiring incident, a continued practice of breathing 
encourages our body to self-repair.</p> 
<p><i> By practicing the 7-Breath Series in normal stressful situations, you 
will not only gain the immediate benefits, but program your body to quickly 
relax and easily focus in an emergency situation, with just a couple of deep 
breaths. See theIBI website for several additional articles on Dr. Goode's form

<p><b>Exercise in Pregnancy</b> by Julie Edelman, MPT, from the <i>Boulder 
Daily Camera FIT</i>Section <i>Q &amp; A </i>column</p> 
<p><i> Is it safe to exercise during pregnancy? If so, what kinds of exercises 
are OK, and at what level of intensity?</i></p> 
<p> If you are having a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy, exercise is safe, if 
you follow certain guidelines.</p> 
<p> First, you should get clearance from your healthcare practitioner before 
exercising during pregnancy. Once cleared, learn how to monitor your heart rate 
or buy a heart-rate monitor. Your heart rate should not go above 60 to 70 
percent of your maximum attainable heart rate. To figure your range, subtract 
your age from 220. Multiply this number by 0.6 for 60 percent and 0.7 for 70 
percent. Exercise for 20 minutes at this heart rate is universally accepted as 
safe.</p> 
<p> In choosing your form of exercise, do what you enjoy as long as it isn't a 
contact sport. If you ran before your pregnancy, you can continue running 
during your pregnancy until it becomes uncomfortable, usually by month five or 
six. If just starting an exercise program, walking or swimming would be good 
choices.</p> 
<p> Also keep in mind that as early as the first trimester, your tendons and 
ligaments become lax and may be intolerant of high-impact exercise. So listen 
to your body, and don't work through pain.</p> 
<p> You may want to consider a prenatal exercise class or speaking to a 
skilled practitioner about appropriate exercises to prevent or treat the common 
musculo-skeletal pain syndromes associated with pregnancy.</p>

<p> &quot;Natural disasters, which affect all regions of the United States, 
have direct and indirect consequences on health. Each year a thousand or more 
people are injured or killed during disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes, 
hurricanes, floods and winter storms. Conditions after disasters can also 
affect health. Contaminated water and food, and a lack of sanitation can lead 
to disease. Fire hazards, debris and flooding can lead to injuries and death. 
Finally, natural disasters can also affect the mental and emotional health of 
those living through them.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Study: Bed Rest May Not Help</b>, by Emma Ross, <i>Associated Press</i>, 
October 7th. Prolonged bed rest &#150; prescribed by medical doctors for any 
number of ailments &#150; may not always help and can even be harmful, a new 
study suggests. The research, by Australian scientists from the University of 
Queensland Medical School, examined all previous studies on the effectiveness 
of bed rest compared with getting up and moving around more quickly. It 
involved 5,777 patients with 15 different medical problems.</p> 
<p> &quot;Ideas about bed rest seem so entrenched that medical practice has 
been slow to change &#150; even when faced with evidence of ineffectiveness, 
&quot;they wrote. &quot;There are also reports that bed rest is still being 
over-prescribed &quot;after heart attacks and catheterizations, for lower back 
pain and for acute infectious hepatitis.</p> 
<p>FDA: Thousands of Health Devices Not Y2K-Ready by Daniel Verton, <i>Federal 
Computer Week</i>, October 25th. The previous week, a special assistant to the 
director in the FDA's Office of Science and Technology, testified before the 
House Health and Environment Subcommittee. The FDA identified 4,053 biomedical 
products from 214 manufacturers that are not Year 2000-compliant and are 
considered potentially high-risk devices, including: heart ventricular assist 
devices, cardiopulmonary bypass consoles, heart defibrillators, fetal 
ultrasonic monitors, neonatal incubators and dozens of other critical health 
care devices</p> 
<p> The FDA specifically identified 90 products that pose a potentially 
high-risk to patients. These medical devices are characterized by their 
potential for immediate and serious adverse health consequences for a patient 
if they fail to function as designed or expected, including a failure to 
initiate or continue operation. ... Although compliance information on 
biomedical equipment is available through FDA's clearinghouse, the Y2K 
readiness status of equipment at health care providers' offices is not known 
because a significant number of providers did not respond to the surveys.</p>

Unfortunately, the results were not conclusive &#150; a nearly equal 
distribution of pricing and date preferences. But fortunately, we don't give up 
that easily, the Y2K problems in the US could be minimal for the first weeks, 
but there will be enough problems to wake up the populace and the governments, 
creating a much stronger demand in January for alternatives to conventional 
healthcare. Our biggest concerns are in the supply chain for foreign goods and 
trade with Asia, Mexico south, Africa and Eastern Europe. We may be able to 
stumble through the first weeks in hospitals and doctors offices &#150; just 
hope you don't have an emergency &#150; but the medication and medical supply 
stream will soon be interrupted or, at the very least, become extremely

<p> <i>Wellness</i> is a state of high-level health that requires a strong 
effort to reach and a continual effort to maintain. The result, however, is the 
best possibility of good health throughout life. Wellness has four parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Fitness &#150; your body needs 20-30 minutes of exercise about 5 days per 
week. About 60% of US adults do not exercise enough and 25% not at all; for US 
youth, the numbers are 50% and 15%.<i>See article below.</i></li> 
<li>Nutrition &#150; what and how much you consume effects how you feel, how 
long you'll live and how you deal with illness and disease. It includes healthy 
foods, supplements and the all-important<i>water</i>.</li> 
<li>Attitude &#150; regular non-physical exercise of the mind and spirit 
effects your mental and emotional state. This integrates your Fitness and 
Nutrition efforts.</li> 
<li>Help &#150; regular visits to healthcare professionals who assist you to a 
healthy state as well as customize your wellness plan.</li> </ul> 
<p><i> CompWellness Network </i>is applying this four-part program using the 
full spectrum of healthcare modalities &#150;Acupressure through Yoga, 
including conventional<i>Western</i> Medicine. You may be able to modify your 
health insurance coverage to include many of these modalities, or raise your 
deductible to reduce conventional insurance costs, therefore making money 
available for the other modalities<i>.</i></p> 
<p> The goal is for you and your healthcare practitioners to work together, 
using the<i>least-aggressive</i><b> </b><i>therapies</i> available to treat 
injuries and illness, and to assist you with<b> </b><i>recovery and prevention
</i> &#150; your wellness plan.</p> 
<p><b>Background</b></p> 
<p> In mid-1996, <i>Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon 
General</i> brought together the scientific evidence that physical activity is 
good for your health and a sedentary lifestyle contributes to chronic disease 
and disability. One of the<i>Report</i>'s major conclusions is that <b>moderate 
activity helps to combat the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high 
blood pressure, colon cancer, and various other diseases and conditions</b><i>. 
</i>Fitness by itself does not guarantee wellness, but healthcare without 
fitness will definitely fall short of wellness.</p> 
<p> The <i>Report</i> also noted that more than 60% of US adults do not 
exercise regularly and 25% are not active at all. Somewhat surprising, too, is 
the large number of younger Americans who are inactive: 50% do not exercise 
regularly and about 15% are not physically active at all.</p> 
<p> The 1995 <i>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i> &#150; the basis of the 
federal government's nutrition-related programs &#150; included physical 
activity guidance to maintain and improve weight: 30 minutes or more of 
moderate-intensity physical activity on all, or most, days of the week.<i>
Guidelines</i> gives several examples of moderate physical activities for 
healthy US adults, including house cleaning, lawn mowing, painting, gardening, 
and many other normal, non-threatening activities. </p> 
<p> <b>This 30-minute-or-more, seven-day-a-week program is an excellent goal, 
but you can certainly improve your fitness by starting with<i>20 minutes, three 
days per week</i></b>. In addition, you can accumulate the minutes throughout 
the day: two brisk 10-minute walks are equivalent to a 20 minute walk. </p> 
<p> The Surgeon General <i>Report's </i>Executive Summary states, 
&quot;Underpinning<i>Guidelines'</i> recommendations is a growing understanding 
of how physical activity affects physiologic function. The body responds to 
physical activity in ways that have important positive effects on 
musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory and endocrine systems. These 
changes are consistent with a number of health benefits, effecting:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Premature mortality</li> 
<li>Coronary heart disease</li> 
<li>Hypertension</li> 
<li>Colon cancer</li> 
<li>Diabetes mellitus</li> 
<li>Depression and anxiety</li> 
<li>Mood swings</li> 
<li>Difficulty performing daily tasks throughout life</li> </ul> 
<p> So, it's off to the gym for all of us? Not necessarily. As reinforced in 
theQuestions &amp; Answers Section below, <i>walking</i> is a great way to get 
your exercise &#150; it costs nothing and is usually very enjoyable, with 
immediate non-physical benefits. A more aggressive fitness program, especially 
if your back, knees or legs need work, can be well aided by Fitness 
Professionals (included in the<i>Help</i> component of wellness)</p> 
<p><b>Fitness Professionals</b> by Pat Pine, President, National Fitness 
Therapy Association</p> 
<p> The Fitness Professional entering the next century must be prepared to 
answer some key questions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Is a Fitness Professional a personal trainer, a massage therapist, an 
aerobics instructor, a nutritionist, a yoga instructor, or anyone that works in 
the healthcare industry?</li> 
<li>What is the minimum educational requirement to be called a Fitness 
Professional &#150; high school diploma or a two-year, four-year or a post 
graduate degree?</li> 
<li>What areas of study are recognized &#150; Physical Education, Exercise 
Physiology, Kinesiology, Sports Medicine, Health, Corporate Wellness, Others?
</li> 
<li>What type of a certification is required, if any, especially given that 
there are more than two hundred certification bodies for the health and fitness 
club industry alone?</li> 
<li>How does the Fitness Professional compare to other healthcare 
professionals?</li> </ul> 
<p> All of the above questions have been answered for other healthcare 
professions, such as Physicians, Physical Therapists, Chiropractors and Nurses. 
The healthcare industry requires a college degree or specific certification, as 
well as usually licensure or accreditation. In short, it requires specific 
responsibility, accountability and it is usually regulated either by a 
government agency or an accrediting association. The fitness industry, however, 
is basically unregulated.</p> 
<p> The challenge is three fold:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The foremost challenge is to answer all of the above questions that would 
identify the professional requirements to be called a Fitness Professional.</li>
<li>Establish credibility as true healthcare providers within the limits of 
their services.</li> 
<li>A Fitness Professional must be responsible and accountable. </li> </ul> 
<p> That is precisely why the National Fitness Therapy Association (NFTA) was 
formed. NFTA accreditation identifies the professional requirements, 
establishes credibility by adopting nationally recognized standards of 
operation and validates the services and programs provided by the individual 
Fitness Professionals within this industry.</p>

<p><b>Complementary First Aid, Part VII &#150; Survive a Heart Attack</b></p> 
<p><b>Study Finds Sixth-Graders Can Be Taught To Use A Defibrillator</b>, <i>
The Medical Tribune</i>, October 19, 1999. Dr. Gust H. Bardy, a professor of 
cardiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, set out 
to prove that the latest automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are so easy 
to use, even a child can operate them.</p> 
<p> After giving a group of 19 sixth-graders in the Seattle area just <b>one 
minute</b> of instruction on their use, he showed that the children could 
correctly apply the device to a training mannequin. Not only did the children 
properly use the device, they took only 30 seconds longer on average than a 
fully trained paramedic to apply a shock that could restore a heartbeat.</p> 
<p> Every year about 300,000 people suffer sudden cardiac arrest. This is 
caused by ventricular fibrillation &#150; a chaotic abnormal electrical 
activity that causes the heart to quiver in an uncontrollable fashion, 
interfering with the pumping action of the heart. The defibrillator provides an 
electrical shock to the heart that helps to restore its natural rhythm.</p> 
<p> A properly used defibrillator can save a life if it is used on time. You 
have an 80 percent chance of surviving a near certain-death event if you are 
shocked within two minutes,&quot; says Dr. Bardy. The chances of fatality 
increase by 10 percent for each minute of delay, and more than 75 percent 
overwhelming majority of those who suffer cardiac arrest do so inconveniently 
away from a hospital. That is why Dr. Bardy suggests that defibrillators should 
be as common in the home as smoke detectors or fire extinguishers. 
Defibrillators cost about $3,000 each, but Dr. Bardy noted their price has been 
dropping, and he expected they will eventually cost less than $1,000.</p> 
<p> This shows the importance and possibilities for involving youth in 
emergency preparations, as well as the need for handy emergency equipment. Find 
more on this study and its background in the October 19th issue of<i>Circulation
</i>. Additional information can be found at the American Heart Association's 
CPR and AEDs web page.</p> 
<p><b>Controversial Cough CPR Technique</b></p> 
<p><i> We found the following that is being passed around through heart attack 
support group eLetters and emails that is not supported by any medical 
organization that we can find. However, if nothing else is available, it may 
keep you alive until help is found. Use your discretion, and do not recommend 
it as a proven technique.</i></p> 
<p> When alone, a person whose heart stops beating properly, and who begins to 
feel faint, has only about 10 seconds before losing consciousness. However, 
these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A 
deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and 
prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. A breath and a 
cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let up until help 
arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again. Deep breaths 
get oxygen into the lungs, and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep 
the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain 
normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a phone and, 
between breaths, call for help.</p> 
<p><i> Another scenario for use of this technique is that you are in your car 
with no cellular phone and you feel a heart attack coming on. Pop your hood, 
get out of your car, open your hood, go to the back of your car, wave for help 
and cough as above.</i></p>

Info@CompWellness.net)</p> 
<p> Healthcare in the year 2000 and beyond will be as much prevention and 
preparation as it will be responding intelligently to symptoms. It will be 
helpful to reach tip-top shape before Year 2000 challenges start to take their 
toll on our body systems &#150; which may start as early as December. Here are 
some straight-forward answers to typical medical problems.</p> 
<p><b>Walking for Your Life</b> by Andrew Weil, MD</p> 
<p> <i>Is it true that walking is almost equal to jogging as an aerobic 
exercise?</i></p> 
<p> Not only is it almost equal to jogging in terms of getting your heart 
pumping, but I think research eventually will show that it's superior in terms 
of overall health benefits. There are lots of reasons to prefer walking to just 
about any other form of exercise. First of all, everyone knows how to do it and 
it doesn't require any equipment. Second, you can do it anywhere. Third, the 
risk of injury is far less than for any other kind of aerobic exercise.</p> 
<p> With jogging, the risk of injury is high. A person who jogs also is more 
likely to become exercise-dependent or to misuse exercise. People who really go 
for the endorphin high are often tempted to run through the pain &#150; and 
then wind up being unable to exercise at all.</p> 
<p> You may also find that walking can be meditative and relaxing. You can 
take in the sights or listen to a portable radio or CD player. Walking 
exercises your brain as well as your body; it's a cross-patterned movement 
&#150; right arm moves forward with the left leg &#150; that generates 
harmonizing electrical activity in your central nervous system.</p>

<p><b>Fight Depression without Drugs</b> by Andrew Weil, MD</p> 
<p><i> What alternatives are there to conventional antidepressant medications? 
</i></p> 
<p> There are only two alternative treatments for depression. The first is <b>
regular aerobic exercise</b>, which can definitely provide a long-term 
solution. You'll have to do at least 30 minutes of some vigorous aerobic 
activity at least five times a week, and be prepared to wait several weeks 
before you see any benefit. Aerobic exercise is a preventive as well as a 
treatment.</p> 
<p> The second is an <b>herbal treatment</b>, called St. John's Wort 
(Hypericum perforatum), which is much used in Germany for the treatment of mild 
to moderate depression, as well as associated disturbed sleep cycles. Take 300 
mg, three times a day, of a standardized extract of 0.125 percent of hypericum. 
Again, be prepared to wait several months before you see the full benefit.<i>
Note: Don't combine St. John's Wort with prescribed antidepressant medication.
</i></p> 
<p> Changes in your diet may also make a difference. Try eating less protein 
and fat, and more starches, fruits, and vegetables. Make sure you aren't taking 
any other medications that may contribute to depression. These include 
antihistamines, tranquilizers, sleeping pills, and narcotics. Recreational 
drugs, alcohol and coffee can also make depression worse.<i>[See our next issue 
on Nutrition.]</i></p> 
<p> There are some good resources on depression on the Web: Mental Health Net
's depression guide, which lists newsgroups, theNational Institute of Mental 
Health, and various websites. The Samaritans, a non-religious charity in Great 
Britain, runs a newsgroup called alt.support.depression.</p> 
<p> Buddhist psychology views depression as the necessary consequence of 
seeking stimulation. It counsels us to seek an emotional balance in life, 
rather than always seeking the highs and then regretting the lows that follow. 
The prescription is daily meditation, and I agree this may be the best way to 
get at the root of depression and change it.</p>

<p><b>Healing vs Wellness</b></p> 
<p> Tom Goode, ND of The International Breath Institute Boulder Colorado, 
wrote: I find myself increasingly concerned with the seeming trend away from 
holism toward &quot;new and better&quot; allopathic magic bullets in the 
natural genre. Most of the eLetters, magazines and other services to which I 
subscribe are hot to tell us about the latest external treatment for this, that 
or the other without addressing cause in consciousness. As an alternative 
healthcare practitioner in the late 70's and early 80's, I became weary of 
being the healthy &quot;alternative&quot; to self-responsibility and 
exploration of cause. My practice then was of mostly medical (MD) and 
psychological (MA, PhD) types looking for a natural remedy &#150; an 
alternative to drugs for symptomatic treatment.</p> 
<p> Certainly remedies are important inasmuch as it is difficult to consider 
cause when in acute pain or attending to a bleeding wound. However, there is so 
much emphasis on (fearful) prevention and readiness (what to take on a hike so 
that if you are attacked by fruit bats, bears, wild dogs, insects and poison 
ivy you will be ready) that the issue of our creation and responsibility for 
our part in it are totally overlooked. I would hope with all of the wondrous 
cures and treatments that are available today, that at least a few of us will 
be able to assist our clients at looking to the cause, instead of becoming 
hypnotized by the cures and thus miss the message of any illness or accident, 
mishap or misadventure.</p> 
<p><i> We agree, Tom. The best way to heal is to address the root cause and to 
focus on wellness. Many of us are there in our self-care, practices and 
teachings, but others are not. Part of this eLetter's mission is to transform 
all of us from the strictly-allopathic, illness model to a holistic 
(complementary) wellness model. As you can see in this issue, we are working 
the wellness aspect of healthcare into our editorial each issue. I invite you 
to expand this note and pull from other writings to put together an article for 
our eJournal. Breathwork would be especially interesting since it is portable 
and does not require the technological trappings of allopathic and many other 
healing systems. &#150;KJ</i></p>

<p><b>Exercise In Long Sessions or Short Frequent Ones</b><b> for lowering 
triglyceride levels or blood fats</b>, <i>Medicine &amp; Science in Sports 
&amp; Exercise,</i> November 17, 1998. Evidence from a study published in the 
October 1998 issue of the official journal of the American College of Sports 
Medicine (ACSM)<i>Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise</i>&reg; 
indicates that your schedule can dictate the timing of your exercise sessions. 
If lowering triglyceride levels or blood fats is your goal, several short 
sessions may do the job as well as one long bout. In addition, this study 
provides support for ACSM's current physical activity recommendations, but the 
results join a growing scientific literature indicating that shorter, more 
frequent physical activity and exercise sessions can be beneficial to health.<b>
Time need not be the psychological barrier any longer</b>. This information 
supports the ability of the individual to choose short or long sessions and

<p><b>Complementary First Aid, Part VI &#150; More on Herbs</b></p> 
<p><b>Buying Herbs</b></p> 
<p>by Dr. Andrew Weil,&quot;<i>Herbal Medicine Chest&quot;</i></p> 
<p> Growing interest in herbal medicine has stimulated the proliferation of 
both high-quality herbal suppliers and marginal ones. Overall, I think 
standardized extracts are your best bet. The next best are probably tinctures, 
and then freeze-dried preparations of particular plants, such as stinging 
nettles. Whether you buy these in a grocery store or a health food store or an 
herb shop doesn't really matter &#150; as long as they're as fresh as possible.
</p> 
<p> Herbal products are made from plants that have medicinal properties. 
Light, air and moisture all speed the deterioration of dried plants and rob 
them of their usefulness. The most destructive process is oxidation &#150; that 
is, reactions with oxygen that change the plants' chemistry.</p> 
<p> A <b>standardized extract</b> is one that has been assayed to determine 
the content of one or several key constituents. The label will give a 
percentage content of these compounds. Standardization is the best assurance 
that a product contains what it's supposed to contain in amounts sufficient to 
produce a desired effect. Standardized extracts may be liquids or solids.</p> 
<p> Tinctures are liquid extracts of fresh or dried plants in alcohol. The 
alcohol content is high enough to preserve the plant material. Tinctures are 
stable and convenient, but their quality is only as good as that of the herbs 
that went into them. Tinctures should be shaken before use and diluted in warm 
water before being consumed; a typical dose is one dropperful in one quarter 
cup of water, taken three to four times a day with food.</p> 
<p><i> [See more on preparing herbs in the next article]</i></p> 
<p> If you don't want the alcohol, you can look for other liquid extracts of 
herbs in vinegar or glycerin, but these are not as good as alcohol-based 
products.</p> 
<p> Or you can buy your herbs freeze-dried. Freeze-drying is a process that 
uses chemical solvents to extract the plants, then flash-evaporates the 
extracts at low temperature in a partial vacuum. This process removes the 
solvents. The solid residue is then packed into capsules. Freeze-dried extracts 
are far superior to air-dried whole herbs.</p> 
<p> Loose herbs sold in bulk are probably not going to be much more useful to 
your body than grass clippings on a compost heap. If they're finely chopped and 
sitting in a bin, they're likely to have lost all of their medicinal properties 
through exposure to the elements. This is especially true of leaves and 
flowers. Roots and bark deteriorate more slowly.</p> 
<p> Powdered herbs in capsules are probably just as bad. Because they've been 
ground up, they oxidize much faster, since there is much more surface area 
exposed to air.</p> 
<p> In some cases, you can use bulk herbs to prepare teas &#150; for example, 
ephedra stems for asthma, blueberry-leaf tea to regulate blood sugar, cornsilk 
tea as a diuretic or raspberry-leaf tea for menstrual cramps. Again, make sure 
they're packaged well to prevent deterioration. You can check for freshness by 
smelling them &#150; if they smell stale, they probably are not much good.</p> 
<p> Another concern is contamination. Herbs may have been grown using 
pesticides; they might have been fumigated in shipment; and they might contain 
foreign material. Herbal preparations that have been harvested from the wild 
(&quot;wildcrafted&quot;) or cultivated organically are better choices. It 
makes sense to buy brands that advertise the purity of their products. In my 
book<i>Natural Health, Natural Medicine</i> (Houghton Mifflin, 1998), I mention 
&quot;herbal&quot; remedies from Hong Kong that turned out to contain powerful 
&#150; and potentially toxic &#150; pharmaceutical drugs. Look for a list of 
ingredients on the package, and buy from reputable sources.</p>

<p><b>How To Make Herbal Remedies</b></p> 
<p>from: <i>Heirloom Seeds</i> eLetter via Chet Day's <i>Health and Beyond 
Weekly</i>.</p> 
<p><i> It seems that more people are becoming interested in the use of herbs 
as an alternative to store-bought medicine &#150; [read the] various ways herbs 
can be [prepared] medically. &#150; Chet Day</i></p> 
<p><i> </i>Refer to our Herbal First Aid article for information on how to use 
medicinal herbs.</p> 
<p>Infusion</p> 
<p> An infusion is made by immersing a herb in either hot or cold water. Use 
bottled mineral water for best results. For a hot infusion, place the herbs in 
a canning jar along with the mineral water. Put a canning lid on the jar. Steep 
the jar in hot water (not boiling). The length of time depends on the 
individual herb and on whether you're using the leaves, flower head, seeds, or 
roots. Use after the liquid cools. Honey may be added, if desired, to improve 
the taste.</p> 
<p> If kept cool in the refrigerator, the infusion can be saved for 2 to 3 
days. Some herbs (e.g. common yarrow) give off a bitter taste when infused with 
hot water. Make a cold water infusion for these varieties. (Time needed varies 
with the variety of herb used).</p> 
<p>Decoction</p> 
<p> This is more potent than an infusion. Place the dried herb in an enamel or 
glass sauce pan with cold water and slowly bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and 
simmer until the volume is reduced to 1/4 of its original volume. Will keep 2 
to 3 days if refrigerated. The amount of herb and water used depends on the 
variety of herb.</p> 
<p>Powder</p> 
<p> Chop dry plant parts, such as roots, bark or large stems into small 
pieces. Crush the pieces with a mortar and pestle into powder form (a coffee 
bean grinder can also be used). The powder can then be added to drinks and 
soups, or sprinkled on food.</p> 
<p>Tincture</p> 
<p> A tincture is made by immersing a herb in alcohol, which acts as an 
extractive. Place 4 oz of dried herb in a container with a tight lid. Add 1 
pint alcohol that is at least 60 proof (brandy or vodka).<b>Do not use treated 
ethyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol</b>. Let this mixture sit for 2 weeks, shaking 
daily. Strain and store the liquid in a dark jar. Add 5 to 10 drops of the 
tincture to a cup of hot water or tea.</p> 
<p>Ointments and Creams</p> 
<p> Prepare a strong decoction or infusion and add this to a small quantity of 
olive oil. Boil until the liquid from the infusion has evaporated (bubbles 
cease to appear). This will leave the herbal principles in the oil. To make a 
cream from this, simply stir in melted bees wax. Amounts of wax and oil vary 
depending on the variety of herb. These are a few of the ways herbs can be used 
medicinally from the garden.</p> 
<p> For exact amounts of herbs to be used and complete directions for using 
herbs, refer to one of the many books on this subject. We recommend The 
Reader's Digest Handbook &#150;<i>HERBS</i>; <i>Herbal Antibiotics</i> by 
Stephen Harrod Buhner and<i>Natural and Herbal Family Remedies</i> by Cynthia 
Black. All of these can be purchased from ourweb site or found at your local

<p><b><i>Your Top Health Concerns (Ask Dr. Weil)</i></b> by Andrew Weil, MD 
(90 pp, $2.99 or less, with index) If you like your books short and sweet, 
you'll like this one. Dr Weil has compiled several questions from hiswebsite. 
There are several wellness questions that will be helpful to reach tip-top 
shape before 2000 challenges start to take their toll on our body systems 
&#150; which may start in December. You can find many of these questions and 
answers in the &quot;Previous Q &amp; A's &quot;Section of his&quot;Q &amp; A 
Library&quot;on his website. However, this will be easier to read away from 
your main computer. We'll reprint a few in upcoming Q &amp; A sections.</p> 
<p><b>Questions &amp; Answers</b>  (Email <b>your questions</b> to us at 
Info@CompWellness.net)</p> 
<p> Healthcare in the year 2000 and beyond will be as much prevention and 
preparation as it will be responding intelligently to symptoms. Building strong 
body systems involves learning some new ways to deal with old problems. Here 
are some straight-forward methods from member practitioners in Boulder, 
Colorado.</p> 
<p><b>Irritable Bowel Syndrome </b>by Jennifer Workman<i>, </i>MS, RD</p> 
<p><i> I'm a 26 year old male, and two years ago I developed a minor case of 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). I have found that eating regularly helps 
minimize symptoms, but inevitable stress can cause the symptoms to flare with 
all their fury. IBS controls my life, and I'm wondering if there is a cure</i>
</p> 
<p> Statistics show that almost <b>80 percent</b> of the American population 
is suffering from some form of IBS. However, it's manageable once you better 
understand your body's response to foods and stress.</p> 
<p> Ayurveda has many of the answers. The cornerstone of Ayurvedic diagnosis 
and treatment is<i>dosha</i>, a description of three groups of people. In <i>
very</i> simplistic terms:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Vata &#150; lighter build, quick moving</li> 
<li>Pitta &#150; medium, steady mover</li> 
<li>Kapha &#150; heavier, easy-going</li> </ul> 
<p> People who have more <i>Vata</i> and <i>Pitta</i> in their system or 
constitution will respond to stress with symptoms such as anxiety, nervousness, 
fear, heat, frustration, annoyance or aggravation. These emotional symptoms 
will manifest somewhere in the body. In a<i>Vata,</i> it may cause gas, 
constipation or bloating. In a<i>Pitta,</i> it may cause irritation, diarrhea 
or bleeding stools.</p> 
<p> Most people have some food sensitivities &#150; usually to wheat, gluten, 
or soy. These will exacerbate the symptoms and cause even more irritation and 
stress on the colon. These are usually easy to identify. Adding more variety 
and less repetition of the foods that aggravate them can make a huge difference.

</p> 
<p><b>Injuries with Age </b>by Erik Hansen, CFT, CMT</p> 
<p><i> The older I get, the more injuries I suffer and the longer they take to 
heal. Why is this? I like to run, ski and play volleyball &#150; is there 
anything I can do to avoid giving up my sports.</i></p> 
<p> Some people suffer from more injuries and have longer healing periods 
because of lifestyle and sports equipment. How many times in volleyball can we 
dive onto hardwood floors? How many steps can we take with shoes incorrectly 
designed so that our heels strike the ground first with every step?</p> 
<p> If you understand the nature of your sports, it is easy to develop a 
program to maintain your body's composure. Learning how to dive for a ball or 
to fall with the least amount of impact will greatly preserve your body. Find 
professionals who can provide a systematic approach to evaluate the nature of 
each sport and how to maintain harmony with the body.</p> 
<p> Healing is also lengthened by Western lifestyle &#150; not enough sleep 
and meditation as well as poor nutrition and training routines. I recommend you 
have a stool, urine, hormone and blood analysis done. They will tell you how to 
adjust your eating and lifestyle. Next, have your musculo-skeletal system 
evaluated by a personal trainer who is proficient in manual muscle testing and 
has extensive background in postural and biomechanical functions. Then begin a 
systematic program to attain your goals.</p>

<p><b>Water Purification &#150; Update from Issue No 6</b></p> 
<p><i> Suzanne, an essential oil user suggested, &quot;To purify the water we 
drink, we add a couple of drops of lemon oil to a glass of water. This is 
enough to purify it, and also to take away the 'flat' taste the distilled water 
has.&quot;</i></p> 
<p> Laraine Kyle, RN, MSN, CS, CMT, Co-Founder Institute for Integrative 
Aromatherapy and the author of our Aromatherapy First Aid article, 
responded,&quot;... people do this with lemon oil and it is actually OK ... 
Some of the aromatic molecules are water soluble, though if too much is put in 
the water, the essential oil will float on top and cause burning to lips, 
mucous membranes [so only use a couple of drops per glass]. Lemon oil is an 
excellent anti-bacterial.</p>

<p><b>Potassium Iodide</b></p> 
<p>Mick Winter of Napa Valley Y2K wrote in May, &quot;Congratulations on the 
website ... it has great potential. ... Here's a general ... not a 
holistic/complementary question: which is the best substance to take to prevent 
radioactive iodine from entering the thyroid: potassium iodide or potassium 
iodate?&quot; Given the nuclear accident in Japan, it has become a very 
important holistic/complementary question since we need this substance as a 
preventative measure. The answer is<i>iodide</i> and our WebMistress and 
well-prepared country woman,Leslie Varnicle, says &quot;it may be available 
locally, but we found it for $4.95 per 2-week-supply per person atBePrepared.com

<p><b>Y2K Connections</b></p> 
<p>Jan Nickerson, creator of Y2K Connections, a community-building game, 
thanked us &quot;for offering such a great service, &quot;and pointed out a 
couple of the game's Healthcare scenarios:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&quot;How do the uncertainties of Y2K breakdowns present an opportunity to 
create what you want for your health? ... It sounds to me like your eLetter and 
philosophy go well beyond Y2K, to<i>creating</i> opportunities for one's 
health.&quot;</li> 
<li>&quot;What first aid supplies and manual do you want to have on hand, in 
case you aren't able to get to a drug store or medical clinic for some time to 
come? &#150; again, it sounds to me like your email eLetter and website 
information are exactly the kind of 'manual' we had in mind when we crafted 
this scenario.&quot;</li> </ul>

</p> 
<p>The 100-Day Report by the US Senate Special Committee On The Year 2000 
Technology Problem describes the state of the country and the world at 100 days 
from end of the year. It paints a poor picture of our readiness, with<b>
healthcare</b> included in the least prepared sectors along with local 
governments, small business and education. The Executive Summary reports:</p> 
<p> Y2K compliance is mixed in the healthcare industry, which is characterized 
by extensive decentralization of operations. Some segments, such as 
pharmaceutical manufacturing, wholesaling and distribution, and large-scale 
hospitals, have invested the managerial and financial resources to remediate 
and test for most Y2K problems. Conversely, rural and inner city hospitals, 
nursing homes, and physicians' offices have particularly high Y2K risk exposure 
due to limited technical/managerial resources and lack of awareness.</p> 
<p> The Committee remains concerned about the hundreds of different types of 
electronic biomedical devices used by all healthcare providers. Most in the 
medical device industry have identified the Y2K compliance of their products, 
but end-to-end testing within a facility has not been the norm. The difficulty 
in testing and limited resources available for replacement of devices at some 
institutions contributes to the Committee's concern and raises serious patient 
safety questions.</p> 
<p> Healthcare is the nation's single largest industry, generating $1.5 
trillion annually. The US has 6,000 hospitals, 800,000 doctors in 50,000 
offices and 16,000 nursing homes, as well as 2,000 biomedical equipment 
manufacturers and numerous healthcare insurers in the public 
(Medicare/Medicaid) and private sectors. All of these entities are highly 
automated and, thus are highly exposed to Y2K risk.<b>On a positive note</b>, 
the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the federal agency that 
oversees Medicare payments, has made a nationwide effort to ensure that its 
health claims payments system is Y2K compliant.</p> 
<p><b>Worries About Medicare Providers</b> (Stephen Barr, <i>Washington Post
</i>) via <i>Sanger &amp; Shannon's Review of Y2K News Reports</i> In testimony 
by the General Accounting Office before the House Government Reform 
subcommittee chaired by Rep. Stephen Horn (R-Calif.), the GAO says that 
&quot;Forty of 69 Medicare contractors &#150; usually insurance companies 
&#150; have tested with less than one percent of the doctors, hospitals and 
health providers who submit claims for payments.&quot; Separately, &quot;The 
Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees the Medicare program, has 
sent letters to more than 1.1 million health plans and providers stressing the 
importance of Y2K readiness ... But it appears that doctors, hospitals and 
nursing homes have been reluctant to engage in Y2K tests and demonstrate their 
compliance, according to congressional auditors. Gary Christoph, the chief 
technology officer at HCFA, acknowledges in his draft testimony that 'we now 
see our greatest risk to the program as the uncertainties in the readiness of 
our partners, namely, our Medicare providers ... Virtually all of the surveys 
of provider readiness have fairly low response rates, and the anonymous 
responses are self-reported data, which may be overly optimistic. ... We 
continue to have serious, ongoing concerns about the ability of some Medicare 
providers to successfully meet this challenge.'&quot;</p> 
<p><b>AIDS Pandemic Predicted To Worsen In 21st Century</b> (September 30, 
Reuters Health/InteliHealth Professional Connect) Global efforts aimed at 
preventing HIV infection must be intensified, as effective treatment becomes a 
less and less feasible option for controlling this disease on a worldwide 
scale, according to Dr. Anthony S Fauci. &quot;Unless methods of prevention, 
with or without a vaccine are successful, the worst of the global pandemic will 
occur in the 21st century, &quot;the director of National Institutes of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in Bethesda, Maryland, predicts in a special

<p><b>Many Diabetes Patients are Harmed when they Skip Their Oral Medication
</b> (<i>The Medical Tribune/InteliHealth Connect</i>) In the news article last 
issue,&quot;Vegan Diet Helps Control Type 2 [adult-onset] Diabetes &quot;we 
learned that a strict vegetarian 'vegan' diet can help improve blood sugar 
control. Some people, however, prefer oral medications, but, according to this 
article, &quot;an alarming number of diabetes patients [such as those in this] 
United Kingdom [study], aren't taking[their oral medications], risking their 
health and even their lives... Discontinuing oral medication can cause blood 
sugar levels to rise [which over time] can greatly increase the risk of 
diabetes complications such as eye diseases and kidney problems. The risk of 
heart disease is increased two to four times in people with diabetes.&quot; 
Therefore, if you or your loved ones are on oral diabetes medications, stock up 
for an extra week or two before the end of the year.</p>

<p><i> This issue features a diagnostic technique, Iridology &#150; using the

damaged or weak organs and body systems.</i></p>

<p></p> 
<p>Iridology is the practice of looking at the fiber, color, texture and 
pattern in the iris of the eye to determine whether a person is exhibiting any 
inflammation, stress or inherent weaknesses in the overall body constitution. 
It was discovered by two European doctors in the 1860's. Since that time, 
Iridology has been used widely in Europe and Asia, as a single tool for 
determining a person's health or in conjunction with other diagnostic 
modalities.</p> 
<p> Dr. Bernard Jensen brought Iridology to the United States around 1935. As 
a Chiropractor and Herbalist, Dr. Jensen has documented thousands of case 
histories and therapies using Iridology as part of his routine examination of a 
client. From his work we find that the<i>eye truly is the window of the soul.
</i> The eye chart he developed is the one used worldwide today. See the 
following &quot;Chart to Iridology.&quot;<i> This chart is used as an example 
only; it has been updated regularly by Bernard Jensen International.</i></p> 
<p> Some Iridologists take a photograph of the eye and compare it to the eye 
chart. Other Iridologists use a penlight and magnifying glass to look into a 
client's eyes while seated comfortably in a chair.</p> 
<p><i> Have someone else do this for you if an Iridologist is not available. 
Use a strong, but not bright light on one or, if possible, both sides &#150; do 
not use your camera flash. &#150; KJ</i></p> 
<p> In either case, the eye analysis will show whether a client has a 
generally good constitution or a poor one.</p> 
<p> We know from research using electron microscopes, that each fiber in the 
iris is actually a nerve sheath containing more than 20,000<i>nerve fibers</i>. 
Each of the nerve fibers travels through the central nervous system to every 
organ, system and area of the body. As such, each region of the iris represents 
an area of the body.</p> 
<p> The patterns, structures, colors and degree of lightness and darkness in 
the iris will reveal the health of that particular area, including: irritation, 
injury or degeneration of the tissues and organs.</p> 
<p> Iridologists [and you] can use herbs known to feed a particular organ or 
system, as well as vitamins and minerals, to enhance the body's own healing 
mechanisms. Even people with hopeless conditions have found relief using the 
information discovered through an Iridology exam.</p> 
<p> Iridology is a simple, painless and non-intrusive tool for assessing 
health and well-being. It can be an integral part of preventative healthcare, 
[and helps clarify your particular conditions on your own].</p>

<p> In the last issue, we reported on using a replacement Super Stearasy 
&quot;ceramic candle&quot; secured upright in a five gallon plastic bucket that 
drips into a jar in another bucket.Mike Jones, a Technical Writer at QCI 
suggested attaching a small hose that screws into the bottom of the ceramic 
candle, laying it sideways on the bottom of the bucket then siphoning out the 
water. This eliminates a second bucket and filters better when the water nears 
the bottom of the bucket. Thanks Mike.</p>

writes, &quot;We use sterilized water all the time and often the water has been 
sitting in the bottle for a few weeks. I belong to Young's Living Essential 
Oils (see ourAromatherapy Article) and have found that almost all of the oils 
are anti-microbial, anti-bacterial, anti-viral. ... To purify the water we 
drink, we add a couple of drops of lemon oil to a glass of water. This is 
enough to purify it, and also to take away the &quot;flat&quot; taste the 
distilled water has. We also add the oil to a spritzer bottle containing 
distilled water and use that to purify the air and the keep counter tops 
clean.&quot; Thanks Suzanne.</p>

<p><b>Vegan Diet Helps Control Type 2 Diabetes</b> (September 14, <i>Reuters 
Health/InteliHealth Online</i>) &quot;A strict vegetarian 'vegan' diet can help 
improve blood sugar control in patients with type 2 (adult-onset) diabetes, 
according to research [a small but conclusive study], published in the August 
issue of<i>Preventive Medicine</i>. Nearly 95% of all diabetics have type 2 
diabetes, which occurs when the body gradually becomes less sensitive to 
insulin, leading to potentially dangerous fluctuations in blood sugar levels. 
... healthy changes in lifestyle &#150; such as low-fat diets and exercise 
&#150; can help patients maintain safe glycemic (blood sugar) control. More 
than half the patients in the vegan group ... were able to reduce their dosage 
of these hypoglycemia medications.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>CDC: Food Poisoning Sickens Millions</b> (September 17, <i>
AP/InteliHealth Connect</i>) &quot;In the country considered to have the 
world's safest food supply, 76 million people are sickened, 325,000 are 
hospitalized and 5,000 die each year from food poisoning, according to new 
federal figures [from the Consumer Advocacy Center].&quot; See21st Century 
Wellness eLetter No 4 for a way to cleanse food potentially contaminated before 
you buy it. Be careful how you store and handle food, especially in an 
emergency, camping or even home barbecuing. The American Dietetic Association 
recommends four easy steps for food safety:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Wash hands often</li> 
<li>Keep raw meats and ready-to-eat foods separate</li> 
<li>Cook meat to proper temperature &#150; a meat thermometer is fast and easy.
</li> 
<li>Refrigerate leftovers promptly to below 40 degrees &#150; most household 
refrigerators are set for 40 degrees or below &#150; and an ice chest with most 
of its ice melted may not be cold enough to store leftovers.</li> </ul> 
<p><i> Many of friends and associates tell us that the media doesn't indicate 
that Y2K will be a problem. We suggest they look a little deeper than the first 
pages or paragraphs, or the nightly news:</i></p> 
<p><b>Gov't Offering Y2K Warnings Abroad</b> (September 13/15, Ted Bridis, <i>
Yahoo! News/AP</i>) &quot;The State Department is preparing country-by-country 
advisories to warn Americans living or traveling overseas about possible 
failures related to the Year 2000 technology problem. The warnings included 
details about 194 nations where visiting Americans could be affected by power 
outages, water shortages, [healthcare problems] and other potentially serious 
problems caused by the Y2K computer glitch. The reports, which were compiled by 
embassies worldwide, promised to be the best road map yet for identifying 
global trouble spots...&quot; The Healthcare problem areas are one of the main 
sectors evaluated. In a follow-up, Bridis reports that State is warning that 
around the New Year's holiday foreign countries likely will experience problems 
such as power failures or telephone outages, especially in parts of<b>Latin 
America, Asia and Eastern Europe</b>. Rumors are that pressure from elsewhere 
in the federal government and the world has forced the State Department to back 
off on their reports somewhat, so theirsite's warnings are not as strong as 
previously reported.</p> 
<p>The <b>Y2K Progress Report Card</b><b> </b>for Federal Departments and 
Agencies:<b>B-</b> (September 10, US Representative <b>Stephan Horn</b>'s 
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology as of August 
13th). Overall, the government's<b>internal</b> systems rate a <b>B+</b>, 
however, its<b>&quot;High-Impact Programs&quot; only rate a C-</b>.</p> 
<p> Horn says, &quot;the job is still not completed. Progress during this 
quarter is discouraging. The flurry of activity we saw among federal agencies 
earlier this year has<b>slowed to a snail's pace</b>.&quot; Health and Human 
Services completed only another 1% of its &quot;Mission-Critical&quot; 
Systems&#150; as did the government overall &#150; but managed to rate a<b>B</b>
.</p> 
<p> &quot;In many cases, the federal agency responsible for a particular 
program may be compliant, but its business partners &#150; state and local 
governments, and the private sector who assist in delivering the service &#150; 
are not ready. [In addition,] the number of Year 2000-ready programs has 
tripled [from 2 to 7 of 24] during the last three months, however,<b>36 [of the 
43] High Impact Programs remain at risk of failure</b>.&quot;</p> 
<p> Health and Human Services' High-Impact Programs <b><i>rated an F</i></b>. 
Incomplete programs include (<i>followed by their</i> <i>white-knuckle 
completion dates</i>):</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Medicaid &#150; December</b></li> 
<li><b>Medicare &#150; December</b></li> 
<li>Child and Supplemental Nutrition Programs &#150; <b>December</b></li> 
<li>Low Income Home Energy Assistance &#150; <b>December</b></li> </ul> 
<p> Backup systems to the healthcare programs are in trouble too:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Child Care, Child Support Enforcement and Child Welfare &#150; <b>December
</b></li> 
<li>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families &#150; <b>December</b></li>

<li><b>Mail Service</b> &#150; November</li> 
<li>Federal <b>Power</b> Generation/Delivery &#150; October</li> 
<li>Federal Employee Health Benefits &#150; October</li> </ul> 
<p><i> Remember, these are all based on <b>self-reported data</b> &#150; 
unaudited by the GAO or an external agency &#150; and we all know that computer 
projects usually take longer to complete than estimated. Check out the July 29th
GAO report indicating that the 100% completion touted in May is not true. Also, 
<b>end-to-end testing</b> is very important to ferret out data exchange 
problems and other &quot;bugs&quot; &#150;<b>impossible until subsystems are 
complete</b> &#150; which often <b>includes non-federally controlled</b> 
governments and organizations.</i></p> 
<p> Horn summarizes by saying, &quot;I strongly urge all federal agencies to 
intensify their Year 2000 efforts, and continue testing and re-testing system 
changes, and business continuity and contingency plans.&quot;</p> 
<p> We need these kind of strong statements and leadership. Hopefully federal 
agencies will listen and act, as well as<b>strongly encourage</b> state/local 
governments and small/medium-sized businesses to do the same.<i>It would make 
sense to call and encourage your local government officials</i>.</p>

<p><b><i> First Aid</i></b><i> in any situation is often critical to the 
recovery of anyone suffering from a cut to a more serious condition. 
Fortunately, First Aid procedures and methods are straight-forward and not 
difficult to learn. TheRed Cross as well as many schools, non-profit 
organizations and government agencies teach basic First Aid for shock, broken 
limbs, drowning, and many other conditions.<b></b></i></p> 
<p><i> Complementary First Aid goes beyond basic First Aid to include remedies 
such as Acupressure, Aromatherapy and Herbology (see oureLetter archives), 
Bodywork and Reflexology (see ouronline eGuide). This issue features Homeopathy 
&#150; another exceptional healing system.</i></p> 
<p> According to <i>Homeopathy, A Step by Step Guide</i> (&copy; 1997, Element 
Books, Boston<b>), Homeopathic Medicine</b> (usually called <i>Homeopathy)</i>
,&quot;is a natural system of medicine that uses specially prepared remedies to 
stimulate the immune system. Although some remedies are made from herbs, 
Homeopathy should not be confused with Herbology [see previous issue in the
eLetter archives]. Herbal Remedies use material concentrations of plants, while 
Homeopathic Remedies use plants, minerals and even some animal products as a 
base. They are prepared through a process known as &quot;potenization&quot; to 
bring out their subtle [but powerful] healing properties.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;We know from modern physics that our seemingly solid bodies are 
dense fields of energy. A disturbance in this field can give rise to [illness 
and] disease, and a potent form of energy can rebalance us. Homeopathy uses 
&quot;potentized&quot; remedies to rebalance our body's subtle energy system. 
Once back in balance, our immune systems and all other interconnected systems 
in our bodies function better.</p> 
<p> Homeopathy uses preparations containing <b>highly</b> <b>diluted</b> 
solutions of substances as strong as Belladonna or as innocuous as salt. 
Standard dilution is to 1 part substance (or previous dilution) to 99 parts of 
milk sugar or alcohol. This is then&quot;<b>succussed</b>&quot; &#150; shaken 
vigorously to release the healing potential in the substance. This process is 
repeated several times, the number of which identifies the potency of the 
remedy: 6, 10, 30. If the dilution is based on one part substance/dilution to 
nine, the potency is followed by an X. The majority of our first aid remedies 
below are 30X.</p> 
<p> It's interesting that the greater the dilution, the higher the potency, 
and more than 100 years of experience has shown that the succussion process has 
yielded higher potency for the more-diluted remedies &#150; 30 potency is used 
for more serious conditions that 6 potency.</p> 
<p> For more information, pick up the book referenced above and read our 
eGuide chapter on Homeopathy.</p> 
<p><b>Notes</b> <i>(courtesy of Pua Dominick, Copyright &copy; 1991, Reprinted 
with permission. Adapted by Susan Mallamo) &#150;</i>a fuller set of notes can 
be found at ourcurrent eLetter page.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Be careful not to touch the inner rim of the bottle or lid with your 
fingers to prevent contamination of the bottle and to prevent your fingers from 
absorbing the remedy.</li> 
<li>Do not put pellets back into the remedy bottle if they should fall out 
onto the floor, your clothing or your fingers. If you think a remedy bottle has 
been canceled (polluted in this way), replace it.</li> 
<li>The empty bottles should not be used for storage as remedy essence still 
remains. You may sterilize the bottles and lids in distilled water for 30 
minutes, but it is better to recycle and invest in new bottles.</li> 
<li>From observation, the remedies have worked even after allopathic 
(conventional) drug use, drinking coffee and using mint products. However, it 
is best to allow the remedies a clear field in which to work uninterrupted. The 
&quot;lower potency&quot; remedies are less susceptible to cancellations.</li> 
<li>Do not eat or drink anything 15-30 minutes before or after taking a 
Homeopathic remedy. Drinking water before the remedy is acceptable.</li> 
<li>Repeat a remedy that has worked for your problem in the past.</li> 
<li>Don't leave a remedy that is working. You may need to increase the 
frequency or go to a higher potency of the same remedy.</li> 
<li>Remedies may be taken dry, though better results are obtained when a 
remedy is put in distilled water with Everclear alcohol as a preservative (if 
available) and succussed (shaken vigorously) between each dose.</li> 
<li>For long-term storage, boil storage bottles in silver or glass pot with 
one part Everclear alcohol and three parts distilled water for 20 minutes.</li> 
<li>Keep the remedy out of the sunlight and away from all strong odors. 
Perfumes, chemical fumes, nail polish, hair spray, tiger balm, aromatic 
toothpaste, menthol/mint, essential oils and burning agents such as incense, 
will<b>cancel</b> the remedy in the bottle. The average medicine cabinet is not 
the ideal storage area for remedies. Do not open the remedy bottle if you can 
smell any odors.</li> 
<li>Avoid camphor and camphor products, tiger balm or deep heat liniments, 
mint products and essential oils. Any aromatic fumes &#150; paint, ammonia, 
hair permanents, nail polish and remover, moth balls, etc. &#150; can alter the 
remedy.</li> 
<li>Magnetic/electrical fields &#150; TV, X-ray, magnets &#150; could alter 
the remedy in the bottle.</li> </ul>

<p><b>Water Purification</b></p> 
<p><b>A Simple Water Treatment for Potable Water</b></p> 
<p> Place a gallon jug full of potable water &#150; cleansed, tap, bottled, 
distilled or filtered &#150; water in full-spectrum light (such as the sun) for 
at least 30 minutes. The light will clean out most chemicals, pollutants and 
the germs found in our drinking water sources. It also adds<i>energy</i> and <i>
life</i> to water that has been boiled, bombarded with chemicals &#150; yours 
or the water company's &#150; or sifted through previously-used filters.</p> 
<p> Use several jars in a line, putting each newly filled jar at the end of 
the line, furthest away from the light source. Artificial full-spectrum light 
sources should be no more than 12 inches away from the water jar.</p> 
<p> A full-spectrum light duplicates the light spectrum of the sun and look 
like florescent light tubes and bulbs and start at less than $40. They can be 
purchased at most enlightened hardware and health stores as well as Ott-Lite at 
(800)842-8848. They also make excellent &quot;grow&quot; lights indoor plants, 
such as house plants, herbs and vegetables.</p>

<p>&quot;Medical Bills May Face Y2K Problems,&quot; August 6, 1999, by Alice 
Ann Love,<i>Associated Press</i>. This article recommends keeping copies of 
your prescriptions, bills, claims and payments near the end of the year, and 
reports that the American Medical Association (AMA) recommends filling 
prescriptions early and asking your providers about their Y2K preparations. 28% 
of the healthcare providers failed the Medicare claims tests conducted before 
June 21st, according to the US Congress General Accounting Office (GAO) report 
on July 28th. The GAO is also critical of AMA's and other industry reports that 
claim that the healthcare system will be Y2K ready because they used 
insufficient information to assess the real status of the industry. As an 
example of the eleven medical surveys and nine surveys by related industries 
that the GAO reviewed &#150; none of which were independently verified &#150; 
an AMA survey received only 7% response and has extrapolated the results to 
indicate that 94% of the physicians will be ready before the end of the year. 
More evidence that Y2K&quot;happy talk&quot; is prevalent and that you should 
prepare for self-sufficiency ...</p> 
<p><b>Ginkgo a Real Mind Booster</b>, July 28, 1999, by Pat Kendall, PhD, RD, 
Colorado State University Cooperative Extension, Ft Collins. To maintain top 
mental abilities as we move into more stressful times, whether you are 25 or 
75, Ginkgo will help. Of the many supplements touting mental sharpness, Dr 
Kendall says that Ginkgo biloba is one of the few that can back up their 
claims. Recent studies on Alzheimer's disease or dementia have led some to 
project Ginkgo's effectiveness to general mental function. See the full article 
on this superior resource for more details.</p> 
<p><b>Vitamin C Increase In Humans Urged</b> August 24, 1999 <i>(Associate 
Press via InteliHealth Professional Connect).</i> Research at the University of 
Alabama Huntsville has confirmed that megadoses of vitamin C reduced the 
effects of stress in rats and apparently can help boost the production of an 
illness-fighting antibody, says the chairman of the Biological Sciences 
Department. Stress &#150; which we will experience more as the year closes 
&#150; suppresses the immune system, and Campbell found that megadoses of 
vitamin C increased the levels of an antibody which fights against germs and 
viruses, though less in stressed rats. In light of the findings, health 
agencies should consider increasing the recommended dose of the vitamin in 
humans, now based on the amount needed to prevent scurvy and anemia from 60 
milligrams per day to much more. Since more than 1000 milligrams (one gram) a 
day may cause nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhea and, occasionally, kidney 
stones, you should work up to megadoses slowly and consult with your healthcare 
practitioner.</p> 
<p><b>Warm Feet, Better Sleep,</b> InteliHealth's <i>This Week in Health</i>, 
September 3, 1999<i>(requires registration)</i>. &quot;Having trouble nodding 
off at night? Put on an extra pair of socks. Swiss researchers say that the 
temperature of your feet and hands are the best indicators of how quickly 
you'll fall asleep &#150; more accurate than factors such as light or melatonin 
levels. The researchers, whose findings were published in the journal<i>Nature
</i>, monitored the heart rates of their subjects and the temperature of 
various parts of their bodies in an effort to correlate various factors with 
the speed at which the subjects fell asleep. They found that warm hands and 
feet were most closely linked with rapid sleep onset.&quot; Best to stock up on 
socks or other warmers to get a good night's sleep in case the power goes off.

<p><b>Complementary First Aid, Part III &#150; Herbology</b></p> 
<p><i> As we said in the Part II, self-sufficiency will be the hallmark of the 
Year 2000 in most aspects of our lives, but especially healthcare. On or before 
January 1st, access to healthcare facilities and practitioners may be 
interrupted. This will be due to likely disruptions in the conventional 
healthcare system, or lower-probability infrastructure failures &#150; 
transportation or communications &#150; restricting access to all healthcare 
practitioners, supplies and services.</i></p> 
<p><i>Complementary First Aid goes beyond basic First Aid to include remedies 
such as Acupressure and Aromatherapy (see ourarchives), Bodywork, Herbology, 
Homeopathy and Reflexology (see ouronline book). This issue features Herbology 
&#150; another exceptional healing system that goes well beyond Echinacea. 
&#150;KJ</i></p> 
<p> Herbology has been used since primitive man first observed animals eating 
certain plants when not feeling well. Trial and error testing, and now 
scientific research, have refined herbal medicine into a significant part of 
complementary healthcare. Herbs are the basis of most drugs, which are often 
synthetic forms of the herbs. Throughout recorded history, herbs have played a 
strong part in healing and healthcare. With minimal side-effects and powerful 
results, herbal medicines can be a strong part of your wellness program, 
including first aid for you and your family.</p> 
<p> The following list is representative of the many conditions that herbs 
effect and the many herbal medicines that can be very effective.</p> 
<p><b>Some notes</b> are in order to set the stage properly (source shown in 
parenthesis):<b> </b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Take all <i>tinctures</i> &#150; concentrated extracts in an alcohol 
medium &#150; in a little warm water (about 2 inches in bottom of glass) to 
help absorption and to dilute the strong medicinal taste.(JFH)</li> 
<li>If alcohol intake is not desired &#150; it is minimal for each dose &#150; 
squeeze the dropper dose into a little just- boiled water and let it stand for 
20 minutes. Most of the alcohol will evaporate. (You will have less than in 
mouth wash.) If one may not ingest any alcohol at all, these tinctures should 
not be taken.(JFH)</li> 
<li>In serious situations, consult the nearest and best-qualified healthcare 
professional, as available.(RMC)</li> 
<li>Child's Dosages: divide the weight of a child by 150 to get approximate 
fraction of adult dose. Example: 50 lb child / 150 = 1/3rd the adult dose.(RMC)

<p><b>Detoxifying Food &#150; Parcells Oxygen Soak</b><br>
 from <i>Live 
Better Longer</i>, Joseph Dispenza, via <i>Well Being Journal</i></p> 
<p> The Parcells Oxygen Soak can revive foods, remove pesticides, toxins, 
chemicals, and fungi and bacteria from food, as well as help preserve food in 
your refrigerator for much longer. Around the world, it is the essential means 
of sanitizing food in out-of-the-way places. Foods include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Eggs (the porous shells can absorb pesticides and salmonella)</li> 
<li>Meats (which can be a heavy carrier of toxic materials: growth hormones, 
antibiotics and poisons in the foods that animals consume)</li> 
<li>Fruits and vegetables, including <i>sprouts and herbs</i></li> </ul> 
<p> The benefits of this oxygen food treatment are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fruits, herbs and vegetables will keep longer</li> 
<li>The wilted will return to a fresh crispness</li> 
<li>Colors will restore (unless soaked longer than recommended times)</li> 
<li>Flavor and texture will be enhanced</li> 
<li>Meat, fish and foul will be tenderized</li> 
<li>Dangerous additives will have been removed.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Application</b></p> 
<p> Add 1 teaspoon of Clorox&reg; bleach to 1 gallon of water. Separate foods 
into the following groups and soak for indicated time (make a fresh soak for 
each group):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Leafy vegetables- 5-10 minutes</li> 
<li>Root and heavy-fiber vegetables- 10-15 minutes</li> 
<li>Fruits, thin-skinned fruits (berries)- 5 minutes</li> 
<li>Fruits, medium-skinned (peaches, apricots)- 10 minutes</li> 
<li>Fruits, thick-skinned (apples, citrus)- 10-15 minutes</li> 
<li>Eggs- 20-30 minutes</li> 
<li>Meat/poultry/fish, thawed- 10 minutes per lb</li> 
<li>Meat/poultry/fish, frozen- 15-20 minutes per lb</li> </ul> 
<p>Frozen meats/poultry/fish &#150; except ground meats &#150; will not lose 
any juices in the soak, and they can remain in the soak until thawed.</p> 
<p> After the soak, place food in a fresh water rinse for 5-10 minutes. The 
fresh water introduces new oxygen into the food. Let the food drain well before 
refrigerating.</p> 
<p><b>*Cautions: Do not use more bleach than recommended and do not soak 
longer than times given.</b><b><br>
We are researching Clorox's new PLUS bleach 
to see if it is safe for this procedure.</b></p> 
<p><b>Background</b></p> 
<p> In the 1950s at Sierra States University in California, Hazel Parcells, ND 
conducted an experiment with shriveled, discolored lemons meant for the compost 
pile. She placed them into a sink full of water into which she put a small 
amount of bleach. Within one-half hour the lemons had taken on a fresh 
appearance and the room smelled of fragrant lemon. Parcells portioned them out 
and placed them in a freezer. For the next three years they were tested for 
freshness and nutritional value in every class she taught. Through the third 
year they retained their freshness, moisture, tartness and rivaled the fresh 
lemons even in nutritional value.</p> 
<p> The sodium hypochlorite &#150; the only chlorine part of 
&quot;chlorine&quot; bleach &#150; is an oxygenator and interacts with the 
natural chemicals in the lemons originally used by Dr. Parcells. Testing showed 
that the bleach actually cleaned the lemons, eliminating fungi, bacteria and 
other foreign material on them that might have contributed to earlier than 
normal deterioration.</p> 
<p> Parcells found that Clorox bleach worked the best of all bleaches because 
of the manufacturer's high quality procedures and filtration. She spent the 
next few years experimenting and refining her methods with different foods. She 
used the bleach soak for forty years, with nary a complaint, and lived to be 
104 years, passing in 1996.</p> 
<p> The Parcells Oxygen Soak is registered with the Smithsonian Institution 
under &quot;Simplified Kitchen Chemistry,&quot; and is used around the world 
with great success, having been adopted by health departments of many 
governments.</p>

<p><b>The Drug Industry Cautions Against Stockpiling</b> (Reuters &#150; <i>
paid registration required</i>).&quot;[The drug] industry is grappling with the 
possibility that panicky consumers could cause shortages of products as the 
Year 2000 nears. The Pharmaceutical Alliance for Y2K Readiness, a consortium of 
trade organizations, will launch a website this month providing Y2K information 
for consumers and advising against stockpiling. 'If everyone were to get an 
extra [month's worth of medications], it would throw [the system] out of 
whack,' said Mark Grayson, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), which is also part of the alliance. A 
spokeswoman for AmeriSource Health Corp., the fourth-largest US wholesale 
pharmaceutical distributor, said that the company expects pharmacies to obtain 
about an extra week's worth of stock near the end of the year and has started 
to build its own inventory in preparation.&quot;</p> 
<p> <i>Agreed, however, stockpiling a month's medications is what many 
preparedness groups and lists are recommending, but will not really be possible 
due to insurance, conventional medical system restrictions, as well as 
available supplies. Therefore, we have to look at complementary medicinals and 
methods to supplement or replace conventional medications and treatments. We 
need to start now, working in conjunction with our primary healthcare 
practitioners. &#150; KJ</i></p>

<p><i> Self-sufficiency will be the hallmark of the Year 2000 (Y2K for short), 
in most aspects of our lives, but especially healthcare. Beginning on January 
1st, access to healthcare facilities and practitioners may be interrupted. This 
will be due to likely disruptions in the conventional healthcare system, or 
low-probability infrastructure failures &#150; transportation or communications 
&#150; restricting access to all healthcare practitioners, supplies and 
services.</i></p> 
<p><i> <b>First Aid</b> in any situation is often critical to the recovery of 
anyone suffering from a cut to a more serious condition. Fortunately, First Aid 
procedures and methods are straight-forward and not difficult to learn. TheRed 
Cross as well as many schools, non-profits and agencies teach basic First Aid 
for shock, broken limbs, drowning, and many other conditions.</i></p> 
<p><i> Complementary First Aid goes beyond basic First Aid to include remedies 
such as Acupressure (see the last issue in ourarchives), Aromatherapy, 
Bodywork, Herbology, Homeopathy and Reflexology. This issue features 
Aromatherapy &#150; an exceptional healing system that goes well beyond 
pleasant smells. &#150;KJ</i></p> 
<p> Aromatherapy is a gentle, non-toxic, pleasant, yet powerful tool for 
healing. It is based on the topical application of botanical oils &#150;<b><i>
essential oils &#150;</i></b>extracted from flowers, grass, barks and herbs. 
Aromatherapy essential oils were first used in medicinal healing work. These 
oils can be applied to the Reflexology points on the bottom of the feet or 
directly on the skin to the area of need.</p> 
<p> Essential oils contain oxygenating molecules which transport nutrients to 
the cells of the body. The highly-fragrant oils affect the neurotransmitters in 
the brain through one's sense of smell. These neurotransmitters initiate 
physical and psychological reactions that can enhance physical healing and 
emotional balance. When combined with Bodywork modalities, Aromatherapy oils 
accelerates the therapeutic value of both.</p> 
<p> The following list is representative of the many conditions that 
Aromatherapy effects and the many essential oils that can be very effective. 
Some notes are in order to set the stage properly.</p> 
<p> This is excerpted from &quot;Aromatherapy for First Aid,&quot; online in 
our<i>Wellness</i> eJournal</p>

<p> <b>FDA Changing the Rules</b>. <b>Citizens For Health</b>, a hard-working 
consumer advocacy group, may have to sue the FDA if it insists on its proposed 
new official definition changing from<i>&quot;</i>damage<i>&quot;</i> to any <i>
&quot;</i>deviation<i>&quot;</i> from normal structure or function of the body, 
including any signs or symptoms of deviation. Literal interpretation of these 
proposed changes would mean that a majority of the proper and lawful claims 
that now appear on supplement labels would become illegal. The FDA's 
responsibility is to implement regulations that advance, not diminish the 
intent of Congress to deliver what the public has demanded &#150; information 
about the health benefits of dietary supplements.</p>

<p><b>Complementary First Aid, Part I &#150; Acupressure</b><b><br>
</b><b>by 
Monte Cunningham, The Acu-Ki Institute</b></p> 
<p><i> One of the most portable yet highly-effective methods of complementary 
healthcare is Acupressure. It requires no more than a chart and a hand to 
administer treatments, though treatments can be administered with wooden tools 
as well as coupled with massage and essential oils. Both have been successfully 
used for thousands of years to help millions of people This article features 
Acupressure and is written by Monte Cunningham, a man who has spent more than 
35 years studying this healthcare modality. &#150; KJ</i></p> 
<p> The healing art of Acupressure is at least 5,000 years old and remains the 
third most popular method for pain and illness relief in the world. It is a 
complete health system that has been documented for use in over 3000 
conditions. Anyone seeking alternatives to their current treatments, or those 
concerned about situations in which they may not be able to find medical help 
(such as Y2K), should consider this as their first treatment choice.</p> 
<p><b>Points:</b></p> 
<p> For the conditions listed below, you will find points that the experts 
agree help these conditions and that are easy to find. Sometimes you only need 
a few points to get results. The points follow.</p>

<p><b>Administration:</b></p> 
<p> To find the appropriate point, read the point description above, then find 
the general area on your skin. Gently probe the area until you find that point 
which gives you a &quot;funny bone&quot; feeling or is sensitive, tender or 
sore. Then press hard enough to make the point hurt.</p> 
<p> You can use a steady pressure or a five seconds on and five seconds off 
rotating pressure for the time you stimulate the point. Usually one minute is 
sufficient for each treatment session.</p> 
<p> Regular, systematic treatment usually gets the best results because the 
effects of Acupressure are cumulative. At first, frequent treatment is 
recommended. Treatment three times daily for five to ten minutes may be 
necessary. Or treat more frequent, such as every two hours, until you start 
feeling relief. You cannot overdose.</p> 
<p> Some report almost immediate results; others may need a few weeks to get 
lasting results. Acupressure is safe. Side effects are very rare. Treat while 
sitting down and do not administer after meals.</p> 
<p> To find more conditions and points, as well as more information on how to 
get the best results, visit the Acu-Ki Institute website.</p> 
<p><i> Thirty-five years ago, Monte Cunnigham injured his back playing 
football in high school, causing intermittent and unexplainable pain. After two 
back surgeries, depression, drinking, and contemplation of suicide, he began 
searching for other ways of healing, studying diets, exercises and meditations. 
Through careful and exhaustive research, he learned techniques and developed 
tools that have worked for him and have helped others. In the last 15 years, he 
has completely freed himself of the pain. Contact:Monte Cunningham,The Acu-Ki

the medical community may be crippled. This has been verified by careful 
Internet and telephone research, and reports such as the US Senate,<i>
Investigating the Impact of the Year 2000 Problem</i><i>, </i>March 1999. In 
it, Senators Bennett and Dodd reported that 80% of conventional medications 
come from overseas, mostly from poorly Y2K-prepared countries. Further, 
according to the Gartner Group via the Senate report, 64% of hospitals 
(primarily smaller hospitals) have no plans to test their Y2K remediation 
efforts, and 90% of physicians' offices are unaware of their Y2K exposure.</p> 
<p> This soon-to-be urgent need can be satisfied by complementary healthcare 
methods, if implemented soon, well before the medication stream and medical 
facilities falter. In addition:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Non-prescription medicinals may be purchased in large quantities, and only 
a few are perishable over a one-year period. (Herbal tinctures, for instance, 
have a much longer shelf life than one year.) So we can prevent any 
interruption in non-prescription medicinals (if any) by stocking up, much like 
we do food.</li> 
<li>Non-conventional medicinals and supplements are much safer than 
prescription drugs, with very few reactions or negative drug interactions.</li> 
<li>Many non-conventional healthcare remedies require no medicinals, only a 
healthcare professional/teacher in such modalities as: Acupressure, bodywork, 
breathwork, energywork, flexibility/strength-building, meditation, Naturopathy, 
Nutrition and Reflexology.</li> 
<li>Non-conventional healthcare usually focuses on wellness versus illness, 
leading clients away from dependency on drugs and medical offices, to a better 
immune system, stronger body and mind, as well as a higher quality of life.</li>
<li>A complementary wellness program &#150; that is using the full spectrum of 
healthcare modalities &#150; can be accomplished at minimal or no additional 
cost through:</li> 
<ul> 
<li>Self study </li> 
<li>Free lectures </li> 
<li>Advice from health food stores </li> 
<li>Internet information sources such as the CompWellness site </li> </ul> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Money from Health Insurance Savings</b>:</p> 
<p>If an option with your conventional health insurance, you may be able to 
reduce costs dramatically increasing the deductible from $100s to $2000 or so, 
and use the savings &#150; often $100+ per month &#150; to buy professional 
services and recommended products. Often, increases in deductible will not 
reduce emergency room benefits, and a good, complementary wellness program will 
keep most people out of the hospital.</p>

<p><i> Complementary</i> means acting as a complement to one another. <i>
Complementary</i> <i>Healing</i> is an <i>inclusive</i> term that recognizes 
the interaction of many modalities in assisting an individual to healing and<i>
wellness</i>. It implies a <i>holistic</i> approach that encourages a 
cooperative spirit among healing practitioners and is preferred to the term<i>
alternative</i>, which creates a separation among healing modalities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Holistic</i> <i>healing</i> means treating the whole person: body, 
mind, emotion, energy and spirit. Treating only the physical body allows many 
of the unhealthy patterns to continue. Therefore, many more conventional 
practitioners are learning and practicing holistic methods.</li> 
<li><i>Alternative healing</i> means <i>not conventional</i>, that is, not 
using the procedures that are common to Western allopathic medicine &#150; 
which is associated with therapies that frequently require prescriptions for 
drugs and sometimes surgery.<i> Conventional</i> medicine holds a valuable 
place in the total spectrum of healthcare, especially for emergency situations 
and catastrophic illnesses.</li> </ul> 
<p> <i>Wellness</i> goes beyond healing and is reaching a high level of health 
and staying there in an active manner to assure health throughout life. 
Wellness has four parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Nutrition &#150; what and how much you consume effects how you feel, how 
long you'll live and how you deal with illness and disease. It includes: 
healthy foods, supplements and the all-important<i>water</i>.</li> 
<li>Fitness &#150; your body needs 20-30 minutes of exercise per day. About 
60% of US adults do not exercise enough.</li> 
<li>Attitude &#150; regular non-physical exercise of the mind and spirit 
effects your mental and emotional state. This integrates your Nutrition and 
Fitness efforts.</li> 
<li>Help &#150; regular visits to healthcare professionals who assist you to a 
healthy state as well as customize your wellness plan.</li> </ul> 
<p><i> CompWellness Network </i>is applying this four-part program using the 
full spectrum of healthcare modalities &#150; Acupressure through Yoga. You may 
be able to modify your health insurance coverage to include many of these 
modalities, or raise your deductible to reduce costs making money available for 
the other modalities<i>&#150; see in the Y2K article.</i></p> 
<p> The goal is for you and your healthcare practitioners to work together, 
using the<i>least-aggressive</i><b> </b><i>therapies</i> available to treat 
injuries and illness, and assisting you with<b> </b><i>recovery and prevention
</i><b> </b>&#150; your wellness plan.</p>
