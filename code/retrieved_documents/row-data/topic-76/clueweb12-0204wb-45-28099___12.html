 All Natural White Chocolate Chips by 
SunSpire <strong>SunSpire White Chocolate Chips (283 g)</strong> <br>
<br>

Enjoy the creamy, sweet taste of cocoa butter and cane juice flavored with a 
hint of vanilla in SunSpire White Chocolate Chips. SunSpire White Chocolate 
Chips are the only white chocolate chips on the market that are free of trans 
fats. SunSpire White Chocolate Chips provide a delicious contrast to 
traditional semi-sweet chocolate chips and make a perfect white candy coating.
<br> <br>
<strong>SunSpire's Natural Chocolates</strong> <br>
Good chocolate is 
more than just rich flavor and a texture so smooth it melts on your tongue. 
It's also made with 100% natural ingredients, without artificial flavors, 
colors or preservatives. That's what makes good chocolate even better.<br>
<br>

<strong>Health Facts</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>All Natural - No Artificial Flavors, Colors or Preservatives </li> 
<li>No Hydrogenated Oils </li> 
<li>SunSpire Organic Chocolates Support Chemical-Free, Sustainable Agriculture 
</li> 
<li>Natural Alternative Sweeteners: Malted Grains, Organic Sugar, Dried Cane 
Juice &amp; Molasses</li> 
<li>Cholesterol Free </li> 
<li>Non-Dairy Varieties </li> 
<li>No MSG/HVP </li> 
<li>Kosher OU-D </li> </ul> <strong>Health Benefits of SunSpire Sweeteners
</strong> <br>
Sunspire's commitment to delicious and healthy products is shown 
in the variety of sweeteners that SunSpire uses. SunSpire believes that less 
refined sugars are a better choice and they even enhance the flavor profile of 
SunSpire products.<br>
<br>
<strong>What does &quot;organic&quot; mean on 
Sunspire products?</strong> <br>
Organic means that all the ingredients are 
grown, harvested, produced and packaged without chemicals. Sunspire has a 
dedicated line of organic confections as well as organic chocolate baking 
chips. SunSpire products are third-party certified organic by QAI. (Quality 
Assurance International).<br>
<br>
<strong>Are Sunspire products certified 
Kosher?</strong> <br>
Yes. SunSpire products are certified Kosher by the 
Orthodox Union, the most widely recognized Kosher certification in the world. 
This certifies that every ingredient has been inspected and/or approved by a 
qualified Rabbi from the Orthodox Union. SunSpire products carry the OU-D 
symbol. As our dairy-free ingredient products are made on equipment that makes 
dairy ingredient products, the Orthodox Union certifies our products as OU-D.
<br> <br>
<strong>Is Sunspire Chocolate &quot;fair trade&quot; certified?
</strong> <br>
SunSpire organic cocoa is grown in Central America and parts of 
South America. It is purchased at premium prices and produced to standards that 
map very closely to globally defined fair trade practices. Many of the growers 
who supply SunSpire with organic cocoa are members of fair trade coalitions 
within their own countries. SunSpire supports the principles of fair trade; 
however, SunSpire products do not have fair trade certification. SunSpire's 
conventionally grown cocoa comes from all three major cocoa growing regions: 
Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. SunSpire works closely with our 
chocolate suppliers and stand by their statements that the cocoa in SunSpire 
products is being produced under fair labor conditions. Further, as members of 
the World Cocoa Foundation, SunSpire has extended their work to directly 
support the well-being and livelihood of cocoa growers worldwide.<br>
<br>

<strong>How is chocolate made?</strong> <br>
Raw cocoa beans are dried and 
roasted, then they are cracked, and the &quot;nibs&quot; (the center of the 
cocoa bean) are ground. Using a hydraulic press, the cocoa butter is extracted, 
leaving a dense, rich, and bitter substance called chocolate liquor. Despite 
the name, this substance does not contain any alcohol. After drying, the 
chocolate liquor is ground into powder form.:&quot; &quot;:natural ingredients 
instead of joining her family's successful chocolate business. As she began her 
quest to develop all natural recipes, Jennings also discovered ways to innovate 
many of her family's classic ones. She researched nutritive sweeteners and 
worked on crafting the best-tasting and purest natural candies. As a result, 
Sunspire pioneered the natural chocolate category, setting the taste and 
quality standard for natural chocolates and confections - a standard that has 
never been met by another company.  Suggested Use <strong>White Chocolate Chip
