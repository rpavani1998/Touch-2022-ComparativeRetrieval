<h1>Sugar And Other Sweeteners </h1> 
<p>True Danish flavoured schnapps should not contain more than 15 grams sugar 
per liter.</p>
<p>But of course, you can add as much sugar or other sweeteners as you want to 
suit your own taste.</p>
<p>Also, if your infusion is too weak-flavoured you can certainly enhance the 
flavours by adding a little, little bit of sugar.</p>
<p>Sugar is a great flavour enhancer. </p>
<p>You can add the sugar directly, but because sugar is more soluble in water 
than in alcohol, it's usually better to make a simplesugar syrup...</p>
<p>...and add it to your infusion little by little.</p>
<p>Never use artificial sweeteners - NEVER! You will ruin the taste.</p>
<p>White sugar does not impart a distinctive taste of its own. That's why it's 
commonly used as flavour enhancer.</p>
<p>However, you can substitute white sugar for other sweeteners such as fruit 
sugars, brown sugar, cane sugar, a mix of different sugars, corn syrup, or 
honey.</p>
<p>These substitutes are interesting alternatives, if you wish to experiment.
</p>
<p>Just remember that the kind and amount of sweetener you choose will affect 
both taste and flavours.</p>
<p>Another option is glucose syrup. It's not as sweet as the sugar syrup. <br>
