<p>A study recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
has some good news: Between the years 2000 and 2008, our daily intake of added 
sugars has gone down from 3.5 ounces to 2.7 ounces. That&rsquo;s almost a 25% 
decrease!</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;We were surprised to see that there was a substantial reduction 
over the years,&rdquo; said Dr. Jean Welsh, a researcher at Emory University in 
Atlanta and the lead author of the report.read more from Reuters&hellip;</em>
</p> 
<p>When trying to interpret the data, researchers and analysts had several 
explanations:</p> 
<p>- the decrease is due to&nbsp;heightened&nbsp;awareness by consumers to the 
obesity and diabetes risks of added sugars (especially in sodas).</p> 
<p>- schools started to massively reduce the presence of sweetened beverages 
around 2000-2001.</p> 
<p>- Added sugars come by many different names &ndash; table sugar, corn 
syrup, high fructose corn syrup, cane juice, and more. But many manufacturers 
have begun using fruit juice and fruit juice concentrate as their sweeteners, 
and these were not technically considered as added sugars by the study. Despite 
their healthy &nbsp;sounding name, these are sugars with no added health 
benefits. They just happened to come from a fruit instead of sugar can or a 
beet.</p> 
<p>- The study did not track an increase in the use of artificial sweeteners, 
which might end up being even worse for many of us (here&rsquo;s why)</p> 
<p>It seems to us that a 25% reduction in our craving for sweets in less than 
10 years is highly unlikely. What do you think?</p> 
<p><strong>What to do at the supermarket:</strong></p> 
<p>When looking up ingredient lists, make sure sugar or its synonyms are not 
present in large quantities. This includes the seemingly innocent fruit juice 
concentrate.</p>

<p>Sugar and sugar substitutes throw so many systems in our bodies off 
balance.&nbsp; It suppresses our immune system, cause havoc on our hormones and 
rewire our brains making us seek out sugary foods.&nbsp; If there is one 
ingredient that people need to wean themselves from is sugar and 
sweeteners.&nbsp; In my book, EATING OURSELVES CRAZY, I discuss how sugar 
actually contributes to mood disorders.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think any of this has been established by research. It just 
seems reasonable.</p> </li> 
<li> Kelli <br>

<p>My vote is on the artificial sweeteners. I&rsquo;ve met so many people that 
don&rsquo;t give artificial sweeteners a second thought.</p> </li> 
<li> Treena W. <br>

<p>There are a variety of excellent sources of research on the negative 
effects of sugar such as &ldquo;Pure, White and Deadly&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sweet 
and Dangerous&rdquo; by J. Yudkin.&nbsp; Also Prevention&rsquo;s &ldquo;The 
Sugar Solution&rdquo; is one of my favorites.&nbsp;</p> </li> </ul> Kraft 1
