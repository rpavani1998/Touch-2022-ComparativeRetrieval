<p>I am in awe of the recent TV commercials where two mothers are talking and 
one questions the other about serving some sweetened fruit punch to her 
kids.&nbsp; The first mother says, &ldquo;That stuff&rsquo;s gothigh fructose 
corn syrup in it, and you know what they say about <em>that.</em>&rdquo;</p> 
<p>To which the second mother replies, &ldquo;What?&nbsp; That it&rsquo;s <em>
natural</em>and made from <em>corn</em>? And that in moderation, it&rsquo;s 
perfectly fine?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Clever commercial.&nbsp; And utterly misleading.</p> 
<p><strong>Understanding Sugar&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>In the beginning, there was plain old table sugar, also known by its 
scientific name,<em>sucrose</em>.&nbsp; Sucrose is a disaccharide 
(&ldquo;di&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;two,&rdquo; &ldquo;saccharide&rdquo; meaning 
&ldquo;sugar&rdquo;).&nbsp; That means it&rsquo;s actually a blend of two 
&ldquo;simple&rdquo; (mono) saccharides, in this case<em>glucose</em> and <em>
fructose</em>.</p> 
<p>Take a molecule of glucose and a molecule of fructose, link them with a 
chemical bond and presto, you&rsquo;ve got yourself a molecule of 
sucrose.&nbsp; Put a bunch of those sucrose molecules together in a bowl, place 
the bowl on the table at the local diner with a little spoon in it, and 
you&rsquo;re in business.</p> 
<p>Now it&rsquo;s pretty much a given that high intake of sugar is bad for 
you, and a list of all reasons why would pretty much fill a book, so 
let&rsquo;s save that for another day.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s interesting is 
that a fair amount of research has been done investigating exactly<em>which</em>
 of the two components of sugar is<em>worse</em> for you&mdash;glucose or 
fructose.&nbsp; And the hands-down winner in the &ldquo;this stuff is 
bad&rdquo; category is&hellip;<em>fructose</em>.</p> 
<p><strong>Figuring Out Fructose&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>Fructose is a <em>naturally occurring fruit sugar</em> found, for example, 
in an apple.&nbsp; In this form, fructose is absolutely fine.</p> 
<p>But the difference between fructose in an apple and fructose in a soda is 
the difference between a beautiful fur coat on a wild fox and that same fur on 
the back of a lady at the opera.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s gorgeous on its original 
owner (the fox).&nbsp;&nbsp; But on the lady?&nbsp; Not so much.</p> 
<p>When fructose is found in its original setting (like an apple or a berry), 
it&rsquo;s surrounded with healthful nutrients like phytochemicals andfiber
.&nbsp; When it&rsquo;s extracted and made into a liquid sweetener, it&rsquo;s 
a complete nightmare.</p> 
<p>Studies have shown that fructose produces insulin resistance in 
animals.&nbsp; Insulin resistance is a central feature of metabolic syndrome 
and type lldiabetes.</p> 
<p>More than any other kind of sugar, fructose raises triglycerides&mdash;a 
serious risk factor forheart disease.&nbsp; In 2000, Canadian researchers at 
the University of Toronto fed a high-fructose diet to rodents that have a fat 
metabolism similar to our own&mdash;Syrian golden hamsters.&nbsp; In a matter 
of weeks, the hamsters developed<em>both</em> elevated triglycerides and 
insulin resistance.</p> 
<p>Fructose has also been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease.&nbsp; 
Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable 
metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain, and 
extra abdominal fat.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s no wonder it contributes mightily to 
creating new fat on your body.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, fructose does <em>not</em> raise blood sugar very much, 
leading to the wrongheaded idea (popular for a while) that it&rsquo;s a 
&ldquo;good&rdquo; sugar for diabetics.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
bad news.</p> 
<p><strong>From Bad to Worse&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>Now in the &ldquo;olden&rdquo; days, sugar&mdash;table sugar that is, plain 
old sucrose&mdash;was expensive.&nbsp; Not maybe for the average Joe picking up 
a bag at the grocery store, but for food manufacturers wanting to sweeten 
products, it was definitely a high-ticket ingredient.</p> 
<p>Between sugar tariffs that drove the price of sugar higher and corn 
subsidies the forced the price of corn lower, a perfect environment was setup 
to allow food manufacturers to find a solution to the problem of expensive 
sugar.&nbsp; Enter high fructose corn syrup.</p> 
<p>Take a subsidized crop (like corn), perform a bunch of chemical operations 
on it, and voila, you had something that was even sweeter than sucrose at a 
fraction of the cost.&nbsp; Better yet, it could be added to virtually 
everything on the table, making those items even more &ldquo;delicious&rdquo; 
and desirable and, of course, moving more product.</p> 
<p>Now here&rsquo;s where it gets tricky.&nbsp; Chemically speaking, high 
fructose corn syrup really<em>isn&rsquo;t</em> that different from table sugar 
(sucrose).&nbsp; High fructose corn syrup&mdash;at least the most common kind 
found in soft drinks&mdash;is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s not a huge difference from the 50/50 mix in plain old sugar.</p> 
<p>But the problem is that it&rsquo;s <em>everywhere</em>.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The low cost of high fructose corn syrup allowed the explosion of 
20-ounce sodas, super big gulps and the like to happen,&rdquo; says C. Leigh 
Broadhurst, PhD, a research scientist and nutritionist at the USDA.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Because sucrose was quite expensive, for years, sodas were limited to 
the 12-ounce can.&nbsp; We have also had an explosion of candies, bakery items, 
and ice cream novelties, which would have been just too costly if they were all 
made with sugar.&nbsp; But now, because of high fructose corn syrup, these 
items are much cheaper to produce.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So, no matter how you cut the HFCS-sweetened cake, we&rsquo;re now 
consuming more fructose than ever.&nbsp; And refined fructose-&mdash;whether we 
get it from table sugar or from the ubiquitous HFCS&mdash;is bad news for your 
health.</p> 
<p>When the Corn Refiners Assocation fights back with their 
&ldquo;pro-HFCS&rdquo; ads, it seems to come down to two arguments: One, 
it&rsquo;s no worse than sugar (OK<em>maybe</em>, but that&rsquo;s like saying 
Salems are no worse than Marlboros), and two, it&rsquo;s natural because cause 
it&rsquo;s made from corn.</p> 
<p>Maybe so, but so is ethanol, and I&rsquo;m not drinking that either.&nbsp; 
And speaking of things I&rsquo;m<em>not</em> doing, let&rsquo;s add agave to 
the list.</p> 
<p>Yes, agave.</p> 
<p><strong>The Blue Agave Myth</strong></p> 
<p>Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as 
a health food.</p> 
<p>Sorry.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t kill the messenger.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand how agave syrup got its great 
reputation.&nbsp; Even the word agave has a fine pedigree, coming from the 
Greek word for &ldquo;noble.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;blue&rdquo; agave 
species&mdash;considered the best for the making agave nectar&mdash;flourishes 
in rich volcanic soil.&nbsp; (It&rsquo;s also the only variety permitted in the 
making of tequila.)&nbsp; And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to 
haveanti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s zero evidence that any of those compounds are 
present in the commercially made syrup.</p> 
<p>Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey 
and is considerably sweeter than sugar.&nbsp; The health-food crowd loves it 
because it isgluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, 
because it&rsquo;s low-glycemic (we&rsquo;ll get to that in a moment).&nbsp; 
Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as 
&ldquo;diabetic friendly.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; What&rsquo;s not to like?</p> 
<p>As it turns out, quite a lot.</p> 
<p>Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it&rsquo;s 
largely made of fructose.&nbsp; In fact, with the exception of pure liquid 
fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial 
sweetener.&nbsp; It is a whopping 90 percent fructose, nearly twice as high as 
HFCS!</p> 
<p>In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of 
fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits (it&rsquo;s 
considered a fiber).&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s not much inulin left in the actual 
syrup.</p> 
<p>In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it 
down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose 
content that is, at best, 57 percent and&mdash;much more commonly&mdash;as high 
as 90 percent.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with 
great marketing,&rdquo; says Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American 
College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of 
Public Health.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when 
(consumed) at higher doses.&nbsp; Many people have fructose intolerance like 
lactose intolerance.&nbsp; They get acne or worse, diabetes symptoms, even 
though their blood [sugar] is okay.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science.&nbsp; True, it 
has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t mean 
it&rsquo;s good for you.</p> 
<p>If you simply <em>must</em> have some sweets, a small amount of agave 
nectar every once in a while isn&rsquo;t going to kill you.&nbsp; Just 
don&rsquo;t buy into the idea that it&rsquo;s any better for you than plain old 
sugar or HFCS.</p> 
<p>And remember, no matter what exotic name they give it or how natural and 
harmless they try to make it sound, sugar is sugar is sugar.</p> 
<p>Eat more sugar and its substitutes if you want to accelerate your aging, 
develop chronic diseases, add several inches to your waist and sap yourself of 
energy.</p> 
<p>Eat less sugar and its substitutes if you want to slow down the aging 
process, maintain vibrant health, retain a slim and trim figure and enjoy 
boundless energy.</p> <br>

<p>Xylitol is the sam old story then??</p> </li> 
<li> electrofish <br>

<p>Xylitol is equal to rest of the sugars/sweeteners then?</p> </li> 
<li> Dduck <br>

<p>Nope &ndash; Xylitol is great for the bones and teeth!!</p> </li> 
<li> Mirjana <br>

<p>Yes, I completely agree wit all you said. Like everything else, all is in 
the dosage. Eat natural food in moderation and there would be no problems. The 
worst things in our modern time are food and pharmaceutical industry. They 
isolated natural ingredients and made them toxic in the new combinations.</p>

<p>Thanks for explaining this. &nbsp;The evil corn empire has been pushing 
their product with aggressive advertising, so its good to get the straight 
scoop here.</p> 
<p>As to the Blue Agave, well, its clear to me that its highest and best use 
is feeding little yeasts in the production of tequila. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s 
the only way I&rsquo;m going to consume this product from now on. &nbsp;In 
moderation too.</p> </li> 
<li> Brireward <br>

<p>You should add the sugar subs that are&nbsp;not bad for you such as Stevia. 
Or don&rsquo;t you like that either?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to know.</p> </li> 
<li> Brireward <br>

<p>Another mention:&nbsp; How about the gmo&rsquo;s in the corn product? I 
don&rsquo;t eat anything that is suspect with gmo&rsquo;s &ndash; soybean and 
all products of it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll find it in most&nbsp;packaged products.

<p>Thanks for the information&hellip;we have sure wrestled on this one.&nbsp; 
Please also explain the sugar substitutes.&nbsp; These are shoved at us right 
and left as if they are the end-all but in my mind a processed food isn&rsquo;t 
a food at all but something our bodies can&rsquo;t process or don&rsquo;t know 
what to do with so it just gets stored&hellip;in fat, the liver, etc.&nbsp; 
And, what is the story on Xylitol?&nbsp; Please help!</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently purchased all natural made from 100%Stevia from Peru

<p>Dang it!&nbsp; I bought the agave myth &ndash; thanks for letting me 
know.&nbsp; I have given up sugar before, and can do that again, but what can I 
suggest to friends &amp; family who seem to be in an addictive relationship 
with sugar/sweeteners?&nbsp;</p> </li>

<p>truvia is suppose to be he newest all new organic sweetener does anyone 
know of a truly organic sweetener that does not hurt others??????</p> </li> 
<li> Lisa Davis <br>

<p>Thank you,</p> 
<p>I also fell for agave syrup, but then caught on after I bought a bottle. 
There is so much ignorance around about sugar. A friend of mine likes the 
artificial sweetener made from sugar, and thinks because it&rsquo;s made from 
sugar, it&rsquo;s healthy (two examples of wrong thinking in one sentence.</p> 
<p>Lisa Davis</p> </li> 
<li> Lisa Davis <br>

<p>Truvia is made from Stevia, which is a green plant (you can grow it in your 
garden.) the problem with Truvia, Stevia, and similar products made from this 
plant, is the peculiar aftertaste.</p> 
<p>Lisa Davis</p> </li> 
<li> Heidi Hatch <br>

<p>Great article! What about Stevia? Stevia is supposed to be a great all 
natural sweeter, very low in calories, and sweeter than sugar so you use less. 
Is it bad for you as well?</p> </li>

<p>Beware the Corn People</p> 
<p>Thank you for giving me something in writing to show my friends and family, 
absolving me from being the paranoid conspiracy theorist I was accused of being 
when the pro corn sugar ad campaign came out in full force and I said, 
&ldquo;Beware.&rdquo; &nbsp;For those of you &nbsp;who are sick and tired of 
hearing me recommend a viewing of FOOD INC., maybe you should cut back on the 
sugar. &nbsp;&gt;:{)</p> </li> 
<li> Twannap <br>

<p>Great article. I switched to agave nectar a year ago. I thought I had found 
a healthy way to sweeten my coffee. I know, doffee, another no, no.</p> </li> 
<li> Marykarenmerrill <br>

<p>Could you mention where honey would fit in all this.</p> </li> 
<li> Anyelina <br>

<p>I only take blue organic agave and I&rsquo;m hypoglycemic, has been very 
good for me, I don&rsquo;t have sweet cravings, I haven&rsquo;t gained weight. 
I only take it for my hot tea. I don&rsquo;t &nbsp;see why is too bad the agave 
and accelerate aging. Agave is not processed sugar.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li> Rosy Outlook <br>

<p>For those of us with the badly neglected problem of Low Blood Sugar, 
fructose is the worst!.&nbsp;&nbsp; I may as well have taken a sleeping pill. 
It knocks me out in minutes.&nbsp; About the fructose in the fruit itself, I 
have to treat it with extreme caution.&nbsp; No fruit in the morning.&nbsp; 
Only that which is not very sweet such as fresh blueberries, peaches, etc does 
not drain away all my energy.&nbsp; I go into a semi-coma and cannot remember 
to drink water to wash it out of my system.&nbsp; Later in the day, in very 
small quantities, my system will tolerate regular sugar, especially if right 
after a meal.&nbsp; Forget about stevia, and all the other sugar subs, not good 
in more ways than one.&nbsp; Any info you can give regarding hypoglycemia would 
be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; We are the step children of the medics.&nbsp; 
Please refer me to any articles that might be helpful that I missed.&nbsp;

<p>honey is probably the best sweetener, made up of only monosaccaride (single 
celled and requires no digestion) sugars, but still is sugar.and will have 
negative effects on blood sugar and diabetes syndromes.<br>
 I avoid all 
sugar&nbsp; and sugar substitutes except sugars in foods and honey&nbsp; as per 
the Specific Carbohydrate Diet</p> </li> 
<li> Kami <br>

<p>I &nbsp;have only used Zylitol for the last 2 years and I don&rsquo;t miss 
sugar at all ! I buy it at my local healthfood store &nbsp;I use it in baking 
and for coffee,tea, pancakes etc and the kids love it. They don&rsquo;t even 
know the difference and it is helping them ward off cavities I am sure ! They 
have gum now with Zylitol too,Trident I think it is, but just keep it away from 
the animals ..their systems can&rsquo;t process it and it can be deadly to them.
</p> </li> 
<li> Xray5696 <br>

<p>actually, no matter what you eat, any carbs turn to sugar!!</p> </li> 
<li> Gch809 <br>

<p>thank you, I like to get specifics on HFCS, etc. I&rsquo;m diabetic, was 
using Agave syrup instead of honey or sugar or Splenda. Now I&rsquo;ll just add 
a sprinkle of cinamon.</p> </li> 
<li> Norman <br>

<p>Sugar, Saccharine,&nbsp; Agave, Stevia, Aspartame (NutraSweet), Sorbitol 
and all the real and substitute sweetners and i believe soon even Zylitol will 
all be found to be harmful in one way or another.<br>
 In truth we do not need 
any of these. They confound our bodies and cause a reaction somewhere along the 
line.<br>
 Give them all up. Not easy i know. I managed it with sugar in my tea 
nearly 40years ago and still trouble with the occasional chocolate and piece of 
cake but for health and long life i say stay away from any sweetener what ever 
it&rsquo;s name as best i can.</p> </li>

<p>Excellent article. Only one missing piece of data on the history of corn 
syrup and its dangers. That is, the resulting contamination of the cornstarch 
in the manufacturing process, which leaves mercury traces in the cornstarch, 
which is then made into corn syrup. That is the industry&rsquo;s dirty little 
secret, which makes this form of sweetness and its contamination far more 
deadly than other forms.</p> 
<p>The process dates back to the 70&prime;s, when the conflict in the 
Dominican Republic put a strain on US sugar supplies and costs shot up. The 
corn syrup industry went into high gear using this new process and here we are 
today, with&nbsp; mercury-laced sweetness in the majority of foods on the shelf.
<br> It&rsquo;s not your great-grandmother&rsquo;s Karo syrup from World War 
II. The &ldquo;improved&rdquo; form today, with mercury, creates many more 
diseases than just raising your blood sugar.</p> </li>

<p>My son&rsquo;s doc. (when my son was only 9 -many years ago) said he could 
have Tupelo honey which comes from bees only left to get nectar from Tupelo 
trees when&nbsp; they are blooming &nbsp;is ok for any blood sugar problem 
because it does not stimulate the pancreas.&nbsp; Only in moderation 
however!&nbsp; Look online and you can find some good prices.</p> </li>

<p>Try Tupelo honey -reccommended by my son&rsquo;s doc.. My son had low blood

ramily.com and order the books from the Boutenko family.&nbsp; Very easy to 
read, great recipes, lotsa of laughs in the stories of how their family went 
raw, and heavily footnoted.&nbsp; Especially check out the pictures and stroies 
of the guy who went from 400 to 170 on the green diet&ndash;he tells exactyly 
how he did it and does it&ndash;so ridiculously simple!&nbsp; Muches on 
veggies, drinks lotsa water, and makes a gallon of drink to last through the 
day&hellip;Gery hair turned back to brown, bald spot filled in, eyes healed and 
threw glasses away, skin tightend up naturally as he lost the weight, skin also

we&rsquo;re in the 7th generation of humans who departed from raw and green 
diet and tells the effects it&rsquo;s had on us.&nbsp; Been convenient, but 
that is the only benefit&ndash;the health results have been 
disastrous&ndash;though not for the profits of the &ldquo;food industry, the

<p>Did you read the article? Agave IS a processed sugar, it&rsquo;s not like 
you are sucking on the leaves to get the sweetness. I tried Agave, having 
bought the hype as well. After a few days I had to stop using it, it was giving 
me diarrhea and I was only using it in my coffee, maybe two spoonfuls a day. 
I&rsquo;m back to Truvia as I do not get the aftertaste some mention. I was 
going to give the agave to a neighbor to try, but now I will just trash it.</p>

<p>Xylitol is a good sugar substitute, but it too has its 
drawbacks&hellip;namely GI distress. On the plus side, it has been shown to be 
good for your teeth and gums, which is why many sugar-free gum and mints use it.

<p>While honey is a natural food, it is still a source of sugar, as it does 
affect your glucose and insulin levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rosy,</p> 
<p>Thanks for your story. We will need to do a story on hypoglycemia in the 
very near future. More and more research is showing that it is actually an 
early warning sign of EXCESS blood sugar, not too little and that it is a 
withdrawal symptom.</p>

<p>Heidi,</p> 
<p>Stevia seems to be a good sugar alternative. Very little chemical 
processing and derived from a naturally sweet herb, with a tinge of bitterness.
</p> 
<p>Expect an in-depth article on ALL sugar substitutes in the near future.</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p>

<p>Lisa (and Dee),</p> 
<p>Truvia is comprised of three ingredients: rebiana (which comes from 
stevia), erythritol (a naturally occurring sugar alcohol), and natural flavors. 
The first two are okay, but we&rsquo;d like to know a bit more about these 
&ldquo;flavors.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p> 
<p>The Sherpa</p> </li> 
<li>  http://naturalhealthsherpa.com Natural Health Sherpa <br>

<p>Right now, stevia is your best option.</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p>

<p>Inulin fiber is fine&hellip;and all natural. In fact, it&rsquo;s quite good 
in fact for diabetes. In this particular case, you did seem to get what you 
expected.</p>

<p>Dijmyers,</p> 
<p>We are definitely working on a future article that will cover: honey, maple

<p>Electrofish,</p> 
<p>Xylitol doesn&rsquo;t affect your blood sugar/insulin levels like HFCS or 
agave (or honey for that matter). But, for some people, it can cause GI 
distress.</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p> 
<p>The Sherpa</p> </li> 
<li> Anyelina <br>

<p>Sorry but I&rsquo;m just skeptical about what the article says about agave.
</p> </li> 
<li> Dppeterson <br>

<p>Agreed that sugar is sugar &ndash; but Organic RAW blue agave syrup is one 
of the least offensive.&nbsp; Same with the RAW organic honey.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li> Jchezny-16 <br>

<p>Yeah, the same was said about flouride years ago.</p> </li> 
<li> Bronxgirl_51 <br>

<p>thanks for setting everyone straight about hfcs&nbsp; now if everyone will 
just listen and stop using the stuff</p> </li> 
<li> Katie Lyn <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you failed to mention that when the body 
ingests HFCS, it does not recognize it as a food.&nbsp; It does not satisfy 
hunger.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is actually an appetite enhancer.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;But, the body does recognize the calories in the HFCS.&nbsp; The more you 
eat, the more weight you pack on.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t used products 
containing it in years.&nbsp; And it is beginning to be harder to find products 
without it.&nbsp; Unless they are imports from countries that have outlawed 
HFCS.</p> </li> 
<li> Suekoki <br>

<p>like it , very useful</p> </li> 
<li> Ajvampa <br>

<p>Great artcle.&nbsp; Wish more people would read it and follow the advice 
and in formation</p> </li>

<p>Unfortunately, organic doesn&rsquo;t matter when it comes to boosting 
insulin levels. And raw doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter much as well. If you have 
studies, etc. to the contrary, please let us know! While raw organic honey does 
have a few health benefits, it does affect blood sugar, same as agave.</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p>

<p>Love the analogies &ndash; makes it easy to remember when I want to share 
with my students.&nbsp; Keep up the great work!</p> </li> 
<li> Vertigowstewart <br>

<p>The&nbsp;HFCS pushers as well as this article fail to take into account 
that HFCS is extracted from geneticly modified (intentionally mutated) 
corn.&nbsp; Myriad long term side effects are bound to occur from people eating 
mutant processed sugar, a hefty price to pay for tickling your taste buds.</p> 
</li> 
<li> Vertigowstewart <br>

<p>Right on, but the worst news is that HFCS comes from geneticly modified 
corn rife with toxins, allergens, etc. from the mutation.</p> </li> 
<li>  http://naturalhealthsherpa.com Natural Health Sherpa <br>

<p>You are absolutely correct about GMOs and corn. Thanks for pointing that 
out!</p>

<p>omg I&rsquo;ve been sabotaging my health by eating &ldquo;diet&rdquo; 
snacks! I just tossed them all including the Atkins bars which have an 
ingredient called fructooligosaccharides in them.Thanks for the info.<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 However, I don&rsquo;t see how the corn being geneticly modified 
makes any difference. After all the sweet yellow corn we all love has been 
developed from the original, multi-colored, not-so-sweet native corn.</p> </li> 
<li>  http://twitter.com/HeidiSkarie Heidi Skarie <br>

<p>Great article. &nbsp;Corn syrup is one of the causes of type 2 diabetes. 
&nbsp;I&rsquo;m glad to know Agave is &nbsp;just as bad and more expensive.</p> 
</li>

<p>Heidi,</p> 
<p>Glad you found the article informative!</p>

<p>Leslie,</p> 
<p>Fructooligosaccharides (or FOS) is actually okay, but you are still smart 
to toss the bars for a variety of other reasons.</p> 
<p>The issue with GM corn is the amount of chemicals it contains. While the 
entire issue is quite complicated, the short story is that the corn is 
genetically modified to be resistant to bugs and disease by adding chemicals 
into the seeds. Those chemicals are then consumed by you. Not good.</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p> 
<p>The Sherpa</p> </li>

<p>I used agave for a while, and developed massive diarrhoea. If your 
digestive system is sensitive, as mine is, it&rsquo;s a no-go.</p> </li> 
<li> Tongman95 <br>

<p>I had been using agave in my coffee as a sugar substitute, but will not be 
going forward. It sounds as though regular sugar would be better than agave. Is 
that correct? And would you recommen honey over sugar/agave to sweeten coffee?
</p> 
<p>Yes, I know coffee isn&rsquo;t good in the first place. Just like my 
morning Joe.</p> </li> 
<li> patrick <br>

<p>Want to add one small correction regarding HFCS and sucrose (table 
sugar).&nbsp; There is actually a small chemical difference:&nbsp; HFCS 
contains glucose and fructose in free form (not chemically bonded) while 
sucrose is just as described in the article (chemically bonded).&nbsp; Whether 
this makes a difference or not during digestion and absorption is still under 
debate, however some evidence indicates that&nbsp;fructose in the free form 
(HFCS) may bring about the harmful changes described in the article faster 
and/or more efficiently than chemically bonded fructose.&nbsp; Either way, the 
information in the article is spot on, and it is most likely the total fructose 
intake that is driving the insulin resistance and other metabolic changes that 
are helping making us as a nation so sick.<br>
 I would also like to comment 
that I get concerned when I see people blaming 1 thing (ie HFCS) for the health 
problems so many people suffer from such as diabetes.&nbsp; Diabetes, heart 
disease, cancer, obesity and all the other diseases of lifestyle have multiple 
contributers including excess calorie and carbohydrate consumption, lack of 
exercise, low fruit and vegetable intake etc. etc.&nbsp; HFCS is a contributor 
to poor health, especially when ingested in large quantities, but it 
doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;cause&rdquo; anything all by itself&hellip;it takes 
several contributing factors together to cause those diseases.</p> </li> 
<li> Marykarenmerrill <br>

<p>what about honey? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what I use.</p> </li> 
<li> Steeny <br>

<p>Ever since having been told to go on a no-carb, no-sugar diet by my 
naturopath to rid myself of some troubling symptoms (overgrowth of Candida was 
the main culprit and I had huge success with that diet after three months, but 
largely stick to it on a regular basis), my sweetener of choice has been 
stevia.&nbsp; So far I&rsquo;ve not found anything negative about it.&nbsp; The 
first time I tried it, I didn&rsquo;t like the taste, but after being 
completely sugar-free (including no sweet fruits for the first few weeks of the 
diet), I appreciated that bit of sweetness and still do.</p> </li> 
<li> Icehillmd <br>

<p>could there be a printable form of this articlr? Paul</p> </li>

<p>With honey, moderation is the key. It can still impact your insulin 
reaction.</p>

<p>Patrick,</p> 
<p>Thank you so much for including the chemistry distinction for HFCS and it 
being unbonded. We are glad you liked the article and we agree that we have a 
long road ahead of us in relation to total fructose intake.</p> 
<p>Additionally, we agree with your that when it comes to health problems, it 
is rarely just one thing.</p> 
<p>Given the focused nature of our articles, we are only able to highlight one 
facet of that equation. We always encourage a healthy diet, regular exercise, 
and overall lifestyle as being the real key to longevity and optimum health.</p>
<p>Naturally yours,</p> 
<p>The Sherpa</p> </li> 
<li>  http://naturalhealthsherpa.com Natural Health Sherpa <br>

<p>Of the options you listed, honey would be your better bet. We will be 
writing additional articles over the next few weeks that address more sugar 
substitutes. Keep your eyes out for them!</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p> 
<p>The Sherpa</p> </li>

<p>That is a common side effect for many people. It is a pretty good reason to 
pass on the agave.</p>

<p>HFCS &ndash; There have been numerous articles pertaining to the harm that 
this is doing to our health.&nbsp; Initially the food industry found this 
product a much less expensive method of sweetening our foods and so the 
HFCS&nbsp; has been used in more and more things. &nbsp; The HFCS has saved the 
food industry countless dollars and increased their profits 
expotentially.&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp; The only benefit has been to the Food 
Industry Income.</p> 
<p>As I understand this subject, it is the HFCS which helps with the belly fat 
(which we all hate).&nbsp; It seems we should go back a lot closer to 
basics.&nbsp; Fress fruits &ndash; fresh vegetables, less white flour products, 
more berries, nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we get a large amount of the added sugars 
out of our diets we will be a lot closer to having the good health we all 
desire.</p> 
<p>It is up to us to take charge of our health, add those healthy foods, add a 
good quality &ldquo;Juicer&rdquo; to our kitchen and make good green/fruit 
drinks or if you perfer there are good quality &ldquo;green juice 
products&rdquo; which you can purchase.&nbsp; You will be amazed at how much 
energy the green drinks give with no caffine but don&rsquo;t drink within 
three-four hours of bed time, if you expect to sleep during the night.</p> </li>

<p>How about an article on&nbsp;Xylitol.<br>
 Is the Birch better than the 
corn xylitol?<br>
 It tastes just like sugar, but is it good?</p> </li> 
<li> Bonniejean <br>

<p>Wow! I did not know that about Agave!!! I thought it was A-OK&hellip;.til I 
read the above article!!! thank you for the bottom line.&nbsp; We know about 
high fructose corn syrup, and have practically eliminated all fruit 
juices&hellip;&hellip;one MUST read labels to stay healthy.</p> </li> 
<li> Bob <br>

<p>I love these articles, info. did not know or forgot. keep them coming. Bob R
</p> </li> 
<li> A. Rowboat <br>

<p>The article does not mention that a&nbsp;professor of internal medicine 
liver&nbsp;doctor links fructose and high fructose corn syrup use with 
permanent scarring of the liver. You have one liver and cannot live without it. 
Read the labels on fruit juices, bottled teas, breakfast pastries, pie 
fillings,&nbsp;ketchup, anything sweetened. One citrus&nbsp;juice manufacturer 
plastic bottle says no HFCS yet&nbsp;adds highly controversial canola oil.</p>

<p>thank you for clarifying the truth about HFCS and Agave syrup. I have agave 
at home and will watch how much I use it. Can you tell us about Zilitol which 
is made from trees. I use toothpaste that has it. I also have it as a sugar 
substitute . I know if I put too much of Zilitol in coffee I get the runs. In 
Europe it has been used for centuries and I know it is a great tooth cavity 
reducer.&nbsp;Thank you.</p> </li> 
<li> Gch809 <br>

<p>Jerry: I read recently that HFCS is not metabloised in the intestines, 
rather in the liver, where it is unable to convert it into energy (sucrose) and 
it sent out directly as fat, to our storage lockers, in perpetuity. Whereas 
sucrose is metabolised in the intestines, sent out to the bloodsteam as energy 
fuel.&nbsp;Is this true, partly true ????</p> </li>

<p>Shirley,</p> 
<p>Thank you for your feedback! We agree that whole foods and less sugars is 
the key to health. So watch the juicer. It strips the fiber and turns the 
&ldquo;whole food&rdquo; into nutrient-dense sugar water. If you want to juice, 
use a high-speed blender so you liquify and consume the entire food.</p>

<p>I had my first gout attack about 10 years ago.<br>
 At the beginning I was 
having attacks every 6 months. Then gradually I was getting them&nbsp;<br>
 
every 3 months, then every month and eventually every week.<br>
 It started at 
my big toe and then it was moving sometimes in my knees,and generally all&nbsp;
<br> around my joints, in my feet.And the pain was agonising.<br>
 I have tried 
all the cures you can imagine.I tried ACV, lemons, drinking a lot of water, 
but&nbsp;<br>
 to no avail.I tried water fasting, juice fasting,baking soda, 
again without success.<br>
 I almost gave up meat, limiting it &nbsp;to only 
once a week ,gave up alcohol completely,again&nbsp;<br>
 no success.<br>
 I was 
living on &nbsp;vegetables, lots and lots of fresh fruit, milk ,cheese beans 
and so on .My&nbsp;<br>
 eating habits could not be healthier ,or so I 
thought.But my gout was worsening.<br>
 Then I decided to increase the amount 
of fruit I was consuming, thinking that if some fruit&nbsp;<br>
 is healthy, 
more fruit will be more healthy.Some days I was eating fruit only ,others over 
10&nbsp;<br>
 portions a day.<br>
 And alas my gout instead of improving it 
became chronic ,it was there all the time.&nbsp;<br>
 I was desperate I did not 
know what to do.<br>
 And then one day accidentally I read an article about 
fructose,which is contained in fruit in&nbsp;<br>
 large quantities.It said 
that it increases uric acid, in a matter of minutes.<br>
 Fructose is also 
present in table sugar, and &nbsp;in HFCS, which is used in soft drinks.<br>
 I 
put two and two together and realised what I was doing wrong.<br>
 I stopped 
eating fruit and all other sugars, for a period of 3 weeks,and by magic I saw 
a&nbsp;<br>
 dramatic improvement.Pain was gone, swelling was gone, I was fine.
<br> I re introduced fruit again in my diet but reducing them to 1 or 2 a day, 
and my gout completely&nbsp;<br>
 disappeared.<br>
 I do eat more meat now, and 
occasionally have an alcoholic drink, and thank God &nbsp;everything&nbsp;<br>
 
seems to be fine.<br>
 Fructose was my enemy.</p> </li>

<p>corn is &ldquo;natural?&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t most of it, these days,

<li> Worksida <br>

<p>Thanks for the info. Great reminder for me to keep it as real as possible.
</p> </li> 
<li> Kim Houghton <br>

<p>I needed that reminder. Your article made me question my use of maple 
syrup. I buy it when we make pancakes because it seems healthier than other 
options, but am I right about that?</p> </li> 
<li> RKentspeth <br>

<p>Have there been any studies done about agave nectar, and its impact on 
health? &nbsp;I understand the reasoning in your article, but would like to see 
it accompanied by some well-designed studies. &nbsp;Thanks!</p> </li> 
<li>  http://www.facebook.com/shirley.gekler Shirley Gekler <br>

<p>Thank you for this article.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your explanation as to the 
composition of table sugar (a&nbsp; 50/50 mix of glucose and fructose) and High 
Fructose Corn Syrup used in sodas (a mix of 45/55 mix of glucose and fructose) 
doesn&rsquo;t at first seem to be so different, but it is everywhere, sodas, 
processed foods.&nbsp; The HFCS in Coke&nbsp; -&nbsp; 12 oz can&nbsp;&nbsp; 
39grams&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; 20 oz bottle&nbsp; 65grams.&nbsp; When we receive 
fructose in&nbsp; fruits, we are also getting phytochemicals and fibres which 
are needed for our good health.</p> 
<p>Agave syrup basically HFCS &mdash; depending on the processing has a 
57%-90% fructose content which doesn&rsquo;t qualify as the health food that 
was promoted.&nbsp; I think this is a case where the processing may have taken 
a good item and completely ruined for human consumption.</p> 
<p>Thanks for making the complex simple.</p> </li> 
<li>  http://www.facebook.com/shirley.gekler Shirley Gekler <br>

<p>&nbsp;RKentspeth:&nbsp; Rather than summarize the information found by a 
simple google search, I would suggest that you google &ldquo;agave nectar 
bad&rdquo;.&nbsp; You will find an article by Dr. Joseph Mercola, which will 
explain the subject in great detail.</p> 
<p>I believe that the team at Natural Health Sherpa did research this 
information prior to writing the above article.&nbsp; But it is always good to 
read two well researched articles that give the same basic message.&nbsp; 
Perhaps it gives more credibilty.&nbsp; I trust that his reply is helpful for 
you as well as others.</p> </li> </ul>
