<h1>Artificial sweeteners: Understanding these and other sugar substitutes</h1>
<h2>Whether your goal is cutting calories or eating healthier, options for 
sugar substitutes abound. Understand their pros and cons to make an informed 
choice.</h2> By Mayo Clinic staff 
<p> If you're trying to reduce the sugar and calories in your diet, you may be 
turning to artificial sweeteners or other sugar substitutes. You aren't alone. 
The popularity of artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes is on the 
rise as manufacturers and consumers seek lower calorie alternatives to regular 
white sugar without sacrificing sweetness.</p> 
<p> Today, artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes are found in a 
variety of food and beverages marketed as &quot;sugar-free&quot; or 
&quot;diet,&quot; including soft drinks, chewing gum, jellies, baked goods, 
candy, fruit juice and ice cream. In addition, other sugar substitutes are 
being touted as healthier sweeteners than regular sugar, even if they don't 
have fewer calories, such as honey and agave nectar.</p> 
<p> Just what are all these artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes? And 
what's their role in your diet?</p> 
<h2>Understanding artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes</h2> 
<p> Sugar substitutes are loosely considered any sweetener that you use 
instead of regular table sugar (sucrose). Artificial sweeteners are just one 
type of sugar substitute. Some sugar substitutes, such as aspartame, are 
promoted because they add virtually no calories to your diet. Newer sugar 
substitutes, including stevia and agave nectar, claim to be lower calorie, 
tastier and healthier options.</p> 
<p> The topic of sugar substitutes can be complex and confusing. One problem 
is that the terminology regarding sugar substitutes is often open to 
interpretation. For instance, some manufacturers call their sweeteners 
&quot;natural&quot; even though they're processed or refined, as is the case 
with stevia preparations. And some artificial sweeteners are derived from 
naturally occurring substances &mdash; sucralose comes from sugar, for example. 
Sometimes sugar substitutes are categorized by whether or not they contain 
calories.</p> 
<p> Regardless of what they're called or how they're classified, sugar 
substitutes aren't magic bullets for weight loss. Take a closer look.</p> 
<h2>Artificial sweeteners</h2> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are synthetic sugar substitutes but may be derived 
from naturally occurring substances, including herbs or sugar itself. 
Artificial sweeteners are also known as intense sweeteners because they are 
many times sweeter than regular sugar.</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners currently approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Acesulfame potassium (Sunett, Sweet One)</li> 
<li>Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet)</li> 
<li>Neotame</li> 
<li>Saccharin (SugarTwin, Sweet'N Low)</li> 
<li>Sucralose (Splenda)</li> </ul> 
<p> FDA approval is being sought for other artificial sweeteners. And some 
sweeteners, such as cyclamate, are not approved in the United States but are 
approved for use in other countries.</p> 
<p> <strong>Uses for artificial sweeteners<br>
</strong>Artificial sweeteners 
are attractive alternatives to sugar because they add virtually no calories to 
your diet. In addition, you need only a fraction compared with the amount of 
regular sugar you would normally use for sweetness. Artificial sweeteners are 
widely used in processed products, including tabletop sweeteners, baked goods, 
soft drinks, powdered drink mixes, candy, puddings, canned foods, jams and 
jellies, dairy products, and scores of other foods and beverages. Check the 
food label to see if a product contains artificial sweeteners.</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are also popular for home use. Some can even be used 
in baking or cooking. Certain recipes may need modification, though, because 
artificial sweeteners provide no bulk or volume, as does sugar. Check the 
labels on artificial sweeteners for appropriate home use.</p> 
<p> Some artificial sweeteners may leave an aftertaste. You may need to 
experiment with artificial sweeteners to find one or a combination that you 
enjoy most.</p> 
<p> <strong>Possible health benefits of artificial sweeteners</strong> </p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Weight control.</strong> One of the most appealing aspects of 
artificial sweeteners is that they are non-nutritive &mdash; they have 
virtually no calories. In contrast, each gram of regular table sugar contains 4 
calories. A teaspoon of sugar is about 4 grams. For perspective, consider that 
one 12-ounce can of a sweetened cola contains 8 teaspoons of added sugar, or 
about 130 calories. If you're trying to lose weight or prevent weight gain, 
products sweetened with artificial sweeteners rather than with higher calorie 
table sugar may be an attractive option. On the other hand, some research has 
suggested that consuming artificial sweeteners may be associated with increased 
weight, but the cause is not yet known.</li> 
<li><strong>Diabetes.</strong> Artificial sweeteners may be a good alternative 
to sugar if you have diabetes. Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners generally 
don't raise blood sugar levels because they are not carbohydrates. But because 
of concerns about how sugar substitutes are labeled and categorized, always 
check with your doctor or dietitian about using any sugar substitutes if you 
have diabetes.</li> 
<li><strong>Dental cavities.</strong> Unlike sugar, artificial sweeteners 
don't contribute to tooth decay.</li> </ul> 
<p> <strong>Possible health concerns with artificial sweeteners<br>
</strong>
Artificial sweeteners have been the subject of intense scrutiny for decades. 
Critics of artificial sweeteners say that they cause a variety of health 
problems, including cancer. That's largely because of studies dating to the 
1970s that linked saccharin to bladder cancer in laboratory rats. Because of 
those studies, saccharin once carried a warning label that it may be hazardous 
to your health.</p> 
<p> But according to the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies, 
there's no sound scientific evidence that any of the artificial sweeteners 
approved for use in the United States cause cancer or other serious health 
problems. And numerous research studies confirm that artificial sweeteners are 
generally safe in limited quantities, even for pregnant women. As a result of 
the newer studies, the warning label for saccharin was dropped.</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are regulated by the FDA as food additives. They 
must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before being made available for sale. 
In some cases, the FDA declares a substance &quot;generally recognized as 
safe&quot; (GRAS). These GRAS substances, including highly refined stevia 
preparations, are deemed by qualified professionals based on scientific data as 
being safe for their intended use, or they have such a lengthy history of 
common use in food that they're considered generally safe and don't require FDA 
approval before sale.</p> 
<p> The FDA has also established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for each 
artificial sweetener. This is the maximum amount considered safe to consume 
each day over the course of your lifetime. ADIs are intended to be about 100 
times less than the smallest amount that might cause health concerns.</p> Next
