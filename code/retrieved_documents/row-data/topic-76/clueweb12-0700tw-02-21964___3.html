 If you&rsquo;ve 
wandered into a natural food store lately, you might have noticed that the 
selection of sweeteners seems to have multiplied. Powders, syrups, and liquids 
with exotic-sounding names catch your eye, each claiming to be tastier, 
healthier, or more environmentally-friendly than plain old table sugar. But are 
they really any better? Is it worth the extra expense and hassle of deviating 
from the mainstream to try &ldquo;natural&rdquo; sweeteners? Whether you choose 
natural,artificial or conventional sweeteners is up to you. This article 
provides a rundown of the most common types of &ldquo;natural&rdquo; sweeteners 
you&rsquo;ll find on the market to help you decide.<br>
<br>
<b>Sugarcane 
Sweeteners</b> <br>
Sugarcane is a tropical grass that has been cultivated by 
humans for thousands of years. Making what we know as table sugar from 
sugarcane can range from a relatively simple to a multistep process, and the 
final result varies depending on the specific steps in the process. Light and 
dark brown, powdered, and granulated white sugars are all highly refined, while 
others, like those listed below, are made with fewer steps on the processing 
chain. Fewer steps benefit the environment, because less processing means less 
environmental impact. It also means that more of the vitamins and minerals that 
naturally occur in sugarcane remain in the end product. All of these sugarcane 
sweeteners can be found in the baking aisle and/or bulk bins of natural foods 
stores.
<ul> 
<li><b>Blackstrap molasses</b>, unlike other sugarcane sweeteners, contains 
significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. &ldquo;First&rdquo; molasses is 
left over when sugarcane juice is boiled, cooled, and removed of its crystals. 
If this product is boiled again, the result is called second molasses.<i>
Blackstrap</i> molasses is made from the <i>third</i> boiling of the sugar 
syrup and is the most nutritious molasses, containing substantial amounts of 
calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron. When buying, consider choosing organic 
blackstrap molasses, as pesticides are more likely to be concentrated due to 
the production of molasses.<b>Cooking notes: </b>Blackstrap molasses has a very 
strong flavor, so it is best to just replace a small portion of sugar with 
molasses.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Rapadura</b> is the Portuguese name for unrefined dried sugarcane 
juice. Probably the least refined of all sugarcane products, rapadura is made 
simply by cooking juice that has been pressed from sugarcane until it is very 
concentrated, and then drying and granulating it or, traditionally, pouring it 
into a mold to dry in brick form, which is then shaved. Because the only thing 
that has been removed from the original sugarcane juice is the water, rapadura 
contains all of the vitamins and minerals that are normally found in sugarcane 
juice, namely iron. A German company called Rapunzel is the main company that 
markets pure, organic rapadura in the U.S.<b>Cooking notes: </b>Rapadura 
replaces sugar 1:1 and adds a molasses flavor and dark color, so it&rsquo;s 
great in baked goods like brownies, coffee and black tea, but it may not be 
desirable in something like lemonade.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Sucanat</b> stands for <b>su</b>gar-<b>ca</b>ne-<b>nat</b>ural, and is 
very similar to rapadura. It is made by mechanically extracting sugarcane 
juice, which is then heated and cooled until tiny brown (thanks to the molasses 
content) crystals form. It contains less sucrose than table sugar (88 percent 
and 99 percent, respectively).<b>Cooking notes: </b>Sucanat replaces sugar 1:1 
and is also an accepted substitute for traditional brown sugar. Use it as you 
would rapadura (see above).<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Turbinado sugar</b> is often confused with sucanat, but the two are 
different. After the sugarcane is pressed to extract the juice, the juice is 
then boiled, cooled, and allowed to crystallize into granules (like sucanat, 
above). Next, these granules are refined to a light tan color by washing them 
in a centrifuge to remove impurities and surface molasses. Turbinado is lighter 
in color and contains less molasses than both rapadura and sucanat. A popular 
brand-name of turbinado sugar is Sugar in the Raw, which can be found in most 
natural food stores, and even in single-serve packets at coffee shops.<b>
Cooking notes:</b>Replaces sugar 1:1. Turbinado is a great substitute for brown 
sugar, too.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Evaporated cane juice</b> is essentially a finer, lighter-colored 
version of turbinado sugar. Still less refined than table sugar, it also 
contains some<i>trace</i> nutrients (that regular sugar does not), including 
vitamin B2. In Europe, it&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;unrefined sugar.&rdquo;
<strong>Cooking notes:</strong> Replaces sugar 1:1. Can be used in a wide 
variety of foods and recipes without adversely affecting color or flavor.</li> 
</ul> <b>Non-Sugarcane Sweeteners</b> <br>
Natural sweeteners are flooding the 
market these days. Here&rsquo;s a rundown of some of the most common ones that 
are not made from sugarcane.
<ul> 
<li><b>Agave nectar</b> is produced from the juice of the core of the agave, a 
succulent plant native to Mexico. Far from a whole food, agave juice is 
extracted, filtered, heated and hydrolyzed into agave syrup. Vegans often use 
agave as a honey substitute, although it&rsquo;s even sweeter and a little 
thinner than honey. It contains trace amounts of iron, calcium, potassium and 
magnesium. Agave nectar syrup is available in the baking aisle at most natural 
foods stores. The fructose content of agave syrup is much higher than that of
high fructose corn syrup, which is of concern since some research has linked 
high fructose intake to weight gain (especially around the abdominal area), 
high triglycerides, heart disease and insulin resistance. High fructose corn 
syrup contains 55% fructose while agave nectar syrup contains 90%. Despite 
this, it has a lowglycemic index because of its low <i>glucose</i> content. <b>
Cooking notes:</b>To replace 1 cup of sugar, use 2/3 cup of agave nectar, 
reduce the quantity of liquids slightly, and reduce the oven temperature by 25 
degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit. It also makes a good sweetener in cold liquids, such 
as iced tea.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Brown rice syrup</b> is made when cooked rice is cultured with enzymes, 
which break down the starch in the rice. The resulting liquid is cooked down to 
a thick syrup, which is about half as sweet as white sugar and has a mild 
butterscotch flavor. It is composed of about 50% complex carbohydrates, which 
break down more slowly in the bloodstream than simple carbohydrates, resulting 
in a less dramatic spike in blood glucose levels. It&rsquo;s worth noting that 
the name &ldquo;brown rice syrup&rdquo; describes the color of the syrup, not 
the rice it&rsquo;s made from, which is white.<b>Cooking notes: </b>To replace 
one cup of sugar, use 1-1/3 cups brown rice syrup, and for each cup of rice 
syrup added, reduce liquid by 1/4 cup and add 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. Brown 
rice syrup has the tendency to make food harder and crispier, so it&rsquo;s 
great in crisps, granolas, and cookies. You may want to combine it with another 
sweetener for cakes and sweet breads.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Honey</b>, made by bees from the nectar of flowers, is a ready-made 
sweetener that contains traces of nutrients.<b>Cooking notes: </b>To replace 1 
cup sugar in baked goods, use about 3/4 cup of honey and lower the oven 
temperature 25 degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit and reduce liquids by about 2 
Tablespoons for each cup of honey.<br>
&nbsp; </li> 
<li><b>Maple syrup</b> comes from the sap of maple trees, which is collected, 
filtered, and boiled down to an extremely sweet syrup with a distinctive 
flavor. It contains fewer calories and a higher concentration of minerals (like 
manganese and zinc) than honey. You can find it in bulk in some natural foods 
stores, but don&rsquo;t be fooled by fake maple syrups, which are cheaper and 
more readily available at the grocery store. &quot;Maple-flavored syrups&quot; 
are imitations of real maple syrup. To easily tell the difference, read the 
ingredients list on the nutrition label. True maple syrup contains nothing but 
&ldquo;maple syrup.&rdquo; Imitation syrups are primarily made of high fructose 
corn syrup, sugar, and/or artificial sweeteners, and contain 3 percent maple 
syrup (or less).<b>Cooking notes: </b>To replace 1 cup sugar in baking, use 
about 3/4 cup of maple syrup and lower the oven temperature 25 degrees 
Fahrenheit. For each cup of maple syrup, reduce liquids by about 2 tablespoons.
</li> </ul> Here&rsquo;s a chart of how these sweeteners compare with one 
another and with regular table sugar:<br>
<br>
<b>Sweetener</b> <b>Serving size
</b> <b>Calories</b> <b>Carbs</b> <b>Other nutrients of note</b> <br>
<b>White 
(table) sugar</b> 2 tsp 33 8 g None* <br>
<b>Blackstrap molasses</b> 2 tsp 32 8

potassium (10% DV), magnesium (7%DV), vitamin B6 (5% DV), selenium (4% DV) <br>

<b>Rapadura</b> 2 tsp 30 8 g None* <br>
<b>Sucanat</b> 2 tsp 30 8 g None* <br>

<b>Turbinado sugar</b> 2 tsp 30 8 g None* <br>
<b>Evaporated cane juice</b> 2 
tsp 30 8 g Riboflavin (3% DV), potassium (1% DV), manganese (1% DV), copper (1%

<b>Agave nectar syrup</b> 2 tsp 40 8 g None* <br>
<b>
Brown rice syrup</b> 2 tsp 40 10 g None* <br>
<b>Honey</b> 2 tsp 43 11 g None* 
<br> <b>Maple syrup</b> 2 tsp 45 9 g Manganese (22% DV), zinc (4% DV) <br>
<br>

<br> <i>*Less than 0.5% DV of any vitamins or minerals</i> <br>
<br>

SparkPeople's Licensed and Registered Dietitian, Becky Hand, notes that 
published recommendations say to limit added sugars from all sources tono more 
than 10%-15% of total calorie intake, which is 120 calories (7.5 tsp) of sugar 
for a 1,200-calorie diet.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that sugar is 
sugar. Too much sugar&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s marketed as 
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; or not&mdash;can harm your health.&nbsp; Even sweeteners 
touted as natural or nutritious, like the ones discussed here, don&rsquo;t 
typically add a<i>significant</i> source of vitamins or minerals to your diet. 
But in moderation, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the sweetness that a little 
sugar adds to life. So if you&rsquo;re going to eat it, eat the good 
stuff...just not too much of it.<br>

<p>I've been eating savory eats for years, but I recently discovered that with 
the smooth, porridgelike texture of Irish oats, I prefer some sweetness to 
balance the savory. The combination of rosemary and maple, with a hint of spice
