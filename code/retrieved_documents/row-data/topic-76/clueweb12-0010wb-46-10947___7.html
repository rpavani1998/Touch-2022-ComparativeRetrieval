<h2>Love 'em.</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I use Splenda, Sweet N Low (for tea only), and occasionally Stevia. I 
don't believe they're good for me, but I'm diabetic and in my case I think 
sugar would be worse. I do make a point of avoiding aspartame and agava because 
of things I've read. While it has not been established, there is at least some 
evidence from reputable sources that aspartame is a neurotoxin. Again, that has 
not been scientifically proven, but I prefer to avoid it. I also avoid sugar 
alcohols. They cause flatulence and seem to run my sugar up as much or more 
that things with real sugar.</dd>

<dd> You might be convinced you&rsquo;re doing the right thing for your health 
and the health of your family by using products artificially sweetened. You 
couldn&rsquo;t be more mistaken. It&rsquo;s not pleasant to learn that 
corporations, government-sponsored regulatory agencies and politicians are more 
interested in lining their pockets than protecting your health. These are 
serious issues that you must consider for you and your family&rsquo;s safety. 
Manufacturers, marketers and others with financial interests have successfully 
convinced millions of consumers the chemicals used in artificially sweetened 
products are safe. Don&rsquo;t believe them! . For now, just keep in mind that 
the reason you feel products containing artificial sweeteners are safe is a 
direct result of deliberate deception on the part of big business and 
government.</dd>

<h2>Sweeteners</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I use natural sweeteners like xylitol, honey, maple syrup, and molasses. 
</dd>

<h2>Love Them Or Hate Them</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I use date sugar in as many foods as I can... it can leave a grittiness 
in some foods. The taste is super delicious. It's also healthy as it's 
completely natural &amp; has fiber.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;rosyview </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Honey is a wonderful sweetner</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I do not like artificial sweetners, the after taste really ruins the 
flavor of foods. I recently tasted the stevia sweetner, although it's suppose 
to be natural the after taste is just as bad as the artifical sugars. Honey is 
my very favorite natural sweetner, I love a good cup of tea honey and lemon.
</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Dori Bon </dt> </dl> 
<h2>sweeteners</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I ve been using sweeteners for a long time. I dont want to get extra 
calories from the sugar. I dont want to feed potential cancer cells in my body 
with sugar. I use 10-12 pellets a day, mostly in tea and coffeee, which is 
under the dangerous amount for human being.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Artificial Sweeteners</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> Yes,I use artificial sweetener because I love to eat sweet and still I do 
not want to add more calories to my body,it is best way to diet</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Mahesh Lohar </dt> </dl> 
<h2>love them</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I use Splenda. I treat sugar like its a drug, and avoid it. I don't like 
the way it makes me feel. I haven't heard of anyone dying from Splenda 
poisoning, but Diabetes and obesity are #1 killers!</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Edwina172 </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Hate Them</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I believe the philosophy if man made it don't eat it. I try to eat only 
natural foods. I use locally produced honey or stevia mostly. I was a sugar 
addict and recently discovered Gymnema that is helping me break that addiction.
</dd>

<h2>Love em!</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I have discovered Truvia which has the Stevia in it and it is sweeter and 
supposedly natural. Yummy!</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Tina </dt> </dl> 
<h2>User of Artifical Sweetners</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I use Splenda in coffee and in cooked oatmeal - the taste is good with no 
after taste. I plan to start using Splenda in baking where sugar is required to 
minimize the use of white sugar. Not a fan of Equal or Sweet &amp; Low; they 
seem to leave an after taste.</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;Guest Sandra </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Hate them!</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I can't drink any of the diet sodas wtih Aspartame in them, they give me 
a headache. We live with enough chemical exposure in our daily lives, why add 
to that exposure by ingesting yet another chemical?</dd> 
<dt> &mdash;DLinOKC </dt> </dl> 
<h2>Diet Soda</h2> 
<dl> 
<dd> I like diet soda because it has no calories. I actually don't like sugary 
soda now - it's too sweet.</dd>
