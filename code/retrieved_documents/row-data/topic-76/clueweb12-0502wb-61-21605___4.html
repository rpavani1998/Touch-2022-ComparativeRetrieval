<h1>Rare sugar may replace sucrose for bakery and beyond</h1> 
<p> By Stephen Daniells, 09-Jun-2008</p> 
<p>Related topics: Science &amp; Nutrition, Sweeteners (intense, bulk, polyols)
</p> 
<h4>
<p> The rare sugar D-psicose may be an ideal substitute for sucrose, and have 
the added benefits of boosting antioxidant activity and boosting shelf-life, 
say Japanese researchers.</p> </h4> 
<p> D-psicose is a non-calorie sugar with a reported lower glycemic response. 
It has 70 per cent the sweetness of sucrose, but also has functional properties 
like gelling activity, good flavour, as well as high antioxidation activity.</p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The sugar is not exploited to any great extent in the food industry, but 
research published in the<i>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</i> 
indicates the potential of the sugar to find application in a range of 
products, most notably as a sucrose substitute.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <i>&quot;The excessive consumption of sucrose can be ill-advised because 
of the high calorie content and a high glycemic response,&quot;</i> wrote lead 
author Yuanxia Sun from Kagawa University.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <i>&quot;On the other hand, artificial intense sweeteners (such as 
aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and cyclamate) are almost calorie-free, but 
their function is only to sweeten and inherently lack the bulk of sucrose.</i> 
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <i>&quot;Food formulators generally need to blend them with sugar to 
obtain successful end products. Hence, sucrose cannot be substituted by only 
intense sweeteners.&quot;</i> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> But the research indicates that D-psicose may be an effective substitute. 
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <b>Sweet potential</b> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The Japanese researchers investigated the effects of D-psicose on the 
foaming properties of egg white protein and the quality of butter cookies.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> According to the results, the foaming of the egg white protein was 
improved by the addition of D-psicose at a 15 per cent of sugar content. Under 
a longer whipping time, the researchers report that the D-psicose-egg white 
solution was<i>&quot;better in foaming capacity compared to sucrose- and 
fructose-egg white solutions.&quot;</i> </p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <i>&quot;The results did not show a clear mechanism by which addition of 
psicose induced the high foaming property of egg white protein, but confirmed 
that the addition of psicose was much more effective than the addition of 
sucrose, especially in the case of a longer whipping,&quot;</i> they wrote. </p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> For the cookies, the rare sugar was used as a partial sucrose replacer. No 
significant changes in cookie quality were reported.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <i>&quot;Conversely, it dramatically increased antioxidant substances 
produced through the Maillard reaction during heat processing,&quot;</i> added 
Sun.<i>&quot;The antiradical activity and reducing power of the cookies are 
strongly related to the colour change of the cookie crust.</i> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <i>&quot;Thus, D-psicose could be used as a sweetener to develop a 
functional food with a high antioxidant activity and a low calorie content by 
controlling the colour change of the final products,&quot;</i> they concluded. 
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <b>Sweetener market</b> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> According to market researcher Freedonia, overall sweetener prices are 
forecast to see erosion, following an increased dynamism in the sweetener 
industry, which is currently seeing a number of new options available after 
years of relative stability.</p>
