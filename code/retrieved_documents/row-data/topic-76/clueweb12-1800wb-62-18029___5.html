<h1>Real deal on artificial sweeteners</h1> <br>

<p>The use of sugar substitutes is on the rise as manufacturers look for ways 
to<strong>cut calories without losing sweetness</strong>. But what kind of 
chemicals go into sugar substitutes? Are they safe? And are there any natural 
alternatives?</p> 
<p>Weight loss plans work best of all when they fit around your lifestyle. 
Depriving yourself of every little treat will make your diet feel like a 
military program. Substituting your soft drink for the diet version or choosing 
a sweetener instead of sugar feels a little more civilised.</p> 
<p>However, there&rsquo;s more to those little white tablets than meets the 
eye. Alternative sweeteners can be natural or artificial, calorie-free or
<strong>just as calorific as sugar</strong>, and <strong>hundreds of times 
sweeter than sucrose</strong>, begging the question: do we really know what 
we&rsquo;re consuming?</p> 
<h3>What are alternative sweeteners?</h3> 
<p>Alternative sweetener is a catch-all phrase used to describe anything that 
is used in place of sugar &ndash; they could be<strong>artificial sweeteners
</strong>, such as the tabletop sweeteners Equal, Splenda, Sugarless, 
Hermesetas and Sucrayl, and those used in diet products, or<strong>sweeteners 
derived from natural sources</strong>, such as Stevia.</p> 
<p>There are a number of artificial sweeteners that have been approved for use 
in Australia by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ).<strong>
Aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin</strong> and <strong>sucralose </strong>are 
among the most popular. These provide the base for many diet food products, 
such as low-calorie yoghurts, desserts, soft drinks, biscuits and diet jellies.
</p> 
<p>They provide virtually no calories and the same sweetness as sugar for much 
smaller volumes. For this reason, sweeteners are often used with a bulking 
agent. You may find that some low-calorie products using artificial sweeteners 
have a different mouth feel to their sugared counterpart, or an aftertaste.</p> 
<p>Stevia is a sweetener that comes from a natural plant source. It has been 
cultivated as a sweetener since the 1970s in Japan and is 300 times sweeter 
than sugar. Because stevia has a<strong>negligible effect on blood sugar
</strong> it is popular with people on a low-carbohydrate diet.</p> 
<h3>Making the switch</h3> 
<p>Accredited Practising Dietitian and exercise physiologist Michael Lawler 
told My Blackmores that, for him, the jury is still out on alternative 
sweeteners.</p> 
<p> <strong>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pro-side and a con-side to artificial 
sweeteners,&rdquo;</strong> he said. &ldquo;If somebody has a lot of sugar in 
their diet and loves sweet food, they might still want to consume it while 
losing weight. In that case it can be a simple process of swapping over to diet 
versions of their favourite foods, creating a calorie deficit and losing 
weight.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>However, he argues that the &ldquo;ultra sweet&rdquo; taste of sweeteners 
<strong>attunes our tastebuds to a higher level of sweetness</strong>. Our 
tastebuds will begin to crave a sweeter taste and everything else will seem 
bland in comparison. This can escalate so that we no longer taste the natural 
sweetness in our fruits and vegetables, Lawler said.</p> 
<p>One common mistake is that slimmers sometimes think they can eat as much of 
a diet, sugar-free version of a product as they like and forget about the other 
nutrients.</p> 
<p> <strong>&ldquo;Just because a product is sugar-free doesn&rsquo;t mean 
it&rsquo;s low calorie,&rdquo;</strong>said Lawler. &ldquo;Manufacturers often 
have to bump up other ingredients to make up for the lack of sugar.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In addition to weight control, alternative sweeteners can be useful for 
people with<strong>diabetes</strong>. They tend not to raise blood-sugar levels 
because they are not carbohydrate. Your teeth will thank you for making the 
switch too, because artificial sweeteners don&rsquo;t contribute to<strong>
tooth decay</strong> like sugar does.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Personally I think it&rsquo;s better to <strong>change your taste
</strong> and wean yourself away from a high sugar diet. But for people who eat 
emotionally, artificial sweeteners can give them the space to deal with the 
reasons why they overeat before having to cope with a dramatically changed 
diet.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Best used in moderation</h3> 
<p>However, there are a few places where artificial sweeteners make an 
excellent alternative, Lawler said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re used to having an alcoholic drink, then diet soft 
drinks are a great option. Also, night time is the worst time to eat sugar so, 
if you always get a sweet craving before bed, diet jelly or diet dessert can 
take the edge off. Having said that,<strong>frozen berries and natural yoghurt
</strong>&nbsp;work just as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What if you&rsquo;re training for your sport? There&rsquo;s no research to 
suggest that sweeteners can reduce athletic performance but<strong>if you are 
doing a lot of cardio work you shouldn&rsquo;t need to worry about eating some 
sugar.</strong></p> 
<p>Lawler, who is also an exercise physiologist, said that <strong>some sugar 
immediately after a training session can improve muscle recovery</strong>. 
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend artificial sweeteners to a lean runner or a 
bodybuilder because they need the carbohydrate.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The best diets are balanced, varied and include all the major food groups, 
and all of the My Blackmores menu plans are based on this principle. Whether 
you choose table sugar, natural sweeteners or the artificial variety, 
don&rsquo;t forget to include them in your<strong>online diary</strong>&nbsp;to 
help you control your energy equation and nutrient profile.</p> <br>
