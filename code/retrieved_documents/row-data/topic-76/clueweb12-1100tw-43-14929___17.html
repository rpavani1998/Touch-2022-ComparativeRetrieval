While visiting friends, I bonded immediately with their two-year old son, 
Robbie. We played while the adults talked. After about an hour he got hungry 
and asked his mother for some of his favorite food, peanut butter.
<p></p> 
<p> Robbie ate 4 teaspoons straight from the jar and within minutes he turned 
into a whirling dervish, a cyclone of hyperactivity. He was banging his head 
against a pillow on my lap one minute and the next tearing down the hall to 
throw toys around his room. The parents seemed all too familiar with this 
behavior and began making excuses. He gets like this when we have company, when 
he's overtired, when he's excited.</p> 
<p> As a doctor, I immediately knew what the problem was - sugar. Robbie's 
parents had already figured out that indulging his sweet tooth lead to 
hyperactive episodes. But they didn't make the connection between the peanut 
butter and the behavior. I took the jar and showed them the label, which listed 
two different sugars (high fructose corn syrup and sugar). The parents were 
stunned and said they would be more diligent about cutting out the hidden 
sugars in their son's diet. When my husband saw Robbie's father a week later, 
he said Robbie was much calmer, was sleeping better, and was like a different 
person both at home and at daycare.</p> 
<p> Most people do realize that sugar can cause hyperactivity, but what they 
don't realize is that sugar lurks where you least expect to find it and affects 
the human body in myriad ways. The sugar industry vehemently denies that sugar 
is hazardous to human health. Are the parallel increases in sugar consumption, 
obesity, and diabetes just a coincidence? Here are the straight answers.</p> 
<p> <strong> I know sugar can lead to weight gain, but is it really all that 
bad for me?</strong><br>
 Yes, it really is. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate 
found naturally in many foods, including fruits and grains. If the only sugar 
we consumed were in natural, whole foods, we'd all be just fine. But the 
average American diet is full of refined, nutrient-depleted foods and contains 
an average of 20 teaspoons of added, refined sugar every day. That's twice the 
amount recommended by the USDA (10 teaspoons and four times the maximum I 
personally recommend.)</p> 
<p> So what's wrong with refined sugar? Many things. First, sugar compromises 
immune function. Two cans of soda (which contain 24 teaspoons of sugar) reduce 
the efficiency of white blood cells by 92 percent - an effect that lasts up to 
five hours, according to Kenneth Bock, M.D., an expert in nutritional and 
environmental health. Since white blood cells are an integral part of your 
immune system, if you happen to meet a nasty virus or bacteria within five 
hours of drinking a few colas, your immune system may be unable to fight off 
the invader.</p> 
<p> Refined sugar also overworks the pancreas and adrenal glands as they 
struggle to keep the blood sugar levels in balance. When you eat sugar, it is 
quickly absorbed into your blood stream in the form of glucose. This puts your 
pancreas into overdrive, making insulin (which carries glucose to your cells to 
be used for energy) to normalize blood sugar levels. But this rapid release of 
insulin causes a sudden drop in blood sugar. In reaction to the falling blood 
sugar, excess adrenal cortisone is stimulated to raise blood sugar back to 
normal. A constantly high intake of simple dietary sugar keeps this roller 
coaster going and eventually overworks or &quot;burns out&quot; normal pancreas 
and adrenal function leading to early menopause, adult-onset diabetes, 
hypoglycemia, and chronic fatigue.</p> 
<p> The purpose of eating is to provide your body with nutrients. But since 
sugar is devoid of nutrients, the body must actually draw from its nutrient 
reserves to metabolize it. When these storehouses are depleted, the body 
becomes unable to properly metabolize fatty acids and cholesterol, leading to 
higher cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Drawing on the body's nutrient 
reserves can also lead to chronic mineral deficits, especially in magnesium (a 
mineral required for more than 300 different enzyme activities) and chromium (a 
trace element that regulates hormones such as insulin), putting you at risk for 
dozens of diseases, from depression to attention deficit disorder to asthma.</p>
<p> A recent study, for example, found that kids who eat significant amounts 
of junk food are much more likely to develop asthma than kids who don't eat 
junk food. While the researchers didn't tie asthma to sugar itself, they did 
point out that a diet full of candy and other highly processed junk foods is 
deficient in a number of nutrients essential to health. And as I explained 
earlier, such foods further deplete the body of nutrients once consumed.</p> 
<p> In fact, children are the biggest consumers of nutritionally void junk 
food at a time when their brains and bodies are growing rapidly and in need of 
a nutrient-dense diet for proper development, both physically and mentally. 
Criminologist Stephen Schoenthaler has been conducting nutritional studies on 
delinquents and public school children for almost thirty years. In a paper from 
1986 he describes how one million kids improved their test scores when they 
eliminated sugar and white flour from their diets.</p> 
<p> Alexander Schauss, Ph.D., a nutritional researcher and writer, performed 
similar work in juvenile detention centers and showed that violent behavior 
decreased dramatically when sugar was eliminated.</p> 
<p> <strong> But I don't eat junk food. Why should I be concerned about my 
sugar consumption?</strong><br>
 Unless you're eating a diet entirely made of 
whole, unprocessed foods (think fruits, vegetables, grains), you're probably 
eating more sugar than you think, and than you should. Sugar, in its myriad 
forms, is added to virtually every packaged food product you'll find at the 
supermarket - not just the sweet stuff. If you drink one soda, even the 
&quot;natural&quot; variety, used up your day's sugar allowance.)</p> 
<p> Don't be fooled by the ingredients list. Sugar has hundreds of pseudonyms 
(see &quot;Stealth Sugars,&quot; for a sampling), and manufacturers have gotten 
very good at hiding them from consumers. Because ingredients are listed from 
most to least amount, often three different types of sugars will be in the 
middle of the list. If all sugars were required to be listed together, sugar 
would be the first ingredient.</p> 
<p> To find out how much sugar you're actually taking in, try keeping a food 
diary for one week. Check the labels of the foods you eat and make note of 
their sugar content. The reality of the numbers may not hit home because most 
of us don't think in grams - 4.2 g of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of 
sugar. At the end of the week, take the total number of sugar grams and divide 
it by 4.2 to get your weekly sugar intake in teaspoons. Then divide that number 
by 7 to get your daily sugar consumption.</p> 
<p> Unfortunately, the way the FDA's labeling rules are set up, manufacturers 
don't have to separate added sugars from naturally occurring ones on labels. 
But your total sugar intake will give you a very good idea of how much added 
sugar you're eating. Naturally sweet foods, such as fruit, don't really contain 
that much sugar. A cup of strawberries, for example, contains 1/6th the sugar 
of a can of cola.</p> 
<p> <strong> Is there such a thing as a safe amount of sugar?</strong><br>
 
Ideally, you should eliminate all refined sugar from your diet. I'm aware do 
realize that such a feat may not be realistic for everyone, particularly since 
a large number of the foods you find at the grocery store have been made with 
refined sugars (plus the fact that nutrition labels don't have to list the 
amount of added sugars a product contains).</p> 
<p> Many people subscribe to the bizarre logic that if they overindulge in 
sweets and don't wake up the next day with diabetes or some horrible disease 
then it must be okay. Dr. Abraham Hoffer, a psychiatrist in British Columbia 
who has been studying the effects of sugar on health for more than 40 years, 
says that it takes roughly 15- 20 years of steady consumption of refined sugar 
and junk food before an individual develops a chronic illness like diabetes. 
And it doesn't take a lot of sugar to put you at risk. Hoffer's statistics show 
that once intake exceeds 20 teaspoons daily, the risk of chronic disease 
increases exponentially.</p> 
<p> If you can't completely cut sugar from your diet, due to eating out and 
not being in control of ingredients, try not to ingest more than two or three 
teaspoons a day. That way you will stay well below 70 pounds annually (20 
teaspoons daily) which is the cut off point for sugar-induced chronic disease. 
At the level we're eating sugar now (20 teaspoons per person daily), it is only 
a matter of time before we're facing an epidemic of sugar-induced diseases. In 
fact, the epidemics may have already begun - according to the Centers for 
Disease control in Atlanta, the incidence of adult-onset diabetes, has 
increased by 70 percent among people in their 30s in the past 10 years.</p> 
<p> <strong>What does processing do to sugar? </strong><br>
 Processing 
sugarcane, or any whole food, strips it of most if not all of its nutritional 
value. Researchers found that the refining process of sugar removes 93 percent 
of its chromium, 89 percent of its manganese, 98 percent of its cobalt, 83 
percent of its copper, 98 percent of its zinc, and 98 percent of its magnesium. 
Ironically, the end product, the refined sugar, is what we consume, while the 
nutritious residues are discarded and generally fed to cattle.</p> 
<p> In the 1920s, Sir Frederick Banting, the Canadian medical researcher 
scientist, who first discovered insulin, visited Panama to study diabetes among 
workers in the sugar cane fields. He could find almost no incidence of diabetes 
among the workers who ate the whole sugarcane plant daily. But among their 
Spanish employers - who incorporated the refined end product, white sugar, into 
their diets - the disease was rampant.</p> 
<p> <strong>Is fructose healthier than sugar?</strong><br>
 Many people 
mistakenly believe that fructose is a healthier sugar - especially since it is 
used in many so-called &quot;natural&quot; foods. While there is a small amount 
of fructose naturally present in fruit, the fructose that is added to many 
commercially prepared foods is nearly as refined as plain white sugar.</p> 
<p> Most of the fructose you'll encounter is in the form of high-fructose corn 
syrup (HFCS), which has nearly eclipsed sugar as the most consumed sweetener in 
the United States. It is added to thousands of products, from cola to cookies 
and even to canned vegetables. HFCS is a highly refined sweetener that is 
virtually identical, chemically speaking, to refined white sugar; during 
digestion sugar breaks down into equal parts of glucose and fructose; HFCS 
contains 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.</p> 
<p> <strong> Why do I crave sugar?</strong><br>
 You may crave sugary foods 
for many reasons. As I explained earlier, refined sugar stresses the pancreas 
and depletes the body's supplies of chromium. A common symptom of chromium 
deficiency is sugar cravings. And satisfying these cravings further lowers 
chromium and increases cravings. And eating sweets is just plain pleasurable. 
Chocolate, for example, has been found to stimulate the production of 
serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical.</p> 
<p> But the human body is drawn to carbohydrates for reasons other than 
instant gratification. Carbohydrates are necessary for metabolic processes in 
our body. Whole, unrefined carbohydrates like grains break down into sugar when 
chewed. After proper chewing, grains will taste sweet. Grains contain B 
vitamins and magnesium, these nutrients are important co-factors in hundreds of 
metabolic processes in the body. And the sweetness of the foods that contain 
B-vitamins and magnesium may create a conditioned response to these foods. In 
other words, sweetness makes your body think you are getting beneficial 
vitamins and minerals. But when we get empty carbs like sugar with no other 
nutrients&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;the body craves more and more to try to meet its 
nutrient demands.</p> 
<p> So, if your body needs these vitamins and minerals and is attracted to 
carbohydrates to get them, and if instead of a whole grain you eat a refined 
empty product, then you will probably keep craving carbohydrates until you get 
the vitamins and minerals you need. That's why many doctors recommend B-complex 
vitamins and magnesium supplements help to control carbohydrate addiction. Of 
course, eating organic whole grains would be the optimum solution.</p> 
<p> The main reason for our sugar cravings it that we've had a lifetime of 
refined sugar. It's in baby food, snacks and treats at every turn; Madison 
Avenue is able to sell 10 cents worth of junk food for $2.00 because it appeals 
to our sweet tooth. We're hooked and we're not complaining as long as the 
supply holds out. And as Dr. Hoffer says it's a stronger addiction than heroin.
</p> 
<p> Another cause of sugar cravings is a yeast overgrowth, also known as 
candidaisis. Candida is a yeast that is naturally present in the human body. 
But some things, such as antibiotics and too much sugar in the diet, can cause 
the yeast to multiply, leading a number of health problems, from vaginal yeast 
infections to severe fatigue. And these yeast, when present in abnormally high 
numbers, can cause strong cravings for sweet, starchy foods, causing the 
problem to perpetuate. (If you suspect a yeast overgrowth, your doctor can 
perform a saliva or stool test for yeast antibodies.) (Dr. Dean is the medical 
advisor to yeastconnection.com. Visitors to the site can take the Yeast 
Questionnaire to help determine if they have a yeast problem. If so, a 6-Point 
Yeast Fighting Program will help eliminate the sugar and yeast from your life.)
</p> 
<p> <strong>Are natural sweeteners like honey better than white sugar? 
</strong><br>
 Regardless of what kind of sweeteners you eat, they should 
account for no more than 5 percent of your daily calories. Some natural 
sweeteners, such as blackstrap molasses, unprocessed honey, fruit juice, brown 
rice syrup, and evaporated cane juice do contain low levels of nutrients, such 
as the B vitamins, and minerals such as iron, calcium and potassium. But don't 
be fooled, these &quot;natural&quot; sweeteners are only marginally better than 
plain white table sugar and dietary intake of them should be limited.</p> 
<p> What about calorie-free sugar substitutes such as Nutrasweet? Sweet N' 
Low? Don't be fooled into switching from sugar to sugar-free substitutes; 
they're even more unhealthy, especially aspartame (Nutrasweet). If you want to 
add a touch of sweetness without any calories, try stevia*. Stevia is an 
extremely safe herb that is not only an excellent sweetener, but it actually 
lowers blood sugar levels in diabetics by helping to regulate pancreatic 
function. And unlike sugar, which weakens the immune system, stevia has 
antimicrobial properties and actually helps the body fight off colds and flus.
</p> 
<p> Aspartame (Nutrasweet),on the other hand, is a neurotoxin and should be 
avoided like the plague. Aspartame has been shown to cause birth defects, brain 
tumors and seizures and to contribute to diabetes and emotional disorders.</p> 
<p> Aspartame has three components: phenylalanine (50 percent), aspartic acid 
(40 percent) and methanol, also termed wood alcohol (10 percent). Those in 
support of this popular artificial sweetener, state that the two primary amino 
acids, which comprise 90 percent of aspartame by weight, are a harmless and 
natural part of our diet. While phenylalanine and aspartic acid are naturally 
occurring amino acids, our bodies and brains are not equipped to handle such 
high concentrations as found in a diet soda where they disrupt nerve cell 
communication and can cause cell death. The neurotoxic effects of these 
isolated amino acids can be linked to headaches, mental confusion, balance 
problems and seizures.</p> 
<p> Methanol, too, is naturally present in fruits and vegetables but these 
foods also contain ethanol, which neutralizes the methanol. The Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) defines safe consumption of methanol as no more than 
7.8 mg per day of this dangerous substance. Yet a one-liter beverage, sweetened 
with aspartame, contains about 56 milligrams of wood alcohol, or seven times 
the EPA limit. And the absolute irony of the use of aspartame in diet products 
is that it can actually cause weight gain. Phenylalanine and aspartic acid, 
found in aspartame, stimulate the release of insulin. Rapid, strong spikes in 
insulin remove all glucose from the blood stream and store it as fat. This can 
result in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and sugar cravings. Additionally, 
phenylalanine has been demonstrated to inhibit carbohydrate-induced synthesis 
of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which signals that the body is full. This 
can cause you to eat more than your normally would and, ultimately, gain 
weight. In one study a control group switching to an aspartame-free diet 
resulted in an average weight loss of 19 pounds.</p> 
<p> Saccharin is a petroleum-derived sweetener discovered in 1879 and was used 
extensively during the sugar shortages during World Wars I and II. The 
sweetener got a bad reputation in l977 when the FDA proposed restrictions on 
its use saying studies involving male rats given large amounts of saccharin 
developed urinary bladder tumors. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) then 
officially classified saccharin as an &quot;anticipated human carcinogen.&quot; 
But researchers have since been unable to reproduce the results from 1977, and 
saccharin was recently removed from the NTP's list. Saccharin might be the 
lesser of two evils, but it's still a synthetic substance.)</p> 
<p> Many low-carbohydrate foods, like the Atkins Bars, contain sugar alcohols. 
What are they?</p>

<strong>Stealth Sugars</strong><br>

detective work to find the hidden sugars in foods. You probably know the

<p> <strong> WHERE SUGAR RESIDES</strong><br>
 USDA recommends limiting added 
sugars - from packaged foods and the sugar bowl - to 24 grams a day (6 
teaspoons) if you eat 1,600 calories; 40 grams (10 teaspoons) for a 
2,000-calorie diet; 56 grams (14 teaspoons) for a 2,400-calorie diet; and 72 
grams (18 teaspoons) for a 2,800-calorie-diet.</p>
<p> <strong>Food with its' Average Added sugars </strong><br>
</p></li> 
<li>Apple Sauce contains 11 g </li> 
<li>Peanut Butter contains 18g </li> 
<li>Yogurt contains 23g </li> 
<li>Fruit Juice contains 40g 
<p></p>
<p> <strong>Where We Get Our Sugar:</strong> </p>
<p> <strong>Then and Now</strong><br>
 In 1973, the per capita consumption of 
sugar and other highly refined sweeteners (such as high-fructose corn syrup) 
was 126 pounds a year. Today, it's 158 pounds - an increase of 26 percent. 
During the same time period, the percent of overweight Americans increased by 
nearly 20 percent.</p>
<p> <strong>Soda Overload</strong><br>
 A single can of soda contains 12 
teaspoons of added sugars. That's 120 percent of the USDA's recommended daily 
intake of sugar. Researchers have found that just two cans of soda can suppress 
immune function for up to five hours.</p>
<p> </p>  * As a physician, I have found that reducing sugar intake is one of 
the most important ways to control hypoglycemia, diabetes, and intestinal 
yeast. Reduce your sugar intake by supplementing your tea, water, and other 
beverages with Stevia. Please go to<b>www.CarolynDean.com</b> and click on Dean
