<h3>Sugars </h3> <br>
<br>

<h3>The Lesser (Sweet) Evil<br>
By CFYL Staff</h3> 
<p>We can&rsquo;t seem to do without sugar. Even an infant knows the vast 
difference between a drop of sugar and spinach. But pure sugar is rare in 
nature. While it used to be an expensive commodity, these days sugar and it 
vast array of substitutes are cheap. We have become accustomed to consuming a 
lot more than we actually need. Most of it is in the form of refined sugars or 
high-fructose corn syrup that can create a vicious cycle of spikes and troughs 
in the body&rsquo;s blood glucose levels.&nbsp; This can lead to 
hyperactivity.&nbsp; Excess sweeteners have also been linked to other medical 
problems, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.</p> 
<p>At CFYL, we recommend using all sugars sparingly, whether refined white or 
organic brown. The more minimally refined varieties of sugar are a slightly 
lesser evil. Turbinado and raw sugars are the extracted, evaporated, and 
crystalized juice of the sugar cane plant&mdash;a natural and thereby slightly 
less naughty source of sweetness. White sugar is so refined that it&rsquo;s 
100% sucrose, lacking the trace nutrients that less refined sugars still have. 
You can also use honey, maple syrup, molasses, or agave, to sweeten food and 
treats, all of which have trace vitamins and minerals.</p> 
<p>Even when we try to use sugar in moderation, it&rsquo;s easy for it to slip 
into our diets unnoticed. Sugar and other sweeteners have an overwhelming 
presence in all kinds of packaged foods from cookies to frozen peas and 
ketchup. In many products, sugar has been replaced by highly processed 
high-fructose corn syrup, which is twice as sweet as sugar and can be difficult 
for the body to break down. We recommend always reading food labels and 
ingredient lists to determine how much hidden sugar may be in your food, and 
what the source of the sweetness really is.</p> 
<p>So what about all those zero calorie artificial sweeteners? According to 
the American Cancer Society and The National Cancer Institute, there is no 
conclusive evidence that common sweeteners on the market today including 
aspartame (Equal), sucralose (Splenda), saccharin, and acesulfame potassium 
cause cancer, but they may have other negative effects. When your tongue tastes 
something sweet, it sends a signal to your brain, alerting it of a carbohydrate 
load coming its way. When these carbs never show up, our bodies may just be 
left wanting more. Not a good reaction for those of us watching our waistline 
and heart health. So what&rsquo;s CFYL&rsquo;s advice? Use&nbsp;the real thing; 
just limit your use, and cut down on sugary treats. If you&rsquo;re diabetic, 
artificial sweeteners might be the way to go, but talk to your registered 
dietician&nbsp;about your options.People have been eating natural forms of 
sugar since time immemorial. Artificial sweeteners are only a recent 
development, and we have no way of knowing what kinds of long-term effects they 
have on our bodies.</p>

<h3>Ann's Tips</h3> 
<p> Buy organic brown cane sugar, such as Florida Crystals, or turbinado sugar 
for daily use instead of the more refined white sugars. However, sugar is 
sugar; use it in small quantities. Bear in mind that for optimum health, all 
sugary sweets and desserts should be an occasional treat and not an everyday 
habit.</p> 
<h3>Recipe Tips</h3> 
<p> Always go easy with sugar when you cook. Cut down on it wherever you can, 
especially when you make desserts or bake cookies and cakes. For starters, try 
making tarts and pies with unsweetened crusts, as in our<strong>Apple Pie
</strong>. The savory short-crust pastry deliciously enhances the natural 
sweetness of the apples. Many traditional cake recipes don&rsquo;t need all the 
sugar they call for to come out well. In our rich<strong>Marble Pound Cake
</strong>, for instance, you&rsquo;ll find a little goes a long way.</p>
