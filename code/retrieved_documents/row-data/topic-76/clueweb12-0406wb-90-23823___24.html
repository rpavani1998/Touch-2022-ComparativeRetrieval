<h2>Sugar Substitutes: White Poison In The Pink &amp; Blue Packets</h2> 
<p>By: Mark J. Occhipinti, M.S., Ph.D., N.D.c</p> 
<p>Many individuals, in an attempt to avoid sugar, use sugar substitutes. 
Aspartame a chemical compound found in products such as NutraSweet&reg; and 
Equal&reg;, are in over 3,000 foods, including Crystal Lite&reg;, diet soda, 
diet foods, and other drinks that are consumed heavily in the fitness industry.
</p> 
<p>Just about any food that once had sugar as an ingredient now can have 
aspartame instead. Aspartame is a combination of three substances: the amino 
acid phenylalanine, Aspartic acid (man made) and methanol (wood alcohol). Each 
of these ingredients have a long history of causing serious physical side 
effects. Phenylalanine, for example, lowers or blocks production of the 
neurotransmitter serotonin, which sends messages from the pineal gland in the 
brain.</p> 
<p>This blockage has been linked a one cause of carbohydrate cravings, PMS 
symptoms, insomnia, mood swings, and migraine headaches. Aspartame removes the 
essential mineral chromium from the body, which is necessary in regulating the 
clearance of glucose from the blood while assisting insulin&rsquo; s capability 
for glucose regulation. Sudden weight gains, water retention and flu like 
symptoms have been observed in fitness people, especially in aerobic 
instructors. A classic example was an article in the Sept. 1991 issue of Idea 
Today. Aerobic instructors and other fitness participants that consume diet 
beverages after exercise are at risk for absorbing high levels of methanol.</p> 
<p>Drinking between 1-3 12 ounce cans or glasses of diet beverage that 
contains aspartame on a hot day after exercise can expose you to 8 times the 
Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s recommended safe limit for methanol. It 
has been found that methanol (free-form wood alcohol) can race through the 
system of a highly fit individual due to their high metabolic rate. Aspartame 
is not the answer to the high sugar consumption in &lsquo;America today.</p> 
<p>Actually the increased intake of aspartame over the past twenty-five years 
since it&rsquo;s FDA approval are correlated with higher intake of sugar (over 
150 pounds per year) and associated states of degenerative diseases that rack 
our country. Aspartame ranks number one for over a decade with complaints 
received by the FDA, representing over 85 percent of all complaints received 
yearly. There are over 73 symptoms associated directly to the use of aspartame, 
including dizziness, headaches, loss of equilibrium, ear problems, hemorrhaging 
of the eyes, and visual impairment. The dangers associated with aspartame are 
so widespread, that a report by 60 Minutes and Hard Copy in February 1997 
illustrated the dangers and how the drug company who manufactures aspartame 
lied in the Senate Subcommittee Hearings both initially in 1973 and again in 
1991.</p> 
<p>There is an excellent source of research information on aspartame: 
Aspartame Consumer Safety Network (ACSN) in Dallas, TX. (214) 352-4268.</p> 
<p>Three Senate hearings have been conducted on the safety of aspartame, and 
the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) in Washington, D.C. now 
list aspartame as the third-worst food additive of all time. Authors Jean 
Carper and Ann Louise Gittleman state we have no idea how much we are actually 
consuming during the course of one day if diet foods and diet drinks are being 
consumed. There is no safe level of Aspartame since it was originally 
classified by the Department of Defense as a neuro-excitatory toxin, and it is 
a cumulative effect in the body. Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that the 
consumption of Aspartame has correlated with the increase in Alzheimer&rsquo;s 
disease and other neurological diseases during the past twenty-five years?</p>

<p>Brief History of Aspartame</p> 
<p>1969 - Dr. Harry Waisman fed ASP mixed with milk to monkeys. One died after 
300 days of (Aspartame) from here on referred to as &ldquo;ASP&rdquo;, and five 
others had grand mal seizures. Searle deleted this negative study when the 
company submitted safety evidence to the FDA.</p> 
<p>1970 - The FDA banned cyclamate during the time that the safety of 
saccharin was being questioned. The time seemed ripe for ASP.</p> 
<p>1971 - Dr. John Olney, a research psychiatrist, told Searle that Aspartic 
acid caused &ldquo;holes in the brains of mice.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>1974 - Searle people said these studies raised &ldquo;no health 
problems.&rdquo; Searle told the FDA about these findings after approval was 
granted.</p> 
<p>1975 - Many of the test animals fed ASP developed large TUMORS. These were 
NOT reported to the FDA.</p> 
<p>1977 - Despite the many complaints about ASP, William Conlon and Thomas 
Sullivan, the US attorneys, took no action, in five years the statute of 
limitations for a grand jury investigation expired. A year later Conlon took a 
position with the law firm that represents Searle. (U.S. Attorney, Samuel 
Skinner did the same and ended up Chief of Staff in Bush&rsquo;s White House. 
ed.)</p> 
<p>1980 - A Public Board of Inquiry of three scientists was activated. These 
(2 MDs and one Ph.D.) voted to ban ASP. Because of those negative findings a 
five member Commissioner&rsquo;s Team of Scientists was impaneled: Three said 
ban; two said it was safe. Another member was added. You guessed it: deadlock. 
Dr. Jacqueline Verrett, Ph.D., toxicologist on the team said, &ldquo;Bureau 
officials were working up to a whitewash. Safety questions remain 
unanswered.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>1981 - Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes, Jr. was appointed the new FDA Commissioner 
and overruled the Public Board of Inquiry&rsquo;s recommended ban of ASP. He 
said his approval was part of the Reagan administration&rsquo;s new reform! 
Throughout the 1980&rsquo;s Searle has pointed out that the best evidence of 
ASP&rsquo;s safety was the fact that it had been approved in more than 60 
countries. But these foreign approvals had been based on these controversial 
test, and the questionable approval of the FDA. It was approved as a 
&ldquo;food additive,&rdquo; and hence, exempt from continued safety 
monitoring. (Searle is not obligated to monitor any adverse reactions.)</p> 
<p>1983 - THE NATIONAL SOFT DRINK ASSOCIATION wrote to the FDA that ASP was 
breaking down in warm climates. But the Association later accepted ASP. Dr. 
Hayes office approved the use of ASP in soft drinks just two months before he 
quit his job as FDA chief. He then obtained a job with a public relations firm 
who represents NutraSweet.</p> 
<p>1984 - Seven million pounds of NutraSweet are swallowed by about 100,000 
people.</p> 
<p>1985 - Reports of side-effects mount.</p> 
<p>1987 - ACSN is founded by Mary Nash Stoddard and consumer advocate, James 
Turner. They believe ASP should be recalled and retested as a drug.</p> 
<p>Increasing Brain Tumor Rates: Is There a Link to Aspartame</p> 
<p>Dr. Erik Millstone, MD<br>
 Science Policy Research Unit Mantell Building
<br> University of Sussex Brighton<br>
 BN1 9RF England October 1996</p> 
<p>The artificial sweetener aspartame is said by some commentators to be the 
most fully tested and safest food additive in industrial history. Because it is 
a dipeptide of two familiar and essential amino acids, namely Aspartic acid and 
phenylalanine, there are prima facie reasons for thinking that it should be 
safe. It is, moreover, one of the most successful synthetic chemicals every 
produced.</p> 
<p>The dominant producer is the Nutrasweet Corporation (a subsidiary of 
Monsanto), and a recently published estimate suggested that world sales 
amounted to approximately $1,000 million in 1995.(1) Doubts about the safety of 
this compound have, however, surfaced repeatedly during its turbulent history, 
and a particularly serious set of fresh doubts have recently emerged in a paper 
in the journal Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology, focusing on the 
possibility that aspartame might be contributing to the increasing incidence of 
brain cancer.(2)</p> 
<p>Prof. John Olney of Washington University St. Louis and his colleagues have 
based their hypothesis on several sets of considerations. Firstly, they 
analyzed the cancer statistics gathered by the US National Cancer Institute 
from catchment areas representing approximately 10% of the US population for 
the period since 1975. They found that the introduction of aspartame into the 
USA, into dry goods in 1981 and soft drinks in 1983, was followed by an abrupt 
increase (of approximately 10%) in the reported incidence of brain tumors. The 
change was most noticeable between 1984 and 1985, and it corresponded to 
approximately 1,500 extra cases of brain cancer per year in the USA.</p> 
<p>Their second main finding is that there has also been a marked change in 
the incidence of particular types of brain tumors, with a reduction in the 
proportion of a relatively unaggressive (and often preliminary) type of tumor 
(astrocytomas) and a sharp increase in the incidence of a far more aggressive 
(and all too often terminal) type of tumor (glioblastomas). The investigators 
argue, moreover, that the reported changes in tumor incidence were unlikely to 
have been artifacts of improvements in diagnostic technologies.</p> 
<p>The introduction and rapid diffusion of computerized tomography in the 
early to mid- 1970s, and of magnetic resonance imaging technology in the early 
to mid-1980s, certainly improved diagnostic precision. But they contend that 
the impact of those innovations upon the reported incidence of these central 
nervous system (CNS) tumors had fully worked their way through before aspartame 
was introduced.</p> 
<p>Before these imaging technologies were introduced, it was far harder to 
diagnose brain cancer. Consequently, it was often not until tumors developed 
into glioblastomas that they were diagnosed, and a relatively high portion of 
tumors at the earlier astrocytoma stage went undetected. When the imaging 
technologies were introduced, brain tumors tended to be detected at the earlier 
stage, and consequently in the late 1970s the number of reported astrocytomas 
went up, while the number of glioblastomas exhibited a corresponding decline.
</p> 
<p>After aspartame was introduced, however, the opposite pattern can be found. 
The incidence of glioblastomas rose sharply, and starting in the late 1980s the 
number of astrocytomas declined even more sharply. Since those latter changes 
run counter to the direction which could be attributed to the introduction of 
better diagnostic technologies, it is hard to see how the reported changing 
tumor incidence could be ascribed to innovations in diagnosis. If the apparent 
increase in overall incidence had been due to improved diagnostics, then we 
should expect a marked change in post- diagnostic survival rates, but no such 
change was evident.</p> 
<p>Olney and his colleagues suspect aspartame to be implicated in the etiology 
of the extra cases of brain cancer for three main reasons. Firstly, the type of 
CNS tumor found to be increasing most rapidly in the USA is the same kind of 
lesion as was found in one of the animal studies conducted on aspartame in the 
1970s.(3) Indeed, when the safety of aspartame was considered by a Public Board 
of Inquiry in 1980, it recommended against the approval of aspartame primarily 
because of a concern that aspartame appeared to be a brain carcinogen in 
rodents. A team of scientists at the US Food and Drug Administration concurred 
with the judgment of the Board, and they too recommended that further studies 
be conducted to clarify the issue before aspartame could be considered 
acceptably safe for use. Both the Public Board of Inquiry and the FDA staff 
scientists were, however, over-ruled by the incoming FDA Commissioner, Arthur 
Hull Hayes, who asserted that the brain cancer risk was minimal and that 
further research was not necessary.</p> 
<p>Olney and his colleagues have also drawn attention to the results of a 
study by Shephard et al published in 1993.(4) Shephard and her colleagues 
attempted to simulate in vitro the conditions that can occur in the human 
digestive tract, and in particular the conditions which result in the 
nitrosation of dietary ingredients. They reported that the nitrosated aspartame 
had significant mutagenic action. That evidence may be important because it 
suggests not only a mechanism through which aspartame could exert a possible 
carcinogenic action, but also why the interval between the compound&rsquo;s 
introduction and the elevation of brain cancer rates appears to have been so 
brief.</p> 
<p>Olney et al also suggest that aspartame may reasonably be suspected of 
responsibility because the other main candidates for responsibility, such as 
ionizing radiation, smoke inhalation, pesticides, electromagnetic fields and 
various other chemicals were gradually introduced over recent decades rather 
than all at once in the early 1980s. Exposures to those potential hazards are, 
furthermore, occupational linked and it is hard to see how they could explain 
why males and females seem to be equally affected.</p> 
<p>If Olney&rsquo;s hypothesis is to be substantiated it will be necessary to 
analyze several long-term brain cancer time- series data sets for other 
countries covering the period both before and since aspartame was introduced. 
That has proved difficult because while aggregate brain cancer statistics are 
readily available, information on tumors types is hard to obtain. If aspartame 
were to act by modifying an already present or nascent brain cancer, we should 
expect its impact to vary in different countries in ways which depend on the 
age structure of the consumers of this sweetener. Anecdotal evidence suggests 
that a larger proportion of 50 to 70 year old Americans consume 
aspartame-sweetened products than is the case in the UK or in other European 
countries. An alternative approach might therefore entail conducting new 
long-term animal feeding studies, but their relevance to humans is endlessly 
contestable.</p> 
<p>While Olney and his colleagues have raised complex questions about the 
safety of aspartame, other questions have previously been raised without having 
been fully answered. The manner in which no fewer than 15 of the initial safety 
tests were conducted and reported during the 1970s has been repeatedly 
criticized. An FDA task force showed, for example, that in one particular study 
it was impossible to identify the occasion on which a particular animals had 
died. As the report says: &ldquo;Observation records indicated that animal 
A23LM was alive at week 88, dead from week 92 through week 104, alive at week 
108, and dead at week 112.&rdquo;(5)</p> 
<p>That represented just one of 52 significant shortcomings in the conduct and 
reporting of just one of those 15 studies. Those studies have, moreover, never 
been repeated. Several commentators have therefore argued that unless and until 
those 15 pivotal studies are repeated, no-one can be in a position confidently 
to assert that aspartame is safe. In the mid-to-late 1980s, a series of reports 
started to emerge suggesting that aspartame is capable of acute adverse 
reactions in a small proportion of sensitive consumers. The symptoms reported 
include headaches and blurred vision at the most mild through to epileptic-type 
seizures at the most severe. The accumulation of evidence, concerning both 
acute and chronic hazards, now poses a substantial problem for both regulatory 
officials and for the general public.</p> 
<p>The challenge for policy-makers, as ever, is to decide how much evidence is 
sufficient to support a judgment that something is either sufficiently safe or 
that it poses a significant hazard. A decision of that sort, in relation to an 
artificial sweetener, will depend on a judgment about the balance of benefits 
and risks. It is, however, quite hard to demonstrate that artificial sweeteners 
are beneficial to any group other than diabetics. The period since the early 
1980s has seen a rapid rise in the consumption of artificial sweeteners, but 
there has been no corresponding decline in the consumption of sugar, either in 
the USA, the UK or in the European Union as a whole. That implies that, in 
aggregate, artificial sweeteners are not acting as sugar substitutes but merely 
as supplements to sugar consumption.</p> 
<p>Many of the products containing artificial sweeteners are labeled as 
&lsquo;diet&rsquo; products implying that consuming artificially sweetened 
products helps people to control or even to reduce their weight. There is 
however no reliable evidence to indicate that artificial sweeteners actually 
help people loose weight. On the contrary, the bulk of the available evidence 
suggests that in relation to attempted weight loss, artificial sweeteners are 
at best ineffective and at worst counter-productive.</p> 
<p>There is, in particular, evidence that artificial sweeteners are appetite 
stimulants, and while a particular mouthful of artificially sweetened food or 
drink may contain fewer calories than their sugar-sweetened analogues, the 
consumption of artificial sweeteners may provoke people into going on, what 
might be termed, &lsquo;a calorie hunt&rsquo;. If the likely benefits and risks 
of aspartame are to be properly explored, and if consumers are to be properly 
informed and protected, these complex issues need to be explored in a 
comprehensive and open fashion, and not behind closed doors, be they in 
Whitehall, in the European Commission in Brussels or at the World Health 
Organization&rsquo;s office in Geneva. The public are entitled to be sure, in 
particular, that none of the experts advising the authorities are acting as 
paid consultants to the companies which either manufacture or utilize 
artificial sweeteners. Neither the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 
nor the Department of Health, nor the European Commission nor even the WHO can 
provide such an assurance.</p>
