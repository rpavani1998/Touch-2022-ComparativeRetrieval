<b>This week - Saved from surgery by the IBS 
diet!</b> <br>
<br>
 Hello to everyone - <br>
<br>
 This week I'm on holiday, 
so we have a special re-edition of one of our most popular end-of-summer issues 
ever! We'll cool down with a delicious mango sorbet that will make you swoon. 
It is in fact a very virtuous dessert but it certainly tastes sinful. There's 
an added bonus here - mangoes are one of the single most nutritious foods you 
can eat, which means this recipe is not only safe but downright healthy.<br>

<br> If you've long suspected that diet plays a critical and common role in 
IBS, but have been told that &quot;diet doesn't matter&quot; or &quot;everyone 
with IBS is different&quot;, you will feel mighty vindicated by our featured 
study on IBS patients' reactions to foods. (Red meat is a problem? Why am I<em>
not</em> surprised?!) <br>
<br>
 We also have an <b>amazing reader letter</b> 
from a woman who was saved from surgery by the IBS diet. Enjoy!<br>
<br>
 Best 
Wishes,<br>

<b>Fennel &amp; Peppermint Tummy Teas - Now in New Jumbo Teabags!</b>
<br><br>
<b><em>Fennel is terrific for bloating &amp; gas, Peppermint is great 
for IBS pain &amp; spasms.</em></b> </p> <b>Saved from Surgery by the IBS Diet
</b><br>
<br>
 Dear Heather, <br>
<br>
 I can't thank you enough for your book, 
<b>Eating for IBS</b>. This book gave me hope and saved me from surgery. I was 
in so much pain and was ready to throw in the towel. I have stopped the TRIGGER 
foods that were triggering my attacks. What a relief.<br>
<br>
I have followed 
all your advice, you are an angel. I must thank my husband, he is the one who 
searched the net for information to get help for me. I love all your recipes. 
It's been a month that I have been on a new way to live and it's working like a 
miracle.<br>
<br>
 Thank You and God Bless,<br>
<br>

<em>Thank you so much, Valerie! ~ Heather</em> <br>

Addresses multiple IBS symptoms * 
Teaches substitution, never deprivation</b> </p> <b>IBS Sufferers 
Hypersensitive to Common Foods</b><br>
 Research indicates sufferers of 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be hypersensitive to antigens contained in 
beef, pork, lamb, and wheat, according to a study in the July issue of the<em>
American Journal of Gastroenterology</em>. <br>
<br>
 British researchers 
studied the effects of 16 common foods in 108 IBS patients (52 
diarrhea-predominant; 32 constipation-predominant; 24 alternating) and 43 
controls using IgG4 and IgE titers and skin prick testing (SPT). Data results 
and patients' IBS symptoms were correlated. Researchers found IBS patients had 
significantly higher IgG4 titers to beef, pork, lamb, and wheat compared to 
controls. These differences were maintained across all three subgroups. 
Antibody titers to potatoes, rice, fish, chicken, yeast, tomato and shrimps 
were not significantly different and no significant difference in IgE titers 
was observed between IBS and controls. No correlation was seen between the 
pattern of elevated IgG4 antibody titers and patients' symptoms, such as pain 
bloating and stool frequency.<br>
<br>
 Researchers concluded serum elevated 
IgG4 antibodies to wheat, beef, pork and lamb may be the result of 
physiological damage caused by IBS. &quot;The response to exclusion diet based 
on elevated food-specific IgG4 in future studies may be useful in establishing 
the significance of these findings,&quot; wrote the study authors. Go here for 
more information about this study... <br>

<b>Gastrointestinal Infections Can Have 
Lasting Consequences as IBS</b><br>
 Canadian outbreaks of two different 
gastrointestinal infections show the illnesses come with long-term health 
problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS puzzles doctors because 
medical tests usually don't show any abnormalities in the intestine, despite 
the presence of abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating. The two 
incidents -- the water-borne bacterial outbreak in Walkerton, Ont., in May 2000 
and a food-borne viral outbreak at a scientific meeting in Newfoundland -- are 
providing researchers with an unprecedented look at what happens once the 
infections pass.<br>
<br>
 The circumstances surrounding the Walkerton outbreak 
are well-known. Municipal water contaminated with E. coli bacteria killed seven 
local residents and made thousands of others sick. Some of them are still sick, 
according to Marshall's report. He and his colleagues studied more than 2,000 
Walkerton residents two to three years after the outbreak. One-third of those 
who got sick during the outbreak still had symptoms of IBS, including 
persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain. Just 10 per cent of people who did not 
get sick were found to have IBS.<br>
<br>
 The results lend a new note of 
credibility to the continuing health woes of Walkerton residents, Marshall 
says. &quot;We need to bring legitimacy to this sort of complaint, because a 
lot of people -- certainly in Walkerton -- who've had irritable bowel syndrome 
find themselves a bit dismissed by the medical system because they don't have 
any identifiable abnormality.&quot; Go here for more information about this

<b>Lack of Lasting Effectiveness of Miralax for Constipation 
</b><br>
 MiraLax has been shown to be safe and effective in a 14-day trial for 
constipation. This present investigation was designed to extend the treatment 
and safety experience with Miralax and to evaluate any lasting effectiveness 
during a 30-day post-treatment observation period.<br>
<br>
 Methods: Study 
subjects met Rome II criteria for constipation and reported 3 bowel movements a 
week. They were treated with Miralax daily for 14 days. Treatment efficacy was 
defined by resolution of constipation symptoms as determined by the Rome II and 
stool frequency definitions during the treatment period. Thirty days after 
active treatment, 29 of 47 (61.7%) responded that they needed laxative 
treatment. Conclusion: Miralax relieved constipation in most treated study 
subjects, but during a 30-day post-treatment observation period, 61.7% had 
additional constipation treatment interventions. Go here for more information

For the Dietary Management of Abdominal 
Pain &amp;, Bloating<br>
<br>
<b>Peppermint Oil Caps with Fennel and Ginger Are 
Amazing!</b><br>
<br>
<b>Because our Peppermint Oil Caps have the added 
benefits of fennel and ginger oils, they are truly unbeatable for<em>preventing
</em> abdominal pain, gas, and bloating!</b> </p> <b>Splenda and IBS?</b> <br>

<b><em>&quot;I'm trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet, and I'd like 
to use artificial sweeteners instead. I've heard Splenda is a 
&quot;natural&quot; alternative to real sugar. Is this true? Is it safe for 
IBS?&quot;</em></b> <br>
<br>
 Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 
&quot;natural&quot; artificial sweetener, and there is no such thing as an 
artificial sweetener that is proven safe for IBS. Virtually all artificial 
sweeteners (as well as other chemical additives and preservatives) can provoke 
gastrointestinal upsets in people with IBS, as by definition we have more 
sensitive guts.<br>
<br>
Saccharine, Equal and Nutrasweet (both aspartame), 
sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (xylitol, malitol), and Splenda (sucralose) 
are the most popular artificial sweeteners in the US. They can all cause 
digestive side effects ranging from gas and bloating to severe abdominal cramps 
and urgent diarrhea. In some cases, they can provoke these symptoms in people 
who don't even have IBS, so imagine what they can do to you.<br>
<br>
 Sorbitol 
(and other sweeteners ending in &quot;ol&quot;) are sugar alcohols, chemically 
extracted from fruits and vegetables but very poorly absorbed by the gut. It's 
this malabsorption that results in the low calorie count of sugar alcohols, but 
also in the dramatic digestive upheavals they can cause. Sugar alcohols are so 
likely to cause gas, cramping, and bowel dsyfunction that foods containing 
these sweeteners are often labeled with a warning about their side effects, and 
cautions against eating a large amount. Personally, I would caution you against 
eating<em>any</em> amount of a sweetener that's virtually guaranteed to wreak 
havoc on your gut.<br>
<br>
 Splenda is the newest artificial sweetener on the 
market, and it's misleadingly marketed as &quot;natural&quot; because it's 
engineered from real sugar. In fact, the deceptive &quot;natural&quot; label 
has resulted in nine consumer class-action suits in several states and three 
federal commission complaints, and is also being being disputed by the American 
Sugar Association, which is suing Splenda's manufacturer. Splenda is a 
laboratory engineered altered molecule of sugar that replaces three 
hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms. Yum! 
Splenda is not recognized by the body as a food substance, and it passes 
through the gut without being digested. I'd say this is about as far from a 
&quot;real&quot; food as you can get, and there is nothing remotely natural 
about it.<br>
<br>
 Saccharine has had carcinogenic warnings about its use for 
years, and aspartame has generated thousands of consumer complaints to the FDA 
about side effects from its use. Aspartame must also carry a warning label for 
people who do not effectively metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine, one of 
aspartame's components. There aren't any clear cut long-term studies on 
saccharine's or aspartame's effects on gastrointestinal health, but there is a 
lot of anecdotal evidence that they can cause digestive upsets, particularly if 
you're already susceptible to these problems.<br>
<br>
 In general, anyone with 
IBS has a lot to lose and nothing to gain by using artificial sweeteners in 
even small amounts. The risks range from possible to guaranteed cramps, 
bloating, and diarrhea, and as everyone with IBS knows, once you provoke 
symptoms it is much more difficult to regain stability. If you're craving 
something sweet, you're better off savoring a small portion of a treat made 
with real sugar. Sugar is not a health food, and if you want to indulge it 
should certainly be eaten in moderation. For IBS, however, sugar is a much 
safer option than any artificial sweetener.<br>
