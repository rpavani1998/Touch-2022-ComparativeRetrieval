<p><strong>Sugar Substitutes &acirc;&#128;&#148; Useful Ingredients in 
Effective Diabetes Management</strong><br>
<strong>By Christin L. Seher, MS, 
RD, LD</strong><br>
<strong><em>Today&rsquo;s Dietitian</em></strong><br>

<strong>Vol. 12 No. 11 P. 12</strong></p> 
<p>It is a sentiment commonly overheard in conversations with patients newly 
diagnosed with diabetes mellitus: &ldquo;I have to give up cake, give up 
sweets, give up (fill-in-the-blank with favorite food). What the heck am I 
going to eat?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Well, good news: Unlike in years past, when healthcare professionals 
recommended that patients with diabetes eliminate foods with sugars from their 
diet, today&rsquo;s clinical management guidelines include some wiggle room 
when it comes to allowing for our patients&rsquo; favorite sweet treats. These 
foods are no longer the ubiquitous &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; and can be 
successfully incorporated into a diabetes management plan when consumed in 
moderation and included wisely.</p> 
<p><strong>Sweet Options</strong><br>
 Foods are most commonly sweetened with 
natural sources of sugar. Effective diabetes management includes accounting for 
such sugars, whether found organically in foods or added by choice. These 
natural sugars include table sugar (sucrose), fructose, honey, brown sugar, 
molasses, maple syrup, and agave nectar and are considered nutritive 
sweeteners, supplying 4 kcal per gram to the diet. Sugars of this type are also 
metabolically active, raising blood glucose upon consumption and making prudent 
intake crucial for successful diabetes management.</p> 
<p>In the United States, recommendations to consumers via the Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans, MyPyramid, and the Dietary Reference Intakes suggest 
individuals who elect to consume natural sources of sugar that contribute 
energy to the diet maintain their intake at roughly 10% to 25% of total daily 
kilocalories for optimal health.1 Cautions to minimize added sugars allow for 
total calories to remain within recommended ranges, contributing to weight 
management and glycemic control efforts and allowing dietary quality to remain 
relatively high.</p> 
<p>It is important to note that the glycemic response to sugar does not differ 
from that of other carbohydrates (eg, starches) when it comes to diabetes 
management. While sugars may elicit a quicker metabolic response, it is total 
carbohydrate intake that is the predominant factor in blood glucose management, 
of which sugar intake is only one component.</p> 
<p>Over the past 15 years, there has been an increase in artificial products 
designed to help consumers avoid the calories and metabolic effects of 
nutritive sugars, thus making them useful tools for diabetes management. These 
nonnutritive sweeteners (also known as sugar substitutes) can help individuals 
with diabetes manage their blood glucose more easily while allowing them to 
consume many of their favorite foods.</p> 
<p>Sugar substitutes can be roughly broken down into two categories: 
artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols. Artificial sweeteners include 
aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, and neotame. These 
products contribute no calories to the diet, pack high-intensity sweetness in a 
small amount of product, and elicit a negligible glycemic response, making them 
attractive to those with diabetes.</p> 
<p>A new type of sweetener recently introduced to the market is derived from 
the stevia leaf, a plant native to Central and South America. One compound 
isolated from the stevia plant (Reb A) is calorie free (allowing it to be used 
like a sugar substitute) and 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar, and it 
received Generally Recognized as Safe status from the FDA in 2008.2 However, it 
differs from artificial sweeteners in that claims can be made that it is from a 
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; plant source. These properties make sweeteners derived 
from Reb A an attractive alternative to nutritive sweeteners for those with 
diabetes; studies indicate that sweeteners derived from Reb A are just as 
effective as other artificial sweeteners. A panel of experts from the World 
Health Organization recommends intake of 0 to 4 mg/kg of body weight as a safe 
daily intake.</p> 
<p>Sugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol) are reduced-calorie 
sweeteners that still provide calories (approximately 2 kcal/g) yet are less 
energy dense than natural sources of sugar due to their incomplete metabolism. 
They are not without side effects, though; because sugar alcohols are not 
completely digested and absorbed, they can lead to gastrointestinal distress 
for some individuals. For many consumers, however, sugar alcohols are 
acceptable substitutes for the real thing.</p> 
<p><strong>But Are Sugar Substitutes Safe?</strong><br>
 According to the 
American Dietetic Association&rsquo;s (ADA) position statement on the use of 
nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners, there are several benefits to using 
sugar substitutes. Aside from minimizing the metabolic effects to blood glucose 
levels that occur with the consumption of nutritive sugars, sugar substitutes 
can be extremely useful for weight management efforts, which in turn can help 
keep blood glucose levels in check. Particularly appealing is sugar 
substitutes&rsquo; ability to add palatability to some low-calorie foods 
without substantially increasing caloric content.</p> 
<p>Despite their benefits, many consumers are hesitant about incorporating 
sugar substitutes into their diet based on early scientific data suggesting a 
possible link to cancer. (This was an issue specifically with aspartame.) 
According to the National Cancer Institute, there are currently no substantial 
data linking the consumption of moderate quantities of FDA-approved artificial 
sweeteners (amounts that fall within the Acceptable Daily Intake levels set by 
the Dietary Reference Intakes) to cancer in human epidemiological studies 
conducted thus far.</p> 
<p>Some research, however, indicates that individual tolerance for these 
products can vary, with some individuals reporting negative side effects (eg, 
headaches) with consumption. As with all foods, personal tolerance should be a 
consideration when deciding whether to incorporate these products into the 
diet. Dietitians seeking further discussion on the safety of sugar substitutes 
that is applicable to dietetics practice can refer to the ADA&rsquo;s position 
statement.1</p> 
<p>Additionally, the American Diabetes Association cautions that using sugar 
substitutes comes with a few additional concerns, including an often higher 
price tag for prepared products, a higher fat content for palatability, 
significant amounts of carbohydrates remaining in the product despite 
advertised claims, and potential gastrointestinal side effects (especially with 
sugar alcohols). For these reasons, some individuals with diabetes choose to 
consume foods without sugar substitutes; for those with this preference, the 
ADA recommends these foods be consumed in small quantities and balanced with 
other carbohydrate intake.</p> 
<p><strong>Practice Tips for RDs </strong><br>
 The ADA encourages dietitians 
to dialogue with the public about the uses of both nutritive and nonnutritive 
sweeteners using science-based evidence and keeping in mind total diet quality 
rather than individual foods or food products.1</p> 
<p>According to Tammy Randall, MS, RD, LD, CDE, director of education at the 
Diabetes Association of Greater Cleveland and current Ohio Dietetic Association 
president, one of the best ways RDs can help clients with diabetes successfully 
incorporate sugar substitutes into their diet is by educating them on how to 
accurately evaluate the foods they consume and not make choices based on 
manufacturer packaging. &ldquo;It is vital to teach patients how to use the 
Nutrition Facts label,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If they just read the big print 
on the front of the package, they often make misinformed decisions about what 
foods to purchase.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>For example, &ldquo;Sugar alcohols, although often used in 
&acirc;&#128;&#152;sugar-free&rsquo; products, are not calorie and carbohydrate 
free, so patients should read the Nutrition Facts labels carefully,&rdquo; says 
Randall, and pay attention to the total carbohydrate content of a food product 
to achieve optimal blood glucose management.</p> 
<p>By helping their clients determine whether or not these products are in 
line with their disease management goals and personal preferences, RDs can 
assist those with diabetes in achieving better glycemic control without placing 
undue restrictions on the types of foods consumed.</p>
