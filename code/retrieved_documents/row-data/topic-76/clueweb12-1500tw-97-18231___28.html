And&hellip;.) </h2>

<h6>by  Erika Nicole Kendall </h6> 
<p>The interesting thing about reading the responses to The Case Against Soft 
Drinks, was the number of people who admitted &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t drink 
that mess&hellip; I drink diet soda!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And just then, the record (or CD &hellip;or MP3) skipped.</p> 
<p>I get it. People who believe that the primary concern is calories&hellip; 
will drink a diet pop because the calorie count is low. (In fact, in some 
cases, it&rsquo;s literally zero calories.) But clean eaters know better. Clean 
eaters know a few things about this mentality:</p> 
<p>First, if you&rsquo;re going to enjoy a zero calorie drink, it had better 
be water.</p> 
<p>Secondly, a drink that has color and sweet sugary taste, but zero calories? 
That&rsquo;s a highly processed product. No bueno.</p> 
<p>Next, if it has no vitamins or minerals in it, it&rsquo;s not worth my time 
ingesting it. Getting the most bang for our nutritional buck, here.</p> 
<p>Lastly, if it has high fruc&ndash;</p> 
<p><em>Uh, not so fast, Erika! Diet soft drinks don&rsquo;t have high fructose 
corn syrup in them!</em></p> 
<p>No, you&rsquo;re absolutely right. It doesn&rsquo;t have HFCS in it. It has 
<em>aspartame</em> in it. Ooooh, that&rsquo;s so much better.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not even going to go in on this. Someone already did:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;When aspartame was put before the FDA for approval, it was denied 
eight times. G.D. Searle, founder of aspartame, tried to get FDA approval in 
1973. Clearly, he wasn&rsquo;t bothered by reports from neuroscientist Dr. John 
Olney and researcher Ann Reynolds (hired by Searle himself) that aspartame was 
dangerous. Dr. Martha Freeman, a scientist from the FDA division of Metabolic 
and Endocrine Drug Products, declared, &ldquo;The information submitted for 
review is inadequate to permit a scientific evaluation of clinical 
safety.&rdquo;<strong>Freeman recommended that until the safety of aspartame 
was proven, marketing the product should not be permitted. Alas, her 
recommendations were ignored.</strong>Somehow, in 1974, Searle got approval to 
use aspartame in dry foods. However, it wasn&rsquo;t smooth sailing from there.
<strong>In 1975, the FDA put together a task force to review Searle&rsquo;s 
testing methods. Task force team leader Phillip Brodsky said he &ldquo;had 
never seen anything as bad as Searle&rsquo;s testing&rdquo; and called the 
test&rsquo;s results &ldquo;manipulated.&rdquo;</strong> Before aspartame 
actually made it into dry foods, Olney and attorney and consumer advocate Jim 
Turner filed objections against the approval.</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;In 1977, the FDA asked the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office to 
start grand jury proceedings against Searle for &ldquo;knowingly 
misrepresenting findings and concealing material facts and making false 
statements in aspartame safety tests.&rdquo;</strong> <strong>Shortly after, 
the U.S. attorney leading the investigation against Searle was offered a job by 
the law firm that was representing Searle. Later that same year, he resigned as 
U.S. attorney and withdrew from the case, delaying the grand jury&rsquo;s 
investigation. This caused the statute of limitations on the charges to run 
out, and the investigation was dropped. And he accepted the job with 
Searle&rsquo;s law firm. Stunning.</strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;In 1980, a review by the Public Board of Inquiry set up by the FDA 
determined that aspartame should not be approved. The board said it had not 
been presented with proof of reasonable certainty that aspartame is safe for 
use as a food additive.&rdquo; In 1981, new FDA Commissioner Arthur Hull Hayes 
was appointed. Despite the fact that three out of six scientists advised 
against approval, Hayes decided to overrule the scientific review panel and 
allow aspartame into limited dry goods. In 1983, he got it approved for 
beverages,<strong>even though the National Soft Drink Association urged the FDA 
to delay approval until further testing could be done</strong>. That same year, 
Hayes left the FDA amid charges of impropriety. The Internal Department of 
Health and Human services was investigating Hayes for accepting gratuities from 
FDA-regulated companies. He went to work as a consultant for Searle&rsquo;s 
public relations firm.<strong>Interesting.</strong><em> </em>The FDA finally 
urged Congress to prosecute Searle for giving the government false or 
incomplete test results on aspartame.However, the two government attorneys 
assigned to the case decided not to prosecute. Later, they went to work for the 
law firm that represented Searle.<strong>Fascinating.</strong> Despite 
recognizing ninety-two different symptoms that result from ingesting aspartame, 
the FDA approved it for use,<strong>without restriction</strong> in 1996. 
Brilliant.</p> 
<p>[...]</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Nutrasweet and Equal contain aspartame. When ingested, one of 
aspartame&rsquo;s ingredients, methyl alcohol, converts into formaldehyde, a 
deadly neurotoxin. In addition to aspartame, Equal contains the amino acid 
phenylalanine. Phenylalanine occurs naturally in the brain. But high levels can 
increase the chance of seizures and lead to depression and schizophrenia. There 
is no lesser of the two evils. NutraSweet and Equal are both evil. Sweet and 
Low is no saint, either. It is an artificial sweetener that contains saccharin, 
a coal-tar compound.&rdquo; [source]</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m going to focus on three major issues, here.</p> 
<p>For starters, this should lay to rest that philosophy of &ldquo;If it were 
so bad for you, then the FDA wouldn&rsquo;t have approved it.&rdquo; The amount 
of trust we give our government officials would make sense if those positions 
weren&rsquo;t held by people with their own humanity to contend with. Look at 
the instances of people who were bought off, paid off, pushed aside, ignored 
all to get this product approved.</p> 
<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of knowing what you&rsquo;re eating 
&ndash; both the positive and negative information &ndash; before you eat it. 
If you didn&rsquo;t know all of this about aspartame before you decided to make 
it a staple in your diet, is it time to reassess whether or not it belongs in 
your diet?</p> 
<p>Thirdly, this is the issue with processed foods. They make use of chemicals 
used for other purposes in nature in order to create flavors and tastes in a 
fashion that would be<strong>much more costly<em> </em></strong>if the actual 
foods themselves were used to make the product! You are introducing chemicals 
into your system&hellip; period.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;[Aspartame is a low-calorie sweetener made by joining two amino 
acids with an alcohol. It is approximately 180 times sweeter than sugar.] Some 
researchers claim to have linked aspartame to brain tumors and lymphoma, but 
the FDA insists that the sweetener is safe for humans. A list of complaints 
submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services includes headaches, 
dizziness, diarrhea, memory loss and mood changes. The Center for Science in 
the Public Interest states that children should avoid drinks sweetened with 
aspartame.&rdquo; [source]</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Think about it &ndash; a chemical was created to cause the brain to react 
to it in the same way as sugar. Many people &ndash;<em>many people </em>- claim 
they experience withdrawals when they take a break from products containing 
aspartame. The only other instance I can think of where a person is willfully 
introducing a mind-altering chemical into their system&hellip; definitely 
causes withdrawal symptoms when people break from it. I&rsquo;m sure 
you&rsquo;re familiar with heroin&hellip; cocaine&hellip; meth&hellip; I could 
go on, but I&rsquo;m sure you get the point.</p> 
<p>And since I&rsquo;m ticking everyone off? Let&rsquo;s talk about Splenda.
</p> 
<p>Knowing what we know about the 40-some-odd years of aspartame&rsquo;s 
existence, splenda (made ofsucralose), has an equally young past. One more 
quote:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Because we&rsquo;re having so much fun, lets bash the shit out of Splenda, 
one of the newer sweeteners. Splenda is made by chlorinated sugar, changing its 
molecular structure. The finished product is called sucralose. The makers of 
this poison tout its lack of calories and claim it&rsquo;s safe for diabetics. 
The FDA calls sucralose 98 percent pure. The other 2 percent contains small 
amounts of heavy metals, methanol, and arsenic. Well gee, at least it 
doesn&rsquo;t have any calories. So what if it has a little arsenic? Sucralose 
has been found to cause diarrhea; organ, genetic, immune system, and 
reproductive damage; swelling of the liver and kidneys: and a decrease in fetal 
body weight. What a splendid product! [source]</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Really, I&rsquo;m over it. All those little diet dishes that are 
&ldquo;sweet&rdquo; thanks to this stuff? I&rsquo;m over those, too. I have a 
family history of cancer&hellip; what do I look like putting known 
cancer-causing agents (also known as carcinogens) in my body? No thanks.</p> 
<p>These sweeteners are not food. They are chemicals meant to trick your body 
into thinking they are something they aren&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know how many 
different times, in how many different ways I can say this, but it goes as 
follows:</p> 
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t care how many miles you run each day, how many pounds of 
weight you lift or how chiseled your muscles are. You cannot live a fully 
healthy life if you ingest chemicals to survive. You are cheating your insides 
&ndash;</em><em><strong>screw what you look like on the outside</strong> 
&ndash; if you don&rsquo;t care for them as much as you care for your abs, your 
booty, your legs or whatever else you adore. Period.</em></p> 
<p>Believe it or not, I don&rsquo;t share this stuff with the intention of 
telling anyone to give it up. We all (hopefully) have reasons for making the 
decisions we make. My point in sharing this information is so that we can, 
again, make educated decisions about the food choices we make. Clean eating is 
simple. Easy. The foods are of the Earth, I&rsquo;m of the Earth, this is a 
win. When we introduce outside substances to our diet, our bodies deserve the 
twenty minutes it might take to hit up your favorite wellness-promoting website 
and do a search. It&rsquo;s seriously not that hard.</p> 
<p>I will say this, though: I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the philosophy that 
says &ldquo;those who know better, constantly strive to do better.&rdquo; Just 
a thought.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t drink or eat diet foods. I don&rsquo;t like the aftertaste. 
It amazes me how many people try to give me that nasty stuff because I&rsquo;m 
diabetic. I tell them I eat plain sugar, honey, and maple syrup. I just eat a 
lot less of it and make it worth the indulgence.</p> 
<p>I baked some adult devil&rsquo;s food mini-bundt cakes for a friend and 
saved one for my doctor this week who swears by that nasty diet chocolate jello 
mousse. I told him to first have a spoon of his mousse, a sip of water, then 
have a bite of the cake. After he demolished it, he asked me how I lost as much 
weight as I did if I could bake like that. Told him &ldquo;Moderation, my dear 
doctor. I want to get off these meds, and not exchange them for another daily 
prescription because the &ldquo;splenda/equal&rdquo; chemicals have further 
upset my hormonal balance.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. Ain&rsquo;t happenin&rsquo;! 
But you can have a really scrumptious cake ever so often that is worth the wait.

<p>I definitely agree with your points about this &ldquo;diet&rdquo; stuff. It 
took me years to realize that although the diet pop didn&rsquo;t contain any 
calories it was not helping my weight loss goals. I finally gave it up after 
watching an episode of the reality show- &ldquo;Ruby&rdquo; she is working on 
losing weight and her doctors told her to stop drinking diet pop and I gave it 
up to. I was finally able to lose those &ldquo;last 10 pounds&rdquo; and I 
haven&rsquo;t looked back!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m curious to hear your thoughts on Stevia&hellip; I&rsquo;ve 
started using more natural sugars as of late and substituted Stevia for my 
Equal/Splenda addiction. My mother absolutely cannot have sugar even in small 
amounts as it really just doesn&rsquo;t agree with her system so Stevia was 
suggested as an alternative. I haven&rsquo;t heard nearly the same negative 
press about it as it&rsquo;s derived from a plant&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>Look deeper into this. Some high people in high places pushed this. 
Aspartame hinders the ability to think clearly. Pilots aren&rsquo;t allowed to 
drink it for that reason. Look at flouride also. It&rsquo;s been proven to 
lower the IQ in children. It does nothing for teeth.</p> Reply <br>

<p>so true about the flouride! check out the movie &ldquo;The Beautiful 
Truth&rdquo; on you tube! it will open your eyes asap about this food industry 
and how they mass produce food like its a ford plant! After this I went through 
all of my cabinets and the fridge and was so amazed how all these cancer man 
made products (hence MAN MADE) are killing us and they know it! I bagged all 
thaqt crap up and took it right back to Meijers, got my money back and bought 
all healthy stuff! it took me about 3hrs to grocery shop that day b/c I had my 
notes of what to look for so reading and shopping for better items took awhile!
</p> 
<p>so basically id I cant kill it, grow it, or preserve it I do not eat it! 
Nor if I cant pronounce the ingredients! As for the floruide in water I am 
about topurchase me a big berky water system. this thing even cleans and 
purifies swamp water and is used when natural disasters strike! Flouride does 
harmful things to the brain! that why Hitler used flouride for control of the 
people in Germany! to dumb them down and have no emoitons so that they wouldnt 
give a hoot about what he was doing to them!</p> 
<p>Sorry for the long post but Im just so passionate about this and my health!

<p>Through this site I was introduced to clean eating and since I wanted to 
know what I was getting into I did my research. After days of articles, blogs 
and videos I read a lot of the stuff you mention in your article. Let me just 
say, knowledge is power! I stay way from the stuff and will now even eliminate 
my consumption of table sugar&hellip;no more sweet tea!!!</p> 
<p>The best piece of advice I&rsquo;ve read to date &ldquo;if you didn&rsquo;t 
make it, why eat it&rdquo;. Guess that should apply to beverages too.</p>

<p>I was a certifiable splenda addict, and I cut it out of my diet about a 
month ago. Its been pretty difficult since I love coffee and tea, but 
I&rsquo;ve started drinking my coffee black because I&rsquo;ve recently adopted 
a &lsquo;if I can pronounce the ingredients, I can&rsquo;t eat it&rsquo; 
philosophy&hellip;. welp, that goes for flavored coffee creamer too. I do put a 
little honey in nightly cup of tea, though.</p> Reply <br>

<p>This was very informative. All thru HS I would drink diet soda to maintain 
my weight (which now looking back was body image issues)and all my black 
friends would look at me like I was nuts. Then I started getting migraines, 
crazy cravings and felt tired all the time. So I started drinking water to see 
if my diet was the reason for my ailments and eventually narrowed it down to 
the diet soda. Most recently I realized these toxins are also in crystal 
lite-like water flavorers&ndash;I use to drink these all the time! We really 
have to scrutinize what we consume.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Splenda/sucralose is also a common migraine trigger.</p> 
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why I was getting headaches after eating 
&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; lowfat yogurt and microwave kettle corn &hellip; that was 
why. Neither of them are advertised as &ldquo;low sugar&rdquo; or &ldquo;sugar 
free.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hidden in all kinds of things, especially &ldquo;low 
calorie&rdquo; things. I&rsquo;ve switched to Greek yogurt and plain popcorn 
(you can flavor it however you want).</p> 
<p>And there is evidence (that I didn&rsquo;t see mentioned, but I 
might&rsquo;ve missed because it&rsquo;s been a bad day) that eating these 
sweet-without-sugar things confuses your brain and causes you to overeat later.

the truth about my eating, I&rsquo;ll continue to be a hamster on a wheel.</p>

<p>Another great article Erika. I recommend Stevia, a natural calorie free 
sugar or Xylitol and Erythritol, both all natural sugar alcohols and both 
calorie free as alternatives to regular sugar to my clients. Brand names that 
can be found are Sweet Leaf(Stevia), Truvia and PureVia(Stevia/Erythritol 
blend), IDEAL and XyloSweet(Xylitol)</p> Reply <br>

<p>I love that you are posting on &lsquo;fake&rsquo; diet foods and 
supplements and how they are actually unclean because of all the chemical 
processing. Can you possibly (if you haven&rsquo;t done so already) do 
something on medications? I suffer from PMDD and the number one thing doctors 
prescribe for it is Paxil. I&rsquo;m trying to manage my condition 
naturally&hellip; through diet, exercise and relaxation techniques. Can you 
weigh in on antidepressants, birth control, HRT and what not? I think drugs are

<p>Thank you so much for writing this Erika. I don&rsquo;t even know what to 
add in my commentary &ndash; I agree with everything you&rsquo;ve said. I 
didn&rsquo;t know suh specific information was available regarding the risks of 
ingesting low calorie chemical sweeteners&hellip; I just always knew that they 
weren&rsquo;t natural and had no business being in my body. They are addictive, 
mind altering &amp; an absolute perversion of food. Eating these sweeteners 
leaves you unable to recognize natural sweetness from beets, collard greens, 
yam, corn and basil. I never want to mutilate my tastebuds in such a way that I 
cannot taste these sweet super foods in their natural, unseasoned state. Thank 
you for urging us to make informed decisions about the things we put in our 
bodies</p> Reply <br>

<p>I wrote about this very same thing about a year ago, on this site, and I 
was told by another subscriber to this site to &ldquo;watch myself&rdquo; 
because I could be sued my the makers of Aspartame, because there was a 
possibility that I did not know what I was talking about! LMBO! ROTF! Bottom 
line is you want to be healthy, and I just don&rsquo;t healthy in anything 
&ldquo;ARTIFICIAL&rdquo;, like ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. Stick to the pure cane 
sugar, or other natural derivatives!I had aspartame poisoning, yet I 
didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about!!! Anyway, I&rsquo;m glad I have 
someone else backing me up! It&rsquo;s best to just decide to use sugar, or not 
use it, or find other sweeteners, like Coconut sugar; it&rsquo;s $10.00 a can, 
but it is the sugar recommended for diabetics. However, many natural sweeteners 
have just as many calories as regular sugar, it&rsquo;s the glycemic index you 
need to look at. The only small problem is that many other natural sweeteners 
change the flavor of your food or beverage, to something you may not be 
accustomed to. The best sweetener for you is &ldquo;BLACK STRAP 
MOLASSES&rdquo;. It has a low caloric level, and it contains 600mg of POTASSIUM 
and 11mg of salt. Potassium is an electrolyte, and you need electrolytes to 
keep your heart beating. ELECTROLYTES = Salts, sugars and potassium. Bottom 
line is you want to be healthy, and I just don&rsquo;t healthy in anything 
ARTIFICIAL, like ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. Stick to the pure cane sugar, or other 
natural derivatives! </p> Reply <br>

<p>I love your blog, but I think you&rsquo;re missing the worst thing about 
diet soda&ndash;the acid that goes directly on your teeth. Dentists call all 
soda, including diet soda&ndash;&rdquo;Drano for teeth.&rdquo; Pop permanently 
erodes the enamel right off your teeth. The Coke formula, when in concentrate, 
is labeled &ldquo;corrosive.&rdquo; I saw this on a Coke documentary. Do you 
still want to be sexy and have your teeth when you&rsquo;re 90? Stop drinking 
Drano!!!</p>

<p>Thank you for this article. I recently decided to cut calories in my coffee 
with splenda and I believe it made me very &ldquo;jumpy&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;jittery&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m mad I spent the money on it, but I had a very 
quick reaction to it. I hate aspertame and saccharin and knew there were 
problems with those too. I guess I should have known splenda wouldn&rsquo;t be 
much better.<br>
 Also, thank you for this blog! I am very inspired by your 
weight loss and clean eating. I have a lot of weight to lose and have started 
the weight watchers program. I can already see that I need to pay more 
attention to what I&rsquo;m eating and not JUST the point values, but the 
health values.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Great article! I looked into the whole aspartame thing recently and was 
horrified to read the story around how it got FDA approval. I got interested 
after a few of my clients mentioned that they had been suffering from MS-type 
symptoms which disappeared when they gave up diet drinks. I know this is 
anecdotal but it prompted me to look into it and it seems that these symptoms 
were even known to the FDA.<br>
 Thank you for raising awareness of this and 
the other atrocities of the &ldquo;diet food&rdquo; industry.</p> Reply <br>

<p>What is your suggestion in sweeting green tea. I drink the loose tea. I buy 
it from a framer&rsquo;s market. Anyone whose had the bagged stuff and then 
green tea leaves learns immediately that there is a definite difference in 
flavor and potenance. Its a strong flavor. But it helps my digestion. 
So&hellip;is sugar in a raw a better option?</p> Reply <br>

<p>I found out about this my last year of high-school. It took me back to a 
conversation I had in sophmore year about high fructose corn syrup, and my 
friend, who was overweight, tried to tell me that ish was FINE as long as it 
was in moderation. Fair to say I&rsquo;ve dropped 30 pounds, and 
she&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..yeah.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I also wanted to add that it is also very worth it to eat as much 
organic things as possible. I found a site that goes in on a company called 
MASANTO, look them up!!! They sell genetically modified seeds so most of those 
&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; vegetables in big chain stores &hellip;..are super 
tainted. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Google &ldquo;the case against masanto&rdquo;. 
It&rsquo;s like this country does EVERYTHING in it&rsquo;s power to make sire 
we get ill!!!!!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I am sitting here with an OMG face. I stopped shaking the Nutrasweet packs 
a few years back, and changed to Splenda. I later learned from my doctor that 
Splenda was &ldquo;bleached sugar&rdquo;. I changed to stevia, and earlier I 
read your post on Five things you Should Know About Sweetners and again yet 
another mouth drop moment. Stevia should be brown. Thank you for the 
information you are posting.</p> 
<p>I need to take heed: Listen to yourself &ndash; if you&rsquo;re looking to 
run and hide from your feelings in a sweet treat, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter 
what kind of sugar is in it. The problem isn&rsquo;t the eating, it&rsquo;s 
your coping mechanism, and it&rsquo;s up to you to be honest with yourself 
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>just quoting a friend here</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When ingested, one of aspartame&rsquo;s ingredients, methyl alcohol, 
converts into formaldehyde, a deadly neurotoxin.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;ok big deal? alcohol metabolizes to acetaldehyde but you don&rsquo;t 
see people saying the FDA should re enact the prohibition. formaldehyde is 
mainly dangerous if you inhale it, not ingest it. otherwise people who like 
pears would be in trouble! (pears contain 60mg/kg formaldehyde, which is also 
present naturally in apples, bananas, seafood, etc) also: your own body makes 
it anyway as part of the digestive process. a lot of the way chemicals are 
processed by your body depends on the method of arrival. (as well as the 
quantity)&rdquo;</p> 
<p>what do you have to say about this?</p> Reply <br>

<p>First, I&rsquo;d say use your real name next time &ndash; there&rsquo;s 
nothing to hide from around here, even if &ldquo;your friend&rdquo; is you. </p>
<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;d say that the argument that &ldquo;the body naturally 
produces this anyway!&rdquo; is the same argument behind why food processors 
are using countless chemicals to &ldquo;get us hooked&rdquo; on their foods. 
&ldquo;Your friend&rdquo; says &ldquo;a lot of the way chemicals are processed 
by your body depends on the method of arrival.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t forget that 
&ldquo;the method of arrival&rdquo; ALSO includes &ldquo;how it was 
created&rdquo; and &ldquo;what it is paired with.&rdquo; &ldquo;In a lab&rdquo; 
with &ldquo;not nary a single nutritive element&rdquo; is not an acceptable 
comparison to &ldquo;in nature&rdquo; with &ldquo;adequate nutritive 
value.&rdquo; I trust a natural cycle much more than I trust a cycle created by 
people in white coats with big glasses and stockholders to please.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be dismissive of science and real scientific 
reason, but I am trying to make it clear &ndash; as history has already done 
before &ndash; that science doesn&rsquo;t always know enough and until it does, 
I&rsquo;ll stick with Mother Nature.</p> Reply <br>

<p>i&rsquo;m sorry i&rsquo;m having trouble understanding the 
importance/relevance of holding an anonymous title and quoting a friend, 
it&rsquo;s my choice. So I&rsquo;m not sure why you are being (for lack of a 
better term) derogatory using repetitive and unneeded quotations throughout 
your deduction. It&rsquo;s rather quite silly~</p>

<p>Aspartame was used as rat/mouse poison. Ever since I read that I never eat 
or drink anything with that in it! I don&rsquo;t remember where I read this but 
it was a trustworthy, reliable, medical or public interest source. Also, for a 
science project in 8th grade, I submerged some teeth in different liquids for 
different periods of time. Coca cola/Pepsi did indeed damage the tooth enamel 
significantly &ndash; but it didn&rsquo;t dissolve it, at least in the time 
frames I used. Lemon juice also damaged tooth enamel significantly as well. 
This was straight 100%, in for hours, though, so it would not be real life 
(well unless you like to suck on lemons/ limes all the day). Anyway, one is 
natural and one is a scientific concoction meant to taste good. One with an 
ingedient that kills rats and mice. In unscientific terms: blech!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I just started a sugar detox program yesterday but on week 3 because I 
already don&rsquo;t eat High frutose corn syrup (week 1) and I already eat 
whole wheat instead of white, but the thing I was worried about was the splenda 
and my fat free flavored creamer. I knew I needed to give these last two things 
up but didn&rsquo;t know how. Well after reading this article, I have listed 
unopen bottles of creamer, big box of splenda to anyone that wants it on 
facebook. I am done. Thank you.</p> Reply <br>
