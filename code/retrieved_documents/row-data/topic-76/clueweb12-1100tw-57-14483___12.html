<p>Is it possible that eating apple pie can actually lower your blood 
sugar?&nbsp; The answer is yes, but ONLY if it contains this one critical 
ingredient.</p> 
<p>The idea of using this special ingredient medicinally is far from new. 
&nbsp;Chinese, Ayurvedic and naturopathic medicine all utilize it for a variety 
of conditions, including nausea, bloating, GI upset, and libido enhancement.</p>
<p>However, it was the accidental discovery of its benefits for treating and 
preventingtype 2 diabetes that has made this special ingredient one of the 
world&rsquo;s most celebrated spices.</p> 
<p>You may be surprised to learn that this special ingredient is something 
that you&rsquo;ve likely used dozens, if not hundreds of times before:cinnamon.
</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s Accidental Discovery&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>While cinnamon was deemed to be more precious than gold by the ancient 
Egyptians and considered to be a gift fit for a king by the Romans and Greeks, 
it was Dr. Richard Anderson, a researcher at the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, who made this sweet spice truly valuable.</p> 
<p>Dr. Anderson was trying to discover the effect that apple pie had on blood 
sugar levels. &nbsp;In fact, he was hoping to show that apple pie would 
dramatically increase blood glucose levels.&nbsp; Instead, they were lowered1
.&nbsp; Yep, lowered&hellip;as in, eat dessert and<em>decrease</em> your 
glucose levels.</p> 
<p>Dr. Anderson was as baffled as you likely are.&nbsp; How on earth could a 
sweet, baked pielower blood sugar levels?</p> 
<p>He quickly realized that it was the cinnamon in the apple pie that was 
responsible for the lowering of blood glucose levels by acting on the true 
underlying cause of type 2 diabetes.</p> 
<p><strong>Cinnamon Improves Insulin Sensitivity&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>More specifically, Dr. Anderson discovered that cinnamon contains a 
polyphenol called methylhydroxy chalcone polymer (MHCP)2 that can improve the 
metabolism of glucose in fat cells twentyfold3.</p> 
<p>It does this by reducing the insulin resistance of fat cells, making their 
insulin receptors more responsive.</p> 
<p>To explain how this works, imagine trying to talk to your spouse while the 
kids are screaming, the television is blaring, and the dog is barking to go 
outside.&nbsp; Pretty unlikely your spouse can pay attention, right?</p> 
<p>Now, let the dog out, turn off the television, and settle the kids down 
with a snack and a game and your spouse will finally be able to hear you!</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s how insulin resistance/insulin responsiveness works.&nbsp; If 
there is too much insulin or &ldquo;noise&rdquo; in your bloodstream, your 
cells cannot hear the message.</p> 
<p>But if you turn down the noise (i.e. improve glucose metabolism), your 
cells can hear the message and allow the insulin receptors to be more 
responsive.&nbsp; Of course, we can&rsquo;t promise the same results with your 
spouse!</p> 
<p>And, when cells are better able to hear insulin&rsquo;s message; and can 
better absorb and use glucose, the result is lower blood glucose levels.&nbsp; 
Type 2 diabetes is caused by your body becoming resistant to the effects of 
insulin.&nbsp; The bottom line here is that cinnamon appears to help reduce 
this resistance.</p> 
<p>Though this sounds great in theory, let&rsquo;s see if the studies support 
the hypothesis.</p> 
<p><strong>Diabetes Studies Abound&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>As you can imagine, Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s accidental discovery unleashed a 
whole host of studies on the connection between cinnamon, glucose, insulin, and 
diabetes.&nbsp; Since it would be unreasonable for us to list and you to read 
them all, here are a few of the most intriguing.</p> 
<p>In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study4, researchers gave 60 
volunteers with type 2 diabetes either 1, 3, or 6 grams of cinnamon powder (or 
placebo) in capsules after meals each day for 40 days.</p> 
<p>At the end of the study period, those taking the cinnamon (in any amount) 
enjoyed a decrease in blood sugar levels ranging from 18 to 29 percent.</p> 
<p>In fact, the blood sugar levels of the volunteers who received cinnamon 
were an average of 20 percent lower than were those of volunteers in the 
placebo group.&nbsp; Some members of the cinnamon groups even achieved normal 
levels.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, researchers also found that those participants taking the 
cinnamon also showed a decrease in triglycerides by as much as 30 percent and a 
decrease in total cholesterol ranging from 12 to 26 percent&mdash;and without 
any toxicity problems.</p> 
<p>In other words, less than a tablespoon of cinnamon lowered blood sugar 
levels, decreased triglycerides, and reduced total cholesterol in just over one 
month without any negative side effects.</p> 
<p>Sounds good, but it <em>was</em> only 40 days. &nbsp;What if the study was 
longer?</p> 
<p>German researchers wondered the same thing.&nbsp; In their double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study, they tested the effect of cinnamon on patients with 
type-2 diabetes who were taking oral diabetes medication5.</p> 
<p>They divided the participants into two groups.&nbsp; The first group 
received an aqueous extract of cinnamon (the equivalent of 3 g of cinnamon 
powder) while the second group was given a placebo.</p> 
<p>After four months, the group taking cinnamon experienced a 10.3 percent 
reduction in blood sugar, compared to the placebo group&rsquo;s drop of 3.4 
percent.</p> 
<p>Once again, less than a tablespoon of cinnamon seems to reduce blood sugar 
levels.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s about the amount you would sprinkle on your oatmeal 
in the morning.&nbsp; Not a bad way to start the day.</p> 
<p>Finally, researchers2 also tested the use of cinnamon versus insulin to 
encourage glucose metabolism.&nbsp; Using an in vitro (think test tube) cell 
culture, researchers found that the bioactive polymer in cinnamon stimulated 
glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis to a level comparable to that achieved by 
insulin.</p> 
<p>In other words, the tasty spice worked as well as the medication&hellip;at 
least in a laboratory.&nbsp; It would be interesting to see this repeated in 
humans to determine if cinnamon would still perform as well as insulin in type 
2 diabetics.</p> 
<p><strong>The News Isn&rsquo;t All Good&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>While the research on cinnamon and its ability to lower blood sugar levels 
is fairly well established and accepted, even in conventional circles, there 
are some potential problems having to do with precisely which form of cinnamon 
is safe and effective to use.</p> 
<p>The main issue has to do with numerous oil-based compounds&mdash;as well as 
such water-soluble ones such as MHCP&mdash;found in cinnamon bark.&nbsp; The 
key terms here are &ldquo;oil&rdquo; and &ldquo;bark&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>These oil compounds from the bark are known to be toxic when<em> </em>taken 
at high doses for long periods of time.&nbsp; Oils extracted from the cinnamon 
leaf are non-toxic.</p> 
<p>Similarly, cinnamon <em>powder</em> has been shown to be safe, even when 
used often and regularly, with no shown toxicity or negative side 
effects.&nbsp; This is due, in large part, to the fact that cinnamon powder has 
much of the essential oils removed during processing.</p> 
<p>To be even safer, you may choose to use a water-soluble versus oil-based 
form of cinnamon.</p> 
<p><strong>Putting Cinnamon to Use&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>Cinnamon is so common, and so delicious, you are likely already using 
it.&nbsp; But, to help you incorporate it into your everyday life, here are a 
few suggestions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You can add cinnamon to a hot liquid that you drink every day such as 
coffee, or preferablygreen tea, to make it more of an extract. </li> 
<li>Use cinnamon sticks to make tea. </li> 
<li> Add cinnamon powder to coffee beans before grinding to give your morning 
java a blood sugar reducing boost.</li> 
<li>Add &frac12; to 1 teaspoon to oatmeal or any hot cereal.</li> 
<li>Add &frac12; to 1 teaspoon to your favorite smoothie.</li> 
<li>Make sweet potato cinnamon &ldquo;fries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cut a sweet potato 
into disks.&nbsp; Spray a cookie sheet with olive oil and place potato disks in 
single layer on the cookie sheet.&nbsp; Spray the potatoes with the olive 
oil.&nbsp; Sprinkle potatoes with cinnamon and bake at 425&deg;F for 
20&ndash;25 minutes, turning halfway through the cooking time.</li> 
<li>Finally, replicate Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s apple pie experiment&hellip;sort 
of.&nbsp; Core an apple, then it cut in half from top to bottom.&nbsp; Sprinkle 
with cinnamon and bake at 375&deg;F for 20 minutes or until the apple is soft.
</li> </ul> 
<p>No matter how you use cinnamon, if you are either at risk for or have been 
diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, it is one spice you should get to know.</p> 
<p>Just remember that cinnamon should be a tasty <em>addition</em> to your 
diabetes program&hellip;not the starring role.&nbsp; The most powerful method 
for reversing your type 2 diabetes requires substantial changes to your 
lifestyle including eating a diet chock full of nutrient-dense, low 
glycemic-load whole foods and to engage in moderate daily exercise.</p> 
<p>And as always, check with your doctor when adding any herb, spice, or 
supplement to your medical regimen.</p>

<p>We use cinnamon in our kitchen and I remember my grandma&rsquo;s advice on 
herbs and cinnamon was one of the most important among mint, black pepper, 
cumin, turmeric. The article was very informative and having a diabetic in the

<p>It has to be Cinnamon Verum (such as Ceylon cinnamon), not the common 
cinnamon found in supermarkets.</p> </li>

<p>Rod,</p> 
<p>There are two types of cinnamon: cassia and Ceylon. According to WebMD 
(conventional of the conventional), &ldquo;Cassia cinnamon is the kind most 
Americans use for baking and cooking. It&rsquo;s also the variety most 
researchers have used when they&rsquo;ve studied cinnamon and diabetes.&rdquo;

<p>V interesting. I would like to know if this was a fasting test.<br>
 I too 
had a non fasting test: so sugar would be raised, I guess. No, completely the 
opposite: I had extremely low sugar levels after eating. So this must be normal 
right. So if everyone has a non fasting sugar test it is always going to be low 
&ndash; unless you have some sort of diabetise. Possibly?</p> </li> 
<li> Will <br>

<p>If you were not so CHINTSY with the size and boldness of your message, just 
MAYBE I (and others) would bother to read it.&nbsp; ANYONE who has to resort to 
using these &ldquo;tiny text&rdquo; tactics has PLENTY to hide &ndash; WHAT ARE 
YOU HIDING???</p> </li> 
<li> Brireward <br>

<p>B6&nbsp; is a blood sugar leveler.&nbsp; I love cinnamon and must be 
careful anymore because I&rsquo;ve had &ldquo;attacks&rdquo; of low sugar and 
my heart beats rapidly to circulate my blood and bring up the levels.&nbsp; I 
take a few hundred mgs of B6 every day now and it controls these and also helps 
me to lose wt without trying.&nbsp;<br>
 Cinnamon also lowers blood 
pressure.&nbsp; Mine is low enough so guess I have to use ginger more instead! 
It replaces cinnamon&nbsp;somewhat &nbsp;in egg nogs.</p> </li>

<p>Hey Will,</p> 
<p>Thanks for your comment &mdash; could you clarify what &ldquo;tiny 
text&rdquo; tactics you are talking about?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;tiny 
text&rdquo; that I can think of on our website.&nbsp; Perhaps you are having a 
problem with your browser settings making text on here seem small?&nbsp; All of 
our articles have large, 14 point Verdana text, intentionally larger than on

<li> Celeste <br>

<p>I heard that these effects of cinnamon are eliminated by the saliva in your 
mouth. To get the full benefit of cinnamon, you must take it in capsule format 
(not in apple pie). Can you verify this?&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li>  http://naturalhealthsherpa.com Natural Health Sherpa <br>

<p>Celeste,</p> 
<p>Consumption of cinnamon has definitely been shown to be effective (as 
evidenced by the above studies), though certainly a supplement would be 
effective as well.</p>
