<h2>Sweeteners</h2> 
<h3>Sweet Choices</h3> 
<p> By Claire Cronier </p> 
<p> Are you worried about the calories in sweeteners like sugar and honey? Are 
sugar substitutes a better way to sweeten foods without the extra calories? 
Let&rsquo;s consider the sweet choices available to people with diabetes, and 
how they fit as part of a healthy diet.</p> 
<h3>Two types of sweeteners</h3> 
<p> There are two basic categories of sweeteners, nutritive and nonnutritive. 
Nutritive sweeteners provide calories or energy to the diet at about four 
calories per gram, just like carbohydrate or protein. Common examples of 
nutritive sweeteners include white and brown table sugars and molasses, honey, 
and syrups such as maple and corn. These are all sweet tasting because of the 
presence of glucose and fructose, alone or together as sucrose. Sugar alcohols 
known as sugar relatives are another category of nutritive sweeteners. They are 
derived from fruits or produced commercially from dextrose. The most common 
include: sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and maltitol. Sugar alcohols also provide 
energy to the body and may affect your blood glucose. Nonnutritive sweeteners, 
also called sugar substitutes or artificial sweeteners, do not provide calories 
and will not influence blood sugars. These include: saccharin, cyclamate, 
aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame potassium.</p> 
<h3>Artifical sweeteners</h3> 
<p> Saccharin is the oldest of the nonnutritive sweeteners, and is available 
under the brand name HermesetasTM . In Canada, saccharine is available only as 
a tabletop sweetener and is sold in tablet or powder form in pharmacies. It is 
300 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar) but has a slightly bitter/metallic 
aftertaste. Because saccharine is not metabolized in the human body, it does 
not contribute energy or calories. Saccharin has been the center of controversy 
for many years because of its alleged relationship with cancer; however, 
research studies have been unable to find direct associations.</p> 
<p> Aspartame is marketed for commercial use under the brand name NutraSweetTM 
and is found in breakfast cereals, soft drinks, desserts and candy. It is also 
known as EqualTM, a powder for use in the home. Although technically considered 
a nutritive sweetener contributing four calories per gram, aspartame is 200 
times sweeter than sugar and very little is needed to achieve sweetness. 
Therefore, its calorie contribution is negligible. Aspartame is made up of two 
amino acids, the building blocks of protein: aspartic acid and phenylalanine. 
It is therefore digested and metabolized the same way as any other protein 
foods. People diagnosed with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare hereditary disease, 
need to limit phenylalanine intake and therefore should not sure aspartame.</p> 
<p> Cyclamate is marketed under the brand name SucarylTM and is used in Sugar 
TwinTM and Weight WatchersTM. It is 30 times sweeter than table sugar and has 
no aftertaste. This sweetener is heat stable, so it can be used in hot and cold 
foods. Cyclamate is heat stable, so you can cook and bake with it without 
losing its sweet taste. In Canada, cyclamate can only be purchased as a 
tabletop sweetener or as a sweetening additive in medication.</p> 
<p> Sucralose, available as a tabletop sweetener and as an ingredient in food 
processing, is marketed as SplendaTM. Sucralose is a white crystalline powder 
made from sugar itself. Sucralose is 400 to 800 times sweeter than table sugar. 
Because it is stable even when subjected to extreme heat or cold, sucralose can 
be used in a variety of cold and hot drinks, pastries and baked goods, and 
frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Although its chemical structure is 
very close to that of sucrose or table sugar, sucralose is not recognized by 
the body as a carbohydrate and has no effect on insulin secretion or overall 
carbohydrate metabolism in healthy human beings.</p> 
<p> Acesuflame Potassium (AceK) is the latest nonnutritive sweetener approved 
by Health Canada. It is marketed under the brand name SunettTM. AceK is found 
in beverages, fruit spreads, baked goods, dessert bases, tabletop sweeteners, 
hard candies, chewing gum and breath fresheners. It is 200 times sweeter than 
table sugar. People who are on a potassium restricted diet or have 
sulfa-antibiotic based allergies should discuss the use of Ace-K with their 
physician.</p> 
<p> All sweeteners available in Canada go through rigorous testing. Once they 
have been approved it means that they are suitable for use by all Canadians, 
including those with diabetes.</p> 
<p> Although non-nutritive sweeteners taste sweet and do not add calories to 
food, they often cannot be substituted directly for sugar in recipes. Sugars 
and syrups also add to the texture and colour of foods in ways that these 
sweeteners will not. Many of the manufacturers have developed special recipes 
for using these products.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h3> Sugar Alcohols</h3> 
<p> Because sugar alcohols are absorbed and metabolized by the body more 
slowly, they were once believed to be good sugar substitutes for people with 
diabetes. However, sugar alcohols sometimes cause abdominal discomfort and, 
because they provide calories, they are not as popular a choice as artifical 
sweeteners. The real benefit of sugar alcohols is related to the inability of 
mouth bacteria to use them as a source of energy. Therefore, they do not 
contribute to dental caries (cavities). Some products that may contain sugar 
alcohols include hard candy, chocolate, table syrups, chewing gum, jams and 
jellies and some cough lozenges and syrups.</p> 
<h3>Are these sweeteners safe?</h3> 
<p> Health Canada considers all available scientific information on the 
effectiveness and safety of sweeteners. Regulations are then developed to 
identify how they should be used and what amounts should be allowed. A 
recommended daily intake (RDI) has been set by the Canadian government for most 
sweeteners. Since RDIs are based on body weight and may therefore be different 
for everyone, ask your dietitian about your own RDI if you use sweeteners 
regularly. Current evidence suggests that &lsquo;normal use&rsquo; 
concentrations of artificial sweeteners are not a health risk.</p> 
<h3>The real thing</h3> 
<p> In the past, people with diabetes were told to avoid sugars and other 
carbohydrates. Current research shows that it is the amount of carbohydrate 
eaten and the rate of its digestion that are the most important factors in 
blood glucose control. Sugars can be included in a healthy diet as a part of a 
carefully planned meal plan. Carbohydrates, including sugars, should be spread 
evenly over the day, as part of slowly digested meals. If you have questions 
about sugars and your diet, check with your registered dietitian, a certified 
diabetes educator or the Canadian Diabetes Association.</p> 
<p> Of course, sugars do provide some calories, but foods or drinks made with 
artificial sweeteners may not always be low in calories either. If you are 
concerned about calories, it is important to check the nutrition information 
panel on the food label. Remember, fat provides nine calories per gram, more 
than twice the amount provided by carbohydrate (including all sugars) and 
protein.</p> 
<h3>Use moderation</h3> 
<p> When used in moderation as part of a healthy and wellbalanced diet, sugar 
substitutes can contribute to the enjoyment of eating. They are not, however, a 
miracle solution in achieving or maintaining a healthy weight nor in managing 
diabetes. When trying to lose weight, your best bet is to follow the 
Canada&rsquo;s Food Guide, and to be a little more active each day. Making sure 
that you are getting all the nutrients you need to maintain good health should 
be your first priority.</p>
