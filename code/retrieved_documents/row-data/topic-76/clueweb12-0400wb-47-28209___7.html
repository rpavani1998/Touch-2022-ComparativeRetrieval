<h2>Producing sweeteners locally</h2>  by Simon St. Laurent 
<p>One of the most common complaints about the industrial age is its constant 
and seemingly ever-growing use of sweeteners. Whether it was cheap sugar (and 
rum) in the early 1800s, saccharin in the early 1900s, or high-fructose corn 
syrup in the late 20th century, sweeteners have had a bad&mdash;but 
tasty&mdash;reputation.</p> 
<p>In a local context, however, sweeteners are extremely important. Many of 
the local fruits that contain Vitamin C, for instance, are difficult eating 
unless sweetened.<i>Aronia Melanocarpa</i> is called &quot;chokeberry&quot; for 
a reason. Black currants are difficult eating off the bush. The more familiar 
perennial rhubarb also becomes far more enjoyable with sweetening. Even in less 
extreme cases, sweeteners can certainly add enjoyment to foods otherwise too 
bitter or too bland to be attractive. Sugar is also very important in 
preserving food, where it creates a hostile environment for bacteria as well as 
a delicious treat.</p> 
<p>Many different sweeteners are available today, though they may become more 
or less important in localization or energy descent situations. Some require 
industrial facilities and major energy inputs, and a few are dangerous, but 
many familiar sweeteners will likely remain available into even an uncertain 
future.</p> 
<h2>Sugar and Molasses</h2> 
<p>Sugar cane, a tropical plant, doesn't grow in Central New York. United 
States sugar producers are in Louisiana and Florida, though sugar refineries 
have been prominent features of port cities along the coasts. Modern sugar 
production relies on energy-intensive industrial processing and distribution. 
Cane sugar's long history, however, suggests that it and its by-product 
molasses can still be valuable with reduced processing, as extracting sugar is 
relatively simple and can be fueled with the cane that created it[1]. Sugar 
distribution and storage are similarly simple, as it is easily packed for safe 
storage.</p> 
<p>Sugar produced from beets has many of the same issues as cane sugar, but 
unlike sugar cane, sugar beets can be grown in New York State. However, the 
quantity of sugar beets currently grown is small enough that the USDA National 
Agricultural Statistics Service[2] doesn't even offer sugar beets as a query 
option for New York. Today, sugar beets receive more industrial processing than 
does sugar cane, despite containing 17% sugar while cane contains 10%. Unlike 
cane, beets cannot easily be processed using their byproducts for fuel. (The 
byproducts are typically used as animal feed.) Sugar beets are also typically 
used as a crop in rotation, so the yield per acre is substantially lower than 
that of cane.[3] Sugar beets can be processed at home on a small scale by 
chopping, boiling, and evaporating, however.[4]</p> 
<p><br>

<p>The primary questions about sugar in an energy descent situation revolve 
around price, distribution, and quality.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Though sugar in the United States is expensive relative to sugar in the 
rest of the world (roughly double the Canadian price because of American import 
quotas[5]) it remains a remarkably cheap commodity by historical measures. As 
the energy costs of sugar refining climb, those prices will likely climb. 
Diversion of sugarcane to ethanol production may also shrink the available 
supply of sugar substantially, also increasing the price.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>If energy costs climb, the cost of distributing sugar, especially cane 
sugar coming from a distance, will climb. Sugar works well with slower and less 
energy-demanding forms of transport, but transitions to new distribution 
patterns may take time. Disruptions may also be more difficult because of the 
longer supply chain of cane sugar.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>While less-refined sugar has become a high-end product recently, most 
people still expect their sugar to be a pure white with a relatively neutral 
taste and predictable cooking behavior. If the extra energy cost of refining to 
white sugar climbs, more people may need to get used to less-refined sugar.</p> 
</li> </ul> 
<p>It may be possible to create a substantial sugar beet industry in New York 
State&mdash;or it may make sense to count on sugar's relatively easy 
tradability to keep it available.</p> 
<h2>Corn sweeteners</h2> 
<p>Corn-based sweeteners thrive today because of a combination of the import 
quotas noted above and subsidies for corn production. Dent corn is converted 
into corn starch by a wet millling process and then treated with enzymes to 
produce corn (glucose) syrup. High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is made by an 
additional enzyme process to convert much of that glucose to fructose.[6] This 
is a strictly industrial energy intensive process:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Corn wet milling is the most energy intensive industry within the food and 
kindred products group, using 15% of the energy in the entire food industry. 
After corn, energy is the second largest operating cost for corn wet millers in 
the United States. A typical corn wet milling plant in the United States spends 
approximately $20 to $30 million per year on energy.[7, page 3]</p> 
<p></p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
<i>Figure 2. Wet corn mill (original source, used under Creative 
Commons license from Jim Hammer.)</i></p> 
<p>While dent corn can be grown locally, the industrial scale and energy 
requirements of wet corn milling seem to put local corn syrup out of reach. 
There was a corn wet mill in Montezuma, New York, just up Cayuga Lake, but it 
closed in 1986.[7, page 73] Like sugar, corn syrup can be easily transported 
and stored.</p> 
<h2>Artificial sweeteners</h2> 
<p>If you count the extremely toxic &quot;Sugar of Lead&quot; (lead acetate), 
artificial sweeteners have been around for thousands of years, though the 
modern history usually begins with saccharin in 1879. While it is likely 
possible to create most of these sweeteners in the laboratory facilities 
available at Cornell, most of them are produced today in large volume at 
chemical plants.</p> 
<p>As many artificial sweeteners (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and 
sucralose) are sweeter by volume than sugar, and store reasonably well, they 
may be easier trade goods than sugar itself. Xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, 
the sweet alcohols, are roughly as sweet as sugar and are useful both to 
sweeten food for diabetics and potentially as a tooth decay preventative.</p> 
<p>Lead acetate deserves special attention as a danger, as it is not difficult 
to synthesize from lead and has commonly been used as an adulterant in foods 
and drinks.</p> 
<h2>Honey</h2> 
<p>Honey is a commonly available sweetener that can be produced in large 
quantities in the Finger Lakes region. Beekeepers encourage hives to produce 
more honey than they need to survive the winter, then take the extra honey for 
human consumption.</p> 
<p>Beekeeping is a complex art, though it scales down to the household level 
more easily than the production of many other sweeteners. Keeping hives alive 
has become more difficult in recent years with the spread of pests, notably 
varroa mites, but the infrastructure and learning investments required to 
become a successful beekeeper are still fairly small.</p> 
<p>Until the mid-19th century, beekeepers used hollow logs or straw houses, 
called skeps, for their bees. While these worked, they didn't allow beekeepers 
to inspect the hive for disease, and the hive usually had to be destroyed to 
retrieve the honey. Because of disease issues, skeps are illegal in the US.</p> 
<p>Most beekeepers use Langstroth hives, rectangular boxes filled with frames 
in which the bees make their home. So long as beekeepers maintain precise 
distances between equipment inside of the hive, the bees will avoid gluing 
everything together. This flexibility makes it simpler for beekeepers to 
inspect the hive, as well as to add and remove equipment to gather honey. 
Langstroth equipment does require a fairly substantial investment, and most 
beekeepers buy sturdy frames filled with wax or plastic foundation printed in a 
hex pattern. This gives bees a bit of a head start, and reinforcements in that 
foundation make it much easier to extract honey by spinning the frames 
mechanically.</p> 
<p><br>
<i>Figure 3. Bees on framed comb, honey top right, brood lower left.

<p>It is possible, though slow, to replace frames with bars with a simpler 
strip of wax on the bottom and have the bees build their comb on that, but the 
frames will be less regular and more difficult to use with an extractor. Taking 
that idea further, some beekeepers are using top bar hives. These hives fit 
into a single box organized horizontally rather than stacked vertically. The 
bees build their own comb, and beekeepers who want to collect the honey press 
or cut the comb instead of spinning it. This destroys the comb, requiring the 
bees to work harder to make new honey, but requires less dedicated equipment.
</p> 
<p>While much beekeeping equipment can be built from readily available wood 
and metal, two pieces of the beekeeping system are more difficult. The 
foundation is generally manufactured, though it can be created on a smaller 
scale using old equipment like some of that on display in theDyce Lab at 
Cornell. The harder challenge is the supply of bees and queens. New bees and 
queens can be raised in the north, but at present most nurseries for bees are 
considerably farther south and rely on express delivery services. Local 
breeding has become more popular as a way to improve bees, so this may not 
remain an issue for very long.</p> 
<p>Beekeepers are facing an ever-wider variety of diseases and parasites. 
While Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) made headlines, most beekeepers are 
battling a variety of problems, most notably varroa mites. Chemical solutions 
can keep mites at bay, but mites seem likely to be a permanent feature of 
beekeeping at this point. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) mixes chemical and 
other approaches, focusing on keeping hives going. Inspection, now an optional 
event in New York State, may become especially important again if beekeepers 
have to rely on their own production of bees rather than importing new ones 
from the south.</p> 
<p>While some beekeepers might find warmer weather convenient, changing 
weather patterns, especially if extreme weather becomes more common, could 
create difficulties. Rain and snow can keep bees in their hives and prevent 
their collecting food, while drought can delay or hinder plants from flowering. 
Bees also fly much less when temperatures are 90&deg; F or higher, staying home 
to cool the hive. Bears moving north present another challenge.</p> 
<h2>Maple Syrup and Maple Sugar</h2> 
<p>Upstate New York has been producing maple syrup and maple sugar for 
centuries. Native Americans taught European settlers about collecting and 
concentrating sap, and Europeans gradually technologized and standardized the 
process. It was a key part of the development plan for early Cooperstown, 
though visions of maple fortunes faded quickly[8], and the energy and 
infrastructure challenges of making maple syrup have kept it from competing 
with cane or beet sugar. (Beet syrup starts at a concentration of 6 parts water 
to 1 part sugar, cane syrup starts at 10:1, and maple sap is at 40:1.)</p> 
<p>While many modern maple syrup producers use plastic tubing to collect the 
sap, simple metal taps and buckets can provide a sustainable (if 
labor-intensive) collection system. Even a simple pot can work for boiling down 
sap, though large flat pans and especially more complex flue pans make it much 
easier to evaporate sap down to syrup. An indoor wood stove already used for 
heat can boil syrup at the household level, while a sugarhouse with vents is 
likely a better idea for a larger pan. A sugarhouse will need a dedicated 
supply of wood (or other fuel), but that is frequently available in the same 
areas as maple stands.[9]</p> 
<p>While sugar maples (Acer saccharum) are the traditional tree for maple 
syrup production, red, black, and some silver maples can also be tapped, as can 
box elders and birches.</p> 
<p>At any scale, however, maple faces some challenges. The flow of sap depends 
on the weather, particularly on the contrast between daytime and night time 
temperatures. Sap flows during the day, carrying sugar from the roots. A winter 
that turns too suddenly into spring can disrupt maple production, as can 
seasonal storms that make it difficult to collect and evaporate syrup. The 
short season and its unreliability make maple syrup a risky product. While it 
is not difficult to preserve maple syrup, its greater water content makes it 
more likely to spoil than honey or sugar. (Maple syrup can be made into maple 
sugar, at a large energy cost in additional refining.)</p> 
<p><br>
<i>Figure 4. Evaporating syrup in Marathon, NY (photo Simon St.Laurent)
</i></p> 
<p>Maples also face environmental challenges. Climate change may shift the 
range northward, giving hickories and oaks an advantage while limiting maples. 
Long-term changes in spring weather patterns could also complicate or reduce 
the maple season further. The Asian Long-Horned Beetle, already present in New 
York City, attacks and weakens maple trees and a variety of other species. 
Larvae tunnel through the wood, weakening the tree.[10] These beetles may 
reduce the number of healthy maples and make it more difficult for new maples 
to survive.</p> 
<h2>Sorghum</h2> 
<p>Sweet sorghum, though traditionally grown further south, can produce a 
syrup similar to molasses, as well as silage or forage for animals. Some 
farmers are experimenting with it in Tompkins County as a cover crop and animal 
feed today, and it may be an appealing option if climate change extends the 
growing season.</p> 
<p>Processing sorghum for syrup requires stripping the leaves and seed head 
off the cane, then squeezing the juice out of it and evaporating and skimming 
that juice. Crushing the cane is generally done with a simple mill, and the 
resulting juice yields about a gallon of syrup from ten gallons of juice.[11]
</p> 
<p><br>

<h2>Fruit Juices</h2> 
<p>Fruit juices and concentrates, and even applesauce, are classic sweeteners. 
While whole fruits are, of course, a delicious way to enjoy fruits, juicing and 
similar processes make it much easier for people to consume fruits that are 
bruised, damaged, or simply useful as a background sweetener rather than as the 
primary flavor. Commonly available apple and grape juices, both products of 
Upstate New York, are regularly used to provide bulk and sweetness to more 
expensive juices like cranberries, blackberries, blueberries, or (more 
recently) pomegranate.</p> 
<p>Like fruits, fruit juices can be canned or frozen. They require more energy 
input to preserve than do sugar or honey, but are easier to create with 
ordinary pots or pans or with simple tools like steam juicers. They scale up to 
greater volumes easily as well.</p> 
<h2>Malt</h2> 
<p>Grains are another common source of sweetness. Malting grain is a fairly 
complex process involving drying, storing, adding water, partially germinating, 
and then processing and often mashing. Today most malting relies on industrial 
equipment and purpose-built malting floors, but the basic steps can be done 
with simple equipment on a wide variety of scales.</p> 
<p><br>
<i>Figure 6. Malting floor (original source, used under Creative 
Commons license from Chris Sharp)</i></p> 
<p>Malt is most commonly used as a fermentation base for beer and whiskey, but 
it is also a key component in malted milks, malt vinegar, and malt candies. 
Barley is the most common grain used for malting. Many grains are bred 
specifically to provide the enzymes needed for the malting process.</p> 
<h2>Stevia</h2> 
<p>Stevia is a relative newcomer, at least in the United States. The plant <i>
Stevia rebaudiana</i>, originally from South America, has leaves that are 
approximately 30 times sweeter than sugar, and its core sweetening compounds 
are approximately 250 times sweeter. The Food and Drug Adminstration has 
allowed the sale of stevia as a food supplement but not as an ingredient, 
though stevia-derived sweeteners are now legal for use.</p> 
<p><br>
<i>Figure 7. Stevia plant. (original source, used under Creative 
Commons license from Irene Kightley)</i></p> 
<p>Stevia's climate expectations limit its use for large-scale plantings in 
Tompkins County. However, it may prove useful as a household-scale sweetener, 
especially for people who have difficulties with other sweeteners. It can grow 
as a window plant, getting the sun that it needs while avoiding the cold. 
Stevia leaves can be used directly as a sweetener without further processing.
</p> 
<h2>Alcohol</h2> 
<p>All of the natural sweeteners except stevia can be converted into alcohol 
through fermentation, possibly followed by more energy-intensive distillation. 
Malt is traditionally used for beer; fruit juices for wine; hard cider, and 
brandies, honey for mead; and sugar and molasses for rum. In addition to its 
intoxicating qualities, alcohol can be used as a preservative and to sterilize 
medical equipment and wounds.</p> 
<p>In an energy descent situation, however, sugars are perhaps dangerously 
attractive as an easy source of alcohol for fuel. Competition between food and 
energy uses of sugar will likely increase demand (and prices) for sweeteners.
</p> 
<h2>Policy Suggestions</h2> 
<p>Some projects supporting local sweetener production already exist. 
Cornell's Master Beekeeper program and its work with maple products in the 
Arnot Teaching and Research Forest focus on honey and maple syrup. Cornell 
Cooperative Education offers sessions on fruit juices and preserving.</p> 
<p>Some sweeteners, notably cane sugar and corn syrup, are unlikely ever to 
become local products, and most of the artificial sweeteners are unlikely to 
become economical local products.</p> 
<p>Sorghum and stevia originated in far warmer climates than Tompkins County 
has to offer, but both are worth exploring in different contexts. For now, 
sorghum seems useful primarily as a cover crop, with some potential for use as 
a sweetener. Stevia is more promising because of its ability to grow as a 
houseplant, and could be an excellent target for Cooperative Extension projects 
and local nursery development.</p> 
<p>There is one great danger here, something that local public health 
officials should watch for: the possible return of lead acetate. At present, 
this threat is discussed mostly in the context of imported food, but it could 
just as easily surface in local food. Watching for symptoms and developing 
testing protocols could become much more important if the price of sweeteners 
climbs.</p>
