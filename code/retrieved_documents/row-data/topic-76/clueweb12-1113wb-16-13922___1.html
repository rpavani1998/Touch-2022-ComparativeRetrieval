Most 
medical experts would agree that one of the best ways to improve your health is 
to reduce your sugar intake. Doing this can help decrease one&rsquo;s chances 
of getting diabetes and being overweight or obese---both epidemics in this 
country with adults and children alike. Consider these facts:
<ul> 
<li>Since 1985, childhood diabetes has increased ten-fold. The Centers for 
Disease Control predicts that if this trend continues, one out of every three 
children born beginning in 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime.</li> 
<li>About 2/3 of U.S. adults are overweight or obese; while up to 30% of 
children are overweight, compared to 4% in 1982. In the past 25 years, obesity 
in children has more than doubled, affecting at least 15% of school-age 
children!</li> </ul> The average American ingests over 150 lbs. of sugar 
annually! That represents a whopping 30- 5 lb. bags of sugar each year! In 
reality, much of this sugar is in the form of high fructose corn syrup 
prevalent in foods because it&rsquo;s much cheaper than sucrose, common 
tabletop sugar.
<p> While some might think that artificial sweeteners are the best solution to 
curb our love affair with sugar, others disagree. Artificial sweeteners do 
eliminate the high calories and carbohydrates associated with sugar, however 
many believe that these alternatives are unsafe and are actually worse than 
sugar. So is there yet another alternative available?</p>
<p> If there were an all-natural sweetening ingredient that&rsquo;s been used 
safely for over 30 years in other parts of the world for food applications and 
diabetes management with no ill effects, would you be interested? Well, such a 
substance does exist and it&rsquo;s called stevia.</p>
<p> Using stevia, an all-natural alternative to sugar and artificial 
sweeteners, is gaining increasing popularity worldwide. Stevia rebaudiana, its 
botanical name, is derived from a plant in the chrysanthemum family grown 
primarily in South America and Asia. The plant&rsquo;s intense sweetening 
qualities are complex molecules called steviosides that are glycosides made of 
glucose, sophorose and steviol. These are what make stevia up to 300 times 
sweeter than sugar and non-caloric. These glycosides do not get absorbed into 
the body; rather simply pass through leaving no calories. The Japanese have 
used stevia in food applications from soft drinks to soy sauce since the 1970s 
and recent reports indicate that stevia commands up to an incredible 50% share 
of Japan&rsquo;s commercial sweetener market. Moreover countries like Brazil 
use stevia for the treatment for diabetes.</p>
<p> The advantages to stevia are numerous, so the following are the most 
frequently cited. In its pure form, it&rsquo;s non-caloric and doesn&rsquo;t 
affect glucose levels, an advantage for diabetics and hypoglycemics. Also, it 
has no carbohydrates or fat, so it&rsquo;s great for dieters, especially those 
watching carb intake. Unlike artificial sweeteners, high quality stevia has 
little aftertaste when measured properly. It has no known side effects like 
some chemical sweeteners and has been safely consumed around the world for 
decades. Actually, stevia&rsquo;s original medicinal uses date back centuries 
ago with the Paraguan Indians who mixed the herb in teas for its healing 
properties. Since stevia is sugar-free, candida sufferers can use it. Health 
conscious consumers take advantage of stevia to avoid sugar and help prevent 
diabetes and obesity. The websitewww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, under the direction of 
the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine and National 
Center of Biotechnology Information, offers abstracts from stevia studies that 
indicate it may also aid in lowering blood pressure and regulating glucose 
levels.</p>
<p> The average consumer may not have heard about stevia until recently 
because of its current FDA approval as a dietary supplement, not as a sweetener 
or food additive. Numerous studies worldwide tout its overall safety and health 
benefits. As of this writing, about ten countries, including Japan, Paraguay 
and Brazil have approved stevia as a sweetener and/or food additive. The FDA 
approved the use of stevia only as a dietary supplement since 1995. This means 
stevia companies must maintain a fairly low profile, thereby limiting its 
distribution and marketing potential. For instance, health food stores and 
natural grocers must place stevia in the supplements section, not with the 
natural sweeteners for fear of the FDA mandate. The stores cannot promote the 
&ldquo;sweetening&rdquo; qualities of stevia, even though that&rsquo;s why it 
is purchased.</p>
<p> Stevia can be used as a healthy substitute in most sugar applications, 
including baking and cooking since it is heat stable. The average conversion 
rate of sugar to stevia is one cup of sugar per one teaspoonful of pure stevia 
extract. Clearly very little stevia is needed to replace sugar. When used in 
beverages, stevia dissolves quickly and easily and, depending on your taste 
preference, only a pinch is needed. The real challenge to using stevia 
effectively is knowing what ingredients to use in a recipe to make up for the 
volume and consistency lost with the elimination of sugar, especially in baked 
goods. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good idea to find stevia cookbooks with 
proven recipes when you&rsquo;re starting out. You can also find some free 
recipes online. Finally, stevia is not appropriate in recipes that require 
sugar caramelizing or browning like meringues.</p>
<p> Stevia is available in many forms including liquid, teas, plants/leaves, 
pure white and green powdered extract and powdered blends with different 
fillers. In baking, the pure extract is used primarily and, in some cases, the 
liquid variety. Stevia can be purchased at health food stores, natural grocers, 
food coops and online. Currently a big push is underway to expand distribution 
into grocery stores, vitamin shops and drugstores.</p>
<p> Due to the number of factors that can influence your stevia purchase 
experience, the following guidelines provide some good advice:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You often do get what you pay for; don&rsquo;t buy based solely on price; 
taste and quality matter.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Higher % of stevioside doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make the stevia better; 
you can find excellent tasting stevia with this key plant composition at even 
80%.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>If you purchase the green powder for its slightly higher health benefits, 
it will usually have more aftertaste than the white powder.</li> 
<li>The product&rsquo;s country of origin doesn&rsquo;t matter; it&rsquo;s 
farming, manufacturing and processing experience and techniques do.</li> 
<li>At this time, stevia production is not standardized, so taste and strength 
do differ depending on brand.</li> 
<li>Use a minimal amount; can be overwhelming if you add too much initially; 
add more later if needed.</li> </ul> Widespread use of sugar and artificial 
sweeteners are at dangerous levels. The negative side effects and controversial 
studies regarding their proposed safety suggest that another alternative is 
desirable and necessary. Stevia may be a welcome option for those who want to 
ingest more natural ingredients with no known side effects, no calories, no 
carbs, no fat, no affect on glucose levels and no sugar or artificial 
sweeteners. Stevia may also be advantageous in the prevention and treatment of 
diabetes, obesity and other health conditions. Check with your doctor before 
including stevia to your diet. If he/she doesn&rsquo;t recommend it, politely 
ask why to see if the reason is satisfactory to you.
