<h2>Artificial sweetener disease &ndash; a new illness</h2> 
<p>1 Comment 13 December 2011</p> 
<h1><strong><br>
Artificial Sweetener </strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>Disease </strong><strong></strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>- a new illness</strong></h1> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, 
Healingtalks Editor</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Has anyone ever heard of<strong> Artificial 
Sweetener Disease</strong> <strong>(ASD)</strong>? You can be certain it is 
something that affects a multitude. Because modern medicine shuns the 
recognition that synthetic chemicals, as a class, will harm you (its bad for 
business)&nbsp; it is an undiagnosed&nbsp; ailment sweeping across America like 
wildfire and affecting probably hundreds of thousands of Americans.</p> 
<h3><strong>Symptoms of ASD vary </strong></h3> 
<p>Its symptoms are usually ascribed to other routinely diagnosable causes, 
and for which synthetic chemicals are legally prescribed (pharmaceutical 
drugs). Those symptoms that trigger these prescriptions or Big Pharma sales can 
include a vast array of immune system dysfunctions &ndash;<strong>migraines, 
inflammations, emotional depressions, various muscular pains, chronic fatigue, 
and you name it</strong>. Again the cause must religiously be ascribed to 
something a drug then is prescribed for, and anything but a reaction&nbsp; 
synthetic chemical in our diet. These are in the artificial 
&ldquo;phoods&rdquo; that we are told are ok to eat &ndash; especially 
&ldquo;divine&rdquo; sweeteners.</p> 
<h3>Are most physicians part of a corrupt &ldquo;healthcare&rdquo; culture</h3>
<p>This is because, ideologically, it taboo for most physicians to oppose 
chemicals in our foods or high levels of processing of food. Why? Readers of 
this blog know I&nbsp; don&rsquo;t look favorably on doctors or hospitals when 
it comes to such stances. I see most doctors as not being integral to the 
public, as they make loads of money. They are the leading and highly paid&nbsp; 
&ldquo;frontmen/women&rdquo; for Big Pharma&nbsp; (firms allied to the largest 
chemical-producing giants for foods and agriculture as well) &ndash; and thus 
promote a corrupted-by-commerce ideology of so-called &ldquo;healthcare.&rdquo; 
Of course we are not told that doctors are part of sales assembly0line Oh no!
</p> 
<h3><strong>Myth of having best-guiding knowledge</strong></h3> 
<p>Doctors are supposedly wise and rational &ndash; uplifted by TV ads and the 
like to become authorities to be blindly trusted. In reality, doctors are 
indoctrinated to believe drugs are the best thing since sliced bread. They 
then, with the belief and economic incentives, lure us all &ndash; and 
incredibly against common sense and reason, to take in some of the most highly 
toxic substances (like mercury in vaccinations) into our bodies, through our 
mouths and down the hatch or through our veins! Even with cancer being caused 
by chemicals, we are supposed to take in more chemicals, and as part of the 
most corrupt forms of denial. We are deceived, by those who are self-deceived, 
and especially when we are repeatedly told, as a mantra, that lethally harmful 
effects are just insignificant &ldquo;side-effects.&rdquo; Tell that to the 
families of the 2-300,000 people who die<em>every</em> year of these 
&ldquo;side-effect&rdquo; &ndash; and from&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;properly prescribed
</em>&rdquo; pharmaceuticals in America alone! Many more are harmed for the 
rest of their lives. ASD is a case in point.</p> 
<h3><strong></strong></h3> 
<h3><strong>Symptoms of ASD becoming increasingly intense</strong></h3> 
<p>The symptoms of ASD can also become more intense, depending on how much of 
the chemical sweetener we dare to consume, and in what combinations. Chemical 
additives often become far more seriously toxic when combined with others. 
Consumers can thus go from having a mild headache to violent fits of vomiting. 
Central nervous system disorders following the ingesting of these sweeteners 
are also common, as are nervous twitches and abnormal reflexes. (See:&nbsp;
<strong> aspartame info</strong>)</p> 
<h3><strong>Military health crises</strong></h3> 
<p>A wave of fibromyalgia hit the American troops during the Gulf War. Studies 
showed that drinking diet sodas in the 120 degree heat lead to serious health 
repercussions. It was called the &ldquo;Gulf War Syndrome,&rdquo; but the same 
problem occurred to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. (<strong>See: Story of gulf 
war syndrome)</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Extent of the problem</strong></h3> 
<p>Synthetic sweeteners are now in over 25% of all food, drink, gum and candy 
available. This is bound to create a vast cumulative effect and with the end 
result is ASD, another form of synthetic chemical overload or gross pollution 
of our internal ecology. See our articles on the<strong>life-centered vision of 
nature</strong>, and which explains why the 17th-century borne math-designing 
ideology (which underlies all of synthetic chemistry) does not really represent 
the root order of nature, why it so disrupts and systemically harms our bodies).
</p> 
<h3><strong>No drug cure</strong></h3> 
<p>This is why there is no curing drug for this syndrome and there never can 
or will be one. What sufferers of ASD really need is a detoxification from a 
life-long pollution of synthetic chemicals (which began to be significantly 
added to our food supply in the late 1940&prime;s to make more $-profits) 
&ndash; and which goes against the wisdom of our bodies. A vast number of 
health ailments are caused by resulting chemical overloads when we ingest those 
&ldquo;phoods&rdquo; &ndash; additives approved by the FDA, what I always call 
the single most corrupt and harming agency on the planet (<strong>See story of 
illnesses caused by artificial sweeteners</strong>).</p> 
<h3><strong>Drugs can make conditions far worse</strong></h3> 
<p>Cancer is a distant end result of taking in synthetic chemicals while 
living in a toxic, polluted world. ASD is one of the short-run and ever growing 
consequences. It is never cured by taking in more chemicals, which out to be so 
obvious.</p> 
<h3><strong>So what is the cure?</strong></h3> 
<p>It really takes no Phd from Harvard to figure that out. Just throw away 
your artificial sweetener-full products &ndash; like<em><strong> sugar free 
gum, candy, and drinks</strong>. </em> <em>Read labels. </em> <em> <strong>
Avoid aspartame, sucralose, sorbitol, acesulfame-k, aspartic acid, and 
saccharine</strong>. </em> It may save your life.</p> 
<h3><strong><br>
 Non-toxic alternatives, in moderation<br>
</strong></h3> 
<p>Not to put on weight or to avoid a harmful glycemic blood sugar rush, try 
some more natural alternatives, like<strong> Xylitol or Stevia</strong>. They 
don&rsquo;t have the negative effects of chemical sweeteners.&nbsp; However, 
they have very little calories associated with a lot of sweetness, so you may 
end up having cravings. Thus it is better yet to have our sweets from fruits as 
nature more often intended. You could moderately eat more carrots and beets, or 
sweet tomatoes as well. If any problems remain, why not experiment with an 
elimination diet &ndash; eliminating one food at a time to see which you are 
allergic to. If that still doesn&rsquo;t work to find the cause, seek out a 
natural health practitioner for advice. Remember, if you are eating crappy junk 
food, drugs won&rsquo;t cure the resulting ill health harvest. Just stop eating 
the crappy-hellish junk food.

<p>Aerobic Exercise, Exercise &amp; Athletic Fitness, HEALING US, Insomnia,

<h2>Exercise can help you sleep at night</h2>

<h1>Exercise can help</h1> 
<h1>you sleep at night</h1> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>Julian Georgiou, Healingtalks Contributing Writer
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong>&nbsp; Dramatic statistics tell us that more 
than<strong>one-third of U.S. adults have trouble falling asleep at night
</strong> or staying alert during the day.</p> 
<p>Inadequate sleep has been linked to many ills, including depression, 
cardiovascular disease and other health problems. Getting a good night&rsquo;s 
sleep regulates moods, aids memory functions, plus concentration, learning, and 
focus. It is a critical factor in health, weight and energy levels (Davila, 
2009).</p> 
<h3><strong></strong>So what to do?</h3> 
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s explore combining a <strong>healthy diet and a regular 
exercise program.</strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<h3><strong><strong>Real links between exercise and sleep</strong></strong>
</h3> 
<p><strong><strong></strong></strong>Scientists at Northwestern University 
conducted a study which showed that those who exercised reported their<strong>
sleep quality improved immensely</strong>. They also reported fewer depression 
symptoms, more vitality, and less sleepiness during the daytime. &lsquo;By 
improving sleep, they were able to improve physical and mental health as well 
as the ability to fight diseases</p> 
<h3><strong>Exercise timing</strong></h3> 
<p>The type and timing of your exercise makes a difference.</p> 
<p>A <strong>light morning exercise</strong>, like running or walking 
outside,&nbsp; can relieve stress, improve mood and impact sleep at the end of 
the day. Exposure to natural light in the morning reinforces your body&rsquo;s 
sleep-wake cycle. Waking up earlier and walking or bicycling to work could help 
your overall vitality and quality of sleep (Virdil, 2011).</p> 
<p>To affect your sleeping habits even more, <strong>vigorous late afternoon 
or early evening exercise</strong> is recommended. Exercise too close to 
bedtime and you can have a negative impact because your body&rsquo;s 
temperature needs time to cool down. The exact time it takes can vary from 
person to person so a trial and error approach could be taken. The decrease in 
body temperature appears to be a trigger that helps ease you into sleep 
(Virdil, 2011).</p> 
<h3><strong></strong></h3> 
<h3><strong>Exercise types</strong></h3> 
<p>The type of exercise is also important. Virdil recommends a <strong>20 
minute cardiovascular workout</strong> to get the heart pumping. It will make a 
difference to the depth of sleep. Also it&rsquo;s best to choose an activity 
you love to do for your routine. It shouldn&rsquo;t be&nbsp; burden.&nbsp;
<strong>Having fun greatly betters the chance that the exercise is maintained.
</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Exercise for life</strong></h3> 
<p>Healthy eating and regular exercise are essential for a good life. To 
recap, the benefits of exercising includes; better sleep, greater weight 
control, improved immunity, less mood swings, higher levels of energy, and even 
a better sex life.<strong> Lastly it can be fun.</strong> So let get with it! 
Exercise regularly for better sleeping and which then leads to better living.

<h2>Kid&rsquo;s heart and cardiovascular health falls short</h2>

<h1>Kids&rsquo; heart and</h1> 
<h1>cardiovascular health</h1> 
<h1>falls short</h1> 
<h3>With poor diets, exercise,and high cholesterol levels</h3> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Federal data recently revealed a poor 
picture of American children&rsquo;s cardiovascular health. The data implies 
that our teenagers are at risk of increased heart disease compared to their 
parents.</p> 
<h3><strong>CDC study of youth cardiovascular health</strong></h3> 
<p>The study was conducted by the <strong>US Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention</strong> using a <strong>National Health and Nutrition Exam Survey
</strong> and it looked at children between 12 and 19 years old. The findings 
were that adolescents performed poorly on seven criteria set by the AHA or the 
American Heart Association for ideal cardiovascular health.</p> 
<h3>Survey</h3> 
<p>The Survey has been periodically conducted by the CDC among a nationally 
sample of Americans to track various health issues. The report, funded by the
<strong>National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</strong>, is based on an 
analysis of three different surveys of adolescents aged<strong>12 to 19</strong>
 between 2003 and 2008 &ndash; including a sampling intended to accurately 
represent minorities. The children in the study included 4,157 kids aged<strong>
12 to 17.</strong></p> <br>

<h3>Poor nutrition the chief problem</h3> 
<p>The diets of America&rsquo;s youth appeared to be strikingly out of 
whack.&nbsp;<strong>Not one of the 5,450 children randomly selected met the 
minimum standards for a healthy diet</strong>!</p> 
<p>Otherwise 16.4% of boys and 11.3% of girls were rated ideal on all six 
other criteria, which included smoking, exercise, weight, cholesterol, blood 
pressure and blood sugar.</p> 
<h3>Growing concern over obesity</h3> 
<p>The findings come at a time of growing concern about the impacts of obesity 
and other health risks for children. Recently the<strong>National Heart, Lung 
and Blood Institute</strong> called for all children between 9 and 11 years old 
to get a cholesterol tests early on.<br>
 The new study took an unusually 
comprehensive look at the issue.</p> 
<h3>Based on American Heart Association standards</h3> 
<p>The results are specific to these AHA standards. Researchers note that the 
ideal benchmarks in the seven categories have been shown to be associated with 
reduced risk of heart disease. &ldquo;Often, we just take an isolated focus on 
one of the risk factors,&rdquo; Dr. Lloyd-Jones said. &ldquo;The package is 
much more powerful than any single measure.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Findings as staggering</h3> 
<p>Veronique Roger, head of health-sciences research at the Mayo Clinic in 
Rochester, Minn., called the findings &ldquo;staggering.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Using the seven criteria for goal-setting</h3> 
<p>The seven criteria for ideal cardiovascular health are the backbone of a 
public-health initiative launched by the heart association with a goal to 
get&nbsp; just 20% of all American adults within optimal range on all seven 
measures.</p> 
<h3>Processes that lead to heart disease tend to begin in childhood</h3> 
<p>The focus on children reflects an awareness that while cardiovascular 
disease typically strikes later in life, the biological processes begin in 
childhood. Dr. Lloyd-Jones said some studies indicate that &ldquo;by six 
months, you can already see a worsening of cholesterol and blood 
pressure&rdquo; because of diet and other factors.</p> 
<h3><strong>Kids best performances</strong></h3> 
<p>In the survey kids performed <strong>best for blood pressure</strong> (more 
than 90% in the ideal range)<strong>and for not smoking</strong>, (80% of those 
17 and under had never smoked). The later performance fell to 60% to 70% for 
those 18 and 19 &ndash; reflecting legalized sales of tobacco for people 18 and 
older.</p> 
<h3>`</h3> 
<h3>Flunking on diet</h3> 
<p>The worst performance was again diet. Not a single adolescent met any of 
the targets in five different nutrition categories:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>4&frac12; servings or more of fruits and vegetables a day</li> 
<li>Three whole-grain servings a day</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Two or more servings of fish a week</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium daily</li> 
<li>Less than 36 ounces of sugar-sweetened drinks a week.</li> </ul> 
<p>Indeed, only about 20% of the adolescents met recommendations on two or 
three of the nutrition factors&mdash;considered an intermediate score.</p> 
<h3>Exercise</h3> 
<p>For exercise, 50% of boys and 60% of girls didn&rsquo;t regularly exercise 
for more than 60 minutes a day. Between 10% and 20% reported getting no 
exercise.</p> 
<h3>Cholesterol and Weight</h3> 
<p>About 30% to 45% had less-than-ideal cholesterol, while about one-third 
were either overweight or obese.</p>

others that can answer that question more fully &ndash; because there are many 
factors that are now converging together:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A food economy geared to making billions by selling the most highly 
processed (nutritionally-stripped) and addictive (sugary) foods &ndash; 
creating&nbsp; epidemics of obesity and diabetes, plus the four A&rsquo;s 
&ndash; asthma, autism, allergies, and attention deficit ills. They have 
penetrated our school systtems with automatic soda pop and junk candy machines. 
Now about 30 per cent of children and teens suffer from the four A&rsquo;s. Add 
to those statistics the impacts of obesity and diabetes, and we are<strong><em>
closer to having50 percent of children and teens being chronically ill.</em>
</strong></li> 
<li>A&rdquo;healthcare&rdquo; system is<em><strong> breath-taking-away 
corrupted</strong></em> and of course by the profit motive. This is why 
children remain so prone to never-ever cured chronic ills . We rather have a 
disease-maintenance system for mega-bucks. Rates of chronic diseases for teens 
and children have, in the meantime, quadrupled in the last three decades. 
Rather then our chirldren being healed effectively, they are deceptively 
converted into lifelong pharmaceutical drug customers and legal chemical 
addicts &ndash; with often highly serious so-called &ldquo;side-effects.&rdquo; 
In short, our whole misnamed &ldquo;healthcare&rdquo; system is not that at 
all, and is in a vast shambles. The statistics bear this out crystal clear.</li>
</ul> 
<h3>What we need</h3> 
<p>We really need a <em><strong>fundamental healthcare revolution</strong></em>
 rather than just a superficial band aide. This is a revolution toward an 
uncorrupted<em>natural</em> healing system -&nbsp; a real and not artificial 
one. The answers already exist for how to put the lives of our children and 
teenagers back together again.We just have to clear away, what stands in the 
way.</p> 
<h3>Healingtalks mission</h3> 
<p>We here at Healingtalks dedicated to promoting that revolution &ndash; and 
at the very deepest level. We provide the vital information and tools you need. 
This includes outlining natural cures for health conditions from A-Z, making 
the reader also aware &ndash; and to wake up to &ndash; cultural deceptions. We 
also and uniquely outline a whole new foundation for the healing arts &ndash; 
moving away from the mechanical&nbsp; (body-as-a-dead-machine model) which 
makes a diabolical marriage with profit-seeking commercial forces . We show how 
to replace the 17th century model that doctors are taught, and which is 
consciousness corrupt itself.</p> 
<p>As Gabriel Cousens writes, we are in he process of waking up from a deadly 
ill culture.</p> 
<h3>Focus on Teens</h3> 
<p>As a result all segments of our population are greatly suffering, and here 
the critical focus is on how our teens. They need to overcome these conditions 
to really exercise and be healthy effectively &ndash; to put their lives back 
together and become productive members of society.</p> 
<h3>Poor daily exercise among teens</h3> 
<p>According to the study, barely 1 in 9 or 12.2% met the <em>Healthy People 
2020</em> threshold &ndash; and for both adequate aerobic and muscle 
strengthening exercise. We can ask why? Perhaps our kids are too absorbed by 
sedentary activities they can do with modern technology &ndash; like intensive 
computer games.</p> 
<h3>Ideal teen fitness goals (HP 2020)</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Minimum of 1 hour of daily physical activity</li> 
<li>Minimum of 1 hour muscle strengthening exercises (e.g., sit ups, push ups, 
and resistance exercises) at least 3 days a week.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Poor nutrition among teens</h3> 
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Nearly two thirds (62.8%)</strong> drank any combination of 
regular soda or pop, sports drinks, and other sugar-sweetened beverages one or 
more times per day&rdquo; (NYPANS Study). The report also found that<strong>40% 
of daily calories</strong> of the typical student diet consisted of<strong> 
empty calories in foods filled with refined sugars and solid fats</strong> 
&ndash; mosly sourced from soda, fruit drinks, dairy desserts, grain desserts, 
pizza, and whole milk (Reedy, SM, 2010).</p> 
<h3><strong>Ideal teen nutritional goals (HP 2020)<br>
</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Eating <strong>2&frac12; cups to 6&frac12; cups of fruits and vegetables
</strong> each day, or</li> 
<li>Eating a minimum for <strong>whole grains of 2&ndash;3 ounces</strong> 
each day (CDC).</li> </ul> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Better eating choices amidst an obesity epidemic</h3> 
<p>Many schools are being challenged to offer better healthy choices. The CDC 
is thus involved in a program called &ldquo;<strong>Let&rsquo;s Move Salad Bars 
to Schools</strong>.&rdquo; Its goal is putting at least 6,000 salad bars into 
schools all over the country and in the next three years.</p> 
<h3>Compared to other counties</h3> 
<p>The US participates in <strong>HBSC or Health Behaviour in School-Aged 
Children study</strong>. The compares the state of health of American children 
to that of 42 other nations. US children ranked among the lowest in exercise 
frequency and the highest in ingesting sugary soft drinks and french fries. US 
students also ranked among the highest in not feeling healthy, happy, and 
having physical complaints. See<strong>HBSC findings</strong></p> 
<h3>The good news</h3> 
<p>Its been clearly discovered that kids will add fresh veggies and fruits 
into their diet if given the opportunity with a variety of choices.</p>

<h2>Can smaller cigarette pack sizes help smokers quit?</h2> 
<p>No Comments 22 November 2011</p> 
<h1><strong></strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>Can smaller cigarette </strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>pack sizes </strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>help smokers quit?</strong></h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks) </strong>&ndash; Cornell University researchers made 
adiscovery that those eating soup and using a refilling bowl tended to sip 
twice as much soup as those only given normal-size bowls. Apparently the 
portion size had a substantial influence.</p> 
<p>Could this insight be applied to making smaller <strong>packs of cigarettes
</strong> and to save lives?</p> 
<h3>The 10-cigarette pack</h3> 
<p>It&rsquo;s time overdue for a different and smaller <strong>standard-size 
cigarette pack</strong>. Currently the government mandates a standard <strong>
20 cigarettes per pack</strong>. Cigarette packs with less could help smokers 
at least cut back &ndash; and that is what some 70% of smokers want to do. But 
if you buy a full pack and smoke one, the other 19 are there to entice you for 
quite a while.</p> 
<h3>Paying for the trade-off</h3> 
<p>Would changing the pack size make a difference and catch on?&nbsp; Smokers 
generally don&rsquo;t purchase cartons but more expensive packs. So they might 
be willing to do the same for smaller packs. The limited access can<strong> 
help cut down or quit smoking.<br>
</strong></p> 
<h3>Now is the time</h3> 
<p>Now is the time to consider this change as Congress gave the Food and Drug 
Administration the power to do so.&nbsp; Before&nbsp; the FDA could only 
regulate nicotine replacement therapies such (patch and gum) but not the 
tobacco products themselves. Now, the FDA has the broader authority to<strong>
regulate cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco</strong>.</p> 
<p>As the FDA is developing new tobacco regulations; it should therefore 
consider smaller size packs.</p> 
<h3>This meets smokers needs and wants</h3> 
<p>Most smokers actually want fewer cigarettes. The average number of 
cigarettes smoked per daydeclined from almost 19.6 in 1993 to about 16.8 in 
2004. Non-daily smokers consume yet less cigarettes per day. A smaller pack 
might get smokers to smoke still&nbsp; less. Evidence suggests that those who 
cut back are thenmore likely to eventually quit.</p> 
<h3>Why larger packs</h3> 
<p>Part of the reason for larger 20-cigarette packs is to impede youths from 
smoking by keeping cigarette pack prices high. But according to the CDV, only 
about14% of youths who smoke buy their cigarettes directly from a store. 84% 
get them from&nbsp; family and friends.</p> 
<h3>Impediments to smoking</h3> 
<p>Among the enacted impediments to smoking are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Increased federal, state and even city excise taxes</li> 
<li>FDA ban of flavored cigarettes that appeal to youths</li> 
<li>Ban of all outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools</li> 
<li>Making it illegal to sell to those under 18</li> </ul> 
<h3>Let&rsquo;s add another</h3> 
<p>Teen smoking is again on the rise so why not help them and the majority of 
smokers&nbsp; trying to quit or cut back by mandating smaller packs. Indeed if 
the size of the bowl can determine how much soup you eat, so can the size of 
the pack determine how many cigarettes we smoke.</p>

economist and professor at the Yale School of Public Health. She is also a

Project, an organization seeking to expand the range of opinion voices to 
include more women.</em></p>

<h2>Shocking story behind a growing asthma epidemic</h2>

<h1>Shocking story behind</h1> 
<h1>a growing</h1> 
<h1>asthma epidemic</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Since 2001, asthma has been sharply rising 
among especially &ldquo;children, women, and minorities according to the 
Centers for Disease Control.</p> 
<h3>Asthma Statistics of CDC</h3> 
<p>In our ever more chemically polluted world, there has been an approximate 
doubling of the rate of asthma between 1980 and 1999. If that wasn&rsquo;t bad 
enough, the CDC more recent data from 2001&ndash;2009 shows some 24.6 million 
more Americans with asthma.</p> 
<p>This included the following rises,</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Non-Hispanic black children (11.4% to 17.0%)</li> 
<li>Non-Hispanic white women (8.9% to 10.1%)</li> 
<li>Non-Hispanic black men (4.7% to 6.4%</li> </ul> 
<h3>Why asthma is rising epidemically</h3> 
<p>It is simply because our air is getting dirtier, filthier.</p> 
<p>We have too many smoke stacks, vehicles and factories emitting toxic fumes. 
This effects the fragile lungs of children especially.</p> 
<h3>Protecting corporate profits over our health</h3> 
<p>It should shock us then that President Barack Obama last month asked the 
EPA to postpone changes to the Clean Air  Act meant to protected Americans from 
the toxic fumes. The Republicans, of course, hailed this step because it would 
reportedly save $90 billion over time and save so many jobs. &nbsp; They 
don&rsquo;t calculate the damage of ill health in dollars and cents or the cost 
of installing anti-pollution equipment and the like.</p> 
<h3>What the Clean Air Act changes would have done</h3> 
<p>They would have included the first-ever carbon pollution standards for cars 
and trucks in the four-decade-old law .</p> 
<p>The U.S. is lagging the world with these laws; even very many developing 
nations have such standards.&nbsp; The difference in concerns is over corporate 
profits verses the health and well-being of all the rest of us.</p> 
<p>League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski said in a statement: 
&ldquo;The Obama administration is caving to big polluters at the expense of 
protecting the air we breathe. This is a huge win for corporate polluters and 
huge loss for public health.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>More CDC data on asthma and the disenfranchised</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Asthma among children (persons aged &lt;18 years) was 9.6%</li> 
<li>It was highest among poor children (13.5%) and among non-Hispanic black 
children (17.0%).</li> 
<li>Prevalence among adults was 7.7%, and was greatest in women (9.7%) and in 
adults who were poor (10.6%).</li> 
<li>More uninsured persons with asthma were reported than insured who could 
afford medications (40.3% versus 11.5%)</li> </ul> <strong><em>Based on an 
article by</em><em>Marsha Coleman-Adebayo&nbsp;</em></strong> <em></em> <br>
 
Marsha Coleman-Adebayo is an environmental consultant who when working for the 
Environmental Protection Agency as a senior executive discovered dangerous 
mining conditions in South Africa conducted by a U.S. multinational. When she 
raised the issue she found that she was effectively told to shut up. She 
refused to. Her persistence saw her isolated and harassed by the EPA. She 
finally brought an action against them and was awarded the largest federal 
payout yet, and her efforts led to the first whistleblowing legislation of the 
21st century, the No FEAR Whistleblowing Act. She continues to lobby for those 
who see wrongs to speak out.

<h1>Newborns addicted</h1> 
<h1>on drugs at birth</h1> 
<h1>- a new epidemic</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Medical authorities are witnessing the 
explosive growth in the number of newborns hooked on prescription painkillers 
&ndash; innocent victims of their mothers&rsquo; prescription drug addictions.
</p> 
<h3>Fastest Growing Drug Problem in US</h3> 
<p>Last month, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi asked the state Legislature 
to establish a task force to compile data on drug-exposed babies and develop 
prevention strategies. The trend reflects an abuse of powerful narcotics, such 
as<strong>OxyContin and Vicodin</strong>. Prescription drug abuse is the 
nation&rsquo;s<strong>fastest-growing drug problem</strong>, classified as an 
epidemic by CDC or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared to death this will become the crack-baby 
epidemic,&rdquo; says<strong>Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi</strong>. Last 
month, she asked the state Legislature to establish a task force to compile 
data on drug-exposed babies and develop prevention strategies.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h3>VIDEO: Born addicted: Rising epidemic in Fla</h3> </li> </ul> 
<h3>Statistics</h3> 
<p>National statistics on the number of babies who go through withdrawal are 
not available, and states with the worst problems have only begun to collect 
data. Scattered reports show the count of addicted newborns has doubled, 
tripled or more over the past decade. In Florida, the epicenter of the illicit 
prescription trade, the number of babies with withdrawal syndrome soared from 
354 in 2006 to 1,374 in 2010, according to the Florida Agency forHealth Care 
Administration. In response to the growing severity of the problem, the 
American Academy of Pediatricsconvened a committee this year to revise its 
treatment guidelines for the babies. The new guidelines are set to be published 
next year.</p> 
<h3>Escalation of number of children addicted at birth</h3> 
<p>Mark Hudak, who served on the committee, says the problem is not confined 
to Florida. The number of drug-exposed babies &ldquo;has escalated across the 
country,&rdquo; says Hudak, a professor of pediatrics and division chief for 
neonatology at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville.
</p> 
<p>Examples:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>OREGON</strong> &ndash; Maine Medical Center in Portland treated 
121 babies dependent on prescription painkillers in 2010, up from 18 in 2001
</li> 
<li>&nbsp;<strong>TENESSEE</strong> &ndash; East Tennessee Children&rsquo;s 
Hospital in Knoxville adopted a program to treat drug-exposed babies a year 
ago. Of the 579 babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit since then, 
106 needed treatment for<strong>withdrawal from</strong> <strong>oxycodone
</strong> and other painkillers &mdash; up from fewer than 40 in 2008. In 
September, painkiller-addicted babies filled nearly half the neonatal intensive 
care unit&rsquo;s 60 beds, the highest number ever.&rdquo;It has just 
exploded,&rdquo; says John Buchheit, director of neonatology at East Tennessee 
Children&rsquo;s Hospital. &ldquo;Narcotic use is just rampant in our society, 
and our area is particularly bad. The babies are caught in the middle.&rdquo;
</li> 
<li><strong>&nbsp;WEST COAST FLORIDA</strong> &ndash; At St. Joseph&rsquo;s 
Hospital in Tampa, 40 babies born in the first nine months of this year needed 
special care because of painkiller exposure &mdash; a 33% increase over all of 
2010, says Ken Solomon, director of neonatology at three hospitals in the 
Tampa-St. Petersburg area.</li> </ul> 
<p>Bondi first learned of the babies&rsquo; plight on a visit to St. 
Joseph&rsquo;s. She says seeing the infants writhe in pain as they withdrew 
from the drugs broke her heart. &ldquo;I had no idea there was this epidemic 
out there,&rdquo; she says.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Neonatal drug w<strong>ithdrawal syndrome</strong></h3> 
<p>After exposure to months of drugs in the womb, babies experience withdrawal 
a few days after birth. They scream, twitch and vomit. They have trouble 
breathing and eating. They rub their noses with their fists so frantically that 
their skin bleeds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the newborn equivalent of an adult who 
goes off the drugs cold turkey. It&rsquo;s really horrible to see these kids. 
They look in so much pain,&rdquo; says Lewis Rubin, director of newborn 
services atTampa General Hospital and chairman of neonatology at the University 
of South Florida.</p> 
<h3>Allopathic treatment</h3> 
<p>To ease their pain and get the babies comfortable enough so they can eat 
and sleep, allopathic doctors, in their ideological ignorance and denial, give 
these babies yet more chemical narcotics and sedatives, which can include
<strong>morphine, methadone and phenobarbital</strong>. &ldquo;We have to 
readdict them,&rdquo; says Solomon, who uses intravenous morphine measured in 
micrograms. &ldquo;Over a period of time, we withdraw the medicines. Sometimes 
it will take weeks.&rdquo; Health professionals have dealt with addicted 
mothers and drug-exposed babies for decades. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in nursing 
for 26 years. There&rsquo;s been a problem with some drug or another for that 
entire time,&rdquo; Tamborelli says.</p> 
<h3>Historical background of growing crisis</h3> 
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, heroin emerged as a problem. That is when 
neonatologist Loretta Finnegan, who has studied substance abuse, developed a 
scoring system of symptoms to diagnose<strong>neonatal abstinance syndrome
</strong> or <strong>drug withdrawal in the infants</strong>. By the 1980s, the 
problem had shifted to<strong> cocaine and crack</strong>. In the past five to 
10 years, doctors say they have treated growing numbers of babies hooked on
<strong>prescription opioid painkillers</strong>. While abuse of many street 
drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, is declining, painkiller abuse is 
growing. About 7 million people abuse prescription drugs, including 
painkillers, according to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. 
Deaths from<strong>prescription painkiller overdoses have more than tripled in 
the past decade</strong>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.
</p> 
<h3>Misperception that prescription drugs are not harmful</h3> 
<p>&ldquo;The epidemic of drug-addicted newborns really follows exactly from 
the spread of the pill mills, the ability to buy prescription drugs like 
OxyContin on the street, to get them on the Internet,&rdquo; Rubin says. 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s staggering to think of the financial, emotional and social 
costs of this problem.&rdquo; Expectant mothers hide their addictions because 
they fear government social workers will take the child. Also a pregnant woman 
can&rsquo;t quit cold turkey because as she goes into withdrawal, the baby 
will, too says Mary Newport, medical director of neonatal intensive care at 
Spring Hill Regional Hospital in Spring Hill, Fla. &ldquo;The baby could have 
seizures in the womb. They can miscarry,&rdquo; she says.<strong> One in 20 
babies born in the semirural community north of Tampa is addicted to 
painkillers, Newport says.</strong> The number of babies treated in the 
neonatal intensive care unit for withdrawal from prescription painkillers has 
more than doubled from 37 in 2008 to 88 in 2010.<strong>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a 
misconception that because these are prescription drugs, they aren&rsquo;t 
going to be harmful to the baby,&rdquo; she says.</strong>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t 
go to medical school to become a pain management doctor for a newborn. 
It&rsquo;s been thrust upon us. We feel very, very sorry for the babies, and 
it&rsquo;s very, very difficult for us to understand why these young women 
think it&rsquo;s OK. Most are addicted before they get pregnant.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Wildfire drug epidemic</h3> 
<p>The number of pregnant women with addictions to narcotic painkillers has 
grown so rapidly that Mercy Hospital Recovery Center in Portland, Maine, 
developed a specialized treatment program for them, says Mark Publicker, an 
addiction medicine specialist at Mercy. The moms-to-be spend a month in a 
six-hours-a-day program before stepping down to three hours daily, Publicker 
says. About half the babies born don&rsquo;t have any withdrawal, he says. The 
other half have mild withdrawal. &ldquo;The experience of<strong>opiate 
withdrawal</strong> is the most painful and most difficult of any withdrawal 
syndrome,&rdquo; Publicker says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell. It&rsquo;s physical, 
emotional and spiritual hell.&rdquo; At Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, 
doctors screen every pregnant woman for opiate abuse. &ldquo;We feel that the 
incidence is high enough that it&rsquo;s a reasonable screening test,&rdquo; 
says Jay Hagerty, a neonatologist at Eastern Maine Medical Center. In the 
Tampa-St. Petersburg area, doctors and nurses are trained to look for signs of 
addiction in pregnant women, such as problems controlling pain with normal 
doses of medicine. Much of the prognosis for babies exposed to prescription 
painkillers is drawn from long experience with children exposed to heroin, an 
opiate that has many of the same characteristics as the narcotic painkillers. 
Most of those children, over time, catch up to their peers, although some have 
developed learning difficulties and attention deficit problems, among other 
mental problems. Few long-term studies have followed children exposed to the 
prescription painkillers. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know as much as we need to 
know,&rdquo; Solomon says. &ldquo;What also confounds it is the home situation. 
We don&rsquo;t know what happens when they leave the hospital.&rdquo;<strong>

<h2>Orphan drugs and therapies &ndash; failings of modern medicine</h2>

<h1>Orphan Drugs</h1> 
<h1>and Therapies:</h1> 
<h1>&nbsp;Failings of</h1> 
<h1>Modern Medicine</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> The average consumer has a wildly<strong> 
idealized image of the modern MD</strong>, especially when wearing a pure white 
coat draped with a stethoscope &ndash; an image molded by media, as a caring, 
careful scientist &ndash; and best tending to the urgent needs of his or her 
patients. There is little talk about the routinely prescribed toxic drugs that 
just manage disease, fail to heal, and often maim and kill as a supposedly 
minor &ldquo;side-effects.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3><strong>Modern medicine controlled by commercial interests</strong></h3> 
<p>In reality, <strong>modern medicine is shaped lock-stock-and-barrel by 
commercial interests</strong>. MDs are educated to become the primary front men 
and women for Big Pharma, indoctrinated into its ideologies, and ever silenced 
as to what goes on behind the scenes.&nbsp; If an extremely rare doctor tells 
all or stands out to become a whistle blower, he or she is soon threatened in a 
deliberate way by<strong>peer pressure</strong> (euphemistically called 
&ldquo;peer review as if it was just something only healthy) or the underlying 
medical license is simply pulled. Almost nothing passes as accepted 
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; medical practice unless it first goes through the 
filter of being minimally profitability. Green dollars are accepted therapy 
determinators and sometimes patient terminators!</p> 
<h3>Orphan Drugs and Therapies</h3> 
<p>This is most clearly evident with the phenomenon of &ldquo;<strong>orphan 
therapies&rdquo; &ndash; approaches that are effective</strong><strong> natural 
therapies</strong> but treated in a manner similar to orphan drugs.</p> 
<h3><strong> Story of Dr. Joel Furhman</strong></h3> 
<p>Recently a prominent natural physician, Dr. Joel Fuhrman, was asked to 
write an article for the American Diabetes Association publication on his 
phenomenal natural, nutritional approach to reversing (not life-time profitably 
managing) diabetes. He submitted the article only to be told that they 
couldn&rsquo;t publish anything like that unless it was significantly toned it 
down. The article spoke about reversing diabetes so that patients were entirely 
taken off of insulin. Yet entirely taken off, not reducing the insulin. Why 
couldn&rsquo;t they published that to help millions, if not billions of 
sufferors? Because the lead funder of the diabetes publication was also a chief 
producer of insulin, Eli Lily.&nbsp; Dr Furhrman, not be corrupted, withdrew 
the article and found other venues to bring out his message. The second video 
tells the story.</p> 
<p>For those who wake up to what is really happening in modern medicine, so it 
goes routinely.</p>

<h2>Secrets To Sleeping Soundly</h2>

<h1>Secrets To Sleeping</h1> 
<h1>Soundly</h1> 
<p><strong><strong></strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, 
Healingtalks Editor<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> The overall environment of sound, lighting, 
electro-magnetic waves and other subtle influences really affects<strong>how 
soundly we sleep</strong>.</p> 
<p>Here is a summary of some of these important deep sleep influences:</p> 
<h3>Environment Promoting Melatonin</h3> 
<p>Melatonin is a hormone that is produced at night by the pineal gland. 
Through research it is believed that adequate melatonin production is linked to 
our<strong>ability to deeply sleep</strong>. It is also heavily linked to other 
things, including inhibition of tumor growth, protection from cancer and a 
generally strong immune function.<strong>Melatonin production</strong> is 
stimulated by the dark and inhibited by the light, and also by sleeping within 
electromagnetic fields. To get a good night&rsquo;s sleep it is thus very 
important to sleep in an environment that promotes melatonin production, and as 
follows:</p> 
<h3>Lighting and deep sleep</h3> 
<p>Obviously sleeping in a darkened room will help deep sleep. How dark ?</p> 
<p>Do you sleep with the light on? Does the light from the hall spill into 
your bedroom? Does the TV flicker? Are your curtains or blinds blocking out the 
light from the neighbors, and the lamps and neon signs from the street? See how 
else you can make your bedroom even darker than it is</p> 
<h3>Electricity and deep sleep</h3> 
<p><strong>Electricity can suppress melatonin production</strong>.</p> 
<p>Electricity produces electromagnetic radiation, or electromagnetic fields 
(EMFs), which are made up of two separate parts: the electric field, and the 
magnetic field.<strong>Fifteen research studies</strong> have shown that 
magnetic fields inhibit, reduce or suppress melatonin production. For some 
people, sleeping within a magnetic field will also disrupt their sleep. The 
stronger and larger a field, the more likely it is to disrupt the quality of 
sleep, and the more people it is likely to affect.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Smaller EMFs</strong>&nbsp; Strong magnetic fields are usually 
found<strong>around the fuse box, or electricity meter</strong>. If 
you&rsquo;re not sleeping well, the very first thing to do is to check where 
this is. Is it anywhere near your bed? People often unknowingly sleep with 
their bedhead, or their child&rsquo;s bed, backing onto the meter box. This is 
not only associated with insomnia, but also with weakened immune systems, which 
can lead to a variety of health issues. Often something as simple as moving the 
bed to the other side of the room has been known to dramatically alleviate 
sleeping problems.</li> </ul> 
<p>I once consulted for someone who hadn&rsquo;t slept properly for over two 
years. She averaged no more than a few hours each night, and had simply got 
used to feeling exhausted all the time. I found out that her bed backed onto 
the junction box, and suggested she move her bed. She decided to try sleeping 
in the spare room to see if it made a difference. From the very first night she 
started sleeping right through, and now has a completely different quality of 
life. The remedy was simple, effective, immediate and cost nothing!</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Larger EMFs</strong> &ndash; Learn to look three-dimensionally 
&ndash; and think about what&rsquo;s behind and under your bed. A junction box, 
a computer, TV, fridge, microwave&hellip;anything that emits an electromagnetic 
field around your bed may be disrupting your sleep.<strong>Large EMFs</strong> 
can also come from an external source, such as<strong>nearby electrical 
transmission lines, transformers or substations</strong>. Sometimes large EMFs 
within the house can be caused by a fault or anomaly in the wiring system.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Electrical appliances and sleep</h3> 
<p>Try to remove as many electrical appliances from your bedroom as possible, 
and make sure that those you do have are at<strong>least a meter or three feet 
away from your pillow</strong>. Magnetic fields from electric appliances reduce 
as soon as the appliance is switched off. The electric field remains even when 
you have turned off the appliance switch. To reduce this field you need to turn 
the appliance off at the plug (or take the plug out if there is no plug switch).
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Be aware also that most<strong> mattresses contain metal springs</strong>, 
and that the metal in these springs can conduct electricity &ndash; another 
important reason to keep electric fields away from your bed.</li> 
<li>Some water beds have electrical heaters attached and these should be 
turned off.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Bedroom electric space heaters are not advisable.</li> 
<li>Low halogen lights and digital clock radios should be watched, as these 
both contain transformers and often give off very large and powerful fields. 
Lamps with ordinary, incandescent light bulbs, and battery alarms are far 
better for your health.</li> 
<li>Electric blankets can emit enormous fields, and continue to emit electric 
fields that keep your whole system buzzing all night unless they&rsquo;re 
switched off at the plug. If you want to keep warm in bed, either use a hot 
water bottle, or snuggle up to someone instead.</li> 
<li>Cordless phones and phone rechargers can also emit large fields. Both are 
better placed well on the other side of the room, or in the next room, as are 
TVs, DVD players, or music systems.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Microwave radiation affecting sleep</h3> 
<p>Mobile phones, &lsquo;wireless&rsquo; technology, DECT cordless phones and 
digital baby monitors &ndash; just like your microwave oven &ndash;<strong>emit 
microwave radiation.</strong> Microwave radiation is increasingly intruding 
into our lives, and the more appliances we buy that use this form of energy, 
the more we invite it inside our own homes. And, once there, it is often 
operating 24/7. This is increasingly being linked with disruption in sleep 
patterns (in addition to other health issues such as impaired brain function 
and energy metabolism, fatigue and depression). Reducing your usage of this 
technology may well help to increase your quality of sleep.</p> 
<p>This is relatively new technology, and as such we still are not aware of 
all of the health effects. However, a recent Australian study has firmly<strong>
 linked the use of mobile phones</strong> before going to bed with sleep 
disruption: it appears it stimulates brain activity in the early stages of 
sleep, and also reduces level of melatonin. This research also indicated there 
may be certain people who are particularly susceptible to the effects of mobile 
phone radiation.</p> 
<p>All electromagnetic and microwave radiation is invisible stress &ndash; 
however, a variety of meters do exist which can measure their effect, and so 
make visible this invisible world. If you suspect you may have EMFs or 
microwave radiation in your house, and you&rsquo;ve eliminated all the simple 
causes, it may be best to consult with someone who is experienced in this 
field. They can help you to detect any fields and their source, and then to 
find a solution.</p> 
<h3>Geopathic stress impacting sleep</h3> 
<p>This is an area which is not widely discussed in our society. Ancient 
cultures and indigenous communities are well aware of the impact of the 
Earth&rsquo;s natural electromagnetic radiation, and also of the areas in which 
this becomes disrupted. These areas of disruption are often referred to as 
areas of geopathic stress, or geopathic zones.</p> 
<p>Studies have been done on many indigenous and ancient sites, and have found 
not one built over a geopathic zone. However, in Westernised societies, most of 
us have lost touch with this knowledge, and so are not aware of the best areas 
in which to make resting places, and those to avoid.</p> 
<p>The people who work with geopathic stress are well aware of its effect on 
our general health. Some research studies carried out overseas link it strongly 
to specific health issues &ndash; including disrupted sleep, behavioral issues, 
lowered immune function, and cancer.</p> 
<p>You can engage a professional dowser or intuitive to guage geopathic stress.
</p> 
<p>There is another way to gain insight as to whether geopathic stress may be 
affecting our houses. Nature gives us many clues. If you have any rooms that: 
feel cold and uninviting (in both temperature and &lsquo;feel&rsquo;), no-one 
really wants to go into; are for no apparent reason full of damp and 
susceptible to mould; it may be possible that they are built over areas of 
geopathic stress. It then becomes necessary to move a bed or even one&rsquo;s 
bedroom.</p> 
<p>Cats, by the way, may love these areas; dogs may avoid them. Termites, 
wasps and ants might also love GS. Plants often won&rsquo;t grow or are 
distorted. So, watch for such clues. In our scientific high-tech age, such 
topics as geopathic stress and old-fashioned dowsing are looked down upon as 
superstitious. But for some people it works.&nbsp; If you think your bedroom 
may be over a geopathic stress zone, try to find someone locally who works in 
this field, and can dowse for you &ndash; or learn to dowse yourself. Many 
states have a local Dowser&rsquo;s Society who can put you in contact with a 
dowser, and many run training courses as well.</p> 
<h3>Chemicals and sleep</h3> 
<p>Since the middle of the 20th century we have been subject to a vast 
marketing campaign about &ldquo;better living through chemistry.&rdquo; 
Chemicals essentially are designed mathematically, so what could be wrong with 
that? Mathematics is a set of symbols for the<strong><em> universal</em>
</strong> separation of all elements of consciousness, beginning with 1,2,3. 
This universal symbolism, when universally applied, impacts potentially 
everything in our environment, including our bedrooms. One cannot, however, 
deeply connect a vision or environment of nature using the most powerful 
of&nbsp; all symbols for consciousness separation.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is much 
more about this in other articles in Healingtalks.com and Raw-wisdom.com.</p> 
<p>On a deep level, we end up very negatively or ill-affecting/polluting the 
depth connectivity that is the foundation of life and healing, and to which we
<strong>connect most powerfully during sleep</strong>.</p> 
<p>Among the sources of chemicals in bedding, curtains, decorations, 
furniture, walls and floors, cleaning and deodorizing agents to become aware 
of, including the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Particleboard or MDF</li> 
<li>Carpeting and underlay</li> 
<li>Foam and fabrics in furniture</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Pesticides</li> 
<li>Adhesives</li> 
<li>Varnishes and paint</li> 
<li>Material dyes and finishing products</li> 
<li>Fabric pre-stainer and softeners</li> 
<li>Easy-iron&rsquo; or &lsquo;crease-free&rsquo; fabrics</li> 
<li>Disinfectants and air fresheners</li> 
<li>Preservatives in wood and wallpaper</li> 
<li>Personal care products, cleansers and cosmetics (among others).</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Air quality</strong> &ndash; If you have just had your bedroom 
decorated, you can help the fumes to escape, and prevent their accumulation, by 
opening the windows and ventilating the room. Make sure you do this for some 
time each and every day, particularly just before you go to bed. Ideally, leave 
your bedroom window open so that you&rsquo;re sleeping with a constant supply 
of fresh air. You can purchase an air filter and run it on a timer during the 
day.</p> 
<p><strong>More considerations</strong> &ndash; Be especially aware of this 
when decorating a bedroom for a new baby or child, as they are much more 
sensitive and vulnerable. Try to decorate the room as far in advance as you 
can, so that any fumes have time to diminish. Use non-toxic or bio-friendly 
paints, and furnish it with products made from natural materials. If you have 
any furniture made of MDF, then seal it using a non-toxic sealer. When it next 
comes time to buying bedding, consider bed linen made from organic cotton, 
which has been grown without chemicals, or not treated with formaldehyde in the 
manufacturing process. For people of all ages, easy-care sheets may definitely 
not be leading to easy sleep.</p> 
<p>More than eliminating negatives &ndash; Besides eliminating all that can 
hamper sleep, you can also add things to your bedroom that positively impacts 
sleeping &ndash; such as soothing blue colors, and meditative and relaxing 
images, saying and pictures. Consider a meditation sound machine or noise 
machine plugged in at a distance that simulates the soothing sound of a 
waterfall, rain sound, meditative healing music, or offers other soothing, 
ambient or &ldquo;white&rdquo; sounds. Keeping a bedroom on the relatively cool 
side also helps, but not too cold.</p> 
<p>Exercise some time during the day, unwind at night from the day&rsquo;s 
cares, relax and unload worries and eat and drink lightly (or not at all just 
before sleep), perhaps with a relaxing herbal tea.</p> 
<h3>Summary</h3> 
<p>To&nbsp; summarize:&nbsp; To get a good night&rsquo;s sleep, become more 
and more conscious of your total bedroom environment&nbsp; Sleep is one of our 
most precious resources. If you get enough beautiful, restful sleep you are 
more likely to have enough vitality to bounce forward into life with a spring 
in your step. You&rsquo;ll look and feel wonderful. Take the time to learn 
about your home, particularly your bedroom. Look after it, and it will look 
after you.</p>

<p>Consciousness &amp; Healing, HEALING US, Meditation, Overweight Or Obese</p>
<h2>Yoga and Meditation for Weightloss</h2> 
<p>No Comments 06 November 2011</p> 
<h1><strong></strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>Yoga and Meditation </strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>for Weight Loss</strong></h1> 
<p>By Contributing Writer:<strong><em>&nbsp; Jenn Pedde </em></strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Recently a<strong> report by The Trust for 
American Health</strong> confirmed that<strong> obesity in the United States is 
at epidemic levels</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>38 states have obesity rates over 25 
percent</strong>. In 15 years, seven states have actually doubled their rate of 
obesity, and related to this, ten states their rate of diabetes.&nbsp; 
Americans are thus considering innovative ways to achieve weight loss (beyond 
dieting or simply watching calories and hitting the gym). Among those 
alternatives are ways of aligning your physical fitness and inner well being.
</p> 
<h2><strong>Yoga</strong></h2> 
<p>Increasingly, yoga is being wholesale adopted by Americans. In gyms, at 
parks and at home, more and more people across the Untied States have begun to 
practice the ancient Indian exercise. Through a system of different postures 
and controlled breathing, yoga is meant to promote heath and relaxation. 
Through this achieved relaxation, practitioners are able to better &ldquo;get 
in touch&rdquo; or be conscious of and understand their bodies, allowing them 
to make more informed, on target decisions regarding their health, diet and 
lifestyle. Additionally,<strong>yoga practitioners looking to for weight loss
</strong> may try &ldquo;<strong>power yoga</strong>&rdquo; with an emphasis on 
more vigorous postures and a quicker pace. This provides a greater workout than 
traditional yoga.</p> 
<p>Although sometimes put down as &ldquo;new age nonsense&rdquo; by skeptics, 
ancient yoga has shown success in helping practitioners lose weight. This is 
confirmed by a 2005&nbsp;<strong>survey</strong> of over 15,500 participants 
where those who practiced yoga lost 5 pounds on average, while those who did 
not gained as much as 14 pounds.</p> 
<h2><strong>Meditation</strong></h2> 
<p>Meditation is the art of creating self-inducing states of consciousness. 
This shift in our inner mentality is achieved through a variety of means, 
including deep contemplation, concentrated breathing, prolonged silence and 
chanting. In this way, individuals attain states of relaxation, heightened 
awareness or the means to reinforce any dedication to inner aims.</p> 
<p>Meditation may also involve periods of silence, stillness or gentle moving. 
But this seems the opposite of very vigorous physical exercise meant to burn 
calories. Meditation is usually only thought of in connection with things like 
coping with stress, depression and anxiety. However, the clarity of mind that 
comes with meditations can also help us identify exactly which physical 
problems&nbsp; need addressing &ndash; as well as to&nbsp; gather the will, 
knowledge and means to overcome our challenges &ndash; including increasing 
overweight and obesity.</p> 
<h2><strong>For our modern times</strong></h2> 
<p>Stemming from ancient traditions, yoga and meditations may be reapplied to 
our modern times to help overcome the obesity epidemic. How?&nbsp; By promoting 
deep relaxation and clearer inner consciousness, yoga and meditations can 
assist us in making both clearer and stronger inner commitments to weight loss 
and steadfast nutrition choices.</p>

<h1>Number of American</h1> 
<h1>Overweight and Obese</h1> 
<h1>Swells</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> So many more <strong>Americans are becoming 
overweight or obese</strong><strong>. They are exercising less and eating 
unhealthy foods</strong>. That&rsquo;s the latest finding of the <strong>
Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index</strong>. It reveals that 63.1% of adults in 
the U.S. were either overweight or obese in 2009.</p> 
<p>This reflects about a 1% increase from 62.2% the year before. Overall 36.6% 
of Americans were found to be overweight and 26.5% obese.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index</strong> findings are based 
on telephone interviews conducted with 673,000 adults between 2008 and 2009.</p>
<h2>What the obesity survey found &hellip;.. those who are overweight or obese 
will:</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Exercise less</strong> -</li> 
<li><strong>Eat less fresh fruits and veggies</strong></li> 
<li><strong>View their Meals Less Positively </strong></li> </ul> 
<h2>Exercising less</h2> 
<p>Compared to 73.8% normal weight and 69.9% overweight individuals, 59.2% of 
obese Americans exercised 1&nbsp; or more days per week,</p> 
<h2>Eat less fruits and vegetables</h2> 
<p>Obese people are least&nbsp; likely to eat 5 servings of fruits and 
vegetables, 3-7 days a week. Weight group stats of those who ate 5 servings or 
more offruits and vegetables at least 3x a week</p> 
<ul> 
<li>71.6%&nbsp; normal</li> 
<li>69%&nbsp; underweight</li> 
<li>68.9%&nbsp; overweight</li> 
<li>67.2% obese</li> </ul> 
<h2>Obesity Study&rsquo;s disease-related findings</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>High blood pressure</strong>, 46.2% were obese, 31.1% were 
overweight, 19.3% were of normal weight, and 17.2% underweight.</li> 
<li><strong>High cholesterol</strong>, 36.8% were obese, 30.1% overweight, 
19.2% normal weight, and 14.1% underweight.</li> 
<li><strong>Diabetes</strong>, 21.1% were obese, 9.8% overweight, 5% normal 
weight, and 4.2% underweight.</li> 
<li><strong>Heart attacks</strong>, 6.3% were obese, 4.8% overweight, 3.3% 
normal weight, and 4.4% underweight.</li> 
<li><strong>Depression</strong>, 23.3% were obese, 15.3% overweight, 15% 
normal weight, and 20% underweight.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Obesity study&rsquo;s ethnic findings</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>African-Americans</strong> were among the most likely to be obese, 
with 36.2%,</li> 
<li><strong>Hispanics</strong>, with 28.3%</li> 
<li><strong>Asians</strong> are far less likely to be obese, with 9.6%</li> 
<li><strong>Average America</strong>n, with 26.5%.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Obesity study&rsquo;s age/sex findings</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>18.3% of<strong> young Americans</strong> are obese</li> 
<li>27.6% between ages<strong> 30-44</strong></li> 
<li>30.6% among <strong>45- to 64</strong>-year-olds.</li> 
<li>24.2% among&nbsp; <strong>65</strong> and over</li> 
<li>Men are more likely than women to be obese, <strong>27.8% compared to 
25.2%.</strong></li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Ultimately the survey shows that obesity is still on the rise.

<h2>Defining Normal, Overweight and Obese</h2> 
<p>Body mass index (BMI) is a common measure of body fat based on height and 
weight. (Calculate your body mass index atwww.webmd.com/diet/calc-bmi-plus.) A 
BMI of 30 or greater is considered obese, overweight if it&rsquo;s between 
25-29.9, normal if it&rsquo;s 18.5-24.9, and underweight if it&rsquo;s less 
than 18.5.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t Join Our Zombie Nation &ndash; Avoid being among 11 percent of 
Americans who take antidepressant drugs daily</h2>

<h1>Don&rsquo;t Join Our</h1> 
<h1>Zombie Nation</h1> 
<h2>Avoid being among 11 percent of Americans who take antidepressant drugs 
daily</h2> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> The admitted goal of the pharmaceutical 
industry is to have every man, woman and child in America taking at least two 
prescription drugs daily for the rest of their lives (whether sick or not)!</p> 
<p>Through Big Pharma&rsquo;s corruption of the establishment &ndash; 
including the FDA, medical journals, med schools and the mainstream media, it 
creeps closer to accomplishing this diabolical goal. Already one in ten 
Americans are now on<strong>SSRI antidepressant drugs</strong>.&nbsp; The 
initials stand for<strong>selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors</strong>. 
Kids are included in these horrid statistics. Roughly 25% of Americans are said 
to suffer from some &ldquo;inner,&rdquo; mental or spiritual illness. More than 
half have chronic physical ills that are also being treated by drugs that 
mostly suppress the consciousness of symptoms and don&rsquo;t address causes. 
There is another and more sane way to go for the method of treating ills via 
drugs, whose sales are driven by the lust for profit, is itself socially ill 
&ndash; as a<strong>symptom of our &ldquo;zombie nation.&rdquo;</strong> Go 
visit any nursing home that has individuals treated with multiple drugs. You 
will see they<strong>walk the halls like zombies</strong>.</p> 
<p>Do you want to join them for a Halloween party or do something better with 
your life?</p> 
<p>By the way, the one out of ten figure for SSRI drugs&nbsp; is according to 
a survey conducted by the CDC. It was further revealed that use of 
antidepressants<strong>jumped 400% from 2005 &ndash; 2008</strong>, while <em>
women</em> are 2.5 times more likely to use antidepressants than <em>men</em>. 
(And whites are far more likely to use them than blacks.) (
http://www.reuters.com/article/2011&hellip;)</p> 
<p>The <strong>dangerous &ldquo;side effects&rdquo;</strong> (which are really
<strong> main drug effects</strong> ) are legion. It is vital thus to get off 
these medications.</p> 
<h2><strong>How to get off SSRI meds </strong><strong></strong></h2> 
<p>First, realize that depression is not caused by a &ldquo;chemical imbalance 
in the brain&rdquo; that can be resolved by paying monopoly prices for a 
patented chemicals sold by a pharmacy. &nbsp;&rdquo;Depression&rdquo; is a 
warning sign that multiple areas of one&rsquo;s life are out of balance and 
need to be brought back. Here are<strong>seven</strong> <strong>strategies for 
reversing depression</strong>:</p> 
<h2><strong>Connect with nature</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Sunlight exposure</strong> beats back depression at the hormonal 
level.</li> 
<li><strong>Breathing fresh</strong> <strong>air</strong> that&rsquo;s filled 
with negative ions from trees and plants prevents depression at a<em>bioelectric
</em> level.</li> 
<li><strong>Touching the earth</strong> with your bare hands, <strong><em>
hearing</em> the sounds of nature</strong>, <em>feeling</em> the bark of a tree 
or even just<strong><em>seeing</em> lush green foliage</strong> is all <strong>
vibrational, sensory medicine</strong>.If you look at most people who are 
depressed, they often live inside amid sterile surroundings. They never run 
barefoot. They are depressed being<em>disconnected from the natural, living 
surroundings.</em></li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Get exercise</strong></h2> 
<p>This allows your brain to manufacture its own antidepressant drugs for free 
without a prescription. A treadmill run might save you $20 worth of drugs! And 
your body&rsquo;s own brain drugs are<em>better</em>. Their biochemistry has 
<em>no side effects</em>. You simply feel good.</p> 
<h2><strong>Improve nutrition</strong></h2> 
<p>Most depressed people <em>are</em> eating mucho refined sugar, flour, 
pasteurized dairy and other life-depressing, devitalizing or junk foods. No 
wonder they feel as blue as blue cheese! Thus eat the highest quality foods 
instead.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Eat more omega-3 oils</strong> from dietary supplements, 
wild-caught salmon, flax seeds, chia seeds and other such sources.</li> 
<li><strong>Juice and consume lots of</strong> <strong>fresh, whole, and 
organic produce.</strong> They contain trace minerals that drastically improve 
cognitive function and moods.</li> 
<li><strong>Eat more <em>living</em> foods</strong>. They make you feel great 
and alive because they are alive and build living cells! Primarily dead foods 
build dead, and depressed cells that then make you feel awful. So get yourself 
a juicer to extract the concentrated life force of your fruits and veggies. Go 
to it.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Find meaning in life</strong></h2> 
<p>Many individuals are depressed due to a thankless job or occupation, 
<strong>Having a purpose in life is enlivening</strong>. Pursuing it with daily 
passion can reverse depression and help turn despair into joy.<br>
<em>Start 
searching for your real purpose in life!</em></p> 
<h2><strong>Improve your personal relationships</strong></h2> 
<p>Some individuals are in abusive and unfulfilling personal relationship. 
Reconsider how and who you intimately relate to in the world, and whether it is 
time for a change that will allow you to reach and support your potentials in 
life.</p> 
<h2><strong>Find ways of being of service</strong></h2> 
<p>Can you teach or lead by example or inspire others to improve their lives? 
Can you help someone in need? As you help others, you help yourself as well 
because we are all connected as One.</p> 
<h2><strong>Meditate and soul-search</strong></h2> 
<p>Have a quiet time in your life for inspiration, reflection, and being at 
one within. From that space of oneness, you can then tackle the challenges of 
your life and become more creative. You find and tap into the driving purpose 
of your life. You&rsquo;ll be so busy pursuing your life&rsquo;s mission and 
purpose you won&rsquo;t have the time or space for any depression.<strong>
</strong></p> 
<h2><strong>Making the transition</strong></h2> 
<p>If you hate nature, love pastries and junk food, and prefer no purpose in 
your life but to vegetate, go for it. Then SSRI drugs are for you. They will 
help you fake happiness and suppress symptoms. With one pill, you can add 
illusion to insult, yo making you &ldquo;feel&rdquo; okay while your life 
inside dies. Getting off SSRI drugs requires courage, not passivity.</p> 
<p>It may be the hardest thing you&rsquo;ve ever done, but it will be 
rewarding Subsisting on mind-altering drugs is no life at all. And the longer 
you take drugs, legal or illegal, the more detached you will feel, making you 
even more isolated and depressed. That&rsquo;s why you need to<strong>get off 
your drugs and meds NOW!</strong> Turn off the TV and take your life back! Get 
off the couch, out of the pharmacy and away from your toxic potions&rsquo; 
prescribing doctor. Get in touch with nature, real foods, and the real you 
inside of yourself. This will<strong>get you back on track</strong> for <strong>
spiritual fulfillment, having meaning in life, for being joyously at One.
</strong></p> 
<p>Who&rsquo;s got time to be depressed when you are fulfilling your highest 
snf best purpose in life?</p>

<h1>Reversing Coronary </h1> 
<h1>Artery Disease: </h1> 
<h2>Results of 5-Year Study </h2> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong><em> </em>Several studies have suggested
<strong> coronary diseas</strong>e could be helped if one maintains a very low 
serum cholesterol level.</p> 
<p><strong>Landmark Coronary Artery Disease Study<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>In 1985, a study set out to show how effective a physician could be in 
helping patients with their<strong>severe coronary artery disease</strong> if 
they maintain such a cholesterol level. The study selected 22 patients with 
documented heart disease that was not immediately life threatening. These 
patients took cholesterol-lowering drugs and followed a<strong> plant-based 
diet with</strong> <strong>no more than 10% of its calories from fat.</strong> 
Disease progression was measured and quantified. Serum cholesterol &nbsp;levels 
were also measured biweekly and for a period of 5 years.</p> 
<p><strong>Study Results: Reversing Coronary Artery Disease&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>Of the 22 participants, 5 dropped out within 2 years, and 17 maintained the 
diet, 11 of whom completed a mean of 5.5 years of follow-up. All 11 of these 
participants reduced their cholesterol level from a mean baseline of 246 mg/dL 
(6.36 mmol/L) to below 150mg/dL (3.88 mmol/L).<strong>Disease was clinically 
arrested in all these 11 participants</strong>, none had new heart attacks. 
Among the 11 remaining patients after 10 years, six continued the diet and had 
no further coronary events, whereas the<strong>five dropouts who resumed their 
pre-study diet reported 10 coronary events.</strong></p> 
<p><em><strong>Study Conclusions</strong></em><strong></strong></p> 
<p>By adopting a very low-fat diet, combined with lipid-lowering drugs, a 
person with severe coronary artery disease can reduce cholesterol levels to 
below150 mg/dL to thereby arrest and/or reversal of coronary artery disease.</p>

<h2>Dramatically Successful Alternative to Failing Heart Disease Therapies</h2>
<p>No Comments 25 October 2011</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<h3><strong></strong><strong>Healingtalks Commentary</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr, MD</strong> has always been an 
inspiration to me. He is a teacher of teachers. He has helped so many reverse 
heart disease &ndash; both directly via treating patients and indirectly by 
teaching thousands if not hundreds of thousands what best to do. His<strong>
pictures of how coronary arteries really can open up</strong> to reserve 
coronary heart disease, and after only a few months exposure to a plant-based 
diet, are a means of powerfully conveying more than countless words are able to.
</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Coronary artery before and after disease reversal accomplished
</strong><br>
<strong>through diet without statins</strong></p> 
<p>There is huge power to the use of a plant-based diet when one moves past 
the propaganda of the meat and dairy industry. Below is the priceless gist of 
Dr. Esselstyn&rsquo;s writings about the number one killer in American, and 
with the title :</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo; Is the present therapy for coronary artery disease the 
&ldquo;radical mastectomy&rdquo; of the twenty-first century?&rdquo;</strong>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;So many smart, right-minded people could get it so wrong, it might 
help to start with a quick review of medical history.<strong></strong></p> 
<h3><strong>&nbsp;Radical Mastectomy&rsquo;s History</strong></h3> 
<p><strong></strong>Take the radical mastectomy, conceived by William Halsted1 
in the late 19th century. The procedure was intended to remove all cancer cells 
of the breast, the overlying skin, the underlying muscle, and regional lymph 
nodes (Figure 1).</p> 
<p>It was mutilating, permanently disfiguring, and no more effective than less 
radical, less disfiguring procedures. Still, because of the prestige and 
respect Halsted commanded as a teacher of surgeons, his disciples defended and 
taught the radical mastectomy at the most revered medical colleges. His extreme 
surgery was perpetuated for almost a century, until challenges by courageous 
physicians in Europe2,3 and America,4 along with a prospective randomized study 
by Dr. Bernard Fisher,5 finally sounded the death knell of this standardized 
surgical error of the century.</p> 
<h3><strong>Radical Mastectomies vs Coronary Artery Disease Treatment</strong>
</h3> 
<p>The 21st century analogue to this unfortunate chapter is the interventional 
and pharmaceutical treatment of coronary artery disease. This approach results 
in significant mortality, morbidity, and unsustainable expense. Neither the 
procedures nor the drugs that accompany them treat the cause. Standard care for 
coronary artery disease is nothing more than palliative. The purveyors of this 
treatment acknowledge that it is but a stop-gap therapy.</p> 
<h3><strong>A Far More Effective Therapy</strong></h3> 
<p>And as in the case of the radical mastectomy, there is a far more 
effective, cost-effective, and sustainable treatment. It&rsquo;s simple:<strong>
advocate a lifestyle of plant-based nutrition, make a bold leap toward a world 
free of heart disease, and lessen our use of scalpels and drugs</strong>.</p> 
<h3><strong>Causal Role of Diet in Coronary Heart Disease</strong></h3> 
<p>There is widespread agreement that the Western diet of <strong>processed 
oils, white flour, dairy, and meat progressively causes endothelial dysfunction 
and injury</strong>, including diminution of nitric oxide, increased vascular 
adhesion molecules, endothelial permeability, low-density lipoprotein 
oxidation, foam cell formation, generation of reactive oxygen species, plaque 
cap thinning, and<br>
 plaque rupture, which lead to clinical events. 
Contributing risk factors include a family history, hypertension, smoking, 
hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Medications 
commonly used for this illness include&nbsp; beta blockers, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, 
statins, anticoagulants, and aspirin.</p> 
<h3><strong>Intervention That Doesn&rsquo;t Treat the Cause</strong></h3> 
<p><strong></strong>The interventions include angioplasty with or without 
bare-metal or drug-coated stents, atherectomy, and coronary artery bypass 
surgery. Exercise may be prescribed and smoking cessation encouraged. Some 
patients may receive nutritional advice from a dietician or nutritional 
therapist, who often lacks knowledge or training in disease prevention and 
reversal. For the minority of heart patients, specifically those in the midst 
of heart attacks or acute coronary syndromes, stents or coronary artery bypass 
may be lifesaving.</p> 
<p>For the res<strong>t, none of the present therapies targets the cause: the 
Western diet</strong>.</p> 
<p>As a consequence, the disease marches on in all patients, which leads to 
more drugs, stents, and bypasses, increasing heart damage, heart failure, and, 
too often, death, from an essentially benign, food-borne illness.<strong>6,7
</strong> This food-borne illness has taken root in the hearts of even the 
&ldquo;healthiest&rdquo; followers of the Western diet, as proved by autopsy 
studies.<strong>8&ndash;10</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Evidence of the Link Between Diet and Disease</strong></h3> 
<p>There is ample evidence linking diet and disease: in plant-based cultures 
such as rural China,11 the Papua highlanders in New Guinea,12 central Africa, 
and the Tarahumara Indians of northern Mexico,13 coronary artery disease is 
virtually nonexistent. Conversely, plant-based cultures that adopt Western, 
animal-based nutrition promptly develop coronary artery disease. The reverse is 
also true. Deaths from heart disease and stroke plummeted from 1939 to 1945, 
during World War II, when the occupying German forces deprived Norwegians of 
their livestock, and rationing resulted in greatly diminished animal-derived 
foods. Within 2 years of the restoration of meat and dairy consumption after 
the cessation of hostilities in 1945,14 death rates from stroke and heart 
attack approached their pre-1939 levels.</p> 
<h3><strong>Dr. Esselstyn&rsquo;s Heart Disease Study</strong></h3> 
<p>In 1985, I initiated a study that treated seriously ill patients with 
coronary artery disease with plant-based nutrition and succeeded in the arrest 
and reversal of their disease. This program has been published at5,15 12,16 
16,17 and most recently summarized at 20 years in my book <strong>Prevent and 
Reverse Heart Disease</strong>,18 making it 1 of the longest investigations of 
its type in medical research. The duration of the study is testimony that 
patients with coronary disease will adhere to these food changes for decades 
and beyond. Patients lose weight, blood pressure normalizes, and type 2 
diabetes improves or resolves, as do angina, erectile dysfunction, and 
peripheral vascular and carotid disease.<strong>Angiographic reversal</strong> 
can be striking (See picture above).</p> 
<p>Even more remarkable is the sense of control patients achieve when it comes 
to containing and reversing their disease. Despite widespread and growing 
awareness of this straightforward, painless, and inexpensive therapy, it is 
infrequently used. Physicians assert that their patients will not follow this 
approach. The hundreds of patients we have treated and our original study 
participants, who switched from a Western diet full of oil, processed foods, 
meat, and dairy to plant-based nutrition, are testimony to the contrary. Why 
have we succeeded where others have failed? Most physicians, who see 20 to 30 
patients per day, have no time, background, or passion for nutritional 
counseling and lack training in behavioral modification. What is more, most 
insurance carriers do not reimburse for counseling. Time is at a premium in the 
physician-patient interaction. At the initial patient visit, a nurse, resident, 
staff physician, or assistant will perform a history and physical. The 
physician will review these findings, order tests, and, at the next encounter, 
share the test results and perhaps prescribe an intervention, and/or drugs, and 
a follow-up program. Often, nutrition is never mentioned. A patient might meet 
with a nutritional therapist to develop a &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; diet, having 
nothing to do with disease arrest and reversal.</p> 
<h3><strong>Dr. Esselstyn&rsquo;s Reversing Heart Disease Naturally</strong>
</h3> 
<p>Our success in counseling patients in how to arrest and reverse heart 
disease is directly related to the time and effort we expend to help them 
understand the connection between diet and disease. We succeed where others may 
fail because of attention to detail. We have evolved a single, intensive, 
5-hour counseling session, which accommodates out-of-state and local patients. 
The first 3.5 hours of counseling include a detailed review of disease 
epidemiology and causation, the endothelial cell and its function, nitric oxide,
<strong>food-borne endothelial injury</strong>, and how to achieve <strong>
endothelial recovery and disease reversal</strong>. In the next hour, we 
discuss which foods to avoid and which to eat, including advice on how to read 
ingredients in nutritional labels and shop for food, how to eat out (at 
friends&rsquo; homes, at restaurants, and on the road), and how to<strong>
prepare a variety of plant-based foods</strong>. During the last 45 minutes, we 
serve a plant-based lunch, exchange ideas, and answer questions. We schedule 
regular follow-up by phone and/or e-mail with all patients. The result: 
patients report that this is the most significant and enduring medical 
encounter they have experienced.<br>
 More importantly, they acquire an 
understanding of what caused their disease and how they can stop and reverse 
it. Contrary to the argument that &ldquo;patients will not do this,&rdquo; we 
find that patients rejoice once they understand their disease and how they may 
halt it. It is condescending to suggest that patients have no interest in 
healing themselves. Is the problem that they will not follow advice, or how the 
advice was offered, if at all? One of my surgical mentors used to say, 
&ldquo;Inappropriate application of the method is no excuse for its 
abandonment.&rdquo; We have found creative nutritional counseling to be highly 
effective. Although busy, physicians must develop an appreciation for 
nutritional counseling&rsquo;s capacity to eradicate disease and can refer 
patients to a variety of specially developed programs, or delegate the 
counseling to members of their teams who have apprenticed in such programs.
<strong></strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Conventional Treatments &ndash; Errors &amp; </strong><strong>
Predictable Failure</strong></h3> 
<p>Present cardiovascular therapy has become a standardized error, as it does 
nothing to prevent disease. The American Heart Association reports mortality 
rates of 1% for stents and 2.5% for coronary bypass surgery.19 Thus, 1% of 1.2 
million<br>
 stents and 2.5% of 500,000 bypass surgeries translate into tens of 
thousands who die and thousands more who are crippled from the ensuing strokes, 
heart attacks, and morbidity.</p> 
<p>None of the drugs or procedures that constitute the lion&rsquo;s share of 
the annual $500 billion expenditure on cardiovascular disease treat the cause 
or halt its progression.20</p> 
<h3><strong>Nutritional Approach To Coronary Heart Disease</strong></h3> 
<p>In contrast to the standard approach, this nutrition-based program is not 
dangerous, there is no mortality or morbidity, and aside from a modest 
counseling expense, it is virtually free, as we all must eat. The benefits of 
stents, bypass surgery, and drugs are transient as disease continues to 
progress, while those of counseling endure and improve with time. In the 
history of our profession, have we ever before developed an expensive, painful, 
nontherapeutic treatment of the leading killer of women and men while failing 
to inform them of the cause of their illness? Sadly, today our adolescents are 
but a decade or 2 away from compounding this epidemic.</p> 
<h3><strong>Time To Tell the Truth About Coronary Heart Disease</strong></h3> 
<p>amily history and genetic background do not cause this illness. It is not 
the luck of the draw. It is a matter of personal action and responsibility. 
Genes load the gun, but lifestyle pulls the trigger. It all starts and stops 
with our endothelium, the guardian and lifejacket of our blood vessels. If we 
destroy our endothelium, we develop the disease. If we restore our endothelium, 
we vanquish our disease.</p> 
<h3><strong>Who Is Not Forthright?<br>
</strong></h3> 
<p>Of course, several mutually reinforcing institutional and commercial 
interests oppose this lifestyle intervention. Every 5 years, the United States 
Department of Agriculture, controlled by agricultural interests, issues a food 
pyramid laden with foods that predispose millions of Americans to perish from 
cardiovascular disease. The pharmaceutical industry takes in billions in 
profits from heart disease, including $21 billion from statin drugs every year.
21 The stent industry makes $5 billion annually.19</p> 
<p>Ten percent of the Medicare budget is spent on stent procedures.22</p> 
<p>With the existing <strong>financial rewards for the medical profession
</strong>, it is difficult to imagine interventional cardiologists clamoring 
for fewer patients. The time is long overdue for legendary work. We can hardly 
be proud of a drug and interventional therapy that results in death, morbidity, 
inordinate expense, and disease progression and can never halt this food-borne 
epidemic.</p> 
<h3><strong>Patient Beware and Best To Know the Alternative</strong></h3> 
<p>Every patient with this disease should be made aware of this safe, simple, 
enduring option to cure himself or herself. Most coronary disease need never 
exist, and where it does exist, it need not progress. Present coronary artery 
disease therapy need not become the radical mastectomy of this century.</p>

<h1>makes women</h1> 
<h1>feel beautiful</h1> <strong>By Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, 
Healingtalks Editor</strong> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> This article is not meant to condone any 
<strong>conventional cancer therapies using radiation, drugs and chemotherapies
</strong>. Having organized an alternative cancer treatment center, I know the 
alternatives are far, far preferrable over the toxic treatments conventionally 
used. Natural therapies do not make a woman&rsquo;s hair fall out!</p> 
<p>How can disfiguring approaches be&nbsp; healing? It goes against all common 
sense.</p> 
<p>But then modern medicine convinces us to give over rational&nbsp; judgment 
to the doctor&rsquo;s pontifications, being led by the most miseducated 
individuals in our culture by far and whose consciousness is shaped 
lock-stock-and-barrel by drug-company funded educational institutions.</p> 
<h3>Uplifting Women Battling Cancer</h3> 
<p>This post is meant to <strong>uplift women battling breast and other cancers
</strong> in more than a superficial way, and to give real hope.</p> 
<p>Let us honor a woman&rsquo;s sacred body by first<strong> going organic
</strong>, avoiding as much as possible the exposure to chemicals in our total 
home and office environment, and most certainly not taking in chemical drugs 
through our mouths or by injection (the abomination that we call modern 
medicine). A large class of&nbsp; pharmaceuticals can cause cancer as a main, 
not so-called side effect (a matter of brainwashing). Let the beautiful women 
of this world not fall prey to a doctor&rsquo;s prescription to treat cancer 
with the most toxic, anti-healing of elements &ndash; advocated by an archaic, 
barbaric system of medicine that is in shambles.</p> 
<h3>The Biggest Con of Cons</h3> 
<p>There is hardly a bigger con in modern medicine that to take the drugs that 
cause cancer to claim to cure cancer &ndash; what is actually a ploy not to 
face the fact that chemicals cause cancer &ndash; what would require deep 
life-style changes.&nbsp; The statistics for the insanity of modern toxic 
medical approaches are brutal, and yet they continue to be practiced for the 
bottom line.</p> 
<h3>Honor a Woman&rsquo;s Beauty</h3> 
<p>So let us greatly honor every woman&rsquo;s beauty&hellip;.and by more than 
superficial means &ndash; to just take a surface image photo.</p> 
<p>Let us advise every woman undergoing this trauma to stay far away from 
the&nbsp; loors, the wallet-vacuum-cleaners, the deceptions of modern 
$-allopathic-$ medicine with its most toxic of approaches. Don&rsquo;t be 
fooled.</p> 
<p>With that said, here is Meagan&rsquo;s heartening story about Terri 
Shaver&rsquo;s passion:</p> 
<p>______________________________________________________________________</p> 
<h3>Terri Shaver&rsquo;s Passion</h3> 
<p>Nearly every day, Terri Shaver comes face to face with cancer and 
can&rsquo;t help but think about her life and how short it could be. For more 
than four years, the 56-year-old photographer&nbsp; has taken free portraits of 
people with terminal and life-threatening illnesses as part ofthe Oldham Project
, the nonprofit she founded after her husband&rsquo;s two sisters-in-law died 
from breast cancer.</p> 
<p>Although the Oldham Project, named for the two sisters, provided photos for 
families and children, Shaver startedBe Bold, Feel Beautiful, a campaign 
specifically aimed at women with cancer, in summer 2010.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be the same,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;These women 
are already dealing with the choices of the things they want to accomplish or 
need to accomplish before their time here is over. They really see the things 
that are important.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>To Feel Beautiful Again</h3> 
<p>The campaign began as a way to provide the women who lost their hair from 
cancer treatments photos in which they felt beautiful. Although she had already 
been taking photos of people with cancer, Shaver wanted to raise awareness, and 
from her extended family, knew what a powerful effect going bald had on women 
in particular.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When they lose their hair, 99.9% of these women have said that they 
lose themselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They lose their identity.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Shaver remembers one woman telling her that when her eyelashes and eyebrows 
fell out, she looked in the mirror and saw an alien. But when the women see 
their photos &mdash; some somber and some lighthearted, posing with something 
significant to them &mdash; they regain their self-image. Shaver said some have 
even told her that they stopped wearing their wigs after the session.</p> 
<p>Since the campaign started in July 2010, Shaver has photographed about 100 
women &mdash; ages 20 to 82 &mdash; who have had cancer, as well as partnering 
with a local spa to pamper them and try to make them feel gorgeous for a day. 
Although it began as a campaign planned to run until October, which is<strong>
Breast Cancer Awareness Month</strong>, Shaver said the feedback from the women 
was overwhelming and she extended the campaign to be a permanent fixture of the
<strong>Oldham Project</strong>.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Your will has a lot to do with progress that you make when 
you&rsquo;re sick,&rdquo; Shaver said. &ldquo;I firmly believe that if I can 
make women feel better about themselves, while they&rsquo;re undergoing this 
treatment and have no hair, their treatment will be much more successful.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Before starting a session, Shaver turns up the music in her studio and 
strives for an optimistic perspective, determined to make the day an uplifting 
experience for the woman.</p>

<h2>Steve Jobs dead at 56: A life ended by chemotherapy and radiotherapy for 
cancer</h2> 
<p>1 Comment 06 October 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Steve Jobs dead at 56:</h1> 
<h1>A life ended by chemotherapy</h1> 
<h1>and radiotherapy for cancer</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;(Healingtalks)</strong> It is extremely sad that&nbsp; Steve 
Jobs , a man of great vision and genius at the helm of Apple, died today and 
prematurely from his cancer treatments. There is little doubt, as that is what 
usually happens with about 97-98% of cancer patients treated conventionally, 
that his life was cut short like that of millions of others. This occurs due to 
a culture-wide indoctrinated belief that we must to follow and trust the 
dictates of&nbsp; persistent failure, as long as it has the stamp of approval 
of conventional medicine and its Big Pharma funding sources.</p> 
<h2>Criminal Ignorance</h2> 
<p>In fact, Steve Jobs died only a few months after being treated with 
chemotherapy at the<em>Stanford Cancer Center</em> and prior thereto with 
radiation.&nbsp; Here was a man whose life force was decimated by the horrid 
toxicity that is commonly and criminally inflicted on cancer patients via 
chemotherapy and radiation. We call it &ldquo;<strong>criminal ignorance
</strong>&rdquo; on the part of the medical industry because they know no 
better and shut their eyes to the alternatives.</p> 
<h2>Killer Treatments of Chemo and Radiation</h2> 
<p><strong>Steve Jobs chemotherapy treatments</strong> are documented (
http://www.marksmarketanalysis.com/&hellip;)</p> 
<p><strong>Steve Jobs secret radiotherapy treatments</strong> in Switzerland 
were made public by Jerry York, a</p> 
<p>Jerry York told <em>Fortune Magazine</em> about the radiation treatments 
for his cancer at the<em>University of Basel in Switzerland </em>(
http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/01&hellip;) but&nbsp; kept this secret until 
Jerry York died in March of 2010 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_&hellip;). 
Thereafter Fortune Magazine went ahead and published the details&nbsp; (
http://gawker.com/5737092/steve-job&hellip;).</p> 
<h2>Steve Jobs Liver Transplant</h2> 
<p>Fortune also reported that Steve Jobs underwent a <strong>secret liver 
transplant</strong>.</p> 
<p>In January of this year, Roc4Life.com reported:</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;Jobs&rsquo; medical leave is due to cancer, but no one knows 
whether it stems from his 2004 battle with pancreatic cancer or complications 
from a secret liver transplant in 2009.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><strong>Steve Jobs thus underwent major conventional treatments</strong>, 
all of which combined converted a slow growing cancer into an abrupt end of his 
life.</p> 
<h2>Lesson To Be Learned</h2> 
<p>This is what every first grader should know.</p> 
<p>Yet the most left-brain intelligent Phds coming from the best of Ivy League 
Schools don&rsquo;t quite get it &ndash; not if bankrolled by Big Pharma. 
Basically if you poison your body with chemicals, you come closer to not 
farther away from death. Think of a compost heap where all plants decay or 
breakdown to form all other plant life in an unbroken circle of unity. Throw in 
any random mix of chemicals, and all life therein dies. This is elementary.</p> 
<p>You know how drug companies spend billions to test drugs in isolation. This 
is the foundation of their Big Scam. They never test the<strong>whole order of 
chemistry</strong> because that would end their mean game. Think of a compost 
heap wherein the order of chemistry clashes with the order of life &ndash; why 
we have organic farming.&nbsp; The more chemicals we randomly put into the heap 
(to test the whole order of chemistry) the more life therein dies. 
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if everyone understood that.</p> 
<p>This means that <strong>chemistry&rsquo;s order is not living 
nature&rsquo;s order</strong>.</p> 
<p>If life is at the core of nature overall, then <strong>chemistry&rsquo;s 
order is not nature&rsquo;s order</strong> as such</p> 
<p>Well what a radical idea that is! Only at healingtalks will you find dozens 
of articles about a life-centered vision of nature replacing the mechanical 
math-based.</p> 
<p>This deeply radical idea is that worth repeating, imagine that, contrary to 
what modern education teaches us&hellip;.</p> 
<h2><strong>Chemistry&rsquo;s Order is Not Nature&rsquo;s Order</strong></h2> 
<p>We have been indoctrinated or weaned on a faith in chemistry. We have been 
taught that chemistry constitutes a science of sciences. Unfortunately many 
take this belief not only to heart, and into their sub-subconsciousness, but to 
their early graves. Several Nobel Prize winning physicists and chemists have 
also pre-maturely died of Alzheimer&rsquo;s &ndash; not understanding, in this 
view, the nature of life and consciousness in nature; never suspecting that 
math symbols don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t point well to that kind of essence of 
nature.</p> 
<p>If this counter-cultural view is true, then <strong>chemotherapy not only 
won&rsquo;t work&hellip;..it can&rsquo;t</strong>!</p> 
<p>Using chemotherapy to try then to undue cancer is like using <strong>fifty 
cups of coffee just before going to bed to sleep better!</strong></p> 
<p>The insanity of using the most&nbsp; intensely cancer-causing chemicals to 
cure cancer, nevertheless, is commonplace.&nbsp; It is a sign of our crazy 
times.</p> 
<p>The practice is dictated again by a belief at the&nbsp; core of modernity 
&ndash; and the<strong>vast denial that this belief is and could be wrong, or 
that the whole chemical/pharmaceutical/drug-based approach is false, 
fallacious, erroneous, mistaken and even downright idiotic and stupid.&nbsp;
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Is a doctor going to admit such a thing? Or that his core approach 
to nature is bankrupt?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>No way, and he will do everything possible to try to prove the very 
opposite.<br>
</strong></p> 
<h2>Medical Heresy</h2> 
<p>If any doctor falls out of line, it is also a heresy. Naturopaths and other 
holistic professionals thus become the heretics or infidels to be stamped out.
</p> 
<p>No one is allowed to question the underling vision or the road of progress 
it supposedly unravels (an ever better life through chemistry).</p> 
<p>No one is allowed to question the mechanical, death-ridden vision of nature 
&ndash; and as first introduced in ancient Greece and as latter brought to 
dominance&nbsp; in the 17th century.</p> 
<h2>Mandatory and Necessary Denial</h2> 
<p>Again to question the underlying worldview is to risk being thrown out of 
the club &ndash; like a monk thrown out of a monastery for adopting a different 
religion. That would be too devastating.</p> 
<p>The same underlying worldview of medical doctor is the foundation of what 
gurus of technology follow.&nbsp; So it is little surprise that someone of 
Steve Jobs&rsquo;&nbsp; stature should turn to conventional cancer 
&ldquo;solutions.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Take away that belief in the underlying worldview, however,&nbsp; and 
the&nbsp; justification to prescribe drugs, surgery and radiation dies &ndash; 
rather than the patient!</p> 
<p>So that worldview is of no minor importance.</p> 
<p>It is sacrosanct.</p> 
<p>A denial or heresy stance would again destroy their whole approach to the 
healing arts.</p> 
<h2>Thus Never Mind the Consequences</h2> 
<p>Thus never mind that chemicals do not cure cancer.</p> 
<p>If the evidence shows that&nbsp; one would think doctors would wholesale 
abandon drugs and chemicals in that field.</p> 
<p>But no.<strong>&nbsp; Absolutely not</strong></p> 
<p><strong>So deep a belief, so hypnotically held, cannot be denied mentally 
or culturally.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>As we learn with hypnosis in general, a belief will take precedence 
over ANY evidence of our senses</strong>.</p> 
<p>Of course we&rsquo;re never taught that possibility&hellip;and for 
something so vital&hellip;namely that the root vision of nature, the 
mathematical, is really a vast belief system in symbol idols that structures 
rather than discovers the nature of our world.</p> 
<p>We are rather taught this is all and only objective science, and chemists 
and doctors are our best guides thereto. We only then look at how the vision or 
belief works successfully (as in designing Apple computers and other mechanical 
things) and not how and where and why it utterly fails. And the failures are 
really legion, but blotted out in the fabric of that worldview.</p> 
<p><strong>A belief that again that so deeply constructs reality cannot be 
overturned with ease.<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>Unfortunately great individuals fall victims to the denial process that 
there are failures. Famous individuals who took conventional treatments and 
then soon died&nbsp; include Farrah Fawcett, Peter Jennings, Patrick Swayze, 
Michael Douglas.</p> 
<p>Still there is a society-wide blindness that ever persists. Conventional 
cancer treatments obviously fail. They maim and kill millions.</p> 
<p>They don&rsquo;t work, except in relatively rare cases, and for short 
periods of time.</p> 
<p>This is because poisons poison our body.&nbsp; Duhhh</p> 
<p>But if doctors unrelentingly tells us to still take such poisonous 
treatments&nbsp; (and to pay them and hospitals dearly for the same) perhaps we 
should?&nbsp; And then we have to face the consequences of our gullibility 
rather than better taking health into our own hands.</p> 
<h2>Why Conventional Cancer Treatments Cannot But Fail!</h2> 
<p>The underlying reason is as follows:</p> 
<p>If healing is a <strong>connective coming to wholeness</strong> then</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; cutting our body apart (<strong>
disconnecting it</strong>) can&rsquo;t heal u<strong></strong>s.</li> 
<li><strong>Organ Transplants</strong> &ndash; treating the body as a machine 
made of<strong>separate interchangeable parts</strong> can&rsquo;t heal us.</li>
<li><strong>Radiation</strong> &ndash; using a by-product of <strong>things 
falling apart</strong> can&rsquo;t heal us</li> </ul> 
<h2>Is There a Bigger Lie Anywhere In Our Modern World?</h2> 
<p>So back&nbsp; to how <strong>Steve Jobs&rsquo; life as stolen by the cancer 
industry</strong>.</p> 
<p>The mass media filters out the hints that conventional medical doctors 
might be lying to us and to themselves when they so rarely care about chemicals 
in our processed foods polluting every organ of our bodies. Why? Obviously that 
would make us question similarly taking in chemical drugs into the depths of 
ourselves as dictated by doctors &ndash; pharmaceutical front men and women !
</p> 
<p>You <strong>must</strong> tell people that they need to use such chemicals 
to undue and cure cancer!</p> 
<p>Is there a bigger lie anywhere in our modern world?&nbsp; If so, pray tell.

<p>HEALING US, Smoking, Stop Smoking</p> 
<h2>Is Smoking Bad For You?</h2> 
<p>No Comments 04 October 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Is Smoking Bad</h1> 
<h1>For You?</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> We know that <strong>smoking can cause some 
major illnesses</strong>, including heart disease, cancer, and certainly 
respiratory disease that all lead to untimely or premature death.&nbsp; It is 
reported that nearly half a million people in the USA&nbsp; die prematurely 
(about 1/5th of annual deaths) and 100,000 in the UK due to smoking. According 
to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control), nearly a 100 billion dollars are also 
wasted annually because of lost productivity.</p> 
<p><strong>Smoking is&nbsp; the single largest preventable global cause of 
death</strong>. In addition,&nbsp; <strong>second-hand smoke exposure is a 
major health hazard</strong>.</p> 
<h2>Smoking causes cancer</h2> 
<p>A stunning 90% of lung cancer victims developed their condition due to 
smoking. Smokers also have a significantly higher risk of&nbsp; many other 
forms of cancer, including kidney, esophagus, nose, mouth, cervical, bowel, 
pancreas, liver and so on.</p> 
<h2>Why does smoking raise cancer risk?</h2> 
<p>The answer is simple. There are over 4,000 different and often toxic 
ingredients in cigarette smoke that can harm us. Tobacco smoke, however, 
consists mainly of three ingredients:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Nicotine</strong>&nbsp; is not known as a carcinogenic. Rather it 
is addictive.<strong>Nicotine gets smoker&rsquo;s quickly hooked</strong>
.&nbsp; It reaches the brain in just 15 seconds after inhalation. Nicotine is 
used also a controlled insecticide where its use leads to vomiting, seizures, 
and an overall depression of the central nervous system, as well as growth 
retardation. It impairs a fetus&rsquo; development.</li> 
<li><strong>Carbon Monoxide is a tasteless poisonous gas</strong>. The body 
finds it hard to differentiate carbon monoxide from oxygen and absorbs it 
readily into the bloodstream.&nbsp; Carbon monoxide causes fatigue, weakness, 
and dizziness. It is also a cardiovascular depressant. It is especially toxic 
for babies in the womb, infants and smokers with impaired immune systems.</li> 
<li><strong>Tar</strong> <strong>is carcinogenic</strong>.&nbsp; Worse yet, 
when a smoker inhales, about 70% of the tar remains in their lungs. If you try a
<strong>smoker&rsquo;s handkerchief test</strong> (fill the mouth with smoke 
but don&rsquo;t inhale, and rather blow the smoke through the handkerchief) and 
you will see the sticky dark brown stains.&nbsp; Do this again, but this time 
inhale and the handkerchief only has a faint light brown stain. The rest rains 
in your lungs and other respiratory channels.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Smoking and heart/cardiovascular disease</h2> 
<p><strong>Smoking is a known cause of atherosclerosis</strong>, thus 
contributing to&nbsp; coronary heart disease. People with coronary heart 
disease are much more likely to have a heart attack.</p> 
<p><strong>Smoking worsens a major heart disease risk factor</strong>. It does 
so by raising blood pressure. This makes it harder to exercise and to function 
overall.&nbsp; A much<strong>higher percentage of smokers have strokes</strong> 
compared to others of the same age.&nbsp; Those who smoke run a<strong>higher 
risk of developing aortic aneurysm and arterial disease</strong>. When we 
<strong>inhale smoke regularly, the cerebrovascular system is damaged</strong>. 
Additionally<strong>female smokers who use contraceptives</strong> has a still 
higher risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke. Also if you smoke 
your levels of HDL or<em>good cholesterol</em> will drop. If you have a history 
of heart disease and smoke, forget it.You are literally playing with fire to 
snuff out your life premaurely.</p>

<p>HEALING US, Inflammations</p> 
<h2>Natural and Powerful Anti-Inflammatory Remedies</h2> 
<p>No Comments 30 September 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1><strong>Natural and Powerful</strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>Anti-Inflammatory</strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>Remedies</strong></h1> 
<p>In my life-long naturopathic studies, I have keenly observed how most major 
illnesses tend to begin with a subliminal or slight, almost unnoticed 
inflammation.</p> 
<h3><strong>Understanding the Key Role of Inflammations</strong></h3> 
<p>What this really is, is a <strong>burning out of the life force</strong>, 
fire taking out the light or inner consciousness of the body. If there is a 
surplus of life force, the body overcomes the inflammation and the next day you 
may feel fine. But over time, often decades, something else happens. How does 
this bring about eventual disease?</p> 
<p>The answer is actually simple but profound. This is based on the deep 
insight that consciousness in us, and in all of nature, forms a<strong>
universal relationship of connection</strong>. Imagine this is the true 
foundation of nature being sacredly one. Then without the high-level presence 
of inner consciousness, any living nature would fall apart because 
consciousness is that relationship of connection. We too become not 
&ldquo;at-one&rdquo; or whole or healthy as a result. We become ill and 
diseased. As consciousness depletes itself over time, inflammations manifest 
first in the early or acute stages of illness. In the later stages of illness, 
consciousness is indeed depleted in a non-recovering way. There is no longer 
adequate inner awareness, inner life &ndash; as with the brain unconsciousness 
of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, the unconsciousness of extremities with 
diabetics, and the silently spreading unconsciousness of metastatic cancer 
sufferers.</p> 
<h3><strong>Knowing the Importance of Counteracting Inflammations</strong></h3>
<p>By understanding the above deeply, we fathom the huge importance of 
counteracting any and all inflammations &ndash; such as nephritis, colitis, 
arthritis, hepatitis, prostatitis, encephalitis, rhinitis, retinitis etc. The 
list is almost endless precisely because this ties into the universal 
principles underlying the life force of the body as a whole. The ever greater 
specializing of medicine (it also makes more money that way) and thus the ever 
more narrow focusing of modern medicine is reflective of a root 
misunderstanding towards this underlying connective and true healing principles 
of nature and thus our bodies.</p> 
<p>The conventional approach then is to treat inflammation with some type of 
<strong>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, like Vioxx</strong> &mdash; which 
was taken off the market years ago after it had killed more than 60,000 people.
</p> 
<p>These drugs do little or nothing to treat the cause of inflammations. In 
fact they are essentially harmful to the healing process by design. For 
chemical drugs are designed ultimately by mathematical means, and mathematics 
abstracts how to exactly<strong>separate</strong>, not connect, all of 
consciousness. This&nbsp; is a long discussion to explain this fully but here. 
It is just important to know that this mathematical ideology of nature, forms a
<strong><em>very poor and misguided</em></strong> way to connect our whole 
vision of the world and of the cosmos. The reader has probably never read such 
a statement before, so it involves a little shock to the sensibilities, and 
time to absorb. But this is, in fact, the root reason why most of modern 
healthcare systems, dispensing surgery, radiation and pharmaceutical drugs (all 
math-view related) and yielding many major side-effects, do not help with the 
root cause of inflammations.</p>  So it takes quite a huge and daring 
counter-cultural leap, a leap of faith at first until the results are seen. 
This shift is one that, in a half a century of experience, I have seen as a 
means &ldquo;:<strong>to cure the incurable</strong>&rdquo; &ndash; a refrain 
used by the Gerson Therapy&hellip;and where the results again speak for 
themselves. <strong>Miseducation of Physicians &ndash; Being Taught 
Newton&rsquo;s Mechanical Worldview</strong> 
<p>On the flip side of this, what modern medicine does is failing.&nbsp; We 
see a spread of inflammatory and chronic health epidemics &ndash; especially 
the most consciousness-depleting one&rsquo;s (cancer, diabetes, 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s). We are told that somehow a cure is just around the corner, 
with more chemical or genetic research, but in the meantime we are helpless to 
stop this. We can lessen the pain, becoming yet more unconscious by using 
drugs. We can extend our lives where diseases are then very profitably managed 
but not cured by the doctor or hospital.</p> 
<p>In fact more than half of Americans are diagnosed as continuously suffering 
from chronic ills and about 25% of children as well. Still a higher number 
remain undiagnosed with some subliminal or latent conditions.</p> 
<p>Thus an embracing of<strong> alternative principles</strong> becomes a very 
welcome turn of events. The re-understanding is itself is a major healing event 
in our very inner disabled society.</p> 
<h3><strong>Taking Action &ndash; Using Powerful Anti-Inflammatory Supplements
</strong></h3> 
<p>With the above new understanding we can now be inspired to take seriously 
the huge importance of anti-inflammatory remedies. We can use them with more 
staying power, not deflected back toward ill-promoting and less conscious 
paths. Fortunately there are very powerful natural anti-inflammatory remedies 
we can turn to:</p> 
<h3><strong>MSM (methylsulfonylmethane)</strong></h3> 
<p>MSM has the ability to <strong>neutralize, eliminate or reduce inflammation
</strong>. It also can break down the calcification that is associated with 
later-stage or chronic states of hardening or life-depletion. In your arteries, 
the physical name for this is<strong>plaque</strong> and it feeds heart 
disease.&nbsp; MSM turns such calcified deposits into calcium sulfate to be 
excreted, as described in the chemical model<em>. </em>The dosage maybe 2,500 
mg per day. But you need to build up to 5,000 mg or 7,500 mg, and allow it to 
work over a period of months. This can be used as a<strong>remedy for 
rheumatoid arthritis</strong> (where the &rsquo;tis&rsquo; of course stands for 
inflammation). It&rsquo;s also important to note that if you&rsquo;re allergic 
to sulfa drugs, you may have trouble with MSM because it is a type of sulfur.
</p> 
<p>MSM is not a drug however. It is a natural compound that exists in all 
trees and many plants.<strong>MSM is highly concentrated in aloe vera</strong>, 
for example, so you can also use natural aloe vera products that contain MSM. 
As with most supplements, quality is a concern when it comes to MSM. Consider 
using tree-derived form.</p> 
<h3><strong>Vitamin C </strong></h3> 
<p>A tremendous <strong>antioxidant, vitamin C is also anti-inflammatory
</strong>, and is vital for rebuilding collagen and connective tissue. Take 
your MSM and vitamin C together if possible. Your best bet is to use a natural 
plant-based or botanical vitamin C supplement, such as acerola cherry, rosehip, 
or camu berry. Keep in mind that high doses of vitamin C can cause diarrhea, so 
again, you&rsquo;ll want to start slowly and work your way up to about 3,000 mg 
per day. Certain newer supplements also use<strong>liposomal -delivery systems
</strong> that can increase their bio-availability.</p> 
<p><strong>Practical Advice</strong> &ndash; A great idea is to start a 
morning routine of making freshly-squeezed citric juice, with an MSM and 
Vitamin C added. Then, depending on the severity of the condition add green 
veggie juices during the day.&nbsp; In addition note that early in the morning, 
the citric juices, with vitamin C added, will have a laxative, colon-cleaning 
effect,</p> 
<h3><strong>Medicinal Mushrooms</strong><strong></strong></h3> 
<p>These include <strong>reishi mushrooms, cordyceps, <em>Agaricus blazei </em>
and chaga mushrooms</strong>. Medicinal mushrooms can help boost your immune 
system to break up longstanding infections.</p> 
<p><strong>Practical Advice</strong> &ndash; There are also mushroom products 
available as powders. These are best added to smoothies, protein shakes, teas 
and other beverages.</p> 
<p><strong>Herbs/Condiments &ndash; Such as Fennel and Dill</strong></p> 
<p>Fennel is a cooling plant suitable for juicing. Fennel juice is 
specifically recommended for headaches and migraines which are really brain 
inflammations. Dill is related to fennel, and is incidentally very beneficial 
for producing breast milk in nursing women. Also anti-inflammatory herbs like 
tumeric and cummin are commonly used in Indian cuisine. fennel, cardamon, mint, 
basil, shredded coconut and raita spices. See</p> 
<p><strong>Practical Advice</strong>: See which cooling spices best agree with 
your palate and add them to your favorite recipe. These are especially 
recommended during hot summers, but can be used at any time to counter 
inflammations. In Indian cuisine, these can include- <em>turmeric</em><strong> 
</strong>- an anti-inflammatory, helps detoxify the liver, balance cholesterol 
levels, fight allergies, stimulate digestion, boost immunity and enhance the 
complexion.-<em>coriander </em>- a cooling herb spices.</p> 
<p><strong>Vitamin D</strong></p> 
<p>Nearly all patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
tend to be deficient in vitamin D, according to Dr. Mercola who has treated 
thousands of patients naturally with this ailment. So optimizing your vitamin D 
levels, with supplements or sunlight, is recommended as an essential part of 
treating this condition.</p> 
<p><strong>Practical Advice</strong> &ndash; Get a good quality Vitamin D 
supplement and add this to your routine during the winter months, if in your 
geographic region there is too little sunlight.</p> 
<h3><strong>Mangosteen</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>Organic mangosteen rind</strong> is a further superior antioxidant 
with anti-inflammatory properties. The rind of mangosteen has been used in 
traditional medicinal systems in Southeast Asia, all the way into Indonesia, 
since the beginning of recorded history. Interestingly, it specifically treats 
the pain and inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis.</p> 
<h3><strong>Astaxanthin and Omega Fats</strong><strong><em> </em></strong></h3>
<p>This is a seafood component extracted from algae. Astaxanthin provides 
three unusual health benefits:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Preventing sunburn (4mg dose)</li> 
<li>Eliminating cataracts and age-related macular degeneration</li> 
<li>Protection against radiation damage when flying in an airplane</li> </ul> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit pricey. So a less expensive alternative is krill oil, 
which also contains astaxanthin, in addition to essential omega-3 fats such as 
eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA).</p> 
<p><strong>Juicing Celery and Cucumber</strong></p> 
<p>Vegetable juicing, particularly celery and cucumber juices, will help 
greatly. To such juices the above supplements can all be added.</p> 
<p>Juices carry the life force of plants the most, being the more liquid thus 
<strong><em>connective</em></strong> (conscious and life bearing) rather than 
<strong><em>solid or separative</em></strong> (unconscious or death bearing) 
aspect of any plant&rsquo;s existence.</p> 
<p>Celery and cucumbers are very rich in electrolytes and have a cooling 
effect on your body, which is the same as anti-inflammatory. These drinks are 
thus used as a juicing base at the Hippocrates Institute, Tree of Life and 
other major natural healing centers to also and further draw toxins out of the 
body that are the source of inflammations.</p> 
<p><strong>Practical Advice:</strong> If you are fighting a serious chronic 
disease, have a base of celery and/or cucumber juice (adding the juice of 
sprouts and your favorite greens) and drink an eight&nbsp; ounce glass at least 
twice a day. With the Gerson Therapy, there are 13 daily juices, often for 
patients for are literally fighting for their life.</p> 
<h3><strong>Raw Living Foods </strong></h3> 
<p>Inflammations take the life force out of the body so you want to put it 
back in. This cannot be done with just eating essentially dead or high-heated 
foods. Raw living foods instead are both cooling and enlivening.</p> 
<p><strong>Practical Advice: </strong>It is a good idea to get a book on raw 
living food cuisine. Like learning how to prepare Indian or Chinese food, it is 
a world unto itself, and can be quite an adventure. To follow this full-fledged 
means added a good juicer, blender, food processor and dehydrator to your 
kitchen. We learn how to prepare the most delicious dishes in an 
&ldquo;uncooked&rdquo; way, and with foods heated no more than about 105-110 
degrees Fahrenheit. During the winter, we pour hot water over yummy uncooked 
ingredients and add a little fermented soy plus spices that agree with the 
palate.<strong><br>
</strong><strong><br>
 Emotional Component</strong></p> 
<p>We can have toxic and inflaming emotions which will feed an ill condition 
of the body. So addressing these emotional wounds is another vital part of the 
process. Dr. Mercola recommends his&nbsp; Emotional Freedom Technique and there 
are many other such spiritual or inner approaches to emotional healing or 
emotional detoxing.</p> 
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> 
<p>Getting rid of inflammations is a <strong>GIANT</strong> step to taking 
real and true control of your health and that of your loved ones.</p> <br>

<h2>Ten Natural Ways To Overcome Yeast Infection</h2> 
<p>Comments Off 29 September 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Ten Natural Ways</h1> 
<h1>To Overcome</h1> 
<h1>Yeast Infections</h1> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> If you&rsquo;re affected by yeast an 
infection, likelihood is your physician would prescribe a chemical ointment or 
drug. But these chemicals tend to aggravate this disease by serving to unfold 
the<strong>yeast-like fungi Candida albicans</strong>. Listed below are the ten 
best<strong>natural cures for yeast infection</strong> or within the holistic 
style.</p> 
<h3>Proper Hygiene</h3> 
<p>The primary cure is prevention by way of proper hygiene. Yeast infection 
spreads mostly by way of carelessness, whether or not by exposure to a 
sufferer, to Candida albicans, or to chemicals which trigger yeast infection. 
Hence, no lending of non-public belongings, and dispose expired products 
properly.</p> 
<h3>Wholesome Lifestyle</h3> 
<p>Reduce ingesting alcoholic drinks and faucet water.&nbsp; Get adequate 
sleep. Improve your nutrition. Detoxify and fast periodically.</p> 
<p>Get Adequate Sleep</p> 
<p>to fight off yeast infections you want to keep your immune system strong 
which means getting adequate sleep.</p> 
<h3>Avoid Chemical Drugs</h3> 
<p>Antibiotics especially&nbsp; kill the micro organism that monitor the 
growth of Candida albicans. Other medicines to avoid include contraception 
treatment, immuno-suppressants and steroids.</p> 
<h3>Anti-Yeast Infection Dietary Eliminations</h3> 
<p>The usual Candida diet reduces or eliminates the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Sugars</strong> <strong>and sweet fruits, especially dried fruits 
</strong></li> 
<li><strong>High yeast and mold content foods</strong> like cheeses, dried 
fruit, melons and peanuts</li> 
<li><strong>Pasteurized milk, dairy products, and foods with excessive lactose
</strong> . Raw milk yoghurt enhanced with probiotics is a better bet to a path 
to healing candida infections.</li> 
<li><strong>Difficult to digest foods</strong> &ndash; like most beans and 
nuts. When not well digested the foods ferment and this feeds candida</li> </ul>
<h3>Anti-Yeast Infection Dietary Inclusions</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Plenty of Water</li> 
<li>Natural teas</li> 
<li>All Greens</li> 
<li>Whole grains like millet, brown rice, and oatmeal without sugar</li> 
<li>Probiotic supplements;</li> 
<li>Grapefruits, lemons, and other low-sugar fruits</li> 
<li>Proteins, preferably plant based. Otherwise lean meats and fish</li> 
<li>Seaweeds</li> </ul> 
<p>Sticking to this kind of a food plan, and even after the symptoms 
disappear, not only boosts immunity, it curbs the Candida albicans&nbsp; future 
increase and reintroduces friendly bacteria.</p> 
<h3>Natural antifungal agents</h3> 
<p>These can be used topically and by ingesting.<strong></strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Garlic paste</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Virgin</strong> <strong>coconut oil</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Diluted tea tree oil</strong></li> 
<li>&nbsp;<strong>Grapeseed extract</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Tannins from tea and condiments</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>Women with vaginal yeast an infection might discover reduction in a couple 
of drops of diluted tea tree oil. Twice a day is recommended and by inserting a 
tampon with either oil or yoghurt into the vagina. This remedy must be 
continued even after the signs disappear.</p> 
<p><strong>Ingesting licorice</strong> helps victims of endocrine yeast 
infection by stimulating hormones with out inflicting aspect effects. This 
candy can counteract the estrogen loss endured with vaginal yeast infections by 
means of the discharge of estrogen-like friendly steroids.</p> 
<h3>Electrolyte-heavy drinks</h3> 
<p>Squeeze in half a lemon&nbsp; in a glass of filtered water, then add 1/4 
teaspoon of Celtic sea salt (with eighty four minerals). Drink this six times a 
day, including with meals.</p> 
<h3>Colon Cleansing</h3> 
<p>Cleansing your colon naturally washes out the toxins made by Candida 
albicans and also makes the digestive system receptive to friendly bacteria. 
Recipes may differ, but they often contain a combination of garlic or garlic 
extract, cayenne peppers, apple cider or apple cider vinegar, and the spicy 
oregano oil.</p> 
<h3>Saunas</h3> 
<p>Daily saunas have a similar detoxifying effect and help support the 
elimination of Candida albicans.</p> 
<p>So&nbsp; these are the ten best natural approaches to eliminating yeast 
infection. There is no one standard cure so try a combination of the above and 
see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Measuring Your Body Weight And Fat</h2> 
<p>1 Comment 28 September 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Measuring Your</h1> 
<h1>Body Weight</h1> 
<h1>And Fat</h1> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks) </strong>It is important to keep track of your body 
weight as an early warning sign of impending chronic diseases. Here are a few 
measurement means you can use:<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong></h3> 
<p>This is a measure of weight in relation to height.</p> 
<p>It&nbsp; is commonly used for <strong>classifying overweight and obesity
</strong>. The risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes tend to 
increase on a continuum with increasing BMI, but for practical purposes a 
person with a<strong>BMI of over 25 is considered overweight</strong>, while 
someone with a BMI of over 30 is obese.</p> 
<p>But one size does not fit all. In women, a BMI as low as 21 may be 
associated with the greatest protection from coronary heart disease death. The 
BMI for observed risk in different Asian populations varies from 22 to 25 
kg/m2. Therefore weight loss experts believe that other methods should also be 
used to evaluate a person&rsquo;s overall health risk and the associated<strong>
grade of obesity</strong>.<strong></strong></p> 
<h3><strong> Waist-Hip Ratio (Pears&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;Apples&rdquo;)</strong>
</h3> 
<p>Health care providers are concerned not only with how much fat a person 
has, but also<strong>where the fat is located on the body</strong>.</p> 
<p>Women typically collect fat in their hips and buttocks, giving them a 
&ldquo;pear&rdquo; shape. Men usually build up fat around their bellies, giving 
them more of an &ldquo;apple&rdquo; shape. Of course some men are pear-shaped 
and some women become apple-shaped, especially after menopause. If you carry 
fat mainly around your waist, you are more likely to develop obesity-related 
health problems. Women with a waist measurement of more than 35 inches or men 
with a waist measurement of more than 40 inches have a higher health risk 
because of their fat distribution.<strong></strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Waist Circumference</strong></h3> 
<p>Circumference is the perimeter of, or the distance around a circle. So 
waist circumference is a measure of the distance around the abdomen. Waist 
circumference is one of the best means to measure abdominal fat for chronic 
disease risk and during weight loss treatment. A high waist circumference or a 
greater level of abdominal fat is associated with more risk of type 2 diabetes, 
high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease.</p> 
<p>According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services the 
following individuals are at increased risk for developing chronic diseases:</p>
<p><strong>&bull; Women with a waist circumference of more than 35 inches.<br>

 &bull; Men with a waist circumference of more than 40 inches.</strong></p> 
<p>However, however, lower thresholds for waist circumference have been 
recommended for Asian populations by the World Health Organization.</p> 
<p>Therefore, those at increased risk for developing chronic disease include:
</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Asian women with a waist circumference of more than 31 
inches.<br>
 &bull; Asian men with a waist circumference of more than 35 inches.
</strong></p> 
<h3>Instructions On How Best To Measure Your Waist</h3> 
<p>To measure waist circumference locate the top of the hip bone. Place the 
tape measure evenly around the bare abdomen at the level of this bone. Read the 
tape measure and record the waist circumference in inches. Ensure that the tape 
is sung but does not push tightly into the skin and you measure waist 
circumference after breathing out normally.</p> 
<h3><strong>Is Waist Circumference A Better Indicator Than BMI?</strong></h3> 
<p>Waist circumference may be a better indicator of health risk than BMI 
alone, especially when used in combination with BMI. Waist circumference is 
particularly useful for individuals with a<strong>BMI of 25-34.9</strong>. For 
individuals with a<strong>&bull; Least risk &ndash; slim (no pot belly)<br>
 
&bull; Moderate risk &ndash; overweight with no pot belly<br>
 &bull; Moderate 
to high risk &ndash; slim with pot belly<br>
 &bull; High risk &ndash; 
overweight with pot belly.</strong></p> <strong> 
<h3><strong>Waist circumference and health risks</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>For men:</strong></p> 
<p>&bull; 94cm or more &ndash; increased risk<br>
 &bull; 102cm or more 
&ndash; substantially increased risk.</p> 
<p><strong>For women:</strong></p> 
<p>&bull; 80cm or more &ndash; increased risk<br>
 &bull; 88cm or more &ndash; 
substantially increased risk.</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p>It is clear that no single measure including <strong></strong><strong>BMI
</strong> is 100% accurate in determining health risk due to body weight. 
Multiple methods such as BMI, wait to hip ratio and waist circumference can 
thus be used to evaluate risks &ndash; the<strong>link with your body weight 
and body fat</strong>.</p> </strong> <strong> </strong> <strong> </strong>

<h2>Childhood Obesity = Increased Heart Conditions</h2> 
<p>No Comments 27 September 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Childhood Obesity =</h1> 
<h1>Increased</h1> 
<h1>Heart Conditions</h1> 
<p><strong>Based on an article posted at http://www.natural-holistic-health.com
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Regrettably, obesity is a substantial 
problem in our times.</p> 
<p>Being fat increases the danger for heart conditions throughout a 
person&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, obesity in kids has been called 
a warning sign of heart disease.</p> 
<h3>Obesity and Related Illness Statistics &amp; Data</h3> 
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), sixteen 
percent of kids between the ages of two and nineteen meet the criteria for 
obesity.</p> 
<p>And while brand-new cases of fat kids aren&rsquo;t necessarily rising, the 
number of<strong> kids with diabetes is rising</strong>. This might well be a 
repercussion of the<strong> childhood obesity epidemic</strong>.</p> 
<p>In one report, <strong>artery wall thickness in fat kids and teenagers
</strong> was observed to be as thick as the artery walls of a 45-year-old 
grownup. This signifies that childhood obesity may have a sort of quickening 
effect on heart disease.</p> 
<p>While the study wasn&rsquo;t conclusive and the number of participants was 
modest, it does erect a sure red flag of concern. Likewise, the<strong>arteries 
of fat kids might be in the beginning stages of coronary artery disease</strong>
, which is the artery-hardening process that leads to stroke and heart attack. 
A report in Austria discovered that many fat kids have enlarged hearts.</p> 
<p>Pediatricians and other experts are worried about the fact that these 
obesity-specific troubles are happening in such young folks, who are still 
going through growth and development. Their systems are still being 
&ldquo;calibrated,&rdquo; and experiencing heart and obesity troubles at such 
an early age implies there&rsquo;s additional time for the fat to do its 
destructive work. Put differently,<strong>heart disease acquires a head start
</strong> on its destructive effects in the body.</p> 
<p><strong>Elevated blood pressure is a different worry in fat kids</strong>, 
particularly those children who have a family history of elevated blood 
pressure.</p> 
<p>Another vexation about childhood obesity is the<strong> number of fat cells 
in the body</strong>. Once you become a grownup, the amount of fat cells you 
possess in your body doesn&rsquo;t change; they merely become larger or smaller 
as you slim down. The number of fat cells is still being determined in 
childhood, thus a fat kid is being set up to experience weight troubles for the 
remainder of his or her lifetime.</p> 
<h3>What to Do About Childhood Obesity</h3> 
<p>Thankfully, there are plenty of things you are able to do to forestall and 
treat obesity in your kid.</p> 
<p><strong>1st, lower the saturated fat your kid consumes.</strong></p> 
<p>Hot dogs, processed lunch meats, butter, and other animal fats (including 
full-fat dairy merchandises) had better be sharply limited.</p> 
<p><strong>Avoid empty calories</strong> such as those encountered in packaged 
cakes, cookies, and other sugar-rich and nutrient-deficient foods.</p> 
<p>Fast foods had better be entirely ruled out from the kid&rsquo;s diet.</p> 
<p>Encourage your kid to <strong>consume a lot of whole foods</strong> &ndash; 
brown rice, whole grain bread (preferably homemade), and fresh produce of all 
varieties. Nuts, while high in fat, establish healthy snacks that help your kid 
feel full. Let your youngster have treats in the form of home-baked desserts 
that don&rsquo;t bear a lot of sugar or fat (such as natural fruit leather).</p>
<p><strong>Do not forget exercise!</strong></p> 
<p>Children should run around in the invigorating air. Promote outdoor play, 
sports, biking, hiking, or other activity&hellip;&hellip;and get the whole 
family in on the program as well.</p>

<h2>Top Obesity Causing Foods</h2>

<h1>Top Obesity</h1> 
<h1>Causing Foods</h1> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> What are the a<strong>bsolute worst foods
</strong> out there for staying thin and healthy and thus the most <strong>
obesity-causing foods</strong> that you need to eliminate from your diet.</p> 
<p><strong>Here are the top ten obesity causing foods:</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>1) White Bread</strong></h3> 
<p>It comes from plain white flour that has been nutrient depleted and 
bleached. It will<strong>cause your blood sugar to spike</strong>, especially 
when refined sugars are added. These are empty calories. So cut out white 
bread, including hamburger buns, in favor of whole wheat or sprouted grain 
bread. You have then taken a major step in the direction of better health and 
losing rather than gaining wait.</p> 
<h3><strong>2) Processed Cereals</strong></h3> 
<p>Often they are made of empty calorie foods, like processed corn flakes and 
they are further packed with sugar coatings. This causes us to become hungry 
sooner. Cut them out in the morning, in favor of fruits and/or whole grain 
cereals like oatmeal.</p> 
<h3><strong>3) So-called &ldquo;Diet Low-Fat&rdquo; No-Sugar Foods</strong>
</h3> 
<p>They generally contain chemical additives, including artificial sweeteners, 
that make us hungrier later and actually contribute more to obesity.</p> 
<h3><strong>4) Fried Foods</strong></h3> 
<p>There often contain rancid oils cooked at very high temperatures. They may 
be coated with refined flours, also&nbsp; not good for you. Most commonly this 
includes french fries and fried battered chicken.Consider not adding the fries 
and going for backed or steamed foods instead.&nbsp; Better yet, eat much more 
raw, whole, organic and living foods &ndash; the best of foods for a leaner 
diet.</p> 
<h3><strong>5)</strong> <strong>Candy&nbsp;</strong></h3> 
<p><strong> </strong>Most commercial candy is fun to eat but laced with oodles 
of sugar as well as chemical dies and other chemical additives that disrupt 
normal digestion. That too much candy add to obesity is a no brainer. Try to 
substitute some fruits and veggie treats. Again this is a huge step.</p> 
<h3><strong>6) Coffee Drinks With Cream and Sugar Added</strong></h3> 
<p>This provides too much excess calories which contributes to weight gain. 
Try coffee straight!</p> 
<h3><strong>7)</strong> <strong>Donuts, Pastries, Cookies, Cakes and Other 
Confectionery Delight</strong>s</h3> 
<p>They often contain a high amount of fructose and white flower &ndash; a 
double whammy for creating obesity. They are empty calories contributing to 
weight gain.</p> 
<h3><strong>  Potato Chips</strong></h3> 
<p>These are deep fried with little nutrition. These are again empty calories 
which equate to creating weight gain. Try substituting fruits and veggies.</p> 
<h3><strong>9) Soda Pop</strong></h3> 
<p>This is the number one trigger of obesity because it is so popularly bought 
and drunk. This is usually full of corn syrup that is also genetically 
modified, leading to a long list of health problems. Again we have excess 
calories with little or no nutritional value and thus leading to weight gain. 
Try replacing these with water, teas, coffee and so on. Even diet soda pops are 
not a good idea.</p> 
<h3><strong>10) Pancakes with Syrup</strong></h3> 
<p>Again these are often made out of white flour and then covered with a 
highly sugary coating, guaranteeing a spike in blood sugar and the triggering 
of weight gains.</p>

<h2>America&rsquo;s Top Ten Health Problems</h2> 
<p>No Comments 22 September 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>America&rsquo;s Top Ten</h1> 
<h1>Health Problems</h1> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> The top ten health problems in America vary 
slightly between men and women. Men and women both need to be concerned, 
however, about the health problems that are common to both of them.</p> 
<h3>Heart Disease</h3> 
<p>For both men and women, <strong>heart disease kills the largest number of 
Americans per year</strong>. According to the American Heart Association, heart 
disease, which causes heart attacks and strokes,<strong>kills more people than
</strong> <strong>all forms of cancer</strong> combined. Quit smoking and eat a 
diet low in fat and sodium to cut your risk. That&rsquo;s the official or 
conventional advice. Actually much deeper lifestyle and diet changes are needed.
</p> 
<h3><strong>Cancer</strong></h3> 
<p>Lung cancer is the cancer responsible for the most deaths in both men and 
women. Women are also affected greatly by<strong> breast and colorectal cancers
</strong>.&nbsp; <strong>Reduce your risk of cancers</strong> by not smoking, 
exercising, doing regular detoxes (fasting, saunas, diet cleanses) and eating a 
truly healthy diet.</p> 
<h3>Stroke</h3> 
<p>Stroke is the number three cause of death in women, and the number four 
cause of death in men. Lifestyle changes that can reduce your risk of stroke, 
which again include quitting smoking, losing excess weight, exercising and 
eating a<strong>non-SAD or Standard American Diet</strong> of processed with 
mostly animal based fats and proteins.</p> 
<h3>Respiratory Diseases</h3> 
<p>Respiratory diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema belong to a class of 
diseases called COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recommends quitting smoking to prevent COPD, as 
it is the largest risk factor.</p> 
<h3>Injuries</h3> 
<p>The leading cause of fatal injuries in both men and women is motor vehicle 
accidents rivaled only by iatrogenic causes -&nbsp; chemical drug 
complications, overdoses, and other hospital and doctor-induced deaths. Thus 
avoiding conventional medicine (exposure to drugs, surgery and radiation, 
except in emergencies and treating mechanical ills, is an<strong>essential 
longevity and survival strategy</strong> in our&nbsp; medically corrupt times.
</p> 
<h3>Diabetes</h3> 
<p>Type 2 diabetes can cause kidney damage, heart disease and blindness. It is 
also a leading cause of death in both men and women. Lose extra weight, 
exercise and<strong>eat a healthy diet to prevent diabetes</strong>.</p> 
<h3>Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease</h3> 
<p><strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is the fifth-leading cause of death in 
women, and the tenth in men</strong>. Doctors do not know exactly what causes 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, but there may be a link between this disease and 
heart disease, as well as head injuries.</p> 
<h3>Influenza and Pneumonia</h3> 
<p>Most healthy people can fight off a simple case of influenza, but in some 
people, it may cause complications such as pneumonia, which are potentially 
fatal. Wash your hands frequently and get a flu vaccine each year as 
recommended by your doctor.</p> 
<h3>Kidney Disease</h3> 
<p>Kidney disease is the ninth-leading cause of death for both male and female 
Americans. It can be<strong>caused by high blood pressure or diabetes</strong>. 
It is important to<strong>keep your blood sugar under control</strong> if you 
are a diabetic in order to<strong>prevent kidney disease</strong>.</p> 
<h3>Septicemia</h3> 
<p><strong>Septicemia, or blood poisoning</strong> is the tenth-leading cause 
of death among women. It is usually a complication of a bacterial infection 
such as a lung or urinary tract infection. The best ways to prevent septicemia 
are to wash your hands often, seek medical care for any infections in the body 
and to change tampons often and avoid using tampons that are more absorbent 
than you need.</p>  Keywords: <strong>Top health issues, top health problems,

<p>Autism, HEALING US, Vaccines</p> 
<h2>Vaccines Cause Autism &ndash; A Proven and Hushed-Up Fact</h2> 
<p>No Comments 21 September 2011</p> 
<h1><strong><br>
 Vaccines Cause Autism -</strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>A Proven and<br>
</strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>Hushed-Up Fact</strong></h1> 
<p><strong>Based on an article by by PF Louis, published in Natural News
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> The <strong>USA National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program (VICP)</strong> is a crafty and sly federal program to
<strong> relieve the vaccine industry from financial liability</strong> for 
extreme vaccine injuries. Enough claims have been awarded to indicate our 
government&rsquo;s secret awareness of the<strong>link between a vaccine and 
autism</strong> while publicly hushing up the fact and denying it.</p> 
<h3><strong>VICP Background</strong></h3> 
<p>VICP was created in 1988 to&nbsp; supposedly &ldquo;maintain a stable 
supply of vaccines.&rdquo; What VICP actuallydoes is help vaccine manufacturers 
produce vaccines with &ldquo;stable profits&rdquo; &ndash; not worrying about 
the very deadly consequences and the huge financial liability that entails 
Apparently, there was a core dynamic within the federal VICP defending any and 
all&nbsp; FDA approvals of vaccines &ndash; which generally had little or 
nothing to do with science but were politically pressured. Then a bomb shell 
fell on this game when in 2008, the Georgia State Supreme Court issued the 
following statement:&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;There is no evidence that &ldquo;FDA 
approval alone renders a vaccine unavoidably safe.&rdquo;</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>VICP Develops a Diabolical &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo; Policy
</strong></h3> 
<p>So while the federal agencies, industry leaders, and pediatricians (all 
financially linked together, another truth-telling, eye-opening story) are 
publicly telling us there is&nbsp; absolutely and positively<strong>&ldquo;no 
link of vaccines to autism&rdquo;</strong> (a death knoll for vaccine sales if 
the public finds out)&nbsp; a recent study of 83 families with autistic 
children all&nbsp; &ldquo;quietly&rdquo;<strong>awarded&nbsp; vaccine damages 
and hush up money by VICP</strong> tells a very, very different story. Such 
awards, and now for over two decades, have included annual annuities to 
supposedly cover the child&rsquo;s health expenses over time. But diabolical 
truth is that this is precisely what keeps the parents from speaking to the 
media and warning others Again<strong>NVIC awards are effectively hush money
</strong>.According to one parent, Sarah Bridges, PhD, not telling the truth 
and using &ldquo;proper semantics&rdquo; is what helped her win her case. She 
didn&rsquo;t use the word autism, though<strong>autism destroyed her child
</strong>.</p> 
<h3>Autism Award Study</h3> 
<p>An independent study of NVIC awards was recently published study by <em>
Pace Environmental Law Review</em> and it reported that most of the 83 cases 
awarded<em><strong>did mention autistic behavior and even autism</strong>.</em> 
One such case was awarded after the an intelligent and healthy girl went totally
<strong>autistic after receiving nine vaccinations in one day</strong>! The 
Pace study, which was not covered by any noteworthy media outlets, had looked 
into over 1300 cases of<strong> brain damage claims from vaccines</strong>. So 
what Sarah Bridges may have implied is that parents have a better chance if 
they talk<strong>seizures, permanent brain damage, etc, while not mentioning 
autism</strong>. Nevertheless, the toothpaste is out of the tube, according to 
&ldquo;SafeMinds&rdquo; Executive Director Lyn Redwood, RN: &ldquo;This (Pace) 
study dramatically shifts the debate on autism and vaccines. The question is no 
longer,<strong>can vaccines cause autism</strong>? The answer is clear. Now, we 
have to ask,<strong>How many cases of autism have vaccines caused</strong> and 
how do we prevent new injuries from occurring?&rdquo;</p> 
<h3><strong>Truth Eventually Leaks Out &ndash; Vaccines Definitively Cause 
Autism</strong></h3> 
<p>The Safe Minds website has MSM video clips of former heads of major 
government health agencies who cautiously concede<strong>autistic reactions to 
vaccinations</strong>. Apparently it is easier to be truthful after retirement! 
Robert Kennedy, Jr., a high profile crusader for vaccine safety, has sat in on 
some vaccine industry board meetings. He angrily asserted that<strong>vaccine 
industry executives are aware of the vaccine toxicity dangers</strong> while 
publicly<strong>denying causal connections to autism</strong>.</p> 
<h3><strong>Root Spiritual Problem of Our Times</strong></h3> 
<p>Time and again, the lure to make money shows up as a most powerfully 
corrupting force in our culture. Underneath that terrible phenomenon is the 
deeper drumbeat of our culture, namely&nbsp; that to gain the very highest and 
purest knowledge of nature &ndash; to raise our consciousness to an objective 
level and to advance modern civ &ndash; we must dominantly mathematize 
everything around us. This has been the ideology over the past 400 years that 
is taking us to the brink. This is why physics and chemistry create such a 
tightest-of-tight marriage with commerce. But the wonderful mathematics we 
learn from grade school on is very simply&nbsp; &ldquo;the set of abstractions 
for how to<strong>separate</strong> all elements of consciousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Consciousness is what connects us to the world around us and within. Thus 
nothing corrupts or undermines that consciousness more than being focused on 
separation &ndash; something we are almost never taught or forewarned about. It 
counters the philosophy at the root of the Industrial Revolution and the whole 
transition in the 17th century from the medieval to the modern world.</p> 
<p>To be too focused on making money amounts to the same spiritual leadership 
or lack thereof. It causes such unbelievable extremes of &ldquo;narrow or 
separtive conscious focusing&rdquo; -&nbsp; wanting to ever not see, not know, 
not admit the whole truth about matters that otherwise are obvious when the 
financial bias is removed. Such truth-telling is is not written in this blog to 
promote an anti-mathematical or anti-commercial philosophy. It is more an issue 
of what dominates us &ndash; what is master and what is servant in our lives. 
In other words, we can pursue the making of money and the use of certain 
sciences in a subservient and positive way &ndash; keeping the integrity of our 
consciousness in tact. We just do not try to make money, the $ sign our 
mountain peak God. If we do, it will time and again corrupt us. No fooling.</p> 
<h3><strong>Spiritual and Physical Health of Children</strong></h3> 
<p>We need to all thus be forewarned. Every student on the planet must be 
taught this and deeply&hellip; before being drawn into various financially 
profitable careers, or of before blindly falling prey to a thousand and 
one&nbsp; deceptive traps of our culture. In&nbsp; our many blog posts, we 
expose what our culture does not want to expose. These forces are sometimes so 
extremely diabolical, especially in the &ldquo;healing arts,&rdquo; that they 
terribly harm our most precious children and youngsters. They harm our loved 
ones. In fact, under the leadership of Big Pharma,<strong>chronic ills among 
children have skyrocketed</strong>. Chronic disabilities among children have 
risen from 1.8% to 6.5%&nbsp; or more than tripled! And this is the tip of the 
iceberg.</p>

<p>Female Fertility, HEALING US</p> 
<h2>How Chemical Pollution Affects Female Fertility</h2> 
<p>No Comments 14 September 2011</p> 
<h3><strong></strong></h3> 
<h1><strong>Chemical Pollution </strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>May Affect </strong></h1> 
<h1><strong>Female&nbsp; Fertility<br>
</strong></h1> 
<p><strong>Based on an Article by Amanda Kidd, Contributing Writer</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> These days there is a sharp rise in 
infertility in women and it may be due to the harsh effects of chemical 
pollution.</p> 
<p><strong>DDT effect on Fertility</strong></p> 
<p>This kind of pollution includes the very common synthetic pesticide<strong> 
DDT or Dichloro Diphenyl Trichloroethane</strong>. The increasing rate of 
infertility in women is a big concern as more and more women are falling prey 
to greater risks of not conceiving and experiencing miscarriages. Thoughbanned 
in 1972 as a harmful toxic substance, <strong>traces of DDT remain in our 
environment.</strong> It is still manufactured in the US for export and thus 
finds its way back.</p> 
<p><strong>Other Environmental Toxins Proven To Cause Infertility</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li><em>Lead</em><br>
 Exposure to lead sources has been proven to negatively 
impact fertility in humans. Lead can produce teratospermias (abnormal sperm) 
and is thought to be an abortifacient, or substance that causes artificial 
abortion.</li> 
<li><strong><em>Medical Treatments and Materials</em></strong><br>
Repeated 
exposure to radiation, ranging from simple x-rays to chemotherapy, has been 
shown to alter sperm production, as well as contribute to a wide array of 
ovarian problems.</li> 
<li><strong><em>Ethylene Oxide</em></strong><br>
A chemical used both in the 
sterilization of surgical instruments and in the manufacturing of certain 
pesticides, ethylene oxide may cause birth defects in early pregnancy and has 
the potential to provoke early miscarriage.</li> 
<li><strong><em>Dibromochloropropane (DBCP)</em></strong><br>
Handling the 
chemicals found in pesticides, such as DBCP, can cause ovarian problems, 
leading to a variety of health conditions, like early menopause, that may 
directly impact fertility.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Rates of Female Infertility and Miscarriage</h3> <strong>Percentage of 
women with infertility differs with age.</strong> 15-24 years 
old&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. 4.1%25-34 years old&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.

<p>Numerous studies have shown that considerable alcohol and tobacco intakes 
have an effect on fertility. Cigarettes especially are laced with as many as a 
hundred different chemicals.&nbsp; See our many articles on cigarette smoking,

<h1>What are Cigarettes?</h1> 
<h1>Straight Up</h1> 
<p><strong>By Oliver Sparks, Staff Writer</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Cigarettes are something that will mess up 
our minds. Straight up!</p> 
<p><strong>The PrimaryMind Twister in Cigarettes</strong></p> 
<p>The primary psychoactive, or &ldquo;mind twisting&rdquo; chemical in 
cigarettes,&nbsp; is obviously nicotine.<br>
 &ldquo;Mind twisting&rdquo; means 
changing your thought process unnaturally and harmfully.</p> 
<p><strong>We fall for this because sometimes we get stressed and need a quick 
fix. When that first warm inhaling feel of sweet carbon monoxide and fiberglass 
fills your chest, in just 10 seconds, it appears all stress is gone. Now 
it&rsquo;s up to you to finish the cigarette, slowly rotting your lungs.
</strong></p> 
<p>So there is a catch. Yes you get immediate gratification for a price. In a 
decade or two you mess up your lungs &ndash; what filters and brings in oxygen, 
the carrier of life, to all of your cells.</p> 
<h3>What&rsquo;s Else Is In Cigarettes</h3> 
<p>And that&rsquo;s not all. Over 4,300 more separate chemicals can be found 
in a single cigarette. But when these all are burned together, they cause even 
more toxic chemical compounds to form. This is why, in 1970, Nixon passed a 
bill requiring a warning label on all packs of cigarettes, now commonly known 
as the Surgeon General&rsquo;s Warning. Additionally the bill outlawed<strong>
TV cigarette ads in commercials</strong>. Yet cigarette smoking recently is on 
an upswing, especially among teens.</p> 
<p>As it turns out, approximately one quarter of the youth alive in the 
Western Pacific Region (East Asia and the Pacific) today will<strong>die from 
tobacco use</strong>. Cigarette smoking is the second major cause of premature 
death, worldwide.</p> 
<p><strong>So what are cigarettes</strong>?</p> 
<p>A ticking time bomb in tiny tubes that should all have skull and bones 
marked on the them by law.</p>

<h2>Tobacco smoking kills</h2> 
<p>The world&rsquo;s premier health organization, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) is quite blunt about the impacts of tobacco and smoking:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tobacco is the second major cause of death in the world. 
<ul> 
<li>It is currently responsible for the death of 1 in 10 adults</li> 
<li>It is the leading <em>preventable</em> causes of all deaths</li> 
<li>It kills Tobacco up to half of its regular users.</li> 
<li>In 2005, tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths (1 every 6 seconds)</li> 
<li>If current smoking patterns continue, it will cause some 8 million deaths 
each year by 2030</li> 
<li>Tobacco caused 100 million deaths in the 20th century.</li> 
<li>At current trends up to one billion will die in the 21st century</li> </ul>
<p></p></li> 
<li>An estimated 1.3 billion people smoke 
<ul> 
<li>84% of all smokers live in developing and transitional economy countries
</li> 
<li>Most people start smoking before the age of 18; almost a quarter of these 
individuals begin using tobacco before the age of 10</li> 
<li>47.5% of all men smoke compared to 10.3% of women.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Tobacco is the fourth most common risk factor for disease worldwide.</li> 
<li>Tobacco is deadly in any form or disguise: 
<ul> 
<li>Cigarettes, pipes, bidies, kreteks, clove cigarettes, snus, snuff, 
smokeless, cigars&hellip;</li> 
<li>Mild, light, low tar, full flavor, fruit flavored, chocolate flavored, 
natural, additive-free, organic cigarettes, PREPS (Potentially Reduced-Exposure 
Products), harm-reduced</li> </ul> 
<p></p></li> 
<li>An estimated 200,000 workers die every year due to exposure to smoke at 
work; The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that second-hand smoke 
is responsible for about 3000 lung cancer deaths annually among non-smokers in 
the country.</li> 
<li>In 2000, fire caused by tobacco smoking caused 
<ul> 
<li>10% of all fire deaths</li> 
<li>300,000 deaths</li>

<h2>Tobacco Exacerbates Poverty</h2> 
<p>It is worth citing the WHO again for a summary of how tobacco exacerbates 
poverty:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Tobacco and poverty are inextricably linked. Many studies have shown that 
in the poorest households in some low-income countries as much as 10% of total 
household expenditure is on tobacco [and therefore] less money to spend on 
basic items such as food, education and health care. In addition to its direct 
health effects, tobacco leads to malnutrition, increased health care costs and 
premature death. It also contributes to a higher illiteracy rate, since money 
that could have been used for education is spent on tobacco instead. 
Tobacco&rsquo;s role in exacerbating poverty has been largely ignored by 
researchers in both fields.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&mdash; Why is tobacco a public health priority?, World Health 
Organization, December 1, 2004</p> 
<p>John Madeley also notes in his book, Big Business Poor People (Zed Books, 
1999), that heavy advertising of tobacco by Transnational Corporations (TNCs) 
can &ldquo;convince the poor to smoke more, and to use money they might have 
spent on food or health care, to buy cigarettes instead.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>Tobacco contributes to world hunger, diverting prime land from food 
production</h2> 
<p>Smoking also contributes to world hunger as the tobacco industry diverts 
huge amounts of land from producing food to producing tobacco as John Madely 
also notes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Dr Judith MacKay, Director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control in 
Hong Kong, claims that tobacco&rsquo;s &ldquo;minor&rdquo; use of land denies 
10 to 20 million people of food. &ldquo;Where food has to be imported because 
rich farmland is being diverted to tobacco production, the government will have 
to bear the cost of food imports,&rdquo; she points out.</p> 
<p>&hellip; The bottom line for governments of developing countries is that 
the net economic costs of tobacco are profoundly negative&mdash;the cost of 
treatment, disability and death exceeds the economic benefits to producers by 
at least US$200 billion annually &ldquo;with one third of this loss being 
incurred by developing countries&rdquo;.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&mdash; John Madeley, Big Business Poor Peoples; The Impact of 
Transnational Corporations on the World&rsquo;s Poor, (Zed Books, 1999) pp. 53, 
57</p> 
<p>Tobacco production damages the environment</p> 
<p>Madeley also describes in detail other impacts on land from tobacco use:</p>
<ul> 
<li>The land that has been destroyed or degraded to grow tobacco has affects 
on nearby farms. As forests, for example, are cleared to make way for tobacco 
plantations, then the soil protection it provides is lost and is more likely to 
be washed away in heavy rains. This can lead to soil degradation and failing 
yields.</li> 
<li>A lot of wood is also needed to cure tobacco leaves.</li> 
<li>Tobacco uses up more water, and has more pesticides applied to it, further 
affecting water supplies. These water supplies are further depleted by the 
tobacco industry recommending the planting of quick growing, but water-thirsty 
eucalyptus trees.</li> 
<li>Child labor is often needed in tobacco farms.</li> </ul> 
<p>For more detail, refer to Big Business Poor Peoples; The Impact of 
Transnational Corporations on the World&rsquo;s Poor, by John Madeley, (Zed 
Books, 1999) ch. 4.</p> 
<h2>Tobacco smoking damages the environment</h2> 
<p>In The Tobacco Atlas; Costs to the Economy  (last accessed July 2, 2008), 
the WHO noted the impact of fires caused by smoking (10% of all fire deaths, 
killing 300,000 people, costing $27 billion).</p> 
<p>It also noted that 1987 saw the world&rsquo;s worst forest fire caused by 
cigarettes happened in China in 1987, killing 300 people, making 5,000 
homeless, and destroying 1.3 million hectares of land.</p> 
<p>This hints at the side-effects of tobacco use; costly forest fires which 
often make for sensational headlines, especially in dry, hot conditions.</p> 
<p>With increasing concern about climate change, the extra carbon dioxide 
released by such forest fires does not help.</p> 
<p>There are also other less direct impacts to the environment. For example,
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The resources required to make cigarette lighters and related products, to 
package and sell them</li> 
<li>The resources required to box and package tobacco products</li> 
<li>The resources required to employ people working in the industry, to 
advertise and market the products</li> 
<li>etc.</li> </ul> 
<p>(Many lighters are made from plastics and require a small amount of fuel. 
In the vast quanitities they are produced these small amounts of oil and 
related products that go into these can add up. As people are getting jittery 
about high oil prices, clean energy and so on, these kind of things add to 
those concerns, even if this is not seen as a priority concern.)</p> 
<p>Given that tobacco use has no benefit for society, these costs further 
highlight wasted resources. While tobacco companies are somewhat held to 
account for the additional costs to people&rsquo;s health, they are rarely held 
accountable for promoting products which have these additional consequences.</p>
<h2>Tobacco Reduces Economic Productivity</h2> 
<p>Summarizing from the WHO again:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The economic costs of tobacco use are equally devastating. In addition to 
the high public health costs of treating tobacco-caused diseases, tobacco kills 
people at the height of their productivity, depriving families of breadwinners 
and nations of a healthy workforce. Tobacco users are also less productive 
while they are alive due to increased sickness. A 1994 report estimated that 
the use of tobacco resulted in an annual global net loss of US$ 200 thousand 
million, a third of this loss being in developing countries.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&mdash; Why is tobacco a public health priority?, World Health 
Organization, December 1, 2004</p> 
<p>A report by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids says that from a 
socioeconomic and environmental perspective,there is little benefit in tobacco 
growing , and that &ldquo;While a few large-scale tobacco growers have 
prospered, the vast majority of tobacco growers in the Global South barely eke 
out a living toiling for the companies.&rdquo; Furthermore, &ldquo;the 
cigarette companies continue to downplay or ignore the many serious economic 
and environmental costs associated with tobacco cultivation, such as chronic 
indebtedness among tobacco farmers (usually to the companies themselves), 
serious environmental destruction caused by tobacco farming, and 
pesticide-related health problems for farmers and their families.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</h2> 
<p>The world&rsquo;s first global health treaty&mdash;the Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control (summary), adopted May 2003&mdash;became international law 
in February 2005.</p> 
<p>Amongst other things, the treaty requires countries to</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Impose restrictions on tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion;</li>
<li>Establish new packaging and labeling of tobacco products (e.g. ban 
misleading descriptions such as &ldquo;low tar&rdquo; and &ldquo;lights&rdquo;;)
</li> 
<li>Establish clean indoor air controls; and</li> 
<li>Strengthen legislation to clamp down on tobacco smuggling.</li> </ul> 
<p>This treaty was adopted &ldquo;despite a sustained campaign by the tobacco 
lobby via certain governments to dilute it&mdash;particularly the United 
States, Germany and Japan,&rdquo; as theBritish Medical Journal (BMJ) reported 
(&ldquo;Tobacco Lobby Threatens to Derail Global Antismoking Treaty&rdquo;, 
February 12, 2005, Volume 330, p. 325.)</p> 
<p>Furthermore, &ldquo;pressure from the industry has not let up &hellip; the 
United States proposed a clear reference to global trade rules&rdquo; 
potentially allowing companies and governments to attack the legally binding 
health treaty under trade laws, &ldquo;even though the &hellip; treaty gives 
governments the right to prioritize health over trade issues.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As the BMJ also noted, &ldquo;poor countries are now more vulnerable to the 
powerful tobacco industry and need support in implementing tough anti-tobacco 
measures.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In recent years, in wealthy countries, attempts have been made to introduce 
smoke-free legislation. In California for example, smoke-free laws were 
introduced in July 1998. As the Californian Medical Association&rsquo;s 
president, Dr. Robert Hertza commented, &ldquo;California&rsquo;s lung cancer 
rates have fallen six times faster than in US states without smoke-free 
laws.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Smoke-free workplaces would hit tobacco profits&rdquo;,BMJ
, Vol. 330, p.325) This illustrates the potential of treaties such as this 
global tobacco treaty to save lives of millions.</p> 
<p>The WHO has defined a policy approach summarized by the acronym, MPOWER, to
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies</li> 
<li>Protect people from tobacco smoke</li> 
<li>Offer help to quit tobacco use</li> 
<li>Warn about the dangers of tobacco</li> 
<li>Enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and</li> 
<li>Raise taxes on tobacco</li> </ul> 
<p>As their report (see previous link) argues, these measures are shown to 
work and have a significant effect on reducing tobacco consumption, when 
applied.</p> 
<p>In a 2008 report analyzing global tobacco use and control, the WHO finds 
that</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Only 5% of the global population is protected by comprehensive national 
smoke-free legislation and 40% of countries still allow smoking in hospitals 
and schools;</li> 
<li>Only 5% of the world&rsquo;s population lives in countries with 
comprehensive national bans on tobacco advertising and promotion;</li> 
<li>Just 15 countries, representing 6% of the global population, mandate 
pictorial warnings on tobacco packaging;</li> 
<li>Services to treat tobacco dependence are fully available in only nine 
countries, covering 5% of the world&rsquo;s people;</li> 
<li>Tobacco tax revenues are more than 4000 times greater than spending on 
tobacco control in middle-income countries and more than 9000 times greater in 
lower-income countries. High- income countries collect about 340 times more 
money in tobacco taxes than they spend on tobacco control.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Tobacco Industry Hitting Back</h2> 
<p>The tobacco companies have tried various ways to minimize damage impact to 
their sales and reputation. They have sought to expand markets in other areas, 
especially the Third World as they find the First World slowly but increasingly 
hostile to their industry. Attempts at regulation are fought with various 
public relations attempts, and corruption.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Four companies now control 75 percent of global cigarette sales, as 
sophisticated strategies for supply, production and sales have produced 
increasingly popular global brands.</p> 
<p>The onward march of Marlboro man epitomises this globalisation, exploiting 
the opportunities presented by trade liberalisation, regional organisations and 
the communications revolution. Control efforts are undermined by the 
industry&rsquo;s success in developing favourable relationships with many 
governments, the magnitude of their foreign direct investments and the scale of 
advertising, marketing and sponsorship campaigns. In addition, large-scale 
cigarette smuggling, which comprises one-third of total exports, depletes tax 
revenues and further jeopardises public health.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&mdash; Controlling the global tobacco epidemic. Towards a transnational 
response, ID21 Insights, March 2001</p> 
<h3>Expanding Third World Markets</h3> 
<p>In recent years, the damage caused to a person&rsquo;s health by tobacco 
consumption has been confirmed, attracted particular scrutiny at tobacco firms 
because they knew this for years, but attempted to hide their research.</p> 
<p>Some countries, such as the US have had the resources and political will to 
tackle the large tobacco corporations. However, combined with the resulting 
smaller and tougher markets in the rich countries, multinational tobacco firms 
have intensified their efforts in other regions of world such as Asia, to 
continue growing and selling cigarettes, as well as expanding advertising (to
<em>create</em> demand, not meet). And they have been successful, too. 84% of 
the estimated 1.3 billion smokers live in developing and transitional economy 
countries as the WHO has noted.</p> 
<h3>Targeting Children, Teenagers and Women</h3> 
<p>Almost understandably, tobacco companies are compelled to target the young 
and women.</p> 
<p>Teenagers are future consumers often highly impressionable and in some 
societies with significant disposable income; for any company where brand and 
consumption of their products are important, attracting younger members of 
society increases the chances of longer term lock-in.</p> 
<p>With the tobacco industry, ironically perhaps, as their products kill their 
customers (or as customers try to quit), they need to find newer consumers. 
Younger people will take a longer time to die or quit, thus increasingly the 
likelihood of continued sales.</p> 
<p>Women generally smoke a lot less than men, everywhere. It can be deadly to 
unborn children, too. However, tobacco companies see women as an untapped 
market where there is more potential to increase consumption than with men.</p> 
<p>So, unchecked and profit being the natural motive for the tobacco 
companies, children and women are natural target consumers.</p> 
<p>For their 2008 World No Tobacco Day event, the WHO noted that &ldquo;Most 
people start smoking before the age of 18, and almost a quarter of these 
individuals begin using tobacco before the age of 10.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>An example of how self-regulation had failed was provided by a documentary 
about British American Tobacco pushing tobacco to children in Africa, produced 
by theBBC (which aired in July 2008).</p> 
<p>It noted how BAT&rsquo;s own guidelines to stop selling to children in 
various ways were clearly ignored by itself in places such as Mauritius, 
Nigeria and Malawi. From selling single sticks (which is intended to target 
children), to advertising and promotions of the sort readily banned in most 
countries, to organizing events and popular concerts heavily branded with 
BAT&rsquo;s logos and products, all pointed to BAT encouraging young people, as 
young as 8 or 10, to smoke.</p> 
<p>(A separate BBC article also summarizes this documentary in more detail.)
</p> 
<p>Another area where children are increasingly smoking is India. A survey by 
the WHO found thatnearly 17% of students in India aged 15 and under use some 
form of tobacco, most of them cigarettes. While public bans on smoking had some 
positive effects, this rise has been a concern, and the study urged that more 
be done to tackle advertising.</p> 
<h3>Public Relations and WHO-Discrediting Campaigns</h3> 
<p>The tobacco industry has gone to extraordinary levels to discredit the 
World Health Organisation and others that are fighting tobacco issues, a WHO 
report charges.</p> 
<p>A Committee of Experts had been set up in October 1999 to &ldquo;inquire 
into the nature and extent of undue influence which the tobacco industry had 
exercised over UN organisations.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This Committee produced the report that &ldquo;found that the tobacco 
industry regarded the World Health Organization as one of their leading 
enemies, and that the industry had a planned strategy to &lsquo;contain, 
neutralise, reorient&rsquo; WHO&rsquo;s tobacco control initiatives.&rdquo; 
They added that the tobacco industry documents show that they carried out their 
plan by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Staging events to divert attention from the public health issues raised by 
tobacco use;</li> 
<li>Attempting to reduce budgets for the scientific and policy activities 
carried out by WHO;</li> 
<li>Pitting other UN agencies against WHO;</li> 
<li>Seeking to convince developing countries that WHO&rsquo;s tobacco control 
program was a &ldquo;First World&rdquo; agenda carried out at the expense of 
the developing world;</li> 
<li>Distorting the results of important scientific studies on tobacco;</li> 
<li>Discrediting the WHO as an institution.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Corruption</h3> 
<p>PAHO, the Pan American Health Organization (a regional office for the 
Americas for the WHO) issued a report titledProfits over People (17 December 
2002). Looking at the Latin American and Caribbean countries and information 
from Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, the report details how the 
tobacco companies:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Were intensely competitive but collaborated in campaigns against common 
threats to the industry</li> 
<li>Hired scientists throughout the region to misrepresent the science linking 
secondhand smoke to serious diseases, while cloaking in secrecy any connection 
of these scientists with the tobacco industry;</li> 
<li>Designed &ldquo;youth smoking prevention&rdquo; campaigns and programs 
primarily as public relations exercises aimed at deterring meaningful 
regulation of tobacco marketing;</li> 
<li>Had detailed knowledge of smuggling networks and markets and actively 
sought to increase their share of the illegal market by structuring marketing 
campaigns and distribution routes around it; and</li> 
<li>Enjoyed access to key government officials and succeeded in weakening or 
killing tobacco control legislation in a number of countries.</li> </ul> 
<p>They also added that &ldquo;these tactics and strategies are not unique to 
the Americas region.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Tobacco Companies Accused of Attempting to Undermine Tobacco Treaty</h3> 
<p>The non-governmental organization, Corporate Accountability International, 
reports thatthe tobacco industry is interfering with health policy around the 
world . The report summarized as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Thailand&rsquo;s case stands out as an impressive example of a developing 
country successfully overcoming years of powerful tobacco industry interference 
in health policy [by putting in place effective tobacco advertising bans]. In 
Nigeria, Big Tobacco is using its economic muscle to try to keep treaty 
ratification off the table for discussion by manipulating media coverage and 
influencing government agencies. Guatemala&rsquo;s current situation 
exemplifies the need for Article 5.3 of the WHO FCTC&mdash;requiring parties to 
the treaty to protect public health policy from industry interference&mdash;and 
the importance of being vigilant to interference throughout the implementation 
process. The case of Guatemala also illustrates a new variation of old tobacco 
industry tricks, where Big Tobacco tries to pull the wool over 
policymakers&rsquo; eyes by advocating &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; while drafting 
legislation that actually weakens or conflicts with the tobacco treaty.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>&mdash; Big Tobacco&rsquo;s Attempts to Derail the Global Tobacco Treaty , 
Corporate Accountability International, October 6, 2005</p> 
<p>In Africa&rsquo;s most populous nation (thus an attractive potential market 
for tobacco firms), Nigeria, the report was very critical of British American 
Tobacco (BAT):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In Nigeria BAT&rsquo;s tactics to undermine health policies include 
attempting to bribe journalists with cash prizes for favorable media coverage 
and giving expensive gifts to regulatory agencies and government officials. The 
combination of a misinformed public and easily influenced government is a 
proven recipe for weak, corporate-friendly regulations.</p> 
<p>Media is a top target in BAT&rsquo;s efforts to misinform Nigerians. The 
corporation hosts expensive meals for media owners and editors, sponsors 
journalist association meetings, syndicates articles favoring corporate 
interests and tobacco products, and leverages its advertising power to stop the 
publication of critical articles.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&mdash; Big Tobacco&rsquo;s Attempts to Derail the Global Tobacco Treaty , 
Corporate Accountability International, October 6, 2005</p> 
<p>But there is corruption at government levels, for they target government 
officials too, the report added. &ldquo;Common BAT tactics to influence 
government officials include intense lobbying and expensive gifts.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In Guatemala, the report accuses Philip Morris/Altria and BAT of 
&ldquo;trying to stall or derail Guatemala&rsquo;s treaty process&rdquo; which 
goes against the tobacco Framework treaty which requires that the tobacco 
industry does not interfere with government policies.</p> 
<p>For further information in this area, see also the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Corporate Accountability International&rsquo;s Tobacco Campaign</li> 
<li>Tobacco: A Political Struggle to the Death by Gustavo Capdevila, Inter 
Press Service (IPS), May 31, 2006</li> 
<li>Tobacco Treaty Gains Hard-Fought Ground by Isaac Baker, IPS, October 25, 
2005</li> </ul> 
<p>Reports such as those mentioned above show that there is a lot of political 
maneuvering by large tobacco companies to lower prices, to increase sales, etc. 
In addition, the poor and small farmers are the ones most affected by the 
impacts of tobacco companies. The hard cash earned from this &ldquo;foreign 
investment&rdquo; is offset by the costs in social and public health and the 
environment. In effect, profits are privatized; costs are socialized.</p> 
<h2>Wasted wealth, resources and labor</h2> 
<p>While the tobacco industry no doubt provides jobs for many people around 
the world, the total negative effects of the industry and of smoking tobacco 
suggests that this is &ldquo;wasted wealth&rdquo; and &ldquo;wasted 
labor.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Talented scientists and business people currently employed by this industry 
could potentially be working in other areas contributing to society in a more 
positive way, while agricultural workers could potentially be producing less 
damaging products, for example.</p> 
<p>As noted earlier, wastage also occurs in the form of deaths from fires, the 
environmental damage caused by forest fires started by cigarettes, the 
resources needed to package, distribute, and employ people in the tobacco 
industry, the resources needed to create additional products such as cigarette 
lighters, promotional materials, etc.</p> 
<p>In a way, there is also the extra cost of anti-tobacco campaigns! Arguably, 
without the excessive promotion by the tobacco industry, much time and 
resources would not have to be devoted by the World Health Organization and 
other campaigners on raising these issues; other concerns could then be given 
more attention.</p> 
<p>While people have attempted to hold tobacco companies to account for the 
health burden they introduce, they are rarely held to account for these other 
forms of waste.</p> 
<p>(Wasted wealth and wasted labor and wasted resources are discussed in more 
depth later in this site&rsquo;s section on consumption and consumerism.)</p> 
<p>Note that this does not have to be an authoritarian ban, as free choice is 
still a treasured value. Instead:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>True costing of tobacco (factoring in health, environment and social 
costs, as well as additional economic costs that might be externalized) would 
increase the cost of tobacco products to a higher and more realistic value.</li>
<li>That could help pay for dealing with the various damages. It may 
potentially deter those whose &ldquo;free&rdquo; choice has been influenced by 
the numerous public relations, advertising and propaganda of the tobacco 
industry. (Some countries such as the UK do add taxes onto cigarettes, but 
largely to only cover health costs.)</li> 
<li>Enormous PR related resources would be freed up for other needs, such as 
helping the tobacco industry clean up, diversifying into other areas, etc.</li> 
<li>Heavily-burdened health services would additionally free up, thus leading 
to a potentially &ldquo;snow-balling&rdquo; series of positive effects.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>A lot of this is perhaps wishful thinking, as the tobacco industry would 
lose out a lot, and no industry would like that. Their size, power and thus 
influence, means that they will (and have) hit back in many ways to dilute 
effective action.</p> 
<h2>Free choice?</h2> 
<p>It is often argued by those who prefer to smoke and not see more and more 
restrictions put in place that it is their free choice to smoke. Some will add 
that they do not smoke in front of children, etc and thus sound responsible.</p>
<p>Yet, on the one hand how free a choice is it to decide to smoke? 
Advertising, peer pressure, modern culture, stress all combine to give reasons 
for people to smoke.</p> 
<p>A documentary about British American Tobacco pushing tobacco to children in 
Africa, produced by the BBC, tried to ask shareholders at an annual meeting 
what they thought: one smugly responded that he was for free choice and happy 
that the questioner lived in a society where he was free to ask such questions. 
In other words, the &ldquo;free&rdquo; choice to smoke was equated with the 
notion of freedom. This was just a regurgitation of marketing from tobacco 
companies that promoted similar messages decades earlier. The irony that this 
person &ldquo;freely&rdquo; commented this and had not possibly been influenced 
by such marketing, perhaps subconsciously, was not noted!</p> 
<p>Furthermore, it may seem like a free choice to only harm oneself when 
deciding to smoke, but second hand smoking also kills.</p> 
<p>And perhaps more remote than that is people half way around the world may 
be going hungry because land that could have been growing and sustaining local 
people is now diverted into environmentally damaging and wasteful tobacco 
production.</p> 
<p>If one does not wish to give up smoking because it is considered free 
choice, how about quitting smoking so others may have a choice?</p>

<p>HEALING US, Skin Conditions</p> 
<h2>Carcinogenic Beauty</h2> 
<p>No Comments 04 September 2011</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<h1>Carcinogenic Beauty</h1> 
<h3><strong></strong><br>
<strong>A Close Look At Health &amp; Beauty Aids
</strong></h3> 
<h3><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor<br>

<strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></h3> 
<p><strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong>(Healingtalks) The skin is the 
largest organ of the body</strong>and it&nbsp; has been shown that 60% of what 
is applied to the skin enters the blood stream, so long as the skin is allowed 
to breathe. That fact has impact in at least four ways:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>SKIN AS AN ENTRYWAY</strong> &ndash; The skin is an important 
entryway for chemicals to the body.</li> 
<li><strong>AVOIDING SKIN-APPLIED CHEMICALS</strong> &ndash; Unwanted 
chemicals, such as those shown to contribute to cancer, birth defects, 
allergies, or other sensitivities, need to be avoided in products applied to 
the skin, as they may have a negative effect on the body as a whole.</li> 
<li><strong>ALLOWING SKIN TO BREATHE</strong> &ndash; The skin must be allowed 
to breathe in and out, in order to take in nutrients and release toxins.</li> 
<li><strong>FEEDING THE SKIN</strong> &ndash; When nutrients are applied to 
the skin, they may be beneficial to the entire body.</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>Common unwanted chemicals as cosmetic ingredients<br>
</strong>
</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h3><strong>Mineral oils and petroleum</strong></h3> </li> </ul> 
<p>Mineral oil is used in baby oil, baby creams, and baby lotions; it is the 
most popular moisturizing ingredient in commercial hand and body lotions, face 
creams, suntan creams, shaving creams, lipsticks, and all kinds of ointments 
and moisturizers. Manufacturers like it because it is colorless, odorless, 
tasteless, very inexpensive, and readily binds other cosmetic ingredients into 
a smooth, creamy lotion. It softens skin by holding water in.<strong>Mineral 
oil is derived from petroleum</strong> and smells like petroleum when heated. 
It is a relative of petrolatum (petroleum jelly), also a petroleum derivative, 
which is thicker and semisolid. Untreated and mildly treated mineral oils are 
known to be a human carcinogen (see U.S. National Toxicology Program&rsquo;s 
Tenth Report on Carcinogens). Mineral oil and petrolatum form an oily film over 
skin to lock in moisture, but trap in toxins and wastes and hinder<strong>
normal skin respiration</strong> by keeping oxygen out.</p> 
<p><strong>Propylene glycol</strong>, another cosmetic form of mineral oil, is 
sometimes found in high concentrations (up to 50%) in baby lotions, pre- and 
after-shave lotions, moisturizers, foundation creams and mascaras, deodorants, 
lipsticks, and suntan lotions. Propylene glycol is a<strong> strong skin 
irritant</strong> that can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage. 
According to Ruth Winter (<em>A Consumer&rsquo;s Dictionary of Cosmetic 
Ingredients</em>, 1999 ed.), propylene glycol&rsquo;s &ldquo;use is being 
reduced, and it is being replaced by safer glycols such as butylene and 
polyethylene glycol&rdquo; (p. 363). In the same edition of this book, Winter 
states that ingestion of butylene glycol may cause renal damage, kidney 
failure, and death (p. 99). Propylene glycol is widely used because it is an 
effective humectant which holds moisture in the skin, and it is inexpensive.</p>
<ul> 
<li> 
<h3>Parabens</h3> </li> </ul> 
<p>Parabens come in many varieties and are the most widely used preservatives 
for health and beauty aids.<strong>Only water and propylene glycol are more 
common in cosmetics.</strong> You will find the parabens toward the end of the 
ingredients list, most often as<strong>butyl-, ethyl-, methyl-, or 
propylparaben.</strong> According to <em>State of the Evidence 2004</em>, 
published by the Breast Cancer Fund, parabens are &ldquo;endocrine-disrupting 
compounds1 used as preservatives in . . . cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical 
products. . .<strong>Parabens have been shown to have estrogenic activity
</strong>2 and have been found in breast tumors&rdquo; (p. 59). Some 
researchers believe that parabens are also present in cosmetics preserved with 
citrus seed extracts; although the parabens are not listed on the ingredients 
labels, the citrus seeds themselves may have been sprayed with them or other 
preservatives prior to the extraction process, thus concentrating the 
preservative in the extract.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h3><strong>Phthalates</strong></h3> </li> </ul> 
<p>These chemicals rarely find their way onto an ingredients list, but they 
are present in many health and beauty products just the same. Wherever you see 
&ldquo;perfume&rdquo; or &ldquo;fragrance,&rdquo; phthalates are present, 
because they are used to preserve these synthetic scents. Recent studies have 
shown that<strong>phthalates may be mutagenic</strong>, carcinogenic, and 
adversely affect male sperm, that they increase levels of testosterone and 
estrogen in humans, and are central to breast cancer risk. They are an 
ingredient in nail polish and other lacquers, and in soft plastics (e.g., 
infant chew toys).</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h3>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)</h3> </li> 
</ul> 
<p><strong>SLS is well known as a common skin irritant</strong> which is 
rapidly absorbed and retained in eyes, brain, heart, and liver. SLS is the most 
widely used detergent and foaming agent used in shampoos, cleansers, and 
toothpastes. Its cousin, SLES, has shown itself to be less irritating than SLS. 
We believe both these substances should be avoided, because of the possibility 
of their reacting with other product ingredients to form dioxins and 
nitrosamines3. &ldquo;Dioxin is an endocrine (hormone) disrupting chemical 
linked to several types of cancer, birth defects, learning disabilities, 
infertility, endometriosis and suppression of the immune system&rdquo; (<em>
State of the Evidence</em>, p. 59). Nitrosamines are known for their 
carcinogenic properties. SLS and SLES should be especially avoided in baby 
shampoos.4</p> 
<p>One or more of the above chemicals is present in the vast majority of 
personal care products found in the United States. The European Union is 
currently taking steps to disallow certain of these chemicals and others from 
sale within their borders. They are requiring that a potential carcinogen or 
endocrine disrupting compound be proven<em>non-toxic</em> before it may be 
used&mdash;the opposite of the U.S. policy, which requires proof of<em>toxicity
</em> before a call for removal. Some well known American cosmetic companies 
are responding by changing the formulas of their cosmetics sold in Europe, but 
not in the U.S. or elsewhere.</p> 
<p>There is another widely used category often added to cosmetics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h3><strong>Sunscreens</strong></h3> </li> </ul> 
<p>To screen or not to screen? We know that UV exposure increases the risk of 
skin cancer and causes aging of the skin. Now, however, there is growing 
concern that some chemicals in<strong>conventional sunscreens are causing 
estrogenic activity</strong> and accumulating in fat tissue (are lipophilic) in 
wildlife and humans. They are also thought to retard the production of 
epidermal growth factor, which is needed to repair photo-damage and maintain 
healthy skin. Meanwhile, be sure to wear a good hat.</p> 
<h3><strong>What to do?</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>&nbsp;Read ingredients labels</strong>. If you avoid the above 
four, you will make a good start in eliminating the most common toxins. You may 
find other ingredients that you yourself are sensitive to and will want to 
avoid in the future.</li> 
<li><strong>Think twice before deciding to use cosmetic products containing 
known toxins</strong>. Do you need to dye your hair, use nail polish, colognes 
and perfumes?</li> 
<li><strong>Find a list of American cosmetics companies that have signed the 
pledge to remove known toxins</strong> from their U.S. products, not just those 
sold in the E.U. Patronize these companies; avoid the others. (See:www.EWG.org 
and the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics.)</li> 
<li><strong>Keep yourself informed of new studies as research is completed
</strong>. We will refer to them in future newsletters, and by mid-August will 
have references and links on our web site.</li> 
<li><strong>Take an inventory of the toxins in your cosmetics cupboard</strong>
 and replace those products with healthy alternatives.</li> </ul>

<h2>Shocking Truth About Store-Bought Orange Juice</h2> 
<p>No Comments 29 August 2011</p> <br>

<h1>Hugely Shocking Truth</h1> 
<h1>About Store-Bought</h1> 
<h1>Orange Juice</h1> <strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> If you buy orange juice 
at the store, you may lean towards the kind that advertises itself as &ldquo;
<strong>100 percent orange&nbsp;juice</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo; <strong>not 
made from concentrate</strong>&rdquo;. But have you ever wondered why every 
glass of it tastes exactly the same? That&rsquo;s because the flavor of 
store-bought orange juice has more to do with chemistry than nature.<strong>
Industrially-produced orange juice</strong>, after the oranges are squeezed, is 
stored in giant holding tanks and the oxygen is removed from them, which allows 
the liquid to keep for up to a year without spoiling. It also makes the juice 
completely flavorless. So the industry uses &ldquo;flavor packs&rdquo; to 
re-flavor the juice. 
<p><strong>According to Food Renegade:</strong></p> 
<p>&ldquo;Juice companies therefore hire flavor and fragrance companies 
&hellip; to engineer flavor packs to add back to the juice to make it taste 
fresh.<strong>Orange flavor packs</strong> aren&rsquo;t listed as an ingredient 
on the label because technically they are derived from orange essence and oil. 
Yet those in the industry will tell you that the flavor packs, whether made for 
reconstituted or pasteurized orange juice, resemble nothing found in 
nature.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>More of the Undisclosed Truth</h3> 
<p>The ins and outs of <strong>mass-produced orange juice&nbsp;</strong>are 
explained in&nbsp;Squeezed: What You Don&rsquo;t Know About Orange Juice
.&nbsp;The book contains&nbsp;a potent reminder of&nbsp;the importance 
of&nbsp;understanding how your food is manufactured and processed. The label 
tells neither the whole story nor the whole truth. &ldquo;<strong>Not from 
concentrate</strong>&rdquo; does not mean less processed.<em>&ldquo;The 
technology of choice at the moment is<strong>aseptic storage</strong>, which 
involves stripping the juice of oxygen, a process known as &ldquo;<strong>
deaeration</strong>,&rdquo; so it doesn&rsquo;t oxidize in the million gallon 
tanks in which<strong> it can be kept for upwards of a year. </strong></em>
<strong><em>When the juice is stripped of oxygen it is also stripped of 
flavor-providing chemicals.</em></strong><em> Juice companies therefore hire 
flavor and fragrance companies, the same ones that formulate perfumes for Dior 
and Calvin Klein, to engineer flavor packs to add back to the juice to make it 
taste fresh.&rdquo;</em>The reason you don&rsquo;t see any mention on the label 
about added flavors is because these flavors are derived from orange essences 
and oils. However, the appearance of being natural doesn&rsquo;t necessarily 
mean it is. As Hamilton states:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Those in the industry will tell 
you that the flavor packs, whether made for reconstituted or pasteurized orange 
juice, resemble nothing found in nature.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
&nbsp;Industrial produced orange juice in North America tends to contain high 
amounts of<strong>ethyl butyrate</strong>, which is one of the most commonly 
used chemicals in both flavors and fragrances. Aside from being versatile in 
creating a number of different flavors, including orange, cherry, pineapple, 
mango, guava, and bubblegum, just to name a few, it&rsquo;s also one of the 
least expensive. Other markets, such as the Mexican and Brazilian, tends to 
contain different chemicals, such as various<strong>decanals or terpene 
compounds</strong>.</p> 
<h3><strong>Why Many Natural Physicians Do Not Recommend Commerically-Produced 
Fruit Juices</strong></h3>  They may 
<ul> 
<li>Contain hidden chemicals not disclosed on the label</li> 
<li>Have very high fructose content, like cans of soda</li> 
<li>Are pasteurized to devitalize vitamins and other nutrients</li> </ul> 
<p>Fructose has been identified as a major culprit in the&nbsp;vast rise of 
obesity and a long list of related health problems.</p> 
<h3><strong>Health Dangers of Excessive Fructose Consumption</strong></h3>  
Not only will fructose raise your insulin to high levels, it also metabolizes 
differently from other sugars and in a way togreatly &nbsp;promote chronic 
diseases. According to&nbsp;researchers likeDr. Robert Lustig, and Dr. Richard 
Johnson, we know that: 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Fructose metabolized into <em>fat.</em></strong></li> 
<li><strong>Fructose consumption leads to weight gains</strong> as it turns 
off your body&rsquo;s appetite-control system. Fructose does not appropriately 
stimulate insulin, which in turn does not suppress ghrelin (the &ldquo;hunger 
hormone&rdquo;) and doesn&rsquo;t stimulate leptin (the &ldquo;satiety 
hormone&rdquo;), which together result in your eating more and developing 
insulin resistance. It decreased HDL, increased LDL, elevated triglycerides, 
elevated blood sugar, and high blood pressure&mdash;i.e., classic metabolic 
syndrome. For example, in one study, eating fructoseraised triglyceride levels 
by 32 percent in men.</li> 
<li><strong>Fructose consumption&nbsp;leads to insulin resistance</strong>, 
which is not only an underlying factor of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, 
but also many cancers.</li> 
<li><strong>Fructose contributes to the development of gout</strong> by 
increasing the levels of uric acid in your body. In onestudy, published last 
year, women who drank 12 ounces or more of orange juice a day doubled their 
risk of gout, and those who drank just six ounces of juice per day still 
increased their risk by 41 percent. Asimilar study on men was published in 2008
. In that study, men who drank two or more sugary soft drinks a day had an<em>
85 percent</em> higher risk of gout than those who drank less than one a month. 
Fruit juice and fructose-rich fruits such as oranges and apples also increased 
the risk.</li> </ul> 
<p>It is thus important to <strong>watch the extent of fructose consumption
</strong>, even with whole fruits, and not just processed juices.</p> 
<h3>Fructose as Major Health Hazard</h3> 
<p>According to&nbsp;recent research, uric acid in the body appears to 
increase with fructose consumption and takes a lead role in creating major 
health problems &ndash; especially when it reaches levels of 5.5 mg per dl or 
higher in your body. At this level,<strong>uric acid is associated with an 
increased risk for developing high blood pressure</strong>, as well as 
diabetes, obesity and kidney disease. He believes the ideal range for uric acid 
lies between 3 to 5.5 mg per dl, so getting your uric acid levels tested can 
further help you determine just how strict you need to be with limiting your 
fructose consumption.</p>

<p>Gray Hair, HEALING US</p> 
<h2>GRAY HAIR FACTS</h2> 
<p>No Comments 15 August 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Gray Hair Facts</h1> 
<p>By Guest Writer: Sarika Periwal</p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if we could 
just sail through life without having to worry about gray hair; if we could 
have the same head of hair &ndash; healthy, shiny, with its natural pigment 
&ndash; in our later years that we enjoyed in our youth?</p> 
<p>Alas this is not to be, and we all have to contend with grey hair appearing 
on our heads; some rather sooner than others.</p> 
<p>While for many of us, it is the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s that evince the 
first signs of hair going grey, for others, the gray starts off in the 
30&rsquo;s. For an increasing number this appearance of the first gray hair can 
be as early as the teens or early 20&rsquo;s. So what does make the hair lose 
color?</p> 
<h2>What Makes Hair Lose Its Color?</h2> 
<p>The follicle of the hair is responsible for imparting color to the hair 
shaft, because of the pigment (color) that it contains. As and when the melanin 
production decreases or ceases due to the pigment dying, the hair begins to 
lose its color. So gray hair is not really gray, but actually colorless.</p> 
<h2>Factors That Influence Hair Color</h2> 
<p>There are several factors that influence hair color:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Heredity</strong> &ndash; This is the most important factor that 
determines how and when a person starts to grey. If one&rsquo;s parents and 
grandparents started to have grey hair early, chances are that that person will 
as well. Since this is largely determined by one&rsquo;s genes a person should 
have a fairly good idea of when he or she will start to go grey. If in a family 
a given person started to age really early and was, say, completely gray by age 
25, then there is a good chance that that person&rsquo;s child will as well.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Ethnicity</strong> can also indicate the time when one will start 
to silver. There are some racial patterns observed here &ndash; white people 
tend to go grey during their mid 30&rsquo;s, Asians do so a little later in 
their late thirties and black people tend to do so only when they reach their 
mid 40&rsquo;s.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Lifestyle factors</strong> &ndash; Smoking is known to be really 
bad for health for a great many different reasons, and one of the many reasons 
not to smoke is gray hair.<strong>Smoking is known to reduce melanin production
</strong> and hence speed up the graying process.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Medical conditions</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Certain 
medical conditions such<strong>pernicious anemia</strong> can cause melanin 
production to decrease.<strong>Thyroid deficiency</strong> can also cause hair 
to go gray. Stress is another reason for hair to literally go gray. Though it 
may be an old wives&rsquo; tale that a traumatic event or grief turned 
someone&rsquo;s hair gray overnight, it is true that<strong>stress, grief, life 
altering events and anxiety</strong> can contribute to the graying process. 
Also certain<strong>medications</strong> are thought to aggravate or cause hair 
to go grey.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Environmental factors</strong>&ndash; Toxins and pollution in the 
environment is also thought to contribute to the process of hair turning gray 
according to some experts. It is thought that pesticides and other chemicals 
that enter our system through our food and the environment, could contribute to 
the graying process.<strong>Related Article:</strong></li>

<h2>Secondhand Smoke: Another Reason To Quit Smoking Cigarettes</h2> 
<p>No Comments 10 August 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Secondhand Smoke:</h1> 
<h1>Another Reason</h1> 
<h1>To Give Up Cigarettes</h1> 
<p><strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<h2>Basics</h2> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Around 1.3 billion people smoke cigarettes 
worldwide. Statistically, the average smoker smokes around 30 cigarettes a day. 
A cigarette is made from cut up tobacco leaves that are rolled up and smoked. 
Cigarettes do not only cause health problems for the person smoking them, but 
also for the people that are around them. When a person smokes they breathe in 
the cigarette smoke, and then blow out the smoke. The smoke that is blown out 
by the smoker is called second hand smoke.</p>

<li>Asthma and Secondhand Smoke &ndash; PDF</li> </ul> 
<h2>Secondhand Smoke Exposure</h2> 
<p>The areas where people are most commonly exposed to second hand smoke 
include the workplace and the home. In the United States roughly 126 million 
people who don&rsquo;t smoke are exposed to second hand smoke. Second hand 
smoke has a number of effects on the non-smoker.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>For people who have asthma, smoke can cause severe asthma attacks.</li> 
<li>It can contribute to respiratory infections including bronchitis or 
pneumonia.</li> 
<li>Secondhand smoke can also cause heart disease and cancer leading to death 
in people who do not smoke. Heart disease can lead to heart attacks in patients 
that otherwise may not have been pre-disposed to suffering one.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Prevention for Secondhand Smoke Exposure</h2> 
<p>Preventative measures should be taken to avoid secondhand smoke. If someone 
in the household smokes inside the home, one can ask them to smoke outside. For 
people who smoke in cars, drive separately, and do not drive with people who 
smoke while driving. Avoid areas where people are smoking, if at all possible 
walk as far around them as possible to avoid exposure. If someone you are with 
is smoking, it&rsquo;s okay to say please don&rsquo;t smoke that around me.</p>

<ul> 
<li>Smokers are more likely to get heart disease, have a heart attack, or get 
cancer.</li> 
<li>There are many cancer risks involved with smoking, including lung cancer.
</li> 
<li>Not only does smoking pose the threat of health risks, it also can result 
in unwanted side effects. The cigarettes often leave the smokers&rsquo; teeth 
stained a very distinct yellow.</li> 
<li>Another unwanted effect of smoking is the odor of the smoke. The smell of 
smoke attaches itself to everything. The smokers&rsquo; hair, clothing, and 
body will smell of smoke after smoking a cigarette. Wherever the person smokes, 
it will make everything there smell like smoke. People who smoke in their car 
are likely to have a car that will smell of smoke, and the same goes for 
homes.Over the years the government on a national and on a state level has had 
laws and regulations pertaining to cigarette smoking. In public buildings 
people are not allowed to smoke. Businesses have a right to allow or deny 
smoking on their premises. More and more places today are cracking down, trying

<h2>Smoking Cessation Plans</h2> 
<p>There are a variety of smoking cessation options available for people who 
smoke and want to quit. Some of the most common methods that have been around 
awhile now include nicotine patches, and nicotine gum. These allow the body to 
have some nicotine in the system, so the person isn&rsquo;t quitting abruptly. 
Some people quit cold turkey, which means that they suddenly stop all 
cigarettes and no longer use nicotine. There are prescription drugs available 
for people to help stop smoking. Other options people can use to quit smoking 
include hypnosis, therapy, and health counseling.</p>

<h2>4 Ways to Shed Belly Fat and Protect Against Heart Failure</h2> 
<p>No Comments 07 August 2011</p> 
<h1></h1> 
<h1>Four Ways to</h1> 
<h1>Shed Belly Fat</h1> 
<p>Based on article by Deborah Kotz&nbsp; http://health.usnews.com</p> 
<h2><strong>Studies on Belly Fat and Waist Size</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> A study published&nbsp; in the journal 
<strong><em>Circulation: Heart Failure</em></strong> indicates that having a 
largewaist siZe ups your risk of heart failure, a condition that&rsquo;s often 
fatal. A second study published in the<strong><em>Journal of the American 
Medical Association</em></strong> found that exercise doesn&rsquo;t harm those 
with heart failure and could actually provide some benefits.</p> 
<p>The analysis of the belly fat research, based on data from two Swedish 
population studies, showed that<strong> being overweight or obese increased the 
risk of heart failure in men but didn&rsquo;t in women&mdash;unless they had a 
large waist size</strong>.</p> 
<p>A woman with a normal body mass index of 25 whose waist size increased by 4 
inches over the years wound up with a 15 percent greater risk of heart failure 
than those whose waist sizes remained the same. (A 5-foot, 4-inch woman who 
weighs 146 pounds has a BMI of 25.) Medical experts recommend that women 
maintain a waist size of less than 35 inches to reduce their risk of chronic 
diseases.How to measure your waist size.</p> 
<p>Where you carry your fat is largely determined by your genes.&nbsp; But 
there are certain things you can do to help redistribute fat away from your 
belly. Remember excess belly fat is so dangerous</p> 
<p>Here are the four ways to keep a fit belly:</p> 
<h2><strong>1. Exercise to shed that belly fat<br>
</strong></h2> 
<p>You can&rsquo;t exercise to spot reduce, but it will help you shed excess 
pounds &mdash; and often, the fat your body sheds first comes from your belly.
<strong>Abdominal crunches</strong> can help tone muscles to make your stomach 
look flatter, but to truly get rid of fat, you have to<strong>burn off 
abdominal fat through aerobic activity</strong>.</p> 
<h2>2. Be a mindful eater</h2> 
<p>Researchers are currently investigating whether really paying attention to 
what you eat can help redistribute body fat from your waist to your hips. 
Plenty of studies, though, have shown that mindful eating can help with weight 
loss efforts in general. We recommend.moving in the direction of eating mostly 
fruits and vegetables, thus a vegetarian/vegan diet with mostly whole, raw, 
living foods.</p> 
<h2>3. Get adequate amounts of sleep</h2> 
<p>Too little sleep (less than six hours) or too much (more than eight hours) 
results in an excess production of the stress hormone cortisol.<strong>Cortisol 
promotes the storage of fat in the belly</strong>.</p> 
<h2>4. Reduce stress</h2> 
<p>Penciling in 15 minutes a day for relaxation can also lower your cortisol 
levels, helping you shed belly fat. Deep breathing, a stroll outdoors under the 
blossoming trees, or a bubble bath can help you leave the world behind.</p> 
<p>____________________________________</p> 
<p>The following is based on comment on weight loss from Dr. Mercola&rsquo;s 
Website</p> 
<h3><strong>Number One Way to Lose Body Fat &ndash; Exercise</strong></h3> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for that six-pack physique, you need to expose the 
abdominal muscles underneath the fat. But can you really lose fat in just one 
specific area &ndash; the abdominals? It&rsquo;s unlikely, although some 
strategies may be able to do so a little.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Exercise is your number one ally in shedding unwanted body fat.</li> 
<li>It helps normalizing your insulin levels.</li> 
<li>It&nbsp; also helps you sleep better &ndash; another important factor not 
only for optimal overall health but also, as it turns out, for avoiding packing 
pounds around your midsection.</li> 
<li>I alleviates stress, so that you have less of the hormone cortisol that is 
connected to producing stomach fat.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Best Exercises For Weightloss</h3> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re exercising to achieve weight loss, you&rsquo;ll want to 
focus on weight bearing exercises, as muscle burns calories quite efficiently. 
It has been my experience that non-weight bearing exercises, like swimming and 
bicycling, are not as efficient or effective for weight loss. You will 
typically need to exercise four times as long in these activities to receive 
the same benefit of<strong>running, using elliptical machine, or using weights.
</strong></p> 
<p>Additionally, to really maximize your weight loss efforts, make sure you 
include<strong>high-intensity interval exercises</strong> and strength training 
in your program.</p> 
<p>One recent study showed that interval training can significantly enhance 
your body&rsquo;s ability to burn fat. In this study, eight women in their 
early 20s were told to cycle for 10 sets of four minutes of hard riding, 
followed by two minutes of rest. After two weeks, the amount of fat burned in 
an hour of continuous moderate cycling increased by 36 percent!</p> 
<p>An added boon of interval exercises is that it can radically decrease the 
amount of time you need to spend exercising.</p> 
<p>As far as individual exercises to target your tummy are concerned, <strong>
sit-ups and abdominal exercises</strong> that are associated with breath 
control mechanisms, such as yoga exercises, can help tighten your abdominal 
muscles.</p> 
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that there is no single 
abdominal exercise that challenges all your abdominal muscles. So you need to 
perform a<strong>variety of exercises</strong> that involve the full range of 
muscles.</p> 
<p>Another factor that is often overlooked is your back muscles. Your back 
helps you hold yourself up and your stomach in, from behind. So having strong 
back muscles, as well as abs, is essential for a flatter stomach.</p> 
<h3>Exercise and Diet Go Hand in Hand</h3> 
<p>The other, equally important, factor in helping you shed excess weight is 
to consume the most appropriate foods for your specific genetic and 
biochemistry. Remember, the foods that may be healthy for others are not 
necessarily healthy for you, and vice-versa. Determining your specific 
nutritional type is the proven way to ascertain which foods work best for you.
</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to realize that controlling your insulin levels 
is as important to optimizing your weight as it is to protecting you against 
diseases like diabetes.</p> 
<p>Why?</p> 
<p>Because when your insulin levels increase, you are telling your body to 
store carbohydrates as fat and to not release any of the stored fat. This makes 
it impossible for you to use your own stored body fat for energy.</p> 
<p>So excess refined and processed carbohydrates in your diet (such as breads 
and pasta) not only make you gain weight, they make sure you keep that weight 
on. By cutting grains and sugars from your diet, you can significantly improve 
your chances of successful weight loss.</p> 
<p>As far as nutrition to target belly fat specifically, certain dietary fats 
have actually been found to be helpful in reducing the accumulation of 
subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat.</p> 
<p>A study published in the journal Diabetes Care in July 2007 found that
<strong> diets rich in monounsaturated fats</strong> prevented the accumulation 
of both types of belly fat, without additional exercise.</p> 
<p>Foods high in monounsaturated fats include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Nuts, especially pecans</li> 
<li>Seeds</li> 
<li>Avocados</li> </ul> 
<h3>Dangerous Weightloss Options</h3> 
<p>Unfortunately, many people simply opt for what appears to be the easiest 
solution, and when it comes to excess weight around your middle, surgical 
options lik<strong>e liposuctio</strong>n or treatments such as <strong>
Lipodissolve</strong> are popular alternatives.</p> 
<p>However, you need to be aware that there are many risks involved in 
procedures like these, and they may not give you permanent results.</p> 
<p>During a Lipodissolve treatment, a chemical found in lecithin 
(phosphatidylcholine deoxycholate) is injected into fatty areas such as 
&ldquo;love handles&rdquo; and &ldquo;bra rolls,&rdquo; where it dissolves fat 
cells. But the injectable compound is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), and no long-term studies have been conducted on 
Lipodissolve&rsquo;s safety.</p> 
<p>Among the chief questions about the procedure is where the fat cells go 
once they are dissolved. Lipodissolve practitioners say the cells are excreted 
by your body naturally, but no one really knows for sure. According to the FDA, 
Lipodissolve is a &ldquo;buyer-beware situation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And when it comes to liposuction, a survey of plastic surgeons found that 
more people die during liposuction than during most other kinds of operations: 
19 deaths per 100,000 procedures. Meanwhile the generally accepted death rate 
for any kind of elective surgery is 1 in 100,000. The most common reported 
cause of death was pulmonary thromboembolism, or blood clots.</p> 
<p>There simply are no better alternatives to a healthy lifestyle if you want 
a strong and shapely body.</p> 
<h3>Can You Wake Up to a Flatter Belly?</h3> 
<p>So, what does proper sleep have to do with a flatter stomach? Researchers 
have found that all body fat is not created equal, and that holds especially 
true for belly fat. Abdominal fat has a very rich blood supply and has four 
times more cortisol receptors than other body fat.</p> 
<p>Cortisol is a stress hormone, produced by your adrenal glands in response 
to stress, but sleeping too little (less than six hours) or too much (more than 
eight hours) also results in an excess production of cortisol.</p> 
<p>The cortisol belly fat connection comes into play when you are under 
chronic stress, as cortisol tends to store unused fat that has been released by 
your body in the stress response. Since your belly fat contains large amounts 
of cortisol receptors, you may tend to gain fat in the abdominal region when 
you&rsquo;re chronically stressed or have trouble sleeping properly.</p> 
<p>For helpful tips to help you sleep well, please review my 33 secrets to a 
good night&rsquo;s sleep. And, to help combat stress &mdash; and address any 
underlying emotional issues that may cause you to lose precious sleep &mdash; I 
highly recommend the<strong>Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)</strong>. 
It&rsquo;s a simple psychological acupressure technique that is routinely used 
in my practice that can help you optimize your emotional health.</p>

the U.S., and thue new strategies to decrease young adult smoking are needed.
</p> 
<p>Researchers found that occasional smoking among teens rose from 1991 to 
2009, while heavy smoking fell significantly.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re seeing a broad national phenomenon,&rdquo; said Dr. Terry 
Pechachek, a study co-author from the Centers for Disease Control.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;With fewer cigarettes, the price effect, smoke-free policies and a 
change in the broad public awareness of risk, the heaviest patterns of use are 
becoming very rare,&rdquo; Pechachek said.</p> 
<p>But he warned against assuming that moderate smoking is safer in the 
long-run.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It is important to note that light and intermittent smoking still 
has significant health risks,&rdquo; Pechachek explained. &ldquo;We think there 
may be an emerging pattern. We may be creating a new type of smoker that may be 
more durable, that are adapting to smoke-free environments and to changing 
social norms.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Pechacek said that the high percentage of intermittent teenage smokers is 
unacceptable.</p> 
<h2><strong>Teachers and parents should not downplay the risks of teen smoking
</strong></h2> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a very risky behavior. We want to get across to 
people that although this is a positive trend, it&rsquo;s very unacceptable to 
have so many children exposing themselves to something so addictive. The 
greatest danger is minimizing the risk.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Here is more information on the study results</p> 
<h2><strong>Major Rise in Teen Casual Smoking</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>Heavy smoking was defined by enjoying more than 11 cigarettes per 
day</strong>. Moderate smoking was defined as enjoying between six to 10 
cigarettes per day. Light smoking was defined by having to five cigarettes per 
day.&nbsp; Between 1991 and 2009, heavy smoking among teenagers has decreased 
by 10 percent, from 18 to 8 percent.</p> 
<p>During this time, <strong>casual teen smoking has increased from 67 percent 
to 79 percent</strong>.</p> 
<p>No significant changes in smoking trends for African American teenagers was 
observed, but<strong>for Hispanic teenagers, the heavy smoking rate increased 
from 3.1 percent to 6.4 percent</strong>.</p> 
<h2>Risks of Teen Smoking</h2> 
<p>Smoking has different risks for people who smoke at all. By smoking, people 
have an increased risk for heart disease, heart attack, lung cancer, and other 
types of cancer. An estimated 90% of all lung cancer in males are caused by 
smoking. An estimated 80% of lung cancer in females is caused by smoking. 
Teenagers today are even more vulnerable because of the introduction of ever 
more adulterated GMO, and sugar-addictive fast foods that help create ateen 
obesity and diabetics epidemic.</p> 
<h2>Resulting Early Deaths From Smoking</h2> 
<p>According to the CDC, smoking cigarettes has contributed to an estimated 
443,000 deaths annually.</p> 
<p>Nearly one of every five deaths in the U.S. are related to smoking. Tobacco 
causes more deaths per year than Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illegal 
drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, and murders all 
combined.</p> 
<p>This study was reported in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.

<h1>How To Fight</h1> 
<h1>Teen Smoking</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<h3>Overview of Teen Smoking</h3> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Each day in the United States, 3,900 teens 
try smoking for the first time, estimates the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Don&rsquo;t allow your teen to become just another statistic. By 
talking with your teen in a frank and mature way, while setting a good example, 
you can help fight teen smoking and convince your teen to never start in the 
first place. Luckily, resources and parental support can help your teen to make 
the right choices when it comes to smoking.</p> 
<h3>Discussions with Children and Teens on Smoking</h3> 
<p>Start the discussion about smoking at a young age. The American Cancer 
Society recommends that the discussion begin with your child is only 5 or 6 
years old. Talking about thehealth and social effects of smoking should be an 
ongoing dialogue in your home so that when your child grows into a teen, your 
opinion on cigarettes has been made clear. The ACS notes that<strong>many 
children take their first puff at age 11</strong>; it&rsquo;s never too early 
to start talking about smoking.</p> 
<h3>Disclosure of the Dangers of Teen Smoking</h3> 
<p>Point out the health, social and economical dangers of smoking to your 
teen. Ask why he would want to participate in a habit that makes his clothes 
and hair smell, his body sick and his wallet empty. Ask your teen to make a 
list of the various pros and cons of smoking and to weigh the costs versus the 
gains to make the decision on smoking on his own.</p> Become an EX Smoker 
Re-learn life without cigarettes. Get a free EX&reg; quit plan.<br>

<h3>Role Play Teen Pressure to Smoke</h3> 
<p>Try role-playing exercises with your teen to ensure that she knows what to 
do in a situation where a cigarette is offered to her, suggests the American 
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Pretend to be a peer and offer your 
child a cigarette. Remember to be as convincing as another teen might be, 
trying to entice your teen by saying smoking is fun, lots of people do it and 
it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;ll become addicted. Coach your teen through the 
things he can say to politely say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and leave the situation.</p> 
<h3>Offer a Good Example By Not Smoking in a Teen Household</h3> 
<p>Offer a good example for your teen. MayoClinic.com notes that smoking is 
more prevalent among teens whose parents also smoke. To set a good example, 
make sure that you show respect for your body and health by exercising and 
eating well, not only by abstaining from smoking. This shows your teen that you 
respect your body and want to maintain good health, ideals and values that can 
be passed on to your teen.</p> 
<h3>Direct Your Teen to Online Resources</h3> 
<p>Show your teen online resources that she can read on her own time. These 
resources, like the ones found at Kids Health, a division of the Nemours 
Foundation, and the American Academy of Family Physician&rsquo;s Web site, give 
the health risks of smoking in plain terms that your teen can understand. It 
may help her to see that you&rsquo;re not the only adult who disapproves of 
smoking. See also the further articles on smoking below.</p>

<h2>Natural ways to prevent and treat Alzheimers</h2>

<h1>Natural Ways To</h1> 
<h1>Prevent and Treat</h1> 
<h1>Alzheimer&rsquo;s</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> This post is about the utter desperation 
and frustration in modern medicine when dealing with<strong>Alzheimer&rsquo;s 
disease, its treatment and prevention</strong>. Nothing allopathic or drug-wise 
seems to work.</p> 
<p>Even Nobel Laureates in physics, chemistry and medicine fall prey. No one 
knows how to stop this epidemic, at least no one who follows conventional 
routes.</p> 
<h3>Not understanding the essential nature of consciousness</h3> 
<p>The real and taproot problem is that modern science has almost no 
understanding of the<strong>essential nature of consciousness</strong> (see our 
many articles on this subject) and thus is lost. If they understand<strong>what 
is consciousness</strong> they would advocate certain naturopathic or natural 
approaches that would bankrupt Big Pharm that preys on patients who begin to 
lose their vital powers.</p> 
<h3><strong>What is consciousness?</strong></h3> 
<p>One of the half dozen or so greatest insights of my life was the discovery 
of the taproot nature of consciousness. It forms &ldquo;a universal 
relationship of connection in nature, the principle of connection itself, and 
the foundation of nature&rsquo;s oneness.&rdquo; Western civilization has a 
different dominant conception of that oneness, and of the essence of nature 
which drives allopathic medicine. It was outlined and promoted by Sir Isaac 
Newton in the 17th century, who himself died with schizophrenia and dementia 
&ndash; which is hugely telling. That vision postures mathematics, the highest 
abstractions of how to separate all elements of consciousness &ndash; and which 
guides the development of the science of chemistry and thus the designs of 
drugs. The deep insight of what really is consciousness led me to abandon the 
road of allopathic medicine &ndash; the disciple that drugs patients in nursing 
homes until they walk the halls like zombies. For the mathematical order that 
designs drugs is the polar opposite of what supports consciousness, and as not 
only the essence of nature but of our lives. It is what holds us together and
<strong>connects</strong> memories to each other.</p> 
<p>The best way thus to prevent Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is through</p> 
<ul> 
<li>An organic, whole, living foods diet &ndash; a natural diet that avoids 
synthetic chemical additives.</li> 
<li>&nbsp;Some consistent programs of whole body detoxification (including 
avoiding drugs, vaccinations, GMO foods, radiation, non-emergency surgery, 
essentially avoiding your allopathic doctor&rsquo;s main protocols), and</li> 
<li>Regular exercise and</li> 
<li>Meditations/Mind-body work</li> </ul> 
<p>What prevents and cures Alzheimer&rsquo;s undermines so much of modern 
medicine that the solutions and the finding of solutions cannot come from 
within that conventional domain.</p>

<h2>Misdiagnosed Health Problem &ndash; Candida Infection Is Overlooked</h2> 
<p>1 Comment 02 August 2011</p> 
<h1>&nbsp; Misdiagnosed</h1> 
<h1>Health Problem -</h1> 
<h1>Candida Infection</h1> 
<h1>Is Overlooked</h1> 
<p>Based on an article by James Schreiber</p> 
<p>Original version published by NaturalNews</p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Because so many of us have either been 
treated by broad-spectrum antibiotics that can disturb and kill much of&nbsp; 
the good, protective flora in our bodies, and because our modern diet makes us 
prone to compromised immune systems, candida, fungus or yeast infections has 
become pandemic. Some estimate as much as a third of the US population suffers 
from this ailment. When it sets in, it is hard to overcome on less one goes on 
a strict, low-sugar diet for months and uses an effective anti-fungal or 
anti-lower-life-form remedy.</p> 
<p>Below is a short intro originally published in natural news.</p> 
<p>Nathan Batalion CTN</p> 
<p><strong>_________________________________________<br>
</strong></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s an unfortunate truth that millions of people across the world 
suffer from seemingly unexplainable and unpleasant symptoms like chronic 
tiredness, recurring yeast infections and digestive issues. Candida infection 
might not even enter their thoughts.</p> 
<p>Fatigue, headaches, rashes, bloating and yeast infections. All these 
symptoms have been linked to an overgrowth of Candida albicans &ndash; a common 
fungal organism naturally found in each one of us as a part of our intestinal 
flora. The problems arise when we eat too much sugar, take antibiotics for a 
prolonged period of time, or have a weakened immune system.</p> 
<p>All these factors can ultimately lead to Candida infection &ndash; a 
condition that plagues so many people worldwide &ndash; yet most of them are 
unaware of it due to the lack of information presented in the mainstream media.
</p> 
<h2><strong>What Causes Candida Overgrowth?</strong></h2> 
<p>Candida infection can occur when there&rsquo;s an imbalance between good 
and bad bacteria in the digestive tract. It is common knowledge nowadays that 
antibiotics kill not only the bad guys &ndash; they also eliminate the good 
ones such as bifidobacterium and acidophilus, the bacteria that keep Candida 
under control. Another common culprit is a diet high in simple carbohydrates 
and sugars &ndash; good bacteria thrive on fiber, while the cells of Candida 
albicans feed on glucose.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Candidiasis has been around for decades,&rdquo; explained Carolyn 
Dean, M.D., N.D. in her article published on NaturalNews. &ldquo;Ever since we 
began to use antibiotics but neglected to replace the good bacteria that are 
destroyed along with the bad.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2><strong>Treatment of Candida Infection</strong></h2> 
<p>Once the good bacteria are wiped out, there are several things patients can 
do to restore bacterial dominance in the intestinal tract. First off, 
it&rsquo;s usually necessary to make certain dietary changes. That means 
following a healthy, low-glycemic diet plan that doesn&rsquo;t nourish Candida 
and other pathogens in the body. Green vegetables, low-glycemic fruits, seeds, 
nuts, and high-quality organic animal proteins all work for a Candida-fighting 
diet.</p> 
<p>Dietary modifications like these can bring relief quite quickly, but some 
people suffering from Candida infection will need more thorough treatment that 
involves probiotics and natural antifungal supplements. Probiotics help 
replenish the healthy bacteria in your gut, and antifungals work on the 
principle of destroying the Candida cells.</p>

<h2>America&rsquo;s Most Dangerous Pills</h2> 
<p>No Comments 30 July 2011</p> 
<h2></h2> 
<h1>America&rsquo;s Most</h1> 
<h1>Dangerous Pills</h1> 
<p>By Christopher Byron, The Fix</p> 
<p>You could argue that the deadliest &ldquo;drug&rdquo; in the world is the 
venom from a jellyfish known as the Sea Wasp, whose sting can kill a human 
being in four minutes&mdash;up to 100 humans at a time. Potassium chloride, 
which is used to trigger cardiac arrest and death in the 38 states of the U.S. 
that enforce the death penalty is also pretty deadly . But when it comes to 
prescription drugs that are not only able to kill you but can drag out the 
final reckoning for years on end, with worsening misery at every step of the 
way, it is hard to top the benzodiazepines. And no &ldquo;benzo&rdquo; has been 
more lethal to millions of Americans than a popular prescription drug called 
Klonopin.</p> 
<h2>Klonopin</h2> 
<p>Klonopin is the brand name for the pill known as clonazepam, which was 
originally brought to market in 1975 as a medication for epileptic seizures. 
Since then, Klonopin, along with the other drugs in this class, has become a 
prescription of choice for drug abusers from Hollywood to Wall Street. In the 
process, these Schedule III and IV substances have also earned the dubious 
distinction of being second only to opioid painkillers like OxyContin as our 
nation&rsquo;s most widely abused class of drug.</p> 
<h2>Stevie Nicks&rsquo; story</h2> 
<p>Seventies-era rock star Stevie Nicks is the poster girl for the perils of 
Klonopin addiction. In almost every interview,&nbsp;the former lead singer of 
Fleetwood Mac&nbsp;makes a point of mentioning the toll her abuse of the drug 
has taken on her life. This month, while promoting her new solo album,<em> In 
Your Dreams,</em> she told Fox that she blamed Klonopin for the fact that she 
never had children. &ldquo;The only thing I&rsquo;d change [in my life] is 
walking into the office of that psychiatrist who prescribed me Klonopin. That 
ruined my life for eight years,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;God knows, maybe I 
would have met someone, maybe I would have had a baby.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Nicks checked herself into the Betty Ford Clinic in 1986 to overcome a 
cocaine addiction. After her release, the psychiatrist in question prescribed a 
series of benzos&mdash;first Valium, then Xanax, and finally 
Klonopin&mdash;supposedly to support her sobriety. &ldquo;[Klonopin] turned me 
into a zombie,&rdquo; she told<em>US Weekly</em> in 2001, according to the 
websiteBenzo.org, one of many patient-run sites on the Internet offering 
information about benzodiazepine addiction, withdrawal and recovery.&nbsp;Nicks 
has described the drug as a &ldquo;horrible, dangerous drug,&rdquo; and said 
that her eventual 45-day hospital detox and rehab from the drug felt like 
&ldquo;somebody opened up a door and pushed me into hell.&rdquo; Others have 
described Klonopin&rsquo;s effects as beginning with an energized sense of 
euphoria but ending up with horrifying sense of anxiety and paralysis, akin 
to&nbsp; sticking your tongue into an electric outlet, or suddenly feeling that 
your brain is on fire.</p> 
<h2>A little history of Klonopin&rsquo;s use</h2> 
<p>When benzodiazepines first came to market in the 1950s and 1960s, they were 
prescribed for a range of neurological disorders such as epilepsy as well as 
anxiety related disorders such as insomnia. But over time, a loophole in 
federal drug-control laws known as the &ldquo;practice of medicine 
exception&rdquo; has permitted psychiatrists and other physicians to prescribe 
the drugs for any perceived disorder or symptom imaginable, from panic attacks 
to weight control problems. Much in the same way, Valium became infamous as 
&ldquo;mother&rsquo;s little helper,&rdquo; a sedative used to pacify a 
generation of bored and frustrated suburban housewives.</p> 
<h2>Klonopin used by addicts</h2> 
<p>Alcoholics and drug addicts are most likely to run into Klonopin during 
detox, when it is used to prevent seizures and control the symptoms of acute 
withdrawal. Klonopin takes longer to metabolize and passes through your system 
more slowly than other benzos, so in theory you don&rsquo;t need to take it so 
frequently. But if you like the high it gives you, and&nbsp; keep increasing 
your dosage, the addictive effects of the drug accumulate quickly and can often 
be devastating. The drug&rsquo;s label clearly specifies that it is 
&ldquo;recommended&rdquo; only for short-term use&mdash;say, seven to 10 
days&mdash;but once exposed to the pill&rsquo;s seductive side-effects, many 
patients come back for more. And not surprisingly, many doctors are happy to 
refill prescriptions to meet this consumer demand. In the process, countless 
numbers of people swap one addiction for another, often worse than the initial 
addiction they were trying to treat. Although benzodiazepines are rarely 
reported to be the cause of single-drug overdoses, they show up with great 
frequency in deaths from so-called combined drug intoxication, or CDI.</p> 
<h2>Death of celebrities due to Klonopin use</h2> 
<p>In recent years there have been thousands of deaths caused by this lethal 
combination. The drug has also help hasten the death of a wide list of 
otherwise healthy celebrities. In 1996, Actress Margaux Hemingway committed 
suicide by overdosing on a barbiturate-benzodiazepine cocktail. Weeks later, 
Hollywood movie producer Don Simpson (<em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>) also died 
from an unintentional benzo-based overdose. Klonopin was one of 11 different 
prescription drugs&mdash;all written by the same doctor&mdash;found in the body 
of<em>Playboy</em> centerfold model Anna Nicole Smith, who OD&rsquo;d in 
2007.&nbsp;Thereafter, the well-known Los Angeles author, David Foster Wallace, 
who was suffering from a profound depression when a doctor prescribed him 
Klonopin, went into his backyard on a September evening and hanged himself with 
a leather belt he had nailed to an overhead beam on his patio. Klonopin has 
been striking down more than just troubled celebrities, however. In 2008, 
reports began to surface of soldiers returning from Iraq with post-traumatic 
stress disorder who were dying in their sleep, the victims of a psych-med 
cocktail of Klonopin, Paxil (an antidepressant), and Seroquel, an antipsychotic 
that is routinely prescribed by VA hospitals</p> 
<h2>Emergency room admissions due to benziduazepine abuse</h2> 
<p>Hospital emergency room visits for benzodiazepine abuse now dwarf those for 
illegal street drugs by a more than a three-to-one margin. This trend has been 
increasing for at least the last five years. In 2006, the U.S. 
government&rsquo;s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
published data showing that prescription drugs that year were the number two 
reason for ER admissions to hospitals for drug abuse, slightly behind illicit 
substances like heroin and cocaine. But a survey released by the agency earlier 
this year claims that benzos, opioids and other prescriptions meds are now 
responsible for the majority of drug-related hospital visits.</p> 
<h2>Understanding Klonopin and what it does</h2> 
<p>Scientists can&rsquo;t say for sure what Klonopin does when ingested, 
except that it dramatically affects the functioning of the brain. This much we 
know: If your brain is on fire with electrical signals&mdash;like, say, 
you&rsquo;re having an epileptic seizure&mdash;a dose of clonazepam will help 
put out the flames.&nbsp; It does so by lowering the electrical activity of the 
brain,&nbsp; specifically which electrical activities it suppresses is 
something that no one really seems to know for sure. And therein lies the 
reason why clonazepam, like nearly the entire class of benzos, causes such 
unpredictable reactions in people. Put simply, the brain is just too complex a 
structure for its owners to understand&mdash;and when you start monkeying 
around with the way it functions, it&rsquo;s anybody&rsquo;s guess what is 
going to happen next.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the respected neurosurgeon Frank Vertosick, Jr., describes 
the brain in his book<em>When The Air Hits Your Brain: Parables of Neurosurgery:
</em> &ldquo;The human brain: a trillion nerve cells storing electrical 
patterns more numerous than the water molecules of the world&rsquo;s 
oceans.&rdquo;&nbsp;So, if clonazepam is given to a patient with a history of 
epileptic seizures, it is likely to bring the symptoms under control. But give 
the same drug to a person suffering from a completely different problem (an 
eating or sleeping disorder, for example), and it might actually<em>cause</em> 
an epileptic seizure.</p> 
<p>Clonazepam has wreaked such havoc on people partly because it is so highly 
addictive; anyone who takes it for more than a few weeks may well develop a 
dependence on it. As a result, you can be prescribed Klonopin as a short-term 
treatment for, say, insomnia, and wind up so hooked on it that you&rsquo;ll 
begin frantically &ldquo;doctor shopping&rdquo; for new prescriptions if the 
first physician who gave it for you refuses to renew the prescription.&nbsp;As 
with all benzos, use of Klonopin for more than a month can lead to a dangerous 
condition known as &ldquo;benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome,&rdquo; featuring 
elevation of a user&rsquo;s heart rate and blood pressure along with insomnia, 
nightmares, hallucinations, anxiety, panic, weight loss, muscular spasms or 
cramps, and seizures.</p> 
<h2>Other benzos that greatly harm</h2> 
<p>Along with Klonopin, here are the three other benzos that, by general 
agreement, have made it into the top ranks of the world&rsquo;s worst and most 
widely abused drugs: temazepam, alprazolam, and lorazepam.</p> 
<p><strong>Temazepam:</strong> Sold in the U.S. under the brand name 
Restoril,&nbsp;this benzo was developed and approved in the 1960s as a 
short-term treatment for insomnia. It is basically what is commonly called a 
&ldquo;knockout drop.&rdquo; Taken even in relatively modest dosages, temazepam 
can produce a powerfully hypnotic effect that numbs users and makes them 
extremely compliant and susceptible to control. But thanks to the 
&ldquo;practice of medicine exception&rdquo; physicians can prescribe it for 
anything they want.</p> 
<p>During the Cold War, the Soviet Union reportedly used temazepam extensively 
to keep political dissidents in a drugged-out state in government-run 
psychiatric hospitals. Both the CIA and the KGB are also said to have also used 
the sleeping pill in prisoner interrogations and in research into mind-control, 
brainwashing and social engineering.</p> 
<p>Temazepam is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;date rape&rdquo; drug, and 
it figures frequently in drug-related crimes of violence. In the drug world 
underground, where it is&nbsp;often sold as an alternative to heroin and crack 
cocaine, it goes by such&nbsp;street names as &ldquo;tams,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Vitamin T,&rdquo; &ldquo;terminators,&rdquo; &ldquo;big T,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;mind eraser&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mommy&rsquo;s Big Helper.&rdquo; Common 
side-effects include confusion, clumsiness, chronic drowsiness, impaired 
learning, memory and motor functions, as well as extreme euphoria, dizziness 
and amnesia.</p> 
<p><strong>Alprazolam</strong>: Brand name Xanax, this benzo now accounts for 
as many as 60% of all hospital admissions for drug addiction,&nbsp;according to 
some research.&nbsp;What&rsquo;s more, violent and psychotic responses to Xanax 
are not limited to humans. In May 2009, a 200-lb chimpanzee being kept as a 
house pet by a Stamford, Conn., woman went on a rampage after being dosed with 
Xanax, escaping into the neighborhood and ripping off the face of a friend of 
its owner.</p> 
<p><strong>Lorazepam:</strong> Brand name Ativan, this drug has figured in an 
array of well-publicized homicides and suicides by those using it. Ativan 
surfaced in the 2000 divorce case between Washington, D.C., socialite Patricia 
Duff and her husband, Wall Street billionaire Ronald Perelman. In deposition 
testimony, Perelman acknowledged taking Ativan as an anti-anxiety drug during 
his separation from Duff and the commencement of divorce proceedings. The 
period was marked by numerous outbursts by Perelman and at least two physical 
assaults on Duff. In 2008, news reports revealed that Ativan was being used by 
the U.S. Customs Service to keep suspected terrorists sedated while deporting 
them to detention facilities abroad.</p> 
<p>You can buy any of these &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; drugs without a 
doctor&rsquo;s signature by simply typing the name into any Internet search 
engine. Instantly, you&rsquo;ll be presented with dozens of websites, both 
foreign and domestic, where you can make your purchase, no prescription 
required. (Most of the websites accept all major credit cards.)</p> 
<h2>Why has this happened?</h2> 
<p>In large measure you can thank the 47,000 members of the American 
psychiatric profession for this dreadful state of affairs. Neither the 
pharmaceutical industry nor the psychiatric profession would be anywhere near 
as lucrative as they are today without their mutual support system. Together 
they have created a marketing juggernaut that over the last 20 years has 
spawned a seemingly nonstop gusher of profits that is only now beginning to 
slow&mdash;and probably only temporarily.</p> 
<p>The scholarly journals of the psychiatric profession were filled with early 
warnings, beginning almost 50 years ago, from those who could see where the 
encroaching influence of the drug companies was destined to lead the 
profession. Now, even the medical journals themselves have been corrupted by 
the hidden hand of Big Pharma. In 2008, the<em>New York Times</em> reported 
that a survey of the six top medical journals showed that on average almost 8% 
of the bylined articles published in their pages were ghostwritten by freelance 
writers, then published under the names of cooperating doctors and researchers 
to give the pro-drug messages contained in the articles the appearance of 
impartiality. The scheme is bankrolled, of course, by the company that makes 
the drug.</p> 
<h2>The great bipolar disorder con</h2> 
<p>Consider Dr. Joseph Biederman, the world-renowned Harvard University 
psychiatrist and father of modern psychopharmacology for children, who, it now 
turns out, has been taking secret &ldquo;consulting fees&rdquo; from drug 
companies for years.&nbsp;Biederman is widely credited with legitimizing the 
concept of &ldquo;bipolar disorder&rdquo; as a chemical imbalance in the brain 
that can be corrected with psychiatric drugs. But documents uncovered by Senate 
investigators probing ties between the psychiatric profession and the drug 
industry, which have resulted in an explosion in medically approved uses for 
psychiatric drugs for children, show that Biederman received more than $1.6 
million in undisclosed payments since 2000 from the pharmaceutical companies 
manufacturing the drugs he was encouraging parents to give to their children if 
they appeared to be &ldquo;bipolar.&rdquo;</p> 
<h2>Taking advantage of the unaware public</h2> 
<p>No surveys that I am aware of have ever been conducted regarding the 
public&rsquo;s impression of what psychiatrists actually do. But from pop 
culture media characters such as the fictional female psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer 
Melfi in the HBO series<em>The Sopranos,</em> the general belief seems to be 
that psychiatrists are learned and humane professionals who counsel their 
patients through hour-long &ldquo;talk therapy&rdquo; sessions in their offices 
once a week, and more frequently than that if necessary to help them resolve 
their conflicts.</p> 
<p>In fact, many do nothing of the sort. It may be only a patient&rsquo;s 
first session with a psychiatrist that lasts any meaningful amount of time. In 
this initial consultation the psychiatrist relies on the DSM manual as the 
diagnostic tool to decide precisely what the patient suffers from. Once that is 
established, the psychiatrist can begin prescribing psych meds as therapy, free 
of fear about the danger of a medical malpractice suit lurking down the road.
</p> 
<p>The follow-up sessions (weekly, monthly, etc.) that come after the initial 
consultations&mdash;that is, the sessions that are portrayed on<em>The Sopranos
</em> as the occasions when Mafia killer Tony Soprano sits down in Dr. 
Melfi&rsquo;s darkened office and pours out his guts about his troubled 
childhood&mdash;usually last as little as 15 minutes. During these so-called 
&ldquo;med checks,&rdquo; a psychiatrist typically charges $100 or more for 
asking the patient little more than how he or she is responding to the 
prescribed medication&mdash;a question that can usually be answered by a quick 
glance at the patient&rsquo;s demeanor.</p> 
<p>At the end of such a med-check, the psychiatrist may decide to renew the 
patient&rsquo;s current prescription, substitute or add a new one&mdash;or even 
offer the patient a free sample of some new psych-med, courtesy of a sales rep 
from a pharmaceutical company. At four med-checks per hour, a psychiatrist with 
enough patients to fill up his workdays can easily make $120,000 annually from 
his med-check practice alone and still take a month-long summer vacation.</p> 
<h2>Are doctors on the Big Pharma take?</h2> 
<h2>You bet and big time</h2> 
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious that this system incentivizes doctors financially to 
keep prescribing drugs in order to keep patients returning for med-checks. But 
Big Pharma offers a whole host of additional income opportunities.&nbsp;Last 
year, ProPublica, the Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning public-interest 
investigative website, did an extensive report on the financial compensation 
drug companies shower on physicians. Well-titled &ldquo;<strong>Dollars for Docs
</strong>,&rdquo; this series included a database of more than 17,000 doctors 
who accepted &ldquo;speaker fees&rdquo; and other money from eight drug 
companies in 2009 and 2010 totaling $320 million.</p> 
<p>That accounting is only the tip of the iceberg, however, as most 
pharmaceutical companies have refused to disclose their physician payments. Not 
surprisingly, most doctors interviewed by ProPublica denied that their medical 
decisions and prescribing habits were influenced by drug company payments. The 
new healthcare reform bill calls for greater transparency, requiring all 
drug-makers to disclose all fees paid to all doctors by 2014. Until then, you 
can type your doctor&rsquo;s name into thedatabase to find out if he or she is 
on the pharma take, and for how much.</p>

<p>HEALING US, Smoking, Stop Smoking</p> 
<h2>What is really in a cigarette?</h2> 
<p>No Comments 22 July 2011</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h1>What is really</h1> 
<h1>in a Cigarette?</h1> 
<p><strong><em>by K. H. Ginzel, M.D. </em></strong></p> 
<h3><strong>Most Outstanding&nbsp;Ingredient in a Cigarette</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> For those who still don&rsquo;t know 
&mdash; let me emphatically state that cigarette smoking is a true addiction! 
To grasp this well-documented fact, one really doesn&rsquo;t have to study all 
the supporting scientific evidence. One simply needs to consider that no other 
drug is self-administered with the persistence, regularity and frequency of a 
cigarette. At an average rate of ten puffs per cigarette, a one to three 
pack-a-day smoker inhales 70,000 to 200,000 individual doses of mainstream 
smoke during a single year. Ever since its large scale industrial production 
early in this century, the popularity of the modern cigarette has been 
spreading like wildfire. Here is the first, and perhaps the most significant 
answer to the title question:<em><strong>Addiction is in a cigarette</strong>
</em>. Probing into what makes a cigarette so irresistible, we find that much 
of the recent research corroborates earlier claims: It is for the nicotine in 
tobacco that the smoker smokes, the chewer chews, and the dipper dips. Hence,
<em><strong>nicotine is in a cigarette</strong></em>.</p> 
<h3><strong>Nicotine and Much More in What&rsquo;s in a Cigarette</strong></h3>
<p>In contrast to other drugs, nicotine delivery from tobacco carries an 
ominous burden of chemical poisons and cancer-producing substances that boggle 
the mind. Many toxic agents are in a cigarette. However, additional toxicants 
are manufactured during the smoking process by the chemical reactions occurring 
in the glowing tip of the cigarette. The number is staggering: more than 4,000 
hazardous compounds are present in the smoke that smokers draw into their lungs 
and which escapes into the environment between puffs.</p> 
<h3><strong>Cigarette&rsquo;s Concentrated Pollution of Lungs</strong></h3> 
<p>The burning of tobacco generates more than 150 billion tar particles per 
cubic inch, constituting the visible portion of cigarette smoke. According to 
chemists at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, cigarette smoke is 10,000 times 
more concentrated than the automobile pollution at rush hour on a freeway. The 
lungs of smokers, puffing a daily ration of 20 to 60 low to high tar 
cigarettes, collect an annual deposit of one-quarter to one and one-half pounds 
of the gooey black material, amounting to a total of 15 to 90 million pounds of 
carcinogen-packed tar for the aggregate of current American smokers. Hence,<em>
<strong> tar is in a cigarette</strong>.</em></p> 
<h3><strong>Cigarette&rsquo;s Air Pollution</strong></h3> 
<p>But visible smoke contributes only 5-8% to the total output of a cigarette. 
The remaining bulk that cannot be seen makes up the so-called vapor or gas 
phase of cigarette &ldquo;smoke.&rdquo; It contains, besides nitrogen and 
oxygen, a bewildering assortment of toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide, 
formaldehyde, acrolein, hydrogen cyanide, and nitrogen oxides, to name just a 
few. Smokers efficiently extract almost 90% of the particulate as well as 
gaseous constituents (about 50% in the case of carbon monoxide) from the 
mainstream smoke of the 600 billion cigarettes consumed annually in the U.S. In 
addition, 2.25 million metric tons of sidestream smoke chemicals pollute the 
enclosed air spaces of homes, offices, conference rooms, bars, restaurants, and 
automobiles in this country. Hence,<em> <strong>pollution is in a cigarette
</strong>.</em></p> 
<p>In addition, there is the chemical burden from sidestream smoke, afflicting 
smokers and non-smokers alike. Based on the reported concentrations in 
enclosed, cigarette smoke-polluted areas, the estimated intakes of nicotine, 
acrolein, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde peak at 200, 130, 
75, 7, and 3 times the ADI, respectively. The high exposure to acrolein is 
especially unsettling. This compound is not only a potent respiratory irritant, 
but qualifies, according to current studies, as a carcinogen.</p> 
<h3><strong>Illnesses That Follow Smoking</strong></h3> 
<p>The witch&rsquo;s brew of poisons invades the organs and tissues of smokers 
and nonsmokers, adults and children, born as well as unborn, and causes cancer, 
emphysema, heart disease, fetal growth retardation and other problems during 
pregnancy. The harm inflicted by all other addictions combined pales in 
comparison. Smoking-related illness, for example, claims in a few days as many 
victims as cocaine does in a whole year. Hence,<em><strong>disease is in a 
cigarette</strong></em>.</p> 
<h3><strong>Limited Regulation of Cigarette Toxins and Carcinogens</strong>
</h3> 
<p>The irony is that many of the poisons found in cigarette smoke are subject 
to strict regulation by federal laws which, on the other hand, specifically 
exempt tobacco products. &ldquo;Acceptable Daily Intake,&rdquo; ADI, is the 
amount of a chemical an individual can be exposed to for an extended period 
without apparent detriment to health.</p> 
<p>Regulatory policy aims at restricting exposure to carcinogens to a level 
where the lifetime risk of cancer would not exceed 1 in 100,000 to 1,000,000. 
Due to a limited database, approximate upper lifetime risk values could be 
calculated for only 7 representative cigarette smoke carcinogens. The risk 
values were extraordinarily high, ranging from 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 16. Because 
of the awesome amount of carcinogens found in cigarette smoke and the fact that 
carcinogens combine their individual actions in an additive or even 
multiplicative fashion, it is not surprising that the actual risk for lung 
cancer is as high as one in ten. Hence,<em><strong>cancer is in a cigarette
</strong></em>.</p> 
<p>Among the worst offenders are the nitrosamines. Strictly regulated by 
federal agencies, their concentrations in beer, bacon, and baby bottle nipples 
must not exceed 5 to 10 parts per billion. A typical person ingests about one 
microgram a day, while the smokers&rsquo; intake tops this by 17 times for each 
pack of cigarette smoked. In 1976, a rocket fuel manufacturer in the Baltimore 
area was emitting dimethylnitrosamine into the surrounding air, exposing the 
local inhabitants to an estimated 14 micrograms of the carcinogen per day. The 
plant was promptly shut down. However eagerly the government tries to protect 
us from outdoor pollution and the carcinogenic risk of consumer products, it 
blatantly suspends control if the offending chemical is in, or comes from, a 
cigarette. Hence,<em><strong>hypocrisy is in a cigarette</strong></em>.</p> 
<p>But there is still more in a cigarette than addiction, poison, pollution, 
disease, and hypocrisy. A half century of aggressive promotion and 
sophisticated advertising that featured alluring role models from theater, film 
and sport, has invested the cigarette with an enticing imagery.</p> 
<h3><strong>Deceit and Death in Cigarettes</strong></h3> 
<p>Imagery which captivates and seduces a growing youngster. The youngster, 
indispensable for being recruited into the future army of smokers, does not 
start to smoke cigarettes for the nicotine, but for the false promises they 
hold. Hence, deceit is in a cigarette.</p> 
<p>In summary, no drug ever ingested by humans can rival the long-term 
debilitating effects of tobacco; the carnage perpetuated by its purveyors; the 
merciless irreversibility of destiny once the victim contracts lung cancer or 
emphysema; the militant denial on the part of those who, with the support of 
stockholders and the sanction of governments, legally push their lethal 
merchandise across borders and continents killing every year two and one-half 
to three million people worldwide. All things added together:<em><strong>death 
is in a cigarette</strong></em>.</p>

University of Arkansas. His work is concentrated in the area of nicotine and 
its effects.</p>

<h2>Fluoride Damages Brain</h2> 
<p>No Comments 12 July 2011</p> <br>

<h1>Fluoride Damages Brain</h1>  SOURCE NYS Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation 
<p>&ldquo;The prolonged ingestion of fluoride may cause significant damage to 
health and particularly to the nervous system,&rdquo; concludes a review of 
studies by researchers Valdez-Jimenez, et al. published in<em> Neurologia</em> 
(June 2011), reports New York State Coalition Opposed to Fluoridation, Inc. 
(NYSCOF).</p> 
<p>The research team reports, &ldquo;It is important to be aware of this 
serious problem and avoid the use of toothpaste and items that contain 
fluoride, particularly in children as they are more susceptible to the toxic 
effects of fluoride.&rdquo; (1)</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Fluoride can be toxic by ingesting one part per million (ppm), and 
the effects are not immediate, as they can take 20 years or more to become 
evident,&rdquo; they write.</p> 
<p>Most fluoridating U.S. public drinking water suppliers add fluoride 
chemicals to deliver 1 ppm fluoride (equal to about 1 milligram per quart) 
intending to benefit teeth and not to purify the water.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Fluoridation clearly jeopardizes our children and must be 
stopped,&rdquo; says attorney Paul Beeber, President, NYSCOF. &nbsp;&rdquo;We 
can actually see how fluoride has damaged children&rsquo;s teeth with dental 
fluorosis; but we can&rsquo;t see the harm it&rsquo;s doing to their brains and 
other organs. No U.S. researcher is even looking,&rdquo; says Beeber.</p> 
<p>Valdez-Jimenez, et al. describe studies that show fluoride induces changes 
in the brain&rsquo;s physical structure and biochemistry which affects the 
neurological &nbsp;and mental development of individuals including cognitive 
processes, such as learning and memory.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Fluoride is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, which may 
cause biochemical and functional changes in the nervous system during 
pregnancy, since the fluoride accumulates in brain tissue before birth,&rdquo; 
they write.*</p> 
<p>Animal studies show fluoride&rsquo;s toxic brain effects include classic 
brain abnormalities found in patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, 
Valdez-Jimenez&rsquo;s team reports.</p> 
<p>A different research team (Tang et al.) reported in 2008 that &ldquo;A 
qualitative review of the studies found a consistent and strong association 
between the exposure to fluoride and low IQ.&rdquo; (<em>Biological Trace 
Element Research</em>) &nbsp;(2)</p> 
<p>In 2006, the U.S. National Research Council&rsquo;s (NRC) expert fluoride 
panel reviewed fluoride toxicology and concluded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s apparent 
that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the 
brain.&rdquo; And, &ldquo;Fluorides also increase the production of free 
radicals in the brain through several different biological pathways. These 
changes have a bearing on the possibility that fluorides act to increase the 
risk of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.&rdquo; (3)</p> 
<p>On April 12, 2010, <em>Time</em> magazine listed fluoride as one of the 
&ldquo;Top Ten Common Household Toxins&rdquo; and described fluoride as both 
&ldquo;neurotoxic and potentially tumorigenic if swallowed.&rdquo; (4)</p> 
<p>Phyllis Mullenix, Ph.D., was the first U.S. scientist to find evidence that 
fluoride damages the brain. She published her animal study in a respected 
peer-reviewed scientific journal in 1995 (5) and then was fired for doing so.(6)
</p> 
<p>Vyvyan Howard, M.D., Ph.D., a prominent fetal toxicologist and 
past-President of the International Society of Doctors for the Environment, 
said that current brain/fluoride research convinces him that we should stop 
water fluoridation.</p> 
<p>Many communities have stopped or rejected fluoridation in the past several 
years &nbsp;&ndash; the most recent is Fairbanks, Alaska. &nbsp;This year, 
seven New York City Council Members co-sponsored legislation to stop 
fluoridation in NYC</p>

<h2>US Releases Graphic Images To Deter Smoking</h2> 
<p>No Comments 22 June 2011</p> <br>

<h1>U.S. Releases</h1> 
<h1>Graphic Images to</h1> 
<h1>Deter Smokers</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p>(<strong>Healingtalks)</strong> Federal health officials released on 
Tuesday their final selection of nine graphic warning labels to cover the top 
half of cigarette packages beginning next year, over the opposition of tobacco 
manufacturers.</p> 
<h3>First Major Change in Cigarette Warning Labels</h3> 
<p>In the first major change to warning labels in more than a quarter-century, 
thegraphic images will include photos of horribly damaged teeth and lungs and a 
man exhaling smoke through a tracheotomy opening in his neck. TheDepartment of 
Health and Human Services selected nine color images among 36 proposed to 
accompany larger text warnings.</p> 
<p>Health advocacy groups praised the government plan in the hope that images 
would shock and deter new smokers and motivate existing smokers to quit. The 
images are to cover the upper half of the front and back of cigarette packages 
produced after September 2012, as well as 20 percent of the space in cigarette 
advertisements.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;These labels are frank, honest and powerful depictions of the health 
risks ofsmoking, and they will help encourage smokers to quit, and prevent 
children from smoking,&rdquo; Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and 
human services,said Tuesday in a statement.</p> 
<h3>Tobacco Companies&rsquo; Reactions</h3> 
<p>The four leading tobacco companies were all threatening legal action, 
saying the images would unfairly hurt their property and free-speech rights by 
obscuring their brand names in retail displays, demonizing the companies and 
stigmatizing smokers.</p> 
<p>The government won one case last year in a federal court in Kentucky on its 
overall ability to require larger warning labels with images; the specific 
images released Tuesday are likely to stir further legal action. The Kentucky 
case is before the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</p> 
<h3>Mandate for Change</h3> 
<p>The new labels were required under landmark antismoking legislation giving 
the Food and Drug Administration power to regulate, but not ban, tobacco 
products. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act required F.D.A. 
action on the graphic warning labels by Wednesday, two years after President 
Obamasigned it into law.</p> 
<p>The United States was the first nation to require a health warning on 
cigarette packages 45 years ago. Since then, at least 39 other nations, 
including Canada and many in Europe, have imposed more eye-catching warnings, 
including graphic photos.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This is a critical moment for the United States to move forward in 
this area,&rdquo; the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, said in an 
interview. &ldquo;The trends in smoking really support the need for more action 
now. For four decades, there was a steady decline in smoking, but five to seven 
years ago we leveled off at about the 20 percent level of adult and youth 
smoking in this country.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Will Save Lives</h3> 
<p>Dr. Lawrence R. Deyton, director of the F.D.A.&rsquo;s Center for Tobacco 
Products, said the government estimates, based on other countries&rsquo; 
experience, that the new warning labels will prompt an additional 213,000 
Americans toquit smoking in 2013, the first full year with the graphic labels.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the images they picked,&rdquo; said Nancy Brown, 
chief executive of the American Heart Association. &ldquo;They strongly depict 
the adverse consequences of smoking. They will get people&rsquo;s attention. 
And they will certainly be much more memorable than the current warning 
labels.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Gregory N. Connolly, a professor and tobacco expert at the Harvard School 
of Public Health, also praised the strength of the warnings, but said the 
F.D.A. needed to take tougher action against cigarettes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on 
the pack is important, but if you really want to cut smoking rates, 
you&rsquo;ve got to get inside the pack and deal with ingredients likementhol 
andnicotine,&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<h3>Images Chosen</h3> 
<p>The nine images chosen in the United States include some that are among the 
most graphic of the 36 draft images. But they also include some of the less 
vivid, including a cartoon depiction of a baby rather than a photo in the draft 
set that showed a mother blowing smoke at a baby. The images, which are to 
appear on cigarette packs on a rotating basis, also include one of a man 
proudly wearing a T-shirt that says: &ldquo;I QUIT.&rdquo; All of the packs 
will also display a toll-free telephone number for smoking cessation services.
</p> 
<h3>New Text Warnings</h3> 
<p>The F.D.A. has already proposed nine text warnings to be paired with the 
images, including: &ldquo;Warning: Cigarettes causecancer&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Warning: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your 
health.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Survey Testing</h3> 
<p>The government surveyed 18,000 Americans of all ages to determine which of 
the 36 proposed labels would be most effective to deter smoking. The F.D.A. can 
revise the selection of images in the future. A few smokers surveyed on New 
York sidewalks were unswayed by the images. Khariton Popilevsky, 46, a 
pawnbroker, shrugged and said: &ldquo;Telling me things we already know. 
I&rsquo;ll still be smoking.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Hayley Sapp, 28, a paralegal, said: &ldquo;There are lots of other high 
risks out there, you know.Obesity is huge.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Saiful Islam, 34, a convenience store clerk, said higher prices would cut 
sales a lot more than the images on cigarette packs.</p> 
<h3>More Industry Reactions</h3> 
<p>A submission to the F.D.A. by R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard and Commonwealth 
Brands, the second, third and fourth largest United States cigarette makers, 
said the &ldquo;nonfactual and controversial images&rdquo; were &ldquo;intended 
to elicit loathing, disgust and repulsion&rdquo; about a legal product.</p> 
<p>Those companies and others filed suit in Kentucky in August 2009 over 
provisions of the law. Judge Joseph H. McKinley Jr. of Federal District Court 
in Bowling Green, Ky., ruled that the companies could be forced to put graphic 
warning labels on the packages but said they could not be forced to limit 
marketing materials to black text on a white background, saying that was too 
broad an intrusion on commercial free speech.</p> 
<p>Gregg Perry, a spokesman for Lorillard Tobacco, said on Tuesday that the 
company was reviewing the graphics and would not comment at this time. A 
spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds repeated its earlier opposition to the graphic 
labels. The Altria Group, the largest tobacco company in the United States, 
said it would not comment.</p> 
<p>Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, the only major tobacco company 
to support the overall F.D.A. legislation, said in a letter this year that the 
graphic warning provision was an unconstitutional part of the law &ldquo;added 
in a last-minute amendment.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Smoking Statistics</h3> 
<p>The rate of smoking in America has been cut roughly in half, to about 19 
percent, from 42 percent in 1965. Smoking remains the leading cause of 
preventable death, killing 443,000 Americans a year, according to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. Each day, the government says, an estimated 
4,000 youths try their first cigarette, and 1,000 a day become regular smokers.

<h1>Fighting Alzheimer&rsquo;s</h1> 
<h1>Naturally Is Possible</h1> 
<p><strong>Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healing Talks Editor
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease first manifests 
with a loss of short-term memory. It soon thereafter exhibits a fading of 
long-term memory as well. Can we<strong>effectively fight Alzheimer&rsquo;s
</strong> or should we just give in?</p> 
<h3>Treating Alzheimer&rsquo;s naturally</h3> 
<p>On this subject I am strongly believe that this terrible ailment of <strong>
Alzheimer&rsquo;s can be treated&nbsp; naturally</strong>.&nbsp; Drug attempts 
are wholesale failing, despite billions spent on research. At the same time 
Alzheimer&rsquo;s can be avoided, healed and even reversed by non-drug means. 
It takes a special knowledge to<strong>reverse Alzheimer&rsquo;s</strong> 
effectively. See related articles below on this subject.<em></em><strong><em>
<br> </em></strong></p> 
<p>As in fighting any chronic illness, a strongly positive attitude and 
outlook is essential. You can greatly exercise the mind, when there is a will, 
and when natural therapies are in the background as support.</p> 
<p>That is why I want to share this inspirational article with our readers. It 
appeared in the NY Times and is a&nbsp; testament to opposite human potential. 
My own dad died with Alzheimer&rsquo;s so this issue is always on the forefront 
of my mind.</p> 
<p>I hope thus that our blog posts can inspire many to get out of further 
slippage of mental powers because the positive potentials of the human mind, 
and even its recovery from illness, are really awesome.</p>

<h2>Half the Game Is Mental; So Is the Other Half</h2> 
<h6>By JOHN BRANCH</h6> 
<p>HERSHEY, Pa. &mdash; There is a narrow little room inside the sprawling 
brick tangle of Hershey High School, not far from the dual smokestacks of the 
famous chocolate company. The door is not numbered and the walls have no 
windows. A teacher named Colette Silvestri spends Thursday afternoons inside, 
leading her team in practice.</p> 
<p>She times a group of students staring hard at pieces of paper, or sometimes 
at a deck of cards or pictures of people they do not know.</p> 
<p>The students memorize all they can, usually in 15-minute stretches of 
tedious silence. Then they spill their memory to recall, say, 120 random words 
in exact order. (That is roughly the length of this article to the end of this 
sentence, but with the words shuffled.) Or maybe they will try to match 159 
unfamiliar names to photos of strangers, or recall 227 exact words, capital 
letters and punctuation of a poem read for the first time.</p> 
<p>Those are, after all, the national records held by members of the Hershey 
memory team.</p> 
<p>The 14th annual USA Memory Championship will take place at the Con Edison 
building at 14th Street and Irving Place in Manhattan on Saturday, beginning at 
8:30 a.m., and Hershey is the three-time defending champion in the high school 
division. Of the national records established in five major individual memory 
events, Hershey students hold three of them.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; said Tony Dottino, founder of the 
national competition.</p> 
<p>In his mind, memory teams are a perfect fit for high schools, given the 
studying and testing students go through. But he is frustrated that there have 
never been more than four high school teams competing at the national 
championship.</p> 
<p>There is no governing body tracking the number of teams nationwide, but the 
number is surely small. There are only a handful of teams that Mr. Dottino is 
aware of outside of the competition.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m banging my head against the wall getting more kids 
involved,&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<p>For now, the model program can be found in central Pennsylvania, planted 
there by a corporate leadership consultant named Rhonda Hess. She became a 
judge for Mr. Dottino&rsquo;s national competition in New York several years 
ago and returned home convinced that memory training would be a useful tool for 
students. She found a few willing teachers and started the Pennsylvania Memory 
Competition. The sixth annual contest, with three schools, was held in February.
</p> 
<p>Hershey won, beating its primary rival, Mechanicsburg Area High School 
(winner of the 2006 and 2007 national competitions) and Shippensburg Area High 
School. More impressive, two national records were set by a pair of 16-year-old 
Hershey juniors.</p> 
<p>Kelly Kohlman, also involved in school plays and dance, perfectly recalled 
227 words, capital letters and punctuation of a poem she had just read. Sophia 
Hu, who pole-vaults for the track team and is deaf, accurately wrote down 120 
random words in their given order.</p> 
<p>Ms. Silvestri, the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;gifted support teacher,&rdquo; is 
the coach. She talks fast and laughs easily, spilling wisdom fit for 
inspirational posters.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather put memory in a child than a computer,&rdquo; she 
said.</p> 
<p>Ms. Silvestri says she believes that memory training resurrects a holy 
trinity of old-school skills, countering the computer age with pencil and 
paper. It improves attention spans, penmanship and the ability to retain 
information, she says, all victims of technology.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Go out and touch the flowers,&rdquo; she said. 
&ldquo;Digital&rsquo;s great. But we&rsquo;re human.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>It is a sharp change of philosophy for Ms. Silvestri, whose eclectic 
background includes opera and playwriting. She was a tech-savvy former 
committee researcher for the Pennsylvania Senate when she left to teach. She 
inherited the memory team at East Pennsboro High School in 2007, and members 
wore matching shirts that read: &ldquo;Be nice to us. We never forget a 
face.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>She moved to Hershey High School for the next school year and practically 
pulled in a batch of potential mental athletes from the hallway. Her team has 
won every national championship since. Their trophies hold a prominent place at 
the school&rsquo;s main entrance.</p> 
<p>The first year, the team&rsquo;s shirts read: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call us. 
We&rsquo;ll recall you.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We had one that was &hellip; what was it?&rdquo; Ms. Silvestri said.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; Vishnu Patel, a junior, said with a 
flat-line delivery.</p> 
<p>Forgetfulness is a persistent, weary joke. Those on the memory team are 
constantly quizzed by others. Quick &mdash; what was the license plate number 
on that car? What did I wear yesterday? Teachers chide members for forgetting 
homework.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We get the brunt of a lot of jokes,&rdquo; said Vishnu, a 
cross-country runner and vice president of the junior class. &ldquo;A lot of 
jokes.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Laughter stops when other students see Vishnu or his teammates cram for, 
say, a vocabulary test.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I can remember 50 or 60 definitions that day rather than study 
it,&rdquo; Kabir Singh said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t encourage it. But it works 
for me.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Ms. Silvestri&rsquo;s squad now has 15 members. It is so deep that the 
national record holder for names and faces, the 16-year-old junior Hannan Kahn, 
will be an alternate in New York. Well-rounded skills across all events are at 
a premium in the team competition.</p> 
<p>There is no magic to Hershey&rsquo;s success. Ms. Silvestri&rsquo;s room is 
lined with bookshelves filled with books, puzzles, games, even a bust of 
Archimedes. It is lighted softly by table lamps and decorated with posters. 
(&ldquo;What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?&rdquo; one 
says.)</p> 
<p>Among the books are ones from the likes of the two-time national champion 
Ron White and Tony Buzan, founder of the world memory championships, featuring 
complicated strategies for improving memory. They are generally ignored. 
Hershey students have found their own way. Mostly, they practice at the table.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I said: &lsquo;We have technique books over here, we have brute 
force over here. What is your pleasure?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Ms. Silvestri said 
of her early practices. &ldquo;They chose brute force.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>On a recent Thursday afternoon Ms. Silvestri handed each member two decks 
of cards. One was shuffled thoroughly; the other was in perfect order, by suit 
and number, and set aside. Ms. Silvestri started a five-minute timer.</p> 
<p>Vishnu moved to the floor. He laid out nine cards in a row, and studied 
them. After a few moments he laid out seven in a row. Subsequent rows were 
smaller, down to one, then they grew again. After a couple of minutes, all of 
the cards were displayed in the shape of an hourglass. He stared.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I just lay them down and memorize their position,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The students have their own styles. Kabir finds it easier to remember 
numbers, so each card is converted into numeric code. Spades (with one stem) 
are teens, hearts (two halves) are 20s, clubs (three leaves) are 30s and 
diamonds (four points) are 40s. The three of hearts, then, is 23, and the eight 
of clubs is 38.</p> 
<p>Kelly creates an elaborate, medieval story about kings and queens. 
Sophia&rsquo;s mind translates each card into a word. She usually remembers 
most of the deck.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a story,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just picture, 
picture, picture.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But Sophia is best at random words. Starting with columns of 20 words, 
competitors have 15 minutes to memorize each column in order. Getting an entire 
column right &mdash; spelling matters &mdash; means 20 points. Missing anything 
means zero for that column.</p> 
<p>After 15 minutes, Sophia and the others were handed blank sheets on which 
to unspool their short-term memory. She silently retold the picture stories 
that connected the words in her head. With few hesitations, she scrawled down 
six columns of words &mdash; 120 of them.</p> 
<p>In the end, she made two minor mistakes that cost her points from two 
columns. She wrote &ldquo;injury&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;injure,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;deviant&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;deviate.&rdquo; The rest were perfect. 
Eighty points.</p> 
<p>The first time she practiced, a couple of years ago, Sophia got 40. Now she 
is the best in the country. That kind of progress, Ms. Silvestri said, is why 
the students do it &mdash; and why the teacher sits in the narrow little room 
after school, waiting, guiding, prodding, encouraging.</p> 
<p>The payoff comes when the children look up and realize that something 
clicked, or when they beat their personal best, or &mdash; these days &mdash; 
set a national record.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s when they ran someplace you didn&rsquo;t know 
existed,&rdquo; Ms. Silvestri said, and tears welled in her eyes. &ldquo;They 
saw further than you. That&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<h2>Addressing Stroke Risk Factors Early On To Prevent Strokes</h2> 
<p>No Comments 07 April 2011</p>

<h1>Addressing Stroke Risk</h1> 
<h1>Factors Early On</h1> 
<h1>To Prevent Strokes</h1> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> In order to prevent having a strong, it is 
only natural to discuss the so-called risk factors. Many of these are only 
gateways to real causes, so we need to look at them in this light.</p> 
<h2>Types of Risk Factors for Strokes</h2> 
<p>There presumably are three different types of risk factors that affect your 
likelihood to have a stroke. They include things that you can&rsquo;t change, 
and were essentially established at birth &ndash; like your age, gender and 
genetic. Next are things you indeed can change like lifestyle habits. Then 
there are health conditions linked to increased risk of also having a stroke. 
Another way to classify risk is by choosing those factors most commonly 
associated with having a stroke.</p> 
<h2><strong>10 Risk Factors Account For 90% of Stroke Risk</strong></h2> 
<p>This is from the findings of the <strong>Interstroke study published in 
Lancet</strong>. The study tracked 3,000 people who had strokes and compared 
them to 3,000 age and gender related individuals who did not. The participants 
came from 22 countries. The ten top factors were:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>High Blood Pressure</li> 
<li>Smoking</li> 
<li>Obesity</li> 
<li>Diabetes</li> 
<li>No Exercise</li> 
<li>Poor Diet</li> 
<li>Heavy Alcohol Use</li> 
<li>Measures of Blood Fats</li> 
<li>Heart and Artery Diseases</li> 
<li>Stress/Depression</li> </ul> 
<p>Except for having had prior heart disease, all of the other factors are 
controllable. All the factor applied to<strong>sudden ischemic strokes</strong>
, but only four applied to hemorrhagic strokes &ndash; high blood pressure, 
smoking, obesity, and diet. This kind of tells you what is most offensive 
overall.</p> 
<p>Just today I heard to the story of a woman, married to a doctor, who for 
years made her pop pills for most any condition and who recently had a stroke. 
In this light, we also recommend staying far away from taking most 
pharmaceutical chemicals long term. Natural alternatives are often more 
effective and less toxic. Drugs have their place, for short-term emergency 
uses, and then tend to get extended &ldquo;maintenance use for 
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Remember that the profit motive can systemically 
corrupt.&nbsp; Thus the link between multiple and long term drug use is almost 
never tested anywhere by the prime testers, the pharmaceutical companies. 
It&rsquo;s not good for business.</p> 
<p>But studies already link strokes to the use of birth control pills, hormone 
therapies, and illicit drugs like heroine, cocaine and methamphetamines (which 
are ok to knock down but not things sold on drugstore shelves). Consumer beware.
</p> 
<h2><strong>Are &ldquo;Factors You Can&rsquo;t Change&rdquo; Really Essential 
Risk Factors for Strokes?</strong></h2> 
<p>Here we are talking about age, gender, family history and race or ethnicity.
</p> 
<p>None of these conditions can be changed as such. But whether they are risk 
factors can. For example, if the family and ethnic tradition is to eat a lot of 
deep fried and salty foods from early on, one than veer away from those 
clutches. How old you are again matters less if your lifestyle changes.</p> 
<h2>Best Lifestyle Habits to Prevent Strokes</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>EXERCISE </strong>-&nbsp; at least 2-3 times a week</li> 
<li><strong>DIET</strong> &ndash; Veer towards at least 75% organic, living/raw
<br> whole, plant-based foods not processed commercially</li> 
<li><strong>MIND/BODY</strong> &ndash; Follow an upbeat, spiritual, or 
meditative practice</li> 
<li><strong>DETOX </strong>- Allow your body to do periodic housecleaning. 
Learn about<br>
 different detox methods.</li> </ul> 
<p>Avoid te following</p> 
<p><strong>SMOKING</strong> &ndash; Seriously kick the smoking habit</p> 
<p><strong>ALCOHOL -</strong> cut down, substitute or eliminate</p> 
<p><strong>CHEMICAL EXPOSURES</strong> &ndash; This applies to all kinds of 
chemical exposures, legal or not.</p> 
<p>In other cultures and societies strokes were relatively rare, while in our 
society them are epidemic. We can largely eliminate them in our personal lives, 
to maintain our health and vitality, by making significantly positive lifestyle 
changes.</p>

<p>HEALING US, HEALTH CONDITIONS A-Z, High Blood Pressure/ Hypertension</p> 
<h2>VARIABLE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASES RISK OF STROKES</h2> 
<p>No Comments 07 April 2011</p> 
<h2></h2> 
<h1>VARIABLE HIGH BLOOD</h1> 
<h1>PRESSURE AND STROKE RISK</h1> 
<p><strong>The research is from an article by Dr. Gabe Mirkin in his Fitness 
and Health E-Zine:<em><strong> </strong></em></strong><em> March 21, 2010</em>
</p> 
<p>Four studies in the British medical journals, <em>Lancet</em> and <em>
Lancet Neurology</em>(March 10, 2010), show that people whose blood pressures 
go up and down are up to six times more likely to suffer strokes than those who 
have more stable high blood pressures.&nbsp; The greater the variability in 
blood pressure, the higher the risk. This is astounding because doctors usually 
reassure people with intermittent high blood pressure and often do not treat 
them.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong> </strong> High blood pressure is a powerful risk factor for 
strokes and heart attacks.</li> 
<li>Lifestyle changes lower high blood pressure to markedly reduce these risks.
<strong> </strong></li> 
<li><strong> </strong>Blood pressures that vary over time markedly increase 
risk for stroke.</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>91 % of Americans will have high blood pressure during their 
lifetime!</strong></h3> 
<p>While cancer and cardiovascular ailments top the list of causes for death, 
high blood pressure probably tops the list of serious chronic ills that trigger 
a visit to a doctor.</p> 
<h3>Lifestyle changes <strong></strong>for high and variable blood pressure
</h3> 
<p>High blood pressure can be reversed and eliminated, not just controlled, 
with significant lifestyle changes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong></strong>Add lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seeds and 
nuts to the diet<strong></strong></li> 
<li><strong></strong>Reduce meat<strong>, </strong>dairy and refined sugar and 
carbohydrate intake</li> 
<li><strong></strong>Exercise regularly</li> 
<li>Begin a weight loss program if overweight<strong></strong></li> 
<li><strong></strong>Reduce of salt intake<strong></strong></li> 
<li><strong></strong>Avoid of tobacco smoke and alcohol</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>What you should do</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Buy a blood pressure cuff </strong>- Check your blood pressure 
each night before you go to bed. If your systolic blood pressure is<strong>
above 120</strong>, you have high blood pressure and are at increased risk for 
heart attacks and strokes. If your systolic blood pressure<strong>varies from 
120 to 135 or higher</strong>, you are at greater risk for a stroke. The 
greater the variance, the greater the risk</li> 
<li><strong>Make the above lifestyle changes.</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Slowly reduce the taking&nbsp; of drugs</strong> &ndash; A 
meta-analysis of 389 randomized trials involving different classes of 
anti-hypertensive medications found that calcium channel blockers were the only 
ones likely to protect against blood pressure variability, but<strong>ACE 
inhibitors</strong>, <strong>beta blockers</strong>, and <strong>angiotensin 
receptor antagonists</strong> tended to cause wide swings in blood pressure.
</li> </ul> 
<p>
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
</p> 
<p><strong>COMMENT -</strong> A problem with calcium channel blockers is that 
they are weak blood-pressure-lowerers so they almost always have to be given in 
combination with toxic drugs to become effective. We recommend slowly winding 
down drug usage (radical changes can be harmful or dangerous) and as you apply 
more of the natural approach. If you have a serious condition, be sure you make 
changes under the guidance of a health professional. See our article on<strong> 
supreme heart health</strong> for more detailed suggestions.</p> <br>

<h2>Panel Urges FDA To Review Menthol in Cigarettes</h2> 
<p>No Comments 07 April 2011</p> 
<h2></h2> 
<h1>Panel Urges F.D.A.</h1> 
<h1>to Review Menthol</h1> 
<h1>in Cigarettes</h1> 
<h6></h6> 
<p><strong>(Healingtalks)</strong> A federal advisory panel on Friday said 
removingmenthol cigarettes from the market would benefit public health in the 
United States but did not make any specific recommendation for action by the
Food and Drug Administration.</p> 
<h2>FDA Authority and Review of Cigarettes</h2> 
<p>The F.D.A will review the findings of its Tobacco Products Scientific 
Advisory Committee and perform its own research and policy study, Lawrence R. 
Deyton, director of the F.D.A. Center for Tobacco Products, said Friday after 
the advisory group wrapped up a year of study.</p> 
<p>The advisory panel&rsquo;s chairman, Dr. Jonathan M. Samet, a professor of 
medicine atU.C.L.A., said the committee had found a scientific basis for the 
added harm caused by menthol incigarettes, a decision that could provide a 
legal basis for the F.D.A. to try to limit, phase out or even ban menthol in 
cigarettes.</p> 
<p>The F.D.A., given the authority to regulate the contents of cigarettes by a 
2009 law, will make a progress report in about 90 days, Dr. Deyton said. 
&ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s up to us to do our job,&rdquo; he said.</p> 
<p>Industry analysts said they believed the F.D.A. might take a moderate final 
action.</p> 
<p>Any action, however, would pose a host of extremely difficult social and 
political issues and face a protracted legal challenge by the tobacco industry, 
which said a ban would have no public health benefit and would open up a 
criminal black market.</p> 
<h2>Menthol Cigarette Statistics</h2> 
<p>Menthol accounts for an estimated 27 percent of the $80 billion cigarette 
market in the United States and 19 million smokers &mdash; a disproportionate 
number of whom are African-Americans, younger and lower income. Menthol is 
preferred by more than 80 percent of black smokers, about 22 percent of white 
smokers, and nearly half of 12- to 17-year-old smokers.</p> 
<h2>Adverse Impact of Menthol Cigarettes</h2> 
<p>The panel, in recommendations made public on Friday morning, said evidence 
showed that menthol led to more youthsmoking, made it easier to start smoking 
and harder to quit.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on the public health in 
the United States,&rdquo; Dr. Mark Stuart Clanton, chief medical officer of the
American Cancer Society, High Plains Division, in Austin, Tex., said in 
summarizing the scientific findings.</p> 
<h2>Panel and Industry Response</h2> 
<p>The public health finding is the strongest statement yet by any government 
group in the world involving menthol flavors.</p> 
<p>Congress had banned candy, fruit and spice flavorants in tobacco but 
deferred the politically difficult issue of menthol to the F.D.A.</p> 
<p>Under the law, the panel was required to consider the impact of menthol on 
public health and the likelihood it made it easier to start or harder to quit 
smoking.</p> 
<p>Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco -Free Kids, said, 
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve shown menthol increases youth usage significantly, which 
is a trigger for action.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Any government action would be preceded by a proposed rule and another 
round of public comments and no doubt, lawsuits. Two tobacco companies filed a 
lawsuit last month to try to block the advisory committee action or force the 
F.D.A. to disregard its advice, saying panel members were biased and had 
financial conflicts of interest from legal and consulting work against tobacco 
companies, a claim the F.D.A. denied.</p> 
<p>Lorillard Tobacco of Greensboro, N.C., which is more than 90 percent 
reliant on revenue from menthol products and makes the top brand, Newport, is 
leading the opposition to F.D.A. action and one of its scientists is a 
nonvoting member of the F.D.A. panel. Jonathan Daniel Heck, Lorillard&rsquo;s 
principal scientist, issued the industry view Thursday saying there was no 
evidence that menthol promoted youth smoking or made it harder to quit.</p> 
<h2><strong>What Menthol Does and Its Marketing</strong></h2> 
<p>Menthol provides a cooling sensation that masks the harsh taste of tobacco. 
Menthol levels have been manipulated to be lower for starter products like 
Newport, according to findings of the panel based partly on industry documents. 
Industry research shows younger smokers prefer some but not too much menthol.
</p> 
<p>Dr. Dorothy K. Hatsukami, a panel member and professor from the Tobacco Use 
Research Center at theUniversity of Minnesota, said scientific literatures 
showed smokers who started younger were more likely to have trouble quitting 
and to die from smoking. &ldquo;This is the population that&rsquo;s 
particularly vulnerable to the effects of menthol cigarette smoking,&rdquo; Mr. 
Hatsukami said.</p> 
<p>Menthol has also been advertised over the years for claimed health benefits 
and it has been heavily advertised in African-American communities and 
magazines. Dr. Melanie Wakefield, an advisory panel member and director of an 
Australian research center, said menthol cigarettes continued to be marketed 
with images including the color green that falsely suggested they were 
healthier.</p> 
<p>But Lorillard said the smoking rate of African-American youth was half that 
of white youth. The company also says there was &ldquo;no difference in 
quit-smoking rates between menthol and non-menthol smokers.&rdquo; Dr. Heck of 
Lorillard dismissed the false marketing claims as artifacts of decades past 
&mdash; although Dr. Wakefield said their effect persists.</p> 
<h2><strong>Testing the FDA on the Menthol Issue<br>
</strong></h2> 
<p>More broadly, health groups say the menthol issue poses the first real test 
of the advisory committee and F.D.A. toughness against cigarettes. The 
recommendation may signal a willingness to crack down onnicotine, the addictive 
ingredient in tobacco products. Levels of nicotine, like menthol, have been 
manipulated by companies to fulfill marketing aims.</p> 
<p>The law allows the F.D.A. to regulate tobacco product ingredients but not 
to ban cigarettes or nicotine entirely.</p>

<p>When you consider that millions of drugs are prescribed for common medical 
conditions, such as high blood pressure, and that<em>many</em> of those drugs 
can lead to sexual dysfunction of some sort, it&rsquo;s no wonder that nearly 
40 million Americans describe themselves as being stuck in sexless marriages.
</p> 
<p>Many of us may be grappling with a sexual problem and not even realize that 
a drug or drug combination could be the underlying cause.<strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Sexual side effects are a silent epidemic</strong>.</p> 
<h2>Remedies For Sexual Dysfunction</h2>  Sexual side effects don&rsquo;t have 
to destroy your sex life, but they may mean that you have to change your<em>
approach</em> to sex. In the case of low desire (a very common sexual side 
effect), you may have to put your body through the motions in order to get your 
mind to follow. Or you may have to spend a lot more time on foreplay and 
getting yourself physiologically aroused. Ratush suggests trying a sexual 
warm-up, a technique that helps generate arousal but intentionally does not 
lead to climax or ejaculation. &ldquo;The idea is that the process of getting 
aroused will increase the person&rsquo;s ability to generate more of the sex 
hormone testosterone later in the day or later in the week,&rdquo; he says. And 
remember that mental stimulation plays a big role in sexual arousal, so you may 
have to try some new things and develop some new routines.  Dealing with sexual 
drug side effects can be tricky and frustrating, but the point is to not just 
give up. Go on the web and do some research. Be proactive with your partner. 
Try new things in the bedroom. When you have to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to drugs, 
don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to sex.

<p><strong>COMMENTS:</strong></p> 
<p>The rest of the article has&nbsp; comments about switching, reducing, or 
otherwise working with the medications while we recommend going to the root 
cause of someone&rsquo;s illness and not covering up symptoms with drugs that 
then have multiple other side-effects.</p> 
<p>With the natural approach we supercharge our nutrition, exercise routines, 
periodic detoxes and mind/body work. In addition we can take specialized herbs. 
Here is a partial list fromwww.natural-herbal-remedies.net</p> 
<h3>Herbal Supplements to Increase Sexual Drive<em> </em></h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Ashwaghanda</strong>- Ayurvedic equivalent to ginseng however less 
heating. Assist in increasing sexual energy. It is a well-known semen promoter 
and it<strong>treats impotency and infertility</strong>.</li> 
<li><strong> Ginko Biloba</strong>- Ginkgo biloba was reported to have a 
positive effect on all four phases of the sexual response cycle:<strong>desire, 
excitement (lubrication), orgasm</strong>, and resolution (afterglow).</li> 
<li><strong> Gentian</strong>- Gentiana lutea radix powder is a tonic 
traditionally used to support optimal functioning in all organs of the body.
</li> 
<li><strong>Muira Puama</strong>- (Ptychopetalum olacoides) Few reputed 
health-enhancing plants are as popular or as widely consumed among the natives 
of the northern Amazon river basin as the bark of muirapuama. For centuries, 
this plant has been used to<strong>increase libido and improve sexual potency
</strong>. The harvest and sale of muirapuama is big business throughout 
Brazil. As one Amazonian herbalist told me, &ldquo;Muirapuama makes you 
sexually young again</li> </ul> 
<p>In addition here is a list of some fruits and vegetables said to help 
stimulate libido:</p> 
<h3><strong>Vegetarian Foods to Increase Libido:</strong></h3> 
<p>Here are a few foods that might provide the fuel to spark your sexual 
desires and increase libido (per a post of useful info by www.askmen.com):</p> 
<p><strong>Celery </strong><strong><br>
</strong> It contains androsterone, an 
odorless hormone released through male perspiration and turns women on.<br>

<strong><br>
</strong><strong>Bananas</strong><strong><br>
</strong> Bananas 
contain the bromelain enzyme, which is believed to increase libido and reverse 
impotence in men. Additionally, they are good sources of potassium and B 
vitamins like riboflavin, which increase the body&rsquo;s overall energy levels.
<br> <strong><br>
</strong><strong>Avocado</strong><strong><br>
</strong> The 
Aztecs called the avocado tree ahuacatl or &ldquo;testicle tree.&rdquo; While 
avocados can indeed look like that body part, they contain high levels of folic 
acid to help metabolize proteins, thus giving you more energy. They also 
contain vitamin B6 (a nutrient that increases male hormone production) and 
potassium (which helps regulate a woman&rsquo;s thyroid gland), two elements 
that increase libido in both men and women.<strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Almonds (or nuts in general) 
</strong><strong><br>
</strong> Almonds are a prime source of essential fatty 
acids. These are vital as they provide the raw material for the healthy 
production of hormones. Additionally, the smell of almonds is purported to 
arouse passions.<br>
<strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Mangoes, peaches and strawberries </strong><strong><br>
</strong> 
All of the above fruits and their shapes, textures and succulence are 
erotically suggestive and can be fun to use amid foreplay. Askmen.com suggests 
try dribbling the juices over your bodies and licking up in an erotic game to 
discover each other&rsquo;s bodies.<br>
<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>
<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Figs</strong><strong><br>
</strong> These are high in amino acids, 
which are believed to increase libido. They can improve sexual stamina. 
Furthermore, the shape of a fresh fig and the sweet, juicy taste are highly 
pleasurable to the human senses.<br>
<strong><br>
</strong><strong>Garlic
</strong><strong><br>
</strong> Garlic contains allicin, an ingredient that 
increases blood flow to the sexual organs. As such, it&rsquo;s a highly 
effective herb to help increase libido. If the odor just won&rsquo;t work for 
you &mdash; or you can&rsquo;t stand garlic &mdash; you can take capsules 
instead.<br>
<strong><br>
</strong><strong>Chocolate</strong><strong><br>

</strong> Last but not least, chocolate is a sure-fire sexual stimulant. It 
contains theobromine &mdash; an alkaloid &mdash; which is very similar to 
caffeine. It also has phenylethylamine, something believed to produce the 
feeling of &ldquo;being in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition, dark chocolate has a 
massive amount of anti-oxidants, which are great for the body in general to 
help maintain the immune system.</p>
