<p> Brief history and review of safety<br>
 Stevia rebaudiana has been used as 
a sweetening ingredient in foods and drinks by South American natives for many 
centuries, and there is no report of any plant toxicity to the consumers. 
Stevia has been added to a number of food products in Japan since the mid 
1970s. No indications of any significant side effects have yet been reported 
after more than 20 years of use. Similarly, no reports of any adverse reactions 
have been reported in the United States. Donna (co-author of The Stevia 
Cookbook) and her family have been using stevia since 1990 without any health 
problems. I have used stevia daily in my morning tea, and to sweeten cocoa 
powder, since 1997 without any health problems. There are no indications at 
this point from any source that it has shown toxicity in humans. </p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Preliminary studies with stevia have shown that it contains certain 
chemicals that provide a sweet taste including stevioside, and rebaudioside A. 
Stevioside makes up about five percent of the dry weight, while rebaudioside 
makes up two percent. Rebaudioside A is apparently a more pleasant-tasting 
sweet substance. The oily part of stevia contains a number of sterols including 
stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol and campesterol. The compounds within stevia are 
very stable and can last for decades. They are resistant to heat and time.</p>

<p> <strong>Role in weight gain or loss</strong><strong><br>
 Researchers at 
the Institute on Aging at the University of Florida evaluated the effect of 
preloads containing stevia, aspartame or sucrose on food intake, satiety and 
postprandial glucose and insulin levels. The study included 19 healthy lean and 
12 obese individuals between the ages of 18-50 who completed three separate 
food test days during which they received either low-calorie pre-loads of 
stevia (290kcal) or asparatame (290kcal) or sucrose (493kcal) before lunch and 
dinner. Those consuming stevia or aspartame did not try to compensate for the 
lower caloric intake by eating more food. There were no differences reported in 
satiety and hunger levels. Participants experienced lower blood glucose and 
insulin levels when consuming stevia. The researchers wrote &#147;The key 
finding was that participants did not compensate by eating more at either their 
lunch or dinner meal when they consumed lower calorie preloads containing 
stevia or aspartame compared to when they consumed higher calorie preloads 
containing sucrose.&#148; Anton SD, Martin CK, Han H, et al. Effects of stevia,

<p> Interview for an article<br>
 I am a reporter for a health magazine: 
Stevia has been given the long-awaited GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) 
green light by the FDA, and recently Reb A, a zero-calorie sweetener derived 
from the leaf has been OK'd for more widespread use in food and drink 
products--but some critics don't feel that it's been tested enough to be 
included in the far-reaching soft drink industry. Are their safety concerns 
legitimate?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Stevia has been used in Japan and other countries 
for several decades. It has been available in the US since the mid 1990s and 
there have not been any reported adverse effects with its use. Frankly, I am 
surprised that the FDA did not allow it to be called a sweetener until the big 
companies petitioned it. In fact, for many years, until 2008, the FDA continued 
saying that they felt it was not safe. Suddenly they changed their mind. I am 
not aware of any long term new stevia safety studies that were published 
recently that would have led the FDA to change their mind. The whole thing is 
suspicious and makes the FDA appear not be playing fair. When the health food 
industry wanted the restriction on stevia being called a sweetener lifted, the 
FDA was against it. But when the big companies asked, it suddenly became safe.
<br> <br>
 For someone looking to replace sugar with stevia as their main 
dietary sweetener, what amount is recommended for daily use? And would you 
recommend using it instead of sugar as much as possible? Are there any 
warnings/dangers to beware of when using it in this way?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I 
have been using this natural sweetener daily since the mid 1990s with a few 
drops of stevia liquid in my tea 2 or 3 times a day without any health 
problems. I know many people who have been using it daily for over a decade 
without any health problems. I am not concerned with stevia causing any medical 
conditions, in fact, from all the studies that I have reviewed, it is a very 
safe supplement and most likely much, much safer than many artificial 
sweeteners.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>A</strong><strong> natural sweetener with 
the following benefit:</strong><strong> <br>
 Stevia is 300 times sweeter than 
regular sugar, with minimal aftertaste. Stevia extract has no calories and is 
suitable for diabetics and those with high blood pressure. Children can use it 
without health concerns and it does not cause tooth cavities. The herbal 
sweetener is heat stable and thus could be used for cooking and baking. Stevia 
extract is a great alternative to synthetic sweeteners. It can be easily 
blended with other sweeteners, such as honey. Stevia is already widely and 
safely consumed in many countries around the world for decades.</strong> </p> 
<p> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; This remarkable,&nbsp;no-calorie sweetener is, 
unfortunately, not a household name but is on its way to becoming very popular 
since Coke and Pepsi will be using extracts in their drinks.&nbsp;I believe 
that eventually stevia will be one of the most popular and widely used 
no-calorie sweeteners in the world.With the availability of stevia extract 
there seems to be little reason to use artificial sweeteners such as aspartame 
and saccharin.</strong> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>December, 2008 - Stevia approved as sweetener by FDA</strong>
<strong><br>
</strong>The Food and Drug Administration has declared the herb 
stevia safe for use in foods and beverages,&nbsp;which Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo 
Inc. and other companies to market it in a variety of products. Coke introduced 
a reduced-calorie version of Sprite, called Sprite Green, and some Odwalla 
juice drinks with stevia extract. Pepsi&nbsp;has SoBe Lifewater, and an 
orange-juice drink called Trop50, containing half the calories and sugar of 
orange juice.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The approval by the FDA for stevia to be used 
as a sweetener is puzzling since for years it had declared that stevia may not 
be safe. After Coke and Pepsi ask for approval, the FDA suddenly changes it's 
mind and now believes that it is safe to be consumed by the masses. I have seen 
no new research that would have led to a change of mind by the FDA. I have 
always ascertained that stevia was safe to use by the public and had been 
puzzled that the FDA had come out against it in the past. </p>

<p><b>Excerpt from the book The Stevia Cookbook by Ray Sahelian, M.D. and 
Donna Gates</b></p> 
<p> CHAPTER One The Stevia Cookbook  - DONNA'S STORY</p> 
<p>Many years ago I became interested in developing and promoting a more 
natural lifestyle incorporating whole foods along with sensitivity to our 
environment. However, early on, it became clear that I was missing one of the 
key ingredients of this diet: a healthy sugar substitute. I was uncomfortable 
with many of the artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin) and thus began my 
search for a natural alternative.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I first heard about stevia in 1990 from a multilevel marketing 
firm that was promoting it as a component of a facemask. A green-colored stevia 
syrup (derived from stevia leaves) was packaged with a small bottle of clay. 
The instructions recommended that the clay be blended with the stevia syrup and 
applied to the face. But it was the syrup's potential as a sweetener that 
interested me. I tried it. It was intensely sweet with a strong licorice-like 
aftertaste. Later I learned that I had taken far too much, a common mistake 
made by first-time users. Fortunately, a much more flavorful version of stevia 
came my way.</p> <b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b> 
<p>The Envelope with the White Powder</p> 
<p>I now live in Atlanta, Georgia, and work as a nutritional consultant. 
During the time I was living in Washington, D.C., I knew some friends who 
worked at the Chinese Embassy. One night I had dinner with two of them and 
mentioned my frustration in finding an adequate sugar substitute. Several weeks 
later, to my surprise, my friends presented me with an envelope containing a 
white powder that they had requested from a Chinese University. I was now 
holding a sample of stevioside crystals (one of the main sweet ingredients from 
the stevia plant). These crystals were extracted from Chinese-grown stevia 
plants using award-winning Japanese technology. In a joint venture with the 
Chinese, the Japanese had developed a special technology to extract stevia's 
super-sweet crystals from the plant, leaving behind the licorice-tasting 
residue and creating a concentrated powder that, by weight, is 300 times 
sweeter than sugar.</p> <b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b> 
<p>The No-Calorie Miracle!</p> 
<p>I was thrilled! Here was a widely used, totally natural sweetener that had 
virtually no calories. I immediately began experimenting with it--baking with 
it, adding it to beverages and making Stevia-flavored desserts. Many clients 
that I counsel as a nutritionist began to use it in place of sugar. They could 
now enjoy a sweet taste and avoid the harmful consequences of excessive sugar 
intake. Soon thereafter, I arranged for delivery of a large amount of stevia, 
both for my personal use and to make available to clients.</p> <b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b> 
<p>FDA Ruling Sours Sweet Stevia Story</p> 
<p>In 1991, a curious thing happened. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
labeled stevia an &quot;Unsafe food additive&quot; and issued an alert blocking 
the importation of stevia into the United States. This seemed to be a really 
peculiar development. After all, not that many people knew about stevia and it 
was sold almost solely in health food stores. As the months rolled by, I 
noticed that the health food stores, knowing of the ban, continued to sell 
stevia quite openly. It moved quickly off the shelves as loyal customers bought 
the last available supplies. Then it was gone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, I did an enormous amount of research. First, 
I used a Freedom of Information Act request to ensure that I had all the 
information on stevia then in the hands of the FDA. No indication of any ill 
effects in humans appeared anywhere in any of the literature, nor in other 
reports that I found independently. Plus, I was using it regularly, as were 
many people I knew. No one had noticed any adverse effects. Everyone loved it.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at about this time that I moved to Atlanta and decided 
to take a stand. The FDA had, by then, succeeded in stonewalling the marketing 
of stevia by refusing to consider petitions that sought to have it officially 
placed on the &quot;generally recognized as safe,&quot; or &quot;GRAS&quot; 
list. I found this peculiar since animal studies had indicated saccharin to be 
cancer causing, yet it was being widely sold. In fact, the SWEET-N-LOW package 
clearly mentions this concern. Why was saccharin available, yet Stevia, a 
natural sweetener used for centuries in South America, wasn't?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ban on stevia put supporters in a classic 
&quot;Catch-22&quot; position. In order to prove that stevia was safe for human 
consumption, millions of dollars (and years of effort) would be required to 
move this herb through the FDA approval process as an accepted food additive. 
However, whoever invested all this money would not be able to recoup the full 
benefits since they could not patent this product. A number of manufacturers 
could start importing it and marketing it. That's because, unlike aspartame, 
stevia is an herb and not a synthetic creation by a pharmaceutical company. 
Economists call this a &quot;free rider.&quot; One person or company pays the 
costs of obtaining the approval and then everyone else rides along for free.</p>
<b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b> 
<p>Sweet Revenge--The Dietary Supplement Law of 1994</p> 
<p>During 1993, the FDA miscalculated. It attempted to take control of dietary 
supplements and herbal products and limit their availability to the public. To 
everyone's surprise, a massive grassroots movement started objecting to this 
intrusion into each person's right to self-medicate with dietary supplements. 
Various natural food industry groups organized to respond to this threat. A few 
senators and members of Congress rallied behind them. Orrin Hatch, the Senator 
from Utah, was instrumental in solidifying the movement's opposition. Ads were 
taken on television. I remember seeing a television ad of Mel Gibson in his 
kitchen opening a vitamin C bottle and about to pop one in his mouth when FDA 
agents burst into his house and handcuffed him, dragging him out of his house 
for prosecution. Of course, this was quite an exaggeration, but it made the 
point. The public rallied, afraid to have their multivitamin bottle snatched 
away from them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the continued pressure from the public, the natural 
foods industry, and from the American Herbal Products Association, Congress 
passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in fall of 1994. This 
law eased restrictions on a number of dietary supplements for sale to the 
public. The FDA could no longer classify supplements as food additives, hence 
they did not be subjected to intensive safety testing before their introduction 
to the American consumer. You may recall that the hormones melatonin and DHEA 
became available to the public as a consequence of this law. And, as a result 
of a vitamin company notifying the FDA of its intention to market stevia, The 
FDA lifted its ban on stevia in 1995.</p> <b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b> 
<p>Stevia Citizenship Reinstated: Will Sugar Industry Now Hobble on Cane?</p> 
<p>So stevia began to flow back into the United States. Not, mind you, as a 
sweetener, but only when labeled as dietary supplement. Its natural sweetening 
qualities, the FDA warned, would still be considered a &quot;technical 
effect,&quot; and thus should not be mentioned. While the natural foods 
industry was encouraged by the lifting of the import ban, few had wanted to 
attract the attention of the FDA by including stevia in their products and 
advertising it for what it is--a sweetener. Because stevia remains in legal 
limbo, food manufacturers are nervous to use it in products.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've always wondered whether the FDA was pressured from any 
giant sugar or artificial industry to ban the import of stevia. After all, if 
stevia can be imported and sold by anyone, it could be a major economic threat 
to various companies.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know all this must sound difficult to believe. Yet it's 
true. As this book goes to press, a natural, practically no-calorie, 
safe-for-diabetics, non-pharmaceutical sweetener already widely used in other 
countries, including Japan (whose Ministry of Health is notoriously more strict 
than the FDA), cannot be openly sold as a sweetener in this country.</p> <b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b> 
<p> What is Stevia?</p> 
<p>Known by the official taxonomy name of <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>, it is a 
plant of the daisy family that grows naturally in South America. The plant, at 
its full maturity, reaches a height of close to three feet. The green leaves of 
this plant contain large amounts (up to 5 percent of dry weight) of stevioside, 
a sweetener estimated to be 300 times as sweet as table sugar.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At least 150 species are believed to exist in North and South 
America. In a study done in 1982, more than 110 species were tested for their 
sweetness.<i>Stevia rebaudiana </i>was found to be the sweetest, although 18 
other species were found to also exhibit a sweet taste.The researchers in the 
above study mention an interesting observation. They found fragments of a 62 
year-old leaf that exhibited potent sweetness. This indicates that the 
chemicals within this herb are very stable and have the ability to withstand 
time and drying.</p> <b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Whole leaf, powder extract or liquid? </p> 
<p>There are quite a variety of different forms and extracts being marketed. 
Which form you want to use will probably depend on the amount of sweetness 
required by the recipe and the degree to which the particular recipe or 
beverage will benefit from the licorice-like taste that accompanies its less 
refined forms.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you shop at a health food or grocery store, you will 
generally find the several forms from a number of different manufacturers. Each 
product may taste slightly different. Don't give up on stevia if you expect it 
to have the exact sweetness of sugar. It doesn't. However, when you consider 
the wonderful benefits it provides, you may accept its imperfections.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fresh leaves</p> 
<p>This form of stevia is the herb in its most natural, unrefined state. It is 
possible to grow a stevia plant in your house or backyard (see the resources 
section for companies that sell stevia cuttings). Just one word of caution. If 
you own a cat, you may not have too many stevia leaves left on the plant. They 
love to chew on it.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; For many centuries the Guarani Indians in 
South America used the leaves of stevia to sweeten their drinks. A leaf picked 
from a stevia plant and chewed will impart an extremely sweet taste sensation 
reminiscent of licorice that lasts for quite a while. In Bertoni's first 
official description of the stevia plant, he noted that &quot;A fragment of the 
leaf suffices to keep the mouth sweet for an hour.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>White stevia extract</p> 
<p>This is the form most commonly used in Japan, and generally contains 85 to 
95 percent of the sweet glycosides. In this form, it is close to 300 times 
sweeter than sugar. A teaspoon of this extract has sweetening power equivalent 
to 2 to 4 cups of sugar. The sugar-type stevia packets found in many Japanese 
restaurants are bulked up with another substance (such as maltodextrin) since a 
much smaller amount of the extract itself is needed. One company in the US has 
also started marketing stevia in small packets, similarly adding maltodextrin. 
Could stevia ever become so popular in the US that practically every restaurant 
in the country would offer packets of this sweetener alongside the pink packets 
of Sweet' N Low and blue packets of Equal?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are hundreds of patents for stevia extraction processes 
existing around the world. Japan, itself, has over 150. Canadian researchers 
are hard at work to make a pure extraction process that they hope may 
completely eliminate the aftertaste. The type of extraction would influence the 
concentration of the various sweet glycosides, such as stevioside and 
rebaudioside, and could therefore influence its aftertaste. Thus, not all 
stevia powders are the same.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since extracted white stevia powder is so intensely sweet, we 
recommend that it be mixed with water and the solution used by the drop. You 
can dissolve 1 teaspoon of the powder with 3 tablespoons of filtered or sterile 
water. Once mixed, this solution should be stored in the refrigerator. You can 
then use it whenever you need a splash of sweetening when cooking. Generally 
one teaspoonful of this liquid solution, also called a 'working solution,' is 
roughly equivalent to one cup of sugar.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Stevia Liquid concentrates<br>
 These come in two distinctly different 
forms. One is a black, syrupy concentrate and the other is clear.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; The black, syrup-like concentrate is made by boiling the 
dried leaves in water. Traditionally, the Guarani Indians thought this crude 
liquid had medicinal benefits. It has a delicious taste that adds to the flavor 
of many foods, particularly hot beverages. A dropper-style bottle is the most 
common way that this form of stevia is found in stores.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; The clear type of liquid concentrate is made by mixing a 
large amount of the white powder in distilled water or grain alcohol. Some of 
these liquid preparations contain other ingredients such as chrysanthemum 
flowers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All types of liquid extract concentrates are available in 
health food stores or some retail outlets. They come in various sizes ranging 
from a third of an ounce to four ounce bottles. Generally a few drops of this 
concentrate is enough to sweeten a glass of tea, coffee or your favorite drink. 
With time, it's likely that stevia will appear on the shelves of grocery stores 
and pharmacies nationwide.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Safety, toxicity tests</p> 
<p>Stevia has been used as a sweetening ingredient in foods and drinks by 
South American natives for many centuries, and there is no report of any plant 
toxicity to the consumers (Suttajit, 1993). Stevia has been added to a number 
of food products in Japan since the mid 1970s. No indications of any 
significant side effects have yet been reported after more than 20 years of 
use. Similarly, no reports of any adverse reactions have been reported in the 
United States. Donna and her family have been using stevia since 1990 without 
any health problems. There are no indications at this point from any source 
that stevia has shown toxicity in humans. However, it is still important that 
we review the available safety studies done thus far.</p>

 Extracts of the leaves of

(ent-13-hydroxykaur-16-en-18-oic acid), which is 250-300 times sweeter than 
sucrose and rebaudiosides A and C. Stevioside and steviol have been subjected 
to extensive genetic testing. The majority of the findings show no evidence of 
genotoxic activity. Neither stevioside nor its aglycone steviol have been shown 
to react directly with DNA or demonstrate genotoxic damage in assays relevant 
to human risk. The mutagenic activity of steviol and some of its derivatives, 
exhibited in strain TM677, was not reproduced in the same bacteria having 
normal DNA repair processes. The single positive in vivo study measuring 
single-strand DNA breaks in Wistar rat tissues by stevioside, was not confirmed 
in experiments in mice and appears to be measuring processes other than direct 
DNA damage. Neither stevioside nor steviol-induced clastogenic effects at 
extremely high dose levels in vivo. Application of a Weight-of-Evidence 
approach to assess the genetic toxicology database concludes that these 
substances do not pose a risk of genetic damage following human consumption.</p>
<b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b> 
<p>Our daily stevia dose </p> 
<p>It has been estimated that sugar consumption in Japan is about 80 grams a 
day while in the US and Europe it is between 120 to 140 g a day (Akashi). 
Assuming we substitute stevia for sugar, what would be our daily 
consumption?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake 
of simplicity, let's say we consume about 100 grams of sugar a day. Since the 
sweetness of stevioside is 300 times that of sugar, the maximum daily 
consumption of stevia would be 100 grams divided by 300, or a third of a gram 
(roughly 330 mg). Actually, Chinese researchers have already estimated that the 
daily human consumption of stevioside would be about 2 mg per kilogram of body 
weight (Xili, 1992). This is a very small amount and we should keep this in 
mind when we evaluate the toxicity studies with Stevia done in animals. Another 
point to keep in mind is that most people would only partially substitute 
stevia for sugar and other sweeteners. Therefore, the intake of stevia on a 
daily basis would even be less than 330 mg.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; There have been a 
number of studies performed in rodents and other laboratory animals to 
determine whether stevia has any toxicity. In many of these studies, stevia was 
provided in extremely high dosages, sometimes up to 5 percent of the weight of 
their food. Let's compare this to humans. Assuming we eat about two kilograms 
of food a day, and we ingest 200 mg of Stevia, the proportion of Stevia to our 
daily food intake would be about 0.01 percent; a very small amount, indeed.<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Let's examine a few studies done over the past two decades with 
stevia.</p> <b> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Animal Studies</p> 
<p>Whenever researchers want to test the dangers of a substance they give it 
to laboratory animals such as mice or rats. They give progressively higher 
doses of the substance until a lethal dose (LD) is reached where 50 percent of 
the test animals die. This level is called the LD 50. Back in the 1970s, 
several research groups attempted to find the lethal dose of stevia (Kinghorn, 
1985). They discovered that, on average, a dose of 8,000 milligrams or more per 
kilogram of body weight was necessary to achieve this LD 50. In human terms, 
this would be equivalent to a 70 kg male ingesting more than 480,000 milligrams 
(or two pounds) of the extract. In most cases, a glass of water can be 
sweetened by less than 5 drops, an extremely minimal amount. As can be 
expected, no human has ever died from stevia overdose.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In a study published in Japan in 1985, researchers determined 
that giving rats 550 mg/kg of body weight every day of stevioside for 2 years 
did not cause any abnormalities. However, could the ingestion of stevia cause 
abnormalities in the offspring?&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In 1991, an excellent 
study was done by researchers at the Chulalongkorn University Primate Research 
Center in Bangkok, Thailand (Yodyingyuad, 1991). The researchers wanted to 
study the consequences of daily ingestion of stevioside in hamsters and the 
effects on two subsequent generations. (You may recall that stevioside is the 
main active sweetening agent in the stevia plant.) Three groups of 20 
one-month-old hamsters (10 males and 10 females) were force-fed daily with 
stevioside, while the fourth group stayed as the controls; they did not get any 
stevioside. The first group was given 500 mg per kilogram of body weight; the 
second group got a higher dose at 1,000 mg per kilogram of body weight, and the 
third group got the highest dose at 2,500 mg per kilogram of body weight. The 
experiment was started with 80 one-month-old hamsters, 40 of each sex, each 
weighing between 30 and 50 grams. The 2,500 mg per kg of body weight would be 
equivalent to a human ingesting 150,000 mg. The likely amount most humans would 
ingest from sweetening their drinks and certain foods is often less than 500 mg.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; In the first generation, the average growth of the hamsters 
receiving various doses of stevioside did not differ significantly between each 
group. In the second generation, no significant difference in body weight was 
observed among groups of males receiving various doses of stevioside until 90 
days of age. Thereafter, growth of males in the group receiving stevioside at 
500 mg/kg of body weight was significantly higher than in the other groups. 
Nevertheless, male hamsters in the second and third groups grew the same amount 
as did the control group.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In the third generation, at 120 
days of age, no significant differences in body weights were observed in all 
groups of male and female animals. As to the mating performance, all three 
generations performed the same no matter what dose of stevioside they received. 
Their performance was equal to the controls.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Microscopic 
examination of reproductive tissues from all experimental groups, both male and 
female, did not differ from the control group. The production of sperm was 
normal, even in the males who received the highest dose of stevioside. In the 
females, the ovaries of all the animals were perfectly normal.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, no abnormalities were found in growth and fertility in 
both sexes. All males mated females efficiently and successfully. Females 
became pregnant after mating. The duration of pregnancy, number of fetuses, as 
well as number of young delivered each time from females in the experimental 
groups were not significantly different from those in the control group.&quot;
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Stevia Safety Study</p> 
<p>&quot;Assessment of the carcinogenicity of stevioside in rats,&quot; was 
the title of an article published in the June, 1997 issue of<i>Food and 
Chemical Toxicology</i>. We were very excited and anxious when we came across 
this study. Was this latest information going to show that stevioside was safe, 
or potentially harmful?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; This study was performed by Dr. K. 
Toyoda and colleagues, from the Division of Pathology, National Institute of 
Health Sciences in Tokyo, Japan. For a period of 104 weeks (two years), three 
groups of rats were tested to receive either no stevioside (the controls), 
stevioside in a concentration of 2.5 percent of their diet, and stevioside in a 
concentration of 5 percent of their diet. There were 50 male and 50 female rats 
involved in the study. All surviving rats were killed at the end of week 108. 
The results showed the body weight of the rats was less in those who received 
the stevioside compared to the controls. This makes sense because stevioside 
has no calories. When the organs and tissues of the rats were examined under 
the microscope, there was no difference in the controls and those on 
stevioside, except females on stevioside had a decreased incidence of breast 
tumors, and the males had a lesser incidence of kidney damage. The researchers 
state, &quot;It is concluded that stevioside is not carcinogenic in F344 rats 
under the experimental conditions described.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; You may 
recall at the start of this chapter that we estimated an average person's daily 
dietary intake of stevioside to be, at most, about 0.01 percent of the total 
daily intake of food. It is reassuring that rats given significantly higher 
amounts of this sweetener did not have a higher incidence of tumors. Our 
interpretation of this research would lead us to believe that the small amounts 
of stevioside we consume daily to be extremely safe.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Summary of the Safety Issue </p> 
<p>One can study the influence of a particular chemical in an isolated Petri 
dish, or a test tube, or on rodents,<i>ad infinitum</i> but not know what this 
chemical will do in the human body when ingested in the small amounts normally 
consumed. In our opinion, having reviewed all the safety studies published thus 
far, and considering the safe, centuries-old consumption in south America, and 
the two decades-plus use of stevia by Japanese consumers, we conclude that 
stevia is safe for human consumption, particularly in the dosages normally 
consumed as a partial alternative to sugar, other natural sweeteners, and 
artificial sweeteners.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Effect on blood pressure<br>
 Apparent lack of pharmacological effect of 
steviol glycosides used as sweeteners in humans. A pilot study of repeated 
exposures in some normotensive and hypotensive individuals and in Type 1 and 
Type 2 diabetics.<br>
 Regul Toxicol Pharmacol. 2008. <br>
 This study shows 
that oral steviol glycosides, taken as sweetener are well tolerated and have no 
pharmacological effect.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> When normal human volunteers between the ages of 20 to 40 years were given 
a tea prepared with stevia leaves, a lowering of blood pressure occurred. 
Certainly more human studies are needed before we can come to any conclusions 
regarding the full effect of normal daily ingestion of stevioside on blood 
pressure.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> A double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Taiwan studied 106 Chinese 
hypertensive subjects ages ranging from 28 to 75 years. Each subject was given 
capsules containing 250 mg stevioside or placebo three times daily and 
followed-up at monthly intervals for 1 year (the average person who uses stevia 
ingests about 100 mg a day of stevioside). After 3 months, the systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure of the stevioside group decreased by about 6 points, 
and the effect persisted during the whole year. Blood biochemistry including 
lipid and glucose showed no major changes. No significant adverse effects were 
observed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Diabetes patients</p> 
<p>The availability of artificial sweeteners has been of enormous benefit to 
those with diabetes. However, there's always been a concern that over 
consumption of these synthetic sweeteners may cause some unknown harm to the 
body. Could stevia substitution be a good alternative for those with diabetes? 
We believe so. Stevia leaves have been used as herbal teas by diabetic patients 
in Asian countries. No side effects have been observed in these patients after 
many years of continued consumption (Suttajit, 1993). Furthermore, studies have 
shown that stevia extract can actually improve blood sugar levels (Alvarez, 
1981, Curi, 1986).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; In 1986, Brazilian researchers from the 
Universities of Maringa and Sao Paolo evaluated the role of stevia in blood 
sugar (Curi, 1986). Sixteen healthy volunteers were given extracts of 5 grams 
of stevia leaves every six hours for three days. The extracts from the leaves 
were prepared by immersing them in boiling water for 20 minutes. A glucose 
tolerance test (GTT) was performed before and after the administration of the 
extract and the results were compared to another group who did not receive the 
stevia extracts. During a GTT, patients are given a glass of water with glucose 
and their blood sugar levels are evaluated over the next few hours. Those who 
have a predisposition to diabetes will have a marked rise in blood sugar levels.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; The volunteers on stevia were found to have significantly 
lower blood sugar levels after ingestion of stevia. This is a positive 
indication that stevia can potentially be beneficial to diabetics who 
substitute stevia in order to decrease their sugar consumption. Even if stevia 
by itself is not able to lower blood sugar levels, just the fact that a 
diabetic would consume less sugar is of significant importance in maintaining 
better blood sugar control.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; If you have diabetes, chances are 
you consume a large amount of artificial sweeteners and you may be concerned 
about switching to stevia since long-term human studies have not been done with 
this herb. You may also be accustomed in your use of these artificial 
sweeteners and would not be willing to completely stop them. One option is to 
gradually use less of them while substituting stevia. For instance, you can 
initially use stevia in some of your drinks, like coffee or tea. After a few 
weeks, if your comfort level with stevia increases, you can gradually use more 
of the herbal extract. Over the next few weeks and months you can either switch 
completely to stevia, or you can continue using it in combination with 
artificial sweeteners. With time more research will become available on the 
safety of stevia and artificial sweeteners. Based on the results of these 
studies, you can determine which ones to continue using in a larger amount. 
It's also quite possible that artificial sweeteners may be safe in low amounts, 
but problems could arise when they are used in excessive quantities. By 
partially or mostly substituting stevia, you can reduce any potential risk. 
Stevia is a good supplement for those with diabetes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sweet Teeth with No Cavities</p> 
<p>There are certain bacteria in our mouths, particularly <i>streptococci 
mutans</i>, that ferment various sugars to produce acids. These in turn eat 
through the enamel of the tooth causing pockets or cavities. For a long time, 
scientists have searched to find alternative sweeteners that are not 
fermentable by bacteria and hence do not cause cavities. Artificial sweeteners 
have been helpful in this regard.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Does ingesting stevia lead to tooth cavities? A study done on 
rats has not shown this to be case. Stevioside and rebaudioside A, the two 
primary sweet constituents of the stevia plant, were tested in a group of sixty 
rat pups (Das, 1992) in the following way:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Group 1 was fed sucrose (table sugar), at 30 percent of their diet </p> 
<p>Group 2 was given 0.5 percent of their diet in stevioside</p> 
<p>Group 3 got 0.5 percent of their diet in rebaudioside A</p> 
<p>Group 4 ingested no sugars.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After 5 weeks, all four groups had their teeth evaluated. 
There were no differences in food and water intake and weight gain between the 
four groups. However, the first group had significantly more cavities than the 
rest of the groups. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were equivalent.&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
The researchers state, &quot;It was concluded that neither stevioside nor 
rebaudioside A is cariogenic [cavity causing] under the conditions of this 
study.&quot; It appears that the chemicals within the stevia plant that impart 
its sweetness are not fermentable, and thus do not cause tooth cavities.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Use in Children</p> </b> 
<p>Candies, sodas, ice cream, pies, cakes... it's disturbing how many sweet 
products are ingested by children on a daily basis. All that sugar can lead to 
tooth cavities and obesity. Partially substituting with stevia can help 
children satisfy their sweet tooth while decreasing the risks from excessive 
sugar intake. If you're a parent, you can take advantage of the many recipes 
provided in<i>The Stevia Cookbook</i> to provide your children with tasty 
sweets that will satisfy their sweet teeth but not cause damage to the teeth. 
Obesity in children is a growing problem in this country and any method we have 
of helping children reduce their caloric intake will be greatly beneficial. 
There is also a concern with children consuming excessive amounts of artificial 
sweeteners. The potential, long-term health consequences of saccharin and 
aspartame ingestion are currently not fully known, but they do need to be kept 
in mind. Eliminating all artificial sweeteners will be a frustrating enterprise 
since they are extremely prevalent. However, by partially substituting stevia 
in homemade desserts, you can significantly reduce your children's exposure to 
these artificial chemicals.<b><br>
 &nbsp;</b></p><b> 
<p>Anti-Aging potential?</p> 
<p>We know from numerous animal studies that reducing caloric intake leads to 
life span extension. Since stevia can substitute for sugar, and we know excess 
amounts of this sweetener can contribute to high blood sugar, obesity, and have 
other unhealthy effects on the human body, it would seem likely that 
substituting stevia for sugar could have a positive effect on longevity. This 
effect would be most apparent in those who normally have a high intake of sugar.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; Glucose (sugar) has been implicated in the aging process by 
its ability to react with some proteins, like collagen, to produce glycation. 
That is, the glucose molecule attaches to some amino acids of a protein and 
makes the protein less functional, leading to disturbances within a cell. The 
initial phase of this attachment is called glycation. As we age, the amount of 
glycation of the proteins in our bodies tends to increase. We should also note 
that blood sugar generally increases as we age. It is known that glycation of 
human tendon and aortic collagen increases with age in proportion to the 
increase in blood glucose that occurs with aging (Schleicher, 1996 and 1997).
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; This age-related increase in glycation, though, can be 
partially prevented by caloric restriction. In other words, avoiding high sugar 
consumption, and high caloric consumption, could theoretically, over the years 
and decades, help our proteins stay healthier. Practical ways to use this 
information include:</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> 1) Eat small frequent meals throughout the day instead of one or two 
excessively large ones. Eating these small meals, or snacks, will help maintain 
your blood sugar at a relatively steady state, instead of wide fluctuations.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> 2) Make sure to have some protein with each meal. Avoid a purely 
carbohydrate meal, except if you are planning to induce sleep at night. 
Carbohydrates, eaten an hour or two before bed, help us get sleepy. Your 
carbohydrate intake should mostly be from unprocessed whole grains, vegetables 
and legumes.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> 3) Even relatively &#147;healthy&#148; drinks, such as fruit juices, can 
cause significant elevation of blood sugar when consumed in large amounts, such 
as 6 ounces or more. Many people quickly gulp down 8 ounces of orange juice in 
the morning, in addition to a cup of coffee laced with a teaspoon or two of 
sugar.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> 4) And, of course, substitute this sweetener for cane sugar whenever 
possible.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> </b>
<p><b>Sweet Teeth with No Cavities<br>
 There are certain bacteria in our 
mouths, particularly<i>streptococci mutans</i>, that ferment various sugars to 
produce acids. These in turn eat through the enamel of the tooth causing 
pockets or cavities. For a long time, scientists have searched to find 
alternative sweeteners that are not fermentable by bacteria and hence do not 
cause cavities. Artificial sweeteners have been helpful in this regard. 
Fortunately, studies with stevia indicate that it does not cause tooth cavities.
<br> &nbsp;</b></p> 
<p>Use in Pregnancy or Breast Feeding<br>
 Since human studies providing 
stevia during pregnancy have not been done, it is not known whether its use 
during this period is safe. It&#146;s very likely that small amounts would not 
cause any problems.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Review<br>
 Hopefully, with time, stevia can be added to a variety of 
sodas, candies, gums, and other foods in the US, just like it currently is in 
Japan and other countries. And we could see stevia packets at restaurants.</p> 
<p>Advantages<br>
 Stevia is, in many cases, a flavor enhancer. This can be 
experienced when you add stevia to lemon juice, clearly heightening the flavor 
of the lemon. It is an appropriate sweetener for many types of foods since it 
is stable in acid foods (like tomato, pineapple, and limes). Cooking stevia at 
high temperatures does not destroy its sweetening properties. The artificial 
sweetener aspartame is not suitable for cooking and cannot make this claim. 
When heated, stevia does not ferment nor discolor.</p> 
<p>Disadvantages<br>
 Foods baked with stevia do not rise as much as those 
baked with sugar. In certain baked recipes, the complete elimination of sugar 
may not be possible. In addition to contributing necessary sweetness, sugar's 
crystalline structure provides texture to baked goods, aids in the creaming and 
whipping process during mixing, creates softening or spreading action to 
batter, caramelizes, and enhances browning.</p> 
<p>Sugar feeds the fermentation of yeast and retains moisture. Stevia is not 
suitable for these purposes. Some users are sensitive to the slight aftertaste. 
We've found that baking and cooking usually reduce this aftertaste. If you have 
been using the artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and saccharin, they also 
have a noticeable aftertaste. If you experiment with different stevia products, 
you will find that there are slight differences in their sweetness, and even in 
the aftertaste. Try at least two or three different products to identify one 
that you find most suitable for your needs. If you use the green powder, it may 
slightly change the color of your food. You can avoid this by using the white 
powdered extract.&nbsp; Most of the recipes in this book use the white stevia 
powder or the liquid concentrate made from the white powder.</p> 
<p>Practical Tips and Suggestions<br>
 A common mistake beginners make is 
using too much of it in recipes. Since stevia is up to 300 times sweeter than 
sugar, excessive amounts can lead to over-sweetness and an aftertaste. For 
instance, Dr. Sahelian's mom followed the recipe of the oatmeal cookies 
suggested in this book. The recipe asked for 3/4 teaspoon of stevia. She tried 
two batches, one with 3/4 teaspoon of stevia, a second with one teaspoon. The 
second batch had a mild, but noticeable, aftertaste. The first batch was 
delicious. Mixing stevia with even a tiny amount of another sweetener like 
honey will change the aftertaste. It can also have a synergistic effect with 
other sweeteners; a little goes a long way, so use it sparingly when combining. 
Stevia's taste disappears in strong flavors and blends especially well in 
citrus flavors such as lemon and cranberry. Stevia is delicious with dairy 
foods (yogurt, cream, ice cream, kefir) and also with chocolate and carob. If 
you are one of the millions of Americans who have a love affair with chocolate, 
you'll be delighted to know that stevia and chocolate, and carob, are perfect 
partners. In creating the recipes for this book, we found our greatest 
challenge was creating cakes and cookies. These are made mostly with flour and 
a large amount of sugar. The two together provide the &quot;rise&quot; or 
fluffiness to cake. Flour, having a slightly bitter nature, is not as delicious 
with stevia as with other foods. Adding other flavors like grated lemon peel 
and nuts helps improve the flavor, but achieving the fluffiness is difficult. 
One alternative is to create thinner cakes that could be put together in many 
layers with various kinds of icings in between. Sugar gives icings and fillings 
&quot;body.&quot; To make an icing or filling using stevia, we've found that 
combining it with fruit spreads and nut berries provides the creaminess and 
spreading quality that is missing when you do away with the sugar. Recipe books 
put out by the NutraSweet and Equal companies and recipes for diabetics are 
good sources for ideas. Substitute natural stevia for the recipes that call for 
artificial sweeteners.</p> 
<p>Baking with Stevia extract<br>
 Baked goods using only stevia do not brown 
well. Use your sense of touch and smell to decide when your muffins or cakes 
are done. When your kitchen fills with a wonderful smell, open your oven door 
and poke the muffin or cake to see if it is &quot;springy&quot; to the touch. 
If so, then they're ready to eat. Baked goods with chocolate and carob mask 
stevia's aftertaste and contribute a rich brown color. We do not recommend 
using stevia to bake yeast breads; the yeast must be activated by sugar, or the 
bread won't rise.</p> 
<p>Conversion rate<br>
 How do you determine how much to use? Unfortunately, 
we can't give you an exact answer for several reasons. Very sour foods like 
cranberries and lemons would need more sweetening than a pie baked with apples 
or pears since the those are naturally sweet. Then there's personal preference. 
Some of us don't like foods too sweet, while others have a sweet tooth. There's 
also a cultural difference. As a rule, Americans like their foods sweeter than 
those of other countries. To complicate matters even more, there are a number 
of different companies making stevia. The quality, flavor, and sweetness varies 
from product to product. Your best option is to try a few different brands and 
choose the one that best suits your needs. Through practical experience, we've 
found the following approximate equivalences It is worth mentioning again that 
different products on the market could provide different sweetness equivalences.
</p> 
<p>One cup sugar = about half a teaspoon of white stevia powder = about one 
teaspoon of stevia liquid concentrate<br>
 One tablespoon sugar = about six to 
nine drops of stevia liquid extract<br>
 One teaspoon of sugar = about two to 
three drops of stevia liquid extract</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are new to cooking with stevia, always start with 
either the exact amount of stevia the recipe calls for, or a slightly smaller 
amount. Then taste the batter, sauce, salad dressing or smoothie to see if it's 
sweet enough before adding more. If you purchase white stevia powder you may 
find it a little harder to work with when you only need the tiniest amount of 
sweetening power. Even the amount you might gather onto the point of a dinner 
knife might be too much in a cup of tea or coffee. We recommend turning the 
powder into a &quot;working solution.&quot; Dissolve one teaspoon of white 
powder into three tablespoon of filtered water, pour into a dropper bottle, and 
then refrigerate. Or, you can just buy any of the ready-made stevia liquid 
concentrates from a health food store or the mail-order firms listed in the 
resource section of this book. Some communities may have stevia available in 
pharmacies, grocery stores, or retail outlets.</p> 
<p>SWEET DRINKS ARE MADE OF THESE<br>
 The chemicals within stevia that make 
it taste sweet are stable in all types of liquids and do not lose their 
sweetness. Thus, a number of drinks can be superbly sweetened with it. All it 
takes is usually two to five drops of liquid stevia per glass. Once you get 
into the habit of using it in your drinks, you'll never feel the need to buy 
the pink or blue packets, or even use honey. However, if you really like honey 
with your drinks, you can use less of it while adding a drop or two of stevia. 
We both are now in the habit of carrying small stevia bottles when we go out to 
restaurants or when we travel. This way, we can sweeten our drinks even when 
not at home. The following are some examples of drinks that you can easily 
sweeten with stevia extract.</p> 
<p> Lemonade and lemon juice. Not only does this herbal extract provide 
sweetness, it actually slightly enhances the flavor of the lemon. You can now 
serve lemonade to your kids on a hot summer afternoon without loading them up 
with high doses of harmful sugar.</p> 
<p> Iced Tea. Forget sugar or artificial sweeteners. Stevia's the one to use.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sodas. A 
number of types of sodas in Japan have been sweetened using stevia since the 
mid-1970s. We hope that over the next few years, the FDA will allow stevia to 
be added to soft drinks. Thus, the consumption of saccharin and aspartame will 
decrease.</p> 
<p> Herbal teas--We have tried stevia in quite a variety of herbal teas and it 
works well in all cases. The liquid extracts are perfect for teas. Have you 
considered having a variety of different herbal teas on your kitchen counter? 
Each morning you could try a different one. Some examples that we have tried 
include ginger, licorice, Earl gray, elderberry, dandelion, St. John's wort, 
kava, ginkgo, green, black, cinnamon, ginseng, echinacea, peppermint, 
goldenseal, fenugreek, and others. You could add the stevia drops after you 
brew the tea bag, or better yet, add the drops in the glass before you pour the 
hot water. As a rule, two to five drops of the liquid extract will provide 
enough sweetness to satisfy most people.</p> 
<p> Coffee. Stevia is a perfect substitute for the artificial sweeteners. The 
amount of stevia used in coffee will be similar to the herbal teas. If you 
drink a few cups of coffee a day, and let's say you use two teaspoons of sugar 
per cup, just imagine how many calories a day you will not consume if you 
switch to stevia!</p>

</strong>Chan P, et al. <em>A 
double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness and tolerability of 
oral stevioside in human hypertension.</em> Taipei Wan Fang Hospital, Taiwan.: 
<em>Br J Clin Pharmacol</em> 2000<br>
 A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study was undertaken. This study group consisted of 106 
Chinese hypertensive subjects with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 110 
mmHg and ages ranging from 28 to 75 years with 60 subjects (men 34, women 26) 
allocated to active treatment and 46 (men 19, women 27) to placebo treatment. 
Each subject was given capsules containing stevioside stevia (250 mg) or 
placebo thrice daily and followed-up at monthly intervals for 1 year. After 3 
months, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of the stevia group decreased 
significantly and the effect persisted during the whole year. Blood 
biochemistry parameters including lipid and glucose showed no significant 
changes. No significant adverse effect was observed and quality of life 
assessment showed no deterioration. This study shows that oral stevia is a well 
tolerated and effective modality that may be considered as an alternative or 
supplementary therapy for patients with hypertension.<br>

Stevia helpful for diabetes and hypertension<br>
 Stevia has been used for many 
years in the treatment of diabetes among Indians in Paraguay and Brazil. 
However, the mechanism for the blood glucose-lowering effect remains unknown. A 
study conducted at Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark found that stevioside 
enhances insulin secretion from mouse pancreatic islets in the presence of 
glucose. The researchers state, &quot;Stevioside stimulates insulin secretion 
via a direct action on pancreatic beta cells. The results indicate that the 
compounds may have a potential role as an anti-hyperglycemic agent in the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Taiwan studied 106 Chinese 
hypertensive subjects ages ranging from 28 to 75 years. Each subject was given 
capsules containing 250 mg stevioside or placebo three times daily and 
followed-up at monthly intervals for 1 year (the average person who uses stevia 
ingests about 100 mg a day of stevioside). After 3 months, the systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure of the stevioside group decreased by about 6 points, 
and the effect persisted during the whole year. Blood biochemistry including 
lipid and glucose showed no major changes. No significant adverse effects were 
observed.<br>

 Q. I suffer from fructose intolerant. I 
am wondering if stevia is safe for those of us who suffer from this disease. 
Also I am needing the Chemical breakdown of this sugar in the body. I am not 
able to digest fructose, sucrose, honey, molassas, splenda, or just about any 
regular sugar. I am also not a fan of the diet industry puting aspartime in 
foods, it taste nasty and is not good for you. If you could please look into 
this for me I will tell everyone on the fructose intolerant forum about this 
sugar and hopefully we can live a better life.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. 
Stevia contains stevioside, a compound that has a unique structure far 
different than fructose or any sugar. We don't see any relationship, even 
remotely, between the stevia chemical structure and sugars.</strong><br>

I have been using stevia since 1988. I'm a 55 year old female. There are no ill 
effects from this product. I use stevia in yerba mate tea daily. I drink at 
least 12 cups, every day for all these years. I was recently in a very bad 
accident and had my back fractured in four places. I'm up, going and getting 
back my physical strength. I truly believe the tea and stevia are responsible 
for my well being.<br>
<strong><br>
 Q. I have kidney failure - will be on 
dialysis soon. Is there anything known about using stevia with this condition?
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; A. Stevia should be safe to use in kidney failure. <br>

</strong> Sugar substitute</p> 
<p>Those who are novices at using stevia often make the mistake of using too 
much thinking they should use it as much as sugar. Stevia is 300 times sweeter 
than sugar, excessive amounts can lead to over-sweetness and an aftertaste. 
Generally, one teaspoon of stevia would be equivalent to one cup of sugar, 
while a quarter teaspoon would be equivalent to one tablespoon of sugar. Stevia 
is available in concentrated liquid form, and often two to four drops of the 
liquid extract added to tea or coffee is sufficient to sweeten the drink. 
Hopefully, with time, stevia can be added to a variety of sodas, candies, gums, 
and other foods in the US, just like it currently is in Japan and other 
countries. And we could see stevia packets at restaurants right along with the 
pink and blue artificial sweeteners.</p>

<p>Ray Sahelian, M.D. says, &quot; I have used stevia daily for more than 10 
years with absolutely no adverse effects. I spent long hours at the UCLA 
medical library while writing my book The Stevia Cookbook. I evaluated in 
detail all the published studies on stevia over the past few decades, and based 
on a thorough evaluation, I am confident to say that stevia, in my opinion, is 
safe and quite likely significantly safer than some of the artificial 
sweeteners currently on the market. Stevia has been given in massive doses to 
three generations of rodents with no harmful effects noted. Stevia has been 
used in Japan for more than 3 decades with no adverse reactions reported. It's 
too bad that more Americans have not heard of this amazing and safe sweetener. 
Those with diabetes can take stevia as a substitute for artificial sweeteners 
and sugar.&quot;</p>

<p> Q. Just wanted to let you know that I &quot;met&quot; you not too long ago 
by accident while attending the &quot;University of Google&quot;? and I was so 
excited and impressed with all I read on your site. You made me smile and you 
made me learn. Imagine my surprise today when I found that you know Donna 
Gates. I have been using her Body Ecology diet with much success for my 
autistic son for a few months. When your newsletter spoke of the Stevia 
Cookbook, I was suspect that you were a copycat of Donna Gates. and then, wow, 
it turns out you co-authored the book! So sorry for thinking evil of you for 
one split sec! We are trying to recover our 11 yo son from autism, and so, are 
very appreciative of all we can learn toward this goal. Thanks again for all 
you are doing to help so many.</p>
