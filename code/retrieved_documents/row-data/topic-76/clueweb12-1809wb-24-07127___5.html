<h1>Guide to Sweeteners &ndash; Still a Sticky Topic</h1> by Suzanne Somers 
6/30/2011 8:22:00 AM 
<p> Dear Friends,&nbsp; </p> 
<p> I recently posted to my friends on Facebook, asking&nbsp;about their 
sweetener of choice.&nbsp; Huge response!&nbsp; I get so many questions on 
this, I though I would give you my opinion&hellip; it&rsquo;s just another one 
to add to group, but here&rsquo;s my POV.&nbsp; Some of this is based on 
research I have collected from the medical experts with whom I surround myself, 
and some is just based on my personal views.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>The pink &ndash; saccharin</strong>: This has been around since 
the 60s and 70s. At first everyone thought it was the miracle sugar 
substitute.&nbsp; Then it got a &ldquo;causes cancer&rdquo; wrap &ndash; of 
course, proven and disproven depending upon the article you read or expert you 
consult.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very concentrated.&nbsp; Not a good source for baking 
as it does not hold up to heat and leaves an aftertaste if you use a lot of 
it.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>M</strong><strong>y personal opinion:</strong> Many years ago I 
recommended this product as an alternative to sugar (you will see references 
for it in my early books). I felt it was better than aspartame if you were 
going to use an artificial sweetener.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the information I 
have today, I still think it is the least offensive of the artificial 
sweeteners, however, I do not use&nbsp;it or any artificial sweeteners.&nbsp; 
</p> 
<p> <strong>The blue &ndash; aspartame</strong>: &nbsp;Took the spotlight from 
the pink in the 80s.&nbsp; Again, this was the miracle NEW sweetener.&nbsp; 
Less aftertaste, and didn&rsquo;t seem to have that cancer causing issue that 
had freaked out so many with saccharin.&nbsp; Then in the late 90s we started 
to see reports that maybe this artificial sweetener was dangerous as 
well.&nbsp; There was a particularly nasty online article that took off virally 
- slandering aspartame (mostly from diet soda drinkers) and linking it to 
cancer, brain tumors, lupus, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; Many sources say 
this &ldquo;chain letter&rdquo; is anecdotal, from anonymous sources and 
scientifically implausible.&nbsp; Upon reading it again today, I see Dr. 
Russell Blaylock was quoted in it all those years ago, stating, &ldquo;The 
ingredients stimulate the neurons of the brain to death, causing brain damage 
of varying degrees.&rdquo; </p> 
<p> In 2008 I interviewed Blaylock for my book, Breakthrough, and he cited two 
new studies by one of the biggest cancer research institutes in the world, The 
Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences in Italy. The 
results confirmed that aspartame breaks down in the body to formaldehyde, which 
breaks up the DNA and leaves the body with double-strand breaks, most 
associated with cancer induction. He states, &ldquo;We had good evidence before 
that aspartame most likely produced cancer, and now we know it does for 
sure.&rdquo; (For more information, readBreakthrough, p. 38.) </p> 
<p> <strong>My personal opinion:</strong> I don&rsquo;t use any artificial 
sweeteners, and certainly not this one. </p> 
<p> Aspartame is still sold and added to over 6,000 products. The FDA does not 
report any safety issues.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> To read the viral piece on aspartame with the rebuttals, click here.&nbsp; 
</p> 
<p> <strong>The yellow &ndash; sucralose:</strong>&nbsp; &ldquo;Made from 
sugar so it tastes like sugar.&rdquo; That means it&rsquo;s natural, 
right?&nbsp; Around the turn of the century, the new yellow packets became the 
rage (once&nbsp;aspartame was exposed).&nbsp; One of the big benefits is that 
it measures just like sugar &ndash; making it easier to use in baking.&nbsp; 
Come to find out, sucralose is made by taking a sugar molecule and adding 
chlorine to it. I am always shocked when I tell people this and they say, 
&ldquo;So? What&rsquo;s the problem with chlorine?&rdquo;&nbsp; </p> 
<p> I interviewed Dr. Steven Hotze in Breakthrough, who states, &ldquo;Toxins 
are the big problem. How about Splenda? It&rsquo;s sucralose, which is 
chlorinated hydrocarbon, which is toxic. Any chlorinated hydrocarbon in the 
world is toxic, carcinogenic. Splenda was originally made as a pesticide-go 
dump it on your ant beds and come back tomorrow to see all the dead 
ants.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Breakthrough, p. 345) </p> 
<p> <strong>My personal opinion:</strong> I don&rsquo;t use any artificial 
sweeteners.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Studies also show artificial sweeteners are addictive.&nbsp; This 
addiction makes us crave more and more sweet foods and can actually cause 
weight gain, rather than weight loss &ndash; which is the reason most people 
use these products anyway. </p> 
<p> <strong>The green &ndash; stevia:</strong>&nbsp; Stevia is 100% natural, 
extracted from a plant in South America, it has a low glycemic index and there 
are no controversial reports on the health or safety of this natural sweetener. 
</p> 
<p> <strong>My personal opinion</strong>: I use this product now and then, but 
I do not like the licorice aftertaste.&nbsp; I have not had luck baking with it 
due to this aftertaste. It&rsquo;s less offensive in coffee, but I like my 
coffee without sweetener anyway. </p> 
<p> <strong>The real stuff - raw sugar, honey, white sugar</strong>: All are 
accepted by the body as sugar.&nbsp; I use them in moderation.&nbsp; I prefer 
honey of the three, then raw sugar, then white sugar.&nbsp; All cause increases 
in insulin, our fat storing hormone. Controlling this hormone, so that our food 
is burned as fuel rather than stored as fat, is a key tenant to my weight loss 
plan,Sexy Forever, so I moderate my use of all of these sugars. </p> 
<p> <strong>My personal opinion:</strong> Much better choices than artificial 
sweeteners, but I use them only in moderation to keep my weight and health in 
check. </p> 
<p> <strong>Agave &ndash; 100% natural.</strong>&nbsp; I have been using agave 
nectar as a low-glycemic liquid sweetener for the past five years or so.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s the consistency of honey, but is not supposed to spike insulin, like 
honey.&nbsp; I really like the taste and consistency of this product.&nbsp; 
Love it on Greek yogurt with a little cinnamon.&nbsp; Now there is 
controversial information that the manufacturing process turns this natural 
sweetener into a syrup, similar to high fructose corn syrup &ndash; stating 
that agave nectar is actually 90% fructose.&nbsp; Still, fructose is 20 on the 
glycemic index as opposed to sugar which is 100!&nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>My personal opinion:</strong> I use agave, but only organic agave 
to make sure there are no chemicals in the extraction process. So far I have 
believed this is a healthy, natural alternative to sugar or honey, with a lower 
glycemic index.&nbsp; The recent news about the manufacturing process turning 
this into a product similar it high fructose corn syrup is on my radar.&nbsp; I 
need more information.&nbsp; My ears are open for the next round of 
research.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>The purple one - All Natural SomerSweet:</strong>&nbsp; This is my 
signature sweetener.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 100% natural.&nbsp; It has taken me years 
to develop it.&nbsp; When I first debuted&nbsp;original SomerSweet, I 
didn&rsquo;t have the information I have today and it contained a very small 
amount of artificial sweetener.&nbsp; We have since reformulated 
to&nbsp;All&nbsp;Natural SomerSweet which is a 100% natural product -&nbsp;and 
I couldn&rsquo;t be more thrilled to have all artificial sweeteners out of my 
system.&nbsp; Knowledge is power.&nbsp; As I learn, I adjust.&nbsp; And I pass 
along my information to you.&nbsp; All Natural SomerSweet spoons into coffee 
tea just like sugar, but what I really love about this product is how it 
bakes!&nbsp; I use it cup for cup in place of sugar in recipes with excellent 
results.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s only 5 on the glycemic index so it won&rsquo;t 
spike my insulin. Great for those on mySexy Forever plan.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Ingredients: All Natural SomerSweet is mostly made from inulin, which is a 
chicory fiber. This is a pre-biotic soluble fiber &ndash; something your body 
needs anyway.&nbsp; It also contains erythritol &ndash; a natural substance 
found in pears, melons, grapes, mushrooms and wine.&nbsp; While erythritol is 
categorized as a sugar alcohol, it has no gassy side effects. Additionally, 
there is a small amount of fructose found in our inulin blend, but it&rsquo;s 
such a low amount, we still boast 0 sugars per serving.&nbsp; Lastly, citrus 
peel extract&nbsp;rounds out the flavor.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> <strong>My personal opinion:</strong> Great for cold or hot drinks.&nbsp; 
Excellent for baking. No aftertaste.&nbsp; The fiber may cause you to 
&ldquo;move&rdquo; a little, but that&rsquo;s a good thing! Start slowly and 
build your way up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Available in individual packets or cans.&nbsp;
