<h1> Sugar substitutes and the potential danger of Splenda</h1> 
<p> <em>by Marcelle Pick, OB/GYN NP</em></p> Tweet <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> Few of us are really aware of how many new Splenda&reg; products there are 
in the supermarkets. We&rsquo;ve been told that this artificial sweetener is 
different from all the past failures &mdash; Sweet&rsquo;N Low&reg;, 
NutraSweet&reg;, etc. &mdash; and according to the claims, that this Splenda is 
the perfect sugar substitute: as sweet as sugar, but no calories; as sweet as 
sugar, but no surge in insulin; as sweet as sugar, but no side effects or 
long-term health damage.</p> 
<p> The wave is coming because &ldquo;low&ndash;sugar&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;sugar&ndash;free&rdquo; is the latest fad &mdash; a welcome trend, given 
the health hazards of all the sugar in the average diet. But of the hundreds of 
new diet foods that will soon appear, most will use Splenda as a sugar 
substitute. This is important because for tens of millions of women, their diet 
soda or artificially-sweetened food is a keystone of what they think are 
healthy nutrition and food choices &mdash; both for themselves and for their 
families.</p> 
<p> <strong>Looking for a different kind of plan for finding your healthy 
weight?</strong></p> 
<p> On the other side of the argument are responsible experts who say that 
Splenda is unsafe &mdash; the latest in a succession of artificial sweeteners 
that claim at first to be healthy, only later to be proven to be full of side 
effects. These authorities say that Splenda has more in common with DDT than 
with food.</p> 
<p> What do we believe? We think that our regulatory system doesn&rsquo;t do a 
good enough job ensuring our long-term safety. We&rsquo;re concerned about the 
bigger picture, too &mdash; the dependence on sweets in the American diet to 
make us feel good &mdash; whether those sweets are satisfied by sugar or 
artificial sweeteners like Splenda. And we are especially sensitive to the 
women who can benefit from using artificial sweeteners as a bridge to a better 
life with healthier nutrition.</p> 
<p> What should you think about artificial sweeteners? We want you to be fully 
informed about the dangers of Splenda (which isn&rsquo;t what food marketers 
want!) so you can make the best choices for yourself and for your family. So 
let&rsquo;s make sure you are.</p> 
<p> <strong>Splenda</strong> &mdash; the public health experiment</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Low&ndash;sugar&rdquo; is the successor to the 
&ldquo;low&ndash;carb&rdquo; craze, even though they are essentially the same 
thing. According to the<em>New York Times</em>, by the end of this summer 11% 
of the food items on supermarket shelves will be labeled &ldquo;reduced 
sugar&rdquo; &mdash; most of those targeted at kids and their health-conscious 
moms. Sales in granulated sugar have dropped four percent in the past six 
months. What&rsquo;s behind this trend? Splenda.</p> 
<p> Products featuring Splenda are perceived as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; because 
even the FDA&rsquo;s press release about sucralose parrots the claim that 
&ldquo;it is made from sugar&rdquo; &mdash; an assertion disputed by the Sugar 
Association, which is suing Splenda&rsquo;s manufacturer, McNeil Nutritionals.
</p> 
<p> The FDA has no definition for &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; so please bear with 
us for a biochemistry moment: Splenda is the trade name for sucralose, a 
synthetic compound stumbled upon in 1976 by scientists in Britain seeking a new 
pesticide formulation. It is true that the Splenda molecule is comprised of 
sucrose (sugar) &mdash; except that three of the<em>hydroxyl</em> groups in the 
molecule have been replaced by three<em>chlorine</em> atoms. (To get a better 
picture of what this looks like, see thisimage of a sucralose molecule.)</p> 
<p> While some industry experts claim the molecule is similar to table salt or 
sugar, other independent researchers say it has more in common with pesticides. 
That&rsquo;s because the bonds holding the carbon and chlorine atoms together 
are more characteristic of a chlorocarbon than a salt &mdash; and most 
pesticides are chlorocarbons. The premise offered next is that just because 
something contains chlorine doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that it&rsquo;s toxic. And 
that is also true, but you and your family may prefer not to serve as test 
subjects for the latest post-market artificial sweetener experiment &mdash; 
however &ldquo;unique.&rdquo; (See our article on endocrine disruptors for more 
information on toxins and persistent organic pollutants.)</p> 
<p> Once it gets to the gut, sucralose goes largely unrecognized in the body 
as food &mdash; that&rsquo;s why it has no calories. The majority of people 
don&rsquo;t absorb a significant amount of Splenda in their small intestine 
&mdash; about 15% by some accounts. The irony is that your body tries to clear 
unrecognizable substances by digesting them, so it&rsquo;s not unlikely that 
the healthier your gastrointestinal system is, the more you&rsquo;ll absorb the 
chlorinated molecules of Splenda.</p> 
<p> So, is Splenda safe? The truth is we just don&rsquo;t know yet. There are 
no long-term studies of the side effects of Splenda in humans. The 
manufacturer&rsquo;s own short-term studies showed that very high doses of 
sucralose (far beyond what would be expected in an ordinary diet) caused 
shrunken thymus glands, enlarged livers, and kidney disorders in rodents. (A 
more recent study also shows that Splenda significantly decreases beneficial 
gut flora.) But in this case, the FDA decided that because these studies 
weren&rsquo;t based on human test animals, they were not conclusive. Of course, 
rats had been chosen for the testing specifically because they metabolize 
sucralose more like humans than any other animal used for testing. In other 
words, the FDA has tried to have it both ways &mdash; they accepted the 
manufacturer&rsquo;s studies on rats because the manufacturer had shown that 
rats and humans metabolize the sweetener in similar ways, but shrugged off the 
safety concerns on the grounds that rats and humans are different. In our view, 
determining that something is safe (or not) in laboratory rats isn&rsquo;t a 
definitive answer, as we&rsquo;ve seen countless examples of foods and drugs 
that have proved dangerous to humans that were first found to be safe in 
laboratory rats, both in short- and long-term studies.</p> 
<p> Here are two other reasons for our concern: first, in the eleven years 
after Splenda was put on the market, no independent studies of sucralose 
lasting more than six months have been done in humans. Second, none of the 
trials that were done was very large &mdash; the largest was 128 people studied 
for three months, making us wonder,<em>what happens when you&rsquo;ve used 
sucralose for a year, or two, or ten?</em> Then there&rsquo;s the fact that 
Splenda, as a product, consists of more than just sucralose&mdash;it&rsquo;s 
made with dextrose, and sometimes also with maltodextrin,<em>neither</em> of 
which were included in the original studies and trials of sucralose. So the 
reality is that we are the guinea pigs for Splenda.</p> 
<p> And now, are our children the next trial group? Thanks to an agreement 
between McNeil Nutritionals (makers of Splenda) and PTO Today, which provides 
marketing and fund-raising aid to parents&rsquo; associations, your elementary 
school&rsquo;s next bake sale may be sponsored by Splenda &mdash; complete with 
baked goods made with the product.</p> 
<h2> Splenda side effects</h2> 
<p> Evidence that there are side effects of Splenda is accumulating little by 
little. Sucralose has been implicated as a possible migraine trigger, for 
example. Self-reported adverse reactions to Splenda or sucralose collected by 
the Sucralose Toxicity Information Center include skin rashes/flushing, 
panic-like agitation, dizziness and numbness, diarrhea, swelling, muscle aches, 
headaches, intestinal cramping, bladder issues, and stomach pain. These show up 
at one end of the spectrum &mdash; in the people who have an allergy or 
sensitivity to the sucralose molecule. But no one can say to what degree 
consuming Splenda affects the rest of us, and there are no long-term studies in 
humans with large numbers of subjects to say one way or the other if it&rsquo;s 
safe for<em>everyone</em>.</p> 
<p> If this sounds familiar, it should: we went down the same path with 
aspartame, the main ingredient in Equal and NutraSweet. Almost all of the 
independent research into aspartame found dangerous side effects in rodents. 
The FDA chose not to take these findings into account when it approved 
aspartame for public use. Over the course of 15 years, those same side effects 
increasingly appeared in humans. Not in everyone, of course &mdash; but in 
those who were vulnerable to the chemical structure of aspartame.</p> 
<p> As food additives, artificial sweeteners are not subject to the same 
gauntlet of FDA safety trials as pharmaceuticals. Most of the testing is funded 
by the food industry, which has a vested interest in the outcome. This can lead 
to misleading claims on both sides.</p> 
<p> But one thing is certain: some of the chemicals that comprise artificial 
sweeteners are known hazards &mdash; the degree to which you experience side 
effects just depends on your individual biochemistry. Manufacturers are banking 
on the fact that our bodies won&rsquo;t absorb very much of these compounds at 
any one time. And many of us don&rsquo;t. But what happens when we are 
ingesting a combination of artificial sweeteners like Splenda dozens of times a 
week through many different &ldquo;low&ndash;sugar&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;sugar&ndash;free&rdquo; products?</p> 
<p> People have been using artificial sweeteners for decades. Some react 
poorly, some don&rsquo;t &mdash; the problem is, you never know until 
you&rsquo;re already sick. Scientists are calling Splenda a mild mutagen, based 
on how much is absorbed. Right now, it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess what 
portion of the population is being exposed to the dangers of Splenda or already 
suffering from Splenda side effects. Until an independent, unbiased research 
group conducts long-term studies on humans (six months is hardly long-term!), 
how can we be certain? With all the new Splenda products on our shelves, it 
looks as if we are now in the process of another grand public experiment 
&mdash; without our permission. And we may not know the health implications for 
decades. As with all things, time will unveil truth.</p> 
<p> So I urge you to be concerned about the potential dangers of Splenda 
&mdash; as with any unnatural substance you put in your body. And I am 
especially concerned about its use for children, which I recommend you avoid. 
But unlike many holistic practitioners, I do think artificial sweeteners can 
serve a purpose for some women. And that has to do with the old question 
&mdash; which is better, sugar or an artificial sweetener? Let&rsquo;s start 
with sugar, where the problems all begin.</p> 
<h2> Sugar and insulin: the energy rush</h2> 
<p> Like Pooh Bear and the honey jar, sweet treats are the comfort food of 
choice for most of us. Usually we&rsquo;ve had powerful emotional incentives 
set up in childhood &mdash; like getting a lollipop after a doctor&rsquo;s 
visit &mdash; and most of us unconsciously associate sugar with love, pleasure, 
and reward. Why else would we call our dear ones &ldquo;honey,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;sugar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sweetie&rdquo;?</p> 
<p> There&rsquo;s an equally strong biological urge here that&rsquo;s 
hard-wired. We&rsquo;re predisposed to seek out sugar when we can find it. 
After all, sugar (sucrose) is a carbohydrate. It&rsquo;s metabolized directly 
into blood sugar, or glucose, which fuels our brain and muscles. The purer the 
source, the faster it gets into the bloodstream, bypassing much of the 
digestive process.</p> 
<p> Eating sugar shoots our blood sugar levels up and triggers a spike in the 
hormone insulin, which is needed to prep our cells to absorb the sugar. If 
there are no other nutrients to sustain our blood sugar level, it crashes as 
quickly as it rises &mdash; and we crave another hit. This is how sugar 
addiction begins.</p> 
<p> Moreover, sugar floods us with pleasure by stimulating the release of the 
neurotransmitter serotonin, and probably other mood-elevating substances. 
Scientists report that eating chocolate initiates a brain response similar to 
falling in love.</p> 
<p> And so our brains have learned over time to equate the taste of 
&ldquo;sweet&rdquo; with a rapid infusion of energy and pleasure &mdash; a good 
thing when food was hard-won and life a battle to survive. Even now when we eat 
sweet foods, special taste buds trigger enzymes that prime our brain to 
anticipate this extra boost. With a balanced diet and a healthy metabolism, a 
calorie&ndash;control mechanism kicks in after a few minutes to regulate the 
desire for more food, including the satiety hormone leptin. But with too much 
sugar, we eat and eat and can&rsquo;t get satisfied. (For more on this process, 
see our article on insulin resistance.)</p> 
<p> Another big difference between prehistoric times and now is that sugar 
back then came solely from complex natural sources that had other nutritional 
qualities, such as fruit, honey, bark, and leaves. And because naturally sweet 
food is seasonal, ripening with the sun in the summer or growing almost 
exclusively in warm climates, it was relatively rare in past times.</p> 
<p> The evolution of <strong>sugar</strong></p> 
<p> Over thousands of years our bodies used naturally sweet food safely and 
efficiently in this way. But then what happened? As our knowledge evolved, we 
grew adept at refining pure sugar from its food source. Sugar became its own 
food group &mdash; an empty calorie, devoid of protein, fat, or fiber &mdash; 
but still relatively rare.</p> 
<p> As shipping and trade routes grew, sugar became widely available. New 
refining technology put granulated white sugar on every table, replacing the 
more nutritionally complex honey, molasses, barley and maple sugars. These had 
been generally added to food after preparation or to taste during baking and 
preserving, not pumped into the food itself.</p> 
<p> Enter the modern era with its advanced food-processing techniques and 
competitive food companies, and presto! Refined sugar is everywhere and in 
everything.</p> 
<p> Sugar is a food processor&rsquo;s fantasy: it&rsquo;s cheap, it adds bulk 
and texture, and it makes consumers prefer their product over a less-sweet 
alternative. So now consumers get sugar everywhere, from simple carbohydrates 
(so-called white food) to pure granulated sugar, and in other forms like 
dextrose, fruit juice concentrate, maltodextrin, and high&ndash;fructose corn 
syrup. These empty calories take the place of real nutrients &mdash; so while 
we eat and gain weight, we&rsquo;re actually starving our cells.</p> 
<h2> The health effects of sugar</h2> 
<p> What happens to our metabolism, on all that sugar? Remember, we&rsquo;re 
still primitive at a cellular level. What starts out initially as a survival 
tool quickly becomes a crutch if sugar is easy to procure. A sugar craving 
(which is really a craving for an energy and serotonin surge) becomes a habit.
</p> 
<p> We unwittingly reprogram our biochemistry to perpetuate these cravings. 
What&rsquo;s more, this process is exacerbated by stress &mdash; because 
that&rsquo;s when your body needs immediate energy and serotonin. We often put 
our bodies through the binge&ndash;crash cycle several times a day. Your fatigue
 tells you to have that extra cup of coffee or high&ndash;carb snack at 
mid-morning and again in the afternoon.</p> 
<p> When you look at the huge increase in sugar in our diets this past century 
&mdash; particularly in processed foods &mdash; you see that it marches in step 
with the epidemic increase in metabolic diseases. According to the US 
Department of Agriculture, the average American is supplied with 140 pounds of 
caloric sweeteners per year. That&rsquo;s 43 teaspoons for every man, woman and 
child every day! The USDA recommends an average of 10 teaspoons a day for a 
healthy adult (still too much for most women, in my book). The biggest sources 
are the corn sugar and corn syrup found in beverages like juice drinks and soda.
</p> 
<p> If we really listened to our bodies, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t consume so 
much sugar. Our love affair with sugar has enjoyed a slow and subtle evolution 
&mdash; with daily nudges from the food industry. But our bodies simply 
aren&rsquo;t equipped to handle such large amounts of sugar on a daily basis. 
Even in the short term, too much sugar can trigger headaches, tooth decay, and 
indigestion.</p> 
<p> Over time, your body loses the ability to make enough sugar-digesting 
enzymes to meet the demand, and sugar sensitivity develops. Women tend to 
notice this more during perimenopause, when excess sugar and other simple 
carbohydrates triggersymptoms of hormonal imbalance.</p> 
<p> Excess sugar consumption also upsets the balance of  intestinal flora in 
your digestive tract and can cause symptoms of intestinal distress such as 
bloating, cramping, and gas. Other symptoms of sugar sensitivity are headaches, 
insomnia, aggression, panic attacks, irritability, mood swings, and depression. 
Too much sugar can deplete levels of serotonin, the neurotransmitter whose 
deficiency is linked to depression. What&rsquo;s worse, low levels of serotonin 
actually trigger more sugar cravings.</p> 
<p> New studies in accelerated aging link elevated sugar intake with a process 
called glycosylation: proteins in our bodies morph into AGE&rsquo;s, or<em>
advanced glycosylation end-products</em>, a kind of metabolic debris that 
collects in our organ, joint, and skin tissues.</p> 
<p> Long-term sugar intolerance leads to type 2 diabetes and other 
complications like obesity and inflammation. Drinking more than one soda a day 
raises your risk of serious weight gain by 80%.</p> 
<p> If it&rsquo;s a natural food, why is sugar so hard to digest? Again, 
it&rsquo;s the sheer quantity not the substance itself that causes concern. 
Studies show that our bodies actually work harder in sugar&rsquo;s afterburn to 
restore metabolic homeostasis.</p> 
<p> So is it any surprise that we&rsquo;ve turned to artificial sweeteners for 
answers? For women trying to stay healthy, artificial sweeteners can seem like 
the best of both worlds &mdash; sugar without calories. But there simply is no 
free lunch. Artificial sweeteners can be just as troublesome, with one 
exception: sugar addiction &mdash; those of us who simply cannot stop eating 
sugar once we start. In this case, artificial sweeteners may help short-circuit 
the dependency.</p> 
<p> <strong>Aspartame and saccharin</strong>: are they safer than Splenda?</p> 
<p> Aside from Splenda, the most popular artificial sweeteners are aspartame 
(and its cousin, neotame) and saccharin. Foods with these additives are 
marketed to women as low-fat, low-sugar, and low-calorie.</p> 
<p> Diet programs like Weight Watchers sell low-calorie foods that trade real 
nutrients for artificial ingredients, including sugar substitutes. I think 
it&rsquo;s great to try and lose unwanted weight, but I question whether these 
packaged items should be marketed as healthy choices. Good nutrition needs to 
take more into account than calories and fat content &mdash; especially when it 
comes to how many artificial sweeteners we&rsquo;re eating and what we&rsquo;re 
mixing them with.</p> 
<h2> Dangers in aspartame</h2> 
<p> Aspartame, the main ingredient in Equal and NutraSweet, is responsible for 
the most serious cases of poisoning, because the body actually digests it. 
Aspartame should be avoided by most women, but particularly in those with 
neuropsychiatric concerns. Recent studies in Europe show that aspartame use can 
result in an accumulation of formaldehyde in the brain, which can damage your 
central nervous system and immune system and cause genetic trauma. The FDA 
admits this is true, but claims the amount is low enough in most that it 
shouldn&rsquo;t raise concern. I think any amount of formaldehyde in your brain 
is too much.</p> 
<p> Aspartame has had the most complaints of any food additive available to 
the public. It&rsquo;s been linked with MS, lupus, fibromyalgia and other 
central nervous disorders. Possible side effects of aspartame include 
headaches, migraines, panic attacks, dizziness, irritability, nausea, 
intestinal discomfort, skin rash, and nervousness. Some researchers have linked 
aspartame with depression and manic episodes. It may also contribute to male 
infertility.</p> 
<h2> Saccharin</h2> 
<p> Saccharin, the first widely available chemical sweetener, is hardly 
mentioned any more. Better-tasting NutraSweet took its place in almost every 
diet soda, but saccharin is still an ingredient in some prepared foods, gum, 
and over-the-counter medicines. Remember those carcinogen warnings on the side 
of products that contained saccharin? They no longer appear because industry 
testing showed that saccharin only caused bladder cancer in rats. Most 
researchers agree that in sufficient doses, saccharin is carcinogenic in 
humans. The question is, how do you know how much artificial sweeteners your 
individual body can tolerate?</p> 
<p> That being said, some practitioners think saccharin in moderation is the 
best choice if you must have an artificially sweetened beverage or food 
product. It&rsquo;s been around a relatively long time and seems to cause fewer 
problems than aspartame. I don&rsquo;t argue with this recommendation, but I 
encourage you to find out as much as you can about any chemical before you 
ingest it.</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are body toxins. They are never a good idea for 
pregnant women, children or teenagers &mdash; despite the reduced sugar content 
&mdash; because of possible irreversible cell damage. If you decide it&rsquo;s 
worth the risks, then go ahead, but pay attention to your body and your 
cravings. Once you start tracking your response to artificial sweeteners, it 
may surprise you.</p> 
<p> Short-circuiting the <strong>insulin</strong> spike</p> 
<p> Basically, artificial sweeteners confuse your brain. The enzymes in your 
mouth begin a cascade that primes your cell receptors for an insulin surge, and 
when it doesn&rsquo;t arrive your brain feels cheated. That&rsquo;s why most 
diet sodas are loaded with caffeine &mdash; so you&rsquo;ll still feel a jolt.
</p> 
<p> But even if your brain is distracted momentarily, soon enough it wants the 
energy boost you promised it &mdash; and you find yourself craving 
carbohydrates. In one study, people who used artificial sweeteners ate up to 
three times the amount of calories as the control group. But again, this is 
individual. It all comes down to the brain&rsquo;s perception of calories, 
which can get thrown off whenever artificial ingredients are substituted for 
whole food.</p> 
<p> In my practice I&rsquo;ve seen that many patients are better able to break 
their addiction to sugar and maintain weight loss with the help of sugar 
substitutes. This is probably because insulin is not involved. Also, the 
substitutes are hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, so you may use less of 
them. In certain cases, I think moderate use of artificial sweeteners is okay 
&mdash; as long as you feel well.</p> 
<p> But you should know that sugar substitutes don&rsquo;t have to be 
artificial. There is another way!</p> 
<p> <strong>Stevia and sorbitol</strong> &mdash; natural alternatives to 
artificial sweeteners</p> 
<p> Other countries and diabetics have both taught us a lot about controlling 
insulin naturally. For many years, diabetics have used products sweetened with 
polyalcohol sugars like sorbitol, xylitol, malitol, and mannitol. These are 
natural sweeteners that do not trigger an insulin reaction. (Xylitol can be 
derived from birch tree pulp.) They have half the calories of sugar and are not 
digested by the small intestine.</p> 
<p> While most polyalcohol sugars have no side effects, sorbitol is a natural 
laxative and can cause diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, bloating and 
flatulence.</p> 
<p> For this reason, we recommend the herb stevia (<em>Stevia rebaudiana</em>) 
over sorbitol as a natural sweetener to our patients. Known in South America as 
the &ldquo;sweet herb,&rdquo; stevia has been used for over 400 years without 
ill effect. Stevia has been enormously popular in Japan, where it has been in 
use for more than 20 years, now rivaling Equal and Sweet&rsquo;N Low. 
It&rsquo;s 200&ndash;300 times sweeter than sugar, so just a small portion of 
stevia will sweeten even a strong cup of tea.</p> 
<p> We&rsquo;ve known about stevia in the US since 1918, but pressure from the 
sugar import trade blocked its use as a commodity. Today stevia is slowly 
gaining steam as a sugar substitute, despite similar hurdles. The FDA has 
approved its use as a food supplement, but not as a food additive due to a lack 
of studies. Stevia can be used for anything you might use sugar in, including 
baking. It is naturally low in carbohydrates. You can buy stevia at most health 
food stores and over the web. There will always be those who have a sensitivity 
to a substance, but based on reports from other countries it appears to have 
little to no side effects. For women who want to move through their cravings 
for sugar without artificial chemicals, stevia is a great option.</p> 
<p> More importantly, you can do a lot to support your body in other ways to 
reduce your dependency on sugar and sugar substitutes &mdash; something I 
encourage every woman to do. Once your body returns to its natural state of 
balance, you may find that you can toss out those artificial sweeteners and put 
sugar in its proper place: where you have control over it and not vice versa.
</p> 
<p> Artificial sweeteners are chemicals, not food! They have no calories 
because they don&rsquo;t nourish your body in anyway &mdash; they&rsquo;re 
toxins your body has to clear, or, depending on how well you detoxify, store. 
But if you can&rsquo;t live without your diet drink, don&rsquo;t beat yourself 
up about it. Accept it and give your body extra support elsewhere.</p> 
<p> Living the sweet life with better nutrition</p> 
<p> At our practice, we encourage our patients to build their snacks and meals 
from whole food, which means food that has not been processed and manipulated. 
Your food should resemble its source as closely as possible (e.g., fresh fish, 
not fish sticks). And this includes sugar. Even if you don&rsquo;t have a 
reaction or sensitivity to sugar, continue to use refined sugar rarely, if 
ever. Instead, sweeten sparingly with the more nutritionally complex natural 
sugars such as honey, rice syrup, molasses, and maple syrup.</p> 
<p> If you already suffer from weight gain, diabetes, inflammation, chronic 
pain, migraines, headaches, or depression, you may have sugar intolerance. 
Check with your healthcare practitioner and try the elimination diet, 
eliminating sugar entirely from your diet for a couple of weeks, then 
reintroducing it for a day to see how you feel. Many of our patients are amazed 
at how much better they feel after breaking the sugar habit.</p> 
<p> Remember these healthy habits:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Take a daily multivitamin to support your body&rsquo;s nutritional 
needs.</strong></p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Eat protein, healthy fats and complex carbohydrates for breakfast.
</strong> Simple carbs and sugar fire up your insulin receptors and spark those 
sugar cravings. Starting your day with a sugary or high-carb breakfast dooms 
you to a day of up-and-down blood sugar levels &mdash; which will drive you to 
eat too much of the wrong things all day long.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Shop the perimeter of your grocery store</strong> &mdash; avoid 
the processed foods in the center aisles. Read all labels and be wary of food 
that contains aspartame, neotame, saccharin, acesulfame K, or sucralose. No 
studies have been done on the safety of mixing artificial sweeteners, and who 
wants to become a living, breathing test subject. So if you consume them, do so 
prudently.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Minimize or avoid products that have sugar, high-fructose corn 
syrup or corn syrup near the top of their ingredient list.</strong> Sugar can 
also be disguised as evaporated cane juice, cane sugar, beet sugar, glucose, 
sucrose, maltose, maltodextrin, dextrose, sorbitol, fructose, corn sugar, fruit 
juice concentrate, barley malt, caramel, and carob syrup.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Keep a bowl of fresh ripe fruit nearby to snack on,</strong> to 
relieve your sugar cravings. Think primitive and eat fruit that is in season. 
The fresher the fruit, the more succulent and satisfying it will be. You may 
find you don&rsquo;t need anything sweeter!</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>If you are craving something sweet, don&rsquo;t feel guilty.
</strong> We&rsquo;re often made to feel that avoiding sugar is only matter of 
willpower, but it&rsquo;s more complicated than that. Most of the time, 
uncontrollable or patterned cravings stem from a malfunctioning metabolism or 
low serotonin. Work on healthy nutrition and you&rsquo;ll find your cravings 
will disappear.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Indulge yourself sometimes.</strong> Remember, we have sweet taste 
buds for a reason. Try a piece of fruit first &mdash; you may find your craving 
diminishes. If you still want a piece of chocolate or pie, go ahead! But savor 
it slowly like a rare treat you may not have again for a while. Once your brain 
is allowed to fully register the experience, you may find you&rsquo;re sated 
after a few bites. And, to help balance out the accompanying insulin surge, eat 
a piece of protein with it. Just make it a treat, not a habit.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Remember that wine and alcohol are sugar.</strong> When it comes 
to sugar, having a glass or two of wine every day is just like a daily dessert.
</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> Take a short walk after eating and breathe in deeply.</p> It&rsquo;s 
likely you won&rsquo;t want dessert after all! And if you do, you&rsquo;ll 
appreciate it more.
<p></p></li> 
<li> 
<p> <strong>Focus more on what you&rsquo;d like to cook and eat than what you 
shouldn&rsquo;t.</strong> If you listen to your body, it may surprise you with 
a craving for eggs, not a diet soda.</p> </li> </ul> 
<p> Finding comfort in the right places</p> 
<p> After taking a closer look at what you eat, it may also be useful for you 
to examine the role sweet food plays in your life. This often ties in to deep 
associations and emotions buried in childhood. Perhaps you always crave sugar 
in the mornings because you associate family, home, and security with the 
pancake breakfasts your mother used to make.</p> 
<p> But just as a pancake breakfast won&rsquo;t satisfy your emotional 
longings, fake sugar won&rsquo;t feed your body&rsquo;s needs &mdash; nor real 
sugar, for that matter. There simply are no shortcuts in that department. 
Facing what is really going on in our emotions, our bodies, and our lives can 
be challenging, and it&rsquo;s tempting to take the easy out, buffeted by 
sugary treats and comfort food. In my experience, that path only leads back to 
the same place &mdash; more pain, and eventually, sickness.</p> 
<p> So I encourage you to nourish yourself from the inside out, with healthy 
food, self-care, and healthy relationships. In life there is bound to be some 
bitterness &mdash; the secret is to restore enough balance to delight in the 
sweet.</p>
