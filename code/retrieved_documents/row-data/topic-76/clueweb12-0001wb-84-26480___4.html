 One lump or two? Though many a good coffee 
connoisseur takes their brew strong and black, adding a bit of something sweet 
is a practice enjoyed by many. What exactly is the difference between white and 
brownsugar, and what the heck is &quot;turbinado&quot; sugar? <br>
<br>
<b>
White Sugar</b> <br>
 White sugar is the most common sweetener used in tea or 
coffee. You can get white sugar in regular granulated form, or finer ground as 
icing sugar or confectioner's sugar. Powdered sugar isn't typically used for 
simple beverage sweetening. White sugar is processed from sugar cane to have 
the molasses removed, and then it's filtered, crystalized and dried.<br>
<br>

<b>Brown Sugar</b> <br>
 Brown sugar is my personal favorite. I love the 
heavier flavour in my coffee. It's made by adding the molasses back to regular 
white sugar, which makes it much moister and more prone to clumping than white 
sugar. I have heard that a piece of white bread in the container will keep your 
brown sugar soft.<br>
<br>
<b>Raw Sugar</b> <br>
 Raw sugar is very similar to 
brown sugar, except this is sugar that hasn't been processed into white. So it 
has its natural molasses content intact. It's lighter than brown sugar in 
flavour, but the texture is more coarse (almost like kosher salt).<br>
<br>
<b>
Turbinado Sugar</b> <br>
 Another name for raw sugar, mentioned above. Other 
names for raw sugar are Muscovado and Demerara sugar. These are not literally 
identical, but they are the products produced at different stages of sugar 
processing. The differences between them are slight.<br>
<br>
<b>Honey</b> <br>

 Of course, honey isn't a kind of sugar, but it's a popular sweet touch 
nonetheless. Produced by bees, it's a very natural form of sweetener that 
requires next to no processing before use. Liquid honey will crystalize over 
time, but whipped honey will remain soft (like butter) indefinately.<br>
<br>

<b>Stevia</b> <br>
 I thought I'd add this less common sweet selection that is 
gaining acceptance. It's actually an herbal product that is far sweeter than 
sugar. The botanical name is<i>Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni</i>. Stevia sweeteners 
can be found in many health food stores, or even grown in your own garden. More 
onstevia. <br>
<br>
 Some people choose one form of sugar over another for 
various health or nutrition reasons. Any added benefit from the extra molasses 
in either brown or raw sugar is pretty negligible, considering the small 
amounts added to your drinks.<br>
