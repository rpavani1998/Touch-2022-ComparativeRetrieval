<h4>What&rsquo;s the difference and what&rsquo;s it matter to you?</h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>You know that getting too much sugar isn&rsquo;t good for you. So when you 
find yourself in a situation that demands a sugary treat, you often go for the 
artificial stuff, expecting it to be healthier for you. But are artificial 
sweeteners all they&rsquo;re cracked up to be, or would you be better off with 
the natural choice?</p> 
<p>Read on to learn what you can expect to get out of natural sugar compared 
to the manmade alternatives.</p> 
<h4><strong>Artificial Packs More Punch</strong></h4> 
<p>You may think you can use as much artificial sweetener as you want, but be 
careful. As sugar substitutes are much sweeter than sugar, adding the same 
amount of artificial sweetener as you would natural sugar can ruin the flavor 
of your drink or favorite dessert.</p> 
<h4><strong>Real Is Fatter</strong></h4> 
<p>Compared to artificial sweeteners, real sugar has more calories, making it 
easier to gain weight when consuming real sugar. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean 
artificial sugars are fat-free. In fact, many people who primarily consume 
artificial sweeteners wind up gaining more weight than their real-sugar-eating 
counterparts. Why? Because they think since artificial sweetener has fewer 
calories, they can eat more. This leads to the consumption of more cookies, 
cakes, and other foods filled with useless calories.</p>  Did you know that 
many people eat nearly 20 teaspoons of sugar a day? 
<h4><strong>They&rsquo;re Not Carcinogenic</strong></h4> 
<p>When sugar alternatives first hit the market, there was a big scare that 
artificial sweeteners were linked to cancer. However, after a number of careful 
studies, researchers disproved this idea, as they found no definitive link 
between cancer risk and use of artificial sweeteners.</p> 
<h4><strong>All Are Considered Safe</strong></h4> 
<p>In order to be on your grocer&rsquo;s shelf, natural and artificial 
sweeteners must meet approval by the appropriate regulating body. In America, 
this is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the FDA has approved five 
artificial sweeteners: saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, D-tagatose, and 
acesulfame potassium. Another sweetener making big waves is stevia. Though it 
cannot be sold as an artificial sweetener in America, it is sold as a dietary 
supplement after more than 20 years of safe use in Japan.</p> 
<h4><strong>Fake May Improve Your Health</strong></h4> 
<p>While the jury is still out, early testing has found that use of aspartame 
may actually give your health the upper hand. In a study at Oklahoma Medical 
Research Foundation, researchers found aspartame to be useful in providing pain 
relief to individuals suffering from sickle cell anemia, osteoarthritis, and 
multiple sclerosis. Only time will tell if these initial findings will hold up 
and artificial sweeteners will one day be used as a medical therapy.</p> 
<h4><strong>You May Have Symptoms</strong></h4> 
<p>Though artificial sweeteners haven&rsquo;t been found to bring about cancer 
or other dangerous and deadly diseases, they can have mild side effects on 
certain people. Some of the most common include an upset stomach and headaches. 
In the event you find yourself experiencing either of these symptoms, lay off 
the artificial to find out if that&rsquo;s the cause of your problems.</p> 
<h4><strong>Moderation Is Key</strong></h4> 
<p>For most people, eating natural sugar or using artificial sweeteners 
isn&rsquo;t going to cause big weight fluctuations or health problems. However, 
eating too much of any kind of sweetener &ndash; whether it is natural or 
manmade &ndash; is where trouble comes in. It is especially dangerous to 
consume excessive sugar if you&rsquo;re living with diabetes. Stay safe with 
your sweets by avoiding too much of any good thing.</p> 
<h4>How&rsquo;s It Get White?</h4> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen sugar right off the cane, you know that sugar 
isn&rsquo;t naturally white. Instead, it is yellow or brown. So how do they 
come up with that pure, white color for the sugar you may use every day? 
Through a bleaching process. In other words, the white sugar you use in your 
tea is essentially an artificial sweetener. Want nothing but nature? Better 
make sure your sugar is brown and yellow.</p>

<h2>Testimonials</h2> <strong>I feel stronger and more energetic than I have 
in years</strong> <br>
 &quot;I can't stop talking about Maplewood Boot Camp 
and Carlos Sanchez! Within two months, I dropped the remaining &quot;Baby 
weight&quot; and I feel stronger and more energetic than I have in years, and I 
mean years. The energy and strength I have found to get up BEFORE work to 
exercise is a direct result of the Bootcamp experience. I am now a stronger 
runner and a happier mom as a result of this class.&quot;<br>
 &mdash;Deborah 
Holt, Maplewood<br>

<strong>I feel amazing!</strong> <br>
 &ldquo;I just wanted to send you a note 
to tell you how GREAT I feel! I never thought &quot;working out&quot; could be 
so much fun! It's like going to gym class. It's great how everyone in the Boot 
Camp supports each other and helps each other to keep going. I took your advice 
about eating better and making better choices with what I eat. I feel amazing! 
Thanks you so much for making this a wonderful experience.&quot;<br>
 
&mdash;Katie Clayton, South Orange<br>

<strong>Carlos is a 
very knowledgeable and encouraging personal trainer</strong> <br>
 &quot;I 
signed up for the Maplewood boot camp in February to help me loose the 8lbs I 
had gained while recovering from knee surgery. I lost the weight, gained 
strength, energy and flexibility. Carlos is a very knowledgeable and 
encouraging personal trainer. Whenever necessary he modified and guided me 
through the routine. I am now a Maplewood boot camp groupie.&quot;<br>

<strong>Carlos is a 
great motivator</strong> <br>
 &ldquo;Maplewood Boot Camps is a great program 
that provides a fun, efficient and really effective work out! Carlos is a great 
motivator. Since starting the program, I have lost 10 pounds, dropped a size in 
my jeans and gained so much strength and energy. Also, I really enjoy 
exercising outdoors in the morning, especially because I work inside an office 
most days.&rdquo;<br>
 &mdash;Jamie Z., Maplewood <br>

<strong>Since I began 
boot camp I have lost about twenty pounds</strong> <br>
 &ldquo;Since I began 
boot camp I have lost about twenty pounds and gone down several dress/pant 
sizes. I love how this program has made me feel about myself. And as I keep 
telling everyone--it is wonderful working out outside. There is something 
magical about doing a sun salutation and looking up and seeing the sun actually 
rising. Thanks for being there Carlos. Good for you!&quot;<br>
 &mdash;Shirley 
M., Maplewood<br>
