<p>I found this article to be very interesting, it talkes about how agave 
cannot be considered raw, and the not so natural process that goes through. The 
writer, Dr. Mercola is far from being a vegan, but he is all for clean, organic 
and raw food, and also for local food production/consumption:</p> 
<p>http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/07/02/Ag...</p> 
<p>Agave: A Triumph of Marketing over Truth </p> 
<p>By Dr. Mercola</p> 
<p>The popularity of agave syrup, also called agave nectar, is on a meteoric 
rise -- thanks in large part to clever marketing which positions the product as 
a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners. Agave is also heavily 
promoted as a low glycemic food, enticing diabetics. I&rsquo;ll discuss just 
how &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; agave is in a minute.</p> 
<p>The Amazing Power of Marketing</p> 
<p>In case you doubt the influence of marketing in setting trends and consumer 
buying habits, look at these statistics. Agave products more than tripled in 
number between 2003 and 2007. McCormick &amp; Co., a major food manufacturer, 
placed agave syrup in its &ldquo;top 10 fla&shy;vors&rdquo; list for 2009. 
Agave can now be found in prepared tea, energy and &ldquo;health&rdquo; drinks, 
nutrition bars, desserts, and other food items typically found in health food 
stores. Agave is also quickly crossing over from the health food market to 
mainstream grocery chains, and consumers (especially vegans and raw food 
enthusiasts) are buying up bottles of the stuff to use in place of other 
sweeteners, like honey.</p> 
<p>Why Agave Syrup is the Hottest New Trend in Sugar Alternatives?</p> 
<p>Taste. Agave has a subtle, delicate flavor many people enjoy. Sweetness. 
Agave syrup can be up to three times as sweet as table sugar, so it takes less 
to sweeten a food or beverage. Public perception. Highly effective agave 
product marketing campaigns have per&shy;suaded consumers the sweetener is a 
healthy alternative to sugar. As more and more people veer away from deadly 
artificial sweeteners and high fructose corn syrup (but not from their sugar 
addiction, unfortunately), they are on the hunt for safer, healthier 
alter&shy;natives.</p> 
<p>About the Agave Plant</p> 
<p>Agaves grow primarily in Mexico, but you can also find them in the southern 
and west&shy;ern United States, as well as in South America. Previously, it was 
most commonly known as a primary ingredient of tequila. Agaves are not cacti, 
but are actually related to the lily and amaryllis families of plants. There 
are over 100 species of agave plants, in a wide variety of sizes and colors. 
Edible parts of the agave are the flowers, leaves, stalks and the sap. It is 
the sap of the plant that is used to make agave syrup. Commercially available 
agave syrup or nectar is thought to be produced primarily from blue agave 
plants grown in Southern Mexico. This is because the blue agave has a high 
carbohydrate content, which results in a high concentration of fructose in the 
final prod&shy;uct.</p> 
<p>Harvesting the Sap</p> 
<p>When an agave plant is about seven to 10 years old, the leaves are removed 
to expose the core, or pina, of the plant. The harvested pina looks like a 
large pineapple and can weigh anywhere from 50 to 150 pounds. Sap is removed 
from the pina, filtered, and heated to break down the carbohydrates into 
sugars. The same agave plant produces all three varieties of commercially sold 
syrup, depend&shy;ing on the amount of heat used in processing. These varieties 
include:</p> 
<p>Raw (color is similar to maple syrup and flavor is similar to caramel)<br>
 
Light (lighter color and flavor than raw)<br>
 Amber (similar in color and 
flavor to raw)<br>
 Many varieties of agave nectar are processed at relatively 
low temperatures (below 118&deg;F) and are marketed as a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; food.
</p> 
<p>The Myth of Agave as a &ldquo;Healthy&rdquo; Sugar Substitute</p> 
<p>- Agave syrup is neither a natural food nor organic. Fully chemically 
processed sap from the agave plant is known as hydrolyzed high fructose inulin 
syrup. According to Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of 
Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public 
Health:</p> 
<p> &ldquo;[Agave is] almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great 
marketing.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>- Agave syrup is not low calorie. Agave syrup is about 16 calories per 
teaspoon, the same as table sugar.</p> 
<p>- Agave syrup may not have a low glycemic index. Depending upon where the 
agave comes from and the amount of heat used to proc&shy;ess it, your agave 
syrup can be anywhere from 55 percent to 90 percent fructose! (And it&rsquo;s 
likely you won&rsquo;t be able to tell from the product label.)</p> 
<p>This range of fructose content hardly makes agave syrup a logical choice if 
you&rsquo;re hoping to avoid the high levels of fructose in HFCS (high fructose 
corn syrup). And if you&rsquo;re diabetic, you should know that the alleged 
benefit of agave for diabetics is purely speculative. Very few agave studies 
have been docu&shy;mented, and most involved rats. There have been no clinical 
studies done on its safety for diabetics. Since most agave syrup has such a 
high percentage of fructose, your blood sugar will likely spike just as it 
would if you were consuming regular sugar or HFCS, and you would also run the 
risk of raising your triglyceride levels. It&rsquo;s also important to 
understand that whereas the glucose in other sugars are converted to blood 
glucose, fructose is a relatively unregulated source of fuel that your liver 
converts to fat and cholesterol.</p> 
<p>A significant danger here is that fructose does not stimulate your insulin 
secretion, nor enhance leptin production, which is thought to be involved in 
appetite regulation. (This was detailed in one of the most thorough scientific 
analyses published to date on this topic.) . Because insulin and leptin act as 
key signals in regulating how much food you eat, as well as your body weight, 
dietary fructose can also contribute to increased food intake and weight gain. 
Therefore, if you need to lose weight, fructose is one type of sugar 
you&rsquo;ll definitely want to avoid, no matter what the source is.</p> 
<p>Other Dangers of Fructose</p> 
<p>In addition, consuming high amounts of concentrated fructose may cause 
health problems ranging from mineral depletion, to insulin resistance, high 
blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even miscarriage in pregnant women. 
Fructose may also interfere with your body&rsquo;s ability to metabolize 
copper. This can result in depletion of collagen and elastin, which are vital 
connective tissues. A copper deficiency can also result in anemia, fragile 
bones, defects in your arteries, infertility, high choles&shy;terol and heart 
disease, and uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Additionally, fructose 
consumption has been shown to significantly increase uric acid. Elevated 
lev&shy;els of uric acid are markers for heart disease. It has also been shown 
to increase blood lactic acid, especially in diabetics. Elevations in lactic 
acid can result in metabolic acido&shy;sis.</p> 
<p>Isolated fructose has no enzymes, vitamins or minerals and can rob your 
body of these nutrients in order to assimilate itself. Hence, consumption of 
fructose can also lead to loss of vital minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
and zinc.</p> 
<p>Other Reasons You Should Steer Clear of Agave</p> 
<p>There are very few quality controls in place to monitor the production of 
agave syrup. Nearly all agave sold in the U.S. comes from Mexico. Industry 
insiders are concerned agave distributors are using lesser, even toxic, agave 
plants due to a shortage of blue agave. There are also concerns that some 
distributors are cutting agave syrup with corn syrup -- how often and to what 
extent is anyone&rsquo;s guess. In addition, the FDA has refused shipments of 
agave syrup due to excessive pesticide residues. Agave syrup is not a whole 
food -- it is fractionated and processed. The sap is sepa&shy;rated from the 
plant and treated with heat, similar to how maple sap is made into maple syrup. 
Agave nectar is devoid of many of the nutrients contained in the original, 
whole plant. Agave syrup is not a live food. The natural enzymes are removed to 
prevent agave syrup from fermenting and turning into tequila in your food 
pantry or cabi&shy;net. Agave is, for all intents and purposes, highly 
concentrated sugar. Sugar and sweet&shy;eners wreak havoc on your health and 
are highly addictive.</p> 
<p>The Case Against Sugar </p> 
<p>No matter your nutritional type, sugar is not good for you. Certainly you 
can tolerate small amounts if you are healthy and the majority of your diet is 
healthy, but let&rsquo;s face it the average American is consuming over 150 
pounds a year of sugar or nearly half a pound a day. Ideally your annual 
consumption should be well under ten pounds per YEAR. Sugar increases your 
insulin and leptin levels and decreases receptor sensitivity of both these 
hormones. This can lead to a wide range of health problems, including weight 
gain, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, premature aging, and 
heart dis&shy;ease. Sugar suppresses your immune system, causing problems with 
allergies and digestive disorders. It can even bring on depression. For a 
comprehensive list of the dangers of sugar to your body, read 76 ways sugar can 
destroy your health now.</p> 
<p>Worse Than Any Sugar: Artificial Sweeteners</p> 
<p>The worst of all possible choices are artificial sweeteners. They are, 
without question, far more damaging to your health than regular sugar. While I 
don&rsquo;t recommend it, consuming sugar in moderation isn&rsquo;t likely to 
cause serious health problems. Moderation in this case is five pounds or less 
per year, which is a far cry from the 150 pounds per year consumed by the 
majority of Americans. If you&rsquo;re interested in kicking your sugar 
addiction, I highly recommend trying a meridian tapping technique called Turbo 
Tapping, which has helped thousands of people kick their sugar and soda habits.
</p> 
<p>Have You Tried Stevia? </p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re determined to sweeten your foods and beverages, I urge you 
to consider using stevia. Stevia is a sweet herb, safe and natural. It is much 
sweeter than sugar, but has no calories. It is my personal choice of sweetener. 
In the U.S., you&rsquo;ll find stevia not in the sweetener aisle of your local 
grocery, but in the supplement section. It can be used in appetizers, 
beverages, soups, salads, vegetables, desserts -- just about anything.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ve tried stevia and were bothered by an aftertaste, it could 
be the way the plant was processed. You should try a few different brands until 
you find one that tastes good. However, if you have insulin issues, high blood 
pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or if you&rsquo;re overweight, I suggest 
you avoid all sweeteners, including stevia, since any sweetener can decrease 
your insulin sensitivity.</p> 
<p>For everyone else, my recommendation is to:</p> 
<p>Eliminate all artificial sweeteners<br>
 Avoid agave<br>
 Limit sugar<br>
 
Use raw, organic honey in moderation<br>
 Use regular stevia in moderation, but 
avoid stevia-based sweeteners like Truvia and PureVia</p> Top <br>

<p>I've just finished reading this article, but I still have mixed feelings. 
Whenever I read articles on Dr. Mercola's website I always read the 
reviews/responses of the members of his site. In this case of Agave people had 
both agreed and disagreed about the article.<br>
 I think personally, that in 
the world today where both ordinary people and experts and scientists seem to 
be telling us what is and isn't health, with a lot of them giving good reasons, 
the only thing that we can do as consumers is do as much research as possible 
on the food and products we consume. Then we base all the information on how we 
feel health wise consuming and not consuming said food or product, and then 
make a decision on whether or not to continue consuming said food or product.
<br> Just remember, a lot of mainstream health practitioners still believe that 
us raw fooders are nuts and will eventually became malnourished emaciated 
messed up individuals.<br>
 For myself, as a critical thinker, I intend to 
pursue this health issue on Agave and make an informed decision based upon my 
best deductive reasoning.</p> Top <br>

<p>We have always wondered about Agave. Thank you so much for the article. I 
think we will make the switch to stevia. Or like the other person above me said 
&quot;Hurray for honey&quot;!~ It's the bee's knee's ahahah :)</p> Top <br>

<p>Reading this is interesting to me - I am never sure what to believe anymore 
especially regarding Agave and Braggs liquid aminos. I always hear pros and 
cons for both sides...</p>

<p>Once again people. This is ONE ARTICLE! PLease, Please don't make your 
decision based on reading just this. This is how we all got into trouble in the 
first place. By trusting one person, or multiple people that said SAD FOOD was 
OK. All it makes me want to do is read more about Agave, and maybe find a 
source that does do it the right way, etc... I feel better than when i'm 
consuming regular sugar, so that's something for me. When I tried stevia, the 
aftertaste was SOO horrible, i don't ever want to taste it again. And the 
stevia I had was at a Organic LOcal Coffee Shop. You would think they would 
have the good stuff. but i don't know for sure. The stuff I use, which i'm sure 
lots of people do is Madhava Organic Agave Nectar. So right there, he was 
saying they aren't organic, but mine is. unless the whole &quot;organic&quot; 
label is entirely greenwashed. but i don't think so. not yet.<br>
 Read people 
read. be skeptical. just because it's on a &quot;raw food forum&quot; does not 
make it instantaneous truth.</p> Top <br>

<p>That is true, one article does not provide all the evidence. However, my 
personal problem with agave is not whether is raw, or organic, but is the fact 
that has been processed. We all know that there is a processing involved when 
agave does not go bad for weeks and weeks in our pantry.</p> 
<p>I am also concerned about the high fructose content, and the health effects 
associated to it. I will certainly keep investigating and reading to inform 
myself (although the decision in my case has already been made), and good luck 
with your own research.</p> 
<p>If you happen to find relevant information, maybe you could post it here? I 
think that it would be great to see what others find.</p> Top <br>

<p>To read the response by the president of Madhava Agave Nectar, Craig 
Gerbore, to the many attacks against agave syrup and the process by which it is 
obtained, here is a link that gives the real story. There is a lot of 
mis-information out there.
http://alteredplates.blogspot.com/2008/12/madhavas-craig-gerbore...<br>
 I, for 
one, continue to view it as a healthy sweetener...in moderation.</p> Top <br>

<p>This has actually been debated a lot quite a bit lately. I actually looked 
into it enough to know that there are some Agave Nectar out there that are 
truly raw. The fructose thing I am still not sure about, but It's definitely 
not as bad for you as HFCS. I just use it in more moderation now. I started 
putting less on my breakfast cereals and go for raw honey more often now too. 
There are a lot of things that can be bad for you in excess. I believe agave is 
still a great sweetener and will always be good in the right moderation. Give 
it some time and they will start finding problems with Stevia too. I personally 
don't really like Stevia, I will use agave or honey over that any day.</p> Top

<p>I am with you rawlizard, I prefer whole foods. Not processed 
&quot;foods&quot; or extracts. As for stevia, again, I prefer the whole 
(green!) herb, powdered. Tastes much better than the *white* powdered processed 
*extract* (or clear liquid, depending on what type of processing.) The extracts 
are bitter.</p> Top <br>

<p>I have no issues with Agave Nectar. A few reasons why I use it.. 1- I don't 
have to use as much. So to your point comparing if you eat a pound of each... 
THATS the key. With Agave I use WAY less to achieve the same sweetness. 2- Yes 
it's very high in Fructose... but that's what you find in NATURAL fruits like 
apples, etc. Fructose is absorbed into the body slower than sucrose(therefore 
the much lower glycemic index)... so there's no Spike then Crash of your blood 
sugar which is a Calorie burning screeching halt! And finally.. 3- Sugar is 
processed using Animal products such as BONE CHARCOAL! ICK!</p> Top <br>

<p>I think the info about the sugar interesting- sugar was one of the foods I 
tested intolerant to and it says it can suppress the immune system and bring on 
allergies. I never bought it but sadly it is added to nearly all processed 
foods- even organic sauces and baked beans.So it was in my diet.<br>
 I hardly 
use sweeteners now, and when I do it is organic, fair trade wild forest honey.

<p>Ummmm..... Honey is NOT Vegan.</p> 
<p>Please read this:</p>

<p>Bees are animals. Vegans don't exploit animals on purpose.</p> 
<p>Stick with the Agave if your vegan.</p> Top <br>

<p>Less of the lecture please- some of the vegan info is biased and 
exggarated. Bees looked after by small keepers here in Britain or wild forest 
bees are not exploited like the huge US bee places in the USA. I know a local 
bee keeper and bees continually make honey- they only eat a very small amount 
of it- they make far more then they would actually eat. I have rescued an 
injured bumblebee and taken care of her til she died. I don't agree with big 
scale exploitation of them and using chemicals in their hives etc but the bee 
keeper I know locally uses homeopathy for the bees if they are not well, loves 
them and cares for them. The bees have plenty of honey for themselves.Honey has 
health benefits other sweeteners don't- especially manuka.</p> Top <br>

<p>greenwood, </p> 
<p>the person that wrote that website even admits that they are biased.<br>
 
Honey is food for baby bees just like milk is food for baby cows.<br>
 There is 
no difference!!! You are stealing their food.</p> 
<p>Caging up animals against their will is exploiting them. </p> 
<p>Did you read the whole article.<br>
 It even explains bee keeping.</p> 
<p>Basically , you are saying that because bees arent as intelligent as cows, 
that it is ok to take the honey.</p> 
<p>It is ok to believe that, but then you are rating the intelligence of a 
species and saying that if they are not as intellgent then it is ok.</p> 
<p>Bees get injured by the bee keepers.<br>
 Nobody is saying bee keepers are 
bad people.</p> 
<p>Some beekeepers are better than others,, just like some factory farms are 
better than others. Still doesn't make it right!!!</p> 
<p>Honey is NOT vegan!!!<br>

<p>rawcanadian I'm 42 and been vegan/veggie for 24 years. I don't need a 
lecture from you. I think, actually I feel, that bees are in fact quite 
intelligent for insects.I love them and as I posted before I rescued one when I 
found her lying weak and dying on a pavement. I took her home and cared for her 
for 3 days- made her a shelter in a box with leaves to sit on and gave her 
honey and water. She was dying and I made her last 3 days more comfortable. I 
devoted 3 days to her and loved her.When she passed I made her a little coffin 
out of a matchbox and buried her. Would you have taken this amount of trouble 
for a bee?</p> 
<p>I will reiterate that bees make far more honey than they will ever eat and 
honey has health benefits- manuka can be used instead of antibiotics on wounds. 
Antibiotics are made by compnaies which do horrific animal testing and are 
getting resistant to bacteria strains. I think it is better to use manuka 
honey. Bees will carry on making and making honey they will never eat-they 
cannot stop themselves even when they have more than enough. The honey would be 
left sitting in hives when it could be put to good use by people. Bees work for 
themselves and the planet- their pollinating, medicinal honey, propolis etc. 
Bees should be honoured for the service they do for the planet indeed and not 
treated cruelly. Ethical bee keeping is the way to go. They evolved as a 
crucial part of the ecosystem.<br>
 And regarding eggs and milk, I'm not 
against humans taking a little eggs and milk when there is abudance of it and 
people need it to survive- that's how it started. I'm intolerant to milk and 
eggs myself so wouldn't partake.<br>
 If I knew someone who had a few pet cows 
and chickens and took some eggs and milk once in awhile I wouldn't judge them 
harshly.<br>
 I once read a biography about a girl who married a Tibetan man 
and she went to stay in Tibet with his Buddhist family for 6 months. Her 
Tibetan mother in law would only eat meat when an animal was found dead. They 
lived on land where much didn't grow and she was forced to eat meat for 
survival sometimes but she wouldn't have an animal killed for her. I don't like 
meat at all but respect what this woman did.<br>
 No cruelty was involved in 
her meat eating.<br>
 Sometimes one needs to get a wider perspective.</p> Top

<p>I'm a vegan, so I don't eat honey, of course. And I am really saddened that 
honey is taken from bees so humans have the pleasure of eating/tasting/using 
it. Someone always comes on and says &quot;well, some bee keepers care&quot; 
&quot;are gentle&quot; &quot;only take a little,&quot; etc, but those are all 
subjective conclusions made to appease someone's yearning for the honey, which 
they don't need in the first place, and the cruelty-free, gentle, peaceful way 
to live in harmony with animals is to not eat/use it.</p> 
<p> If individuals choose to eat/use honey, that's their choice, and I 
wouldn't call someone's opinion on it a &quot;lecture&quot; just because you 
disagree with them or think you've been vegetarian longer; however, one thing 
is for sure: honey is not vegan. There are definitely nonvegans on this board, 
and that is fine - they are allowed to be here and are welcome by me. The 
discussions are supposed to be vegan, though.</p> 
<p> I'm not sure why people disrespect that especially more so with regard to 
honey; I've never seen someone post that instead of eggplant, they will choose 
to eat deer. It's no jump to say that it's all in someone's head/made up that 
somehow insects are less important/more &quot;gently&quot; exploited than, say, 
a cow or a larger animal.</p> 
<p> But again, it's someone's choice to eat honey; they don't need to defend 
their choice, but the discussions here are supposed to be vegan.</p> Top <br>

<p>This is a forum. If you write something, be prepared that somebody will 
comment on it.<br>
 If you call it lecturing so be it.</p> 
<p>As far as I know this is a Raw Vegan Site, and raw vegans don't eat honey, 
because honey is NOT vegan.</p> 
<p>Not sure what Greenwoods point is regarding this.</p> 
<p>So I will ask!!</p> 
<p>Greenwood, do you realize that bees are animals??</p> 
<p>Or maybe your not vegan, then you wouldn't care about animals??</p> 
<p>No idea why you think taking something that doesn't belong to you as being 
all right as long as you leave a little for the animal you are stealing from.
</p> 
<p>Is it ok for me to take some as your hard earned money, as long as a leave 
you some??</p> 
<p>Probably not.<br>
 How can murder not be cruelaty?? LOL</p> 
<p>Meat is Murder!!!<br>
 Eating meat is murder!!!<br>
 Last time I checked , 
the meat is usually killed in order to eat it.</p> 
<p>Coming to a vegan website and saying that it is ok to eat meat, not a good 
idea LOL</p> Top <br>

<p>Actually this is the wrong thread for this:</p> 
<p>Good discussion here:<br>

http://www.veggieboards.com/newvb/showthread.php?93127-Honey-sup...</p> 
<p>Believe whatever you want, to eat honey or not eat honey, my point is just 
that it is vegan.</p> 
<p>(BTW if you eat honey , but no meat, that would make you a vegetarian not a 
vegan)</p> Top <br>

<p>Rawcanadian, I don't think questioning Greenwood about his choice of eating 
honey is appropriate on this thread. It's not vegan and shouldn't even be 
discussed on this forum. That said, if greenwood made a thread actually asking 
what people thought about it, that would be one thing. He said his piece; you 
said yours......and you're asking questions to continue the conversation in a 
way that makes Greenwood put on the defensive. This is not the thread for it, 
and I don't see any reason why Greenwood would respond to a post like that.</p>

<p>Ya, I agree. I wouldn't respond to that post either.</p> 
<p>It isn't fair to recommend honey over agave on a vegan forum.</p> 
<p>The shame LOL</p> Top <br>

<p>Superfood, how am I questioning Greenwood.</p> 
<p>I am questioning how honey is showing up on a vegan forum.</p> 
<p>If this was a vegetarian site, than fine, but to make vegetarian 
recommendations on a vegan forum is hypercritical</p> 
<p>Also please don't tell me what to do.</p> 
<p>I just wanted to point out that honey isn't vegan.</p> 
<p>Just wanted to get the facts straight for the BEES.</p> 
<p>Do what you want, do what you believe, eat honey if you want, I don't care.
</p> 
<p>But don't confuse people by saying it is ok to steal honey from bees, 
because vegans don't do that. Bees are animals too!!! Just like me and you!!!

<p>&quot;So I will ask!!</p> 
<p>Greenwood, do you realize that bees are animals??</p> 
<p>Or maybe your not vegan, then you wouldn't care about animals??</p> 
<p>No idea why you think taking something that doesn't belong to you as being 
all right as long as you leave a little for the animal you are stealing 
from.&quot;</p> 
<p>Raw canadian your post is very rude- I already told you how I cared for a 
dying bee and that I know they have intelligence. Stealing is a human word- 
squirrels have been known to &quot;steal&quot; or take peoples' sandwiches- 
going in windows and helping themselves. Animals take/steal all the time- some 
even kill other animals for food. Nature is red in tooth and claw. I'm a Druid 
and Bee is one of my totems, my consience is clear having a tiny bit of 
ethically sources honey. I do not have to live the way you tell me to- I'm 42 
and live a spiritual life, your judgement of me is rude.. I know of other 
vegans who choose to have a little ethically sound honey in their diets. I only 
go through a jar a year. I have seen posts from others here who eat honey but 
it is only me you choose to lambast. Show some respect as I will live my life 
the way feels right to me.</p> 
<p>&quot;Also please don't tell me what to do.</p> 
<p>I just wanted to point out that honey isn't vegan.</p> 
<p>Just wanted to get the facts straight for the BEES.</p> 
<p>Do what you want, do what you believe, eat honey if you want, I don't 
care.&quot;</p> 
<p>I'm not telling you what to do, asking for you to respect other peoples' 
choices and yes even if that means they eat meat- coming all critical will not 
win fans to your causes. You do care as you have been posting rather vehemently.
</p> 
<p>I told you I don't eat meat and have not done so for 24 years.I don't judge 
people like the Tibetan Buddhist who eats animals who have died of natural 
causes- some people are forced to make choices like that as they don't live in 
the West were shops are full of vegan food. Some people in the world have to 
kill animals for food as they would starve otherwise. That is the harsh fact of 
life. It is not ideal but it is how it is. I suppose you are very young and 
ideal and think everyone in the world has the opportunity to be vegan- they 
sadly don't. I wish it were so but it isn't.</p> 
<p>&quot;How can murder not be cruelaty?? LOL</p> 
<p>Meat is Murder!!!<br>
 Eating meat is murder!!!<br>
 Last time I checked , 
the meat is usually killed in order to eat it.&quot;</p> 
<p>Did you not see that I posted that the Tibetan lady only ate animals that 
had died of natural causes not killed for their meat? I certainly do not like 
meat eating, but as I said sometimes one needs to see things from a different 
perspective- some people eat animals they find dead already. Death doesn't 
always come via human hands. They die of hunger, illness and old age. Animals 
kill each other for food- how do you feel about that? The tiger rips open the 
antelope. I don't like it, but it happens.</p> Top <br>

<p>Whereas agave may not be raw, it is still much healthier than most 
sweeteners. It doesn't make your body crash out and strip it of nutirents like 
other processed sweeteners.<br>
 I have noticed a rash of these anti-agave 
articles and what I have to say is this...<br>
 It may not be &quot;the best 
thing in the world&quot; but thats okay because as a healthy person we know 
that we shouldn't eat a lot of concentrated sugars.<br>
 As a person with 
kidney problems and hypo-glycemia who really has to watch my sugar intake or I 
feel it deeply, I can tell you that agave doesn't effect me negatively unless I 
use a huge amount of it. If I ingest cane sugar, beet sugar, or high fructose 
corn syrup, I am feeling horrible within minutes.<br>
 Honey is a really great 
sweetener, but unfortunately it doesn't work for everything, and agave, 
although not as great as everyone hoped it was going to be, is still better 
than any mainstream processed sugars.<br>
 Sugar is just never going to be good 
for you in large doses.<br>
 Personally. I don't find it necessary to eat sweet 
tasting foods, as they are not good me (or anyone too much) I find the best 
solution to this problem is to train yourself to like foods even when they 
aren't sweet, even when you are used to them being sweet. I've noticed that 
this really starting enhancing your flavor receptors for other hidden wonderful 
flavors that you have been missing out out.<br>
 In the end, my conclusion is 
to be careful when taking in new information. Research can sometimes differ 
from study to study, and the most important thing is to stay cleansed and in 
touch with your body, and you will know what is good for you and not. There are 
a lot of articles debunking a lot of things that I wouldn't be as healthy 
without. Everyone is different.</p> Top <br>

<p>Why is agave NOT suppose to be healthier than the other choices???</p> 
<p>I'm still confused, because Agave has a low GL.<br>
 So if GL is a concern 
to somebody , agave should be recommended.</p> 
<p>http://www.globalgoods.com/glycemictestingagavenectar.html<br>

http://www.allaboutagave.com/agave-nectar-and-the-glycemic-index...</p> 
<p>And remember agave IS vegan, some of the other choices are NOT (like honey).

<p>BTW Vegans that eat honey are called Vegetarians, NOT Vegans.</p> 
<p>Animals that are carnivores eat other animals in nature, this is natural.
</p> 
<p>Factory farming is cruel and inhumane. There is no such thing as a GOOD 
factory farm.</p> 
<p>Factory farming is not the same as a tiger ripping apart a deer to survive.
</p> 
<p>I have never seen a person jump an animal and rip it apart with their bare 
hands and teeth.</p> 
<p>Road kill doesn't make me drool and most people are disgusted at the site 
of blood and guts.</p> 
<p>People will eat people to survive as well. It is the same as eating a cow 
or chicken, because we are animals and they are animals. However, I don't 
recommend that either. ;-)<br>
 Just because it can be done, doesn't make it 
right.</p> 
<p>So if you are vegan than leave the bees alone, or call yourself a 
honey-tarian or someting. lol</p> Top <br>

<p>Why is honey not vegan? Its not like you're eating the bee. I understand 
that honey is made in what could be called &quot;animal cruelty&quot;, but with 
the current threat of bees disappearring due to human existence, isn't it our 
responsibilty to maintain the bee population? I buy my honey from local 
beekeepers, its raw, they don't use chemicals, they don't feed the bees sugar, 
and they don't kill off the queen at the end of the season. Why isn't it okay 
to eat honey? The bees make more then enough to last themselves the winter and 
my local beekepers maintain cruelty-free practices. Like I said, its not like 
you're eating the bee.</p> Top <br>

<p>Even if, theoretically, obtaining honey from some people/beekeepers didn't 
entail harm to the bee, it's still an animal product and exploiting the 
bees/taking from them/their children - you also can't state how much the bees 
would need or want and that you're taking &quot;jsut the right amount.&quot; 
Amazing how many &quot;justifications&quot; people come up with for their 
choice to eat honey instead of just accepting it's not vegan. It's okay. So 
you're not vegan. Life goes on.</p> Top <br>

<p>Bee pollen is another one that some consider not vegan. But an interesting 
point is that the bees are robbing the plants of the pollen they worked so hard 
to produce and need to create baby plants. The world would grind to a halt 
without plants, not to mention the bees<br>
 would starve to death. </p>
