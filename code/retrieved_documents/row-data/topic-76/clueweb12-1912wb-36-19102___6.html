<h1>HTB Has Your Sweetener</h1>

 Take your pick <br>

<h2>Home Town Buffet's (HTB) Sweeteners</h2> 
<p>I think if you mention Home Town Buffet (HTB) or the Golden Corral, most 
people may get excited simply for that wide selection of delicious food choices 
at a reasonable price. But then again, it may just trigger a repulsive response 
in some people who are always counting their calories.</p> 
<p>Aside from that, I like an occasional trip to HTB. It&rsquo;s a good place 
with lots of food choices, and depending on the day, you may find your favorite 
dish served. And if you are so used to paying for your food (and drinks) 
without any thought to it then you might as well get use to the new idea on 
paying for your beverages separately which took effect sometime in 2010. And if 
you don&rsquo;t care for beverages then there is water, for free. Whether or 
not the water is filtered I can&rsquo;t tell you. Other than that, you can make 
yourself &ldquo;feel at home&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>In any case, on my recent visit, I excitedly helped myself to lots of 
cornbread, taco and beef, green salad, and so on. After the main course, I 
contemplated on what dessert to get but noticed a small white 
rectangular-shaped (3.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; x 1.5&rdquo;) porcelain with three 
different colored packages stacked neatly upright. Curiously, I pulled out each 
of the different colored packages and realized that they were artificial 
sweeteners.</p> 
<p>The pink package was the <em>Sweet &acirc;&#128;&#152;N Low brand</em>. It 
had a musical bar with the treble clef and had a statement that says, Z<em>ero 
Calorie Sweetener</em>. On the other side of it, in very tiny prints, are the 
ingredients and few pertinent information.</p> 
<p>The yellow package was the <em>Splenda</em> brand and it had the &ldquo;<em>
No Calorie Sweetene</em>r&rdquo; statement in smaller fonts. Just like the <em>
Sweet &acirc;&#128;&#152;N Low</em>, the reverse side indicated the ingredients 
except that it did not have saacharin, cream of tartar, and calcium silicate.
</p> 
<p>And the white package was HTB&rsquo;s brand. The name, Home Town Buffet was 
boldly printed on both sides and looked as if the words were ready to jump at 
you. In smaller fonts, it had &ldquo;Pure Sugar&rdquo; printed on one side 
only, and showed no other information i.e. nutritional facts or net weight, and 
I wondered why.</p> 
<p>Each of these packages had something that got me really curious. Starting 
with the pink package is the ingredient saacharin or code E954. Several years 
ago I read that it was not safe to consume it because it causes bladder cancer. 
However, in 2001 the FDA repealed it. Then in December 14th, 2010, the EPA 
eventually was convinced and publically announced that it is not a potential 
hazard.</p> 
<p>Then, there is Splenda and its sucralose (E955). It is 600 times as sweet 
as sucrose, twice as sweet as saccharin, and 3.3 times as sweet as aspartame. 
FDA approved its usage in 2006, and is used in over 80 other countries since 
2008. Out of the three, Splenda is the only one says, 
&acirc;&#128;&#152;suitable for diabetes&rsquo;. And why is that? According to 
McNeil Nutritional LLC, it indicated that &acirc;&#128;&#152;...there was no 
evidence of carcinogenic activity for either sucralose or its hydrolysis 
products...&rsquo;. As a result, the American Dietetic Association highly 
advocated its usage and the FDA approved it. Containing no calories and does 
not promote dental cavities, it is found in over 4,500 food and beverage 
products today which triggers two questions, why does HTB have it own 
&ldquo;pure sugar&rdquo; package? And what type of sugar is it?</p> 
<p>Between sugar from cane and sugar from beets, cane sugar is a better choice 
which makes me wonder if HTB&rsquo;s &ldquo;pure sugar&rdquo; is from beet 
sugar. So, the question I had in mind was, why carry all three? Is all about 
helping diabetics and/or people on diet? Because in my opinion, HTB surely is 
not a place for people who is trying to be on diet nor is it for those trying 
to get off diabetes. And what about having to feel at ease that Sweet &ldquo;N 
Low&rsquo;s saacharin or Splenda&rsquo;s sucralose are safe to use? Not 
everyone is convinced that artificial sweeteners are good for the body. But if 
some day we don&rsquo;t find real pure sugar on our table, then at least, we 
know the artificial sweeteners have won the war.</p> <br>
