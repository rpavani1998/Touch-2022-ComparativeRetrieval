 The most common coffee and tea 
additives aredairy and sweeteners. For a sweeter cuppa, most people simply add 
whitesugar, but there are lots of ways to sweeten coffee and tea, such as honey,
agave nectar, molasses, simple syrup and artificial sweeteners. <br>
<br>
<b>
Notes on Sweetening Coffee/Tea</b> <br>
 Most sweeteners are easiest to add to 
hot drinks. If you&rsquo;re sweeteningiced coffee or iced tea, try sweetening 
it before you chill it, or sweeten with liquid sweeteners, such as honey, agave 
nectar and simple syrup. Here's an article with more information onhow to 
sweeten iced coffee/tea. <br>
<br>
 As with many things, less is more when it 
comes to sweetening coffee and tea&hellip; at least if you care about your 
health! If you find that a large dose of sweetener is as much a part of your 
morning beverage as the drink itself, try switching to a higher quality coffee 
or tea and reducing the amount of sugar you add. You may find that the flavor 
of the beverage stands on its own with little or no sweetener.<br>
<br>
<b>Sugar
</b> <br>
 Sugar is the most common sweetener for hot coffee and tea. <br>
<br>

 Different types of sugar have different flavor profiles. For example, brown 
sugar has a deeper, richer flavor than refined sugar. If you&rsquo;re 
interested in exploring more unusual sugar profiles, try Indianjaggery &ndash; 
it&rsquo;s great withmasala chai or coffee. <br>
<br>
 Some people prefer sugar 
that is shaped, such as rock crystal sugar, which may come in rectangular 
prisms or be attached to stirring sticks in a geode-like form. (Here's a video 
on how to make your ownrock candy sugar crystals.) <br>
<br>
<b>Honey</b> <br>
 
Honey is a popular sweetener for tea and iced coffee/tea. It&rsquo;s also used 
inCaf&eacute; con Miel (&ldquo;coffee with honey&rdquo;). <br>
<br>
 As with 
sugar, different types of honey have different flavor profiles. Clover honey is 
the most popular type, in part because of its relatively neutral flavor 
profile. Tupelo honey (pictured above) has a buttery, mellow, smooth flavor 
that is exceptional for tea. Many coffees can take on the bolder flavors of 
wildflower honey.<br>
<br>
 Some people select honey as a sweetener for its 
reputedhealth benefits. If you prefer honey for health reasons, be sure not to 
boil it as you prepare your coffee/tea, as this decreases its efficacy.<br>
<br>
 Some coffee shops offer different types or flavors of honey in small 
&ldquo;sticks&rdquo; (which are actually more like tubes).<br>
<br>
<b>Agave 
Nectar</b> <br>
 Agave nectar is an up-and-coming natural sweetener. It has a 
taste that is between honey and molasses. It&rsquo;s great with stronger teas 
and many coffees. Since it is a liquid sweetener, it&rsquo;s ideal for iced 
drinks.<br>
<br>
<b>Molasses</b> <br>
 Molasses has a bold, deep flavor that is 
suited to Brazilian, Kona and Colombian coffees. Like honey and agave nectar, 
it is a liquid sweetener, so it works well with iced or chilled beverages.<br>

<br> <b>Fruit</b> <br>
 Whether it&rsquo;s in juice, nectar or pureed form, 
fruit can be a flavorful and natural way to sweeten coffee and tea. This works 
especially well for coffee ortea smoothies, but doesn&rsquo;t have to be 
anything so elaborate &ndash; lemon (which is sweet and tart) is commonly added 
to tea.<br>
<br>
<b>Stevia</b> <br>
 Stevia is a newer sweetener on the market. 
TheSweetLeaf brand is made from an extract of the sweetleaf plant and is 
generally considered to be a natural product. It has a flavor that some find to 
be smooth, while some (notably supertasters) find the aftertaste to be bitter 
or licorice-like.<br>
<br>
Pepsi and Coca-Cola/Cargill have also launched their 
own stevia-based blends of stevia, which some say have a heavier, more cloying 
flavor.<br>
<br>
 Stevia is best with bold-tasting coffees and teas. <br>
<br>

<b>Simple/Flavored Syrups</b> <br>
 Simple syrups (a.k.a. &ldquo;sugar 
syrups&rdquo;) are simply solutions of sugar that has been boiled in water. 
Plain simple syrup has a neutral flavor that works well with most coffees and 
teas.<br>
<br>
 Simple syrups can be flavored easily with the addition of 
ingredients such as herbs or fruit during boiling. Here are recipes forbasic 
simple syrup and ginger/brown sugar simple syrup. Pair flavored syrups with 
coffees and teas based on the flavor profiles of each.<br>
<br>
<b>Corn Syrup
</b> <br>
 Corn syrup (and high-fructose corn syrup) is commonly used as 
sweeteners in &ldquo;ready to drink&rdquo; (bottled/canned) coffees and teas. 
There is some health controversy over the use of corn syrup as a sweetener and 
whether or not products containing corn syrup should be labeled as 
&ldquo;natural.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Artificial Sweeteners</b> <br>
 Artificial 
sweeteners, such asSplenda, Equal and Sweet-n-Low, are also used to sweeten 
coffee and tea. They tend to be more popular amongst calorie-counters and 
people with diabetes or other sugar sensitivities that they are amongst the 
general populous, in part because they often have an unpleasant aftertaste. 
They are best in strong-tasting coffees and teas. <br>
