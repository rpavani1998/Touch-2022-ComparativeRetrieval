<h1> Sugar-Free Blues: Everything You Wanted to Know About Artificial 
Sweeteners</h1> <br>

<p>When William Dufty published his classic book, <em>Sugar Blues</em>, he 
probably did not envisage the dilemma that so many people would face in later 
years with the profusion of sugar substitutes. It&rsquo;s a dilemma that many 
health-conscious people have witnessed, if not experienced themselves, and it 
frequently seems to &quot;pop up&quot; over pop (or soda, depending upon 
one&rsquo;s regional vernacular).</p> 
<p>The dilemma goes something like this: &quot;I would really like to cut out 
all the sugar and empty calories I get from soft drinks, but I&rsquo;ve heard 
that the aspartame in the diet drinks is bad for me too. What should I 
do?&quot; Certainly the best answer would be to give up soft drinks entirely in 
favor of a more health-promoting alternative, but this is much easier said than 
done for many long-time addicts of the sugar-water industry. Unfortunately, the 
dilemma doesn&rsquo;t end with our choice of beverages.</p> 
<p>A cursory glance down the aisles of any grocery store these days will 
reveal a host of sugar-free, low-calorie products, all promising to be the 
dieter&rsquo;s best friend. Readers of<em>Wise Traditions</em> may already know 
that the words &quot;sugar-free&quot; on a product label frequently translate 
into &quot;DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY--CONTAINS ASPARTAME,&quot; but what about all 
of the other sugar substitutes out there?</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2> 
<p>The substances which will be discussed here are often referred to on 
product labels by many (seemingly) interchangeable terms: artificial/synthetic 
sweeteners, sugar alternatives, alternative sweeteners, non-nutritive 
sweeteners, non-caloric/low-cal/low-carb sweeteners, diabetic-safe sweeteners, 
etc. Many of these terms seem to be used as synonyms.</p> 
<p>For some clarity on the issue, we shall quote from the American Dietetic 
Association (ADA): &quot;Although sweeteners can be grouped a number of 
different ways, the grouping &quot;nutritive&quot; and 
&quot;non-nutritive&quot; acknowledges a difference in the amount of energy 
provided by sweeteners. Nutritive sweeteners include sugar sweeteners (e.g., 
refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, crystalline fructose, glucose. . . 
concentrated fruit juice) and. . . sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol, 
xylitol, isomalt, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates). Non-nutritive 
sweeteners (e.g., saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame-K. . . sucralose [and 
neotame]) offer no energy, and, as they sweeten with little volume, can also be 
referred to as high-intensity sweeteners. Both sugar alcohols and non-nutritive 
sweeteners can replace sugar sweeteners and are therefore termed macronutrient 
substitutes, sugar substitutes, sugar replacers, or alternative sweeteners.</p> 
<p>&quot;Some sweeteners are considered Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) 
ingredients and others are considered food additives. . . . The safety limit of 
food additives. . . (is) expressed as the acceptable daily intake (ADI), that 
is, the estimated amount per kilogram body weight that a person can safely 
consume every day over a lifetime without risk.. . . &quot;1 While one might 
justifiably quibble with the ADA over its use of the term &quot;nutritive&quot; 
to describe many highly-refined sweeteners, that is how the Diet Dictocrats 
have structured the official terminology.</p> 
<h2>Aspartame</h2> 
<p>The FDA has approved 5 non-nutritive sweeteners: aspartame, saccharin, 
acesulfame K, sucralose and neotame.2,3 The most widely used non-nutritive 
sweetener is aspartame, scientifically known as 1-aspartyl 1-phenylalanine 
methyl ester.4 It was discovered by accident in 1965 by Mr. James Schlatter, a 
scientist who was working on new drugs to treat ulcers, when he licked his 
fingers to pick up a piece of paper and accidentally tasted the intense 
sweetness of the compound he had created.</p> 
<p>Aspartame is 180 times sweeter than sucrose (common table sugar).6 
According to the ADA: &quot;Demand for aspartame in the United States rose from 
8.4 million pounds in 1986 to 17.5 million pounds in 1992, a figure that 
represents more than 80 percent of the world demand. Although soft drinks 
account for more than 70 percent of aspartame consumption, this sweetener is 
added to more than 6,000 foods, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Aspartame is approved for use in more than 100 nations.7 It has been sold 
around the world under various brand names including NutraSweet, Equal, 
Spoonfuls, Canderel, Bienvia, NatraSweet and Miwon. Its widespread usage has 
left an extensive trail of complaints and documentation of its negative side 
effects. Consequently, there is a great deal to be said on the subject of 
aspartame.</p> 
<p>In 1974 the Food and Drug Administration gave its first halting approval to 
aspartame, then a product of pharmaceutical giant G.D. Searle &amp; Company. 
Searle owned the original patent on aspartame and did the original laboratory 
studies on its safety. These studies turned out very badly and remain as some 
of the most damning evidence against aspartame&rsquo;s safety.8 Two of 
Searle&rsquo;s own scientists, concerned about the safety of the new product, 
filed a formal objection to try to keep aspartame from coming to the market.9 A 
team from the FDA conducted its own study of Searle&rsquo;s data and on the 
corpses of aspartame-poisoned mice, and issued a scathing document called the 
Bressler Report.10 This report, however, did not spell the end for aspartame.
</p> 
<p>Following the issuance of the Bressler Report came a period of thickening 
political intrigue and red tape, wherein two key figures at the FDA failed to 
press forward with further investigations, only to leave the FDA for jobs with 
Searle&rsquo;s law firm, Sidley &amp; Austin. Higher authorities in the FDA 
quietly consigned the Bressler Report to the archives, and only made it public 
later, through a Freedom of Information Act Request.11 While the public 
remained ignorant, Searle &amp; Co had maneuvered to bring in Donald Rumsfeld, 
previously the Chief of Staff in the Ford Administration and the then Secretary 
of Defense, as their new CEO. According to a former Searle employee, Rumsfeld 
told them that &quot;no matter what, he would see to it that aspartame would be 
approved. . . &quot;12</p> 
<p>Searle re-applied for FDA approval of aspartame on the very same day that 
Ronald Reagan took office in 1980. There were plenty of favors to be called in 
from within the new Administration, and significant clout was also to be 
wielded by Robert Shapiro and Utah Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch has been 
an outspoken advocate for the sweetener, possibly due to his holdings in Twin 
Lab, a health supplement company that has used aspartame in a number of their 
products.13</p> 
<p>Between 1981 and 1985, Rumsfeld and Searle began seeing the payoff for 
their newly-formed subsidiary, the NutraSweet Company. Amidst ongoing 
controversy, aspartame was slowly but surely given full FDA approval. Dr. 
Michael Friedman, then the acting head of the FDA, later accepted a high-level 
position at Monsanto, the corporation which was to purchase the NutraSweet 
Company from Searle in 1985.14 Monsanto has also brought the world such 
atrocities as Agent Orange, PCBs, dioxins, Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone 
(rBGH), Round-Up herbicide and a host of genetically modified foods.15</p> 
<p>The company has made a fortune off aspartame, at the expense of those who 
purchase and consume it, and at the hazard of those who actually do the work of 
producing and handling it. The Material Safety Data Sheet on aspartame (CAS# 
22839-47-0) says that to work with the sweetener, one should wear chemical 
goggles, protective gloves to prevent skin exposure, a chemical apron and a 
NIOS/MSHA approved air purifying dust or mist respirator.16 Whatever else one 
may say about refined white sugar, at least one doesn&rsquo;t have to wear 
chemical goggles to work with it!</p> 
<p>Problems associated with aspartame consumption are neatly summarized in 
Nourishing Traditions. &quot;Aspartame. . . is a neurotoxic substance that has 
been associated with numerous health problems including dizziness, visual 
impairment, severe muscle aches, numbing of extremities, pancreatitis, high 
blood pressure, retinal hemorrhaging, seizures and depression. It is suspected 
of causing birth defects and chemical disruptions in the brain.</p> 
<p>&quot;Researchers at Utah State University found that even at low levels 
aspartame induces adverse changes in the pituitary glands of mice. The 
pituitary gland is the master gland upon which the proper function of all 
biochemical processes depend.</p> 
<p>&quot; When aspartame is digested it breaks down into the amino acids 
phenylalanine and aspartic acid, plus methanol. Methanol, or wood alcohol, is a 
known poison. Methanol is also found in fruit juices, and our regulatory 
agencies have seized upon this fact to assure us that the methanol by-product 
of aspartame is not harmful. They fail to point out that the methanol content 
of a diet soft drink is 15 to 100 times higher than that of fruit juices.&quot;
17</p> 
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines the &quot;safe 
consumption level&quot; of methanol at 7.8 milligrams per day. One liter of a 
beverage sweetened with aspartame may contain as much as 56 milligrams of 
methanol.18 Other sources also link aspartame consumption with 
Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and the Gulf War Syndrome 
experienced by U.S. soldiers after serving in Iraq during Operation: Desert 
Storm.19</p> 
<p>According to Dr. Christine Lydon, an accomplished aspartame researcher: 
&quot;Aspartame&rsquo;s breakdown products, or metabolites, are even scarier 
than its components. Phenylalanine decomposes into diketopiperazine (DKP) a 
known carcinogen, when exposed to warm temperatures or prolonged storage. Even 
if products are consistently kept at cooler temperatures we are not safe. At 
cold temperatures, methanol will spontaneously give rise to a colorless toxin 
known as formaldehyde. Independent studies have shown formaldehyde formation, 
resulting from aspartame ingestion, to be extremely common. It accumulates 
within the cells, and reacts with cellular proteins such as enzymes and DNA. 
This cumulative reaction could spell grave consequences for those who consume 
aspartame-laden diet drinks and foods on a daily basis.&quot;20</p> 
<p>Supporters of aspartame claim that the levels of methanol are not high 
enough to be worrisome and that phenylalanine and aspartic acid are of only 
limited concern. But there is no argument about the fact that phenylalanine, 
the largest component of aspartame by weight, is a danger to people who have a 
hereditary condition called phenylketonuria (PKU). These people must monitor or 
eliminate their intake of phenylalanine, which also occurs naturally in certain 
foods. The FDA recommends that pregnant and lactating women, people with 
advanced liver disease and phenylketonurics avoid products containing aspartame 
due to concern over metabolizing phenylalanine. The FDA also admits that 
aspartic acid has the potential to cause brain damage at very high doses, but 
they assure us that &quot;under normal intake levels, the brain&rsquo;s 
mechanism for controlling aspartic acid levels ensures no adverse effects.&quot;
21</p> 
<p>This dismissal of phenylalanine and aspartic acid as significant health 
hazards is a dangerous bit of sleight of hand. According to Dr. Lydon, 
&quot;Phenylalanine and aspartic acid are amino acids that are normally 
supplied by the foods we eat; however, they can only be considered natural and 
harmless when consumed in combination with other amino acids. On their own, 
they enter the central nervous system in abnormally high concentrations, 
causing aberrant neuronal firing and potential cell death. The neurotoxic 
effects of these amino acids, when consumed as isolates, can be linked to 
headaches, mental confusion, balance problems and possibly seizures.&quot;22</p>
<p>While aspartame has been the subject of hundreds of FDA-approved studies, 
they clearly have not laid to rest the controversy surrounding its safety. Any 
adverse reaction to a food item that is regulated under the FDA&rsquo;s 
authority is supposed to be reported back to their Adverse Reaction Monitoring 
System (ARMS). As of 1995, over 75 percent of the adverse reactions reported to 
the ARMS were due to aspartame.23 A 1995 report from the US Department of 
Health and Human Services entitled &quot;Symptoms Attributed to Aspartame in 
Complaints Submitted to the FDA&quot; (which once again had to be forced into 
public light through the Freedom of Information Act) lists 92 separate 
categories of symptoms, including the frequency of each reported claim.24</p> 
<h2>Saccharin</h2> 
<p>Saccharin, the first artificial sweetener to be discovered, is chemically 
classified as an O-toluene sulfonamide derivative.25 It was originally 
synthesized from toluene, a colorless liquid hydrocarbon distilled from coal 
tar, which may account for saccharin&rsquo;s bitter, metallic aftertaste. 
Toluene is also used in the manufacture of certain dyes, pharmaceutical drugs 
and trinitrotoluene, the blasting agent more commonly known as TNT.26 Saccharin 
is currently manufactured by a more cost-effective method, beginning with 
synthetically produced methyl anthranilate, a compound that also occurs 
naturally in grape and other fruit juices. Saccharin may be found in ingredient 
lists under three slightly variant forms--acid saccharin, sodium saccharin and 
calcium saccharin.27</p> 
<p>Unlike aspartame, saccharin is not metabolized by the human body and is 
excreted rapidly through the urine.28 This is the holy grail of the artificial 
sweetener industry--compounds that taste sweet, are stable in prepackaged foods 
and beverages, and which are so foreign to the human diet that our digestive 
system cannot metabolize them to create any dietary calories. (Of course it is 
also helpful for the compounds to be dirt cheap to produce in bulk.)</p> 
<p>Saccharin was discovered in 1879 by Constantine Fahlberg, a chemistry 
research assistant working in the laboratory of Professor Ira Remsen at Johns 
Hopkins University.29 According to Fahlberg&rsquo;s account, he accidentally 
spilled some laboratory material on his hand and noticed the sweet taste later 
in the evening when he was eating dinner. (Don&rsquo;t these scientists wash 
their hands after a hard day at the lab?) Fahlberg and Remsen published their 
findings jointly, naming the compound saccharin after the Latin saccharum, 
which means sugar.30 What poetic justice for the name of the first artificial 
sweetener. All one has to do is add an &quot;e&quot; to the end of the word to 
change it to &quot;saccharine,&quot; an adjective which means &quot;sickeningly 
sweet.&quot;</p> 
<p>Despite the fact that it is 300 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar),31 
saccharin was not initially used as a sweetener. From its discovery in 1879 
until 1917, saccharin was primarily employed as an antiseptic agent and food 
preservative.32 Fahlberg, an experienced sugar chemist, did recognize the 
potential of the new compound for sweetening purposes, and he aggressively 
attempted to profit on these capabilities as early as 1885. He obtained a US 
patent on the new substance without crediting Professor Remsen&rsquo;s role in 
its discovery or even seeking Remsen&rsquo;s consent, and then proceeded to 
open a small plant in New York to manufacture saccharin in bulk. Fahlberg later 
applied for and received German patents on saccharin and moved his operation to 
Westerhusen, Germany. By 1902, his new product was causing nervousness in the 
German sugar industry. Largely at the insistence of these sugar producers, the 
German government enacted new laws which made saccharin available only to 
pharmacies for use in prescription medicines.33</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, a St. Louis company by the name of Meyer Brothers Drug Company 
had been importing saccharin from Germany, and an enterprising young employee 
by the name of John F. Queeny immediately recognized the sweetener&rsquo;s 
great potential. In 1901, Queeny cashed in his personal savings and took out a 
loan to found a new corporation for the sole purpose of producing its own 
saccharin for the US market. That corporation was Monsanto. In 1903, the 
Monsanto corporation began to ship saccharin to a little-known company in 
Georgia called Coca-Cola. The rest, as they say, is history.34,35</p> 
<p>Saccharin&rsquo;s early history in the US was somewhat rocky. Critics 
derided the substance as having no nutritional value and (ironically enough) no 
calories, and some people doubted that the new sweetener was safe. Theodore 
Roosevelt, president at the time, eloquently defended saccharin&rsquo;s safety 
by saying, &quot;Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an 
idiot.&quot;36 Despite these stirring words of reassurance, some stubborn 
people remained unconvinced.</p> 
<p>In 1912, saccharin was briefly banned in the US due to concerns about its 
safety. This ban was lifted 5 years later with the advent of the First World 
War.37 As so frequently happens when a nation has to buckle down for a 
protracted war, resources in the US had to be rationed in order to provide for 
the troops abroad. One of those resources was table sugar. As more and more US 
sugar was being sent across the ocean to the soldiers in Europe, the sweetening 
needs of the populace at home were met with cheap and plentiful saccharin.</p> 
<p>By the time the war ended, America and its European allies had grown quite 
fond of the new sweetener. Usage of saccharin leveled off when sugar became 
available once again, but it had entered the scene to stay. World War II again 
brought sugar rationing and a dramatic increase in saccharin usage, which this 
time did not decline with the war&rsquo;s end.38 However, during that period, 
saccharin took on second-place status as cyclamate, another artificial 
sweetener discovered in 1937, came on the scene.39</p> 
<p>In 1958, Marvin Eisenstadt, owner of Cumberland Packing Company in 
Brooklyn, NY, introduced Sweet&lsquo;n Low, which mixed saccharine with 
cyclamate (to counter the metallic aftertaste of saccharin) in the small packet 
form that we still know today. The present formula has abandoned the cyclamate, 
but the main ingredient is still saccharin.40</p> 
<p>During this entire period of saccharin&rsquo;s history, the FDA allowed the 
makers of saccharin (and cyclamate) to determine for themselves whether it was 
a safe product for human consumption.41 Indeed, the FDA showed very little 
interest in saccharin until 1969, when researchers discovered that cyclamate 
was carcinogenic in laboratory mice. Cyclamate was banned by the FDA that same 
year.42 The FDA proposed also banning saccharin until conclusive tests could 
prove its safety. This suggestion was met with significant opposition from a 
public which had become greatly enamored with the concept of artificial 
sweeteners and had just lost their only other option at the time, cyclamate.</p>
<p>In 1977, Canadian scientists found that high doses of saccharin seemed to 
cause cancer in laboratory rats. The Canadian government responded by 
immediately banning all use of saccharin in food and beverages.43 To forestall 
a possible FDA ban on the popular sweetener, Congress passed the Saccharin 
Study and Labeling Act. This Act placed a two-year moratorium on any ban of 
saccharin, allowing for further testing to be done, and also mandated that all 
products containing saccharin carry the following cautionary label: &quot;Use 
of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains 
saccharin which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals.&quot;
44</p> 
<p>During the ensuring 26 years, the FDA and other groups performed numerous 
studies attempting to determine conclusively whether or not saccharin was a 
carcinogen. Meanwhile, the public at large continued to gobble up 
saccharin-containing products, and every time the moratorium on banning 
saccharin expired, Congress extended it until more research could be done. The 
moratorium was extended seven times, until 1991 when the FDA decided it was no 
longer suspicious of saccharin as a serious threat.45 Technically, ever since 
that time the FDA has given saccharin something of a probationary status, 
allowing it equal footing with the other three non-nutritive sweeteners but 
still classifying it as an &quot;anticipated human carcinogen,&quot;46 whatever 
that means.</p> 
<p>There is also another, lesser-studied concern with saccharin due to the 
fact that it is a sulfonamide. (Remember, chemically speaking saccharin is 
called an O-toluene sulfonamide derivative.) Sulfonamide compounds have been 
shown to cause dermatological reactions in those who are allergic to sulfa 
drugs, especially in children. Consumption of saccharin by these sensitive 
individuals may result in pruritus (itching), urticaria (blotchy skin 
discolorations), eczema, photosensitivity, prurigo (a condition characterized 
by small, intensely itchy skin bumps), wheezing, nausea, diarrhea, tongue 
blisters, tachycardia, fixed eruptions, headache, diuresis (increased 
urination) or sensory neuropathy.47 Also, regardless of sulfa allergies, 
consumption of saccharin-sweetened infant formula has been associated with 
irritability, hypertonia (abnormal increase in muscle tension with reduced 
muscle elasticity), insomnia, opisthotonos (an abnormal posturing condition 
characterized by rigidity and severe arching of the back) and strabismus (a 
condition in which the eyes uncontrollably deviate from the intended object of 
focus). These conditions generally resolve themselves within 36 hours after 
ingestion of the formula.48 (This last bit is most likely an unnecessary 
warning for readers of Wise Traditions. There is nary a commercial infant 
formula out there which is truly healthful, whether or not it contains 
saccharin.)</p> 
<p>So where does this leave the matter? Saccharin is the most thoroughly 
tested of all the non-nutritive sweeteners--more than 2374 studies have been 
done, with aspartame coming in second at 598.49 Even the most staunch critics 
are left to admit that no one has been able to draw a definite link between 
saccharin consumption (even at high levels) and cancer in humans. It has been 
shown that saccharin causes bladder cancer in male rats of a certain genetic 
predisposition, but this appears to be a gender- and species-specific 
phenomenon. To quote from Dr. Janet Starr Hull: &quot;Saccharin is not 
genotoxic; the presumed mechanism of toxicity is the binding of saccharin to 
urinary proteins (not normally found in humans), creating a nidus for the 
formation of silicate crystals, which are cytotoxic to bladder epithelium (of 
rats).&quot;50 However--and this is the important part--while the FDA has 
chosen to say that it cannot be proven that saccharin&rsquo;s effect on mice is 
relevant to humans, one could just as easily say that the studies have failed 
to prove that there is no link between saccharin and bladder cancer in humans.
</p> 
<h2>Acesulfame-K</h2> 
<p>The third of our non-nutritive sweeteners is acesulfame-K, also referred to 
as acesulfame potassium (K is the chemical symbol for potassium), potassium 
acesulfame, ace-K or ACK. Any of these names are greatly preferable to the 
chemical name of the 
product--5,6-dimethyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide. We&rsquo;ll 
stick with acesulfame K for our purposes!</p> 
<p>Compared to aspartame and saccharin, there is very little information 
available about acesulfame-K. It is 200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar)
51 and, as it is not metabolized by the body, it is excreted unchanged in the 
urine.52 It was discovered in 1967 by a German chemist, Karl Clauss, who was 
working with derivatives of acetoacetic acid.53 In what should now be a 
familiar theme, the sweetness of one particular derivative revealed itself one 
day when he licked his finger to pick up a piece of paper.54</p> 
<p>At the time, Mr. Clauss was employed at a German chemical company by the 
name of the Hoechst Group. Immediately grasping the potential for a new 
artificial sweetener, Hoechst conducted its own safety testing on the compound 
throughout the 1970s. As soon as they were satisfied with the results of their 
testing, Hoechst began to market their new product around the world. Currently, 
more than 100 countries allow the use of acesulfame-K.55,56 </p> 
<p>The entry of the new sweetener into the U.S. began in 1988 when, based 
largely upon acceptance of Hoechst&rsquo;s own research, the FDA gave a partial 
green light for its use as a tabletop sweetener and as an ingredient in baked 
goods, frozen desserts, alcoholic beverages and candies.57 In September of 
1997, Hoechst established a subsidiary corporation called Nutrinova Nutrition 
Specialties &amp; Food Ingredients, in part to handle the growing business of 
acesulfame K, marketed under the brand name Sunett.58 It has also been sold 
under the names Sweet One, Swiss Sweet and Sweet &amp; Safe.</p> 
<p>While the general popularity of acesulfame-K was on the rise, a few voices 
began to raise questions. After reviewing the data provided by Hoechst&rsquo;s 
product safety tests, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) 
concluded that the company had not done an adequate job with the testing and 
had ignored problematic data.</p> 
<p>To quote from the CSPI website: &quot;The safety tests of acesulfame-K 
were. . . of mediocre quality. Key rat tests were afflicted by disease in the 
animal colonies; a mouse study was several months too brief and did not expose 
animals during gestation. Two rat studies suggest that the additive might cause 
cancer. . . In addition, large doses of acetoacetamide, a breakdown product, 
have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits and dogs.&quot;59 CSPI 
has also gone on record as saying that the Hoechst scientists &quot;followed 
inadequate protocols, which are greatly at variance with current standards for 
test design, execution and reporting required for the National Toxicology 
Program&rsquo;s bioassays.&quot;60 It has also been noted that acesulfame-K 
stimulates insulin secretion in a dose dependent fashion, thereby possibly 
aggravating reactive hypoglycemia (&quot;low blood sugar attacks&quot;).61</p> 
<p>Based on these objections, in 1996 CSPI urged the FDA to reconsider its 
position on the new sweetener, but two years later the FDA approved 
acesulfame-K for all other general sweetening purposes, including non-alcoholic 
liquid use. As soon as it was approved, Pepsi announced that it would be used 
in a new drink, Pepsi One.62</p> 
<p>Since 1995, there has also been another product available, marketed by the 
Holland Sweetener Company as Twinsweet. While acesulfame-K is frequently 
blended with aspartame to achieve synergistic sweetening capabilities, 
Twinsweet is actually a blend of the two at the molecular level. This is 
possible due to the fact that some high-intensity sweeteners form positively 
charged ions in certain solutions, whereas others form negatively charged ions. 
Aspartame and acesulfame-K are the first two sweeteners which have been 
successfully bonded in this way to form what is known as a 
&quot;sweetener-sweetener salt.&quot; This solves certain difficulties that the 
food industry encounters when trying to mechanically blend sweeteners. 
Twinsweet dissolves in water into separated molecules of the two individual 
components, so all the safety concerns of aspartame and acesulfame-K should be 
applied as well to Twinsweet.63</p> 
<p>In spite of the FDA go-ahead, CSPI and a handful of independent scientists 
maintain their objections to acesulfame-K, citing inadequate testing and the 
fact that previous tests suggest serious problems, including possible 
carcinogenicity. While there may not be any organized groups at this time 
compiling lists of adverse reactions or calling public attention to the 
possibilities of danger, this does not necessarily indicate that this compound 
presents no danger. Since no specific monitoring practices or epidemiological 
studies of acesulfame-K are currently in progress, it is possible that relevant 
data may not be gathered for some time. The FDA has no apparent interest in 
pressing the issue. As with saccharin, the prudent consumer would be wise to 
seek out better options.</p> 
<h2>Sucralose</h2> 
<p>The fourth FDA-approved non-nutritive sweetener is sucralose, chemically 
known as 
1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-BETA-D-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranoside.
64 Sucralose may have the strangest &quot;accidental discovery&quot; story of 
all. In 1976, a British sugar company by the name of Tate &amp; Lyle was 
conducting experiments in collaboration with Queen Elizabeth College at the 
University of London, searching for ways to use sucrose as a chemical 
intermediate. Shashikant Phadnis, a foreign graduate student working on the 
project, misunderstood a request for &quot;testing&quot; of a chlorinated sugar 
as a request for &quot;tasting,&quot; leading to the discovery that many 
chlorinated sugars are hundreds or thousands of times sweeter than sucrose.65
</p> 
<p>Following this discovery, Tate &amp; Lyle arranged with Johnson &amp; 
Johnson, then the world&rsquo;s largest health care company, to develop and 
test a new sweetener from chlorinated sugars. In 1980, Johnson &amp; Johnson 
formed a subsidiary company by the name of McNeil Specialty Products for this 
purpose.66 The product they created, at an impressive 600 times sweeter than 
sucrose, would be known as sucralose and marketed as Splenda.</p> 
<p>Canada became the first nation to approve sucralose in 1991,67 soon to be 
followed by many more. Currently, more than 40 nations have given their 
approval to sucralose, although a number of European nations still have it 
under preliminary review.68,69,70 The new product made a grand entrance into 
the US market with FDA approval in 1998. Even though this was not full FDA 
approval, to quote Splenda&rsquo;s own website, the product was &quot;approved 
for use in 15 food and beverage categories, the broadest initial approval ever 
given to a no-calorie sweetener.&quot; It was only 16 months later in 1999 when 
the FDA finished the job and gave full approval for all sweetening purposes.71
</p> 
<p>According to the Splenda website, &quot;sucralose, is made from sugar 
through a patented, multi-step process that selectively replaces three 
hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms. The 
result is an exceptionally stable sweetener that tastes like sugar, but without 
sugar&rsquo;s calories. After consumption, sucralose passes through the body 
without being broken down.&quot;72 Sucralose is also said to be diabetic-safe, 
as it does not increase blood sugar levels. However, some researchers dispute 
these claims.</p> 
<p>While the Johnson &amp; Johnson Corporation claims that they have hundreds 
of self-conducted studies demonstrating the product&rsquo;s safety, sucralose 
has the fewest independent scientific tests to its credit of all non-nutritive 
sweeteners. Additionally, independent reviewers of Johnson &amp; 
Johnson&rsquo;s tests have found them to be inadequate and methodologically 
flawed. Flaws notwithstanding, several pre-approval tests still indicated 
potential toxicity, although this was written off by the company as 
insignificant. Similar to the situation with aspartame after it first entered 
the market, there are currently no independent, long-term studies on the 
effects of sucralose consumption.73</p> 
<p>Of the few human studies which have been conducted, one focusing on 
diabetics using sucralose showed &quot;a statistically significant increase in 
glycosylated hemoglobin (Hba1C), which is a marker of long-term blood glucose 
levels and is used to assess glycemic control in diabetic patients.&quot; The 
FDA itself has stated that &quot;increases in glycosolation in hemoglobin imply 
lessening of control in diabetes.&quot;74</p> 
<p>It is not only diabetics who need worry about the safety of sucralose. 
Research conducted with rats, mice and rabbits has shown that sucralose 
consumption can cause shrinking of the thymus gland (up to 40 percent 
shrinkage), enlargement of the liver and kidneys, atrophy of lymph follicles in 
the spleen and thymus, increased cecal weight, reduced bodily growth rate, 
decreased red blood cell count, hyperplasia of the pelvis, extension of 
gestational periods in pregnancy, decreased fetal body weights and placental 
weights, and diarrhea. According to the FDA&rsquo;s &quot;Final Rule&quot; 
report on sucralose, it was considered to be &quot;weakly mutagenic in a mouse 
lymphoma mutation assay.&quot;75</p> 
<p>The reason for this host of side effects is not fully understood. Many 
detractors have raised concerns due to the fact that sucralose is a chlorinated 
molecule. Chlorinated molecules, which are used as the basis for pesticides 
such as DDT, tend to accumulate in body tissues. Johnson &amp; Johnson 
maintains that sucralose passes through the digestive system without any 
absorption or metabolization, but the FDA&rsquo;s own research has shown that 
11 to 27 percent of sucralose is absorbed in humans, while the rest is excreted 
unchanged in the feces. Tests performed by the Japanese Food Sanitation Council 
have found that as much as 40 percent of ingested sucralose is absorbed. To 
further dispute the manufacturer&rsquo;s claims, research indicates that about 
20 to 30 percent of the absorbed sucralose is metabolized. Both the metabolites 
and unchanged absorbed sucralose are excreted in urine, but some absorbed 
sucralose has been found to concentrate in the liver, kidney and 
gastrointestinal tract.76</p> 
<p>Not only does sucralose break down within the digestive system, but, as the 
FDA notes, &quot;[it] may hydrolyze in some food products&hellip;[and] the 
resulting hydrolysis products may also be ingested by the consumer.&quot; 
Prolonged storage, particularly at high temperatures and low pH, causes 
sucralose to break down into other chemicals, including 
4-chloro-4-deoxy-galactose, 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-fructose and 
1,6-dichlorofructose, none of which has ever specifically been tested in terms 
of safety for human ingestion. Additionally, as the FDA again acknowledges, 
sucralose may contain up to 2 percent of various impurities, such as heavy 
metals, arsenic, triphenilphosphine oxide, methanol, chlorinated disaccharides 
and chlorinated monosaccharides. Even if these &quot;impurities&quot; are 
within existing manufacturing guidelines, they are still all potentially 
dangerous to human health.77</p> 
<p>Sucralose production and consumption may also pose a threat to the 
environment in general. To quote from Dr. Joseph Mercola&rsquo;s website (
www.mercola.com/2000/dec/3/sucralose_dangers.htm): &quot;Although sucralose is 
being flushed down toilets [after human excretion]. . . , what happens to it 
next is simply a matter for speculation. I know of no studies showing what 
happens to the chemical when the raw sewage is treated and then released back 
into the environment. Does it remain stabile or react with other substances to 
form new compounds? Is the sucralose or any resulting chemicals safe for the 
environment? How will this chemical affect aquatic life such as fish, as well 
as other animals? Will sucralose begin to appear in our water supplies, just as 
some drugs [such as antibiotics] are beginning to be found? . . . [Ultimately] 
the ecological impact of this new chemical being introduced into the 
environment is unknown.&quot;</p> 
<p>This additional consideration of environmental impact should also be 
applied to the other non-nutritive sweeteners, as well as all synthetic foods 
and additives. The burden of proving that such synthetic compounds are safe, 
from the process of their creation through the human digestive system and into 
our environment, should fall upon the purveyors of these chemicals.</p> 
<p>While no formal lists currently exist to catalogue adverse reactions to 
sucralose consumption, Dr. Mercola provides several anecdotal incidents on his 
website. Clearly, sucralose consumption poses potential hazards which have not 
been sufficiently acknowledged or studied. This author recommends against 
willingly acting as a guinea pig for yet another questionable product--read on 
for better options later in this article.</p> 
<h2>Neotame</h2> 
<p>Neotame, another product of Monsanto&rsquo;s Nutrasweet Company and also 
the most recently approved sweetener, deserves several red flags of caution. 
Also known as &quot;superaspartame,&quot; it was first synthesized from a base 
of aspartame and 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde by French scientists Claude Nofre 
and Jean-Marie Tinti. In an amazing display of sweetening power, neotame hits 
the scales at 8000 times sweeter than sucrose, and its chemical name is a 
mouthful--N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L-a-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.
</p> 
<p>Amazingly, neotame doesn&rsquo;t even come close to being the sweetest 
compound that Nofre and Tinti synthesized. Of their numerous other discoveries, 
carrelame, bernadame, sucrononate and lugduname are the sweetest substances 
known to man, ranging from 150,000 to over 220,000 times sweeter than sucrose! 
There are currently no plans to seek approval of these substances for human 
consumption, but they may at some point be utilized in other ways and thereby 
find their way into the food chain.78 </p> 
<p>The chemical formula of neotame, published in the February 10, 1998 Federal 
Register, reveals that neotame is extremely similar to aspartame. Essentially, 
neotame molecules are aspartame molecules chemically combined with a neohexyl 
group. While neotame has not yet been introduced into any markets, critics 
surmise that all of the toxic effects of aspartame and more will plague 
consumers of neotame. NutraSweet petitioned the FDA in 1997 and received final 
approval for a wide variety of sweetening purposes in 2002.</p> 
<p>In May of 2000, the NutraSweet Company was purchased from Monsanto by the 
J.W. Childs Equity Partners, LP.79 The new leadership at NutraSweet must be 
quite excited about the approval of neotame, as the patent rights on aspartame 
expired in the 1990s and generic versions have been allowed ever since. It is 
estimated that neotame could replace up to 50 percent of the current market 
share for aspartame. We will all see soon enough how neotame is received by the 
public.80,81,82</p> 
<p>As a concluding remark on all five of the FDA-approved non-nutritive 
sweeteners, it should be noted that many animal studies on these products only 
yield negative results when test animals are fed the equivalent of several 
hundred artificially sweetened products daily. Apologists for non-nutritive 
sweeteners point to this as a way of dismissing negative test data.</p> 
<p>A quotation from the Holistic Healing website explains the fallacy of this 
assertion. &quot;In order to estimate a potential safe dose [of a chemical] in 
humans, one must divide the lowest dose given to rodents that was seen to have 
any negative effects. . . by 100. That dose is then known as the maximum 
Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for lifetime use. Keep in mind that the TDI is 
just an estimate. Some chemicals are much more than 10 times more toxic in 
humans than in rodents (or will cause cancer in humans in low-dose, long-term 
exposure and do not cause cancer in rodents at all). A person ingesting the TDI 
for some chemical may find that it causes cancer, or immune system or 
neurological problems, after many years or decades of use. So, if the 
manufacturer claims that the dose was equivalent to 50 diet sodas, then the TDI 
would be one-half (1/2) of a diet soda, and even that dose may or may not be 
safe.&quot;83</p> 
<h2>Cyclamate</h2> 
<p>Aside from the five current non-nutritive sweeteners, there are two 
additional non-nutritive sweeteners under review by the FDA--cyclamate and 
alitame. Since it is entirely likely that both of them will all be approved at 
some point in the future, they must be considered as well.</p> 
<p>Cyclamate was discovered in 1937 by Michael Sveda, a graduate student at 
the University of Illinois, working on the synthesis of anti-pyretic 
(anti-fever) drugs. The familiar theme continues: Sveda noticed the sweet taste 
of a compound he was working with after he accidentally sat his cigarette down 
in some of it and then took a puff.84 As word got out about the discovery of 
what was then only the second existing artificial sweetener, DuPont quickly 
bought the patent, and then later sold it to Abbott Laboratories. Abbott 
reportedly wished to use the new product to mask the bitter taste of certain 
antibiotics and medications.85</p> 
<p>In the early 1950s, Abbott began to market cyclamate tablets as 
diabetic-friendly sweeteners. As noted above in the history of saccharin, 
cyclamate was also a part of the original &quot;formula&quot; of Sweet&rsquo;n 
Low, introduced to the public in 1958. Cyclamate enjoyed a great deal of 
controversy-free popularity from this time until the late 1960s, when 
laboratory tests began to suggest that it caused genetic damage, testicular 
atrophy and cancer in rats. In 1970, the FDA imposed a total ban on the use of 
cyclamate within the U.S. However, it is still used in 50 countries around the 
world--the major producers and exporters are located in China, Indonesia, 
Taiwan and Spain86--so it almost certainly still finds its way into the US via 
products from these countries. Where it is still used, cyclamate is frequently 
blended with aspartame and acesulfame-K to make a &quot;super sweetener.&quot;87
</p> 
<p>After the US cyclamate ban, would-be producers were legally obligated to 
prove its safety to the FDA&rsquo;s satisfaction if it was to be re-approved. 
Abbott has been hard at work ever since 1970, petitioning the FDA for 
re-approval in 1973, 1976 and 1982, and also requesting special hearings on the 
matter in 1977 and &rsquo;78. No substantial ground was gained until 1985, when 
the Cancer Assessment Committee of FDA&rsquo;s Center for Food Safety and 
Applied Nutrition concluded that cyclamate is not a carcinogen. It has still 
not been satisfactorily resolved whether or not cyclamate is a co-carcinogen 
with other substances or promotes tumor growth, and thus it is still pending 
re-approval.88</p> 
<h2>Alitame</h2> 
<p>Of alitame, there is very little to report. Developed by pharmaceutical 
giant Pfizer, alitame is sold under the name Aclame in several countries, 
including Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, China, Indonesia, Colombia and Chile.
89 Similar to aspartame, alitame is composed of amino acids, including 
L-aspartic acid, D-alanine and 2,2,4,4-tetramethylthietanyl amine.90 It is a 
heat-stable compound, 2000 times sweeter than sucrose, which could potentially 
be incorporated into any sweetened product. Pfizer applied for FDA approval of 
alitame in 1986, but has yet to receive a conclusive ruling.91 Any sweetener 
that may be described as &quot;similar to aspartame&quot; deserves a red flag 
of caution, but no commentary of any detail is readily available at the present 
time. One source claims that alitame will soon be approved as a sweetener in 
the US, marketed under the name Novasweet. Anticipating this, the Wrigley 
Company has already filed several patents to use the new sweetener in its 
chewing gums.92</p> 
<h2>&quot;Nutritive&quot; Sweeteners</h2> 
<p>Having now dealt with all of the currently-approved and pending 
non-nutritive sweeteners, we must return our attention briefly to the so-called 
&quot;nutritive&quot; sweeteners. To deal with this category, we must first rid 
ourselves of the silly idea that the word &quot;nutritive&quot; necessarily 
indicates that a substance will contribute anything positive to our general 
well being. The FDA and ADA consider nutritive sweeteners to include anything 
from raw honey, pure maple syrup, molasses, sorghum or other nutritious 
options, to such dietary dead-ends as white sugar, high fructose corn syrup and 
concentrated fruit juices.</p> 
<p>The so-called nutritive sweeteners include a class of substances known 
variously as sugar alcohols, polyols, polyalcohols or polyhydric acids. These 
are the substances which are usually, but not always, identifiable by the 
suffix &quot;-itol&quot;--sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, erythritol, lactitol, 
maltitol, isomalt and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates (HSH). Scientists call 
them sugar alcohols because part of their structure chemically resembles sugar 
and part is similar to alcohol, but they don&rsquo;t completely fit into either 
category.93 Each of these substances has its own particular history, but 
mercifully--for the purpose of brevity--they all share a great deal of 
similarity.</p> 
<p>Although several sugar alcohols are touted as naturally occurring in 
various foods--which is technically true--all commercially-available sugar 
alcohols are synthesized by the hydrogenation of sugars from various sources.94 
While the author could not find any information commenting on this fact, the 
use of a hydrogenation process may or may not be of concern. Hydrogenation of 
fats and oils is certainly detrimental to the nutritive qualities of said 
items, but the process must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. One must keep 
in mind, however, that fats and oils were hydrogenated for some time before we 
became aware of the detrimental effects of this practice. If anyone has 
bothered to specifically research the effects of hydrogenating sugars, that 
information is not readily available at this time.</p> 
<p>According to the American Dietetics Association: &quot;[Sugar alcohols] can 
. . . be categorized as sugar replacers because they can replace sugar 
sweeteners, usually on a one-to-one basis; offer less energy; and offer 
potential health benefits, such as reduced glycemic response and reduced dental 
caries risk.&quot;98</p> 
<p>It should be noted that lactitol, mannitol and some of the hydrogenated 
starch hydrolysates have less than half of the sweetening power of sucrose, and 
for this reason are usually employed for other purposes. Mannitol is frequently 
used as a dusting agent on chewing gum, intended to prevent the gum from 
sticking to the wrapper. Sweeteners from the HSH family commonly serve as 
viscosity or bodifying agents, humectants, crystallization modifiers, 
cryoprotectants, and rehydration aids. Lactitol frequently finds its way into 
blends with more potent sweeteners, such as aspartame, saccharin and 
acesulfame-K. Whatever their intended usage, all of the sugar alcohols are 
touted as being safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, lower in calories than 
sugar, and non-contributory towards tooth decay and the growth of intestinal 
yeasts.</p> 
<p>Xylitol has the additional claims of increasing absorption of B-vitamins 
and calcium, re-mineralizing tooth enamel and fighting/preventing ear 
infections,99 as well as possibly contributing to fresher breath, greater 
athletic performance, and recovery from sinus infections.100 It also takes the 
prize as the sweetener with the most bizarre application--a Japanese company 
recently began to market a line of women&rsquo;s t-shirts with xylitol infused 
into the fabric. Xylitol, like several other sugar alcohols, exhibits a cooling 
effect in the mouth. The t-shirts are intended to utilize this same property to 
keep a person cooler in warm weather.101</p> 
<p>It is interesting to note that even the manufacturers and the official 
regulatory bodies hint at the potential problems with sugar alcohols. According 
to the ADA website: &quot;All [sugar alcohols] are absorbed slowly and 
incompletely from the intestine by passive diffusion. Therefore, an excessive 
load (e.g., greater than 50 g sorbitol per day, greater than 20 g mannitol per 
day) may cause diarrhea. . . . [I]ncomplete absorption causes indirect 
metabolism of [sugar alcohols] via fermentive (sic) degradation by the 
intestinal flora. The energy return from indirect metabolism is less than the 
direct route; thus, [sugar alcohols] are referred to as reduced-energy or 
low-energy sweeteners. [The] FDA allows these nutritive sweeteners to be 
labeled as having fewer kilocalories per gram than other nutritive sweeteners. 
. . . Products with sorbitol and mannitol may have the following statement on 
the label because high intakes increase the risk of malabsorption: 
&lsquo;excess consumption may have a laxative effect.&rsquo;&quot;102</p> 
<p>The ADA description hints at more than it actually says. Sugar alcohols are 
not broken down in the stomach, so they make their way intact into the bowels. 
It is here in the bowels that the &quot;passive diffusion&quot; mentioned by 
the ADA takes place, meaning that the presence of the sugar alcohols draws 
water into the bowels. This leads to the fermentation by undesirable bacteria 
and a resultant partial degradation or &quot;metabolism&quot; of the sugar 
alcohols. (This fermentation of intestinal bacteria can lead to or exacerbate 
problems with candida and other yeast problems.) The direct result of this 
chain of events is the severe stomach cramping and diarrhea that many people 
experience after ingesting too much sugar alcohol. So how much is too much? The 
above quotation lists the official, generally agreed upon thresholds for 
sorbitol and mannitol, but each sugar alcohol has its own threshold. However, 
certain individuals have been known to experience reactions at much lower 
dosages. Lactitol in particular may be problematic in small doses, especially 
for lactose-sensitive individuals.103,104</p> 
<p>Stomach cramping and diarrhea are certainly not as serious as the 
conditions associated with some of the non-nutritive sweeteners, but the sugar 
alcohols can cause other more serious problems. One of these conditions is 
metabolic acidosis, which can lead to acid reflux and an increased risk of 
cancer of the larynx. And diabetics and hypoglycemics should be aware that 
sugar alcohols do raise blood sugar levels, although not as much as sugar. 
Sugar alcohols also promote dehydration and loss of electrolytes, creating 
feelings of excessive thirst. This is a potential concern to those who consume 
a lot of low-carb, energy bar types of foods. Exercising after consuming these 
types of products may put one at risk for heat stroke, muscle cramping and 
cardiovascular problems. Those who are trying to avoid carbohydrates and burn 
body fat should also know that sugar alcohols will immediately take the body 
out of ketosis, the state wherein fat reserves rather than dietary calories are 
being metabolized. . . assuming that the body was in a state of ketosis to 
begin with.</p> 
<p>Additional concerns with sugar alcohols stem from the fact that they seem 
to increase the frequency of seizures in epileptics, and children are 
especially sensitive to the gastrointestinal side effects, possibly due to 
their propensity for bingeing on sweet foods. Children who regularly consume 
sugar alcohols also seem to have an increased incidence of childhood obesity.105
</p> 
<p>The final word on sugar alcohols as a group seems to be a mixed message. 
The evidence does seem to support the positive claims made on behalf of these 
sweeteners, and perhaps this gives them a valid place in certain applications. 
For example, given the choice between treating a child&rsquo;s ear infection 
with a course of antibiotics or with administration of a therapeutic dose of 
xylitol, the latter option would certainly be preferable. Of course, there may 
be even better options.</p> 
<p>While sugar alcohols may indeed occur in nature, their usage as sweeteners 
also suffers from the same problem as many other sweeteners, pharmaceutical 
drugs and other substances today--one single factor from a natural food item is 
being isolated from its normal co-constituents and consumed at levels that are 
difficult to obtain when eating the food item itself. Rarely, if ever, does 
this situation lend itself to good health. While sugar alcohols are certainly 
the lesser of two evils when compared to the non-nutritive sweeteners, they 
should be consumed with prudence if at all. There are better choices.</p> 
<h3>Sugar Alcohols</h3> 
<p>The eight categories of sugar alcohols may be subdivided into mono-, di- 
and polysaccharides.</p> 
<p><strong>MONOSACCHARIDES</strong> include <strong>sorbitol</strong> (derived 
from glucose, 50 percent to 70 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status),
<strong>xylitol</strong> (derived from xylan, a substance found in the bark of 
birch trees, equally sweet as sucrose, GRAS status),<strong>mannitol</strong> 
(derived from glucose syrups, 50 percent to 70 percent as sweet as sucrose, 
permitted for limited use on an interim basis by the FDA) and<strong>erythritol
</strong> (derived from corn products,95 70 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS 
status).</p> 
<p><strong>DISACCHARIDES</strong> include <strong>lactitol</strong> (derived 
from lactose, 30 percent to 40 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status), 
maltitol (derived from maltose, 90 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status) and
<strong>isomalt</strong> (derived from enzymatically-treated sucrose, 45 
percent to 65 percent as sweet as sucrose, GRAS status).</p> 
<p><strong>POLYSACCHARIDES</strong> refers to a family of sweeteners including 
hydrogenated glucose syrups, maltitol syrups and sorbitol syrups, often called 
&quot;hydrogenated starch hydrolysates&quot; because they are produced by the 
partial hydrolysis of corn, wheat or potato starch and subsequent hydrogenation 
at high temperatures and pressure. By varying this manufacturing process, 
different end products may be created to meet different requirements of the 
food processing industry. When the final product contains 50 percent or more of 
hydrogenated glucose, it is called a hydrogenated glucose syrup. If the final 
product has 50 percent or more of maltitol or sorbitol, it is named accordingly 
as either a maltitol syrup or sorbitol syrup. Some of the end products do not 
contain a specific sugar alcohol in any clear majority; these are simply 
referred to by the generalized term--hydrogenated starch hydrolysate. This 
term, or the abbreviation &quot;HSH,&quot; may correctly be applied to any of 
these products. All HSH products have a GRAS status and are variously from 25 
percent to 50 percent as sweet as sucrose.96,97</p> <br>
<br>

<h2>Other Sweeteners</h2> 
<p>Having reviewed all of the non-nutritive sweeteners and the sugar alcohols, 
we enter into the murky, little-known world of &quot;what else is out 
there.&quot; There are a number of additional substances that defy clear 
inclusion into the previously discussed categories. Some of the remaining 
sweeteners are not classified by the FDA as being sweeteners at all, yet they 
undeniably possess some degree of sweetness. To generalize, all of these 
substances share a relatively limited degree of market share, name recognition, 
general availability and usage by the food industry or at-home consumers, but 
they are still worth reviewing. Any one of them just may turn up on a product 
label one day, and having some knowledge of what a substance is may help each 
of us to make informed purchases. Some additional sweeteners are tagalose, 
trehalose and neohesperidin dihyrochalcone (NHDC).</p> 
<h2>Tagatose</h2> 
<p>Tagatose, known scientifically as D-tagatose, is very new to the sweetening 
scene and there is comparatively little to be said about it. It was discovered 
in 1988 by scientists working for a Beltsville, Maryland corporation called 
Biospherics (the company name has since been changed to Spherix). Tagatose is 
92 percent as sweet as sucrose and is said to occur &quot;naturally&quot; in 
heated cow&rsquo;s milk and some other presumably heat-treated dairy products. 
. . so it seems that tagatose only occurs &quot;in nature&quot; to the same 
extent that heat-treated dairy products occur &quot;in nature.&quot; It is 
formed as a result of changes to lactose as heat is applied. Commercially 
available tagatose is synthetically produced from whey.</p> 
<p>Tagatose has the exact same chemical formula as ordinary fructose, but the 
molecular structures of the two are slightly different. The difference is 
virtually irrelevant to your tongue, but the digestive system has no idea how 
to handle this unnatural molecule, just as the body cannot properly assimilate 
many synthetic vitamins, which are mirror images of their natural counterparts. 
This may be why consumption of tagatose in large amounts reportedly causes 
gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea, nausea and flatulence. Only 
about 20 percent of ingested tagatose is absorbed, this taking place by means 
of metabolism in the small intestine.106</p> 
<p>Tagatose manufacturers have presented their product as a virtual panacea, 
claiming that it promotes weight loss, is safe for diabetics, shows potential 
as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of type II diabetes, reduces 
&quot;spiking&quot; of blood glucose levels, fights plaque and halitosis, is a 
prebiotic (provides food for healthy intestinal bacteria), fights colon cancer, 
combats certain types of pathogenic bacteria and microorganisms, and raises 
blood levels of the &quot;good&quot; HDL-cholesterol.</p> 
<p>In 1996, Spherix granted a license to Arla Foods of Denmark to produce and 
market the sweetener. While a few other countries had previously given a green 
light to tagatose, in April of 2001 the FDA accepted it as a GRAS substance for 
use in foods, beverages, cosmetics, toothpastes and pharmaceutical drugs. 
However, Spherix is currently arbitrating a legal dispute against Arla Foods 
concerning the new sweetener, thus delaying the entry of tagatose into the US 
market. It is not yet available as a commercial tabletop sweetener, and it was 
as recently as August 21, 2003, that 7-Eleven Inc. became the very first 
American company to use tagatose (marketed by Spherix as Naturlose) in a food 
or beverage--a Diet-Pepsi-flavored Slurpee drink. We can expect to see much 
more of Naturlose/tagatose in the future, as Arla Foods and Spherix are both 
actively promoting its use around the world.107</p> 
<h2>Trehalose</h2> 
<p>Trehalose, a disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules, is only 45 
percent as sweet as sucrose. It is also referred to as a,a-Trehalose, mushroom 
sugar or mycose, but its proper chemical name is a-D-glucopyranosyl 
a-D-glucopyranoside. It was first identified as a constituent in the ergot of 
rye in 1832, even before the discovery of saccharin. (Ergot is a fungus known 
to afflict rye and other cereal grains and grasses.) The term 
&quot;trehalose&quot; was coined in later years when the same substance was 
identified as a component of the secretions of a beetle in the Iraqi desert. 
These secretions, known by native peoples to be edible and sweet, were called 
the &quot;trehala manna.&quot; Some people believe that this is a similar 
substance to the manna that was gathered and eaten by the Israelites of the Old 
Testament.</p> 
<p>Trehalose occurs naturally in a number of foods, including honey, wines, 
sherries, breads, lobster, crab, prawns, brine shrimp, various edible fungi 
(including commercially-grown mushrooms), insects, baker&rsquo;s yeast and 
brewer&rsquo;s yeast. As such, it has always been a part of the human diet, but 
has only been available as an isolated ingredient since 1995. Previously it had 
been too expensive to extract or produce commercially, but Hayashibara 
Biochemical Laboratories of Okayama, Japan developed a feasible method using 
the action of soil microorganisms on starch. Hayashibara&rsquo;s trehalose is 
the only source currently in production, and Japan is by far the largest 
consumer of products containing trehalose.</p> 
<p>When trehalose is ingested, it undergoes a similar digestive process as 
other disaccharides; it is enzymatically broken into individual glucose 
molecules which the body then metabolizes. As with lactose (another 
disaccharide) which requires a special enzyme, lactase, to break it down, a 
small percentage of people are genetically prone towards deficiency in 
trehalase, the enzyme that metabolizes trehalose. These people may experience 
intestinal distress after consuming foods containing trehalose, whether they be 
natural sources of the sugar or not. This appears to be the only safety issue 
with trehalose.</p> 
<p>The low level of sweetness has limited the applications of trehalose as a 
sweetening agent, but it has not stopped the food industry from finding other 
uses. Its potential applications include stabilizing proteins in dried or 
frozen foods, stabilizing flavors, colors and fatty acids, and maintaining the 
texture of food coatings. Trehalose was given GRAS status in the US in October 
of 2000 and is approved as a food additive in Britain, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. 
Trehalose is not commercially available to consumers anywhere at this time.108

<h2>NHDC</h2> 
<p>Next on the list is neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, usually abbreviated to 
NHDC or neohesperidin DC. NHDC is a type of flavonoid, a broad term referring 
to a group of over 4000 substances known to occur naturally in all higher forms 
of plants. (A particularly beneficial subset of the flavonoids is the 
bioflavonoids, which are sometimes collectively called &quot;Vitamin P.&quot;) 
NHDC is grouped as a flavonoid, yet it has not been discovered anywhere in a 
naturally-occurring state.</p> 
<p>In 1963, NHDC was discovered by two researchers by the names of Horowitz 
and Gentili who were studying bitter compounds found in citrus fruits. After 
experimentally hydrogenating a particular citrus phenolic glycoside, they 
observed that the resultant compound was very sweet, 1500 to 1800 times sweeter 
than sucrose. The two then performed similar experiments on other citrus 
derivatives and discovered several additional sweet compounds, but it was only 
the original product, NHDC, which would go on to have commercial application.
</p> 
<p>Industry-sponsored tests did not find any safety issues with the use of 
NHDC, and also ruled that it does not promote cavities. NHDC does not function 
well as the sole sweetening agent in food items due to its slow onset of 
sweetness and a lingering menthol or licorice aftertaste. For these and other 
reasons, it has found more favor as a component of sweetener blends and as a 
flavor-modifying/enhancing agent. NHDC has been accorded various levels of 
regulatory status around the world. The European Union, Switzerland, the Czech 
Republic and Turkey allow it to be used as a sweetener. Australia and New 
Zealand allow NHDC as an artificial flavoring. In the U.S., it is only allowed 
as a flavor ingredient (used at levels below the threshold of sweetness) in 16 
food categories. NHDC is marketed world-wide under the name Citrosa by the 
Spanish-based Exquim, S.A. company, a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical group 
Ferrer Internacional, S.A.109,110,111</p> 
<h2>Healthy Options</h2> 
<p>Clearly, most artificial sweeteners in use today pose significant dangers. 
Mother Nature did not intend for us to suffer from the Sugar-Free Blues. There 
are many healthy alternatives to both refined sugar and artificial sweeteners, 
including maple syrup, dehydrated sugar cane juice (sold as Sucanat and 
Rapadura), date sugar, raw unfiltered honey and molasses. Consumed in 
moderation as part of a nutrient-dense diet that includes plenty of good 
quality fats, these mineral-rich, naturally sweet foods allow us to enjoy the 
sweet taste while nourishing the body at the same time. In strict moderation, 
they can even be used by diabetics in conjunction with a nutrient-dense, 
high-fat diet.</p> 
<p><strong></strong></p> 
<h3>Better Options--Updated 12 APR 2004</h3> 
<p>Many healthful and promising alternative sweeteners are now available to 
the informed consumer; please note that most of the good options are provided 
to us by plants and herbs, while most of the bad options have been created in 
laboratories.</p> 
<p>From this point on (beginning with thaumatin) is what the author likes to 
term as &quot;the best options,&quot; although not all of them are readily 
available options at this time for various reasons. This section has been 
updated from what originally appeared in the print edition of<em>Wise Traditions
</em>, Winter 2003. Note that reference numbers in this section correspond to 
the &quot;References Corresponding to Better Options Addendum&quot; list 
following the original references.</p> 
<h4>Thaumatin</h4> 
<p>Thaumatin is a naturally-occurring sweet protein (not a carbohydrate at 
all) derived from the berries of the West African Katemfe plant, also called 
the sweet prayer plant and the miracle plant, botanically known as<em>
Thaumatococcus daniellii</em>. More correctly, there are five separate sweet 
proteins which may be isolated and derived from Katemfe berries--thaumatins I, 
II, III, a and b. These five are collectively referred to as thaumatin in a 
generalized sense. Thaumatin is metabolized by the human body similarly as 
other proteins.</p> 
<p>The Katemfe plant was first &quot;discovered&quot; by the Western world by 
a British Army Surgeon, W. F. Daniell, during his army posting in West Africa 
in the 1840s. He observed that the local people used it &quot;to improve sour 
fruit and bad palm wine.&quot; He wrote of the fruit's &quot;extraordinary 
power on the palate,&quot; and clearly identified its capabilities &quot;to 
enhance flavours and mask off-notes.&quot;112 The actual proteins responsible 
for the sweetness were first isolated from the plant and identified in 1971 by 
H. van der Wel. They were found to be 3000 times sweeter than sucrose, thus 
making thaumatin the sweetest natural substance known to man.113 (Thaumatin 
also has the unusual distinction of having been selected by NASA to be 
synthesized in a space lab orbiting the Earth. They chose it due to the fact 
that thaumatin molecules have a very unusual crystalline structure, suitable to 
the research that NASA was doing at the time.)114</p> 
<p>Immediately grasping upon the potential of this newly-identified sweetener, 
the British sugar multinational Tate &amp; Lyle established massive Katemfe 
plantations in Ghana, Liberia and Malaysia in the 1970s. The berries were 
frozen and shipped to its factories in the UK. The food industry, in their 
never-ending quest to increase their profits and jeopardize the safety of our 
foods, later found a way to use genetic engineering and gene splicing to 
produce the sweet thaumatin proteins from bacterial cultures, thus by-passing 
the need to cultivate, harvest, transport and process any Katemfe berries. 
Although this technology exists, for reasons unknown it has not been 
commercially utilized yet.115</p> 
<p>Choosing a brand name of Talin for the new product, Tate &amp; Lyle 
established a subsidiary called The Talin Company to handle its production and 
marketing. The Talin Company changed hands several times and underwent a 
corporate merger before being acquired by The Braes Group, a European natural 
food ingredients company. The production of Talin is now handled by a British 
subsidiary of The Braes Group, Overseal Foods, Ltd.116</p> 
<p>Thaumatin was first permitted as a food additive by the Japanese in 1979 
and has since been approved as a sweetener in Australia and several European 
countries. It has been given GRAS status in the U.S., but is only allowed as a 
flavor enhancer in flavoring agents, animal feeds, oral care products and 
beverages. It is also used in other countries in sweetener blends, chewing 
gums, vitamin tablets, baked goods, dairy products and pharmaceuticals.117 
While Talin is not commercially available to the average consumer in this 
country, it is possible to order the dried, unprocessed fruit of the Katemfe 
plant online atwww.bouncingb.com/thaumatococcus_danielli.php . (It is not 
cheap, though--1 ounce of the dried fruit goes for $30.)</p> 
<h4>Stevia</h4> 
<p>Stevia, another natural sweetener derived from a plant, is becoming a 
well-known option in many U.S. health food stores. A native of Paraguay and a 
member of the sunflower family, the stevia plant is botanically known as Stevia 
rebaudiana. The plant is also referred to as Bertoni, a nod of remembrance 
toward Moises S. Bertoni, the Italian botanist who first studied stevia in 1899.
118 Taken as a whole, the leaves of the stevia plant average at about 30 times 
sweeter than sucrose.119 Scientists have isolated and named a number of 
individual sweet compounds within the stevia plant, chiefly including 
stevioside, steviobioside, rebaudiosides A, B, C, D and E, and dulcoside A. The 
sweetness of these purified substances varies between 50 to 450 times that of 
sucrose. (Stevioside, the most commonly-used extractive of stevia, is about 300 
times sweeter than sucrose.)120</p> 
<p>Stevia leaves and stevioside are virtually calorie-free, beneficial in the 
prevention of cavities and do not trigger a rise in blood sugar. They are not 
only safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, but in some countries stevia leaves 
are even prescribed as a medicinal substance for these conditions because they 
normalize pancreatic function and thus aid in the metabolism of sugar.121 The 
whole stevia leaves contain a number of beneficial compounds, including 
ascorbic acid, calcium, beta-carotene, chromium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, 
manganese, niacin, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, selenium, silicon, 
sodium, thiamin, tin and zinc.122 (It should be noted that only the whole 
stevia leaves have nutritive benefits. Stevioside extracts merely function as a 
sweetener and pass through the body undigested, although they do possess 
anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.)123 When applied topically, the 
stevia leaves also fight acne and speed wound healing while also reducing the 
formation of scar tissue.124</p> 
<p>While natives of Paraguay have used the stevia plant for many centuries, 
the western world has also had a few centuries of experience with this sweet 
plant, dating back much earlier than Bertoni&rsquo;s time. Spanish 
Conquistadors of the sixteenth century learned about stevia from the local 
Guarani and Mato Grosso societies, who used it to sweeten teas and herbal 
medicines. Early European settlers sweetened foods, teas and other beverages 
with stevia, and Gauchos (the local version of what we might call cowboys) in 
the region of Paraguay later used it as a sweetener.</p> 
<p>In the early 1970s, the Japanese government and regulatory agencies began 
to take a distinct stand against artificial sweeteners, especially aspartame, 
due to their possible health risks. After conducting extensive tests on stevia 
and stevioside, they accepted it as a safe alternative and gave it government 
sanction for widespread usage. By 1977 the Maruzen Kasei Co., Ltd. started 
extracting stevioside on a commercial basis in Japan. For over 25 years now, 
the Japanese have used stevia and its extracts as a table top sweetener, in 
soft drinks, baked goods, pickles, fruit juices, jams and jellies, candies, 
yogurts, pastries, chewing gum, sherbets, toothpaste and tobacco products. It 
has reportedly captured over 50% of the Japanese sweetening market,125 even 
though the Japanese technically classify it as a food additive. In all this 
time, there have never been any reports of toxicity or adverse reactions to its 
usage. Stevia is also used as a sweet food additive in South Korea, Brazil, 
Argentina and Paraguay, and as a dietary supplement in China, western Europe 
and the U.S.126</p> 
<p>Stevia did not have a very easy entry into the U.S. market. The earliest 
introduction into this country was probably in the late 1970s or early 
&lsquo;80s. Although the FDA had not ruled on stevia one way or another at that 
time, a provision in federal law allows for the food industry to make a 
self-determination of Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status for items with 
a long history of &quot;common use in food&quot; prior to 1958, providing that 
it enjoyed widespread use without any apparent adverse health effects.</p> 
<p>There was relatively little popular awareness of stevia at that time, but a 
handful of food producers were including it in their products under that most 
nebulous of categories--&quot;natural flavors.&quot; Among those marketing or 
developing products containing stevia were the Lipton Tea Company, Celestial 
Seasonings, and Traditional Medicinals, as well as a host of smaller firms. One 
of these smaller firms was a Utah-based nutritional products company by the 
name of Sunrider International.</p> 
<p>In 1985, Kerry Nielson was director of operations at Sunrider. (The reader 
is advised to recall that this was the same time period during which G D Searle 
&amp; Company and Monsanto were winning major victories toward FDA approval of 
aspartame. Whereas the patent on aspartame was extremely lucrative for these 
companies, it is impossible under U.S. law to hold a patent on a naturally 
occurring substance.) Nielson and his company were among the first to feel the 
regulatory backlash directed at stevia and its purveyors.</p> 
<p>Sunrider, which had recently began marketing a stevioside sweetening 
product called Trusweet, was informed of a trademark infringement complaint 
filed by the NutraSweet Company against their product. Notwithstanding the 
baseless nature of this complaint, Sunrider knew that they did not have the 
economic resources to fight a legal battle with NutraSweet. Rather than do so, 
they changed the product's name to Sunectar and hoped that this would resolve 
the issue. But this wasn't the end of Sunrider's legal problems with stevia.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paid a visit to the 
company's headquarters. As Mr. Nielson himself recalls, &quot;I thought it was 
strange because they asked specifically to see the stevia [whereas normally] 
they would just go through and have a look at everything&hellip;. When we took 
them over to the area where we had the stevia, the inspector dug out a bunch of 
red tags and started slapping them on everything.&quot; The stevia was all 
burned and the company was instructed to cease and desist from any further 
importation. The only explanation given by the inspectors for this action was 
&quot;suspicion of adulteration,&quot; which usually means contamination of 
some sort. However, the inspectors did not take any samples of the stevia with 
them in order to test for contamination. Sunrider continued to meet with FDA 
stonewalling on the matter and eventually gave up on the idea of using stevia 
as a sweetener, opting instead to formulate a less-controversial skin-care 
product containing stevia. Once this change of course was established, the FDA 
dropped its embargo and relinquished all concerns over its &quot;suspicion of 
adulteration.&quot;127</p> 
<p>It was around that same time that the Arizona-based Wisdom Natural Brands 
company began having problems with stevia products as well. Jim May, founder 
and president of the company, had even gone so far as to submit test samples of 
stevia to the FDA to assure that it would be okay to use it in the 
company&rsquo;s products. Initially, May received confirmation that there would 
be no problems with importing the whole leaves of the plant or a liquid 
concentrate of stevioside. However, the FDA later reversed course and ordered 
the company to stop importing all stevia products. May recounts that he was 
told in a phone conversation with the FDA that (once again) the NutraSweet 
Company had been behind the complaint. (The FDA and NutraSweet both deny that 
NutraSweet ever had any involvement in the FDA&rsquo;s actions.) May, who had 
only been selling between $100 and $200 worth of stevia per month, says that he 
was also told by one FDA agent that &quot;if [the FDA] wanted to make carrots 
[be] against the law, we could do it.&quot;128</p> 
<p>One of the next major targets would be the Colorado-based tea company 
Celestial Seasonings. In the mid 1980s, representatives of an &quot;anonymous 
firm&quot; lodged a trade complaint with the FDA, charging that the Celestial 
Seasonings company was using stevia extracts in four products which were 
therefore &quot;adulterated.&quot; The company responded by formally 
petitioning for stevia&rsquo;s GRAS status and presenting the FDA with 
substantial evidence that stevia had a long history of safe usage. The FDA 
declined to even process the company&rsquo;s petition and continued to pressure 
them to stop using stevia, as well as to turn over the names of other companies 
which were using the controversial sweetener. Under continuing harassment, 
Celestial Seasonings relented on both counts.129</p> 
<p>It would preserve some small measure of the FDA&rsquo;s dignity if these 
had only been isolated incidents, or even if they were the worst incidents of 
their kind&hellip;but it gets worse. In 1991 the FDA began to escalate the 
whole matter to the level of a War on Drugs, issuing &quot;Import Alert Number 
45-06,&quot; which declared stevia an &quot;unsafe food additive&quot; and 
prohibited its import into the U.S. (It is interesting to note that the text of 
this document mentions that stevia &quot;has been used throughout history&quot; 
without any mention of negative side effects.)130 It was in that same year when 
a gang of armed federal marshals raided the Arlington, Texas warehouse of 
businessman Oscar Rodes, served him with a warrant, and proceeded to seize and 
burn his most recent shipment of stevia and stevioside powder for use in 
natural teas.131 The FDA has even gone so far as to raid health food stores 
suspected of selling stevia products and to order the confiscation of books 
which refer to stevia&rsquo;s potential use as a natural sweetener.132</p> 
<p>At this point, a number of companies and individuals began to seriously 
address the task of seeking FDA approval through formal, procedural channels. 
Lynda Sadler, president of the California-based Traditional Medicinals 
herbal-tea company, along with the American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) 
and an attorney by the name of William R. Pendergast, started to work on 
persuading the FDA that the marketing of stevia should be permitted based on 
its having been used safely and widely in food prior to 1958.</p> 
<p>Pendergast and the others submitted more than 900 articles to the FDA, 
documenting that the herb has been used safely for &quot;hundreds of 
years&quot; by &quot;millions of people.&quot; The FDA said that they needed 
more specific and scientific information, so the Herbal Research Foundation did 
extensive scientific research to address specific FDA concerns. The FDA 
stonewalled this information and dragged their feet until Sadler, the AHPA and 
Pendergast were finally forced to drop the matter, which was draining much time 
and money.</p> 
<p>The Lipton Tea Company then picked up the cause in 1994, submitting a 
2-inch thick petition for GRAS status. Despite Lipton&rsquo;s credentials 
within the food industry, they met with similar bureaucratic resistance. In 
this case and the previous attempts by Pendergast et al., the FDA ignored their 
usual protocol and refused to even file the petitions for approval. Once a 
petition is filed, the information submitted becomes available for public 
review during the same time period in which the FDA is reviewing it. This would 
have left the FDA in the position of having to publicly defend its actions, 
something which they were unwilling to do. In one meeting with FDA officials, 
an AHPA representative asked what amount of information would be required for 
submission before the FDA would formally file a petition. The FDA's Direct 
Additives Branch chief, Eugene Coleman, replied: &quot;This may sound flippant, 
but we [will] know that number when we see it.&quot;133</p> 
<p>On the rare occasions when someone managed to get a straight answer from an 
FDA official as to their bizarre stance towards stevia, the usual reasons have 
been suspicions of toxicity and/or a possible adverse effect on fertility. 
(Some sources also say that the FDA refuses to label any natural substance as a 
sweetener unless it is a carbohydrate.)134 These allegations are based upon two 
studies--a 1968 rat study and a 1988 mouse study published in a Brazilian 
pharmacological journal.</p> 
<p>The first of these two was conducted in Uruguay by a Purdue University 
biochemist named Joseph Kuc. While the FDA interprets this study as casting 
reasonable doubt upon the safety of stevia, Kuc himself has gone on record as 
saying that his results are not supportive of these claims. While the rats in 
the study did suffer from the effects of toxicity and from a reduction in the 
numbers of offspring, Kuc points out that they were fed the entire stevia 
plant, not just the sweet leaves. The Brazilian study involved an overly-small 
group of mice and suffered from a number of methodological and design flaws. 
The study documented only very scant information about the quantities of stevia 
which the mice consumed and how it was prepared. The FDA has also alluded to 
several South American studies which have supposedly questioned the safety of 
stevia, although they admit that they have never even been able to acquire 
copies of these studies. (It should be noted that the extensive scientific 
studies conducted on stevia by the Japanese have not indicated any toxicity or 
reproductive hazards.)135</p> 
<p>In September of 1995, after much thankless effort on the part of many 
parties, the FDA finally relented by revising their 1991 Import Alert with the 
issuance of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. Under that law, 
stevia was cleared for import into the U.S., providing that it only be labeled 
and used as a dietary supplement and not as a sweetener.136 This allows U.S. 
companies to use and sell stevia, but only by walking the narrow line of not 
implicating it in any way as a sweetener.</p> 
<p>The official status of stevia has not changed as of the time of this 
article&rsquo;s publication, but the future of this contentious little plant is 
being shaped in very exciting ways. Despite the best efforts of the 
establishment to hold it back, there exists something of an informal 
&quot;underground&quot; of those who seek to vindicate stevia and openly market 
it as a sweetener. The Price Foundation itself is playing a role in this cause, 
but one of the most well-known advocates is Donna Gates, author of The Body 
Ecology Diet. Gates openly champions the cause of stevia as a sweetener and has 
stated that she will go to jail, if necessary, to win the FDA&rsquo;s approval. 
There are also some exciting possibilities brewing in Canada, where stevia may 
be sold as a tea but not a sweetener. A Vancouver company by the name of 
Royal-Sweet International is developing a stevia sweetener which they plan to 
export into the booming Asian market, a move which just may attract the 
attention of other corporate interests. Also, there has been talk of growing 
Canadian stevia as a cash crop, possibly even replacing Canadian tobacco.137</p>
<p>To summarize, while we will all have to wait to see what the future holds 
for stevia, we should not wait to begin using it and reaping its benefits. 
There are currently a number of outlets through which one may acquire stevia 
(seewww.holisticmed.com/sweet/sweet.txt ), and they vary quite a bit in taste 
and quality. This author&rsquo;s personal favorite stevia products are 
available from Wisdom Natural Brands, found at www.wisdomherbs.com . For more 
information on stevia, the reader is advised to read the book The Stevia Story: 
A Tale of Incredible Sweetness &amp; Intrigue, by Bill and Linda Bonvie and 
Donna Gates.</p> 
<h4>Licorice root</h4> 
<p>Licorice root is a substance of which virtually everyone is aware, but 
comparatively few people realize its sweetening properties. (Although many 
people equate licorice with the sweet red strips of candy called by the same 
name, those do not actually contain any licorice root. These candy 
&quot;licorices&quot; are typically mixtures of corn syrup, sugar, flour, 
margarine and artificial flavorings.) The plant of which licorice root is the 
root is the blue flowering pea plant, botanically known as glycyrrhiza glabra. 
This plant grows wild in much of southern Europe and in Asia. Licorice root has 
been used since ancient Egyptian times to treat upset stomachs, chest 
infections and coughs, and has also been used by various cultures to ward of 
demons and invoke mystical powers.138</p> 
<p>Licorice root may be used in its unadulterated, ground-up form, or the 
primary sweetening compound may be extracted. In this case, that compound is 
known as glycyrrhizin (or also glycyrrhizic acid). Glycyrrhizin is between 50 
and 100 times sweeter than sucrose, but it also imparts a definite (and 
familiar) aftertaste of licorice. Due to its low sweetness (in comparison to 
many artificial sweeteners) and strong aftertaste, it has not enjoyed much 
success as a commercial sweetener. The exception to this is its use in herbal 
tea blends, where the licorice aftertaste may be blended quite well with other 
tastes.</p> 
<p>There is a very long historical record of the safety of licorice as a food 
and a medicinal herb. In fact, it is one of the most commonly-used herbs 
worldwide. It is safe for diabetics, but its lack of versatility as an 
all-around sweetening agent limits its potential applications. There has never 
been a single documented case of adverse reaction to the consumption of 
licorice root in its whole, ground-up form.139 This is not quite the case with 
the extracted glycyrrhizin, which is still very safe for most people but may 
cause hypertension, edema, sodium retention and mild depletion of potassium 
when consumed excessively or by certain sensitive individuals. (Many herbalists 
recommend against long-term, excessive consumption of ground licorice root due 
to concerns that it also may cause hypertension and edema in some people.) For 
this very reason, Japanese and Dutch regulatory agencies agree that the total 
daily consumption of glycyrrhizin should not exceed 200 milligrams. Adverse 
symptoms of excessive glycyrrhizin consumption generally disappear shortly 
after a person lowers their dietary intake of products containing the sweetener.
140</p> 
<h4>Glycyrrhizin</h4> 
<p>Glycyrrhizin and other compounds derived from it are widely used in Japan 
for sweetening foods, beverages, medicines, and tobacco. Within the U.S., 
glycyrrhizin has GRAS status as a flavoring agent, but is not allowed as a 
sweetener.141 To date, there is only one commercial glycyrrhizin product 
available--MagnaSweet from MAFCO Worldwide. They advertise that MagnaSweet 
&quot;can be used in a wide range of applications to enhance, intensify and 
potentiate flavors; augment or modify sweetness; eliminate or modify 
bitterness; and mask unpleasant aftertastes.&quot;142 MagnaSweet is currently 
only available to the food processing industry.</p> 
<h4>Lo Han Kuo</h4> 
<p>Lo Han Kuo (sometimes spelled Lo Han Guo) is a sweet Chinese fruit in the 
cucumber, melon, squash, and gourd family which has the potential to be as good 
of a natural option as stevia. The Lo Han fruit has been used by local people 
in southern provinces of China for centuries as a sweetener and a medicinal 
herb for the treatment of lung congestion, colds, sore throats and minor 
stomach and intestinal problems. Traditional Chinese doctors consider it to be 
a yin substance, meaning that it releases excess heat from the body. For this 
reason, it is traditionally consumed and served during the hot summer months in 
China. There has never been any recorded incidence of adverse reactions to Lo 
Han fruit or its extractives.143,144,145</p> 
<p>It was only as recently as the early 20th Century that Lo Han has come to 
the attention of the Western scientific community, and it has undergone several 
changes in its official botanical classification. Being a member of the 
Cucurbitaceae family, it was first classified as Momordica grosvenorii, then 
Thladiantha grosvenorii, and most recently as Siraitia grosvenorii. Scientific 
studies on Lo Han did not begin until the 1970s. A number of compounds (dubbed 
as mogrosides) were isolated from the fruit, of which mogrosides IV and V were 
determined to be the principle sweet constituents. The two substances are 
variously rated at being between 230 and 425 times sweeter than sucrose, 
depending upon their application.146 The whole dried fruit is 300 times sweeter 
than sucrose.147</p> 
<p>As is also the case with stevia, the human digestive system is unable to 
break down the sweet compounds within Lo Han fruit. Consequently, it triggers 
no rise in blood sugar levels and is completely safe for diabetics and 
hypoglycemics. It also helps promote the metabolization of stored body fat. 
Modern scientific research has shown that Lo Han extracts help relieve 
gastritis, constipation and respiratory inflammations, and they also appear to 
inhibit the Epstein-Barr virus and display anti-carcinogenic properties.148</p> 
<p>While the FDA has not made any conclusive rulings upon the status of Lo Han 
and its extractives, they are currently available to U.S. consumers and have 
not been opposed in any way by regulatory authorities. A case may certainly be 
made that Lo Han should be allowed as a GRAS substance due to its substantial 
history of safe usage prior to 1958. A handful of companies are marketing Lo 
Han sweetening products in the U.S. and elsewhere. Of these, the author&rsquo;s 
two product recommendations are Slim &amp; Sweet from Wisdom Natural Brands (

<h4>Glycerine</h4> 
<p>Glycerine (also spelled as glycerin or called glycerol) takes the prize as 
the most versatile and vexatious substance in our discussion. While technically 
classified by the FDA as a carbohydrate, this placement was made by default 
only. Glycerine does not qualify as a fat since it does not contain fatty 
acids, and it does not qualify as a protein because it has no amino acids, so 
the only remaining macronutrient category is the carbohydrates. Glycerine 
(which is technically known as a trihydric alcohol) definitely deserves to be 
included in the macronutrient arena, even though it defies clear categorization.
149</p> 
<p>Glycerine is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid with a very sweet and 
slightly astringent taste. Molecules of glycerine form the structural backbone 
of nearly all vegetable oils and animal fats. It was first identified in a 
laboratory in Sweden in 1779 by Karl Wilhelm Scheele. Scheele named the 
substance after the Greek word &quot;glykys,&quot; which means 
&quot;sweet.&quot;150 Glycerine is not chemically related to sugar and seems to 
have a very negligible effect on insulin and blood sugar levels, thus making it 
a safe sweetener for diabetics, hypoglycemics and people with Candida yeast 
problems.</p> 
<p>While it is not generally recommended that glycerine be consumed undiluted, 
there are a number of health benefits to consuming it as a component of foods 
or beverages. Fitness-conscious people may appreciate glycerine because it 
increases blood volume (thus helping delay dehydration when exercising), 
enhances temperature regulation and is claimed to improve physical performance 
in the heat. (It should be noted that certain individuals should avoid 
consuming excessive amounts of glycerine due to the very fact that it does 
increase blood volume. This would include pregnant women and people who suffer 
from high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney diseases.)151 Glycerine is also a 
source of lecithin and tocopherols (vitamin E).152</p> 
<p>Food-grade glycerine is produced from animal sources (usually tallow), 
vegetable sources (various vegetable oils) and from propylene alcohol. While 
the molecular structure of glycerine from any of these sources is exactly the 
same, there are obvious concerns as to the source of the glycerine which one 
may be consuming. (Unfortunately, this information is very seldom available 
when glycerine shows up as an ingredient in a product.) Some sources say that 
glycerine from propylene alcohol is irritating to the skin and scalp when used 
in topical products.153 Non-food-grade glycerine is a major by-product in the 
production of biodiesel fuels. The food industry&rsquo;s primary interest in 
glycerine is as a moisturizing/softening/texture agent, but it is also used in 
skin moisturizers, lotions, deodorants, soaps, makeup, toothpaste, 
pharmaceuticals, paper manufacturing, inks for printing, textiles, plastics, 
electronic components, paint brush cleaners, topical medications for male 
erectile dysfunction and in the manufacture of nitroglycerine (the main 
component of dynamite).154 There are over 1500 end-use applications for 
glycerine.155</p> 
<p>The issue of how glycerine is digested and used by the body is complex. The 
simple answer is that glycerine is utilized by the body in different ways (or 
not at all) depending upon the state one is in when one consumes it. Even if 
one does not consume any glycerine as an ingredient of any food items, it is 
normally liberated from various naturally occurring food sources during the 
digestive process. It is also released into the body when a person metabolizes 
body-fat reserves.</p> 
<p>No matter how the glycerine molecules find their way into the digestive 
system, their fate seems to depend upon the energy status of the person at that 
moment. If a person has a neutral or positive state of general metabolic 
energy, glycerine may be (at least partially) excreted unchanged, metabolized 
into phoshoglycerides for use within cell membranes, or used in the conversion 
of extra dietary calories into body fat. If a person is in a negative state of 
metabolic energy, the glycerine may be metabolized into energy through two 
different processes, gluconeogenesis (the production of blood glucose) or 
glycolysis (a different energy-creation pathway in the body).156</p> 
<p>In the final analysis glycerine is a sweetening option worth experimenting 
with, unless one is pregnant or has high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney 
disease. Those who suffer from Candida or other yeast problems may find it 
especially beneficial. Try to seek out glycerine available from a product line 
which is trustworthy--Frontier Natural Products is one reliable source, 
available on the internet at www.frontiercoop.com/shop/merchant.mvc (search 
under the &quot;glycerin&quot; spelling). An excellent resource for recipes 
using glycerine as a sweetener is The Complete Candida Cookbook, by Gail Burton.
</p> 
<h4>Fructooligosaccharides</h4> 
<p>Fructooligosaccharides (usually abbreviated to FOS) and inulin are terms 
referring to naturally-occurring, mildly-sweet, indigestible carbohydrates. 
(FOS is something of an umbrella term for a class of oligosaccharides; inulin 
is a specific type of FOS. Hereafter, any mention of FOS is meant to include 
inulin as well, unless otherwise specified.) While the FDA classifies FOS as 
being only a food ingredient which is usually used as a fat-replacer in low-fat 
foods, it does have some potential as a sweetening substance. It does not 
affect blood sugar levels, and so is suitable for diabetics and hypoglycemics.
157</p> 
<p>FOS is commonly extracted from chicory roots and Jerusalem artichokes (as 
it occurs in relatively large quantities in these items), but it is also found 
in onions, leeks, garlic, common artichokes, bananas, rye, barley, dandelion 
leaves, burdock roots and honey. Some presence of FOS has been noted in over 
36,000 plants worldwide, so this is a very partial list.158</p> 
<p>FOS is structurally built out of chains of fructose molecules, with the 
chains ranging from 2 to 60 units long. The number of fructose molecules which 
are bound together is called the &quot;degree of polymerization,&quot; or DP, 
and it varies according to the plant source, type of climate, time of harvest, 
and the duration and conditions of post-harvest storage. Naturally occurring 
sources of FOS generally contain mixtures of various degrees of polymerization, 
but standardized extracts of FOS generally average at a DP of about 4. Inulin 
may be standardized to an average DP of 22, which is considered to be 
long-chain inulin.159</p> 
<p>These chains of fructose cannot be broken down by the human digestive 
system, but they can be broken down and consumed by the bacteria in the 
digestive tract. For this reason, FOS is considered to be a prebiotic--a 
substance which provides nourishment for the gastrointestinal flora. 
Prebiotics, like probiotics (such as live-culture yogurt--substances which 
actually contain the same bacteria which are the beneficial flora in the human 
digestive tract), help promote regularity, prevent yeast overgrowth and are 
beneficial for those with Crohn&rsquo;s disease, colitis or who are on kidney 
dialysis. Prebiotics and probiotics are additionally beneficial when taken 
together.160</p> 
<p>The finer point here which is frequently overlooked is that nonspecific 
extracts of FOS will provide nourishment for friendly bacteria (lactobacilli, 
bifidobacteria, etc.) and pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella, 
Staphylococcus, Clostridium, etc.) alike, whereas standardized extracts of 
long-chain inulin will selectively nourish only the friendly flora. It is 
likely for this reason that some people experience gastric distress after 
consuming foods containing nonspecific blends of FOS--if one already has a 
problem with the balance of the intestinal flora, a nonspecific blend of FOS 
may exacerbate the problem.161</p> 
<p>Aside from feeding the bacteria of the digestive tract, all forms of FOS 
act as dietary fiber. Thus, consumption of FOS may help to shorten fecal 
transit time, increase fecal bulk and reduces constipation. It has also been 
shown to reduce both cholesterol and triglyceride levels and may provide 
improved absorption of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and phosphate.
162</p> 
<p>Due to the relatively-low sweetness of FOS and inulin, it is easier to use 
it for sweetening purposes in combination with another sweet substance. While 
FOS products are commercially available from different sources, the author 
recommends an inulin product called Chicolin, from BioQuest Imports 
International, Inc. (www.greenalive.com/chicolin.html). Chicolin has 
recommended specifications for blending with stevia to achieve a desirable 
level of sweetness.</p> 
<p>And finally we come to the hodgepodge category of &quot;what is left,&quot; 
a few other sweet plants and herbs that have been and are still being tested 
for possible use as commercial sweeteners. Just because they have not been 
commercially utilized doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that one could not attempt 
to cultivate them and do some personal experimentation. To that end, here is a 
short list of additional sweet plants by botanical name: Hydrangea macrophylla 
Seringe var. thunbergii (and other species in this genus), Dioscoreophyllum 
cumminsii Diels, Capparis masakai Levl, Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baillon, 
Curculigo latifolia, Lippia dulcis, Rubus suavissimus, Phlomis betonicoides 
Diels, Polypodium vulgare, Polypodium glycyrrhiza, and Pterocarya paliurus 
Batal.163 The reader is strongly advised to thoroughly research these plants 
before attempting to ingest any part(s) of them. Some technical information 
about all of the plants in this list may be found in the book, Alternative 
Sweeteners, Third Edition, Lyn O&rsquo;Brien Nabors (editor).</p> 
<p>While even this has not been a complete list of all of the 
artificial/alternative sweeteners that are available, we have at least touched 
upon all of the major options currently in use. While we have clearly found 
some of the sweeteners in use today to be plagued with numerous dangers, there 
are also many healthful and promising options available to the informed 
consumer. It is no accident that most of the good options are provided to us by 
plants and herbs, while most of the bad options have been created in 
laboratories. Mother Nature clearly did not intend for us to have to suffer 
from the Sugar-Free Blues.</p>

Info on Erythritol as a 
sweetener? <br>
written by Julia, Sep 19 2011 <br>
 I recently have started 
using an &quot;organic,gmo-free, zero glycemic index, zero calorie sweetener 
called Wholesome Organic Zero made with organic Erythritol. Does anyone at WAPF 
have an opinion about it? It looks and tastes like sugar except that it's only 
70% as sweet, so I end up using a tad bit more.<br>
<br>
Zero Artificial 
Ingredients:<br>
<br>
 * No chemicals are used in the production of Wholesome 
Sweeteners Organic Zero. Organic sugar, or sucrose, is liquefied and an 
organically approved fermenting agent is introduced. The fermentation process 
converts the sucrose to Erythritol. The liquid is then filtered and the 
Erythritol is crystallized. It takes about 2lbs of Organic Cane Sugar to 
produce 1lb of Organic Zero.<br>

 This is a great article that needs updating. Specifically, need to 
update the &quot;Stevia story&quot; to include, now that a large agrico was 
able to patent a by product and introduce into the US market as a sweetener. I 
would also like more info on sugar alcohols, particularly xylitol and 
erythritol - since, unlike some of their counterparts, they are claimed to have 
little to no impact on blood sugar and there seems to be an increase in their 
use.

written by Donna Key, Mar 19 2010 <br>
 I had a gastric by-pass in 2007, I 
thought my life was finely going to be on track after losing close to 200 lbs. 
Then 2 years after the surgery I started having terrible intestinal pain and 
gas that was extremely offensive. I talked to my surgeon, and my family doctor. 
Since the weightloss surgery I had become lactose intolerant and they said to 
take lactaid. It didn't help. I was told it was because I was drinking to much 
soda. So I quit drinking soda and drank more water with sugarfree flavor 
additives. I had splenda in my coffee in the morning and sugarfree creamer. 
Sugarfree jelly on my bagels. Sugarfree cookies, gum, candy. If it was 
available in sugarfree form, I consumed it. Three years after the surgery I was 
at my wits end. My mother suggested that it might be all the sugarfree stuff I 
consumed, so I did a little research and low and behold there in black and 
white was all the symptoms that I had been experiencing. I have given up sugar 
free products (not an easy task as it is everywhere and in everything). I have 
opted for natural sweetners now. I hope to be able to keep my weight down, and 
still enjoy a little sugar from time to time.
