<dt> <b>Bill Introduced to Stop FDA's Censorship:</b><br>
 The FDA is again 
placing restrictions on what can be said about nutritional supplements. They 
are not allowing information which has been well researched and can be found in 
the research literature to be associated with a product. They even sent me an 
alert letter giving me 15 days to remove some correct information from my web 
site, or to risk search and seizure at my place of business. I am sure I am not 
the only one. </dt> 
<p>On November 9, Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) and seven other members of Congress 
introduced the Health Freedom Protection Act (H.R. 4282) to prevent the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from censoring 
information about dietary supplements. You can read his statements at
http://www.hr4282.org/paul.htm </p> 
<p>According to The Liberty Committee, &quot;In 1994, the U.S. Congress 
ordered the FDA to let the public have access to scientific articles and 
publications on the role of nutrients in disease by passing the Dietary 
Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)....Yet, censorship by the FDA goes 
on!&quot; That is why H.R. 4282 was introduced and is being pushed by a 
coalition of some 50 companies and organizations.</p> 
<p>Congressman Paul explains that the Health Freedom Protection Act 
specifically will: (1) stop the FDA from censoring truthful claims about 
dietary supplements; (2) stop the FDA from prohibiting the distribution of 
scientific articles and publications regarding the role of nutrients in 
protecting against disease; and (3) address the FTC's violations of the First 
Amendment.</p> 
<p>In a related matter, Emord &amp; Associates, a law firm specializing in 
constitutional and administrative law, has started a national petition campaign 
to end the FDA's and FTC's violations of the First Amendment. The FDA and FTC 
violate free speech by trying to control what is communicated about 
nutrient-disease associations, according to the firm. It has drafted a petition 
to protest suppression of this health information and hopes to present Congress 
more than a million signatures by January 1, 2006.</p> 
<p>PLEASE GO TO http://www.emord.com TO PRINT AND TO SIGN THIS PETITION, THEN 
GET OTHERS TO SIGN IT AND MAIL IT IN. WHILE THERE CLICK THROUGH THE VARIOUS

<dt> <b>ALTERNATIVE SWEETENERS</b> </dt> 
<dd> &nbsp; </dd> 
<dt> <b>SHOULD YOU STAY AS SWEET AS YOU ARE?</b> </dt> 
<dd> 
<p>Those of us who have a sweet tooth and are trying our best to stay healthy 
have a true dilemma. We know sugar is bad for us, but are we able to avoid it 
most of the time???? After all, the USDA statistics show the average 
consumption of sugar to be about 20 teaspoons daily. And that is only what is 
added to food and drink, excluding the naturally occurring food sugars. The 
most commonly consumed sugars are sucrose, dextrose, corn syrup and fructose. 
These sugars raise blood sugar and insulin levels more than others do and can 
pile on fat. You can see my newsletter on thehealth effects of excess insulin.
</p> 
<p> What are our alternatives? Are they also harmful? What are the possible 
side effects of &quot;artificial sweeteners&quot;? What is the safe maximum 
daily dose? How can you know if you don't tolerate certain &quot;artificial 
sweeteners&quot;?</p> 
<p>I'll tell you right up front that saccharin is the safest of the 
&quot;artificial&quot; sweeteners and Stevia is one of the safest of the 
natural sweeteners. Neither of these increase blood sugar, increase insulin 
levels, increase weight, or are associated with adverse symptoms.</p> 
<p>However it is important to remember that most of those who get in trouble 
with any kind of a sweetener have done so because of over indulgence. We are 
conditioned to a sweet taste. The manufacturers have created a sweets polluted 
diet for us and continue to exploit our desires for &quot;sweet&quot;.</p> 
<p>There are also &quot;natural sweeteners&quot;, other than cane or beet 
sugar. Then there are natural verses refined sugars. Sweet and sugar 
everywhere, with hardly a food label without a form of sweetener. How can you 
find your way through the markets maze and craze to cater to our conditioned 
taste for sweets?<br>
<br>
 Being an ex~sugarholic, and liking a sweet taste, I 
thought I was doing fine with some Aspartame found in Equal and Nutrasweet. But 
my eyes were red, burning, itching, and my eyelids were crusty and stinging. 
Who would have ever thought???? Did an updated allergy test on myself and lo 
and behold, a severe allergy to Aspartame. Stopped the Equal and the eyes 
cleared, restarted and the problem came back. Now what? I also had a moderate 
allergy to saccharin most commonly found in Sweet n Low. So a quest for new, 
safe, tasty sweeteners was begun.<br>
<br>
 You may have heard some of the 
general drawbacks of the artificial sweeteners which would apply to most 
people. But you probably have not thought much about them being an issue from 
an allergy/intolerance point of view. Fortunately, we can test for that. The 
test I use for allergies is theComprehensive Panel II from Alcat.com. Click on 
the 'Comprehensive Panels', then 'Order Panel II' if you wish to take the test. 
This includes 100 foods, 21 molds, 10 food additives such as the artificial 
sweeteners, 10 food colorings, and 10 common environmental chemicals and costs 
$381.92. The food test portion will also test for cane, corn and beet sugar 
allergies. If you are allergic to corn, you would avoid corn syrup as a food 
sweetener.</p> 
<p> If you only want to check for the artificial sweeteners, you can save 
money by just ordering the 10 Food Additives Panel for $87.50. You can browse 
around their website for more information.</p> 
<p>Some people are not necessarily &quot;allergic&quot; to glucose (sugar) or 
fructose (fruit sugar) , but are nevertheless intolerant of these sugars or 
have a metabolic difficulty processing them in their bodies. This may result in 
problems.</p> 
<p>Symptoms of fructose intolerance can be behavioral changes, depressed 
immune function, dizziness, fatigue, headache, and weakness. There can also be 
increased triglycerides, an interference with copper metabolism, and increased 
uric acid as in gout.</p> 
<p>A glucose/insulin metabolism imbalance can be a cause of hypoglycemia or 
hyperglycemia (diabetes). There may also be insulin resistance and the 
development of obesity. Other symptoms of this imbalance can be cold hands and 
feet, disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, and any of the 
other myriad of symptoms associated with too high or too low blood sugar.</p> 
<p>These glucose and fructose intolerances can be tested as part of the FIA 
Comprehensive 5000 Analysis atSpectraCell.com and click on lab services. You 
can click on find a clinician to locate a nearby Dr to order this test for you.

<dt> <b>NATURAL SWEETENERS</b> </dt> 
<dd> The first 2 natural sweeteners are the most recommended of the group. The 
rest of the natural sweeteners can be varied and used in moderation. When 
applicable, organic is always preferable. The best of the natural sweeteners 
for minimal blood sugar effect are Stevia, Lo Han Kuo Fruit, and the sugar 
alcohols to be discussed below. All of the natural sweeteners contain some 
calories, (though less than sugar) except for Stevia and Lo Han Kuo fruit </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> STEVIA EXTRACT </dd> 
<dd> is derived from the leaves of the Stevia plant. It was used for centuries 
by the Indians in South America as a remedy for diabetes and gum disease. 
Stevia has also been reported to possess anti-viral activity and may have blood 
pressure lowering properties. The Japanese food processors have used it widely 
in many foods since the 1970's. The FDA has approved it as a food supplement, 
but not as a sweetener. Stevia is 250-300 times sweeter than glucose. What I 
like about Stevia is it contains no calories and does not increase blood sugar, 
so it is safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics. Stevia can vary in taste. A 
problem I previously found with some of the liquid extracts of Stevia was the 
taste was too strong and overwhelmed what I was sweetening. But I have found 
some excellent products which do not do this. Use small amounts as it is very 
sweet. You might be happiest with theStevia products, especially the White 
Stevia Powder. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> LO HAN KUO FRUIT (SLIMSWEET, SWEETLIFE)<br>
 is derived from a Chinese 
fruit containing a natural sweetening agent called a mogroside which is 300 
times sweeter than cane sugar. I like it because it also creates no increase in 
blood sugar and contains no calories. For more you can see
http://www.nunaturals.com/products/lohan.html </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> D-TAGATOSE (WHEY-LOW, NATURLOSE)<br>
 is a natural whey-derived sugar 
which has 1 calorie per gram verses table sugar at 4 calories per gram. It has 
a reduced glycemic index of 20 verses 100 for glucose. This is important to 
diabetics, low-carb dieters, and glucose intolerants. Whey sugar does contain 
lactose, so those intolerant of this should avoid. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> RAW ORGANIC HONEY<br>
 is not heated or processed and thus maintains the 
nutrients found in honey. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> MAPLE SYRUP<br>
 is one of the best liquid sweeteners. There are 3 grades 
of maple syrup. Grade A is the lightest and least maple tasting while Grade C 
is the heaviest and darkest. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> INULIN<br>
 is what is called a fructo oligosaccharide, very high in 
soluble fiber, with minimal blood sugar and insulin consequence. Inulin is 
usually derived from Jerusalem Artichokes, or chicory roots. Inulin passed 
through the upper bowel to reach the lower bowel intact. There it is fermented 
by bacteria in the bowel and there it feeds organisms such as the desirable 
acidophilus and bifidus. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Some inulin-based products are BeFlora Plus and Bake Flora. These are a 
blend of oligofructose, fructose(hydrolyzed from the oligofructose) , and 
enriched sprouted mung bean extract. BeFlora Plus is 10 times sweeter than 
sugar, and Beflora is equal to sugar in sweetness. Bakeflora is equal to sugar 
in sweetness. The drawback is a small amount of the sweetener Acesulfame K is 
added to the nutritive mixture upon which the sprouted mung beans are grown. 
You can see more on these products at
http://www.roxlor.com/bakeflora/prodapp.html </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> BARLEY MALT<br>
 is a slow digesting sweetener made from sprouted barley 
which is broken down in to the sugar maltose. It is not as sweet as honey. It 
is boldly flavored but can be a good substitute for brown sugar. You can use it 
as syrup or a powder. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> BROWN RICE SYRUP OR GRANULATED BROWN RICE SWEETENER<br>
 is made from 
brown rice and sometimes sprouted whole barley. It is a complex sugar which 
allows it to be broken down and absorbed more slowly than simple sugars, thus 
causing less of a blood sugar spike, but still will impact blood sugar. Brown 
rice sweeteners have a mild flavor similar to honey but less intensely sweet. 
Its delicate flavor allows it to meld well with other ingredients. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> AMASAKE </dd> 
<dd> (is a sweet creamy beverage made from fermented sweet brown rice), </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> FRUIT CONCENTRATE OR FRUIT JUICE SWEETENERS<br>
 are often used in sugar 
free pastries and other food and drink items. This most often is stated as pear 
or apple juice concentrate,. These are a combination of the simple sugars, 
fructose, glucose, and sucrose. This contains 2.3 calories per gram. Fructose 
can elevate triglycerides levels. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> ORGANIC MOLASSES<br>
 as a syrup or a powder. Molasses is a by product of 
the process of refining sugar cane in to table sugar. Sweet molasses or light 
molasses has a lighter flavor than blackstrap molasses which has a strong 
bitter tart favor which is too interfering to use as a sweetener unless you 
don't mind it influencing the taste of whatever is being sweetened. It is more 
nutritious re vitamins, minerals, and trace elements than most other sweeteners.
</dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> SORGHUM SYRUP<br>
 is produced by crushing sorghum plants. It too has a 
strong taste and contains iron, calcium and potassium </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> DATE SUGAR<br>
 is ground from dehydrated dates. It is high in fiber and 
rich in vitamins and minerals. It is useful in cooking, but not in sweetening 
beverages as the tiny pieces will not dissolve. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> AGAVE NECTAR<br>
 is extracted from the inner core of the Agave cactus 
plant. It tastes like a cross between honey and maple syrup. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> ORGANIC DRIED NATURAL CANE JUICE (SUCANET) <br>
 may contain some 
calories, but also has some nutritional value. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> TREHALOSE </dd> 
<dd>  is a new sweetener. It is found naturally in honey, mushrooms and other 
foods. But Trehalose is commercially produced from cornstarch, which can cause 
allergic reactions and stomach irritations in some people. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> YACON </dd> 
<dd>  is a sweet root from South America which is used there to lower blood 
sugar and help treat diabetes. it has not yet been commercially produced as a 
sweetener, but it is available as a honey and a jam </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> SUGAR ALCOHOLS: XYLITOL, SORBITOL, ERYTHRITOL, MANNITOL, MALTITOL, 
LACTITOL. </dd> 
<dd> Sugar alcohols do not have sugar, but do have carbohydrates, and 
approximately &frac12;-3/4 the calories of regular sugar. Sugar alcohols occur 
naturally in foods and come from plants such as fruits and berries. These 
sweeteners can be used with diabetes, but can mildly change blood sugar levels. 
All who eat sugar alcohols must be careful of the quantity of intake BECAUSE 
EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION OF THE SUGAR ALCOHOLS CAN CAUSE GAS AND/OR DIARRHEA. The 
tendency towards this varies with each product. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> XYLITOL </dd> 
<dd> is preferable to the other sugar alcohols . It was discovered in 1891 and 
has been used as a sweetener since the 1960's. It is safe to use with no 
consumption limits other than some risk for gas or diarrhea with too high an 
individual dose, but Xylitol causes less gastrointestinal symptoms than most of 
the other sugar alcohols. Xylitol has been well researched with around 1500 
published studies. . It is approved for use as a sweetener in 35 countries and 
is starting to become more popular in the U.S. It is the only sugar alcohol 
which fights the bacteria that causes gum disease and cavities. It also 
decreases plaque formation. Xylitol is an excellent choice for sugarless gum. 
Xylitol helps prevent sinus and ear infections, and may guard against 
osteoporosis. It also inhibits yeast overgrowth. It does not cause significant 
changes in blood sugar or insulin levels, and has 40% less calories than 
regular sugar. Some studies suggested that controlling gum infections in 
diabetics also helped to control and to decrease blood sugar. A study showed 
that as many as 18% of premature births were caused by gum disease, an impact 
as strong as that of smoking or alcohol abuse. Studies have also suggested 
Xylitol increases energy by enhancing ATP production, increases utilization of 
fat, increases endurance, and has antioxidant functions. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> SORBITOL </dd> 
<dd>  is commonly used in a wide range of dietetic foods, liquid over the 
counter, and prescription medicines. It is 50-70% as sweet as sugar and 1.6 
calories/gram. It can create more gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea than 
Xylitol., or the other sugar alcohols. Children are especially prone to this. 
Citizens have called for the FDA to require a warning label on Sorbitol 
containing products to read as follows, &quot;NOTICE: This product contains 
Sorbitol which may cause diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain. Not suitable 
for consumption by children. To protect yourself, start by eating no more than 
one serving at a time.&quot; </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> ERYTHRITOL </dd> 
<dd>  is a white powder with a taste similar to sucrose, but about 70% as 
sweet and 0.2 calories/gram, the lowest calories of the sugar alcohols. This 
sugar alcohol has fewer calories and a better digestive tolerance than most of 
the other sugar alcohols except Xylitol. It does not affect blood sugar or 
insulin levels. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> ISOMALT </dd> 
<dd>  is 45-65% as sweet as sugar and 2 calories/gram. It is derived from 
sugar by enzymatic conversion to isomaltose. It is used in some prepared and 
baked foods. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> LACTITOL </dd> 
<dd>  is derived from lactose (from milk) and is 30-40% as sweet as sucrose 
and 2 calories/gram. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> MALTITOL </dd> 
<dd> is made from maltose which is derived from chicory and roasted malt. It 
is 90% as sweet as sucrose and 2.1 calories per gram. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> &nbsp; </dd> 
<dt> <b>ARTIFICIAL (CHEMICAL) SWEETENERS</b> </dt> 
<dd> These usually have no calories and do not raise blood sugar. However, 
some are problematic when used in excess. There has been considerable debate 
and controversy about these ill effects. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> SACCHARIN (SWEET N LOW, SUGAR TWIN, SUCARYL, SWEET MAGIC, ZERO-CAL) </dd> 
<dd> Saccharin was first discovered in 1879 and has been used around the world 
for almost 100 years. The common brand name is Sweet and Low. If you are not 
allergic to it, as discussed above, my opinion is that it is one of the safer 
of the artificial sweeteners. The old fear about it possibly being implicated 
in bladder cancer has been debunked. Saccharin also works well as a sugar 
substitute in cooking. It is 500 times sweeter than sugar.<br>
 . <br>
 
Saccharin is one of the most studied food ingredients and the totality of 
evidence indicates it is safe for human consumption. Challenges to the safety 
of saccharin began in 1977. Interestingly, the same time as the &quot;political 
way&quot; was being paved for Aspartame which was introduced in to our food 
supply in 1981, after first being approved in 1974, then withdrawn because of 
sloppy research from 1967-1975. Aspartame was nevertheless later approved, 
despite the persistence of inconclusive evidence as to its safety, and 
Aspartame somewhat knocked saccharin down and almost out of the market place 
for awhile. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> SUCRALOSE (SPLENDA) </dd> 
<dd> Splenda is actually made from sugar, so you would not use it if you are 
allergic or intolerant to sugar. Pre-approval research has shown that long term 
or heavy use may contribute to serious chronic immunological or neurological 
disorders. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Splenda has had considerable recent promotion, but is not a sweetener I 
advise using. As of May 2004 over 3000 products were marketed which are 
sweetened with Splenda. For more detail about potential risks with Splenda see
http://www.splendaexposed.com/ or for a complete book on the topic see 
http://www.issplendasafe.com/ </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> ACESULFAM-K ( Sunette, Sweet &amp; Safe, Sweet One)<br>
 Was approved by 
the FDA for use as a sweetener in 1988. It is not adequately studied and some 
of the studies are controversial. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> CYCLAMATE (Sugar Twin)<br>
 Has lingering questions about toxicity risks, 
especially testicular. Though approved for use in 50 countries, it is not 
approved in the United States. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> ASPARTAME (Equal, Nutrasweet) </dd> 
<dd> This is one of my least recommended and the most dangerous of the 
alternative sweeteners. It is also the most extensively added to our food and 
drink. See theAspartame Consumer Safety Network, The Aspartame (Nutrasweet) 
Toxicity Information Center, or Aspartame the Bad News for relevant details.<br>
<br> Currently, aspartame is consumed by over 200 million people around the 
world and is found in more than 6,000 products including carbonated soft 
drinks, powdered soft drinks, chewing gum, confections, gelatins, dessert 
mixes, puddings and fillings, frozen desserts, yogurt, tabletop sweeteners, and 
some pharmaceuticals such as vitamins and sugar-free cough drops. In the United 
States, all food ingredients, including aspartame, must be listed in the 
ingredient statement on the food label.<br>
<br>
 Three Senate hearings have 
been conducted on the safety of aspartame, and the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest (CSPI) in Washington, D.C., now lists it as the third-worst 
additive.<br>
<br>
 If you really want to delve in to this, you can read the 
book, Deadly Deception - Story of Aspartame [1998]. </dd> 
<dd> &nbsp; </dd> 
<dt> <b>WHAT TO DO?</b> </dt> 
<dd> Stop eating or drinking anything with refined white sugar (sucrose, 
glucose ) on some labels. Avoid high fructose corn syrup, brown sugar, which is 
often mixed with molasses or sprayed with caramel coloring , raw sugar, corn 
syrup, and turbinado sugar.<br>
 Avoid Aspartame (Nutrasweet, Equal) and all 
the artificial sweeteners except saccharin. </dd> 
<dt> &nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> <b>Vary the sweeteners you do use.</b> </dd> 
<dd> You can use saccharin (Sweet and Low). Select from the list of natural 
sweeteners above. Stevia or Lo Han Kuo are healthy and preferable. However, 
remember if it tastes very sweet it likely has too much sweetener in it. If a 
sweetener is listed as one of the first ingredients on a product, it is one of 
the main components of that food by weight, so avoid it. </dd>
