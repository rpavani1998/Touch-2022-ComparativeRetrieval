<h2>Low-carb diet: Can it help you lose weight?</h2> 
<h2>Results</h2> 
<p> <strong>Weight loss<br>
</strong>Most people can lose weight on almost any 
diet plan that restricts calories and what you can eat &mdash; at least in the 
short term. Over the long term, though, studies show that it's common to regain 
the lost weight, regardless of the diet plan you follow. Some studies also have 
shown that people who continued to follow certain low-carb diet plans for two 
years lost an average of nearly 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms) overall, which is 
similar to the amount of weight lost on higher carbohydrate diets. And it may 
not be just cutting carbs that leads to weight loss. Some studies show that you 
may shed some weight because you eat less on low-carb diets because the extra 
protein and fat keep you feeling full longer.</p> 
<p> <strong>Other health benefits<br>
</strong>Some low-carb diets, including 
the Atkins Diet, say that their eating plans can prevent or improve serious 
health conditions, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, high blood pressure 
and cardiovascular disease. In fact, almost any diet that helps you shed excess 
weight can reduce or even reverse risks factors for cardiovascular disease and 
diabetes. Most weight-loss diets &mdash; not just low-carb diets &mdash; may 
improve blood cholesterol or blood sugar levels, at least temporarily. Low-carb 
diets may improve HDL cholesterol and triglyceride values slightly more than do 
moderate-carb diets. And it may not only be how many carbs you eat but also the 
kinds of carbs you eat that are important to your health. Whole grains, 
legumes, vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy products, for instance, are 
generally healthier than are carbs from sweets and processed and refined 
grains, such as potato chips, white bread and white rice.</p> 
<h2>Risks</h2> 
<p> If you suddenly and drastically cut carbs, you may experience a variety of 
temporary health effects, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Headache</li> 
<li>Dizziness</li> 
<li>Weakness</li> 
<li>Fatigue</li> 
<li>Constipation</li> </ul> 
<p> In addition, some diets restrict carbohydrate intake so much that they can 
result in nutritional deficiencies or insufficient fiber. This can cause such 
health problems as constipation, diarrhea and nausea. Eating carbs that are 
high fiber, whole grain and nutrient dense can improve the health profile of 
some low-carb diet programs. And some low-carb diets, such as Atkins, now 
recommend taking small amounts of extra salt, along with vitamins or 
supplements, to help prevent diet side effects.</p> 
<p> It's also possible that severely restricting carbohydrates to less than 20 
grams a day can result in ketosis. Ketosis occurs when you don't have enough 
sugar (glucose) for energy, so your body breaks down stored fat, causing 
ketones to build up in your body. Side effects from ketosis can include nausea, 
headache, mental fatigue and bad breath.</p> 
<p> It's not clear what kind of possible long-term health risks a low-carb 
diet may pose because most research studies have lasted less than a year. Some 
health experts believe that if you eat large amounts of fat and protein from 
animal sources your risk of heart disease or certain cancers may increase.</p>
