<br> 
<p>In An Open Letter to the Next Farmer in Chief, recently published in the 
New York Times, author Michael Pollan addresses what he believes 
President-elect Obama needs to do to repair the American food system. Excerpts 
below are from his letter:</p> 
<p>If we wish address major problems such as health care crisis, energy 
independence or climate change, we will have to change the the way that we 
currently grow, process and eat food in America. This is at the heart of all 
three problems.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the current food system &mdash; characterized by 
monocultures of corn and soy in the field and cheap calories of fat, sugar and 
feedlot meat on the table &mdash; is not simply the product of the free market. 
Rather, it is the product of a specific set of government policies that 
sponsored a shift from solar (and human) energy on the farm to fossil-fuel 
energy.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>As a result:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>It takes 10 calories of fossil-fuel energy to produce a single calorie of 
modern supermarket food.</li> 
<li>After cars, the food system uses more fossil fuel than any other sector of 
the economy, ranging from 19% to as much as 37%. This includes&nbsp; chemical 
fertilizers (made from natural gas), pesticides (made from petroleum), farm 
machinery, food processing, packaging and transportation.</li> 
<li>Four of the top 10 killers in America today are chronic diseases linked to 
diet: heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes and cancer. Coincidentally, 
national health care spending increased to 16% since 1960.</li> 
<li>In the past several months more than 30 nations have experienced food 
riots, and so far one government has fallen. Should high grain prices persist 
and shortages develop, you can expect to see the pendulum shift decisively away 
from free trade, at least in food.</li> 
<li>We have little control over the safety of imported foods. The deliberate 
contamination of our food presents a national-security threat.</li> 
<li>Subsidized monocultures of grain also led directly to monocultures of 
animals</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Michael Pollan&rsquo;s proposals:</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Resolarize the American Farm</strong> &ndash; Commodity farmers 
should instead be encouraged to grow as many different crops &mdash; including 
animals &mdash; as possible. Reward farmers for planting cover crops. Make 
municipal composting of food and yard waste mandatory and distribute the 
compost free to farmers. Ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed and regulate 
animal waste from feedlots just like pollutants from any factory.</li> 
<li><strong>Reregionalize the Food System</strong> &ndash; Create four-season 
farmers markets;create Agricultural Enterprise Zones so that local farmers can 
operate with less red tape than the largest producers; create local 
Meat-Inspection Corps for regional slaughter facilities;establish a strategic 
grain reserve;regionalize Federal food procurement; create a Federal definition 
of &ldquo;Food&rdquo;; open food subsidy programs to farmers&rsquo; markets and 
CSA&rsquo;s.<br>
</li> 
<li><strong>Rebuild America&rsquo;s Food Culture</strong> &ndash; Create a 
national initiative to educate our children about food; plant gardens in 
elementary schools; increase school lunch spending by $1 per pupil per day so 
they can eat real, not fast, food; have the surgeon general assume the role of 
educating the American public about food instead of the USDA; push for 
transparency in food labeling, including the cost in terms of oil, chemicals, 
the feedlot, the slaughter house. Let people know where their food comes from 
and how it got there; set an example at the White House from the chef, to 
choice of regional foods to a garden on the east lawn.</li> </ol> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope President-elect Barack Obama is listening.</p>

<h3> The Value of Unattainable&nbsp;Goals December 30, 2008</h3>  Filed under: 
environment, green &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 6:00 am <br>
 Tags: Climate Change, 
energy, Global Warming, water pollution <br>

<p>Get D.U.M.B.! The Value of Unattainable Goals, authored by Dustin Wax of 
Stepcase Lifehack, exhorts us to create<strong>Dangerously Unattainable, 
Monstrously Big goals</strong>. Goals that are audacious and set us up for 
failure. I worked in the corporate world where yearly goals were Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Realistic/Relevant, and Tangible/Time-bound, in other 
words,S.M.A.R.T. In everyday work, applying these criteria is a highly 
effective way of ensuring that the goals are good ones and are likely to 
deliver results. However, when these criteria are used to set goals for 
innovation, they can spell failure. The dumb thing about S.M.A.R.T. goals is 
they thwart breakthrough innovations.</p> 
<p>Dustin&rsquo;s point, however, is about risk-taking. S.M.A.R.T. goals 
don&rsquo;t stretch your creativity, imagination and inventiveness beyond what 
is currently known or invented. The greatest successes are the result of the 
greatest risks.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Failure is the foundation of success, and the means by which it is 
achieved.&rdquo;<strong> </strong><em>Lao Tzu</em></p> </blockquote> 
<p>What if we set D.U.M.B. goals to solve worldwide problems like climate 
change, theGreat Pacific Garbage Patch or alternative energy sources? What 
would happen if we encouraged the kind of thinking where anything is possible?

<h3> Holiday&nbsp;Recycling December 29, 2008</h3>  Filed under: holidays 
&mdash; Verda Vivo @ 10:09 am<br>
 Tags: batteries, catalogs, charity, 
Christmas cards, Christmas Tree, conservation, holidays, Junk Mail, Recycle, 
recycling, waste management, wrapping paper <br>

<p>Why recycle during the holidays?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Americans throw away 25% more trash between Thanksgiving and New 
Year&rsquo;s than any other time of&nbsp; year &ndash;<strong>that&rsquo;s 5 
million additional tons of garbage</strong>.</li> 
<li>If every family in the U.S. reused just 2&nbsp; feet of holiday ribbon, the
<strong>38,000 miles </strong>of ribbon saved could tie a bow around the entire 
planet.</li> 
<li>The 2.65 billion Christmas cards sold each year in the U.S. could fill a 
football field 10 stories high. If we each sent one card less, we&rsquo;d save
<strong>50,000 cubic </strong><strong>yards of paper.</strong></li> </ul> 
<p>Wondering what to do with the Christmas Tree? Wrapping Paper? Batteries? 
Here are some resources and ideas to help.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Wrapping paper</strong> &ndash; Save and re-use what you can. 
Anything else can be put in the recycling bin. Remove bows and ribbon. Paper 
with glitter and foil type of paper should be re-used or thrown out.</li> 
<li><strong>Greeting cards</strong> &ndash; Reuse greeting cards as ornaments, 
bookmarks or gift tags. Most can be recycled, but to a point. If your greeting 
cards have any metallic or glitter material on the front, it cannot be 
recycled. Depending on where you live you can drop off greeting cards at your 
localFresh &amp; Easy Neighborhood Market until January 20, 2009 for recycling. 
Fresh &amp; Easy will donate the proceeds from the sale of the recycled cards to
American Forests, a non-profit organization that works to plant trees in 
restoration areas throughout the country and raise awareness about the benefits 
of trees and forests.</li> 
<li><strong>Christmas Tree</strong> &ndash; According to the National 
Christmas Tree Association, between 25 and 30 million &ldquo;fresh-cut&rdquo; 
Christmas trees are sold in the United States every year. Christmas tree 
recycling helps return a renewable resource back to the environment. Most trees 
can be cut down (usually to about 3&prime; segments) and placed in your yard 
waste bin. Check with your local waste management company. To find a Christmas 
Tree recycling event near you, click on Earth 911&prime;sGreen Your Holidays. 
Simply type Christmas Tree and your zip code in the search box to find a 
recycling event near you. Flocked and artificial trees cannot be recycled. If 
you bought a live Christmas tree, be sure to plant it. Or consider donating it 
a local school or nursing home to plant on their grounds.</li> 
<li><strong>Batteries </strong>- Visit Waste Management&rsquo;s Think Green 
from Home website where you can purchase a recycling kit for batteries. Or 
click on Earth 911&prime;sGreen Your Holidays. Type in batteries and your zip 
code in the Recycling section.</li> 
<li><strong>Pass it on</strong> &ndash; Has your child outgrown that toy from 
last year? Instead of throwing it away, or storing it on a garage shelf, donate 
the toy to your localSociety of St. Vincent de Paul, Salvation Army, Goodwill, 
The Arc,&nbsp;Savers or Value&nbsp;Village or Purple Heart.</li> 
<li><strong>Christmas catalogs</strong> &ndash; Avoid future deluges of 
catalogs. Contact Epsilon Data Services, an international company that 
maintains data bases used by mail order and catalog companies. Consumers can 
have their names removed by writing Epsilon Data Services, PO Box 1478, 
Broomfield, Colo., 80038 or by e-mailing their name and address to
abacusoptout@epsilon.com for U.S. or abacusoptout_ca@epsilon.com for Canada. 
For more information, click onAbacus Opt Out. I opted out last year and only 
received one Christmas catalog this year.</li> </ul>

<h3> Alternatives to&nbsp;Soda December 29, 2008</h3>  Filed under: food, 
health &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 3:10 am <br>
 Tags: coffee, flavored water, fruit 
juice, soda, tea, water <br>

<p>Losing weight on your list of resolutions this year?</p> 
<p>If you drink just one 12-ounce soft drink a day, you&rsquo;re consuming 
55,000 calories of the stuff in a year. Here are some healthy alternatives to 
soda:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Tea. </strong>The potential benefits of tea ranges from fighting 
cancer and promoting fat loss, to protecting against coronary artery disease 
and building bone. Brew green tea with thinly sliced ginger and lemon, or 
sprigs of spearmint. Try combining cooled green tea half and half with a fruit 
juice, such as peach, pineapple or papaya. Blend and pour over ice. Green tea 
is best but even regular black tea has health benefits and is much better for 
you than soda. If you&rsquo;re avoiding caffeine choose herbal or decaf teas.
</li> 
<li><strong>Coffee.</strong> Coffee has been credited for reducing the risk of 
everything from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease to colon cancer to headaches. Harvard 
researchers found that drinking around six cups of coffee a day can diminish 
the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 54 percent for men 
and 30 percent for women. Like tea, coffee imparts maximum benefits when you 
take it straight up.</li> 
<li><strong>Water.</strong> The human body is anywhere from 55% to 78% water 
depending on body size.&nbsp; To function properly, the body requires between 
one and sevenliters of water per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount 
depends on the level of activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors. 
Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking 
straight water. It is not clear how much water intake is needed by healthy 
people, though most advocates agree that 6&ndash;7 glasses of water 
(approximately 2 liters) daily is the minimum to maintain proper hydration. 
Replacing soda with water can help you slim down: In 2006, researchers for the 
Obesity Society examined weight-loss data and discovered that those who 
completely replaced sweetened drinks with water lost an additional five pounds 
a year.</li> 
<li><strong>Flavored water.</strong> Add slices of fruits or vegetables 
&mdash; lemons, oranges, watermelon, cucumber, mint, or limes &mdash; to a 
pitcher of ice-cold water for a refreshing and flavorful drink. Another option 
is to put chopped-up fruit in an ice cube tray, add water, and freeze. Place 
these colorful fruit cubes in your beverage for flavor and color.</li> 
<li><strong>Fruit juice.</strong> Juice is great, but many mass-produced 
brands have additives such as high fructose corn syrup that increase the 
calorie count (a large 16-ounce glass of orange juice contains about 240 
calories). Dilute fruit juice with plain or sparkling water. You can also make 
your own sugar-free juice or fruit-infused water.&nbsp; You can also choose 
fruits with a high water content, such as grapes, pineapples, watermelons, or 
oranges.</li> </ol>

<h3> DIY Foaming Hand&nbsp;Soap December 16, 2008</h3>  Filed under: green, 
home &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 6:00 am <br>
 Tags: Dr. Bronner's, foaming hand soap, 
hand soap, Method <br>

<p>Okay, this is one of those times when I could smack my head and say 
&ldquo;Doh!&rdquo; I saw thisFoaming Hand Soap Savings tip on Tip Hero.</p> 
<p>My spouse loves Method foaming hand soap. I love Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s liquid 
castile soap. Method doesn&rsquo;t sell foaming hand soap refills for their 
dispensers and I don&rsquo;t want to buy a new dispenser every time one runs 
out. Plus, while I love Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s soap, the dispenser I was using 
would clog just enough to squirt the soap onto my clothes instead of my hands. 
Usually when I was ready to walk out the door.</p> 
<p>I poured an inch of Dr. Bronner&rsquo;s liquid soap in the bottom of an 
empty Method foaming hand soap container, filled the rest with water and shook 
it gently to mix it. A couple of pumps later and it foamed up nicely.</p> 
<p>This would work with just about any clear liquid soap including dish 
detergent. Avoid creamy liquid soaps since they do not foam up. Do not fill the 
dispenser above the foaming mechanism as this will also cause clogging.<br>

,shopping <br>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m a fan of the philosophy &ldquo;buy less, live 
more&rdquo;, I live in the real world so have to shop to eat and clothe myself. 
When I do I always shop the sale rack. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I 
paid retail for clothing. I&rsquo;m not as diligent about clipping grocery 
coupons. Since I shop the perimeter of the grocery store, I don&rsquo;t find 
many coupons for fresh produce. Then, of course, there are the wish lists of 
folks on my gift-giving list. I try to support local artisan&rsquo;s when I can 
but when my sister wants new sheets and towels, it&rsquo;s time for a little 
online shopping.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Coupons.com &ndash; run by Coupons Inc., with more than 900 clients, 
including General Mills, Kraft Foods and Pillsbury.</li> 
<li>CoolSavings.com &ndash; run by Q Interactive, whose business partners 
range from Pillsbury and Hersey&rsquo;s to Best Buy and Wal Mart.</li> 
<li>ProBargainHunter.com ranks popular price comparison and coupon sites. 
You&rsquo;ll findPriceGrabber.com, RetailMeNot, and Ebates among others. The 
author has reviews on some sites which are helpful.</li> 
<li>A recent newspaper article highlighted a new one for me, bradsdeals.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>You can bet that the large brand names are shifting more dollars from 
traditional coupons in publications to Internet print coupons. With 38.6 
million Americans using on-line coupons this winter, coupon clicks are soaring.

<h3> The Dirty&nbsp;Dozen December 11, 2008</h3>  Filed under: food, green, 
health &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 5:43 pm <br>
 Tags: artificial colors, artificial 
sweeteners, high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, hydrolyzed soy protein,
milk, pork, raw milk, shellfish, soft drinks, white flour, white sugar <br>

<p>Jordan Rubin, author of&nbsp; &ldquo;Perfect Weight America&rdquo; lists 
the &ldquo;Dirty Dozen&rdquo; food items that we all should avoid for better 
health. He concedes that some might be controversial. While I have eliminated 
most of the foods on his list, there are some that surprised me, like skim milk.
</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>All Pork Products</strong> &ndash; Pigs are omnivores, which means 
that they consume both plants and animals. Pigs will scavenge and have been 
known to eat any kind of food, including dead insects, worms, tree bark, 
rotting carcasses, garbage, and even other pigs. Pigs harbor a range ofparasites
 and diseases that can be transmitted to humans. These include trichinosis,<em>
Taenia solium</em>, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host 
large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract.&nbsp; 
The presence of these diseases and parasites is one of the reasons why pork 
meat should always be well cooked or cured before eating. Religious groups that 
consider pork unclean refer to these issues as support for their views. Another 
reason not to eat pork is that factory hog farms are some of the worst 
polluters in America&rsquo;s history. SeeBoss Hog. While I&rsquo;m not a 
vegetarian, I&rsquo;ll think twice before buying any more pork.</li> 
<li><strong>Shellfish and crustaceans</strong> &ndash; Lobsters, crabs, 
shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, crayfish and scallops are bottom scavengers or 
filter feeders. When I lived in Oregon, we would go upriver to swim and catch 
crayfish. I never thought much about what crayfish eat until my sister&rsquo;s 
dog pooped in the water. The crayfish went crazy, coming out of their hiding 
places from all over, to devour the tasty goodness. No more crayfish for me, 
thanks. Even though I love shrimp, I don&rsquo;t eat much of it after 
researchingPoison Shrimp&nbsp;Cocktail. And oysters, clams or mussels in 
Arizona? Not so much.</li> 
<li><strong>Processed meats and hydrolyzed soy protein</strong> &ndash; 
Processed meats contain nitrates for flavor, color and as a preservative. Steer 
clear of breakfast links, hot dogs, Salisbury steaks, bologna, sausages, 
salami, and lunch meats of all kinds. Nitrates can turn into nitrites which 
have been found to cause cancer and tumors in test animals. Hydrolyzed soy 
protein usually contains a significant amount of genetically modified soy. 
According to theFDA, hydrolyzed protein is used to enhance flavor and contains 
monosodium glutamate. When added this way, the labels are not required to list 
MSG as an ingredient. Yum.</li> 
<li><strong>White flour</strong> &ndash; White flour is white because the 
wheat has been stripped of the wheat germ, bran, and half of the healthy fatty 
acids and then bleached. Enriched white flour just means that a few isolated 
and synthetic vitamins and minerals have been added back into the flour. Look 
for whole-grain breads or flour as a healthy alternative.</li> 
<li><strong>Hydrogenated oils</strong> &ndash; During the hydrogenation 
process, hydrogen gas in injected into oil under high pressure to make the oil 
solid at room temperature and prevent the oil from becoming rancid too quickly. 
The process produces trans fats. The consumption of trans fats increases 
one&rsquo;s risk ofcoronary heart disease by raising levels of 
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; LDL cholesterol and lowering levels of &ldquo;good&rdquo; HDL 
cholesterol. Health authorities recommend that consumption of trans fat be 
reduced to trace amounts. If the ingredient list contains the words 
&ldquo;shortening&rdquo;, &ldquo;partially hydrogenated vegetable oil&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;hydrogenated vegetable oil&rdquo;, then the food contains trans fat. 
Even if the label says &ldquo;zero trans fat&rdquo;, the FDA allows 
manufacturers to have less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving and still 
legally use the term &ldquo;zero trans fat&rdquo;. So much for truth in 
labeling.</li> 
<li><strong>Pasteurized, homogenized skim milk</strong> &ndash; This one 
surprised me. Instead of skim milk, Mr. Rubin recommends unpasteurized milk 
from grass-fed animals instead of homogenized, pasteurized milk. Since raw milk 
has risks based on the sanitary practices of the farm where it is produced, the 
next best thing is cultured or fermented dairy whole-milk products, such as 
yogurt and kefir. I&rsquo;ve often wondered why humans are the only species 
that drink the milk of another animal. That being said, I still have a nonfat 
latte every morning and love my cheese.</li> 
<li><strong>White sugar</strong> &ndash; Sugar&ndash;including sucrose, corn 
sweeteners, honey, and molasses&ndash;is, in a sense, the number-one food 
additive. The average American eats up to three pounds of sugar every week. Of 
course, few people actually go through that much actual table sugar, but it is 
found in almost all of the processed foods we eat. It turns up in some unlikely 
places, such as pizza, bread, hot dogs, boxed rice mixes, soup, crackers, 
spaghetti sauce, lunch meat, canned vegetables, fruit drinks, flavored yogurt, 
ketchup, salad dressing, mayonnaise, and some peanut butter. Carbonated soft 
drinks are the worst offenders in the American diet.</li> 
<li><strong>Soft drinks</strong> &ndash; Soft drink are empty calories with 
little or no nutritional value, considering most are made with high-fructose 
corn syrup. If you drink one can of soda per day, you will consume 55,000 extra 
calories in one year, or 15 pounds of weight gain. I find soft drinks too sweet 
for my taste. I&rsquo;d rather drink water.</li> 
<li><strong>High-fructose corn syrup</strong> &ndash; Manufacturers use HFCS 
because it&rsquo;s cheap. You&rsquo;ll find it in soda, fruit juice, baked 
goods, canned fruits, dairy products, cooks, gum, jam, jellies, 
pickles&hellip;you get the picture. The problem with HFCS is that the body 
handles fructose differently than all other sugars. Fructose does not stimulate 
leptin, the hormone that tell you &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full&rdquo;. In fat, it 
reduces ghrelin hormone levels, which tell you &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still 
hungry&rdquo;. Fructose propels the liver into fat-promoting mode by activating 
the formation of enymes that lead to elevated levels of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; 
cholesterol and triglycerides.</li> 
<li><strong>Artificial sweeteners</strong> &ndash; As many as 194 million 
Americans regularly eat and drink sugar-free products. Whether or not 
artificial sweeteners are &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for our health, why consume an 
artificial product when a natural one if available? Plus, if they worked, why 
are so many Americans fat? I weaned myself from my Diet Mountain Dew habit over 
a year ago and feel much better as a result.</li> 
<li><strong>Artificial flavors and artificial colors</strong> &ndash; Food 
additives have been linked to behavioral problems in children. They have also 
been associated with allergies and skin rashes. I dislike most prepared foods 
and normally shop the perimeter of the grocery store. I&rsquo;d rather eat my 
own cooking.</li> 
<li><strong>Beer, wine and alcoholic drinks</strong> &ndash; This one pains me 
since I do like my glass of wine in the evening. However, his book was written 
for folks who are trying to lose weight and alcohol in all its forms is highly 
caloric. Of course there&rsquo;s the problems associated with excessive 
drinking.</li> </ol> 
<p>All in all, I follow most of Mr. Rubin&rsquo;s recommendations. Combine 
that with daily exercise and I weigh within two pounds of my weight in high 
school. Never felt better.<br>

<h3> You Are What You&nbsp;Eat December 7, 2008</h3>  Filed under: food, health
 &mdash; Verda Vivo @ 9:42 pm<br>
 Tags: diet, greasy food, high fat food, 
nutrition <br>

<p>My husband and I went out to eat for breakfast today. He had a mushroom, 
olive and onion omelet. I had a Philly Cheesesteak, pretty unusual for me. 
Normally I would have had a salad but the place we went to looked like all they 
might have is iceberg lettuce.</p> 
<p>I usually don&rsquo;t eat breakfast because I&rsquo;m not hungry at 6 am 
when I get up. In fact I usually don&rsquo;t eat anything until about lunch. 
Well, except for the triple shot latte my husband makes. Sorry, nutrition 
folks, I only eat when I&rsquo;m hungry. Plus I usually play tennis first thing 
in the morning and doing that on a full stomach is not my idea of fun. Caffeine 
yes, full stomach no.</p> 
<p>Now my normal lunch fare is an apple and a chunk of cheese, maybe some 
bread if I&rsquo;m really hungry. So the Philly Cheesesteak was a huge 
departure and a big mistake. It tasted great going down. Umm, all that grease, 
cheese and meat. By the time I was done my stomach was churning. All afternoon 
I could feel the knot in my stomach. Now, mind you I&rsquo;ve had Philly 
Cheesesteaks before that tasted great and didn&rsquo;t make my stomach hurt. 
This one, though, tortured my stomach from the inside. Plus all I wanted to do 
was lie down and take a nap. Ugh!</p> 
<p>Why did this happen?</p> 
<p>Foods high in fat like fried foods, cheeses, and dishes prepared with lots 
of butter prompt your digestive system to produce higher levels of stomach 
acids and enzymes in order break them down. Your small intestine releases 
bicarbonate to neutralize these acids and enzymes, in effect limiting their 
territory in the digestive system to the stomach, where they are most needed. 
The bicarbonate turns into carbon dioxide, some of which is released as gas.</p>
<p>Oh, something to look forward to&hellip;<br>

<h3> Best Way to Wash Your&nbsp;Produce December 1, 2008</h3>  Filed under:

pesticides, veggie spray, veggie wash <br>

<p>There are three reasons why you should wash your produce: sand and/or grit 
from the field; residual pesticides and bacteria. Remember the2006 E. coli 
outbreak from fresh spinach?</p> 
<p>Begin preparing produce with clean hands. Wash hands for 20 seconds with 
warm water and soap before and after preparing fresh produce. TheFood and Drug 
Administration recommends washing fruits and vegetables under running water 
just before eating, cutting or cooking. You should even wash produce that will 
be peeled before eating. The FDA advises against washing fruits and vegetables 
with soap or detergent or using commercial produce washes. Drying produce with 
a clean towel may further reduce bacteria that may be present. Although you can 
use pre-washed, bagged produce without further washing, as an extra measure of 
caution, you can wash the produce again just before you use it. Using separate 
cutting boards for meat and vegetables decreases the chance of 
cross-contamination.</p> 
<p>To reduce your exposure to pesticides, choose organic options for Dirty 
Dozen, the 12 fruits and vegetables with the highest pesticide load. Get your 
own pocket guide from theEnvironmental Working Group. Organic means that crops 
are generally grown without synthetic pesticides, artificial fertilizers, 
irradiation (a form of radiation used to kill bacteria), or biotechnology.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you feel the need to use a veggie spray, make your own. Most of the 
commercial ones are primarily vinegar anyway so why pay more?</p> 
<p><strong>Veggie Cleaner Spray</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 cup water</li> 
<li>1 cup distilled white vinegar</li> 
<li>1 tablespoon baking soda</li> 
<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li> </ul> 
<p>Combine all ingredients in a large container &ndash; the baking soda will 
make the solution foam up. Then, transfer to a spray bottle with a pump. Spray 
mixture on produce, and rinse thoroughly after 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
