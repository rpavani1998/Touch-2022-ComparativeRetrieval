<p>Enter any convenience store in the United States and you&rsquo;ll quickly 
spot an array of wrapped and bottled items masquerading as food.</p> 
<p>And these junky snack foods are becoming more horrible every year.&nbsp; 
And while there are hundreds I could rail against, 10 are particularly 
offensive.&nbsp; I call them the &ldquo;worst snack foods of all time.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>But be forewarned: This list could become outdated the minute the food 
industry introduces yet another must-have concoction that adds pounds to your 
waistline while stealing your health.</p> 
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; French Fries</strong></p> 
<p>Who among us hasn&rsquo;t been lured in by French fries, or even more 
specifically, by McDonald&rsquo;s French fries?&nbsp; We seem to play ostrich 
and stick our heads in the sand though when it comes to the lack of any 
redeeming qualities about French fries.</p> 
<p>These golden sticks are nothing more than starchy white potatoes cooked in 
hot fat and flavored with chemicals, salt, and sugar.&nbsp; Yep, sugar.&nbsp; 
On potatoes.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t forget the chemicals.</p> 
<p>In the case of McDonald&rsquo;s, their French fries&rsquo; ingredients 
include: potatoes, vegetable oil (in the fries&hellip;in addition to what they 
are cooked in!), citric acid, dextrose, sodium acid pyrophosphate, and 
salt.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t forget the dimethylpolysiloxane, which is added as 
an anti-foaming agent.&nbsp; Yum!</p> 
<p>Quite possibly the worst snack food on the planet.</p> 
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Donuts</strong></p> 
<p>Remember when we used to spell donuts &ldquo;<em>dough</em>nuts?&rdquo; Now 
<em>that</em> was truth in advertising.&nbsp; After all, donuts are nothing 
more than sugary fried bread.</p> 
<p>Yep, take some good, old, nutrition-free bleached white dough, add a crap 
load of sugar, and deep fry it.&nbsp; And, if you want to get really inventive 
and up thestroke factor, squirt in a sugary, creamy or jelly filling and top 
with glaze or powdered sugar.</p> 
<p>And if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, add a sugary cream filling and a glaze 
of more sugar on top.&nbsp; Any questions?</p> 
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Chips (Potato or Corn)</strong></p> 
<p>These are really just a packaged version of French fries.&nbsp; Maybe with 
fewer ingredients, depending on the brand you buy.</p> 
<p>However, you <em>can</em> do damage control on this one by switching to 
baked blue corn chips, available in most health food stores or organic grocery 
stores.&nbsp; While it&rsquo;s still not real food, it beats the 7-Eleven 
version.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that corn chips, like potato chips, are still 
salty and starchy&hellip;not a great combo for your waistline or your health, 
so take it easy.</p> 
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Soda</strong></p> 
<p>Whether we discuss the caffeine, the sugar, the high fructose corn syrup, 
the carbonation, the caramel coloring, or the addictive traits, there is 
absolutely nothing good coming out of these bottles and cans.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no redeeming health value of any kind&hellip;just 
a whole lot of chemicals.</p> 
<p>And, yes, this does include the <em>diet </em>kind.&nbsp; All the same 
issues, but now throw in those harmful artificial sweeteners.&nbsp; Plus, the 
rumor that diet soda can stallweight loss just might be true.</p> 
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Cupcakes and Snack Cakes</strong></p> 
<p>You won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;Little Debbie&rdquo; for very long eating this 
crap.&nbsp; Regardless of brand, you&rsquo;re looking at a bit of flour, a ton 
of sugar, some chemicals, and maybe a flavoring or two.</p> 
<p>As for that creamy filling?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding.&nbsp; To 
say its fake whipped cream is an understatement.&nbsp; Be a real Hostess and 
skip the trip down this aisle.</p> 
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; Candy Bars</strong></p> 
<p>Where do I even start?&nbsp; About the only possible redeeming factor about 
some candy bars are the gram or two of protein from the nuts&hellip;and most 
don&rsquo;t even offer this sad attempt at decency.</p> 
<p>And, by the way, those &ldquo;energy&rdquo; or &ldquo;protein&rdquo; 
bars?&nbsp; Candy bars with fancy labeling and a bit of enhancement.&nbsp; 
Sure, they often have 1/3 fewer calories, quite a bit more protein, and a bit 
less fat, but don&rsquo;t get it twisted.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re still a far cry 
from real food.</p> 
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; Pork Rinds</strong></p> 
<p>Where do I start with this preferred and often-recommended snack of the 
low-carb crowd?&nbsp; When you head to the label, the plain variety has just 
two ingredients: pork rinds and salt.&nbsp; But what<em>are</em> pork rinds?</p>
<p>You know how the tough outer layer or peel of an orange or lemon is called 
the rind?&nbsp; Ah, yea.&nbsp; No difference.&nbsp; Pork rinds are the tough, 
outer skin layer of pigs.</p> 
<p>And, as if that weren&rsquo;t awful enough, these rinds are coated with 
salt and put in a dehydrator for hours.&nbsp; They are then cut into little 
pellets.</p> 
<p>Not disgusted yet?&nbsp; Keep reading.</p> 
<p>These pellets are dropped into vats of cooking oil for about 60 
seconds.&nbsp; And voila!&nbsp; You have puffy, Styrofoam-like snacks.</p> 
<p>So, basically we&rsquo;re talking about deep-fried pork skin.&nbsp; Not a 
good thing!</p> 
<p><strong>8.&nbsp; Fat-Free Cookies</strong></p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t be thrown off by the &ldquo;fat-free&rdquo; part.&nbsp; Forget 
that most fat-free anything replaces the fat with sugar&hellip;these are still
<em>cookies</em>!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re just sneaking around trying to pretend to 
be healthy.</p> 
<p>Remember, fat-free doesn&rsquo;t equal calorie free, or sugar-free for that 
matter.&nbsp; So &ldquo;snack well&rdquo; and just say no.</p> 
<p><strong>9.&nbsp; Crackers</strong></p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;you have your enriched flour, salt, and 
trans-fats.&nbsp; Lots and lots of trans-fats in fact.&nbsp; Most top cracker 
brands are loaded with &lsquo;em.</p> 
<p>So be sure to read your labels carefully to find the few that 
aren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll want to look for things like hydrogenated oil 
or partially hydrogenated oil.</p> 
<p>One way to avoid the trans-fat trap is to choose organic&hellip;and whole 
grain while you&rsquo;re at it.</p> 
<p><strong>10.&nbsp; Pretzels</strong></p> 
<p>Surprise, surprise.&nbsp; Just because something doesn&rsquo;t have fat 
doesn&rsquo;t make it good.&nbsp; This twisted mess of white flour, water, 
sugar, and salt isjunk food in disguise.&nbsp; Fuggedaboutit.</p> 
<p><strong>Runner Up: Coffee Drinks</strong></p> 
<p>Creamy, carmelly, coconutty coffee mocha-latt&eacute;-frapp&eacute; drinks 
are taking over the universe&hellip;and our waistlines!&nbsp; Yet we seem to 
think that the calories we drink don&rsquo;t count.&nbsp; They do&hellip;just 
ask your scale.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; I love my Starbucks too, but even a 
grande (16 ounce) basic vanilla Frappaccino has 410 calories, 16 grams of fat, 
62 grams of sugar, and 95 milligrams of caffeine.</p> 
<p>Oh, and one gram of fiber&hellip;hurrah.</p> 
<p><strong>Whole is the Way to Go&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>At the end of the day, there are no short cuts when it comes to 
health.&nbsp; If it comes in a bag, box, or wrapper, it&rsquo;s likely not 
going to pass the health test.&nbsp; Ditto for anything you can pick up at the 
drive-through and with whipped topping.</p> 
<p>Stick to whole, real foods and you&rsquo;ll be a whole lot 
healthier&hellip;and happier and skinnier to boot!</p> <br>

<p>As to &lsquo;candy bars&rsquo; &ndash; please do not lump them all in one 
garbage bag. Some chocolate bars &ndash; made of real dark cocoa beans are 
actually healthy &ndash; eaten a bit a time, of course.</p> </li> 
<li> Jason <br>

<p>I would make one exception to your inclusion of candy bars.&nbsp; I eat 
organic dark chocolate bars (over 70% cacao), and one bar will last four 
days.&nbsp; These are high in antioxidants, and healthy when eaten in 
moderation.</p> </li> 
<li> Dianepriestley <br>

<p>This is an excellent article, really a wake-up call, especially because my 
favourite snack foods are potato crisps, corn chips and crackers&hellip;oh 
dear, loaded with trans fats. How depressing! But good to know, so I can stop! 
Thank you.</p> </li>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this pretty much common sense.&nbsp; I have been guilty in the 
past, but have repented for the most part.&nbsp; Candy bars still want to jump 
in my cart, but just not as often.</p> </li> 
<li> mama <br>

<p>All common sense. If we could cut this garbage out of society we 
wouldn&rsquo;t have all these health issues. The people who produce this 
garbage are best friends with the pharmacutical companies. And then there are 
those who can&rsquo;t so NO to their children and let them eat this junk.</p>

<li> Nancy <br>

<p>Great article. I agree with all of it. Still, I have been guilty.&nbsp;I am 
changing my habits. I think we&rsquo;d all find that we really wouldn&rsquo;t 
miss these&nbsp;&rdquo;foods&rdquo; as much as we&nbsp;might expect. It&rsquo;s 
just a matter of making the decision and then finding new&nbsp;enjoyment in 
healthier foods.&nbsp; I gave up soda in 2004 when I was diagnosed with acid 
reflux.&nbsp;For the most part I haven&rsquo;t missed it. I&rsquo;m angry with 
the FDA and&nbsp;food&nbsp;industry. The FDA doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;care in the 
least about our health. What about the hormones, etc. in milk and dairy 
products, pesticides in fruits and vegetables, the way baby carrots are 
processed. I could go on and on.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a 
challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li> Fran <br>

<p>What is wrong with carbonation?&nbsp; I know high fructose syrup is bad, 
but carbonation?&nbsp; I like the fizz and was thinking carbonated water with a 
twist of lemon is a good thing&hellip;</p> </li> 
<li> Elizabeth Bird <br>

<p>I gave up Snickers, my once-in-a-while treat, after receiving notice 
regarding the various companies that use &ldquo;milk-like&rdquo; ingredients 
from China.&nbsp; Snickers, Starbucks, yup, Starbucks, Nestles, and a host of 
others. The safest thing I do is eat my own home-grown organic sprouts, 
sprouted using clean water.&nbsp; Everything else has a question mark in my 
mind.</p> </li> 
<li> Drkathleenn <br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know who said it, but here are often repeated words of wisdom 
that I have done my very best to follow for the past&nbsp;40 years:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Shop the periphery of the store&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where you find 
wholesome foods such as fresh&nbsp;produce, dairy, eggs, 
&nbsp;(organic&nbsp;only for us) whole grain breads, etc.&nbsp;and 
meats/fish/poultry (organic only for us).&nbsp;&rdquo;Don&rsquo;t shop the 
inner isles&rdquo; which is&nbsp;where the packaged, canned, boxed, or frozen 
garbage is located.&nbsp; As for fast foods, YUK!. Coupled with toxic, chemical 
loaded, processed meats, chicken parts from the left overs refuse&nbsp;in 
meat/poultry processing plants, you have the stuff fried in canola oil which 
comes from rapeseed which is extremely toxic.&nbsp; (There are 3 kinds of 
chemicals in McDonald&rsquo;s chicken mcnuggets that are harmful to people, 
especially children).&nbsp;There are&nbsp;lots of articles online, like this, 
it is up to you to do the research.&nbsp; If you are a busy person with little 
time to cook, prepare ahead like so many of the TV chefs on Food Network teach 
you, and then freeze the foods and reheat later. NOT in a microwave!.&nbsp; On 
nights you are too worn out to cook,&nbsp;there is always salads with slices of 
chicken, beef, seafood or tuna with a dash of homemade salad dressing, sliced 
cooked eggs, and all sorts of amazing veggies. Fresh fruit is delectable and a 
wonderful replacement for sugary junk in boxes, bags and so forth. Recipes 
sites also offer an enormus amount of inspiration.&nbsp; It takes time, but the 
health benefits are so incredibly worth it.</p> </li> 
<li> Betty Duke <br>

<p>Praise thr Lord for your article.&nbsp; It made me realize that all that 
junk food is not good for us.&nbsp; I looked in my cabinet and found that the 
crackers were totally not good for us as a family and we were eating them like 
crazy and pretzels too. that stuff is going out of our house permanatly. I 
would like for my family and myself. to have a healthy lifestyle. we&rsquo;re 
starting with the junk food and french fries.</p> </li> 
<li> PigSkinLover <br>

<p>Why would you say that pork skin is bad and &ldquo;awful&rdquo;?&nbsp;<br>
 
Just because your culture raised you like that?<br>
 Do you realize that many 
cultures LOVE pig skin in all its shapes? You make them feel bad?<br>
 Shame on 
you.<br>
 Instead, tell us exactly what (except for the salt) make it an 
unhealthy&nbsp;food.<br>
 What&rsquo;s wrong with dehidrated stuff?<br>
 
What&rsquo;s wrong with vats of oil, if little is left on the food, and 
(unlikely) but it could be olive oil&hellip; or any trans-fat-free oil.</p>

<p>Just be sure to watch the sugar per serving. And congrats on your 
restraint. Many (if not most) people cannot make one bar last four days.</p>

<p>Moishe,</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;a bit at a time&rdquo; is the key. For many (if not most) 
people, that&rsquo;s not realistic. And many dark chocolate bars are still 
loaded with sugar. If it has more than 9 grams per serving, you&rsquo;re doing 
more harm than good. (And keep in mind that most bars have more than one 
serving in them&hellip;so read the label carefully.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;i read this article after eating some pork rinds which i thought was 
a better alternative to pretzels or potato chips so you can imagine how i 
felt.&nbsp; But i don&rsquo;t eat the snacks listed&nbsp; on a daily basis, 
just on my cheat day</p> </li> 
<li> Norsewarriorking <br>

<p>&nbsp;Hmm, I&nbsp; agree, especially with number 7. Making pork rinds is a 
waste, the skin is better left on the animal and roasted.</p> </li> 
<li> Lizzbird1 <br>

<p>RE Drkathleenn&rsquo;s excellent response:&nbsp; More &amp; more canola oil 
is being used, even in health food store products. Years ago,&nbsp; I had heard 
about rapeseed not being a good choice.&nbsp; Has everyone forgotten?</p> </li> 
<li> baconman <br>

<p>so i can still eat bacon . . . thank God for creating pigs</p> </li> 
<li> Porkrindadditct <br>

<p>I linked over from mens health on line where they say pork rinds are ok 
compared to other things&hellip;get your stories straight people.</p> </li> 
<li>  http://naturalhealthsherpa.com Natural Health Sherpa <br>

<p>The key is &ldquo;compared to other things.&rdquo; </p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p> 
<p>The Sherpa</p> </li> 
<li>  http://naturalhealthsherpa.com Natural Health Sherpa <br>

<p>No junk food is your best bet. Trading one product for another is 
irrelevant. Junk food is junk food. You are better off with fruits, veggies, or 
even an organic hard-boiled egg as a snack.</p>

<p>Lizzbird &ndash; I would like to get into sprouts. Can you give me some 
advice?&nbsp;<br>
 I always love the shots of wheatgrass from the health food 
store in Westport CThttp://wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/westport/I always 
thought i should sprout my own. &ndash; jeff</p> </li> 
<li>  http://pulse.yahoo.com/_4HZNA4HVX5SUBGUH6MZLNMICXQ Lady O <br>

<p>Nope, no canola.&nbsp;No corn oil, no soybean oil, no peanut oil.<br>
 
&nbsp;I use olive oil and coconut oil.&nbsp; Both are excellent for everything, 
from cooking to skin care.</p> </li> 
<li> Bouncedancer <br>

<p>The day after I eat pork rinds, I am puffy around the eyes.&nbsp; That 
stuff is toxic.</p> </li> 
<li> nancy <br>

<p>you have to show us what to eat- instead? &nbsp;no one knows, when you just 
say&nbsp;<br>
 stick to whole foods ? &nbsp;is it only veggies and fruits?? 
what else is there??<br>
 help!!!</p> </li> 
<li> Jp <br>

<p>I absolutely love pretzels and make sure I eat them in small portions. I 
have never had a problem overeating them or eating them mindlessely becaus 
i&nbsp;am not real keen on salt.</p> </li>

know, eat celery with almond butter on it.</p> </li>

<p>Marjorie,</p> 
<p>Instead of focusing on what you CANNOT have, focus on what you CAN! Fresh 
fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, proteins, amazing herbal teas, green tea.
</p> 
<p>How about an amazing breakfast of scrambled eggs with onions, peppers, 
broccoli, and mushrooms topped with creamy avocado. Pair it with a steaming cup 
of chai tea and coconut milk and you have heaven on earth!</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p>

<p>As far as pretzels go, I love the Snyders Nibblers. Snyders of Hanover use 
whole wheat flour and there is less then 2 grams of sugar for approximately 16 
nibblers.&nbsp; Sometimes you just have to have a crunchy carb and this 
&lsquo;organic&rsquo; version goes really well with a low fat string cheese.</p>

<p>Love Johnny and his no nonsense approach to telling the truth of what it is 
that is making our country so fat and unhealthy.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s right on the 
money!</p> </li> 
<li> Euridice <br>

<p>thank you for open our eyes to the obesity style life.</p> </li> 
<li> Bruce <br>

<p>Coffee is OK, just drink regular with a dash of milk or sugar if you have 
to. Also, a Starbucks grande should read 95 milligrams of caffeine, not 95 
grams.</p> </li>

<p>Up to a couple of years ago, I was pigging out on the crap listed above and 
more.&nbsp; Then the other shoe fell:&nbsp;&nbsp;My good doctor told me that I 
was a diabetic; you talk about a shake-up of your life.&nbsp; These things went 
where they belong; in the trash.&nbsp; I was exercising at the time, but these 
bad &ldquo;snacks&rdquo; were taking control.&nbsp; I have since lost about 70 
pounds and are on the way to re-taking my health.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad that you 
made a list for people to see and read, because they are nothing but bad.</p>

DON&rsquo;T NEED ANY SWEETENER OF ANY KIND !!!</p> </li>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; thanks to diabetes (Type 1.5 &ndash; 
autoimmune/beta cell destruction of T1, insulin resistance of T2), gout, 
chronic kidney disease (stage 4), and several other diagnosis&rsquo;, I 
can&rsquo;t have many fruits, or nuts, have to watch my protein intake, limit 
salt, caffine, diary&hellip;&nbsp; please PLEASE tell me what you suggest I 
eat?&nbsp; I am getting sooo tired of salad every day twice a day and 
water/sugar-free drink mixes.&nbsp; Suggestions, please!????</p> </li> 
<li> Egroups <br>

<p>Todays canola is almost guaranteed to be GMO since Monsanto&rsquo;s seeds 
have poluted the seed supply.</p>

<p>THis is just another reminder of what NOT to eat&hellip;in case you are 
tempted!</p> </li> 
<li> Doug L Bullock <br>

<p>You might be disgusted by the idea of eating pig skin, but they are the 
healthiest snack food on the market.&nbsp; they are PURE SATURATED FAT.&nbsp; 
Of course if you still believe the 60 year old LIE that saturated fat is bad 
for you then you will think I am nuts.&nbsp; If your body doesn&rsquo;t get 
enough saturated fat your cell walls get misshapen and weak and may 
rupture.&nbsp; Saturated fat makes you feel full longer thus helping your 
control weight.&nbsp; Pork skins, chicharones or whatever you call them are the 
healthiest snack food.&nbsp; no white flour, no fructose, no chemicals, just 
good food</p> </li> 
<li>  http://www.facebook.com/people/Allen-Unruh/834098484 Allen Unruh <br>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t pronounce what&rsquo;s in it,&nbsp; don&rsquo;t eat 
it.&nbsp; the rats that ate the box lived twice as long as the ones that ate 
the cereal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Life only comes from life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat foods with 
live enzymes,&nbsp; vitamins and minerals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our habits are threads 
we weave every day.&nbsp; they&rsquo;re too weak to be felt until they&rsquo;re 
too strong to be broken.&nbsp;&nbsp; Choices have consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
</li> 
<li> Lrupert2001 <br>

<p>Pork is the most unclean meat possiple. They are what they eat and they eat 
their own poop and other garbage. Think about it and you&rsquo;ll really be 
disgusted. There are much healthier ways to get your needed fat. Try red meat 
or butter or best of all virgin coconut oil.</p> </li> 
<li> Maelle <br>

<p>veg and lean meat like any healthy person.</p> </li> 
<li> JoAnn <br>

<p>It&nbsp;is so good to have someone who tells us the facts. keep up the good 
work.&nbsp; JoAnn</p> </li> 
<li> Miracana <br>

<p>lean meat from forage fed cattle is actually good for you</p> </li> 
<li> Mike <br>

<p>I raised pigs for several years and never once saw them eat poop.&nbsp; 
Admitedly, they usually were range-run and had plenty of grass to eat.&nbsp; 
But even at night in their large pen they ate no rubbish.&nbsp; And pigs always 
select a special&nbsp;&nbsp;area in their pens as a toilet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Managed 
well they are clean, friendly&nbsp;and intelligent.</p> </li> 
<li> Mike <br>

<p>Even with natural products it&rsquo;s important to check the 
source.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was it grown/&nbsp; How was it grown?&nbsp; Does it 
have any GMO ingredients?&nbsp; I know this is hard and many retailers 
can&rsquo;t answer the questions, but find good sources if you can.&nbsp; Most 
suppliers of supplements, for example, should be able to give you where the 
ingredients were sourced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can, follow the rule &ndash; 
&ldquo;If in doubt, leave it out.&rdquo;</p> </li> 
<li> Mike <br>

<p>I agree with Jason.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve weaned myself off most sugar but enjoy 
the occasional dark chocolate.&nbsp; And it lasts me for several 
days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to it as a health supplement (along with 
the glass or two of red wine!) as it raises my serotonin levels!</p> </li> 
<li> Miracana <br>

<p>Forage fed beef, free run chickens, Bison(Buffalo) meat</p> </li> 
<li> Miracana <br>

<p>I grew up on a mixed farm and never ever saw a pig eat anything other than 
god wholesome food Grain, forage and they always knew when the food came. One 
thing they do is wallow in mud to protect themselves from the sun.</p> </li> 
<li> Mike <br>

<p>Bacon is basically smoked pork, but it&rsquo;s the chemicals that are now 
put into it that are the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home-made honey-cured 
bacon is great &ndash; if you can get it.</p> </li> 
<li> Mike <br>

<p>I agree. Or try with mixed herbs and sea salt sprinkled on before you bake 
them in a little oil.</p> 
<p>Yummy!</p> </li>

<p>I love this article and I am right with you 100%.&nbsp; I am 72 and have 
been fighting the non food battle first with my kids, then my grandkids and all 
the young Navy personnel I care about.&nbsp; Real food does not sit on grocery 
shelves for years.&nbsp; there is no real food at any of the fast food 
joints.&nbsp; You can be assured this article will be forwarded to all those 
people I love.&nbsp;</p> </li>

<p>While the skin itself may be fine, the oil certainly is not. Healthier junk 
food is still junk food and is best avoided. Better options include fruits, 
nuts, seeds, veggies, etc.</p>

<p>We still say nix the sugar. If you must have a sweetener, stevia is your 
best bet. They even make flavored varieties. And you are correct about the 95

<p>Laura,</p> 
<p>Wheat and dairy are two of the most addictive foods, after sugar. Your 
&ldquo;snack&rdquo; is setting you up, as you likely unknowingly let on by your 
&ldquo;have to have&rdquo; statement.</p> 
<p>Try substituting celery or carrots for the pretzels if you need the 
&ldquo;crunch.&rdquo; And if you are looking for a creamy, healthy fat, dip the 
veggies in homemade guacamole. Simply mash half an avocado and blend with 
chopped tomatoes. Delicious!</p> 
<p>Naturally yours,</p>

<p>This is an eye-opener for someone like me who eats packaged foods. My 
friends around me do it too &amp; I&rsquo;m afraid they will become overweight. 
I&rsquo;m the worst of the pack &amp; I never realized how bad this was until 
doing research tonight, &amp; came across this site. I must improve myself.

<p>Three months ago I was blood-tested which showed I have many food 
sensitivities (not allergies). These sensitivities, little did I know, was the 
cause of my headaches, migraines 4x a month, fibromyalgia, depression 
(preventing my anti-dep meds from doing its job), adult acne, kidney problems, 
fatigue and other minor issues. My doctor detoxed me (5-wk step process). I 
started to eliminate all the problem foods, such as: all grains, (except for 
brown rice, arrowroot, and sparingly&ndash;oats), sugar &amp; sugar substitutes 
(can only have Stevia &amp; agave nectar), all diet drinks, melons (high 
glycemic), pre-pkgd/processed foods (some I can depending on what is on the 
label), &nbsp;chocolate (can have carob), corn or corn products, xantham gum, 
coffee, white potato, milk &amp; milk products. &nbsp;As a result, I am feeling 
80% better and have dropped 26 lbs. and still counting. It&rsquo;s been a 
challenge, especially finding a bread recipe. I still need to lose another 35 
lbs. but feel confident I&rsquo;ll get there. &nbsp;SO, I AGREE WITH YOUR 
ARTICLE 100%.&nbsp;</p> </li>

<p><strong>Gems form the internet&hellip;</strong></p> 
<p>[...]very few websites that happen to be detailed below, from our point of 
view are undoubtedly well worth checking out[...]&hellip;&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>Sorry, but on the Paleo diet &ndash; that is taking the REAL world by storm 
&ndash; we eat pork rinds as one of our only snacks.&nbsp; That or beef jerky 
or pemmican.&nbsp; People desperately need more fat!&nbsp; Of course, the pork 
rinds should be deep fried in lard and NOT vegetable oils which are 
deadly.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li> Gildeng <br>

<p>Miracana and Mike are correct.&nbsp; Range raised pigs are very clean and 
healthy possessing the correct proportion between omega 3 and omega 6. Pigs 
raised in very clean battery cages and feed concentrates have an unhealthy 
saturated fats causing inflammation due to high levels of omega 6. The skin 
rind should be cooked using plain coconut oil, not hydrogenated coconut oil or 
other highly processed oils, such as corn oil, canola oil, etc.&nbsp; Of 
course, we should always consider moderation in everything.</p> </li> 
<li> Bunhed <br>

<p>Now how about a list of the BEST Snack foods. What should I eat instead of 
these bad snacks.&nbsp;</p> </li> 
<li> Joyce <br>

<p>&nbsp;Our society has come so far from &lsquo;natural&rsquo; living. I grew 
up with the average American Diet. Chili, hamburgers, cheese sandwiches, white 
bread, etc. At 19, after many years of being sick all the time, my sister 
married a chiropractor. (a who?) being sick when I visited I was given his 
adjustment. Amazing experience. I felt a heat course through my body, I went 
home and slept36 hours and was completely cured! No fever, no cough, 
better!&nbsp; I knew then there were other ways to get better than horrid pills 
that always made me feel worse.He taught me about nutrition and I changed my 
way of eating.<br>
 When married I made my kids baby food, breast fed, read 
labels, made everything, whole grains etc. For about 30 years I went to a Dr. 
perhaps 3 times, once being a sprained ankle. I saw the results of sound 
nutrition in my life and while other children were always sick mine were not. A 
few times yes, but honey, tea and lemon, bed rest, no dairy and they improved.
<br> The above article mentions foods I never ate nor my kids. One as an adult 
went off my food ways for many years. Boy, has he paid a price. Diabetes 2, 
over weight, and other issues. A new lady in his life has pulled him around and 
in 2 years has slimmed down, looks better, but 20 years of eating what one 
craves and a period of alcohol will take a few more years to repair the 
damages.It horrifies me to see what people eat.<br>
 Food IS one&rsquo;s best 
medicine. Eat only what is as close to natural as possible. Eat less.It&rsquo;s 
the greasy fried suff, the overload of sugar, the lack of COLOR in your diet, 
the preservatives, the worst culprits. We are all biochemically different. An 
excellent read is James D&rsquo;Adamo&rsquo;s book, 4 Blood Types, 4 Diets. A 
good place to start.&nbsp; Nothing written in stone but the search and journey 
to build a healthy body and mind rewarding.I am 75, no pills,&nbsp; blood work 
good, but&nbsp; some spine and neck issues. Many ups and downs as everyone, to 
have solid, healthy body and mind is needed to deal with&nbsp; what we all have 
to in today&rsquo;s world. Health IS wealth, without it nothing can be enjoyed.
<br> Here is a brief poem I have shared with my clients and students.( a course 
I developed for Adult Ed classes after my own recovery and learning.)</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s many a man in this land,<br>
 Who thinks he&rsquo;s 
wonderfully wise.<br>
 He spends his health in gaining wealth<br>
 until he 
nearly dies.</p> 
<p>And then with all his might and main,<br>
 He spends his wealth<br>
 In 
gaining health,<br>
 And starts all over a-gain.</p> </li>

<p>Nuts, fruits, seeds, veggies even honey and peanut butter (natural). 
&nbsp;Toast some pumpkin seeds in olive oil. &nbsp;Raw is better, of course. 
&nbsp;Sardines in olive oil or water</p> </li> 
<li> Pedelibero <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m really upset by this artcle. I think I&rsquo;m going to have to 
seek comfort with a bag of fries and a coke.</p> </li>

<p>Pigs are the cleanest and most intelligent animals. &nbsp;A health 
department official once told me that it was pork from diseased countries that 
was an issue. &nbsp;Pigs are too smart to eat their own poop. &nbsp;I never had 
a pig eat it&rsquo;s own feces.</p> </li>

<p>I was raised in an Eastern European family, my mother made a dish that 
included pig&rsquo;s feet (for the gelatin). After she&rsquo;d boiled the dish, 
she removed the feet, scraped off the skin and added it to the dish with the 
rest of the pork. I loved the pork skin then (it was boiled, not fried), and 
don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with eating it. Do you eat chicken skin? 
What&rsquo;s the difference?&nbsp;</p> </li>
