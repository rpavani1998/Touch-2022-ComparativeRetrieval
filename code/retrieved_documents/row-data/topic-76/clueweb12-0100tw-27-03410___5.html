Tips for getting 
less added sugar</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Naturally occurring sugars and added sugars<br>
</strong>There are 
two types of sugars in American diets: naturally occurring sugars and added 
sugars.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Naturally occurring sugars are found <em>naturally</em> in foods such as 
fruit (fructose) and milk (lactose).</li> 
<li>Added sugars include <em>any</em> sugars or caloric sweeteners that are 
<em>added</em> to foods or beverages during processing or preparation (such as 
putting sugar in your coffee or adding sugar to your cereal). Added sugars (or 
added sweeteners) can include natural sugars such as white sugar, brown sugar 
and honey as well as other caloric sweeteners that are chemically manufactured 
(such as high fructose corn syrup).</li> </ul> 
<p>You can use sugars to help enhance your diet. Adding a <strong>limited
</strong> amount of sugar to improve the taste of foods (especially for 
children) that provide important nutrients, such as whole-grain cereal, low-fat 
milk or yogurt, is better than eating nutrient-poor, highly sweetened foods.</p>
<p>Back to top</p> 
<p><strong>Sources of added sugars<br>
</strong>The major sources of added 
sugars in American diets are regular soft drinks, sugars, candy, cakes, 
cookies, pies and fruit drinks (fruitades and fruit punch); dairy desserts and 
milk products (ice cream, sweetened yogurt and sweetened milk); and other 
grains (cinnamon toast and honey-nut waffles).</p> 
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified some common foods with 
added sugars. The table below lists a few examples and the number of calories 
from added sugars they contain. Note the calories here are only from<em>added 
sugars</em> in the food, not the total amount of calories in the food.</p>

<p><strong>Finding added sugars in food<br>
</strong>Unfortunately, you 
can&rsquo;t tell easily by looking at the nutrition facts panel of a food if it 
contains added sugars. The line for &ldquo;sugars&rdquo; includes both added 
and natural sugars. Naturally occurring sugars are found in milk (lactose) and 
fruit (fructose). Any product that contains milk (such as yogurt, milk or 
cream) or fruit (fresh, dried) contains some<em>natural</em> sugars.</p> 
<p>Reading the ingredient list on a processed food&rsquo;s label can tell you 
if the product contains added sugars, just not the exact amount if the product 
also contains natural sugars.</p> 
<p>Names for added sugars on labels include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Brown sugar</li> 
<li>Corn sweetener</li> 
<li>Corn syrup</li> 
<li>Fruit juice concentrates</li> 
<li>High-fructose corn syrup</li> 
<li>Honey</li> 
<li>Invert sugar</li> 
<li>Malt sugar</li> 
<li>Molasses</li> 
<li>Raw sugar</li> 
<li>Sugar</li> 
<li>Sugar molecules ending in &ldquo;ose&rdquo; (dextrose, fructose, glucose, 
lactose, maltose, sucrose)</li> 
<li>Syrup</li> </ul> 
<p>Furthermore, some products include terms related to sugars. Here are some 
common terms and their meanings:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sugar-Free &ndash; less than 0.5 g of sugar per serving</li> 
<li>Reduced Sugar or Less Sugar &ndash; at least 25 percent less sugars per 
serving compared to a standard serving size of the traditional variety</li> 
<li>No Added Sugars or Without Added Sugars &ndash; no sugars or 
sugar-containing ingredient such as juice or dry fruit is added during 
processing</li> 
<li>Low Sugar &ndash; not defined or allowed as a claim on food labels</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Although you can&rsquo;t isolate the calories per serving from added sugars 
with the information on a nutrition label, it may be helpful to calculate the 
calories per serving from<em>total</em> sugars (added sugars and naturally 
occurring sugars). To do this, multiply the grams of sugar by 4 (there are 4 
calories per 1 gram of sugar). For example, a product containing 15 g of sugar 
has 60 calories from sugar per serving.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that if the product has no fruit or milk products in the 
ingredients, all of the sugars in the food are from added sugars. If the 
product contains fruit or milk products, the total sugar per serving listed on 
the label will include added and naturally occurring sugars.</p> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<p><strong>Need to reduce added sugars<br>
</strong>Although sugars are not 
harmful to the body, our bodies don&rsquo;t<em>need</em> sugars to function 
properly. Added sugars contribute additional calories and zero nutrients to 
food.</p> 
<p>Over the past 30 years, Americans have steadily consumed more and more 
added sugars in their diets, which has contributed to the obesity epidemic. 
Reducing the amount of added sugars we eat cuts calories and can help you 
improve your heart health and control your weight.</p> 
<p>The American Heart Association recommends limiting the amount of added 
sugars you consume to no more than half of your daily discretionary calorie 
allowance. For most American women, this is no more than 100 calories per day 
and no more than 150 calories per day for men (or about 6 teaspoons per day for 
women and 9 teaspoons per day for men).</p> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<p><strong>Discretionary calories and added sugars<br>
</strong>You have a 
daily energy need &mdash; the amount of calories (or energy units) your body 
needs to function and provide energy for your activities. Think of your daily 
energy need as a budget. You&rsquo;d organize a real budget with 
&ldquo;essentials&rdquo; (things like rent and utilities) and 
&ldquo;extras&rdquo; (such as vacation and entertainment). In a daily calorie 
budget, the essentials are the minimum number of calories you need to meet your 
nutrient needs.</p> 
<p>Select low-fat and no-sugar-added foods to make good &ldquo;nutrient 
buys&rdquo; with your budget. Depending on the foods you choose and the amount 
of physical activity you do each day, you may have calories left over for 
&ldquo;extras&rdquo; that can be used on treats like solid fats, added sugars 
and alcohol. These are discretionary calories, or calories to be spent at your 
discretion.</p> 
<p>A person&rsquo;s discretionary calorie budget varies depending on how 
physically active they are and how many calories they need to consume to meet 
their daily nutrient requirements. Use this interactivetool to calculate your 
personal daily calorie needs. The American Heart Association recommends that no 
more than half of a person&rsquo;s daily discretionary calorie allowance be 
spent on added sugars.</p> 
<p>Common sources of discretionary calories (in addition to added sugars) are 
fats, oils and alcohol. Fats are the most concentrated source of calories. 
Discretionary calories can be used to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Eat additional foods from a food group above your daily recommendation.
</li> 
<li>Select a higher-calorie form of a food that&rsquo;s higher in fat or 
contains added sugars (whole milk vs. skim or sweetened vs. unsweetened cereal).
</li> 
<li>Add fats or sweeteners to the leanest versions of foods (for example, 
sauce, dressing and butter/margarine).</li> 
<li>Eat or drink items that are mostly fat, sugar or alcohol such as candy, 
cake, beer, wine or regular soda.</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to top</p> 
<p><strong>Tips for getting less added sugar<br>
</strong>Most Americans 
consume more than double the daily recommended amount of added sugars. A report 
from the 2001-04 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 
database showed that Americans get about 22.2 teaspoons of sugar a day or about 
355 calories. This is well over the recommended amount of no more than 100 
calories per day for women and no more than 150 calories per day for men.</p> 
<p>Use these simple tips to reduce sugar in your diet:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Remove sugar (white and brown), syrup, honey and molasses from the table 
&mdash; out of sight, out of mind!</li> 
<li>Cut back on the amount of sugar added to things you eat or drink regularly 
like cereal, pancake, coffee or tea. Try cutting the usual amount of sugar you 
add by half and wean down from there, or consider using an artificial sweetener.
</li> 
<li>Buy sugar-free or low-calorie beverages.</li> 
<li>Buy fresh fruits or fruits canned in water or natural juice. Avoid fruit 
canned in syrup, especially heavy syrup.</li> 
<li>Instead of adding sugar to cereal or oatmeal, add fresh fruit (try 
bananas, cherries or strawberries) or dried fruit (raisins, cranberries or 
apricots).</li> 
<li>When baking cookies, brownies or cakes, cut the sugar called for in your 
recipe by one-third to one-half. Often you won&rsquo;t notice the difference.
</li> 
<li>Instead of adding sugar in recipes, use extracts such as almond, vanilla, 
orange or lemon.</li> 
<li>Enhance foods with spices instead of sugar; try ginger, allspice, cinnamon 
or nutmeg.</li> 
<li>Substitute unsweetened applesauce for sugar in recipes (use equal amounts).
</li> 
<li>Try zero-calorie sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose or saccharin in 
moderation.</li> </ul>
