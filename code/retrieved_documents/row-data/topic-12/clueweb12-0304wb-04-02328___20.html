<h6>Although without a dining car, the Blue Arrow is top of the line travel, 
fast, modern and quite comfortable in all classes, with good bathrooms and even 
toilet paper 90% of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rapid is usually as fast, just 
with different (older) carriages including sleeper accommodation on longer 
routes.</h6> <br>

<h3> The Mystery Train</h3> 
<dt> I walk through Gara de Nord feeling older and wiser.&nbsp; The big 
railway station looks so different today &#150; modern, revamped.&nbsp;Shiny 
kiosks bulge with glossy mags, rows of chocolate and stacks of snacks.&nbsp; 
Men in suits chat on mobile phones.&nbsp;&nbsp; Glamorous girls laugh and joke, 
swig Fanta.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ticket collectors amble in smart uniforms, hats perched 
at a rakish angle.&nbsp;</dt> 
<dt> I can hardly believe my eyes.&nbsp; It seems a so modern.&nbsp; The steel 
body shines with immaculate paintwork; the windows are wide, slightly convex 
and made of thick tinted glass.&nbsp; Rugged steps and chrome handrails gleam 
invitingly in the early morning sun.&nbsp;</dt> 
<dt> I board the train in Bucharest's main railway station. &nbsp; Inside, the 
pale grey vinyl floor is surprisingly free of chewing gum.&nbsp; I choose a 
seat by the window.&nbsp; It feels well-designed, covered in bright blue 
fabric, firm but comfortable.&nbsp; I watch passengers walking along the 
platform outside.&nbsp;</dt> 
<dt> Soon the carriage begins to fill up. &nbsp; A middle-aged woman sits down 
opposite me, hair frosted like a cake, fingers dripping gold.&nbsp; I can 
almost hear the wheels grinding at her head: he's not Romanian.&nbsp; It must 
be my green rubbery skin, bulbous purple eye and furry antennae.&nbsp;</dt> 
<dt> The train pulls out of the Gara de Nord, slowly picking up speed, 
clickety-clack.&nbsp; I watch as dilapidated apartment blocks sail pass; a kid 
leans perilously from a rusty balcony.&nbsp; A skinny woman in a headscarf pins 
sagging sheets to a washing line.&nbsp;</dt> 
<dt> It still looks like Romania out there, apart from the snarling yellow 
diggers and new roads with sleek cars.&nbsp; But in here, I feel shot forward 
in time.&nbsp; I fold my arms and marvel.&nbsp; It's a bit of a mystery, 
progress.</dt>

<h3>High Quality and It's Cheap</h3> 
<h4>The easiest, most comfortable and usually cheapest, fastest and most 
rewarding way of intercity travel is by train.</h4> 
<h5>Romania's railway network is one of the largest and most dense in Europe, 
with trains servicing every town and city in the country, and a vast majority 
of the villages too on the Personal trains.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is just gorgeous 
too -- especially through most of the Transilvanian routes!</h5> 
<p>Due to the very low ticket prices for all Romanian train services, 1st 
Class is affordable for most travellers from English-speaking countries. 
Additionally, second class on both the InterCity (including Blue Arrow) and the 
Rapid services are comfortable enoguh.</p> 
<p>The additional cost for first class is quite small, for example, an extra 
$10 on an average 6-hour intercity route like Bucharest toIa&#351;i (the 
Moldovan de facto capital).</p> 
<h3>Say &quot;Chay Fay Ray&quot;!</h3> 
<h4> Don't worry, nobody ever calls it by its full name, instead just using 
the initials which are pronounced &quot;chay-fay-ray&quot;.</h4> 
<h5>The name of the national railways is CFR, which stands for Compania 
Nationala de Cai Ferate Romania, literally the &quot;National Company of Iron 
Horses Romania&quot;.</h5> 
<h3>Reliable and On-Time!</h3> 
<h4>As a visitor to Romania, it's pretty likely at some point you will take a 
train, and using the train network is an excellent idea for getting round this 
great country.</h4> 
<h5>Like most ex-Communist nations, the government built a very extensive rail 
network which even serves small village towns to this day.&nbsp; So, using the 
rail network, you really can get to just about anywhere for a very reasonable 
price.</h5> 
<h4>A Multi-Station System</h4> 
<h5>Be aware that most bigger cities have more than one train station, often 
with confusing titles. For example &quot;Timisoara Nord&quot; is not actually 
in the north of the city, but to the west.</h5> 
<h5>Generally speaking though, only one train station handles the inter-city 
traffic and the lovely woman selling you the ticket will assume you mean the 
main station if you don't specify which one you want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5> 
<h4>Make Your Own Way</h4> 
<h5>Frankly, as a foreigner, they'll think you know next to nothing and will 
make some pretty good decisions for you.&nbsp; Most government workers 
Romanians are forever vigilant on the right way of doing anything, including 
the accepted routes of travel.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>With your wits about you, you don't need speak one word of Romanian and 
you can make it safely to your destination without any problems. Trains are 
almost always very safe, with a limited risk of pickpockets, more so on the 
Accelerat and Personal services. It's very rare (and almost always a personal 
thing) for someone to be robbed by force or assaulted on a train.</h5> 
<h4>Sleep on It!</h4> 
<h5>Sleeper services (on the Rapid type trains) are a great and relaxing way 
to travel through the rolling hills of the wine country in Moldova, the 
stunning peaks and river valleys of Transilvania, and the vast fields of 
sunflowers and sunshine through the Wallachian plains of Muntenia and 
Moldova.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>Not only will you have some amazing photo opportunities, you'll have a 
nicely priced overnight bed, and arrive refreshed inTimi&#351;oara, Oradea, 
Cluj, Maramure&#351; or Bucovina.&nbsp; Transfer to your hotel by a cheap taxi, 
and you're on your way to a nice afternoon of sightseeing!</h5> 
<h5>For example, there is a daily Rapid sleeper train offering first-class 
sleeper accommodationto Oradea, which is about 650km from Bucharest on the 
Hungarian border.&nbsp; Oradea is a delightful old Habsburg town with super 
architecture, easily accessible on your very comfortable yet fairly inexpensive 
night train!</h5>

<h3>From Best to Worst: </h3> 
<h4>InterCity (IC)</h4> 
<h5>These are the more modern trains and usually in good condition. They only 
stop at fairly big cities and are rarely overcrowded except during major 
holidays (like Easter).</h5> 
<h5>If you can, use InterCity trains, which link all the major cities of the 
country with Bucharest.&nbsp; These trains are of a Western European standard 
and are incredibly clean and modern, with automatic doors, futuristic 
ecological toilets, air conditioning, ergonomic seats, free newspapers and all 
the other bells and whistles. Also, they are reasonably cheap and are 
increasingly used by Romanians (and tourists) on business trips.</h5> 
<h5>Probably the only minor drawback to the Inter-City is that the price is 
about 15 to 25% higher than the other trains. If getting to your destination 
quickly is your goal, always take the Inter-City.</h5> 
<h5>Also remember that the difference between first class and second class 
even for InterCities on long distance is no more than about 15%, so go with 
first class, because it's usually less crowded.</h5> 
<h6> Have more info? Please Let us know!</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5> Note however, that the advantages time-wise of an InterCity can be quite 
scant.&nbsp; Going from Bucharest toIa&#351;i, the IC runs from 6 hours 2 
minutes to 6 hours 23 minutes, depending on the departure time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
However a Rapid or Accelerat on this same route runs from 6 hours 23 minutes to 
6 hours 49 minutes!&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5> 
<h4>Blue Arrow (SA) </h4> 
<h5>(Sageata Albastr&#259; in Romanian).&nbsp; These are listed as Inter-City 
trains on the ticket and scheduling board, but the SA (Blue Arrow in English) 
is the ultra-modern train in Romania.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no way of knowing 
ahead of time which routes use the SA except by either asking or by looking at 
the information board on the station's platforms (not in the station itself, 
for reasons unknown).&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>Since the SA is considered an Inter-City for all intents and purposes, the 
price of the ticket is the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do note that luggage space is a 
bit less on the Blue Arrows -- if you're lugging alot, take a Rapid 
instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SA's are more about being a fast commuter type train 
than a full-service type of train found in Australia, Canada and the US 
trans-continental.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>If possible try to avoid &quot;Sageata Albastra&quot; if you plan to ride 
for a longer distance because although very modern it's not quite as 
comfortable as the &quot;normal&quot; InterCity or Rapid trains.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Anyone over about 160cm tall will not really appreciate the curves of the hard 
plastic moulded seats of the Blue Arrows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Built by Seimens, they 
had the best of intentions, but anything over about 2 hours really does get a 
bit much for the taller amongst us.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h4>Rapid (R)</h4> 
<h5>Don't be fooled by the name, Rapid trains aren't all that fast, and get 
into the station in about the same time the InterCity takes, with maybe a few 
more stops in between.&nbsp; First Class on the Rapid trains is almost as good 
as on the InterCity services, with very similar although older carriages 
used.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great for longer journeys however, the seats are more 
comfortable than those on the newer Blue Arrow carriages for example.&nbsp;</h5>
<p>Additionally, the Rapid train is the only one with Sleeper services with 
attendants, bed linen, toiletries and fresh towels.</p> 
<h5>The normal second-class carriages used are older than the InterCity ones, 
and there are usually 6 seats in First Class per compartment.&nbsp; On some 
trains, the compartment's heat is cranked to the point of making it a sauna 
while the next compartment has no heat at all and is an arctic 
experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dress flexibly and never assume.</h5> 
<h4>Accelerat (A)</h4> 
<h5>These are probably the most common of Romanian trains, especially if 
you're travelling between fairly big cities/towns. They do tend to make enough 
stops for a journey of any distance to be long.&nbsp;&nbsp; First class on an 
Accelerat is a bit more like second class on an InterCity service however.</h5> 
<h5>Many of the Accelerat trains also use the older carriages in various 
stages of delapidation, especially for the second-class carriages.</h5> 
<h5>First class on the Accelerats isn't nearly as good as on an InterCity 
service, although the juggling of carriages means you might get more of a Rapid 
version.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>In second class, try to walk up and down to find a compartment in better 
shape if the train isn't too crowded. The price for Accelerat and Rapid trains 
is usually quite good.</h5> 
<h5>In second class, the Accelerats usually feature a single long seat in the 
compartments -- which makes lying down for a sleep quite an attractive option 
for the backpacker or young traveller.</h5>

<h5>The &quot;Rapid&quot; and &quot;Accelerat&quot; trains should be your 
second choice (unless you are on a sleeper service, which&nbsp; - they stop at 
more stops, but serve more destinations, and, although being a little bit more 
traditional, are still very comfortable, especially in first class.</h5> 
<h4>Personal (P)</h4> 
<h5>These are a real ride, and actually, quite a bit of fun if you have the 
time.&nbsp; These go to the smallest of villages and towns and make a 
tremendous amount of stops. You don't want to take a Personal train unless 
you're going to one of those little towns, although the prices are extremely 
low especially for short trips.</h5> 
<h5>Personals are also quite often crowded, and feature a single class on most 
(although first is available on a few select routes).&nbsp; This makes them a 
kind of adventure and are your only option when travelling to small 
villages.&nbsp; Although they do make very original and memorable experiences, 
they are quite slow and rattle-traps, albeit very cheap.</h5> 
<p>If you do find first class available at all on your Personal train -- TAKE 
IT!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of them can be quite fun, most are at least a bit better 
than the rest of the train.&nbsp;</p> 
<h6> Have more info? Please Let us know!</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5> However. some of these trains are very useful for exploring rural 
backwaters or getting off the beaten track (the train from Oravita to Anina in 
the Semenic mountains offers provides one of the most scenic trips in the 
country).</h5> 
<h5>In some areas such as on the branches radiating out from Timisoara and 
Arad these trains are little more than railbuses or 'Motoare' (some of them 
dating from the 1940s) with wooden slatted or plastic seats which rattle and 
roar and shake you to pieces - however, exploring the country at this 'gentle' 
pace can also be rewarding.</h5> <br>

<h5>Check the Boards</h5> 
<h6>After finding your time and city, decide your class and buy the ticket!

<h3>Starting your Train Trip</h3> 
<h4>Tickets Explained </h4> 
<h5>Except for Personal trains, (almost) all tickets are actually in two 
parts, although you may not even notice it. One is the ticket itself, priced 
based on the distance you're travelling and type of train.</h5> 
<h5>The other part is the &quot;reservation&quot;, which costs extra. Even if 
you buy the ticket two seconds before the train arrives in the station, 
generally you'll need to get the &quot;reservation&quot; as well, although you 
don't have to ask for it specifically. The person selling you the ticket will 
sell you both parts automatically.</h5> 
<h5>A Wide Variety of Travellers</h5> 
<h6>From Peasant Grandmother to sharp businesswoman, Romania's trains cater to 
all of society</h6> <br>

<h5>Usually On-Time</h5> 
<h6>Rail services can be largely depended on to run on time, barring winter 
delays or the odd mechanical problem.</h6> <br>

<h5>Moldovan Scenery Along the Track</h5>

is a great way to do some sight-seeing!</h6> <br>

</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5>Buying a ticket without a &quot;reservation&quot; is the rough equivalent 
of flying &quot;standby&quot; on a plane. It just means you're riding the train 
but don't have an assigned seat. It's impossible to do this on Inter-City 
trains and most Accelerat/Rapid trains so this really isn't something you can 
avoid to save money per se.</h5> 
<p>The ever-elusive discount is available from travel agents, and you should 
be able to score 10% off a round-trip ticket with a bit of patient smiling and 
persistence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't pout if you're told it doesn't exist or is not 
available.&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>Knowing Which Train</h4> 
<h5>It sort of doesn't matter what you were told by friends, and what the 
ticket lady told you.&nbsp; You really should ask the conductor or attendant ON 
the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp; The train number and sometimes destination as well 
will hang on the side of the train somewhere, most of the time, and in most 
places.&nbsp;</h5> 
<p>But the internet is littered with tales of English-speaking travellers who 
have found that the train lurched in the wrong direction, only to be told by 
the conductor that they'd need to buy new tickets on the spots (which can be 
suspiciously expensive).&nbsp;&nbsp; So, make sure it's the right train, going 
to the right city.&nbsp; Harass fellow passengers for the info if you have to, 
it's too important to make this mistake, as surprisingly common as it can 
be!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<dl> 
<dd> 
<h5>&quot;We went to the train station in Bucharest and sat in McDonalds for 4 
hours nursing 1 lemonade between us. We waited till the last minute, changed 
all our money and jumped on the train. We found our cabin but it was filled 
with someone else's baggage. Ours and the next. It was so full that you 
couldn't even get in. I had to back into another cabin so that the owners could 
empty it out and almost took out a girl sitting down. She spoke English so 
understood our predicament. They were meant to be sitting elsewhere too.</h5> 
</dd> 
<dd> 
<h5>&quot;We finally got in and started chatting. Simon was French and Martina 
was Swiss and they lived together in Lille. They'd both been to Oz so had no 
trouble understanding our sense of humour and slang! The train crossed over 
into Bulgaria and stopped at a place called Ruse. The weather did the turn 
around and rained heavily. The Romanians with all the bags started freaking and 
unloading very quickly. They hadn't been able to bribe the border guard so I 
guess they had to get off. The train started up and appeared to be going 
backwards. Small moment of panic.</h5> </dd> 
<dd> 
<h5>&quot;Extra panic when the ticket conductor came round, looked at our 
tickets and asked where we were going. Veliko Tarnovo, we all replied. Then the 
words we'd been dreading. 'This train is not going to Veliko. You're on the 
wrong train. We all stared in disbelief. The lady in Bucharest had assured us 
the train was direct. The ticket guy was very understanding and stood to make 
some good cash on the side. We'd have to buy a ticket for this leg as our 
tickets were not valid. So we negotiated a price for all four of us. He told us 
that the track to Veliko had been down for two months because of bad weather. 
We found out we were heading three and a half hours in the wrong direction to a 
place called Shumen. &quot;</h5> </dd> 
<dd> 
<h6>From  Lucinate on TravelLog </h6> </dd> </dl> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>Knowing When to Detrain</h4> 
<h5>Unless you're on the SA train, there's no indication or announcement 
inside the train as to when you've arrived at your destination. If it is 
daytime and you're going to a big city, it's fairly easy look out the window 
and see the name of the station you're in.</h5> 
<h5>At night-time however, or in a blizzard, or at a smaller station, it's 
difficult or impossible to see the signs at the platform and know where the 
heck you are. The easiest way to find out is to ask your neighbour on the 
train, as most people are regular riders and know where they are.</h5> 
<h6> Have more info? Please Let us know!</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5> If you're shy or there are no friendly neighbours, the best thing to do 
is look on the train schedule ahead of time (on the internet) and see what time 
you'll get to your destination. You should memorize the scheduled time for the 
stop beforehand, so you can verify that you're on schedule and that you just 
got to City X then you know the next stop is City Y, where you want to go.</h5> 
<h5>The schedule will also tell you how many minutes you'll be stopped at any 
given station, allowing you to calculate if you have enough time to jump off 
and buy a quick snack.</h5> 
<h3>Amenities Aboard Your Journey</h3> 
<h4>First Class Seating</h4> 
<h5>The best seats for shorter day journeys are the Blue Arrow first class 
seating, which is very modern, European and rather like airline 
seats.&nbsp;&nbsp; For longer journeys, more than 4 hours or so, the Rapid 
first class seats are a bit more comfortable, again in the familiar single 
seats.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First class on the Accelerats is not quite as good 
however, so take an InterCity, Blue Arrow or Rapid if comfort is particularly 
important -- the price is not much more anyways.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h4>Second Class Seating</h4> 
<p>Rapid and InterCity trains have better second class seating, with no more 
than 6 per compartment.&nbsp; The seats are proper single location seats, and 
face each other in each compartment, with a large window and a door.&nbsp; The 
degenerate to benches for 8 people in each compartment on Accelerat trains, and 
that and worse on the Personals.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Is That Your Seat?</h4> 
<h5>With second class seats (and maybe first on Accelerats), do remember that 
your seat location is not fixed in stone. Common courtesy in Romania is to 
board a train and sit in your assigned seat, especially if it is crowded. If 
however you can find a space you like better (esp. in the same class), just go 
ahead and move over there. The conductors won't mind and neither will anyone 
else in most cases. In fact, most overnight trains do not have an assigned seat 
at all.</h5> 
<h4>The Bathrooms Aboard</h4> 
<h5>Except for the Blue Arrows and some Rapid services, don't be counting on 
the use of a clean bathroom or the supply of toilet paper.&nbsp; If you do 
forget, you have about 5 or 8 stops out of the station where the train was 
serviced, as except for overnight trains, there is very little attendant 
servicing of facilities other than at it's origin.</h5> 
<h5>Bring along some paper of your own if you think you might need it. Using 
the bathroom on the train is free while you'll almost always have to pay to use 
a bathroom at the station, which you really don't want to do in most 
cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, just remember your toilet paper for the 
train.&nbsp; You've been warned.</h5> 
<h4>Your Dining Experience</h4> 
<h5>You can eat or drink on the trains without any problem. If you forgot to 
bring a snack, people will board the trains (except for the SA) to sell 
everything from magazines to hot coffee to beer. Most larger stations have 
stores right on the platform so you can hop off and buy a snack while the train 
is in the station if you like.</h5> 
<h5>Pretzels are the best choice if you are on an Accelerat or Personal train 
(which stop longer at stations), sold hot and fairly fresh at most of the 
larger station platforms.&nbsp; You really must be practiced in getting off the 
train, and back on again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look first to see how long the 
queues are before detraining and watch the conductors carefully whilst you are 
in line.</h5> 
<h5>If you are on an InterCity service however, you must be very quick.&nbsp; 
Only 2 or 3 minutes sometimes at even larger stations is all you have, so 
packing some sandwiches, some fruit, and some bottled water is a very good idea 
if your trip is more than a few hours (as most InterCity services are).</h5> 
<h4>Light 'Em If You Have 'Em</h4> 
<h5>All trains have smoking compartments or areas, more or less loosely 
observed, except for the SA. If other people smoking bothers you, take the SA 
train or else be prepared to suffer a little. Most compartments are non-smoking 
while smoking is allowed in the hallways. Ironically in Hungary it is the 
reverse.</h5> 
<h4>It Truly Beggars Belief</h4> 
<h5>The larger stations will see a few derelicts hop on board and do their 
well-practiced routines.&nbsp; Some are rather horrific to be honest, so just 
steel yourself for some circus-like shenanigans.&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;</h5> <br>

<h2> Getting the ticket</h2> <br>

<h3>Get the Ticket</h3> 
<h4>It used to be that you could only buy a ticket at the train stations an 
hour or less before the train departed. Now in most bigger cities, you can buy 
a ticket at the station up to 24 hours before it leaves.</h4> 
<h6> Have more info? Please Let us know!</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5> With a little persuasion, you can even buy a ticket a day or two 
beforehand as well.&nbsp; Of course, such requests against policy may entail a 
little persuasion.&nbsp; That means &quot;keep the change&quot;.</h5> 
<h5>The easiest way to determine if you can buy tickets ahead of time is to 
peek into the window at the train station. If you see a computer and/or people 
carrying around blue, printed tickets, then that means the new system is 
installed and you can buy tickets up to a day in advance. If you don't see a 
computer and/or people are issued little brown cardboard stubs, then they're 
still on the old system.</h5> &nbsp; <br>

<h3>&nbsp;Tickets in Advance and Rail Passes</h3> 
<h4>If you would like to buy tickets ahead of time, or for a group of people, 
or simply want to check on availability you have to go the CFR office. For 
whatever mysterious reason, the CFR office is never anywhere near the train 
station.</h4> 
<h5>In fact, it is usually on the other side of town and usually there's just 
one CFR office. You can buy a ticket for any train up to 30 days in advance at 
the CFR office, which is a good idea especially if you're going to travel 
during a holiday period.</h5> 
<h5>Train tickets may be also purchased within 10 days of departure at the CFR 
ticket window at the train station, and return travel must be within 10 days of 
departure for return tickets.&nbsp; Please note that no Romanian train tickets 
are refundable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The advance booking fee is just under 2 RON, about 
80 U.S. cents.</h5>

<h4>Passes You Can Buy Before Your Trip to Romania</h4> 
<p>When travelling in an English speaking country, it is normal to make your 
reservations in advance, often paying online or by credit card over the 
phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, even for the most ardent planner of trips, you'll do much better 
price-wise by doing everything the Romanian way, meaning that you should really 
purchase your tickets in-country.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are in Romania a limited 
time, less than a week for example, you may need to reserve sleeper cars and 
other travel online using one of the passes available to travellers.</p> 
<h5>You can buy online with Eurail from home before you start your trip if you 
wish.&nbsp; Designed for 2 to 5 adults travelling together at all times, the 
passes do afford unlimited travel on the rail networks, and give you 1st class 
seating for travel on any 5 or 10 days in a 2-month period.&nbsp; Travel days 
may be used consecutively or non-consecutively, and further conditions apply.
</h5> 
<h4>International Trains</h4> 
<h6> Have more info? Please Let us know!</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5>If you live in the UK or Ireland, you can also buy the EuroDomino or 
InterRail passes, which allow travel to Romania from England (although not on 
cross-channel services), from about&#128;300 - &nbsp;&#128;550, depending on 
the number of zones (there are 7) and the number of days you are 
travelling.&nbsp; These are only open to European residents (proof is required) 
and there are slight discounts for youth and seniors.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>You can also get a BalkanPass for around $132 which can be economical if 
you plan on travelling around Romania by rail and other countries (good for 5 
days).&nbsp; The BalkanPass gives you unlimited travel on CFR and through 
neighbouring Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and all the way to Turkey too. Discounts 
are available for children.</h5> 
<h4>Buy In Advance at a CFR Office in Romania</h4> 
<h5>Romanians rarely bother to get tickets in advance, mostly because 
availability is usually wide open for all classes.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, during 
peak summer and winter holiday times on some routes, a trip to the station or 
the CFR office in town is definitely recommended.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>Where to buy tickets at either the CFR office or in the train station is 
fairly obvious. Even if you don't speak Romanian, just say the name of the town 
you want to go to. If there are multiple trains heading to your destination, 
say the time of the train's departure, which you can find on the big schedule 
board. Romanian trains usually have the same schedule 7 days a week so the 2pm 
to Bucharest on Tuesday is also leaving at 2pm on Sunday.</h5> 
<h4>Get a Travel Card</h4> 
<h5>CFR Offices also have Travel Cards which are based per kilometre if you 
plan on travelling around Romania.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can, for example, have 
up to 300km of first class travel on the Rapid trains on any route for up to 30 
days for 1320 RON ($485 USD/&#128;375 EUR). </h5> <br>

<h3>Overnight Sleeper Services</h3> 
<h4>You will be delighted with the choices of quality sleeper trains in 
Romania.&nbsp;&nbsp; With both domestic and international destinations served, 
the couchette and sleepers are quite comfortable and enjoyable, with an 
attendant serving your compartment.</h4> 
<h5>First and Second Class Sleepers</h5> 
<h6>The additional cost for the first class sleeper (left) is rather slight, 
and well worth the gain in space over second class (right).</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5>First Class Sleeper on the&nbsp; TransBalkan and Ister Services</h5> 
<h6>Running between Budapest and Bucharest, first class sleeper cabins are 
comfortable, carpeted bedrooms.<br>
</h6> <br>

<h4> </h4> <br>

<h6>Photos:&nbsp; Wasteel's Seat 61 </h6> <br>
<br>

<h5>Sleeper services on the Rapid trains are a great and relaxing way to 
travel through the rolling hills of the wine country in Moldova, the stunning 
peaks and river valleys of Transilvania, and the vast fields of sunflowers and 
sunshine through the Wallachian plains of Muntenia and Moldova.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>Not only will you have some amazing photo opportunities, you'll have a 
nicely priced overnight bed, and arrive refreshed inTimi&#351;oara, Cluj, 
Maramure&#351; or Bucovina.&nbsp; Transfer to your hotel by a cheap taxi, and 
you're on your way to a nice afternoon of sightseeing!</h5> 
<h4>First Class Sleeper Compartments</h4> 
<h5>You can count on hot water, and you are given towels, soap and ablution 
items by your attendant as you board.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bedding on these services 
is nicely prepared for you, and there is a shower for first class passengers at 
the end of each carriage.</h5> 
<h5>The first class comfortable sleeper compartments can be reserved for 1, 2, 
or 3 persons with proper beds and washbasins.&nbsp; If you're coming from 
Vienna or Budapest, the Vienna-Bucharest 'Dacia Express' now has an Austrian 
sleeping-car as well, a rather prized commodity if you can locate and reserve 
it!</h5> 
<h4>Second Class Sleeper Compartments</h4> 
<h5>The second class sleeper compartments are on the second-class couchette 
type compartments with 6 seats by day which convert to 6 bunks for night time 
use with rug, sheet and pillow supplied.</h5> 
<h5>The triple berths in the 2nd class couchette compartments serve families 
nicely with up to 6 persons each.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These couchette 
compartments are fairly basic, and for most English-speaking travellers, a 
proper bed in the sleeper is much more comfortable and secure, costs very 
little extra, and is the recommended option.<br>
</h5> 
<h5>All compartments are refurbished to a reasonable standard, and you'll have 
enough room to store your food and drink (which you bring with you).&nbsp;<br>

</h5> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>Ticketing for Sleepers</h4> 
<h6> Have more info? Please Let us know!</h6> <br>
<br>

<h5> Ticketing for for sleeper services is a little more complicated than the 
normal Rapid ticket.&nbsp; First you need your normal ticket and then you need 
to get a special reservation for the sleeping berth itself.&nbsp; This is how 
it works on Amtrak in the US on some sectors as well.&nbsp;</h5> 
<h5>Do make sure that you buy your tickets at least a week in advance if you 
intend to travel by the first-class sleeper cars because the tickets sell out 
quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The extra sleeper berth ticket is between $20 and $40 USD, 
depending on the route, indeed a bargain.</h5> 
<h4>Your Bed Awaits</h4> 
<h5>You can either get a full bed or else a &quot;couchette&quot;, which is a 
regular compartment with regular seats that converts into flip-down beds.</h5> 
<h5>Regardless of which kind of sleeping berth you want, once you're on board 
the train and it is moving, there will be a carriage attendant stationed at the 
end of your carriage to provide you with your sheets, blankets and pillows. The 
top berth in the &quot;couchette&quot; system provides the most privacy, and 
you should make certain you prepare your bed early -- as doing this after some 
have begun to sleep is really just rude.</h5> 
<h5>If you are on the top bunk, you have to use a little ladder to get up 
there. The ladder is &quot;stored&quot; just outside the door to your 
compartment. Take it off its hooks and attach it to the luggage rack in your 
compartment, and leave it there until the next morning.&nbsp; You don't want to 
lose this to an interloper!</h5>

<h3>From London's Waterloo Station</h3> 
<h4>If you're not completely thrilled about spending 3 1/2 hours in a 737 on 
your way from Heathrow to Bucharest, why not take a couple of days and go on 
the Eurostar to Paris or Brussels, then on to Munich, Vienna and Bucharest?</h4>
<h5>You can stop and see the seat of the Habsburg Empire on the way, and 
continue the journey too if you want, on the path of the original Saxons as 
they migrated to the south and east into the Balkans.&nbsp; You'll notice the 
spread of the architecture and attitudes as you travel through time to the 
Saxon outposts the Siebenburgen,&nbsp; or seven fortified towns of Transilvania!
