<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3> 
<p> For many experienced astroimagers, correctly installing an imaging train 
on a scope and using the correct procedure to capture high quality images, has 
become common sense. But we must also consider the novice, who has no 
experience whatsoever in astroimaging. Therefore, this basic [quick and dirty] 
introduction to astroimaging is provided for the beginner, who is very 
interested in becoming an experienced astroimager, but has no idea where to 
begin to learn the art [and subtleties] of astroimaging, or doesn't have the 
time [or inclination] to read through all those &quot;hieroglyphic&quot; 
astrophotography books with all those graphs and heavy math.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> PROPERLY INSTALLING AN IMAGING TRAIN ON YOUR TELESCOPE </h3> 
<p> There are various pieces of equipment necessary to construct an imaging 
train and, when<b>properly</b> stacked together (similar to railroad cars), 
give you the capability to produce a quality astroimage in the least amount of 
time, and with as little frustration as possible. There are many [adaptive] 
ways to attach various accessories to different types of telescopes. We are 
only going to discuss one simple, basic imaging train, because all the 
different models and imaging accessories operate similarly. Once you've learned 
the basics, they will apply to all the other imaging systems on the market. 
Some will have more features, and be easier to operate, and others will be 
awkward and frustrating but, after reading this compendium, you will be better 
equipped to discern the &quot;good stuff&quot; from the bad.</p> 
<p> One of the most common coupling formats is the 2&quot;-24tpi male threaded 
found on most SCT&nbsp;visual backs. This format was first introduced by 
Celestron, and Meade Instruments soon followed with the same fitting (almost), 
which has now become an industry standard in Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes. 
Another very common telescope coupling is the 2&quot; female slide-fit [usually 
a focuser input] that accepts 2&quot; barrel-nose eyepieces and other 
accessories, and is mounted on most Newtonian, refractor, and some types of 
Cassegrain telescopes with their myriad of common optical configurations (i.e. 
Schmidt, classical, Ritchey-Chretian, Maksutov, Dall-Kirkham, etc.). The 
equipment's female threaded slip-ring attaches to its 2&quot;-24tpi male 
counterpart on the telescope's visual back, and offers a very short profile and 
excellent security. It was primarily designed to support extended astroimaging 
trains in the days of 35mm astrophotography, but has been easily adapted to CCD 
astroimaging. This format does not easily allow for field rotation. It was 
primarily designed for visual eyepiece observing, but has been extensively 
utilized to secure imaging trains because it was simply there at the time. In 
hindsight, no barrel-nose format should have ever been used for imaging train 
applications because it wastes profile (except when inserted in a 
focuser)&nbsp;and can't be properly secured with one or even two thumb screws, 
thus the necessity to develop VSE's new Quad-Lock system which allows the 
barrel-nose format to be as rigid and secure as any threaded format. However, 
this barrel nose format does allow for easy field rotation (addressed later). 
The 2&quot; slip-fit barrel-nose format can be made more secure (but not more 
rigid) by providing a 1/2&quot; long [or so] machined security indent in the 
male barrel tube. This provides a recessed section in the barrel in which the 
thumb screw(s) can reside. Even if the thumb screw(s) come loose, the equipment 
cannot detach itself from the telescope, and cause a catastrophy.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> Installing a Secondary Focuser on your Telescope </h3> 
<p> The novice will think that a secondary focuser is an option he really can 
do without. He may be right, but not usually. With rare exceptions, most 
commercial Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes (SCTs) require a secondary focuser. 
Secondary focusers are designed for the current generation of Meade/Celestron 
Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes that focus by moving their primary mirrors and 
accept accessories via their standardized threaded visual backs.&nbsp;The four 
SCT standards are 2&quot;-24tpi for both Meade and Celestron (using a reducer 
for the 10&quot; and larger models), 3.25&quot;-16tpi for Meade (10&quot; and 
12&quot; models), 3.29&quot;-16tpi for Celestron (11&quot; and 14&quot; 
models), and 4&quot;-16tpi for the Meade 16&quot; SCT.</p> 
<p> Without a secondary focuser, a serious problem arises when you try to 
focus using the focusing knob protruding from the SCT's visual back. Your image 
will begin to shift laterally around the field of view - very frustrating 
indeed. Small amounts of image shift are acceptable when casually viewing the 
celestial sky through even a moderately high-power eyepiece, but when you 
attach an imaging train to your SCT and try to center a guide star in your 
eyepiece's illuminated reticle crosshairs, etc., you find that this mild 
irritation has become intolerable. The image jumps all over your image plane 
and field of view. You have just encountered unacceptable lateral image shift. 
Until Meade and Celestron start building a better SCT (yes, you can eliminate 
the lateral image shift by simply designing and implementing a better fork-type 
primary focusing arm), the astroimager must use a secondary focuser docked to 
the SCT's visual back to eliminate the focusing wiggles. Even if there was no 
lateral image shift, SCT's move their primary mirrors, which provides a 
focusing ratio that is approximately 6 times as coarse as other types of common 
secondary docking focusers. Therefore, rock-solid micro-focusing becomes a very 
useful upgrade even without lateral image shift.</p> 
<p> Since your SCT's <i><b>primary </b></i>focusing system manages all your 
large focusing position changes, your<b><i>secondary</i></b> focuser need not 
have more than about 0.1&quot; of actual overall travel. In reality, most 
secondary focusers have much more focus range (all VSE MasterGlide focusers 
provide a full inch of redundant travel and our MicroGlide focusers provide 
1/2-inch). You attach a secondary focuser to your SCT by simply screwing it 
onto your visual back<i>(Note that MasterGlide focusers utilize the larger, 
more rigid 3.25&quot;-16tpi large format threaded visual back for Meade 
10&quot; &amp; 12&quot; SCTs with a 4&quot; adapter available for Meade 
16&quot; SCTs, and a 3.29&quot;-16tpi adapter for Celestron C11, C14).</i>You 
then insert an eyepiece or diagonal, etc. into the focuser's input as you would 
with any other standard focuser. VSE's 2&quot; Threaded Barrel Adapter (item #
A2LT) can easily be inserted in a MasterGlide or MicroGlide focuser's moving 
tube and rigidly affixed using Quad-Lock. This converts the output to a 
rock-solid 2&quot;-24tpi male format so you can utilize all the standard, 
commercially available accessories and extended imaging trains.</p> 
<p> The upper right picture illustrates an imaging train composed of VSE 
components. The straight-through imaging train consists of a [now discontinued] 
VSE Filter Wheel (FW4) + Super Power Focuser [also discontinued, but replaced 
by the MasterGlide M5] + Slider 2 + 35mm SLR camera (which could easily be 
substituted for a CCD camera in a matter of seconds since both camera formats 
now use the same T-thread fittings). A 40mm Televue wide-field eyepiece has 
been inserted in the Slider's top slide-mirror port, and a VSE 25mm illuminated 
reticle guiding eyepiece (also discontinued because we finally ran out of 
military-surplus glass reticles)&nbsp;has been inserted in the side pick-off 
port. It doesn't get much better, or easier, than this! And you thought I 
forgot expensive! Nope. You could cut the expense to a small fraction of the 
above imaging train by utilizing one of VSE's less expensive focusers (i.e. M1, 
M2 or MGF, etc.) and a Slider using it's [FREE] built-in 2&quot; format filter 
slot and accomplish the same end imaging result without all those high-dollar 
&quot;bells &amp; whistles&quot; which are typically used for total remote 
operation from observatory warm rooms, etc. VSE also offers in-line Filter Slot 
Adapters, or our Filter Slide System (seeFilter Adapters link). </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> Installing a Focal Reducer on your Secondary Focuser </h3> 
<p> The second imaging train accessory we're going to discuss is the focal 
reducer (pictured at right to scale, full size, depending on your monitor's 
resolution of course). The focal reducer used to be a necessity when imaging 
with CCD cameras with relatively small imaging areas, compared to 35mm formats. 
A focal reducer and CCD camera combination can approach the larger field 
offered by 35mm cameras without a focal reducer. When the CCD imaging industry 
first came on board, the chip size wasn't much larger than a gnat's butt, and 
it was almost impossible to acquire a bright star on the [microscopic] chip 
area, let alone a faint deep-sky object. Today, CCD chips have dropped 
dramatically in price, and increased [literally exponentially] in area. These 
new larger chips are now approaching the size of 35mm format, negating the need 
for a focal reducer altogether, and the optical distortions caused by 
shortening your light cone and passing it through all that glass. Simple prime 
focus is always the best way to acheive the best images, but focal reducers can 
still be used effectively for wider-field imaging.</p> 
<p> If you have a Meade/Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, you just screw 
their respective f/6.3 focal reducer onto the 2&quot; threaded male visual back 
of your SCT. If you have a telescope with a standard 2&quot; slide-fit focuser 
that accepts 2&quot; barrel-nose stuff, you need to purchase one of VSE's 
2&quot; Threaded Barrel Adapters (seeADAPTERS link). You then screw the 2&quot; 
Threaded Barrel Adapter (Item #A2LT) into the female end of your focal reducer, 
and insert that combination into your 2&quot; slide-fit focuser and lock down 
the thumb screw(s) into the recessed indent in the male tube. Now you have a 
2&quot; male threaded fitting available on which to screw a Slider (with the 
2&quot; threaded female slip-ring input). Of note, using a focal reducer should 
be avoided if at all possible, unless you like to immerse yourself in a 
&quot;bag of worms.&quot;</p> 
<p> Consider VSE's exclusive focal reducer &quot;hidden cavity&quot; super 
feature located inside the moving tube of all MasterGlide focusers. Instead of 
installing a&nbsp;focal reducer (FR) conventionally, and consuming all that 
valuable profile, you install it inside the focuser's moving tube and save your 
profile for other imaging train accessories. It also moves the FR closer to the 
SCT's visual back where it was originally intended to be installed. All 
Meade/Celestron f/6.3 focal reducers fit inside the MasterGlide focuser's 
moving tube. The f/3.3 focal reducers, utilized in the MasterGlide's 
&quot;hidden cavity,&quot; are too fast to be practical in most extended 
imaging train applications, unless you are simply inserting an eyepiece or 
camera directly into the focuser itself.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> Installing your Slider </h3> 
<p> Next, screw your focal reducer onto the Slider's 2&quot; female slip-ring 
input or, if&nbsp;you decided to install your FR inside the MasterGlide 
focuser's &quot;hidden cavity,&quot; just screw a VSE 2&quot; Threaded Adapter 
(Item #A2LT) directly onto the end of your Slider. Then insert the Slider's 
[now] 2&quot; barrel nose into your MasterGlide focuser's 2&quot; format moving 
tube and apply VSE's Quad-Lock system to the barrel-nose. With your Slider 
rigidly affixed to your imaging train, you will [next] need to install your 
35mm or CCD imaging camera, to the rear output port of the Slider (discussed 
below). For additional info, also see VSE'sImaging Train Configuration link. 
</p> 
<p> You have, or are considering the purchase of, a CCD camera with a built-in 
guiding chip, or a CCD camera that has an imaging chip with an area that can be 
dedicated to guiding, so you don't need a Slider.<b><i>Think again!</i></b>
&nbsp;You think it's easy to find a suitable guide star with a<b>fixed </b>
separate guide chip, or a<b>fixed</b> chip area dedicated to guiding? Are you, 
or would you like to be, a masochist that likes guide star frustration? Since 
your guide chip [area] is integral and fixed, your ability to scan for an 
adequate guide star is diminished by a factor of ten, compared to the Slider's 
easily adjustable independent pick-off mirror. Even with your fancy dual 
[fixed] chip guiding/imaging CCD camera, guide star acquisition can&nbsp;still 
be a literal nightmare if you don't have a way of positioning a guide star 
independent of your imaging target. This is the capability a Slider offers. Of 
course, you need to use a separate guiding CCD camera, or guiding eyepiece, 
allowing you to simply scan for a guide star and pick &amp; choose any usable 
star in or around your target object. This is accomplished by simply rotating 
the Slider itself (Z-axis). Yes, you can also rotate a CCD camera, but you are 
still limited to a fixed area of rotation without the necessary independent X-Y 
axis adjustable pick-off mirror controls of the Slider. Once you've acquired a 
usable guide star, it's quick and easy to center, or place, any star in the 
Slider's pick-off field in 2 seconds or less. Consider the new  Starlight 
Express SXV-H9C with the separate guiding camera that slips right into the 
Slider 2's [1.25&quot; format] off-axis guiding port&nbsp;- a marriage 
literally made for heavenly imaging! </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> Installing your Sidewinder </h3> 
<p> Understand that a standard focal reducer will not install on the 
Sidewinder's front input port. You need to install it on the rear port just 
before your camera. If you do this, you will need to extend out all the lateral 
ports about 6&quot; to achieve parfocus. If you have a few extension drawtubes 
or diagonals, they will do the job. This means that any focal reducer is not 
recommended. If you have a chip that is larger than 35mm format, you really 
don't need a focal reducer that adds glass and other imperfections. Your 
scope's light cone should remain pure to achieve the best imaging results. This 
is an opinion that others may disagree with. Also, Sidewinders will not work 
with any 2&quot; format focuser, including VSE MasterGlide and MicroGlide 
focusers. However, the Sidewinder will install on the output of our MicroGlide 
Coupling Focuser (Item #MGFCO), which has a larger input and output thread, 
with a 2.25&quot; internal clear aperture. Next, screw your Sidewinder (using 
the proper docking port ring) onto your scope. You can screw the docking port 
ring onto your scope, then slip the Sidewinder over the ring and tighten the 
three set screws, if you wish. With your Sidewinder rigidly affixed to your 
scope, you will [next] need to install your 35mm or CCD imaging camera, to the 
rear output port of the Sidewinder (discussed below). For additional info, also 
see VSE'sImaging Train Configuration link. </p>

SBIG STL-11000, 11 Megapixel CCD camera. In fact, SBIG's STL was the catalyst 
for VSE's Mega-Port Sidewinder - the time had come! Use the STL and Sidewinder 
in combination with SBIG's STV and you've assembled a dream machine that will 
easily create &quot;frustration-free&quot; professional astroimages worthy of 
the largest observatory on Planet Earth and beyond. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> Installing your CCD or 35mm Camera on your Slider </h3> 
<p> First we will discuss the installation of a CCD camera as your final item 
in your imaging train. All modern CCD cameras, such as the SBIG, Starlight 
Express, and Apogee lines of excellent CCD imaging cameras, now have a standard 
42mm female T-thread input coupling,<b>not</b> like the old-style 1.25&quot; 
barrel-nose ST-6 CCD camera pictured at right. Providing your CCD camera's 
input has female T-adapter threads, you will use VSE's Zero Profile T-Adapter 
(ZPTA, item #AZP2T) between the Slider's rear port and your imaging camera. 
&nbsp;If you are going to use a 35mm camera for imaging, just screw a T-ring 
adapter, that is specifically designed for your particular brand of 35mm camera 
(i.e. Nikon, Minolta, Olympus, Pentax, etc.), onto the Slider's ZPTA in the 
rear imaging port. If you have a Slider 2 with the side pick-off port, you 
should position your camera in the<b><i>vertical</i></b> position which will 
put the long [skinny] side of the rectangular film further away from your 
pick-off mirror and lessen the vignetting on your film caused by the pick-off 
mirror's protrusion into your telescope's light cone. If you have a rectangular 
CCD chip, this procedure also applies.</p> 
<p> Since your 35mm camera focuses about 1.5&quot; further in than a CCD 
camera, you'll need an extension drawtube out the top slide-mirror port and the 
side pick-off mirror port to parfocus your system. You may think that this 35mm 
camera procedure is awkward, but it's much better than extending/wasting your 
profile for CCD cameras. To explain, most other flip-mirror devices on the 
market extend the rear port to parfocus for CCD cameras. The superior Slider 
method of parfocusing always maintains the shortest straight-through profile 
whether you're using CCD or 35mm cameras. Just remember, CCD = no extension 
drawtubes, 35mm = extension drawtubes with Sliders. We'll talk further about 
parfocusing your Slider between 35mm and CCD in &quot;Paul's Pictorial 
Parfocusing Primer&quot;&nbsp;below, and the subject is also discussed at the 
Questions &amp; Answers (FAQ) link on VSE's home page.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> PREPARING YOUR IMAGING TRAIN FOR ASTROIMAGING </h3> 
<p> Illustrated at right is a partially assembled imaging train (less 
secondary focuser to simplify), as discussed above, docked to a Meade 8&quot; 
LX200's visual back, a good astroimaging entry level scope. You will also need 
to insert a very low power 2&quot; format eyepiece (pictured is a 2&quot; 
format 40mm eyepiece, see FYI below) in the Slider's top slide mirror port, and 
a higher power 1.25&quot; format illuminated reticle guiding eyepiece in the 
side pick-off port. You can use any of the commercially available guiding 
eyepieces on the market.</p> 
<p> <i>FYI, a field lens (sky side lens) that is the full internal diameter of 
the 1.25&quot; tube is the widest true field achievable in that specific 
format. Example: A 1.25&quot; 40mm eyepiece doesn't have a wider true field 
than a 32mm eyepiece. A 1.25&quot; 40mm eyepiece will achieve a lower 
magnification, but achieve the same true field as the 32mm eyepiece with no 
increase in true field. This causes the 40mm eyepiece to seem like it is losing 
apparent field compared to the 32mm eyepiece, creating a &quot;tunnel 
vision&quot; view through the eyepiece. This field relationship applies to 
2&quot; format eyepieces too. The maximum true field tops out at about 55mm in 
2&quot; format.</i> </p> 
<p> First you need a good brisk, clear night with above average 
&quot;seeing&quot; conditions. You can test &quot;seeing&quot; by imaging a 
finite solar system object or a bright star (splitting double stars is a good 
test too). If the object looks like it is boiling, and/or appears to have a lot 
of chromatic scintillation (color shifting), I would wait for an 
atmospherically calmer night, or you can use a bad &quot;seeing&quot; night to 
practice.</p> 
<p> After you've leveled and polar aligned your scope (explained in the manual 
that came with your scope), you need to decide which object you would like to 
image first. I would start with relatively bright summer deep sky objects, such 
as the Ring Nebula (M57) in Lyra, or the globular cluster in Hercules (M13). If 
it's winter, try imaging the Orion Nebula at the tip of Orion's sword, although 
it may be a little too large for CCD cameras with smaller chips. You can also 
use an open cluster, or a brighter star field, to test your imaging system. But 
before you try to locate an object through your scope, push the Slider's slide 
mirror knob all the way in. That puts the angled 45 degree slide mirror in the 
path of your incoming light cone, and sends the cone to the top slide mirror 
wide-field eyepiece.<i><b>Do not use high power eyepieces in the Slider's top 
port when trying to image</b></i>. That port is specifically designed for lower 
power field-finding eyepieces only (explained in-depth later). Of course, any 
power eyepiece will work in the top port. The Slider or Sidewinder make great 
diagonals for visual observing, when you're not trying to acquire an object to 
image.</p> 
<p> Focus your telescope, by looking through the Slider or Sidewinder's top 
port<b><i>LOW</i></b> power eyepiece, on a low to medium brightness star (10th 
to 5th magnitude) near the object you are going to image. Do not focus on a 
star halfway across the sky from where you plan to image. Also, re-focus your 
imaging camera when moving to another object that is [let's say] more than 20 
degrees from where you are currently imaging. You need to do this because all 
telescopes have mechanical flexure, caused simply by gravity, that can de-focus 
your telescope and shift your telescope's field center by many arc seconds, to 
possibly a few arc minutes, as you move your telescope across the sky. 
&nbsp;Once you have that star in focus, and centered in your eyepiece's field 
of view, you need to focus your imaging camera. Don't forget to pull the 
Slider's mirror knob out so your imaging cone is redirected straight-through to 
your imaging chip. With a CCD camera, and the specific software that came with 
your camera, you can manually focus using the software's focusing sub-routine, 
or use your autofocus sub-routine in conjunction with an autofocus equipped 
focuser. When you have the smallest pixel count possible, you're CCD camera is 
focused and ready to take a time exposure of your deep-sky object.<b><i>Never 
try to focus any imaging camera by looking through an adjacent eyepiece!</i></b>
 More on this important focusing subject latter.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> Paul's Pictorial Parfocusing Primer </h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Say that three times real quick. Betcha can't without spitting all over 
yourself? Anyway, I hope this section will provide you with a better 
understanding of parfocusing<b><i>any</i></b> imaging train, not&nbsp;just the 
Slider used in this compendium. I selected the [long] discontinued Micro-Slider 
(MS) and Flipper because they are designed to parfocus &quot;in-reverse&quot; 
of each other, which should provide you with a better concept of parfocusing 
principles (oops! there's another P-word). The MS parfocuses, from 35mm to CCD 
camera, by adding length to the straight-through imaging port (noted in red, 
upper left) which is the most inefficient method of parfocusing (like the Meade 
flip-mirror devices) because you are increasing your imaging train's profile - 
that's a NO-NO! The Flipper and Slider parfocus, from CCD to 35mm camera, by 
adding drawtubes to the top port (noted in red, lower right) and side pick-off 
ports (not shown), which is the most effective method to parfocus your imaging 
train. Because you are not adding length to your existing straight-through 
profile to parfocus your system, it remains the same for either CCD or 35mm 
cameras. &nbsp;Remember that a shorter imaging train is always preferred 
because it's simply more solid, eliminating system flexure problems as you move 
from object to object.</p> 
<p> Typically, with a CCD camera, you will <b>not</b> need an extension 
drawtube using a Slider or Sidewinder (see lower left Flipper), because most 
CCD cameras are roughly parfocus with most newer standardized eyepieces. 
However, with a 35mm camera, that focuses about 1.5&quot; further out from a 
standard CCD camera, you will need an extension drawtube (Item#AD22S or AD21S 
for Sliders)&nbsp;between the top port and your eyepiece (see lower right 
Flipper, area in red). Of note, Meade has adopted the inferior reverse design 
on their flip-mirrors that extends the imaging train profile instead of the 
top, bottom or side mirror port profile like the Sliders and Sidewinders. To 
further reiterate, note the two lower Flippers above. The red area noted on the 
lower right Flipper illustrates an inserted drawtube that is needed to 
parfocalize your system when using a 35mm camera, and is not needed when 
imaging with a CCD camera (see lower left Flipper). Conversely, the upper two 
Micro-Sliders obtain parfocus by extending the CCD camera's straight-through 
profile (again, a no-no)&nbsp;noted in the red area in the upper left 
Micro-Slider image.</p>

<h3> Focal Plane Focusing Devices for your 35mm Camera (under the knife's edge)
</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p> A 35mm camera is a little more difficult to focus because what you think 
is in focus, when you look through your SLR camera's viewfinder (onto the 
ground glass image plane), is usually out-of-focus just enough to give you a 
soft or slightly fuzzy picture. The best way to make absolutely sure your 35mm 
camera is in perfect focus is to use an after-market focal plane focusing 
device (i.e knife-edge, grating, etc.), like the one pictured at left. There 
have been different types available that incorporate knife edges, split images, 
double images, Ronchi gratings, etc. Celestron offered, what they called an 
MFFT-55 (Multi-Functional Focal Tester-55), &nbsp;that would evaluate a 
telescope's focal plane for focus, collimation, and curvature of field, but 
have discontinued it long ago. With the decline of 35mm imaging and the 
increase of CCD imaging, these devices are becoming less and less common. There 
is still one very high-quality device currently on the market.Stiletto Image 
Focusers from STI offers many 35mm and CCD focusing devices. </p> 
<p>  The illustration at right represents a too far in, too far out, and 
perfectly focused image as seen through a knife edge type, focal plane focusing 
device.<b>Illustration 1</b> represents a shallow focused gradient image 
produced by the knife edge that moves across the field from left to right.<b>
Illustration 2</b>represents a deep focused gradient image produced by the 
knife edge that moves across the field from right to left.<b>Illustration 3</b> 
illustrates a perfectly focused image, as the field instantaneously goes to 
dark across the entire field of view.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Don't be fooled by claims that you can obtain quick, accurate, pin-point 
camera focus from a flip-mirror device using a secondary high powered, helical 
focusing eyepiece, because you can't. And don't ever try to achieve critical 
focus through your SLR's viewfinder (it's real hard on your neck, too). There 
are similar looking devices (like Sliders) out there that indirectly imply you 
can achieve critical camera focus with a high powered eyepiece in the top 
flip-mirror port.&nbsp;Not possible! First, you can't achieve critical [sharp] 
focus using a high powered eyepiece in any device's top flip-mirror port 
(explained in the next paragraph). Second, how are you going to locate your 
imaging target through a high powered eyepiece with no field of view? This type 
of device looks spectacular to the novice, but in reality is quite 
dysfunctional when trying to acquire your sky object and achieving final 
critical focus.</p> 
<p> You should always use a &quot;non-eyepiece&quot; focusing method to 
achieve final critical focus, like an after-market focal plane focusing device 
(such as the ones discussed a couple of paragraphs up), or your 35mm 
astroimages will typically turn out fuzzy and/or soft. Oh, you might &quot;get 
lucky&quot; with an image, from time to time, but is it really worth all that 
effort to get lucky, or would you rather spend a little more time using an 
aftermarket focusing device, and be guaranteed tack sharp super astroimages 
every time? To reiterate, helical focusing using multi-imaging portals (MIPs) 
is completely unnecessary. The standard distance, from the front face of your 
T-ring to your SLR's film plane, is precisely 55mm. The human eye simply can't 
perceive and focus on that critical distance by looking at an image directly 
through the eyepiece. It is impossible, especially when that accuracy must be 
precisely 55mm, not 55mm plus or minus 1mm (which is 0.04&quot;).</p> 
<p> Think about this simple lesson in common sense. Your eyes are <b>never</b> 
perfectly &quot;in-focus.&quot; Even if you are diagnosed with 20-20 vision, 
critical camera focus is not achievable with your eye, because there is no such 
thing as perfect 20-20 vision. Many people wear glasses to correct focus 
imperfections, and from year to year an eyeglass wearer needs to get his eyes 
examined and new glasses with a different Rx, because your eye's focus point on 
your retina has changed. Your eyes will be changing for the rest of your life. 
Every eyeglass wearer has tried looking through a telescope with, and without, 
his glasses. The eyeglass wearer had to drastically change the telescope's 
focus each time. So how can you possibly try to achieve critical camera focus 
with your eye - it is literally impossible! Especially with an astigmatism, 
which afflicts half the people in the world. The above has been confirmed by 
conversations with Dr. Dale Anderson, MD, PC, who is an ophthalmologist and 
noted eye surgeon.</p> 
<p> There is one particular [current] misleading ad in S&amp;T magazine that 
says, and I quote, &quot;Focus through your eyepiece.&quot; Focus what? Your 
eyepiece for your eye's sake? Yes, you can do that. Your camera? Definitely 
not! If this statement is telling us that all telescopes focus through their 
eyepieces, then I think even the novice has figured out that basic concept long 
ago. If not, then the true implication can only be interpreted to deceive. This 
deceptive advertising is deliberately leading the novice [want-to-be] 
astroimager to believe that he can simply focus his CCD or 35mm camera, using 
his eye and an eyepiece, at the focus of their flip-mirror device. If you are 
one of those people who have been lead to think this, then I hope you 
appreciate this basic reality check. Designing an imaging train around this 
misconception could have [or may already have] lead you down the wrong path.</p>
<p> If it isn't exact, your images will always turn out to be mediocre, 
instead of celestial masterpieces worthy of enlargement and framing. You will 
sacrifice those special moments in time, when you can proudly say to your 
friends, &quot;I took that picture!&quot; And they'll say, &quot;WOW! That 
picture looks like it was taken at one of the big research observatories.&quot; 
Sure, it's a little more effort to remove your 35mm camera from the telescope, 
and screw a focal plane focusing device on to the Slider or Sidewinder's rear 
T-adapter port. Then, after you have achieved optimum focus, unscrewing the 
focusing device, and carefully reinstalling your 35mm camera onto your scope. 
But you don't have to go through that procedure for every image, unless you 
move your scope to a completely different area of sky. Remember the flexure 
problem discussed a couple of sections up. And, that extra effort is a lot less 
time consuming and frustrating than trying to switch between high powered 
[no-field] and low powered [wide-field] eyepieces to find your target object.
</p> 
<p> From over a decade of imaging experience at Black Forest Observatory, 
we've found that using wide-field eyepieces for image locating in your top 
port,&nbsp;with simple push/pull secondary focusing (on all Sliders and 
Sidewinders) is much quicker and more efficient than any redundant helical 
focusing system (all Sliders offer full aperture top port mirrors for those 
wide-field eyepieces). You're actually wasting that top port, on a function 
that can't be achieved, when you could be using that top port for other 
purposes. Your secondary eyepieces (top port wide-field and side port 
guiding)&nbsp;can simply be &quot;ball park&quot; focused, because your eye 
doesn't need [and can't see] that critical focusing difference anyway. The only 
critical focus is at the camera. With these procedures, your camera's image 
will always be guaranteed tack sharp, and that's the bottom line, period! BTW, 
VSE does offer a helical focusing drawtube insert (seeADAPTERS link) as a 
convenience accessory if you want one.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> FINALLY, TAKING THE FIRST EXPOSURE THROUGH YOUR IMAGING TRAIN </h3> 
<p> Let us assume that you have already gone through the effort to pin-point 
focus your CCD or 35mm (using a focal plane focusing device discussed above) 
camera on a nearby star, and have aimed your telescope at a neighboring deep 
sky object, after parfocusing your top port's wide-field eyepiece with your 
imaging camera (Oh, if I forgot to mention this earlier, parfocus simply means 
that your camera and eyepieces are focused at the same point). Once this 
object, let's say the Ring Nebula in Lyra (M57), is centered in your parfocused 
wide-field eyepiece, go to your Slider or Sidewinder's side pick-off port's 
guiding eyepiece and parfocus that next, on an appropriately bright guide star. 
If you're lucky, you'll have a guide star in your guide eyepiece's field of 
view, and you can just center the star using the techniques explained below. If 
you don't see a suitable guide star in your guide eyepiece, you will need to 
acquire a guide star out-of-field. You do this by simply turning the Slider's 
little black knob (loosen the knurled lock knob first), or Push/Pulling the 
Sidewinder's insert in and out, across your light cone's lateral X-axis. If 
this doesn't acquire an appropriate guide star, then move the Y-axis lever 
protruding from the top of the Slider's side port, or rotate the Sidewinder's 
insert. This action will rotate the pick-off mirror effectively providing a 
perpendicular axis of adjustment. These two controls provide X/Y-axis, 360 
degree micro-positioning of the internal pick-off mirror and, 9 chances out of 
10, this simple [exclusive to VSE] procedure will acquire a usable guide star. 
If not, then you can obtain a third axis adjustment (I call it the Z-axis) by 
rotating your Slider or Sidewinder in a circular motion, either by loosening 
the thumb screws in your 2&quot; focuser and rotating your Slider, or rotating 
the Sidewinder on its threaded input docking port.&nbsp;It is advisable to 
rotate the Slider or Sidewinder body only a few degrees at a time, since your 
guiding eyepiece usually has less than a one degree field of view. Then do your 
X/Y-axis &quot;scan&quot; again. Once you've acquired and centered a suitable 
guide star in your guiding eyepiece, you're ready to start the exposure (either 
35mm or CCD camera). For 35mm camera imaging, you'll need one of those 
extension shutter release cables that have a built-in lock. For CCD imaging, 
just go to your computer to start the exposure. Don't forget to pull the main 
mirror out slowly and carefully, to remove the diagonal mirror that is blocking 
the light cone's straight-through path to your imaging camera. Hopefully, your 
image will already be perfectly focused on the film plane in your SLR camera 
(see above for camera focusing procedure).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> Eyepiece Guiding on a Guide Star </h3> 
<p> We're only going to discuss manual eyepiece guiding, except for the 
following brief note, because all the information you should need is usually in 
the CCD guiding camera's instruction manual. When using a CCD guiding camera, 
the set-up procedure is almost identical except, when you've acquired and 
centered a guide star in your guiding eyepiece, you carefully remove that 
eyepiece, and replace it with the CCD guiding camera. Guiding on a boiling 
stellar dot, in a guide eyepiece, for long periods of time, can get quite 
physically fatiguing, not to mention eye strain. Bilberry Extract, available at 
your local health food store, is said to help your night vision, and help 
relieve eye strain from long guiding sessions. Try to keep your guide star in 
the corner of two perpendicularly opposed illuminated lines, and use a 
comfortable chair/stool. Don't guide standing up, because when you lose your 
equilibrium, and fall over in the dark, you really don't know what your going 
to fall on in those farmers' fields.&nbsp;It could get really ugly and messy 
down there. That way you can catch a drift almost instantly, and correct for it 
with your drive controls, before your imaged stars become &quot;squiggly 
things.&quot; Eventually, you will learn your local sky's exposure duration, 
before your film/chip begins to fog from background light pollution. You will 
find that a properly aligned mount will nearly eliminate any drift in 
declination, so correcting in DEC will not be as frequent as correcting in 
right ascension. You see, worms (the small diameter helical cut gear, with the 
drive motor attached to one end of its shaft, that drives your RA shaft's 
larger diameter gear, at an angle that is perpendicular to itself) can't be 
manufactured to be perfectly concentric or symmetrical. They always end up with 
eccentric or asymmetric rotational errors, because even the most accurate 
lathes or milling machines in the world still can't eliminate the worm's 
imperfections. Ed Byers made the lowest periodical error RA drive systems 
available for commercial telescopes, because he had those very expensive, and 
accurate, &quot;tenth&quot; milling machines (&quot;tenth&quot; is machine shop 
slang for 1/10,000th of an inch). You will always have to deal with periodic 
errors induced by the worm, unless you don't drive with a worm.</p> 
<p> If you have a PEC (periodic error correction) system on your scope, don't 
forget to calibrate that system. It can reduce your guiding to a minimum. It's 
also a great &quot;bandaid&quot; for all those low accuracy, high periodic 
error worm gears that Celestron/Meade put in their scopes. Some even install 
spur gears on their RA shafts in conjunction with helical cut worm gears. These 
&quot;non-meshing&quot; worm/spur gear systems are designed only for casual 
eyepiece viewing, not astroimaging. Make sure your scope has a true worm gear 
drive, not a sloppy fitting spur gear system.</p> 
<p> If you process your images in a computer, using Adobe Photoshop, etc., you 
can usually go past your fogging limit without damaging results, because you 
can process the image faults out of existence. I use Photoshop 7 to create 
VSE's display ads for Sky &amp; Telescope magazine, and all those gaudy 
graphics you see at VSE's web pages. The software's capabilities are near 
unlimited, and the unsharp mask feature is very valuable for sharpening sky 
images. What you can create in your mind, you can transfer to screen/paper. 
Your only limitation is Photoshop's steep learning curve. I've been using 
Photoshop since version 2 (that's many years), and I haven't touched on many of 
its features.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> 35mm CAMERAS &amp; FILMS FOR ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY </h3> 
<p> If you have one of those fancy &quot;automatic&quot; SLR cameras, leave it 
in the closet. You need to have an old &quot;totally manual&quot; SLR camera 
with a bulb setting, and definitely without auto-film advance. Could you 
imagine using an auto-advance camera for astrophotography? Your shutter lock 
slips, and your camera advances to the next frame. Bzzzzzzzzz! It could even 
wake you from your celestial nap! The best camera I've found, and use at BFO, 
is the Nikon F2 with the removable top, prism viewfinder. You could also easily 
remove the old ground glass focal plane, from underneath the prism viewfinder, 
and replace it with a Beattie Intense Screen (4 times the brightness of 
conventional ground glass focal planes). We use a Beattie Intense Screen 
(available through the camera merchants who advertise in the back of S&amp;T) 
in BFO's Nikon F2. You can insert a homemade block (made of soft aluminum or 
hardwood) in the camera's empty rectangular viewfinder hole. The homemade block 
should have a 1.25&quot; hole in the center,&nbsp;for the insertion of a low 
power eyepiece, that has a primary focus about a half to 1-inch below the 
1.25&quot; format bottom cylinder (either a push/pull fit or set screw 
would&nbsp;hold the eyepiece secure in the&nbsp;plate). This installation would 
provide comfortable right-angle viewing and<i>coarse</i> focusing through your 
SLR's viewfinder, with or without a Beattie Intense Screen. It could even have 
interesting applications beyond astroimaging. At minimum, it would be a useful, 
and fun, construction project.</p> 
<p> Some good films for astrophotography are Fuji print film or Fujichrome 
(slides) 400ASA, or higher. Kodak's 1000ASA films are quite grain-free compared 
to a few years ago. If you would like to experiment with gas hypered films, 
which increase the film's sensitivity to light and lower the film's reciprocity 
failure, you can purchase that special film through Lumicon, listed in the 
advertiser's index in the back of any S&amp;T magazine. They even have a gas 
hypering kit, so you can create your own gas hypered film.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> FILTERS FOR 35mm &amp; CCD ASTROIMAGING </h3> 
<p> There are many different filters available that will drastically improve 
your astroimages. Besides the standard RGB (red, green, blue) filters, there 
are some exotic filters available for 35mm black &amp; white films, like fine 
grain Tri-X and Plus-X, for color films (discussed above), and even CCD imaging 
cameras. Again, most of these special filters are available from Lumicon. For 
all types of astroimaging, you can get improved results by using Lumicon's 
exclusive Deep-Sky filter, that will dramatically darken the stellar 
background, and help to block light pollution. For B&amp;W films, a minus 
violet filter will give you pin-point stars. An H-alpha pass filter will 
increase the visual range of your film into the infrared end of the spectrum. 
However, this filter has a very severe application limitation; it only works 
with B&amp;W 2415 film. Since CCD cameras are very sensitive in the infrared, 
you can purchase an IR Block filter to obtain more natural looking images in 
the visible part of the spectrum. To obtain good 35mm color images, you can 
just use color film, but if you want your colors to decisively stand out, you 
can use a set of RGB filters, and take three separate images with B&amp;W film. 
You could even obtain a 4th separate image layer with an H-alpha pass filter, 
to extend your red into the infrared, but you could only use 2415 high 
resolution film to take advantage of this 4th image layer. The RGB multiple 
image filter array can just as easily be used with any CCD camera too. Just 
name your images redm57, grnm57, blum57, etc. With B&amp;W films, you scan your 
processsed prints (or negatives, with a slide scanner) to create a computer 
file of each color. &nbsp;Then create layers in Photoshop of each color, 
combine them and flatten the image into one image, and you've got a superior 
color image using B&amp;W film.</p> 
<p> My recommendation is to purchase all 2&quot; filters. They may cost a 
little more, but you can use them with larger CCD chips and 35mm films. 
1.25&quot; filters have become obsolete because larger CCD chips and 35mm 
format films are too large for the smaller filters and will vignette your 
images. All Sliders are equipped with a built-in, very low profile 2&quot; 
filter slot.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME (my time, not Stephen Hawking's) </h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p> In the early days of astroimaging, guide scopes were extensively used to 
track stars for astrophotography, but they found that guide scopes inherently 
produced unacceptable system flexure that was very difficult to eliminate. To 
reduce this flexure, heavier tubes, truss assemblies and mounting brackets 
needed to be used, adding great expense and weight to the telescope. FYI, guide 
scopes are still extensively used in Japan and the Orient, one of the world 
leaders in amateur astrophotography per capita. That's why Takahashi (Japanese) 
refractors, you purchase in the US, had no back focus. Takahashi is just now 
&quot;Americanizing&quot; the refractors they import to the US (see the new 
TOA-130 at the Installations link).&nbsp;Then came off-axis guiding, but it was 
a frustrating literal nightmare to find a suitable guide star, because the 
off-axis prisms were very small and fixed. Adjustable off-axis aids were then 
introduced, but they too were very difficult to adjust, requiring you to loosen 
thumb screws and move various mechanisms back and forth.</p> 
<p> Then came Sliders and Flippers (now discontinued). They evolved from a 
simple beginning. The need for practical, efficient, and effective ways to 
acquire astroimages. There was nothing but awkward, unusable, devices on the 
market back then. The only alternative was to manufacture our own multi-imaging 
portals (MIPs) at BFO's machine shop. After many years of beta-testing and 
experimentation, the Slider and Flipper design was finally perfected, but for 
many more years, it was only used internally at BFO. Then, after ten years, and 
much coaxing from my astronomical friends, I decided to manufacture and market 
a production model at BFO's machine shop. And today, VSE creates a 
revolutionary product line that is &quot;second-to-none.&quot; Only the 
&quot;pocket book&quot; or the erroneous purchasing choices of the novice 
provide VSE with any competition.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3> CONCLUSION </h3> 
<p> After reading the above, these procedures may sound like a lot of work and 
a very steep learning curve for the beginner, but after you've purchased and 
set up your equipment and captured a few images, it'll seem like second nature. 
And, most important, you will have bypassed most of that astroimaging 
frustration, and put the fun back in this wonderful celestial hobby. 
Unfortunately, many &quot;would be&quot; astroimagers have wasted thousands of 
dollars because they simply don't research the subject, or take the time to 
find [or purchase] the best products. People think that because a product is 
advertised in a reputable magazine, it has to be a good, functional product. 
Not true! You'll eventually thank yourself for taking the initial time to find, 
and read, this compendium. Remember, VSE products are based on functional 
simplicity, not a bunch of dysfunctional baubles. Examples are: 1) separate 
filter wheels that waste important profile and add flexure to your imaging 
train; 2) critical focusing devices where none are needed; and 3) claims of 
pin-point focusing with the human eye which can't be done. Now, you know better 
after reading the above, don't you.&nbsp;The simpler [and shorter] your imaging 
train, the more efficient it will be, and then you're on your 
&quot;skyway&quot; to becoming a reputable, world-class astroimager (seeAstro 
Links to visit some of these web sites). </p> 
<p> I have tried to simply present &quot;tried and true&quot; logical imaging 
facts that, I think you will agree, are justifiably stated. I want to use my 
expertise to save my astronomical friends and colleagues the time, expense, and 
frustration that can be found in astroimaging. Following the wrong path [to an 
end] can disappoint many people, and discourage them from pursuing their 
astronomy, space exploration, and astroimaging goals. We need all the [what I 
call] pro-space citizens we can acquire, if we are to save the Planet for 
future generations of yet unborn billions that need to survive on this speck of 
dust in the universe (seeWhy Space? for more &quot;soapbox&quot; stuff). </p> 
<p> So, print this compendium, find a comfortable chair to go over the finer 
points, and enjoy the &quot;read.&quot; Keep this reference with your imaging 
equipment until the astroimaging experience becomes a conditioned response, and 
don't forget to make copies available to your astronomy club members who are 
interested in astroimaging. Or reprint it in your club's newsletter, in 
sections (part 1, part 2, etc.) of course. &nbsp;I wish I 'd had this kind of 
basic information when I began my astronomy efforts, but back then, the wheel 
hadn't been invented yet, either.</p>
