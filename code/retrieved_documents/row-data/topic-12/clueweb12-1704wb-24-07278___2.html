<h2>Tablet PC vs the Rest</h2> 
<h2>Pro's and Con's of Tablet PCs</h2> 
<h3>Pro's of using a Pen to write on a TabletPC Screen</h3> 1. You can write 
when you are literally anywhere! Compare this to the many situations when it is 
simply impossible to find the space to put down the computer to type on a 
regular keyboard. Picture walking around at work, picture being in a cramped 
lecture theatre (where often keyboard use due to it's noise generation is now 
banned), picture being on any mode of transport be it car, train, bus or plane.
<br> <br>
 2. In a lecture also you are interested in being able to switch 
quickly between drawing and diagrams and entering text. The movement between 
using a mouse to draw and a keyboard to type slows entry of information in this 
scenario. Remember that visually stimulating notes are not created through text 
alone and neither are good memories. Text on its own is very forgettable.<br>

<br> 3. Taking notes from a book - if you are working with a textbook, and 
taking notes about the things that you know you are going to forget from it, 
then usually when one makes paper notes, you have the advantage where one hand 
holds the book and the other writes the notes.<br>
 Taking notes from a book 
and typing with a keyboard is extremely difficult. You would hold the book 
open, then somehow fix it open at the page you are reading, and then move to 
put both hands on to the keyboard again, type what you want etc.<br>
 Freely 
flipping back and forth with your free hand is not an option.<br>
 Using a pen 
on a Tablet is like using paper.<br>
<br>
 4. Creating diagrams is a known 
premier way to improve learning and study efficiency - seeMindmaps and Concept 
maps - like in lecture theatres, the switching between adding graphical 
elements and adding text is very messy with movement of the hand between a 
mouse and a keyboard. There is none of this when using a tablet.<br>
<br>
 5. 
Drawing with a mouse is literally impossible. Drawing with a pen is both more 
accurate and how we are used to doing it. Case closed.<br>
<br>

<h3>Con's of using a Tablet PC screen to write on</h3> The major problem 
scenario this author has found when using a Pen with a Tablet PC, is that 
authoring a document such as this webpage ... i.e. larger documents, is faster 
and more accurate using a keyboard, assuming you can type, than if you were 
going to try to write the equivalent with ink and especially if you are trying 
add a handwriting recognition step in addition to the simple entry.<br>
 Good 
typists can type at &gt;60words per minute... with good ones typing at 90wpm... 
which is not, in my opinion possible if writing with reasonably neat cursive.
<br> <br>
 Pure Tablet PC's overcome this by allowing the attachment of a 
keyboard and mouse to the slate, so that it becomes effectively a hybrid 
computer.<br>
<br>
 Screen brightness is an issue with TabletPC's not only 
because you might be trying to save power but also, even if you are not, the 
extra thickness due to the protective layers added and the sensing apparatus, 
make the brightness, viewability somewhat less than a simple view only screen. 
Make sure if you purchase one, that you make sure that in your typical use 
environment, that this is not an issue.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Is the hybrid the perfect alternative to one or the other?</h3> Generally 
a hybrid will allow you the advantages of a keyboard for typing larger items 
AND the notetaking practicality of using a pen.<br>
<br>
 You can either 
purchase a hybrid at the outset OR you can purchase a pure TabletPC design 
without the keyboard, and add a keyboard,mouse and a stand to hold the Tablet 
upright later.<br>
<b>The downsides of a hybrid scenario are:</b> <br>
 1. The 
ideal screen size may be considered somewhat larger for a keyboard based laptop 
than a tablet... i.e. a tablet ideal size is considered to be about the size of 
piece of paper... specifically large enough to be creative on, but small enough 
to carry easily.<br>
<br>
 2. The keyboard similarly if it is a 12 inch screen 
that it attaches to, is more limited in size, and not quite as easy to use as a 
dedicated standard laptop keyboard.<br>
 This may be overcome by attaching an 
external keyboard whether you purchase a hybrid to start with or create one.<br>
<br> 
<h3>Laptop OR Tablet PC or Hybrid Vs Desktop</h3> These 3 computer types are 
designed for portability - especially the Tablets are specifically focussing on 
that customer requirement.<br>
 With the limitations in battery technology in 
2005, long life is dependant on lower operating power use, which means that the 
Tablets are often somewhat slower than an equivalently priced keyboard only 
laptop. Also, since the other major consumer of battery power is screen 
brightness, the Tablet may often be set by default to a lower brightness to 
conserve battery life. These 2 issues are being overcome through the provision 
of multiple power schemes on the latest tablets and hybrids...<br>
 You can 
choose from different power settings depending on how long you wish to use the 
Tablet away from a power source, vs how fast you want it to run.<br>
<br>
 
Value for money... some will argue that due to mass production and so forth, 
desktops, which have previously been more in demand are better value. The 
counter arguements to this are that recently for the first time in history, 
portable sales have been outstripping desktops and so prices are dropping 
sharply and secondly, it is no use buying something, no matter how cheap, if it 
does not meet your needs... so... where will you be using the computer, and for 
what?<br>
