<p><strong>Back in 2009 Plane Stupid were among a festive group of folk 
protesting against the terrifying implications of carbon trading as part of the
Climate Camp at the G20 demonstrations. Our own Josh Moos was one of the two 
activists who not only took a beating that evening, but went on to jump through 
legal hoops to try and bring those responsible for police violence to account. 
In a remarkable ruling, the Police were in the dock and found guilty today.
</strong></p> 
<p>Here is Josh Moos's statement on the ruling:</p> 
<p><em>&quot;I have witnessed and been on the receiving end of police violence 
before. The police have a history of gross violence, and what I saw on the 1st 
and 2nd April was deeply disturbing because of it's sheer scale. The officers 
behaved as if they had been unleashed upon us and were free to use as much 
force as they wished without provocation or any other justification. This was 
not misbehaviour by a few, out of control 'bad apples'; it was systematic and 
orchestrated. Today the court has ruled, in clear terms, that it was unlawful 
and nothing I nor anyone else demonstrating at the Carbon Exchange did in any 
way to justify the kettling and violence to which we were subjected. The ruling 
is very welcome, but better still would be an acceptance by the police of their 
own wrongdoing. That has still to come.&quot;</em></p>

<h2> Flying Matters crashes </h2>  Submitted by Barry on Tue, 04/12/2011 -

<p></p> 
<p><strong>This blog carries a warning. Before reading it, fortify yourself 
with a little rum or whisky.&nbsp; Flying Matters, the pro-aviation lobby group 
that has fought so hard for expansion of airports across the country, is to 
fold. According to that well-known</strong><strong>publication<em> 'An 
Executive Review of Business Travel',</em>Flying Matters will be wound up at 
the end of the month because</strong><strong> its corporate backers (mostly 
airlines) are falling out amongst themselves about the future direction of 
policy.</strong></p> 
<p>So it is farewell to it's chairman Brian Wilson, the once radical Labour 
MP, who became Tony Blair's Energy Minister and a big defender of nuclear power 
and airport expansion. Who would have though it would end like this for the 
radical young journalist who, 40-odd years ago, founded the West Highland Free 
Press, the hugely popular newspaper which brought a breath of fresh air to 
Scotland's highlands and island by giving a voice to the crofters and 
challenging the staid establishment press.</p> 
<p>And it's farewell, too, to the face of Flying Papers, Michelle di Leo. 
Michelle, who once tried to join the anti-expansion network,AirportWatch, under 
an assumed name, is the daughter of Tony Blair's first aviation minister Glenda 
Jackson MP. She married Jackson's Dan Hodges who chaired Freedom to Fly, the 
earlier pro-aviation lobby group, which folder in 2003.</p> 
<p>The demise of Flying Matters is a sign of the confusion within the UK 
aviation industry. It is still in a state of shock that a conservative-led 
Government dared to drop new runways at Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick. Never 
before has the industry had such a reverse. For 50 years it has got what it 
wanted. But it was on the wrong side of the popular revolt - against a third 
runway at Heathrow. Flying Matters has been swept aside by that.</p> 
<p>An executive review of Business Travel commented:</p> 
<p>&quot;<em>The organisation did cover a wide spectrum of the industry, 
including both British Airways and Unite, but there was an argument that Flying 
Matters carried little weight of influence.&quot;</em>It went on: &quot;<em>Any 
future lobbying group is expected to be formed around a more focused alliance.
</em> Vital is the selection of the individual to lead such a coalition, common 
consensus being that British Aviation is currently lacking such a person.&quot;
</p>

<h2> In praise of Harry Coover. Harry who? </h2>  Submitted by Petra on Wed,

<li>superglue</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Plane Stupid doesn't do obituaries. True, we'll make the mother of 
all exceptions when the aviation industry dies a death. But we have to mark the 
passing of Harry Coover. An unsung hero of activists across the world. The man 
who invented superglue!</strong></p> 
<p>His great invention has been used in protests in Gaza, against whaling, 
against the RBS bank and by Plane Stupid's Dan Glass when he superglued himself 
to Gordon Brown when he was prime minister in protests against plans for a 
third runway at Heathrow.</p> 
<p>You see, it's so convenient. Tuck a little into your pocket. The cops will 
never notice. And if they do they are stuck with the problem! If they don't - 
and they usually don't - Harry's invention allows an activist to stick it to 
the authorities at will. A little bit of glue can go a long way! And the 
authorities aren't likely to forget the day they encountered the sticky 
problem. Long after Gordon Brown has forgotten the precise details of his last 
speech, he'll remember the day a young man superglued himself to his suit. And 
what he was protesting about. Superglue has become a great tool in the the long 
line of creative protest that makes a serious point in a memorable way. Thanks 
Harry.</p> 
<p>Harry Coover - to give him his full title, Dr Harry Coover Jr - discovered 
superglue by accident. In 1952 a researcher named Fred Joyner, who was working 
with Harry Coover at Eastman Kodak's laboratory in Tennessee, was looking for a 
temperature-resistant coating for jet cockpits. When he spread a compound 
between to lenses they became permanently bonded together. Joyner's initial 
reaction was panic at the loss of expensive lab equipment. But Harry Coover 
recognised the potential in the sticky adhesive, namely that it required no 
heat or pressure to bond, and so superglue was born. Since then it has been 
used to strengthen bridges, patch together internal organs of wounded soldiers 
in Vietnam and repair the engine of the space shuttle Discovery And of course 
it's been gold-dust for campaigners.</p> 
<p>Harry Coover - who was 94 when he died - had 400 patents to his name but he 
will be forever remembered for just one - superglue. Support Plane Stupid, 
support superglue, support the downfall of the aviation industry. Stick it to 
them!</p>

<h2> P.E.D.A.L begins its journey </h2>  Submitted by Becky on Tue, 03/22/2011

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>On the weekend of the 20th and 21st March, P.E.D.A.L. began its 100 
day cycle ride atGrow Heathrow in Sipson. The choice of the bicycle as an 
empowering tool is designed to show the need for a life without dependency on 
fossil fuels and unsustainable transport.</strong> <strong>A life where there 
are other options than flying which simply transports you from A to B with no 
appreciation for what is along the way.</strong></p> 
<p>P.E.D.A.L set off on Monday 21st March with a critical mass of cyclists 
leaving from Grow Heathrow and stopping off at significant sites in London 
perpetrating oppression and those in resistance.</p> 
<p>Speakers along the way on the critical mass included Mortaza Sahibzada, the 
managing editor of the Jewish National Fund (JNF) eBook Series and Naomi 
Wimborne Idrisssi, the Secretary of Jews for boycotting Israeli goods. 
Presentations included stories of struggle and hope in the UK relating to the 
Palestine struggle outside the Israeli embassy, outside beauty product store 
Ahava in central London who sell Israeli goods produced from land on illegally 
occupied territories and then at Cable Street - the scene of historic 
anti-fascist and anti-racist riots back in the 1930s.</p> 
<p>The group will be cycling in solidarity with Palestinian and Israeli 
popular resistance movements- responding to the call-out from Palestinian civil 
society in 2005 to support theBoycott, Divestment, Sanctions campaign. The ride 
will trace a trail of corporations complicit in the occupation, pollinate 
information about the campaign and support activists on trial for BDS actions.
</p> 
<p>The final destination is Palestine and along the way they will stop at many 
locations across Europe and the Middle East. The purpose of P.E.D.A.L is to 
highlight the link between social and environmental injustices and how people 
across borders are responding to them in creative and innovative ways. This 
will be seen along the route they as they visit different communities where 
resistance takes positive forms.</p> 
<p>PEDALler Andy Grange said:</p> 
<p><em> &quot;In 2011 we have seen explosions of people power across the 
Middle East. Across the world communities are fighting battles against 
economic, environmental and political injustice. Nowhere more do we see this 
than with the Palestinian people struggling for self-reliance, political 
rights, and liberation. PEDAL begins at an exciting time for popular movements 
fighting back.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>In a decision that makes sense, Leeds/Bradford airport is to be 
left without any flights going to London. Flying short-haul is the single most 
damaging thing an individual can to in terms of your carbon footprint so this 
move has been a long time coming.</strong></p> 
<p>Flybe blame the cancellation of their service to London on increasing 
landing fees at Gatwick but surely this service along with all other domestic 
flight services in the country should be cancelled.</p> 
<p>50,000 passengers flew from Leeds/Bradford airport to Gatwick last year, 
the big majority of those people being the very rich who can afford it. Most of 
us take take the train round the country. The train from Leeds to London KX 
takes just over 2 hours and is 10 times less polluting than flying. Trains not 
planes!</p>

<p></p> 
<p><strong>Our very own Dan Glass from Plane Stupid will be debating live on 
the Guardian website today from 1-3pm. Dan will be arguing that grassroots 
movements are the most effective way of creating change as opposed to top heavy 
methods from big charities. Check out the panel below:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Chris Norman, Strategy Director at The Good Agency @thegoodagency
</strong></p> 
<p>A founding partner of The Good Agency, Chris has worked on social and 
environmental campaigns across not-for-profit, corporate, and government 
sectors for the last 17 years, developing and implementing communications 
strategies to engage stakeholders to motivate behavioural and attitudinal 
change. His experience includes working with ActionAid to tackle issues such as 
conflict diamonds and patent on food; combating discrimination for Age Concern; 
banning wild animals in circuses, fighting intensive farming and irresponsible 
puppy breeding for the RSPCA; with UNISON on public engagement campaigns and 
social and environmental internal engagement campaigns for corporations like 
Mars and Diageo.</p> 
<p><strong>Linda Butcher, Chief Executive at Sheila McKechnie Foundation (SMK) 
@smkcampaigners</strong></p> 
<p>Linda Butcher joined SMK in September 2008, having been active in the 
voluntary and community sectors for more than two decades. From 2001-2008, she 
was Chief Executive of Off the Streets and Into Work (OSW), a charity that

development of the organisation from a London-based programme into an award 
winning, transnational network of organisations and individuals. OSW and CRISIS 
merged in 2010. Linda has also been a member of the London School of Economics 
Research Ethics Committee since 2008.</p> 
<p><strong>Dan Glass, Plane Stupid and So We Stand @planestupid</strong></p> 
<p>Dan organises with grassroots movements 'Plane Stupid Scotland' and 'So We 
Stand', bringing together anti-racism, anti-poverty and anti-climate change 
struggles to take united action.</p> 
<p>He has spent the past five years in inner-city community and youth 
organising in Glasgow, Manchester and London. During this time he has worked 
building strategies for self-defence with communities of colour and 
economically marginalised communities that are disproportionately affected by 
polluting industries. Dan revels in finding ways to be a thorn in the side for 
those destroying the planet including duly occupying airports and dancing with 
old ladies blighted by flightpaths.</p> 
<p><strong>Jenny Driscoll, Senior Communications Manager at Which? </strong>
</p> 
<p>Jenny has been at Which? for over 12 years and have worked on campaigns in 
personal finance, energy, food and health. She has held various positions so
