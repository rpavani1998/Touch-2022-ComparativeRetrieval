<p>With more and more of my money going to fuel, I've been trying to get a bit 
more creative when traveling to nearby states. Riding with folks and splitting 
costs is a great option--but not always practical (I'm not sure how many of my 
friends would actually want to join me on a 3-day trip to western Pennsylvania 
to visit my relatives, although my family is great!)</p> 
<p>Air travel is ok, but, again, you've got rising fuel costs causing inflated 
ticket prices, and a backed-up system that seems to always include flight 
delays, long wait times on the runway, and, of course, an eternity just to get 
through security.</p> 
<p>Recently, I've started seriously looking into traveling by train--it seems 
cheaper, it's better for the environment, and the extra time that it takes to 
travel that way seems worth it, just to reduce my traveling frustrations.</p> 
<p>Amtrak offers some great routes to major cities in the US, and their prices 
are quite good. In the next few months, I'm going to schedule a train trip and 
report back here on my experience. For now, I'd love to hear some feedback on 
other people's experiences with train travel. Here are some of my questions 
(related to Amtrak trains specifically):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Are train schedules fairly reliable?</li> 
<li>Is the extra time worth it, compared to driving or flying?</li> 
<li>As far as getting motion-sick, which is least offensive: flying or riding 
the train?</li> 
<li>Is there a high cost to park your car at the station? Is it safe there?
</li> 
<li>Are the trains clean and comfortable?</li> 
<li>How much room does each person have?</li> 
<li>What are some good resources for information about trains' impact on the 
environment?<br>
</li> </ul> <br>

<p>I am a frequent Amtrak rider and advocate of passenger rail, as well as an 
active member of NC Con Net. Revitalizing intercity passenger rail and rail 
transit is a cause I hope the environmental movement champions to a greater 
degree in the coming years. Moving more people and goods by rail will greatly 
reduce CO2 emissions and engender more centralized development patterns. 
Anyway, here are answers to your questions:<br>
<br>
 1) Trains are often 
delayed, thanks to chronic underinvestment in passenger rail in the US. The 
most frequent direct cause is congestion of freight trains, with which Amtrak 
must share tracks in most of the country. The freight railroads own the tracks, 
and although the law says they must give Amtrak preference, the law is poorly 
enforced. Another cause is equipment failures, which are becoming more frequent 
as Amtrak's equipment ages without sufficient funding for replacement. But 
don't let this discourage you: on-time performance has improved significantly 
over the past year and most delays are less than 2 hours.<br>
<br>
 2) I think 
it's worth the extra time because it's a more enjoyable ride. You can walk 
around freely on a train, socialize with others, and eat in the caf&eacute; or 
dining car, all of which are difficult to do on cars and airplanes.<br>
<br>
 
3) I have never gotten motion sick on a train. I can read a book for hours on a 
train, whereas I start getting dizzy after 15 minutes of reading in a car or on 
a bus, and after about 30 minutes on a plane. Trains offer a very smooth ride, 
except in a few spots where track conditions cause bumps and jolts.<br>
<br>
 
4) Parking is free at all Amtrak stations in North Carolina, but space may be 
limited since ridership has gone up. There have been isolated reports of car 
windows being broken near train stations, but as long as you take the usual 
precautions of not leaving anything valuable in a visible spot in the car, 
it'll be fine. I've left my car at the Greensboro depot for extended periods 
and I've never worried about it.<br>
<br>
 5) Yes. Amtrak has refurbished the 
interiors of most of its fleet. Coach seats recline farther and offer more 
legroom than any airline seat, and overnight trains offer sleeping cars (though 
often at a hefty premium). Bathrooms are generally clean, but be prepared for 
the rare exceptions.<br>
<br>
 6) Coach seats are very spacious, with two seats 
on either side of the aisle. There is more space between each seat on overnight 
trains than on daytime ones, and some seats have footrests. The sleeping 
roomettes are pretty small, but I am 6 feet tall and I can fully recline in a 
roomette bunk.<br>
<br>
 7) A great source for all sorts of information on 
passenger rail issues is the National Association of Railroad Passengers (
www.narprail.org), of which I am a member. For environmental facts 
specifically, see this page orAmtrak's Travel Green page. I hope you enjoy your 
trip and I look forward to reading your impressions of the experience.</p> <br>

 Wow! Thank you so much, Malcolm. I 
really appreciate your feedback on the questions, and the links to Amtrak's 
Travel Green page. I've already checked it out! Hopefully, I'll take a trip to 
either Charlotte or Washington DC sometime in October, and I'll report back 
here then. <br>

<p>I am checking to see if you are the Malcolm who was taking Amtrak and my 
friends &amp; I meet you in a charming hotel when the fire alarm went off. I 
was wondering if you wrote your book??</p> <br>

<p>Mindy,</p> 
<p>I travel by train to Washington DC to visit family. It certainly beats 
driving.</p> 
<p>I can board the train at the Cary train station and travel to Union Station 
in Washington, downtown and close to my family member&rsquo;s office. Parking 
at the Cary station, like the Raleigh station, is free. The trip takes about 
seven hours, about the same as driving if you include a few stops. On the train 
I have a seat that has more leg room than first class on airplanes. I can put 
my lap top computer on the fold down tray and have room to open it, unlike the 
situation on many airline seats. Many of the seats have 110 volt outlets, so I 
don&rsquo;t have to rely on my computer&rsquo;s battery.</p> 
<p>I am free to get up and walk at any time, very important for someone as 
restless as me.</p> 
<p>Most of the time I can find an empty table (or side of a table) in the 
snack car, making it even more comfortable to use my computer. I can usually 
plug in my computer at the table.</p> 
<p>I often ride the TTA bus into downtown Raleigh from the Cary train station. 
On several occasions I have taken Amtrak from Raleigh back to Cary-a rather 
quick trip. It is more expensive than the bus, but I would rather wait inside 
at the Raleigh train station than stand at the bus stop.</p> 
<p>As for your specific questions, I agree with Malcolm&rsquo;s reply. </p>

 This is awesome, John. I'm 
very restless (and a little panicky when confined to tight spaces!) so it would 
be wonderful to have the option to move around a bit. I'm very excited about my 
train trip. Right now, I'm looking at doing a short trip (like to Charlotte) in 
October, just to try it out. If that goes well (which it sounds like it will!), 
my boyfriend and I might try a longer, overnight trip. We were thinking about 
Bangor, Maine just because both of us have heard of it, but know nothing about 
it! I'd like to reclaim my idea of traveling...and allow myself to enjoy the 
traveling itself, as well as the destination and the arriving back home. <br>

<p>Train travel is a great way to travel with children (who get so restless in 
cars). I traveled by train from Charlotte to Raleigh by train with my young 
children (and a couple of other families) for the day just for fun--as a kind 
of &quot;field trip&quot;. It was great fun for the adults and the children. 
Also, I recently traveled from Charlotte to Washington, DC for a long weekend. 
This trip does take longer than by car (1 full day of travel each way) and is 
more expensive, but the children loved being free to roam, play cards, read 
books, watch movies, and I read books and enjoyed the rural scenery. Highways 
are mind-numbingly boring, but trains pass through beautiful rural areas, small 
towns, and interesting urban areas. And once we got to DC we didn't have to pay 
for parking--just walked and took the great transit (and cabs). I wish the 
schedule for Charlotte to Atlanta was more optimal (currently one leg of the 
trip departs @ 2:00am) as I hate the car congestion of that drive especially.
</p> <br>

 Good to know! Charlotte 
and DC are my two most-frequented destinations so that might be one of the 
first trips I try. <br>

<p>I traveled a couple of times across the country by Amtrak from AZ to KY. 
It's expensive; so I did it in winter. Travelling in the West is much different 
than east of Chicago. Western bound trains are less crowded and have an 
observation car with couch type seats that face ceiling to floor windows. Hey, 
it's a beautiful country in winter, too! You travel with the same passengers 
for days. In the dining car, they try to seat your party with other people, to 
encourage socialization. I met European students and retired folk enjoying not 
driving behemoths down the freeways (before gas became prohibitive!). I met 
probably a third of the travelers, between the differing cars. I traveled alone 
and found it quite a social event!</p> 
<p>I was not able to afford a sleeper car; and the seat I was assigned (yes, 
reserved) in the coach car was the most uncomfortable of any I have endured, 
including cattle car style airplanes. So I slept, lying down, on the marginal 
couches of the observation car. A number of other people did this also. I can 
generally sleep well anywhere; this served me.</p> 
<p>The snack car at that time was also a smoking car; fun to hang out in, but 
as a non-smoker, oppressive. These, as you have noted, are in the east, as well.
</p> 
<p>East of Chicago, trains were always more crowded; but still a relatively 
friendly mode of travel. For these long trips, I always took a handwork 
project... something I could work on and talk, watch the gorgeous scenery go 
by. One time I completed a mola (only one I've ever done!) I gave to a friend 
at one end of the trip; another, I worked on an embroidery project.</p> 
<p>I had a great time. Amtrak allows a few open-ended stops (you can get off 
and back on a few days later; your choice of stops). A great,fun, relaxed, and 
social way to see the country! There are 3-4 routes across the country at 
various latitudes. If I could afford it, I'd take all of them, stopping to see 
country, family and making friends all the way across.</p> 
<p>lw wherever you go, there you are</p> <br>

<p>It was a great amtrak ride. The scenery, the food, the service and the 
sleepette were wonderful!!! I will travel east next time.</p> 
<p>I would like to know of other scenic rides.</p> <br>
