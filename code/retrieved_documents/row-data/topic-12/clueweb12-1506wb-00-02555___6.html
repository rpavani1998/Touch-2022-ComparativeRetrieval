<p>The board of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers probably groaned very 
loudly this morning. Just as they were hoping to see sympathetic coverage of 
their latest report, which discusses the importance of getting people to use 
trains, rather than cars, for their journeys, they would have been faced with a 
screaming headline in one of the more hysterical tabloids, fulminating about 
the government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Latest Potty Plan to Clobber Motorists&rsquo;. 
Now there&rsquo;s a neat demonstration of how difficult it is to persuade 
people to change the way they behave when it comes to cars.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As it happens, the headline in question wasn&rsquo;t even about the 
IMechE&rsquo;s report &mdash; it referred to a proposal to introduce toll lanes 
for cars carrying passengers. The IMechE&rsquo;s argument, however good 
intentioned, is likely to lead to even louder howls of protest. The CO2 
emissions from road transport are so high, the report says, that the best way 
to make a serious impact on it is to persuade people that having a high carbon 
footprint is as socially undesirable as drinking and driving or smoking in 
public. People should then be convinced, through information on the smaller 
emissions profile of rail travel and by new pricing policies, to take the train 
where previously they would have driven.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that this is a laudable goal, and far from 
impossible &mdash; take a look at Japan, where the majority of journeys are by 
train. The IMechE doesn&rsquo;t soft-pedal the difficulty of the task, either; 
it says that considerable investment will be needed in new infrastructure, 
including high-speed routes similar to the new Channel Tunnel line, following 
the East Coast and West Coast lines and segregating passenger services from 
freight trains; new rolling stock with WiFi at every seat, to make rail travel 
more pleasurable and productive, and to ensure more frequent and reliable 
services; plus urban planning regimes encouraging high-quality development of 
the areas around railway stations. Recouping that investment while keeping 
ticket prices attractively low would be a serious challenge.</p> 
<p>But where it is underestimating the problem is in the sheer difficulty of 
persuading people to forsake their cars. Why is it that people complain 
bitterly about rail delays but seem to put up with traffic jams, they ask? 
Well, it&rsquo;s because when you&rsquo;re in your car, you&rsquo;re in your 
own environment, with your own comfortable seat, listening to your own music or 
choice or radio station; you can even have a smoke if you want. You don&rsquo;t 
have to put up with other people&rsquo;s mobile phones, unruly children, 
drunken conversations and tinny iPod bleedover, and you never have to stand up 
all the way to Crewe. The psychological connections of car travel and personal 
freedom are very strong in this country. If, as the IMechE recommends, extra 
taxes are introduced to make the cost of driving reflect its environmental 
impact &mdash; such as road pricing, increases in car tax and more fuel levies, 
and a moratorium on the building of new roads &mdash; the howls of indignation 
are bound to reach deafening levels.</p> 
<p>While it&rsquo;s very seductive to think of standard rail travel being an 
equivalent experience to business-class rail travel but a quarter of the cost, 
it&rsquo;s going to take more than environmental arguments and extra taxes to 
get people off the motorway and onto the train. While it&rsquo;s easy to 
persuade people that drinking and driving is immediately dangerous to 
themselves and others, and the arguments about smoking and health are 
overwhelmingly accepted, it&rsquo;s notoriously hard to get people to change 
their behaviour to help the environment; the actions of any one person are very 
small and difficult to gauge against the massive global problem. The IMechE is 
clearly right in its goals, but finding a route to them is going to take 
clever, subtle, innovative and brave thinking by politicians.</p>

<p>I think the I Mech E's stance is very good, however to actually achieve a 
significant shift of people from cars to trains will need many more trains, and 
more track to put them on.<br>
Currently even minor network enhancement to 
accomodate a few more trains seems difficult.<br>
So the bottom line is that 
new high speed rail links are needed now! This will free up capacity on the 
conventional network for the many more local &amp; commuter trains we will need.

<p>Railways should be utilised more fully. Very little more infra-structure is 
needed, just longer trains instead of the unneccessary intensive frequency used 
on many routes. There is plenty of spare capacity.<br>
To improve passenger 
numbers, travel needs to be far cheaper (compared with road and plane travel), 
but more importantly far simpler with the previous principle of walk-on 
reasonable fares and a united railway system and fare structure. The last thing 
needed is fancy Wi FI on board.</p>

<p>Might be missing something here - when did trains become a zero carbon 
footprint mode of travel?<br>
<br>
Again, like government and others, they are 
missing the point. Its not cars, trains or even planes that&rsquo;s the 
problem: it&rsquo;s the sheer number of people on the planet. Yes, real 
polluters are the ones who insist on having more than two children per couple 
&ndash; sometimes the truth is hard, but so is the real world (and nature)!<br>

<br>Don't they do the 'fox and rabbits' on an island experiment any more on 
control system engineering courses...?<br>

<p>The issue with rail travel in the UK is the persisting trend towards patch 
and repair of a system conceived during the Victorian era. Remember, even the 
East Coast Main Line was able to achieve a 126 mph record using a steam train 
in 1938, and yet on the same route trains are limited, today, to 125 mph, and 
even the most recent record was only 154 mph with a modified train! In terms of 
passenger numbers, they are high, and as already acknowledged nearly at the 
absolute maximum capacity that can be achieved.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse, 
the intention to ease this capacity limitation is to move very old stock from 
the West Coast Main Line, limited to 110 mph, thereby reducing the running 
speed to less than 1930's steam trains!<br>
<br>
Yes, propose a new dedicated 
high speed railway to follow the example set my our European neighbours, but do 
not expect to receive the political commitment required, particulary as the UK 
is virtually the most expensive place on this planet to build a railway.<br>

<br>The car remains, the car produces a massive income through fuel duty, 
taxation, etc, giving a very good reason why the motorist will remain a target, 
and why providing a real alternative is not a financially attractive option to 
any UK government.</p>

<p>The arguments in the article are, for my money, right on the mark. I have 
travelled by train and bus to and from work between Huddersfield and Leeds for 
about 2 years before reluctantly reverting to my car. Overcrowded and often 
dirty trains that ran late and sometimes not at all and bus services that 
seemed to run when they felt like it all combined to make the experience less 
than pleasurable. Not that the M62 at rush hour is pleasurable but it can be 
preferrable to the current alternatives. For me it would be improved public 
transport, rather than taxation, that would get me back on trains. The extra 
time spent travelling would be acceptable given reasonably filled trains and 
regular, on-time services. My own travelling time by car is around 80 mins per 
day. By public transport it increases to almost 160 mins. The time and stress 
saved is, for me, worth the increased cost.</p>

<p>Have &quot;we&quot; convinced the people that drink driving and smoking in 
public is unaccaptable ?<br>
<br>
Not from my lofty peak. </p>

<p>Whilst reducing environmental impact is a laudible aim, can we please as 
engineers try to educate the politicians of the fact that CO2 from our drive 
along the road is only part of the story. A life cycle analysis is far more 
sensible. Several recent studies have shown that manufacture, support and 
disposal have a far more serious effect. One recent study even showed that a 4 
litre Jeep Wrangler is nearly 4 times better for the environment than a Prius. 
This is simply because it uses simpler manufacturing methods and should last 
far longer before all of the gimmics become beyond economical repair. If you 
take this to a logical conclusion, 4x4s should in fact pay less tax !</p>

<p>If only that were the whole story. We are undoubtedly a small country 
compared say to the US, but that country long since accepted that to get from A 
to B was a necessity, and being a large country, they have an 
air-infrastructure that works, but only because the astute Yanks have made it 
very simple to Fly &amp; Drive. Car hire is simple, cheap and reliable. The 
systems are in place to get you there and then have a vehicle at your disposal.
<br><br>
In the UK, substitute rail for air and you have a disaster. There is 
no simple way to get from where I live to where I work on a daily basis. The 
only options to cover about 4 miles I have each way are: a) Cycle, which is not 
much fun on a wet, dark winter's day and takes about 30 min. b) Walk, which is 
healthy but takes about an hour and attracts similar comments to a. C) Buses, 
for which I would have to take at least 2. It would also take about an hour. D) 
get in my car, drive about twelve minutes, warm and comfortable.<br>
<br>
When 
I work away from home, usually in a Naval base in the UK, I would love to be 
able to go to Nottingham, pack my bits and pieces in a case, and relax to, say, 
Plymouth, then recover my kit easily and stack it in a waiting van or car, 
possibly a low pollution battery truck or similar. Somehow, I just cannot see 
that happening in the UK, can you? Currently it would take most of a day to get 
me to Plymouth from here in the Midlands, then the task of getting my stuff 
there and hiring a vehicle to get me the four miles to the dockyard from the 
station just makes it an impossible and uneconomical task.<br>
<br>
Government 
needs to take the initiative to install such systems to make it possible to do 
things like this economically, easily and quickly from anywhere in the UK (as 
opposed to just in the capital). Until that time, most of us will clamour for 
the ease and simplicity of sitting in jams, and eventually reaching the 
destination we are aiming for, with everything we need in the vehicle. Any 
other way seems to be doomed to failure at present no matter how many penalty 
charges are inflicted on motorists. Basically the charges get passed on. Prices 
go up and the man in the street ends up paying for the country's inefficiency 
and greed yet again.<br>

<p>The simple fact is that, thanks to successive governments NOT investing in 
public transport over the years - and therefore not providing viable 
alternatives to the car - the public has become used to driving. I have been in 
heavy traffic myself on the M6 in the past and noted with dismay that - while I 
was surrounded by heavy goods vehicles - the goods yard ajacent to the motorway 
was completely still. Why haven't we at the very least got heavy goods onto the 
rail network (which in itself would have freed up a huge amount of capacity for 
cars)? Any why is it that so many major cities overseas have electric trams and 
buses providing commuters with clean and efficient methods of transport while 
we cannot do it here?</p>

<p>I'm sick of hearing about this and that scheme to reduce carbon emissions. 
Put freight back on the railways; congestion on roads would be dramatically 
reduced, there'd be faster and safer journies, less traffic on arterial routes 
and less fuel used. All that seems to be happening at the moment is the petrol 
and diesel cartel, along with government, cashing in on all the hot air. Global 
warming is happening, has happened before and will happen again.</p>
