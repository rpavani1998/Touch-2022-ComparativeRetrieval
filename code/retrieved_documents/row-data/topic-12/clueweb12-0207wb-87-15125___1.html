<p>True or false: taking the commuter train across Boston results in lower 
greenhouse gas emissions than travelling the same distance in a jumbo jet. 
Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is false.</p> 
<p>A new study compares the &quot;full life-cycle&quot; emissions generated by 
11 different modes of transportation in the US. Unlike previous studies on 
transport emissions,Mikhail Chester and Arpad Horvath of the University of 
California, Berkeley, looked beyond what is emitted by different types of car, 
train, bus or plane while their engines are running and includes emissions from 
building and maintaining the vehicles and their infrastructure, as well as 
generating the fuel to run them. (Table 1 on page 3 has a complete list of 
components that were considered).</p> 
<p>Transport studies expert Abigail Bristow of Loughborough University, UK, 
who was not involved in the study, says it is valuable because it attempts to 
compare transport on equal terms. To do this, Chester and Horvath calculated 
how many passengers each train, plane, bus or car would carry in its lifetime 
and how many kilometres it would cover. The pair took into account how much 
each infrastructure component &ndash; such as tracks, roads and airports 
&ndash; is used in its lifetime.</p> 
<p>Including these additional sources of pollution more than doubles the 
greenhouse gas emissions of train travel. The emissions generated by car travel 
increase by nearly one third when manufacturing and infrastructure are taken 
into account. In comparison to cars on roads and trains on tracks, air travel 
requires little infrastructure. As a result, full life-cycle emissions are 
between 10 and 20 per cent higher than &quot;tailpipe&quot; emissions.</p> 
<h3>Empty seats</h3> 
<p>Cars emitted more than any other form of transport with the notable 
exception of off-peak buses, which often carry few passengers. The researchers 
found that travelling 1 kilometre on a nearly empty bus during off-peak hours 
emits eight times more per person than taking the same bus at rush hour &ndash; 
suggesting peak-time commuters may suffer, but they do less harm to the 
environment.</p> 
<p>The occupation level of a vehicle is an important but often-overlooked 
factor, says Chester. &quot;Although mass transit is often touted as more 
energy efficient than cars, this is not always the case.&quot; Buses turned out 
to be the most sensitive to how full they were &ndash; those with only five 
passengers were less efficient than cars; even large SUVs and pick-up trucks.
</p> 
<p>The finding also underlined that electric trains and cars can contribute to 
emissions if the electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels. Passengers 
on the Boston light rail, an electric commuter train, were found to emit as 
much or marginally more than those on mid-size and large aircraft. This is in 
part because 82 per cent of electricity in Massachusetts isgenerated by burning 
fossil fuels.</p> 
<h3>Clearer view</h3> 
<p>The results make it easy to target attempts to cut emissions and could 
change how politicians think about measures to improve transportation, say the 
researchers.</p> 
<p>The life-cycle emissions generated by cars, buses and aircraft are 
dominated by tailpipe emissions pumped out in day-to-day running of their 
engines. Hence, the best way to reduce emissions from these modes of 
transportation would be to increase fuel efficiency and push for renewable 
fuels.</p> 
<p>Crisscrossing the US with a rail network, however, creates a different 
problem. More than half of the life-cycle emissions from rail come not from the 
engines' exhausts, but infrastructure development, such as station building and 
track laying, and providing power to stations, lit parking lots and escalators.
</p> 
<p>Any government considering expanding its rail network should take into 
account the emissions it will generate in doing so, Chester says. Setting up a 
public transportation system that only a small proportion of the population 
uses could generate more emissions than it cuts, he adds &ndash; especially if 
trains and buses are not well connected.</p> 
<p>&quot;New rail systems should serve as links to other transit modes, as is 
often the case in Europe and Japan,&quot; he says. &quot;We should avoid 
building rail systems that are disconnected from major population areas and 
require car trips and parking to access.&quot;</p>

<br>
The best way to reduce emissions from these modes of 
transportation isn't to increase fuel efficiency and the use of renewable 
fuels. It's to reduce the need to use them at all. Policies that encourage 
distant commuters and employers to locate themselves closer together, or to use 
other options such as telecommuting, walking, and cycling, would pay off many 
times over what efficiency and renewable energy could provide.</p> <b>login and

<p>Unfortunately, urban sprawl in one form or another will constantly be with 
us. The need to have children will naturally mean the need to have a backyard 
and personal vehicle - which means a suburban infrastructure. In my personal 
opinion, a backyard is the only way to healthily raise a child in an insecure 
and risk-laden world - and no parent should feel that they need to give up 
career dreams or goals to constantly supervise young children. That being said, 
backyards mean low density. Hopefully, people will leave the suburbs once their 
children have left -- thus keeping a low-density -to- high-density 
recirculation, as necessary - hopefully leading to some reduction in sprawl as 
only those who need a backyard will have one - perhaps a tax-incentive scheme 
to push out childless backyard owners.</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report

<p>Strange! Here in Budapest with a city of 2 million people, the vast 
majority of families bring up their children in apartment complexes and 
generally have a very nice quality of life indeed. There are plenty of parks 
within walking distance of anywhere and excellent transport links throughout 
the city for a low monthly fee.<br>

my country Scotland, who dreams of living in a little flat in Budapest, 
Hungary? I am sure there must be a few out there but you can't help but suspect 
they are a tad masochistic.<br>
<br>
 No, the American suburban lifestyle may 
not be good for the planet but let's be realistic, owning a big house with a 
garden in the suburbs is the ideal for the average Scotsmen and European as it 
is for many Americans.</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report this comment</b>

<p>Many Budapest people would love to have a yard of their own, but it's 
relatively expensive. Houses with gardens cost on average about twice as much 
as apartments per square metre of living space. Incidentally, I've just moved 
back into town from the suburbs.</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report this

<p>Or you can live in a place that is safe enough that you don't have to fear 
that someone runs over your kids or abducts them.<br>
<br>
 Aside from that - 
people live in suburbs because it's a nicer neighborhood to live in - kids or 
no kids. Even the suburbs can be fairly well connected to bus network, if 
people are capable of moving their carcass for that extra half-a-mile to get to 
the bus stop. Works out here in Finland well enough, can't imagine why it 
wouldn't work in sunny California.</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report this

<p>I disagree. The buses in most of Finland suck. They may work adequately 
around Helsinki, but that's the exception to the rule.<br>
<br>
 The routes are 
too long, which means that the wait times are long and then the bus is either 
completely full or almost completely empty. They're almost never on time, which 
means that you have to waste time standing around the bus stop.<br>
<br>
 And 
the fee is rising every year. At the moment, it costs me less money to visit my 
grandparents on a 25 year old banger car that gets something like 23 mpg, and 
the bus ride takes twice as long to get there (not including the wait time).<br>
<br> If I relied on bus service for my daily transportation, I would need to 
put aside several hours a day for just standing around or sitting in a bus, and 
it would double the expenses. For a typical ride that costs 2.70...3&euro; 
(double rates at night), you could go three times the distance on a car on the 
same money with no wait times, no annoying co-passengers, faster and with the 
ability to carry your groceries somewhere else than on your lap.</p> <b>login

<p>I am sorry but there is no such thing as a NEED to have children. There may 
be a desire or a wish but there is no need. Having looked at the state of the 
world I am rather relieved we don't have any as they have only a small chance 
of a decent future considering the state of the planet and the number of 
inhabitants we will have in a few years time with all the constraints on 
resources that come with this. And I will not move from my garden either just 
because I have had the wisdom not to give birth as we grow our food in our 
garden - thank you!</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report this comment</b> <br>

<p>Yes there is a need...as with any species on this planet, the need is 
clearly apparent. That's what all this crap called life is about, passing on 
your genes and survival of the species. No, most people aren't going to die, 
themselves, for not having a child, however, that mentality taken on a large 
scale does little for the species.<br>
<br>
 Unfortunately, it's the thinkers 
and supposedly learned or educated who opt out of having children, while rabble 
such as the 'Octomom' go around popping them out like it's going out of style. 
Now maybe some of those kids will end up being exceptionally smart and a boon 
to society at large and thus the species, but all too often these days the 
children of such parents suffer from poor nutrition, poor education, poor 
supervision and poor health, becoming vampires on the system that was only 
supposed to help them get a foot under themselves, not support them 
indefinitely (I'm all for giving a helping hand, but let's 'teach them to fish 
instead).<br>
<br>
 So, due to a combination of economic condition, attitude of 
self-entitlement and the upper echelon being as far out of touch as they are, 
we're set to be in a bad way as a species in the coming decades...that is if we 
make it that far with psychopathic extremist countries such as N. Korea and 
Iran and their scientific devolution.<br>

<p>&quot;backyards mean low density&quot;<br>
<br>
If you want a backyard for 
your children to run around in, then a quarter acre lot is more than enough, 
and one eighth of an acre is enough if you don't waste it on a front yard. Lots 
of this size are dense enough to ensure transit is viable and prevent sprawl.
<br><br>
 &quot;no parent should feel that they need to give up career dreams 
or goals to constantly supervise young children&quot;<br>
<br>
Why? If you have 
children, then they should be the most important thing in the world to you - 
much more important than the ideal job.</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report

 Do they also count 
all the private,downtown parking lots that will be *eliminated* by trains?<br>

<br> The article also mentions the cost of laying train tracks, but not the 
cost of laying and maintaining asphalt highways. I can't believe a mile of I-95 
is cheaper than a mile of two steel rails.<br>

<p>http://www.sustainable-transportation.com/ lists the paper's abstract and a 
table of the costs they have included. I'm pretty skeptical too, but they do 
seem to be considering at least some of the items you mention (roadway 
construction and lighting, etc). For some reason, I see 'parking lot lighting' 
listed for train stations, but not for airports.<br>
<br>
 I also have a hard 
time imagining that roadway construction and maintenance is less costly than 
railways, but I assume it makes more sense when averaged out over the number of 
users for each?<br>
<br>
Including parking lots for train stations and airports 
does seem a bit dubious to me. Should that not also mean that we'd have to 
include the cost of the train stations and airports into the calculation for 
cars?</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report this comment</b> <br>

<h3>Parking Lots?</h3> 
<p>Tue Jun 09 05:36:38 BST 2009 by <b>esj123</b> </p> 
<p>It all depends on if you are talking about replacing or using existing 
infrastructure. Any time you create new transportation infrastructure, is going 
to be extremely expensive. Suburbia is fairly cheap because taking individual 
properties are not that expensive. Urban properties from expensive because in 
order to run a mile track, you may need to take down a few hundred multi-story 
buildings. If those multi-story buildings will hold tenants, you will have many 
more resources suing you. That threat of legal action may keep any development 
of urban public transportation from happening.<br>
<br>
 Another thing to 
consider is utilisation rates. Highways (and I admit I'm guessing here) may 
have higher utilisation rates because they handle multimodal traffic (passenger 
vehicles, goods transport etc.) are on the clock whereas rail transport has 
relatively low transportation density (i.e. a few trains widely spaced) and is 
only efficient, as this article points out, during peak load.<br>
<br>
 
Roadways are constantly being dug up and repaired because they are used 
constantly. Roadways can be repaired incrementally without significant impact 
on the function of the transportation system which in turn has a lower over all 
cost to the system and it's users. Rail track has onsistently degraded because 
of a lack of investment and a lack of redundancy. If you're going to lay track, 
lay enough track so that you can repair one of the runs for any reason 
whatsoever and not degrade service. We didn't do that. Track was deployed by 
private industry for freight and they went as cheap as they possibly could.</p>

<p>The paper includes 'Roadway construction' and its operation and 
maintenance. It is a significant proportion of the impact of vehicle transport, 
as station and track infrastructure construction and operation is for rail.</p>

<p>It is further interesting how these numbers will change as passenger 
vehicles start using greater amounts of non-carbon sources of energy and more 
of their components and infrastructure are increasingly recyclable. At that 
point the anti-car debate will be revealed for what it is truly: 'a class envy 
and lifestyle issue' rather than a pro-environment issue.<br>
<br>
 Other 
issues which seem to get little press in the 'anti-car' debate are the amounts 
of taxes paid by car owners (likely far higher with higher salaries (likely 
paying much of the public transit burden) and more likely owning their own 
properties and thus more likely to be supporting the lion share of property 
taxes), not to say much of the job creation and technological innovation as a 
direct result of the auto industry. I envision a world where cars can no longer 
be the disproportionate whipping boy of of all that is purported wrong in the 
world and become an effective part of a diverse set of transportation options. 
Moderation and compromise is the key to advancing the fight against unnecessary 
material extraction and ubiquitous pollution - the real villains in today's 
civilized society.</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report this comment</b> <br>

<p>How is this going to happen? There are something like 6 billion people in 
the world right now. Let's say 1 in 10 want a car. How much of the world's 
resources would that use up for something that is used very inefficiently, like 
most of them sit around in car parks all day?<br>
<br>
Even with alternative 
energy sources it seems to pretty damned wasteful and I don't see how you get 
around it. Is this a sustainable lifestyle?</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>

<p>A car, more than any other transportation creations to date is incredibly 
liberating both a personal and economic level. Without a car, you are limited 
to how far you can walk and how much you can carry. Yes, I know with a bicycle 
you can go further but you can carry less unless you're willing to go to the 
hassle of using a trailer but most people aren't being to do that because they 
aren't twentysomethings and they really don't care about bicycles.<br>
<br>
 
With the car, you have a much greater range of economic choices in terms of 
where you work, where you go to school and where you spend your money. You have 
a greater range of choices with medical practitioners. You have a greater range 
of choices in where you live in the kind of property live in. And this choice 
is wonderful. Yes, it makes dark green environmentalists crazy because people 
are making rational choices based on economics not based on somebody else's 
philosophy.<br>
<br>
 What happens if 6 billion people want a car? I'm not 
going to worry about it. We can't even afford to feed 6 billion people but I 
don't believe we should degrade everybody's life down to that of a mud hut and 
a candle. If we can eliminate all forms of poverty and tribalism, then we can 
start talking about supplying people with things like clean water, sanitation , 
and personal transportation. I also believe we should encourage far more use of 
two wheeled vehicles in the form of scooters and motorcycles which give you 
most of the economic freedoms a car does if you build your infrastructure to 
support them. Remember, you can fit more motorcyclists on a roadway than you 
can cars and if you build the motorcycles right, they are far more 
energy-efficient and less polluting.<br>
<br>
 So, I would advocate a car use 
if the car can be made more efficient than public transit because of the 
economic, personal, and societal freedom it brings. Electric cars meet that 
criteria and the sooner we start deploying them the better.<br>
<br>
 For what 
it's worth, the same discussion over individual transportation versus the 
impact it has a society happened with the introduction of bicycles and motor 
scooters. In both cases they were seen as liberating for women because now they 
could transport themselves without having to wait for a big strong man to drive 
them in an automobile or in a horse carriage</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>

<p>If one is at all passionate about transport alternatives and pollution and 
actually want to DO something about it, the &quot;obvious&quot; answer is 
downscale your vehicle(s). Swap your car for a motorbike. Better still a humble 
moped. An emerging solution is to choose an electrically assisted bicycle, and 
for those with shorter journeys, a little self discipline and average physical 
condition, pedal power is still the healthiest and best option for many daily 
journeys.<br>
<br>
 So it is illuminating to notice that in the initial paper 
the only &quot;cycle&quot; mentioned is the life-cycle. A full article in NS, 
and this protracted discussion ranging over nearly every other imaginable form 
of transport also manages to avoid even to mention (motor-)cycling, which 
appears to me to be the single most relevent factor.<br>
<br>
 The term 
'blindingly obvious' could have been coined for this.<br>
<br>
 While its 
widely recognised that car drivers are notoriously blind and insensitive to 
two-wheeled road users, it seems that the mental blind spot is even more 
pervasive.<br>
<br>
 If there is only one thing that you can do to make a 
difference, its surely to leave the car in the driveway and ride the bike more 
often.<br>
<br>
 Or maybe I've been living in holland too long?<br>

<p>Maybe 60 years ago car ownership was a class issue ,but in the 'West' 
,that's long passed. Those that don't have access to cars directly are usually 
volountary abstainers (in cities ,for instance, they are unneccessary and 
innefficient due to clogged roads), children and the elderly.<br>
<br>
 Public 
transport will always be neccesssary for the last two groups ,(yes, and for 
those on the lowest incomes), as long as our lives are so spread out as 
encouraged by car centric society.</p> <b>login and reply</b> <b>report this

<p>The elitism of the homeowner class is showing through with the comment that 
only homeowners pay property taxes. Show me one landlord who does not factor 
property taxes into the rent charged and I will add renters to the list of 
those who do not pay property taxes - the homeless and churches.</p> <b>login
