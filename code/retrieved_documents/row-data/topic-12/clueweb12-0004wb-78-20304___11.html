Tips &gt; Europe &gt; Europe -- By Plane or By Train? <br>

<h2>Europe -- By Plane or By Train?</h2> <br>
Europe's extensive network of 
railroads was once the only affordable option for folks traveling around the 
continent, but lately the rails have lost their supremacy. Discount airlines 
like Ryanair and easyJet have made jetting around the continent quicker and 
cheaper; in fact, Ryanair often offers sales with fares as low as 8 GBP (about 
$13.36 USD).<br>
<br>
 With fares this cheap, does it make sense even to 
consider traveling by train anymore? The answer: It depends. For one thing, the 
discount airlines aren't actually quite as cheap as they appear. Even if you do 
net an incredibly affordable flight, government taxes and fees bump the price 
up to at least $25 or $30.<br>
<br>
 Then come the airlines' own fees. On 
Ryanair, there are so many that the airline has put together a handytable so 
you can see at a glance what you'll be charged for checked bags (with higher 
rates during the summertime and December holiday &quot;peak&quot; periods), 
online check-in, priority boarding, even purchasing a flight (you'll pay an 
&quot;administration fee&quot; of 6 GBP unless you make your booking with a 
MasterCard prepaid debit card).<br>
<br>
 EasyJet charges similar fees for 
checked baggage and for booking with certain types of credit or debit cards.<br>
<br> One more factor to take into account? Discount airlines tend to fly into 
secondary airports that are an hour or more outside of the city you're trying 
to visit. Trains, on the other hand, typically arrive in or near the center of 
town, and usually link up easily with the city's mass transportation system.<br>
<br> We tested fares on easyJet, Ryanair and Rail Europe to see who had the 
lowest price, the most convenient connections and the quickest journey. See 
below to see how each travel provider stacked up on three common European 
itineraries.<br>
<br>
Top 25 Ways to Save on Europe Travel <br>
<br>
London - 
Paris - Rome - London <br>
 This popular itinerary was our first test subject 
sinceLondon is the cheapest gateway to Europe for most Americans. It's 
important to note that London has four different airports, and that most 
Americans will fly into Heathrow or, less commonly, Gatwick. The discount 
airlines, meanwhile, fly from Stansted, Luton or Gatwick,<i>not</i> Heathrow -- 
so be sure to allow plenty of time to transfer between airports if your 
itinerary so requires.<br>
<br>
<b><i>The Winner:</i></b> EasyJet edged out 
Ryanair for first place based on convenience and total travel time. EasyJet 
offers direct flights for each leg of our itinerary, so booking was a breeze, 
and the travel time was a little less than six total hours in the air. The 
price with taxes: $317.94 (if purchased with a Visa Electron card -- which is 
not available to Americans), $332.64 if purchased with a Visa debit card or 
$341.53 (if booked with another type of credit card). These prices include one 
checked bag on each flight, prebooked on the easyJet Web site. (Check your bag 
at the airport and the fee doubles.) EasyJet's site was easier than Ryanair's 
to use, allowing us to search &quot;all London airports&quot; when booking.<br>

<br> <i>Note:</i> For our three flights, we had to fly in and out of six 
different airports -- Charles de Gaulle and Orly (Paris), Luton and Gatwick 
(London), and Fiumicino and Ciampino (Rome). <br>
<br>
<b><i>The Runner-Up:</i>
</b> Ryanair offered somewhat similar pricing to easyJet -- $309.59 with a 
single checked bag up to 15 kilograms (33 pounds) or $376.35 with a single 
checked bag up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) -- but, surprisingly, offered no 
direct flights from London to Paris. Because the search function on Ryanair.com 
won't make connections for you, we were forced to try out a variety of 
connecting cities one by one. We found the best deal on flights from London 
Stansted to Glasgow Prestwick and then on to Paris Beauvais, but the extra 
flight and layover boosted our total travel time significantly. A few other 
caveats: Beauvais is probably the least convenient airport for Paris-bound 
travelers, requiring a shuttle bus ride of over an hour to get into the center 
of the city. And while Ryanair.com was easy to use, there was no option to 
search all London airports; instead, we had to test each of the three 
individually.<br>
<br>
<b><i>The Loser:</i></b> The train was the clear third 
choice for this itinerary since the cities involved are so far apart. The total 
estimated time of all three legs was a vacation-eating 28 hours -- and the 
price couldn't compensate for the transit time, adding up to $412 per person.
<br> <br>
Discount Airfare Deals <br>
<br>
Rome - Florence - Venice - Rome <br>

 This itinerary is a common one for first-time visitors interested in seeing 
Italy's highlights. We assumed here that our test traveler flew from the United 
States into Rome, usually the cheapest Italian gateway city for Americans. 
Because of the relative proximity of the three cities involved, this turned out 
to be a much more train-friendly itinerary than our first test case.<br>
<br>

<b><i>The Winner:</i></b> Eurail won this round by a landslide, offering the 
shortest trip and most convenient itinerary. The lowest available price was 
$137 for this itinerary, with a travel time of 12 hours. Cut the travel time 
down to seven hours (by taking high-speed express trains) and the price goes up 
to $313. Eurail was the only option of the three that served all three of the 
cities we wanted to visit (Ryanair and easyJet fly into Pisa, not Florence). 
One final perk of taking the train? In most cases you'll arrive at a train 
station near the center of each city, with quick, easy connections by subway to 
hotels and sightseeing.<br>
<br>
<b><i>The Runner-Up:</i></b> Neither airline 
really shone in this comparison, with no direct flights between any of the 
cities on our itinerary. However, Ryanair gets our vote for runner-up because 
we did eventually manage to piece our itinerary together with 17 hours of 
flights and layovers. (That doesn't even take into account how early you need 
to arrive at the airport before your flights to get through security!) The 
initial fare quote was $298.82 for six flights -- 65 bucks more than the fast 
trains -- and that's not including the checked bag fees. Checking a single bag 
for all of those flights will set you back an additional $222.36 to $266.52 
(depending on weight and whether you travel during peak or off-peak seasons), 
for a total price up to $565.34.<br>
<br>
<b><i>The Loser:</i></b> EasyJet 
loses out because we couldn't find a way to get between Pisa andVenice on our 
selected travel date; we tried layovers in several different cities, but the 
flight times were simply incompatible. Our only choice would have been to stay 
overnight in the connecting city -- or to have skipped Florence altogether and 
just flown on the convenient, nonstop flight from Rome to Venice.<br>
<br>

Discount Train Deals <br>
<br>
Paris - Barcelona - Lisbon - Paris <br>
This 
itinerary is a bit less common than our first two, and it proved impossible to 
book on Ryanair, which doesn't offer flights to Lisbon. We used Paris, another 
common gateway for U.S. travelers, as a starting point. Because the cities are 
relatively far apart, this itinerary favored easyJet over Eurail.<br>
<br>
<b>
<i>The Winner:</i></b> EasyJet came out on top with an affordable total cost 
($304.90 if booked with a Visa debit card or $313.79 with a non-Visa Electron 
credit card) and direct flights for all three legs. The fare above includes a 
single checked bag of no more than 20 kilograms.<br>
<br>
<b><i>The Runner-Up:
</i></b> Rail travel comes in at a distant second place, at $481 for a Eurail 
Select Pass, which allows five days of train travel in three countries and is 
several hundred dollars cheaper than booking point-to-point tickets. We added 
up a total of about 47 hours of travel time. While that's significant, keep in 
mind that overnight trains are an option; these allow you to save time (and 
money on a hotel room) by traveling while you sleep.<br>

Eurail Passes <br>
<br>
<b><i>The Loser:</i></b> Ryanair is the loser by 
default, as the airline doesn't fly to Lisbon. It does fly elsewhere in 
Portugal, to Porto and Faro, both about three hours away from Lisbon by train. 
Ryanair flies direct between Paris Beauvais andBarcelona's main international 
airport -- but Beauvais is more than an hour by bus from downtown Paris.<br>

<br> The Bottom Line <br>
 We learned quite a few things in the oft-laborious 
process of testing all these itineraries -- first, that finding a good deal 
takes time! Though easyJet.com, Ryanair.com and RailEurope.com are relatively 
easy sites to use, it often takes a bit of manipulation to get the itinerary 
you want, especially when connections are involved.<br>
<br>
 Our second lesson 
was that although discount airlines may be on the rise, you shouldn't dismiss 
the train option altogether. Particularly for itineraries where the cities 
aren't far apart, the train may still be your most economical and even your 
quickest choice. However, the more distance your itinerary covers, the more 
appealing a plane is likely to look (unless you're willing to consider 
overnight trains).<br>
<br>
 You might also want to consider combining your 
options. EasyJet may offer the cheapest fare for the first leg of your trip, 
but the next leg may be better served by train. If easyJet doesn't fly to your 
city of choice, there's a chance Ryanair might. To search more than one 
discount airline at a time, try SkyScanner.net, which shows you estimated 
prices for routes within Europe on various airlines including Ryanair, easyJet, 
bmi, Aer Lingus and more.<br>
<br>
Tips for Finding Cheap Airfare <br>
<br>
 
Finally, ultra-cheap flight offers aside, beware of the many hidden costs that 
could significantly boost your price tag -- everything from baggage fees and 
credit card surcharges to the price of transferring from one London airport to 
another. Keep in mind that flights may look shorter on paper, but you'll also 
spend more time going through security and transferring into the city you're 
visiting than you would for a journey on the rails.<br>
