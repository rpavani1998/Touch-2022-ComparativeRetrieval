<h1> What to Bring to India </h1> <br>

<p>Vraja Mandala&nbsp;Parikrama 2009 Edition<br>
by Kishore Krishna Dasa 
(updated byThis e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need 
JavaScript enabled to view it)</p> 
<p>This page is subject to further revision and update.<br>
Here is a list of 
articles that I have found useful to bring to India. This list was created with 
the help of Brahma Muhurta dasa (ACBSP) an India veteran, and has been refined 
over the last five years or so and has been useful to many devotees, so they 
tell me anyway&hellip;</p> 
<p>I used to be a Boy Scout, and their motto is &quot;Be Prepared&quot;. Some 
say I am over-prepared. I have tried incorporate only the most practical and 
useful items on this list. Items which are optional are on the optional list. 
Times are a-changing in India. It is possible to buy things there now that you 
couldn't buy five years ago, especially in Mathura, Vrindaban, and the touristy 
areas of New Delhi. You can come to India and do OK without ANY of this stuff 
(except maybe the mosquito repellent), but I'm assuming that you want to come 
prepared and not spend your time searching high and low for things you could 
have bought at K-Mart.</p> 
<p>I've tried to make this shopping business less laborious. If you click on 
the pictures below, (usually) you will come to the web sites of one of the 
places that sell these items online and ship them directly to your door in the 
USA, mainly CVS Pharmacy, EMS Sports, WalMart and K-Mart.</p> 
<p>Here's the whole list with hyperlinks to the particular item.</p> <strong>

<br> 
<p><strong>Stationery items</strong><br>
<strong>Notebook and Pen</strong><br>

A small notebook, blank book, or diary will be useful for taking notes. 
Sturdily bound notebooks with good quality paper are hard to find in India.<br>

<br> <strong>Laundry Marker Pen</strong><br>
Parikrama is like a trip to summer 
camp. Having you name on your bags will make it easier to travel with them. 
It's helpful if all of your cloth has your initials on it somewhere since many 
gamshas and all white dhotis look alike. Mark dhotis in a corner and turn 
kurtas inside-out and mark the pockets on the inside. They dry faster if you 
hang them up this way as well.<br>
<br>
<strong>Photocopies<em><br>
</em>
</strong>Once you've gotten your India Visa, you should make three copies each 
of the photo page (the inside cover which has the passport number and photo) 
and the page that has the India Visa. Leave one set at home. Keep one set with 
your luggage separate from your passport and plane tickets. The third set is 
for the Parikrama registration formalities.<br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> If your 
visa is valid for more than six months you are supposed to register with the 
Foreigner Registration Office, which is located in Mathura within two weeks of 
arriving in India, though you can probably get by without doing this if you are 
only visiting India for a month. You may not have to register if you have a 
multiple entry tourist visa and leave India within 180 days.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Recommended Reading<br>
</strong></em><br>
<em>Rough Guide 
Hindi (and Urdu) phrasebook</em> (ISBN: 185828922X )<br>
Full of very practical 
and useful dialogue examples and tips. A little Hindi goes a long way and the 
Indian people always appreciate the effort.<br>
<br>
<em>Spiritual Guides - 
Holy Places and Temples of India</em> (ISBN 0965385809)<br>
by Jada Bharata Dasa
<br>An excellent guidebook. Many practical and useful tips and information 
about many temples and places in India not found in other travel guides. More 
information and names of additional places to buy the book are available on 
theirwebsite.<br>
<br>
Optional<br>
<br>
<em>Lonely Planet - India</em> (ISBN 
1864502460)<br>
Worth considering, especially if you can't lay your hands on a 
copy of<em>Spiritual Guides</em> (above). The hotel phone numbers are more 
current in this guide than in<em>Spiritual Guides</em>.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>
Clothing</em></strong></p> 
<p><em><strong>Absent from this edition are items pertaining to cold weather. 
If you are traveling on an Air-Conditioned train, you might want to bring some 
warm clothing, a hat, a chaddar, and a pair of socks, because the AC can be a 
bit too cold at times.</strong></em></p> 
<p>There are two things that Indians always check out. The first thing is your 
shoes, the second is your watch. Best is you don't wear either one! But second 
best is to have unattractive sandals, well broken in, and a cheap watch. Some 
devotees keep their watch in their bag or waist pack, not on their wrist.<br>

<br> <strong>Teva or Reef sandals</strong><br>
 Plain black don't seem to get 
stolen.<br>
I like the Reefs, because they are cheaper than the Tevas, plus the 
back strap is Velcro and comes off completely. This makes it very convenient to 
step in and out of your sandals to pay obeisances and enter temples without 
touching your shoes. (You have to wash your hands if you do this).</p> 
<p>Reefs are hard to find in stores (or out of season) and these seem to have 
been discontinued altogether. A pity. You can find a store that sells Reef 
products atReef's Web Site . Ask for the &quot;Reef Convertible 692&quot;. Even 
though they are discontinued, they may still have some.<br>
<br>
With any 
footwear, it is wise to separate them when you take them off which makes it 
hard for anyone to mistakenly take them or steal them.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Inexpensive Wristwatch</strong>.<br>
The cheaper the better. This is the tried 
and trueCasio F-91W, which is pretty much the bottom of the Casio line.</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
<strong><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</strong> <strong>Dhotis and Kurta 
(or Saris)<br>
</strong>I would suggest bringing three sets. Obviously you can 
just was easily buy these in India (No, really?) but the parikrama is a bit 
hard on your clothing and you might want to figure on sacrificing your existing 
cloth and buy new stuff on your way out of India. This way you're not all 
mental about wrecking your cloth by paying obeisances in the dust.</p> 
<p> <strong>Underwear and Socks<br>
</strong>Three or four sets of underwear. 
Socks are optional because they get dirty just about instantly and are hard to 
wash by hand (even with thelaundry brush), so you might only want to wear them 
while sleeping e specially if you are planning to sleep in a tent. In the 
Gaudiya Math, kaupins are part of the sanyassa dress only, so bring the BVDs.
</p> 
<p><strong>Drugstore (Chemist) items</strong></p> 
<p>A few of these items seem to be particular to the USA.<strong><br>
<em>f<br>
</em></strong><strong> Fever Thermometer</strong><br>
&nbsp;Try it out when you 
are healthy so you know how it works. Electronic ones that are easy to read and 
don't contain mercury have come way down in price.<br>
&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Kaopectate or Pepto-bismol tablets<br>
</strong> <br>
Good for 
soothing the travel weary tummy or for a moderate case of the runs especially 
if taken before meals<strong>.</strong><strong><br>
<br>
<br>
</strong><strong> 
Ibuprofen</strong></p> 
<p> <strong>Visine eye drops<br>
<br>
</strong> Are useful for refreshing your 
eyes if they get sore from travelling or the sun.</p> 
<p><strong> Band Aids (plasters)</strong> &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Indian bandaids (plasters) are straight from the 1940's and not 
&quot;ouchless&quot; when you take them off.</p> 
<p> <strong>Antiseptic cream (Neosporin)<br>
</strong>The first line of 
defence against infection from cuts that in the west would never become 
infected. Well stocked chemists (pharmacies) in India have something similar.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong> Mosquito repellent</strong> <br>
Repellents containing DEET such 
as Cutters or Deep Woods OFF in a spray can are the most useful.<br>
<br>
I 
would not recommend the 100% DEET that you can find in camping stores.<br>
DEET 
is a heavy chemical, and should not be applied directly to the skin if possible.
<br>I suggest bringing a spray can for spaying on clothing such as a chaddar 
and socks and (if you can find it) a bottle of non-deet repellent</p> 
<p>There are a whole range of repellent products discussed here.</p> 
<p>Some devotees swear by Tea Tree oil and other non-DEET repellents. I can't 
say for sure it is as good or not. I say &quot;stick with what works&quot;.<br>

<br>One brand which contains DEET that I like and have used for years is called 
&quot;Sawyer's Controlled Release Lotion&quot;. It has a special formula that 
doesn't soak into your skin (much) and is highly effective when applied to bare 
skin on the neck and hands.<br>
I've always found it in good outdoor shops</p> 
<p><strong> Sunglasses</strong></p> 
<p><strong> &nbsp;Laundry clips (pegs)</strong> <br>
The wooden ones are 
better than the plastic ones. I usually have about twenty, because a few will 
invariably go missing.</p> 
<p> <strong>Small scrub brush (nail brush)</strong> <br>
<br>
For cleaning 
feet and hand-washing clothes .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Pumice stone</strong><br>
<br>
Good for buffing off calluses, 
especially on the heel, otherwise after a while they crack, which is painful.
<br><br>
&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Petroleum Jelly<br>
</strong>Applied to feet (after washing, 
especially before bedtime) it helps prevent cracks.</p> 
<p> <strong>Toothbrush</strong> <br>
<br>
<strong>Toothpaste</strong><br>

Bring your own if you can't bear the thought of using Crest or Colgate.<br>
<br>
<strong>Shampoo or Body Wash</strong><br>
Bring what you like. Some western 
brands are available (for western prices) in India.</p> 
<p> <strong>Razor/Shaving Cream</strong><br>
If you want to skip shaving 
altogether, fine. If the grunge look isn't you, bring your razor and shaving 
cream, though both are available. You can visit a barber before you leave and 
they can give you a haircut as well for about Rs13 (25 cents).</p> 
<p> <strong>Hair brush or comb</strong></p> 
<p> <strong>Fingernail clippers</strong> (don't carry on the airplane)</p> 
<p> <strong>Nail file</strong> (don't carry on the airplane)</p> 
<p> <strong>Tweezers </strong>(don't carry on the airplane)<br>
You don't 
really need them if you have one in the Swiss army knife.</p> 
<p> <strong>Earplugs<br>
</strong> India is a noisy place. Also, if you are 
sharing a room with several devotees, chances are that you will be paired with 
a snorer. Actually, anyone who sleeps on their back must snore, it's an 
anatomical certainty.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Small folding umbrella</strong><br>
Keeps off the sun as well as 
the rain.</p> 
<p> <strong>Alkaline batteries</strong><br>
Can be found in cities and tourist 
areas.</p> 
<p> <strong>Camera batteries</strong><br>
Flash photography really runs them 
down quickly. You won't find them easily in India.</p> 
<p> <strong>Film</strong><br>
Good film is also available in India. Sometimes 
shops give a discount for processing film bought from them. A 24 exposure roll 
of Kodak (made in USA) ASA 100 only costs about $2.40 in India.</p> 
<p> <strong>Travel Alarm Clock</strong></p> 
<p> Again, the cheaper, the better. Digital is better than analogue (tick tick 
tick) since the clock is going to be about a foot from your head most of the 
time.</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Laundry bag</strong><br>
An extra pillowcase works fine for this.
</p> 
<p> <strong>Box of wash-and-dry or alcohol wipes</strong><br>
Useful for hand 
washing hands and under the fingernails before eating or after using the 
toilet. VERY handy for the parikrama. When prasadam is served on the parikrama, 
there is usually nowhere to wash your hands before taking prasadam. Also handy 
for cuts and scrapes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; <strong>Washcloth</strong><br>
It's quite important to keep your 
skin clean in India, and washing diligently with soap and a washcloth may help 
avoidboils and help them from spreading if you are unlucky enough to get one. 
See theHealth Page for more about this.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <strong>Prescription 
Eyeglasses</strong><br>
It would be a good idea to have a spare pair as well as 
monkeys like to steal them and in a parikrama situation, it's pretty easy to 
break them. You can get them replaced pretty cheaply in India, so it might be a 
good idea to bring a copy of your prescription.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <strong>
Feminine Hygiene Supplies<br>
</strong>According to several leading India 
guides, ladies should bring an adequate supply from home to avoid 
disappointment with Indian products.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <strong>Prescription 
Medication</strong><br>
Though most medicines are available in India (usually 
far less costly than in the west) if you are taking any prescription medicine, 
be sure to bring an adequate supply for your stay in India.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Optional -<br>
</strong> <strong>Anti-Malaria Medicine</strong> <br>
See the 
Heath Page for more about this.<strong><br>
</strong> <strong>Sunscreen Lotion
</strong><br>
Might be more useful for kids than adults. I prefer a chaddar.<br>
<strong>Zip-Lock Bags</strong><br>
Useful for bringing home mahaprasad from the 
dham, also for protecting papers and carrying laundry powder.<br>
<strong>
Anti-Fungal Cream</strong> <br>
Useful for clearing up fungal infections 
especially on the feet. This is mainly a problem in hot weather (Gour Mandal 
Parikrama).</p> 
<p><strong><em>At a Hardware Store<br>
</em></strong><br>
<strong> Heavy Duty 
Combination locks</strong> <br>
Useful for dharamsalas. No key to carry around 
and lose. Four settable digits.<br>
The recombo feature is handy so that you 
can change combos when you change roommates.<br>
<br>
Note: You should avoid 
using anyone's birth year as the combo, because that reduces the number of 
possible combinations from 10,000 to about 30!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p>Useless</p> 
<p>Not secure at all.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Good</p> 
<p>Master Model 155 Combination lock with Recombo key. Costs about $14 at Home 
Depot SKU: #424250</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Best</p> 
<p>Master Model 177D<br>
Same as 155 but more secure. You may need to call 
around for this one.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<p> <strong>Heavy duty Cable-type chain</strong><br>
 If you plan to make any 
train journeys in India, this is useful with your lock (above) for securing 
your luggage under the seat of the train.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Plastic-Coated Steel Laundry Line<br>
</strong>You can get cheap 
plastic line in India, but the advantage of plastic-coated steel laundry line 
is that it doesn't stretch when you load it up with wet dhotis and drag your 
laundry all over the ground. Sells for &pound;1 at the Pound Land stores in 
England.</p> 
<p><strong><em>At a Camping Store</em></strong></p> 
<p> <strong>Daypack or Shoulder bag</strong> <br>
A black or a dark color is 
best. Alternatively, in Vrindaban, the shops in Loi Bazaar sell good cloth 
shoulder bags (sastra bags) which are good for carrying your note book, water 
bottles, etc. You should never carry your shoes in such a bag however because 
they are considered dirty.</p> 
<p> <strong>Self Inflating Mattress</strong><br>
Staying at a dharamsala means 
sleeping on concrete. Thermarest mattresses have been around for decades and 
are simply the best and are guaranteed for life. In practice they last for 
years and years of daily use with minimal care.<br>
For the economy-minded, the 
closed cell foam pads are available in any K-Mart or sporting goods store for 
$6-$12 and are OK if you don't mind how thin they are. For the real renunciate 
there is the genuine Indian woven plastic sleeping pad which can be bought in 
the market for about Rs30.</p> 
<p> <strong>Waist Pack or Money Belt<br>
</strong> The smaller and plainer the 
better. Good for carrying your rupees, swiss army knife, bandaids, alcohol 
wipes, etc. Hopefully you will have left all of your valuables like passport, 
plane tickets, and most of your cash with the parikrama organisers for safe 
keeping at the beginning of the parikrama. Carrying those things around will 
just leave you in needless anxiety, and every year devotees who don't heed this 
advice end up trooping off to Delhi to try to get them replaced.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Sleeping Bag</strong> </p> 
<p>(It is highly unlikely that you will be needing a sleeping bag in the 
Navadvipa parikrama at the end of March, which is just before summer sets in. A 
sheet or a chaddar will certainly suffice.)</p> 
<p>I bought the LaFuma &quot;One Kilo&quot; for about $85 in a camping store 
in Berkeley, California.<br>
<br>
It's a very compact and light bag and may be 
good for a train trip, especially in an AC coach, which tends to be too cold at 
times.<br>
<br>
The filling is Thinsulate&reg; which is something you might 
look for in another bag. This is an item you might pick up used on eBay or in a 
classified advert and it's machine washable. Cheap bags that you can find for 
$25 in discount stores are likely to be much heavier and bulkier, but if you 
want to save some money those might be worth considering.&nbsp; You might be 
better off with awool chaddar or simply a sheet or dhoti.</p> 
<p> <strong>Small pillow</strong> <br>
I use a washable throw pillow that I 
bought for $1. Some devotees use the inflatable type sold at camping stores. I 
haven't seen any small pillows in India, only huge hard foam slabs</p> 
<p> <strong>Something For Soothing Mosquito Bites</strong></p> 
<p>I used to recommend &quot;After Bite&quot; (found in camping shops) which 
takes the sting and itch out of bug bites. It worked just fine without the
<strong><em>Mink Oil</em></strong> they now put in it! Here's another product 
that seems to do the same thing. Benadryl and Caladryl cream are sometimes 
effective as well.<br>
Available in many camping stores. Sorry, this picture is 
not clickable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Eveready Camping Flashlight (Torch)<br>
</strong><br>
&nbsp; 
Converts from a flashlight (Torch) to a lantern. When the batteries are fresh, 
this casts a very bright beam, however it goes through batteries quickly (takes 
four AA's) so bring extras. Good for spotting marauding mosquitoes inside your 
net/tent and very handy for the toilet and shower which seem to be popular 
targets for light bulb thieves.&nbsp; Available in many discount, hardware, and 
camping stores.<br>
<br>
Sorry, this picture is not clickable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Genuine Swiss Army Knife<br>
<br>
</strong> There's nothing worse 
than a dull knife. This one has most of the extra features you will need 
including tweezers and is similar to the one I used for years. My new knife has 
computer tools built into it but costs a lot more than this one. Be sure to 
pack it with your checked-in luggage.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Optional -<br>
</strong> <strong>Mosquito Net<br>
</strong>There 
are lots of other bed-nets availablehere though you can buy ones that are just 
as good in India for less money. If you are joining the parikrama in a small 
town like Varsana, it would be a good idea to bring one with you. If you are on 
a tight budget, you can buy perfectly good ones in India in most places for Rs 
120 or so (about $3). They come in single and double sizes. If you want to come 
prepared, you can buy them at K-Mart for about $8. You will need some string to 
set it up, so bring some with you. You will want to take some precautions 
against being bitten through the net. I usually place some dhotis around the 
inside which gives a bit more room and solves the problem.<br>
<br>
For years 
now devotees have been buying freestanding mosquito nets. They are a bit 
pricey, starting at $50 and ranging up to $110. The primary advantage is that 
there is no &quot;stringing up&quot; the net, which is usually a challenge as 
there need to be places to tie the strings. There is also the problem of 
ceiling fans disturbing the net and of devotees walking into the strings and 
hanging their laundry on them. There are two basic styles of freestanding 
mosquito nets, one has a floor and a zipper and the other doesn't.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;This model is called the Bed-tent, and is bed-sized, but can be used on 
the floor or even outdoors. It has shock corded poles and is easy to setup and 
take down. It only comes in one mesh type, fine mesh, and a floor which keeps 
out everything including bed-bugs (sometimes a problem in hotels and in 
dharmsalas with beds, but not on the parikrama). It comes in a one or two 
person size. It also has mosquito-proof fabric at the base which prevents you 
from getting bitten through the net (especially on the feet, knees, elbows, and 
especially the knuckles. Ouch, that hurts! Time for the Sting-eze!) It has a 
little zippered expansion panel at the foot end which accommodates taller 
devotees. It might be a bit warmer than the other models, but it has proven to 
be the most popular with devotees and is recommended.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; This model is the lightest and least expensive, but is a bit more 
challenging to setup as you have to fit the fibreglass poles together without 
them falling apart. It is also bed-sized, and&nbsp; comes in a one or two 
person size. Unlike the Bed-Tent it comes in a choice of regular and fine mesh. 
It does not feel as confining as the bed-tent and it works fine against 
mosquitoes so long as you are not too tall. It won't stop bed-bugs, and the 
lack of mosquito proof material at the bottom means that you still have to take 
some precautions against being bitten through the net. These models are 
available fromone place in the USA and one place in the UK.<br>
<br>
These are 
a bit longer than bed-sized (9 inches longer) which is a problem if you 
actually want to use it on a bed (in a hotel in Delhi or somewhere) but 
advantageous if you're taller than about 5 feet 10 inches. The width is about 
the same as the one above which means that you still have to take some 
precautions against being bitten through the net. It comes in a choice of 
regular and fine mesh. They have shock corded poles, which add a bit to the 
weight, 22 ounces instead of 16, but are well worth it. It used to come in a 
two-person model, but that one is discontinued. There is a different two-person 
model on offerhere which might be a good choice.<br>
<br>
<strong>Permethrin 
Mosquito Net Dip</strong>&nbsp; <br>
Permethrin Mosquito Repellent dip repels 
mosquitoes that would like to bite you through your net or tent. I have used 
this for the past two years and it worked really well. One bottle has enough 
permethrin to treat several nets and each treatment lasts for six months or 
until you wash the net. For the bed-tent there is a permethrin spray which does 
the same thing.</p>

<strong>Duffel Bag</strong> <br>
The most practical solution for 
carrying all of your necessary articles to and from India. Soft bags are 
preferable to hard suitcases especially for traveling by train. The most 
popular-sized hard suitcases barely fit under the seats on the train. Some will 
not fit at all. For the same reason, two small bags are preferable to one large 
bag. BesidesK-Mart, one place that seems to have decent luggage-quality (i.e. 
more expensive) sport duffel bags iseBags. The advantage of a sport duffel bag 
is that getting things out of it is easier than a top-loading bag (pictured). 
The bag I use is a genuine US Army issue duffel bag with straps like the one 
here. The advantage of the straps is that you can wear it like a backpack 
instead of carrying it though it had a handle if you want to do that. It also 
does not look flashy and has the possibility of locking using a large luggage 
lock or small padlock at the top. The ones I foundonline are already 
&quot;broken in&quot; (by the Korean Army no less) and only cost $7.</p> 
<p><strong>Things to get when in India</strong></p> 
<p><strong><em>At the chemist (that's what the pharmacy is called)</em>
</strong></p> 
<p> <strong>Anti-Malaria medicine<br>
</strong>If you want to do this. See the 
Travel Health page.<em><strong><br>
</strong></em><strong><em><br>
At the cloth 
shop</em></strong></p> 
<p> <strong>Light Chaddar<br>
</strong>This is really optional at is it likely 
to be warm (or even hot) during the parikrama, even at night.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Light Cotton Chaddar<br>
</strong>For keeping the sun off. 
When sprayed with mosquito repellent every other day or so, it keeps them off 
as well. They come in pairs, which should be sufficient.<br>

<strong>Gamshas</strong><br>
You will need two or three gamshas for the 
bathroom. Terry Cloth Bath towels are useless, so leave them at home. A gamsha 
is a thin, plaid (usually) cloth that is generally knee length. It is used for 
bathing and in India especially, one should always bathe clothed. Ladies must 
also cover the upper body at all times as well especially if bathing outdoors 
or in a river. Ladies should take the advice of senior ladies on this point. 
Gamshas can go missing, so it's best to have an extra. The gamsha used to dry 
is used to wash next time. In Bengal they sell the same style favored by 
devotees. In Navadwip dham, there is a yet another type of gamsha which is 
ankle length and has a larger plaid pattern. These are often sold on the 
street, and are mainly worn by Muslims, so are best avoided. Proper gamshas an 
be found in cloth shops. NOTE: Gamshas are not &quot;color-fast&quot;. A new 
gamsha will &quot;bleed&quot; color for a long time when used or washed, so be 
careful not to wash it with your other cloth.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>At the market
</em></strong> <br>
<br>
<strong>Cheap slip-on sandals</strong><br>
For the 
bathroom. Sometimes called flip-flops.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mosquito Net</strong>
<br>If you don't have one already. In Hindi it's called a &quot;Macchar 
Dhani&quot;.</p> 
<p> <strong>Plastic Bucket and Lota</strong> <br>
For washing clothes and for 
bathing . A plastic lota looks like a measuring cup.</p> 
<p> <strong>Washing powder</strong><br>
Save an empty film canister and put a 
little laundry powder in it for plate washing after meals.</p> 
<p><strong>Metal Dinner Plate and Cup (Thali and Lota)</strong><br>
A thali is 
a round plate with about one inch tall sides. This lota is a steel drinking 
cup. Both are inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to clean. A spoon is optional.
<br><br>
Note: In India, practically everyone eats with their fingers, and 
using the right hand ONLY. (Remember those Alcohol wipes? Be sure to clean 
under your finger nails). Normally, the left hand is not used AT ALL at the 
time of eating, so it stays clean for collecting your belongings, opening 
doors, turning on faucets, etc. until the right hand is thoroughly washed after 
eating. For those who lack dexterity or cultural flexibility, use of a spoon is 
permitted but the right hand still must be washed after eating and is 
considered unclean until then. Time was that eating with a spoon was frowned 
upon, but they seem to have gotten over it. The primary advantage in eating 
with your fingers is that it is impossible to burn your mouth (you burn your 
fingers instead).</p> 
<p> <strong>Laundry Line</strong><br>
If you didn't bring one, plastic rope is 
sold by the meter. Very inexpensive .</p> 
<p> <strong>Bottled Water</strong><br>
All real bottled water has a 
tamper-evident neck seal that breaks when you open it. Most shops are 
reputable, some vendors on the trains are not. Check the seal before you pay. 
If the seal is broken, hand it back and ask for another bottle. Larger bottles 
are now available, though sometimes with a returnable deposit.<br>
