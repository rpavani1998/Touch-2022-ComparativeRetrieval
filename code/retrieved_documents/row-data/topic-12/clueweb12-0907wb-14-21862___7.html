<h2>What is e-learning? An empirical approach</h2> 
<h2></h2> 
<p>Dokeos offers e-learning consulting based on the analysis of experience and 
best practices.</p> 
<p>Our clients often ask what e-learning is and what can be considered <i>true
</i> e-learning. Here is an attempt to define e-learning the empirical way and 
propose a synthetic table of possible online learning activities. The article 
was originally published onKnol. </p> 
<h2>Some observations<br>
</h2> 
<p>Since internet and multimedia boomed in the nineties, intellectual practice 
has evolved. People:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>learn alone in online courses or CD-Roms through a combination of theory 
and practice;</li> 
<li>collaborate remotely on Wikipedia to write a collective paper on a 
dedicated topic;</li> 
<li>alternate face-to-face contacts and online interaction with a trainer or 
coach;</li> 
<li>read online tutorials and practice alone; </li> 
<li>look for the answer to their questions in Google&reg;; </li> 
<li>write blogs and try to clarify their own mind with the help third party 
comments;</li> 
<li>practice guitar by imitating Youtube&reg; guitar experts videos; </li> 
<li>participate in sophisticated online training scenarios that take place in 
Learning Management Systems (LMS) where a coach accesses tracking data on their 
progress and helps them improve their skills through relevant feedback;</li> 
<li>play video games, <i>serious </i>games, online games, individually or 
collectively;</li> 
<li>send their productions to remote colleagues by email and expect feedback 
and corrections from them using for instance Ms-Word or Open office correction 
features;</li> 
<li>listen to corporate management conferences podcasts on their mobile phone 
in the train.</li> </ol> 
<p>Although in variable extension, all these activities can be described as 
e-learning because they provide some learning experience through CD-Roms or 
internet or telephones or any electronic device.</p> 
<h2>Deeper analysis</h2> 
<p>Let's try to analyze things deeper. </p> 
<p>(1) reminds us that e-learning is not necessarily an online activity; <br>

(2) informs us that e-learning can exist even if no dedicated course content 
was developed;<br>
(3) suggests that e-learning does not mean nobody sees 
nobody;<br>
(4) says that e-learning can exist when theory is online and 
practice is offline (and we can reasonably imagine the reverse situation);<br>

(5) describes something pretty obvious: many of us learn everyday in 
Google&reg; without even noticing it or calling it<i>learning</i>; <br>
(6) 
insists on the fact learning can be particularly effective when the learner is 
invited to produce something;<br>
(7) illustrates a very primitive way of 
learning: by imitation (didn't Bach learn music by copying Vivaldi scores?);<br>
(8) is considered by some the most accomplished e-learning method;<br>
(9) 
deals with how children learn first, but does not provide us with a criteria of 
what is the educative part in a game;<br>
(10) alludes to a common intellectual 
activity in most professional organizations and points out that there is most 
often some learning in it;<br>
(11) gives an example of <i>m</i>-learning or 
mobile learning that we can decide to include in the generic name<i>e-learning
</i>.<br>
</p> 
<h2>What e-learning is not </h2> 
<p>When an activity belongs to<i> &quot;e-&quot;</i> but not to <i>
&quot;learning&quot;</i> or belongs to <i>&quot;learning&quot;</i> but not to 
<i>&quot;e-&quot;</i>, it should not be considered as e-learning.</p> 
<p><i>E</i> means <i>electronic</i>. Internet-based, CD-Rom based, 
telephone-based, video-based learning activities should all be considered as 
e-learning. Today, the vast majority of e-learning takes place on the web 
through a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari...).</p> 
<p><i>Learning </i>is a little bit more difficult to define. What is the 
difference between<i>learning </i>and <i>reading</i> for instance? Don't we say 
&quot;John reads in Oxford&quot; for &quot;John is a student at the Oxford 
university&quot;? When I read the news, am I learning or am I just grasping 
some new information? To start with a simple approach, let's suppose we all are
behaviorists and consider that learning means become able to <i>do</i> 
something new. The behaviorist minimal psychology framework suggest that any 
information is directly or indirectly connected to the project of an action and 
implies that the learning process includes:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>information on how to do something but also</li> 
<li>practice opportunities and</li> 
<li>feedback </li> </ol> 
<p>We get (1) bits of information on how to do something. We are granted (2) 
with the opportunity to act so as to practice and improve on these skills. And 
somebody or &quot;something automatic&quot; (a machine) tells us (3) whether 
the skills are acquired or not.</p> 
<p>This definition excludes from <i>e-learning</i> all activities where there 
is mainly information: reading, searching, viewing, listening.</p> 
<p>Of course the criteria is a difficult one as a certain part of the 
intellectual activity is not immediately visible. Some will search Google and 
read only. Some others, with the same search information, will take notes, 
summarize, draw a mind map, produce something, explain to others etc.</p> 
<p>Another difficulty is that some of us will not consider themselves as 
behaviorists. I think however that saying &quot;I am not a behaviorist&quot; 
means &quot;I am more than a behaviorist&quot; - it does not necessarily mean 
you do not accept this minimal framework.</p> 
<p>A third problem of the behaviorist definition is that it does not give a 
clear recognition to intellectual skills like<i>knowing History </i>or <i>
becoming wise</i>.</p> 
<h2>E-learning is about activities<br>
</h2> 
<p>But the advantage of the behaviorist definition is that it focuses on 
activities and feedback, hence suggesting a method for e-learning design. Truth 
is seldom simple but only simple ideas are usable.</p> 
<p>Let's consider e-learning from the author's perspective. Publishing slides, 
PDF e-books, encyclopaedia articles does not mean I produce e-learning, as the 
criteria for e-learning does not lie in the resources I publish but in the 
activities I organize for the learners around these resources. E-learning 
starts when I switch from &quot;I published my course online&quot; to &quot;my 
course<i>takes place </i>online&quot;.</p> 
<p>Designing relevant activities to drive learners from passive reading, 
viewing or listening to dynamically improving their skills is not an easy job. 
I must first be able to describe the objectives of the course in terms of 
action. If I train on meeting management, I am not allowed to define my 
objectives by &quot;they would<i>know</i> what meeting management is&quot; or 
they would &quot;<i>get familiar</i> with meeting management&quot;, because 
&quot;knowing&quot; is a mental skill : I cannot check it, I cannot propose 
activities to improve that, I cannot give feedback on how they<i>know</i> it. I 
should better describe things this way : &quot;they should be able to<i>list</i>
 main meeting management theories&quot; (because listing is an action and I can 
build activities with that) or probably &quot;they should be able to<i>manage
</i> a meeting&quot; (and then imagine a role play game or any real-life based 
situation to practice).</p> 
<p>If I train on how to pilot a plane, multiple choice is not an option. Just 
because I would not fly in a plane whose pilot learned this way. He would not 
get the skills. The relevant activity here will probably be closer to pilot a 
flight simulator. And the feedback should be on how the learner piloted the 
flight simulator: providing information on why he &quot;crashed&quot; the plane 
and how to avoid such a mistake.</p> 
<h2>Instructional design</h2> 
<p>How will we design the relevant activity in a course like:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Meeting management;</li> 
<li>History of Art;</li> 
<li>English as a second language? </li> </ol> 
<p>One might suggest that the relevant activities should be as close as 
possible to real-life situations:</p> 
<p>(1) might lead to some group activities or role play.<br>
(2) might include 
interpretation questions, categorizing questions, memory questions.<br>
(3) 
might provide the learner with listening comprehensions, fill-in the gaps etc.
</p> 
<p>The topic, but also the level of the audience and the available media and 
e-learning softwares will help the e-learning author design the relevant 
questions.</p> 
<p>In the following table, we attempt to formalize a table of some 40 possible 
activities types. There are certainly much more than that and the organization 
could be different. Please consider this as a draft proposal for discussion.</p>
<p>The 8 lines go from the most closed types of questions (easier for 
automatic correction) to the most open ones (the most open ones can only be 
corrected manually by the coach).</p> 
<p>The 5 columns organize activities from the most simple to the most complex 
ones (although this classification remains vague and subjective). Typically, 
e-learning designers would consider this table and decide for a cell when 
building an activity for a dedicated learning topic.</p> <br>

<p>Some clarifications :</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Alternate choice </i>means multiple choice with 2 options</li> 
<li><i>Certainty degree </i>means : a multiple choice or true/false + a 
subsidiary question &quot;How much are you sure?&quot;</li> 
<li><i>Yes/no with explanation </i>combines two questions in one : &quot;Yes 
because of A&quot;, &quot;Yes because of B&quot;, &quot;No because of C&quot;, 
&quot;No because of A&quot;.</li> 
<li><i>Categorizing </i>means Matching where one of the two sets contains less 
elements than the other.</li> 
<li><i>Sequencing </i>is a matching where elements of the first set are named 
&quot;first step&quot;, &quot;second step&quot;, third step&quot;<i></i></li> 
<li><i>Fill-in-form </i>is similar to Fill-in-blanks but adds some graphical 
design to look like an existing form so as to simulate a real-life situation
</li> 
<li><i>Lab simulation </i>can be a Flash animation whose behaviour changes 
when user modifies some settings</li> 
<li><i>Delineate zones on an image </i>is noticeably relevant in medicine: 
delineate a cancer on a radiography for instance. Consider also: mechanics, 
history of art, and more generally all disciplines dealing with visual supports
<br> 
<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2> </li> </ul> 
<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p>E-learning is a rich and complex field of activity. The most complex part 
of e-learning is due to the fact that &quot;learning&quot; is something 
complex, whether &quot;e&quot; or not.</p> 
<p>The name for it suggests that the person who learns, &quot;the 
learner&quot;, is at the center of the process. Otherwise we would call it 
&quot;e-teaching&quot;. Only the learner can decide to enter e-learning 
activities.</p> 
<p>And it is not obvious that the most sophisticated e-learning designs 
produce the most effective learning (consider how effective can be the simple 
fact that you imitate somebody playing your favorite guitar tune on Youtube).
</p> 
<p>However, one should keep in mind that &quot;e&quot; resources do not lead 
to learning if there is no associated and relevant practice for which at least 
some feedback is available somewhere, whether online or not (consider how 
effective can be the fact that my sister tells me whether my interpretation of 
the guitar tune watched on Youtube is &quot;good&quot; and what she suggests I 
should improve, whether she is a guitar expert or not).</p>
