<h2>Government says trains better than planes</h2> 
<p><strong>5 May:</strong> Transport Secretary Lord Adonis&nbsp;has said rail 
journeys&nbsp;should replace short-haul flights, and is planning a high speed 
rail line to achieve this. We're delighted the Government has realised that 
many plane journeys&nbsp;should be made by train instead.</p> 
<p>But high speed rail is only a good idea if it&nbsp;replaces 
flights,&nbsp;instead of just adding to the number of journeys we make.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>So&nbsp;Lord Adonis&nbsp;must cancel plans to expand Heathrow airport. 
If&nbsp;he is&nbsp;really committed to phasing out short-haul flights, this 
expansion won't be needed.</p> 
<p>And if the Government really wants people to switch from plane to train, it 
must start making it easy for them now, rather than just planning for the 
future. Lord Adonis&nbsp;should cut train&nbsp;fares and tax the fuel used on 
domestic flights, so that people can afford to go green.</p> 
<p>Join our campaign for cheaper train fares.</p> <br>
