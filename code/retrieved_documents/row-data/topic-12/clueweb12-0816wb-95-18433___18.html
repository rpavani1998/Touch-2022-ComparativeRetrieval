<p>You don't realize how bad things are until you experience the opposite. 
Without darkness there is no light. I have mixed feelings about rail travel in 
the US. If it seems as though I'm bouncing around between topics bear with me, 
they'll come together in a moment. To give some background before I start I 
have to say that I've logged about 15,000 miles on Amtrak in the past and about 
another 5,000 to 10,000 miles on other train systems all over the world. In 
addition I've flown about a quarter of a million miles or enough to 
circumnavigate the earth 10 times. I took my first train ride in 1993 from 
Pasco WA to Las Vegas. For about the first day of the trip I felt a bit 
embarrassed because I always thought people who took mass transit were poor 
uneducated folks with little other choice. - a train was just a bigger 
Greyhound. If you were someone you drove of flew. How little did I understand 
trains. I started noticing business people taking the trains, grannies seeing 
family, workers commuting and more. I realized that normal people took the 
train.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Back to the future... We started our most recent journey by taking a bus to 
downtown Seattle to the historic King Street Station. Seattle is like many 
cities in that we had competing rail companies who built competing passenger 
rail stations. The interesting part is they built them across the street from 
one another. Union Station got funding to renovate because it is used for the 
new Light Rail Station. King Street Station across the street is just starting 
the process of restoration and the Venetian Piazza St. Marks style clock tower 
definitely looks better as does the new roof tiles. It might be easy to say 
that Seattle really only needs one passenger rail station and we should combine 
our money but how do you decide which of the 100 year old stations to keep? The 
answer is you keep both as comical as that is.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>At some point during the last couple of decades some idiot decided to 
modernize the King Street station and put in lowered ceiling tiles covering up 
a truly amazing molded ceiling and a second story balcony. What's worse is they 
actually chipped molding from the walls so they could plaster over it to get a 
smooth surface. There used to be a beautiful wooden ticket booth which is no 
longer and a Lady's waiting room which doesn't get used. The stairway from the 
street is closed off and the street level parking lot is a hangout for bums and 
trash. However, funding is starting to tickle in and the clock tower is being 
cleaned, the clay roof tiles are being replaced and new lighting for the 15 ft 
clock is being fitted. Inside the station they have a media board showing the 
future plans which include tossing out the water stained roof tiles, 
restoration of some of the marble pillars, a new walkway up to street level and 
a restoration of the outside of the building which will open up space for 
businesses etc.. The old Lady's only waiting room may be made into a cafe or 
restaurant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So let's get to the meat of the question here. Why? Why bother with this 
old crap when we have at least three eligible airports that could service the 
area? OK, now the part about my mixed feelings with rail travel. I spend a lot 
of time in Europe and especially France where high speed rail has all but 
killed air travel and I have tosay that I love trains. The idea of taking a 
taxi to some airport where I have to take my shoes off, scan my bags and then 
wait at a gate to be crammed into a tin can with a bunch of other half sick 
travelers coughing on me and babies screaming is very very unappealing. Because 
of the amount of time it takes to get to airports, get checked in and get your 
bags and get away makes any journey under 6 hrs subject for replacement by high 
speed rail. Longer journeys the planes speed overcomes it's inefficiencies. So 
is there any hope for Amtrak and why am I yammering about such things? I just 
spent 4 hrs on the Coast Starlight for the first leg of our journey so it's 
fresh in my mind.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What Amtrak does wrong.... Let's start by the ridiculous and painful proces
s of going from the idea of taking the train to actually walking on. I went 
online and bought my tickets with a promotion code (Never pay full price for 
Amtrak, there's always a promo code somewhere). I then had to go to a station 
to pick up the tickets where they made me sign each one to combat fraud as they 
said. Fraud? What, someone is going to masquerade as me on the train? If 
Safeway did this we'd have to sign each squash to keep someone else from 
cooking it. Anyway with tickets in hand we proceeded to the King Street Station 
two days later. My perception may be skewed a bit but in France I show up at 
the train station 15 minutes early (or whenever to be honest) and walk up to a 
kiosk to buy my ticket after which I walk onto a train. The whole process takes 
15 minutes tops from the time I decide to take a train and get one one. With 
Amtrak having a ticket is only the beginning. You now have to stand in a long 
line to turn it into a boarding pass. Once you have your boarding pass you need 
to move to a new line which is waiting to get on the train. Why would there be 
a rush to get on the train? Because seat assignments are done at the train car 
door! Thats right, a person is standing there with a map and a market to 
scratch off where he wants you. A kiosk that can assign seats on purchase would 
replaced this entire thing. The one nice side effect of this process though is 
you don't have conductor coming through to punch your ticket. With Amtrak when 
you're on you're done. The other thing Amtrak does wrong and I'm not sure they 
can fix it is the train routes are generally slow and not very frequent. 
However there are 4 trains a day from Seattle south which isn't wonderful but 
it's good enough that you can choose a schedule.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What they're doing right.... This is also from my experience today. The 
Coast Starlight is a double decker Superliner train similar to their flagship 
Empire Builder. I've always been a fan of the double decker trains. An Amtrak 
Superliner is a completely different product than say a French TGV. The TGV is 
an all business experience more like an airplane ride (but not so Walmart). 
TGVs have about as much room per passenger in economy as airplanes have in 
business class. There's very little difference between first class and second 
so unless the ticket prices are close we always ride second class. Unless you 
knew the specific differences you wouldn't be able to tell. The TGV experience 
is about getting to your destination as quick as possible with relative 
comfort. The Amtrak Superliner experience is drastically different. Immediately 
upon entering the train you will notice that you have an insane amount of room 
in your coach seat. I measured 5 softbound novels from my upright setback to 
the one in front of me. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that is a lot of 
room. I'd estimate roughly 45 inches between seats or roughly equal to a first 
class airplane ticket. The seat width is as wide as the first class airplane 
ticket as well. When you fold down your tray you have to then slide it toward 
you about 6 inches before you can put anything on it. The seat reclines about 
2-3 times more than an economy airline seat and a second lever props up a leg 
support and a third pops up a bar for your feet. Theoverhead luggage 
compartment has enough room for a rugby team and if that's not enough there's 
more space at the car entrance. Because they're double decker the second level 
(the main level) doesn't have to deal with train wheels so there's 37 rows of 
seats in the car which is amazing considering the space between them. The lower 
level is for first class and sleepers in addition to the bathrooms which also 
will surprise you. A couple (that's right, a couple per car) are small like 
airplane bathrooms and then there's at least one large one where you can plug 
in all your electronic shavers, blow driers etc... The lower level also houses 
additional luggage storage although if I were you I'd lock my bags if I 
couldn't monitor them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Not only do you have way way more room than on an airplane the train gets 
going quickly because they can load all cars at the same time. I think we were 
off about 15 minutes after we started boarding. Each seat has power plugs which 
are a godsend and a quick stroll through the cars will show many people taking 
advantage of them with laptops and pods everywhere. Speaking of which if you 
get bored in your oversize seat you can take a walk. The Coast Starlight also 
has a bar/lounge car with observation deck which is where I love to just sit 
and read and watch the scenery pass by the wraparound glass windows. Downstairs 
from the observation car is the food counter where they have the usual 
cardboard pizzas and AMPM quality hamburgers. There is about 12 tables where 
you can sit an eat your food before returning to your seat. If you want more of 
a personal experience (and more costly) you can snag one of the attendants as 
they walk through the car and get a reservation to eat in the restaurant. The 
restaurant car is complete with white table cloths and nice food but you have 
to be fast because there's several seatings and if you don't get a reservation 
you're limited to the bar car or bringing your own. Speaking of which you can 
bring your own food and drinks (yes liquids!) avoiding the whole can of soda 
for two bucks situation completely. I remember times when I was passing through 
Portland and had a layover when we'd run down the street to the Burger King and 
buy a couple of $1.39 Whoppers and take them on the train. I'm sure there's 
probably limits to what you can take on board (like your weber smoky mountain 
smoker) but they're not real strict about it. The train ride goes by very 
casually and without disappointment. On the Amtrak you feel like you can take 
as much time as you want to get where you need to be and for good reason, you 
have to. The trip from Seattle to LA takes 40 hours. Amtrak is not crappy rail 
travel, let me just say that right now. However, they're rarely on time, 
they're not fast and they're not always cheaper than flying. My first Amtrak 
trip cost me $177 from Washington to Nevada round trip. That was cheaper than 
any plane ticket then. Now I can fly for less than that. The train would 
probably cost more.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So back to my original quandary. Should we do something about rail in 
America or let Amtrak go the way of the dodo? I say do whatever to bring us up 
to the same level of Japan, China, France and Germany or leapfrog them. A 
modern train with right a way could do Canada to Mexico in 10 hours or less and 
would be full the whole way because unlike an airplane they pick up people on 
the way. Before people jump on me about taxes and subsidies let me say one 
thing, the TGV system in France makes money. That's right it makes money and is 
usually full. The TER (inter region) do not make money and need to be 
subsidized. So in this country where we're afraid to pay one cent in taxes 
unless it's put to good use bombing a small country to protect our civil 
liberties we should think about just using rail for these high profit lines. I 
would think that Vancouver BC to San Diego would be one such line as well as 
Boston to Miami and Chicago to NYC.</p> 
<p>On a less idealistic dreamy note Amtrak would do well with newer rails and 
more right of way. It took us 4 hrs to get from Seattle to Portland which isn't 
that much slower than driving and a heck of a lot more enjoyable. If the 
Superliner could get up to speed or stay at top speed longer it could equal 
driving and still be more comfortable. More trains, a bit more speed and keep 
them full so the ticket prices could be lower and I think we'd have a winner. 
It's no TGV but I think it could be profitable. Also there's the feel element. 
I just like riding trains. I like the rhythmic rocking motion and I like the 
fact that I can do other things on them. Buses are cheaper but I hate them. A 
good bus can't compete with a bad train in my book.</p> 
<p>On arriving to Portland we exited the always nice restored Union station. A 
short walk to the Chinatown station put us on the red line light rail. Thirty 
minutes later we're at the airport. I'm fairly impressed by how much light rail 
Portland has put in compared to Seattle. We've managed 1/5 the amount of 
mileage and only after two decades of talking about it and it still doesn't 
really go anywhere.</p> 
<p>Tomorrow we fly to Georgia. Yes you heard me Georgia then we turn and fly 
to Mexico City. It's the long way but I'll pick up some miles and I got the 
tickets for a song. The plane leaves at 6:30 and our Comfort Suites is going to 
start breakfast at 4 so off to count sheep I go.</p> <br>
