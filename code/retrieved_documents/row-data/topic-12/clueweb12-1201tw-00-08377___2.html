<h2> To Fly Or Not To fly? Tweet </h2> When you are going on holiday the 
question of which is better travelling by air or other means often arises. 
There are many travel options available if you are travelling within the UK or 
Europe or further afield including plane, train, car or bus. So which is the 
best option?<br>
<br>
Travelling throughout Europe by coach has advantages and 
disadvantages. If you are afraid of flying then coach travel obviously gets 
around the concerns of flying, however, if you are travelling long distances 
coach travel can be time consuming, often with many connections needed and 
uncomfortable seats which you will be sitting in for long periods. Coaches do 
not offer much chance to stretch your legs. Travelling further afield than 
Europe by coach is not really practical.<br>
<br>
Trains are a good choice for 
travel throughout Europe. They are faster than cars and coaches and offer a 
more relaxing form of transport. However, they are still not as quick as air 
travel and you can often have long periods where you are waiting for connecting 
trains. Although trains do offer you the chance to stretch your legs, some 
trains are sleeper trains and offer you the chance to lie down whilst 
travelling, a good option for those who need to be fresh on arrival at their 
destination. Trains also offer buffet cars so you can arrive at your 
destination well fed and rested. You can travel by train further afield than 
Europe, however, it is very time consuming with many connections and can be 
costly.<br>
<br>
If you are travelling by car through Europe you will need to 
remember to drive on the right hand side of the road and that signs will be in 
different languages as you travel through the mainland countries. Travelling 
long distances by car can be stressful as you are responsible for navigating 
and arriving at your destination on time. If you travel by car in Europe you 
will also need to make sure your insurance covers you for all the countries you 
are travelling through and that you are aware of any local regulations, such as 
carrying a first aid kit or warning triangle. Travelling further than Europe by 
car is not very practical and although it can be done it will take a long time. 
Travelling by car does, however, give you flexibility when you arrive in your 
destination as you have your own transport.<br>
<br>
The option of travelling 
by air can mean that you arrive at your destination much quicker than by other 
means of travel. Air travel often does not require any connections and you can 
normally fly direct to most destinations. Air travel can be very relaxing and 
stress free with the majority of flights now offering in flight entertainment. 
Travelling by coach, train or air does, however, have drawbacks of how do you 
get around when you reach your destination. The obvious answer is to bookcar 
hire for your arrival in your destination. <br>
<br>
Travel insurance is a 
necessary purchase when booking your holiday. If you pre-book your travel 
arrangements you will be covered for cancellation costs. Terms and conditions 
including exclusions apply and you need to ensure you are familiar with your 
policy wording.<br>
