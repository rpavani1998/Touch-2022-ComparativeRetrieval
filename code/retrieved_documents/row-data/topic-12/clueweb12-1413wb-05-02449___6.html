<h2>Andrew Burd on Chinese medicine and Chinese trains</h2> 
<p>15 Aug, 11 | by BMJ Group</p> Tweet <br>

<p>A few weeks ago I took the family on a trip to Wuhan. We went with another 
family and a family friend, so it was a jolly party that crossed the border and 
took a domestic flight from Shenzhen to Wuhan on the Friday evening.</p> 
<p>Wuhan is a fascinating city, positioned half way between Beijing in the 
north and Guangzhou in the south, and&nbsp;half way between Shanghai in the 
east and Chongqing in the west. The Lonely Planet guide says that Wuhan is a 
place that many visit but only to pass through.&nbsp;This is a shame as it has 
many historical and cultural sites to visit.&nbsp;It stands on the mighty 
Yangtze River and the Yellow Crane Tower figures in many classical poetic 
works.&nbsp;Wuhan features a rather politically sensitive anniversary this 
year.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;100 years ago in October of 1911 that theWuchang Uprising
 overthrew the Qing Dynasty to bring democracy to China. Dr Sun Yat-sen, the 
Che Guevara of the Orient, played a prominent role in the process. But I 
digress somewhat.</p> 
<p>On the Saturday morning I went to the First Affiliated Hospital in Wuhan to 
deliver a lecture on the surgical management of skin pathology to an assembled 
audience of dermatologists.&nbsp;They were attentive, appreciative, and there 
was a lively discussion.&nbsp;After the talk I was shown round the department 
by the senior doctor in charge of the outpatient department. I was told that 
between two and three thousand patients were seen each day by the 70 doctors in 
the clinic.&nbsp;I noticed the electronic information board was calling for 
ticket holder 750 and it was only eleven am.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Treatments were about 50/50 traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The 
treatment rooms contained a plethora of equipment for steaming, soaking, 
injections, and infusions as well as bandaging and other topical treatments. In 
the afternoon we went to the 3rd affiliated hospital to meet up with old 
friends in the burns centre. Both adult and children wards were full and 
overflowing. Adult patients in the ICU had a minimum of monitoring equipment 
and the patients lay in either air fluidised or spinal beds that allowed easy 
rotation.</p> 
<p>I asked the paediatric burn surgeon about the costs of care and the 
operative strategy. She told me about the mounds of paper work that had to be 
filled in before operating on a child. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; I 
thought until it was explained that the paper work was not to protect the 
patients but to protect the doctors.&nbsp;Emotions can run very high if a 
family sells all its belongings to pay for the treatment of a family member who 
then does not survive.</p> 
<p>Much work needs to be done in mainland China to bring affordable healthcare 
to the whole population.&nbsp;In the meantime doctors share their concerns 
about their moral and ethical dilemmas with regard to patient care but also 
concerns about their personal safety.</p> 
<p>The following day we went to a futuristic science park to visit a cutting 
edge R&amp;D centre for antibody targeted drug therapy for cancer.&nbsp;After 
lunch it was time to return to Hong Kong. The question was how?&nbsp; I have 
always liked trains and so I had suggested we try the high speed train from 
Wuhan to Guangzhou.&nbsp;This met with general agreement and we headed for the 
Wuhan station.&nbsp;This was an incredible building with a high curving roof 
that looked far more like an airport terminal than a railway 
station.&nbsp;Indeed the interior was so vast that individual voices melded 
into a background hum much as in the giant cathedrals of Europe.</p> 
<p>With our tickets purchased, we passed security and went to the designated 
waiting area with comfortable seating surrounded by shops and restaurants. When 
the time came for boarding we descended a long escalator to the platform level 
to enter the lavishly appointed bullet trains.&nbsp; Needless to say the 
journey was spectacular.&nbsp;We could constantly monitor the speed from the 
electronic display at the end of each carriage and the maximum speed I noted 
was 345 kph. The ride was quiet, smooth, immensely comfortable, and we were all 
highly impressed.&nbsp; Quite a contrast to the local train from Guangzhou to 
Shenzhen.</p> 
<p>It was two weeks later that the Beijing to Shanghai high speed link started 
amidst a lot of politics and adverse comments from both local and international 
experts. Then the fatal crash on the Wenzhou line occurred; six carriages 
derailed and 40 killed.&nbsp; Some say it was inevitable; some say it is just 
the &ldquo;tip of the iceberg.&rdquo; In four years China has built the most 
extensive high speed train network in the world, a massive and very expensive 
undertaking. Even if there was no corruption it would be virtually impossible 
to expand at such a rate without having some significant problems. But then I 
try to put things in perspective. When returning to the UK, I still prefer to 
take my chances on&nbsp;a train rather than the motorways, despite the history 
offatal train crashes in the UK.&nbsp; And in China, road, rail, or 
plane?&nbsp; I am pragmatic and in the past my position has a been planes for 
the longer journeys but trains, high speed trains if applicable, for the 
rest.&nbsp; Another major train crash in the high speed rail network would be 
politically unacceptable at this time.&nbsp; As such I expect a massive review 
of safety policies and procedures is underway right now. Next time I am 
visiting the mainland if there is a choice, plane or train?&nbsp; My choice 
would still be the train. And if there was a crash?&nbsp; I have travel 
insurance and if I had survived, would seek care from one of the many excellent 
private hospitals in the mainland and, not having the power of the people 
behind me, I hope the doctors would feel relaxed enough to give me their best 
care.</p>

<p>Fascinating approach to the management of untoward events. FWIW, in Saudi 
Arabia, one's passport gets held if there is a patient complaint pending the 
outcome of an investigation.</p> </li>

<p>Felix, the retribution approach to untoward medical events and outcomes is 
a feature of professional practice in other Asian countries and certainly one 
of our staff from Bangladesh &nbsp;said that this was a concern there. I have 
heard of other Chinese families hiring people to make protests on their behalf 
&ndash; rent a crowd, or rent a thug! This threat certainly does bring in a new 
dimension of defensive medicine.</p> </li>

<p>Since no particular system of medicine has been able to provide total cure 
for Bronchial asthma which has been revealed in the various studies, it is 
advisable to augment all the good and beneficial factors from the available 
different systems of medicine with an objective of establishing Asthmatic free 
society.</p> </li> </ul>  You can follow any responses to this entry through the
