<p>Discussion on defining regions for Queensland is in progress. If you know 
the area pretty well, please share your opinion on thetalk page. </p> <br>
<br>

<p><b>Queensland</b> [1] is one of the six states in Australia and probably 
most famous because of its association with several major world heritage sites 
including theGreat Barrier Reef and the Daintree National Park. Eastern 
Queensland has a climate ranging from subtropical to tropical, and it's a 
popular wintertime tourist attraction. Large areas of western Queensland are 
very arid. Much of Queensland has a wet and dry season due to its latitude, and 
this is more notable further north you travel. One of the major tourist areas 
is the beach-based tourist resort just south of Brisbane, known as theGold Coast
.South East Queensland is one of the fastest-growing areas of Australia. </p>

<h2>[edit] Understand</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Climate</h3> 
<h3>[edit]  Geography </h3> <br>
Kangaroos in Australia 
<p>Queensland is a large, diverse state stretching over 1,730,648 sq km. 
Driving distances are long but doable if you plan carefully. There are 12 main 
highways but the coastal route is scenic and offers plenty of diversions.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Time</h3> 
<p>Queensland is in the UTC+10 timezone. Unlike New South Wales to the south, 
it doesn't observe daylight saving, so set your watch one our back when you 
cross the border during summer.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>[edit] Visitor Information Centres</h3> 
<p>Accredited Visitor Information Centres are available for visitor help and 
advice when travelling around Queensland. For a list of where to find these 
centres, Visit Tourism Queensland&rsquo;s Visitor Information Centres page.[2] 
</p> 
<h2>[edit] Get in</h2> 
<h3>[edit]  By plane </h3> 
<p>Most interstate travelers have the choice of flying to Queensland with 
Qantas[3], Virgin Australia [4] or Jetstar.[5] Flights to major towns are 
frequent and regional airports are dispersed throughout the state.</p> 
<p>The main international airports are in Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast. 
</p> 
<p>Domestic airports with direct flights from interstate are at Townsville, 
Mackay, Rockhampton, the Fraser Coast and the Sunshine Coast. </p> 
<p>Other airports in smaller towns in Queensland are served by indirect 
flights via one of the airports above.</p> 
<p> <b>Brisbane Airport</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Brisbane Airport[6] is a 15 km or 20 minute drive from the CBD, or about 
25 minutes by Airtrain[7], which also continues on to the Gold Coast. </li> 
<li>The AirTrain runs every 30 minutes from 6am to 7pm every day and connects 
to Central station.</li> 
<li>The domestic terminal is separate from the international terminal, but 
AirTrain provides a 5-minute connection.</li> 
<li>There are shuttle buses which provide direct hotel transfers, and 
plentiful taxis and hirecar providers.</li> 
<li>Both terminals provide undercover parking for short and long term periods. 
</li> 
<li>Brisbane Airport provides a handy map of flight routes and general 
timetables.[8] </li> </ul> 
<p><b>Cairns Airport</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cairns Airport[9] is located 7 kilometers north of the CBD. </li> 
<li>Domestically, Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia all operate out of 
Cairns, with scheduled services to most Australian state capitals, as well as 
regional locations.</li> 
<li>Cairns also handles international flights from Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan,
Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. </li> 
<li>Rental Cars can be located at the domestic terminal in the QantasLink[10] 
arrival lounge.</li> 
<li>Shuttle buses to Cairns and Port Douglas depart hourly. </li> 
<li>Taxis are also available 24 hours a day, and the fare to the city centre 
costs around AUD$16.</li> 
<li>Short-term and long-term parking is located next to the passenger terminal.
</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Gold Coast Airport</b> </p> 
<p>Gold Coast Airport[11] is located on the Gold Coast Highway at Bilinga 
(close toCoolangatta) on the southern end of the Gold Coast, and is only 
minutes from the beach. Part of the runway actually extends intoNew South Wales.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The airport 30 minutes&rsquo; drive from Surfers Paradise and an hour from 
Byron Bay. The drive to Brisbane can take an hour and fifteen minutes. </li> 
<li>Jetstar, Qantas, Tiger Airways[12] and Virgin Australia all have frequent 
domestic flights fromAdelaide, Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. </li> 
<li>Internationally, AirAsia X[13], Air New Zealand[14] and Freedom Air[15] 
fly in fromNew Zealand and Malaysia. </li> 
<li>Surfside Bus Lines[16] and Gold Coast Tourist Shuttles[17] offer 
convenient transfers to hotels and theme parks. The free Airport Link shuttle
[18] takes you straight to the Gold Coast Highway, where public transport is 
readily available.</li> 
<li>Car rental companies can be located opposite the check-in counters at the 
airport.</li> 
<li>Taxis are available immediately outside the terminal. </li> </ul> 
<p><b>Interstate Travel Times</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sydney to Brisbane &ndash; 1 hour </li> 
<li>Melbourne to Brisbane &ndash; 2 hours </li> 
<li>Adelaide to Brisbane &ndash; 2.5 hours </li> 
<li>Darwin to Brisbane &ndash; 4 hours </li> 
<li>Perth to Brisbane &ndash; 6.5 hours </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit]  By bus </h3> 
<p>There are a number of companies that operate bus services between cities 
and towns throughout Australia, and there are also interstate trains.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  By car </h3> 
<p>Queensland&rsquo;s wide open spaces make it ideal for exploration by car. 
The roads are high quality and well-signed so getting here is easy.</p> 
<p><b>Driving Times</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sydney to Brisbane &ndash; 9 hours </li> 
<li>Melbourne to Brisbane &ndash; 21 hours </li> 
<li>Adelaide to Brisbane &ndash; 25 hours </li> 
<li>Darwin to Brisbane &ndash; 25-40 hours </li> </ul> 
<p>The drive from Melbourne is ideally covered over two days (minimum), and 
Sydney to Brisbane can be driven in a day. </p> 
<p> <b>Suggested Routes</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>From Melbourne or Sydney, take the coastal Pacific Highway (1); the more 
inland New England Highway (15) throughNew South Wales; or the inland A32 from 
Adelaide which also goes through New South Wales. </li> 
<li>If you have time up your sleeve, you can continue taking the coastal route 
(the Bruce Highway, A1) all the way north toCairns. The highway is scenic, 
comfortable to drive and offers plenty of attractions along the way; but 
you&rsquo;ll need to allow two to three days for the journey fromBrisbane. </li>
<li>For an alternative entry into Queensland, drive up from New South Wales 
via the New England Highway (15) through the Southern Downs. This will take you 
throughWarwick and Toowoomba, towns rich in pioneer history. From here you can 
continue north to the vineyards of the Granite Belt and South Burnett regions.
</li> 
<li>South East Queensland is well-connected with freeways and distributor 
roads, from theGold Coast all the way up to the Sunshine Coast. </li> 
<li>Serious outback travelers heading east from the Northern Territory can 
enter Queensland viaMount Isa on the Barkly Highway (A2); or drive up from 
South Australia via the Birdsville Track (an old stock route and now a dirt 
track) and on toLongreach. This journey is recommended in a four-wheel drive 
vehicle.</li> </ul> 
<p>It is important to be realistic about the distances and travel times 
involved: for instance the trek fromMount Isa to Brisbane covers over 1800 km 
of road - which equates to about 22 hours of continuous driving. SeeDriving in 
Australia </p> 
<p>If backpacking or on a tight budget, check to see if you can double up with 
other low-budget travellers who may be driving inter-state, or investigate 
car-hire places that sometimes offer deals charging less to return their stock 
to capital cities.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  By rail </h3> 
<p>The <b>Countrylink/XPT</b> service from Sydney is at present the only 
interstate service. The trip fromSydney to Brisbane takes around 14 hours; the 
connecting journey fromSydney to Cairns takes a little less than two days if 
you choose not to break it up along the way.</p> 
<p>The <b>Brisbane XPT</b> train runs once a day from Sydney&rsquo;s Central 
station to Brisbane&rsquo;s Roma Street. The train departs at 4:20pm in the 
afternoon, travels overnight and then arrives in Brisbane at 6:30am the 
following morning. You can also board the train at Strathfield or Hornsby 
station, at Broadmeadow inNewcastle or at one of stations along the way. </p> 
<p>You can also travel to Brisbane during the day by catching <b>
Countrylink&rsquo;s Casino XPT</b> train from Sydney Central station to Casino, 
then changing to a connecting bus. The bus takes you fromCasino via the Gold 
Coast to Brisbane&rsquo;s Roma Street station. The whole journey takes fifteen 
and a half hours - of which only the final three hours are on the bus. The 
train departs Sydney Central station every day at 7:15am in the early morning, 
and the connecting bus arrives at Brisbane Roma Street station at 10:21pm late 
that same evening.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  By boat </h3> 
<p>Interstate and International Cruise Liners regularly dock into Brisbane, 
and sail on to theWhitsundays, Cape York, Townsville, Cairns and the Great 
Barrier Reef. </p> 
<p>Luxury cruises liners that regularly call into Brisbane include P&amp;O 
Cruises[19], Carnival[20] and Oceania Cruises.[21] </p> 
<p><b>Travel Times</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sydney to Brisbane: 1 sea day </li> 
<li>Brisbane to Whitsundays: 1 sea day </li> 
<li>Brisbane to Cairns: 2 sea days </li> 
<li>Brisbane to New Caledonia: 2 sea days </li> </ul> 
<p>Brisbane&rsquo;s cruise ship port is called <b>Portside Wharf</b>, a recent 
development located in Hamilton, 6km from the Brisbane CBD or about a 20 minute 
drive. Buses into town and ferries service the port regularly. It also houses a 
fresh produce market, riverside restaurants, caf&eacute;s and eateries, 
boutiques and cinemas.</p> 
<p>Portside Wharf[22] provides a handy shipping schedule. </p>

<li>Aboriginal Rock Art - the Art Gallery in the Carnarvon Gorge National Park 
contains some of the finest Aboriginal rock art in Australia. Just 5.6 
kilometres from the trailhead, at the junction of Kamoloo Creek, a signposted 
access track leaves the main walking trail upstream of crossing number 10, 
providing a gentle climb to the escarpment base where the site is located. 
Boardwalks, interpretive signs and seating facilities provide optimum 
conditions for visitors to appreciate this diverse range of Aboriginal artwork 
without endangering it. This extensive gallery contains more than 600 stencils 
and 1300 engravings. Aboriginal rock art on the sandstone overhangs is a 
fragile reminder of the Aboriginal people who used the gorge for thousands of 
years for ceremonies and rituals.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Q1 Observation Deck - Australia's only beachside observation deck, located 
inSurfers Paradise on the Gold Coast. QDeck takes you to the highest point 
above the city, providing stunning 360 degree views from the surf to the 
hinterland and beyond. Rising 235 metres into the sky, QDeck is located on 
level 77 of the iconic Q1 tower. Your journey begins with an inside look at the 
construction of this landmark development before boarding one of the world's 
fastest express lifts which transports you from ground to level 77 in less than 
43 seconds. Once at the top, you will see spectacular views which reach on a 
clear day fromBrisbane to Byron Bay. </li> </ul>

Orchid Beach on Hinchinbrook Island 
<ul> 
<li>Adventure - Fly through the air, dive through the coral, or ride the wild 
river rapids - a Queensland Adventure holiday really gives you something to 
write home about! With craggy mountain heights to scale, deep limestone caves 
to delve and vast treks of unchartered Outback to explore, Queensland is a land 
brimming with surprising discoveries and exciting adventures to enjoy. In 
Queensland you can learn how to hang glide off a mountain or ride a camel along 
a golden beach. You can camp by a billabong or feel your adrenalin surge on a 
real life cattle muster during a farm stay on the Western Downs. From an 
inflatable jet boat you can watch the whales waltz or take a jet ski eco-safari 
through the glorious Whitsundays archipelago. Then as the sun sets over the 
ocean, watch the Reef come alive under the stars, during your overnight stay on 
a purpose-built ocean pontoon. Treat the whole family to an exhilarating day at 
a world-class theme park. Feel the rush of the rollercoaster, go behind the 
scenes of a movie set, and get up close and personal with exotic animals from 
around the world.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Islands and Beaches - Queensland is home to some of the most stunning 
islands and beaches in the world, and each one invites you to come and share in 
its sumptuous delights. Set like sparkling jewels in and around the pristine 
waters of the blue Pacific Ocean, Queensland&rsquo;s islands and beaches are a 
true national treasure. On the islands you can treat yourself to a day spa, 
dive through the Great Barrier Reef, improve your handicap with a round of 
golf, then, as the sun sets over the water, indulge in fresh, local, 
mouth-watering food and wine. With sands so clean and white they dazzle the 
eye, a day spent on a Queensland beach is truly one of life&rsquo;s greatest 
pleasures. With palm trees swaying lazily on one side and clear azure waters 
gently lapping at the other, the siren-call of a Queensland beach is impossible 
to ignore.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Natural Encounters - Watching the sun set over the ocean from the white 
sands of a deserted tropical beach is truly one of life&rsquo;s greatest 
pleasures. Soaking up the view from the crest of a mountain you&rsquo;ve just 
scaled is another. And watching dolphins at play in the turquoise waters of a 
tropical lagoon is a memory you&rsquo;ll treasure for a lifetime. All these 
experiences and more are waiting for you in Queensland&rsquo;s wild natural 
environments. From the spinifex grasslands of the Outback to the lush 
rainforests of the Gold Coast Hinterland, Queensland is a nature-lover&rsquo;s 
paradise. Breathe in the fresh, clean Queensland air and escape to a world free 
of phones, emails, meetings and deadlines. In the north, the World Heritage 
listed Daintree Rainforest yields to pristine sandy beaches and the clear blue 
waters of the Great Barrier Reef. In the south, majestic mountains stand guard 
over the rare flora and fauna within its fold. And in all places in between 
you&rsquo;ll find rare and exciting animal encounters that will delight the 
whole family!</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Relax with the Queensland Lifestyle - Feel your work-day worries melt away 
as you soak up the warm, welcoming lifestyle of Queensland. Put meetings, 
deadlines and peak-hour traffic far behind and head to Queensland - where the 
only decision you&rsquo;ll have to make is, seafood or steak, white wine or 
red? Take in the views from the deck of a super yacht. Detoxify the body and 
de-stress the mind at a luxurious day spa. Visit the markets and bag a bargain 
or improve your handicap with a round of golf. Ignite your imagination with 
art, dance, theatre and culture, both home-grown and the finest from overseas. 
Then hit the casino for a chance to strike it rich! Watch the best in the world 
compete for a surfing crown, or for sport of a different kind, spend the day 
shopping at exclusive designer label stores found no where else in Australia.
</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Major Events</b> </p> 
<p>Queensland is host to a large range of events right across the state. </p> 
<p>Some of the major Events in Queensland include; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>January &ndash; Brisbane International Tennis Brisbane </li>

<ul> 
<li>Catch The Savannahlander [29] from Cairns to Forsayth - this unique four 
day train trip is a great way to see the Australian outback.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Brisbane City is not only the gateway to Moreton Bay the Sunshine Coast 
and theGold Coast, but is a destination itself. It used to be that travellers 
would stop in Brisbane because they had too on the way to the rest of their 
holiday. But these days Brisbane offers world class arts, adventure, fashion, 
dining, nightlife and daylife. The River City offers river tours, night and 
day, low-key, touristy, romantic or wild party style from a variety of 
companies. For a great night out, to see great bands or go to a dance party, 
locals head to Fortitude Valley in the evening and then enjoy the Valley 
markets on the weekends in Brunswick mall. West End also has trendy bars and 
restaurants, with markets on Saturdays along the river where local culture and 
local farmers sell their wares. For a lower key or a generational difference, 
try Paddington, Bulimba or New Farm for dining and cafes. Shopping in the city 
centre is a pleasure with shady pedestrian malls and alfresco cafes and 
restaurants at every turn. Southbank is the perfect family destination for a 
low-cost or elegant night out - just pick your style. Fish and chips on the 
picnic tables provided in the grassy parklands, or fine dining in some of the 
top class restaurants lining little Stanly street. Come back in the morning for 
the famous markets on the weekends, and take a swim in the sparkling man-made 
beach, looking across the river to the cityscape. The free childrens water play 
park is new and hugely popular. Change rooms and shady spots are available and 
abundant. Take guided night walks through the Botanical gardens to view the 
nocturanal wild-life. Go kayaking along the river in daytime or nightime. Climb 
the story bridge, or the Kangaroo Point cliffs. See live comedy, go to a play 
or a musical, visit the art gallery where Picasso and Andy Warhol collections 
were recently shown, or just cycle through the cities purpose built cycle paths 
that can take you from one end of the city to the other, and stop in the many 
parks along the way for an ice-cream or a drink.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Gold Coast - An hour south of Brisbane you will find world class surfing, 
beautiful beaches, great food from all cultures, nightlife, fun parks, day 
trips by plane, helicopter or boat, deep sea fishing, unbelievable shopping, 
casino, shows, festivals, markets, or just watching the beautiful people. From 
Surfers Paradise to Cooloongatta the beaches alone are enough. Modern and 
clean, the southern corner of QLD is a world class holiday destination for 
people on all budgets.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Sunshine Coast - 2 hours north of Brisbane you will find the Sunshine 
coast with all the Gold Coast has to offer, but with a slightly different 
demographic (higher propertion of retirees), and a less dense population. The 
Sunshine Coast stretches across a number of towns each with thier own charms 
and flavours. The population boom being experienced by the Sunshine coast has 
much to do with the Sea-change migration from NSW and Victoria, as southern 
retirees come to spend the rest of their days enjoying what QLDers have had on 
their doorstep for their whole lives.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Fraser Coast - Gateway to Fraser Island the Fraser Coast is experiencing a 
massive property boom and tourist explosion. Unspoilt beaches and waterways, 
fantastic 4WD'ing, whale watching and fishing seem to be the main attractions, 
although the interior has plenty to offer those interested in the agricultural 
life of QLD.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>The Town of 1770 - the closest access point to the Great Barrier Reef, 
north of Brisbane. Just over an hours drive from Bundaberg and Gladstone 
airports it is a small coastal strip now slowly making itself known to the 
broader population. Great accommodation deals and quiet holidays can be had in 
this area where the reef is accessible for inexpensive day trips by boat. 
Snorkelling, surfing, fishing and camping, holidays houses, cabins or luxury 
resort accom available.</li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Eat</h2> 
<p>Much of Queensland's income is still derived from agriculture, with 
different regions specializing in different produce. Famous examples include 
sugercane in theWhitsundays; peanuts for Kingaroy; mangoes for Bowen. Fresh 
local fish can also be found right along the coast, usually sold in &quot;Fish 
&amp; Chips&quot; shops.Brisbane and surrounding areas like the Gold Coast and 
Sunshine Coast are becoming very well known for quality restaurants, cafes and 
take-aways. Whether it's 5 star or fast food you are after there is no need to 
eat poor quality food in Queensland. With so much fresh food available, seek 
out boutique and independent operations with a focus on quality and freshness. 
You won't usually pay more than its worth. Demand for organic food is also 
growing, as is awareness of variations in peoples dietry preferences, so gluten 
and dairy intolerant or vegetarian/vegan eaters will often find that choices 
are available in most places, or can be prepared in the kitchens on request. 
Pub food in QLD is no longer just the sad old counter meal variety, if you find 
a fairly modern pub you'll find a fairly modern kitchen and while you can often 
still get lunch for $10, generally the low price won't be reflected in the 
quality. Breakfast is big in Brisbane and markets are particularly good places 
to go for a local brekkie. Alternatively, you'll find free and clean public 
BBQ's in lots of the public parks, so bring your own picnic along and enjoy 
QLD's gorgeous weather while you cook up your own true Aussie BBQ. To be fair 
to the other patrons, give the BBQ plate a wipe down after you've finished with 
some clean newspaper, and place your rubbish in bins provided.</p> 
<p><b>Markets</b> </p> 
<p>How fresh can it get? Straight from the farmer to you is the latest trend 
and foodies throughout Queensland are loving the range and quality of local 
seasonal produce. It pays to get up early with the sun, pack plenty of extra 
bags and don't forget a cold pack in case some divine seafood or meat takes 
your fancy. Stroll around the stalls and chat to the farmers, once you get past 
the weather you'll discover a wealth of information about how to select, store 
and cook your purchases.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Brisbane - Head to The Powerhouse at New Farm in Brisbane by at least 7am 
on a Saturday morning and you'll discover locals armed with trolley bags 
snapping up high quality produce and seasonal bargains on a regular basis. On 
the last Sunday of each month the stallholders move to suburban Mitchelton. If 
organic is your style the Green Flea Community Markets at Davies Park in West 
End or the Northey Street Organic Market at Windsor will keep you busy.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Gold Coast - Foodies are well catered for with the farmers markets at 
Banora Point, Bundall, The Spit, Miami, Mudgeeraba and Tamborine offering fresh 
produce.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>South East Queensland Country - Enjoy fresh food right where it is grown 
on the Southern Downs at the Glengallan Seasonal Farmers Markets, 15km north of 
Warwick on the first Sunday of each season. Don't forget to look for fresh 
seasonal produce across the region on road side stalls.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Sunshine Coast - The Noosa Farmers Market on Weyba Road at Noosaville 
showcases some of the Sunshine Coast's best produce every Sunday from 7am to 
midday. All products are grown, reared, caught, baked or prepared by the stall 
holder. You'll find farm fresh fruit and vegetables, breads, cheeses, 
preserves, seafood, red claw, poultry, beef, lamb, coffee and the chance to 
swap ideas with local producers. The Eumundi Markets are another food lover's 
delight with everything from fresh produce to taste sensations you'll find hard 
to resist.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Central Queensland - Keep your eyes open for roadside stalls just off the 
farm. This area is the fruit bowl of the Coral Coast and supplies chillies, 
tomatoes and the sweetest of peas to southern states.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Mackay - Head for the local showgrounds located in the centre of town for 
the Mackay Farmer's Market every Saturday morning from 6am at the Showgrounds. 
This is the best spot to gather all local fresh produce and freshly cut flowers.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Tropical North Queensland - Rusty's Markets in Cairns are an experience 
that should not be missed by market lovers. This is an Asian-type market 
experience with stalls overflowing with exotic local produce and flowers.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Dining &amp; Eating Out</b> </p> 
<p>Queensland offers visitors some great locations for Dining and Eating. 
Australian cuisine blends fresh ingredients and uses European culinary 
traditions and the light touch of Asian seasoning. You'll taste some of the 
best food in the world and even the most discerning diner will be satisfied. 
With fresh barramundi, mud crab, exotic crocodile meat, mangoes and macadamia 
nuts.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Buy</h2> 
<p>From bargains at the markets to one-off creations at designer boutiques, 
there&rsquo;s a shopping sensation to satisfy. For elite high-fashion labels, 
beat a path to exclusive shopping precincts in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, and 
fabulous Noosa on the Sunshine Coast. There you&rsquo;ll find exclusive 
boutiques and fashion to die for! For the quirky and the vintage, you 
can&rsquo;t go past the markets of Tropical North Queensland and Brisbane. And 
if trawling through second hand shops for antiques and collectibles is your 
idea of the divine you won&rsquo;t be able to resist the quaint hinterland 
villages of South East Queensland Country.</p> 
<p><b>Shopping Guide</b> </p> 
<p>There are a wide variety of quality products on offer in Australia at very 
competitive prices. When shopping, sightseeing or visiting theme parks on 
tours, remember you have a choice of where and when to shop. Shop around and 
compare prices and quality before you buy. As in other countries, some 
Australian business pay commissions to tour operators and tour guides to bring 
tour groups to their stores. In some instances the cost of these commissions 
may be passed on to you, the customer. While this does not necessarily mean 
prices will be higher than at other stores, you should have an opportunity to 
visit and buy from other outlets, so check your itinerary for free shopping 
time and ask for free time if none has been allocated. While you are in 
Australia you are covered by Australia's consumer protection laws, which 
require businesses to treat you fairly. All stores must obey these laws. 
Australia also has specific consumer protection measures for the tourism 
industry; most of Australia's States and Territories have legislation that 
requires travel agents, and can provide compensation to travellers should, for 
example, their travel agent go out of business. Your country also has similar 
laws that protect your consumer rights and govern the professional standards of 
travel wholesalers and retailers in your home country. If you are not satisfied 
with what you have purchased form them, you may wish to contact the relevant 
government authority for travel and tourism in your home country. Please visit 
the Office of Fair Trading.[30] </p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Drink</h2> 
<p>The local mass produced Queensland beer is &quot;XXXX&quot;, known locally 
as 'fourex'. The most common glass measure is called a<i>pot</i>, so just about 
any pub in Queensland will server you a<i>pot of fourex'</i>. </p> 
<p>Rum is also produced in Queensland at the central coast town of Bundaberg. 
It is creatively called Bundaberg Rum, or 'bundy'.</p> 
<p><b>Wineries, Vineyards and Breweries</b> </p> 
<p>The burgeoning Queensland wine industry is one of the state's best kept 
secrets. Find a cellar door near you, or even a microbrewery to your taste. 
Queensland offers a gourmet paradise with delectable, award-winning wines, 
organic produce and fresh seafood. Follow a food and wine trail and you'll be 
sipping on a Chardonnay or rolling a Shiraz around your mouth on a 
grape-fuelled adventure.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Sleep</h2>

traveller&rsquo;s budget. Whether you are looking for a plush five star resort 
or a cosy Bed &amp; Breakfast thousands of hotels, B&amp;B&rsquo;s, apartments,

<li>The weather in QLD is often excellent for camping, and there are fantastic

local council's campgrounds, state conservation parks, state forests and 
national parks. Some national parks require pre-booking but most work on a 
'register on arrival' basis.</li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Stay safe</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Health</h3> 
<p>Skin cancer is a serious health issue in Australia, and sunburn and 
sunstroke are related problems. Make sure you wear SPF 15+ sunscreen, a 
wide-brimmed hat and t-shirt or long sleeved shirt whenever you can in summer 
even on cloudy days. Particularly, protect children's skin between 10AM to 2PM, 
as the summer sun can cause a severe burn that will at best ruin your holiday, 
and at worst end in a trip to the local hospital. Many media outlets list the 
UV Index (sun factor) with the weather broadcast. In summer in Queensland 
expect that the UV Index will be<i>extreme</i> every day. </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Drink water: most locals carry a bottle of water with them at most times 
in the summer. The humidity can take you unaware, and dehydrate you quickly. 
Make sure children take regular drinks if they are playing outdoors, and carry 
water with you on car journeys, hikes or any time you may inadvertently end up 
somewhere unexpected.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Beaches</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Saltwater crocodiles</b> are common throughout the tropical northern 
half of Queensland all the way down toRockhampton. Some people play down the 
threat to humans posed by the Saltwater Crocodile. The facts are that the 
Saltwater Crocodile has been protected for decades now and there is a healthy 
population in northern Australia. It is always best to play it safe as a 
saltwater crocodile can grow to over 5m in length, and are found both in salt 
and fresh water. Beaches, rivers, creeks and waterholes can be home to large 
crocodiles. They are not known to frequent theGreat Barrier Reef but instead 
live in coastal areas and rivers in tropical Australia. Generally, 
authoritative local advice can direct you to a place to swim which is known to 
be free of crocodiles or has been cleared of them.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> When swimming at surf beaches, swim on beaches patrolled by surf 
lifesavers and between the red and yellow flags. Surf conditions can change 
quickly, and invisible rips can cause problems for even the strongest swimmers. 
The flags denote the safest area to swim in and the area is monitored.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> If you see signs warning swimmers that &quot;stingers&quot; (poisonous 
animals) are in the water, read them carefully as some are deadly. Find a pool 
or use one of the net protected beach enclosures common on many main beaches.
</li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Get out</h2> 
<p>Queensland has many transit routes out of the state for visitors to explore 
the other areas of Australia. Many highways connect all major cities with most 
state airports servicing interstate flights.</p> <i>This article is an <b>
