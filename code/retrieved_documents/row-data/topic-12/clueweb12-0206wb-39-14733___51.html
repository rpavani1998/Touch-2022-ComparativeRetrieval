<p></p> <b>County sales tax vote is assured</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By John M. Motter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Archuleta County's commissioners are determined to place sales tax renewal 
on the Nov. 6 general election ballot. What they've not agreed on so far is, 
should they ask for renewal for seven years only, or for perpetuity?</p> 
<p>Currently, a 6.91 percent sales tax is levied on most retail sales in 
Archuleta County. Colorado takes 3.91 percent of the total revenue, leaving 4 
percent to be divided between the county and town.</p> 
<p>Of the 4 percent retained locally, 1 percent to be divided equally with the 
town was first approved in perpetuity by voters June 25, 1968. An additional 1 
percent to be levied in perpetuity and split with the town was approved by 
voters Sept. 6, 1983. The final 2 percent currently at issue and an addition to 
the 2 percent already in effect in perpetuity was first approved by voters for 
a 7-year term during November of 1988. Renewal of this 2 percent levy was 
approved for a second 7-year period during November of 1994.</p> 
<p>The coming Jan. 1, 2003, expiration of 2 of the 4-cents-per-dollar local 
sales tax has elevated the sales tax issue to the top of the commissioners' 
agenda. Even though the 2 cents is split evenly with the town, the remaining 1 
cent stuffs about $1 million a year into the county budget.</p> 
<p>All of the county's income from its 1-cent portion is spent on road capital 
improvement projects, a practice the commissioners hope to continue. In fact, 
the commissioners hope to continue the 2 cent sales tax just as it was approved 
by voters during November of 1994.</p> 
<p>At that time, voters okayed renewal of the 2 cent tax first initiated in 
1988. The 1994 ballot question approved by voters stipulated that the tax would 
be split evenly with the town, all county proceeds dedicated to the road 
capital improvement fund, and that the tax would expire Jan. 1, 2003.</p> 
<p>Expire it will. While seeking renewal, the commissioners have informally 
agreed to place the proposition on the Nov. 6 ballot with one stipulation not 
agreed upon. Should they seek a seven-year extension, or should they seek voter 
approval in perpetuity?</p> 
<p>At the Aug. 14 regular meeting of county commissioners, Commissioner Bill 
Downey said he favors a seven-year renewal, Commissioner and Chairman of the 
Board Gene Crabtree said he favors levying the tax in perpetuity, and 
Commissioner Alden Ecker was ambivalent.</p> 
<p>To help resolve the issue, Kathy Wendt, the administrative assistant, was 
instructed to draft language as it may appear on the Nov. 6 ballot and forward 
that draft to the Colorado Department of Revenue. The CDR response will help 
the commissioners make a decision.</p> 
<p>Complicating the issue was town voter approval in April of 1999 of an issue 
concerning an &quot;up to 3 percent&quot; sales tax. The town's action is 
independent of anything the county does. The town tax is scheduled to become 
effective when the existing 2 percent tax shared by the town and county expires 
Jan. 1, 2003. Colorado law limits sales tax levies to a total of 7 percent by 
all entities, with a few minor exceptions. If the town's 3 percent goes into 
effect and is added to the state's 2.91 percent, no room remains for a county 
levy within town limits.</p> 
<p>Consequently, if voters approve the county tax, a confrontation appears to 
be in the offing between the county and the town as to which entity's tax will 
prevail.</p> 
<p>The county position is, if it can show voter approval is a continuation of 
the existing tax, then it becomes obvious the existing tax will not expire Jan. 
1,2003, and the town's tax will not automatically kick in. The county position 
is supported by Colorado Counties, Inc. attorneys, according to Crabtree. The 
county intends to word the ballot question to support the idea that this will 
be a continuation and not expiration of the existing tax.</p> 
<p>The town's position, supported by the town's attorney according to Town 
Manager Jay Harrington, is that the existing tax will expire, to be 
automatically replaced Jan. 1, 2003, by the town tax.</p> 
<p>Town officials say they put the issue before the voters in order to ensure 
their sales tax revenue stream is not interrupted. The town has asked the 
county for guarantees that any action by the county not interfere with that 
revenue stream. The town is also seeking to avoid any activity by county 
citizens to change the distribution of sales tax income. Such an activity 
occurred when county citizens tried by initiative to change the current 50-50 
county-town split. That attempt failed, but similar attempts could recur.</p> 
<p>In any event, the county and town pledge fidelity to each other. Each says 
it enjoys the harmonious working relationship shared over the past few years. 
Each promises to share with the other in the future, regardless of whether 
voter action Nov. 6 leaves the county or the town in the driver's seat as far 
as the sales tax is concerned.</p> 
<p>The county promises to make a final decision on ballot wording either next 
week or the following week, after receiving advice from the CDR. The county 
hopes that advice will give them confidence their ballot wording will establish 
the Nov. 6 results as a renewal or extension of the existing tax, if voters say 
yes.</p> 
<p>Ballot information must be submitted to County Clerk and Chief Elections 
Officer June Madrid by Sept. 12, Madrid said, in order to be placed on the Nov. 
6 ballot.</p> 
<p></p> <b>School superintendent outlines</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>focus for board of education</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Richard Walter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Where does our school district stand now and where is it headed? </p> 
<p>Those questions were put somewhat into perspective Tuesday night by 
Superintendent Duane Noggle as he outlined for the board of education for 
Archuleta School District 50 Joint his concept of a District Focus.</p> 
<p>Using a slide presentation which already had been screened by principals, 
Noggle said the basis of the concept is a Belief Statement which includes these 
precepts:</p> 
<p>&#128; All people are of inherent and infinite worth. For example, Noggle 
said, &quot;the bus drivers are the Mickey Mouse of our schools. A smile and a 
welcome from them make it a place where dreams and fantasies can be fulfilled. 
They are the first 'teachers' the students meet</p> 
<p>&#128; All students have the right to receive effective instruction. 
&quot;If our teachers are not prepared,&quot; Noggle said, &quot;how can they 
expect the student to be?&quot;</p> 
<p>&#128; Developing self-esteem and self-reliance is a prime responsibility 
of our school</p> 
<p>&#128; Honest and effective communication is vital to positive human 
relations</p> 
<p>&#128; Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect</p> 
<p>&#128; Evaluation provides feedback to improve teaching and student progress
</p> 
<p>&#128; All students have the right to develop their individual potential 
and to assume responsibility for their decisions and actions. &quot;We can't 
discipline education or mandate learning,&quot; Noggle said</p> 
<p>&#128; Education is the responsibility of the school and the student in 
cooperation with the home and the community. &quot;Everyone must work together 
to make the schools live up to their responsibility,&quot; Noggle said. 
&quot;That's one reason I came here . . . I saw every evidence that this is a 
district that cares about the kids</p> 
<p>&#128; Everyone has the right to learn and function in a safe and 
appropriate environment, and, finally</p> 
<p>&#128; All students can learn.</p> 
<p>Noggle told the board he has based his plan on effective team building - 
with well-versed and productive personnel in key leadership positions and 
referred to a four-stage plan involving Forming, Storming, Norming and 
Performing.</p> 
<p>&quot;We've accomplished the forming stage with our new principals and 
assistants,&quot; he said. &quot;The storming phase will come when there are 
times that we do not agree. The norming will involve eliminating the extremes 
in educational philosophies to find a common track and the ultimate goal will 
be performing.&quot;</p> 
<p>The superintendent said a district support team representing business, 
transportation, maintenance and food service divisions will meet every Thursday 
and make recommendations to the administration.</p> 
<p>Noggle told the board he intends to have regular Superintendent Chat 
Sessions. &quot;I'll go to every school,&quot; he said, &quot;so all members of 
the staff have an opportunity to meet with me and discuss programs and/or 
problems,&quot; and an accountability committee will meet monthly to review 
program progress.</p> 
<p>He also said he plans to have regular Superintendent's Forums - &quot;an 
open office to the people of the community . . . leaders, parents, public 
officials . . . for open exchange of ideas . . . for public engagement in the 
school process.&quot;</p> 
<p>He said school should be fun, safe, exciting, interesting and 
well-organized.</p> 
<p>To make the system work, he said, some revisions in curriculum are needed.
</p> 
<p>For example, he said, we need to take a stronger look at vocational 
education. &quot;We should start preparing them much earlier than high school - 
perhaps even at upper grade school levels.&quot;</p> 
<p>Special education, too, needs a hard look and perhaps most important, is 
fully realizing and utilizing the rapidly increasing field of computer-assisted 
instruction. &quot;The time is coming when the teacher won't just 
lecture,&quot; he said. &quot;The instructor will have a full-blown 
presentation with animation, music and focus of purpose,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our website home page,&quot; he said, &quot;could become an important 
tool in education. We're going to make it much more interactive. Parents will 
be able to see their students' current grades, students will be able to log on 
to get help with a homework question. We will change the form of interaction so 
that all can be involved.&quot;</p> 
<p>Interscholastic activities, he said, will remain a prime focus. Noting 
&quot;nearly half the junior high school enrollment is out for fall sports, we 
need to strengthen these programs. Sports is a learning process and we don't 
want that learning to stop once they've reached a given performance level. We 
wand them to be encouraged to be lifelong learners.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Our students,&quot; he said, &quot;must be allowed to experience both 
success and failure. Experimental education should challenge them to try new 
things and not be afraid to fail. They can use failure as a basis for striving 
higher . . . as a learning tool, not something to be ashamed of.&quot;</p> 
<p>He told the board staff development will be based in part on Alfie Kohn 
technology and instruction strategy. Technology will be an education key and 
site-based decision making will be emphasized (parameters will be set, 
organizational structure determined , and decisions made on that basis).</p> 
<p>A lone reference to recent Colorado Scholastic Aptitude Proficiency (CSAP) 
test scores, involved his note that &quot;training will be made available for 
staff, not by teaching to the test, but by teaching concept understanding.&quot;
</p> 
<p>He advised the board its goals should be:</p> 
<p> To provide a program of safety and health instruction for living in a 
change world</p> 
<p> To offer understanding and appreciation of the creative arts and science 
in the modern world</p> 
<p> To provide, through experiences in democratic living, understanding and 
appreciation of our form of government, emphasizing obligations of citizenship 
and social responsibility</p> 
<p> To develop understanding of and respect for all people, emphasizing their 
rights as world citizens and their responsibilities as such</p> 
<p> To encourage participation in community living by sharing in leadership 
and service experiences. (At some point, he said, seniors should be required to 
have a service requirement for graduation . . . working in a fire station, 
cleaning ambulances, assisting in traffic control . . . for example)</p> 
<p>To provide individual counseling to assist each student in selecting and 
preparing for a career though a program of higher education, 
vocational/technical or work immediately after graduation</p> 
<p> To maximize parent/community involvement in education</p> 
<p> To make most effective use of time in the classroom, increasing percentage 
of instruction/learning time</p> 
<p> To maximize cooperation in the use of district facilities and programs</p> 
<p> To maximize communication in the school system so that teachers, students, 
administrators, parents and the public are fully aware of what is being done to 
educate children and adults.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our ultimate goal,&quot; he said, &quot;is to assist every child in 
performing to their maximum potential and talents. Their performance depends 
upon our performance.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> <b>Development director post to</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Bayfield man</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By John M. Motter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Greg Comstock, a Bayfield resident, accepted employment Tuesday afternoon 
as Director of County Development for Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Comstock's hiring is based on a recommendation from an advisory committee 
appointed by the county commissioners which interviewed candidates for the 
position. At the Tuesday morning regular meeting of county commissioners, the 
board entered executive session to discuss hiring Comstock.</p> 
<p>The item was not listed on the meeting agenda. Colorado law allows 
executive sessions, even if not listed on the agenda, if a majority of the 
governing board involved vote to do so. Tuesday, the commissioners voted 
unanimously to enter executive session to discuss this subject and other 
subjects noted on the agenda. After adjourning from the executive session, they 
instructed Administrative Assistant Kathy Wendt to make an offer to Comstock.
</p> 
<p>Wendt disclosed Tuesday afternoon that Comstock accepted the county's 
$45,000 a year offer. Comstock replaces former County Director of Planning Mike 
Mollica, who resigned in March of this year.</p> 
<p>Comstock will be in charge of the county planning department responsible 
for developing and implementing regulations connected with county growth and 
development.</p> 
<p>He hopes to report for work Aug. 27, but could be delayed until Sept. 4 
because of prior work obligations.</p> 
<p>Comstock has been employed in the planning field since 1975 when he 
accepted a position with the city of Fresno, Calif. From 1999 through 2000, 
Comstock was a principal planner with Durango. From 1995 to 1999, Comstock was 
city planner for Spanish Fork, Utah, and from 1992-1995 a planning consultant 
for High Country Planning of Heber, Ariz.</p> 
<p>The new county director earned a bachelor of arts degree in economics and 
geography from California State University at Fresno in 1973. He added a 
master's degree in urban and regional planning at the same university in 1976.

<p>At long last, Archuleta School District 50 Joint has a nearly full 
complement of teachers for the beginning of the school year Sept. 4, and there 
is one surprise in the mix.</p> 
<p>Veteran Intermediate School Principal Butch Madrid, who retired at the end 
of the last school year, was named Tuesday night as the new Dean of Students at 
Pagosa Springs Elementary School.</p> 
<p>Madrid was not at the school board meeting and was out of town Wednesday 
and unavailable for comment on his return to the school system staff.</p> 
<p>Also at the elementary school level, the board named Carolyn Riedberger as 
a first grade teacher.</p> 
<p>At the intermediate school/junior high level, Shawna Bolt was named to the 
vacant music teacher position and Pam Miller hired as a resource teacher aid.
</p> 
<p>At the junior high school level, Susan Garman was appointed to fill a 
mathematics department vacancy, Mike Blum was named an assistant football coach 
and Melanie Cowan appointed an assistant volleyball coach.</p> 
<p>In the high school, Jim Shaffer was named an assistant varsity football 
coach and Troy Persson an assistant varsity golf coach.</p> 
<p>In other personnel action, Errol Hohrein was hired as a half-time person in 
maintenance, former transportation director John Rose was transferred to a 
mechanic's position (after a one-hour board executive session to hear the final 
report on an investigation of charges against Rose) and Bruce Knudsen was named 
to the transportation director post, pending his approval of the contract.</p>

<p></p> <b>Non-resident owners protest FUSA fees to PLPOA board</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Richard Walter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>It is an issue that won't go away. </p> 
<p>Despite at least two prior lawsuits which went against the complainants, 
the question of recreation fees levied by Fairfield USA against some properties 
in the Pagosa Lakes communities has risen again.</p> 
<p>And this time, a protagonist against the fees is hoping to garner enough 
support among others being assessed, to bring a class action suit to suspend 
efforts to collect. </p> 
<p>Robert G. Schmideler of Longmont told Pagosa Lakes Property Owners 
Association directors Thursday that he has owned property in Lakeview Estates, 
off Lighthouse Drive, since 1990.</p> 
<p>&quot;I am a victim of Fairfield Association,&quot; he said. &quot;A victim 
of recreation fees being billed since 1991.&quot; </p> 
<p>At time of purchase, he said, &quot;no one, not Fairfield representatives, 
the title company or anyone else ever mentioned the recreation fee. It was my 
belief our only obligation was to pay taxes and association dues. No one 
mentioned the $15 monthly recreation fee nor the $14 monthly fee for having a 
water line past the property.&quot; (Editors note: Fairfield's FUSA fee does 
not include a water availability fee. It is assessed by the Pagosa Area Water 
and Sanitation District.)</p> 
<p>He told the board he initially paid the fee, even though he was unaware of 
the codicil in his deed outlining it. &quot;That was my fault,&quot; he said, 
&quot;for not reading the fine print closely. But finally, I decided, the 
property is vacant, I don't occupy it and there is no structure on it. There is 
no reason I should have to pay a monthly fee for nothing in return.&quot;</p> 
<p>When Fairfield went into bankruptcy, he said, &quot;we were told PLPOA will 
take over operation of recreation facilities and I withheld payment thereafter, 
assuming my PLPOA dues were inclusive of such fees.&quot;</p> 
<p>Then, he said, &quot;I started receiving letters from Fairfield threatening 
suit. At present, I am over $3,000 in arrears on a fee that has no purpose. 
Every contract should be bilateral. If a fee is required, something should be 
provided for that fee. In this case there is no service.&quot;</p> 
<p>Schmideler told the board he decided to sell the property and, after an 
engineering feasibility study, was told it would cost $25,000 to $30,000 to 
bring it up to grade. A neighbor, hoping to stop construction on the lot and 
protect her view, he said, made him an offer of $11,000 (roughly 60 percent of 
what he paid for the property). &quot;I drew up a temporary purchase-sale 
agreement and went to a local title company proposing consolidation of the two 
lots. I had the deed with me. I was told no title firm could issue a title 
policy or handle the case in any way until the amount in arrears is paid.</p> 
<p>&quot;There are approximately 1,900 of your PLPOA members who are victims 
of the Fairfield covenant,&quot; he said, and &quot;we believe it is incumbent 
upon you to make a move to get this fee set aside.&quot;</p> 
<p>He asked directors to support a move to form a local legal defense fund to 
help victimized property owners fight the fee assessment through a class action 
suit, saying he intends to advertise for any such property owners who want to 
be party to the suit.</p> 
<p>PLPOA board president Richard Manley told Schmideler the same type of 
suggestion was broached during the annual meeting last month and that then, as 
now, the board has no jurisdiction in such actions.</p> 
<p>There is some agreement, he said, that proportionately few of those being 
assessed the fee get any service for it. &quot;The recreation center is now 
ours, and the golf course is a private enterprise. Some Fairfield members get 
reduced rates there, but those mostly are timeshare and condo users.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;It is a general feeling of this board,&quot; he said, &quot;that 
something needs to be done. We have determined areas where we can negotiate 
with Fairfield and we are working on putting the question of FUSA fees into 
that negotiation equation. Any question of litigation would be well down the 
road. We'd much prefer to settle amicably on a negotiated answer.</p> 
<p>&quot;That doesn't mean that you, as a property owner, can't enlist others 
in the same situation to join in your quest,&quot; he continued. &quot;I'd be 
willing to bet the left half of my house, however, that if litigation is 
enacted, all negotiations on our part would be down the tubes.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director David Bohl said, &quot;People paying the fee have a very 
legitimate complaint and have a right to take legal action. But, this board has 
to be neutral. The property owners should have been advised of the fees, should 
have read it for themselves, but still have the right to seek relief.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director Thomas Cruse asked to be put on record &quot;that I'm opposed to 
this board becoming involved, as a board, in this issue.&quot;</p> 
<p>From another section of the audience, Schmideler's quest was taken up by 
Edie Cook who told the board she is a California resident but owns two lots on 
Beaver Circle in Lake Forest Estates and leases out a home on the property.</p> 
<p>&quot;I, too, was never notified by Fairfield or anyone connected with it - 
or by the title company - at the time of purchase that such a fee existed. I 
got a letter from Fairfield in 1994 saying I owed $600 in back fees . . . an 
amount that is now up to several thousand dollars.</p> 
<p>&quot;Those of us being assessed this fee represent about 20 percent of 
PLPOA membership,&quot; she said, &quot;and we feel you should be acting on our 
behalf to put a stop to this. </p> 
<p>&quot;As you can tell, I'm really distressed by this. I was told there 
would be an attorney here tonight with answers for us but I don't see one. I, 
too, want to sell, but cannot do so with the unpaid fees - for which I've 
received no benefit - hanging over me.</p> 
<p>&quot;Since I, and most of the others pay our PLPOA dues regularly,&quot; 
she said, &quot;I should think you'd be obligated to represent us in our 
predicament.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bohl reiterated, &quot;This was all the result of a court decision. The 
courts upheld the fee. I was warned when I first came to town that the courts 
had ruled against the property owners. It was a matter of public record. PLPOA 
is not and should not be a party to the fee dispute except in negotiation. It 
was a contractual obligation.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director Gerald Smith said &quot;it is not PLPOA's place to represent you 
in this issue. You signed the documents.&quot;</p> 
<p>Still, Cook was adamant. &quot;There's something wrong if you negotiate 
with them without taking up our interest,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>When Schmideler asked the board if members were aware &quot;some of the 
court decisions have been set aside here in Archuleta County?&quot; general 
manager Walt Lukasik said, &quot;One such case has been appealed by 
Fairfield.&quot;</p> 
<p>Manley told the fee payers, &quot;We appreciate what you have said. I don't 
know how we can express ourselves on title agencies or realtors who did not do 
their job. Buyer diligence is required. It has gone to court several times and 
the FUSA fees have been upheld.</p> 
<p>&quot;It is out of our hands,&quot; he said. &quot;We choose not to get 
into litigation. It may be that through our negotiations on other matters we 
can achieve a trade-off on FUSA fees, but that is not a promise. It is 
something we are working on. And, we're aware it is an issue which won't go 
away.&quot;</p> 
<p>Schmideler thanked the board for its time and &quot;the great job you've 
been doing. I will push this issue independently and hope to garner support of 
other fee payers. </p>

with Fairfield and we are working on putting the question of FUSA fees into 
that negotiation equation. Any question of litigation would be well down the 
road. We'd much prefer to settle amicably on a negotiated answer.</p> 
<p>&quot;That doesn't mean that you, as a property owner, can't enlist others 
in the same situation to join in your quest,&quot; he continued. &quot;I'd be 
willing to bet the left half of my house, however, that if litigation is 
enacted, all negotiations on our part would be down the tubes.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director David Bohl said, &quot;People paying the fee have a very 
legitimate complaint and have a right to take legal action. But, this board has 
to be neutral. The property owners should have been advised of the fees, should 
have read it for themselves, but still have the right to seek relief.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director Thomas Cruse asked to be put on record &quot;that I'm opposed to 
this board becoming involved, as a board, in this issue.&quot;</p> 
<p>From another section of the audience, Schmideler's quest was taken up by 
Edie Cook who told the board she is a California resident but owns two lots on 
Beaver Circle in Lake Forest Estates and leases out a home on the property.</p> 
<p>&quot;I, too, was never notified by Fairfield or anyone connected with it - 
or by the title company - at the time of purchase that such a fee existed. I 
got a letter from Fairfield in 1994 saying I owed $600 in back fees . . . an 
amount that is now up to several thousand dollars.</p> 
<p>&quot;Those of us being assessed this fee represent about 20 percent of 
PLPOA membership,&quot; she said, &quot;and we feel you should be acting on our 
behalf to put a stop to this. </p> 
<p>&quot;As you can tell, I'm really distressed by this. I was told there 
would be an attorney here tonight with answers for us but I don't see one. I, 
too, want to sell, but cannot do so with the unpaid fees - for which I've 
received no benefit - hanging over me.</p> 
<p>&quot;Since I, and most of the others pay our PLPOA dues regularly,&quot; 
she said, &quot;I should think you'd be obligated to represent us in our 
predicament.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bohl reiterated, &quot;This was all the result of a court decision. The 
courts upheld the fee. I was warned when I first came to town that the courts 
had ruled against the property owners. It was a matter of public record. PLPOA 
is not and should not be a party to the fee dispute except in negotiation. It 
was a contractual obligation.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director Gerald Smith said &quot;it is not PLPOA's place to represent you 
in this issue. You signed the documents.&quot;</p> 
<p>Still, Cook was adamant. &quot;There's something wrong if you negotiate 
with them without taking up our interest,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>When Schmideler asked the board if members were aware &quot;some of the 
court decisions have been set aside here in Archuleta County?&quot; general 
manager Walt Lukasik said, &quot;One such case has been appealed by 
Fairfield.&quot;</p> 
<p>Manley told the fee payers, &quot;We appreciate what you have said. I don't 
know how we can express ourselves on title agencies or realtors who did not do 
their job. Buyer diligence is required. It has gone to court several times and 
the FUSA fees have been upheld.</p> 
<p>&quot;It is out of our hands,&quot; he said. &quot;We choose not to get 
into litigation. It may be that through our negotiations on other matters we 
can achieve a trade-off on FUSA fees, but that is not a promise. It is 
something we are working on. And, we're aware it is an issue which won't go 
away.&quot;</p> 
<p>Schmideler thanked the board for its time and &quot;the great job you've 
been doing. I will push this issue independently and hope to garner support of 
other fee payers. </p> 
<p></p> <b>Forest Service invites comment on proposed land swap</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Public comments are now being accepted on an environmental assessment of a 
land exchange whereby the U.S. Forest Service would acquire 160 acres of 
private land within the boundaries of the San Juan National Forest in Dolores 
County.</p> 
<p>In exchange, Robert D. Lindner Ranches would acquire 104 acres of National 
Forest adjoining its private property in Hinsdale and Mineral counties, 
northwest of Pagosa Springs. </p> 
<p>Paul Beaber, San Juan National Forest land surveyor and realty specialist, 
said Forest Service acquisition of the private inholding two miles northeast of 
Rico is in the public interest.</p> 
<p>&quot;It will protect the Town of Rico's watershed in the Silver Creek 
drainage, secure legal public access to the Circle Trail and Forest Development 
Road 551, and enhance recreational opportunities,&quot; Beaber said.</p> 
<p>Under the proposed exchange, Lindner Ranches would consolidate land 
ownership by acquiring public land intermingled with private lands near the 
East Fork of the Piedra River. The ranch is adjacent to the Pagosa Ranger 
District of the San Juan National Forest.</p> 
<p>&quot;Private acquisition of these federal lands would allow Lindner 
Ranches to undertake important river restoration activities,&quot; said Adam 
Poe of Western Land Group.</p>

<p></p> <b>Nov. 6 election will be conducted exclusively by mail</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By John M Motter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Archuleta County voters are restricted to casting ballots by mail for the 
Nov. 6, 2001, general election.</p> 
<p>Colorado law allows mail ballot elections during odd years, according to 
June Madrid, the Archuleta County Clerk and chief elections official. The 
county commissioners approved a resolution May 1 specifying that this year's 
election be by mail ballot. Consequently, all elections in the county this year 
must be by mail ballot, Madrid said.</p> 
<p>Local taxing entities, excepting the school district, may conduct elections 
apart from the county, according to Madrid, but they still must be mail ballot 
elections. The school district and the state must conduct their elections 
through the county election office. Other entities may choose to let the county 
conduct elections for them.</p> 
<p>At this early stage, it appears the county, school district, hospital 
district, and the state will have issues on the Nov. 6 ballot, according to 
Madrid. School board candidates will also be on the ballot. The hospital 
district has chosen the county to conduct its election.</p> 
<p>Madrid is currently looking at three or four ballot styles. Special 
districts must certify ballot information to Madrid by Sept. 12.</p> 
<p>Madrid will then order ballots printed. Ballots will be mailed to voters no 
earlier than Oct. 12 and no later than Oct. 22. No early voting is possible 
under the mail-out process. Voters may return ballots directly by dropping them 
in a ballot box located in the county clerk's office.</p> 
<p>In order to receive a ballot, voters who move or change address must give 
Madrid a correct mailing address by Oct. 5.</p> 
<p>Only active voters receive a ballot to vote Nov. 6. Those who voted in the 
2000 general election are considered active voters. Even so, if they have 
changed addresses since the 2000 general election, they must provide Madrid 
with a current address.</p> 
<p>Persons who did not vote in the 2000 general election are not considered 
active voters. Consequently, they must visit the county clerk's office in the 
county courthouse and update their record. The last date to register or update 
a record and be eligible to vote is Oct. 5.</p> 
<p>Registration can be accomplished in person by visiting the county clerk's 
office in the courthouse, or by mail if using the correct form. The correct 
form must be obtained from the clerk's office.</p> 
<p>Currently, 8,063 voters are registered in Archuleta County. By party 
affiliation there are 4,414 Republicans, 2,007 unaffiliated, 1,623 Democrats, 
12 Green Party, 5 Libertarian, 1 Reform Party, and 1 American Constitution 
Party.</p> 
<p>During the 2000 general election, 4,814 votes were cast in Archuleta County.

<p></p> <b>Postal Service agents probing cluster box vandalism</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Tess Noel Baker</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>A local cluster mailbox was the victim of vandals last week.</p> 
<p>According to Archuleta County Sheriff's Department reports, the cluster box 
at the corner of Meadows Drive and Buttress was pried open from the back. The 
incident was reported Aug. 7.</p> 
<p>Sheriff Captain Bob Grandchamp said the case is under investigation. </p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs Postmaster Richard Love said at this time no mail has been 
reported missing and the Postal Inspection Service has been notified.</p> 
<p>Postal Inspector Randy Stokes, of Colorado Springs, said it may take some 
time to uncover whether or not fraud is involved.</p> 
<p>Letters will be sent to all the people with boxes in the cluster from the 
inspection offices in Denver, he said. Generally that occurs about two weeks 
after the break-in because people don't usually notice missing credit cards or 
checks until after they receive a bank statement, he said.</p> 
<p>&quot;From here we just follow the paper trail,&quot; he said. &quot;We 
wait to see if anything is cashed. Sometimes there will be no fraud if nothing 
of value was found in the box.&quot;</p> 
<p>Although incidents like this are rare in Archuleta County, Lowe said, the 
back of the mailbox that was hit has been changed to provide more security.</p> 
<p>However, around the state, the number of cluster mailbox thefts is on the 
rise. So far this year, over 400 cases have been reported.</p> 
<p>To help prevent mail theft, Love gave these tips:</p> 
<p>&#128; Pick up delivered mail from mailboxes as soon as possible</p> 
<p>&#128; Do not leave outgoing letters in neighborhood cluster box units</p> 
<p>&#128; If possible, take outgoing mail directly to the post office or to a 
blue collection box prior to last pick-up of the day</p> 
<p>&#128; Report suspicious activity or mail theft immediately to a local law 
enforcement agency and to the Colorado Postal Inspectors' 24-hour line at (303) 
313-5320</p> 
<p>&#128; Have the post office hold mail if planning to be gone for long 
periods of time.</p> 
<p>Theft of mail is a felony. Conviction can result in a fine of up to 
$250,000 and up to five years imprisonment.</p> 
<p></p> <b>August rainfall mounting fast but record seems safe</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By John M. Motter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>August rainfall in Pagosa Country totaled 3.13 inches by 7 a.m. yesterday, 
below the maximum ever recorded for August of 5.36 inches, but well above the 
August average of 2.52 inches.</p> 
<p>This past week 1.27 inches of precipitation were measured at Stevens Field 
from Aug. 8 through Aug. 14. Almost one-half an inch, 0.46 inches, fell Sunday 
night and Monday morning. Stevens field is the official local National Weather 
Service gauging station.</p> 
<p>On the average, more precipitation falls during August in Pagosa Country 
than any other month of the year. The August average of 2.52 inches enjoys a 
substantial lead over the next highest average, in October, with its 2.03 
inches. October leads all months for maximum precipitation with 7.8 inches, 
followed by January with 7.79 inches.</p> 
<p>Temperatures last week were on the cool side. Highs averaged 77 degrees, 
lows 53 degrees. The highest temperature, 78 degrees, was measured three times. 
The local thermometer has not reached 90 degrees this season. Last week's 
lowest temperature was 51 degrees.</p> 
<p>Local weather should dry out over the coming weekend, then return to the 
wetter monsoon pattern early next week, according to Gary Chancy, a forecaster 
from the National Weather Service office in Grand Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;Skies will be partly cloudy with a 20 percent chance for afternoon 
and evening showers and thunderstorms through Thursday evening,&quot; Chancy 
said. &quot;The chances for rain are slight over the weekend.&quot;</p> 
<p>A high pressure area over Eastern New Mexico fostering the monsoon 
conditions which have dominated local weather recently will move out over the 
weekend, according to Chancy. Over the weekend, monsoon conditions will be 
replaced by a high pressure area west of Colorado creating northerly wind flows 
with drier air content.</p> 
<p>By Monday afternoon monsoon conditions created by the high pressure area 
over Eastern New Mexico should return, Chancy said.</p> 
<p></p> <b>Light Plant Road bids under estimate</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By John M. Motter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Three bids were opened Friday for rebuilding Light Plant Road from the 
Pagosa Springs town limit south and eastward to Light Plant Road's intersection 
with U.S. 84.</p> 
<p>The project has been divided by Davis Engineering, the county's contract 
engineer, into two phases. Phase 1 extends from the town limits southeastward 
to the Mill Creek bridge. Phase 2 extends from the bridge to U.S. 84. Work on 
Phase 1 begins this fall. Completion is expected some time next spring.</p> 
<p>Low bidder on the project was SLV Earthmovers, Inc. of Monte Vista. SLV 
Earthmovers bid $445,409 on Phase 1, $512,481 on Phase 2. Also attempting to 
get the contract were Strohecker Excavation, Inc. of Bayfield, and Weeminuche 
Construction Authority of Towaoc. Strohecker bid $505,905 on Phase 1 and 
$622,476 on Phase 2. Weeminuche bid $593,969 on Phase 1 and $654,477 on Phase 2.
</p> 
<p>The bids averaged about 12 percent lower than Davis Engineering's estimated 
construction cost.</p> 
<p>Bids will be reviewed by Davis Engineering, contract engineers for the 
county. The county commissioners will not select a bid until they've reviewed 
Davis' recommendations. Following acceptance of a bid, the county and 
successful bidder will negotiate a contract.</p> 
<p>When the project is complete, conversion of the road from gravel to asphalt 
pavement will facilitate entry into town from the southeast. Access to the high 
school complex by way of the Aztec Street bridge across the San Juan River will 
also be improved.</p> 
<p>Archuleta County and Pagosa Springs share responsibility and funding for 
the projects. Much of the money comes from a 2 percent countywide sales tax 
divided equally between the county and the town. The county's portion is 
allocated to a road and bridge capital improvements fund, the town's portion 
goes to a capital improvement's fund.</p> 
<p>In other business, the commissioners: </p> 
<p>&#128; Following a public hearing, adopted changes to the limited impact 
section of county land use regulations</p> 
<p>&#128; Approved a beer and liquor license renewal for the Bavarian Inn</p> 
<p>&#128; Approved an agreement with the state, shifting responsibility for 
Beanpole funding in Southwest Colorado from Archuleta County to La Plata 
County. A separate, but related, contract stipulating conditions of agreement 
among the involved counties was also approved. The involved counties are 
Archuleta, La Plata, San Juan, Montezuma, and Dolores. Also included are the 
Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute reservations</p> 
<p>&#128; County Emergency Management Coordinator Russell Crowley was granted 
$7,739.51 with which to upgrade county road maps by hiring a contractor with a 
ground position locater</p> 
<p>&#128; Approved $6,000 for use by the county finance department for 
purchasing additional computer memory </p> 
<p>&#128; Listened to a monthly progress report presented by Social Services 
director Erlinda Gonzalez. Gonzalez was authorized to spend $6,304 for 
installation of wireless computer/telephone equipment. Installation of the 
equipment will allow County Social Services to move from the courthouse to 
contracted facilities in the new Town Hall building.</p> 
<p>Gonzalez reported a district court judge has ordered Archuleta County 
Social Services to provide services for two delinquent minors. The estimated 
cost of the services is $3,000 a month for one and an estimated $13,500 a month 
for the other. A meeting between county officials and the involved judge is 
being arranged in an attempt to work out a solution which won't break Archuleta 
County's budget.</p> 
<p></p> <b>Haitian students go 'Old West' in Pagosa Visit</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> Trip winners: Landscapes leave youngsters in awe 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Tess Noel Baker</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;It's like going to heaven for them.&quot; </p> 
<p>That's how Hugues Bastien, director of Institution Univers, a private 
Christian school in rural Haiti, describes the experience four of his students 
will have over the next few weeks as they explore three American destinations.
</p> 
<p>These students, age 8-10, who started their vacation in Pagosa Springs this 
last week, earned a trip to the United States by achieving top scores on their 
annual academic tests.</p> 
<p>Bastien said the competition is a major incentive for families in 
Ouanaminthe who make a sacrifice just to send a child to school at a cost of 
$45 a year. Because of economic conditions in the rural town of 84,000, 
including a 90-percent unemployment rate, many students' parents are 
uneducated, struggle to provide the basic necessities and have little chance to 
help their students academically.</p> 
<p>&quot;There's no way they would ever dream of coming to the states,&quot; 
he said. The competition at Institution Univers provides the push many of them 
need to encourage their children to excel. After the first of these trips two 
years ago, the excitement only grew and test results showed marked improvement 
for many, Bastien said.</p> 
<p>Another hope, he said, is that the visit to the United States will open the 
children's eyes to the possibilities of prosperity and encourage them to bring 
these ideas back to their own country.</p> 
<p>Nearly everything on the trip has been new to them. The journey to secure 
their visas, a distance of less than 200 miles that takes 12 hours over the 
country's bad roads, was the first time they had seen Port au Prince, Haiti's 
capital. Taking an airplane was another story.</p> 
<p>&quot;The plane is almost like a house,&quot; Rose Saica, age 8, said, 
wide-eyed even describing the experience. </p> 
<p>&quot;Once in Albuquerque, they asked, 'Where are all the people?' because 
they are used to seeing everyone walking,&quot; Bastien said. They also had fun 
learning to ride an escalator, an experience that resulted in a few falls and a 
lot of laughs. </p> 
<p>During their stay in Pagosa, from Aug. 8-15, the new experiences continued 
to pile up. The children attended a rodeo, saw an old west show, met a United 
States senator, took a train ride, rode horses, viewed water falls and went to 
the top of Wolf Creek Pass. Of course, things like Pizza Hut, Alco, washing 
machines and television were all new as well.</p> 
<p>Food firsts are accruing quickly with both good and bad results.</p> 
<p>When asked to name their favorites, the children quickly switched from 
their native French to English. </p> 
<p>&quot;Chicken,&quot; Rosa Saica said. &quot;Ice cream.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;They are eager to try new things,&quot; Char Neill, one of the 
children's hosts, said. &quot;They tried the lemonade, and it was awful. But 
they trusted us enough to try it a second time.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Even the beauty of the country is overwhelming to them,&quot; Bastien 
said.</p> 
<p>Alan Raphael, age 11, was impressed by the water running out of the 
mountains at Treasure Falls. Both Rose Saica and Rose Judith, 8, said the trees 
and flowers were their favorite parts of the landscape here.</p> 
<p>&quot;All the country is mountainous at home,&quot; Bastien said, &quot;but 
bare. Here you see the beauty with the water coming out of the mountains and 
the trees.&quot;</p> 
<p>Shopping has been a big hit. In fact, the United Methodist Thrift Shop was 
one of the first stops.</p> 
<p>&quot;Things here are very precious to them,&quot; Bastien said. &quot;They 
bought clothes for themselves, their siblings.&quot; Other purchases included 
watches, purses, sunglasses, backpacks and other school supplies.</p> 
<p>People in Ouanaminthe have no electricity and must walk or ride horses. 
Homes are made of concrete blocks, plywood, or sticks and mud. Many of the 
students come to school without having had breakfast. They bring nothing for 
lunch, and may go home to no dinner, he said. Medical conditions are also poor 
with one doctor and two nurses attempting to serve everyone. The life 
expectancy holds at about 53 years of age.</p> 
<p>Bastien, who returned to Haiti to start the school after spending 15 years 
in the United States, said equipping the children of Haiti with a knowledge of 
God and a solid education was the best way to help them gain the tools to 
improve conditions in their own country.</p> 
<p>The school began in 1994 as a kindergarten &quot;L'Univers Des Petits, 
Kindergarten&quot; with 84 children and three teachers. Each year since then, 
Bastien and his staff have attempted to add an additional classroom so that the 
children who started at the school will graduate from high school and, 
hopefully, go on to higher education. Currently the Institution Univers serves 
640 children (300 girls, 340 boys) ranging in age from 2 1/2 to 11 years. The 
staff includes 18 teachers, two assistants, one supervisor, one secretary, 
three custodians, one driver and five administrative directors. Teachers are 
paid $960 per year.</p> 
<p>The students to teacher ratio was key to Bastien's vision for the school. 
Other private schools in the region, are too expensive for local families, 
follow no standard of education and are crowded, having as many as 105 children 
per classroom per instructor. Failure in government exams at the end of high 
school is high.</p> 
<p>At the Institution Univers, courses are offered in Bible studies, writing, 
reading, languages (French and English), math, social studies, music and arts, 
sports, geography of Haiti and history of Haiti.</p> 
<p>A student's day begins at 7:20 a.m. Monday through Friday with an assembly 
around the flag. Bible study is first and lasts about 30 minutes. Then students 
are released to their classrooms for the regular academic program which lasts 
until 1:30 p.m. From 3-5 p.m., an after-school program is offered. On Saturdays 
from 9 a.m. to noon, students return for a sports program, videos, Bible study 
and arts and crafts. On Friday afternoons, music is added and students learn 
songs and study English.</p> 
<p>The school year starts Sept. 1 and runs through June. In July, the school 
offers a summer camp, leaving just one month for vacation.</p> 
<p>All four of the academic achievement winners, two from 2000 who weren't 
able to get visas last year, and two from 2001, said math was their favorite 
subject. When asked why, Alan said &quot;solving problems,&quot; and Ruth Saica 
added &quot;division.&quot; </p> 
<p>The four students began their United States experience in Pagosa Springs 
because of John and Char Neill, members of the United Methodist Church, who met 
Bastien while touring Israel in March of 2000.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have great respect for what he and his staff are trying to 
accomplish in what can only be described as deplorable conditions in all areas 
of employment, government, medical and transportation. Yet their faith that 
their dream will be realized is so strong&#146; we can't help but be affected 
and desirous to help in any way we can,&quot; the Neills said.</p> 
<p>Having the children around for just a few days taught them both a lot.</p> 
<p>&quot;Simplicity,&quot; John Neill said. &quot;We don't need all this stuff 
to be happy people.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Joyfulness,&quot; Char Neill added.</p> 
<p>As for the children, the three girls admitted to missing siblings and 
family. Alan's response to whether or not he was missing home was an immediate, 
&quot;No.&quot;</p> 
<p>When asked what they'd like to take back to Haiti with them, Alan said, 
&quot;a car, $1,000 dollars.&quot;</p> 
<p>Rosa Saica and Katiana Agrand, said, &quot;motorcycles.&quot;</p> 
<p>Rose Judith said, &quot;a television.&quot; </p> 
<p>&quot;But then she would need power for the T.V.,&quot; Bastien said, 
smiling at their enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>In the next year, the school staff will be working to secure the funding to 
complete a new multi-purpose room on the campus. When finished, the space will 
be used for an auditorium, gymnasium and cafeteria.</p> 
<p>&quot;Next we're trying to start a feeding program for the students,&quot; 
he said. Other projected 2001 needs include playground equipment, a 
basketball/volleyball court, finishing supplies for the sixth grade classroom 
and a large school bus.</p> 
<p>Members of the United Methodist Church in Pagosa Springs have pledged to 
build a pair of new classrooms for the school at a cost of around $7,000. The 
local Christian Men's Group has agreed to sponsor a teacher for one year.</p> 
<p>From here, the students traveled to Cleveland, Ohio and then on to New York 
City before heading home.</p> 
<p>&quot;We return on Friday and on Monday they must be back in class,&quot; 
he said. &quot;Vacation over.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> <b>Waterfowl bag limits left intact for new season</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Colorado Wildlife Commission approved waterfowl regulations for the 
2001-2002 season Aug. 9 including bag and possession limits similar to those of 
last year.</p> 
<p>The commission also approved a walk-in access hunting program that will 
open up small game and waterfowl hunting on private land in northeastern 
Colorado for hunters who purchase a $20 permit.</p> 
<p>Waterfowl hunters will be able to hunt ducks in the Central Flyway from 
Sept. 29 through Nov. 21, Nov. 3 through Nov. 29 and Dec. 7 through Jan. 20, 
2002. In the Pacific Flyway, duck seasons will run from Sept. 29 through Oct. 
14 and Oct. 24 through Jan. 20, 2002.</p> 
<p>Canvasback ducks may only be harvested during the first segment of each 
season to assure that populations do not fall below Continent-wide objectives.
</p> 
<p>The general goose season in the Central Flyway will run from Nov. 17 
through Feb. 17, 2002 for both dark and light geese. In the Pacific Flyway, the 
season will run from Sept. 29 through Oct. 9 and Oct. 24 through Jan. 20, 2002.
</p> 
<p>The bag limit in the Central Flyway is five dark and 20 light geese. In the 
Pacific Flyway, the bag limit is two geese in aggregate.</p> 
<p>Numerous special seasons were also approved and will be available in the 
Division of Wildlife&#146;s 2001 Waterfowl Brochure.</p> 
<p>The walk-in access program will begin with the start of the pheasant season 
in November and end on the last day of February. In future years, the access 
program will begin on Sept. 1.</p> 
<p>The division is working with community groups and private landowners in 
northeastern Colorado who will participate in the program. The program, modeled 
after successful programs in other states, will open private land previously 
closed to many hunters.</p> 
<p>The $20 fee will pay for the costs of the program including signs and 
publications listing the properties.</p> 
<p>The commission also approved an emergency regulation reducing the sage 
grouse season from 16 to 7 days in North Park and Middle Park. The season will 
now run from Sept. 8 through Sept. 14.</p> 
<p>Division staff members requested the change at the request of local groups 
working with the Division to conserve and protect sage grouse and their habitat.

<p>I have been following the SUN for the past six years since purchasing a 
residence in this beautiful town. Having been involved in some of the local 
county and city government issues in other locations in the past, it is with 
interest that I notice each location has its own self-appointed monitor of how 
their taxes are being spent and who is benefiting the most. I have read most of 
Mr. Sawicki's letters to the paper on a wide variety of issues and he certainly 
keeps up with what's going on around town.</p> 
<p>His latest letter he wrote about the cost of repairing the taxiways at the 
airport was most interesting. Normally I don't agree with a lot of what he says 
but I think he might have a brilliant idea about making the users pay for the 
airport. In fact, it is so good that I want him to push for not only the 
airport being privately run but all of the other public facilities also. We 
should start with the roads and streets. I have never used all the streets that 
exist in town. Just think if we could make each street a toll-road, privately 
ran and operated. Of course the toll charge would be higher for the roads that 
lead to those big homes that have those beautiful views. It would save me a 
bundle of tax money as I am sure it would others. I have never used the fire 
department or emergency medical facilities either. These should also be private 
and just charge us when we actually use them . . . and what about the police 
department. Only the 'bad guys' should pay for their services. That is 
primarily why they are here. Oh and the most costly to me for taxes is the 
public schools. I have no children in the school system in Pagosa. Let's make 
it a private school and just those that have children would be required to 
support it. I suppose we could adjust the cost for the school based on how much 
each child's car cost that they drive to school. Go get 'em Jim, I think I see 
a way to save myself a bundle of money. Next time I am walking from the airport 
to my residence I can laugh at all those silly folk that are paying toll to 
drive their cars around.</p>

<p><b>Believable reasons</b> </p> 
<p>Dear Editor, </p> 
<p>Let me preface this letter by saying that I know Alden Ecker, I like him 
and I voted for him. I also think that all in all he has done a pretty good job 
as a commissioner. Unfortunately, in the past few weeks he's made a couple of 
blunders that I think need to be addressed.</p> 
<p>First, the idea that the taxiway at the airport can be fixed for $250,000 
is absurd! To think that you can take out six inches of clay, and fill it with 
gravel and thereby create an adequate base is ludicrous. I see this as a 
bottomless money pit over the next few years.</p> 
<p>Second, the decision to spend $11,000 to build a guardrail along Piedra 
Road on the pretense that a fence wouldn't stop people from entering the road 
illegally would be laughable if it weren't so expensive. I've been out of town 
quite a bit during the past month, but I don't recall hearing of a rash of 
incidents involving people driving through fences to keep from having to drive 
50 feet to get to a driveway. Come on, you have to come up with something 
better than that.</p> 
<p>Please commissioners, don't think that your constituents are brainless. 
Stop insulting our intelligence and give us believable reasons for your 
decisions.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Phil Bogert</p> 
<p><b>Doesn't understand</b> </p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>It seems our commissioners need to be reminded who actually pays the taxes 
in this county. They did not hesitate to give $200,000 to the airport - a 
constant drain on county coffers, serving less than 1 percent of the county 
population. But, when a group of taxpayers approached the county for 
sponsorship and less than 1/10th that amount of money, they are told they just 
do not know how &quot;modern government&quot; operates.</p> 
<p>It is evident, from their performance that the commissioners do not have 
the vaguest notion of how government operates. Then again, what can we expect 
from a commissioner who illegally cuts the lock and dumps questionable waste in 
the county landfill and another who illegally closes the maintained portion of 
a roadway that has been in use in Archuleta County for close to 100 years then 
dares the county to take him to court over the matter. It is evident the agenda 
of at least two commissioners is either self-serving or serves the interest of 
the wealthy at the expense of the taxpayers. Why is it a commissioner who could 
find funds for unbudgeted road work, couldn't find funds to do something 
constructive for a change?</p> 
<p>Proponents requesting sponsorship and funds should have asked for an 
airport, cut the locks on the landfill and closed Turkey Springs Road - then 
all three commissioners would be in their corner.</p> 
<p>Mr. Crabtree again stuck his foot in his mouth by stating that a 
commissioners' meeting was not an open forum or the place to discuss a park. If 
proponents of the park were scheduled to be on the agenda then any discussion 
regarding the park was in order until the matter was voted on or tabled by the 
board. I did not see where either happened.</p> 
<p>For the commissioners' information, they can form a Park District without 
it being on a ballot. A change in the service plan of the Aspen Springs Metro 
District, however, would require that the district petition the county, which 
would then be required to hold a public hearing on the matter and, if approved, 
refer it to the 6th Judicial District. The court would schedule and hold a 
hearing to determine the validity of the request and could decide to place the 
question on the ballot for approval by the Aspen Springs electorate. Now, let 
one of the commissioners say which method is most feasible.</p> 
<p>Mr. Crabtree's suggestion that the county attempt to imitate the 
&quot;City&quot; could be construed to say that perhaps we should have the Town 
Board and town planners replace the sitting county government. Leadership is 
the key, the Town of Pagosa Springs has it, the County of Archuleta does not.
</p> 
<p>It is not that the people do not understand modern government, it is that 
the sitting &quot;Modern Government&quot; does not understand its people, or 
itself for that matter.</p> 
<p>Thanks,</p> 
<p>Leroy Oldham</p> 
<p><b>Two concerns</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>Two of the concerns before our county commissioners affect us all. I would 
encourage others to express their opinions on these issues.</p> 
<p>1) The Community Plan needs to be implemented in full, with no further 
delays. Every day we do nothing causes the loss of the uniqueness and beauty of 
our community, and the reduction of our value to tourists, on whom our economy 
depends.</p> 
<p>2) Controls on sound emissions should be for both day and night, 24 hours. 
A dog that frequently barks for hours, or a neighbor that most of the day plays 
very loud music whose sound goes beyond their property, ruins the peace we 
need. The occasional loud celebration should be allowed, or a small 
construction project by a handyman, or the occasional weed whacker use (my 
least favorite irritant), but not what I would call chronic noise.</p> 
<p>A time-limited construction project should of course be allowed. There must 
be a common sense way to write such a law.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p> 
<p>Sharon Porter</p> 
<p><b>New technologies</b> </p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>Because of the price of fuel and its volatility in price, we need to start 
to develop new technologies that do not use natural gas or oil.</p> 
<p>We use such energy sources in agriculture, home heating and transportation.
</p> 
<p>We need to develop new technologies that don't depend on oil for such 
purposes.</p> 
<p>Don Reid</p> 
<p><b>Piles of manure</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>Now, isn't it commendable: The Archuleta County Board of Commissioners has 
decided to involve the local taxpayer in their continuing search for solutions 
to county road classification dilemmas by asking for volunteers to staff their 
new Standing Road Committee before they further task County Road and Bridge and 
take them off tearing up taxiways.</p> 
<p>Now, isn't it also sad that those same commissioners did not desire any 
public input on the Stevens Field paving fiasco from other folks in the county 
before they go out for bids? I wonder why they believe that elected officials 
can do as they please on the issue? The people who pay the bills can just fund 
this turkey on a continuing basis and learn to &quot;love it!&quot;</p> 
<p>Well, I smell &quot;Manure&quot; commissioners - piles of it. And what a 
magnificent display of genuine, dedicated and compelling hypocrisy.</p> 
<p>I guess that's just the way things are done here in the &quot;Ol' 
West.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Parade of gardens</b> </p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>Now and for the last three years, the house on the northeast corner of 
Apache and Ninth has had an amazing array of perfect flowers and lawns. Too bad 
they were not included in the recent parade of gardens.</p> 
<p>Lee Sterling</p> 
<p><b>Thanks again</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>After more years than I want to remember, I am not renewing my subscription 
to your fine paper.</p> 
<p>I have not been diligent in reading it, nor do I use the ads since I live 
in Ft. Worth. Also, I have discovered another area in the west that I have 
adopted - Taos. Being a native born New Mexican, (Lovington, November of 1934), 
I've decided when I win the lottery that I'll have a summer place near Taos, 
and not Pagosa. Your influx of westerners that don't like their native place of 
California or Arizona has discouraged me from further plans to settle in your 
area. I'm returning to my roots in New Mexico, although I'll be several hundred 
miles north of my birth place.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Cabaret Diosa</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Audience members at the Four Corners Folk Festival are in for a Latin 
treat. Put on your dancing shoes, because you won't be sitting down when this 
band is through. Don't know the steps? Don't worry, the band will show you how 
to Mambo like there's no tomorrow.</p> 
<p>Contrary to what you may have heard, Cabaret Diosa is not a subversive cult 
planting the seeds of free love and fierce fashion consciousness among today's 
wayward youth. They are not a traveling freakshow or spiritual revival. Cabaret 
Diosa is merely a band.</p> 
<p>Yes, they are known for propagating what has come to be called &quot;Hi-Fi 
Latin Exotica.&quot; And yes, this music has become associated with behavior 
considered by some to be taboo. However, Cabaret Diosa claims no responsibility 
for the actions engaged in by their throngs of devotees once the music takes 
over.</p> 
<p>Simply put, Cabaret Diosa is a nine-piece musical ensemble. A little big 
band if you will. Their passion is Latin music and the &quot;real big 
sound.&quot; Their mission: to make you dance. To dance as if it were your last 
night on earth, as if your very pants were aflame. This may explain the 
allegations of audience impropriety, etc.</p> 
<p>If you are offended by the Mambo or the Rumba or the Cha Cha Cha the band 
is sorry and truly saddened. But if you are free, join in the new mambo revival 
as the caravan races headlong toward paradise. Be not afraid, they come in 
peace.</p> 
<p>The festival takes place Aug. 31-Sept. 2 on Reservoir Hill. Tickets for the 
Four Corners Folk Festival are on sale at Moonlight Books and Howlin' Wolf 
Music at advance prices through Aug. 29. After that they many be purchased at 
the gate at higher prices. Information is available by calling 731-5582.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Gridiron Pirates are preparing to put IML title on the line</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By John M. Motter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Pads are popping at Golden Peaks Stadium as Head Coach Myron Stretton's 
Pirates begin defense of their Intermountain League 2A football title.</p> 
<p>This year, for the first time, Pagosa gridders play all games, home and 
away, under the lights. All games start at 7 p.m. Friday night with the 
exception of Bloomfield and Piedra Vista. The Bloomfield game starts at 7 p.m. 
Saturday, Sept. 22 in Pagosa Springs. The Piedra Vista game starts at 7:30, 
Friday, Sept. 14, on the Piedra Vista turf.</p> 
<p>Stretton and his assistant coaches pushed 37 padless, grunting, first-team 
candidates through a series of wind sprints, jumping jacks, and special team 
exercises on Monday, the first day of two-a-days.</p> 
<p>Players wriggled into pads today for the first time this season. Contact 
with opposing gridders is scheduled Friday or Saturday next week against the 
Alamosa Mean Moose. </p> 
<p>In his fourth season at the Pirate helm last year, Stretton was chosen 
Coach of the Year by fellow IML coaches. Last year, the Pirates were 7-2 for 
the regular season, 4-0 in league play.</p> 
<p>Repeating as league champs will require all of Stretton's coaching skills. 
Only five starters return from last year's champions. Missing are most starters 
from last year, including league most valuable player, Tyrel Ross.</p> 
<p>Leading the returnees on the offensive side is senior Ronnie Janowski, All 
IML at quarterback last year. Joining Janowski on the offensive eleven are 
all-purpose back Darin Lister, a senior, and defensive end Jason Schutz, a 
sophomore. Lister also handled most of the Pagosa punting and kicking chores 
last year.</p> 
<p>Returning starters on the defensive side of the ball are junior linebacker 
Pablo Martinez, an all-league honorable mention, and senior lineman Ethan 
Sanford.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's too early to predict how we'll turn out this year,&quot; 
Stretton said. &quot;I haven't evaluated the other teams, yet. Our preseason 
schedule appears to be brutal again.&quot;</p> 
<p>Stretton expects to continue the multiple-offense attack he has employed 
with success during his four-year tenure as head coach. On defense, he will 
continue the 43-D, a defense dictated by personnel.</p> 
<p>Assisting Stretton with coaching duties this year are Sean O'Donnell, who 
will work with the offensive line and defensive backs; Scott White, who will 
work with offensive backs and defensive ends; Randy Sorenson, who will work 
with receivers and defensive backs; and Jim Shaffer, who will work with the 
defensive and offensive lines. Volunteer helpers are Mike Marshall and Chris 
Kelley.</p> 
<p>The Pirate schedule is the same as last year. August 29 Pagosa journeys to 
Dolores to engage the 1A Bears at 7 p.m. Following the Dolores game are 
successive preseason games against powerful New Mexico schools.</p> 
<p>Pagosa hosts Kirtland Sept. 7, travels to Piedra Vista in Farmington Sept. 
14, travels to Bloomfield, Sept. 22, then hosts Taos Sept. 28.</p> 
<p>IML action begins Oct. 5 on the Ignacio Bobcat field. The Centauri Falcons 
come to Pagosa Oct. 12, Pagosa plays at Bayfield Oct. 19, and closes the 
regular season by hosting the Monte Vista Pirates Oct. 26.</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Bob Howard</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Men's Golf League event Aug. 8 had no complicated 
format, no unusual scoring system, just good, old-fashioned quality golf in an 
individual low gross and low net competition.</p> 
<p>Troy Persson took the honors in the gross competition with an even-par 71, 
followed by Sean O'Donnell at 75, and Gene Johnson at 80.</p> 
<p>Bob Chitwood bested the field (and his handicap) by a wide margin, winning 
the net competition with an 11-under-par 60. Alan Leo was second with a 66 and 
Ray Henslee was third with 69.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're now halfway through the league season and many of our golfers 
are in mid-season form, playing better than their handicaps,&quot; said Alan 
Schutz, assistant course professional. &quot;Net scores in the 60s by mid- and 
high-handicappers prove that everyone has a chance to win in our league.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The Men's League is open to golfers of all levels. League dues are $25 for 
the season, payable in the pro shop. Competition begins every Wednesday at 1 
p.m. Sign up in the men's locker room before 5 p.m. the Tuesday afternoon 
before each play day.</p> 
<p></p> <b>'Special talents' developing on soccer field</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Richard Walter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>The always effervescent Lindsey Kurt-Mason is as enthusiastic as ever about 
his team's chances, but seems a little more reserved this year.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Pirates soccer coach thinks his squad can be a challenger for 
honors but he's not going overboard with predictions.</p> 
<p>Gone from the 2000 squad, which surprised many with an advance to state 
quarterfinal play against Denver Christian, is all-everything midfielder Daniel 
Crenshaw, the player Kurt-Mason counted on as his inspirational leader, and 
striker Mike Pierce who was a constant offensive threat.</p> 
<p>But returning are a cadre of experienced juniors who were starters in 2000, 
including Kurt-Mason's son, Jordan, a key to the Pirate defensive scheme, Zeb 
Gill, who roamed at left striker, and team scoring leader Kyle Sanders. The 
latter was injured in a boating accident last weekend, was present but unable 
to perform Monday, but was in action Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Add to that mix returning senior Trent Sanders, veteran goalkeepers Matt 
Mesker and Josh Soniat, both of whom can also play attack positions, and 
defensive stalwarts Ryan Lister and Reuben Coray, and you have the makings of a 
standout squad.</p> 
<p>Kurt-Mason had 20 players on the field for the first day of practice Monday 
morning, 26 Tuesday afternoon, and expected several more to straggle in as 
family vacations and summer jobs end.</p> 
<p>&quot;They've been working hard and I've seen some strong leadership from 
the veterans,&quot; Kurt-Mason said. &quot;I see some special talents being 
exhibited on the practice field and evidence of melding together as a team 
already.&quot;</p> 
<p>In the first week, he said, &quot;the kids are normally sucking wind. But 
this group came in great shape. Many have participated in summer camps and have 
worked out on their own in order to be ready for the season.&quot;</p> 
<p>To put his feelings about the team into one word, Kurt-Mason said, 
&quot;Call me 'happy.'&quot;</p> 
<p>Colorado High School Activities Association has placed Pagosa Springs in a 
league that may exist mostly on paper.</p> 
<p>In addition to the Pirates, the league includes Bayfield (which Pagosa 
ousted from playoff contention in a home field shootout last year), Center, 
which withdrew from participation late last season, Sierra Grande (which did 
not field a team last year and probably won't this year), and LaVeta, which 
fielded a coed team last year and gave several others a run for their laurels.
</p> 
<p>The Pirate schedule shows home and home against Bayfield, and no games 
against any of the other teams in their league.</p> 
<p>Instead, they are scheduled for home and home matches against perennial 
state contender Telluride, Crested Butte and Ridgway and home contests against 
Cortez from Class 4A and Piedra Vista of Farmington.</p> 
<p>Kurt-Mason, if the rains subside enough to allow practice fields to dry, 
hoped to get into full scale intra-squad confrontations by the end of this week.
</p> 
<p>That will leave two weeks of conditioning and play making practice before 
the Sept. 1 home and season opener against the Cortez Panthers.</p> 
<p>Kurt-Mason said he will not name varsity starters for at least another 
week, preferring to work different combinations of players to develop team play 
concepts.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Chamber News</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Sally Hameister</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Local photos needed for screen saver plan</b></p> 
<p>United Way of Southwest Colorado is offering a unique opportunity to spend 
a day on horseback in the stunning San Juan Mountains, witness the wildlife in 
their natural habitat and raise money to support our community all in one fell 
swoop. </p> 
<p>Ride the Weminuche will take place Saturday, beginning at 9 a.m. at the 
historic Poma Ranch located 27 miles north on Piedra Road from U.S. 160.</p> 
<p>Matt Poma will be your host on this wonderful adventure and I can assure 
you, based on my own experience, he is the &quot;host with the most.&quot; No 
one loves the land quite like Matt, and he relishes opportunities to share it 
with other folks. If you have never seen the Poma Ranch, I encourage you to do 
so - it will simply take your breath away.</p> 
<p>The day will include morning and afternoon horseback riding, a real 
chuckwagon lunch including brisket, chicken, ribs and beans, and a live auction 
for western merchandise including a $3,000 scholarship for the Pat Parelli 
International Study Center and an original print from the Lori Salisbury 
Gallery.</p> 
<p>Cost for this day will be $45 if you bring your own horse and tack, or $75 
if you need to rent same. Registration fees include lunch.</p> 
<p>Please call Kathi DeClark at (970) 946-2057 to register or for information 
on available lodging or overnight accommodations for you and/or your horse. 
Don't miss this opportunity to see the 960-acre Poma Ranch, spend a glorious 
day outside, experience a bona fide chuckwagon lunch and support the United Way 
program all at the same time.</p> 
<p><b>Photographers needed</b></p> 
<p>We need all of our talented local photographers to submit slides and 
pictures (with negatives) to us by the end of the month for consideration to be 
featured on our upcoming Chamber of Commerce screen saver.</p> 
<p>Thanks to a thoughtful Pagosa resident who found a screen saver in another 
Colorado town and brought it in for us to see, we decided this would be a great 
project for us. </p> 
<p>After some initial research, we discovered we could create a wonderful 
screen saver and make it very affordable. It will be the perfect stocking 
stuffer for Christmas this year or just generally a great gift for any 
occasion. But, I digress - before we can put the screen saver together with 32 
images, we need the images. We're concentrating on Pagosa scenes, things that 
make us unique even in beautiful Colorado.</p> 
<p>The Chamber screen saver committee spent some time brainstorming on what 
those images might be and came up with, just to name a few, the following: 
Chimney Rock (all seasons), balloons, main street scenes, special events, 
Williams Creek, Four-Mile Falls, Treasure Falls, rodeo, county fair, all winter 
and summer activities and wildlife. Once again, this is not an exclusive list, 
and we are open to any and all suggestions. Naturally, your name will accompany 
your image on the screen saver.</p> 
<p>Please contact us with any questions at 264-2360 or just bring us your 
slides or pictures (with negatives) on or before Aug. 31. This will be just 
another cool way to make all your friends and relatives jealous that you live 
in such a beautiful place.</p> 
<p><b>Newsletter inserts</b></p> 
<p>Believe it or not, it's once again time to bring us your inserts for the 
September quarterly newsletter, The Chamber Communique.</p> 
<p>For those who may not be familiar with this economic marketing tool, you 
simply bring us 725 copies of your insert (please do not fold) and a check for 
$40, and your message will reach the over 765 Chamber members. We encourage you 
to use colorful paper and both sides if you like. There is just no better way 
to reach more people with fewer dollars. Please bring those to us by Aug. 29 
for inclusion in the newsletter. We try to get the newsletter out some time the 
first week of September, and we would love to include your insert. It's a 
terrific way to let people know more about a move, a special you're offering, a 
big sale or clearance, new owners, a new service - just about anything. </p> 
<p>Call us at 264-2360 with any questions.</p> 
<p><b>Membership</b></p> 
<p>As September approaches, more and more renewals come with it, and this week 
it seems that new members are heading our way as well. We have six new members 
to introduce to you this week and fourteen renewals. Grab a cup of coffee, curl 
up and relax.</p> 
<p>Three of our new businesses are connected to the Ridgeview Center with busy 
lady Betty Slade at the helm of two. Betty brings us The Ridge at Pagosa 
Springs located at 525 Navajo Trail Drive in the Ridgeview Center. The Ridge 
offers the largest year-round convention and banquet facility in the Four 
Corners area with complete meeting amenities. This facility boasts 6,400 square 
feet and with the capability of serving 700 guests. Vince Sencich with Enzo's 
Catering acts as the in-house caterer for all functions. I personally attended 
a Club 20 meeting at The Ridge last week and can attest that this is a lovely 
meeting place. Please call Betty at 731-3883 for more information about The 
Ridge of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Betty also brings us the Four Corners Gallery of Pagosa located in the 
Ridgeview Center as well. This is an art gallery featuring traditional and 
Southwest art, pottery, jewelry, sculptures, and hand-painted silk scarves. The 
work of many Four Corners artists appears in the Four Corners Gallery of 
Pagosa. Betty Slade would be happy to answer any questions you might have at 
731-3800.</p> 
<p>The third business to join us in the Ridgeview Center is the Antique and 
Collectible Mall with Pamela Suneby as the contact. You will find antiques and 
collectibles ranging from glassware to furniture sold by dealers hailing from 
all over the Four Corners area. I expect word any day that they have opened 
their doors and will share that with you when it comes in. In the meantime, 
please contact Pamela at 731-3800 with any questions.</p> 
<p>Our old pal, Eddie Dale, joins us with a brand new business, 3-D Inspection

<p>Nina Allen joins us next with her home business, Essence of Earth. I ran 
into Nina recently at the Fairfield Arts and Crafts Show and picked up a few of 
her products, and quickly thereafter became addicted to her almond lotion. Nina 
offers all natural handmade soaps, lotions and bath products and will create 
gift baskets for each and every occasion. She will also do custom requests for 
you. Nina offers all natural handmade soaps, lotions, and bath products and

<p></p> <b>Pagosa Lakes</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By Ming Steen</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Littleton, Englewood contestants win triathlon titles</b></p> 
<p>Last Saturday's tenth annual Pagosa Lakes High-Tri Triathlon - a 7.2 mile 
run, 14.4 mile mountain bike and a half-mile swim - went smoothly. In spite of 
the consistent late afternoon monsoons, the trail was ridable with a couple of 
boggy sections. The morning was cool. In short, mother nature cooperated.</p> 
<p>There were 60 participants. Twenty-five of them were from out of town. 
Visiting participants commented on the friendly, family-oriented nature of the 
event and the beauty of the course. The triathlon course includes some 
single-track trail with a couple of technical spots, some woods, some meadows, 
some gravel roads and some asphalt. Occasionally it takes someone from outside 
to remind us of the specialness of this place we call home.</p> 
<p>Local athletes who participated in Saturday's triathlon did enjoy the 
opportunity to pit their athleticism against other participants, particularly 
the unknown competitors from outside of Pagosa. There is, in general, a good 
sense of everyone being there to share the day with each other. Enjoyment is 
partly enhanced by a low stress, but not lightly competitive attitude of 
organizers and participants.</p> 
<p>In the men's overall division, Matt Kattensette from Littleton finished in 
first place with a time of 2 hours 1 minute, 37 seconds. Local triathlete Bob 
Kimber finished in second place with a time of 2 hours 2 minutes, 6 seconds. 
Following in third place was Mark Campbell with 2 hours 3 minutes, 11 seconds. 
Mark is from Ophir.</p> 
<p>In the women's overall division, Debbie Maloney from Englewood crossed the 
finish line with a 2:18.45. Maloney was followed by two Pagosans: Tammy Holcomb 
who finished second in 2:30.13 and I came in third with a 2:30.54.</p> 
<p>In team competition, Reid Kelly, Chantelle Kay and Molly Enright topped the 
field with a 2:00.44. Jack Searle, Carolyn Feller and Chris Nobles came in 
second with a 2:01.14. Byron Monterosso and Courtney Steen, a two-person team 
placed third with a time of 2:03.33. All three teams are from Pagosa. Byron 
recently moved back to L.A., but came back for the triathlon.</p> 
<p>It was a good triathlon - a fantastic success for the 60 smiling, exhausted 
athletes. Everyone was applauded, not just those finishing first.</p> 
<p>Many volunteers offered logistical support the entire morning. These 
volunteers gave form, order and direction to the event. Local businesses, as 
usual, threw in generous prizes. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

<p><b>Horse felled: Bitten by snake in Oklahoma</b></p> 
<p>Rick Majors, the man from Bowling Green, Ky., who had a dream to ride a 
horse to the Rocky Mountains won't make it. He's back home again. T.J., his 
Tennessee Walking Horse, was bitten by a snake near Cherokee, Okla., and it was 
four days before they knew if T.J. would live.</p> 
<p>But Rick, who was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer last February and 
started his trek west in May, is philosophical. He says: &quot;It was an 
adventure I'll never forget, but I don't want to have another. I made a lot of 
friends I'll never forget.&quot;</p> 
<p>And, he continues, &quot;It really restores your faith in mankind, the way 
that people treated me, people I didn't even know. People would take us in, do 
our laundry, give us supper, put us up in hotels, all at their own expense. If 
we offered to pay, they wouldn't take it.&quot;</p> 
<p>But the trip has a silver lining. While passing through Neosho, Mo., T.J. 
injured his foot and the party spent 10 days there. While in Neosho, Rick 
befriended a young boy who was having problems at home and at school. According 
to the boy's mother, who wrote Rick a letter, Rick turned her son around. </p> 
<p>Rick, whose great-grandfather, Alexander Majors, was one of the founders of 
the Pony Express - the others being William Waddle and William Russell - wanted 
to visit the Rocky Mountains. A friend suggested Pagosa Springs as a 
destination. They were to have connected with Pat Parelli upon arrival in 
Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>I think that people will agree it would have been great fun to welcome Rick 
Majors, but in the meantime he says, &quot;I'm glad to be home again. I don't 
think I'll ever leave again.&quot;</p> 
<p>And we can say, &quot;We're glad you thought of us as a destination.&quot;

<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By: Andy Fautheree</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Death benefits help ease family's pain</b></p> 
<p>Throughout the year 2001, it is estimated that an average of 1,500 American 
veterans will die each day. </p> 
<p>While a majority of veteran deaths will come from the aging population of 
those who served in WW I, WW II, and Korea, a disproportionate number will come 
from those who served in Vietnam and the Gulf War. In addition to the many 
lifetime benefits afforded to veterans discharged under other than dishonorable 
conditions, several death benefits are offered to ease the pain of surviving 
family members and to recognize the memory and sacrifice of those who served.
</p> 
<p>Who is eligible? Any veteran who served their required term of service and 
received an appropriate discharge. Benefits include free burial in a National 
Veterans Cemetery, an appropriate headstone or marker, a Presidential Memorial 
Certificate, military funeral honors, a burial flag, and possible reimbursement 
of some burial expenses.</p> 
<p>While burial in a national cemetery is an option to consider, all other 
benefits are available to the family of those interred in community, church or 
private cemeteries. Spouses and minor children of eligible veterans may also be 
buried in national cemeteries without cost. Preparation of the body, 
transportation and the cost of a casket are not normally covered.</p> 
<p>The VA provides headstones or markers for the unmarked graves of veterans 
anywhere in the world and of eligible dependents of veterans buried in military 
post, state veteran or national cemeteries. When burial occurs in other than a 
military post, state veteran or national cemetery, the headstone or marker must 
be applied for from VA. It is free and shipped at government expense; however, 
the VA does not pay the cost of placement. The family must also apply for the 
Presidential Memorial Certificate, the burial flag, and for Military Honors.</p>
<p>VA reimbursement for burial expenses ranges from $0 to $1,500 depending on 
the status of the veteran. If death was the result of a service-connected 
disability rated by the VA, up to $1,500 in expenses are reimbursed. If the 
veteran was eligible to receive VA compensation or pension, or the veteran died 
in a VA facility, up to $300 in expenses are reimbursed. If the veteran was 
discharged from active duty due to a service-connected disability, was eligible 
for VA compensation or pension, or died in a VA facility, the VA will also pay 
a $150 plot allowance for internment in other than a government cemetery.</p> 
<p>Burial benefits are generally available to a veteran's family up to two 
years after the death of the veteran. If you, a family member, friend or 
acquaintance, have experienced the tragic death of a veteran, please call or 
stop by the Veterans Service Office to determine eligibility and to complete 
the appropriate paperwork.</p> 
<p>For information on these and other VA benefits, please call or stop by the 
office located on the lower floor of the Archuleta County Courthouse. The 
office number is 264-2304, the FAX number is 264-5949, and E-mail is 
vsoarch@pagosa.net. The office is open from 8 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday, or Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 
(discharge) for registration with the county, application for VA programs, and 
for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p>Photgraphic show opens at Gallery</p> 
<p>Tonight, tonight won't be like any night. </p> 
<p>Join fellow Pagosans tonight in premiering a new exhibit at the Pagosa 
Springs Arts Council Gallery in Town Park. The opening reception for 
photographic works by Patricia Francis and Denise Mudrock is from 5-7 p.m. at 
the gallery and their images will be on display until Sept. 5.</p> 
<p>Denise Mudrock has made photography an important part of her life since she 
received a 35mm camera for her 16th birthday. She began honing her skills with 
photography classes in high school and, since moving to Pagosa Springs 15 years 
ago, continues learning through local workshops and classes and a great deal of 
shooting.</p> 
<p>While Denise finds much enjoyment in creating the images, she also likes to 
push herself to improve. She especially likes the challenge of entering the 
local arts council photography contests and analyzing the competition.</p> 
<p>Enjoy the familiar as you study Denise's images of the diverse southwest; 
then journey afar with Patricia Francis as she expresses her vision of Italian 
landscapes. </p> 
<p>Patricia also was introduced to photography in her teens. She has spent her 
life in Colorado and New Mexico and the magic scenery inspires her to continue 
developing her photography skills. She studied at the Santa Fe Workshops on the 
Saint John's College campus and, more recently, with Kit Frost at Smiley 
Studios in Durango. These classes have included slot canyon workshops, black 
and white processing, and advanced black and white technique courses.</p> 
<p>When you visit the gallery, allow time to stop in the gift shop which 
features locally created arts and crafts.</p>

<p><b>Use windfall to increase investments</b></p> 
<p>Friday - Colorado Kids, Extension Office, 5 p.m.</p> 
<p><b>It's your money</b></p> 
<p>If you want more money to travel, pay for education for you or your 
children, and have adequate funds to enjoy retirement, now is the time (no 
matter how old you are) to start an investment program by saving those dollars 
that seem to slip away each day.</p> 
<p>One way of achieving your financial dream is to use windfalls such as 
gifts, tax refunds and garage sale earnings to increase your investments. Here 
are several tips on using windfalls to make financial progress.</p> 
<p>&#128; If you are getting a tax refund every year, change your withholding 
exemptions so less tax is withheld from each paycheck. Put extra money into an 
automatic savings plan </p> 
<p>&#128; Invest in yourself. Upgrade your work skills by taking classes</p> 
<p>&#128; Pay off your credit cards or car loan. Put what you were paying each 
month into a savings plan or mutual fund instead</p> 
<p>&#128; If you need better transportation, use a windfall to make the 
largest possible down payment on a vehicle</p> 
<p>&#128; Consolidate all your loans into a single home equity loan. Apply 
your windfall to the amount financed. When you've paid off the home equity 
loan, keep saving. Cut up your credit cards and live on your paycheck</p> 
<p>&#128; Review your home mortgage. There are three ways you can save over 
the life of your mortgage. You can apply the windfall to your principal, which 
could save months of mortgage payments in the future; you can refinance the 
loan at a lower interest rate and add your windfall to the equity, which can 
lower your payments and save thousands of dollars; or you can refinance as a 
15-year mortgage. On a $100,000 fixed-rate loan at 8 percent interest, you will 
pay $90,000 less over the life of the loan than you would with a 30-year 
mortgage</p> 
<p>&#128; Establish an emergency fund by putting your windfall in a money 
market mutual fund</p> 
<p>&#128; Sign up for a class to learn about smart ways to manage money</p> 
<p>&#128; Take your windfall to a consumer credit counseling office and work 
out a total budgeting/debt reduction plan</p> 
<p>&#128; Check out the American Savings Education Council Web site at 
www.asec.org/toolshm.htm &lt;http://www.asec.org/toolshm.htm.&gt; Use their 
interactive Ballpark Estimate to calculate what you might need for retirement. 
Then start your retirement plan right away.</p>

<p><b>Library Internet - World Wide Wait</b></p> 
<p>WWW really stands for &quot;World Wide Wait.&quot; </p> 
<p>At least that how it has seemed the past few weeks. The library Internet

will not get any better.</p> 
<p>The library connection is part of a network and we are at the mercy of many

<p><b>Early Childhood Center - the right start</b></p> 
<p>Young children have important tasks to practice that will eventually 
provide them with a solid base for learning. Each experience they encounter 
with the environment offers a new opportunity to increase their understanding 
of the world.</p> 
<p>The important aspect of their discoveries is how the experience fits into 
their life - how it connects. </p> 
<p>At the Pagosa Early Childhood Center, the belief is that a high quality, 
early childhood program provides a safe and nurturing environment that promotes 
physical, social, emotional and cognitive development of young children while 
responding to the needs of families.</p> 
<p>The main objective is to promote and provide developmentally appropriate 
activities, materials and expectations for children 3 to 5 years old within the 
scope of all comprehensive services of the Head Start performance standards.</p>
<p>They currently have several preschool program options, the first of which 
is the Colorado Preschool Program and Head Start program which both include 
part-day (morning) and part-year plans. They go four days a week, Tuesday 
through Friday, with free breakfast and lunch.</p> 
<p>Families must meet income guidelines. </p> 
<p>Another option is Head Start and Colorado Child Care Assistance (CCAP). 
This is a full-day, full-year program that runs five days a week. Parents must 
be working, in training, or going to school. Families may have a co-payment 
every month, but their children are given free breakfast, lunch and afternoon 
snacks.</p> 
<p>Program similarities include all children receiving the same 
age-appropriate education. They all receive developmental and dental screening. 
Parents receive information and a list of programs on topics including child 
development, child abuse, parenting, etc. They are then assisted in obtaining 
any services suffered by the community.</p> 
<p>Although there are income guidelines to be followed, income is not the only 
major factor for qualifying at Pagosa Early Childhood Center. Margie Lucero, 
area eligibility and program support technician, works with each family to 
thoroughly assess its needs and offer guidance that will help the family attain 
eligibility.</p> 
<p>The main focus of the center right now is meeting target enrollment and 
providing childcare for as many families as possible. Parents are their most 
valuable resource because they are the main source of information concerning 
all aspects of their children. They also inform teachers at the center of 
community needs, from a different point of view. This can reveal a need to 
create and pursue new avenues.</p> 
<p>If you would like to learn more about The Pagosa Early Childhood Center, 
you can call 264-2484 or 264-2512.</p> 
<p>To give you a heads-up for enrollment, you can start gathering your child's 
birth certificate or baptismal record, locate their record of immunizations, 
social security numbers, TANF and Medicaid card (if applicable), proof of 
family income for the past 12 months or the previous income tax year, and names 
and phone number of emergency contact people.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>The Buzz about bears and King's bees</b></p> 
<p>When I told people I was going out to see Charlie King's beehives and learn 
about bees, the burning question on everybody's lips was - &quot;What about 
bears? Don't bears get into the hives?&quot;</p> 
<p>So, of course, that's the first thing I asked Charlie.</p> 
<p>Charlie is an amateur beekeeper. His grandfather was a professional 
beekeeper, back in Pennsylvania. His granddaughter is keeping bees.</p> 
<p>Apparently the beekeeping gene skips a generation.</p> 
<p>Charlie says he does it for fun. &quot;When it quits being fun, then I'll 
quit keeping bees.&quot;</p> 
<p>My own question, when I first learned that Charlie was a beekeeper, was, 
&quot;Do you leave the bees enough honey to make it through the winter, or do 
you let them starve to death and buy more bees in the spring?&quot; Some 
beekeepers do that, although it seems a cruel practice.</p> 
<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;I leave them enough honey. The important 
thing though,&quot; he said, &quot;is that they get enough air.&quot;</p> 
<p>The first winter he kept bees here in Pagosa, the hives were covered, 
heaped high, with snow. Charlie thought, &quot;Well, that's the end of the 
bees.&quot; Came spring, he went out to brush the snow off the hives and check 
out the losses. And heard a faint buzz, buzz, buzz, coming from inside the 
boxes.</p> 
<p>The bees had weathered the winter just fine.</p> 
<p>How do they do it? They gather in a ball, and the ones on the inside are 
warm. They keep changing position to let the bees on the outside come in out of 
the cold and warm up. This is why they need honey over the winter. It takes a 
lot of calories to keep those little bee bodies shimmying and warming each 
other up.</p> 
<p>Temperature control is just as important in the summer. Bees spend a lot 
time fanning air through the hives. They take water into the hive and leave 
little drops all around. The evaporating water helps maintain the hive 
temperature at a steady 96 degrees.</p> 
<p>That's why the hives you see, maybe driving to Durango, are usually painted 
white. The light color reflects sunlight, so the boxes don't heat up too much.
</p> 
<p>Beehives are composed of boxes stacked on top of each other. The bottom two 
are usually where the bees live and raise their young. The ones above those, 
called &quot;supers,&quot; are where the honey is stored. The beekeeper hangs 
empty forms inside the supers, forms that have the suggestion of a honeycomb 
structure. The bees do the rest, making honeycomb cells out of wax and filling 
them with honey.</p> 
<p>All the opening slots between the boxes and between the racks of honey are 
a standard width, about 5/16 of an inch, called &quot;bee space.&quot; Bee 
space was discovered by a fellow named Langstroth, a 19th century 
Congregational minister.</p> 
<p>If the openings are wider or narrower than bee space, the bees will fill 
them with a kind of resin they make, called &quot;propalis.&quot; They also 
cement the boxes together with propalis. The beekeeper has to pry the supers 
off with a flat metal tool.</p> 
<p>Beekeeping is not high-tech. A beekeeper carries his prying tool and his 
smoke pot, and that's about all, when he goes to visit the beehives.</p> 
<p>&quot;But what about those bears?&quot; I asked.</p> 
<p>And the answer? Of course the bears get at the hives! What did you expect? 
Charlie showed me pictures of earlier years, when the bears had gotten into his 
beehives. There had been four hives in a row, and the bear had torn one of them 
apart. Bee cement, the propalis, was no match for a hungry bear.</p> 
<p>&quot;I had to move the undamaged hives the next day,&quot; Charlie said. 
&quot;Before the bear came back.&quot;</p> 
<p>After he had given me the standard show and tell that he gives visiting 4-H 
kids and other groups, Charlie asked, &quot;Do you want to see the bees?&quot;
</p> 
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; I said. &quot;That's why I'm here.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; he said. &quot;Put these on.&quot; And he handed me a 
white heavy canvas jacket with a zip-on hood. The front of the hood, which 
stood well out from my face, was mesh. There were leather and canvas gloves, 
too, with long cuffs.</p> 
<p>I was all covered up, like a character in a disaster movie. Charlie, on the 
other hand, wore a short-sleeved shirt. No gloves, no hat with the little 
screen. No cover-up at all. Briefly, the thought flashed through my mind that 
maybe this bee thing was all a giant hoax. But then he set a little cloth on 
fire in the smoker, and off we went to the bee yard.</p> 
<p>The bee hives are inside a fence. A sturdy bear-resistant fence, with heavy 
wood poles and bars at the corners and lots of wire. An electrified 
bear-resistant fence, enclosing a square space about 10 feet on a side, 
containing four beehives. The bears come around, leave a little sign, and maybe 
get their noses zapped, but they don't get inside the fence.</p> 
<p>Charlie turned off the juice, unhooked the electric wires, and we went in. 
The bees buzzed around us, but a few whiffs of the smoker calmed them right 
down.</p> 
<p>With the bees groggy and slow, Charlie pried off the top super from one of 
the hives and took out a frame of honey. Back at his house, he gave me a round 
section of honeycomb. He wrote out a label for it, &quot;Produced by Charlie 
King's bees on the flanks of Pagosa Peak, Colorado.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;All honey used to come in the comb like this,&quot; he said. 
&quot;You just scoop out a bit and chew it.&quot;</p> 
<p>I did. The sweet honey filled my mouth and flowed down my throat. I chewed 
the wax. It tasted, well, waxy.</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Editorials</b> 
<p><b>All's well...isn't it?</b></p> 
<p>Our county commissioners are championing a sales tax initiative in </p> 
<p>November almost certain to cause some conflict with the Town of </p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs. There are other options but the commissioners seem 
unwilling to exercise them.</p> 
<p>Hopefully, the situation will turn out for the best, for the greatest 
number of people. But, the more adversarial the situation becomes, the less 
chance for success.</p> 
<p>To prevent outright hostility, the commissioners must be sure of several 
things and act accordingly.</p> 
<p>Certainly, the commissioners understand the town has a law on the books, 
approved by voters more than a year ago, that goes into effect if the current 2 
percent sales tax, split 50/50 over 7 years between town and county, expires or 
is altered in any way. This law, allowing the town to take up to 3 percent 
sales tax in town along with its perpetual 1 percent outside town limits, was 
passed following a failed attempt by several non-town residents to put an 
initiative on a ballot calling for the town's share of countywide sales tax to 
be reduced. In taking the issue to voters in 1999, trustees were clear then 
about attempts to dictate town business by anyone living outside town. The 
commissioners must realize the town is not going to back down now, and allow 
voters outside town boundaries to arbitrarily dictate affairs within its 
statutory boundaries.</p> 
<p>Certainly, the commissioners know, too, the town is a statutory entity of 
no less legal status than the county - that there is no political hierarchy in 
place, with county government at the top of the pyramid.</p> 
<p>Surely they realize that at least 70-percent of sales tax, and probably 
more, is collected within the boundaries of the Town of Pagosa Springs and that 
town trustees have an obligation to work in the fiscal best interests of their 
constituents to protect as much of that revenue as possible. They realize that, 
legally, it doesn't matter whether sales tax is paid by in-town residents, 
county residents, or tourists.</p> 
<p>Surely the commissioners realize, if they proceed with their apparent plan, 
there will be opposition to the measure. There will be opponents who urge 
defeat of the measure and a return to the polls in November, 2002, with a 
remodeled issue that reflects increased communication and cooperation between 
town and county - entities that, for the last decade, have enjoyed an unusually 
positive relationship. There has been scant communication between town and 
county thus far, and there are people in the community who would feel more 
comfortable if a ballot issue was supported openly and fully by both entities.
</p> 
<p>They know this. Of course they do.</p> 
<p>The plan on the commissioners' table relies on the use of the word 
&quot;extension.&quot; If passed, the issue will &quot;extend&quot; the current 
2-percent tax - not allowing the current tax to expire. Yet, one commissioner, 
as late as Tuesday, was pondering the prospect of asking the 
&quot;extension&quot; to be &quot;in perpetuity.&quot; Another allowed as how 
he is on the fence regarding the &quot;in perpetuity&quot; proposal.</p> 
<p>Surely, the commissioners understand what the words &quot;altered in any 
way&quot; mean.</p> 
<p>They know, when combined, the phrases &quot;in perpetuity&quot; and 
&quot;altered in any way&quot; buy a token on a bus heading straight to court.
</p> 
<p>They have thought this thing out in detail, haven't they? They've crafted a 
plan suitable to one and all, one that is going to succeed because of mutual 
support. They've represented the situation accurately to numerous legal 
authorities through their county attorney, and received positive responses.</p> 
<p>Haven't they?</p> 
<p>They would never take a poorly conceived gamble - one that, if it 
backfires, could destroy relations with the town and face residents of the 
county with the specter of reduced sales tax revenues.</p> 
<p>Would they?</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>By David C. Mitchell</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>It's a great day for an anniversary</b></p> 
<p>Dear Folks,</p> 
<p>Whaddya think?</p> 
<p>I don't know. Whadda ya think?</p> 
<p>Well right off I think someone is going to question the misspelling of 
&quot;What do you think?&quot;</p> 
<p>At least some readers will.</p> 
<p>Others won't think a thing about it.</p> 
<p>For about the past three years Mr. Crouse and I periodically talked about 
what would follow the final Weld Spatters.</p> 
<p>We knew it wasn't a &quot;when or if&quot; proposition. It was only a 
matter of when.</p> 
<p>There would be no Weld Spatters II or an attempt to imitate Mr. Crouse's 
approach or style.</p> 
<p>Some younger native old timers had considered taking up their pens as 
&quot;The Next Generation,&quot; and sharing their memories of Pagosa Springs 
past.</p> 
<p>They could have provided a revised version of many of the same episodes Mr. 
Crouse shared with his readers. They would have had their own hunting and 
fishing stories. Being from a later era, they would have experienced a somewhat 
different school and social life. They probably would have recalled some 
escapades about the blacksmith and welding shop that Mr. Crouse had forgotten 
or failed to mention.</p> 
<p>Whereas Mr. Crouse eased into Weld Spatters with an on-again-off-again 
approach of periodically submitting a column, his potential followers knew a 
weekly column would be expected.</p> 
<p>Whereas it's easy to write a column; it's work to write a weekly column.</p>
<p>One of the first things I learned at the SUN is that there are no byes, no 
open spots on the schedule, no vacations . . . the season lasts 52 weeks and 
you've got to start fresh every week.</p> 
<p>I can't blame the next generation for not wanting to commit to producing a 
weekly column.</p> 
<p>So I asked Karl what he thought about &quot;Whaddya Think?&quot;</p> 
<p>After all, an endless number of legitimate issues, reasonable concerns and 
inane ideas surface in Pagosa Springs. There could be something new every week.
</p> 
<p>And in Pagosa Springs, you don't have to ask. Most folks give you their 
opinion whether you ask for it or not.</p> 
<p>So it seemed like a good idea to ask folks what they thought about a 
specific issue . . . limiting the answer to a brief response.</p> 
<p>Not knowing he was the one I planned to dump the assignment on, Karl said 
he thought it could be interesting.</p> 
<p>Even after I said he would have to take mug shots along with asking the 
questions, Karl was ready to hit the sidewalks.</p> 
<p>So don't be surprised if in the future someone comes up to you and says, 
&quot;Hey, Whaddya think about. . .?</p> 
<p>And no, you don't have to buy a copy of your photo or sign up for a 
subscription.</p> 
<p>It's just a chance to let folks know what you think about what's happening 
in Pagosa springs.</p> 
<p>Know you are loved and please keep us in your prayers.</p>

<p>Monday evening about eight o'clock fire was reported, it was in the Santa 
Fe Cafe. The damage was very light as the flame was very soon extinguished. 
This would be a very dangerous place for fire to start since it is the only 
solid built portion of town.</p>

<p>An offender appeared before Justice Herbert Loucks last Saturday evening to 
answer to the charge of leaving a camp fire burning on the forest reserve. His 
defense was that he had no such intent and had considered the fire out when he 
left. He was fined the sum of $25 and costs, but the fine was remitted. </p> 
<p>The Community Health Conference, held in Pagosa Springs Monday under the 
auspices of the local Parent-Teacher Association and the Women's Civic Club, 
was successful in every way. A total of 62 children were examined at the 
clinic, 36% of which were found to be more than 7% underweight for their 
heights. This is close to the average for the state. The doctor advised tonsil 
and adenoid operations in 23 cases, or 37% of the children examined.</p>

<p>The town dump grounds on the Trujillo road has been cleaned up and a road 
built to the rear of the area. Town authorities are making signs and have 
served notice that anyone dumping in other than authorized places will be 
subject to arrest and a heavy fine.</p> 
<p>The Woman's Civic Club was entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Clee Woods at their 
Double Quill Ranch on the San Juan River on Aug. 9. Following the business 
meeting Mr. Woods entertained the Club with an intensely interesting talk on 
the making of a movie. His emphasis was placed on the movie, &quot;The Battle 
of Apache Pass,&quot; which was recently filmed at Moab, Utah. Mr. Woods acted 
as technical advisor on the Indian customs, costumes, and dances used in this 
movie. He also worked with the cavalry used in this picture. </p>

<p>The first freeze of the season was reported the morning of August 8. The 
weather station thermometer registered exactly 32 degrees, but this was enough 
to nip flowers and gardens. This is one of the earliest freezes in recent 
years. Since that time the weather has been pleasant with almost daily evening 
showers.</p>
