<p> <b>Australia</b> [1] is the only country that has a whole continent to 
itself. World famous for its natural wonders and wide open spaces, its beaches, 
deserts, &quot;the bush&quot;, and &quot;theOutback&quot;, Australia is 
actually one of the world's most highly urbanised countries. It is also well 
known for the cosmopolitan attractions of its large cities such asSydney, 
Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. </p> 
<h2>[edit] Understand</h2> 
<h3>[edit]  Geography </h3> 
<p>Australia is the smallest continent but sixth-largest country by land area. 
It is comparable in size to the 48 contiguousUnited States. Australia is 
bordered to the west by the Indian Ocean, and to the east by the South Pacific 
Ocean. The Tasman Sea lies to the southeast, separating it fromNew Zealand, 
while the Coral Sea lies to the northeast.Papua New Guinea, East Timor and 
Indonesia are Australia's northern neighbours, separated from Australia by the 
Arafura Sea and the Timor Sea.</p> 
<p>Australia is highly urbanised with most of the population heavily 
concentrated along the eastern and south-eastern coasts. Most of the inland 
areas of the country are semi-arid. The most-populous states areVictoria and 
New South Wales, but by far the largest in land area is Western Australia. </p> 
<p>Australia has an area of 7,682,300 square kilometres (2,966,152 sq mi) and 
the distances between cities and towns is easy to underestimate.</p> 
<p>Australia has large areas that have been deforested for agricultural 
purposes, but many native forest areas survive in extensive national parks and 
other undeveloped areas. Long-term Australian concerns include salinity, 
pollution, loss of biodiversity, and management and conservation of coastal 
areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Climate </h3> 
<p>As a large continent a wide variation of climates are found across 
Australia. Most of the country receives more than 3,000 hours of sunshine a 
year. Generally, the north is hot and tropical, while the south tends to 
sub-tropical and temperate. Most rainfall is around the coast, and much of the 
centre is<b>arid</b> and <b>semi-arid</b>. The daytime maximum temperatures in 
Darwin rarely drop below 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), even in winter, while night 
temperatures in winter usually hover around 15-20&deg;C (59-68&deg;F). 
Temperatures in some southern regions can drop below freezing in winter and the 
Snowy Mountains in the South East experiences metres of winter snow. Parts of
Tasmania have a temperature range very similar to England. </p> 
<p>As Australia is in the southern hemisphere the winter is June-August while 
December-February is summer. The winter is the dry season in the tropics, and 
the summer is the wet. In the southern parts of the country, the seasonal 
temperature variation is greater. The rainfall is more evenly distributed 
throughout the year in the southern parts of the East Coast, while in the rest 
of the south beyond the Great Dividing Range, the summers are dry with the bulk 
of the rainfall occuring in winter.</p> 
<h3>[edit] History</h3> 
<p>The continent of Australia was first settled more than 40,000 years ago 
with successive waves of immigration of Aboriginal peoples from south and 
south-eastAsia. With rising sea levels after the last Ice Age, Australia became 
largely isolated from the rest of the world and the Aboriginal tribes developed 
a variety of cultures, based on a close spiritual relationship with the land 
and nature, and extended kinship. Australian Aboriginal people maintained a 
hunter-gatherer culture for thousands of years in association with a complex 
artistic and cultural life - including a very rich 'story-telling' tradition. 
While the 'modern impression' of Australian Aboriginal people is largely built 
around an image of the 'desert people' who have adapted to some of the harshest 
conditions on the planet (equivalent to the bushmen of the Kalahari), Australia 
provided a 'comfortable living' for the bulk of the Aboriginal people amongst 
the bountiful flora and fauna on the Australian coast - until the arrival of 
Europeans.</p> 
<p>Although a lucrative Chinese market for shells and <i>beche de mere</i> had 
encouraged Indonesian fishermen to visit Northern Australia for centuries it 
was unknown to Europeans until the 1600s, whenDutch traders to Asia began to 
'bump' into the North Western Coast. Early Dutch impressions of this extremely 
harsh, dry country were unfavourable, and Australia remained for them something 
simply a road sign pointing north to the much richer (and lucrative) East 
Indies (modern Indonesia). Deliberate exploration of the Australian coast was 
then largely taken over by the French and the British. Consequently place names 
of bays, headlands and rivers around the coastline reflect a range of Dutch, 
French, British, and Aboriginal languages.</p> 
<p>In 1770, the expedition of the Endeavour under the command of Captain James 
Cook navigated and charted the east coast of Australia, making first landfall at
Botany Bay on 29 April 1770. Cook continued northwards, and before leaving put 
ashore on Possession Island in the Torres Strait off Cape York on 22 Aug 1770. 
Here he formally claimed the eastern coastline he had discovered for the 
British Crown, naming it New South Wales. Given that Cook's discoveries would 
lead to the first European settlement of Australia, he is often popularly 
conceived as its European discoverer, although he had been preceded by more 
than 160 years.</p> 
<p>Following the exploration period, the first wave of British settlers came 
to Australia in 1788, starting a process of colonisation that almost entirely 
displaced the Aboriginal people who inhabited the land. This reduced indigenous 
populations drastically and marginalised them to the fringes of society.</p> 
<p>While Australia began its modern history as a British penal colony, the 
vast majority of people who came to Australia after 1788 were free settlers, 
mainly from Britain andIreland, but also from other European countries. Convict 
settlements were along the east coast,Adelaide (settled in 1836) and Perth 
being settled by free settlers. Many Asian and Eastern European people also 
came to Australia in the 1850s, during the Gold Rush that started Australia's 
first resource boom. Although such diverse immigration diminished greatly 
during the xenophobic years of the White Australia policy, Australia welcomed a 
successive series of immigration from Europe, the Mediterranean and later Asia 
to formulate a highly diverse and multicultural society by the late 20th 
century.</p> 
<p>The system of separate colonies federated to form the self-governing 
British dominion of Australia in 1901, each colony now becoming a state of 
Australia, with New Zealand opting out of the federation. The new country was 
able to take advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop its 
agricultural and manufacturing industries and made a large contribution 
(considering its small size of population) to the Allied war effort in World 
Wars I and II. Australian troops also made a valuable, if sometimes 
controversial, contribution to the wars in Korea,Vietnam and Iraq. Australian 
Diggers retain a reputation as some of the hardest fighting troops along with a 
great social spirit. Australia and Britain passed the Australia Act in 1986, 
ending any remnant power the British parliament may have had to pass laws for 
Australia.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Economy</h3> 
<p>Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per 
capita GDP on par with the four dominant West European economies.</p> 
<p>The service industries, including tourism, education, and financial 
services, account for the majority of the Australian Gross Domestic Product 
&ndash; about 69%. Within the service sector, tourism is one of the most 
important industries in Australia, as it provides employment, contributes $73 
billion to the economy each year and accounts for at least 11% of total exports.
</p> 
<p>Primary industry - mining and agriculture - accounts for most of 
Australia's exports. Iron Ore and Coal are by far the largest exports, with 
wheat, beef and wool declining in importance.</p> 
<p>Australia has a comprehensive social security system, and a minimum wage 
higher than the United States or the United Kingdom. Tradesmen are extremely 
well-paid in Australia, often more so than professionals.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Politics </h3> 
<p>Australia has a federal system of government, with eight state and 
territory governments and a national government. Each of these governments has 
an elected parliament, with the leader of each government being the leader of 
the largest party represented in the lower house. The national parliament is 
based on the British Westminster system, with some elements having similar 
characteristics to the American congressional system. At the federal level it 
consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives. Each Member of the House 
of Representatives represents an electoral division. The political party (or 
coalition of parties) which has the most Members in the House of 
Representatives becomes the governing party and forms the national government. 
Ministers are drawn from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The 
Prime Minister Julia Gillard, is the current leader of the national government 
and the Australian Labor Party holds a majority in the House of Representatives 
(relying on the support of independents to retain power).</p> 
<p>The Queen remains the notional head of state, and her representative in 
Australia - the Governor-General - has a ceremonial and conventionally 
politically powerless role. A referendum to change Australia's status to a 
republic was defeated in 1999, but republicanism in Australia remains a 
regularly debated topic.</p> 
<p>The two major political parties in Australia are the Australian Labor Party 
(ALP) and the Liberal Party, which operates in coalition with the National 
Party. Emerging in power is the social democratic Greens Party, which maintains 
an environmentalist policy platform and is effectively a partner of the ALP. It 
should be noted that the Liberal Party is (traditionally) a centre-right, 
conservative party - the term liberal refers to maintaining a free market 
economy.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Culture</h3> 
<p>Australia also has a multicultural population practising almost every 
religion and lifestyle. Over one-quarter of Australians were born outside 
Australia, and another quarter have at least one foreign-born parent. The most 
multicultural cities are Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney. All three cities are 
renowned for the variety and quality of global foods available in their many 
restaurants, and Melbourne especially promotes itself as a centre for the arts, 
while Brisbane promotes itself through various, multicultural urban villages. 
Adelaide is known for being a centre for festivals as well as German cultural 
influences, while Perth is known for its food and wine culture, pearls, gems 
and precious metals as well as the international fringe arts festival. Smaller 
rural settlements generally still reflect a majority Anglo-Celtic culture often 
with a small Aboriginal population, however virtually every large Australian 
city and town reflects the immigration from Europe, Asia, the Middle East and 
the Pacific that occurred after World War II and continued into the 1970s, in 
the half century after the war when Australia's population boomed from roughly 
7 million to just over 20 million people.</p> 
<p>There are approximately half a million Australians who identify as being of 
Aboriginal descent. Many fewer maintain elements of traditional Aboriginal 
culture.</p> 
<p>Contrary to popular mythology, descendants from convicts are in a very 
small minority, and even during the years of transportation free settlers 
outnumbered convict migrants by at least five to one.</p> 
<p>Australian English was once known for its colour and colloquialisms but has 
lost a great deal of this to outside influence, although people in rural areas 
still tend to speak in a broader accent, using many of the slang words that 
have become outmoded in metropolitan areas. There is very little provincialism 
in Australia, although accents tend to be broader and slower outside of the 
large cities. There are overall small pronunciation differences in the cities 
but are becoming more common. For example the word &quot;you&quot;, which is 
often rolled off the tongue sharper on the south east coast, almost as 
&quot;ewe&quot; as opposed to the west coast and other regions. It is also a 
modern variation to find Afrikaan accents on the west coast modifying the local 
accents slightly due to the high immigration there. Like in much of the English 
speaking world, a more educated, white-collar and/or conservative Australian 
accent tends towards being more softer or general in tones, rather than the 
sharp tones, however it is a subtle difference overall and native speakers can 
typically recognise regional variations.</p> 
<p>Australians can be socially conservative compared to some European cultures 
and often have a balanced attitude defining their European origin with their 
growing Asian influence. They tend to be relaxed in their religious observance. 
While the Australian sense of egalitarianism has moderated in terms, modes of 
address still tend to be casual and familiar compared to some other cultures. 
Most Australians will tend to address you by your first name and will expect 
that you do the same to them.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Holidays</h4> 
<p>The national holidays in Australia are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>1 January</b>: New Years' Day </li> 
<li> <b>26 January</b>: Australia Day, marking the anniversary of the First 
Fleet's landing in Sydney Cove in 1788.</li> 
<li> <b>Easter weekend</b> (&quot;Good Friday&quot;, &quot;Easter 
Saturday&quot;, &quot;Easter Sunday&quot; and &quot;Easter Monday&quot;): a 
four day long weekend in March or April set according to the Western Christian 
dates.</li> 
<li> <b>25 April</b>: ANZAC Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps), 
honouring military veterans</li> 
<li> <b>Second Monday in June</b>: Queen's birthday holiday (celebrated in 
Western Australia in September) (WA observes<b>Foundation Day</b> a week 
earlier)</li> 
<li> <b>25 December</b>: Christmas Day </li> 
<li> <b>26 December</b>: Boxing Day </li> </ul> 
<p>Many states observe <b>Labour Day</b>, but on different days. Most states 
have one or two additional state-wide holidays, with Victoria (state andSouth 
Australia having a day off for a horse race (The Melbourne Cup and The Adelaide 
Cup). Western Australia has Foundation day typically the first Monday in June 
(recognising the founding of the state since 1829) but also celebrates the 
Queens Birthday at a different date to the rest of the country, either at the 
end of September or early October, due to the usual June date is such close 
proximity to Foundation day.</p> 
<p>When a public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday 
(and Tuesday if necessary) are usually declared holidays in lieu, although both 
the celebrations and the retail closures will occur on the day itself. Most 
tourist attractions are closed Christmas Day and Good Friday. Supermarkets and 
other stores may open for limited hours on some public holidays and on holidays 
in lieu, but are almost always closed on Christmas Day (25 Dec), Good Friday, 
Easter Sunday and ANZAC Day morning.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Peak holiday times </h3> 
<p>Most attractions in Australia remain open year-round, some operating at a 
reduced frequency or shorter hours during the off-peak season.</p> 
<p>Salaried Australians have four weeks of annual leave and school children in 
the major population centres have January as a long break. Domestic tourism is 
strongest during January and the Easter school holidays.</p> 
<p>Summer tends to be the peak travel season through much of the south, with 
the winter (dry) season the peak travel season in the tropics.</p> 
<p>Australian teenagers celebrate the end of school for 3 weeks at the end of 
October and early November. The volume of teen revellers can completely change 
the nature of some of the cities and towns they choose to visit.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Time</h3> 
<p>Australia can have up to five different time zones during the daylight 
savings period, and three at other times.</p> 
<p>In the east, Tasmania, New South Wales and Victoria always have the same 
time.Queensland doesn't observe daylight saving, so it is an hour behind the 
other eastern states during that period.</p> 
<p>In the centre, South Australia and the Northern Territory are half an hour 
behind during the winter, but the Northern Territory doesn't observe daylight 
saving while South Australia does. During daylight saving South Australia 
remains half an hour behind New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, but moves 
half an hour ahead of Queensland. The Northern Territory remains half an hour 
behind Queensland, but moves an hour and half behind New South Wales, Victoria 
and Tasmania.</p> 
<p>In the west, Western Australia is two hours behind the eastern states in 
winter, and also doesn't observe daylight saving. It moves three hours behind 
the eastern states that observe daylight saving (remaining two hours behind 
Queensland).</p> 
<p>There are no official abbreviations or names for Australian time zones, and 
you may see a few variations used. EST, CST, WST along with EDT, CDT are 
sometimes used. Sometimes AEST, etc, with the 'A' prefix distinguishing them 
from the North American time zones with the same names. In conversation, the 
abbreviations aren't used. People tend to say<i>Sydney time</i>, <i>Brisbane 
time</i>, or <i>Perth time</i>. Expect blank stares from most if you start 
talking about<i>Central Summer Time</i>. </p> 
<p>In those states which observe daylight saving, it commences on the first 
Sunday in October and ends on the first Sunday in April.</p>  State/Territory

<h2>[edit] Regions</h2> <br>
Australia regions <b>New South Wales and 
Australian Capital Territory (Canberra) <i>(NSW) &amp; (ACT)</i></b> <br>
New 
South Wales is Australia's most populous state. The Harbour City of Sydney is 
Australia's largest city. The coast of New South Wales is lined with beachside 
communities, each one offering experiences for the traveller. A little inland 
are the mountain ranges of theBlue Mountains, and the purpose built capital 
city ofCanberra, excised from New South Wales. Further inland still expect 
sweeping plains, turning from agriculture to desert the further inland you 
venture. <br>
<br>
<b>Northern Territory <i>(NT)</i></b> <br>
From the red 
deserts surroundingUluru and Alice Springs up to the tropics of Darwin and 
Kakadu National Park, the Northern Territory is stunningly beautiful, and 
easier to access than you might think. <br>
<br>
<b>Queensland <i>(QLD)</i></b> 
<br>Famous for its sunny warm weather, Queensland offers coastal exploration 
from the vibe of theGold Coast to the tropics of the Great Barrier Reef to the 
bustling city of Brisbane. It is also home to tropical rainforests of the
Daintree National Park, and the island resorts of the Whitsundays. Inland lies 
the ranges of the hinterland, and further on the vast expanses and beauty of 
outback Australia. <br>
<br>
<b>South Australia <i>(SA)</i></b> <br>
Renowned 
for the fine wines of theBarossa Valley, the beauty of the Flinders Ranges and 
the outback, and the beaches and events and culture of the<i>City of Churches
</i>, Adelaide. <br>
<br>
<b>Tasmania <i>(TAS)</i></b> <br>
Separated from the 
mainland by Bass Strait, Tasmania has rugged beauty of Cradle Mountain and the 
west, the beaches of the east, and the complete wilderness of the south.Hobart 
was the site of the second European settlement in Australia, and many historic 
sites are well preserved. The island has well developed facilities for 
travellers. <br>
<br>
<b>Victoria <i>(VIC)</i></b> <br>
Small, vibrant and with 
something for everyone, Victoria has dramatic surf beaches along the southwest 
and central coast, green rolling farmland and photogenic national parks. The 
diversity of rural Victoria is very easy to access due in part to its size and 
well maintained roads. Australia and Victoria's sporting, shopping, fashion and 
food capital is Melbourne. <br>
<br>
<b>Western Australia <i>(WA)</i></b> <br>

A vast state. The south-west contains the state capital and major city of Perth 
closely surrounded by the wildflower, wine growing and scenic destinations of
Margaret River and Albany. In the far north are the tropics and the beachside 
destination ofBroome. Small townships, roadhouses, mining communities and 
national parks scattered around the long distances between. <br>

<h2>[edit] Get in</h2> 
<p>All visitors - apart from citizens of New Zealand - require a visa in 
advance of travel.</p> 
<p>If you are visiting for a holiday of less than three months, there are 
three types of visas you may apply for, depending on your nationality.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) subclass 976</b>, is available online
[2] to nationals of Brunei, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, 
South Korea (ROK) and United States. A service fee of $20 applies. This fee can 
be waived if you obtain your ETA through a travel agent.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>eVisitor (subclass 651)</b> for citizens of the EU, Iceland, Norway 
and Switzerland and a few European microstates. These visas are free, but 
otherwise effectively identical to the ETA. You must apply online.[3] </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Tourist Visa (subclass 676)</b>. Passport holders of 53 countries, 
including all the ETA and eVisitor eligible countries andBahrain, Chile, Croatia
,Kuwait, Maldives, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE can make applications 
online. Other nationalities must apply using the paper form, and may need to 
visit an embassy or visa processing centre. The fee is $110.</li> </ul> 
<p>In most cases, Electronic Travel Authorities and eVisitors are approved 
instantly and the visa will issued and available for use immediately. If 
further enquiries are needed you may be asked to return to the application 
system later to see if you've been approved. In the worst case your application 
can be diverted for manual checks that can take weeks. Best to apply early.</p> 
<p>If you are visiting Australia for employment, study or for medical 
treatment you will need to obtain the appropriate visa. If you are staying 
longer than 3 months continuously you are ineligible for an ETA or eVisitor, 
and should apply for a Tourist Visa (subclass 676).</p> 
<p>For all tourist visa classes you must be able to demonstrate your ability 
to support yourself financially for the time you intend to spend in Australia. 
If you have a criminal conviction, obtain advice from the Australian Embassy or 
visa processing centre.</p> 
<p>All fees are payable in Australian Dollars, converted to your local 
currency at the current rate of exchange.</p> 
<p>If you are transiting through Australia, remain airside for a maximum of 8 
hours, have a confirmed onward booking, have the correct entry documentation 
for the onward destination and are a citizen of New Zealand, the<b>European 
Union</b>, Andorra, Argentina, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, the Federated States of 
Micronesia, Fiji, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Kiribati, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Monaco, Nauru, Norway, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, South 
Africa, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Samoa, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia
,Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Korea (ROK), Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, 
Tonga, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom (regardless of nationality 
status), theUnited States, the Vanuatu or Vatican City, you do <b>not</b> need 
to apply for any advance visa. All other passengers who transit through 
Australia<b>must</b> apply for a free-of-charge Transit Visa (subclass 771) 
prior to travel.</p> 
<p>New Zealand citizens may travel to and work in Australia for any length of 
time without a pre-arranged visa. Non-citizen permanent residents of New 
Zealand are<i>not</i> eligible for visa-free entry. New Zealand citizens may 
still be rejected entry on the basis of criminal convictions, and should seek 
advice before travel.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Customs and quarantine</h3> 
<p>Australia has <b>strict quarantine requirements</b> regarding importing <b>
animal and vegetable</b> derived products (any food, wooden products, seeds, 
etc).[4]. <b>You must declare all such material</b> and baggage is frequently 
scanned and may be examined by dogs. You may be fined $220 on-the-spot if you 
fail to declare, or even prosecuted in very serious cases. Processed and sealed 
commercially prepared foods (chocolates, cookies, etc) are often permitted. 
They will be examined and returned to you, but still must be declared. Some 
prohibited items can be treated by quarantine at your expense and picked up at 
a later time.</p> 
<p>Some shells, coral and items made from a protected species are also 
prohibited to discourage the trade in items that may originate from a 
threatened ecosystem or species.</p> 
<p>While there are no restrictions on the amount of money that can be brought 
in or out, Australian customs also requires you to declare if you are bringing 
A$10,000 or more in or out of the country and you will be asked to complete 
some paperwork.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By plane</h3> 
<p>Australia is a long way from anywhere else in the world, so for most 
visitors, the only practical way of getting into Australia is by air.</p> 
<p>Approximately half of all international travellers arrive first in 
Australia in Sydney, the largest city, (IATA: <b>SYD</b>; ICAO: <b>YSSY</b>). 
After Sydney, significant numbers of travellers also arrive in Australia in 
Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. There are also direct international services 
into Adelaide, Cairns, Darwin, the Gold Coast and Christmas Island though these 
are largely restricted to flights from New Zealand, Oceania, or Southeast Asia.
</p> 
<p>To Sydney it is a 3 hour flight from New Zealand, a 7-11 hour flight from 
countries in Asia, a 14 hour flight from the west of the United States and 
Canada, a 14 hour flight fromJohannesburg, a 13-16 hour flight from South 
America, and up to a 24+ hour flight from western Europe. On account of long 
journey times from some destinations, some travellers from Europe opt to have a 
stop-over, commonly in Singapore, Hong Kong,Dubai, Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur. </p>
<p>If you have to change to a domestic flight in a gateway city, Sydney, 
Brisbane and Perth all have distinct domestic terminals, requiring some time 
and complexity to transit, check the guides. Melbourne, Adelaide, Darwin, 
Cairns and the Gold Coast have all gates in the one terminal building or within 
easy walking distance of each other.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Discount airlines </h4> 
<p>There are some routes into Australia that are operated by discount 
airlines. These can often be combined with other fares to make getting to 
Australia cheaper. Select your point of entry and exit to give you a cheaper 
round-trip, and possibly some interesting stopover opportunities on the way.</p>
<ul> 
<li> <b>Air Asia X</b>, flies into the Gold Coast, Melbourne] and Perth from 
Kuala Lumpur, at often deeply discounted fares. You can save money from Europe 
if having a stopover inMalaysia. Sometimes this is possible also stopping in 
Bangkok.</li> 
<li> <b>Air Asia Indonesia</b> flies into Darwin and Perth from Denpasar, 
Indonesia </li> 
<li> <b>Tiger</b> [5] flies from Singapore to Perth. </li> 
<li> <b>Jetstar Airways</b> [6] flies to Hawaii and several Asian 
destinations, including Denpasar,Osaka, Phuket, Ho Chi Minh, and also operates 
a substantial Asian regional hub in Singapore.</li> 
<li> <b>V Australia</b> [7] flies between Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, and Los 
Angeles, and competes strongly with Qantas [8] [9] on these routes. </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit]  By boat </h3> 
<p>November to February is the cruising season, and there are usually about 10 
ships that arrive in Australia from other countries during this time. You can 
cruise to Australia, and then fly home.</p> 
<p>Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Royal Caribbean, all offer 
cruises to Australia across the Pacific.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, you may sail to Australia in your own yacht, but beware of 
customs regulations. SeeAustralian Customs for details </p> 
<h3>[edit]  By overland tour</h3> 
<p>There are a couple of expedition companies such as Ozbus or Exploratory 
Overland Expeditions that conduct organized trips fromLondon to Sydney but the 
last leg of the journey involves flying to Darwin fromEast Timor or Singapore 
while the bus is shipped across. These are targeted at backpackers able to take 
months for the trip.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Get around</h2> 
<p>Australia is huge but sparsely populated, and you can sometimes travel many 
hours before finding the next trace of civilisation, especially once you leave 
the south-eastern coastal fringe.</p> 
<p>Almost all modern Australian maps, including street directories, use the 
Geocentric Datum of Australia (GDA) as their grid reference, which is for all 
purposes identical to the WGS84 used by the GPS. You can locate most things on 
an Australian map or street directory if you just have the &quot;GPS 
coordinates&quot;.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Quarantine</h3> 
<p>There are restrictions on carrying fruit and vegetables (including honey) 
between states and even between regions of states that are involved in fruit 
growing. If you are driving long distances or interstate, or flying between 
states, don't stock up on fruits and vegetables.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By car</h3> 
<p>Australia has a generally well-maintained system of roads and highways, and 
cars are a commonly used method of transport. Most of the state capitals are 
linked to each other by good quality highways. Some parts are dual carriageway 
but many sections are one lane each way. Major regional areas have sealed 
(paved) dual-lane roads, but isolated areas may have poorly maintained dirt 
roads or even tracks. Distances and speeds are specified in kilometres and fuel 
is sold by the litre. There are no tolls on roads or bridges outside of the 
urban areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.</p> 
<p>Australia drives on the left. Overseas visitors who are used to driving on 
the right should take care when they first drive, and again when they are 
driving on country roads with little traffic.</p> 
<p>Generally, overseas licenses are valid for driving in Australia for three 
months after arrival. If the licence is not in English an International Driving 
Permit (IDP) is required in addition to your licence. Licensing regulations and 
road rules vary slightly from state to state.</p> 
<p>Australia's low population density and large size makes for long driving 
times between major centres. Some indicative travel times, not including any 
rest periods, are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Melbourne to Sydney: 9-10 hours (900 km / 560 mi) </li> 
<li> Brisbane to Sydney: 12-13 hours (1,000 km / 620 mi) </li> 
<li> Perth to Sydney: 45 hours (4,000 km / 2500 mi) </li> 
<li> Sydney to Canberra: 3.5 hours (300 km / 185 mi) </li> 
<li> Adelaide to Melbourne: 8-10 hours (750 km / 465 mi) </li> 
<li> Brisbane to Melbourne: 19-20 hours (1,700 km / 1056 mi) </li> 
<li> Melbourne to Perth: 40 hours (3,500 km / 2175 mi) </li> 
<li> Perth to Adelaide: 32 hours (2,700 km / 1677 mi) </li> 
<li> Brisbane to Cairns: 22-24 hours (1,700 km / 1,056 mi) </li> </ul> 
<p>It is almost impossible to predict your travel time just by knowing the 
distance. Seek local advice for the best route, and how much time to allow. 
Averaging 100 km/h or more is possible on some relatively minor highways when 
they are straight and there are few towns. On other national highways that 
traverse mountain ranges and travel through small towns, even averaging 60 km/h 
can be a challenge.</p> 
<p>While major highways are well serviced, anyone <b>leaving sealed (paved) 
roads</b> in inland Australia is advised to take advice from local authorities, 
check weather and road conditions, carry sufficient spare fuel, spare parts, 
spare tyres, matches, food and water. Some remote roads might see one car per 
month or less. Cellular coverage is non-existent outside of major highways and 
towns and you should take some precautions in case of emergency. It is a good 
idea to advise a person you know and trust of your route and advise them to 
alert authorities if you do not contact them within a reasonable amount of time 
after your scheduled arrival at your destination. Carrying a Personal Locator 
Beacon (PLB) or satellite phone should be considered when travelling in remote 
areas, especially where you may not be able to make contact for several days. 
Police will not automatically start looking for you if you don't report in. 
Make sure you get one with a GPS built in. These can be borrowed from some 
local police stations, such as those in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. 
If you want to hire one, sort it out before you leave a major city, as you 
won't find hire places in small towns. Expect to pay around $100 to hire for a 
week, or $700 to buy one. Don't expect an immediate rescue even if you trigger 
a PLB. Heat and dehydration at any time of year can kill you. If stranded, stay 
with your vehicle and do what you can to improve your visibility from the air. 
Do not take this advice lightly; even local people die out there when their car 
breaks down and they are not reported missing. If you do have to abandon your 
car (say you break down and then get a lift), call in quickly to the local 
police station, to avoid the embarrassment and cost of a search being started 
for you.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Car rental </h4> 
<p>Major cities around Australia have multiple outlets providing a wide range 
of rental vehicles from major international rental companies. In smaller towns 
car rental can be difficult to find. One way fees often apply from smaller 
regional outlets.</p> 
<p><b>Contractual restrictions</b> </p>
<p>Conditions upon the use of rental vehicles usually exist on travelling into 
or out ofWestern Australia and the Northern Territory or on the car ferries to 
Tasmania,Kangaroo Island and Fraser Island. Rental cars in capital cities 
usually have unlimited mileage. In small towns they usually only include 100 km 
a day before a surcharge is applied. Some companies allow travel on any 
gazetted road, while others forbid travel on a gravel/dirt road unless you hire 
a four wheel drive. Always ensure you thoroughly check the vehicle for any 
damage, including all window glass and the roof panels, and document any found 
in detail with the renter before leaving the depot.</p>
<p>You will need to have a licence written in English or an International 
Driving Permit (IDP) from your home country to drive anywhere in Australia. 
Check the contract conditions carefully if you are under 25 and also check that 
your licence class matches the vehicle you wish to rent before you book it.</p>

<h4>[edit] Budget price car and camper rentals</h4> 
<p>Catering to the vast number of young European and American backpackers 
traversing the country are several low-budget car rental companies which rent 
cars and campers of varying quality. Prices ranging as low as $30 per day. 
Check the<i>extra</i> charges very carefully and make sure that you are not 
paying the same or more for a lesser quality vehicle. The East Coast from 
Sydney to Cairns is especially abundant with happy, hungover youths travelling 
around in these vehicles.</p>

<p>The very cheapest cars you can hire can be manual (stick-shift). Anything 
larger will usually be automatic.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Car purchase </h4> 
<p>There is a substantial second hand market in cars and campers for 
backpackers wishing to do extended road trips around Australia. Take common 
sense precautions if purchasing a car. Free state government services are 
available to ensure it is unencumbered by a finance arrangement and that it has 
not been previously written off as a result of an accident.</p> 
<p><i>See:</i> Driving in Australia </p> 
<h3>[edit] By plane</h3> 
<p>Due to the large distances involved, flying is a well-patronised form of 
travel in Australia. Services along the main business travel corridor 
(Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane) are run almost like a bus service, with flights 
leaving every 15 minutes during the day.</p> 
<p>The only way to get the best airfare is to visit each of the airlines pages 
directly, and compare fares. Never assume that the Qantas fare will be more 
expensive, as their online deals are often the cheapest available on a route. 
The best fares are always available on the most competitive routes. 
Consolidator websites and travel agents almost invariably add a surcharge to 
direct booking. Use them to compare, but always check the airline website 
before booking.</p> 
<p>There are four domestic airlines in Australia that operate jet aircraft 
linking capital cities and major destinations.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Qantas</b> [24], the only nation-wide full service airline, flying to 
major cities and some larger regional towns;</li> 
<li> <b>Virgin Australia</b> [25], a nation-wide airline, flying to major 
cities and a few larger regional towns;</li> 
<li> <b>Jetstar</b> [26], Qantas's discount arm with limited service and 
assigned seating.</li> 
<li> <b>Tiger Airways Australia</b> [27], one of Asia's largest LCC has a hub 
in Melbourne and flies to Sydney, Gold Coast, Brisbane and Perth, prices are 
very competitive. On 2 July 2011 Tiger Airways Australia was suspended from 
flying by Australian civil aviation authorities due to safety concerns. Tiger 
recommenced operations on 12 August 2011 but with a much reduced schedule and a 
smaller operational aircraft fleet.</li> </ul> 
<p>Several airlines service regional destinations. Expect discounts on these 
airlines to be harder to come by, and for standard airfares to be above what 
you would pay for the same distance between major centres.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Qantaslink</b> [28], the regional arm of Qantas, covering the smaller 
cities in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia;
</li> 
<li> <b>Regional Express</b> [29], covering larger towns &amp; cities on the 
eastern seaboard as well as country South Australia;</li> 
<li> <b>Skywest</b> [30], covering regional Western Australia, Bali and Darwin;
</li> 
<li> <b>Airnorth</b> [31], covering the Northern Territory; </li> 
<li> <b>Skytrans Airlines</b> [32], covering regional Queensland. </li> 
<li> <b>Sharp Airlines</b> [33], covering several regional towns in Victoria 
and South Australia.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By train</h3> 
<p>Visitors from countries with well-developed long distance rail systems such 
as Europe and Japan may be surprised by the lack of high-speed, inter-city rail 
services in Australia. A historical lack of cooperation between the states, 
combined with sheer distances and a relatively small population to service, 
have left Australia with a national rail network that is relatively slow and 
used mainly for freight. As a result, travel between major cities will not only 
be faster by air, but often cheaper as well. Train travel between cities is, 
however, more scenic, and tourists are likely to see more of Australia 
travelling by train than they would otherwise see, as well as cutting down on 
their carbon footprint. It is also often a cost effective way of getting to 
regional towns and cities, which don't have the frequent and cheap flights 
found between the capital cities.</p> 
<p>The long-distance rail services that do exist are mainly used to link 
regional townships with the state capital, such asBendigo to Melbourne, or 
Cairns to Brisbane. In Queensland, a high speed train operates from Brisbane to
Rockhampton and Brisbane to Cairns. Queensland also has passenger services to 
inland centres includingLongreach (<i>The Spirit of the Outback</i>), Mount Isa 
(<i>The Inlander</i>), Charleville (<i>The Westlander</i>) and Forsayth (<i>The 
Savannahlander</i>). There are also inter-city train services operated by Great 
Southern Railways on the routes Melbourne-Adelaide (<i>The Overland</i>), 
Sydney-Adelaide-Perth (<i>Indian Pacific</i>), Adelaide-Alice Springs-Darwin (
<i>The Ghan</i>) however as noted above, these are not &quot;high speed&quot; 
services, so if you do not enjoy train travel as part of your holiday in its 
own right then this is probably not for you.</p> 
<p>Tasmania has no passenger rail services. The Northern Territory has the 
rail line linking Darwin to Adelaide through Alice Springs only, and the 
Australian Capital Territory has only a single railway station close to the 
centre of Canberra.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Long distance train operators </h4> 
<ul> 
<li> Great Southern Railways [34]. A private train operator running tourist 
train services, The Ghan, The Indian Pacific and The Overland between Sydney,
Broken Hill, Adelaide, Alice Springs, Darwin, Perth and Melbourne. </li> 
<li> CountryLink [35] - Links Sydney to Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra, and 
regional connections to most New South Wales towns, includingDubbo, Coffs 
Harbour, and Wagga Wagga. </li> 
<li> V/Line Passenger [36] - Train &amp; coach services in Victoria, including 
combined Train and Coach services between Melbourne and Adelaide, Melbourne and 
Canberra.</li> 
<li> Queensland Rail - Traveltrain [37] - Long distance passenger train 
services in Queensland</li> 
<li> The Savannahlander [38] - A Queenstrain service that links Cairns with 
the outback town ofForsayth, using old heritage trains, and providing overnight 
accommodation and tours on the way.</li> 
<li> TransWA [39] - State government run, operating train services to 
Kalgoorlie and Bunbury. Also operates coach services to much of the state, 
especially the South West.</li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit]  Rail passes </h4> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>East Coast Discovery Pass</b>. Get on and off as many times as you 
like on the east coast trains between Melbourne and Cairns. Different prices 
apply depending on which section of the line you want to traverse. One way 
travel only is permitted. Discounts apply on other train journeys, and often 
bus connections to local towns are included. This ticket is available to 
everyone, international visitors and Australian residents.</li> 
<li> <b>Australian Flexi-Pass</b>. Available to non-Australian passport 
holders. Allows unlimited train travel on the Ghan and the Indian Pacific, New 
South Wales Countrylink and Queensland Rail. It will get you to every capital 
city on mainland Australia, as well as the tropical north ofQueensland. If you 
are not travelling toWestern Australia or the Northern Territory there are 
probably cheaper options.</li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit]  Local public transport </h4> 
<p>Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Wollongong and Newcastle have 
train and bus services integrated into the city public transport, with trams 
also running in Melbourne and Adelaide, and ferries in Sydney and Brisbane. The 
remaining capital cities have bus services only. See those city guides articles 
for public transport details.</p> 
<p>Some regional cities and towns have local bus services, but see the 
destination guides for service information, as frequency can be poor and 
weekend and evening services non-existent.</p> 
<p>Larger towns and cities have taxi services. </p> 
<h3>[edit]  By motorail </h3> 
<p>Some trains allow you to carry your car with you on special car carriages 
attached to the back of the train.</p> 
<p>The Ghan and the Indian Pacific allow you to transport cars between Sydney, 
Melbourne, Adelaide, Alice Springs, Perth, and Darwin. You cannot remove your 
car at any of the intermediate stations.</p> 
<p>Queensland Rail have motorail services on the Sunlander and the Spirit of 
the Outback, allow cars from Brisbane to Cairns andLongreach. </p> 
<h3>[edit] By bus</h3> 
<p>Bus travel in Australia is cheap and convenient, although the distances 
involved for interstate connections are daunting. Greyhound has the largest bus 
route network.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Firefly Express, &#9742; 1300 730 740 (+61 3 8318 0318 - international 
callers, enquiries@fireflyexpress.com.au), [40]. Firefly Express has services 
connecting Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Greyhound, &#9742; 1300 473 946 (info@greyhound.com.au), [41]. Greyhound 
travels to over 1100 destinations in Australia daily every day of the year. It 
has a variety of ticketing options allow you to travel at your own pace, 
hopping on and off as many times as your ticket allows. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Murrays, &#9742; 13 22 51 (reservations@murrays.com.au), [42]. Murrays 
has services connecting Canberra with Sydney, theNSW South Coast and snowfields.
 &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By boat</h3> 
<p>Many major Australian cities have ferries as part of their public transport 
system. Some smaller roads in the regional areas still have punts to carry cars 
across rivers and canals. The islands of the Barrier Reef have some scheduled 
services, and there are a few cruises that cross the top of Australia as well.
</p> 
<p>However, large inter city transportation ferry services are not common. </p>
<ul> 
<li> <b>The Spirit of Tasmania</b>,[43]. The only long distance ferry route 
connects Tasmania to the mainland and runs between Melbourne andDevonport. The 
<i>Spirit of Tasmania</i> carries cars and passengers on the route across Bass 
Strait daily.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Sealink</b> connects Kangaroo Island, Australia's second largest 
southern island with regular car ferries.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Sea SA</b> offers a shortcut across the Spencer Gulf between Adelaide 
and theEyre Peninsula, running daily car ferry services. </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By thumb</h3> 
<p>It is legal to hitchhike in some states in Australia, so long as certain 
guidelines are followed. However, it is less commonly done than in neighboring 
New Zealand. In Australia hitchhiking is often frowned upon by locals and 
police, especially in metropolitan areas.</p> 
<p>Hitch hiking is illegal in Victoria and Queensland. It is also illegal to 
stand on the verge or walk along freeways (often called &quot;motorways&quot; 
in New South Wales) in all states (effectively making hitchhiking illegal in 
many practical places, in all states).</p> 
<p>If forced to hitchhike due to an emergency you may find a motorist willing 
to take you to the nearest town to obtain help. It would be rare to find a 
motorist willing take you further afield. (Some major inter-city highways and 
freeways have telephones to request help.)</p> 
<p>It is most common to see a tourist hitching in rural areas. The best time 
to hitchhike is early morning. The best location is near, but not on, the main 
exit from the town you are in.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  By bicycle </h3> 
<p>Cycling the long distances between towns is not particularly common, and 
most long distance highways in Australia have poorly developed facilities for 
cyclists. Nevertheless some intrepid travellers do manage to cover the longer 
distances by bicycle, and have a different experience of Australia. Trips and 
routes need careful planning to ensure the correct supplies are carried. To 
cycle between Sydney and Brisbane you would have to allow 2-3 weeks with around 
80-100km per day.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] See</h2> 
<p>There is much to see in Australia that you can't see easily in its natural 
setting anywhere else:</p> 
<h3>[edit] Wildlife</h3> <br>
Koala 
<p>Australian flora and fauna is unique to the island continent, the result of 
having been isolated from the rest of the world for millions of years. Amongst 
Australian animals are a large group of marsupials (mammals with a pouch) and 
monotremes (mammals that lay eggs). Just some of the animal icons of Australia 
are the kangaroo (national symbol) and the koala. A visit to Australia would 
not be complete without taking the chance to see some of these animals in their 
natural environment.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Wildlife parks and zoos </h4> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Wildlife parks and zoos</b> are in every capital city, but also check 
out the animal parks if you are passing through smaller towns, likeMildura or 
Mogo, or staying on Hamilton Island. See the Warrawong Fauna Sanctuary if you 
are in South Australia, or visit the koalas with best view in the world, at 
Taronga Zoo in Sydney.</li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit]  In the wild </h4> <br>
Kangaroos in Australia 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Kangaroos</b> and <b>wallabies</b> reside in national parks all around 
the country. You won't see any kangaroos hopping down the street inCentral 
Sydney, but they are common on the outskirts of most urban areas. </li> 
<li> <b>Wombats</b> and <b>echidna</b> are also common, but harder to find due 
to their camouflage and tunnelling. See lots of echidnas on Kangaroo Island.
</li> 
<li> <b>Koalas</b> are present in forests around Australia, but are very 
notoriously hard to spot, and walking around looking upwards into the boughs of 
trees will usually send you sprawling over a tree root. Best seen during the 
day, there is a thriving and friendly population on Raymond Island near
Paynesville in Victoria. You have a good chance on Otway Coast, on the Great 
Ocean Road, or even in the National Park walk near Noosa on the Sunshine Coast. 
</li> 
<li> <b>Emu</b> are more common in central Australia. You will certainly see 
some if you venture to the outback national park atCurrawinya </li> 
<li> <b>Platypus</b> are found in reedy flowing creeks with soft river banks 
in Victoria, Southern New South Wales, and the very southern region of 
Queensland - seen at dusk and dawn - you have to have a bit of luck to see one. 
Try the platypus reserves inBombala or Delegate in New South Wales, or in Emu 
Creek atSkipton just out of Ballarat. </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Landmarks</h3> 
<p>Australia has many landmarks, famous the world over. From Uluru in the red 
centre, to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House in Sydney.</p> 
<h3>[edit] The unusual</h3> 
<p>See some of the Big things in Australia. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Sports</h3> 
<p>Sport is an integral part of the Australian culture from the capital cities 
to country towns. The majority of games are played over the weekend period 
(from Friday night to Monday night).</p> 
<ul> 
<li> In the winter in Victoria <b>Aussie Rules</b> (Australian Rules Football) 
is more than just a sport, it is a way of life. Catch a game at the Melbourne 
Cricket Ground. The national competition has teams from Sydney, Brisbane, 
Adelaide, Perth, and the Gold Coast as well.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> In summer, international <b>cricket</b> is played between Australia and 
at least two touring sides. The games rotate around all the capital cities. To 
experience the traditional game catch the New Year's test match at the Sydney 
cricket ground played for 5 days starting from the 2nd of January, or the 
Boxing Day Test match in Melbourne. Or for a more lively entertaining form, 
that only takes a few hours, try a twenty-twenty match. The final form is 
&quot;One Day&quot; Cricket, international matches generally start at 13:00 and 
finish at 22:00 or 23:00 (a &quot;Day-Nighter&quot;), with most domestic and 
occasional international matches played from 11:00 to 18:00. The<b>Australia Day
</b> One Day International is held in Adelaide every 26 January. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> The Australian Open, one of the <b>tennis</b> Grand Slams, is played 
annually inMelbourne. Or the Medibank International in Sydney Olympic Park in 
January.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Catch a <b>rugby union</b> Super Rugby game, with teams playing from 
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth 
and Sydney during late Summer/Autumn. The Australian national team, the 
Wallabies, also host international teams during winter, including New Zealand, 
South Africa and (starting in 2012) Argentina for The Rugby Championship 
(formerly the Tri Nations tournament).</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Rugby League is a winter game played mainly in New South Wales and 
Queensland, with the National Rugby League competition. Teams include Melbourne 
in Victoria, Brisbane, North Queensland and the Gold Coast in Queensland, a 
team from New Zealand, with the rest of the teams coming from suburban areas in 
Sydney, and some in regional areas of New South Wales such as Newcastle and 
Canberra.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Netball</b> is Australia's largest female sport, and there are weekly 
games in an international competition between Australia and New Zealand teams.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Football (Soccer)</b> is a small event by European standards, but 
there is a national A-League, which is a fully professional league involving 
teams from Australia and one from New Zealand, with games played weekly during 
the summer. Most cities have a semi-professional &quot;state league&quot; 
played during winter, with most clubs being built around a specific 
ethnic/migrant community.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Itineraries</h3> 
<ul>

<li>Gunbarrel Highway </li> 
<li>Oodnadatta Track </li> 
<li>Stuart Highway: crossing Australia north-south </li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Do</h2> 
<h3>[edit]  Swim </h3> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>in the surf</b>. Australia has seemingly endless sandy beaches. Follow 
the crowds to the world famousBondi Beach in Sydney, or Surfers Paradise on the 
Gold Coast. Or find a stretch all for yourself (but beware of dangerous rips on 
beaches, it is considerably safer to find a patrolled beach). The surf is 
smaller and warmer in the Tropical North, where the reef breaks the swell, and 
larger and colder in the south with waves rolling in from the Southern Ocean. 
(And yes, in the middle it is<i>just right</i>). </li> 
<li><b>in calm tropical oceans</b>. Cable Beach in Broome is swept pristine 
daily by the tide, has perfect sand, and warm water - go in winter.</li> 
<li><b>in thermal pools</b>. South of Darwin there are many natural thermal 
pools such as Berry Springs &amp; Mataranka, surrounded by palms and tropical 
foliage. The most expensive resort in the world couldn't dream of making a pool 
this good.</li> 
<li><b>in freshwater lakes</b>. Inland Australia tends to be dry, but there 
are freshwater lakes where you would least expect them. Explore inland of 
Cairns at the Atherton Tablelands, or head outback to theCurrawinya National 
Park. </li> 
<li><b>in rivers</b>. If its hot, and there is water, there will be a place to 
swim. Wherever you are, just ask around for the favourite swimming spot, with a 
waterhole and rope to swing on.</li> 
<li><b>in man-made pools</b>. The local swimming pool is often the hub of 
community life on a summer Sunday in the country towns of New South Wales and 
Victoria. Many of the beachside suburbs of Sydney have man made rock pools for 
swimming by the ocean beaches.</li> 
<li> <b>on the beach</b>! Find your spot by the water, and get out the towel. 
Tropical north in the winter, down south in the summer. As always when in 
Australia, protect yourself from the sun.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Bushwalking</h3> 
<p>Bushwalking is a popular Australian activity. You can go bushwalking in the 
many National parks and Rainforests in the country.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Diving </h3> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Snorkelling</b> take a trip out to the Great Barrier Reef on the 
Queensland coast, or theNingaloo Reef off the coast of Western Australia. Or 
take a trip out to Julian rocks offByron Bay, or just dive in off the beach to 
see the tropical fish inBundaberg. </li> 
<li> Scuba Diving </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit]  Sports </h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Golf </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Rock Climbing</b> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Mountain Biking</b>. Try the trails in the Snowy Mountains or black 
mountain in Canberra, or cycle for days along the Munda Biddi Mountain Bike 
trail in Western Australia.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Horse Riding</b> . The horse has a rich tradition in the settlement of 
Australia since the arrival of the first European settlers. Relying on the 
horse to travel the vast distances and harsh environments of Australia was the 
foundation of a strong and lasting relationship between Australians and their 
horses. Today horse riding in Australia includes many recreational and 
occupational activities from cattle musters on vast stations, to the 
multi-million dollar racing industry. On the outskirts of towns and cities and 
out in the rural landscape, you will see the many pony paddocks and much loved 
horses that are a testament to the ongoing passion and commitment Australian 
horse owners have to their horses and the enjoyment they bring.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit]  Ski </h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Skiing. New South Wales and Victoria have well developed ski facilities. 
Tasmania can also have skiing for a few months of the year, given the right 
weather.</li> </ul> 
<p>See Winter sports in Australia </p> 
<h3>[edit]  Thrill Activities </h3> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Sky Diving</b>, all around Australia </li> 
<li><b>Hot Air Ballooning</b>, in Canberra, Brisbane or in the Red Centre. 
</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit]  Gamble </h3> 
<p>It has been said that if there are two flies crawling up a wall, then you 
just need to look around to find the Aussie who will be running a book.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Casinos</b>. Crown Casino in Melbourne is Australia's largest, nicely 
located at Southbank, but there are others scattered in every capital city as 
well as Cairns,Launceston, the Gold Coast and Townsville. </li> 
<li> <b>Day at the races</b>. All capital cities have horse racing every 
weekend, with on-track and off-track betting available, they are usually family 
occasions, and fashion and being seen are part of the event. Just about every 
pub in New South Wales will have a TAB, where you can place a bet without 
leaving your chair at the bar. Greyhound racing and trotting happens in the 
evenings, usually with smaller crowds, more beer, and less fashion. Smaller 
country towns have race meetings every few months or even annually. These are 
real events for the local communities, and see the smaller towns come to life. 
Head outback to theBirdsville races, or if you find the streets deserted it is 
probably ten past three on the first Tuesday in November (the running of the 
Melbourne cup).</li> 
<li><b>The unusual</b>. The lizard races, cane toad races, camel races, crab 
races. Betting on these races is totally illegal, and at you will find the TIB 
(Totally Illegal Betting) around the back of the shed at the annual guinea pig 
races atGrenfell. </li> 
<li><b>Two up</b>. If you are around for Anzac Day (25 April), then betting on 
coins thrown into the air will be happening at your local RSL club, wherever 
you are.</li> 
<li> Australia has almost a quarter of all the <b>slot machines</b> (locally 
known as &quot;pokies&quot; or &quot;poker machines&quot;) in the world, and 
more than half of these are located in New South Wales, where most pubs and 
clubs have gaming rooms (labelled &quot;VIP lounges&quot; for legal reasons) 
where one can &quot;have a slap&quot; and go for the feature.</li> 
<li> If none of this appeals, and you just have too much money in your pocket, 
<b>every town and suburb in Australia has a TAB</b>. Pick your sport, pick a 
winner, and hand over your money at the counter.</li> </ul> 
<p>Gambling is illegal for under-18's. This can often restrict entry to parts 
of pubs, clubs, and casinos for children.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Talk</h2> 
<p>Expect everyone to speak English. Generally the only Australians who are 
not fluent English speakers are older people who immigrated as adults.</p> 
<p>There is no single commonly used second language. It is fairly rare to find 
signs in a second language, except in urban areas with a high population of 
Asian immigrants and students, where signs and restaurant menus in Vietnamese 
and Chinese are a common sight; and also aroundCairns in tropical Queensland 
where some signs (but not road signs) are written inJapanese, due to the large 
number of Japanese tourists. Some warning signs at beaches are written in 
several foreign languages.</p> 
<p>Australians usually do not speak a second language fluently unless they are 
part of a family who immigrated recently. As Australia has a large number of 
immigrants, there are a number of minority languages spoken by a sizable number 
of Australians including (but not limited to) Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese, 
German, Italian, Polish and Greek. In Australia's Chinatowns in Sydney, 
Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth, Cantonese is the dominant language.</p> 
<p>Australian slang should not present a problem for tourists except possibly 
in some isolated outback areas. A few words and euphemisms that are considered 
offensive elsewhere are common vernacular in Australian speech. Fanny, as in 
the UK, means vagina and is not used widely. Still, Australians are familiar 
enough with the differences to know what you mean, but they may still have a 
laugh at your expense.</p> 
<p>Visitors who do not speak basic English will find communicating with 
Australians difficult, and should do some advance planning. There are some tour 
companies who specialise in offering package deals for Australian tours 
complete with guides who speak particular languages.</p> 
<p>There are over a hundred Aboriginal languages still known and spoken by 
Aboriginal people. These languages are all different, and you won't see an 
Aboriginal phrasebook in the travel bookshops. Many Aboriginal place names 
derive from Aboriginal languages that have been lost, and their meanings remain 
uncertain. Aboriginal people living in rural Aboriginal communities continue to 
speak their respective languages. The Torres Strait Islander people, who 
originate from a group of islands in northern Queensland near Papua New Guinea 
also continue to speak their own languages. Almost all Aboriginal people speak 
English as well, although some elders may not be fluent.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Buy</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Costs</h3> 
<p>Dorm accommodation in a capital city is around $30, but can run as low as 
$15 in Cairns or cheaper backpacker centres. A basic motel in the country or in 
the capital city suburbs would cost around $100 for a double. City Centre hotel 
accommodation in capital cities can be obtained for around $150 upwards for a 
double. Formule 1/Motel 6 style hotels (which are not common) can be around 
$60-$90 for a double.</p> 
<p>Car hire will cost around $65 a day. Public transport day passes from 
$10-20 per day depending on the city.</p> 
<p>A cafe meal costs around $10-$15, and a main course in a restaurant goes 
from around $17 upwards.</p> 
<p>A basic takeaway meal - a burger, fancy sandwich, or couple of slices of 
pizza would cost $5-10, a Big Mac costs $4.50, and you can usually grab a pie 
for around $3, or a sausage roll for $2.50. A takeaway pizza from Pizza Hut big 
enough to feed two costs around $10.</p> 
<p>A middy/pot (285ml) of house beer will cost you around $4, and a glass of 
house wine around $6 in a low end pub. To take away, a case of 24 cans of beer 
will cost around $40, or a bottle of wine around $8.</p> 
<p>An airfare between neighbouring eastern capitals is around $120 each way 
but can get as low as $60 if you book at the right time, or around $350 to 
cross the country assuming that you are flexible with dates and book in 
advance. A train trip on the state run trains will usually cost slightly less. 
A bus trip, a little less again. A train trip on the private trains will be the 
most expensive way to travel.</p> 
<p>There is usually no admission charge to beaches or city parks. Some popular 
National Parks charge between $10-20 per day (per car, or per person depending 
on the state) while more out of the way National Parks are free. Art Galleries 
and some attractions are free. Museums generally charge around $10 per 
admission. Theme parks charge around $70 per person.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Currency</h3> 
<p>Australian currency is known as the <i>dollar</i>, and the currency symbol 
is &quot;$&quot;. There are 100 cents in every dollar. The dollar is called 
'the Australian dollar' usually written as 'AUD' or A$ when it is necessary to 
distinguish it from other currencies. No other currency is accepted for 
transactions in Australia.</p> 
<p>The coin denominations are 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, $1 and $2. The note 
denominations are $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. Australian notes are produced in 
plastic polymer rather than paper. If the total of a transaction is not a 
multiple of 5 cents the amount will be rounded to the nearest five cents if you 
are paying in cash. The exact amount will be charged if paying by card.</p> 
<p>The dollar is not pegged to any other currency, and is highly traded on 
world foreign exchange markets, particularly by currency speculators. Its 
exchange value to other currencies can be quite volatile, and 1-2% changes in a 
day are a reasonably regular occurrences.</p> 
<p>Money changers in Australia operate in a free market, and charge a range of 
flat commissions, percentage fees, undisclosed fees built into the exchange 
rate, and a combination of all three. Generally the best bet is to avoid 
airports and tourist centres when changing money, and use banks in major 
centres. Expect fees to vary considerably between institutions. Always get a 
quote before changing money.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Cash </h3> 
<p>Cash dispensing Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) are available in almost 
every Australian town. Australian ATMs are deregulated and may impose a 
surcharge over what is charged by your bank or card issuer. The fees can vary 
between institutions and between locations, but are usually around $2. The ATM 
will display the charges and you will have the option to stop the transaction 
before you are charged. Check with your bank as to what additional fees they 
apply to withdrawals in Australia.</p> 
<p>Dedicated currency exchange outlets are widely available in major cities, 
and banks can also exchange most non-restricted currencies. These exchange 
outlets - especially the ones at the airport - can charge 10% over the best 
exchange that can be obtained from shopping around. Australian banks usually 
offer an exchange rate around 2.5% from the current exchange midpoint. A flat 
commission of $5-8 can be charged on top. Some outlets advertise commission 
free exchange, usually accompanied by a worse rate of exchange. Don't assume 
every bank will offer the same exchange. A simple calculation will let you know 
what offers the best deal for amount you wish to exchange. There are vouchers 
for commission free exchange at American Express available in the tourist 
brochure at Sydney Airport.</p> 
<p>There is also no need to arrive in Australia with cash if you have a 
Cirrus, Maestro, MasterCard or Visa card: international airport terminals will 
have multiple teller machines that can dispense Australian currency with just 
the fees imposed by your bank plus the ATM fee.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Credit cards </h3> 
<p>Credit cards are widely accepted in Australia. Almost all large vendors 
such as supermarkets accept cards, as do many, but not all, small stores. 
Australian debit cards can also be used via a system known as EFTPOS. Any card 
showing the Cirrus or Maestro logos can be used at any terminal displaying 
those logos.</p> 
<p>VISA or MasterCard are commonly accepted and are both accepted everywhere 
credit cards are accepted. American Express and Diners Club are accepted at 
major supermarket and department store chains and many tourist destinations. 
JCB is only accepted at very limited tourist destinations. Discover is never 
accepted.</p> 
<p><b>Credit card surcharges</b> are imposed at all car rental agencies, 
travel agents, airlines, and at some discount retailers and service stations. 
Surcharges are far more common for American Express and Diners Club (typically 
2%-4%) than they are for VISA and Mastercard (typically 1.5%).</p> 
<h3>[edit] Haggling</h3> 
<p>Bargaining is uncommon in Australian stores, though vendors are usually 
willing to meet or beat a quote or advertised price from a competing retailer. 
It's also worth asking for a &quot;best price&quot; for high-value goods or 
purchases involving several items. For example, it would not be unusual to get 
10% off an item of jewelry that was not already reduced in price. The person 
you are dealing with may have limited authority to sell items at anything other 
than the marked price.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Tipping</h3> 
<p>Tipping is never compulsory and is usually not expected in Australia. Staff 
are seen to be paid an appropriate wage and will certainly not chase you down 
for a tip. It is acceptable to pay the amount stated on the bill. When 
Australians do tip, it will often be in the form of leaving the change from a 
cash payment (usually as a convenience so the change does not hang around loose 
on someone's person - not as a gratuity), rather than a fixed percentage.</p> 
<p>In a suburban or country restaurant where table service is offered, they 
will certainly take a tip of 5%-10% should you decide to leave one, but it is 
almost always not expected, and locals usually do not leave any. In a cafe or 
more informal restaurant, even with table service, and even in tourist centres, 
leaving a tip is unusual. Sometimes there is a coin jar by the cashier labelled 
'Tips', but more often than not, diners do not leave one.</p> 
<p>Tipping is also not expected in taxis, and drivers will typically return 
your change to the last 5 cents, unless you indicate that they should round the 
fare to the nearest dollar (it is not unusual for passengers to instruct the 
driver to round up to the next whole dollar).</p> 
<h3>[edit] Trading hours</h3> 
<p>Australia's <b>base trading hours</b> are Monday-Friday 9AM-5PM. Shops 
usually have a single night of late night trading, staying open until 9PM on 
Fridays in most cities and on Thursdays in Sydney. Opening hours beyond these 
base hours vary by the type of store, by location, and by state. See the guides 
for more local information.</p> 
<p>Major supermarket chains in main centres are generally open at least until 
9pm. Smaller convenience stores like 7/11 are open 24 hours in major centres. 
Fast Food restaurant chains are commonly open 24 hours or at least very late.
</p> 
<p>Fuel/Service stations are open 24 hours in major centres, but often close 
at 6pm and on Sundays in country towns.</p> 
<p>Australia's <b>weekend</b> is on Saturday and Sunday of each week. Retail 
trading is now almost universal in larger cities on weekends, although with 
slightly reduced hours. Again, Western Australia is an exception with 
restrictions on large stores opening on Sundays. In smaller country towns shops 
are closed on Sundays and often also on Saturday afternoons.</p> 
<p>Tourist-oriented towns and shops may stay open longer hours. Tourist areas 
within cities, such asDarling Harbour in Sydney has longer trading hours every 
night.</p> 
<p>Australian banks are open Monday-Friday 09:00-16:00 only, often closing at 
17:00 on Fridays. Cash is available through Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) 24 
hours, and currency exchange outlets have extended hours and are open on 
weekends.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Tax</h3> 
<p>Australia has a sales tax known as the <i>Goods and Services Tax</i> or <i>
GST</i> that applies to all goods and services except unprocessed foods, 
education and medical services. GST is always<i>included</i> in the price of 
any item you purchase rather than being added at the time of payment.</p> 
<p>Receipts (tax invoices) will contain the GST amount, which is one eleventh 
of the total value of taxable supplies.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Sales tax refunds </h4> 
<p>If you buy items over $300 at one place at one time you can obtain a refund 
of the GST if you take the items out of Australia within 30 days. Pack the 
items in hand luggage, and present the item(s) and the receipt at the TRS, 
after immigration and security when leaving Australia. Also allow an extra 15 
minutes before departure. The refund payment can be made by either cheque, 
credit to an Australian bank account, or payment to a credit card. There is no 
refund available for services.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Eat</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Places to eat</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Restaurants</b>, Australians eat out frequently, and you will usually 
find one or two options to eat out even in small towns, with a wider range in 
larger towns and cities.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>BYO restaurants</b>, BYO stands for <i>Bring Your Own</i> (alcohol). 
In many of the urban communities of Australia you will find small low-cost 
restaurants that are not licensed to serve but allow diners to bring their own 
bottle of wine purchased elsewhere. This is frequently much cheaper than 
ordering a bottle of wine in a restaurant. Beer can be taken to some BYO 
restaurants, others allow only wine. Expect to pay a corkage fee which can vary 
from $2-15, or may be calculated by head. BYO is not usually permitted in 
restaurants that are licensed to sell alcohol.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Pubs</b>, the counter lunch is the name for a lunch served in the bar 
of a pub. Traditionally served only at lunchtime in the lounge. Today most pubs 
provide lunch and dinner and many have a separate bistro or restaurant. Meals 
of steak, chicken parmigiana, nachos are common.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Clubs</b>, clubs, such as bowling clubs, leagues clubs, RSLs are in 
many towns and cities. They are most common in the states of Queensland and New 
South Wales. Most allow visitors, and sometimes offer good value meals. Some 
offer attractive locations, like the water views from the Twin Towns inTweed 
Heads. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Cafes</b>, most towns and suburbs have a cafe or coffee shop, serving 
breakfast and light meals and cakes throughout the day. Not unusual for them to 
close before dinner.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Bakeries</b>, usually a good place to buy bread rolls, a pie or a 
sausage roll. Some, like theBeechworth bakery, or the bakery in historic 
Gundagai offer an experience as well. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Fast food restaurants</b>, McDonalds, Subway and KFC are common. 
Burger King is known as Hungry Jack's. Red Rooster is a Australian chain, 
offering barbecued chicken and other mostly chicken-based items.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Take-away</b>, milk bars or take-away stores usually sell pies, 
barbecued (rotisserie) chicken, hamburgers, fish and chips, gyros, kebabs. 
Ubiquitous in every town and suburb.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Food courts</b>, most shopping centres have a food court, even in 
country towns.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Picnic</b>, the Australian climate is usually amenable to getting 
whatever food you can, and heading to the nearest park, river, lake or beach.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Barbecue</b>, is a popular Australian pastime and many parks in 
Australia provide free barbecues for public use. Contrary to the stereotype, 
Australians rarely &quot;Throw a shrimp on the barbie&quot; (also, in Australia 
a shrimp is more commonly referred to as a prawn). Steaks, chops, sausages, 
chicken fillets, fish, kebabs are popularly barbecued.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Native foods</h3> <br>
Try the pie 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Kangaroo</b>, if you fancy some, it is commonly available from most 
supermarkets and butchers shops. Head to the nearest park, and barbecue it 
until medium rare. Best not to overcook as it may become quite<i>tough</i>. It 
tastes much like beef. It occasionally makes it onto the menu in restaurants, 
mostly in tourist areas. Kangaroos aren't endangered, and kangaroo grazing does 
far less damage to the sensitive Australian environment than hoofed animals, 
and far less carbon emissions too. If you are not ready to go vegetarian, 
kangaroo is the best environmental statement you can make while barbecuing.</li>
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Crocodile</b>, meat from farms in the Northern Territory and 
Queensland is widely available around the top end, and occasionally elsewhere. 
At Rockhampton, the beef capital of Australia, you can see the ancient reptile 
on a farm while munching on a croc burger.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Emu</b>, yes, you can eat the Australian Coat of Arms. Emu is low in 
fat, and available in some speciality butchers. Try the Coat of Arms pie in
Maleny on the Sunshine Coast. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Bush tucker</b>, many tours may give you an opportunity to try some 
bush tucker, the berries, nuts, roots, ants, and grubs from Australia's native 
bush. Macadamia nuts are the only native plant to Australia that is grown for 
food commercially. Taste some of the other bush foods, and you will discover 
why.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Beyond cuisine</h3> 
<p><b>Vegemite</b>, a salty yeast-based spread, best spread thinly on toast. 
If you aren't up for buying a jar, any coffee shop will serve vegemite on toast 
at breakfast time. It may not even be on the menu, but the vegemite will be out 
the back in the jar next to the marmalade. If you do buy a jar, the secret is 
it to spread it very thin, and don't forget the butter as well. It tastes 
similar to Marmite or Cenovis. Australians are quite used to the taste, and may 
spread the Vegemite very thick; but this is not recommended for first-timers.
</p> 
<p>The <b>Tim-Tam</b>, is a chocolate fudge-filled sandwich of two chocolate 
biscuits, all dipped in chocolate. You can buy a packet (or two) from any 
supermarket or convenience store. Tim-Tams are required to perform the<i>
Tim-Tam Slam</i> manoeuvre. This requires biting off both ends of the Tim-Tam, 
then using it as a straw to drink your favourite hot beverage, typically 
coffee. The hot drink melts the fudge centre and creates an experience hard to 
describe. Finesse is needed to suck the whole biscuit into your mouth in the 
microseconds between being fully saturated and dissolving. Tim-Tams are sold in 
packs of 11, so be sure to agree on the sharing arrangements before buying a 
packet with your travel partner, or onward travel arrangements may be disrupted.
</p> 
<p>The <b>lamington</b> is a cube of sponge cake covered in chocolate icing 
and dipped in desiccated coconut. It's named after Lord Lamington, who served 
as Governor of Queensland from 1896 to 1901. The home-baked form can be found 
at a local Saturday morning market, or you can buy one from a bakery if you are 
desperate. Avoid at all costs the plastic wrapped varieties sold in 
supermarkets.</p> 
<p>The <b>pavlova</b> is a meringue cake with a cream topping usually 
decorated with fresh fruit. Served on special occasions, or after a lunchtime 
barbecue. Often the source of dispute withNew Zealand over the original source 
of the recipe.</p> 
<p><b>ANZAC biscuits</b> are a mix of coconut, oats, flour, sugar and golden 
syrup. They were reputedly sent by wives and care organisations to world war 
soldiers in care packages, but the story is likely apocryphal. They are 
available from bakeries, cafes and supermarkets, and are popular in the lead up 
to ANZAC day (25 April).</p> 
<p><b>Damper</b> is a traditional soda bread that was baked by drovers and 
stockmen. It has basic ingredients (flour, water and perhaps salt) and usually 
cooked in the embers of a fire. It is not routinely available in bakeries and 
only commonly served to tourists on organised tours. Best eaten with butter and 
jam or golden syrup as it is dry and bland.</p> 
<p>A <b>pie floater</b> is a South Australian dish available around Adelaide. 
It is a pie inverted in a bowl of thick mushy pea soup. Similar pie variations 
are sometimes available in other regions.</p> 
<p>A <b>Chiko roll</b> is a deep-fried snack inspired by the egg roll or the 
spring roll. Despite the name, it contains no chicken. Its filling is boned 
mutton, vegetables, rice, barley, and seasonings. Its shell is thicker than an 
egg roll, meant to survive handling at football matches. Available anywhere you 
can buy fish and chips.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Other cuisines </h3> 
<p>Cuisines widely available in Australia, often prepared by members of the 
relevant culture, include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Chinese</b>, synonymous with the term &quot;takeaway&quot; in the past 
generations. Many Chinese restaurants still cater to takeaway addicts today, 
mostly of the Australianized Chinese variety, but major cities have small 
&quot;Chinatowns&quot; or suburbs with a large number of ethnic Chinese 
residents, that have excellent restaurants serving authentic Chinese food.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Thai</b>, especially in Sydney. As above, suburban Thai restaurants of 
indifferent quality are starting to replace the previous generation of Chinese 
restaurants of indifferent quality, but Australia also has excellent and 
authentic Thai restaurants.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Italian</b>, the Italian community is one of the largest ethnic 
communities of non Anglo-Saxon origin in Australia, and they have contributed 
greatly to the cafe culture that has flourished across the major cities over 
the past few decades. Restaurants either serve Italian food that has been 
adapted to suit Australian tastes, or authentic regional Italian food, with the 
latter tending to be pricier and in more upmarket surrounds.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Greek</b>, as above. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Lebanese</b>, especially in Sydney. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Indian</b>, especially North Indian. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Japanese</b>, including bento takeaway shops and sushi trains. </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Vietnamese</b>, although many are Vietnamese Chinese run and thus 
provide a more Chinese experience.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Asian fusion</b>, refers generally to Asian-inspired dishes. </li> 
</ul> 
<h3>[edit] Vegetarian</h3> 
<p>Eating vegetarian is quite common in Australia and many restaurants offer 
at least one or two vegetarian dishes. Some will have an entire vegetarian menu 
section. Vegans may have more difficulty but any restaurant with a large 
vegetarian menu should offer some flexibility. In large cities you will find a 
number of vegetarian and vegan restaurants, as well as in the coastal 
backpacker-friendly towns along the east coast. The market town ofKuranda or 
the seaside towns ofByron Bay are a vegetarian's paradise. In other regional 
areas vegetarians are often poorly catered for, but most towns will have a 
Chinese restaurant that will provide steamed rice and vegetables. Melbourne 
caters well for vegans with a greater number of purely vegetarian restaurants 
per person than many other western cities, it has vegan clothing stores and 
even a vegan supermarket.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Religious diets</h3> 
<p>People observing kosher or halal will easily be able to find specialist 
butchers in the capital cities, and will also find a number of restaurants with 
appropriate menus and cooking styles. Outside the capital cities, it will be 
much more difficult to find food prepared in a strict religious manner.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Markets</h3> 
<p>All of the capital cities and many regional towns in Australia host a 
&quot;farmer's market&quot;, which is generally held each week in a designated 
area on a Saturday or Sunday. These markets mostly sell fresh fruits and 
vegetables, as hygiene standards in Australia forbid the selling of meat 
directly from market stalls. Butchers who set up shop at a farmer's market 
would usually trade their wares from a display cabinet within their truck. The 
attraction of markets is the lower prices and freshness of the produce. The 
attraction for the traveller will be the cheap and excellent fruits on offer - 
depending on the region and season. In regional areas the market is usually 
held outside the town itself in an empty paddock or sports field, markets in 
capital cities are easier to reach but the prices are typically more in line 
with those you would find in supermarkets. See the destination guides for 
details.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Drink</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Varieties</h3> 
<h4>[edit] Beer</h4> 
<p>Drinking <b>beer</b> is ingrained in Australian culture. Although Fosters 
is promoted as an Australian beer overseas, it is rarely consumed by 
Australians in Australia, and is almost impossible to find. Beers are strongly 
regional and every state has its own brews: Coopers and West End in South 
Australia, Carlton and VB in Victoria, Tooheys in NSW, XXXX in Queensland, 
Boags and Cascade in Tasmania, and Swan in Western Australia. There are also 
local microbrew choices, which can be harder to find, but are often worth 
seeking out. A wide range of imported European and American bottled beers are 
available in all but the most basic pub.</p> 
<p>Light (Lite) beer refers to lower alcoholic content, and not lower 
calories. It has around half the alcohol of full strength beer, and is taxed at 
a lower rate, meaning it is also cheaper than full strength beer.</p> 
<p>Because Australians like their beer to stay cold while they drink it, draft 
beer glasses come in a multitude of sizes, so that you can drink a whole glass 
before it warms up in the summer heat. The naming of beer glasses varies widely 
from state to state, often in confusing ways: a<b>schooner</b> is 425 ml 
everywhere except South Australia, where it's only 285 ml, a size that's known 
elsewhere as a<b>middy</b> or <b>pot</b>, except in Darwin where it's a <b>
handle</b>, but in Adelaide a &quot;pot&quot; means a 570 ml full pint, and a 
<i>pint</i> means what a <i>schooner</i> does elsewhere, and... you get the 
idea. The local beers and the local descriptions are covered in detail in the 
state guides.</p> 
<p>Bottle naming is a little easier: the standard sizes across Australia are 
the 375 ml<b>stubby</b> and the 750 ml <b>long neck</b>. Cans of beer are known 
as<b>tinnies</b> and 24 of them make up a <b>slab</b>, <b>box</b>, <b>carton</b>
, or a<b>case</b>. </p> 
<h4>[edit] Wine</h4> 
<p>Australia produces quality wine on a truly industrial scale, with large 
multinational brands supplying Australian bottleshops and exporting around the 
world. There are also a multitude of boutique wineries and smaller suppliers. 
Very good red and white wine can be bought very cheaply in Australia, often at 
less than $10 a bottle, and even the smallest shop could be expected to have 50 
or more varieties to choose from.</p> 
<p>The areas of the Barossa Valley, Hunter Valley, and Margaret River are 
particularly renowned for their wineries and opportunities for cellar door 
sampling, but northern Victoria andMudgee, also have a large variety. You are 
never too far from a wine trail anywhere in southern Australia.</p> 
<p>Try the local wines wherever you can find them, and ask for local 
recommendations. Try not to get taken in by the label, or the price tag. The 
best wine is rarely the one with the best artwork, or the most expensive price. 
However, it is probably wise to avoid the house wine if it comes straight from 
a cask (4-litre container). Wines at the cellar door are almost invariably sold 
at around 20% premium to the same wine in the shops in the local town.</p> 
<p>If you still prefer overseas wines, the Marlborough region of New Zealand 
is usually well represented on wine lists and in bottle shops in Australia.</p> 
<p>See also Grape grazing in Australia. </p> 
<h4>[edit] Spirits</h4> 
<p>Bundaberg Rum (<i>Bundy</i>) is an Australian dark rum particularly popular 
in Queensland and many Queenslanders will not touch any other brand of rum. It 
is probably the most famous Australian made spirit, mass produced inBundaberg 
and available everywhere.</p> 
<p>You will have to search much harder to find other Australian distilled 
spirits, mostly from niche players, but there are distilleries in every state 
of Australia if you look hard enough. Drop into the Lark Distillery on the 
scenic Hobart waterfront precinct. Pick up a bottle of 151 East Vodka in
Wollongong or after a few days in Kununurra you are definitely going to need an 
Ord River Rum.</p> 
<p>Mixed drinks are also available, particularly vodka, scotch, bourbon and 
other whiskey mixers. Jim Beam bourbon is probably the most commonly drunk, so 
those fromKentucky should feel right at home. Spirits are also available as 
pre-mixed bottles and cans but are subject to higher taxation in this form, so 
it is cheaper to mix them yourself. Spirits are served in all pubs and bars, 
but not in all restaurants.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Legal aspects </h3> 
<p>The legal drinking age throughout Australia is <b>18 years</b>. It is 
illegal either to purchase alcohol for yourself if you are under 18 years of 
age. It is illegal to purchase alcohol on behalf of someone who is under 18 
years of age. The only legally acceptable proof-of-age is an Australian drivers 
licence, state-issued proof-of-age card or a passport, and it would be wise to 
carry one if you want to purchase alcohol or tobacco and look under 25. It is 
illegal to go into a gambling area of a pub or club when under 18.</p> 
<p>Often there is a lounge, restaurant or bistro area in a pub or club that 
permits under-age people provided they are accompanied by a responsible adult 
over 18 and don't approach the bar or wander around. Some city pubs even have 
video games and playgrounds for children. Some country pubs have large open 
areas out in the back where kids can run and play.</p> 
<p>In general, you can take alcohol (say a bottle of wine or beer) to consume 
at a park or beach. Alcohol consumption is banned in some public places as 
'street drinking'. These are often indicated by signs and is particularly the 
case in parks and footpaths where public drunkenness has been a problem. 
However, if you are a family with your picnic basket and blanket out at 
lunchtime with a bottle of wine, you are unlikely to encounter any problems.</p>
<p>Alcohol can be purchased for consumption on premises only in <b>licensed 
venues</b>: pubs, clubs and many restaurants. You can purchase alcohol for 
private consumption in<b>bottle shops</b>, which are separate stores selling 
bottled alcohol. In some but not all states you can buy alcohol in<b>
supermarkets</b>. In those states where you can't, bottle shops and major 
supermarkets are often found in very close proximity. Although licensing laws 
and hours vary from state to state, and individual stores have different 
trading hours, as a rule of thumb, alcohol is generally available in towns to 
take-away seven days a week, between the hours of 8AM and 11PM, from bottle 
shops, supermarkets, licensed grocers/milk-bars and pubs. Outside of these 
hours though, it is almost impossible to buy alcohol to take home; unless 
you're in the middle of Sydney or Melbourne, so if you're planning on a party 
at home; it's a good idea to stock up and check on the local trading hours so 
you don't run out at 00:30 with no opportunity to buy more. Alcohol is not 
available at petrol stations or 24-hour convenience stores anywhere in 
Australia.</p> 
<p>Public drunkenness varies in acceptability. You will certainly find a great 
deal of it in close proximity to pubs and clubs at night time but much less so 
during the day. Public drunkenness is an offence but you would only likely ever 
be picked up by the police if you were causing a nuisance. You may spend the 
night sobering up in a holding cell or be charged.</p> 
<p><b>Driving while affected by alcohol</b> is both stigmatized and policed by 
random breath testing police patrols in Australia, as well as being inherently 
dangerous. Drink driving is a very serious offence in Australia, punishable by 
a range of mechanisms including loss of license. The acceptable maximum blood 
alcohol concentration is 0.05% in all states, often lower or not allowed for 
operators of heavy vehicles and young or novice drivers. Police officers are 
also empowered to randomly test drivers for the recent use of prohibited drugs. 
The operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of prohibited drugs 
or alcohol will always result in arrest and a required court appearance many 
weeks from the date of arrest and it can comprehensively disrupt travel plans. 
Random breath testing is common early Saturday and Sunday mornings, and many 
people are caught the morning after.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  A shout </h3> 
<p>Buying a round of drinks is a custom in Australia, as in many corners of 
the world. It is generally expected in a pub that when you arrive and make your 
first trip to the bar that you will offer to buy a drink for others you are 
drinking with. Similarly this will likely be done to you when someone else 
joins the group. This is called<i>a shout</i>, and incurs an obligation that 
you will generally return the favour in a following round, and that also you 
will generally maintain the same drinking pace as your associates in the round 
throughout the evening. If someone in the same round as you has an empty glass, 
who is ahead of you in drinks bought, you should declare that it is your shout, 
and make your way to the bar. If someone offers to buy you a drink, but does 
not offer to buy for the person who already has bought you a drink, you should 
say you are already in a shout, and decline. If they buy you and the people in 
your round a drink, they have joined the shout. Its generally not polite to 
switch between shouts during an evening. It you are in a large shout, and you 
decline a drink, you still have to buy a drink for the round when it comes to 
your turn. You are well advised if you wish to skip a round, to do so on your 
shout. It is generally poorly received to buy a round, and then to refuse a 
drink when one is purchased for you. Often the drink will just be bought for 
you without even asking. Don't be surprised if someone who bought you a drink 
earlier in the night, later says that it is your shout. Not joining a shout can 
be awkward in some groups. The best way is to say you are driving, and you will 
buy your own drinks. This is also an acceptable way to drop out after one 
round, when the score is even.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Learn</h2> 
<p>If you are intending to study in Australia, you may need to be on a visa 
class that allows this, rather than a tourist visa. Students and academics 
invited to visit Australian universities will generally also need an 
appropriate visa, even if their visit is of a short enough period to be covered 
by a tourist electronic visa. For extremely short term or part time courses, 
check with your Australian consulate or embassy.</p> 
<p>Australian students attend high school for six years, and enter university 
at seventeen or eighteen years of age. (In Australia, neither 
&quot;school&quot; nor &quot;college&quot; are used to refer to tertiary 
institutions; they are referred to only as &quot;universities&quot; - in fact, 
some primary and secondary educational institutions are referred to as 
'colleges'). Australian undergraduate programs are usually<b>three to four years
</b> in length. A fifth year is compulsory in some professional undergraduate 
programs such as engineering, law, medicine and dentistry. Students in 
three-year degree programs can take an optional fourth year known as<b>honours
</b> if they want to proceed into a postgraduate research program, whereas 
students enrolled in four year programs can typically incorporate their honours 
thesis into their fourth year.</p> 
<p>Australia does not have universities whose prestige competes with Harvard 
or the other Ivies in the US or Oxford or Cambridge in the UK. However many are 
ranked in the top 200 in the world (Times Higher Education Supplement).</p> 
<p>All tuition at university level is in <b>English</b>, save for courses that 
specifically focus on other languages. Students who have not previously earned 
a qualification in an English speaking program (or passed high school English) 
will have to take one of a number of English competency tests before being 
allowed to enrol.</p> 
<p><b>Postgraduate</b> studies in Australia fall into two classes: coursework 
and research. Coursework degrees are generally at the Masters level. Research 
degrees are at the Masters and Doctoral level.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Universities </h3> 
<p>There are 39 Universities in Australia that all compete vigorously for 
overseas students. All have administrative departments and sections on their 
websites which describe the courses available to overseas students, and they 
will help you to apply and obtain accommodation and transport. Applications for 
university courses (and the appropriate visa) will need to be lodged before 
coming to Australia. Courses range from single year diplomas to full length 
undergraduate and post-graduate degrees. There is a choice of the<i>sandstone
</i> universities, with their history and prestige, modern city universities 
with their vocational programs, and regional (country town) universities, with 
open space and cheaper accommodation.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Admission </h4> 
<p>Undergraduate admission to university is <b>centralised</b> at the state 
level. You make a single application for admission to the state admissions body 
stating your course preferences. The universities select students from this 
common applicant pool based upon their ranking and preferences. Unless you are 
applying for a creative arts degree, your ranking will be based solely on<b>
previous academic performance</b> at both high school and previous university 
studies.</p> 
<p>Postgraduate admission is managed by individual universities and you will 
need to apply separately to each institution you are considering.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Tuition fees </h4> 
<p>The full fees payable by overseas students are competitive compared to many 
Western universities. Australian citizens have the option of substantially 
reduced fees and also have the option of deferring payment until they are 
earning income.<b>Other students</b> will generally be required to pay full 
tuition on enrolment each semester.</p> 
<p><b>Scholarships</b> are rarely awarded for undergraduate or postgraduate 
coursework degrees. A comparatively large number of scholarships are available 
for postgraduate research usually covering both tuition, where required, and 
living costs. These are awarded by individual universities.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Sleep</h2> 
<p>Accommodation is readily available in most Australian cities and tourist 
destinations. It comes in a number of different styles.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Camping </h3> 
<p>Camping is a popular pastime. Most caravan parks will rent camping sites by 
the night, where you can pitch a tent, and these are available in most towns 
and cities. The caravan park will provide showers and toilets, and sometimes 
washing and cooking facilities. Sometimes for an additional fee. Expect to pay 
around $20 for a tent site, and a few dollars per person. You can even find 
caravan parks right on the beach, with lagoon swimming pools and playgrounds 
all free for guests.</p> 
<p>National parks often provide free camping sites, which expect you to be 
more self-sufficient. Often toilets are provided and sometimes cold showers. 
Camping permits are sometimes required at popular parks, with some popular 
spots filling up during the holidays in summer. In Australia it is common to be 
within an hours drive of a national park or recreation area that will permit 
some form of camping, even in the capital cities. Expect to pay around $5-$10 
per night per person for a camping permit, and national park admission fees in 
the more popular national parks (eg: Wilsons Promontory National Park, 
Kosciuszko National Park, etc), however entry and camping is free in the 
majority of national parks further from population and tourist centres.</p> 
<p>Some other camping areas are run by government or even local landowners. 
Expect around $10 per person per night, depending on the time of year.</p> 
<p>You can try your luck sleeping on a beach or pitching a tent overnight in a 
highway rest area, or out in the bush for a free bed. Most rest areas and 
beaches prohibit camping and many even prohibit overnight parking to discourage 
this. Generally the closer you are to civilisation or a tourist area, the 
greater the chance of being hassled by the authorities.</p> 
<p>Camping in state forests is often preferable to national parks if you're 
after a camping experience over sightseeing, as collecting of your own fire 
wood is allowed (sometimes felling of trees is permissible dependent on the 
area) and camping is not restricted to camp sites. Some other activities that 
are generally allowed in state forests that are not allowed in national parks 
are: bringing in dogs/pets, open fires, motorbikes and four-wheel driving. 
State forests are generally free to stay in, although you will need to check 
locally if public access is allowed.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Hostels and Backpackers </h3> 
<p>Budget hostel-style accommodation with shared bathrooms and often with 
dormitories is approximately $20-$30 per person per night. Facilities usually 
include a fully equipped kitchen with adequate refrigeration and food storage 
areas. Most hostels also have living room areas equipped with couches, dining 
tables, and televisions.</p> 
<p>There are several backpacker hostel chains in Australia. If you are staying 
many nights in the same brand of hostel, consider their discount cards, which 
usually offer a loyalty bonus on accommodation, and other attraction and tour 
discounts negotiated by the chain.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Pubs </h3> 
<p>Most pubs in Australia offer some form of accommodation. It can vary from 
very basic shabby rooms, to newly renovated boutique accommodation. The price 
is usually a good reflection of what you are in for. It is still quite unusual 
to have a private bathroom, even in the nicer pubs.</p> 
<p>Outside of the major centres, the pub is called a <b>Hotel</b>. A motel 
won't have a public bar. A motel that does have a bar attached is called a 
Hotel/Motel.</p> 
<p>In very small towns local pubs offer the only accommodation available to 
travellers. Accommodation in these pubs tends to be budget-style with shared 
bathrooms but private rooms.</p> 
<p>Pub accommodation is even available in the centre of Sydney, making getting 
back to your room after a beer a simple endeavour.</p> 
<p>If you travel as a single, and want a private room, pubs usually have 
single rooms at a discount over a double room. Most motels will charge the same 
price for one or two people sharing a room.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Motels </h3> 
<p>Typically, motel-style accommodation will have a private room with a bed or 
number of beds, and a private shower and toilet. Many motels have family rooms, 
that will usually have a double bed and two single beds in the one room.</p> 
<p>Motel rooms in the cities will generally cost upwards from $80. Usually the 
cost is the same for one or two adults, with any extra people charged an 
additional fee. Prices for additional children can range from free to $20 per 
child. During quiet times its not unusual for motels to offer standby discounts.
</p> 
<p>Most motels will serve a cooked or continental breakfast to your room in 
the morning, for an additional charge. Some may have a restaurant or serve an 
evening meal. Some may have a toaster in the room.</p> 
<p>A number of local and international chains offer motel-style accommodation: 
</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Hotels </h3> 
<p>All state capitals have at least one major hotel at 5 star standard, with 
several available in the major capitals. The majority of Australia's hotels are 
located in the Central Business Districts (CBD) of the capital city. Hotel 
services and hospitality are often excellent such as room cleaning services, 
free morning newspapers, meals to your door and a high-speed internet 
connection up to 24mb/s (often with a premium fee).</p> 
<p>All hotels have a restaurant (or bistro, depending on the type of hotel you 
are staying in). The restaurant or bistro often serves food that is comparable 
to many other up-market restaurants outside the hotel. Also on the ground floor 
would normally be a fully equipped bar.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Cabins </h3> 
<p>Cabins are an economical way for families to stay while travelling. 
Sometimes built on private land, sometimes in caravan parks, cabins typically 
have a kitchen / lounge area, and one, two or three bedrooms.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Farm Stay </h3> 
<p>Much as the name suggests, this usually involves a cabin or homestead 
accommodation on a working property. Suited for a stay of two or more days, 
this accommodation usually allows you to get a little involved in the running 
of the farm if you wish. It is common for dinner to be provided in the 
homestead, and a breakfast pack to be provided to your cabin.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Holiday home </h3> 
<p>Holiday homes are homes rented by their owners, often using local real 
estate agents or specialised web sites. Sometimes located in prime positions, 
but also sometimes in the residential sections of cities and towns. Minimum 
rental periods of at least 2 days usually apply, rising to a week during 
periods when they are busy. At a minimum will have bedrooms, a lounge, bathroom.
</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Bed and Breakfasts </h3> 
<p>Bed and Breakfasts tend to be a premium form of accommodation in Australia, 
often focussed on weekend accommodation for couples. They certainly don't offer 
the discount form of accommmodation they do in part of theUnited Kingdom, and 
the local motel will usually be cheaper.</p> 
<p>Sometimes extra rooms in a person's home, but often a purpose built 
building. You should expect a cosy, well kept room, a common area, and a cooked 
breakfast. Possibly private facilities. Substantial discounts often apply for 
mid-week stays at bed and breakfasts.</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Resorts </h3> 
<p>There are many true resorts around Australia. Many have lagoon pools, 
tennis, golf, kids clubs, and other arranged activities. The island of the
Whitsundays have a choice of resorts, some occupying entire islands. Port 
Douglas also has many resorts of a world standard. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Serviced apartments</h3> 
<p>Serviced apartments are widely available, for stays as short as one night. 
Amenities typically include kitchen, washer and dryer, and separate bedrooms.
</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Caravanning, Campervan, Motorhome and RV </h3> 
<p>Caravan parks exist in most towns and cities in Australia that will provide 
powered and unpowered sites for Caravans. You will commonly see the Grey Nomad 
brigade on their trips around Australia in motorhomes and caravans.</p> 
<p>The <b>camper trailer</b> has also become very popular in Australia. It is 
perfect for the Australian camping lifestyle, whether it be weekends away or an 
extended trip into the great outdoors where no facilities exist. You will need 
to be self-sufficient and carry suitable spares and a good tool kit</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Station Wagons / Vans </h3> 
<p>In most parts of Australia it is illegal to sleep in your vehicle but it is 
possible to get around this by simply rigging up curtains all around the 
windows so no one can see in from the outside. Trade vans can be picked up for 
as little as $1,000, with a more trustworthy van setting you back no more than 
$3,000-$4,000. Add a mattress, pillow, portable gas cooker, cookware and a 20 
lt water container and you are off. If you get caught the fine could be as much 
as $150 each, so do it at you own risk. But if you are strategic in where you 
stay you probably won't get caught. Just be sensible and don't disturb the 
locals. Also, be aware of parking restrictions in certain parts of the cities 
and town, including overnight parking restrictions. The parking inspectors can 
be ruthless and a $100+ fine is not uncommon.</p> 
<p>All cities and towns in Australia have free public toilets. Many parks, and 
most beaches have free electric BBQ's as well. Popular beaches have fresh water 
showers to wash the salt water off after you swim, so for those on a tight 
budget (or for those that just love waking up at the beach) simply wash in the 
ocean (please do not pollute the ocean or waterways by using detergents or 
soaps) and rinse off at the showers. Almost all taps in Australia are drinking 
water, the ones that aren't will be marked. Service stations (petrol/gas) 
almost always have taps, so these are a good place to refill the water 
containers each time you refuel.</p> 
<p>Some of the best experiences you may have in Australia will be by taking 
that road on the map that looks like it heads to a beach, creek, waterfall or 
mountain and following it. You may just find paradise and not another soul in 
sight. And lucky you, you've got a bed, food and water right there with you.</p>
<p>Travelling in a small group lowers the fuel bill per head, as this will 
likely be your biggest expense.</p> 
<p>Enjoy, and respect the land by taking your rubbish/bottles/cigarette butts 
with you and disposing of them properly.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Work</h2> 
<p>Australian citizens, New Zealand citizens and permanent residents of 
Australia can work in Australia without any further permits, but others will 
require a work visa. All visitors who do not hold Australian permanent 
residency or citizenship (including New Zealand citizens who aren't also 
Australian permanent residents or citizens) are not allowed to access 
Australian social security arrangements for the unemployed, and will have 
limited, or more usually, no access to the Australian government's health care 
payment arrangements.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Payment and taxes</h3> 
<p>Most Australian employers pay via direct deposit to Australian bank 
accounts. Open a bank account as soon as you arrive. Your passport will not be 
enough ID to open a bank account. You will need to show the bank teller 100 
points of ID[44]. </p> 
<p>As soon as you have an address it is wise to apply for a <b>Tax File Number
</b> (TFN). You can apply for it online (though, only in Australia) for free at 
the Australian Tax Office website[45], though you can generally get it quicker 
if you just go to one of their offices. The Australian financial year runs from 
July 1 to June 30, and tax returns for each financial year are due on October 
30, four months after the accounting period concludes. Check with Australian 
tax agents about Australian tax liability and filing an Australian tax return.
</p> 
<p>Australian employers will make compulsory payments out of your earnings to 
an Australian superannuation (retirement savings) fund on your behalf. 
Temporary visitors who are<b>not</b> citizens of either Australia or New 
Zealand can have this money returned to them[46] when they leave Australia. </p>
<h3>[edit] Working holidaymaker scheme</h3> 
<p>Australia has a working holidaymaker program for citizens of certain 
countries between 18 and 30 years of age. It allows you to stay in Australia 
for 12 months from the time you first enter. You may work during that time, but 
only for 6 months at any one employer (was 3 months until July 2006). The idea 
is for you to take a holiday subsidised by casual or short-term jobs. If you're 
interested in a working holiday, some useful skills and experience might be: 
office skills to be used for temp work; or hospitality skills to be used for 
bar or restaurant work. An alternative is seasonal work like fruit-picking, 
although much seasonal work will require that you work outside the major 
cities. Working for 3 months in seasonal work will allow you to apply for a 
second 12 month visa.</p> 
<p>You can apply online for a <b>working holiday visa</b> [47], but you must 
<i>not</i> be in Australia at the time. It takes just a few hours to process 
usually and it costs about $170. On arriving in Australia ask for the working 
holiday visa to be &quot;evidenced&quot;, so you can show your future employer. 
A working holiday visa restricts you to contract type jobs. Don't waste your 
time applying for permanent jobs in the hope of sponsorship for a different 
visa class. Contract jobs generally mean employers are looking for solid 
experience, so make your resume reflect that. Search for jobs on<b>Seek</b> [48]
 or<b>Job Searcho</b> [49]. It is wise to try arranging a few interviews and 
prospects before you arrive in Australia in order to be in the better paid 
jobs. With any job, you will need to have the right to work in Australia prior 
to applying.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Sponsored work visas</h3> 
<p>The easiest way to get a work visa is to find an Australian employer who 
will sponsor you. However, this is just 'easier', not 'easy' as such. Your 
employer will need to demonstrate that they cannot hire anyone with your skills 
in Australia, and the approval will take several months. If in search of 
sponsorship, be prepared for a long wait. Note that getting the visa might take 
a couple of months from the beginning of the application process, and that you 
will need a medical examination by a doctor approved by the immigration 
officials before it can be granted (among other things, you will need a chest 
x-ray to show that you do not have tuberculosis). Check with your local 
Australian High Commission, Consulate or Embassy and the the Immigration 
Department's website[50]. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Immigration</h3> 
<p>You can apply to immigrate as a skilled person or business person, but this 
process will take longer than receiving a work visa. You can also apply for 
permanent residency as the holder of a work or study visa, but your application 
will not be automatically accepted. After four years of permanent residency you 
are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Volunteering</h3> 
<p>There are several volunteer opportunities in Australia. Many worldwide 
organisations offer extended travel for those wanting to volunteer their time 
to work with locals on projects such as habitat restoration, wildlife sanctuary 
maintenance &amp; development, scientific research, &amp; education programs.
</p>

<li> <b>World Wildlife Fund</b> (AU), [52]. </li> 
<li> <b>International Student Volunteers Australia</b>, [53]. </li> 
<li> <b>Youth Challenge Australia</b>, [54]. </li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Respect</h2> 
<p>Unless you are actively trying to insult someone, a traveller is unlikely 
to insult or cause offence to an Australian through any kind of cultural 
ignorance.</p> 
<p>Australian modes of address tend towards the familiar. It is acceptable and 
normal to use first names in all situations, even to people many years your 
senior. Many Australians are fond of using and giving nicknames - even to 
recent acquaintances. It is likely being called such a name is an indication 
that you are considered a friend and is it would be rare they are being 
condescending.</p> 
<p>It is generally acceptable to wear revealing clothing in Australia. Bikinis 
and swimming attire is okay on the beach, and usually at the kiosk across the 
road from the beach. It is normal to wear at least a shirt and footwear before 
venturing any further. Most beaches are effectively top optional (topless) 
while sunbathing. Just about all women wear a top while walking around or in 
the water. There are some clothing optional (nude) beaches, usually a little 
further removed from residential areas. Thong bikinis (more commonly called 
g-string bikinis in Australia as thongs refer to flip-flop footwear) are fine 
on all beaches and some outdoor pools for both women and men although they are 
not as common as conventional beachwear. Some outdoor pools have a &quot;top 
required&quot; policy for women.</p> 
<p>Cover up a little more when visiting places of worship such as churches. In 
warm conditions casual &quot;t-shirt and shorts&quot; style clothing 
predominates except in formal situations. Business attire, however, is 
considered to be long sleeved shirt, tie, and long trousers for men, even in 
the hottest weather.</p> 
<p>Using Australian stereotypical expressions may be viewed as an attempt to 
mock, rather than to communicate. If you pull it off well, you might raise a 
smile.</p> 
<p>Australians are often self-deprecating, and are rarely arrogant. However, 
it is rude to ever agree with a self-deprecating remark. Boasting about 
achievements is rarely received well.</p> 
<p>Most Australians are happy to help out a lost traveller with directions, 
however many urban dwellers will assume that someone asking &quot;Excuse 
me&quot;, is going to be asking for money, and may brush past. Looking lost, 
holding a map, looking like a backpacker or getting to the point quickly will 
probably help.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Indigenous Australians </h3> 
<p>It is best not to mention the name of a deceased person to an indigenous 
Australian. Though Aboriginal custom varies, it is best to avoid the 
possibility of offence.</p> 
<p>Permission to photograph an Aboriginal person should always be asked, but 
in particular in the more remote areas such as Arnhem Land. There is an old 
belief among them that the flash of a camera will steal their soul.</p> 
<p>Some areas of land are sacred to Aboriginal people, and require additional 
respect.</p> 
<p>Many areas of Aboriginal land are free to enter. Some areas carry a request 
from the Aboriginal people not to enter, and you may choose yourself whether or 
not to honour or respect that request. An example of an Aboriginal request is 
climbingUluru (Ayers Rock). No law prohibits people from climbing the rock 
(except in heat, rain or strong winds), however, local indigenous communities 
(The Anangu) request that you do not climb. Uluru holds great spiritual 
significance to the Anangu. The Anangu feel themselves responsible if someone 
is killed or injured on their land (as has happened many times during the 
climb) and request tourists not to place themselves in harm through climbing. 
Many people who travel to Uluru do climb, however, so you certainly won't be on 
your own if you choose to do this.</p> 
<p>Some Aboriginal land requires permission or a permit, and some areas are 
protected and illegal to enter. You should check before making plans to travel 
off the beaten track. Permits are usually just a formality for areas which 
regularly see visitors, or if you have some other business in the area you are 
travelling through. Often they are just an agreement to respect to the land you 
are travelling on as Aboriginal land. Some Aboriginal Land Councils make them 
available online.</p> 
<p>If you need to refer to race, the politically correct term is <i>Indigenous 
Australians</i>. <i>Aboriginal people</i> is usually okay and referring to 
sacred sites and land as Aboriginal sites, or Aboriginal land is okay too. 
Avoid using<i>Aborigine</i> or <i>Aboriginal</i> as a noun to describe a 
person, as some people see negative connotations in these words. The 
contraction &quot;Abo&quot; is deeply offensive and should never be used. The 
word<i>Native</i> should also be avoided when referring to a person. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Gay and lesbian travellers</h3> 
<p>Australia has an equal age of consent set at 16 for all states except 
Tasmania and South Australia where the age is 17. Queensland outlaws 'sodomy' 
for under 18s, but is generally supportive of homosexuality. A strong majority 
of the Australian public supports legalising same-sex marriage, however a 
Defence of Marriage-style law is in effect preventing such recognition for the 
time being. Nonetheless, Australia strives to offer official 'de facto 
relationship' recognition to gay couples that is equal to that offered to 
straight couples - a special Interdependency Visa exists as a gay counterpart 
to the traditional marriage-based migration route.</p> 
<p>Attitudes to homosexuality are similar to those found in the urban United 
States. While it's not uncommon to find a person who opposes gay rights, such 
people are in the minority. Violence against gay people is also at a level 
similar to the United States. While inner Sydney is one of the most 
gay-friendly places in the world, caution is advisable in rural areas, as well 
as in Queensland and the Northern Territory, the most conservative areas of the 
nation.</p> 
<p>Sydney is Australia's gay capital, and hosts one of the world's most famous 
gay pride parades - the Sydney Mardi Gras. Less known is the Alice Is 
Wonderland Festival - a popular gay and lesbian pride festival around central 
Alice Springs in late April/early May.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Stay safe</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Emergencies</h3> 
<p>The number <b>000</b> (called 'triple zero' or 'triple oh') can be dialled 
from any telephone in Australia free of charge. This number will connect you 
with emergency operators for the police, fire brigade, and ambulance service. 
The first question that the operator will ask is which service you need.</p> 
<p>If you require assistance during a flood, storm, cyclone, tsunami, 
earthquake or other natural disaster you can contact the State Emergency 
Service in each state (except for Northern Territory) on 132 500. You will be 
connected with your local unit and help can be organised from there. Note that 
if the emergency is life-threatening, call triple zero.</p> 
<p>If you want to contact these services but the situation is not an 
emergency, don't call 000: you can call the police assistance line on 131 444. 
Poisons information advice, which can also advise on snake, spider and insect 
bites, is available on 131 126. Information on locating the nearest medical 
services can be obtained by calling 1800 022 222 (except for Tasmania).</p> 
<p>You can dial 000 from all mobile phones. Mobile phones sold in Australia 
recognise it as the emergency number and will use any available network to 
place the call. However, if you have a phone obtained outside Australia, using 
the universal emergency number<b>112</b> is a better idea. Using 112 will use 
any available network, will work even if your phone is not roaming, and will 
work even if the phone does not have a SIM. 112 works from Australian purchased 
phones too.</p> 
<p>Hearing or speech impaired people with TTY equipment can dial <b>106</b>. 
Those with Internet connectivity can use the Internet Relay Service, via the 
website[55]. </p> 
<p>Calls from fixed line (landline) phones may be traced to assist the 
emergency services to reach you. The emergency services have limited ability to 
trace the origin of emergency calls from mobile phones, especially outside of 
urban areas, so be sure to calmly and clearly provide details of your location. 
Because of the number sequence for emergency calls, around 60% of calls to the 
emergency numbers are made in error.</p> 
<p>Nobody will likely respond to your call unless you can effectively 
communicate to the operator that you need assistance. If you are in need of 
assistance, but cannot speak, you will be diverted to an IVR and asked to press
<b>55</b> to confirm that you are in need of assistance and have not called by 
accident. Your call will then be connected to the police.</p> 
<p>Emergency numbers from other countries (for example, '911' in the USA) <b>
do not work</b> in Australia. '112' will not work from a landline phone. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Driving</h3> 
<p>Keep a sense of perspective. Tourists are far more likely to be killed or 
injured as pedestrians, drivers or passengers on Australian roads than all the 
other causes of death and injury combined.</p> 
<p>Driving between cities and towns can take longer than you think, especially 
if you are used to freeway or motorway driving in Europe or North America. 
Speed limits vary by location, road and by state. Avoid the stresses of fatigue 
by not planning to drive too far in a day.</p> 
<p>Driving between towns and cities comes with a risk of hitting or crashing 
due to swerving to avoid wildlife. Kangaroos have a habit of being spooked by 
cars and then, bewilderingly, jumping in front of them. Take extra care when 
driving through areas with vegetation close to the road and during dawn and 
dusk when wildlife is most active. Wildlife is not usually an issue in major 
urban areas (with the exception of Canberra where a series of parks provides 
ample habitat for kangaroos, which often cross major roads).</p> 
<p>Urban Australians jaywalk, dodge cars, and anticipate the sequence of 
lights. Although most drivers will stop for a red light, running the amber 
light is common, so ensuring the traffic has stopped before stepping from the 
curb is always a good idea. People from countries who drive on the right will 
take a while to get used to looking the correct way when crossing.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Beaches</h3> 
<p>Around 10-20 overseas travellers drown in Australia each year. Most of 
these drownings occur at ocean beaches, where statistics put visitors at 
significantly higher risk than locals. Check the Beach Safety website[56]. </p> 
<p>Beach goers should <b>swim between the red and yellow flags</b> which 
designate patrolled areas. Beaches are not patrolled 24-hours a day or even 
during all daylight hours. In most cases the local volunteer surf lifesavers or 
professional lifeguards are only available during certain hours, and at some 
beaches only on weekends, and often only during summer. If the flags aren't up, 
then there's no one patrolling - and you shouldn't swim. If you do choose to 
swim, be aware of the risks, check conditions, stay within your depth, and 
don't swim alone.</p> 
<p>Hard surfboards and other water craft such as surf skis, kayaks etc., are 
<b>not</b> permitted between the red and yellow flags. These craft must only be 
used outside of the blue 'surfcraft permitted' flags.</p> 
<p>Australian ocean beaches can sometimes have strong rips that even the 
strongest swimmers are unable to swim against. Rips are invisible channels of 
water flowing away from the beach. These channels take out the water which the 
incoming surf waves bring into shore. Beach goers can mistakenly use these 
channels or areas since they can appear as calm water and look to be an easier 
area into which to swim. Problems arise when the swimmer tries to swim back 
into shore against the outgoing current or rip, tire quickly, and end up 
drowning. Rips can be recognised by one or more of these signs: a rippled 
appearance when the surrounding water is fairly calm; foam that extends beyond 
the break zone; brown, sandy coloured water; waves breaking further out on 
either side of the rip.</p> 
<p>If you are caught in a rip at a patrolled beach, conserve your energy, 
float or tread water and raise one hand. The surf lifesavers will come out to 
you. Don't wait until you are so tired you can't swim any more. You will 
probably find that local swimmers or surfers will also quickly come to your 
aid. Usually the flags are positioned where there are no rips, but this isn't 
always the case as rips can move.</p> 
<p>If you are caught in a rip at an unpatrolled beach stay calm to conserve 
energy and swim<b>parallel</b> to the beach (not against the pull of the 
current). Most rips are only a few metres wide, and once clear of the undertow, 
you will be able to swim or catch a wave to return to shore. Never swim alone. 
Don't think that the right technique will get you out of every situation. In 
the surf out the back of the beach, treading water can be hard with waves 
pounding you every few seconds. Unless you have seen it happen, its hard to 
appreciate how quickly a rip can take you 50 m out to sea and into much larger 
wave breaks. If you are at an unpatrolled surf beach, proceed with great 
caution and never go out of your depth.</p> 
<p>Beach signs often have a number or an alphanumeric code on them. This code 
can be given to emergency services if required so they can locate you quickly.
</p> 
<p>Crocodiles and Box Jellyfish are found on tropical beaches, depending on 
the time of year and area. Sharks occur on many of Australia's beaches. See the 
section below on dangerous creatures. Patrolled beaches will be monitoring the 
ocean for any shark activity. If you hear a continuous siren, go off at the 
beach and a red and a red and white quartered flag is waved or held out of the 
tower as it indicates a shark sighting, so make your way to shore. Once it is 
clear, a short blast of the siren will be sounded, which usually means that it 
is safe to return to the water.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Natural disasters</h3> 
<h4>[edit] Cyclones</h4> 
<p>Tropical cyclones (hurricanes) occur in the tropics during summer. 
Information on and advanced warnings of severe weather is available from the 
Bureau of Meteorology&rsquo;s warning page[57] or by calling the National 
Telephone Weather Services Directory on 1900 926 113.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Floods</h4> 
<p>In the tropical north the <i>Wet Season</i> occurs over the summer months 
of December, January and February, bringing torrential rains and frequent 
floods to those regions. It is not unusual for some coastal areas to be cut off 
for a day or two while the water recedes. It can still be a good time to visit 
some of the well populated, tourist-oriented areas, and, except in unusually 
heavy flooding, you can still get to see the pounding waterfalls and other 
attractions that can make this an interesting time to visit.</p> 
<p>Floods in outback and inland Australia are rare, occurring decades apart, 
so you would be unlucky to encounter them. However, if you are planning to 
visit the inland or the outback and the area is flooded, then you should 
reconsider. The land is flat, so the water can take weeks to move on, leaving 
the land boggy. Insects and mosquitoes go crazy with all the fresh water 
pooling around, and these things eat insect repellent for breakfast and are 
still hungry. Roads close, often adding many hours to driving times. Many 
attractions often lie on a short stretch of dirt road off the main highways, 
and these sections become impassable, even if the main road remains open. Plan 
to return in a few weeks, and the land will still be green, the lakes and 
rivers will still be flowing, and the bird life will still be around.</p> 
<p>The wettest period for the south of the country is usually around the 
winter months of June, July, and August. There is rarely enough rain at one 
time to cause flooding. The capital cities are rarely, if ever, significantly 
affected by floods.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Fires</h4> 
<p>National parks and forested areas of southern Australia, including some 
parts of major cities next to national parks and forests, can be threatened by
<b>bushfires</b> (wildfires) in summer. </p> 
<p>If the fire risk is extreme, parks may be closed, especially the 
backcountry areas, so you will need to have an alternative plan if you intend 
to camp or hike in parks during summer. If there is a fire in a park, it will 
usually be closed entirely.</p> 
<p>Entire country towns can sometimes be evacuated when there is a bushfire 
threatening them. Often there can be no signs of the fire at evacuation time, 
but you should leave early, as evacuating through a fire front is dangerous. 
The best advice is just to move on, and not stay around to watch.</p> 
<p>Make sure any fires you light are legal and kept under control. The fire 
service operates a<b>fire ban</b> system during periods of extreme fire danger. 
When a fire ban is in place all outdoor fires are forbidden. Most parks will 
advertise a ban, and it is your responsibility to check the local fire danger 
levels. Fines or even gaol terms apply for lighting fires that get out of 
control, not to mention the feeling you may get at being responsible for the 
property, wildlife, and person damage that you may cause.</p> 
<p>If you are caught in a bushfire, most fires will pass over quickly. You 
need to find shelter that will protect you from the smoke and radiant heat. A 
house is best, then a car, then a clearing, a cave, or on the beach is the best 
location. Wet everything what you can. Stay low and cover your mouth. Cover 
yourself with non-flammable (woolen) clothing or blankets, and reduce the skin 
directly exposed to the heat. If you have access to a tap gather water early, 
don't rely on water pressure as the fire front approaches. If your holiday goes 
no further than cities, major towns, and beaches, this won't really concern you.
</p> 
<h4>[edit] Water supply</h4> 
<p>Australia is a very dry country with large areas of <b>desert</b>. It can 
also get hot. Some parts of the country are always in drought.</p> 
<p>When travelling in remote areas, away from sealed roads, where the 
potential to become stranded for up to a week without seeing another vehicle is 
very real, it is vital that you carry your own water supply (4 gal or 7 L per 
person per day). Do not be misled by entries on maps such as 'well' or 'spring' 
or 'tank' (or any entry suggesting that there is a body of water). Nearly all 
are dry, and most inland lakes are dry salt pans.</p> 
<p>Many cities and towns have water restrictions, limiting use of water in 
activities like washing cars, watering gardens, or public showers. It is common 
to see signs in accommodation asking visitors to limit the length of their 
showers.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Poisonous and dangerous creatures</h3> 
<p>Australia is home to many of the deadliest species of insects, reptiles and 
marine life on the planet. However the average tourist is unlikely to encounter 
any of these in an urban environment. The vast majority of deaths from bites 
and stings in Australia are due to allergic reactions to bees and wasps.</p> 
<p>Some of the information spread about Australia's dangerous wildlife is 
blown out of proportion. However, you should take warnings about jellyfish and 
crocodiles seriously in the tropics, and keep your distance from snakes in the 
national parks and bushland.</p> 
<p>If travelling in rural areas it would be a good idea to carry basic first 
aid equipment including compression bandages and to learn what to do after a 
snake or spider bite.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Snakes and spiders</h4> 
<p>Australia is home to six of the top ten deadliest snakes in the world. <b>
Never</b> try to pick up any snake, even if you believe it to be a 
non-poisonous species. Most people bitten by snakes were trying to pick up the 
snake, kill the creature, or inadvertently step on one whilst out walking. 
Snakes will generally try to put as much distance between themselves and you as 
possible, so if you see a snake while out walking, simply go around it or walk 
the other way. Walking blindly into dense bush and grassy areas is not 
advisable, as they are places where snakes may hide. For the most part, snakes 
fear humans and will be long gone before you ever get the chance to see them.
</p> 
<p>It is common to see spiders in Australia, and most will do you no harm. 
Wear gloves while gardening or handling leaf litter. Check or shake out 
clothing, shoes, etc that have been left outside before putting them on. Don't 
put your fingers under rocks, into tree holes, where spiders might be.</p> 
<p>The world's deadliest spider is the <b>Sydney Funnel Web spider</b>, found 
in and around Sydney and eastern New South Wales. Until the late 1970s a bite 
from this spider could result in death, but anti-venom is now available. The 
spider is anywhere up to 5 cm large, and is usually black. If you are in an 
area that is known for having Funnel Web spiders and you are bitten by a spider 
that you believe could be a Funnel Web it is important you get to hospital as 
quickly as possible. Funnel Webs can seek shelter indoors when there is a lot 
of rain, however they are usually found under rocks, especially if recent 
gardening has taken place.</p> 
<p>The <b>Red Back spider</b> (usually easily identified by a red mark on its 
abdomen), is common and after a bite it is important to seek medical attention, 
however it is not as urgent as with a Funnel Web. Red Backs typically hide in 
dark places and corners. It is highly unusual to see them indoors, however they 
can hide in sheds, around outdoor tables and chairs and under rocks or other 
objects sitting on the ground.</p> 
<p>Anti-venom is available for most spider and snake bites. If bitten you 
should immobilise the wound (by wrapping the affected area tightly with strips 
of clothing or bandages) and seek immediate medical help. Do not clean the 
wound as hospitals can test venom residues to determine what species anti-venom 
should be used. If you are in an isolated area send someone else for help. The 
venom of some snakes (the taipan in particular) can take effect within fifteen 
minutes, but if the wound is immediately immobilised and you rest it is 
possible to delay the onset of poisoning by one to a few hours, depending on 
the creature. If possible, you should attempt to identify the creature that bit 
you (in the case of spiders it might be possible to trap it in a jar and take 
it to the hospital) so that the appropriate anti-venom can be administered 
swiftly.</p> 
<p>First aid treatment for spider bites may vary in Australia compared to 
other areas of the world. Always seek medical advice after a bite has occurred.
</p> 
<h4>[edit] Jellyfish</h4> 
<p>Travellers in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory, or northern 
Western Australia should be aware of the risk of fatal stings from the <b>Box 
Jellyfish</b> if swimming in the ocean between October and May. They are very 
hard to detect and can be found in very shallow water. Stings from these 
jellyfish are 'excruciating' and often fatal. Vinegar applied immediately to 
adhering tentacles will lessen the amount of venom injected, but immediate 
medical assistance will be required. The danger season varies by location. In 
general the jellyfish are found close to shore, as they breed in the estuaries. 
They are not generally found out on the Great Barrier Reef, and many people 
swim on the reef without taking any precautions. Seek out reliable local 
information. Some locals at the beach can be cavalier to the risks.</p> 
<p><b>Irukandji</b> are another species of tiny (fingernail sized) jellyfish 
that inhabit the waters off Northern Australia and the surrounding Indo-Pacific 
islands. They are also very hard to see, and can be dangerous, although bites 
are rare. Unlike the box jellyfish they are found out on the reef. The initial 
bite can go unnoticed. There is debate as to whether they can be fatal, but 
they certainly can place a victim in hospital, and cause extreme pain lasting 
days. If you have nausea or shooting pains not long after emerging from the 
water seek medical treatment.</p> 
<p>A &quot;stinger-suit&quot; that is resistant to jellyfish stings costs 
around $100 or can be hired for around $20 a week.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Blue ring octopus</h4> 
<p>Found in rock pools around the coasts of Australia is the tiny Blue Ring 
Octopus. Usually a dull sandy-beige colour, the creature has bright blue 
circles on its skin if threatened. The Blue Ring Octopus is rare and shy. Avoid 
placing your hand under rocks or in crevaces in rock pools or near the shore as 
this is where they tend to hide. Most locals do the same. It has a powerful 
paralysing toxin which can result in death unless artificial respiration is 
provided. In the history of Australia there are only two confirmed deaths by 
Blue Ring Octopus.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Crocodiles</h4> 
<p>Travellers in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory or north Western 
Australia should be aware of the risk of fatal attacks by<b>saltwater crocodiles
</b> in and adjacent to northern waters (ocean, estuarine and fresh water 
locations) between King Sound, Western Australia, and Rockhampton, Queensland. 
Saltwater crocodiles in these areas can reach 25 feet in length and can attack 
in water without warning. Despite what their name implies, they can be found in 
both salt and fresh water. On land, crocodiles usually lie motionless, but they 
have the ability to move with extraordinary speed in short bursts. There are 
relatively few attacks resulting in injury &mdash; most attacks are fatal. 
Dangerous swimming areas will usually have prominent warning signs. In these 
regions only swim in inland waters if you are specifically advised that they 
are safe. Since 1970 there has been about one crocodile attack on a human each 
year.</p> 
<p>The smaller <b>freshwater crocodile</b> is, unlike the saltwater, timid and 
will avoid humans if possible. The freshwater may attack to defend itself or 
its eggs or if startled. They can inflict a nasty bite but due to their small 
jaws and teeth this will rarely cause death in humans.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Dangerous flora</h4> 
<p><b>The Gympie bush</b> (<i>Dendrocnide moroides</i>), also known as the 
stinging tree, is a stinging plant, whose microscopic stinging hairs on leaves 
and branches can cause severe pain for up to several weeks. They are mostly 
found in North-east Queensland, especially in rain forest clearings. However, 
the Gympie bush and other closely related species (there are about five) of 
stinging tree can be found in south-east Queensland, and further south in 
eastern Australia. People bushwalking in such areas are advised not to touch 
the plant for any reason.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Crime</h3> 
<p>Crime rates in Australia are roughly comparable with other first world 
countries: few travellers will be victims of crime. You should take normal 
precautions against bag snatching, pick pocketing and the like. There are some 
areas of the large cities that are more dangerous after dark, but there 
generally are no areas that the police refuse to patrol or that are dangerous 
to enter if you aren't a local.</p> 
<p>Australian police are approachable and trustworthy, and you should report 
assaults, theft or other crime to the police as soon as possible. Under no 
circumstances should you offer an Australian police officer (or for that 
matter, any other government official such as a customs officer) a bribe or 
gratuity, as this is a crime and they will enforce the laws against it.</p> 
<p>When leaving your car alone, make sure it is locked, that the windows are 
rolled up, and that there are no obvious targets for theft in the vehicle, as 
thieves will often smash windows to get at a phone, GPS or bag that is visible 
in the car.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Racism</h4> 
<p>Racism is a sensitive subject in Australia. There are laws against any form 
of racial vilification or discrimination with jail terms possible for breaches 
of some states racial vilification laws. It isn't hard to find someone who will 
express some form of racist views in a pub in Australia. It is much rarer to 
find someone who will openly express aggression towards any racial group. 
Australia is outwardly a multicultural and racially tolerant society.</p> 
<p>Some language used for ethnic groups that you may find offensive may not be 
considered offensive by the standards of some Australians. Terms such as Yank 
and Pom, and to a lesser extent Wog are used in casual conversation in the 
presence of those respective nationalities, often between friends, and as such 
are not seen as offensive. However, tread carefully before using slang racial 
descriptors yourself, to avoid the possibility of offence. Some will choose a 
racial abuse term if involved in an argument, over a more general abusive term.
</p> 
<p>It is not offensive to use <i>Aussie</i> (Ozzie) to describe Australian 
people, but it isn't a term Australians generally use to self-identify. They 
are more likely to apply it to things (Aussie Rules, etc) than to themselves. 
When the chant of Aussie, Aussie, Aussie - Oi Oi Oi goes up at an international 
sporting event, some Australians will cringe, and others will join in. Often 
this depends on their own perceived social standing, or their state of 
inebriation, or both. In parts of Australia that are racially fractured, Aussie 
and Australian can both be used as a divisive terms to identify racial 
heritage. Ensure that you use the terms Aussie and Australian inclusive of 
Australians of all racial heritage.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Scams</h3> 
<p>Attempts to scam tourists are not prevalent in Australia; take normal 
precautions such as finding out a little bit about your destination. There have 
been instances of criminals tampering with ATMs so that cash is trapped inside 
them, or so that they record card details for thieves. You should check your 
transaction records for odd transactions after using an ATMs and immediately 
contact the bank controlling the ATM if a transaction seems to be successful 
but the machine doesn't give you any cash. Always cover the keypad with your 
hand when entering your PIN to prevent any skimming devices which have cameras 
recording your PIN.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Illegal drugs</h3> 
<p>Opium, heroin, amphetamines (speed), cocaine, LSD, ecstasy, marijuana and 
hashish among other drugs are all illegal both to possess and to sell in all 
states of Australia. Trafficking offences are federal offences, and carry a 
long jail term. Australia shares information on drug trafficking with other 
countries, even those with the death penalty.</p> 
<p>Penalties for possession or sale of small amounts of marijuana are 
typically lower than for other drugs, and vary between states. In South 
Australia, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern 
Territory jail terms do not apply to first time marijuana offences. Some states 
can issue on-the-spot fines for small amounts of marijuana whereas others 
always require a court appearance. Foreigners should not expect more lenient 
treatment than locals from Australian police for drug offences.</p> 
<p>Australia's proximity to Asia means that heroin is a far more commonly used 
illicit drug than cocaine or crack cocaine. In some areas of large cities you 
will need to be careful of discarded needles: however these will generally be 
found in back streets rather than in popular tourist spots.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Stay healthy</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Skin</h3> 
<p>Exposure to the sun at Australian latitudes frequently results in sunburn. 
Getting sunburnt can make you feel feverish and unwell and may take a few days 
or weeks to heal depending on the severity. It means you can't go back out into 
the sun until the sunburn fades, so getting sunburnt on the first day of your 
beach holiday can seriously reduce the fun of your trip. It can take as little 
as 15 minutes to burn in Australia on a fine summer's day. You should wear 
sunscreen (SPF 30+), clothing, and a hat to shade the sun.</p> 
<p>Reapply sunscreen every 2-3 hours throughout the day as it wears off 
quickly if you are sweating or swimming. Make sure to cover all parts of your 
body. UV radiation in the middle of the day can be double what it is in the 
early morning or later afternoon, so if possible avoid the sun during the 
hottest part of the day. Daily UV forecasts are issued by the Bureau of 
Meteorology and are available online.[58] </p> 
<p>If you are heading to the beach, consider buying a sun-tent (less than $20 
from discount and hardware stores). You can't hire beach umbrellas at 
Australian beaches, and they are very exposed.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Food Preparation</h3> 
<p>Australia's cleanliness standards are high. Restaurants are required to 
observe strict food preparation standards andfood poisoning is no more common 
than it is in other first world nations.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Water</h3> 
<p>The tap water in Australia is almost always safe to drink, and it will be 
marked on the tap if this is not the case. The taste and hardness of the tap 
water will vary considerably across the country. Bottled water is also widely 
available. Carrying water on hot days is a good idea in urban areas, and it is 
a necessity if hiking or driving out of town. At sites where tap water is 
untreated, water sterilization tablets may be used as an alternative to boiling.
</p> 
<h3>[edit] Vaccinations</h3> 
<p>Australia does not have endemic communicable diseases that will require 
non-standard vaccinations. Like many other countries, it will require evidence 
ofyellow fever vaccinations on entry if you will have been in a country with a 
risk of infection within 6 days before your arrival in Australia.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Mosquitoes</h3> 
<p>Mosquitoes are present all year round in the tropics, and during the summer 
in southern areas. Screens on windows and doors are common, and repellent is 
readily available. Ross River Virus is spread by mosquitoes in the tropics, and 
can make you sick for a few weeks. There have been cases ofdengue fever. 
Malaria is not present in Australia.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Medical care</h3> 
<p>As described above, <b>000</b> is the Australian emergency services number 
and in any medical emergency you should call this number and ask for an 
ambulance and other emergency services as necessary, to attend.</p> 
<p>Australia has first world medical standards. In particular, it is safe to 
receive blood transfusions in Australia, as donors are screened for HIV, 
hepatitis and many other blood borne illnesses.</p> 
<p>However, since Australia's population density is low, parts of Australia 
are a long way from medical facilities of any kind. Towns with populations of 
5,000 or more will have a small hospital capable of giving emergency treatment 
in serious emergencies, and larger towns will have a base hospital capable of 
routine and some kinds of emergency surgery. In severe cases, particularly any 
kind of injury requiring microsurgery, you will need to be evacuated to one of 
the capital cities for treatment. Evacuation procedures are well established 
and normally involve being evacuated by plane or helicopter. For this reason 
travel insurance or ambulance membership is highly recommended for those 
travelling to remote areas as helicopter evacuation could cost thousands.</p> 
<p>Capital cities will have medical centres where you can drop in, often open 
on weekends or until late. In country towns you may have to make an 
appointment, and may have no alternative other than the closest hospital after 
hours and weekends. You can also expect to wait a few hours if your condition 
isn't urgent.</p> 
<p>Australian citizens and permanent residents who live in the country can 
receive health care through the taxpayer funded Medicare.</p> 
<p>Travellers from New Zealand, Ireland, United Kingdom, Sweden, the 
Netherlands, Finland, Italy, Malta and Norway are entitled to free reciprocal 
Medicare treatment for medical problems that occur during their visit, but 
should familiarise themselves with the conditions of the reciprocal 
arrangement. For example Irish and New Zealanders are only entitled to free 
treatment at a hospital, whereas the other reciprocal nationalities are 
entitled to subsidised treatment at general practitioners as well. No 
reciprocal programs cover private hospitals, and the full cost will have to be 
met. Considertravel insurance. If not a citizen or permanent resident of a 
reciprocal country, you can expect to pay around $60 to see a general 
practitioner, plus any additional costs for any pathology or radiology 
required. The charge to pay to visit a local hospital can be much more 
expensive, private hospitals even more so, up to $500 even if you are not 
admitted, and thousands if you are.</p>

medication or poisons is taken inadvertently. Will also give advice on what 
treatment is necessary for things like a spider bite.</li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Contact</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Internet</h3> 
<p>Australia offers many Internet access options for travellers. Be aware that 
many internet companies cap usage, finding an unlocked Wi-Fi connection is 
uncommon.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Terminals </h4> 
<p><b>Internet caf&eacute;s</b> abound in most centres of population that 
normally cost $4-$5 per hour. Many internet caf&eacute;s have 12-20 computers 
sharing a single broadband connection, sometimes making the internet painfully 
slow. If possible ask if you can check the speed of a caf&eacute;'s connection 
before forking out $4-$5 for an hour.</p> 
<p><b>Public libraries</b> usually offer some for of Internet access to 
travellers, either free or for a small fee. Some restrict access to email, 
promoting research use of their facilities. Others offer Wi-Fi as well as 
terminals, with Wi-Fi usually being free of restrictions.</p> 
<p><b>Major hotels</b> offer Internet access, usually for a fee. It is still 
unusual to find in-room Internet access in smaller hotels and in motels. Most 
youth hostels and backpacker accommodation have at least an Internet terminal 
at reception.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Wi-Fi </h4> 
<ul> 
<li> Many <b>coffee shops</b> offer Wi-Fi free to their customers. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> McDonalds has free Wi-Fi in just about all their stores. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Internode [59] has free Wi-Fi hotspots, including much of Adelaide city 
centre.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Unwired [60] has a similar service. </li> </ul> 
<p>Some accommodation providers offer Wi-Fi to their guests, almost always 
with a charge.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  3G Wireless </h4> 
<p>GPRS and 3G wireless Internet connections are available through all 
cellular phone networks. Australia has cellular networks operated by Telstra[61]
, Optus[62] and Vodafone [63], and each of the networks have several resellers 
with different price plans.</p> 
<p>If you have a 3G/UMTS-enabled phone, make sure it supports the appropriate 
frequencies: 850/2100 MHz for Telstra, and 900/2100 MHz for Optus and Vodafone. 
Also check with your home carrier for data roaming fees (likely quite 
expensive).</p> 
<p>Several carriers offer prepaid 3G access with no contract from around $30 
per month with various bundles and inclusions. For around $50 you can get a USB 
modem or WiFi dongle. Virginmobile offers currently the cheapest prepaid card 
with 1 GB data for 19 dollar (Your Caps option).[64] </p> 
<p>There are no restrictions on overseas residents getting an Australian 
prepaid SIM card. In fact, it is extremely easy to go into Woolworths/Safeway 
(Australia's largest grocery chain) and buy a $2 SIM card over the counter 
(though no calls are included). Take your passport for identification in case 
it is required.</p> 
<h4>[edit]  Dialup </h4> 
<p>There are many small but reliable ISPs offering dialup Internet the 
$12&ndash;$15 per month flat rate range.</p> 
<p>There are also several ISPs who have a pre-paid arrangement at about $1 per 
hour of use. It can be surprisingly difficult to find Australian dialup ISPs 
with instant online signup, but they do exist (Beagle[65] is one). </p> 
<p>You can buy prepaid dialup cards for several ISP's from Dick Smith stores, 
for around $20 per month unlimited. In the cities, many small business mobile 
phone shops sell a large range of prepaid phone cards, including prepaid 
dial-up cards. The ISPs Dodo[66] and Planet [67] for example have prepaid 
internet cards available for around $10 a month from a variety of retail 
outlets.</p> 
<p>If moving around, check that your ISP has an access number that can be 
reached via a local call from landlines nationwide (the access number starts 
with 019 or 13), rather than just in the ISP home city. All prepaid cards that 
can be purchased from Dick Smith have access from anywhere in Australia for a 
local call fee.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Telephone</h3> 
<h4>[edit] Dialing Codes</h4> 
<p>The country code for international calls to Australia is +61. When dialing 
from overseas, omit any leading '0' in the area code.</p> 
<p>For example, the local number for the Broken Hill tourist information is 
8080 3300. The area code is 08 as Broken Hill is in the Central &amp; West area 
code region. To dial the number fromAdelaide or anywhere else <i>inside</i> the 
same area code region you can optionally omit the area code, and just dial 8080 
3300. To dial the number fromSydney or anywhere in Australia <i>outside</i> the 
area code region, you will need to dial 08 8080 3300. If you don't know your 
area code region, you can still dial the area code, and it will still work. To 
dial the number from overseas you will need to dial your local international 
access code (00 for most ofEurope or 011 in the USA and Canada) and then dial 
61 8 8080 3300, that is drop the leading '0' from the area code.</p> 
<p>There can be many ways of writing the same number, as people try to present 
the number from the caller's perspective.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> +61 8 8080 3300 </li> 
<li> +61880803300 </li> 
<li> +61 (0)8 8080 3300, </li> 
<li> (61 8) 8080 3300, </li> 
<li> (08) 8080 3300, </li> 
<li> 61 8 8080 3300 </li> 
<li> 8080 3300 </li> </ul> 
<p>are all the same number, and the same rules apply. If you are dialing 
within Australia the area code must begin with a '0'. If you are dialing 
internationally, there is no leading '0'.</p> 
<p><b>Australian Area Code List</b>: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> 02 = Central East (New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and 
north-eastern fringe of Victoria)</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 03 = South East (Southern NSW, Victoria and Tasmania) </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 04 = Mobile phones Australia-wide (higher call charges apply). </li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li> 07 = North East (Queensland) </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> 08 = Central &amp; West (Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern 
Territory and far Western New South Wales)</li> </ul> 
<p>The outgoing international dialing access code (from within Australia) is 
0011 (note, &quot;00&quot; and &quot;011&quot;, common elsewhere in the world, 
will not work in Australia).</p> 
<p>Local calls are about AUD$0.25 on most fixed lines and AUD$0.50 on all 
Telstra Pay Phones.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If calling an Australian number from a mobile phone outside Australia it 
is best to use the format +61880803300 with no<i>spaces</i> and no (0) <i>
prefixes</i> included. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If making an international call from your mobile phone from within 
Australia use the '+' followed by the<i>country code</i>, followed by 
destination<i>area code</i>, followed by the <i>local number</i> at the 
destination. Omit all leading '0'<i>prefixes</i> and do not include any <i>
spaces</i>. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If dialling from a mobile telephone in Australia it is not necesssary to 
use an<i>international dialling</i> prefix (such as 0011). The '+' symbol 
followed by the destination country code is all that is needed to access the 
international telephone system from your handset.</li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit] Special Numbers</h4> 
<ul> 
<li> Numbers commencing with <b>13</b> are charged at a local call rate, and 
what they connect you to can vary according to your location. They can be 10 or 
6 digit numbers. For example 1300 796 222, will connect you with theAlbury 
tourist information, no matter where you are in Australia. However, 131 008 
will connect you with a different local taxi service depending on where you 
are. 13 22 32 will connect you to New South Wales Railways in Sydney or 
Victorian Railways in Melbourne. Calling these numbers internationally can be 
problematic.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Numbers commencing with <b>18</b> are free when dialed from a payphone or 
fixed phone, and commonly used for hotel reservation numbers, or tourist 
information numbers.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Numbers commencing with <b>19</b> are premium numbers, often with <i>very
</i> hefty call charges (make sure you check before dialing). </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Numbers commencing with <b>12</b> are carrier services, and are dependent 
on what network you are connected to. For example<b>12 456</b> is a general 
information number for Telstra. Vodafone offer a similar services on<b>123</b>. 
These numbers can be premium services as well.</li> </ul> 
<p>Calling special numbers internationally can often work - just try dialing 
the number prefixed with the +61 country code. Many locations will give an 
alternative direct number for use in international dialing. You can use the 
non-geographical number search on e164.org.au[68] to look up a normal number 
from a<b>13</b> or <b>18</b> number. </p> 
<p>You may make reverse charge calls by using the number 1800 REVERSE (1800 
7383773).</p> 
<h4>[edit] Mobile Cellular Phones</h4> 
<p>Australia has three nationwide cellular (mobile) phone networks based on 
the GSM standard (900 and 1800mhz) operated by Telstra[69], Optus [70] and 
Vodafone[71]. There are also four UMTS networks, two of which are nationwide. 
One is operated by Telstra (UMTS 850mhz, also marketed by Telstra as Next G) 
and the other by Optus (a combination of UMTS 2100mhz and 900mhz). The other 
two networks are limited to capital cities, are on the 2100mhz band and are 
operated by Vodafone and Three[72]. Vodafone have announced a nationwide 3G 
(UMTS) rollout on the 900mhz band.</p> 
<p>For those holding foreign SIM cards, international roaming is generally 
seamless onto Australia's GSM 900/1800 and 3G (UMTS/W-CDMA) networks, subject 
to agreements between operators. Check with your home operator before you leave 
to be sure.</p> 
<p>All carriers offer service in major cities, large towns, and major highways 
on the East Coast. No carriers offer service in unpopulated areas away from 
major roads. Telstra's 850mhz 3G network provides wider coverage in smaller 
towns and lightly populated areas.</p> 
<p>Web address for coverage maps are linked below: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Telstra [73] </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Optus [74] </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Vodafone [75] </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Three [76] </li> </ul> 
<p>You can buy a cheap prepaid mobile phone in Australia with a SIM for around 
$40 in most retail outlets, supermarkets, and post offices, or a SIM for your 
existing phone at around $2-$3. You can then top it up with credit using 
recharge cards you can purchase at all supermarkets, newsagents, some ATMs, and 
other outlets.</p> 
<p>Prepaid calls cost roughly 60c per minute plus 30c flagfall, again 
depending on the network. SMS is generally 25c. You can buy a seemly infinite 
variety or packages, caps and bundles, with combinations of data, sms, call 
time, and SIM cards. Read the fine print, and as a rule, the more 
&quot;value&quot; that is included in your &quot;package&quot; or 
&quot;cap&quot;, the more expensive the elements of the package are. For 
example call charges can rise from 60c to $1.20 per minute on a $29 cap that 
includes $150 value. All is fine if you stay within the minutes allowed for the 
cap you choose, but it can cost a fortune very quickly if you exceed what you 
thought you would use.</p> 
<p>There are no restrictions on overseas residents getting a Australian 
prepaid SIM card. Take your passport for identification in case it is required.
</p> 
<h3>[edit]  Satellite phones </h3> 
<p>If you need comprehensive coverage in rural and remote areas, you can use a 
satellite phone. Iridium, Globalstar and Thuraya satellite services are 
available in Australia. Expect to pay around $120 per week to hire a satellite 
phone, plus call costs. Satellite messaging units, which send your location and 
a help SMS or email, that can be hired for around $80 per week.</p> 
<p>These units are only available from specialist dealers, often only in major 
cities (away from the remote areas you may be visiting). You should be able to 
acquire or hire these units in your home country before departure if you wish.
</p> 
<h4>[edit]  SMS </h4> 
<p>Text messages can be sent from many public phones, using the keypad in much 
the same way as a mobile phone. Follow the instructions on the phone display.
</p> 
<h3>[edit] Post</h3> 
<p>Australia Post [77] runs Australia's postal service. Letters can be posted 
in any red Australia Post posting box, which are found at all post offices and 
many other locations. All stamps can be purchased from post offices, and some 
stamps can be purchased from newsagents and hotels. Posting a standard letter 
costs $0.60 within Australia (up to 250g), or $1.40 for the rest of the world 
(up to 20g only). 'Domestic' and 'international' stamps are different, as 
international is tax free, therefore, so make sure you use the right stamp. 
Parcels, express post and other services are also available.</p> 
<p>You can receive mail via Poste Restante in any city or town. Mail should be 
addressed to your full name c/o Post Restante, and you simply call into the 
post office with ID to receive your mail.</p>
