<h1>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</h1> April 26th, 2010 by Jason Yapp 
<p>Roma Numberplate</p> 
<p>Like many other families we found our Easter holiday break involuntarily 
extended due to the closure of UK airspace at the end of last week. Having had 
a terrific week in Rome (more of which at a later date) we were enjoying dinner 
in a restaurant with friends on Thursday evening (which we believed to be our 
last night abroad) when we received the news that a volcano had erupted in 
Iceland. We naively laughed off the idea that this might in any way interfere 
with our travel plans.</p> 
<p>The following morning as we were due to leave for Rome Ciampino airport we 
discovered that our flight had been cancelled. After some frantic searching 
on-line we eventually managed to re-book 4 flights for the following Monday. 
Making the most of this setback we headed south down the coast to Sperlonga 
where we enjoyed a terrific weekend on an empty beach before heading back into 
Rome for our second &lsquo;final night&rsquo; of the holiday. It was only on 
the train back to Rome that we found out Monday&rsquo;s flight had been 
cancelled, as had the following day&rsquo;s and the days after that.</p> 
<p>The situation was beginning to look serious so we earnestly began to 
explore other routes home &ndash; via Corsica by ferry? by train? via France by 
plane? Unsurprisingly we had little joy in getting any train or plane bookings 
but through a friend of a friend pulling strings we did manage to locate what 
was possibly the last hire car available in the Eternal City. After a breakneck 
trip across town on the back of our friend Maura&rsquo;s motorbike I reached an 
Avis rental office and never has a battered old Lancia looked more attractive. 
For a pretty reasonable 180 euros I collected the keys and a SatNav and then 
had the baptism of fire that is driving in Rome. I picked Pippa and our boys 
(Alfred 11 and William up in San Lorenzo and we hit the autostrada. Fortunately 
Pippa had had the presence to pack a picnic so we were able to belt north 
unrelentingly before an enforced overnight pit-stop in San Remo. We 
weren&rsquo;t allowed to leave Italy with the hire car and San Remo is the most 
northerly outpost of Avis in the country but the office had closed for the 
evening by the time we arrived.</p> 
<p>After a fretful night in the appalling Hotel Eveline (too bad to go in to 
detail) we dropped the Lancia off at 8.30am sharp and got a taxi across the 
border to Nice airport. The only car available here was a Peugot 207 for which 
we were fleeced an outrageous 900 euros by Hertz (at least Dick Turpin wore a 
mask). We then headed west then north across the autoroutes of France with 
minimal stops at service stations. At 9pm that night we checked into the 
reassuringly old-fashioned H&ocirc;tel de la Banni&egrave;re in Laon, just 
north of Champagne.</p> 
<p>Queues at Calais</p> 
<p>We were up and running (<em>sans</em> breakfast) at 6am to honour our 9am 
car rental return at Calais Sea Port. On arrival our hearts sank as the scenes 
before us looked like something from a disaster movie. Files of coaches were 
backed up onto the autoroute slip road, hire cars were abandoned 
indiscriminately and files of foot passengers were being herded into queues. 
Happily the evacuation operation was being well run and within 2 hours we were 
on board the &lsquo;Pride of Dover&rsquo; heading back to Blighty at a not 
unreasonable 195 euros all in.</p> 
<p>By lunchtime we had docked at Dover and after a ridiculous schlep on foot 
across town to Dover Priory station we caught a high speed train to London 
Saint Pancras. After that it was a relative doddle with a tube to Paddington, 
train to Westbury and taxi home to Frome, Somerset. I then had the unenviable 
task of heading out to Bristol airport to pick up my long abandoned car. Seldom 
has it felt better to eat at our own table and sleep in our own beds but it was 
a Herculean effort to drag ourselves out of bed to get to school and work on 
Thursday morning. There&rsquo;s nothing like travel to make you appreciate 
getting home and when a neighbour asked the boys if they&rsquo;d had a good 
holiday they replied &lsquo;yes great thanks&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>We will send a bottle of Yapp Champagne to the reader with what we judge to 
be the most arduous return voyage as a result of the Icelandic volcanic 
eruption and disruption.</p>
