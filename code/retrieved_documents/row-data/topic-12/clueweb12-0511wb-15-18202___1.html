<h1>The Golf Club at Thornapple Pointe: Planes, Trains and Automobiles</h1> 
<br> <br>

<p>By Kiel Christianson, Senior Writer</p> 
<p> Grand Rapids, MI - Step onto the turf at The Golf Club at Thornapple 
Pointe in Grand Rapids, and you are bound to run into all breeds of 
high-powered professionals--doctors, lawyers, company execs--who have ducked 
out of the office to play hooky (i.e., golf).</p> 
<p> Of the several quality courses in the Grand Rapids area, Thornapple Pointe 
is perhaps the most centrally located and easily accessible. In fact, this 
wooded, watery track can be reached via just about any mode of transportation 
you can imagine, be it by plane, train, or automobile.</p> 
<p> For those players who demand quiet seclusion in their courses, however, 
the easy accessibility of Thornapple Pointe comes with a price. Specifically, 
the course's location next to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport results 
in dozens of up close and personal encounters throughout a round with the 
underbellies of aircraft.</p> 
<p> The railroad tracks running along several holes are heavily trafficked by 
freight trains. And I-96 is at certain points little farther than a Woodsian 
drive away. Oh, and on nice days the odd jetski may buzz past just as you are 
stroking that eagle putt.</p> 
<p>  This said, if you are one of those aforementioned go-getters who derives 
energy from commotion, who uses potential distraction to help focus your mind, 
this course is perfect for you. (Or maybe you're just an aeronautics buff who 
likes to watch planes at they approach and take off.)</p> 
<p> And, truth be told, the challenging and well-designed links here occupy 
land that would not be good for anything other than a golf course: No one would 
want to live or work in a flight path like this.</p> 
<p> As a golf course, however, the land is well suited. At 6,821 yards from 
the tips, this par-72 Bill Newcomb layout has a nice balance of long par 4s 
(ranging from 387 to 453 yards) and short ones (320 to 368 yards). Likewise, 
the par 5s range from the reachable 487-yard 7th to the daunting 613-yard 5th.
</p> 
<p> No. 5 is easily one of the best (and hardest) holes on the course. It 
rolls through a shallow valley with fescue-covered mounds on the left and a 
side channel of the Thornapple River on the right. Contrasting with most of the 
fairways, this one is narrow at the landing area, but at least there's a pretty 
view as you're dropping a ball to hit your second shot (okay, third--sheesh!).
</p> 
<p> Another highlight is the 551-yard, par-5 13th. The river runs from tee to 
green on the left, so it's a very bad place to suddenly develop a pull hook 
(trust me). The fairway narrows into a tight neck up to the green, but a couple 
of good shots can leave you with a putt for birdie or a short chip for eagle. 
If not for the proximity of the freeway across the river, this hole would be 
downright idyllic.</p> 
<p> The collection of par 3s isn't particularly memorable, but there is a fine 
variety of looks off the tee, from blind ones (e.g., Nos. 1 &amp; 2) to open 
ones (e.g., Nos. 10 &amp; 11), to carries over wetlands (e.g., Nos. 7, 14, 17, 
and 18). The fairways and greens are generous enough, but if you happen to be 
hitting them crooked when you play here, you will burn through a good number of 
balls.</p> 
<p> Amenities are plentiful, with a three-tiered driving range, Clubhouse 
Grille and halfway house, well-stocked pro shop, and satellite yardage system 
on each cart (from which you can also order lunch). However, when we were there 
the satellite system was not operating reliably due to a lightning strike the 
week before. Worse yet, alternative yardage markers were somewhat hard to find.
</p> 
<p>  This constant source of irritation was compounded by the uncanny timing 
of the airplanes. Each time a yardage needed to be communicated from farther 
than ten yards away, a plane would roar overhead and drown out the message. 
Lots and lots of poor club choices make for a long day.</p> 
<p> The overall layout of the course is appealing--tough but fair--although a 
little confusing. Be sure to follow the signs (which could stand to be larger). 
The greens are firm yet receptive, however several were quite seriously scarred 
with poorly repaired ball marks. Lush bent grass runs from tee to green, and 
the bunkering is understated (read: even a lousy golf writer can stay out of 
most of them).</p> 
<p> Although the course has already racked up some impressive events--for 
example the 1997-8 qualifying rounds for the Senior Tour First of America 
Classic--the rates, which range from $40 before 11 a.m. on weekdays to $60 
during peak times on weekends, seem a bit high.</p> 
<p> However, if you're one of those well-paid execs taking the afternoon off, 
you probably won't care how much you have to pay as long as you can get some 
golf in over a long lunch.</p> 
<p> Personally, I enjoyed communing with the spirit of the late John Candy, 
incarnated as his character from the movie &quot;Planes, Trains, and 
Automobiles.&quot;</p> 
<p> Each time a jet shattered my concentration on the tee, or a train vibrated 
my ball off line, or a car horn honked, I heard John chuckling in that chesty, 
conspiratorial way of his, trying to make me feel better. And, just like Steve 
Martin's character in the film, I eventually did.</p>
