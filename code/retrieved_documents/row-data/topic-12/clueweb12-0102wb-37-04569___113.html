<p>In the largest ever initial public offering on the Indian stock exchange, 
Coal India, a huge government-owned coal company, recently offered 10% of its 
shares to investors at home and abroad.</p> 
<p>What was at stake was essentially a $35bn (&pound;21bn) bankrolling of 
enhanced global warming by the capital markets. Yet Coal India&rsquo;s 
prospectus, crafted with the help of a clutch of big-name investment banks, did 
not mention climate change once in 510 pages of exhortation to invest.</p> 
<p>And invest the fund managers did, unfettered by risk regulation or any 
meaningful requirement to place a value on the climate consequences of their 
scramble for short-term profit. The offering was oversubscribed 15 fold, and 
the stock soared on the first day of trading, 4 November, valuing Coal India at 
$49bn.</p> 
<p>Those ending up owning stock include 484 foreign funds, 195 mutual funds, 
44 insurance companies, and many banks. Many of these investors were using 
ordinary citizens&rsquo; money, and this would have included the nest eggs of 
people worried about global warming and its dire impact on the world by the 
time they retire. But those people are mostly allowed no say in where their 
pension funds, insurance premiums, and banking deposits are invested.</p> 
<p>In Canc&uacute;n, later this year, the world&rsquo;s governments will 
return to their annual climate summit completely stymied on even the smallest 
cuts in greenhouse emissions. At the same time, investment bankers will be back 
in their casinos with barely a light slap on their wrists after nearly plunging 
the world into depression in 2008.</p> 
<p>They are permitted to gamble once again with the global economy in the 
course of their routine investment business, this time knowing that the 
citizenry will be there to bail them out again. They are also permitted &ndash; 
as the Coal India IPO shows &ndash; to gamble with the global climate in the 
course of their routine advisory business, bringing coal to the markets by the 
gigatonne, without the requirement for a single item of liability accounting on 
the global balance sheet.</p> 
<p>Indeed, in this case it is not so much a gamble as a known outcome, if you 
believe the vast majority of climate scientists. As floods and wildfires have 
shown Pakistanis and Russians this summer, a few extreme events can visit 
ruinous setbacks on economies. Keep burning coal at anything like the rate we 
do today, and such events will compound until they destroy wealth faster than 
it can be created.</p> 
<p>Whither even basic risk assessment? Whither fiduciary responsibility? So 
long as you are targeting high profits in the very short-term, you can feel 
free to fry our childrens&rsquo; future and to use our citizens&rsquo; money to 
bankroll the cooking fat. This in essence is the default licence that 
governments and regulators have handed to the financial-services sector. How 
much more suicidally dysfunctional can modern capitalism get?</p> 
<p>On the same day Coal India shares started trading so too did Enel Green 
Power&rsquo;s. Enel, the Italian energy giant, had floated its renewables arm 
at the same time as Coal India, but its IPO was a flop. Institutional 
shareholders were particularly unsupportive. Some cited long-term fears for the 
viability of renewables generally. Shares duly fell on the first day of 
trading. Again, this spectacle involved fund managers investing and trading for 
people who, given a say, might well have chosen to factor climate change into 
the decisions taken.<br>
 In a civilisation intent on ensuring its own 
survival, much less prosperity, we would be using home-made sources of 
renewable energy, with great efficiency and fairness, and investing our own 
money to roll out ever more green infrastructure with which to build resilient 
local and national economies, so creating worthwhile jobs for our children.</p> 
<p>Opinion polls consistently show that this is the kind of world most of us 
would like to be living in, and the particularly galling thing is that we 
already have the technologies and strategies with which to deliver it. They 
involve things like zero-carbon homes, electric cars used as mobile energy 
storage plants, smart grids to optimise power use, and green bonds for 
financing the whole thing.</p> 
<p>But in the real world, today, such a vision can be glimpsed only in oases. 
Tomorrow might perhaps be different and better, given the growth rates of 
renewables industries, notwithstanding the languishing share prices of many 
renewables companies. But for now the Coal India IPO illustrates the enormity 
of the mountain we have to climb in order to arrive there.</p> Share: <br>

<p>While I believe that the world should be moving to a sustainable energy 
base, I think we need to worry about the technical and economic realities of 
this conversion and not to act in a frenzied way to get there.</p> 
<p>Too many times, the approach to non-fossil energy has been driven by 
business interests which don&rsquo;t always tell the whole truth without 
adequate consideration for what makes good public policy.</p> 
<p>The actions in Germany and Spain cutting back on subsidies for pv are a 
prime example of these business driven interests making claims of how fast 
costs will come down &ndash; which to date has not happened at the claimed rate.
</p> 
<p>In Colorado, we have a mandate for distributed pv which is totally out of 
whack with central power generation costs. And claims are made that there is a 
cost saving in transmission &ndash; true; but when you put numbers to it, the 
added cost of distributed pv paid for by the ratepayers far exceeds the cost of 
added transmission.</p> 
<p>There are certainly situations where distributed pv makes sense &ndash; 
where there is no grid.</p> 
<p>Let me go on: the business interests pushing pv and wind have ignored 
storage for as long as they could. You are now starting to hear the issue 
discussed &ndash; as a separate entity from generation. My favorite electric 
grid generation approach &ndash; csp, solar thermal has built in storage and is 
probably less expensive to build than pv per kwh. I predict it will probably 
win out as the &ldquo;800 pound gorilla&rdquo; in the long run as we settle on 
a specific implementation and the learning curve kicks in; though I don&rsquo;t 
rule out pv being a major player (once the initial investment is written off by 
bankruptcies as happened with fiber optics) and IF storage technology matures.
</p> 
<p>In the transportation sector, in a place like the United States with long 
distances, we have no viable solution in which we can have faith for success; 
though we should be funding R&amp;D and first order deployment for electrics, 
cellulosic ethanol, algae and my own hope &ndash; some form of artificial 
photosynthesis which converts air, water and solar energy to a liquid fuel. But 
in the meantime, I think the world would do well to add coal and natural gas to 
liquid to the mix of transportation fuels. And to recognize that the added CO2 
from these sources, until we can technically and economically sequester the 
CO2, will be offset by the need for the world to deploy geoengineering such as 
solar radiation management &ndash; with or without ctl/gtl should climate 
change prove to be sooner and greater than the most likely values.</p> 
<p>So my bottom line is that we not press for more and more non-fossil energy 
resources, but we try to look not only at those that can achieve 20 to 30% but 
80% as is the issue with the electric grid. And to fund the R&amp;D and demo 
programs for these activities. The DESERTEC activity in North Africa is very 
intriguing for the European electric grid.</p> 
<p>As to transportation, where there is high population density, public 
transit makes a lot of sense; but for much of the world, we need to bridge 
current resources of liquid fuel (including ctl/gtl) while we continue to work 
on &ldquo;inventions&rdquo; in the areas of electric, biofuels and artificial 
photosynthesis.</p> Share: <br>

<em>On 01/12/2010</em> 
<p>For the past 34 years I have had the opportunity to work in the Petroleum 
Industry as a Reservoir Engineer. During this time frame, I have evaluated 
reservoirs all over the World from Cambrian through Tertiary Geologic Time 
frames and all have the same types of Transgressive and Regressive cycles 
associated with sea water rise and fall. The fact sea water was 300 feet lower 
10,000 years ago and the Sahara desert was mostly a savannah indicates the 
effect of how climate change can change quickly over a relatively short period 
of time. The fact the Human Race is causing an increase should be of no great 
surprise. During the past 10,000 years the human race has stripped a good 
portion of Indigenous forests across most of the land masses around the World 
exposing more soil to heating, erosion, and temperature rises. In fact 
it&rsquo;s not a recent phenomenon; the Romans deforested most of Europe long 
before Columbus discovered America changing European Climate.</p> 
<p>While critics believe global warming is a hoax, anyone with their eyes open 
can see the Polar Caps shrinking, glaciers melting on a World wide basis, and 
droughts being reported across the globe, including the Amazon Basin. The 
question becomes &ldquo;How fast is Temperature Rising?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Can 
we decrease Carbon Emissions in time to effect this change before Mother Nature 
takes over and it&rsquo;s too late?&rdquo; Carbon Abatement is the only method 
we can employ today to control Carbon Emissions.</p> 
<p>As for your question &ldquo;What would it take to really speed up the 
transition to a carbon neutral society?&rdquo; The answer to that question 
involves the human race&rsquo;s ability to grow food for the masses. Today, the 
earth barely supports over 6 billion people from crops grown on only 10% of the 
Earth&rsquo;s surface. These include the Steps Region in Eastern Europe, the 
Great Plains of North America, and the Southeast Asia Rice Bowl. In the past, 
droughts have been reported in each of these areas. As the Earth warms, 
droughts will return to our breadbasket areas. The in-ability to feed the 
World&rsquo;s population will cause economic and political conflict, disease, 
and famine. If we want to abate CO2 and become a carbon neutral society, then 
the World needs a 9-11 Wake-up Call involving Global Food Production. Without 
it, we can&rsquo;t survive. By having a plentiful supply of food, it&rsquo;s 
the one common thread that keeps the human race civilized without becoming a 
pack of animals reverting back to our primal primitive instincts.</p> Share:

<p>There is a misguided assumption held by many that reducing the amount of 
carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of industrial and 
consumer behavior will be easy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Myriad 
hurdles threaten to trip up the advance of a carbon-neutral world.</p> 
<p>Chief among these is both the absolute scale and the depth of our 
dependence on fossil fuels. Seldom are these twin facets of everyday life 
translated in a meaningful way by commentators and, sadly, by daily news 
outlets.<br>
 The infrastructure that underpins our use &ndash; and abuse 
&ndash; of carbon-intensive fuels took hundreds of years to evolve. Alberta, 
the Canadian province I call home, is virtually paved with pipelines. The 
northern reaches of the province are also home to the world&rsquo;s 
second-largest proven reserves of oil after Saudi Arabia, and international 
firms from ExxonMobil to Total SA are busy pouring money into clawing the 
sticky black goo called bitumen from underneath vast tracts of boreal forest.
<br> Of course, unconventional oil is expensive to extract. Mining Canadian oil 
sands in particular requires multibillion-dollar capital investments that are 
typically paid back over long periods, which means mines currently up and 
running &ndash; and there are many &ndash; will not be switched off overnight.
</p> 
<p>Indeed, de-carbonizing the world will be a gradual, long-term movement. The 
International Energy Agency predicts in its latest World Energy Outlook that 
natural gas will play a &ldquo;central role in meeting the world&rsquo;s energy 
needs for at least the next two-and-a-half decades.&rdquo; In fact, the IEA 
says, natural gas is the only fossil fuel for which demand is higher in 2035 
than it was in 2008. Look for natural gas-fired power plants to gradually 
replace coal as the electricity-generating mainstay in Western countries.<br>
 
The bigger challenge will be convincing China and India that coal is uncouth. 
Even as the U.S. and Canada tut-tut burning the stuff, they are busy exporting 
it in ever-greater amounts to so-called developing economies.</p> 
<p>Until international climate negotiations target bulk shipments of fossil 
fuels &ndash; for instance, the growth in liquefied natural gas &ndash; a 
carbon-neutral world will remain elusive.</p> Share: <br>

<p>We want to keep present ecosystem or ecosystem of some time back in which 
we are feeling comfortable. Carbon neutral society helps to do so. We can 
contribute at four levels: individual, community, national and global. Carbon 
neutrality at global level works but need to be initiated or adopted at local 
level. Our interest for development without considering carbon factor is the 
main cause of the problem.</p> 
<p>There is some conscious in this line but every one seems trying to achieve 
global neutrality from others. It does not work. We need to develop new 
indicator for our activity, community and country for rating our society and 
development status in terms of carbon emission.</p> 
<p>We should stop rating countries based on physical and economic development 
for example &ldquo;Nepal is one of the poor countries&hellip;&rdquo; Rather we 
should start saying &ldquo;Nepal is one of the environmentally rich 
countries&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>We need to develop some kind of world governance that will be able to tax 
for more carbon emission and reward for less. This kind of governance not only 
brings carbon at neutral also contribute to world democracy indirectly.</p> 
<p>Every project and every human consumption should be measured in terms of 
carbon foot print. Science always support for carbon neutrality and present 
ecosystem, let&rsquo;s make use of it.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Let me start on a positive note; I will end the same way, everything else I 
have to say in this essay is less gratifying. Only a decade ago, many political 
leaders would have posed a different question: Who needs a carbon-neutral 
society in the first place? This attitude has transfigured into an overwhelming 
consensus that we do, and the political establishment and even the corporate 
world now share this position with scientists, social activists, the media and 
the public.</p> 
<p>How then do we account for the inaction that characterizes our collective 
response to the looming predicament of global climate change? It appears that 
we are doing little to confront this quandary, instead watching idly while it 
intensifies to ominous proportions.</p> 
<p>The answer is that we are short of good climate governance. Explicating the 
complex meaning of these three words takes a bit longer, much of the gloomier 
middle of this essay. Please bear with me.</p> 
<p>Climate change is a global phenomenon; it is only natural to respond 
internationally. The 1989 Kyoto Protocol was such an international reaction, 
like other international environmental accords a compromise, yet from the start 
full of holes like a Swiss cheese.</p> 
<p>The cracks only grew over time. The US did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol; 
most Annex 1 countries have increased rather than reduced their emissions since 
1989; China, India, Brazil and other non-Annex 1 countries have embarked on an 
unprecedented course of economic growth. The Protocol&rsquo;s only noteworthy 
long-term accomplishment is the establishment of emissions trading, an 
instrument adopted in Kyoto to help reduce global GHG emissions.</p> 
<p>Eleven years later, the 2010 UNFCCC Summit in Copenhagen (Cop15) produced 
essentially nothing. The &ldquo;road map&rdquo; adopted by the 2007 CoP13 
conference in Bali.(1) raised hope and expectations, but in Copenhagen&rsquo;s 
snowy environs, 194 nations with widely divergent interests wrangled about all 
three cardinal issues on the UNFCCC agenda: the who, how and when of 
mitigation, the funding of adaptation, and REDD, the absorption of GHG 
emissions by encouraging and funding reforestation in transition countries.</p> 
<p>Social scientists will tell you that the grounds for a negotiated climate 
deal are shaky. &ldquo;National interests&rdquo;(2) are too different and not 
always transparent to the observer, the prospects of a &ldquo;win-win 
outcome&rdquo; are virtually nonexistent, and the accumulating scientific data 
does not accelerate the &ldquo;ripening&rdquo; of discrepancies between the 
parties into a negotiated settlement. Even the Fourth Assessment Report issued 
in 2007 by the IPPC, the very scientific body founded by the UNFCCC to support 
international climate policy by producing (increasingly disturbing) data for 
CoP negotiators, fails to sufficiently impress policymakers in the 
international community. Short-term economic considerations and narrow national 
interests continue to call the shots in UNFCCC negotiations.</p> 
<p>As I write these lines, delegates around the world are packing their 
suitcases to attend the CoP16 meeting in Cancun. If you&rsquo;re not invited, 
don&rsquo;t despair. The weather is more pleasant than in Copenhagen and the 
beaches are nice, but the chances of progress toward a new climate protocol are 
slim. The May 2010 interim conference in Bonn yielded a negotiation text that 
had swelled from 17 to 34 pages, even greater disparities among national 
delegations about everything, and some undiplomatically pessimistic public 
statements,<br>
 such as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- Moon&rsquo;s 
acknowledgment that Cancun &ldquo;&hellip;might not produce a definitive 
agreement.&rdquo; The Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012, and the concurrent UNFCCC 
Summit (Cop17) in Johannesburg is unlikely to produce a timely replacement. In 
sum, the inept conduct of the international community certainly does not 
constitute &ldquo;good [global] climate governance&rdquo;, however one defines 
the term.</p> 
<p>Given that a consensual but implausible agreement is the only way to 
establish an international climate regime, political scientists and economists 
are exploring alternative, not necessarily multilateral arrangements. One 
proposal calls for the separate assessment, for each country, of the costs of 
climate change under a business-as-usual scenario and the of residual costs of 
climate change after mitigation and adaptation. This would presumably enable 
each nation to make rational-choice decisions about their positions in upcoming 
CoP negotiations. Yet, notwithstanding the burgeoning research following Sir 
Nicholas Stern&rsquo;s 2006 Review on the Economics of Climate Change(3), this 
database would be completed long after climate change grows into a bona fide 
environmental and human crisis.</p> 
<p>Another suggestion is to form coalitions between &ldquo;pioneering 
states&rdquo; and &ldquo;willing developing countries&rdquo;, which would 
entail technological, capacity-building and financial assistance, joint 
clean-tech ventures and more. The technologies and the market opportunities 
generated by this cooperation would attract other nations to enter into similar 
pacts to remain competitive, which in turn would facilitate the emergence and 
expansion of coalitions in future climate negotiations. So far, this lengthy 
course of action, already set in motion in Copenhagen, has met with little 
success.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Pioneering states&rdquo; do indeed exist(4). Their case is 
instructive insofar as their climate policies exemplify the meaning and 
importance of &ldquo;good governance&rdquo;&ndash;to my mind the main stepping 
stone on the road to a carbon-neutral society. To one extent or another, these 
countries&rsquo; climate policies consist of the following: a long-term and 
consistent climate policy with clear and measurable GHG reduction targets, 
based on scientific data (&ldquo;evidence-based policy&rdquo;), employing 
diverse policy tools aimed at generating more efficient energy markets and 
increasing the share of renewable energy resources, and periodic review and 
reassessment. Good national climate governance also requires institutional, 
financial and human resources and capacities to implement policy, and 
presupposes transparency and public participation throughout decision-making 
and implementation. Interestingly, the literature on governance for 
sustainability and the search for &ldquo;best sustainable practices&rdquo; that 
can be adopted by other nations also highlight these factors.</p> 
<p>Nobody is perfect, and even pioneers sometimes make faulty decisions. 
Germany, which has already succeeded in decoupling economic growth from fossil 
energy use and national GHG emissions, is about to extend the phase-out period 
of its nuclear reactors, paradoxically to achieve the ambitious GHG reduction 
targets it has set for itself. Speak about the devil and the Beelzebub! As 
recent events once again demonstrate, the German public does not particularly 
like nuclear energy, especially the shipping of nuclear waste. The government 
has not engaged its citizens in a dialogue, i.e. has fallen short of adhering 
to the tenets of transparency and public participation. Still, Germany&rsquo;s 
climate policies are considered &ldquo;pioneering&rdquo;, and justifiably so.
</p> 
<p>Faulty decisions or not, Germany and other &ldquo;pioneering states&rdquo; 
confirm that good climate governance at the national level is possible and 
successful. Most of the technologies for the transition to a carbon-neutral 
society already exist, among others renewable energy resources, energy 
efficiency in housing and transportation, heat exchange systems and 
climate-friendly infrastructures. Most are competitive and cost-efficient, some 
are still immature (e.g. smart electricity grids) or controversial (carbon 
sequestration).<br>
 These are the technologies of the future; they will drive 
the second industrial revolution toward ecological modernization. No national 
economy can remain competitive and viable without developing them, producing or 
purchasing them and using them&ndash;in short, breaking the path to a 
carbon-neutral society. But as of now we are short of good climate governance, 
and of the political will to put the available technological and policy tools 
into practice.</p> 
<p>As a hopeless optimist I cannot but end on a positive note. Nations are not 
the only players in the global climate game. Some, such as energy corporations, 
are not particularly helpful. Others, such as NGOs, do their best but obviously 
have little direct influence on the emission of GHG. It is the local level 
where much of the real climate action happens right now. Thousands of regions, 
cities, towns and communities worldwide have developed or are developing 
blueprints for the reduction of GHG emissions, and many are implementing them. 
Networks of cities, national and international, are aiding their members with 
consultation, expertise and funding.</p> 
<p>Cities and regions around the world have become major players in the battle 
against climate change. The proportion of direct and indirect urban GHG 
emissions in the global greenhouse gas household exceeds sixty percent. Many 
urban regions are increasingly vulnerable to climate change, especially in 
coastal zones. Appropriate measures to mitigate climate change and to adapt to 
changing environmental conditions are unmistakably in order.</p> 
<p>Municipalities affect the lives of city residents in ways that the national 
authorities cannot. Urban planning, the replacement of antiquated urban 
infrastructures and the development of institutional capacities can produce 
significant GHG reductions and lead to relatively rapid changes in 
residents&rsquo; energy consumption and behaviors. The success of many cities 
in reducing GHG emissions demonstrates that effective climate change policy is 
possible at the urban level as well.</p> 
<p>We will have to wait and see whether these local initiatives will have a 
substantial impact on global GHG emissions, and whether they will spread to the 
national and international policy spheres. More than half of us already dwell 
in urban areas; this concerns us individually as well as collectively.</p>

at two percent of global GNP.<br>
 4 There are also &ldquo;willing developing 
countries&rdquo; prepared to learn and cooperate; there may just not be enough 
time for these budding partnerships to evolve into effective global climate 
change protection.</p> Share: <br>

<p>To begin, we need the desire to actually transit to a carbon neutral 
society. Provided we do, we need to understand that with the exception of 
drying our clothes in the sunlight, we do not possess any way of harnessing 
carbon free power. All of our existing energy production methods require vast 
amounts of non-renewable resources &ndash; from steel and rare earths to fossil 
fuels. This underlies the unsexy truth that carbon neutrality requires us to 
first and foremost, conserve.</p> 
<p>Second, we must begin paying the full price for energy we do consume. This 
means the end of cap and trade policies that shuffle money and blame around by 
shifting energy intensive manufacturing processes to other parts of the world. 
It also means the end of policies that promote energy production based on its 
type and not on its actual resource footprint. A classic example of a 
distortion resulting from this type of approach is of North American woodchips 
being burned in Europe to generate &ldquo;carbon-neutral&rdquo; electricity.</p>
<p>Finally, we must embrace a properly structured carbon tax as a painful but 
necessary policy mechanism. A carbon tax is fair and it allocates cost across 
the whole range of carbon-producing entities from industry and energy 
production to the final consumer. It will also finance the development of 
cleaner technologies. A carbon tax should be coupled with a carbon tariff to 
account for emissions generated elsewhere.</p> Share: <br>

<p>I strongly believe that there are many opportunities for more sustainable 
technologies across many fields and disciplines. There is a need for more 
concerted efforts for all of us, each in his/her own discipline, in trying to 
create greener and cleaner alternatives to many of the existing technologies 
that can leave smaller carbon footprints. In the next few lines I will 
summarize some of the issues related to my field of research, which is high 
performance computing.</p> 
<p>Concerns of power (or energy) consumption have become increasingly 
significant in the context of the design as well as the use of 
high&ndash;performance computing systems. Although distributed systems 
(clusters, supercomputers, grids, data centres and clouds) provide an 
unparalleled level of computational horsepower for solving challenging problems 
across a wide spectrum of fields&mdash;from scientific inquiry, engineering 
design, and financial analysis to national defence and disaster 
prediction&mdash;such horsepower usually equals enormous power consumption, not 
only to run the distributed system but also to cool it. This, in turn, results 
in extremely large electricity bills and reduced system reliability [1]. 
Accordingly, the High Performance Computing research community started 
exploring green distributed computing as a way to achieve autonomic energy and 
power savings with little to no impact on performance.</p> 
<p>The energy consumption issue in cloud computing systems raises various 
monetary, environmental and system performance concerns. A recent study on 
power consumption by servers (the type used in cloud computing systems) shows 
that electricity use for servers worldwide&mdash;including their associated 
cooling and auxiliary equipment&mdash;in 2005 cost 7.2 billion US dollars. The 
study also indicates that this electricity consumption in that year had doubled 
compared with consumption in 2000 [2]. Clearly, there are environmental issues 
with the generation of electricity. For example, the number of transistors 
integrated into today&rsquo;s Intel Itanium 2 processor reaches to nearly 1 
billion. If this rate continues, the heat (per square centimetre) produced by 
future Intel processors would exceed that of the surface of the sun; this 
implies the possibility of worsening system reliability, eventually resulting 
in poor system performance.</p> 
<p>Scheduling and resource allocation in distributed systems play a major role 
in finding the best task&ndash;resource matches in time and space based on a 
given objective function without violating a given set of constraints. This is 
an important and but computationally intractable problem [3]. There are efforts 
worldwide to design more efficient resource allocation protocols for cloud 
systems. These protocols normally govern how an application or a set of 
applications are mapped onto the existing resources in a cloud environment. The 
design of such protocols for cloud systems is further complicated by the fact 
that the different sites in a cloud system are likely to have different 
capabilities.<br>
 If one is to add energy or power as an added constraint to 
create a more sustainable computing system then the problem becomes much more 
complex. it is not enough to simply minimize the total energy usage in the 
cloud; instead one needs to simultaneously minimize energy usage between all 
the different providers in the clouds. Apart from the multitude of ownerships 
of the different sites, a cloud differs from traditional high performance 
computing systems in the heterogeneity of the computing nodes as well as the 
communication links that connect the different nodes together.</p> 
<p>Energy&ndash;aware scheduling is a software based power saving approach 
which has great potential due to its inherent adaptability, 
cost&ndash;effectiveness and applicability. In this approach, given a set of 
tasks and a set of resources (e.g., processors and disks)&mdash;typically 
energy consumption/savings associated with each element in both sets is 
identified&mdash;these preprocessed tasks are then prioritized, matched with 
resources, and scheduled while complying with constraints if any. Each of these 
steps is devised to maximize the objective function. The quality of output 
schedule is determined using an appropriate objective function that takes into 
account energy consumption in addition to other conventional metrics, such as, 
task completion times and load balance, high throughput and high availability 
[4].</p> 
<p>Energy&ndash;aware resource management has emerged as a promising approach 
for sustainable/green computing. Although many algorithms and strategies have 
been developed, their application is quite restricted for example, to systems 
such as battery&ndash;powered devices, homogeneous computing systems or 
single&ndash;processor systems. In addition to system homogeneity, tasks are 
often homogeneous or independent. However, the problem is completely different 
in the case of cloud computing systems. This calls for the development of 
various software energy&ndash;saving techniques including scheduling and 
virtualization.</p>

<p>I would point to at least three things that would speed the transition. 
First, government policy needs to be realigned in that direction, meaning 
incentives for fossil fuels need to be shifted to low-carbon alternatives and 
procurement policies need to reshaped and religiously implemented. There is a 
broad recognition that governments are huge consumers of goods and services in 
their own right and sound procurement policies can build markets for low-carbon 
goods and services much as they did in the case of recycling and recycled 
content. Second, we need to rethink how we consume goods and services and 
change the designs and delivery accordingly. In the Western world, we presently 
consume or over-consume all kinds of products, including electronics, 
newspapers, magazines, food and beverages and so on. Many types of hardware 
today are intentionally designed to have a limited useful life, telephones 
being the prime example. It is not an overstatement to say that we have a 
&ldquo;throwaway&rdquo; society. Products either need to last longer or be more 
easily dematerialized and repurposed. All of the these shifts in thinking will 
have be embraced by the public at large, no mean feat. Finally, we need sound 
urban planning and related infrastructure. Over 50% of the world now lives in 
cities and that pace of urbanization is accelerating. We should demand that 
transit, housing and other essentials are planned in such a way as to reduce 
travel, fuel consumption and generation of carbon emissions. The opposite is 
often the case in many U.S. metropolitan areas. While I am optimistic that 
there is growing support for each of these proposed directions, we can only 
hope that the current slow recovery from the recession does not create 
significant delay.</p> Share: <br>

<p>The original 2007 EU Climate Change and Energy Package was titled 
&ldquo;towards a new industrial revolution&rdquo;. With now only forty years to 
go to 2050 this is indeed true. In order to meet the Copenhagen accord of less 
than 2 degrees Celsius in temperature by 2050, meaning a global minus 50 % of 
CO2 emissions by 2050 or an OECD target of -80 to -95% of CO2 emissions, we 
require a complete system change in a very short time span. In comparison, 
mankind had about a century to adapt to steam engines. If these targets are 
indeed to be met, we need Currency, Courage, Choices and Creativity.</p> 
<p>Currency will be crucial. The International Energy Agency technology 
perspectives estimates that something around a trillion dollars alone are 
needed to transform the industry. The current crisis does not help, and carbon 
leakage effects make the situation even worse. We need a system that draws 
investments towards Europe, urgently. We might end up with the technology 
available, the policy in place, but without the investments to get there. If 
the EU society is really serious in meeting these targets, we need to ask 
ourselves some serious questions. Why is our financial sector, our 
pension-funds investing in China? Because we need a higher short term return? 
Could we not use that money better for transforming our energy and industry 
system and creating our future society that we aim for? Maybe money is still 
cheap. But investments are getting scarce in this part of the world. No 
investments, no change. That means finding a balance between putting a price on 
carbon and leaving industry the funds to finance the future.</p> 
<p>Courage is needed next to currency. The courage, the ambition to really 
drive the 2050 targets and the industrial revolution needed to get there. This 
means setting targets alone is by far not sufficient. Unless the industrial 
policy for a globalised era, the innovation union and the raw material 
initiative of the EU deliver real support to industry, it will not be enough. 
The EU Emissions Trading System will not deliver on its own. The price for 
Carbon emissions could go up as high as it wants; in the end all companies can 
do is close their doors when the much needed technology is not available.</p> 
<p>Choices will have to be made as well. For sectors like ours, 2050 is two 
paper machine investments away. The machine that will be built tomorrow will 
still be there in 2040. The machine built in the near future will still be 
there in 2050. Policy in Brussels always wants to be technology neutral. The 
question is, however, if we have the time to be neutral and wait. Or if we 
should have a clear view of possible technologies soon and move forward as fast 
as possible. Choices also involves the courage to support large pilot projects, 
jumping the valley of death of R&amp;D. Besides the general opinion of Carbon 
Capture and Storage or CCS, the idea to have 15 large scale pilot projects 
needs to be followed up. Most likely in every industry sector we need to change 
government R&amp;D support from focusing on many small projects towards 
shifting to a limited number of very large projects with large support.</p> 
<p>Finally, creativity. It is clear that changes needed will not come without 
new, creative, out-of-the-box solutions. One cannot change the energy system 
alone. Neither can one change only the industry. Consumer patters have to 
change, value chains redesigned, renewable materials used for production and in 
balance with their use for energy. Efficiency has to be greatly improved and 
industries&rsquo; strengths combined, etc. The current policy plans almost 
&ldquo;plan&rdquo; innovations. Knowing we have little time, we should still 
find a system that leaves the door open for solutions that might look crazy 
today, but might make a lot of sense tomorrow.</p> 
<p>The European pulp and paper industry is reflecting on the questions above 
and is developing the sector&rsquo;s 2050 Roadmap. We will define the 
conditions desired and the policies needed , keeping in mind that our sector, 
based on renewable and recyclable materials, is part of the solution for a low 
carbon 2050</p> Share: <br>

<p>The media and politicians clamor for simple solutions to complex problems. 
There is no &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; strategy to achieve a low carbon 
society. It requires a changes in a broad array of behaviors, by industry, 
government, consumers, and voters. It requires a portfolio of policies that 
target the many market failures and market conditions impeding innovation and 
investments in low carbon technologies. It requires policies and social 
marketing that target behavioral changes in industry and business and also 
consumers, since in the end it is us as consumers, citizens, and shareholders 
who will direct the trsansition. The transition would be accelerated by 
international agreements and a direct internalizing of carbon costs via carbon 
taxes or cap and trade programs&mdash;but none of this is necessary, at least 
in the near and medium term future. The transition must start locally, and 
indeed that is already happening. The call for greater energy efficiency, 
reduced oil imports, and more livable cities is already significantly reducing 
carbon emissions per unit of GDP. Much more is needed, but in some sense the 
transition is already underway.</p> Share: <br>

<p>My answer may surprise, if not astonish, those who also seek ways to speed 
up the transition to a carbon-neutral global economy. Yes, we must push hard to 
incentivize and create new energy-efficient, low-carbon sustainable 
technologies. I spend most of my professional day working to clear lawsuits, 
regulatory red tape and policy barriers out of the way and to obtain the myriad 
of financial incentives federal and state governments offer green technologies. 
Yes, we need for the US Congress to legislate on industrial greenhouse gas 
emissions, and for the Obama Administration and our courts to step up while 
Congress&rsquo;s foolish regression on climate change spirals out of control. 
Yes, the world needs an effective global climate regime, if not the Kyoto 
framework then something else as acceptable. Yes, we need to clean up and 
sequester carbon from fossil-fuel-fired electrical generation facilities, and 
to revisit the desirability of both large and small nuclear plants. Yes, we 
need climate bellwethers such as the enlightened companies and defense 
ministries that are pursuing a carbon-neutral agenda (and thereto I must praise 
the extraordinary commitment that the US Department of Defense has recently 
made to reduce GHG emissions and green its equipment and installations).</p> 
<p>But we will never achieve a carbon-neutral society unless we push very hard 
on other strategies that have nothing to do with electrical generation, 
industrial GHG emissions quotas or, for that matter, even CO2 emissions 
themselves. Does that astonish you? Not if you already know that non-CO2 
emissions, primarily methane, hydrofluorocarbons, smog-causing ozone and dark 
soot particles, cause just under half of all climate-forcing, which means that 
the strategies we discuss the most address only about half the problem. We 
absolutely must undertake the faster, more effective reduction of 
CO2-equivalents by controlling these emissions, to buy time to get far less 
tractable CO2 emissions reduced.</p> 
<p>Methane, a valuable fuel and main constituent of natural gas, has a GWP of 
25 and is released from landfills, livestock, coal mines, rice paddies and 
leaky gas pipelines. Generation and capture techniques are a far cry from green 
hi-tech: agricultural rot prevention, pipeline repair and landfill 
capture-and-burn.</p> 
<p>More than 200 billion metric tons of CO2-equivalent reductions of 
fluorocarbon emissions (HFCs, HCFCs) have already taken place under the 
Montreal Protocol, an accomplishment greater than the entire (unachieved) first 
commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. Consider how much further from a 
carbon-neutral global economy we would be now without Montreal, and there are 
more reductions where those came from: at the recent Bangkok Montreal Protocol 
summit, ninety one parties agreed to support the phase out of HFCs, which could 
potentially eliminate up to 100 billion metric tons more of CO2-equivalent by 
2050. And have you noticed what the world&rsquo;s major auto manufacturers just 
announced that they intend to do? They are going to start using HFC-1234yf 
instead of HFC-134a in vehicle air conditioning systems. Enormous quantities of 
refrigerant escape to the atmosphere from leaks and junking wrecks and retired 
vehicles. The GWP of HFC-134a is 1,430, while the GWP of HFC-1234yf is only 
four (4). Other sectors and companies are changing out refrigerants to lower 
GWP versions as well, as announced in Cancun this week.</p> 
<p>Smog-causing ozone and soot emissions are already stringently regulated, 
but emissions can be reduced further (with enormous co-benefits for health, 
food crops and property) with broader, stricter controls. Yet the huge soot and 
CO2 emissions from open fires of all sorts globally go almost unaddressed. 
Consider, right along with lost carbon sequestration from global deforestation, 
the huge related contribution to atmospheric CO2 each day from slash-and-burn 
land clearing and the woody-mass-fueled cook fires used by three billion people 
in the developing world. Tens of millions of low-heat fires are notorious soot 
and CO2 generation &ldquo;pinpoint&rdquo; sources, which when aggregated likely 
contribute many hundreds of megatons of CO2 to the atmosphere. Thus, reaching 
global carbon-neutrality also involves replacing open cook fires with the 
simple, efficient biomass-burning cook stoves available today. These stoves 
consume most of their carbon-containing gaseous emissions and generate stable; 
carbon-rich biochar that can be used to supplement the productivity of 
agricultural lands. Depending on the stove, replacing a cook fire with a 
clean-burning stove can eliminate one to four tons of CO2 emissions a year. It 
is a tall order, but 100 million clean stoves would reduce CO2 emissions by 100 
to 400 million tons a year. A range of stoves, for example, those sold by 
WorldStove, are available, from small &ldquo;nomad&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;backpacking&rdquo; units, to family sized, to the large, community-sized 
pyrolysis units that also produce syngas and bio-oil.</p> 
<p>Finally, bringing the climate challenge back to North America, we have yet 
to give serious attention to the enormous releases of CO2 from the dead and now 
decaying US and Canadian forests devastated by the pine bark beetle. The 
quantity of CO2 released may reach several hundred megatons, not of CO2, but of 
carbon, offsetting and perhaps cancelling all the carbon management measures I 
mentioned in the beginning. Recent data disclose the astonishing likelihood 
that, far from serving as an invaluable carbon sink, these decaying trees and 
deadfall will cause massive carbon-positive releases exactly coinciding with 
the decades during which we hope to best the climate-forcing challenge. Yet we 
almost certainly will fail, unless we act to keep the huge amount of carbon 
stored in these dead forests from escaping. Can it be done? Again, 
there&rsquo;s little green hi-tech has to offer but yes, a strategy is 
available &ndash; converting this biomass to syngas, bio-oil and biochar via 
pyrolysis &ndash; an extraordinary public works project, but necessary, it 
appear, to get ahead of this problem.</p> 
<p>What I have suggested here would not be necessary, were it not for the huge 
but underappreciated carbon and carbon-equivalent releases that must be averted 
if any of the other measures the world adopts to turn back climate-forcing are 
to be effective. You may recognize elements of what I have suggested as the 
heart of the so-called Fast Action Agenda. For more see this Op-Ed piece in the 
New York Times and this more technical article published in the Proceedings of

<p>Given the current trajectory of world energy demand with non-OECD economic 
growth and associated demographic trends, a carbon neutral society will be an 
extreme challenge for the public and private sectors to meet. While a lofty 
goal, striving towards carbon neutrality will further enable the great energy 
revolution, of which we are in the early stages. Energy is the fuel for 
economic growth, and the transition to supplementing carbon-based fuel sources 
such as coal and oil with cleaner energy will be a very long-term, secular 
growth trend.</p> 
<p>Converging Catalysts Create Opportunity<br>
 There are multiple and 
converging catalysts at work that are enabling this energy revolution to power 
global economies more efficiently. Companies now recognize sustainability as a 
competitive advantage, and are moving to capitalize on the demographic trend of 
increased environmental awareness. For example, automotive manufacturer Nissan 
is soon to release its Nissan Leaf electric car in the 2011 model year, and is 
receiving orders from consumers sight-unseen, with current demand much greater 
than manufacturing capacity. The strong brand equity Nissan has experienced 
since the Leaf announcement has led to increased general dealership volumes and 
plans at Nissan to expand electric vehicle offerings.</p> 
<p>Environmental regulations are now more stringent in the developed markets, 
particularly in high environmental impact industries such as utilities and 
transport. Globally, most current and planned climate change regulations target 
high-emitting &ldquo;point sources&rdquo;, with coal fired, base-load power 
generation as the starting point. Efficient transport regulations are in place 
and stepping-up in rigor in the European Union, as light and heavy vehicle 
manufacturers must meet more stringent tailpipe emissions standards or face 
increasingly stiff penalties. As nations begin to gather for yet another round 
of international climate change regulatory discussions, it is clear that 
countries, regions, and companies are not waiting for a binding and global 
regulatory framework for climate change. While the EPA in the U.S. finalizes 
plans for GHG regulations in high emission industries, China has made energy 
efficiency and lower emissions per unit of GDP a national priority.</p> 
<p>With coal increasingly targeted by environmental regulations given its high 
GHG emissions, nations are beginning to determine how to supplement traditional 
fossil fuels with clean energy technologies. Energy independence and access are 
major drivers for the implementation of clean technology practices, with energy 
source diversification a key, long-term indicator of sustainable economic 
growth.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>As figure 14, from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) depicts 
above, all energy sources will be required as world economies expand and energy 
demand increases a forecasted 30% from today to 2030. Furthermore, energy 
demand globally is driven by non-OECD countries, as their energy consumption 
passed OECD energy consumption back in 2006. While demand for energy surges, 
driven by economic transition, all fuel types will be in demand, from liquid 
fuel, to coal, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy. The challenge exists 
to develop alternatives to recognized contributors to climate change such as 
coal, at a time when China&rsquo;s demand for coal surpassed the rest of the 
world in 2005.</p> 
<p>Broad Opportunities<br>
 Given the diversity of the challenges to address 
climate change while meeting increased energy demands due to the economic 
transitions of the emerging markets, we take a broad, thematic approach to 
environmental investing. The viable technologies that can assist with climate 
change mitigation and adaptation rest across most economic sectors, yet point 
to discrete solutions. Our approach to environmental investing is the 
recognition that companies enabling this new energy revolution will deliver 
greater shareholder returns over time. In managing the Essex Global 
Environmental Opportunities Strategy (GEOS), we take a thematic approach to 
environmental investing, and have developed nine themes that we believe capture 
the opportunities stemming from global climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. There is no single solution to combat climate change, yet, 
collectively, cross-economy solutions from many industries will drive the new 
energy economy.</p> 
<p>Nine GEOS Themes</p> 
<p>The GEOS investment process leverages climate change mitigation and 
adaptation opportunities across nine environmental themes:</p> 
<p>-agricultural productivity and clean fuels: improve agricultural yields; 
non-carbon fuel sources<br>
 -clean technology and efficiency: environmental 
conservation methods; limit waste during power generation<br>
 -efficient 
transport: enable greater efficiencies for transport<br>
 -environmental 
finance: carbon trading infrastructure and financing<br>
 -power merchants and 
generation: power sources and services with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
<br> -power technology: improve the efficiency of power production, 
distribution and storage<br>
 -renewable energy: power generation using natural 
resources that are naturally replenished<br>
 -low carbon commerce: businesses 
which lower GHG emissions for global commerce and consumption<br>
 -water: 
water treatment, purification, desalination and distribution</p> Share: <br>

<p>Abraham Lincoln said: &ldquo;If I had eight hours to cut down a tree, 
I&rsquo;d spend six hours sharpening my axe.&rdquo; Chefs are equally careful 
about sharpening their knives. The analogy to carbon neutrality plans should be 
clear: careful preparation should not be omitted.</p> 
<p>But in the panic over global warming, post-combustion chemical CO2 capture 
and underground CO2 dumping (&ldquo;sequestration&rdquo;), biofuels, windmills, 
and solar &mdash; none of which are workable at utility scale for providing the 
baseload power the world needs &mdash; were rushed forward and absorbed all of 
the available money. So now there are no resources to fund anything. The 
assurances of the environmentalists and the cap-and-trade advocates that 
&ldquo;we have all the technology we need&rdquo; have now proven to be false. 
The sequestration idea is particularly ridiculous. See
http://network.carboncapturejournal.com/forum/topics/sequestration-time-to-punt 
</p> 
<p>Sharpening the axe should begin with frank technology assessment, which 
should not cost much. However, frankness is a lot to hope for. Nobody wants to 
admit a mistake and change direction, especially when the funding apparatus is 
supervised by those invested in the mistake. Money keeps on going to the same 
silly projects, like enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in depleted reservoirs in the 
guise of &ldquo;sequestration&rdquo; to store CO2 emissions.</p> 
<p>Carbon neutrality means not making the CO2 problem worse as we satisfy the 
need for more power. What that will mean is a realistic plan for capturing CO2 
from flue gas and then converting it to something else. Substituting wind and 
solar for coal and natural gas in providing baseload power is not going to 
happen because they are intermittent and isolated from the grid. However, a 
real job that wind and solar might do is the conversion task, in electrolytic 
dissociation of CO2 to make liquid fuel or elemental carbon, recycling the 
oxygen back into the plant for oxyfuel combustion or oxygen-blown gasification. 
Such a hybrid power system would get wind and solar widely deployed by making 
CO2 into a resource. Solar conversion of CO2 to liquid fuel is being pioneered 
in the US by Sandia National Laboratories.</p> 
<p>Although the frolicking billionaires of Wall Street hoped for a new junk 
bubble in bogus offset trading schemes such as cap-and-trade, that is not going 
to happen either. The indulgences issued by the Catholic church did not stop 
sin, and &ldquo;carbon offsets&rdquo; will not reduce CO2 emissions. New policy 
should focus on actual emissions reductions, which should be rewarded with a 
per-documented-ton bounty on the captured and converted CO2. A prize for good 
plans should also be awarded, to stimulate innovation. This will not cost much. 
A few of the billions presently being squandered on EOR 
&ldquo;sequestration&rdquo; projects of benefit only to the oil companies 
should be plenty for a good start.</p> Share: <br>

<p>New challenges such as global environmental and climatic change, the 
dwindling availability of ecosystem services, the increased demand for natural 
resources and geo-political power shifts demand innovative solutions. In order 
to turn these challenges into opportunities, sustainable development is 
proposed as the answer. Indeed, at the 1992 Rio World Conference on Environment 
and Development, world leaders formally endorsed the idea of sustainable 
development as a guiding concept to solve complex issues linking environment 
and development. Sustainable development was defined by the seminal Brundtland 
Report as &lsquo;development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&rsquo;. 
Ever since, a multitude of initiatives have been undertaken to popularize and 
to implement sustainable development. The increased realization of the 
consequences of global climate change has shifted the emphasis of the 
sustainability debate towards human-induced carbon emissions since the late 
1990s. Currently, the &lsquo;carbon-neutral society&rsquo; ranks amongst the 
most popular &lsquo;big ideas&rsquo;, backed by world leaders, the United 
Nations and businesses alike. The rise of a &lsquo;green economy&rsquo; is 
supposed to make the &lsquo;carbon-neutral society&rsquo; happen, as it takes 
the links between economy, society and the environment into account and aims to 
boost and diversify our society, create employment opportunities, improve 
equity and foster sustainability. Although setting inspiring goals, these 
all-encompassing strategies are still perceived as being overly abstract. They 
build on the idea of sustainable development, but they need to be translated 
into operational tools and processes, that have the power to make 
sustainability work.</p> 
<p>Sustainability assessment (SA) is an ex ante assessment decision-supporting 
process that can contribute to the transition towards a carbon-neutral society. 
It is defined as a contextually adaptable process that aims to: i. integrate 
sustainability issues into decision-making by identifying and assessing 
sustainability impacts (in particular impacts on carbon emissions); ii. 
contribute to a better understanding of the actual interpretation of what 
sustainability and a &lsquo;carbon-neutral society&rsquo; mean, and iii. foster 
sustainability objectives to be achieved in order to realize this aspirational 
carbon neutrality.<br>
 The idea is that the adequate integration of 
sustainability principles in decisions made at various levels (from local to 
sub-national to (inter)national level) will contribute to the achievement of a 
carbon-neutral society. Before a decision is taken, a &ndash;policy- proposal 
is adapted or modified in order to respect pre-defined, sustainability 
principles (including carbon-neutrality principles). SA also embodies the 
democratic values of sustainability, as it needs to be conducted in a 
participatory way. SA is situated at the interface between science, society and 
policy. SA provides evidence to decision-makers, generates individual and 
organizational learning, avoids costly mistakes and provides a forum for 
deliberation and participation. All these are aspects that pave the way for a 
successful societal transition towards carbon neutrality. Furthermore, the 
holistic approach of SA ensures that key sustainability topics (ranging from 
biodiversity conservation to poverty eradication) are not &lsquo;lost&rsquo; in 
an overly narrow focus on carbon emissions alone.</p> 
<p>But how does a sustainability assessment &lsquo;look like&rsquo; in 
practice? And how can it be used in a key sector to achieve carbon neutrality, 
such as the energy sector?<br>
 First, SA can be used as a foresight tool; as a 
guide to energy transitions. SA is then an iterative, long-term, pro-active and 
explorative framework generating knowledge to feed the societal debate on how 
to tackle major challenges in a sustainable way. In the energy sector, this 
means providing answers with regard to e.g. smart electricity grids, the future 
of fossils fuels, the reality and the perception of nuclear energy risks, 
long-term emission reduction goals and international energy cooperation. SA is 
then seen as a stakeholder-driven process in search of sustainable energy 
futures. First, factors influencing the energy system are identified. Factors 
are e.g. energy price dynamics, ecological constraints, international energy 
policy etc. Subsequently, favorable factor projections for different worldviews 
are combined into scenario skeletons, which are then elaborated into scenarios 
based on back-casting methodology. This is followed by deliberative feedback on 
storylines and by an assessment of the storylines&rsquo; sustainability. 
Ultimately this leads to an identification of energy scenario preferences that 
will embody the societal transition.</p> 
<p>Secondly, SA can also be a practical tool to assess concrete projects (e.g. 
energy projects). This is an essential complimentary function, as realizing the 
transition will require the implementation of tangible initiatives &ndash; say 
projects. Although SA is a generic term covering a wide range of approaches, it 
is most often a stepwise approach consisting of a screening phase, a context 
analysis and scoping phase, the actual impact prediction and assessment phase, 
a series of recommendations on possible trade offs, a follow-up and a quality 
control phase. In the energy sector, SA can be used to assess the 
sustainability impacts of a wide range of initiatives, such as developing new 
power plants, assessing wind parks, assessing projects under the Kyoto 
Protocol&rsquo;s flexible mechanisms, as our team did for Clean Development 
Mechanism-projects in Vietnam.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, sustainability assessment can be a powerful process that 
allows decision-makers to structure complex &lsquo;hot societal topics&rsquo; 
in a systematic way, based on scientific input and on participation. When 
carefully applied, SA helps to think out of the box and can be a significant 
step to help to steer the chain of actions towards a much-needed transition. 
What is needed is a stronger diffusion of best practice applications of SA, and 
a continued awareness raising amongst decision-makers in the public and private 
sector on the added value of &lsquo;sustainability informed&rsquo; 
decision-making.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Get everyone on board! Politicians, businesses and individuals all need to 
be aligned toward making a carbon neutral society as the engine of our economic 
future.</p> 
<p>Partisan politics and special interests are still intervening against 
society&rsquo;s best interests. In the US, we just finished grueling elections 
that brought back some pretty extreme views, including denial that climate 
change is a factual reality. The oil industry and other interests are 
undermining efforts to move forward and are misinforming the public.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s widely acknowledged that with a Republican majority, 
there&rsquo;s no chance for energy and climate change legislation. Instead they 
plan to prevent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions while increasing 
offshore oil drilling.</p> 
<p>During the November 2010 elections, the oil industry funded two referendums 
in California (Proposition 23 and Proposition 26) to de-rail the state&rsquo;s 
prescient climate change law. California passed a law in 2006 (AB32) which 
requires the state to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Prop 23 was 
voted down, but Prop 26 passed &ndash; it requires a two-thirds vote to pass 
any new taxes on business, which will make it difficult to fund the climate 
change law. See my article on Prop 23 and Prop 26.</p> 
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s climate change, peak oil, energy security, keeping the 
billions we spend on oil at home to grow our own economy, or competing with the 
likes of China for leadership in new industries, such as wind and solar, 
everyone can find a reason to move to a carbon neutral society.</p> 
<p>We must find a way to help people see the promise of a clean energy-based 
society based on green jobs. Once individuals, businesses and politicians see 
it as in their best interest, we&rsquo;ll be on the road. That means delivering 
a vision of a healthy, stable society that people can buy into. So far, the 
will to move forward has been lacking because of a lack of this vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Electricity should be as cheap as oxygen.&rdquo; &ndash; Thomas 
Edison</p> 
<p>Pricing Carbon</p> 
<p>The only way the US can become carbon neutral quickly is to price carbon. 
Until we understand that nothing that causes a collective harm to society is 
free, and that should include carbon, little progress will be made toward 
becoming a carbon-neutral society. As any price on carbon would need to be 
legislated and enforced by the government, it would function similarly to a 
tax. Pricing carbon, however, would have broader-reaching financial incentives 
for reducing carbon emissions.</p> 
<p>Like any human endeavor of this size and magnitude, there are challenges 
related to carbon pricing, in addition to the difficulty of its implementation. 
Many argue that pricing carbon would have similar consequences to a regressive 
tax. They say a government-imposed price on carbon emissionswould unfairly 
causelower income citizens to spend proportionately more of their money on 
utilities and products that will incur this tax or carbon pricethan theirmore 
well-to-do contemporaries.</p> 
<p>Yet, we have an alcohol tax, a tobacco tax, a lottery and gambling tax. 
These are all regressive taxes, and we accept them.As a society we have 
understood that each of these &ldquo;vices&rdquo; inevitably lead to real costs 
to our country &ndash; they are a negative externality &ndash; and we have to 
account for these costs. Issuing a tax on alcohol or tobacco was not a 
choreographed effort to stop people from drinking or smoking (although it 
inevitably discouraged it).In America, if a person wants to enjoy a drink or a 
cigarette, they are free to do so. The reason we instituted taxes for these 
items was because the people who do not drink or smoke &ndash; the healthy ones 
&ndash; end up indirectly paying the medical bills for the people who do and 
get sick.</p> 
<p>Here, there is a very direct analogy to carbon: Pollution is also a 
negative externality. The people or companies who are clean &ndash;those who 
are not spewing carbon into the air &ndash; are paying for the polluters. And 
this shouldnot be the case. There is no free lunch.</p> 
<p>Julian Robertson, chairman of Tiger Management LLC, has famously stated 
that the simplest way to eliminate diabetes and control the obesity epidemic in 
the US &ndash; in addition to improving the GDP by as much as a trillion 
dollars &ndash; is to institute a sugar and fat tax. Such practices have 
already been applied to tobacco and alcohol, and it should be the same with 
carbon.</p> 
<p>It is not free for an industrial company to pollute rivers, and so it 
follows thatit should not be free to pollute the air.There is no reason that we 
should let individuals or companies do something that we know is harmful 
without having them pay for the damage we collectively incur.</p> 
<p>One way to ensure that a carbon price would not act as a regressive tax 
would be to institute an additional luxury carbon emitter tax. Taxing the 
private yachts, G6s, BMW 7 series, etc., would mean that the wealthy would have 
to pay for using big carbon emitters, and this would help decrease the gap 
between them and those less privileged.<br>
 Another way to approach the issue 
is through initiating feed-in tariffs (FITs). Through feed-in tariffs, 
developers of renewable energy technologies are given incentives, and utilities 
are given a mandate to use these renewable energy sources. While the cost 
incurred by the utilities would initially be passed down to their customersonce 
carbon is priced in the marketplace, renewable energy sources will be 
incorporated on a mass scale, bringing their coststo grid parity, and energy 
prices will go down.</p> 
<p>In China, lung cancer caused by air pollution is now the leading cause of 
death in urban areas. To solve this crisis, China has accelerated their 
renewable energy practices, and will become the leader in solar and wind 
technologies within the next five years. As per China&rsquo;s renewable energy 
law, which will be put in effect in 2011, grid operators will be required to 
purchase electricity from renewable energy producers, and developers of 
alternative energy technologies will be awarded with incentives. The state was 
confronted with a massive problem and has chosen to deal with it head-on. 
Hopefully, the US will not need to reach those crisis levels before going into 
action.</p> 
<p>Pricing carbon is simply the fastest way to become carbon neutral and will 
also lead to some very positive unintended consequences: We would make 
significant headway toward balancing the budget.Firstly, a price on carbon 
emissions would create a revenue stream for the country.Also, the shift to 
better renewable energy practices would help cut the negative financial effects 
of carbon emissions, such as healthcare costs.The added funding of renewable 
energy research would also create much-needed US jobs in the newly emerging 
&ldquo;green&rdquo; sector. The financial benefits alone should push us toward 
such reforms.</p> 
<p>Carbon pricing is not a one-size-fits-all idea.There are many cultural and 
geographic issues that have to be considered. India and China, for example, 
have recently become big polluters, but when you take into consideration that 
the West has been polluting the air for hundreds of years, it becomes clear 
that we cannot now impose identical regulations on them.</p> Share: <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m becoming more and more convinced that the first thing that must 
be done, in the U.S. at any rate, is to get money out of politics somehow. 
Here, it&rsquo;s clearly impossible for the forces advocating carbon neutrality 
to stand a chance in the national debate when big coal, big oil, and their 
shills have virtually limitless resources to flood the airwaves with 
self-serving propaganda. It got a lot worse with the recent Supreme Court 
decision that repealed contribution limits for corporations and unions. This 
last election&ndash;a catastrophe for the climate and many other 
concerns&ndash;saw oceans of secret contributions going into the campaigns of 
the Tea Party candidates, all of whom, as far as I can tell, are scientifically

<p>As a matter of fact, Commissioner Connie Heidegaard in a way gave the

<p>When President Barroso presented his re-election bid to the European 
Parliament, he introduced &ldquo;Europe&rsquo;s transformation agenda&rdquo;. 
The climate change challenges are indeed leading to an historic transformation 
and it should be for the better! It is not only a question of historic 
transformation of our industry, our cities, our transports, our buildings. It 
is also about historic transformation of the EU Institutions relationship with

<p>1. The launching of a reinforced cooperation between some EU Member States

<p>Every time we travel or turn on our computers, every time we travel or turn 
on our computers, we add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This is because 
most of the energy we use comes from fuels like oil, coal, and gas. Other types 
of energy, like solar and wind power, do not contribute to climate change. But 
they are often more expensive.</p> 
<p>Being &ldquo;carbon neutral&rdquo; means removing as much carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere as we put in. How can we remove carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere? The world&rsquo;s leading scientists continue to stress the 
evidence supporting climate change grows stronger with new research. Everyday, 
more people and businesses are becoming aware of the impact of the carbon 
emissions caused by their everyday activities on the environment. Some people 
are aware and doing something about it. But a lot of people think doing a 
little bit is enough. The truth is if you do a little you achieve a little. We 
need to make deep cuts in carbon emissions and help drive investment in 
low-carbon solutions.</p> 
<p>The small country maldives tucked away in India Ocean is an example to the 
whole world for becoming carbon neutral. The plandevelpde here includes a new 
renewable electricity generation and transmission infrastructure with 155 large 
wind turbines, half a square kilometre of rooftop solar panels, and a biomass 
plant burning coconut husks. Battery banks would provide back-up storage for 
when neither wind nor solar energy is available. The clean electricity would 
power not only homes and businesses, but also vehicles. Cars and boats with 
petrol and diesel engines would be gradually replaced by electric versions. If 
this pearl in Indian ocean can achieve this goal, then others can &ndash; 
provided given initiative and drive.</p> 
<p>Here in Tormacon we have initiated a process that all projects undertaken 
must aim at being carbon neutral as far as possible. Our team came up with 
interesting insight how the ofice and factory planning can reduce the carbon 
print. We have adapted the concepts developed by a firm Net Zero. The basic of 
this are:</p> 
<p>Generating energy is much more expensive than conserving it. We ask the 
architects to design the building to be as energy efficient as possible before 
seeking to produce additional energy through on-site renewable sources. The 
design should cut the carbon emissions by 76 percent through energy efficiency, 
with minor additional first costs compared to a conventional office building. 
To get all the way to zero emissions, the designs usually rely on of 
photovoltaic panels spread across the roofs of the office bars and parking 
garage, as well as integrated into the south-facing shading devices.</p> 
<p>With the architecture greatly reducing the HVAC loads, the teams have 
designed an ultra-efficient, in-slab, radiant heating and cooling system that 
is integrated with an under floor air distribution system. As the radiant 
heating and cooling system provides temperature control, the air handling 
systems can be greatly downsized. Operable windows allow for seasonal natural 
ventilation. A raised floor offers flexibility for a multi-tenant layout.</p> 
<p>This scheme emerged from careful studies in which the architects worked 
closely with the energy and day lighting analysts and conducted extensive 
climate studies to establish strict performance parameters. The team&rsquo;s 
mantra was, &ldquo;model, measure, and manage.&rdquo; We have created a model 
of a virtual building, measured its performance at every step, and managed team 
members&rsquo; expectations until we designed a real building that works. 
Characteristics like the building massing, orientation, floor-to-floor height, 
window sizes, and quality of glass and landscaping all are optimized to ensure 
that the building can be illuminated without electricity during daylight hours.
</p> 
<p>Architects can design affordable zero emissions commercial buildings now. 
Instead of designing whimsical structures with high-tech sustainable features 
tacked on, we need to create simpler, more humanistic buildings that fit into 
their neighbourhoods while performing in a way our society so desperately 
needs. Our first-generation carbon neutral buildings will carry great social 
significance while being inherently beautiful.</p> 
<p>Our team found out that designing for carbon neutrality demands integrated, 
unflinching design and analysis, and that nothing is too important to be 
questioned or changed. Our science-based approach challenged the veracity of 
several long-held architectural beliefs:</p> 
<p>The following myths must be avoided at all costs:<br>
 Myth #1: All glass 
buildings are the future of low-energy and low-emissions design.<br>
 Although 
day lighting is the single-most important way to reduce electricity and carbon 
emissions, carbon neutral design requires a precise balance of light and heat. 
To determine the right combination of energy-efficient glazing and insulated 
wall panels, the team modelled the day lighting savings offset by the energy 
penalty of increased floor-to-floor and glass area.</p> 
<p>Myth #2: We can&rsquo;t go wrong by planting trees.<br>
 We quickly 
discovered that placing trees in the wrong places would impede the day lighting 
solution. The landscaping must preserve access to natural light and be 
completely integrated with the building design.</p> 
<p>Myth #3: Photovoltaic panels are effective only in bright, sunny, warm 
climates like California&rsquo;s.<br>
 There is always more than enough sun to 
generate the required on-site solar power, even here in Canada. As a matter of 
fact, the solar panels are more efficient in cooler climates&mdash;heat is 
their enemy.</p> 
<p>Myth #4: Zero emissions aren&rsquo;t possible for a conventional project 
budget.<br>
 The project planning team has come up with the detailed cost 
estimates, with the construction cost is $223 per sq. ft. Annual energy cost 
savings through energy efficiency and solar power is be $185,000 for an average 
office building</p> 
<p>The payback for the investment to reach carbon neutrality compared to our 
baseline building would be 12 years if the rise in fuel costs outpaces general 
inflation by 4 percent a year. The payback would be less than 10 years today in 
the many other areas where electricity is more expensive. Policy changes 
supporting low-carbon and low-energy initiatives, including additional federal 
and state incentives for renewable energy, could bring zero emissions buildings 
much closer to our grasp.</p> 
<p>Similarly there is need to reorient our infrastructure rebuilding. Reaching 
carbon neutrality at some point certain in the future while spending billions 
on large scale highway projects doesn&rsquo;t pass the limus test. 
Sightline&rsquo;s previous research has found that building more roads produces 
more carbon emissions (though GHG modeling for this project does not show a 
significant increase in regional emissions). And a recent inventory of 
Seattle&rsquo;s emissions found that 62 percent of the city&rsquo;s GHG 
emissions are transportation related, with two-thirds of that coming from cars 
and trucks. A highway replacement may not increase emissions, but it does seem 
to lock them in for the long term at a time when local, regional, and state 
governments are supposed to be doing everything they can to encourage use and 
investment in transit and reducing vehicle miles traveled. Going carbon neutral 
does not mean your country never produce any CO2 emissions. What it means is 
that you are not a net contributor to global CO2 emissions. In effect, the 
country does not emit more CO2 than it absorbs.</p> 
<p>Essentailly it is a concerted action by the private sector, regulatory 
bodies , governemnt tax breaks that can go a long way in speeding up the 
transition. What is requierd is vision and will to do so.</p> Share: <br>

<p>My personal opinion on this question is that not much will really happen 
unless governments use quite heavy-handed carrot and stick approaches on 
ordinary businesses and consumers. And with the state of western government 
finances as they are, I suppose penalties are more likely to happen than 
subsidies. But of course this is not going to be popular. The UK government is 
currently having useful discussions with the electricity generators and 
penalties for under-achieving renewable power generation and minimum carbon 
emission prices seem likely. But other areas could include penalising 
householders with inefficient boilers, much higher taxes on car usage and taxes 
on the carbon footprint of various foodstuffs (which are quite well calculated 
these days). Serious market development of new low carbon products and energy 
generation systems is not going to happen until all this is in place and these 
activities would make more sense than excessive government sponsored research 
and development.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Rather than coming up with magical technology X or subsidy mechanism Y, 
getting to an answer on this question requires preliminary reflection on the 
appropriateness and deeper dimensions of its three constituents: carbon 
neutral, speeding up, and really speeding up. With all research done the last 
decades, the growing technological evolution and blooming awareness, it is 
above all important to aim at a realistic view, rather than at a goal that is 
dreamy but hard to attain.<br>
 First of all, should the goal really be to have 
our society neutral on the carbon level? It would obviously be nice, healthy 
and green. But isn&rsquo;t it illusionary to think that this is possible in a 
world that incites countries to reach a minimum level of development, 
industrialization and civilization. Especially with the total product(ion) life 
cycle in mind, it sounds as realistic as stating the current online music 
industry is carbon neutral. The final output may be fine, so do some of the 
intermediaries. But somehow, the entire value chain still needs to be fed, be 
it in people, fuel, energy, primaries&hellip; It would thus be more realistic 
to reflect upon on a carbon moderate society.<br>
 To get there, the different 
aspects should be tackled, each with a specific approach. The two target groups 
that come immediately to mind are Energy, and Industry/production.<br>
 The 
former can be broken down into transportation, heating, and electricity. For 
the latter, the most concerned sectors are heavy primary industries, 
construction and food. In both categories, awareness on carbon is not a 
problem, neither is it a matter of the existence of convincing technologies 
[although the carbon impact needs obviously ongoing improvement].<br>
 The 
determining factor is the mandatory push to application. Mere guidelines need 
to become a more stringent and financially impacting reality, combined with an 
increased R&amp;D support. It is indeed not a technocratic set of fabulous four 
alone that will scale the exhaust down. The larger framework needs to be 
present and put into reality.<br>
 Will this be sufficient in the fight against 
the omnipresent interferences of intra-national interests and cross border 
concerns? No, it won&rsquo;t, especially not with the current economic climate 
that remains the perfect excuse for preventive freezing.<br>
 But five minutes 
of political bravura and years of consequent behavior on the active, adaptive 
and reactive level can make an import difference: taking a clear position, 
setting up the framework to do so, and acting in accordance. Will this 
&lsquo;really&rsquo; speed up the process? When looking at the quite 
illustrative vacuum for the ETS future: yes, clarity and moving on definitely 
will on carbon issues.<br>
 All together, one should thus stay realistic on the 
final goal &ndash; to much dreaming can only lead to diluting debates &ndash; 
and on realism on the &lsquo;speed&rsquo; dimension. A lot changed in the past 
decades. The same is true for the future. Nevertheless, attaining a carbon 
moderate society takes a lot of time. Key is acting, and continuing support. 
Reality is taking decisions. That&rsquo;s real life.</p> Share: <br>

<p>One of the keys to achieving a carbon neutral society is to move towards 
100% renewable energy. This would mean taking carbon out of the power sector by 
replacing fossil fuels with renewable energies such as wind.</p> 
<p>How can we speed up this transition? Europe can increase the amount of 
electricity produced by wind power by</p> 
<p> * creating a single European market in electricity;<br>
 * extending, 
upgrading and better inter-connecting Europe&rsquo;s national grids;<br>

speeding up permitting procedures for wind farms and electricity grids.</p> 
<p>Europe could also raise its greeenhouse gas reduction target from 20% to 
30% now, rather than linking it to international climate negotiations.</p> 
<p>Other useful actions would be to set clear renewable energy targets for 
2030, and to ban carbon from new power plants from 2020. This might seem 
radical, but given the long life of power plants it would be a necessary step 
if the EU really intends to honour its commitment to cut greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 80% by 2050. After all, 80% less CO2 means a carbon free 
power sector as the remaining 20% CO2 will be needed in other sectors such as 
aviation and agriculture.</p> Share: <br>

<p>We must now go beyond becoming a carbon-neutral society to one that is 
carbon-negative. Current climate research suggests that we have likely breached 
the safe limit for the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere. We need to 
bring carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm from their current level of about 387 
ppm. But how can we do that?</p> 
<p>Naturally, emissions from industry, vehicles and households must be brought 
close to zero to accomplish this, and there are many widely discussed ideas for 
doing this. But less often discussed are methods for actually withdrawing 
carbon now in the atmosphere. To do this we must rethink the relationship 
between cities and the countryside and in the process our relationship to the 
soil. This rethinking would help us solve two problems: the need to extract and 
sequester carbon from the atmosphere and the need to rejuvenate the fertility 
of our agricultural soils.</p> 
<p>The philosopher Fran&ccedil;ois-Ren&eacute; de Chateaubriand once said, 
&ldquo;Forests precede civilizations and deserts follow them.&rdquo; This is 
the cycle which we must repeal. Fortunately, there are ways to do just that. 
Cities must now make themselves part of the natural cycle by recycling their 
organic wastes back into the soil. The only practical way for cities to do this 
is once again to rely on the areas surrounding them for their food. It is also 
essential for the nearby farmers who supply them to adopt organic methods that 
build the soil. This cycle and the application of organic methods will actually 
help take carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in the soil in large 
quantities for very long periods.</p> 
<p>Another emerging adjunct to this process is the use of biochar, organic 
materials carbonized outside the presence of oxygen (resulting in a 
charcoal-like product). The incorporation of biochar in soils has been shown to 
increase soil fertility while successfully sequestering carbon. Biochar can be 
helpful, but is not a substitute for the broad conversion of industrial farming 
to smaller scale organic farming.</p> 
<p>Two objections may be raised to this path. One is that some cities would 
have to shrink their size considerably because their surrounding region could 
simply not support their food needs. This is particularly true of cities in 
deserts. The answer to this is that such a shrinkage is inevitable. The 
question is whether such reductions will be planned and gradual or forced and 
chaotic.</p> 
<p>A second objection is that organic farming methods would require us to have 
far more farmers to feed the world. This is true, and it means that those of us

<p>I would like to propose some of my thoughts related to the topic and hope 
only to become a catalyst for discussion. I am not intended to answer the 
question precisely, and exhaustive answer probably even isn&rsquo;t possible.
</p> 
<p>First what I have in mind is a close relation of this idea of carbon 
neutrality with overall consumption pattern of society. Excessive consumption 
is cultivated in all society and induced by mechanisms of free market for a 
long time. These market mechanisms are very strong and reinforced by feedbacks, 
embodied in the principles of liberal economic policies. A market isn&rsquo;t 
something bad in its essence, but, like as most of things, it has the other 
side of the shield. And this other side is overconsumption, in our case &ndash; 
untempered consumption of fossil fuels. But, another spot on the sun of the 
market is frequently puffing and bursting bubbles&hellip;</p> 
<p>Of course, market economy apologists have an answer &ndash; these are only 
some imperfections of the market (market failures); let&rsquo;s apply 
adjustments (CO2 taxes, emission trading schemes, etc.) to the market 
mechanisms, and all things will rearrange in good order. Invisible hand will 
turn right controls in right moment. But let me suppose that these adjusting 
mechanisms are geared too late and are too impotent to make corrections in a 
meaningful time. Fundaments of consumption evolving mechanisms are staying 
intact.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless some forces which are able to make a noise in the world exist. 
Some of them we experienced in action &ndash; and it&rsquo;s ECONOMIC CRISIS. 
Powerful. Impressive. Bulldozer! Several countries are knelt. Like my country 
&ndash; Latvia. But may be it&rsquo;s possible to harness this bulldozer for 
turning market mechanism controls in the right direction? Unfortunately master 
(IMF) which is pre-ordering music, likes classics of 20th century (read &ndash; 
ultra liberal economy), not ascetic Gregorian cantos or ethnic rock.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I assume, a moment for recovery from crisis is the right moment for 
structural reforms in the best sense of the word. Reduction of carbon intensity 
is among real structural reforms needed for countries to have a prospect for 
development, and not reduction of pensions, child care allowances, education 
budget. Of course, I understand &ndash; this is a utopian idea as well as 
carbon neutral society.</p> Share: <br>

<p>How to move to a carbon neutral society is much-debated in Europe and 
globally. But despite a lot of discussion, actual progress proceeds at a 
snail&rsquo;s pace. The climate policy tracker launched by WWF and 
environmental consultancy Ecofys last week showed that only a third of the 
actions needed to achieve the EU&rsquo;s 2050 goals are in place today. So what 
can we do to speed up the transition to a carbon neutral future?</p> 
<p>Energy efficiency is the place to begin. Saving energy is the most 
cost-efficient way of cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Yet despite the logic 
of starting with energy efficiency, it is the (non-binding) 20% energy 
efficiency target which is the 2020 goal most likely to be missed. Although 
some improvements are now in the pipeline following European legislation on 
energy-using products and the energy performance of buildings, there is plenty 
of scope for further action on the demand side, not to mention the potential 
for supply-side improvements to be had from reducing energy losses in 
electricity generation and transmission. &ldquo;Doing more with less&rdquo; is 
the biggest single change required to kick-start progress towards a zero-carbon 
economy.</p> 
<p>The next important aspect to address is energy infrastructure. Most 
transmission and distribution lines in use today were built many decades ago, 
in the age of big coal and nuclear power plants, and are simply not designed to 
cope with the increasing amount of renewable energy fed into the grid from 
dispersed sources, including micro-generation. Upgrading the grid is therefore 
a priority, in order to ensure adequate transmission and distribution systems. 
The grid needs to be equipped with &ldquo;smart&rdquo; technology to optimise 
the balancing of supply and demand, and progress achieved on the issue of 
energy storage. Electric vehicles offer considerable potential for electricity 
storage when demand is low at night, as well as holding the key to 
decarbonising transport, which currently accounts for a quarter of all carbon 
emissions.</p> 
<p>The transition to a carbon neutral society will cost money. The US and 
China may have been reluctant to sign up to GHG reduction targets at Copenhagen 
but they can teach Europe a lesson or two when it comes to investment. Both 
countries have invested billions into green energy whereas the EU has not even 
started discussing how to fund its Strategic Energy Technology Plan, the 
initiative designed to accelerate development, demonstration and deployment of 
low carbon technologies. Funding is also crucial for improving energy 
efficiency in buildings, which account for around 40% of EU carbon emissions. 
Several EU countries are putting in place upfront &ldquo;pay as you save&rdquo; 
funding mechanisms, be it through utilities, government schemes or commercial 
banks, but there is still no requirement on Member States to make such funding 
mechanisms available.</p> 
<p>In other areas the slowness of progress boils down to a lack of capacity 
and prioritisation. Dynamic labelling of energy-using products produces 
substantial energy savings but the current Eco-design Directive is behind 
schedule and lacks ambition. Regulation needs to go hand in hand with education 
and communication to ensure public buy-in for energy-saving products. Also 
essential is a real behavioural shift with regard to wasting energy, akin to 
the shift that has taken place in relation to drink-driving and smoking in 
public places.</p> 
<p>Perhaps what is ultimately required to speed up the transmission to a 
carbon neutral society is a bit less self-satisfaction on the European side. We 
should take on board the fact that the US and China are currently moving faster 
in many respects than the EU and that far from leading the green revolution, we 
are in danger of playing catch-up and losing jobs and competitiveness to other 
parts of the world.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Many people now have a better understanding of the relationship between 
their actions and the effect they have on the environment. This has led some to 
take more responsibility, changing their behaviour towards more 
&lsquo;environmentally friendly&rsquo; activities. The impact of these 
individual choices, especially when such actions become popularised and 
widespread, will no doubt play an important role as we move towards a lower 
carbon way of life, but a quick transition to a carbon neutral society will 
require a much more coordinated response. Personal reductions pale into 
insignificance when compared to global emissions from carbon heavy industries 
such as power generation, transport and agriculture. In addition, the lifestyle 
changes we would have to make as individuals in the Western world are so great 
they are unlikely to arise from personal choice alone; I expect there are few 
who would willingly opt for a lower quality of life.</p> 
<p>Where individual actions fall short legislation comes into play. 
Governments, on a domestic and international scale, have the power to 
incentivise or restrict both individuals and industry. While COP15 was 
generally seen as a failure, the UK government has acted unilaterally in 
implementing the Climate Change Act with binding carbon emission reduction 
targets. Historically, legislation has always fallen short of what is 
recommended by science. Current targets within the UK, whilst sounding 
impressive, only follow the level recommended to give a 50% chance of avoiding 
disaster. It would take a brave leader to risk their own popularity by 
implementing the widely unpopular decisions needed to fully decarbonise.</p> 
<p>Whether we like it or not we live in a world where the market dictates what 
will survive and what will fail. On an international scale a change in our 
economic accounting of natural resources would fundamentally change our 
approach to them. Currently green consumption choices are largely down to the 
individual and almost always more costly. They are therefore left to conscience 
and the ability to afford them. When we price the environment into our 
accounting systems, polluting activities gain an economic burden, giving a true 
cost to their impacts. Unfortunately such a change is only possibly through 
international cooperation and new legislation, again leaving us reliant on 
governments. However there is, I believe, a way in which market decisions can 
lead us to a low carbon approach, without a reliance on the strength of 
environmental conscience or strict legislation that is unlikely to come.</p> 
<p>The key is the development of a commercially attractive solution. Hope that 
new technologies will be adopted simply because they are cleaner relies too 
strongly on public, business and government desire for green options. A clean 
technology that performs the same function at a lower cost will be rapidly 
adopted, not because of its environmental credentials but simply because it is 
cheaper. The development of low carbon technologies that are commercially 
preferable would lead to wide scale adoption without a reliance on the 
environmental argument. Instead of an insurmountable challenge, perhaps the 
need to decarbonise our society should be seen as a promising technological 
opportunity.</p> 
<p>Recent years have seen an impressive rate of technological achievement in 
computing and communications. Should the same resources and innovation be 
applied to clean technologies we would surely see a rapid change in energy 
generation, transport and the other industries that contribute most to our 
current emissions. Whilst the financial gain of developing the new technologies 
that will underpin these sectors is undoubtable, all new innovations carry a 
development period. We need to ensure there is adequate support for emerging 
technologies and the role of popular understanding and government support 
should not be underestimated. As has been seen throughout history, need will 
drive new innovation and I have every belief that development is already 
underway on the new technologies that will drive our low carbon future.</p>

<p>In my view, achieving a carbon neutral society will require the uptake of 
emerging technologies within the power generating sector. Right now we need a 
truly scalable solution that works across the board with various industries, 
built with the fundamental economics of clean power production in mind.</p> 
<p>Our efforts should first focus on the industries that make the largest 
contribution to carbon emissions &ndash; energy generators. Innovations that 
work towards lowering consumption on the individual or local scale have their 
place but they are simply not large enough to cause the fundamental shift 
required. Going back to the source of how we produce our electricity in the 
first place is the only way in which change can occur. Clean electricity at 
source feeds downstream, negating the urgent need for significant changes in 
consumption and infrastructure. It provides a common sense transitional 
solution if we are really serious about reducing carbon emissions urgently.</p> 
<p>The consequential benefits from doing this go way beyond the energy sector. 
As we begin to implement efficient low carbon electricity on a large scale, we 
start to reduce the carbon emissions from other key sectors such as transport, 
including cars, trains and HGV&rsquo;s. An electric car, for example, 
engineered to be lightweight, strong and recyclable, provides a technological 
solution to a low carbon lifestyle when powered by clean electricity.</p> 
<p>If technologies for reducing carbon emissions are a profit opportunity 
rather than a cost burden a constructive tension will naturally speed up the 
transition. Developing and implementing technologies which reduce the cost of 
producing low carbon electricity, coupled with long term guaranteed government 
subsidies funded by a small levy on electricity users, should naturally 
accelerate the introduction of these solutions.</p> 
<p>This approach is specifically not aimed at a renewable energy solution as 
this is fundamentally not capable of meeting the base-load requirements for the 
next 50 years or so. During this time we have to see a responsible utilisation 
of fossil fuels; eliminating energy penalties for carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) and seeking new technologies that efficiently enable a large scale roll 
out of low carbon generating technology. This is especially true in the 
utilisation of coal since whether we like it or not, this industry will 
continue to expand over the next several decades.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Achieving a carbon neutral society is a big challenge but one we must find 
a way of meeting and soon. To get there we&rsquo;re going to need to completely 
change the way we operate, particularly when it comes to producing energy.</p> 
<p>Renewables will one day be the answer but won&rsquo;t be ready, at least on 
the scale we need it, for a good few decades. Nuclear is deeply unpopular and 
highly costly, it will only ever make a small contribution towards reducing our 
emissions. Therefore in the meantime, we have to work with what we have &ndash; 
fossil fuels. Using these fuels in the way we currently do has serious 
consequences and for that reason we have to find a new way to use them cleanly 
and responsibly.</p> 
<p>This means finding a method that stops fossil fuels releasing CO2, which 
can happen through the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) power 
plants. Back in May the newly formed coalition government announced a clear 
commitment to investing in CCS technology for four coal-fired power stations as 
well as a focus on the importance of promoting &lsquo;the green industries that 
are so essential for our future&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Project 1 will be a post-combustion project, capturing CO2 emissions from 
the flue gas of a coal burning power station in Longannet, Scotland. 
Post-combustion technology may play an important role as it provides an 
abatement solution to the existing power stations that are emitting tonnes of 
CO2 every day. But, this is a sticking plaster for old technology not a 
forward-looking solution; it is also costly and inefficient and therefore 
unlikely to lead to the widespread adoption of CCS.</p> 
<p>Projects 2-4 should be dedicated to exploring new approaches. Carbon 
capture technologies need to be clean, efficient and low-cost. This competition 
is an opportunity to develop a world leading template that will be rolled out 
across the globe. Let&rsquo;s not look in the old places, at the old solutions, 
let&rsquo;s look forward and be brave. The UK has a real opportunity to become 
a world-leader on CCS and enjoy all the related benefits for the nation&rsquo;s 
economy in terms of expertise, the adoption of British technology and the 
creation of UK-wide manufacturing jobs.</p> 
<p>Investment in low-carbon technologies will bring huge economic benefits 
both regionally and nationally and will allow the UK government to realise its 
ambition to become a green leader. The cost of this ambition is likely to be 
significantly less than the cost of inaction. Far from being an avoidable 
expense, the CCS sector has the potential to create thousands of UK jobs and 
contribute billions of pounds to our economy while helping to ensure a carbon 
neutral society.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Most of us could be persuaded that a carbon neutral society is a good 
thing, as much for the conservation of raw materials for future use as in 
mitigation of climate change.</p> 
<p>A key issue however is the systemic nature of the problem and the 
systematic nature of the education, analytical and behavioural aspects of 
individuals who live and consume in most developed markets. We are trained to 
identify and address specific issues rather than trace their causes back to 
underlying issues. So, we respond to quick fixes such as reduced consumption 
vehicles, turning the lights off, recycling etc while at the same time 
expecting continued economic growth exemplified by consumption of more items, 
greater freedom to travel and more accumulated wealth for our pensions.</p> 
<p>I suspect the hidden carbon costs of our lifestyles are far greater than 
those obvious to us and, until we become aware of these underlying effects, we 
will struggle to achieve any significant improvement in them, prefering instead 
to delegate that responsibility to others such as governments, corporations and 
markets.</p> 
<p>One method of unlocking this mental trap is through educating children to 
think in more critical and systemic ways. However, this is a long-term approach 
with no guaranteed outcome to a rather immediate problem.</p> 
<p>The more direct approach would be to recognise that most of us naturally 
resist giving up things we believe we already possess rather than speculate on 
gains that may turn out not to be realistic. Appropriate choices need to impact 
us directly. So, we must differentiate between all behaviours and activities 
that generate carbon cost and those that do not and apply direct costs to 
undesirable activities. This must include travel (train versus plane), pensions 
(high carbon investments versus low carbon investments), energy sources 
(electricity versus gas, renewable versus non etc) with the cost applied to one 
directly credited as a subsidy to the alternative.</p> 
<p>Then, we will be faced with real choices in every aspect of our lives with 
genuine, cost effective alternatives to carbon costly activities. Consumers 
will start making impactful choices very quickly, organisations will rapidly 
develop alternatives to avoid being left behind and market subsidies will 
quickly disappear as subsidy funding, carbon costly activities die out and 
beneficial activities achieve cost efficiencies to replace diminishing 
subsidies.</p> 
<p>The current reaction of many is that taxes are applied to undesirable 
activities such as motoring but these are diverted or squandered but no viable 
alternatives are offered e.g. the lamentable option of public transport in 
London and the South East. These contradictory messages accumulate and 
contribute to cynicism and sense of powerlessness amongst the group most able 
to address the issue and as always, it takes much more effort to undo a current 
idea than to promote a new one.</p> 
<p>Since innovation tends to favour the funded i.e. the well off can buy new, 
efficient stuff while the poor are stuck with old tech, care is required to 
ensure that viable options are developed for everyone. Preferably with 
disporportionate benefits for those most in need.</p> 
<p>To prevent bundled activities, e.g. retail incentives, distorting the 
outcome, I believe we should follow the German example which prohibits sale of 
items at below cost.</p> 
<p>I personally would prefer to promote change through education, well argued 
persuasion and development of an enlightened public. Sadly, I think time is too 
short and we need to be steered by our baser motives.</p> Share: <br>

<p>My answer:<br>
 Transparency and Cooperation:</p> 
<p>For example:<br>
 Both North Africa and the EU stand to gain tremendous 
value if there is some way we can get all of the potential countries, equipment 
vendors, constructors, raw energy providers to recognize that there is room for 
a world changing win for everyone if we can work together to orchestrate proper 
integration and balancing of the resources and by products.<br>
 By working 
together, across sectors, and bringing the visionary level people together to 
see past this quarter into next year and beyond, there is a very real 
possibility of getting clean and green power to the EU from Africa at prices 
comparable to 1990 US Electricity prices. This could even be accomplished with 
a net zero carbon footprint within 10-15 years. Notwithstanding politics, 
misunderstandings and a few other minor, (sic), details, I could pencil out a 
plan that could be developed using the Principles of Essential Sustainability 
today.</p> 
<p> The greatest barrier is people&rsquo;s lack of access to a transparent and 
cogent master plan. We cannot expect fundamentalist legacy power generators and 
operators, or green technology advocates to see what is invisible to their 
consciousness. This is made even more difficult by the reality of what has 
worked so well for so long. There is also a lack of any clear model for what 
can integrate into the legacy system that will not cost jobs or reliability. 
There are many of the greatest technologies; intelligence and intents 
distributed among the various project(s) and equipment providers. Many live in 
fear of losing a technology or strategic advantage. This fear is causing so 
much negative inertia that no one is gaining anything in a situation where the 
implementation could make a huge difference in a global economic recovery. 
Imagine the northern Sahara looking like the Imperial Valley in California, 
(Without Californians.:)) and the EU selling a 100s of billions of dollars of 
new equipment that can be paid for out of the energy savings we can generate. 
We end up with Energy, Jobs, Food and Water, all at pre 2000 prices, and the 
ability to maintain those prices at less than EU100/MWh escalated at cost of 
living for the foreseeable future.</p> 
<p>The only invention required is how to get along with each other long enough 
for all of us to win.</p> Share: <br>

<p>I would like to take the question to a wider platform because I have 
concerns that if we get too fixated on the issue of carbon we might miss 
needing to respond to other major challenges. Yes, carbon is a major issue but 
with a world population of 6 billion or so already blighting our planet and the 
expectation of there being 9 plus billion in just 40 years from now, we must 
show equal concern to other major issues.</p> 
<p>The real question is now can we hope that nine billion plus people will be 
able to live in dry, warm environments and have enough food to eat? What we 
need to aspire to is a low carbon, sustainable society. The Business Council

sustainable solutions needed to realize the Vision, what are the critical 
enablers and constraints: for business, policy-makers, and consumers?</p> 
<p>Enablers:</p> 
<p>&#61607; If the whole lifecycle cost of a product could be explained to us 
in terms of sustainability, we might start to change our behavior and 
expectations, and business might respond to that.<br>
 &#61607; To drive and 
speed up business change, we need a globally agreed framework for pricing 
carbon.<br>
 &#61607; Need to redefine the measures of success for business, 
which should not always be driven by growth but other performance factors<br>
 
&#61607; Availability of low risk finance for low carbon investment or a self 
financing business model.<br>
 &#61607; Policy makers need to articulate and 
create the need for urgency to change amongst consumers; also that a different 
way of life does not mean a worst way of life.<br>
 &#61607; We need better 
governance across the world, particularly to help business invest in Africa and 
Asia.<br>
 &#61607; We also need to change how we incentivize consumers, e.g. 
on personal water or carbon budgets.<br>
 &#61607; To change belief and 
understanding: we need education and role models, including education for all 
&ndash; consumers, governments and business leaders.<br>
 &#61607; Get 
sustainability into the headlines of the daily mails.<br>
 &#61607; Learn from 
marketing and advertising industries, as they have fantastic success in making 
people change their behaviors.<br>
 &#61607; Re climate change &ndash; to have 
a global agreement with firm targets.<br>
 &#61607; Need for more common values 
in terms of how business operates and politicians to have a system based on 
gross national happiness as opposed to gross domestic product.<br>
 &#61607; A 
shift in taxation would drive behavioral change.<br>
 &#61607; The big change 
is to shift to citizen obligation from consumer desire.<br>
 &#61607; Making 
sustainable behavior more mainstream by benchmarking it.</p> 
<p>Constraints:</p> 
<p>&#61607; Lack of an integrated system &ndash; we are not business or 
consumers or policy makers. Most of us are all three.<br>
 &#61607; The biggest 
danger is that we wait for one of the other hats (business, government, 
consumers) to take action.<br>
 &#61607; Governments don&rsquo;t have the 
strongest influence as they tend to be driven by short term cycles and fear of 
re-election. We need general consensus amongst politicians to end up with more 
consistent long term policies.<br>
 &#61607; We don&#8223;t have a proper 
global agreement to the greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
 &#61607; Have we got a 
competent government? Do we need to improve the level of governance and the 
competence of people on both, the civil service and political side?<br>
 
&#61607; The need for legislation is not just to be limited but to be systemic 
in all that governments do<br>
 &#61607; Lack of costing of externalities.<br>
 
&#61607; Inconsistency in governments &ndash; they can&rsquo;t make up their 
mind what the regulations are.</p>

and change in behaviors?<br>

drives consumers.<br>
 &#61607; Ethics is fundamental to driving success in 
changing consumers.<br>
 &#61607; This is a global issue and we need to focus 
on the needs of developing as well as developed regions, and we need to make

presented<br>

<p>In late 2009, the United Nations quietly published a strategy paper 
describing what may be the most powerful single intervention in the global 
endgame on carbon. (I led the writing of this paper as a consultant to the 
United Nations Division of Sustainable Development, but the ideas largely came 
from other people, inside and outside the UN system.) Called the &ldquo;Big 
Push,&rdquo; the strategy builds around three key elements:</p> 
<p>(1) Establishing feed-in tariff mechanisms globally (that is, 
guaranteed-purchase price supports for renewable energy)</p> 
<p>(2) Investing heavily in renewable energy in the developing world through 
those mechanisms, and</p> 
<p>(3) Providing an array of technical and policy support services to speed 
adoption and implementation.</p> 
<p>Pursuing such a strategy would help the world decarbonize much more 
quickly, because it would accelerate the drop in price for renewables 
dramatically, using the enormous scales of the market for energy in developing 
countries &mdash; who urgently need clean, affordable energy services most. The 
logic here also builds on historical examples, such as the rapid drop in 
computer chip prices that was engineered by the U.S. government through its 
purchasing policy in the 1960s.</p> 
<p>Economic modeling demonstrated that a &ldquo;Big Push&rdquo; strategy, 
while it looked expensive relative to the levels of aid and investment on offer 
in the global negotiating process, paid enormous dividends. Per capita incomes 
would rise much faster than a business-as-usual scenrio &mdash; in every region 
of the world. The poorest developing countries would experience a massive 
uplift in incomes, and even the already wealthy countries would get wealthier. 
The &ldquo;Big Push&rdquo; of initial subsidies would result in renewable 
energy becoming the default investment option (without any subsidy) in just 
10-20 years, at a price affordable to all.</p> 
<p>So why is this idea not on the table now?</p> 
<p>First, the dollar figures probably look scary. Renewable energy will 
eventually become fully competitive with fossil fuels anyway; it&rsquo;s just 
not happening fast enough. To make it happen &ldquo;fast enough&rdquo; requires 
placing orders for about a thousand extra gigawatts of solar energy (over what 
the market would generate on its own), and 100-200 extra GW of wind energy, as 
soon as possible, at an investment cost of USD 1 to 1.5 trillion, spread over 
ten years or so.</p> 
<p>That sounds like a lot of money. But it equates to about 10 years of what 
was already pledged at Copenhagen ($100 billion annually), and only two years 
of U.S. defense spending. And the paybacks, once again, are enormous: improved 
incomes, better quality of life, and reduced climate risk, all around the world.
</p> 
<p>And it would happen about as fast as one could possibly imagine, in real 
political, economic, and technical terms. The &ldquo;Big Push&rdquo; would help 
renewable, carbon-free energy get over the hump of initial investment costs, 
after which the market would kick into overdrive, as it did for computer chips.
</p> 
<p>What about the risks? Deutsche Bank, working with the UN 
Secretary-General&rsquo;s Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change, has 
already through the details of the investment scheme that would be necessary, 
including the insurance and risk management, in their &ldquo;GET FiT&rdquo; 
program (&ldquo;Global Energy Transfer Feed-in Tariffs for Developing 
Countries&rdquo;), published in April of 2010.</p> 
<p>What about the capacity issues in these countries? There the Big Push 
strategy looks to the successful example of the Green Revolution, with its army 
of technical experts, extension workers, trainers, and support mechanisms of 
other kinds, which helped whole countries retool their agricultural systems 
with amazing speed.</p> 
<p>And finally, what about the politics? How hard is to roll out a feed-in 
tariff program globally? The answer is, it&rsquo;s already happening. Country 
by country, feed-in tariff mechanisms are already law (well over 50 countries 
already have it), or in the process of becoming law, in countries as diverse as 
Kenya, Egypt, Serbia, and Byelorussia.</p> 
<p>The economics works. The technology is there. The political mechanisms are 
already moving into place. What&rsquo;s lacking, then? Only a shared vision 
that we really can pull together, and push hard on a big problem.</p> 
<p>There are obviously many things we need to do to create a carbon-neutral 
society. But for accelerating the process, I see no better candidate than the 
Big Push.</p> Share: <br>

<p>You cannot pick up a paper or listen to the radio or watch TV without 
experiencing a story about carbon emissions, or sustainability. I have been a 
professional in the energy sector for over 30 years and I have watched with 
great interest and investment in the ebb and flow of the public discourse on 
energy. Going back to the oil embargo of the early 1970&rsquo;s through Three 
Mile Island and the Exxon Valdez. Every time there is a lead news story 
that&rsquo;s connected to energy the energy discussion comes to a crescendo and 
then fades into the background as business as usual proceeds.</p> 
<p>In recent years there has been a much more widespread conversation about 
global warming, or is it climate change from Al Gore&rsquo;s movie to data 
around ice melting at the poles to unstable weather patterns that has put 
energy back in the forefront in a larger and should I say it, more sustainable 
way.</p> 
<p>The issue is very complex and far too many people who actively discuss it 
are far too uninformed or ill informed. Here are some examples: LEED certified 
buildings will reduce our energy consumption. LEED certified new buildings are 
built with a sustainability eye. That means long term sustainability with 
reduced consumption of materials, and to some extent energy. The reality is 
that many LEED certified buildings have few true energy efficiency elements 
integrated into their designs and their energy consumption is not much 
different than a non-LEED certified building.</p> 
<p>Many US college and university presidents have signed onto the Climate 
Commitment to make their campuses carbon neutral. Really? Carbon neutral? At 
what cost? They could buy enough credits to offset campus carbon emissions but 
is that carbon neutral? What is carbon neutral? What are renewable energy 
sources? The rules and context are changing daily. Recycled wood is considered 
a renewable energy source, until it&rsquo;s not. Landfill gas is a renewable 
energy. Landfill gas relies upon more garbage being put into landfills to decay 
into landfill gas. Is that a sustainable approach?</p> 
<p>Wind and solar and electric cars are all intended to reduce the carbon 
footprint. However electric cars and plug in hybrids today recharge at night 
and in the US that means about 50% of the power produced is coal based, not 
carbon neutral. Wind farms are being installed in areas with high enough winds 
to have about a 30% capacity factor or higher. That means producing rated power 
about 30% of the time. What do you do the rest of the time? Backup power has to 
be available and that tends to be again, coal or possibly nuclear. Plus in the 
Midwest much of this wind production has been and is being installed in areas 
with limited power transmission and distribution systems as they are sparsely 
populated. In fact much of the wind generation in the Midwest gets curtailed 
daily as transmission and distribution capacity is limited from these areas.</p>
<p>Solar power is another avenue. Again not all the time. Ignoring regions 
with few days of sun no one will debate the fact that the sun does not shine at 
night. Then what? Back-up power is again necessary. And again that falls back 
to coal or nuclear.</p> 
<p>Of course the stock response is energy storage. OK, what technology? What 
scale? And more importantly at what cost?</p> 
<p>I hate to sound like a Luddite, I am not. I think the energy future 
includes many new approaches but before we can really say we are on the right 
path people have to completely redesign how we use energy and how we design and 
how we live. And how likely is that?</p> 
<p>A quick and simple example. Forty percent of energy consumed is for 
building comfort. Let&rsquo;s look at a residential model. We all have 
refrigerators in our homes. Refrigerators remove heat from food and reject it 
to the living space. In the winter that&rsquo;s handy as it adds to heating the 
space (unless of course you open and close your refrigerator a lot). In the 
Summer months that rejected heat adds to the cooling load for air conditioned 
space. Why don&rsquo;t we design living spaces from an integrated energy 
approach. Space heating should be tied to domestic hot water heating and using 
reject heat from refrigerators, for example. But how likely is that on a wide 
scale basis?</p> 
<p>The answer for me to speed up transition to a more energy conscious society 
is to start educating our children from the very beginning how they use energy 
and how they can use less. Make it important to be well versed in science and 
technology so as to avoid buying the frequently offered snake oil solutions and 
be able to make educated choices.</p> 
<p>Will we ever be carbon neutral. I don&rsquo;t think so but we certainly can 
and should be far more energy conscious.</p> Share: <br>

<p>The question, &ldquo;What would it take to really speed up the transition 
to a carbon neutral society?&rdquo;, begs a multi-faceted response. I&rsquo;ll 
address your question by asking you to accept my usage of the following, 
interchangeably, with your question: &ldquo;What would it take to really speed 
up the transition to a sustainable planet?&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ll accept my substitution of the words, then, here&rsquo;s my 
response.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m responding from the following perspectives&hellip;</p> 
<p>First and foremost, we must consider the population of our planet, coupled 
with human consumption. As we become more technologically-advanced, introducing 
more and more new gadgets, we increase our dependence on, and, our degradation 
of, our planet&rsquo;s resources.</p> 
<p>I was born in 1953, and, with the planet&rsquo;s population then at roughly 
three billion human inhabitants, we imposed significantly less burden on the 
earth&rsquo;s resources. Life was simpler then, and we had less 
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo;. We used, and relied on, dramatically less resources.</p> 
<p>More humans, having ever more offspring, means more houses, more cars, more 
food, more iPods, more iPhones, more xBoxes, more dogs, more cats, with each 
house or dwelling requiring more power, which requires more infrastructure for 
power distribution, more streets, more sewer systems, more water treatment 
plant capacity, etc.</p> 
<p>I mentioned that I just returned from a western Caribbean cruise. On that 
cruise ship were 4500 other human beings, all being fed with food requiring 
refrigeration, powered by petroleum. Each cabin, of which there were possibly 
200 on each of 6 of the 13 decks, had a TV hanging on the wall. Each cabin 
included furniture, cabinetry, and various materials, including wood, plastics, 
and metal. The uppermost deck had a 40-foot by 20-foot big screen TV. Why? 
Because cruise lines use such enticements to get people to leave home (so they 
can experience ALL the comforts of home).</p> 
<p>The ship, I was told, weighed 130,000 tons, and measured 1004 feet in 
length. How much tonnage of the earth&rsquo;s materials were displaced to build 
that single ship?</p> 
<p>That was just one of the many ships sailing that part of the earth&rsquo;s 
waters, in that period of time.</p> 
<p>I recently read a report stating that buildings, both commercial and 
residential, account for 30% of all energy use in the US. I believe the US 
automobile fleet accounts for nearly the same amount of energy use. The 
developing world wants to live just like we do in America, which means more 
consumption (by all 7 BILLION inhabitants).</p> 
<p>To &ldquo;turn this ship around&rdquo;, so to speak, we must do the 
following:</p> 
<p>&bull; Curb population growth in all regions of our planet<br>
 &bull; Grow 
food locally, and, organically<br>
 &bull; Raise all feed livestock 
responsibly, humanely and organically<br>
 &bull; Retrofit all existing 
buildings with energy-efficient technologies<br>
 &bull; Build ONLY 
LEED-certified commercial and residential structures to reduce energy 
consumption<br>
 &bull; Dramatically improve automobile fuel-economy, by double 
the current standards (Michael C. Ruppert, in his latest book, Confronting 
Collapse, points out that every tire, of which there are at least five on<br>
 
each car, requires 30 gallons of oil to manufacture &ndash; that&rsquo;s 150 
gallons of oil being used just to allow a car to roll on down the road)<br>
 
&bull; Increase population density in all new urban development, lessening the 
burden on rural and forested areas<br>
 &bull; End all subsidies and tax breaks 
for chemically-intensive and irresponsible food and livestock production<br>
 
&bull; End all subsidies and tax breaks for uncontrolled and irresponsible 
(non-sustainable) land development<br>
 &bull; Reduce military spending by 50% 
immediately, and, phase down from there, thereby ending our costly protection 
of (other countries&rsquo;) natural resources and fossil fuels the US needs to 
satisfy our rampant consumption<br>
 &bull; Implement tax breaks and incentives 
for:<br>
 o Reduction of resources now used in manufacturing products and 
durable goods<br>
 o Re-use of existing processed materials,<br>
 o successful 
Recycling of existing processed materials<br>
 o the purchase of products and 
durable goods made from post-consumer recycled materials<br>
 o the purchase of 
products and durable goods made with NO toxic chemicals and made producing no 
VOC&rsquo;s (volatile organic compounds)<br>
 &bull; implement true and 
meaningful campaign reform, ending powerful corrupting influence by moneyed 
interests who continually work to retain the &ldquo;status quo&rdquo;, which 
costs ALL of society and our planet, while enriching the powerful few at the top
</p> 
<p>Obviously, I&rsquo;ve only touched on a few of the potentially thousands of 
areas we could change in addressing how to really speed up the transition to a 
carbon neutral society.</p>

<p>For almost twenty years, as the science became progressively more precise 
and frightening, we have assumed that the only way to get to a low-carbon 
&ndash; and ideally a carbon neutral &ndash; society was to reach a global 
agreement whereby the world&rsquo;s nations would agree to act on the basis of 
clear targets, with the burden shared out on an equitable basis among them and 
a functioning carbon market that would seek the most cost-effective way to 
reduce emissions.</p> 
<p>Copenhagen put paid to that hope. We may achieve these aims, but not in the 
short-term, and we may only have the short-term &ndash; or at most the 
medium-term &ndash; available to us if we are to act on reducing atmospheric 
carbon in time to avoid catastrophic and irreversible climate change.</p> 
<p>Does this mean we should give up on the UNFCCC process, abandon the 
succession of mega-conferences in exciting cities and resorts and await the 
inevitable in the comfort of our homes and offices? It does not. First, while a 
comprehensive, ambitious and binding agreement appears out of reach, there are 
many areas of international climate cooperation that are moving forward and 
others that are close to a breakthrough &ndash; REDD +, agriculture, climate 
finance, MRV and others appear within reach or are already underway in a fairly 
satisfactory manner. It is not enough to turn the tanker around, but it is 
enough to keep hope alive and make continuing negotiations worthwhile.</p> 
<p>The better news comes from the growing efforts being made at the local, 
regional or enterprise level to cut emissions and to favour low-carbon 
development. All over the world, municipalities, companies, states or provinces 
are showing willing to go well beyond what their own governments are prepared 
to do. The Western Climate Initiative linking several US States and Canadian 
Provinces in a shared climate action programme is just one example. So too is 
the case of the 25 major corporations that signed a letter asking to US 
president to take more resolute action to lower global carbon emissions. And 
there are literally hundreds of towns and villages all over the world who have 
taken a pledge to address their own contribution to climate action.</p> 
<p>This is encouraging and it is a high priority to identify the successes, 
work out how they can be replicated and, where possible, significantly scaled 
up. We need a bottom-up groundswell that overwhelms (and shames) our 
recalcitrant governments into action and an effort focused on this level might 
pay more dividends than lobbying our government representatives in Copenhagen, 
Canc&uacute;n or Durban. But neither is this enough.</p> 
<p>There are, unfortunately, many reasons why the transition to a carbon 
neutral society is proceeding at a frustratingly slow pace. These have to do 
with the policy frameworks in place and that give encouragement to industry and 
to the consumer to prefer carbon-based production and consumption over the 
alternatives. Three examples will suffice:</p> 
<p>First, subsidies to fossil fuels run at over $500 billion per year &ndash; 
a sum that, if directed at the low-carbon transition, might take us a long way 
towards a carbon-neutral society. Instead, it offers a strong incentive to move 
the other way. Efforts are afoot in the G-20, in APEC and elsewhere to phase 
out at least the most egregious of these subsidies but this effort is slow to 
take off.</p> 
<p>Second, the conditions that govern international investment often 
discourage investment in clean energy. For example, if a government changes its 
legislation to favour investment in renewables, those invested in traditional 
energy can argue that this represents indirect expropriation of their own 
investment and seek compensation. Any dispute of this sort is likely to be 
heard in an international arbitration tribunal, behind closed doors, and on the 
basis of commercial considerations alone. The public policy goal of lowered GHG 
emissions is not likely to be relevant to the case. At the very least, this has 
a significant &ldquo;chill effect&rdquo; on potential investors in clean energy.
</p> 
<p>Finally, even though there are endless opportunities for investors in clean 
energy &ndash; especially in the developing world &ndash; too many things (in 
addition to subsidies and investment rules) combine to scare the investor off. 
These relate mostly to the domestic energy policies in the host country. Energy 
pricing regimes, monopolies over energy distribution, preferences for domestic 
producers, and many other factors end up discouraging investors.</p> 
<p>If we really want to speed the transition to a carbon neutral society, we 
would be foolish to pin our hopes on the UNFCCC process. The bottom-up 
initiatives taken by many all around the world are worthy and they should be 
replicated and scaled up to the extent possible. But we will not truly cross 
the bridge to a carbon neutral society until we can put in place a policy 
framework that favours it. This, in my view, should be our highest priority.</p>

<p>I was asked to provide some reflexions upon this topic, and I offer the 
following comments:</p> 
<p>Challenges:<br>
 &bull; Limiting anthropogenic GHG emissions in a manner 
which would put a halt on global warming<br>
 &bull; Finding new ways of 
generating and distributing electric power with minimal GHG emissions<br>
 
&bull; Near/mid term substitution of crude oil as a source for transportation 
fuels and chemical industry feedstock<br>
 &bull; Long term substitution of 
natural gas as a source for transportation fuels and chemical industry feedstock
<br> &bull; Long term substitution of coal as a source for transportation fuels 
and chemical industry feedstock<br>
 &bull; Possibilities to avoid GHG 
emissions from the use of fossil fuels<br>
 &bull; Possibilities to provide a 
foolproof solution concerning nuclear waste<br>
 &bull; Development of the 
large potentials for renewable electric power care should not erode the 
availability of fuels for mobile applications<br>
 &bull; Utilizing waste and 
other biomass resources in an optimal manner, maximizing net fuel output per 
tonne of waste, or per hectare of land<br>
 &bull; Finding political solutions 
which would support the solution of all of the above indicated targets<br>
 
Generally speaking energy supply is not really a problem. Available direct or 
indirect solar power will meet all energy demands. The problem is rather that 
fossil based fuels still provide cheaper energy than different renewable 
resources. The simple solution is, of course, the worldwide introduction of a 
tax regime which makes renewable energy commercially more attractive than 
fossil fuels. For some mobile applications &ndash; aircraft, ships, and long 
distance road traffic we, however, still have the challenge of developing 
sufficiently efficient energy carriers. This subject deserves special 
attention. It is essential to very carefully household with renewable resources 
which could be used to provide transportation fuels for mentioned applications. 
Burning biomass to provide heat and electricity is clearly not the right way to 
go in the long term. Available resources should instead be used in a manner 
which maximizes the availability of transportation fuels and also required 
chemical industry feedstock.</p> 
<p>Potential solutions:</p> 
<p>Worldwide harmonized minimum tax for all fossil fuels. Tax to be levied on 
GHG emissions per unit of energy consumed, and should be high enough to make 
renewable options competitive. No differentiation depending upon fuel user 
(industries, homes, agriculture, or transportation sector). Such a scheme 
cannot, of course, be introduced over night, but the sooner the better. The 
fuel tax income should be primarily earmarked fuel and energy infrastructure 
developments, also for required modifications of chemical industry production 
facilities.</p> 
<p>The list over renewable alternatives requiring government funding includes 
production units for renewable electric power, required improvements of 
electric grid system, infrastructure for powering of electric vehicles, 
production units for renewable fuels or energy carriers, required improvements 
of gas grid system, gas liquefaction facilities, distribution systems for 
liquefied gas, infrastructure for refuelling of gas powered vehicles, and 
modifications of chemical industry plants. The term &lsquo;gas&rsquo; in the 
previous sentence should be interpreted as encompassing hydrogen as well as 
methane. For aircraft there might also be a need to substitute oil based jet 
fuel with another synthetic liquid fuel produced from renewable resources.</p> 
<p>The option which in the short term would have the greatest potential to 
limit CO2 emissions, and reduce the dependence upon oil, is methane &ndash; 
initially mainly natural gas, but successively with an increasing share of 
renewable biomethane. Providing an adequate refuelling infrastructure for 
methane thus has a higher priority than setting up a similar infrastructure for 
hydrogen.</p> 
<p>During a transition period it will be necessary to provide incentives 
compensating early adaptors for various inconveniences when using new fuels or 
energy carriers. Such incentive schemes should, to be meaningful, have a 
life-length of 15 years (enough to provide investor and consumer confidence) 
and then only cautiously phased out. When considering the relative 
attractiveness of the three main alternatives &ndash; methane, hydrogen, and 
electric power &ndash; cost efficiency for avoided GHG emissions on a 
well-to-wheels basis, should be expressed per tonne of CO2 avoided. This means 
comparing not only the costs of making the fuel or energy carrier available, 
but also new infrastructure and vehicle costs. Looking at actual CO2 savings it 
is doubtful if there is everywhere a proper balance between e.g. incentives for 
electric vehicles and gas fuelled vehicles. Politicians have a tendency to 
offer short term support of long term options, not adequate support of already 
existing options.</p> 
<p>Well-to-wheels, or cradle-to-grave, GHG efficiency</p> 
<p>Studies performed are inevitably influenced by the vested interests among 
the people engaged in the study. This applies not only for commercial 
enterprises, but also for research institutes dependant upon contracts or 
grants. This is only human nature. It is thus essential to ensure that the 
criteria chosen are vetted very carefully, that the results are tied to 
state-of-the-art technolgy, and that they are also reflecting changes over time 
concerning exploration and extraction efficiencies for various fossil resources.
</p> 
<p>Concerning renewable resources it is also essential to find suitable 
methods to determine the net greenhouse gas savings for different alternatives.
</p> 
<p>For biofuels produced from waste and residues it is a matter of 
determining, for each alternative pathway and with all things considered, the 
net GHG reduction per tonne of feedstock used.</p> 
<p>For biofuels produced on the basis of specially grown crops (including 
grass and fast growing wood) one must instead for each option determine GHG 
avoidance per hectare of land used. When looking at GHG avoidance one must also 
consider the effect of indirect land use changes (ILUC).</p> 
<p>Rotational grass crops (e.g. every fifth year) which are not required for 
use as animal fodder forms a special case. Here it would be incorrect to 
consider LIUC effects. Similar exceptions concerning ILUC could be argued for 
idle land (fallow land, set-aside-land, or land not used for crops or cattle as 
a result of an open landscape policy).</p> 
<p>Finally feedstock grown in a marine environment also forms a special case 
where ILUC considerations are irrelevant. It would in this case probably also 
be best to calculate GHG avoidance for different fuel options based on tonnes 
of feedstock used.</p> 
<p>Another important point is that organic feedstock usually has a high 
moisture content. The distance that the feedstock must be transported has a 
high impact on net GHG emission avoidance. Relatively small plants producing 
biomethane which is either fed into an existing nearby gas grid, or liquefied 
for efficient long distance transportation, in this respect have an edge over 
large biorefineries. A similar advantage applies for the residuals from the 
biofuel production which will usually find use as fertiliser or fodder.</p> 
<p>My personal suggestions:</p> 
<p>Increase the minimum tax on fossil fuels based on GHG emissions expressed 
in CO2 equivalents per unit of energy consumed. Tax to apply when used, i.e. 
also when burning fuels in a CHP plant. A possible refinement would be to apply 
a higher rate for coal than for oil, and a lower rate for natural gas than for 
oil, in order to accelerate the transition to low carbon fuels. Another 
refinement would be to marginally adjust the fuel tax with regard to presence 
of pollutants (e.g. sulphur).</p> 
<p>A fair taxation of biofuels is a more tricky issue as the actual GHG 
avoidance varies for each combination of plant location and chosen technology. 
The simplest solution of this problem would probably be to apply the same fuel 
tax as for the corresponding fossil fuel, but at the same time pay the producer 
a subsidy based on the actually assessed GHG emission reduction per unit of 
fuel produced at his particular plant. The subsidy should be higher for fuels 
directly fit for grid injection or for use in vehicles (or as a blend stock in 
transportation fuels) than for fuels only fit for heating purposes or for power 
generation.</p> 
<p>The last statement above offers a solution to the problem that several 
national governments since many years apply an incentive scheme offering a 
guaranteed feed in tariff for electricity generated via only partially cleaned 
biogas (sulphur, siloxanes and moisture removed from raw biogas), whereas pure 
biomethane, upgraded at a significant cost, and fit for grid injection (or for 
direct use in vehicles) is not provided with any additional support. Pure 
biomethane for use in vehicles has to compete with natural gas, and the income 
from sales of biomethane at the price of natural gas is often lower than the 
income from almost raw biogas used for electric power generation. Considering 
the need to household with renewable biofuel feedstock we should avoid using 
available biomass for other purposes than biofuel production or chemical 
industry feedstock. The presently applied incentive scheme favouring electric 
power generation should be phased out as soon as possible, or modified to 
provide a new scheme where pure biomethane delivered into the grid, physically 
or virtually, is also supported at a rate which compensates the supplier for 
required upgrading costs.</p> 
<p>For many developing countries I would, however, at the same time support 
the use of domestic scale waste based biogas production to allow smoke free 
cooking and heating, and avoiding the daily challenge of finding suitable 
fuels. This option also has the benefit of providing inexpensive fertiliser for 
a small lot of land.</p> 
<p>Regional differentiation of fuel tax or vehicle charges, introduced in 
order to support economic developments in certain regions, may also need 
special consideration. To avoid distortions of the regime affecting the choice 
of vehicles, regional support might be best handled via a differentiated income 
tax system.</p> 
<p>Final comments</p> 
<p>Above presented ideas concerning incentive schemes and tax on fuels or 
energy carriers, are completely focussed on (a) favouring fuel efficiency and 
reduction of GHG emissions, also (b) ensuring that renewable energy can 
successfully compete with energy based on the use of fossil resources. Such 
schemes should not be distorted via annual vehicle taxes, road user fees, 
vehicle sales tax, vehicle registration fees, or vehicle procurement schemes 
which differentiate applicable rates dependent upon choice of fuel or energy 
carrier. GHG emission penalties via the fuel tax should also apply equally in 
all sectors (i.e. no special favours for certain industries or consumer groups).
</p> 
<p>All of the above presented arguments and suggestions reflect my personal 
views, not a consensus based view of any organisation.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Your question, &ldquo;What would it take to really speed up the transition 
to a carbon neutral society?&rdquo;has two different aspects to it</p> 
<p>- first are all the technical aspects of the question : what energy, how to 
reduce carbon footprint, etc. all of which that are extensively debated here.
</p> 
<p>- second is the human acceptance, or resistance to change. </p> 
<p>As a change management specialist, I will develop the second part.</p> 
<p>These two aspects must balance to not stay at the research level : you may 
have the best solution, technologically proven, but they will never ever be 
implemented without public consent. And if you have public consent, real 
acceptance, then there is room for new research budgets, new volunteering, and 
better solutions can even be discovered.<br>
 So, the solution does not 
uniquely lie in the technology, but, according to our experience in the proper 
balance between technology research and social acceptance.</p> 
<p>Building public acceptance is a process, it is a long process, but it needs 
to be done and can be done. Many projects have died because of lack of it. 
Hardly any politician will invest in a project not backed up by some 
acceptance. The political risk is too high.</p> 
<p>So it is mandatory to build public acceptance that will create agreements 
that will make possible new technologies, new paradigm to arise.</p> 
<p>So, the next question, is how to create public acceptance? It is very 
difficult to answer in few lines, but here is the outline of how to do it : 
first, one has to survey, in order to know what the public desires. Then, using 
that, one can properly communicate, and understand better the public concern. 
Then only some technological solutions can be presented and can be accepted.</p>
<p>And these are the very first steps to changing habits and culture. Because 
to change a culture, one has to change its agreements, and create new ones, 
then start to change behaviors, then make these new behaviors into a habit for 
some. When enough people get these new habits, and these habits are properly 
pubicized, a new culture can arise.</p> 
<p>As one can see, this is totally a non technical part of what would it take 
to really speed up the transition to a carbon neutral society. But if this is 
not managed thoroughly and driven with the adequate push, there will be no 
appropriation, no participation, instead there will be resistance to change, 
criticism, etc.</p> 
<p>This imbalance between technology and human concern is very likely one of 
the reasons of the slow acceptance of changes. People accept way more changes, 
when they understand the problems and the solutions. Proper communication based 
on correct surveys and correctly delivered can today, according to my own 
experience create the most effective change. Because technology will never be 
implemented in the public farther than the public acceptance of it.</p> Share:

<p>This is a very intresting question, given the fact that all the countries 
are participating in a mad race to meet their growing energy needs, while 
sustaining the carbon emissions.</p> 
<p>From the begning of Industrial growth in early 1900, we have been depended 
on fossil fuels to feed our industries, to generate electricity, to fuel our 
vehicles and so on. Subsequently the consumptions has risen by leaps and 
bounds. This unprecended growth in burning of fossil fuels has resulted in many 
ecological and eviornmental complications.</p> 
<p>We all know for a fact that two-third of the earth&rsquo;s surface is 
covered with water. Instead of using Hydro power to meet our demands, we have 
explored the seas just to derive fossil fuels from them. We must all understand 
that, by continuing to do so we are causing more damage than good to ourselfs. 
Unless we explore ways to use hydro power, tidal power and other means, we 
cannot address this topic in a fair way.</p> 
<p>The other source we must rely, though not limit ourselves, is the solar 
energy. Some easy and very cost effective ways to utilise this abundantly 
available clean source can be as follows:</p> 
<p>1. Promote use of solar panels on each and every home. Reduction in a 
minimum of 20% dependancy on the grid is guaranteed with the current available 
technology. When calculating the same for an entire city, metro or a nation, a 
very favorable result can be noticed.</p> 
<p>2. Use of green house to cultivate fruits and vegetables locally. This will 
not only meet the daily needs of consumers, but will eradicate the burden of 
trailers/trucks used to transport commodities between cities and countries.</p> 
<p>3. Designing new buliding meeting conformities as Green buildings, which 
smartly use energy, cutting down on even the most minute wastage.</p> 
<p>4. Redesigning the existing buildings to reduce wastage of electricity.</p> 
<p>These are very basic and few simple measures every nation must implement 
only then we can accelarte the reduction of carbon foot print and speed up the 
transition to a carbon neutral society. This will never will be possible 
without the intevention of both government and coorporate.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Preamble<br>
 This is at first sight a very complicated question. It is 
also not very clear, or specific, on internal assumptions. The question, in its 
present formulation, does assume a few things. It assumes (1) that a carbon 
neutral society would be a good thing, hence a desirable thing[i] , (2) that 
transition to such a society is first of all possible, and (3) that speeding up 
same transition is both desirable and possible. With these (quite strong) 
assumptions in place, one can then proceed to trace solutions to this quite 
complicated problem. I dare say complicated, since it seems to be a problem 
that needs to take into consideration a systemic view of the world&ndash;the 
one we live in which overall is at this current time rather accelerating its 
carbon production, hence still moving quite fast away from a carbon neutral 
society. Complicated however, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply or mean complex, 
nor does it imply or mean that a solution absolutely needs to be complicated as 
well&hellip; In fact, many seemingly complicated &ldquo;problems&rdquo; have 
found themselves over time radically simple solutions.</p> 
<p>Setting the Stage<br>
 Metaphorically, from simple classic 
physics/mechanics, we know the simple answer to this type of problem. As with 
stopping anything that speeds and accelerates out-of-control, we seem to need a 
three stages process. First, decelerating the current acceleration, reducing 
the movement towards constant speed. Second, continuing to decelerate towards 
lowering growth speed as we are reversing the trend. Third, ensuring that as 
the &ldquo;braking&rdquo; body moves past origin it will have the change in 
dynamic of influencing driving forces that will induce a/the new equilibrium to 
occur around the origin this time. This is intended to ensure that we shall not 
allow the next time around a repeat of the &ldquo;out-of-control acceleration 
away from origin&rdquo; we have been inducing/experiencing since/with the 
industrial revolution.</p> 
<p>However, if one were to bring this simple process argument in front of 
seasoned famed economists, s/he may be chased out of the room with a vengeance. 
The core reason has to deal with the implicit assumption an economist is most 
likely trained with that growth is always good, and that we need to seek and 
sustain it at all cost.</p> 
<p>For an economist, it is rare to conceive of equilibrium processes outside 
the notion of economic general equilibrium (which is in its essence market 
equilibrium). Hence, the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; (as used above) positioned at a 
natural equilibrium between humans and Earth (or nature in general, which is to 
mean beyond simply Earth), a systemic state whereby carbon production and 
consumption is at equilibrium, is hard to conceive inside the discipline of 
economics. Just as it is equally hard to conceive inside any sub-discipline of 
business or of engineering. These difficulties are nothing when compared to the 
added intricacies that stem from bringing the issue up in international 
political negotiations. Producing less carbon means after all exactly a slowing 
down of economic industrial growth. Hence, to the developing world this means 
yet another unethical barrier that the North and West (as it were) put on the 
rights the South and East have to develop. We do not question or endorse the 
validity of the claims, we simply point out their existence. Nonetheless, when 
it all boils down to stating &ldquo;but we have the right to emit CO2&rdquo;, 
aside from all the other errors with any such reasoning, to what extent are we 
committing a grand fallacy of composition? The fact that we emit CO2 naturally 
by breathing, along with the entire animal world, doesn&rsquo;t make the 
&ldquo;right&rdquo; for humans to industrially emit so much more in orders of 
magnitude CO2 that it dwarfs any planetary natural capacity of compensation 
either a &ldquo;nature endorsed&rdquo; possibility or a natural right. (Inside 
our legal and political systems we can declare it nonetheless a natural right, 
but such declaration would most probably hold little water if any in the face 
of objective natural tests over future history)</p> 
<p>However, maintaining a somewhat philosophical approach on the issue, we 
dare ask away yet some other framing questions.</p> 
<p>From a knowledge perspective, are we actually ready to address the issue 
fully and with necessary seriousness of purpose? May we dare suggest that we 
may not be ready at all. Pragmatic problem solving interdisciplinary scientific 
approaches may be required beyond our (societal) internal readiness or ability 
to &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; (or simply allow) them.</p> 
<p>Psychology, maybe together with some alternative economics, wrapped in 
philosophy and epistemology, and not at all natural or engineering sciences 
alone, may be holding some answers for us in the quest to find a practical way 
to &ldquo;really speed up the transition to a carbon neutral society&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Barriers (especially the not seen or not so easily traceable ones) to our 
very ability to address fully the issue may be higher than we imagine.</p> 
<p>Yet, we take an optimistic stance, assuming that a simple solution to this 
complicated problem does exist, and that we are able to look for it and find it.

<em>On 13/12/2010</em> 
<p>I believe that the two primary factors that could help speed up the 
transition away from the current system are:</p> 
<p>1. A gradual removal of indirect and direct subsidies to the energy sector.
<br> 2. A systematic policy based treatment of energy efficient technologies.
</p> 
<p>One of the primary drivers for investments in the upstream and downstream 
energy sector has been direct (e.g. preferential land rents) and indirect 
subsidies (e.g. Government backing for projects considered too risky for the 
private sector). These subsidies were brought in for a variety of reasons 
(largely political though), and range from populist subsidies on highly visible 
fuel and power products (such as those on gasoline in Libya and Venezuela) to 
the more covert subsidies which are often in the form of import tariffs (e.g. 
on imported bio-fuel to the U.S.). These distortions have become embedded in 
our market exchange systems over time and well-organised lobbying groups have 
appeared in their aftermath. Once a lobbying group has formed, they will often 
persuade the ruling party to introduce compounding regulations that create high 
barriers to entry for competing resources (Victor, 2009). This is currently 
happening within the renewable sector in many developed countries.</p> 
<p>The gradual removal of favoured treatment would help form a more balanced 
system; one that relays the actual prices of energy to the consumer. This could 
help reduce demand for wanton and wasteful energy services, leaving behind only 
the truly competitive products. Furthermore, industries must be allowed to 
collapse if they cannot stand on their own two feet. Governments cannot simply 
subsidise energy production and consumption without any due regard for the 
negative externalities. In a balanced system, when demand rises for a 
particular stock then the price should also rise, which would normally push 
down demand. Instead of allowing such price hikes to reach the electorate, 
governments have repeatedly given out subsidies, typically in the form of huge 
grants for both land and minerals. Accepting that there are a large number of 
counteracting forces at play, and also that politicians will generally act to 
remain in power, there still is an onus on current policy-makers to begin 
pricing fuel and power at prices that will entail some compromise on those that 
provide and those that use the services of heat, electricity and transportation.
</p> 
<p>The second factor is the detailing of how efficient technologies can be 
brought in to replace the embedded systems. This revolves around individual 
whole-system policies for each technology, taking into account their supply 
chains and how they are used by each sector of society. Edison first brought in 
the light-bulb to the upper-class of lower Manhattan by using a system of 
lines, substations and transformers, etc (Johnson &amp; Suskewicz, 2009). He 
recognized that an effective business model requires a disruptive whole-system 
approach that provides profit but also could be marketed as a premium product. 
Further to this is the effect of societal influence (i.e. disruptive 
technologies generally tend to progress downwards through societal classes, and 
not upwards (Fisk, 2008)). Air-conditioners in cars were not introduced into 
old clangers and innovative technologies should not be demonstrated in social 
housing projects. Indeed one of the barriers to use of district heating in some 
countries is its interpretation as a form of &lsquo;poor man&rsquo;s 
heat&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Concisely then, if we are to increase the rate of transition to a more 
resource-friendly society, policies should promote individual technologies 
where their supply chain could be improved by the removal of market-based 
barriers. This need not play a role in the actual financing, particularly if we 
are to move towards a subsidy free energy market in the coming decades. 
Policies can address market barriers, for instance by reducing transaction 
costs via information campaigns and improved institutional capacity. In the 
past however, governments have generally provided assistance in the form of 
complimentary infrastructure provision (e.g. the vast swathes of highways built 
after the U.S&rsquo; 1956 Federal Aid Highway Act helped truly embed motor 
vehicles as the private transport technology of choice).</p> 
<p>It must be noted that there is no easy answer to such a broad question, and 
there is no easy solution. Underpinning our existing energy systems are both a 
market and physical infrastructure based upon the assumption that fossil-fuels 
will never run out (although there is a short-term presumption of scarcity) 
based on the premise that there are no inherent limits to production (Harris 
&amp; Carman, 1983). Indeed the fact that there are so many interested parties 
involved in the energy sector makes simply understanding the underlying 
plethora of self-interests quite a task. The author sincerely hopes that 
stakeholders will begin to look beyond the dividends of subsidies and begin to 
formulate systematic policies for the longer term evolution to a low carbon 
future.</p> Share: <br>

Cool the Earth, Save the 
Economy<br>
 said: <em>On 13/12/2010</em> 
<p>Leaders of the major carbon-emitting nations need to view climate change 
with the same sense of urgency that their historic forebears viewed World War 
II. Only then will they be ready to throw sufficient human and material 
resources as quickly as possible into its solution, stopping carbon emissions. 
A monumental stumbling block towards creating that urgency is the largely 
unquestioned assumption by such leaders that the health of an 
economy/population is measured by its growth rather than sustainability. China 
is a good example. Its national leaders, including many engineers, recognize 
how climate change is already damaging their society, and will do so 
catastrophically as it continues. So, they have committed sizeable resources 
towards reducing air pollution, slowing population increases, and developing a 
clean renewable energy industry. Simultaneously, however, they are committed to 
a rate of economic growth that even they recognize will cause 
climate-disrupting emissions to rise into the foreseeable future. The United 
States is in worse shape.</p> 
<p>Given the current economic atmosphere, the most promising way to push for 
such a transition is to make a strong economic and jobs argument for 
transitioning to carbon neutrality. We do so in our free, downloadable online 
book, Cool the Earth, Save the Economy: Solving the Climate Crisis is EASY, at
http://www.CoolTheEarth.US . In it, we propose a national plan for the United 
States, the EASY plan, which meets three essential criteria: it is affordable, 
politically acceptable to most of the public, and technologically available 
now. The components are:</p> 
<p>Energy efficiency &ndash; achieve significant savings in energy use through 
more efficient appliances, home modifications (such as weatherization 
upgrades), and commercial, industrial, and manufacturing practices. The U.S. 
could save almost $1 trillion over the next decade (2008 McKinsey Global 
Institute report.)</p> 
<p>Automotive efficiency &ndash; use available technology to create cars and 
trucks that achieve a fleet average of 60 miles per gallon (mpg) of gas by 2030 
through hybrid and electric plug-in technology; create energy efficient public 
transport systems, such as high speed rail within and between cities. SUVs 
could get 67 mpg if built with current hybrid technology and new advanced 
ultralight materials (eg, carbon fiber thermoplastic composites), according to 
energy expert Amory Lovins. Those who convert their hybrids to plug-in hybrids 
(via the nonprofit Calcars) are achieving 100 or more mpg.</p> 
<p>Solar, wind and geothermal technology &ndash; for carbon-free, renewable 
energy sources. Install photovoltaic roof systems on all available roofs, build 
solar thermal plants in sunny areas, create wind farms throughout the main wind 
corridor of the central U.S. and off coasts, and build geothermal plants 
wherever feasible. Update the current national electrical grid into a 
&ldquo;smart&rdquo; grid, utilizing energy storage systems such as 
megabatteries, high voltage DC power lines, fly wheel storage technology, 
electric plug-in vehicle storage, and two-way information flow of energy usage 
and distribution.<br>
 About 30% of the projected 2030 total U.S. energy demand 
could be met by converting 2% of the land in Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona to 
solar thermal farms. The number of U.S. solar panel roof systems is exploding 
as the price plummets 60% or more with new tax incentives.(1) Plastic solar 
cells, organic solar concentrators and rapidly evolving solar thermal 
technology are rapidly making solar energy costs competitive with fossil fuels. 
U.S. wind energy market grew 78% in 2008, adding 17.3 megawatts of new wind 
energy capacity, and selling about half of all small wind turbines installed 
globally then.(2) China is rapidly accelerating wind energy development, 
promising 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2020, about a quarter of current total 
U.S. energy demand.(3)<br>
 You are part of the solution &ndash; the sum of the 
incremental actions of all citizens can have a significant effect both through 
political influence and energy efficient behavior.</p> 
<p>National U.S. policies to implement the components should include:</p> 
<p>&bull; Revising tax policy to reward clean-energy winners by redirecting 
some of the tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and fossil fuel 
industrial profits toward tax breaks on the profits from the sale of clean 
energy and energy-efficient devices, allowing the market to choose the 
&ldquo;winners&rdquo;;<br>
 &bull; Shifting energy subsidies from fossil fuels 
to clean energy, energy efficiency, electric grid expansion and mass transit;
<br> &bull; Regulating energy efficiency of vehicles, appliances, and industry;
<br> &bull; Providing public land for solar and wind energy, grid expansion, 
and mass transit;<br>
 &bull; Redirecting military spending towards clean 
energy rather than maintaining oil supplies in the Middle East;<br>
 &bull; 
Developing transitional energy policies, such as a temporary shift from coal to 
natural gas usage while we develop clean renewable energy infrastructure, and 
retraining fossil fuel workers to work in the carbon-free energy industry.</p> 
<p>Note that the emphasis here, as detailed in the first bullet, is to make 
clean energy cheap, not dirty energy more expensive. Educating the public 
through the media and the presidential bully pulpit and then encouraging them 
to pressure Congress into creating these policies is a key part of this 
process. Imagine if major media avenues carried public service announcements 
daily on how homeowners or communities could cut their energy consumption, or 
transition to clean energy.</p> 
<p>Our book shows that our nation can realize huge savings and create new 
employment through transitioning to a carbon neutral society. Indeed, one of 
the fastest growing sectors in the US economy is the clean energy industry. 
Other economies that are strongly committed to this transition, such as 
Germany, are much healthier than the US economy.</p> 
<p>Community level policies to implement the components include having 
community leaders:</p> 
<p>&bull; Create and implement plans to significantly decrease energy use in 
their communities;<br>
 &bull; Demand that their utilities use renewable, 
carbon-free energy sources for an ever increasing percentage of community 
energy needs;<br>
 &bull; Encourage household clean energy generation through 
longterm loans, lending homeowners the financing up front needed to establish 
renewable carbon free energy sources (solar or wind) on their roofs.</p> 
<p>Necessary international policies include:</p> 
<p>&#61599; halting destruction of important carbon storage ecosystems, such 
as tropical rainforests peat bogs.<br>
 &#61599; addressing overpopulation by 
asserting the reproductive rights of all women through developing a global 
program that provides contraceptive education and choices for all women. Within 
a global carbon trading system, create a &ldquo;Condoms for Carbon&rdquo; 
program that rewards nations with carbon credits for effective family planning 
programs.</p> 
<p>Bringing our populations to sustainable levels is a concept every nation 
can understand, and it&rsquo;s time that we start talking openly about this, 
devoid of emotional rhetoric. Because the planetary population is well beyond 
sustainable levels, even a small increase causes much more than just a 
proportional increase in damage to our life support systems (4) &ndash; carbon 
storage systems such as forests and peatbogs, watersheds, and the atmosphere. 
In all nations, rich or poor, developing or developed, it is the combination of 
the individual rate of consumption AND the population size that contributes to 
that damage. So, no nation can be exempt from the responsibility of bringing 
their population to a sustainable level, preferably through the humanity of 
planned families, and not the inhumanity of floods, epidemics, and starvation. 
The latter forces, whether we like it or not, are already culling populations.
</p> 
<p>A constant daily public education about continuing climate change via 
mainstream media would help create and sustain the sense of urgency needed to 
develop and maintain a fast transition towards a carbon neutral society.(5) It 
would push our leaders towards redefining national socio-economic health in 
terms of sustainability rather than growth, an important imperative for all 
nations. It would push us, the public, towards electing courageous leaders who 
are willing to act on the sustainability principle against vested corporate 
interests. This would speed up the transition to a carbon neutral society.</p>

<p>I think the answer is conceptually very simple, and politically difficult. 
What we need is:</p> 
<p>&bull; A consistent global carbon price (either through a tax or a cap 
&amp; trade system). This price should apply to all countries, including 
developing ones.<br>
 &bull; Developing countries should be compensated via a 
recycling of some of the carbon revenues. This separates the issue of 
&ldquo;carbon equity&rdquo; from that of getting a clear economic signal 
everywhere to reduce emissions, and avoiding &ldquo;leakage&rdquo; of emissions 
to unregulated jurisdictions. Developing countries should find it much easier 
to grow down a low-carbon path, since they don&rsquo;t have the installed 
high-carbon legacy infrastructure that developed countries do.<br>
 &bull; 
Countries which do not participate in this carbon pricing should pay a tax on 
the carbon content of their exports to those countries who do participate.<br>
 
&bull; Governments should simplify the whole policy framework for moving to 
low-carbon energy. The current plethora of policies &ndash; subsidies for 
renewable energy (at different levels for different types), mandates for 
certain levels of renewable or low-carbon energy, a carbon trading system, 
compulsory shutdowns of fossil fuel power stations &ndash; is 
expensive/economically inefficient, and just weakens the price signal given by 
the EU&rsquo;s cap &amp; trade system. We end up paying very heavily for things 
like solar power and offshore wind, while neglecting quick, low-cost options 
like industrial heat &amp; power, improved energy efficiency, and switching 
from coal to gas.<br>
 There should be two, and only two, major lines of policy:
<br> o A carbon price (via a tax or cap) as mentioned above<br>
 o Targeted 
government support for certain early-stage technologies which are too large for 
the private sector to develop to commerciality, such as carbon capture &amp; 
storage (see my recent article:
http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/gcc-must-unite-to-capture-advantage-on-carbon-storage)
. However, this support should be (a) competitively based, e.g. through 
competitions/auctions (b) time-limited, or (as with solar subsidies) declining 
with time on a set schedule, until the technology is competitive (c) targeted 
towards results/performance rather than a prescribed technical approach.<br>
 
In practice, this is all likely to prove highly politically difficult, for a 
number of reasons: countries differ in their carbon intensity and how hard they 
will be hit by climate change; domestic lobby groups oppose carbon pricing or 
agitate for subsidies for pet projects; border carbon taxation threatens the 
global system of free trade and WTO rules; etc.</p> 
<p>We also need some honesty and realism in climate policy and in NGO 
pronouncements, notably:</p> 
<p>&bull; We need a way to build large-scale, low-carbon energy 
infrastructure, like wind farms, nuclear power stations and carbon capture 
&amp; storage plants, without endless protests, inquiries and permitting 
procedures &ndash; of course, while keeping them safe, environmentally friendly 
and acceptable to the local community<br>
 &bull; We need to avoid ideological 
and/or NIMBY hostility to some kinds of low-carbon energy, notably nuclear 
power and carbon capture &amp; storage (and, in some locations, offshore wind)
<br> &bull; We need to stop mixing up climate policy with all kinds of other 
campaigns &ndash; for wealth redistribution, population control, 
anti-capitalism or anti-big business, a less &ldquo;consumerist&rdquo; society 
etc &ndash; that just alienate large parts of society, the business community 
and major developing countries.<br>
 &bull; We should not pretend that 
switching to renewable energy will automatically generate millions of 
&ldquo;green jobs&rdquo;. Yes, it can create new export-oriented industries. 
But higher energy prices, due to a carbon tax and/or higher use of costly 
renewable energy, mean lower economic growth and lower job creation. If we 
could reduce CO2 emissions without economic pain, then there would be no need 
for climate policy.<br>
 The challenge is therefore how to get our CO2 
emissions down at the lowest cost &ndash; not how to reduce emissions in the 
way most acceptable to Greenpeace or the coal lobby or China or US farmers or 
any other special interest group.</p> 
<p>Finally, I think a lot of this comes down to educating the public about 
energy &ndash; the pros and cons of different sources, the trade-offs that 
policymakers must make, the scale and inertia of the system, and the fact that 
cost matters.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s well known and confirmed that the carbon emission is the 
main responsible for the phenomena called global warming, really it&rsquo;s the 
major challenge to the whole scientists, governments army and people around the 
world. They need very fast and serious collaboration to reduce and inhibit the 
reasons for that. We are paying the fine for our intensive energy generation 
from the ground fuel, and to speed the international society against the carbon 
emission we have to show real encouragements for first; to go back to the 
hydrogen basic atom which needs research, action and investment, second; we 
have to shift immediately to the alternative energy sources like wind, solar 
and water waves, third enables the people to offset their emissions from travel 
and lifestyle choices by allowing them to contribute money towards projects 
that reduce or remove greenhouse gas i.e. CO2 ones., while from my side I did a

<p>A charge on greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions would speed the transition; 
long-term regulatory certainty would help too. Too many of us, including 
individuals, governments and businesses, do not pay to emit GHGs. If we had to 
pay &mdash; either directly through charges to obtain allowances or taxes on 
emissions or indirectly via price signals on carbon intensive products &mdash; 
we would be motivated by our wallets to make more climate-friendly, 
carbon-neutral decisions. Currently, the carbon market is experiencing a great 
deal of price volatility due to uncertainty in some jurisdictions regarding 
what counts toward future emission caps. In addition, we have low prices in 
some jurisdictions where emission are not valued, and accordingly emission 
reductions have little value. We need policy and regulatory certainty over time 
and a reasonable price on emissions so that companies, governments and 
individuals can make the right decisions when we buy energy and products and 
services.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Dear Cecilia,<br>
 You have rightly three key things to do for carbon 
neutral society. It is challenging to achieve that globally. Forthis we need to 
have global governance system. It is time to think on that. Presently there is 
lot of thinking in this line but with the intention to make done from others. 
Please see my comments also</p>

<p>One part of the way forward to reducing our carbon emissions would be to 
focus on cities. My recent World Policy Journal Article looks at possible 
solutions and what some cities are doing now. It also shows how important 
cities are, and will be, in the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of the 
world:http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/wopj.2011.27.4.11. </p> 
<p>However, I doubt it would be possible with my lifetime or even three 
generations on to create a carbon neutral world. We are just too tied into 
hydrocarbons in our energy systems, agricultural systems and more.</p> 
<p>We can talk about carbon taxes and carbon limitations, like what the US 
President is proposing for refineries, but there are just so many sources of 
carbon emissions we would unlikely get to all of them.</p> 
<p>The last carbon neutral society may have been the hunter gathers. I 
can&rsquo;t see that the economies, engineering, technological and other 
systems we have can be pushed to carbon neutrality without some serious 
problems if this is done too quickly. Things have to be done in reasonable and 
thoughtful ways with strategic visions for a better energy and environment 
future, rather than wanting everything to change quickly.</p> 
<p>Our living systems are just not prepared for the huge changes required to 
move to a carbon neutral society. This would be very hard for the EU, the US 
and the rest of the OECD. Now consider China, which is a coal based economy 
mostly that needs to grow to produce what Hu Jin Tao called the thing that 
keeps him up at night: 25 million jobs per year. Then there is India with its 
coal based economy, but also its biomass based economies in many of its 
villages. Biomass is still a hydrocarbon and burning it produces CO2. Then look 
at Africa, which is mostly biomass based. How are we going to tell those 
hundreds of millions of poor people to give up a better economic future in 
order to be carbon neutral?</p> 
<p>I think we can all agree that global climate change is an import issue, 
even with the uncertainty associated with possible future effects and results. 
However, we also need to be reasonable and understand the complexity of the 
changes that need to be done. We also need to understand that looking at this 
issue from the wealthy countries, like in the EU, is very different from 
looking at this from the perspective of a poor farmer or slum dweller in South 
Asia and Africa, or even China.</p> 
<p>There are many different perspectives on these issues and many different 
goals and objectives. There will likely not be a meeting of the minds or a 
fully functioning and agreed upon global treaty with any real effect on this 
issue because the world is a place of great variety in energy use, economic 
development, educational development, and just plain views of the world and its 
problems.</p> 
<p>The usual suspects of solutions are just way too simple to apply to 
everywhere and to all people.</p> 
<p>Also, is heading toward a carbon neutral world the goal we should be 
focusing on over a billion of people live in dire poverty, and many hundreds of 
millions more are living not much better? Is the main goal we should be looking 
at when 5,000 children die from dirty water every day? Is this the goal we 
should be focusing on when hundreds of millions of children wake up and sleep 
hungry every day? Is this the goal we should be so focused on when so many are 
under psychological stresses due to unemployment and economic stagnation?</p> 
<p>We need to focus on multiple goals, such as the MDGs and the like, as we as 
a world begin to look more closely at how we are going to adapt and adjust, and 
even thrive, in new energy and environment futures.</p> 
<p>Our energy and environment futures will be very complex and are related to 
our economic, health, and human security futures. We need to consider the 
feedback systems and recursive systems involved.</p> 
<p>Not simple? No. And that makes it all the more important to think this 
through carefully and strategically with many goals in mind.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Becoming a carbon neutral society will require a significant change in 
global culture. So long as there are so many ignorant, self-absorbed, greedy, 
and basically malevolent people, then there will always be these bizarre and 
wasteful &ldquo;institutions.&rdquo; That may sound a little dramatic, but 
that&rsquo;s what it comes down to.</p> 
<p>Politicians will do whatever it takes to get elected and stay in power. 
Politicians are needed to manage the process &ndash; unfortunately. Until the 
population is able to vote for the right kind of politician, it just 
won&rsquo;t get done.</p> 
<p>The media is also highly problematic &ndash; so long as witless media 
outlets like Fox News continue to brainwash the easily influenced into thinking 
that climate change is &ldquo;debatable,&rdquo; then nothing will happen.</p> 
<p>The alternatives are (a) get rid of politicians entirely (not likely), or 
get some kind of benevolent global dictator who will tell us to do it (even 
less likely).</p> Share: <br>

<p>The concept of &lsquo;transition&rsquo; assumes a system state that is 
qualitatively different than the current state of affairs. In the context of 
our current society, it is fair to suggest that such a transition is required 
within a very short period of time if we want to reduce the risks of climate 
and natural resource disruptions.</p> 
<p>However, such transition is difficult to orchestrate centrally, since it 
requires many components of our system to transform in ways that support each 
other in creating a carbon neutral society. For example, a carbon neutral 
energy system does not provide a carbon neutral society without changes in our 
food or natural resource systems; carbon neutral countries cannot balance out 
carbon producing countries; a carbon neutral society for 6 billion people does 
not necessarily sustain a carbon neutral society of 9 billion people. A second 
important characteristic of transitions is that its form is inherently 
uncertain. Even if could design a carbon neutral society from scratch now, 
there will be future technological and social surprises that will affect its 
functioning.</p> 
<p>The indeterminacy and uncertainty of transitions makes it difficult to 
develop a set list of actions that would speed up such transition. However, it 
also provides policy makers, businesses, and society with a great opportunity. 
Since nobody can determine a transition towards a carbon neutral society, 
nobody can stop transitions. In this lack of power and control lies the most 
important instrument for speeding up such a transition.</p> 
<p>One way of using this lack of power and control to speed up transitions is 
to create visions, provide leadership, and seed pockets of change. Vision can 
provide others with the conviction that their actions and ideas are not in 
vain, but that individual actions contributes to changes on a larger scale. 
Charismatic leadership can provide certainty in times when actions are not 
immediately paying off and patience is required. Pockets of change can provide 
the examples required to change people&rsquo;s mindset and overcome their 
initial resistance to all things new.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, policy makers, businesses, and citizens are too often caught 
up in short-term concerns with little attention devoted to the future. 
Furthermore, they are all looking to each other to take the first step. 
However, as soon as visions are being shared, leadership becomes a motor for 
change, and local practitioners start to implement, transitions can easily 
become historic turning points.</p> Share: <br>

<p>Change is caused by external disturbances that disrupt equilibriums, create 
tensions, and change system needs. The system then adjusts through changes in 
Goal attainment and adaptation-functions and settles down in a new equilibrium.
</p> 
<p>The core process for change is a shift in belief systems, ideologies and 
public opinion. Such shifts not only influence consumer preferences and values 
but also create credibility pressure on and legitimacy for policy makers to 
introduce regulations, motivating development of new goals and subsequently use 
science and technology to adjust the economic sub-system, and address market 
failures with policy instruments such as environmental taxes, subsidies and 
tradable permits; however, it is necessary to focus on rational resource 
allocation decisions under the existing conditions of scarcity.</p> 
<p>Consequently these systems are anchored, in new behavioral norms and 
values, through integrated functions of which a clear example is the renewable 
energy case and the way it serves as a hedge against:</p> 
<p> - geo-political threats, like being dependent on Russia and Middle East<br>
 - future scarcity of fuels like oil peak scenario&rsquo;s etc</p> 
<p>Based on experience, we are sure that consumers allocate their budgets on 
purchase decisions that maximize utility; consequently producers invest 
resources in production, with the market and price signals acting as 
coordinating mechanism.</p> 
<p>Also, note that first mover advantages (such as brand recognitions, 
creation of market positions, technology lead, creation of patent barriers) 
create a favorable position in the green innovation race balancing risk and 
opportunities associated with investments. However, the sense of urgency for 
environmental problems is lower than these for functional problems and 
consequently socio-technical transitions to a Carbon Neutral society do not 
come about easily and need to be motivated by gradually developing integrative 
factors capable of maximizing utility.</p> Share: <br>

<p>THE 6 CORNERSTONES OF A VIABLE METHOD FOR CLEANING UP CLIMATE CHANGE</p> 
<p>A list of cornerstone technologies capable of and available today to 
remediate carbon dioxide &amp; particulates globally while also eliminating the 
dead zones from the oceans while producing biofuels and green electrical power.
</p> 
<p>CORNERSTONE #1<br>
 Commercial Scale Production of Algae Based Drop-In 
Petroleum Replacements:</p> 
<p>Using the continuous cultivation system for microalgae designed by Scipio 
Biofuels in a de-centralized model the system can, due to the ability of the 
system to consume XX,XXX+ tons annually of CO2. The CO2 is consumed to 
cultivate algae in a pump-less flowing circuit, which will produce more than 
XXX,XXX gallons of algae oil per acre per year for biofuels.</p> 
<p>How much more than X will be cultivated? Unfortunately at this time we 
can&rsquo;t tell what we don&rsquo;t know. We know we will generate at least X. 
From the very beginning of the design stages we have been consumed with the 
ideas of under promising &amp; over delivering in every way imaginable. As of 
this writing algae based biofuels can easily be produced at or very near the 
point of use with our equipment.</p> 
<p>For point of use production at an existing larger facility just install our 
solar collector portion of the system in a circuit immediately within the 
perimeter fence of airports, logistics depots, military bases &amp; the like. 
The algae, is continuously circulated, harvested &amp; processed into fuels 
under the parking lot or another suitable location within or adjacent to the 
facility site. This process was designed to consume the maximum amount of CO2 
from industrial sources and produce the maximum amount of algae for fuels.</p> 
<p>It is possible to generate, algae oil (or green crude) for algae based 
biofuels in the tens, to tens of thousands of tons per day depending on the 
number of PBR&rsquo;s at a given facility and other factors. As long as 
geothermal heat (on a small scale) can be tapped onsite, the latitude limits 
for algae cultivation on a year-round basis theoretically stretch nearly to the 
entire Earth between the Arctic and Antarctic Circles until photo-period simply 
won&rsquo;t support growth rates to be economically feasible. As luck would 
have it, we have multiple solutions for that as well. I get bothered about 
using energy to make energy, as conversions are never 100% efficient. Although 
in this particular case the ends will most probably justify the means.</p> 
<p>The exact same equipment can be used to grow on the same scale the algae 
that produce Omega-3 &amp; Omega-6 fatty acids. For pharmaceutical use these 
oils sell (as of this writing) for $200+ per gallon. As well as algae that 
bears Astaxanthin, which sells for between $6,000 and $15,000 per kilogram. 
Astaxanthin which is the substance that makes salmon pink is an antioxidant 
300x more powerful than Vitamin E.<br>
 With a value rarefied much higher than 
that of Omega-x fatty acids. Algae can produce feed stocks for many industries 
including plastics, cosmetics and many more. This diversification of value 
streams gives greater stability to the alternative fuels industry and by 
extension, the economy as a whole. But we can&rsquo;t get caught up in just 
growing high value strains. We&rsquo;re primarily producing fuel and 
supplementing any shortfall of profit by producing higher value algae in 
relatively small quantities.<br>
 To completely divorce financial viability 
from petroleum pricing, we grow nutriceuticals of a much greater value. The 
volumes we can generate of any microalgae allow us to not need to commit much 
production capacity to this endeavor to assure a handsome profit without 
flooding the markets.</p> 
<p>With such a de-centralized system producing tens of thousands (to millions) 
of tons of press-cake annually at or near each point of use, combined with 
centralized sites producing tens of millions of tons annually, it is 
conceivable that there will not be enough consumers of press-cake products. 
This is OK. Pyrolysis can be used to generate bio-gasoline from algae cake 
adjacent to the bio-jet fuel &ldquo;refining&rdquo; station. Today the coal 
cars can be empty for putting the &ldquo;green coal&rdquo; (algae press cake) 
back into the ground. Using first of the 6 Cornerstones, algae production to 
consume the CO2 regardless of algae production in excess of the global energy 
demand will greatly accelerate carbon sequestration. This means that carbon 
sequestration is an issue that resolves itself for at least a hundred years.</p>
<p>Grow algae, harvest algae, extract oil. Press-cake and overproduction go 
back into the coal mine = meaningful carbon sequestration without economic 
devastation but improvement. It&rsquo;s that simple. This is what Scipio 
Biofuels Inc. was created to do.</p> 
<p>CORNERSTONE #2<br>
 Comprehensive System for Bioremediation of Eutrophic 
Water bodies &amp; Watersheds</p> 
<p>By using several different methods combined, wholly or in part during a 
portion of the year determined by photoperiod &amp; solar cycle, the existing 
nutrients in and around a lake can be drawn from their source.<br>
 By growing 
plants on automated hydroponic racks from rooting to harvest along a dedicated 
path. The specific plants are chosen based upon what contaminants are in and 
around the lake water cross-referenced by the species that have rapidity of 
growth as well as requiring uptake of trace elements matching as many entries 
on the list of contaminants as possible. Each different species of plant will 
then consume contaminants (trace nutrients) directly from the environment. For 
within the water itself we install algal mats which promote rapid algae growth 
with the property that the algae from the water will tend to stick to the mats 
to be removed from the lake with the mat. Removal of the mats occurs just 
before photoperiod decreases sharply at summer&rsquo;s end.<br>
 This means 
that when the die-off of the algae overgrowth that would then recycle those 
nutrients back into the water, those nutrients are instead taken up with the 
mats.</p> 
<p>This same type of timing model is used with terrestrial plants around the 
shoreline and as far out as contamination, access and funding allow.</p> 
<p>To eliminate stratification &amp; passively oxygenate the volume of the 
lake&rsquo;s water, a device equating to a smaller version of Cornerstone #3 
was originally created to be part of this bioremediation system.</p> 
<p>Many different techniques are initiated and discontinued in a very specific 
order, sequence, phase and period after which the area is then re-tested, plant 
species possibly adjusted then repeated annually for up to 40 years or more for 
heavily contaminated areas.<br>
 After the first 2 or 3 years, water as dirty 
as Lake Elsinore in California could be drinkable year-round. By that time, 
contamination levels should have decreased to allow more &amp; different plants 
to be grown as feed-stocks for other industries (cellulosic ethanol) offsetting 
the systems cost substantially. There are over 500 lakes in the southwest U.S. 
on EPA clean-up lists with funding waiting in vane, until now.</p> 
<p> It is a most important relationship to find/make/initiate between Scipio 
Biofuels &amp; high level EPA officials as soon as possible. Thus far, the EPA 
has been less than motivated to return our calls let alone actually help us 
with this. Even though this is how we assure enough clean potable water for 
everyone, not just Americans.</p> 
<p>CORNERSTONE #3<br>
 A method for wide-scale recovery of chemicals, now 
environmental contaminants like fertilizers.</p> 
<p>By observing which specific chemicals it is possible to economically 
extract from a given plant species, it is reasonable to anticipate that the 
ability to invert the dynamics of the bioremediation system mentioned in 
Cornerstone #2 above would be a potential source of chemicals for industry.<br>

 For example; assume an area is contaminated with a given chemical that is 
economically recoverable from a specific type of plant. Then, to grow as much 
of that plant as possible in order to in effect, recover those chemicals via 
the route of biological uptake coupled with chemical and mechanical extraction.
<br> Ergo, it is in another way potentially possible to turn a profit by 
cleaning up our environment and recycling chemicals once thought, 
&ldquo;consumed&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>CORNERSTONE #4<br>
 A wind powered method for passive de-acidification and 
oxygenation of the oceans.</p> 
<p>By using a floating, wind driven apparatus to inject pressurized ambient 
air at a given ocean depth, the dynamic we are manufacturing artificially is 
that of crashing waves, or artificial wave action. That is the only function of 
this device. The rate at which it functions is directly dependent on wind 
speed. When artificial wave action is initiated a number of interesting things 
begin to occur.</p> 
<p>As the bubbles rise, the air within exchanges some trace gasses with the 
seawater and will also become saturated with water vapor to 100% RH. As the air 
bubble reaches the surface it will contain more water vapor by volume than the 
ambient air. This overall increase in ambient humidity by the inclusion of this 
&ldquo;wet air&rdquo; will eventually result in increased rainfall somewhere.
</p> 
<p>By deploying large numbers (TBD) of this floating apparatus as a test by 
for example; dotting the Mississippi River Estuary, even miles out to sea the 
effects on the Gulf of Mexico&rsquo;s eutrophic estuarial dead zones will be 
significant and immediate. The increased oxygen levels from the simulated wave 
action will both attract sealife and reduce algae concentrations.<br>
 As the 
&ldquo;wet&rdquo; air mass in the atmosphere increases, eventually this extra 
fresh water vapor in the atmosphere will logically increase rainfall globally, 
including back onto the ocean itself.</p> 
<p>For de-acidification it is this added fresh water rain onto the 
ocean&rsquo;s surface that is the true agent of change. When pure H2O, contacts 
carbonic acid H2CO3, the CO2 molecule is broken off from the carbonic acid 
leaving water and CO2 separate again, thus raising the pH and liberating a 
molecule of CO2 from the seawater as it is raining at the surface.<br>
 With 
luck, the liberated CO2 will find its way to Cornerstone #5 below. The actual 
increase in rainfall in any one localized area near deployment of these 
machines will indicate increased rainfall eventually everywhere. Putting water 
in the air, by putting air in the water in this way can only serve us all very 
well.<br>
 Another place of potentially great benefit would be the Great 
Barrier Reef in Australia.</p> 
<p>We need not worry about covering every square mile of the seas with these 
machines. They should be concentrated where ocean currents are strongest and we 
allow the currents to distribute the oxygenated seawater for us where possible.
</p> 
<p>CORNERSTONE #5<br>
 Method for the removal of both particulates and CO2 
100%, directly from the atmosphere in one pass.</p> 
<p>For the sake of brevity I&rsquo;m going to describe the system using common 
objects for analogy based on the physical dynamics employed.</p> 
<p>Please imagine, a high volume PV solar powered vacuum pump connected to 
what is in essence sealed room with an inlet pipe dropping into a cistern 
creating in effect, an enormous solar powered hooka.</p> 
<p>What is actually in the cistern is limewater, an automated method for 
sensing &amp; replenishment of the lime and water, a drain and a 
bottom-cleaning device similar to that used in a swimming pool.<br>
 The CO2 
within the rising bubbles reacts with the limewater causing a precipitate of 
calcium carbonate to settle on the bottom permanently sequestering the CO2. To 
capture 100% of the particulates drawn in by the vacuum pump as the intake air 
is neither pre-filtered nor is it dry-filtered, it is by using water filtration 
(rising bubbles) the particulates in the air end up remaining suspended in the 
lime water.</p> 
<p> What the bottom cleaner does is gather and deposit for collection all of 
the calcium carbonate. The system also uses limewater for reasons of low 
expense, near zero toxicity, and simplicity. The reason a 100% effect on 
incoming air was required of the system on just two components (CO2 and 
particulates) was to assure the two competing dynamics within Climate Change 
remain in their present balance but become less intense.</p> 
<p>CORNERSTONE #6<br>
 Emissions free (almost) electrical power generation 
that preserves current upstream contracts.</p> 
<p>To manage the environmental sting out of electrical power generation 
without massive disruptions of service or political and/or social upheaval the 
current paradigms and local fiefdoms must be included as a part of the solution.
</p> 
<p>Adjacent to an example coal fired power plant we build algae cultivation 
capacity capable of sustaining the energy needs of the local community plus the 
difference between that, and the amount of CO2 needed to produce the algae 
annually to fuel a more flexible combined-cycle gas/steam turbine power system. 
When all is installed and running, only the CO2 necessary to grow the algae 
needed to power the secondary generation system is newly produced.</p> 
<p>The existing power entity is only generating power at approximately 5% of 
original capacity and in effect becomes a &ldquo;Licensed CO2 Producer&rdquo; 
in support of the downstream processes. The best part for all is that nobody 
has to look for a new job. This concept won&rsquo;t work everywhere. But we 
have a number of ways to accommodate different technical issues relating to 
coal, diesel, biomass, ethanol and natural gas fired power generation all with 
the same end result, green power generation for all.</p> 
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p> 
<p>These are the &ldquo;6 Cornerstones&rdquo; for a framework of what is today 
economically feasible yet still accomplishes what is necessary to potentially 
blunt the tip of Climate Change while simultaneously helping clean our world in 
other ways.</p> 
<p>It has been my intention to manufacture and deploy these technologies 
privately and at my own expense as profits from the algae based biofuels would 
allow. I have no reason yet to believe implementing these technologies on a 
global scale would (if handled properly) have any deleterious effects on the 
environment. But, much positive effect on geopolitics, ocean acidification 
&amp; cleanliness and Climate Change causing &ldquo;contamination&rdquo;. 
Creating an unknown number of jobs locally and globally isn&rsquo;t a bad thing 
either. I&rsquo;m in this not to get rich. I&rsquo;m here to help bioremediate 
CO2 and other chemicals from the environment and show how we can easily use 
wind-power to restore life to the oceans. I am here to show by doing that it 
can be done.</p> 
<p>By using all 6 of these processes in combination, collectively we can 
without great technical difficulty inexpensively and rather rapidly reverse the 
directional trends of Climate Change contamination and ocean acidification 
while we reclaim &amp; re-use chemical fertilizers from a number of sources. In 
that process, we revitalize the American economy by using one problem to fix 
another.</p> 
<p>When eventually appropriate in however many years, simply recycle the 
excess equipment from the processes no longer needed for environmental clean up 
but for maintenance. Considering the distributed deployment of the equipment, 
that could take a while. This way, the transition of employees from one skill 
set to another isn&rsquo;t a huge problem down the road.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your willingness to take the time to read about what I have 
created (and now improved). I&rsquo;ve always intended this for implementation 
for the benefit of a cleaner environment for all, especially for those who come 
after us.</p> Share: <br>

<p>As Detroit gears up for the 2011 North American International Auto Show at 
Cobo Center, I found myself wondering: &ldquo;What will it take to accelerate 
the transition of America to a carbon neutral society?&rdquo; Driven to reduce 
its dependency upon foreign crude oil, America has developed an appetite for 
clean, renewable energy. Federal emissions mandates and alternative liquid fuel 
blending requirements have been established. These, coupled with the 
development of advanced clean energy technologies, have converged and signify 
that vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt, 2011 Car of the Year, are here to stay. 
By 2025, half of the vehicles on American roads are projected to be powered by 
electric batteries or alternative fuels.</p> 
<p>Despite the national trend toward electric cars and other alternative fuel 
vehicles, there are over 250 million gasoline powered vehicles on American 
roads today. This includes light and heavy duty trucks and buses, many of which 
burn diesel fuel. National ambient air quality standards have been established 
and original equipment manufacturers (OEM&rsquo;s) have totally redesigned the 
diesel engines of the 70&rsquo;s to significantly reduce carbon emissions. 
However, tailpipe exhaust fumes from older model diesel engine trucks and buses 
remain a threat to human health.<br>
 Older model heavy-duty diesel engine 
trucks and buses release unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur 
oxides, nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and other toxic compounds. 
Although diesel trucks and buses account for only a small amount of hydrocarbon 
emissions and carbon monoxide emissions, they do contribute large amounts of 
NOx and particulates. Nitrogen oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, (used 
today as a dental anesthetic), is a major cause of greenhouse gas and air 
pollutants. Particulate matter (soot) is a mixture of microscopic solids and 
liquid droplets emitted from the tailpipes and suspended in the air. The size 
of the particles is directly linked to their potential to cause health 
problems. The smaller the particles, the greater the threat when breathed, as 
these particles pass through the nose and throat and lodge inside our lungs, 
and may work their way into our bloodstream.</p> 
<p>NOx emissions from diesel engine trucks and buses react chemically in the 
presence of sunlight and play a major role in the formation of ground-level 
ozone (smog). Despite industry improvements, this continues to pose a 
significant problem for air quality. Ground-level ozone is a respiratory 
irritant that is the most problematic in the summer months. It causes a wide 
range of health problems including chest pain, coughing and shortness of 
breath. Other problems caused by NOx and particulate matter include premature 
death, increased emergency room visits with respiratory symptoms and disease, 
damaged farm crops, acid rain and impairment of vision. These problems affect 
our elderly and children the most. America is on the right track, but must 
accelerate the pace of evolution toward a carbon neutral, clean energy society, 
for the sake of the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and the 
preservation of our natural resources.</p> 
<p>Detroit is not only the home of the North American International Auto Show, 
but is also the home of a company founded by Oliver Baer, a graduate of the 
University of Detroit Jesuit High School and General Motors Institute, (now 
Kettering University) in Flint, Michigan. Mr. Baer&rsquo;s vision was born out 
of a passionate desire to be part of the solution to the problems set forth 
herein. In 2006, he realized that the federal government created emissions 
mandates to take effect in 2010, for which it had no set standards and no 
infrastructure with which to implement and track compliance. Therefore, he set 
out on a journey, using his own money, to build an industry around solving the 
problem.<br>
 An electrical engineer by trade, Mr. Baer created a liquid fuel 
dispensing system that serves as a benchmark in the alternative fuels market 
sector. His patent-pending technology allows for precise blending of 
petroleum-based fuels with biofuels and pumping directly into the end 
user&rsquo;s vehicle. This fuel dispensing unit gathers information designed to 
help government agencies and private companies collect data required to track 
fuel credits in an audible manner, measure fuel economy, and calculate annual 
fuel and operation cost savings. In addition, this fully portable unit combines 
modular, above-ground storage and is equipped to dispense multiple fluids, 
including diesel emission fluids (DEF), ethanol blends, gasoline, petroleum 
diesel, motor oil, engine coolant and windshield wiper fluids.<br>
 Located 
inside of a Detroit icon known as Focus Hope, is a man, a company and an 
invention that presents a critical link to the carbon-neutral future of 
Michigan and America. The installation of an efficient, cost effective, clean 
fuels infrastructure will provide a significant boost to the biofuels industry 
and make America a cleaner, safer and better place to live. Oliver Baer and 
Clean Emissions Fluids, Inc., is just one of the many success stories arising 
out of the great city of Detroit, Michigan.</p>
