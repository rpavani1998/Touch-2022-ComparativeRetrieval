<p></p> 
<p>hey guys there is a huge debate over at another forum concerning this 
question...<br>
<br>
 Imagine a plane is sat on the beginning of a massive 
conveyor belt/travelator type arrangement, as wide and as long as a runway, and 
intends to take off. The conveyer belt is designed to exactly match the speed 
of the wheels at any given time, moving in the opposite direction of rotation.
<br> There is no wind.<br>
 Can the plane take off?<br>
<br>
 Just wanted to 
know what you guys thought about it. I say it's not taking off.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p></p> As long as the aircraft is moving at lift speed regardless of how it 
is moving at that speed, it can take-off.<br>
<br>
 If the wings are generating 
enough lift, the plane will lift into the air.<br>

<p></p> No, the plane will not takeoff.<br>
<br>
 The reason? Relative wind.
<br> <br>
 Planes make lift by air moving over the wings. Whether the wind is 
blowing, or the engines pushing the plane forward, air is moving over the wings 
to provide lift.<br>
<br>
 If you are stationary on a conveyor belt, there is 
absolutely no wind moving over the wings, and hence no lift.<br>

<p></p> Oops, I think I misunderstood your question Sovietjet...<br>
<br>
 I 
thought you were stating if the conveyor built is run at a high enough speed to 
propel the aircraft up to lift speed, but I just noticed you meant running the 
conveyor belt in the<b>opposite</b> direction, while the aircraft moves forward 
at that same exact speed. Thus it stays stationary.<br>
<br>
 So what you're 
saying is if the plane is running on a treadmill. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
 Then yes, it 
will not fly as it is not physically moving forward. It's position is remaining 
fixed the entire time.<br>

<p></p> It's not about how fast you can make the wheels spin. It's about how 
fast the air moves over the wings.<br>
<br>
 So the plane will roll along but 
never lift off.<br>

<p></p> yes the aircraft would take off, the conveyor belt will cause the 
wheels to spin in the opposite direction of movement, but eventually the thrust 
from the engines will counter the push of the conveyor belt. The wheels will 
spin at an infinite speed, but this will not push the aircraft back, the force 
of the engines will move the aircraft forward and it will eventually take off 
normally. The aircraft will continue to move forward at takeoff speed, but the 
wheels may well be spinning at 1000+ mph.<br>
<br>
 Just because the wheels are 
turning doesnt mean the aircraft is moving with them!<br>

<p></p> Hmmm interesting. The more that I think about it, the more I think it 
could happen. I don't really know how to put it into words though.<br>
<br>
 I 
guess you can say the thrust of the A/C is pushing against the air, and would 
therefore propel it forward, regardless if the conveyor belt was matching the 
speed of the wheels or not.<br>
<br>
 So, the speed of the wheels could be 
equivalent to, say, 100mph, but the airplane could actually be going 300mph, or 
have a 200mph relative wind.<br>
<br>
 So yes, I change my mind. It would be 
possible, but it would take a longer distance than a regular runway due to lack 
of friction. (ie a car on ice accelerating vs a car on pavement)<br>
<br>

<i>The wheels will spin at an

<br>
<br>
 
The conveyor belt in the question is not designed to push the aircraft back, 
just match the rotation speed of the wheels.<br>
<br>
 The wheels on an 
aircraft are just freewheeling at takeoff, with forward thrust provided by the 
engines but the traction and forward motion is still a component of the 
wheel/ground interaction. An aircraft at takeoff is never going faster than the 
rotation speed of the wheels.<br>
<br>
 If the conveyor belt exactly cancelled 
out the motion of the wheels, then as others on this thread have said, there 
would be no air movement over the wings and thus no lift produced. The engines 
could be generating 100% thrust but if theres no forward motion because its 
cancelled out by the moving ground then the aircraft will never get into the 
air.<br>

<i>I guess you can say the 
thrust of the A/C is pushing against the air, and would therefore propel it

<br>
<br>
 However the thrust is provided, the actual motion 
is set against whatever the aircraft is sitting on at the time. If that 
'ground' acts negatively on the forward motion in any way then you reduce the 
effect of the thrust.<br>
<br>
 Thust doesnt produce some magical component 
that makes aircraft fly, it needs to produce forward motion. If that motion is 
retarded by the ground moving backward at the same speed as the forward motion, 
then you are never going to get air movement over the wing.<br>
<br>
 Think of 
how a tail wind affects an aircraft on takeoff - it reduces the lift produced 
by the wing and can prove to be costly as now you need to either go faster to 
lift off, or climb slower. Just think of this that you have a tail wind that 
ALWAYS matches the speed of the aircraft.<br>

<br>
 Again, I would have to disagree. If you held the brakes on 
ice, and firewalled the throttle, you would still move forward, even though 
your wheels are not. There are a few situations in which the wheels could be 
moving slower than the aircraft.<br>
<br>
 The airplane would move forward in 
relation to the solid ground even though it is on the conveyor belt. Anyone

<br>
 Wouldnt work. <br>
<br>
 ALl of you 
claiming it will work are overlooking one fairly major point:<br>
<br>
 The 
thread starter said that the conveyor belt moved backwards to match the forward 
speed of the wheels at all times.<br>
<br>
 This will cancel out all forward 
motion, totally and utterly. You could stick a million jet engines behind the 
aircraft, but it must be moving forward to generate lift and if the conveyor 
belt cancels out that forward motion then the aircraft isnt going anywhere. 
Until take off, the forward motion is a component of the wheel/ground 
interaction and since you are removing this component then the aircraft cannot 
go forward.<br>
<br>
 Aircraft are just big road vehicles until they move quick 
enough to generate lift. An aircraft doesnt just leap into the air and its off.

 Thrust acts accordingly to Newtons Third Law of 
Motion - every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In the case of an 
aircraft, the reaction of the engines is that of forward motion, against 
whatever medium it is stationary. But the ground the aircraft is sitting on in 
this case is NOT stationary, its providing an exactly CANCELLING force pushing 
the aircraft back.<br>

<br>
 Yes, because ice is not frictionless. What we are 
talking about here is a PERFECTLY NEGATIVE FRICTIONAL surface, a surface that 
provides exactly the opposite friction to the wheels and thus an opposite force 
to the forward thrust of the engines.<br>
<br>
 To the laws of physics 
gentlemen, the aircraft will be moving forward at take off speed, but since an 
opposite force is being exerted on the aircraft, it isnt actually going 
anywhere.<br>

 But the engines 
are acting on the air, which is stationary, so the engines by newtons theory 
will still produce forward thrust, moving the aircraft forward relative to the 
air.<br>
<br>
 The conveyor belt speed is set to cancel the speed of the wheels 
turning, not the forward movement of the aircraft. The thrust of the engines 
will push the aircraft forward, and the conveyor belt will rotate the wheels in 
the opposite direction. The turning of the wheels will not excert any force on 
the aircraft, so it will continue to move forward.<br>

<br>
<br>
 Ahh, yes. Physics. I was actually a physics major 
for 3 years. There is no opposite force being exerted on the aircraft.<br>
<br>

 There is no force counteracting the thrust of the aircraft, therefore, the 
thrust would propel the aircraft forward.<br>
<br>
 At first I thought of it 
your way Richard, but after thinking about it for a while and the physics side 
of things it will be possible for the aircraft to build speed.<br>

<p></p> Wheres the lift coming from in order for the aircraft to take off?<br>

<br> Thats all you need to work out.<br>
<br>
 If the force exterted backward 
on the aircraft is the same as the force exterted forward by the engines, then 
theres going to be no lift. Simple as that.<br>
<br>
 In this case, theres no 
air movement because the air is technically acting as a tail wind in exactly 
the same proportion as the forward motion of the aircraft. Thus no lift.<br>

<p></p> I don't think you're seeing the full picture. You have to look at the 
overall scheme of things.<br>
<br>
 There is no force being exerted backwards 
on the plane. None at all. The wheels are not physically connected to the 
engine, so the speed they move at is irrelevent to the speed of the actual 
aircraft itself.<br>
<br>
 Because the wind is calm, we are assuming, the 
thrust from the engines will work against it, therefore propelling the plane 
forward in relation to the air. The wheel speed and conveyor speed can totally 
be neglected. As long as that air is calm, the thrust will propel the plane 
forward, which will produce airflow over the wings.<br>

<p></p> Ok, after all my arguing AGAINST the aircraft taking off, Im going to 
swallow my pride and change my stance &nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The aircraft will take 
off.<br>
<br>
 Why?<br>
<br>
 Start the conveyor moving without the engines on. 
In a perfect world (since we dont know anything other than the question, we 
have to assume perfection), the plane will sit still because the wheels will 
freewheel backward.<br>
<br>
 The engines add an additional thrust component to 
the equation, which is not affected by the conveyor. Thus forward motion can be 
generated and thus also lift.<br>
<br>
 Apologies &nbsp;<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
 How is the air acting as a tailwind? The convayor belt isnt 
moving the air! Its not even moving the aircraft, its simply spinning the 
wheels.<br>
<br>
 It doesnt matter how fast the wheels spin, the aircraft will 
still move forward as the engines push against the air and generate thrust.<br>

 With this description, 
the a/c will not move relative to the surrounding. So there will not be any air 
flowing over the wing thus no lift is produced.<br>
<br>
 See it the other way 
&acute;round:<br>
 Your build a really BIG ventilator and place it in front of 
the a/c.<br>
 You apply the brakes of the a/c and then turn on your very big 
ventilator producing a stable wind at 200 knots. As this head wind is greater 
than the rotating speed of the aircraft, the wings will produce enough lift to 
let the a/c take off from the ground - but only as long as it is within the 
produced currents and the relative airspeed is maintained: This will require 
the a/c to be kept on a leash, making this a 100 ton-kite ...&nbsp;<br>

107 Matt72033: i suggest you read the 
posts! <br>

feet propel you when you run. On a treadmill the place where your foot lands on 
the belt is constantl <br>

RPM, read the assumption. The conveyor is never slower! Having read all the 
good points by all participants (includi <br>

Unfortunately, airplanes are not runners. <br>

furthermore, it has no practical applications since even in the best case 
scenario it lengthens the take-off roll by a little bit. I guess it's j <br>

direction of the treadmill and all the airliners would get a free takeoff to 
start them on the <br>

running in the same direction as the airplane, then the airplane would take off 
after the 6000' of travel wit <br>

114 A346Dude: True enough, but the 
wheels would of course have to be locked! <br>

agree, just in case I sound otherwise. This is a great thread; reminds me of 
that one about airplane filled with pigeons, the one someon <br>

say more on this subject. Unless the wheels slide down the belt, the aircraft

You are not grasping the fact that airplanes do not depend at all on the ground

120 David L: 
I've joined this too late, too. Having rushed through the posts, I was so 
looking forward to having a go at the conveyor-belt-gripping-the-axles idea,

121 Fokker Lover: Listen, Slamclick and I are both telling you the 
same thing. The wheels and landing gear have one purpose, and one purpose only. 
That is to keep the <br>

122 Ariis: It is sliding against the belt

tell you. If the airplane takes off (as y <br>

123 David L: Apparently 
not... NO! Wheels (dragged by the aircraft) move at 150 kts in one direction, 
the belt moves at 150 kts in the opposite direction - ground <br>

124 
A346Dude: You just had to get that out, didn't you. <br>
<br>
125 David L: Sure 
did! I have to confess it did take a while for my brain to get into gear on 
this one. Now all I need is for someone to come out with old &quot;everyt <br>

<br> 126 David L: Misunderstanding of basic shopping trolley physics. The 
wheels would wobble all over the place. The trolley would do a triple sulko, 
shoot off to the <br>

127 Ralgha: You're both trying to explain 
something that won't happen. The belt can try all it wants to stop the wheels 
from making forward progress, but it can' <br>

128 SlamClick: Let's put to 
rest a side issue that is not part of the question. That is the &quot;exactly 
match the speed of the wheels at any given time, moving in the o <br>
<br>
129 
SlamClick: That would only be true if the plane was driven through the wheels 
like a car. How many times does that have to be said? <br>
<br>
130 Airfoilsguy
: In order for the plane to reach takeoff speed it needs to over come the 
friction of the air and the tires and inertia. The friction that the tires cau 
<br> <br>
131 David L: Strictly speaking, it's the friction of the wheel 
bearings - tyres are designed to provide as much friction as possible. But your 
point is valid. &nbsp; <br>

132 SlamClick: Well bring them on! Until 
everyone grasps the simple truth that the airplane will take off unless 
something stops the motion of the CENTER OF THE AXL <br>

133 David L: 
Well, assuming you could find one that behaves, I think the shopping trolley 
analogy is a good one. The argument that an external force pulling the t <br>

<br> 134 Ariis: This is all probably because of incostintency in how one 
understands the initial post, in terms of the 'design' of the conveyor. As I 
understand it, <br>
<br>
135 SlamClick: I think I don't understand which side 
of this you are arguing. Let me ask you for a one-word answer. Would the plane 
take off? Yes. No.[Edited 2005-1 <br>
<br>
136 David L: Why should the belt 
accelerate any faster than the aircraft (or its wheels)? If the belt were 
spinning infinitely fast, it wouldn't match the speed o <br>
<br>
137 David L: 
Yes, definitely. I agree with you so I've goofed somewhere. Let me take another 
look at what I said. <br>
<br>
138 SlamClick: I took this as meaning that your 
opion was NO it would not take off and you were lining up quotes in support of 
that. My dumb. <br>
<br>
139 Ariis: I said 'the belt and the wheels'. The 
wheels are spinning infinitely fast too. The belt is only trying to catch up to 
the speed of the wheels (which <br>

140 David L: I was saying that this, 
which shows how it would take off, is a good analogy: Then I was attempting to 
show how this, which attempts to show that it <br>

I just don't see where infinite speed comes into it . If the aircraft starts to

trouble visualizing this (the other being the difference between the wheels

world of aviation the axles are pulled forward by the rest of the plane. The

The wheels would freewheel backwards - cancelling the conveyor belt - even with

I understood the question a lot sooner than you did, mister. <br>

SlamClick: Well, that is why I said &quot;might be.&quot; There are three 
engineers in the world who have common sense. I wonder who the other two are.

silly question, how can there be 100+ posts?&quot; But then I realized that 
it's not that easy. This <br>
<br>
158 Ralgha: Which is why SlamClick and I 
have both stated the correct phrasing of the question. <br>
<br>
159 A346Dude: 
Keta, A really good summary of the fundamental problem that I think is 
responsible for the size of this thread. <br>
<br>
160 Bond007: That's it right 
there. The fact that wheels aren't being turned by the engine is irrelevant. 
The wheels DO need to turn in order to takeoff - and bef <br>
<br>
161 Ralgha: 
True, however there is nothing preventing the wheels from making forward 
movement, which is the flaw in your understanding. Speed does not equal forc 
<br> <br>
162 Ralgha: Right, I overlooked the &quot;might be&quot; part... <br>

<br> 163 Bond007: Yes, the conveyor moving in the opposite direction at the 
same speed is doing that - that's the whole purpose of this conveyor! Jimbo <br>
<br> 164 Ralgha: No, it's not! The wheels are free spinning, that's the whole 
idea of a wheel, it allows the object to which the wheels are attached (which 
includes t <br>
<br>
165 PPVRA: Wait a second - The wheels will be spinning 
fast, really fast. That means there will be less friction that the engines have 
to overcome, no? Kinda lik <br>
<br>
166 Ralgha: No, there are two types of 
friction, static and dynamic. Each is a constant, which the dynamic being less 
(much less often) than static. The friction <br>

I'm watching from the control tower and for every one foot my airplane moves 
forward, the runway magically moves backward one foot ....wh <br>
<br>
168 Jean 
Leloup: And this has no effect on the motion of the plane; it simply means that 
the wheels will be spinning twice as fast. JL <br>
<br>
169 Ralgha: No, from 
your vantage point in the tower, the takeoff would look completely normal. The 
airplane is moving forward just as normal, only the wheels are <br>

Turnit56N: While I don't want to wade knee-deep into the debate, I'm reminded 
of the old saying &quot;You know you've landed gear-up when it takes full power 
to taxi <br>
<br>
171 MD-90: Holy cow. Action = opposite equal reaction 
Airspeed does not necessarily = groundspeed <br>
<br>
172 No1racer: Hey all, 
Something that I feel hasn't been brought up is this: We are all here talking 
about the wheels being free-standing. However, how do planes st <br>

Ralgha: True, and also not influenced at all by the belt. Airplanes do not move 
fast enough when on the ground for this effect to occur (if indeed we are thi

174 PPVRA: Ok, air friction - right? Thanks for clearing that up. 
Cheers <br>

175 SlamClick: Okay if finally occurs to me that there is a 
language trap in the way the problem is being posed. Let me give you an 
example: Three guys check into a <br>
<br>
176 Ralgha: No, this is discounting 
air friction. This is just friction between the block and the surface. <br>
<br>
<br> <br>
177 Bond007: I guess the clear explanation that I haven't seen (or 
probably missed), is that a jet engine, or a piston prop even, acts on the air 
around it, which <br>

178 PPVRA: Hmmm... been a while since my last 
physics class. So you're saying that after a certain speed the friction with 
the surface will increase? I remember <br>

179 SlamClick: Okay, before I 
get accused of hijacking the thread let me answer: The way I phrase that 
question only makes it more difficult to answer. The trick is <br>
<br>
180 
Ralgha: SlamClick and I have said that many times. <br>
<br>
181 Ralgha: The 
friction is constant, the force imparted by that friction is dependent on the 
speed of the object. <br>
<br>

wouldn't take off but Slamclick changed my mind (check rply 56, cable &amp; 
winch analogy) &amp; I agree with Bond007, the k <br>

187 Sovietjet: How can 
the wheels spin faster than the belt though....if they are both equal the plane 
will never move no matter how much thrust(assuming no slippage <br>

Sovietjet: I think the original question was poorly worded IMHO...the problem 
doesn't specify whether the belt matches the wheel's speed in RPM, tangential 
speed <br>

the point where people said that 'relative wind' would be generated. An

in the desired direction, which is really the point. If you mean the wheels as

would rotate, but a <br>

first of all thought that the aeroplane would stand still. Then I imagined it 
'gaining' on the conveyor, and theref <br>

<br>
202 Sudden: Am not 
totally with you on that one. The belt would not work as a break as it's just a 
substitue for the rwy. All it would cause, in my narrow mind, <br>
<br>
203 
NAV20: Not by any means sure myself, Sudden. But I'm going on the 'terms of 
reference' as stated in the thread-starter:- So more thrust equals more 'speed' 
- <br>

204 A346Dude: It seems like just as everyone has agreed that the 
aircraft will take off, someone new enters and says it won't. The point is, 
even though the conveyo <br>

205 Sudden: This theory works totally the 
other way around for me. The A/C will not move an inch, and also not rotate as 
there is no airflow over the wings. I am <br>

fail to understand. It's impossible for the belt to negate the movement; when 
the belt accelerates to catch the wheels' speed, the w <br>

two cents : 1/ aircraft/wheels/belt do not form a closed system as in the

immediately thought of a runner on a treadmill which lead to my post and later 
realised the true <br>

209 Darrenthe747: so far i think slamclick has hit 
the nail on the head. when i first read the original post i was convinced it 
would not move. my opinion has changed.. <br>
<br>
210 NAV20: Look at it 
another way, guys. The aeroplane is travelling at 90 knots. The wheels are 
therefore turning at the appropriate revolutions for that speed. <br>
<br>
211 
Sovietjet: the skateboard analogy doesn't work....if you pull on the rope to 
make it go faster the conveyor will go faster in the opposite direction. Then

standing on the conveyor. You, the plane and the belt will be accelerating at

conditions, the situat <br>

217 NAV20: I agree, Bond007, that in real life 
the engines would move the aeroplane, the conveyor wouldn't be able to cope, 
and the wheels would skid until the <br>

only thing in this scenario that would stop the jet engine from moving the 
plane forward would be friction between the wheels and the conveyor. S <br>

else who got an email from a none A.net member by name Tom LaPrise? He stated 
that Pihero had the correct answer. Aim fo <br>

223 Bond007: So do those 
who say, yes it will takeoff, agree that the wheels MUST be going faster than 
the conveyor in order to get forward motion, and therefore <br>

224 
A346Dude: Absolutely not. As SlamClick has already indicated (I'm sure many 
more times than he would have liked to!), wheel rotation is not required to get 
for <br>
<br>
225 LeanOfPeak: However, getting forward motion without wheel 
rotation requires that the traction of the tires be broken (NOW we're getting 
somewhere). <br>
<br>
226 Joness0154: Here's another thing. Its all in what the 
conveyor belt is moving in relation to, and whether you measure the conveyor 
belt speed at the point of the <br>

<br>
<br>
227 David L: Assuming we're 
going with the &quot;silly&quot; version, I see the point about the wheels 
needing to rotate at half the speed I was thinking of (i.e. slipping) <br>
<br>

228 Kay: They will not spin as fast as you are saying, but only as a result of 
the wheel struts wanting to move forward, they will want to spin, but the turni

229 David L: The wheel strut is not in contact with the conveyor 
belt. Imagine your foot was a wheel strut. Now put on a pair of roller skates 
and put your foot o <br>

230 LeanOfPeak: OK, let's go with the 
roller-skates analogy. If you are on a treadmill on roller skates, your 
roller-skate wheels have a speed with respect to the tre <br>

231 David L: 
I &quot;get your drift&quot; but I'm still not convinced that this is the same 
as having the brakes locked. I'm running out of ways to picture this - as you sa
<br> <br>
232 BuckFifty: I think people still don't get it, haha. This 
question, again, is quite farcical. It's akin to the problem of &quot;if a tree 
falls in the forest, and no o <br>
<br>
233 LeanOfPeak: DavidL, you are exactly 
correct. It is not necessary (Or desirable) to lock the wheels. Doing so would 
flat-spot the tires before blowing them out and <br>
<br>
234 David L: Yeah. 
The bottom line is that the question as stated isn't nearly as interesting to 
discuss as a lot of us thought it was. <br>
<br>
235 MD-90: Obviously, this is 
a calculus problem, and there is a limit. I think that this paradox was thought 
up by someone who accidentally misunderstood the pr <br>
<br>
236 David L: ... 
or was thinking about a conveyor belt which moves at an equal and opposite 
speed to that of the aircraft, like all the same discussions elsewhere <br>
<br>
237 David L: Little did I realise at the time how much the question resembles 
that routine. <br>
<br>
238 FLY2HMO: I would happily volunteer to fly my remote 
controlled airplane off a conveyor if somebody is willing to build a conveyor 
for it. <br>
<br>
239 LeanOfPeak: Also an easy question. The statement is a 
lie. The correct half of the reasoning that leads to the impression that this 
is an unresolvable vicious ci <br>

dealing with speed <br>

are not dealing with a real world situation here. Some of the condition <br>

Sorry Slam, I've been sleeping and working so I wasn't here to back you up. To 
all the people who argue that the question as worded at the beginning o <br>

different one. I couldn't remember the details but apparently it's from Episode

253 Keta: Yes that's what 
we have been saying since long ago. <br>

argument. Infinity means infinity. Sorry my friend given the condition of the 
original question (which is actually a puzzle), &quot;The conv <br>

DarkBlue: Here's my two cents... Can the aircraft move down the runway? No. Can 
it take off? Yes. Now before you all gasp at this absurd combination of statemen

256 Ralgha: You do not understand infinity. It is not a quantity, it 
can not be compared as a quantity. Infinity &gt; Infinity Infinity &lt; 
Infinity Infinity != Infin <br>

257 FlyMKG: PEOPLE! The question is all 
relative to the way you read it. You can either picture it as: (a) the conveyor 
moves 150 kts, the plane stays put, the c <br>
<br>
258 Ralgha: Conveyor speed 
CAN NOT equal wheel speed. The reason for this is that there is nothing holding 
the airplane back. Nothing counters the engine force. <br>
<br>
259 Ralgha: 
Unless you put an anchor on the airplane, this situation will not happen. Speed 
is not linear. A wheel's speed is typically measured in RPMs. I made <br>

260A346Dude: Ralgha is correct, his statement is true and that is why the 
airplane will take off. The conveyor belt is not holding the airplane back, 
even though <br>

reference from the ground to the conveyor. If you imagine the conveyor as 
fixed, and instead of the conveyor mov <br>

263 Fokker

turning. Why are the wheels turning? Because the plane is moving forward. If the

264 LeanOfPeak: If we have a magic conveyor that, as the question was 
put, always matches exactly the speed of the wheels, the only way to have 
groundspeed or airspee <br>

265 Flyf15: If you were to push forward on the 
model on a treadmill, say, make it go 10mph forward. Well, the treadmill then 
assumes that speed in reverse... Now <br>
<br>
266 LeanOfPeak: ...And you've 
just broken the cardinal rule of the question at hand. You said it yourself. 
The treadmill is going 10 mph. The wheels are turning 20. <br>
<br>
267 
LeanOfPeak: Nope. The corollary to the question at hand would make the speed 
through the water the speed with respect to the treadmill and the speed with 
respect <br>

268 Flyf15: Wait wait wait, so the treadmill and wheels have 
to be moving at the same speed? I guess I must've read this wrong. Then this 
problem can't exist. The <br>

269 Navymidn: Through the fact that I can't 
seem to get this problem out of my head, I will try to explain why the aircraft 
will take off. If the conveyor belt spin <br>

exactly what the original post says, and I did say that there is no way for the 
engines to generate this motion, but granted that, if mo <br>

conclusion I mentioned, with the difference of stating that things still go on a

stand there!!! and take beautiful photos Really, I think we can remove the 
plane and simplify the example. If I put a wheel on a treadmi <br>

David L: The wheels would have to skid - the question didn't say they couldn't. 
But where does this magic force come from, the one that causes the wheels to s

279 Flyf15: Uhh, why? It seems like it'd be totally and completely 
obvious that you wouldn't have any trouble moving the wheel in this situation.

280 Mighluss: I'm sorry, I'm to lazy to read the hole threat, but 
after reading a few takes, and thinking about it, I say... If the belt can 
really match the speed <br>

281 Keta: You still don't understand... you 
will never get a treadmill that will match the wheels' speed. No matter the 
belt, you will move. <br>

overlooked points. --------------------------- Firstly the the beginning of the 
experiment... So the plane is sit <br>

agree with both sides (are there still just two? ) Both of the above statements 
are accurate in the real world. However, the problem <br>

284 OE-LDA: 
Incredible, isn't it? Why and how on earth should the plane accelerate the 
belt? It is the other way round, the belt will accelerate or decelerate th <br>

<br> 285 Kay: Welcome to the irreversible zone of the &quot;It will fly&quot; 
group. &nbsp; My views exactly. The treadmill will match the wheels' speed 
exactly because that's a <br>

(Please consider these questions as rhetorical!) A plane intending to do a

try to convert the 'must-flys'. You step on a moving walkway and then realise 
that you're going the wrong way and start walking back. But wal <br>

288 
David L: NO! You're still thinking about a force being applied by the 
person/aircraft to the belt. The force of the aircraft's engines is not 
transmitted to t <br>

289 David L: For those who think the force of the 
belt travelling at the same speed in the opposite direction cancels the 
aircraft's speed, what do you think will <br>
<br>
290 NAV20: David L, please 
forget the wheels. The engine thrust generates forward movement. The conveyor 
negates it. <br>
<br>
291 Kay: I was going to answer you to tell you &quot;you 
will now be attacked by the 'it will fly' group saying that the wheels of the 
plane have no role&quot; The &quot;It <br>
<br>
292 Keta: No, the force is not 
made by the wheels. Your legs yes they do a force. It's different. Once 
again... [Edited 2005-12-01 15:24:40] <br>
<br>
293 ZSOFN: NAV20, you seem to 
still be thinking in quite simplistic terms. See my post further above about 
this. Think about it this way: The analogy of walking <br>
<br>
294 David L: 
You cannot forget the wheels - they are crucial! Stand on a plank of wood while 
you're wearing rubber-soled shoes. Get someone to lift one end of the <br>

295Fokker Lover: This is where you are making your mistake. You are using the 
walkway to propel yourself. The airplane is not. I like to take things apart to 
see how <br>

296 David L: They have a role - to isolate the aircraft from 
the horizontal force from the conveyor belt (excluding wheel bearing friction, 
which can't be that mu <br>

297 ZSOFN: Further to what I said, I am with 
the people who say it can fly in general, however something that is yet to be 
argued over: Once the plane gets to r <br>

298 Kay: ZSOFN: The wheels 
don't drive the plane. Planes can take off with wheels turning at zero speed. 
But this plane here won't take off because the wheel <br>

299 ZSOFN: Eh? 
Read what I said again! And the struts will move forward as I thought we were 
assuming the wheels to be able to turn without resistance.[Edited 2 <br>

300Kay: Finally you are looking at it from the right angle: the conveyor is 
infinite resistance. Kay <br>

301 ZSOFN: HAHA! I've figured it out... The 
aircraft applies thrust The aircraft initially remains almost stationary and 
the wheels spin up rapidly The ground ef <br>

in the upright position, and carry it along forwards. Now get someone to take a 
plank of <br>

304 Fokker Lover: Tell me exactly how you are keeping the 
struts from moving forward. Don't say by spinning the wheels backwards, because 
you would be wrong. The only <br>
<br>
305 ZSOFN: The only way in which the 
belt can transfer energy is: a) into the wheels, and if we're modelling them as 
frictionless, this energy cannot be transmit <br>
<br>
306 NAV20: Guys, about 
speed. Take an aeroplane on the runway (an ORDINARY one!). You can express its 
speed any number of ways - in knots, in mph, in kph, or as <br>

307 
Mighluss: The plane is not accelerating the belt, the belt is accomoding to the 
speed of the wheels. anyway, after seeing that graphic of the man pushing, I st 
<br> <br>
308 David L: Why not? The wheels isolate the movement of the conveyor 
belt from the aircraft. You're still thinking of a car. Look again at the 
bicycle example wh <br>
<br>
309 ZSOFN: Guys, NAV20 does have a point. If the 
plane was to move forward, it would have to mean that the wheels were spinning 
faster than the conveyor belt was <br>

310 Saintsman: I can believe that 
this is still going. Its an impossible situation, therefore all your 
comparisons and assumptions are invalid. Because its an imposs <br>

311 
Fokker Lover: Yes, it will move!!!!! The conveyor has no way of transferring 
its energy past the wheels. We have 2 opposing forces here. One is trying to 
drag the <br>

312 ZSOFN: Fokker Lover, Yes, physics would normally dictate 
that the aircraft would move forward. BUT as one can assimilate from the 
question, this belt in its <br>

313 Bond007: This is a perfect example, 
but you have it completely wrong! Of course it will move! It's quite the 
opposite of what you said. It's already been said <br>
<br>
314 Kay: Yes, 
except by skidding the wheels! If the person with the ply of wood works like 
this belt, he will counter exactly any movement from the wheels. An <br>

315 David L: I think that's been well established now but there is still an 
element of the debate about a conveyor belt moving at the same speed as the 
aircraft b <br>
<br>
316 Kay: If the belt is moving opposite the aircraft's 
speed, it will fly. The wheels will just turn double. Alllllll this argument is 
about the belt turning <br>
<br>
317 Bond007: Ignore my previous post I 
completely understand the theories from the &quot;It will fly&quot; crowd, but 
there is one thing wrong with the whole theory. You rea <br>

318 Fokker 
Lover: Stop it how? A free wheeling wheel can do only one thing. That is rotate 
on its axis. It cannot stop a plane from moving. It can only spin. That's wh

319 Fokker Lover: I should have been in bed 3 hours ago. If you guys 
figure out how to make an airplane stop moving by spinning its wheels backwards 
wake me up. I plan <br>

320 Bond007: I'm with you Kay A silly situation, 
but it cannot happen unless the belt and wheels are going at different speeds. 
Example: Imagine a wheel fixed at <br>

321 Mighluss: Now I caught the 
idea, if you don't push the brakes, the plane will not skid, but is an 
impossible anyway, as plane start moving forward, the wheels <br>

322 Kay: 
Bingo Jimbo! Fokker_Lover, I totally agree with you. Totally. But, how can a 
wheel (regardless of anything else, no plane, nothing) move forward on a <br>

<br> 323 Keta: I thought so too... It's the opposite way. The rules of the game 
are wrong, the first question is based on a false statement. It's impossible 
that yo <br>
<br>
324 ZSOFN: Is anyone going to read my posts? They seem to be 
ignored yet I feel they answer these latest questions. <br>
<br>
325 Bond007: I 
read it You are correct. The plane will take off, but only by the wheels going 
faster than the conveyor. The question says this cannot happen...so <br>
<br>

326ZSOFN: Well this is my point of contention that no-one's addressing. With a 
conveyor belt moving SO fast, the airflow above it that it creates, whilst turbu
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
327 Kay: ZSOFN, you still have to establish that the 
conveyor will turn so fast. There's no telling if it will turn at all. We have 
a weird deadlock situation <br>
<br>
328 ZSOFN: Well the assumptions that lead 
to the conveyor belt turning so fast: When the whole system is at rest it is in 
unstable equilibrium, that is, all it t <br>
<br>
329 Kay: hmm. Which means the 
belt will run at infinite speed. If this inifinite energy indeed creates an 
airflow, it could just snap the wings of the plane, <br>
<br>
330 ZSOFN: I 
agree 100%! <br>
<br>
331 David L: No but, as I stated several times, I've lost 
interest in the question as stated - it's just too ridiculous to contemplate. 
However, there is still an <br>

332 XORDLLAA: I cannot believe this thread 
has almost 900 posts..... It seems like some of the people don't know what 
makes an airplane fly, why there are engines a <br>
<br>
333 David L: This is a 
situation which can't happen so whether the plane would take off is irrelevant, 
undefined. <br>
<br>
334 Bond007: So are you saying it'll fly? Or are you 
agreeing it's a scenario that could never happen? I'm sure that most of the 
people that say it won't fly, and <br>
<br>
335 XORDLLAA: ...and yet, I don't 
know how to count I'm sorry, small correction - &quot;over 300 posts&quot; <br>

<br> 336 Sovietjet: What have I created..... <br>
<br>
337 XORDLLAA: Under the 
circumstances given in thread starter it will NOT fly. It is impossible. It is 
like arguing: how far can you jump, while running on gym's e <br>

338 
VuelingAirbus: can someone here please make a list of people who think it can 
fly opposed to one with people who say it can't? I will put all people who say 
it can't <br>

comparison. When you jump, you are propelling yourself via the ground. 
Airplanes do not do this. Everyone w <br>

the wheel from turning and the &quot;ground&quot; will move in the same 
direction as the air <br>

why the airplane would move. Read again SlamClick, David L and many other's

349ZSOFN: Ok, but is my point not valid? Would a fast-moving large conveyor 
belt not create airflow? <br>

that the aircraft will take off. Your ice skate analogy is an accurate 
representation of the problem we are discussing, sin <br>

discusion. So if the plane sits on ice skates it will accelarate depending <br>

<br> <br>
<br>
352 Keta: Well I can't agree with you. The belt and wheels work 
the same way the ice does i.e. there is no friction thus no force acting 
against the airplane. <br>

generally agree with the theories of those who think it will, these supporters 
seem to overlook the initial rule a <br>

causing so many misunderstandings, I thought I might update my walkway analogy 
to include wheels - by introducing a baggage car <br>

think that's generally true. Pretty much every &quot;yes&quot; merchant has 
stated, quite some time ago, that the belt is an impossibility. I, for one, <br>

about its axis, can its ce <br>

must assume from the original question? I t <br>

362 Keta: Please read 
SlamClick's posts. Don't they make any sense to you? Wrong!! First you 
accelerate the airplane to 340 knots relative to the air or ground <br>

ZSOFN: Can we assume any airflow to be created by the moving belt? By the way 
conveyor belts are often used in wind tunnels as they can affect airflow quite

364 David L: Sorry, NAV20 but... NO! &nbsp; That represents a car 
towing a trailer. The motive power is still provided by transmitting force from 
your feet to the bel <br>

complicated. I mean, the question and assumptions are very basic, there is no 
need to consider everything. Are y <br>

366 ZSOFN: OK, fair enough. If we 
forget about airflow generated, then I got to say that the aircraft's going 
nowhere. David L, remember the initial conditions <br>

there are two groups, and I think you are describing the scneario where the 
belt will match the speed of the plane. In that case yes it will fl <br>

but clearly the problem didn't have this in mind. Perhaps it would be better to 
ignore the wings and just ask whether the plan <br>

&quot;ice-skate&quot; on concrete. What do you do? You take off your ic <br>

that the airplane would pick up speed and take off normally with just dou <br>

nice one. But still wrong, assuming the conditions laid down in the original

CptSpeaking: Reminds me of something else...can this guy generate any forward 
airspeed and if he had wings, take off? Your CptSpeaking <br>

433 
BoeingOnFinal: No, because he gains speed by moving on the ground. And if an 
aircraft gained speed to take off by turning the wheel like a car, it wouldn't 
take off <br>

times in this thread. The animal propels the the wheel by applying a rearward

436 David L: 
&quot;Running on a treadmill&quot; is not the same thing! The wheels do not 
propel the aircraft! <br>

437 MidEx216: I was gonna say no at first, but 
Nighthawk is right. Though the conveyor belt is moving in the opposite 
direction, that's not going to slow the plane <br>
<br>
438 CptSpeaking: I 
understand the difference in propulsion...my point in that is, if your speed 
over the ground (not the belt or in my example, wheel) remains at ZERO <br>

439Jetlagged: Another false assumption: that the aircraft will not move forward 
relative to the ground because the belt is running backwards. In fact the 
conveyor <br>

440 Mir: If one were to disregard friction between the 
wheels and the axles, the airplane wouldn't move at all - the wheels would just 
spin. Since there is fr <br>

allowing the pilot to add just enough thrust to counter the increased rolling 
friction. If the pilot sets takeoff thrust, roll <br>

ground speed. Whatever the conveyor belt does the aircraft accelerates. I <br>

American Junior Classics Hornet balsa plane and place it on the belt, keeping

449 MD-90: There is a paradox, mainly because I think 
whoever worded the initial question was thinking in terms of the wheels 
propelling the aircraft like a car <br>
<br>
450 CptSpeaking: This would be 
correct if you were talking relative lateral velocities. The wheels and the 
belt underneath would be moving laterally at the same veloc <br>

451 Keta: 
Well said, I agree. There's simply no way that the belt will stop the aircraft. 
No matter how fast it moves, it exerts no force (or a very little one <br>

452 Starlionblue: Second that. How about in the ass? Centerline 
thrust is better. That's a bit like what aircraft carriers do. You gain a good 
20-30 knots depending on <br>

453 Chksix: Cancelling wheel speed means to 
me that the belt moves forward when the wheel tries to roll when thrust is 
applied. That means wheel rpm will be zero, <br>

454 Bond007: Well, I 
think it worded that way exactly to get the hundreds of anwers that this thread 
has got. Yes, that it the answer. Not sure ... see above ... <br>

455 
Starlionblue: Can we enter a feature request for a little whiteboard in the 
posting window? <br>
<br>
456 Sovietjet: Exactly. There's two interpretations 
and therefore two answers. They aren't wrong, as I said they came up with two 
answers based on two interpretatio <br>

457 Bond007: Not sure that affects 
the outcome though .. since regardless of what the belt does (or can do), all 
rules of physics say that the aircraft WILL move <br>

<br> 459 Starlionblue: I thought you gave up on this one. How is the 
truncheoning going? <br>

the wheels, insignificant it may seem, becomes a great force once it is 
multiplied by infinity. As the hypothet <br>

point. Realistically, yes this has nothing to do with a car on a dyno, yeah 
yeah, wheels are irrelevant i think someon <br>

about 40-50 days. <br>

the aircraft would fly in the classic sc <br>

understand it the other way, that the belt tries to stop the wheels relative to 
the surrounding, not just stop rotating. <br>

I borrowed this... from something you said earlier... like, about a year ago. I

some people are saying. Are you saying that the aircraft can't accelerate to

irregardless of the initial wheel/conveyor belt speed: it is impossible for the

No, I don't &quot;finally understand&quot;. I've been differentiating between 
the &quot;classic&quot; version, other feasible interpretations and the version

thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1.0 would be able to accomplish the full

617 HAWK21M: You are forgetting 
about relative Airflow over the Control surfaces. regds MEL <br>
<br>
618 
Vatveng: Did you stop reading at this line? There's going to be plenty of 
airflow over the control surfaces once the plane starts skidding on the bloody 
stump <br>

619 David L: But a thrust to weight ratio of &quot;just 
over&quot;1 would only allow it to crawl up to the vertical. Once it got past 
the vertical, the thrust would no long <br>

I have to assume we're talking about the same aircraft as we were in Options 1, 
2 and 3 (assuming it actually had wheels) <br>

636 Oly720man: 
Misinterpretation from me then. I didn't think the plane would be carried 
sideways by the belt, in which case, there would be a crosswind. <br>

David L: Phew! The last thing I need is a wind tunnel manager telling me I'm 
talking rubbish about... wind. There'd be no way out of that hole for me. <br>

or more runways turn on a turntable to face the wind.. Then that problem will 
be solve <br>

ideas! Nevermind.. I guess they could just close the airport. <br>
<br>
641 
David L: Yes, that's one solution. Another would be to avoid having conveyor 
belt runways that move sideways at the same rate as the aircraft's moving 
forward <br>
<br>
642 Starlionblue: For those who can't see the picture, it's 
an aircraft carrier. <br>
<br>
643 NZ107: Boy would I love to see an A380 being 
catapulted off it! (crunch, can't support the force from the catapult) Imagine 
a 3km long aircraft carrier made <br>

644 Iwok: this scenario is one of 
the more realistic options (aside from the aircraft carrier ). In this case the 
plane would take off. Right: but the 0 ground <br>

645 David L: But they 
wouldn't be dragging in the fore and aft direction, i.e. in the direction the 
aircraft's trying to go so the thrust wouldn't be competing wi <br>

Right. That means the plane on the belt cannot move, except for the wheels. The

different scenarios. Perhaps we should split the &quot;real&quot; scenarios 
from the &quot;magic&quot; scenarios thus: <br>

case every real scenario should have the plane taking off. And by aircrafts 
speed do you mean wheel speed? Even if the conveyor was coupled in <br>

discussed in this thread doesn't all relate to one big scenario. There are 
several different sc <br>

<br>
846 Bok269: Correct. Aircraft generate 
lift from airspeed, not groundspeed. Therefore, unless the aircraft is moving 
forward relative to the earth, you won't tak <br>

Aircraft does NOT have to be moving relative to the Earth it only has to be 
moving relative to the air. Yesterday, quite windy at a local <br>

KcrwFlyer: This thread is still alive? How can a plane takeoff if its not 
moving forward...? <br>
<br>
853 Starlionblue: It is moving forward. The 
conveyor belt does not affect the plane's ability to do this. <br>
<br>
854 
Bok269: Right, but wouldn't moving forward make having a conveyor belt useless 
in the first place? <br>
<br>
855 KcrwFlyer: Are you talking about the conveyor 
belt actually moving the direction the plane is moving? Thus causing it to 
accelerate and not remain stationary? I <br>

856 Starlionblue: The 
conveyor belt was never &quot;useful&quot;. If we assumes brakes are off and 
the wheels are on the conveyor belt, the conveyor belt will impart little moti

857 David L: We're talking about all of these, and more... <br>

something set up to try <br>

it would just die! After years on here, It's by far the most stupid and 
ridiculous thread I've ever seen. However, I guess <br>

861 Boston92: The 
episode is on Wednesday, and the plane takes off. <br>

862 KBFIspotter: I 
am begining to wonder if the Mythbusters used a conveyor belt as a catapult to 
launch the aircraft into the air... Think about it, that one would wo <br>

far more stupid to me. I think after 860 posts, we all need to accept that it's

864 Starlionblue: If you set the brakes, sure. But I doubt that 
the Mythbusters have the sort of budget that would require. I think you're 
missing the point. <br>

865 Jetblueguy22: Mythbuster busted it so that 
good enough for me! Blue P.S. I didn't think they allowed 865 posts? <br>

can-o-worms, but you might want to check out the theories that have been develop

867 PWM2TXLHopper: I was posting here because I saw the commercial 
and didn't realize somebody else had posted the same info moments before. And I 
have read the thread, <br>

Here are the four laws again: <br>

faster than they were designed to do, not the mi <br>

872 Starlionblue: Guilty! <br>
<br>
873 David L: One of the main reasons, I 
said. In addition to the reason you gave, there's also the fact that entirely 
different interpretations were being discuss <br>

874 Tdscanuck: 
Ordinarily, no. But this particular thread is now such an academic curiosity 
that, for the sake of science and posterity, it must be allowed to conti <br>

the airplane flies, there will still be the idiots who don't get it, and say 
they screwed u <br>

scientific backing. It pretty <br>

the original mystery was if the belt matches the speed of the plane and not the 
speed of the wheels. The one thing that just needs to b <br>

878 Sovietjet
: I still believe this is the most plausible answer. Takes off with wheels 
spinning at infinity. <br>

879 DaBuzzard: Slight problem with that. E = 
mc^2 Little manipulation gives us m=e/c^2 As the wheel rotates faster, it has 
more energy (e gets larger). As the rotat <br>

880 Tdscanuck: I think that 
was covered by outcome 3: Tom. <br>
<br>
881 Starlionblue: Well put. <br>

882 Iwok: I think the actual OP was a highly complex question, and the poster 
knew how difficulty the instantaneous issue would add. We still need to add: 
fric <br>

883 ShyFlyer: If a plane took off a conveyor belt...in the 
forest...and no one was around to see it...does it have to comply with the 
noise abatement procedure? <br>
<br>
884 Starlionblue: For the record, I'd just 
like to note that the 4 Laws of Airplane Conveyors (TM) are David L's, not 
mine. I simply parrot him. <br>
<br>
885 Airfoilsguy: Have you not read EVERY 
single post in this thread? That was my theory 4 months ago. <br>
<br>
886 
David L: Yes, that's Option 1, the classic version. I didn't really get 
involved with Option 3 but I thought the conclusion was that it couldn't move,

Mind you, I don't think it even makes it to rotation. I'm thinking the black

889 Airfoilsguy: There is an interesting 
aspect, what if we take wheels out of the equation and replace them with skis 
on an iced conveyor? <br>

covered way back in the thread somewhere. <br>

four hours to go here on the East Coast until the big moment. A word of advice 
to a.netters living on the West Coast, if you don't want the <br>

Sovietjet: What if there were snakes on the plane? <br>
<br>
893 Boston92: Or 
get Directv, like me! <br>

conveyor belt starts moving, the snakes will devour the thousands of pigeons 
inside the plane, which (as we all know) m <br>

895 Miller22: Now that it 
took the Mythbusters to teach us basic aerodynamics, can we please let this one 
die? <br>
<br>
896 A346Dude: I don't get Discovery Channel... I assume it took 
off? <br>
<br>
897 GrandTheftAero: They did it on Mythbusters Jan 30. Conveyor 
Belt + Plane = Plane took off. Everyone who knows how to draw a free-body 
diagram dies a little everytime <br>

did the &quot;classic&quot; scenario where the belt matches the aircraft ground 
speed. There is no way to test the original problem of the b <br>

useful here if anyone wants to debate it <br>

basis for Option 3, the one that requires magic forces... and stuff? <br>

they made for the test - doesn't get much more straight forward then that.

will take off regardless of belt speed. Period. <br>

will(this was before Mythbusters) but with the tires spinning at inf <br>

910 KELPkid: Congratulations on your 10 minutes of fame on TV (even if they 
didn't mention you at all-were it not for you, none of this ever would have 
happened) <br>

on tons of forums across the internet, most of them not even aviation related.

913 Sovietjet: Yes I've 
seen this topic on many places online. Now here's the next question.... A 
helicopter on a giant turntable...does it take off? <br>

914 MQTmxguy: Of 
course, the helicopter will still be ugly, thus the Earth will still repel it. 
But if your loking for a real answer, it's still yes. If turing in <br>

916 MQTmxguy: phffft, I'm using a UH-60, duh <br>

918 Starlionblue: And that should be the end of the discussion. 
But somehow I doubt that it will be. <br>

experiment commonly cited in discussions of this question is to ima <br>

I watched the Mythbusters episode: - The result was no surprise. - The tests, 
animations and &quot;science content&quot; were very good. Adam's demonstration

923 David L: I haven't seen it yet but perhaps it's just something 
he's never thought about before and he had to rush to a conclusion? <br>

924 Starlionblue: You are so kind. But yes that may be so. . <br>
<br>
925 
HAWK21M: Any link? regds MEL <br>

says 160 mph max speed does not mean it won't spin any faster, it's not like 
there are brakes inside the tire that apply wh <br>

Well, I'm reminded of the mess I made in an earlier thread about birds flying 
inside an aircraft - not the one from a couple of years ago but one sho <br>

military helicopters. Normal helicopters don't fly either...they just beat the

Starlionblue: I watched a recording like. But if you're willing to go shady the 
entire episode is most likely available on torrent sites. <br>

helicopter pilots will tell you the rotor remains stationary and the world

Anyone think of doing a part 2, 3, or 4? Just wanted to be post 945 Blue <br>
