<p>&laquo; Exploring the Megalithic Mind in Malta</p> 
<p>BJM in Europe &raquo;</p> 
<h1>Travelling without planes</h1> 
<p>So, having signed up for the exciting Metageum conference in Malta this 
November, the question of travel arises. More specifically, how does this sit 
with my &ldquo;no air travel unless essential&rdquo; plan?</p> 
<p>First off, why no air travel? Carbon emissions, of course. Jim Bliss, my 
ex-engineer friend whose head for maths makes me dizzy, on moving to Dublin 
last year, sat down to work outhow much worse it would be if he flew to London 
rather than taking a coach. Turns out it&rsquo;s about 31 times worse.</p> 
<p>Merrick just did some more DIY carbon calculations, and worked out that 
&ndash; using aviation-friendly estimates &ndash; &ldquo;every minute 
you&rsquo;re on a plane is the same as a day&rsquo;s worth of your 
electricity&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>If we can make our way briskly past the noxious climate change denial 
industry (and associated amateurs), accepting that this stuff is actually 
happening and that our actions have consequences, we usually come to the 
arguments for &ldquo;tech fixes&rdquo;. In many arenas, this is a fair argument 
&ndash; at least, it&rsquo;s worth engaging with, even if you disagree with it.
</p> 
<p>Not so, unfortunately, with air travel:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip; every other source of global warming can be reduced or replaced 
[...] without a serious reduction in our freedoms. But there is no means of 
sustaining long-distance, high-speed travel.</p> 
<p>The industry claims it can reduce its emissions by means of new 
technological developments. But as the Royal Commission on Environmental 
Pollution points out, its targets &ldquo;are clearly aspirations rather than 
projections&rdquo;. There are some basic technological constraints which make 
major improvements impossible to envisage.</p> 
<p>George Monbiot</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The singular nature of air travel in this respect means that we just have 
to travel less by air. Personal sacrifices in a matter like this, some may 
argue, are as nothing without widespread limits enforced for all. There&rsquo;s 
a truth in that. Yet my general experience is that this argument is usually 
trotted out by people who (1) would be the last to support widespread enforced 
limitations, and (2) use it as a rationalization for totally disregarding 
personal morality.</p> 
<p>The people I know who dedicate a great portion of their waking lives to 
campaigning for such limits also apply this sense of collective morality to 
their own actions. I think this is known as &ldquo;integrity&rdquo;. (Of 
course, no one&rsquo;s perfect, andhypocrisy is the result of high ideals as 
well as a lack of integrity.)</p> 
<p>What about offsetting? Surely if there&rsquo;s no other way we can buy our 
way out of this one? Well, due toseveral important practical considerations, 
the short answer to that is, &ldquo;No &ndash; deal with it&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>My trip to Malta may inevitably end up entailing air flight, if for no 
other reason than no ferry services seem to operate in November (I&rsquo;m a 
good swimmer, but not exceptional). But it may be possible to include a 
pleasant jaunt through Italy as part of train travel most of the way, and 
discovering the best way to do this is made all the easier by this brilliant 
website:</p> 
<p><b>The Man in Seat Sixty-One</b></p> 
<p>The hobby site of &ldquo;career railwayman&rdquo; Mark Smith, it details 
concise and helpful information for anyone who &ndash; for whatever reason 
&ndash; wants to travel without flying. It&rsquo;s geared towards British 
travellers, but does include information on travel within other countries that 
people originating elsewhere may find crucial. Most travel agents and other 
sources of information are insanely biased towards air travel, so sites like 
this are hugely valuable.</p> 
<p>Mark is clearly someone who would be doing this with or without an 
impending climate crisis: &ldquo;Many people would rather not fly, or like me, 
simply prefer a more civilised, comfortable, interesting, adventurous, 
romantic, scenic, historic, exciting and environmentally-friendly way to 
travel.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yet again, the philosophy of reduction, of intelligently scaling back some 
of the excesses of capitalist industrialism, is often more than it appears when 
forced through the growth- and speed-fixated filters of consumer economics. 
Frequently painted as a pass&eacute; form of hippy &ldquo;hair-shirt&rdquo; 
self-mortification, reduction is often the path of choice for the true 
sensualist.</p> 
<p>The fact that this philosophy&rsquo;s most famed branch, the Slow Food 
movement, itself began in Italy as a reaction to fast food makes me even more 
inspired to take my time getting to Malta. See if I can find the perfect Pizza 
Napoletana&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>Why not just admit to yourself that you want your cake and want to eat it? 
Obviously you value a megalith conference in Malta more highly than your views 
on climate change. Honestly, I feel like punching people who beat themselves up 
over this, just to save them the trouble. Be a planetary bastard and proud of 
it!</p>

<li> 
<p>Ah, for a mind cast in black-and-white!</p> 
<p>Really, your punch would be a waste of energy cos I&rsquo;m losing no sleep 
over this. And generally that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve spent a little time 
while awake to think the shit through and find a good balance between moral 
ideals and day-to-day life. Rocket science it ain&rsquo;t (though it helps when 
you&rsquo;ve got trusted friends bothered to do the CO2 maths).</p> 
<p>Anyway, I thought you&rsquo;d be the train-across-the-continent, catch some 
good Italian cuisine along the way kind of guy. You never struck me as the 
get-there-quick-or-else type. I guess you might go by plane, though, just to 
annoy anyone who thinks that personal responsibility counts for 
anything&hellip; More wasted energy, though (in more ways than one).</p> 
<p><b>Gyrus</b> - 30th May 2007 @ 0:56 </p> </li>

<p>I never said I was averse to the train. I wasn&rsquo;t expressing a 
preference for the plane. I wasn&rsquo;t even talking about personal 
responsibility. I was talking about being true to what you believe and not 
fudging the issue to serve another master, since it&rsquo;s only yourself 
you&rsquo;re fooling, no-one else. Is this so hard to understand? If you want 
to go to Malta to look at rocks because the rocks down the road aren&rsquo;t 
good enough for you, just go and forget paying lip-service to 
&ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;, because if you really cared one way or the other 
about the damage your journey would cause you simply wouldn&rsquo;t go. I 
don&rsquo;t give a damn what people do, but I don&rsquo;t like to see 
intelligent people lying to themselves. I&rsquo;d much prefer if the global 
warming issue was dropped as the trivial distraction it is, and instead some 
serious thought was given to the collision course our planet is inevitably on.
</p> 
<p><b>Joel</b> - 30th May 2007 @ 5:20 </p> </li>

<p>I (polemically) assumed you were averse to the train ride because I 
couldn&rsquo;t otherwise see why you saw my decision to take it as 
&ldquo;beating myself up&rdquo;! You seemed to miss the whole point of the 
post: the climate change position (whether you agree with it or not) and the 
pleasure-seeking position coincide.</p> 
<p>As for your understanding of why I&rsquo;m making this decision&hellip; 
well, it&rsquo;s your understanding is the best place to leave it I guess.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m with you on the serious thought about planetary collapse (as you 
know). But in the end I can&rsquo;t help but recognize that only fools think 
they know for certain what the future holds &ndash; which to me means acting 
now in a way you think will contribute to a better future, even though that 
future (like the planetary collapse one) isn&rsquo;t certain. Is that so hard 
to understand?</p> 
<p>I also don&rsquo;t think things like this are clear, mutually exclusive 
choices between distinct &ldquo;issues&rdquo;, some of which are a distraction 
next to &ldquo;the important one&rdquo;. They&rsquo;re all hopelessly 
intertwined. Every which way you look, increasing aviation is a bad idea, 
though. And I don&rsquo;t see the choice as being either to hole up and be a 
self-mortifying puritan or to buy the Daily Mail and say, &ldquo;Fuck it!&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Anyway, talking of wasting energy&hellip;</p> 
<p><b>Gyrus</b> - 30th May 2007 @ 11:54 </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Well, as you say, it&rsquo;s all &ldquo;hopelessly intertwined&rdquo;, 
hopelessly being the operative word. It may be foolish to think you know the 
future, good point there, even for one who has invested his time reading 
oracles, but it is even more foolish to think that we ants are affecting 
anything at all. It is all a glorious projection of meaning.</p> 
<p>But that&rsquo;s what we do. Real ants move bits of dead leaf from A to B 
and keep the aphids down. We ants move a few thoughts from one place to another 
and imagine we are masters of the Earth&rsquo;s fate. Whether with our 
deforestation or our late-on recycling, it is only part of this illusion to 
imagine we have any impact whatsoever. The best we could do after all these 
millennia of evolution is probably to jettison little vials of our DNA out into 
deep space, out of danger of the Earth being no more. Like the gigantic 
fruiting body we are, we should ripen and disperse into space and the 
singularity that awaits us. We are spores of something greater, never have been 
anything else.</p> 
<p>I am generally in favour of the idea that it should amount to something, 
this experiment or accident. As for the rest, it&rsquo;s not noble it&rsquo;s 
mostly just posturing.</p> 
<p><b>Joel</b> - 30th May 2007 @ 13:53 </p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m just an dyed-in-the-wool multi-perspective type. I know it looks 
like hard work to anyone who prefers to find a perspective and stick to it, but 
it&rsquo;s like breathing for me. My hard work is usually fighting the idea 
that I need to find a perspective and stick to it&hellip;</p> 
<p>That is to say, I totally appreciate the wide-angle view you&rsquo;ve 
described so well. It&rsquo;s great that people like John Gray are reminding 
our progress-obsessed Christian-hangover tech culture that in the end we are 
&ldquo;as straw dogs&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve little truck with people who take 
action against climate change as some straw to hang on to to save their 
illusions about our supposed mastery over nature.</p> 
<p>As ever, all we&rsquo;re doing is trying to adapt. I just don&rsquo;t go 
for the idea that the fact that we lose in the end means we shouldn&rsquo;t try 
hard to adapt and thrive (qualitatively, not necessarily quantitatively). We 
all die in the end, but it&rsquo;s no argument for topping yourself (at least, 
not on a good day ;-).</p> 
<p>Bringing all our options to the table, seeing that it&rsquo;s all futile 
and acting well anyway, the perception of futility as the<em>ground</em> for 
acting well &ndash; that&rsquo;s my position. On a good day.</p> 
<p><b>Gyrus</b> - 30th May 2007 @ 14:33 </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Yes, we each do our bit, every ant has its purpose. Perhaps the ant we 
crush in the bathroom, afraid it is the advance scout of a future infestation, 
had the job of making us feel guilty so we would reappraise our attitudes 
towards insect life. I don&rsquo;t think any butterfly I thoughtlessly gassed 
as a child died in vain, all three of them before I decided it was cruel hobby.
</p> 
<p>I think the knack is knowing what our real job is in the scheme of things. 
To me, endless worrying over the tiny ripples we make in moving through the 
world is truly futile. Do it or don&rsquo;t do it, but don&rsquo;t get 
embroiled in these side-issues. A certain smugness in putting all one&rsquo;s 
wine bottles in the recycling bin holds off for another day real thought about 
who we are and why we are here.</p> 
<p>Probably humanity&rsquo;s greatest achievement was getting off the ground 
and into the air, and from there to space. That&rsquo;s where our destiny lies, 
in space. If we destroy the planet to send our DNA out into the universe then I 
expect we will have done our job. We have nature to thank for the template. 
It&rsquo;s only like a plant withers and dies once it has spread its seeds. We 
should just shut up and let it happen, before we no longer have the resources 
to escape the Earth or before a huge meteorite hits us. That is the only 
seriousness about this adventure. We are already fossils in rocks. What&rsquo;s 
important is the new seed. I for one have found it a joyful thing each evening 
for the past few weeks to see the International Space Station burning brightly 
as the sun sets. Have you been watching it? This is what we are about.</p> 
<p><b>Joel</b> - 30th May 2007 @ 16:06 </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to agree to differ on the &ldquo;endless worrying&rdquo; 
bit. I give some consideration to these things and act accordingly. It&rsquo;s 
not zero effort, but it&rsquo;s quite distinct from being in a perpetual tizz 
(at least it should be). Again, I don&rsquo;t see it as an either/or choice 
between smug environmentalism and stepping back to see the wider picture. For 
me, doing the latter prevents the smug part of the former.</p> 
<p>I agree about about space (though obviously not enough to have been keeping 
up on the ISS &ndash; must look out for it!). My darker wide-view is that 
fossil fuels were life&rsquo;s ticket to go there &ndash; and we&rsquo;ve 
pretty much blown it. We&rsquo;ve traded a Martian stepping stone to the stars 
for suburbs, endless toing-and-froing, and an oil-guzzling military system with 
which to kill each other over the last scraps of the oil we&rsquo;ve wasted.</p>
<p>Ants&hellip; We do seem more like a social insect (or virus) than monkeys. 
A great book I just read quotes Lewis Thomas as saying ants are &ldquo;so much 
like human beings as to be an embarrassment. They farm fungi, raise aphids as 
livestock, launch armies for wars, use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse 
their enemies, capture slaves. &hellip; They do everything but watch 
television.&rdquo; Andtheir intelligent selflessness sometimes puts most of us 
to shame! Maybe we should ditch TV?</p>
