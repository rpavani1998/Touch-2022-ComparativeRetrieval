<h2>Roadster Efficiency and Range</h2> door JB Straubel,  CTO TAGS: Engineering
 /Elektrisch / Roadster / <br>
605 OPMERKINGEN <br>

<p>With more than 100 Roadsters delivered to customers so far and more on the 
road each week, it&rsquo;s natural for some customers to run 
&ldquo;experiments&rdquo; on them. Because we have such an entrepreneurial and 
highly technical customer base, many of these experiments are quite detailed 
and attempt to answer questions that we have in some cases never discussed 
publicly.</p> <br>

<p>One of the most common and tricky experiments is testing how far the 
Roadster will go on a single charge in various driving conditions. For thelatest
 powertrain configuration (powertrain 1.5), we have demonstrated dynamometer 
test results of 244 miles range in a complicated combination of highway and 
city drive cycles defined by the EPA.</p> 
<p>However, this is just one data point; real-world range can vary 
substantially depending on driving style, environmental conditions, and usage 
of accessories such as the electric cabin air conditioning system and the 
electric cabin heating system. The cycles defined by the EPA attempt to make a 
representative average of these different factors and combine it into one 
number. Many customers, potential customers and curious observers want the 
details behind this average and how results may change depending on conditions.
</p> 
<p>We need a designed set of experiments to understand how efficiently or how 
far a Roadster could drive under different conditions. This can quickly become 
a huge amount of testing as there are so many variables and conditions, but 
fortunately we have spent quite a bit of time internally building a very 
accurate computer model of how the Roadster will behave under different driving 
scenarios. We&rsquo;ve validated the model by testing at a reduced number of 
points -- enough to give us good confidence in the results. The details of this 
model are quite interesting and could be a whole separate blog, but for now 
let&rsquo;s just use it as a tool to help us understand Roadster efficiency and 
range.</p> 
<p>The simplest experiment to consider, and one that gives great insight into 
the whole vehicle performance, is how efficiency and range vary as a function 
of driving speed. This is assuming that speed is held constant (i.e. cruise 
control) at each point. For any test or model run, there are many inputs that 
need to be specifically stated to make the results meaningful. So here are some 
of the critical inputs that we have assumed:<br>
 &bull; Single driver ~180lbs
<br> &bull; Soft top or Hard top on vehicle (with windows up)<br>
 &bull; No 
air conditioning usage<br>
 &bull; No heat usage<br>
 &bull; No headlights or 
cabin air blower (large 12V loads)<br>
 &bull; Tires inflated to recommended 
efficiency setting 30/40 front/rear psi</p> 
<p>The outputs of this model run are in battery energy usage per mile. In the 
case of an EV this is typically expressed in terms of Wh/mile. A 100W light 
blub running for 1 hour will use 100 Wh of electricity. Since 1 Watt is also 
just 1 Joule/second you can easily convert Wh into Joules by multiplying by (60 
[seconds])*(60 [minutes]). It is also important to note that we are discussing 
DC Wh/mile or energy coming OUT of the battery pack inside the vehicle. This is 
very relevant to range but does not consider the losses associated with the 
onboard battery charger or some of the slight round-trip energy losses in the 
battery itself.</p> 
<p>Here is the DC Wh/mile predicted result for a Tesla Roadster with the above 
assumptions over the entire operating speed range.</p> <br>

<p>The shape of this curve might not be immediately intuitive, but it makes 
sense once you consider the different types of drag and energy loss at work. 
(We will look at those soon.) Remember that this is not a power curve but 
instead a plot of energy per mile. You can directly determine power from this 
data by multiplying the Wh/mile by the mph at a given data point. The expected 
DC power required to drive the Roadster at a steady speed is shown below.</p> 
<br> 
<p>This probably looks more intuitive since it is always increasing as speed 
increases. The shape of this curve is obviously not linear. To cruise at 60 mph 
takes about 15kW. However, if you double that to 30kW you will only accelerate 
to about 80mph -- far less than twice as fast. And if you double it again to 
60kW you will accelerate to about 107 mph using 4 times as much power as you 
did at 60mph, yet you&rsquo;d only travel about 1.8 times as fast.</p> 
<p>Energy Loss Distribution:</p> 
<p>To understand why these curves have the shapes that they do it is helpful 
to examine where the energy actually goes. For simplicity we will group the 
energy usage into four &ldquo;buckets&rdquo;:</p> 
<p>1. Aerodynamic Losses (drag from the air over the body of the car and 
through the front radiator)<br>
 2. Tire Losses (aerodynamic and rolling drag 
from the tires)<br>
 3. Drivetrain Losses (Inverter, motor, gearbox, bearings)
<br> 4. Ancillary Losses (12V loads, cooling fans and pumps, lights, etc.)</p> 
<br> 
<p>Each of these loss components has very different characteristics and is 
affected in different ways by making real world changes to the vehicle.</p> 
<p>1. Aerodynamic losses are almost entirely determined by driving speed. The 
other issue to keep in mind is that these losses are determined by relative 
wind speed over the vehicle -- not necessarily the speed over the ground. So if 
you are driving into a 10 mph headwind, it is nearly the same as driving 10 mph 
faster from an aerodynamic loss point of view. As you can see from the graph, 
this can have a huge impact on overall Wh/mile with even very small changes in 
wind. It is also important to note that, because the loss is not linear with 
air speed over the car, you cannot &ldquo;zero out&rdquo; the effect of wind by 
driving in a closed loop course the way you can with elevation changes. Driving 
into the wind for 1 mile and then turning around to drive downwind for the same 
1 mile (all at the same speed) will use more energy than driving the same speed 
with no wind over 2 miles. Even a direct crosswind will slightly increase 
forward moving aerodynamic losses due to its interaction with the body shape.
</p> 
<p>2. Tire losses are mainly determined by the weight of the vehicle and the 
rolling drag of the tires themselves. For the Roadster we have chosen tires 
that offer a great combination of low rolling resistance and traction or grip. 
The air pressure in the tires has a large effect on this rolling resistance, 
grip and the overall tire loss. Higher pressure gives lower rolling resistance 
but a harsher ride and degraded handling. The above modeling is done at 30/40 
psi front/rear. You can expect about a +/- 10Wh/mile variation with a +/- 20% 
variation in tire pressure. Similarly, by reducing vehicle mass you see a 
proportional reduction in rolling loss. So if you reduce total mass by 1% then 
you would reduce rolling loss by about 1%. In the configuration above, 1% 
equals about 30 lbs. So it is good to make sure that you are not 
&ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; carrying extra weight in the trunk or elsewhere if 
you are trying to get the best range possible.</p> 
<p>3. Drivetrain losses include those that the user doesn&rsquo;t typically 
control: the efficiency of the motor controller, the motor itself, the gearbox 
and generally all losses in converting the DC electricity from the battery pack 
into useful torque at the wheels of the car. This is proportional to speed due 
to spinning losses in the gearbox and motor and also proportional to power 
output due to conversion losses in the various subsystems.</p> 
<p>4. Ancillary losses are caused by all &ldquo;other&rdquo; electrical loads 
in the vehicle, particularly the 12V cooling blowers and pumps, the 12V radio, 
internal and external lighting, etc. For the modeling above, we assumed that 
there was not heating or air conditioning load, but if there were it would show 
up here. These losses are somewhat different than the others because they 
represent a roughly constant power draw on the vehicle regardless of speed, 
winds or elevation changes. Because of this, they cause the energy usage per 
mile to start becoming high again at very low speeds. This effect would be even 
more pronounced if the heater or A/C system were operating. Likewise, the 
impact of ancillary losses is extremely small at high speeds because the 
primary propulsion power is very high and these small power draws make a 
relatively tiny contribution.</p> 
<p>Range:</p> 
<p>Now that we have a better understanding of how much energy the Roadster 
uses per mile, the next question is how far can it go? The typical full 
capacity of a new battery pack when charged to 100% in maximum range mode and 
discharged steadily over 3 hours is about 55kWh. Using that number you can 
calculate an interesting driving range curve for various speeds.</p> <br>

<p>While this graph shows that driving range greater than 300 miles should be 
possible, the conditions to do this are quite rare: steady-state driving at 30 
mph (no stops or starts) for more than 10 hours! What is most relevant for real 
world driving and trip planning is how the range varies between perhaps 45 mph 
and 80 mph.</p> 
<p>One clear driving &ldquo;tip&rdquo; to take away from this is if you are 
ever nervous about making it to a given destination: you will do much better to 
slow down instead of speeding up. I&rsquo;ve talked with many people who 
intuitively think that minimizing time to the destination will also minimize 
the energy usage, but just the opposite it true!</p> 
<p>As you have probably seen from the discussion in this blog, many factors 
and assumptions affect range. The real world has wind, variations in road 
surface, hills, occasional stops and starts and other conditions. Given the 
complexity involved, I would be happy if a real-world test fell within about 
10% of the modeled result for energy usage and range.</p> 
<p>If you would like to &ldquo;play&rdquo; with these numbers yourself, below 
is a link to an Excel file with the table of data used to generate these graphs.
</p> 
<p>To our customers, happy driving. And we are always interested to hear back 
from you about other experiences with your Roadsters!</p>

<p>Great data!<br>
 Can you provide some consumption data for the headlights, 
radio, seat heaters, cabin heater, air conditioner, etc.? I understand that the 
heating/cooling components will have a variable duty cycle, but it has often 
been stated that using the seat heaters is &quot;far&quot; more efficient than 
heating the cabin. It would be interesting to analyze that. and the overall 
impact of accessories on range.</p>

<p>That is about what I expected, although range at top speed is slightly

<p>JB,</p> 
<p>Thanks so much for posting this information! We appreciate the time you 
must have taken to present this information so clearly. This helps us

on the rare occasions when range is an issue.</p>

<p>For the endurance racing fans...<br>
 I thought it would be interesting to 
see how long you could drive (in hours) at a given constant speed.</p> 
<p>This is just the range data divided by mph:<br>

<p>About Clarkson's 55 miles, I'm not defending him, but these graphs are from 
steady-speed data points. On the track, they accelerate hard (which of course 
uses more energy than gradually accelerating, and far more than steady-speed 
driving, even at 120 MPH.) They also brake very hard, likely hard enough that 
regen is maxed and they're using friction brakes, so energy is wasted there. 
(Though the above graphs wouldn't take regen into account at all if they're 
steady-speed.)</p> 
<p>So what would be interesting to see is a worst-case range figure achieved 
by flooring it to max speed, then braking as hard as possible to stop, and 
repeating until the battery is depleted (preferably on a wind-free day.)</p> 
<p>Any owners willing to give us this figure?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  2:51pm | dec 19, 2008 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Excellent blog! Excellent! This is something that should go to the FAQ on 
this site.</p> 
<p>I think worst case would be to drive full throttle to the 125mph and then 
brake as hard as you can until car stops and repeat. With that you should be 
using approx 185kW power all of time (engine max) which would render car 
battery empty in roughly 20 minutes. You don't get far in 20 minutes driving 
that style. IIRC Roadster got 12s time in 1/4 mile and end speed was somewhere 
near 120mph.</p> 
<p>Calculating from that you get 1 mile in 48 secs. So 20 minutes would be 25 
miles.</p> 
<p>You would probably also have overheated engine, broken brakes, and some 
gray hairs.</p>

<p>JB, thank you very much for this data. It goes a long way toward putting my 
mind at ease. My experiments were consistently getting 6-10% worse results than 
expected and I was beginning to think there might be a problem with my car. But 
perhaps my discrepancy can be explained by a combination of having the lights 
and stereo on, possible light winds, slightly under-inflated tires, and the 
turn-around in the middle of my test. Each of those factors individually are 
pretty small but it's possible they might add up. And I'm (barely) within your 
10% confidence level anyway.</p> 
<p>Now when can we have those nano-silicon batteries with 10x the energy 
density and stop worrying about these details :-)</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Nubo  3:40pm | dec 19, 2008 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Sean, I think your test regime is beyond the capabilities of the car. 
You'll reach thermal limits and the controller will reduce power. This 
apparently happened to Clarkson. And the worst part is I'm sure the engineers 
briefed them on the car's operating limits but they chose to ignore them and 
then play them off as failures. For example, &quot;boo hoo! charging from a 13A 
110V socket takes sooooo long!!&quot; Shame, Mr. Clarkson! But I agree, the 55 
mile range is understandable given a &quot;track day&quot;. As far as I know 
the car's top speed is not drag-limited. Meaning, it's capped electronically 
and therefore you can consume a lot more power per mile for max acceleration 
than you will with max speed.</p>

<p>This solves my service trips problem from Phoenix to LA! I simply have to

<p>I think this is 'pretty' crucial data in order to understand the tesla 
roadster, I assume you educate your costumers with such data on their purchase?
</p> 
<p>Anyway, 2 important factors that are excluded from this blog is Lit-Ion 
capacity degradation and how it avoids being deep-cycled Is the recommended 75% 
capacity to 5%? That's 70% of any given range on the chart. Also the thing that 
seems appealing is that after 5 years, better batteries have come out and you 
can actually upgrade your roadster, giving it more range. This kind of scaling 
is completely new in the automotive business :)</p> 
<p>Keep doing what you do best tesla! Shedding the image of EVs as toy cars. 
You singlehandedly re-started EVs development.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Robert (Jamie) Munro  6:13pm | dec 19, 2008 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Previous talk about making a hybrid roadster have suggested that it would 
need a motor almost the size of an original Elise, but I've been wondering 
about if it would be possible to make a hybrid Roadster using a small gas 
turbine from the aero industry.</p> 
<p>This generates 12.5 Kw and weighs 24Kg, which is not a huge amount of extra 
weight:<br>

http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Lucas-Aerospace-Generator-200V-400Hz-12-5kW-Gas-Tu...</p> 
<p>According to the figures above, it would keep the roadster going at 55mph 
if the battery was completely dead. I imagine the overall package would 
probably be no better than a conventional gasoline setup, but this is only 
intended for emergencies or especially long journeys. Ideally you wouldn't need 
to carry the generator on journeys when you didn't need it, but it would 
require some sort of exhaust and air intake modifications to wherever you fit 
it in the car.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  ThomasJ  7:27pm | dec 19, 2008 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I would expect that there will also be some variation from car to car. 
Although Tesla surely maintains tight tolerances in the manufacture of critical 
parts, even very slight changes in areas such as the magnetic gap inside the 
motor and mating of the gears will create some significant differences between 
two otherwise identical cars. The batteries will also vary slightly, although 
using so many you would think that they would average out. Even the tires will 
vary slightly from batch to batch. The numbers may also change a bit after each 
car goes through some number of break-in miles.</p> 
<p>Any predictions from Tesla on how big these accumulated differences might 
be? One percent? Ten percent?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Robert Johnston  8:08pm | dec 19, 2008 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Please note, Nubo, that Clarkson was in the UK. Therefore the wall plug he 
was using was 13A, 240V (50Hz). Oh, and the top speed is limited by the maximum 
RPM of the motor, but is electronically limited under that (Around 80-90% IIRC) 
to prevent issues of wear on the motor and drivetrain.</p>

<p>Transmission---not a change for the Roadster---but for the &quot;S&quot;. 
</p> 
<p>The transmission on the power/speed/usage curves seem to be telling that it 
can't get out of its own way at high speeds. The gear ratio is meant to blast 
the Roadster out of the gate to hit 60mph, without blowing the transmission 
up---(2 gear old tranny).</p> 
<p>One reason the old 2 speed blew up was the bone crushing force that was 
hitting all parts of the transmission from the electric motor while &quot;speed 
shifting&quot;.</p> 
<p>Hey---remember all the &quot;slop&quot; you have with a &quot;normal&quot; 
car's shifts---depress the clutch, drop rpms, clutch---throwout 
bearing--flywheel---shift the gear--let out the clutch--all this is 
&quot;easy&quot; on a transmission. Now, if you do it hard---popping the 
clutch, etc all the time, well your clutch will probably be the 1st to 
die---but the tranny isn't far behind.</p> 
<p>So for the model S---play with the gear ratio and talk to some tranny peeps 
who are experts with Overdrives. One other solution is to have a multi speed 
tranny but not allow shifting....crazy?....no you select the gear before you 
start and you are &quot;locked in&quot; untill you come to a stop and put it in 
park.</p> 
<p>Think of the new tranny as multi power vs multi speed. </p> 
<p>Power 1--High Power ... lower range for blasting down the road or getting 
out of a dangerous area.</p> 
<p>Power 2--Med Power ... everyday cruising at 55-80 mph give you good range 
and still high speed.</p> 
<p>Power 3--Extended Range...Sunday Driving---30-60 mph smooth terrain.</p> 
<p>And the most scary idea of all---an automatic tranny w/overdrive... CVT?</p>
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Lad  10:51pm | dec 20, 2008 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Engineering question: So...the idea is to use the car to run 20 minute 
sprints on a road course; Given that you need to modify the suspension, add 
racing tires, etc. How much of the battery would you be able to remove if you 
ran 2 minute laps and swapped out the battery between sessions? What would be 
the tech weight of the car with this reduced battery weight?</p> 
<p>I see that your tire pressures are 30/40 front to back; what is the front 
to back weight ratio and what would it be with the reduced battery load?</p> 
<p>I watched the TG presentation and was not impressed with the comments by 
the host. You car has proven what it set out to prove...simply that electric 
cars are viable for everyday usage.</p>

<p>Interesting point about a gas turbine hybrid. But I don't think that's the 
right answer for long trips. The right answer is medium-fast charging (say 1 
hour for 200 miles worth of charge). Think about the cost of the two 
approaches. The design work for making a hybrid is at least several million 
dollars. The design work for a medium-fast charger is essentially zero. The 
cost of producing the extra mechanical bits for a hybrid is several thousand 
dollars each. Which is about the same as the cost of one charging station with 
installation. So suppose you're going to have 2000 vehicles. In the hybrid case 
you have a (low-ball estimate) of $1000 per car for the design plus $2000 for 
the parts. That's $6 million. If the charging stations can be installed for 
$3000 each (parts and labor) then you can have 2000 of them for the same $6 
million. 2000 charging stations would easily cover the entire USA. And as the 
number of cars increases the tradeoff becomes even more favorable. After a 
while, you'll need more charging stations or ones that can support several cars 
at once. But that's still much cheaper than paying for the hybrids.</p>

<p>JB, can you say anything about the possible use of the newer 18650 cells 
that are coming onto the market - i.e. Panasonic's 2900mAh which are used in 
the Asus eePC or their previously announced 3600mAh cells?</p> 
<p>Have you modelled their use in the car? Do you know if they are able to 
support the charge and discharge rates or lifetimes needed in the Roadster? It 
would be fantastic if the 3600mAh cells could boost the car's EPA range to 
around 400 miles, but I'm sure it isn't a simple swap.</p>

<p>errr ...... driving like a Top Gear presenter clearly does put you near the 
55 miles range, as it happened! Real world driving its not, but the occasional 
'spurt' built in to a days driving would be more realistic. What we need is the 
engine management memorising all of its driving data and downloading it to a 
central server so as to determine a true set of mean values. Surely being 
stationary is only a drain when its dark and winter?</p>

<p>Robert Munro,</p> 
<p>you realise that generator you linked to is the generator (alternator) only?
<br> despite the listing, it is only 12.5kva, at PF 0.8, so only 10kw avail.<br>
 it doesnt include the prime mover.<br>
 the funnel at the front is for cooling 
air for the windings, since most APUs are in enclosed spaces.<br>
 gas turbines 
are only efficient when run for at least 10x their heat up time.<br>
 the 
amount of gas required for the 4 or 5 hrs this would require is enormous, and 
heavy.</p>

<p>I have not seen the specs for the high power plug what makes this charge in 
only 3.5 hours ? what kinda load would<br>
 this put on a power grid compared 
to a 240v 13 amp plug ? and how long is the charge time from a 13 amp plug ?<br>
 why is the high power charger not mentioned anywhere i can find in the specs 
or the faqs ?</p> 
<p>what about solar charging ? how long would charging from 12-18 volt panels 
take ? and at what amperage ?<br>
 would you have to wire up tons of series 
panels to use this realistic and not get weeks of chargetime ?<br>
 is there an 
input in the car for charging with lower voltages like 12 v ? (or would one 
have to dissect the batteries<br>
 to get to the modules directly ?) i guess a 
dc-dc charger for any voltage would be useful to match the load</p> 
<p>what if the dc-dc power / high voltage power in the battery burns out ? 
thats the most likely unit to fail, would that toast the whole battery pack or 
is it an easy swap to replace this ? also using 2 fuses pr cells seems like a 
waste of money and weight.<br>
 why not use one fuse pr tube of cells ? if a 
cell opens and fails you will lose a whole tube anyway and if the<br>
 cells 
burn up in the tube it will hardly have any safety issues i see. worst case it 
will cool down in minutes<br>
 no way a short can do serious damage unless a 
whole module is shorted out. 3-4 cells carry rather limited juice<br>
 that 
never could damage adjacent tubes/cell packs<br>
 shorts in the dc-dc 
powers/diodes is the only real issue i see with the battery system which would 
blow out the fuse<br>
 for a whole module, hopefully that can be replaced easy 
? also is there an easy replacement if a tube/cell goes ? im hoping<br>
 this 
is not a costly repair ? seems to me its simple to yank out a tube of cells and 
replace it rather than buy a costly new<br>
 battery pack ? how many cells 
would be lost if a cell opens ? to me a design plus would be easy to change 
dc-dc<br>
 powers and fuses for the module packs without having to dissect the 
whole pack.</p> 
<p>also what is the cost of the battery since it needs replacing every few 
years ?</p> 
<p>the graph shows clearly why the top gear presenter only gets 55 miles or so 
that seems to match pretty good<br>
 with the hard accelleration and max 
constant speed which will surely burn tons of juice.<br>
 what are the actual 
figures for more regular average driving ? (few people run 125 mph constant i 
guess)<br>
 any drivers that can share their average mileage ? also list if its 
city driving or freeway or other type as the patterns<br>
 will be very 
different</p>

<p>Thanks for the honesty of the information provided. It is rare to see a 
manufacturer who has the guts to deal in facts and to handle the head-on.</p> 
<p>Constructive criticism is great, but too many good ideas and products are 
shot down by critics who miss the point and focus on negatives.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the question which should be asked is what percentage of the 
population travels less than, say 120 miles a day? And that becomes your target 
market as those people will probably be very happy to use a vehicle with such 
low- cost per mile and a much lower environmental. (And they will probably be 
able to drive the 120 miles with headlights, air-con, roof down, wrong tire 
pressure and in rush hour).</p> 
<p>When I look at the Tesla, I see much more pros than cons. Keep up the great 
work and focus on the positives as that is the formula to success and 'Never, 
never ever give up' (Sir Winstoin Chuirchill)</p>

<p>Hi Guys,<br>
 I watched your Tesla roadster perform on the Top Gear show 
here in the UK. Performed well but reliability issues and loss of charge versus 
time to recharge were badly slated by Jermey Clarkson.<br>
 Just read today 
that Toshiba are setting up new plant to produce a new generation battery which 
seems to answer all the issues and drawbacks of your current set up.<br>
 Are 
you already getting to grips with this and when can you get a re run on Top 
Gear with it?</p> 
<p>FYI<br>
 This looks like a possible breakthrough in battery technology and 
likey to a have major impact in the next few years.</p>

<p>When electricity is cheap, clean and abundant, and when batteries /

one will care about efficiency. They will only care about styling and utility. 
I look forward to seeing the exotic vehicles that will appear after we've fully 
converted to renewable sources of energy.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Robert Johnston - thanks for the correction; I didn't sanity-check my own 
numbers. But it seems likely if Jeremy actually had a 120V service he would 
have used *that*. Obviously most Tesla owners will avail themselves of a more 
utilitarian charge rate. Top Gear's dishonesty lies in presenting a 16 hour 
charge as something you're simply stuck with. Unless there are other aspects of 
electrical service in the UK that preclude a homeowner from being able to 
provision a 240x70 or even a 240x40 connection? Of course, they had to make 
their point even more blatant by creating a the straw-man of charging the Tesla 
with a small windmill. I guess they edited out the part of the Clarity segment 
where they obtained Hydrogen via Hamster wheel-powered hydrolysis. ;)</p>

<p>I would have thought that the best way to enable long distance touring in 
the Roadster and Model S is to design a REEV (Range Extended Electric Vehicle) 
trailer. This would be a trailer with a small (Smat Car?) engine and fuel tank 
attached to a generator with a special trailer plug that talks directly to the 
PEM. If you used a flat 4 (Subaru?) motor you could even have extra luggage 
space on top.<br>
 You could hire this from Tesla when you wanted to go touring 
and place your roadster into a 4'th mode REEV. The ICE would then turn on at a 
pre-determined battery level and top-you-up as you drive giving almost a whole 
day of highway cruising.<br>
 Has Tesla Motors considered this?</p>

<p>Why hasn't anyone developed a generator using the rear end axal housing to 
contain the system? This could be a long (length) generating system that would 
use the movement of the wheels to generate electricity; feed to the main 
batteries, and if need be you could also generate electricity off the front 
wheels around the disc brake system. Presently these are concepts; but doable. 
Just braingas with some possibilities.</p>

<p>As Chief Technology Officer, maybe you could influence your Marketing Dept. 
to remove the misleading statement that the<br>
 Tesla Roadster &quot;Burns no 
Oil&quot;. Most of the electricity in the US is generated by coal, a major 
polluter. In California, 60% is generated by natural<br>
 gas, which 
contributes to atmospheric carbon dioxide at a higher rate than coal. Of the 
natural gas burned to make electricity, a substantial<br>
 portion is made from 
oil, which makes the statement no only misleading, but false. It is possible 
that, when the entire energy generation and manufacturing<br>
 chain is 
considered, the electric car consumes more oil than a conventional car in the 
same class, and pollutes more.</p> 
<p>I think it is important to prevent spreading myths among consumers that 
driving an electric car is somehow more righteous than driving a conventional
<br> car, simply because it doesn't have a tailpipe.</p>

<p>This topic of range, and people&rsquo;s reactions to it (in this and other 
forums), is really fascinating. We have a Maxima and a Quest van. My max has 
143K on it and i the past few years I have taken maybe 4 trips longer than 200 
miles in it. The van is newer - maybe 45K on it - and we have taken 4 or 5 
trips in it as well. So the question is &ldquo;would I be willing to rent a car 
for those 8 or 9 trips in order to have a ZEV for all other driving 
situations?&rdquo; The answer is absolutely, undoubtedly, resoundingly YES. 
That is such a small price to pay that it is hardly even a factor in my 
decision making process. As for range during aggressive driving, an EV performs 
exactly like a gas-powered car: if you rag on it, your mileage is worse. This 
has been the same since the invention of the ICE, but all of the sudden 
it&rsquo;s a big deal? An EV isn&rsquo;t for everyone. Complaining about these 
shortcomings is like complaining about the trunk space of a Lamborghini or the 
skid pad rating of a suburban.</p>

<p>hi there<br>
 i have not seen the TG program on the Tesla but i did see the 
one with the Ford GT that Clockson actually bought, i think that had a range of 
about 75 miles on the test track, surely 55 miles (73% of the Fords range) from 
the Tesla is outstanding and only helps to confirm its viability as a 
performance electric car.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Patrick Stowe  10:05am | dec 29, 2008

<p></p> 
<p>Top Gear BBC1 did an electric car special with the Tesla and and Honda FCX 
hydrogen car. The Tesla, despite having a 125mph top speed went round their 
test track faster than a Porsche 911 GT3 RS (996). The team did not like it 
however because as your own site states: 3.5 hours recharge time from flat. The 
Honda they did love as it is hydrogen and therefore fills in seconds at a pump. 
The weight of your car is mostly batteries. If you were to reduce your 
batteries by a factor of 10 or even 50 and using a hydrogen fuel cell to 
constantly recharge the batteries then not only would you have all the 
advantages of the Honda but your car would also be massively lighter and would 
be competing with the very fastest cars on planet earth. Just a thought.</p>

<p>Dave Fisher, Tesla Roadster does not burn oil. Generating electricity 
**might** burn oil, and manufacturing some parts might, but car itself doesn't. 
So it is not false to say that Roadster does not burn oil.</p> 
<p>Additionally even if we just plain start burning gasoline in power plants 
generated electricity would be cleaner than burning that same gasoline in cars. 
Even with using **only** coal to produce electricity and then drive EV with it 
would be cleaner than any gas engine car.</p> 
<p>Electricity can be produced completely without oil, and soon it will. 
Nuclear, hydro, wind, geothermal and solar are all clean sources of 
electricity. In fact there is no other reason to use fossil fuels than that 
those are cheaper then renewable sources. Geothermal alone has potential for 
several thousand times world energy need, and solar is potentially practically 
infinite.</p> 
<p>Please get your facts straight before making this claim again.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  11:37am | dec 29, 2008 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Patrick, generating hydrogen requires enormous amount of electricity,about 
factor of two more than what battery electric vehicles would use. Also hydrogen 
is extremely poor method of transporting energy because hydrogen leaks out from 
any container (hydrogen molecyle is basically just two protons surrounded by 
two electrons, so if that molecyle loses those electrons those protons go just 
straight thru any material), it compresses badly and itis extremely explosive.
</p> 
<p>One thing that TG didn't mention was that Honda FCX costs several 
**milion** dollars just to produce (you can't buy one), so compared to that 
Roadster is cheap car.</p> 
<p>There also is no hydrogen stations, while you can recharhge your Roadster 
at home or from any outlet out there. Charging time doesn't really matter if 
you charge your car duringnnight while you sleep. Batteries also are developing 
fast. With near future 600+ mile range BEV are real future. I don't think this 
hydrogen future will ever happen.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  11:47am | dec 29, 2008

<p></p> 
<p>Elliot Boyle, those Toshiba batteries have very poor energy density, so 
they would be useless to electric cars, but batteries do advance and fast. If 
you have some university access Sciencedirect Journal of Power Sources is great 
place to read what is happenng in battery tech. 450Wh/kg prototype battery has 
been already made (LiFePO4 cathode, Si anode battery), and that isn't best 
potential battery I have seen.</p>

<p>I was interested to look at top gear testing the tesla, but was 
disappointed that he was untruthful about the cars ability. I feel that they 
have a vested interest in seeing the electric car fail and will do anything to 
scupper the rise of the electric car. They do not have any vision. We know that 
electric cars have to be the future and the Tesla is a very exciting innovative 
leap forward.<br>

<p>Re: &quot;Burning no oil&quot;</p> 
<p>Dave you seem hell bent on getting Tesla to change the wording of their 
statement that &quot;It burns no oil.&quot; I don't understand your beef?</p> 
<p>Many purchasers of the Roadster are also buying the solar panel kit that is 
available and - over the course of a year - that will mean that they will 
purchase no electricity (for charging the vehicle). Some have already said that 
they are actually selling power back to the electric companies.</p> 
<p>Of course you could REALLY stretch it and point out that polymers come from 
coal and/or oil so Tesla is again guilty of false statements because of the 
materials from which their vehicle is made.</p> 
<p>Or there again you could just accept that &quot;Burns no oil&quot; is not 
just a figure of speech and is simply a regurgitated old chestnut.</p>

<p>About TopGear 55 miles range claim :</p> 
<p>1. Presented data about drivetrain losses make it possible to compute 
overall battery to wheel energy efficiensy. It changes from 62% at 40 mph to 
71% at 80 mph to 76% at 120 mph. All these numbers are significantly lower than 
80% efficiensy vaguely claimed for Tesla Roadster in the early days of 
development.<br>
 Assuming regenerative braking has same efficiensy as 
acceleration overall acceleration/deseleration energy retrun would be 40% to 
50%.</p> 
<p>2. Presented range is steady state - no acceleration/deseleration cycles. 
In case if TopGear raced with acceleration/deseleration between 60 mph and 120 
mph every about 300 meters (5 to 6 times per mile) based on 50% regeneration 
efficiensy and steady state range close to 110 miles (102 mph) resulted range 
would be close to 55 miles.</p> 
<p>So TopGear folks might actually get the 55 miles range they claim in real 
life by driving like described with a lot of turns and close to top speed. 
Based on the video they demonstrate that mode of operation is the only thing 
they care. Gasoline cars in such a mode do not suffer that much because they 
have higher range in general and could be refueled rapidly.<br>
 Unfortunately 
battery EV are not race cars from a range point of view. So Tesla Roadster is 
hardly a good race track car. On the other hand for fairly steady driving in 
the range 40 mph to 80 mph even with twisting road the car would demonstrate 
decent range. I guess the whole TopGear evaluation was badly focused from the 
car use model point of view expected for Tesla roadster most of the time.</p>

 Two

 They are wired in parallel, not series in a tube. This 
is so if one fails, then it has minimal impact on overall performance. You are 
correct that if they were in a tube, series wired, one failure would make the 
whole tube useless. A lot of work has gone into the design to make it safe and

<p>Anatoly, you said that battery EV:s are not race cars. I say that they can 
be. It is only matter of how fast you can &quot;recharge&quot; your car. F1 
fuels in about five seconds. You could make high energy density swappable 
primary battey pack for EV that does the same. Or you could use battery to 
battery charging, but then you couldn't &quot;recharge&quot; quite that fast.
</p> 
<p>Question: how often does diesel-powered car goes to pitstop in Le Mans 24h

similar result as some Porsche using battery to battery charging. If not yet,

<p>There is an awful lot of people coming up with a lot of great ideas in

etc. The tesla is already using divises to cool the batteries. By opening a 
small port in the front of the Tesla, and inserting a small squirel cage air 
driven divise, you can divert some of the kinetic energy that blows against the 
car and direct it to run a small alternator that would feed current back into 
the battery system, thus easily recharge the and extend the daily life of the 
batteries as you go.</p> 
<p>Another way you could do it, is to hook it to a wheel using a small drive 
shaft that would spin the alternator. I think the wind idea is better because 
you divert energy from the force of air against the front of the car and direct 
it downward through the squirel cage, and out below the vehicle.</p> 
<p>The other thing you could do is to use the downward force of inertia when 
you are going down hill to generate power back to the batteries, instead of 
having to break as much, kind of like regenerative brakeing, but it would be on 
all the time the car is coasting on its own inertia.</p> 
<p>I would like to know why this type of system would not work, and extend the 
driving time for the Tesla owners.</p>

 &quot;When 
electricity is cheap, clean and abundant, and when batteries / capacitors / 
hydrogen is/are cheap, light, small and rapidly rechargeable, no one will care 
about efficiency. They will only care about styling and utility. I look forward 
to seeing the exotic vehicles that will appear after we&rsquo;ve fully 
converted to renewable sources of energy.&quot;</p> 
<p>I'd like to point out that, despite how much a curmudgeon I must sound on 
this forum, I am an inveterate gadget head. I love imagining exotic technology. 
Experiments with electric cars should continue. I expect real benefits will 
come from that.</p> 
<p>Somebody on this blog praised Tesla for their honesty. While we're on the 
subject, guess what, I've owned a Prius for 3 years. However, I have no 
illusions that I'm rescuing the planet, except to the extent that driving a 
lighter, medium power car can help. I like very much not having to go to the 
gas pump as often. I am aware that the CO2 coming out my tailpipe, and 
generated in the manufacture and supply process, are not insignificant, and may 
actually add up to more than that for a conventional car. I have an idea that 
driving hybrid cars may help us prove, or disprove the concepts behind it's 
design.</p> 
<p>In our righteous zeal to save the world, we should avoid creating 
illusions. I am dubious that electric car experiments should be closely tied to 
marketing strategies. We should help educate the consumer about the complexity 
of the problem, instead of proclaiming that 2009 will be &quot;The Year of the 
Electric Car&quot; (New Yorl Times ?), for example.</p> 
<p>The proverbial cart is before the horse, in my opinion. We should PROVE 
that batteries can be made cheaply. What will happen to the cost of them as 
more and more people are driving electric cars.<br>
 As the relatively scarce 
raw materials, used to manufacture the batteries, come under higher and higher 
demand, the price of the battery will increase rapidly. We talk about Peak Oil. 
How far off is Peak Cadmium, for instance? Further, has it been proven that 
enough hydroelectric dams, windmills, nuclear power plants, and other sources 
of &quot;renewable energy&quot;, will ever satisfy demand for electricity to 
power the new world of electric cars?</p> 
<p>Attempting to solve these problems with technology is very exciting. It is 
inspiring to see what can be done, and dream about what might be done. Perhaps 
electric car experiments should proceed in parallel with development of 
renewable energy sources and reduction of greenhouse gasses.</p> 
<p>Mr Hendler, do you really want people to stop thinking about efficiency, 
and focus simply on styling and utility? I'm all for creation of genuinely 
renewable energy sources, as long as that goes hand in hand with creation of a 
carbon neutral atmosphere, following a massive reduction of atmospheric carbon. 
Seems a long ways off to me, but still worth pursuing.</p> 
<p>Recall the excitement over the apparent discovery of cold fusion? Until an 
energy perpetual motion machine is invented, we should obsess ourselves with 
energy efficiency, in both the local and global context.</p>

<p>I wrote to Elon just before Christmas, by post, awaiting reply. I have been 
looking at increased mileage from a different point of view. If my idea works I 
think it will advance electric cars dramatically. I believe that Porsche are 
trialling an electric 911 but the batteries and weight are enormous. I did not 
say too much in my letter because if it is useful then I think the Tesla would 
be the ideal development because of its power. On the other hand if it doesn't 
work it is just another idea for the bin.<br>
 I live in London and I feel that

<p>Dave,</p> 
<p>I do want people to stop obsessing about efficiency, to the point where 
most every sedan looks alike. I literally cannot tell the difference between 
some American, European and Japanese sedans. Much of that is due to 
copy-catting styling cues, as opposed to aerodynamic optimization, but 
aerodynamic optimization is, bar far, the most style limiting parameter, which 
is driven by efficiency / mileage targets.</p> 
<p>As I stated, when transportation energy techs allow clean, renewable, cheap 
and abundant energy, I DO want to see great variations in vehicle design - some 
retro, some futuristic, etc. I want to see many, many different styles and 
utilities in vehicle design.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Dave, you again make that false claim that BEV CO2 &quot;manufacturing and 
supply process...might add up more than conventional car&quot;. it DOES NOT. 
Not even close. That is very very far from true. Conventional car causes 
several times more pollution than BEV INCLUDING manufacturing and supply 
process.</p> 
<p>So I again urge you to get your facts right before making this claim again. 
</p> 
<p>You also make funny claim that renewable energy sources might not be enough 
for BEV:s. That is just plain silly. Like I wrote earlier geothermal alone has 
potential for several THOUSAND times world current use of electricity. Solar is 
even greater source. Only reason to stay in fossil fuels is that those are 
cheap.</p> 
<p>What happens to battery prices? Well, only really rare material is lithium 
itself, and that is recycleable and there are way more than enough of it for 
world battery need, also batteries develop so where now you need to use x 
amount of materials you soon need x/5 amount of material. Then you only need 
manufacturing plants. So,yes, their prices will go down.</p> 
<p>Even with batteries current prices you win compared to gas during car life 
cycle.</p> 
<p>One question, Dave: which gas company gives you money for distributing 
these plain wrong informations?</p>

<p>To Timo :</p> 
<p>Sure if somebody figures out how to swap heavy battery pack in EV such cars 
could be managed as nice race cars. I guess A123 kind of battery (high power) 
battery should be used or similar style. You will need 3 to 5 battery packs so 
that while one of them is in the car others are under charging.</p> 
<p>For A123 or similar 10C, ~80 Wh / kg type battery we one could have say 
~400 kg pack so that we have ~30 kWh with steady power up to ~300 kW. That 
would manage I guess ~15 min of racing with average ~120 kW and speed between 
100 to 200 mph. If battery packs could be swapped in 10-20 sec that would 
manage decent racing periods. Having enough packs charging in parallel would 
match changing time under 15 min so that battery packs could be swapped without 
delays. Having several thousand recharge cycles would help to keep battery 
packs alive for decent time under such heavy recharging conditions.</p> 
<p>Some issue exist how to manage swapping heavy battery packs fast but 
keeping structural integrity of the car under heavy accelerations. I guess it 
could be solved although would be a challenge.<br>
 But EV has inherent 
advantage of steady high torwue without gear switching. So likely it would beat 
gasoline cars in racing even with battery swapping time losses.</p> 
<p>Just this is not the Tesla roadster design - that is all.</p>

<p>Why measure watt/hrs per mile?</p> 
<p>Miles per watt/hr is much more intuitive (at least to me) because its 
closer to &quot;MPG(miles per gallon)&quot;, and defines vehicle range 
ultimately by battery capacity.</p>

<p>To Timo, who asked me:<br>
 &quot; which gas company gives you money for 
distributing these plain wrong informations?&quot;</p> 
<p>Gas companies BAD. Electric car companies GOOD.<br>
 I thought it was clear 
that I am speculating, hence I say: &quot;manufacturing and supply 
process&hellip;might add up more than conventional car&quot;. &quot;might&quot;
<br> Far from offering facts (I'm not an expert on any of this), rather I am 
trying to encourage sober thought and careful research before jumping on the 
bandwagon.</p> 
<p>You seem to be offering as absolute fact that the electric pollutes far 
less than the conventional car. You may be right. I've heard arguments of both 
sides of the electric vs internal combustion argument. In the controversy over 
whether the Hummer is actually less polluting than the Prius, &quot;dust to 
dust&quot;, computer models predict the Prius should pollute less than the 
Hummer. It would be interesting to see what the prediction would be comparing 
the Prius with a gas-efficient conventional car in the same weight class. EPA 
rated the Prius at 55 MpG. Consumer Reports says the Prius figures are 20% 
higher than actual. In fact I've never gotten more than 45 MpG. The VW Golf 
gets 38 MpG, not too far behind. Should we dismiss the possibility conventional 
cars can be made just as low polluting as electrics, just because they have a 
tailpipe?</p> 
<p>No question the electric car gets better mileage. However, the burden of 
proof is on the engineers, manufacturers, electric power companies and battery 
recyclers, that electric cars will significantly reduce greenhouse gasses 
globally.</p> 
<p>It seems the electric car was killed by the combined forces of big oil, 
Detroit and deregulation, involving deceit and misleading marketing. Those 
forces see &quot;Burns no Gas&quot; as an affront. If threatened, they might 
try to tear apart such a statement, and could easily do so. They are grand 
masters of marketing. Don't hand them the opportunity. Do more than just figure 
out how to sell an electric car to the conventional consumer interested in 
protecting the environment. Present irrefutable facts based on actual data. Now 
there's an innovative marketing strategy!</p>

<p>Todd, I guess it is just matter of what are you doing:</p> 
<p>53kWh battery pack, 240 mile range = 53000/240 = 220 Wh/mile == 240/53 = 
4.5 miles/kWh.</p> 
<p>First case shows directly how much power car is using per mile, so it is 
better determining how big battery pack you need for certain goal range, latter 
shows more directly how far you get with fixed size battery pack (assuming that 
multiplying is easier than dividing for normal human being).</p>

<p>Dave, Prius is a non-efficient parallel hybrid car. It has usual extremely 
low efficiency gas engine, so it doesn't surprise me that you get bad result 
from that. Pure BEV is entirely different beast. I assume your Prius is a model 
where you can drive with electric engine alone, right? If you are driving with 
electric only, how many MPGs do you then get?</p> 
<p>It all goes back to efficiency. Which is more efficient, generating 
electricity in power plant and then run that electricity in ~80% efficiently in 
EV or burn fossil fuel in gasoline car with very low efficiency + refining 
process losses? Fact is that conventional car engine is very bad in turning 
combustion to kinetic energy.</p> 
<p>If you then add to that calculation that electricity can be produced 
entirely free from fossil fuels then BEV pollution isn't even close to 
traditional gasoline engine. You can even generate that electricity yourself by 
wind, water or solar systems, no need for big companies assuming you live in 
place you can access those resources. If you do then your MPG is actually 
infinite, because you get some miles but you burn zero gallons of gas, and as 
everybody knows anything bigger than zero divided by zero is infinite. There 
are countries in this world right now that don't use fossil fuels at all for 
their electricity needs because they have geothermal or water resources for 
them. There is no reason why US should be any different.</p> 
<p>You have 500+ billion military budged. Cut that to half (who is attacking 
you? Canada? Mexico?) and use that 250 billion for geothermal and solar power 
plant development and production, get everybody their own Roadster or Type S or 
Electric Porsche and your entire country would be free from foreign oil in no 
time. If you do that you also cut down money flow to middle-east and by 
side-effect cut down terrorist money sources.</p> 
<p>What comes to &quot;manufacturing process&quot; pollution, EV engine is 
less complex and batteries can be recycled. No more pollution there, less would 
be my guess. Transportation or &quot;supply process&quot; as you name it is 
obviously less polluting (electricity is transported by wire, wires do no 
pollute).</p> 
<p>You did also earlier talk about &quot;relatively scare raw materials&quot; 
in batteries. LiFePO4 - Silicon battery would be consisted from Lithium 
(relatively rare, but more than enough is around, as it can be recycled and 
doesn't disappear anywhere in batteries), Iron (very common), Phosporous (is 
used as fertilizer, common), Oxygen (most common element in the crust) and 
Silicon (second most common element in the crust).</p> 
<p>You simply did have pretty much all your &quot;facts&quot; or claims wrong 
so badly that it felt like trolling. If you did not try to spread 
misinformation and you are just curious if BEV is greener than conventional car 
then I urge you to read some more or just believe that BEV is greener than 
conventional car.</p>

<p>Thanks for publishing the information J B . Is the 55Kwh figure that you 
quote the maximum output from the fully charged battery pack? and how does this 
drop off over the recharging cycles? Would the nanotech batteries which the 
Lightning company propose to use give a safer quick charge and better 
performance?</p> 
<p>The BBC &quot;Top Gear&quot; programme ( you can tell I'm a Brit by the way 
I correctly spell programme ) was extremely unfair. I watched the programme 
after it had been broadcast because I had heard it being discussed. I did write 
to them and suggest that they read some of the papers which Prof Ulf Bossel has 
written on the subject of Hydrogen as synthetic fuel. I don't think they 
researched their material very well before scripting the prog. I would not take 
it seriously but for the fact that most TV viewers sit on their brains and will 
not have subjected the statements to critical thought. The received ' wisdom' 
they will have taken away from the programme is that cars which store their 
energy of propulsion in highly compressed explosive are the vehicle of the 
future whilst tried and tested accumulator storage is a dead end. The BBC is a 
public service broadcaster and not tied to sponsors in any way so tends to be 
trusted more than a commercially funded broadcaster. They should be more 
responsible and I shall probably write to them again if I fail to get a 
response. If you receive an apology from them will you please publish it on the 
website.</p> 
<p> I liked the comment by Nubo on 24th Dec. about the Hamster-wheel. I have 
also read Rachel K's response to the programme. She clarified a few points 
regarding the supposed 55 mile range and the 'brake failure' which wasn't .</p>

<p>Whatever the facts of EV versus Petrol/Diesel powered cars.We need to focus 
on the fact that oil might run out sooner than we think.So we are then faced 
with the dilemma of how we produce all of the other items that sustain our ever 
demanding lifestyles that are products of oil.<br>
 Can we think of any modern 
product that are not made or produced from oil !!!!!<br>
 Our life has been 
subsidised by oil for generations -Without oil this planet could not sustain 
the current population.<br>
 The arguments are not purely &quot;Green&quot; - 
they should be about conservation of a precious resource. it is interesting 
that the oil rich nations are building nuclear power plants -they know that one 
day it will run out and they are being prudent and building for the future.<br>

 What I am trying to say is that we need oil but lets give other technologies 
the investment that has been given to the I.C.E( internal combustion engined ) 
car manufacturers.<br>
 Governments are at last seeing the light and creating 
an environment where the gas guzzlers are taxed out of existence. Tesla have 
proven that it is possible to build a sports car that is fun to drive without 
consuming vast quantities of oil.<br>
 The other fact that is dis-regarded when 
folk go on about the oil being used to produce the electricity to charge E.V is 
that often the car batteries will be re-charged overnight on off- peak 
electricity as it used to be called.This is the electricity that is being 
produced regardless of demand when most people are asleep. I know that there 
will be people saying that this is ramped down at night tomatch demand but the 
generators are still running!<br>
 Let us embrace new technology -Those who 
don't evolve end up extinct . Future generations will curse us for squandering 
all the oil reserves.<br>
 E.V's are getting there and the I.C.E car 
manufacturers are worried and so they should be!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>To Dave Fisher about EV efficiensy :</p> 
<p>You are correct noticing that battery electric car still use electric 
energy mostly generated from fossil fuel. BUT you are missing at least 
following critically important facts :</p> 
<p>1. Energy conversion efficiensy for electricity generation by stationary 
power plant is at least 50 % for most horrible coal plants and is 60 % in 
general. Energy efficiensy of charge/discharge of Li-ion batteries is at least 
90 %. Energy efficiensy of electric transmission is easily 90 % and coule be 
made up to 97 %. Overall efficiensy from fossil fuel to mechanical energy 
coming to wheels would be 40 % worst case and 50 % average.</p> 
<p>For comparison energy efficiensy of regular gasoline car engine is 20 % 
worst case and less than 30 % average. So here we have almost twice more 
efficient overall fossil fuel energy use for mechanical driving regardless that 
we have more complicated energy conversion.</p> 
<p>2. Electric car has ability of regenerative braking. So if you reduce speed 
during driving or if you go downhill in electric vehicle you reuse at least 50 
% of that energy back to driving. In fact up to 90 % of that energy could be 
reused back to driving with proper design. This is basically the only reason 
why hybrid cars has betetr mileage. For example Toyota Camry has 28 mpg EPA but 
Toyota Hybrid has about 40 mpg EPA. This difference characterises energy 
efficiensy improvement from regenerative braking.</p> 
<p>Regular ICE cars (not hybrids) do not have described energy efficiensy 
improvement.</p> 
<p>3. From CO2 emission point of view if you use coal you have 38 MJ / kg of 
carbon ( 3.67 kg of CO2 per 1 kg of carbon ) which generates 96 g of CO2 per 
every MJ of energy. For gasoline we have 45 MJ / kg of fuel ( 3.14 kg of CO2 
per 1 kg of fuel ) making 69 g of CO2 per every MJ of energy. Comparing worst 
case electric case with 40 % overall efficiensy we get 240 g of CO2 per 1 MJ of 
wheels energy versus about the same mass of CO2 of regular gasoline car per 
same wheels energy.<br>
 But it is not fair to compare absolute worst case for 
electric car with absolute best case for gasoline car. In case if you take 
average for fossil fuels you get aboput twice less pollution from electric car 
because of twice less fossil fuel energy use coming to wheels for same driving.
</p> 
<p>4. Electricity could be generated from solar power or wind power which are 
practical and even business profitable technologies of electric generation 
today making no CO2 generation while operating. This makes electric cars better 
positioned for the future CO2 reduction compared to gasoline cars.</p> 
<p>5. The only significant manufacturing difference between electric car and 
gasoline car is big battery pack. For Li-ion battery it includes carbon, 
lithium and cobalt oxide. It is hard to see how extraction of all these 
elements would generate any dramatic amount of extra CO2 pollution. Materials 
of such batteries are not consumed by its aging. So with proper recycle of 
electric vehicle batteries at the end of life point most of the materials would 
come back to new electric car batteries. So it is hard to see how this 
manufacturing difference could manage any game changing pollution or energy use.
</p> 
<p>---</p> 
<p>So electric cars apparently could dramatically reduce fossil fuel usage and 
CO2 pollution. I think it is hard to dispute that in honest way based on 
numbers, facts etc.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately cost of electric car batteries in current mareket and 
industry conditions certainly offset cost of gasoline per overall ifetime of 
the car as long as gasoline is less than $10 per gallon at least I guess. CO2 
pollution today has zero associated cost for polluter.<br>
 Under these 
conditions electric cars could not get any significant market penetration any 
time soon. Basically world do not have enough economic insentive either for 
fossil fuel economy or CO2 pollution reduction. That explains lack of electric 
cars mass scale presence so far.</p> 
<p>Sure as many people noticed if battery cost per capacity would drop say 3 - 
4 times everything would change. In that case electric cars number in mass 
scale use would grow explosively until almost compete turn around with gasoline 
cars. Cost of batteries is the only remaining big issue. So for high end cars 
because cost is no issue I believe we would see more and more fully electric 
car models coming in next few years.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>About Prius efficiensy :</p> 
<p>Efficiensy increase in Prius comes from regenerative braking - basically 
reuse of energy from brakes or from going downhill. But on the other hand 
constant use of electricity on large scale during driving introduce extra 
energy conversion with associated losses.</p> 
<p>So we have a balance of two factors with reletive significance determined 
by driving pattern. If you are driving mostly on freeways and do not use brakes 
almost completely regenerative braking would not be used but energy losses of 
electric transmission would still be playing. Under that conditions it is hard 
to see how Prius could make better mileage.<br>
 But for example for taxi 
driving with many starts/stops because of traffic ligths and just random but 
short commutes advantages of regenerative braking make it much more efficient.
<br> Basically such dependence on driving pattern makes it harder to compare 
just mpg numbers introducing wide variety of opinions about Prius efficiensy.

<p></p> 
<p>A quick way to swap out battery packs would have service stations selling 
charged packs for $10 if you left your drained one behind. This would give you 
great range and make re-charge time meaningless. Service station owners might 
start installing nanosolar roofs over their lots.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>One question i think might be worth thinking about. When we are 
freewheeling down a hill -presumably the regenerative braking is happening in 
an electric car due to the fact that the power is not applied and the motors 
act as generators. This will have an effect on distance travelled as any 
kinetic energy is tranferred to the battery with associated losses. Has anyone 
considered if by declutching and rolling down the hill it might be possible to 
travel further (obviously without recharging battery).<br>
 Basically what I 
mean is:- does the regen energy produced + distance travelled using this regen 
energy = distance that could be achieved by just freewheeling down a long hill.
<br> Anyone knows that by throttling off when driving down a hill declutching 
and rolling saves petrol. Could this be employed in an electric car with some 
clever electronics to disengage drive during certain conditions. i do not know 
the answers but it might be worth exploring.Perhaps an economy mode switch?</p>

widely seperated, and regular charging plugs placed at parking spots. You then 
subscribe to their service. Nissan/Renault has already committed to building 
the cars for them.</p> 
<p>Prius efficiency is also due to the Atkinson cycle engine. Where standard 
Otto cycle engines get about 20% efficiency, Atkinson cycle engines get 30% 
efficiency, but at the cost of low end torque, which is offset in the Prius by 
the electric motor.</p>

 The Roadster has regeneration on the 'gas' pedal. This means 
that when you let off the pedal, it goes to a neutral point and if you let it 
off even more, regen kicks in. At the neutral point, the electric motor 
freewheels and produces no drag and no thrust, just like declutching an ICE 
(Internal Combustion Engine). This allows you to determine whether you are 
freewheeling or using regenerative braking by simply backing off on the 'gas' 
pedal.<br>
 As you surmise, regeneration isn't generally as efficient as just 
letting kinetic energy build up through speed. There is, of course a speed 
where the air drag losses exceed the losses of regeneration. Therefore, for 
optimal efficiency, one would use regeneration if there was a maximum speed 
that you don't want to exceed and there is probably a speed at which you should 
probably start using regen to maintain since you wouldn't store much additional 
kinetic energy anyway. I don't know where that speed is but from JB's graphs 
above, its probably around 90 to 100 mph.</p>

<p>I live in Stuttgart, around the corner from the main railway station. I 
want to travel to Munich, let's say the main station there to pick up a friend. 
Once i get on the autobahn, i ll have it do a constant 110 kph (quite slow for 
german average, i d say). Anyway, bearing in mind i have to get out of the city 
valley, on to the autobahn and then, after passing the airport i have to gain 
height again while climbing the swabian alps, do you think i could get to 
Munich in one go (nice weather, not to windy)? Now, that's the sort of 
confidence-inspiring test drive that I'd iike to see here in Germany (or, for 
that matter, similar trips in the US). Anybody got any thoughts on this??? leo

<p>How about powering the PGE grid to a special lane on the freeways, that 
would transfer electricity by direct contact or induction as the car travels in 
the lane. The power would be transfered by a dropdown induction coil or drag 
unit that would induce energy by the movement of the car from the center cable 
/ or copper grid, to the vehicle for charging as it traveled. With the car 
moving along in the special freeway lane, a large induction coil moving along 
close to the power cable or copper center rail, would charge the car. These 
charging lanes can be installed very cheaply on the special lane, and could 
extend throughout the state. The vehicles could enter and leave these lanes as 
needed along the freeways. Induction coil technology would be ideally used for 
this process, and the technology is available today off the shelf. This would 
be much better, and cheaper than battery stations everywhere, and would charge 
right off the grid as the car moves.</p> 
<p>Underground high voltage induction cable that charged the vehicle as the 
car moved could be installed as well.</p>

<p>Electricity can be produced by wind energy by the installation of large 
wind mills as seen on the Altamont pass, operated by PGE, and would be cleaner 
than using coal plants, and the power delived to the special charging lanes on 
the freeways. Power use would be billed directly by your local utility company, 
and would show up on your home bill. Once the large charging capacitor can be 
developed, and the batteries could be charged quickly, you could use only the 
wind on a downhill run, to charge the vehicle quickly, and could increase 
efficency greatly.</p>

<p>I don't see future in battery swapping model. That would require that 
batteries for all cars are similar and no new inventions in battery tech 
happens, which for now is just opposite. Of course you can make &quot;Tesla 
Model S -battery swapping station&quot; but how would you make this financially 
viable? There will never be enough &quot;Type S&quot; -cars in close proximity 
of swapping station to make that profitable. Even that Tesla will be first in 
business, there are others that follow, and I would be VERY surprised if they 
had same configuration as Tesla for their batteries. What you would end up with 
is station with several full battery packs for each model year and each model 
type and each manufacturer for it to be able to service all that come to get 
new batteries. Batteries also lose capacity over time, so that is another loss 
for that model.</p> 
<p>What you are using in EV is electricity, not batteries. Swapping batteries 
is like swapping gasoline tank. What you should do is to figure out how to make 
battery to battery recharging using high voltages safe. Some batteries can be 
recharged in just few minutes, so it only depends how high in voltages and amps 
you can go safely to make battery recharging fast. 15-30 minutes for 100-200kWh 
battery pack should be considered fast for a car that _only_ uses those 
stations during very long road trips. That would require 2000V 200A charging 
system.</p> 
<p>Battery to battery recharging model is cheaper (basically same components, 
only a lot cheaper because you need only one big cheap stationary battery 
instead of multitude of expensive car batteries), can be used with any battery 
tech that will ever be invented, and can be used without any standard battery 
model, only recharging connection would require standardization.</p>

<p>Why can't you change modes on the fly so that you can go to performance

<p>If you look at JB's table above the Tesla uses around 280WH/mile or so at

<p>Leo of Stuttgart: Tesla Motors is located near the Coast Range in 
California, and many of their test runs were running through those mountains. 
Also, Tesla Motors did do a run up to Lake Tahoe in the nearby Sierra Nevada 
mountains, climbing up through Donner pass. It performed nicely.</p> 
<p>Ronald Wose: Good idea, but it needs to be cooridnated with the government 
as they own the roads, and with several auto makers as no one company would 
have sufficient market share to make &quot;powered roads&quot; practical by 
themselves.</p> 
<p>Timo: The key to battery swapping is to have one company lease the 
batteries and run the swap stations - then they'd bw swapping their own 
batteries for their customers. By using a standard modular design, they could 
work in lots of different models - a compact car might have just 1 or 2 
modules, a midsize 3 or 4, a large SUV or truck might have 6 or more. Nor would 
it prevent battery improvements, the leasing company could, over time, replace 
older batteries with new improved versions, a data chip on each battery pack 
would enable programmable controllers on the cars to work with any new type of 
battery!</p> 
<p>Bob Beyers: Shallow discharge puts less stress on the battery than deeper 
discharges, so frequent charging will actually improve battery lifespan. The 
liIon batteries used in the Roadster do not suffer the &quot;memory 
effect&quot; that plagued old NiCad batteries, unlike NiCads, frequent shallow 
discharge and recharge will not cause a loss of capacity. Keeping it 
&quot;topped off&quot; also makes it less likely to run out during an 
unexpected extra trip!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>CM: how would you make battery swapping station profitable? Car batteries 
cost something like five times as much as stationary cheap battery where 
battery to battery charging could be made. Also who would allow swapping to 
older versions of their car batteries? I bet no-one. It severely hurts battery 
development. You would need to have always that latest design in battery 
swapping station _with_ all older designs too. Are you planning to keep this 
same design for potentially 10-15 years? Just plain shape of the swappable 
battery is a restriction that there should not be.</p> 
<p>Getting different EV companies to choose same battery design would prove to 
be impossibility. Tesla has their own design, Fisker theirs, etc. That would 
lead to multitude of different designs. What kind of standard would you choose? 
Where to put it in 18-wheeler and roadster? How to swap that? How about some 
more exotic work vehicle? Bike? How about having old type S batteries and then 
going in swapping station to get five times better batteries? How much would 
you pay for those batteries? What if you don't want to pay anything extra, and 
you are satisfied with your current batteries? What if you go to place where 
there is no _your company_ battery swapping stations? What then?</p> 
<p>Battery swapping is like swapping gas tank. It just doesn't make any sense 
when you can fast recharge your car using electricity. Just standard 
three-phase high-amp connector could charge Roadster-size battery pack in 
something like half a hour, and you can go much higher voltages safely. Those 
charging stations would be used only by long-range road trips so if you wait 
for half a hour every eight hours to get your car charged it isn't that bad. 
Get a cup of coffee while waiting. Electricity is cheap and people charge their 
cars at their homes, so getting those stations profitable is a challenge. You 
can make them profitable only by attaching other services to them. Like 
restaurants.</p>

<p>Hi</p> 
<p>A comment from Sweden:</p> 
<p>Formerly on long trips you used horses and when they were tired you changed 
them. Could you do the same thing with your Tesla either change after say 150 
miles to another Tesla or another battery or charge your Tesla fast (3-phase) 
at a chargingplace for an hour while taking a meal or just relax? You must not 
be in a hurry all life!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Hi everybody. </p> 
<p>I am reading these forums for quite some time but I rarely write something. 
The thing made me write now are the charts and the data provided by Tesla. Guys 
this is gold mine for me, I like all the technical stuff and all the 
calculations that can be made. Here are some of my thoughts.</p> 
<p>1. Forget already about Battery Swapping and powered roads. It just CANT be 
made now. May be in 20-50 years we can have power roads, swapping batteries is 
totally not viable so stop proposing it almost every day.<br>
 2. Although the 
main problem of the battery cars is the range achievable, I think the bigger 
problem is the recharging. The more range you put to your e-car the more Kw/h 
you will need to recharge it and we are getting to BIG numbers here. even 50 
kw/h in 10 mins is so hard to do, imagine bigger battery packs (when new 
batteries are developed). Until we figure this out there are 2 paths for EV's
</p> 
<p> 1. Keep the recharging at home and hopefully the range is enough for you. 
(Even 100 kw/h battery pack could be recharged in about 8-12 h at home). That 
would mean you have to reach destination before battery depleted<br>
 2. Make 
the EV's consume less energy for mile. Thats the hard part but I think there 
are things that can be considered here and the benefits are great. As we can 
all see from the charts the Aerodinamic drag is the greatest force you need to 
overcome at highway speeds. So any breakthrough or new designes there will 
bring fruits for the EV's. I can think of some right now. Some Italian designer 
removed all screen wipers and used a glass that is repelling water so the water 
just slides during raining. That only brings down the drag by 5%.<br>
 Another 
things are small but still improving like incorporated door handles, flat 
underbody (which is easy achievable by EV), I even saw a concept of a car which 
roof was lowering if there is only one passenger in the car making the car 
lower and with lower Aerodinamic profile.<br>
 Another thing I saw lately was a 
breakthrough in the Aerodinamic models and simulations. Some MIT scientists 
figured out the 3d simulation for fluids which can bring to new inventions that 
reduce Aerodinamic drag.<br>
 Thats the correct way all EV's should orient by 
my opinion. Efficiency.</p> 
<p> Another thing I noticed is that Auxiliary takes about 200Wh energy (even 
with no lights no AC, no blowers etc). I am guessing this energy is going for 
the battery pack cooling and on board computers, dashboard etc. If you use 
batteries that doesn't need managing that will lower the Auxiliary power 
needed. You can also take advantage of the latest electronics, and use for 
example ULV processors and parts for the computers. You can use more effective 
LED lights in future, you can use PV paint on the car for additional power from 
the sun.</p> 
<p> All these problems make me think that in the future cars will be smaller, 
more compact and highly efficient. May be we will see a lot of 2 seat cars (one 
behind another), making the profile of the car half size thus allowing not only 
2 vehicles using 1 lane but also reducing the power needed to travel at highway 
speeds almost in half.</p> 
<p> We cant make a global Electric power stations in just few years, that's 
not very hard to figure out. However we can see a lot of new EV vehicles 
released in the next 2-5 years (may be hundreds). So instead of thinking how to 
make global recharging stations (which is unbeliavably expensive) we better 
start thinking out of the box and use every idea we have. Because Every Wh 
energy counts, and the more EV's are out there the more Electricity we will 
need and we need to compensate it somehow or add it to our calculations.</p> 
<p>May be in near future we will all have 2 vehicles. One small 2 seater (one 
behind other) city vehicles which will double the density in the cities and one 
family saloon car for the long trips. The 2 seaters will also greatly help with 
the parking problem all Europe and I am sure all the world is suffering. And 
the cars will get more and more (as the people get more and more)</p> 
<p>At the end of this long write up I want to wish you all a good health for 
the new 2009 and let it bring us some great inventions and products that we can 
use sooner.</p> 
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>How is the battery's effeciency and life affected in the cold? I live in 
Canada and am definitely excited about the developments happening at Tesla. 
Would love to see your vehicles make it up here. But was wondering how the 
performance would be impacted in the cold and in snow driving conditions.</p>

<p>About battery swapping :</p> 
<p>In the consumer electronics we could see something like video compression 
standards for example common for all the products. So nothing prevents to set a 
standard of voltage, sustained power and peak power for a battery pack 
regardless with what flavor of Li-ion or NiMh battery chemistry is utilized. 
Geometry of battery pack may be standardized too including mechanical and 
electrical sockets. The only difference between battery packs in that case 
based on chemistry would be total capacity. Sure it could be created a market 
to make different battery packs by different manufacturers according to 
standards like these.<br>
 Based on the same set of standards different EV 
could be made. It is possible to modularize the standard so that by using say 1 
to 4 modules all the differences in total energy capacity requirement between 
cars could be covered.<br>
 Altogether assuming set of standards is maintained 
and some significant number of BEV hit the road it appears that we have a model 
in which we could put any battery pack into any BEV making logistics of battery 
swapping no so bad as you described.</p> 
<p>In terms of business model we could assume that all the battery packs are 
the property of some big business company. This would be legally similar to how 
people use Microsoft software under Windows. Microsoft stays the onwer of the 
software and just lease some installation and use rights to cistomers paying 
money for that software. So you end up with the model in which you buy the 
service to replace your battery pack with some energy capacity by another 
battery pack with bigger energy capacity stored in it. It is feasible to 
develop some algorithm how much that should cost you. For example it would be a 
fixed charge for single battery module swap. It would be also cost per kWh of 
extra energy you got by such swap. I guess it should be also a history of 
recharges stored in the microcontrollers of the battery pack and readable by 
some standard protocol. Time of keeping battery pack from previous swap would 
be also taken into account similarly via microcontroller of the battery pack 
itself.</p> 
<p>As long as you trickle charge at home or any other way you do not pay for 
battery pack swapping. But otherwise with swapping of leased packs questions of 
battery life limitations, slow charge and other complications of batteries 
could be solved in a way that regular BEV drivers should not handle them much. 
They would pay services for swapping batteries and they are allowed to trickle 
charge batteries without swapping as many times as they like. Both of these 
modes of usage seems would solve most of the logistical issues related to 
batteries including slow recharge.</p> 
<p>Having battery swapping stations based on described common standards 
arranged together with car rental services near airports would expose many 
people to BEV driving without forcing them to spend a lot of money for 
&quot;scary new technology&quot;. Same centers could provide services to park 
BEV for a day or few days. In that case you BEV would be stored without battery 
pack reducing fee for keeping that pack inside without use etc.</p> 
<p>Under all described conditions battery swapping appears to become become 
fairly routine operation and questions of battery pack design, age etc would be 
solved by the fact that battery pack is not the car driver property. Sure it 
exist a question of mechanically robust sockets to fix heavy pack in the car 
and many other questions. Sure it exist a question of customer acceptance of 
described use model in general. Sure it exist a question of defining all the 
right standards I mentioned enabling the model.</p> 
<p>But just in general I do not see that answers to all these questions are so 
certain and obvious that anyone could definitely exclude battery swapping as a 
potentially reasonable option for BEV. May be this would be the way to go to 
get rid of oil but still keep conveniences of personal transportation.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Timo, I'm not the one that is going to set up and run the battery swapping 
system, I'm just expanding on what others have planned, mainly Project Better 
Place. Battery swaps are technically feasable, but I'm not certain whether it 
will be used enough to be successful as an ongoing business. I'm also not 
certain what the terms of the swappable battery lease will be, but I presume it 
would call for free replacment of any battery pack that fails or falls below a 
certain performance level. Over time, old batteries would have to be replaced, 
and eventually it might make more sense to replace old packs with a newer 
higher performing and possibly cheaper type of battery, especially if the older 
type is no longer made. Older batteries that no longer performed well enough 
for automotive use might still have value as &quot;load leveling&quot; 
batteries for electrical utilities, and finally, at the end, would be recycled.
<br> Obviously, battery swapping would only be used on vehicles designed for 
it, and swapping would NOT be done on EVs that were not designed for it. 
Swapping doesn't make any sense for plug-in hybrids, or slow speed 
&quot;Neighborhood electrics&quot;, and if &quot;thousand mile&quot; batteries 
become practical they wouldn't use it, either.<br>
 It is debatable whether 
&quot;fast charging&quot; is better or cheaper than &quot;swapping&quot;, 
swapping is likely to be quicker, fast charging stands would take less space 
and could be more widely distributed. Don't forget that they are not mutually 
exclusive, EVs could be designed to work with both swapping and fast charging.

<p>Jube: Tesla Motors winter tested their Roadster in Sweden, and it performed 
very well on ice, even when very cold. Testing results were posted on this

<p></p> 
<p>Has any thought been given to using micro capacitors instead of batteries. 
They don't have capacity loss over time, can release their energy more quickly, 
can be charged more quickly and so on... Also has any thought been given to 
dividing up the baqttery into sections that can be removed for less weight or 
added for greater distance or replaced individually to lower replacement cost, 
or even have a spare set that you can swap out, so the car is always charged 
for emergencies?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Brian H  12:17pm | jan 20, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Dan;<br>
 in brief, energy density (total capacity) and danger of explosive 
shorting are the main objections to capacitors.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  CM  8:00pm | jan 21, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Dan, capacitors, even ultracapacitors, have a much lower energy density 
than even lead acid batteries. A capacitor bank big enough to store the same 53 
Kwh that the Roadster battery holds would weigh about 6 tons and be the size of 
a semi truck trailer. Also, because of the low energy density, the cost per Kwh 
stored would be much higher.</p> 
<p>Dividing up the battery pack into removable modules wasn't considered for 
the Roadster, due to the cooling requirements of the battery, and also because 
a smaller battery offers less power - not good for a sports car! There is a 
possibility a modular battery pack might be used for future models, if certain 
technical problems are solved and it proves to be practical.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Straubel:</p> 
<p> Thank you thank you for providing real, actionable graphs showing real 
world performance of the Tesla Roadster.</p> 
<p> We enthusiasts hunger for more hard numbers, such as these graphs youve 
provided, er... provide!</p> 
<p> Is there any chance you have a graph correlating battery charger 
efficiency with charging rate/ and or discharge state?</p> 
<p> If not, it might be an area worth pursuing. As a guess, I would imagine 
total battery charging efficiency would be greatest at very low charge rates 
(1500 watts or less), due to not needing to run the car's air conditioning, as 
well as minimizing i squared r losses everywhere. But it would be intersting to 
get some info from you on this subject.</p>

<p>I have some things that have been on my mind since the gm electric car was 
killed in the 90's . 1. Why not put a generator of sufficant size on an 
electric car connected to the drive train so as the wheels turn ( dams have 
been useing this technology for more then my or your lifetime ) it will be 
charging the battery by creating eletricity giving the car an almost unlimited 
distance . Safegards could could easily be put into place to keep the battery 
from being overcharged . This to me seems elementery . 2. As far as the 
overheating problem with batteries that I have read about real or not , why not 
devlop a battery cooling technology . Heat rises draw the heat off the top of 
the battery is one suggestion . wrapping the battery is anther possible 
suggestion or both working together . Disregared if you already have a cool 
battery technology . Better battery tech is always being devloped . 3. Make the 
recharge connection compatable with existing tech such as sumething as simple 
as a 440 plug for your home if you do not have that now . I have ideas all yhe 
time some good some not , and i'm always available at this e-mail address . If 
you have any questions . I really really want to see this car and your company 
succeed . By the way have you capitalized your compavy , and is your company on 
the NYSE , and whay are your call letters , and your exact company name .

<p>To john hill :</p> 
<p>1. What you proposing here is the same as regenerative braking just 
implemented without extra gear as you proposed. This is already a part of 
current Tesla roadster design and is usual part of any EV or hybrid design. 
Unfortunately most fundamental law of physics is law of energy conservation. 
Its action completely prevents getting &quot;...almost unlimited 
distance...&quot; as you put it. You would just get some significant driving 
distance increase but far from unlimited. The physics law mentioned was 
established since year 1842 by direct experience of the whole humanity. It is 
also confirmed by everything humanity observed so far about 13 billion years of 
Universe existence. Thousands of creative people tried to violate that law by 
some technical design but nobody get any sligtest success.</p> 
<p>2. Heating and cooling of battery pack is also already implemented as part 
of existing Tesla roadster design.</p> 
<p>3. Tesla roadster has a charger compatible with regular residential 
electricity sockets.</p> 
<p>So it seems all you proposals are already implemented in Tesla Motors 
technology.</p>

seeing it on an episode of Future Car. I believe that the Tesla offers some 
real insight and potential for future automotive development. However, despite 
the real advantages offered by the Li-on batteries, what is to come in future 
battery production; speaking in more readily available materials, that will 
allow further range, lifespan, use, and development. Certainly, as technology 
and scale of economy comes into play, the cost will come down; but it seems the 
biggest factor in future development remains the materials required to produce 
batteries. What real world alternatives may come into play to aid expansion and 
increased use of electric vehicles?</p> 
<p>Additionally, many have posed thoughts of extending range, or aiding 
charging via use of petroleum based power plants; what about the addition of a 
small biodiesel engine to assist in extending battery range by either taking 
over active devices during high demand conditions, such as blower motors, 
audio, and lighting? Perhaps even providing a small charging capability to 
extend range, if only a matter of a couple miles, to reach a recharging station?
<br> Added benefit to this could also be the use of a heat exchanger to aid 
cockpit/battery heating in cold climate conditions which would aid reducing the 
demands on vehicle batteries as it could provide the power to it's own electric 
fan, boosting it own efficiency. It also helps to keep the Tesla highly 
independent of petroleum based products, and fuel could be obtained at any 
supermarket.</p> 
<p>These are thoughts and don't diminish the accomplishment of this vehicle. 
Since my interest has be piqued, I would love to own one of these; I just have 
to wait until I can afford one.</p>

<p>how do the chargers cope with different supplies ?<br>
 are they adjustable 
or made for a certain amps/volt ?<br>
 dc-dc/ac converters could charge from 
pretty much<br>
 any electric source even solar panels if you have plenty<br>
 
of them. (anything over 3-4000 watts should be nice)<br>
 wind mills could also 
charge the batteries with free electricity<br>
 would be neat to have a charger 
adjustable for any voltage 12 volts or more<br>
 although the 200+ amps would 
be a challenge on the parts<br>
 Perhaps a 48-240 volts charger ?</p> 
<p>I am concerned about the high rpms for the motor, most gas or diesel motors
<br> max out about 5-6000 rpms, would not 13.000 rpms wear out the motor parts 
faster<br>
 what is the epected lifespan for a motor ? </p> 
<p>what if the dc-dc power supplies in the battery burns out ? thats the most 
likely unit to fail,<br>
 would that toast the whole battery pack or is it an 
easy swap to replace this ?<br>
 shorts in the dc-dc powers/diodes is the only 
real issue i see with the battery which would blow out the fuse<br>
 for a 
whole module, hopefully that can be repaired easy ?<br>
 can blown fuses in the 
battery be replaced easy ?<br>
 to me a design plus would be easy to change 
dc-dc powers and fuses for the module packs without having to dissect the whole 
pack.</p> 
<p>what is the cost of the battery since it needs replacing every few years ?
</p> 
<p>About electric race-cars they do exist, one used about 6000 cells wired in 
panels<br>
 that could be quickly yanked out and replaced. to make the guiness 
record they had<br>
 to finish 2 round-trips in under an hour and had to 
replace all the cells for each run</p>

<p>What i want from the Tesla:<br>
 1. A 'coaster switch'. that means being 
able to switch regen off/on.. i like to coast along in my golf tdi on the 
undulating surfaces. regen for me seems good when the hill im descending 
becomes necessary to use breaks....not to bothered the energy efficiency of the 
thing (anyways, it's all 'conserved' isn't it???), just seems practical in 
having a choice..</p> 
<p>2. Some clear real world testing videos of the Roadster. I am sick to death 
of watching ex-yuppies drive this thing in their driveways in downtown 
california shouting 'awesome' (ok, maybe i m jealous ;) ). I want people to, 
wait for it, actually GO TO places with the car, give an insight on real range, 
good/bad points about the car. A bit of good old down to earth analysis. 
YouTube is awash with videos, just not the ones i'm on about. I stand to be 
corrected, however. Links please!</p>

approval to break ground in the valley, I have to say this: nice as it would be 
to keep jobs in California, there's a whole industry going under in the Motor 
City, with workers, their families, children in school, etc and no jobs. And a 
manufacturing infrastructure ready to be retooled rather than re-invented 
completely here.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the new Roadster Sport doesn't have improved batteries, 
at least as an option. The existing batteries are 18650 form factor 2.2AH and 
although much more expensive, there are better batteries available such as
http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-cgi/jvcr13pz.cgi?E+BA+3+ACA4001+NCR1... 
which are Panasonic's NRC18650 rated at 2.9AH. Since they are the same form 
factor, building battery packs with these should be easy. The software for 
control and charging would have to be changed. For those who can afford it, 
this would offer a 31% increase in range.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Roy  8:58am | feb 1, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Follow-up on Panasonic NRC18650 batteries. In large quantities I found a 
web site that offers them at $5 each. I don't know Tesla's price on the 
existing 2.2AH versions but guess at more than $2, so an upgrade would cost 
6831 * $3 = $20498. $20k is a lot of money, but since we are talking about a 
$120k car...</p> 
<p>For next generation design, I think GM has it right with Lithium Manganese 
Polymer batteries from LG Chem. This battery type is also available from
http://www.electrovaya.com/ . LiMn polymer would offer about 50% increase in 
range, longer life and lower price. Another possibility is
http://www.superlatticepower.com/20080602/ . This one is harder to evaluate 
since I don't believe they are actually in production yet, but promise twice 
the range of LiMn polymer!</p>

<p>I've got very interrested on your concept from the very beginning, and 
despite the fact I am living in Mexico and there are no short term plans to 
distribute Tesla in Mexico, I still keep the dream to own one in the future, 
perhaps the outcome of the Whitestar project.</p> 
<p>One idea that could be implemented on the hard top version would be a 
flexible solar cell lamination, also on the drive train cover, at least the 
trial to find out how much more range it might bring on sunny days might be 
worth to spend the effort to implement it.</p>

<p>All those numbers are great, but what about up here in Minnesota. It gets 
-40 in the winter and having your car stop in between two towns is not a great 
way to start your day. How many miles up here?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  9:52am | feb 3, 2009

<p></p> 
<p>Phil Johnson: What unit? -40 decrees celcius or Fahrenheit? ....um forget 
that I asked, that -40 seems to be same in both scales.</p> 
<p>-40 is slightly too much for batteries to cope. Roadster battery system 
does have &quot;AC&quot; for batteries, so they wont get that cold as long as 
they have charge, but if you leave your car in that kind of temperature for 
several weeks without charging they would freeze, and then you would not be 
able to get anywhere. I think that cold batteries wouldn't even be able to 
recharge.</p> 
<p>OTOH because batteries need _cooling_ when car is driven cool temperature 
might actually increase range (but that means that passengers would then freeze 
to death :-P).</p>

<p>Formerly on long trips you used horses and when they were tired you changed 
them. Could you do the same thing with your Tesla either change after say 150 
miles to another Tesla or another battery or charge your Tesla fast (3-phase) 
at a chargingplace for an hour while taking a meal or just relax? You must not 
be in a hurry all life!<br>

<p>Thanks Timo for your quick response, but you did not answer my question. If 
I bought one, and I live up here in MN, and the winter is a normal one, and I 
use the car every other day, and I keep it in the attached garage, and keep an 
eye on the batt., and when I use it for up to 125 miles at a time, I would 
think that I would put the heater on max, will the car work well? If I am 
charging it after the 125 miles I charge it, how long will it take to charge? 
During the summer I normally put the A/C on max, so will it work then too?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  1:12pm | feb 5, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Phil Johnson.</p> 
<p>Yes it would (work well). Car has been tested in Sweden for cold climate 
and how well it behaves in slippery roads.</p> 
<p>Heater is (if I recall correctly) 3000W unit, but it wouldn't need to run 
with full power very long to heat air in small cabine, seat heaters less than 
100W and headlights on would consume another less than 100W so you would have 
reduced range, less than that promised 200 miles, but it should still be 
sufficient for 125 miles: battery pack is 53kWh battery, so car uses about 
53000*60/200 = approx 16kW / h so with all accessories running at full power 
you would be using about 17-19 kW /h instead. That gives you about 190-160 mile 
range. At summer that would be pretty much same situation, only cooling. Using 
these appliances is not out of performance, just range.</p> 
<p>125 miles is about 70% of full battery capacity, so with home recharging 
unit that would be approx two and half hour to recharge, or 37kW with about 90% 
efficiency from just about any outlet (depends of voltages and amps you can get 
out from it).</p>

<p>For me I want to see an Electric car that can do 600km in the depths of 
winter and the hieghts of summer. If I can get that I will have sufficient 
range to do all but my longest trips without recharging (I don't see charging 
stations in Algonquin Park or the Gov't dock near my relative's cottage 
appearing any time soon). The first electric car that can do that for less than 
$60,000 Canadian dollars will get my attention and its manufacturer will 
probably get my money.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Robert Horning  2:57pm | feb 10, 2009

<p></p> 
<p>Being a former resident of Minnesota, I would have to say that a rock solid 
endurance test would be to have one of Tesla's vehicles spend a winter in 
Minneapolis recharging in some sort of outdoor car port between trips. Yes, I 
realize that the Roadster spent some time traveling across Sweden and that it 
was &quot;tested&quot; in a cold climate, but that isn't the same thing here.
</p> 
<p>When temperatures get cold.... -40 degrees cold or more .... materials 
start to get brittle that were much more pliable at warmer temperatures. This 
isn't just plastics, although that is an issue. Metals seem much more likely to 
break, and any lubricants you have significantly start to change their 
characteristics, along with coolants and refrigerants. Conventional ICE 
vehicles are usually thrashed in environments like this where I've seen 
steering wheels fall apart, paint flake off, and things like door handles 
simply break just due to cold. It also thrashes the chemistry of most batteries 
(especially lead-acid batteries) and their ability to take a charge is 
significantly reduced at lower temperatures.</p> 
<p>The #1 problem I would see with an electric vehicle in a cold-weather 
climate like Minnesota would be significantly reduced driving range... both 
from trying to keep the cab warm and from the issues of having a decreased 
charge in the batteries. Some of this is based on the chemistry of the 
batteries being used, and some battery types might survive better at colder 
temperatures than others. Keep in mind that temperatures in Minneapolis also 
get over 100 Fahrenheit (+40 Celsius) during the summer months, so wide 
temperatures swings can be expected unless you keep your vehicle pampered in a 
climate-controlled garage, forcing a further limit on what kind of batteries 
you may want to use in that environment.</p> 
<p>No doubt that Tesla is trying to address cold-weather issues here, but 
there certainly is an issue here that can be addressed, and it will be 
interesting to see how the Roadster and other Tesla vehicles will behave when 
they finally do make it up to the North Star state.</p>

<p>It doesn't take long. Best batteries today already offer that range if used 
like batteries in Roadster battery pack are used (but they cost more). Soon you 
might get 1000km range with half the price if battery tech advances like it 
seems to do.</p> 
<p>I too require about 700-800 km range, or charging stations, before I 
seriously consider getting EV. Just small city car or expensive toy like 
Roadster is not enough to me.</p> 
<p>I don't like the idea of swappable batteries. At least not before someone 
can prove to me that it is viable system marketwise in long term (meaning 10 or 
more years). Especially when you can do pretty much that same cheaper with 
battery to battery charging where you transfer only electricity which is 
constant and non-changeable.</p>

<p>I have read articles that say that maybe you, or someone who wants to set 
up a business off of your car, by setting up a station that will change out the 
batt. and get you back on the road, on your trip. That way you can drive around 
on your trip and not have to wait every 200 miles while your batt. gets charged 
up. You will normally charge up at home, but if on a trip, you will change out 
the batt.<br>
 If the above is all true, do you have people ready to move on 
this idea?<br>
 Also, if you want a test site, we are retired and will 
volenteer to ues your car and drive all over Minnesota and test it out. I am a 
retired Sub Sailor who has done 3M and SUBSAFE. Sandie does paperwork even 
better then I do. We will be able to deal with all of the paperwork to show how

<p></p> 
<p>Hi everybody.</p> 
<p>I am also very excited about all electric cars. However I have some 
technical concerns about their future.</p> 
<p>Lets start with recharging. By my calculations, having battery packs more 
than 50-100 kw/h is not going to help a lot (even if better battery technology 
is developed later), and I think that way because imagine you have a car with 
200 kw/h battery pack. You want to charge it from home where you have a regular 
220v 35A limit. that means 7kw/h , which means you will need about 30h to 
recharge it. Even if you only top it up every day, that is not going to help 
you with the long distances. That's because when you draw your 200kw/h you will 
need a power station to refill it up on the way. and its not going to be fast 
either. Imagine this :</p> 
<p>Lets say you need 1sq/mm per KW of cable. So if you want to be able to 
recharge 200kw/h for 1h you will need 200sq/mm cable. That's more than 1&quot; 
diameter. You cant have such cable recharging your car, not to mention voltages 
and amperage needed to achieve that and it will not be safe.</p> 
<p>The only viable sizes I can imagine are probably no more than 30kw cable 
which will have about 1/4&quot; diameter. This will mean that you wont be able 
to recharge more than 30kw/h or 15kw/30 min. And who wants to spend more than 
1h on recharging station? I guess not a lot of people. That leads to the major 
problem with the electric cars. They have to work to lower the power needed for 
each mile somehow. Working on increasing battery packs will not help a lot.</p> 
<p>Current Tesla is using about 300W/h per mile with 70mph. which means about 
180miles with current battery pack. now if they somehow work to lower that to 
200W/h per mile with 70mph that will mean increasing range to 270-280miles. And 
also for every 1h of recharge you get 30kw/h or another 150 miles. So a 70kw 
battery pack with 1h additional stop during a long travel will top you out at 
500 miles. And even if you travel more you will do another 1-2 stops (you will 
have to anyway, you cant drive 12h without stops or its not very safe)</p> 
<p>So the BIG question. How to lower the power consumption. </p> 
<p>1. and most important Aerodynamics, Aerodynamics and Aerodynamics :).<br>
 
at 70mph air drag take more than half of the total power to drive the car. So 
one way of lowering that is to make the cars smaller. I think future electric 
cars will be small, minimalistic oriented, every inch will be used as much as 
possible. big saloon cars are probably not going to work. I imagine 4 seaters 
and even 2 seaters in a row (one behind another).</p> 
<p>Another ways to reduce air drag is use cameras for rear views. Dont know 
why this is not used widely even now.</p> 
<p>Electric cars have lot of potential to have flat floor which helps 
aerodinamics also.</p> 
<p>2. Drivetrain.<br>
 at 70mph drivetrain is the next biggest power consumer. 
It takes about 1/3 of the total power. Now I know Tesla is using gearbox with 1 
gear (newest drivetrain). The only reason for that is probably to have a 
conversion ration for the rpms for the electric motor.</p> 
<p>May be more efficient solution will be to have hub motors in each wheel or 
in 2 of the wheels. If they can make some low rpm high power electric motors 
that would be ideal. That will remove all driveshafts and gearboxes and etc and 
I know gearbox takes about 10% of the power alone.</p> 
<p>Even more ways to reduce power consumption will be developed of which I am 
sure but thats the way I think. That will also allow having much smaller 
battery pack and recharge more frequently, but the total price of the car will 
be much cheaper.</p> 
<p>Imagine a 4 seater small car, which have only 30kw/h battery pack, but 
weight 800kg. reaches about 200miles on the highway and about 300miles in the 
city. Takes 1h to recharge at power station, and costs $30 000. I really think 
that is possible with current technology. We just need to get creative. Think 
out of the box, and bring new solutions to old problems.</p> 
<p>I think electric companies like Tesla should take bigger risks and try to 
be a little more different in car design</p> 
<p>What do you guys think?</p> 
<p>Thanks in advance</p> 
<p>(Tesla's big fan)</p>

<p></p> 
<p>RawSteel, you have few facts wrong. First of all you don't need one feet 
cable for 200kW, you would, if you use low voltage and high amps. Normal 
household three-phase 100A connection cable is way smaller than that, and gives 
you about 40kW connection. What requires thick cables is amps, not volts, so if 
you increase volts you can have that same cable serving five times that 
wattage. 100A 2000V would be nearly same cable thickness except that you need 
better insulation. 200A 1000V makes that same thing but cable needs twice the 
copper. You only need to solve how to make 1000V connection safely. Because 
normal three-phase is already about 400 Volts that's not hard thing to do.</p> 
<p>200kWh battery pack would be useful, even for longer trips. Just calculate 
how long you need to drive to get it drained. That 200kWh equals about 800 mile 
range. With _average_ 60mph (which will almost never realize) that is 13 hour 
drive. Not many of us are willing to drive that long without stopping for food 
and sleep over. You could stop for food and charge say 50kW connection for a 
hour at about every 400 miles (6.30 hour drive) and extend you range to 1000 
miles, which gives you second hour stop at 800 miles which extends it further 
to 1200 miles. You time in the road is extended by two hours. 1200mil / 60 mph 
is 20 plus those two hours: 22 hours. You have only 24 hours a day, so I would 
be looking for nights sleep at that time. Eight hour sleep charging with low 
25kW (normal three-phase with 65A fuses) and you have full battery pack at the 
morning.</p> 
<p>Of course 200kWh is slightly overkill. 600mile range would be enough for 
almost all which would equal about 150kWh battery.</p> 
<p>You don't need power station, just battery to battery charging for high 
wattage charger. Changing batteries is worse. You would need that same amount 
of power to charge those swap-batteries / car served, and those car batteries 
cost a lot.</p> 
<p>About small and big cars. Efficiency calculations there need to include 
people carried. It is true that you lose a lot if you use big SUV to transport 
one person, but for energy usage it would be most efficient to use train or a 
bus full of people. Small cars will not solve traffic jams even that they would 
have lower cost to drive / car. Tesla model S with four people on board would 
be more energy efficient than Roadsters two even with only 75% range.</p> 
<p>You wont get much bigger drag with bigger car as long as it is 
aerodynamically shaped. It is the car frontal area times cars drag coefficient 
that matters, and car frontal area doesn't actually get much bigger for 
aerodynamic five-seater than it does to two-seater. In fact you might easily 
get lower drag coefficient with larger car, which in turn makes that difference 
even smaller. What _does_ increase is rolling resistance, but that has more to 
do with weight than with size. You can't get much smaller than Roadster for 
frontal area but you might be able to lower the drag coefficient quite a bit. 
Roadster does actually have quite a bit drag coefficient, it is far from 
perfect for that.</p> 
<p>Roadster does not have real gearbox. It does have one &quot;gear&quot; with 
very low energy consumption. Roadster drivetrain is pretty much optimal for a 
sportcar with single high power engine (hub-motors are worse for high-power 
car). For 4WD Range Rover -kind of car hub-motors would be _very_ nice, but for 
normal family car they are not that good. There are few very promising hub 
motor designs, but not good enough for now. At least that is what I have let 
people to tell me.</p> 
<p>(one tiny thing that bothers me in your writing and I just need to say it: 
it is &quot;kWh&quot;, not &quot;kW/h&quot;)</p>

<p>Hi Timo</p> 
<p>I agree with you on your points. I use kWh because I am lazy to type the / 
:D</p> 
<p>The 2 seaters I am talking about are cars with half the frontal area, and 
the 2 people sit one behind another. I think I mentioned it. There are already 
such designes that work. This will reduce the road area the vehicle takes (thus 
doubling city density) AND will half the air drag thus reaching much bigger 
ranges with same battery packs.</p> 
<p>The ultimate freakiness will be to design such 2 seater, BUT if you have 2 
of them to be able to connect them to make a 4 seater saloon car :P</p> 
<p>Imagine 3 wheel 2 seater. Put 2 of them next to each other. Raize the inner 
wheels, somehow connect them, give the control to one of the 2 seaters and 
voila, you get 4 seater saloon. Get back from vacation, split the thing and now 
mommy and daddy go to work separately ;)</p> 
<p>Thats still in the fantasy world but dont tell me its impossible :). I dont 
believe in this word.</p>

<p>RawSteel have you seen TopGear episode where they drove three-wheeled 
motorcycle and car mix? That looked like a lot of fun, and that would be just 
what you mean by two-seater with driver and passenger sitting not side by side 
but in line. That &quot;car&quot; was able to pivot like a motorcycle but had 
engine-part (one wheel) steady like a car.</p> 
<p>That could be very very good for EV (very low CdA). And also fun like I 
don't know what. Small and nimble and easy to park. Perfect city-car and fun in 
longer trips too (but only for one or max two passengers). Less drag and light 
construct means much lower Wh / km, which means it could use smaller batteries 
for same range which makes it cheaper.</p>

<p>I'd really, *really* like to see a &quot;poor weather range&quot; model. 
This is the Northeast. Assume that the headlights are on (due to rain or snow) 
constantly, and assume that the heater has to keep the car heated at 68 degrees 
Fahrenheit. (Assume the car starts out in a heated garage at that temperature, 
to simplify things.) Exterior temperature in the winter should be treated as 0 
degrees Fahrenheit to give a reasonable bad-case scenario. (How's the car's 
insulation? That would make a huge difference to the heating demand.)</p>

<p>The news that came out this past week said that the new tech. on batt. will 
allow you to re-charge your, Tesla Motors, battery in 5 minutes. . . from you 
pushing the car to the re-charge station, to cooking out of there at 140mph in 
under 5 minutes.<br>
 Now all we need is to set up places to re-charge. I think 
that every 200 miles of driving you pull over and re-charge for 5 minutes is 
faster then we are now with gas engines.<br>

<p>All the people I know do not have $30,000 to $150,000 dollars to spend on 
one of your cars. What today's working person needs is an electric bicycle. You 
both have the enginers and the ability to make this. True, it will not make you 
rich, but it will give the average working person a huge savings in 
transportation, stop him from poluting, and keep him healthy. I long to see all 
of us working people using electric bikes someday breathing better air. All it 
would take is just a little bit of everyone's time to get this done. I want to

<p>I am a high school student writing an electric car blog. I have several 
questions regarding electric cars and Tesla vehicles in particular.</p> 
<p>1. I would think wide tires on the Tesla Roadster would help with lateral 
acceleration, but have you calculated the efficiency/ range loss v. using 
narrower tires?</p> 
<p>2. What is the total weight and lifespan of the Roadster batteries and can 
they be recycled?</p> 
<p>3. I live in Maine and was wondering about the loss of battery power and 
range between freezing and -10 or -20 degrees F?</p> 
<p>4. If Tesla makes a car all-wheel drive, how much efficiency/range might be 
lost?</p> 
<p>5. Has Tesla tested the safety of these cars to passengers and first 
responders after they have been damaged in accidents, and how great is the risk 
of electrocution?</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Nathanael: I think headlights, heaters etc. don't cut your range much 
(maybe about 5%-10% max), but icy and wet road surface might do worse. That 
increases rolling resistance quite a bit and those Yokohama low resistance 
tires would be hazardous to use on icy road. Haven't calculated, but I bet 
someone has experimented that. You might lose something like 20% of max range 
in worst case.</p> 
<p>Liam Mullen: for point five: Tesla has fully crash-tested their cars, and 
their ESS cuts all power off in case of accident. Electrocution danger is 
probably less than burning in gasoline fire. Tesla Roadster has also been in 
real-life accidents (just look at google) and it turns out to protect their 
passengers very well.</p> 
<p>Larry Troutman: any wind turbines in front generate more wind resistance 
than they generate electricity, so those would be worse than useless. There is 
no free energy.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Roy  4:41pm | mrt 19, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Liam Mullen:<br>
 1. Tesla has special tires designed to have lower rolling 
resistance but still be wide enough to be &quot;sporty&quot;, after all it is a 
sports car.<br>
 2. The battery pack weighs almost 1000 lbs, and is designed to 
maintain performance for at least 160,000 miles. Recycling the batteries has 
already been arranged.http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=66<br>
 3. There 
would be some loss in range due to cold weather, mostly due to the requirement 
to heat the car and not because of efficiency loss in the battery itself. The 
battery has a built in heating/cooling system.
http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/?p=55<br>
 4. A 4-wheel drive version should 
actually be more efficient. Most of the braking energy is consumed by the front 
wheels, so the energy recovered can be higher in a front wheel drive electric 
vehicle. Tesla is rear only drive primarily to keep the cost down as a second 
motor and controller for the front would raise the price and also increase the 
weight slightly.<br>
 5. Tesla spent most of the first few years on battery 
safety, It is the only large battery pack certified for air travel in the world.

you think it will be more difficult to make hydrogen stations or battery

 4. Will this be a deciding factor in which car 
will be more broadly used?<br>
 5. Are you aware of any other possible fuels

<p>First question why don't you use Lithium-titanate batteries? Second 
question, why don't you use in-wheel motors? It would dramatically reduce some 
30%-40% power loss due to the need of mechanical transmission. By placing 
in-wheel motors you get rid of both extra weight and gear mechanical 
transmission power loss, thus increasing efficiency. Theoretically this would 
also extend range / charge. Also, the Lithium-titanate battery would 
drastically speed up the re-charge process.</p> 
<p>I don't know how long Lithium-titanate battery have been around, i suspect 
they've been around for some time, seeing as the company that makes them is 50 
years old. It may be that you were trying to save costs for the consumer. I 
think I heard a figure of the battery costing $100,000. If so I can readily see 
how the could be a sticking point.</p> 
<p>I know that in-wheel motors have been around for at least a century though. 
I could only assume that investors were wanting a very quick turn around from 
investment time to production time.</p>

<p>1) BEV definitely. Fuel cell cars need hydrogen distribution network and 
generatin hydrogen needs a lot of energy. There just is no point using fuel 
cell car when battery tech is showing near future advances of approx 1kWh/kg 
energy densities. Everybody already has electricity coming in their houses and 
generating electricity can be done in about billion different ways including in 
house solar cells.</p> 
<p>2) Don't understand question. Fuel cell cars are basically EV:s with 
pressurized hydrogen storage unit and fuel cell converting that hydrogen to 
electricity instead of battery.</p> 
<p>3) Battery charging is what can be done everywhere _NOW_. Fast charging 
batteries can be done nearly everywhere with negligible change in current grid 
infrastructure. Any roadside restaurant already has capability to charge BEV, 
all you need is to build connector for car. Hydrogen transport/storage 
infrastructure doesn't exist.</p> 
<p>For this point 3 I need to point out that current thinking of &quot;drive 
to station to fill up/charge cars&quot; is nearly non-existent in BEV world. 
Everybody is charging their cars in their homes, and charging stations are 
needed _only_ for long road trips. That charging can be made longer because 
that is not something that you need to _drive_ your car every week or so to 
fill up. You just take short (30-60min) break in driving and continue after 
eating or drinking cup of coffee.</p> 
<p>4) Yes and no, because charging stations are not even needed ever for 90+% 
of people driving BEV. For fuel cell cars you need it.</p> 
<p>5) bio-diesel ruin environment and lower biodiversity in areas where it is 
produced. Also EV is just simply superior in efficiency and performance.</p> 
<p>6) maybe about 10-15 years total. BEV is now reaching breakpoint in battery 
tech and after that ICE is just obsolete. Tesla is just first in market, soon 
there will many many more.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  5:25pm | mrt 23, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Kevin Cardinale: In-wheel motors may reduce transmission losses about 30% 
of less than 5% what it is now. So you end up with 3% energy loss instead of 
5%. No big deal. In-wheel motors are weaker and less efficient than Tesla one 
motor solution so you would actually lose some efficiency. Weight is also not a 
issue here, transmission + shafts don't weight much.</p> 
<p>What could be useful is in-wheel motors in front wheels and single motor in 
back. In that way you could get better regenerative braking energy recovery and 
add some power to car.</p> 
<p>Battery charging speed is really not limited by batteries, you can't fast 
charge 50+kWh battery pack very fast unless you have nuclear power plant at 
home. 50kWh needs with (un)usual 100A fuse 500V in order to charge it in a 
hour. Pretty much any modern battery can be charged in a hour. What should be 
looked at are energy density, safety and price of the batteries.</p>

<p>Liam Mullen:<br>
 My name is Roy Harvie, and I do not work for Tesla. I 
have been fascinated with Tesla for several years and have read literally every 
word on this web site. I have gone through a career change from electronic 
technologist to computer programmer.<br>
 1. Years ago the car makers spent a 
lot of time and money trying to create a viable battery system for cars. They 
failed. Eventually they turned their interest to fuel cells. The Oil companies 
encouraged this trend because they know that they will run out of oil and fuel 
cells have the advantage that they could keep their customers coming to the 
pumps to buy hydrogen. Tens of billions of dollars have been spent on fuel cell 
research, many more times than batteries. The last thing the oil companies want 
is to see customers charging their cars at home. Mean while battery research 
continued and great advances have been made. It's all about size weight and 
energy density, how far can you travel on a tank of hydrogen vs a battery pack? 
Which costs more? Battery break through s are happening almost daily now and is 
leaving the fuel cell camp in the dust. There is no question that batteries are 
much more efficient, about 95% vs 50% for fuel cells. Charge time for batteries 
can be about the same as fueling time for hydrogen. Battery swapping is a bad 
idea, why swap when you can charge just as quickly? In a few more years even 
die-hard fuel cell advocates will give up completely.<br>
 2. None.<br>
 3. Who 
cares? Both are losers.<br>
 4. When a low cost battery can take a car 800 
miles on a charge, the whole world will go electric. When you can charge over 
night and drive all day there will be no more need for gas or diesel vehicles.
<br> 5. No.<br>
 6. 10 years. I know most people talk about 20 to 40, but I 
think it will happen much faster. As soon as point 4 is reached, no one will 
buy anything else.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  12:13pm | mrt 24, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Roy, what range do you think is the breakpoint for EV making ICE obsolete? 
You mention 800 miles in your answer to Kevin.</p> 
<p>I think it is 600 miles. That means 10 hour drive with 60mph average speed. 
If you need to drive longer you need charging station, but I think for that 
half hour or even one hour charging for additional 200+ miles is fast enough 
(you take one hour brake in driving while car is charging). That would give you 
that 800 mile range with ~14 hour driving (14.20 to be exact).</p> 
<p>For 1kWh/kg energy density that 600 miles means something like 180-200kWh 
battery for ordinary sedan assuming ~300Wh/mile with 60mph average speed.</p> 
<p>That would weight then about that 180-200kg and take space about same as 
100liter gas tank or less. That is small enough that combined weight of battery 
+ engine + transmission + controlling units + cooling takes less space and 
weights less than ICE + transmission + gas tank.</p> 
<p>I think that long-haul truckers need charging stations that work as 
restaurants as well. Those can then be used with normal sedans too. When 
truckers change to BEV ICE is gone for good.</p>

<p>A few words about range and fast charging.</p> 
<p>1. Energy density and range - article about future batteries chemistry : 
http://www.batteriesdigest.com/lithium_air.htm. The theoretical energy density 
is 3.6 KWh / kg (while the practical estimations are 25% of this ). The 0.9 
KWh/ kg increases a Roadster range by 5 times to 1220 miles.</p> 
<p>2. Fast charging - fast charging of Roadster battery ( e.g. in 10 minutes ) 
requires a 300 KW. In case of several vehicles charging simultaneously the 
power required can be a problem for potential charging locations. But there are 
several technologies that can provide enough power by using some kind of 
accumulation, e.g. using flyweels as it used in this

<p>I am a Japanese very interested in pure EV.<br>
 Nowadays rechargeable 
battery technology is in great progress for to utilize in automobile industry.
<br> I think TESLA business model is perfectly correct where additional engine 
generator to feed electricity to the ESS is not adopted.<br>
 In near future 
bettery energy density will be far raised resulting unnecessity of additional 
complex structure of engine generator.<br>
 Recent news from Japanese Research 
Organization( AIST) is very interesting to me.<br>
 The news is telling that 
improved LITHIUM AIR CELL have been invented at AIST<br>
 of which energy 
density realized up to 50,000 mAh/g.<br>
 I think LITHIUM AIR CELL is the best 
way to be adopted in future TESLA CAR.</p>

<p>I was curious as to whether this technology could be used to power a vessel 
on the water. Say the vessel is large enough to carry two sets of batteries, 
(50 ft in length, with hydrofoil capacity,) and has a small generator on board 
to recharge the batteries not in use at the time. (For instance using the port 
batteries while the starboard batteries are being charged by the small 
generator, and vice versa.) Understandably there are different forces at work 
on water than on land, but is this conceivable to say building a 100 ft 
aluminum hulled vessel with the hydrofoil capability to moving swiftly over the 
water at speeds in excess of 86 knots with twin propulsion drives such as this, 
and how much larger would these motors have to be? With each motor attached to 
a dual propeller drive system such as say Volvo's IPS system has.</p>

<p>John S. Keller, battery and electric engine powered boats have been 
utilized for over 50 years now. For example all WW2 submarines used batteries 
when submerged and some of them were faster submerged than surfaced. Nuclear 
powered big ships are all electric. So batteries definitely can be used for 
boats. Electric motor is much smaller than similar power ICE, so engine size is 
not the limiting factor. Batteries are the thing that take space in electric 
boats, but like they do for cars they get smaller for boats too.</p> 
<p>Fukushima, could you post link to English page, please. My Japanese is a

<p>I just got my latest Nature volume and it had quite interesting article 
about magnetism that makes possible to build &quot;spin batteries&quot; that 
convert magnetic energy directly to electric energy.</p> 
<p>However that article is somewhat difficult to understand. It is like 
reading a script of new Star Trek movie where &quot;particle of a day saves the 
day&quot;. If someone here understands what is being said in there in plain 
English (meaning potential Wh/kg or W/kg or something like that) I would very 
much like to have translation for dummies.</p>

<p>Fukushima, can you confirm what I'm reading from that figure in page you 
linked:</p> 
<p>2,5V 50000mAh/g capacity? That is 125000Wh/kg or 125kWh/kg. For energy 
density that is unbelievable. For power density that is something I can 
understand, but for energy density that is like having one kilo laptop battery 
that could run 2000 hours straight. Or run a Tesla Roadster for 575 miles. 
There must be some error in that article, last time I read about lithium-air 
batteries theoretical max for them was 11kWh/kg.</p> 
<p>However, if that is true, then who cares about &quot;silicon nanowire&quot; 
batteries with 10 times the capacity of current batteries. That is 500 times 
capacity of current batteries. Put 100kg of those in a car and drive 50000 
miles without recharging.</p>

<p>Fukushima: Unfortunately I don't understand Japanese, and could not find 
the article listed in the English section. If it is very new, then maybe it 
just isn't translated yet. Lithium-Air batteries have long been known for their 
extremely high energy density, but only as primary batteries. That is not 
rechargeable. Is this new design rechargeable?</p> 
<p>Timo: I agree with your analysis exactly. I think a battery for a car would 
have to be rated at 800 miles, before a driver would go 600 without anxiety The 
Tesla is rated at 244 miles but practical range is about 190 so for this 
factor, 800 -&gt; 622 miles.</p>

<p>Timo: Possibly this link will help in understanding magnetic storage 
http://www.physorg.com/news156011642.html . Can't say that I follow it that 
well myself, but looks like nano-scale inductors can efficiently store and 
return large amounts of electricity. If you think in terms of large scale, an 
inductor, capacitor pair will resonate at a certain frequency and stores power 
while resonating. In practice the resistance in the circuit robs energy and the 
resonance will die to zero, but if it was made of super-conductors, it could 
store power for a long time.</p>

<p>My name is Stoian Kalniev. I have traveled all over the world and have 
family members working for the UN on sustainability and environmental projects. 
I have sent an e-mail to Tesla some months ago, but never received a reply.</p> 
<p>Because of my family, we are very knowledgeable about &quot;green 
tech&quot;, and currently I live in Thailand. The Asian market is the one that 
is expanding very rapidly and welcomes current and new car makers into the 
market, with promise of profits (i.e. India, China, Japan being a car lover 
country, etc.). However, these countries really need to see the benefits of 
both Tesla models. I have been going around import companies and asking them if 
they know about electric cars and they look very puzzled.</p> 
<p>You must enter this market if you want to finish your financial debts, 
reduce costs to make the vehicles cheaper<br>
 and make your product awareness 
and eventually conquer the vehicle industry. I also know that you get your 
batteries (maybe most of them) from the Thai market. If you open a factory 
here, you will drastically reduce your costs, allowing for a broader consumer 
range.</p> 
<p>There are more reasons for me to explain why you should enter this market. 
Please reply to me to know if this plan is sound, so that I may build my 
confidence of one day seeing a Tesla (the sweetest, hottest, most useful car on 
earth) with my own 2 eyes on these roads.</p>

<p>Fukushima's article seems to translate well enough with the Bable Fish to 
be able to at least get the basic gist of what is covered... it is a proposal 
for a new electrolyte and packaging format for a Lithium-ion battery. There are 
multiple markets for high energy density storage devices, so it seems 
reasonable to keep pushing the technology. Apparently this 
&quot;discovery&quot; is being announced next week at a Japanese energy 
conference, and this is sponsored in part by the Japanese government (the 
Japanese corporate culture is a bit weird compared to America/Europe on this 
point, and I think the sponsorship issue is lost in translation). It is the 
sort of incremental progress that I would expect for a battery manufacturer, 
but the amount of improvement obtained here seems a little too good to be true. 
Time will tell, although it looks like there are some people with some deep 
pockets to get this technology built if the theory holds true when scaled on a 
commercial basis.</p> 
<p>The Tesla strategy is to not be dumping the money into the battery 
technology. There are plenty of people who are working on the next generation 
of battery storage devices that it would be a waste of time and money for Tesla 
to gamble what few dollars it has into some crazy speculative energy storage 
technology. The standard Lithium-ion batteries exist today, and one of the 
genius moves by Tesla was to take off-the-shelf Li-ion batteries and put them 
into a production vehicle. That is the hard part.... where alternative storage 
devices would certainly be capable of being swapped in for what Tesla is 
already using.</p> 
<p> You want to prove your device works so well? Buy a production Tesla 
Roadster and put your cool little device or Mr. Fusion machine and demonstrate 
how you can travel from NYC to LA on a single charge. That would impress a 
whole lot of people. Heck, Los Angeles to Las Vegas and back would be 
impressive enough.</p>

<p>Congratulations to this blog and the Tesla-Motors-Company as well!</p> 
<p>For me as an average German citizen the current dicussions are a little 
astonishing.<br>
 While you are discussing range, duration, power, 
effectiveness of the Tesla car on a high technical level,I would be interested 
in<br>
 just everyday consumer experiences, although the roadster is not 
comparable to an avarage family car.</p> 
<p>For mass circulation of EV for the consumer is determing if he or she can 
drive to work an back, shopping or lunch in between maybe,<br>
 in city and on 
highway and country road as well without charging. And if one has a long 
distance trip, where to charge in between?<br>
 E.g. the way to work in Germany 
averages 1 jour drive, appr. 30 miles.<br>
 I tell this long story, because 
TODAY a german motor magazine (&quot;autobild&quot;:
http://www.autobild.de/artikel/tesla-model-s_875572.html)<br>
 published an 
article about new Tesla Model S, and I thougt immideately &quot;thats my next 
car!&quot; I came to know Tesla Motors maybe 2007,<br>
 and I loved the design 
of the roadster, but I find roadster impractical an too expensive. But the 
Model S seems to become a very useful car,<br>
 it is affordabe (for european 
standards) and nevertheless the design is stunning!</p> 
<p>I am displeased about the automobile industry, because they failed to 
develop innovative engines. Although the german brands<br>
 built very 
effective motors and (expensive) features like using brake energy for 
electricity, LED for headlights, start-stop engine and so on,<br>
 but 
alternative drive can hardly be found. Only LPG and Hybrid Drive (mostly in 
Japanese cars). So you find only few blogs<br>
 in Germany on topic. and there 
I find the belief that EVs still are small and ugly, or ineffective. People 
seem not to know (or don't<br>
 belive?!) that an EV can drive faster than 80 
mph, or longer than 2 hours! Therefore I sometimes get the impression the 
diffsion progress<br>
 is beeing constrained. Even the Tesla is unfamiliar to 
most people, or they smile about. The electric drive ist not taken serious in 
Europe, yet.<br>
 I would like to see Tesla go on further developing thir 
engine and maybe more models. And please launch your cars to Europe! (PS: why 
Munich?)</p>

<p>I love the extensive design that has gone into this. Recently I read 
something about the old steam engine cars. The article said that if they were 
designed today that with today's technology they could be very efficient. I 
thought to myself that TeslaMotors can extend the distance of their vehicle 
with a electric/steam hybrid. If done right, it might be able to make the car 
run indefinitely by having the steam engine power the car and charge the 
batteries. It seems that everyone is stuck in the Gas/Electric hybrids; maybe 
it's time to break the paradyme. Any thoughts on this?</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Ken: Tesla Motors decided not to make a &quot;plug-in&quot; hybrid, as 
their battery only design achieves a fairly good range, and with &quot;less 
than one hour&quot; charging could be practical even for long trips. If Tesla 
had decided to make a plug-in hybrid, there are many possible choices for the 
&quot;range extender&quot;, including standard piston engines, wankel engines, 
gas turbines, stirling engines, and steam. Of those options, steam is the least 
satisfactory, for automotive use steam isn't very efficient, consuming more 
fuel, and car radiators are too small to condense all the steam which means 
frequent stops for water fill-ups.</p> 
<p>Bruce: I imagine the air conditioning works very well. Like most hybrids on 
the road, the A/C is electrically powered and the compressor is completely 
sealed, making for a very reliable low maintenance system.</p>

<p>You are correct in your comment about GM battery not yet existing. I 
suspect the battery they are waiting for is the same technology Telsa is 
planning for the S model. There is no magic here that get over 5 times the 
range with a similar Lithium Ion technology. Smart engineering may get another 
10% to 20% or so. There are no dumb engineers in either camp. Maybe it is 
1000lbs of battery, roughly half the weight of the car that does it. I do not 
know what battery size Toyota, GM and others are planning. Does anyone know?</p>

<p>GM's Volt is planning to us a 375lb Battery pack yielding 16kwh for a 40 
mile range verses the Roadster's 1000lb 55kwh battery pack for a 244mile range.
</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  11:50am | apr 2, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Joe Simone, seems that you found out yourself how big GM Volt battery is. 
</p> 
<p>16kWh/375lbs = 16kWh/170kg = 94Wh/kg vs 53kWh/450kg = 117Wh/kg<br>
 16/53 = 
0,301<br>
 40/244 = 0,163</p> 
<p>Weaker energy density, and much weaker range probably because car itself 
has aerodynamically poor design and it has to drag along excess weight from 
internal combustion engine. With same design as Roadster it should have nearly 
80 mile range.</p> 
<p>I'd say that car is obsolete before it is even born.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Roy  6:59pm | apr 2, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Joe Simone: I didn't realize that the Volt battery pack weighed that much. 
An important factor is that the Roadster is a very small car and as the frontal 
area is significantly smaller, then it requires less energy to drive down the 
highway.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Joe Simone  7:43am | apr 4, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It is interesting to see what can be done if you optimize for an all 
electric vehicle as is the case of the Roadster. The VOLT and other plug in 
hybrids are talking of a range of about 40 miles after which the internal 
combustion engine kicks in, and they are burdened with the extra weigh of that 
engine a generator and a gas tank.</p> 
<p>You have to consider the logistics of how you replenish your charge after 
you exceed your vehicles range, since there are now no electrical recharging 
stations available. With a plugin hybrid you can always stop at a gas station. 
I believe the thinking is that the plug in hybrid has an unlimited range since 
there are gas station everywhere. If the average commute is 40 miles than all 
energy comes from the power grid. If the average commute is 80 miles half the 
energy comes from the power grid. So you have an unlimited range and an average 
saving of 50% to almost 100% on the use of gasoline. In the future it would be 
desirable to install recharging or battery swap stations. One has to consider 
the recharge time. It also may not be practicable to swap out a 1000 pound 
battery, and maybe you might prefer to keep your own battery (it may be newer).
</p> 
<p>One also has to consider that when we start getting a large amount of our 
vehicle power from the power grid we would have to substantially increase it 
capacity. Right now our electrical power is supplied from 50% coal burning, 20% 
natural gas and 20% Nuclear and the rest from hydro, oil, wind solar. Coal is 
very very dirty and clean burning coal is a long ways off. Nuclear energy would 
provide the cleanest form of almost unlimited electrical energy allowing us to 
charge our vehicles.</p>

<p>Why not use a magnetic transmission?</p> 
<p>We have developed a magnetic gearing and coupling system that works great. 
It has been in use in Australia for some years now.</p> 
<p>The gears never touch each other. They are 22% more efficient in 
transmitting power (compared to mechanical gears) and they never wear out. They 
run quietly and they can be dimensioned to slip at a given torque value. In 
some applications, such as boat transmissions, they can transmit power through

<p>I have read much of this blog but have not sees any discussion concerning 
the development of superconductive materials and how that might affect the 
viability equation. One can try to increase the energy available or try to 
reduce the energy consumed. Is Tesla motors looking into this subject?<br>
 
Bravo for all the hard work you've done thus far. All electric is the way to 
go. I am also glad to hear that EVs are viable in cold climates like Montreal.

<p>Joe Simone: Tesla is currently using a 54 Kwh LiIon battery pack with a 
cobalt oxide cathode with higher energy density and a lower cost per Kwh 
stored. The GM Volt will be using a smaller 16 Kwh LiIon battery pack with a 
manganese spinel cathode, the energy density is a little lower and the cost per 
Kwh stored is higher, but since the battery is a lot smaller the total cost is 
lower, but because it is smaller it must withstand 6 times more charging cycles 
to go the same distance as the Tesla Roadster, and it does.</p> 
<p>The result is that Tesla and GM are using radically different approaches 
for plug-in cars, and that requires different batteries.</p>

<p>Save the Auto industry?? DOES THE GOVERNMENT REALLY WANT TO END DEPENDENCE 
ON FOREIGN OIL?? I don't think so and I will tell you why, as well as, explain 
how simple it would be to accomplish these things and most of Obama's 
aspirations in one feld swoop. First, why does the government NOT want to end 
dependence on foreign oil?<br>
 Consumption would have to be reduced by 50%, 
which would cost the federal government and state governments hundreds of 
billions of dollars (a $10 a pack tax on cigarettes would not fly). Second, it 
would devastate the oil industry (not that anyone I know would care) and might 
have adverse effect on stock markets. Lastly, a lot of representatives have a 
personal interest in oil companies via campaign contributions or more direct 
interests.</p> 
<p>If the government did want to follow through on this and end our dependence 
on foreign oil, reinstate the U. S. auto industry as the global leader, reduce 
green house gases and smog to a level of insignificance, and alternative energy 
a household necessity equaling the inception of personal computers; the 
technology is here, and the time is right. I can see that if Obama accomplishes 
this, re-election would be a surety. Let me first say I am an engineer and the 
answer seems quite obvious. GM's answer to a &quot;Clean&quot; car is an 
undersized, underpowered, underwhelming EV called the &quot;Volt&quot;, unable 
to operate effectively at highway speeds with a range of 40 miles. That doesn't 
really compare to conventional cars, does it? Basically there might be a few 
fanatical tree huggers that would suffer with this piece of work so they can 
boast how small their footprint is. What if there was a car that would exceed 
the performance of conventional gas-driven vehicles, has a range of over 300 
miles, can be recharged in 45 minutes, or charged overnight FREE? Think of all 
the taxis in the U.S. having no emissions. A power plant capable of pulling 
large tractor-trailers. Personal cars which cost nothing to drive. No fuel 
cost, no maintenance costs associated with gas engines (oil changes, filters, 
tune-ups, etc.). No necessity for major infrastructure changes like with 
Hydrogen and other alternative energy solutions.<br>
 ALL THESE THINGS ALREADY 
EXSIST. There is a company called Tesla Motors, which has been making a car 
that does just that. Oh yeah, it is a high end sports car, a niche car, too 
expensive at $100,000 to be considered a viable replacement for use as a taxi. 
Now get your head out of your &quot;box&quot;. Let see, why does it cost so 
much? How many do they produce in a year? Very little. What value is built into 
this car (quality of components, implementation of technology, comfort 
amenities, etc.)? The highest available. Actually, all things considered, I 
imagine the efficiency of manufacturing for this car surpasses the Big Three. 
But consider what a car could be built for if was mass produced as a basic 
means of transportation. This company has designed a midsized four door to be 
produced for $50,000 and is asking the government to loan them $450 mil to help 
start up of its production. Again it is a car with all the comforts of a 
high-end luxury car. What if we didn't give them $450 mil ? What if we gave 
them $4.5 billion to step in and fit their power plant into GM vehicles? 
Without the need to change basic design of the vehicles, the effect would be 
unbelievable. Almost overnight (before the next primary) the U. S. Auto 
Industry would become the global leader in auto mfg., dependence on foreign oil 
would be a thing of the past, and our environmental &quot;footprint&quot; would 
be drastically reduced. Hmmm, seems like I recall rhetoric professing to do 
just that. There is also another company building a plant in Kentucky called 
ZAP that will build a comparable vehicle to the Chevy Equinox or Nissan Rogue 
for about the same money.</p> 
<p>Oh yeah, I said something about FREE fuel. Solar charging units can be 
designed and sold along with these cars so that average Joes can drive to and 
from work each day and pay nothing to recharge their cars. This will also make 
it more attractive for homeowners to opt for larger solar systems that would 
reduce or eliminate the use of commercial electricity in their home. I would 
say on average the annual cost for fuel and maintenance on autos exceeds $3000. 
I don't know how low the price can get on scaled down models, but I am certain 
it would be less than $25,000 and more likely less than $20,000. Over the life 
of the car it would almost pay for itself.<br>
 Fact:<br>
 The technology 
exists now.<br>
 The time to do this could not be better and may be critical 
not just economically but also to national security.<br>
 Most taxis could run 
all day without a charge, but if not industrial chargers can recharge in 45 
minutes.<br>
 U.S. auto makers would go from bloated aristocratic idiots, to 
global industry leaders.<br>
 Finally; our government would be focusing their 
attention (AND OUR MONEY) on a solution to a critical problem our nation faces, 
which would actually benefit the people who put them in office. How ironic is 
that! And it would probably be more of a &quot;Stimulation&quot; than $13 a 
week.<br>
 Also, if the powers that be could include leaders of magnetic motor 
technology in their development, we might see ranges of more than 3000 miles 
without charging. But they probably need to incorporate computer technology to 
manipulate magnetic angles and gaps to make them feasible.</p>

<p>Rad, can you give us more information about magnetic transmission? 
Transmission is the weak point of the Tesla (well, not so weak, but still).</p> 
<p>Single gear transmission forces limited acceleration in cost of top speed 
or other way around, if we will ever get true EV racing car we need either huge 
RPM range for engine, or transmission that can cope with huge torque electric 
engine generates as well as huge jumps in RPM between gear changes. Magnetic 
sounds good, because there is no physical contact between gears.</p> 
<p>Joe Simone, I agree that plugin hybrid has currently unlimited range and 
BEV doesn't, but when battery tech advances and we get over 600 mile range 
batteries then things change. That range allows car to be driven nearly all 
day, and then charging time doesn't matter so much because you charge at night. 
You don't need to charge fully during long road trips (over 600 / day trip) if 
you can get about 200 miles in a hour, IE in your lunch break. 480V / 200 A 
would give you 96kWh worth in a hour or about 300 miles more. That is not too 
much, I bet any pizzeria with electric ovens has that kind connection to grid.
</p> 
<p>Also you need to consider that these &quot;charging stations&quot; will not 
really be &quot;charging stations&quot; because it just isn't profitable. Too 
few cars charge in there. With 600 mile range over 90% of cars don't use those 
charging stations at all. All you would need is slow charging pole in the place 
you usually park your car to eliminate need of charging stations. (that is one 
thing why I am against battery swapping, you simply don't need it).</p> 
<p>Even that US electric grid is somewhat outdated it can handle increased 
load from EV:s. There was a conversation about that not so long ago here in 
Tesla blogs. As you said nuclear is pretty clean environmentally, but solar and 
geothermal where it is available would be much better because those are clean 
and renewable (well geothermal isn't really renewable, but it has nearly 
unlimited supply, much like Sun).</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like a conspiracy-theorist, I can't help but point 
out that the GM Volt does more to diminish the viability of the EV than it does 
to extend its development. After reading some of the articles on the GM-Volt 
website, it seems that GM is using the inefficient Volt as a last-ditch effort 
to highlight potential failings of the pure BEV. The Volt is laughable at best, 
and this blog provides the data to make even the most rigorous skeptic a 
believer...</p>

<p></p>  &nbsp;  Joe Simone  10:09am | apr 8, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here are some interesting facts regarding EV impact. The US consumes 
390Million (per EIA) gallons of gasoline a day. Gasoline is mainly use for 
automobile travel. One gallon of gasoline contains 37Kilowatt hours of energy. 
This translates to the US consuming 14 Billion kilowatt hour per day in the 
form of gasoline for automobile travel.</p> 
<p>Presently the US consumes (per EIA) about 10.5 Billion Kilowatts hours per 
day of electrical energy.</p> 
<p>For now let us ignore the efficiency of converting &ldquo;gasoline 
energy&rdquo; to miles traveled and the efficiency of charging EV batteries and 
transferring the stored energy to miles traveled. These efficiency differences 
can&rsquo;t skew the result that much. Now if we were to convert all gasoline 
consuming vehicles to battery operated vehicles we would need to draw another 
14 Billion kilowatt hours per day from the power grid or about 2.3 times more 
energy than we currently draw.</p> 
<p>Presently electrical power is supplied from 50% coal burning, 20% natural 
gas,20% Nuclear and 7% hydro and the rest from oil, wind and solar. I would 
guess the power grid probably has at about 50% extra capacity during off peak 
hours for charging EV batteries. That is almost what we need. However to 
generate full power from this underutilized equipment during off peak hours we 
will need to burn additional coal and natural gas. Nuclear plants probably have 
constant energy output. I do not think they shut them down during off peak 
hours. The question now is what is cleaner the coal burning portion of the 
electrical power grid used to charge the EV batteries or plain gasoline powered 
travel. . Electrical power generation from natural gas is relatively clean 
other than the CO2. Coal generates a lot of pollution and clean coal is a long 
way off:<br>
http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html<br>
 If 
that coal burning energy was converted over to nuclear there would be no 
question that the nuclear would be cleaner than gasoline powered travel. Wind 
and solar represent about 2% of the electrical power generated now. We have a 
long long way to go before it becomes a significant contributor.</p> 
<p>There are two issues one is pollution the other is energy independence. The 
US uses 20Million barrels of petroleum a day. It imports 12 Million barrels of 
petroleum a day or 60%. About 46% of the petroleum goes into gasoline after 
refining. I we would consume 40% of what we do now we would be energy 
independent and would not need to import petroleum. Of course the US petroleum 
reserve is finite and have to think of the future. If we cut automobile 
gasoline consumption by 40 % we do not address the other 54% (100-46) of the 
60% imported petroleum products derived from the refining process. Some of that 
is diesel fuel, heating oil, lubricants and other products.</p>

<p>Timo,</p> 
<p>We currently manufacture 100hp magnetic couplers for diesel 
generators...mostly to eliminate torsional and harmonic vibrations. We do have 
geared magnetic transmissions in use in Australia, they power solar pumps in 
remote locations. They are pretty efficient, in fact they are 99.9% efficient 
in transmitting power, that is 22% more efficient than gears. And they never 
break down.</p> 
<p>So far the geared transmissions are only used at around 1000 rpm - low 
power, but the magnet holders are only made out of plastic. If we would switch 
to alloy holders and stack the discs, we could easily increase the power 
transmitted. We have a magnetic gear box drawn on CAD and so far the static 
tests look good. There are a few tricks we could use too, these are still on 
the &quot;hand sketches&quot; stage but the way things are going I wouldn't be 
surprised if they would actually work.</p>

<p>Joe Simone, where did you get that 14billion kWh? If I calculate correctly 
that means that you have there in US 1.5 billion cars. Seems unlikely to me, 
even that you tend to have at least two cars / family, sometimes three. But I 
doubt that you have six cars per people.</p> 
<p>Typical commute is about 40miles / day. 40 miles is one sixth of Tesla 
Roadster range. Roadster has 54 kWh battery so that means typical daily commute 
takes about 9kWh, lets say 10kWh. 14 billion kWh divided by 10kWh gives 1.4 
billion cars. Should be about 250 million and even that figure is overkill, 
because some of the cars don't drive every day. More like 2/3 of them is used 
every day. I get 1.67 billion kWh. Your number is nearly one order of magnitude 
bigger. Decimal point error?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  CM  9:56pm | apr 11, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Joe Simone: There is a very serious flaw in your argument, it assumes that 
both gasoline engines and electric motors are equally efficient, and they most 
definitely are not. A car powered by an gasoline internal combustion engine has 
a &quot;pump to wheel&quot; efficiency of about 15%. A car powered by batteries 
and an electric motor has a &quot;plug to wheel&quot; efficiency of about 76%, 
making BEVs 5x more efficient than gassers. Note that those efficiency 
differences are the same regardless of size, whether it is a truck, a big SUV, 
a sports car, or a tiny sub-compact.</p> 
<p>So, switching from a transportation system using 14 billion Kwh worth of 
gasoline per day to all electric transports that uses 1/5 as much energy means 
it would use only 2.8 billion Kwh per day - a much smaller increase in 
electrical energy demand.</p> 
<p>Also, coal fired power plants can use efficiency boosting devices too large 
for automotive use, their efficiency is arount 45%. So, between the higher 
efficiency of generation, the higher efficiency of the electrical grid 
(compared to truck and railroad shipped gasoline) and the much higher 
efficiency of BEVs mean that the electric option is still cleaner than gassers 
even when powered by coal, and the increasing use of renewables will make BEVs 
ever cleaner.</p> 
<p>On another note, a recent Government energy report stated that California 
gets 20% of its electricity from renewables (wind, solar, geothermal), another 
20% from hydro, and only 20.1% from coal. There is considerable potential for 
renewables to replace coal for electricity generation.</p>

<p></p>  &nbsp;  Joe Simone  1:29pm | apr 14, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>CM: You are correct. I ignored efficiencies differences thinking they would 
be a wash. But looking at it more closely the roadster consumes 199wh per km or 
5 meters /wh. A gasoline powered auto getting 25 miles per gallon with 37 kwh 
per gallon of gas yields 1.1 meters/wh. That is the 5 to one difference you 
claimed. It indicates the need for only 2.8 billion Kwh per day of additional 
energy off the present 10.5 billion Kwh per day grid. That is a very 
encouraging result and an endorsement for the future of electric powered 
vehicles. Thank you for the correction.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, is Tesla considering the possibility of 
incorporating solar power generation components? What interests me in 
particular are the advances in dye based photovoltaic systems such as those 
being demonstrated by Dyesol. I have read a few articles regarding the 
development of transparent solar cells for use as replacement windows (see:
http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/04/14/dyesol-solar-windows/). For safety reasons, 
I'm sure such technology would not be suitable for use on side or rear windows 
nor windshields, but the Model S prototype features a sunroof that has a fair 
bit of real estate. Then there is the solar paint idea... but I'm not sure I 
would sacrifice the visual appeal of a nice paint job for a few extra watts of 
power. I'd have to see a sample first.</p>

<p>Jack,</p> 
<p>If the power system in the Roadster is anything like the battery power 
systems I have worked on in the past, then it is not possible to discharge the 
batteries (driving, using electronics, etc) and charge them at the same time. 
The current used to charge the batteries flows on the same conductors used to 
discharge them, so the net current results in discharge OR charge. However, 
solar panels might be able to provide parallel current, thus reducing the 
energy demand from the batteries and effectively increasing range.</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I'm not as knowledgeable as I would like to be when it comes to the 
technology of our future electric cars, but I was wondering if there is any 
talk about maybe using different conductors for charging and discharging. I 
have a couple of good ideas that would basically make so much energy, you might 
be able to have a surplus. I'm not sure if it is even possible to make a car 
charge while discharging, but if it is let me know!</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Roy  3:09pm | apr 20, 2009

<p>The subject of solar cells comes up frequently. Tesla is correct in stating 
that the return on investment for solar cells on the car is almost zero. They 
recommend you put solar cells on your house or garage and use that to charge 
the car. They have a working agreement with SolarCity and there is a link in 
the left hand column.</p> 
<p>Matthew: Hybrids like the Volt do generate electricity to charge the 
battery while the electric motor draws power. To put a fine line on it, it does 
not charge and discharge simultaneously, but generated power goes directly to 
the electric motor and any extra charges the battery. If the demand is greater 
than the generated power, then all generated power goes to the electric motor 
plus required extra discharged from the battery. I cannot conceive of any way 
to improve on this system. Let's say you have two batteries, and the generator 
charges one while the electric motor uses the other. This would be less 
efficient than the standard arrangement as there are energy losses in charging 
and discharging the battery. Read Something for Nothing in

<p>Great work! I believe that this is the future. I'll admit I haven't read 
all of the posts so you may have covered this already. I've always been 
interested in the use of the energy produced by the wheels. You essentially 
have four generators producing energy at all times. You could draw from the 
wheels power as well as the battery delivering the necessary power at the 
relative speed. I would imagine the higher the speed the lower the draw on the 
battery. With a unique gearing system you may even be able to generate enough 
power with the wheel generators at relative speeds to deliver enough power , 
separate from battery power, to sustain drive indefinitely.</p> 
<p> I also like the idea of a hood scope or grill scope which would turn a 
wind generator under the hood. This generator or numerous ones could power 
accessories saving precious battery power.</p>

<p>Actual Trip time:<br>
 I would like to see a graph posted showing the time 
it takes to travel a given distance with the 45 minute charges included. For 
example, it takes x amount of hours at 80 miles per hour to travel 500 miles 
because the are 3 charges required, vs x amount of hours at 55 miles per hour

<p>Jack: Those are the exact same 2 ideas that I was thinking about! I would 
think using hub generators would be a great way to drive for &quot;free&quot;

since there would no longer be people paying taxes for gasoline which is what 
is used to repair the roads now.</p>

<p>Andrew May: Wheels don't produce energy, but they can be connected to a 
generator that converts the forward momentum of the car into electricity, 
slowing the car down. That's how regenerative braking works. Tesla Motors has a 
clever way of converting the electric motor into a generator whenever the car 
needs to slow down, and that partially recharges the battery. However, it just 
wouldn't do to try and drive with the regenerative brakes on all the time!</p> 
<p>As for the &quot;hood scoop wind generator&quot; idea, its been proposed 
hundreds of times before. You've underestimated the amount of drag it would 
produce and you've overestimated the amount of electricity a tiny wind turbine 
can produce. The increased drag would drain away more power than the wind 
turbine could produce, reducing the driving range. Sorry, its a step backwards. 
Much better to put the wind turbine on a tower at a windy site where &quot;wind 
drag&quot; doesn't matter.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  9:41pm | apr 22, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Andrew May, any wheel-mounted generator works like brakes. Electric energy 
is not free, and generator is just engine working another direction, so all 
electricity it generates slows car down until it does not move. Same with grill 
-scope mounted wind generators. Those cause air drag which negates the 
electricity generating effect entirely and then some.</p> 
<p>And because there are no 100% efficient generators/gears/wires etc. you end 
up losing power.</p> 
<p>Wheel-mounted generators can be used to regenerate energy while braking, 
that's all. For rear wheels Roadster already does that, and I believe Type S in 
4WD -configuration does that with front wheels as well. You still lose power. 
Overall efficiency making car move is something like 80% so you lose 20% in 
making car move and another 20% from generated energy so net gain is only 64% 
(20% out of 80% is 16%). Perpetual machine would require 100% gain or more.</p>

<p>This company is exactly what the America needs.What I have read ,I hope to 
see this company go far.My question to the engineers is this; is there a way to 
connect a generator to the main motor so when the battery charge reads (a) 
certain volt(s), the circut to the generator closes starting the generator and 
opens the circut between the battery and the motor closing the circut between 
the generator and the battery? With the generator producing electricity sending 
it to the battery,can the motor in turn be used to produce its own power for a 
time or receive power from the generator.I did use generator and not alternator 
because I understand that this is direct current power.Thank you and may your 
success continue to grow.</p>

<p>I just skimmed through the site this evening, if this was already 
discussed, forgive me. This is something that I thought was discussed a few 
years back in designing the batteries for the roadster. If the battery was 
removable like a heafty suit case (or as 3 or 4 smaller modular suitcases) that 
you could stop after 200+ miles at a location (set up agreements with a chain 
of service stations of truck stops) and pay a nominal fee to have the ESS 
swapped out for a fresh one and continue on down the road.</p> 
<p>I thought i remember the idea that the battery cells would be owned by 
Tesla and exchanged toward the end of their life (treated kind of like a 5yr 
lease, $1000/yr. The first 5yrs comes with the purchase and come in for 5yr 
service which will include pulling and testing each cell and replacing the ones 
that are showing signs of failing, and pay the $5k for each 5yrs.) Wouldn't 
that work out with this swap out service? The services would be tracked 
electrically, I expect the cells each have serial #s and each cell is entered 
into the database when they are installed, and since you are paying for a 5yrs 
of battery life it doesn't matter which ESS you have at the end of the time. It 
would kind of be like taking and exchanging your empty propane tank for a full 
tank, you pay more than having yours refilled but it saves time. In this case 
it would extend your range, to almost unlimited or atleast daytime hours if you 
can't find 24hr locations that can perform the service, once a full network of 
locations is established (as long as the proceedure can be done by most service 
techs).</p> 
<p>I am not sure this how feasible it would be in looking at the ESS and not 
knowing the way it is installed. As it is half the total weight of the car in 
one piece it might be a bit of a problem. But I am thinking of places like a 
Tire shop [i would say the name but I don't want to try to advertise on your 
site.. Les Schwab because they are are a full service repair shop and handle 
heavy equipment tires, also they are all over the west coast now. please 
deleted this bracketed portion for posting] that hadles heavy equipment tires, 
they would have no problem with a lightweight item of only 1/2 ton. Maybe it is 
something to think about for the future design. It really would be nice if you 
could pull up to a ESS swap station, go inside and pay for a battery swapout 
and come back out and drive away that would give the marketability a huge 
boost, range is always the complaint that people give as to why EV aren't 
feasible. It wouldn't require a large number of locations, it would mostly be 
for travelers. I am in Northern California; I am thinking one station along 
Interstate 80 coming into West Sacramento from SF. Then one along 80 up around 
Roseville or Rocklin and one along 50 east of Sac maybe Folsoml. Then maybe 
Reno, South Lake Tahoe, Carson City. Another near 580 and 5 intersection, then 
south, Fresno, Bakersfield... just place them at strategic locations that are 
easily accesable from the Interstates. South of San Jose along 101.. Monterey.. 
etc. North of SF then Willits Eureka. With about 25 locations you could get to 
most anywhere in California with a fresh battery. Then add stations along the 
way to Vegas from LA, and Bakersfield to Vegas!</p> 
<p>This leads me to the question that has been nagging me for years now. How 
significant is the effect of grades on battery life? If you attempt to drive 
over Donner Summit to Reno how far would you get? I would be interested to see 
the wh/mile and range/speed graphs on 2%, 5% and 7% grades. I am assuming that 
the graphs posted are all at 0% grade. I know it will drop but I am burning to 
see what the numbers are. I know that driving from Reno to Sacramento uses much 
less fuel than going from Sacramento to Reno because of the elevation 
difference. Much of the way from the summit down to Sacramento you normally use 
brakes, in the Roadster I wonder if you would end up with more of a charge by 
the time you reached Sacramento than when you left the summit with. The only 
item that will change significantly is the drivetrain power consumption. 
Aerodynamics and tire draws wont be effected significantly. A load test on a 
dyno, setting the load to simulate the added wieght effect of climbing the 
grade should give a pretty close estimate. Maybe soon we will will start seeing 
some real world experiences posted in the blog. Also how much is the additional 
draw from driving at night? How much does that add to the ancillary draw? And 
running the heater and A/C on max? Defroster data should work for that if the 
A/C is used to remove moisture from the cabin. It would be nice to see a graph 
showing those effects too.</p> 
<p>The other option is quick charging stations, pull up to the quick charge at 
a location and plug in. I think most places would allow you to install a 
charging station probably without any monthly fee, just for the good PR and 
ability to advertise they have one, the bigger problem would be with potential 
vandalism; they will have to be locked up during non-business hours. You can 
walk to a restaurant for lunch or do a bit of shopping and come back about an 
hour later to most of a charge. It would still be a selling point.</p> 
<p>This might be addessed on the site already, again I apologise if I am 
repeating information already offered. I am wondering why the plug couldn't fit 
a standard 220 outlet? Many people have 220 outlets in their garages and in 
their laundry rooms. I guess the issue that I see is that if you plan on moving 
and the charging station is hard wired into your house you need an electrician 
to come and remove it and re-install it at a new site. If I could simply plug 
the charging station into a standard 220 outlet on a 100 amp breaker, it would 
simplify things. It could still be mounted on a wall, just with the cord 
plugged into the side or bottom of it. Why not have the charging station fit 
with a 220 outlet that can be used instead of having it hard wired in? Is there 
a reason that it cannot? Other than some people might try and run a long 
extension cord to the charger and burn the unit up. I am also curious, are many 
people using the portable chargers? I would like to see what kind of 
experiences people are having using them.</p> 
<p>Thank you to all who have put in so much of yourselves into Tesla Motors. I 
had thought of trying to work for Tesla but I don't see how I can afford to

<p>Hello Gentlemen;<br>
 I love your work, I hope for a day I can afford your 
product. I write this today because I have had ideas that I can not afford to 
pursue myself. I just wish to give to the society in which I live. It may have 
intellectual property value. My perception of the current issues related to 
your type of products is the use time is quicker than the charge time. I have 
seen and try to keep up with the chemical and electrical battery side of 
leading science but find it could be awhile. I have a varied background and do 
not have the credentials of anyone I have read on here. The varied background 
crosses several industries and as a result has lead to some crossover thinking.
<br> I believe using the Bernulli principle in combination with permanent 
magnet motor/generator placed in a vehicle where the accelerated air was then 
applied to the generator via helicopter blading that had been calculated to 
offset the weight of the generator and exit the air into the vertical that it 
would not add exceesive drag.Also with simple helicopter blading (i.e. maintain 
blades attached to the generator in autorotative condition and constant rpm via 
pitch control ) you can have an onboard charging system that would at the very 
least extend your range further.I hope your engineers will review this idea. 
The lift equation can be used to calculate blade size to offset the permanent 
magnet alternator/generator weight. Your design easily would take on wind scoop 
to venturi portion of the system.An electrical engineer can do the math on what 
the neodymium magnets spinning all the time can do for you. Also if you changed 
that a bit more and ran with a Halbach array for the magnets in the generator 
you may not have to wait on the battery science. I wish you guys the best and I 
am sorry our on government is sabotaging your business bailing out the old 
school guys. Have a great day. Hampton Price</p>

<p>I like what I see so I am asking these questions. If wind turbines can 
generate electricity, then why can't an automobile be designed that adapts that 
principal? Batteries need to be recharged. If a company like yours designed a 
vehicle that adapted wind turbines in the vehicle to re-energize the batteries 
as you drive then there would be no need for gasoline or grid. Adapt a battery 
pack that runs the vehicle and one that stores and transfers energy to the 
other batteries as you drive. Jet engines draw air into the intake. If the 
grill of a vehicle were to designed to bring air into the vehicle as you drive 
to run a turbine and generate energy to a back up battery pack, then that 
battery pack could be used as a reserve. Hence, after the energy in one battery 
pack gets low, just switch to the other and put the first battery pack on the 
turbine. I'm just guessing here but the theory sounds possible.</p> 
<p>Thank You,</p> 
<p>Dennis McCuneo</p> 
<p>P.S. If not a wind turbine, then why not utilize the wheels to generate 
that ebergy to booster a second battery pack?</p>

<p>Curt Helland, Tesla is continuously checking new technologies for batteries 
and selects what is best compromise between price, reliability and energy 
density. They might not be using best batteries tech-wise but they are using a 
very good compromise.</p> 
<p>Those MIT Genshock shocks generate very little energy. They generate some, 
but to keep things simple, I'd prefer reliable and cheap ordinary shocks. I 
think best way to &quot;charge while driving&quot; would be using inductive 
coils under pavement (another MIT/Intel invention allows wireless energy 
transfer up to 75% efficiency to one meter distance). Unfortunately this would 
also increase road maintenance costs a lot, and it brings up a question how to 
determine who charges his/her car and how much. Also because car is using quite 
a bit energy while driven it might be that those coils might not be viable 
source of energy. Roadster uses 13-14kW at highway speeds. That is quite a lot 
of energy to transfer wirelessly.</p>

<p>To all that suggest wind generators to get indefinite range, just try it 
yourself. Build a toy car with electric engine and windmill in top of it. Spin 
that windmill blade with your hand to get initial boost to electric engine and 
see yourself how far your car goes.</p> 
<p>We can't create energy any more than we can destroy it. We can ONLY convert 
it to different forms. In batteries energy is in electric potential. There that 
potential it is transferred to electric motor which converts electricity thru 
magnetism to kinetic energy. Windmill converts kinetic energy to electricity, 
but *there are always losses* NEVER opposite. Otherwise you are talking about 
perpetual motion machine. IT JUST ISN'T POSSIBLE. You could get some energy 
from actual *wind* (not that air displacement that car causes when it moves 
like people here suggests) using sails if wind is blowing from behind, but I 
don't think you want sails in fast sportcar.</p> 
<p>So please just stop it.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  3:12pm | apr 27, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Lets explain a bit further why windmill in car can't work.</p> 
<p>As I in previous message wrote we can't create energy we can only convert 
it.</p> 
<p>Where does energy windmill generates come from? From air movement. In other 
words windmill slows that air movement in order to generate energy, and that 
generates air drag.</p> 
<p>Where does that air movement come from? Air displacement from car movement, 
which in other words is air drag. Car makes work in order to overcome that air 
displacement.</p> 
<p>What that windmill would actually do is generate electricity from work done 
by the car, and as so causes more work for car to do. With 100% efficiency in 
energy conversions you end up +- zero gain, but because there is always losses 
in energy conversions you end up losing more than you gain.</p> 
<p>So, at best you could get absolutely nothing, but in practice you would end 
up losing energy.</p> 
<p>AND, in order to generate as much energy as car uses you would have to 
capture *entire airflow* car causes when it moves thru air and then some, 
because you wouldn't be capturing energy used to overcome rolling resistances 
and ancillary losses.</p>

<p>I had an idea. If you put generators around the axles you could generate 
some electricity when you accelerate. You would simply be turning some of the 
mechanicle power of the car into electricity. Im not sure if this would be good 
enough to keep a batery charged but it could help.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Hampton Price: Aside from the safety and legal aspects of having a 
helicopter roter (actually, an &quot;autogiro&quot;) on the roof of the car, it 
still creates more losses due to drag than the electricity it could generate. 
Any lift generated would also create additional drag, and could possibly cause 
handling and stability problems. Permenent magnet motors are no more efficient 
than the induction motor Tesla is using, but they are more expensive. Halbach 
arrays are great on special tracks for mag-lev vehicles, but are useless for 
road vehicles.</p> 
<p>Dennis McCuneo: Yes, wind turbines generate electricity, but it takes a 
really big wind turbine to generate a substantial amount of electricity. One 
small enough to fit on a car wouldn't do much. Worse, it creates air drag, 
which is why wind turbines have to be mounted on sturdy towers. That drag 
forces the drive motor to use more electricity, more than the tiny turbine can 
produce. Sorry, it would actually reduce range.</p> 
<p>Nathan: Generators convert mechanical effort into electical effort, so your 
generator idea would slow the car down just like applying the brakes, that's 
what &quot;regenerative braking&quot; is. That's great when you're trying to 
slow down, but really bad news when you're trying to accelerate! Sorry, 
generators and motors are not 100% efficient, so having your drive motor 
fighting to accelerate the car against the regenerative brakes would only 
reduce the range - and make for really lousy performance!</p>

illiteracy does seem to be an ongoing problem.</p>

<p>Eliuth, you were misinformed. Tesla Motors once had considered making a 
&quot;gas electric car&quot;, but after seeing the improvements in batteries 
and all the problems inherent to gas engines, they decided to continue 
developing pure battery electric cars only. Their planned Model S has no 
infernal combustion engine and no gas tank, which leaves room for luggage both 
in front and in back! The base Model S should have a 165 mile range per charge, 
but extra batteries can be added under the floor to increase range up to 300 
miles, and they can be fast charged in about an hour or &quot;swapped&quot; for 
fully charged packs for drivers in a hurry. That's a better solution than a 
&quot;range extender&quot; engine.</p> 
<p>Tesla Motors is not considering compressed air engines, either, the energy 
density of compressed air is far less than the batteries Tesla is using, and 
the efficiency is lower. Compressed air engines might be suitable for short 
range slow speed vehicles, but a long range &quot;air car&quot; would be mostly 
air tank! It would be a very bad choice for an EV &quot;range extender&quot; 
generator, the air tank would be larger than the batteries but would hold less 
energy. Better to use extra batteries.</p> 
<p>fabian alt: Have you considered reading the previous posts? Tesla Motors 
has already figured out how to switch the motor to be a generator, the car does 
that only when the driver wants to slow down. It's called &quot;regenerative 
braking&quot;. It just doesn't make any sense to try and drive around with the 
(regenerative) brakes on!</p>

<p>I notice when I am in the mountains, I have a lot of up hill driving, and 
then a lot of down hill driving. When you go up hill, you would use the normal 
battery power to move the car. While going down hill, because of the inertia of 
the car going down, by energizing two DC Generators, one in each wheel, you 
would be using the inertia of the car going down hill to charge the batteries. 
This is a little like regenerative breaking, where you generate electricity 
when you put on the break and slow down, but different in that you use the 
inertia of the downward pull of the car as your car travels down hill for 1/2 
an hour to an hour, to charge your battery pack, thus use the generated power 
going down hill, without use of breaking, to charge. Existing cruise control 
devises can be put in place on your downward direction to control your speed, 
as so you don't have to ride the breaks all the time. When the car leveled out, 
those generators would be electronicly turned off, and they would be in free 
spin mode, creating little or no drag on the battery system, other than the 
actual weight difference of the casing of the aluminum generators, and 
windings. The more passenger weight you have in the car, the more electricity 
generated on your down hill quest. With this type system, you still would have 
to charge on occasion, but less often. If you took a short straight freeway to 
the top of a hill where you work, and then took the lazy windy downhill road 
home, that took you 1/2 hour longer, you may never have to charge your car, or 
at least less often. By utilizing a 240 or 480 volt generator, you would 
recharge the batteries quicker than using a 120 volt system. Your batteries are 
literally in charge mode as you coasted down hill, and would not be used but 
only charged by the inertia. This is a little like an electric light, attached 
to your wheel on a bicycle. While you are pumping along on the level you need 
to use the battery or your legs to pump the bike, but the light is on all the 
time. When you go down hill, you no longer have to pump, but just coast for 
miles ,and the light works all the way down the hill, using the inertia of the 
weight of the bicycle to generate electricity to propel you along, and light 
the way. If you have ever ridden a 10 speed bicycle down the Feather River 
Canyon in the Sierra's, you are shocked that you can go almost all the way by 
coasting. Can you imagine how much power can be generated on that down hill 
ride, that could get you farther on your way when you get to the bottom. This 
is not an example of free energizing, but of using the inertia of the weight of 
the vehicle to run a charging system to increase your distance between charge.

higher energy density and a lower cost per Kwh stored. The GM Volt will be 
using a smaller 16 Kwh LiIon battery pack with a manganese spinel cathode, the 
energy density is a little lower and the cost per Kwh stored is higher, but 
since the battery is a lot smaller the total cost is lower, but because it is 
smaller it must withstand 6 times more charging cycles to go the same distance 
as the Tesla Roadster, and it does.<br>
 The result is that Tesla and GM are

<p>Ronald Wose, what you describe is basically regenerative braking which 
Tesla already has. Tesla approach is not using actual brakes for regenerative 
braking, but &quot;engine brake&quot;, so if you lift your foot from the 
gas-pedal you switch on regenerative braking. IOW this behavior you suggest is

<p>Type S in 4WD configuration might be even better in that, because it can 
use more active braking with front-wheels too. I wonder if they have 
regenerative braking also from brake-pedal in Type S, and ordinary friction 
brakes are used only with very high deacceleration needs (kind of emergency 
brakes).</p>

<p>First of all taking a straight freeway to work and then taking a downhill 
run to go back home is not possible. The straight freeway must be going uphill 
from home however gradual in order to go downhill to go back home. In going to 
work you are gaining potential energy by going uphill. The battery is being 
drained to provide this potential energy as well as surmounting the friction 
and wind resistance of the travel. In going home downhill this potential energy 
can be tapped to charge the battery to recoup a portion of the energy used to 
provide the potential energy gotten by going uphill to work. A portion of this 
potential energy will also have to be used in surmounting the friction and wind 
resistance of the downhill run. There is no net gain in going uphill and then 
downhill.</p>

<p>I wonder how much range improvement you could achieve by adopting solar 
cells on the surfaces, and in particular by fitting the car with energy 
recovering suspensions (from induction coils) from the continuous up and down 
movement while driving. They could also be used to improve the handling at high 
speeds (like using adapted Bose suspensions).<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Edmund, It is possible to use thin film solar panels in car, but energy 
gain from those is minimal and cost is high. Even at best case you would be 
getting something like 1000W/m^2, and thin film solar cells have about 15% 
conversion rate, so with 3m^2 of panels in car you could get max 3*1000*0.15 = 
450 W. That is the best case. In practice you would get way less than that. 
Roadster uses 15kW at 60mph, so you would give it less than 10% increase in 
expense of high price paint job. In practice less than 5%.</p> 
<p>It would be better just to put better batteries in car. At the roof of 
garage that thin-film solar cell would serve better purpose.</p> 
<p>I have sometimes thought about very large folded thin-film solar cell in 
car trunk that you could unfold as a kind of tent for that car when you park 
your car for a longer times in places where there are no electric plugs where 
you could charge your car. That would cost quite a lot, but could be useful to 
get your car charged &quot;on road&quot;. Even if it could give only one kW of 
power you could get few miles out of it during a day. 10 hours would give you 
about 50 miles worth of charge.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Apparently mathematical part of my brain is on vacation.</p> 
<p>450W out of 15000W is 3% and that would be less in practice.</p> 
<p>To MrClean: Energy you could get from energy recovering suspension is at 
max tiny part of rolling resistance loss, so in case of Roadster you could get 
tiny part of 25%. My guess is that it would be similar to solar panels: not 
useful amount. On the other hand, if they are better than ordinary suspension 
_as a suspension_ then it might be worth using them.</p>

<p>This company will do much better in EU (or Japan) than in USA because of 
smaller distances between cities and gasoline price. Next good think for Tesla 
in EU is 220-240W power supply system (hopefully one day US will switch on this 
system too). Also EU people like small cars because of chronic lack of parking 
space and presence of narrow streets. From experience a can say that Europeans 
are concerned for environment more than Americans. (Californians developed 
strong environmentalist movement, but rest of US is really ecological 
&quot;retarded&quot;;-( ).<br>
 However, it is puzzling why the EV concepts 
never get life in Japan, EU or even Israel (even these countries have more 
reasons for EV development than we are, at still all aspiration to do so were 
immediately stopped in begging of development).<br>
 I have seen many 
improvisations in the third world countries in the term of developing the 
alternative source for car powering. Probably the most successful is use of bio 
diesel in Brazil, alcohol in Cuba and primitive models of EV buses in India.<br>
 Natural gas is getting very popular in EU lately. It is cheaper and more 
environmental friendly than diesel and gasoline. (This concept was successfully 
developed in private garages in Balkans during a war, it pouffes chipper and 
safer than a regular gasoline module).<br>
 However EV is king of all concepts 
so far, it is our future and it should spread all over the world. In the term, 
this to be done, EV should be much cheaper than it is today. Hopefully we will 
see muss production of EV-s oversees soon.<br>
 p.s. Since, the graph shows an 
air resistance as the biggest enemy to EV's durability i would like you to 
think little bite how to reduce it. For instance the shack skin concepts seems 
interesting idea.</p>

<p>Fabricate the roof of the a solar panle, while it is being driven in sunny 
states, your range is greater, and while it is setting in the sun all day while 
you&rsquo;re working, you are not using power from the grid, only at night and 
if it rains you would need to plugging. (Because the solar panel will generate 
electricity, while moving or standing still) prove me wrong.<br>
 A good test 
is, take one you have now, and modify one like I said and see which one goes<br>
 Further.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  11:42pm | mei 14, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Calvin Jones; yes you are right, you get a bigger range with solar panel 
roof...about 1% bigger range for very good case. If you park your car in 
parking slot in a sunny day you might even get 10% more range in ten hours.</p> 
<p>Solar cells are much better used in buildings and solar power plants than 
in cars. Assume there is 30 cars in parking lot in typical office building, 
which is as large in sideways as the parking lot and is square in shape with 
usable roof for solar cells about 30% you get about 3600m^2 * 0.3 = 1080m^2 
surface area compared to about 30m^2 surface area in those car roofs. Use that 
power to those cars and you have much better kW for charging.</p> 
<p>Solar radiation is about 1kW/m^2 at a good sunny day. Cheap thin film solar 
cells give maybe 10% efficiency in converting it to electricity. That's 100W 
/m^2. 1080m^2*100W/m^2 is 108000W or 108kW. Divided by 30 (cars) gives 3.6kW / 
car compared to about 100W / car. With the price of $3 / watt you get $300k for 
those panels. Divided by 30 car owners you could get $10k to pay. You could 
divide that to several years, maybe five to reduce it to $2000 / year or $166 / 
month.</p> 
<p>For typical office day you can then charge 36kWh in your car (worth maybe 
100 miles) and rest of the day you can sell that electricity to the grid. You 
might actually start to *gain* some money after a while, because not all cars 
charge that much during a day. Your office building becomes a power plant.</p> 
<p>BTW nanotech is again showing interesting development in this field as well 
as batteries. I just read about solar cells with nano antennae that can convert 
*80%* of the sunlight to electiricy and it would theoretically even be cheap 
(can be produced using printing tech like newspapers are made).</p>

<p>Mr. TIMO<br>
 My previous information on LITHIUM AIR CELL invented at AIST 
had to be clarified a little more.<br>
 Realized energy density 50,000mAH/g 
where refferred mass g is not a total weight of the battery<br>
 but the mass 
of the definite AIR ANODE .<br>
 So, the masses of the LITHIUM METAL CATHODE 
and other structure is not clarified in the news contents.<br>
 So, real energy 
density is significantly reduced.<br>
 The main success info of the said news 
contents is that inserting the LI conducting barrier<br>
 between the ANODE and 
CATHODE electrolyte realizing the continuous reaction at the ANODE<br>
 by 
preventing from the sourcing of the harmful solid chemical component to the 
ANODE.<br>
 I am also unaware how many recharging cycles have been is 
established in the news contents.<br>
 If LITHIUM AIR CELL remains as a kind of 
FUEL CELL by only consuming the LITHIUM METAL,<br>
 it is not practical for EV, 
It must be realized as a rechargeable battery.<br>
 Perhaps it must be a hard 
technology.<br>
 By the way, last year , TOYOTA announced that they will 
develop METAL AIR rechargeable battery<br>
 as a battey to be adopted in future 
TOYOTA car.</p>

<p>Type S FAQ talks about fast charging and says that car can be charged to 
80% as little time as 45 min. Which battery pack? Smallest one? Any specs about 
that charger? Cost?</p> 
<p>80% out of 160 miles is 128 miles. 80% out of 300 miles is 240 miles. Am I 
right if I assume double time for larger battery pack? 1.5 hours? 540 miles is 
close to breakpoint, but it would be better if you wouldn't need to charge at 
all before 600 miles.</p> 
<p>In one of the media pages someone (forgot who) says that Model S has 85 kWh 
battery pack. Since that is 37% bigger battery pack than Roadster battery pack 
and Roadster can go 240miles I assume that one was 300 mile version? 80% out of 
85kWh in 1.5 hours needs 45kW connection. That is quite huge connection. 
Charging page says it can be charged with 480V so that gives roughly 94 amps. 
No household connection to grid can handle that, so how has it been made? 
Battery to battery charging? If so, how large is that charger? Which kind of 
batteries? Can those be upgraded? How much it costs?</p>

<p>I am still waiting a response to my question...<br>
 Has Telsa Motors ever 
published on-road performance tests of their battery packs, testing end of 
useful life of the packs&rdquo;? If yes where can the public read the results?
</p> 
<p>I will rephrase my question.<br>
 Has Telsa motors ever completed on-road 
tests of their battery packs to end-of -useful-life. Where can we see the 
results?</p> 
<p>Lab testing or even simulated road testing does not represent the real 
world of driving the EV, until the batteries fail to deliver the published 300 
MPC or the 240 MPC.</p> 
<p>My second question:<br>
 How does Telsa charge their battery packs to 80% 
SOC in 45 minutes.</p> 
<p>That is impossible to do using a household power grid connection. So when a 
person buys a Telsa EV, what does Telsa suggest they do to get the vehicles 
charged to 80% in 45 minutes?<br>
 Take the EV to a specially constructed 480V 
connection ....but where are these connections.<br>
 One may find them in SKY 
Harbor Airport in Phoenix where they fast charge EVs for service work on the 
airport.</p> 
<p>I can gas-up my Honda Ridgeline in less than 5 minutes to get 370 miles 
before my next 5 minute fill-up.</p> 
<p>Third question:<br>
 How long to charge Telsa battery packs to 100% SOC.</p>
<p>I am flabbergasted that none of the financial supporters of Telsa have not 
asked or demanded answers to critical issues of useful life of battery packs, 
and fast charging.</p> 
<p>All the marketing hype in the world will not sustain any product when 
customers discover its short comings.</p> 
<p>The EV graveyard is filled with high flying EV start ups, including GM's 
infamous EV1; they produced 1170 EV1's, and leased them. But finally took them 
back and crushed them.</p> 
<p>Fourth question:<br>
 Where does Telsa publish the &quot;cost of 
maintenance&quot; for their EVs, for example replacement battery packs, wear 
and tear and repair due to accidents.</p> 
<p>I only wish Telsa great success. But unless Telsa can provide more real 
world performance testing on their battery packs, then down the road they will 
find plenty of room in the proverbial EV graveyard.<br>

<p>Galactic Cannibal; Tesla has driven its Roadster prototypes hundreds 
thousand miles and no correction has been made to promises, so I'm guessing 
that battery pack delivers what it promises (which is 100k miles or five years 
of useful life).</p> 
<p>Your second question is for Type S. Roadster battery pack is charged from 
empty to full in 3.5 hours. There is no &quot;fast charging&quot; for Roadster 
(unless you count that 3.5 hours fast charging).</p> 
<p>Remember that Type S is still prototype. Things are subject to change, so 
no exact values can be promised. Battery pack depends of how fast they get to 
mass-produce Type S. If it is late, battery tech gets improved, if early then 
they go with a bit lesser techs.</p> 
<p>I haven't seen &quot;cost of maintenance&quot;. I'd expect it is about what 
usual car would be, except that you will never have to repair or maintain your 
engine, and your brakes are saved quite a bit by regen braking. Suspension, 
tires, wear and tear are still same, there is no miracle tech to remove those. 
Because Roadster is luxury car you can expect a bit higher cost for quality 
repairs, but quality would be excellent.</p> 
<p>EV battery pack can never be charged as fast as you can fill a gas tank 
(just basic physics) unless you get some superconductive wiring to do the trick 
in distant future. But who cares if you can drive 600 miles with single charge 
(tech to that is very near finished), and while having your lunch break you get 
charged to 200-400 miles more. That is whole day worth driving. And you can 
start every day with full charge.</p> 
<p>Just like solar photovoltaic cells, battery tech improves fast, really 
fast, and while doing so prices go down / kWh battery pack can hold. Soon you 
can get battery packs with 500-700Wh/kg energy densities, which means Type S 
300 mile 85kW battery pack times two (600 miles) would weight only 340-240 kg 
and take space about same as your current gas tank, and it is not stopping 
there. A bit further away are techs that can deliver over 1.5kWh/kg. Era of gas 
guzzlers is over, what you see now in roads are last remnants of obsolete tech.

<p>People on this blog have mentioned battery to battery charging and high 
grid power charging. A better way to do this would be capacitor to battery 
charging. The capacitors bank could slow charge from the grid and quick charge 
to the battery rapidly speeding the recharge time. While not ideal for home use 
it is great for recharge stations which could use a combo of wind and solar 
technologies to slow charge the capacitors. This method would solve many of the 
range problems of EV's and could start as a slow moving infrastructure 
expanding from each Tesla dealer much like the marriage of the big three and 
big oil. We could have big EV and big wind&amp; solar. this could happen soon 
here in the US if the politicians could uncover their eyes and become less 
greedy.</p> 
<p>The best way for people to make a difference is to work at the local level 
to create the infrastructure need for Tesla and other EV makers to grow.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Joshua Maxwell; I'm not sure how you would benefit from low energy density 
expensive capacitors compared to batteries. Care to explain further? If you 
think that batteries can't deliver enough wattage you are just wrong. Anyway, 
absolute limit is set by car-side of the batteries, not charger side. Car can't 
accept very huge volts and amps without converter, and with huge amps and volts 
that converter would be large. Another point of limiting factor is charger 
cable, which can't be very huge either, otherwise you would need some 
assistance in connecting it to car.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Joshua Maxwell  8:47pm | mei 19, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The reason I would choose capacitors at the charge site is due to there 
quick charge/ discharge time and their operational life. From what I have read 
LI ion batteries have a life span of 5 years or so; capacitors have a life span 
of 15 years. This will allow stations to have a longer life of service between 
replacement time. With a three times the life span this would cover the 
slightly higher cost of capacitors. The cable size would roughly be 1.5 inches 
in diameter to handle a 200 amp @ 1700 V this would charge the a 85 Kw vehicle 
in about 15 min. As for safety the typical driver would not perform this task. 
Workers at the station would be need and would ask the driver and passengers to 
wait in the store front of the station until there number is called or name or 
what ever system the station would use. So for drivers in New Jersey nothing 
would change since all the gas stations are still full service. Second layer of 
safety would be the charger it self . The Charger and the car would talk and 
confirm a safe connection and the line is clear for power to be transmitted. If 
at any point the processes would become unsafe then the charger would stop 
power. Hmm I think i just described the recharge safety already built in the 
all Tesla models and add an extra layer to the high voltage charging unit. As 
for the car side of the high power charge the power systems designers could 
look in the a second recharge power loop to handle high power recharge 
applications. Remember if you have battery to battery charging one battery 
needs to be charged which means the once the station has used all of it 
batteries for charging it will close for the day limiting the number of cars 
that can be charged. While the capacitors banks could be charged in a matter of 
30 after recharging a car and would only need close for regular business hours. 
the other problem with battery to battery is that order to completely fill an 
empty battery you need the charger battery to be twice the capacitance of the 
empty. Capacitor technology is moving ahead faster than battery tech and should 
be looked at for recharge stations.</p> 
<p>Any way we find to provide a infrastructure to support EV transportation 
would be a step in the right direction. Remember that when the model T debuted 
in 1908 you only could by gas at the refinery. in the 20's and 30's you could 
buy it in hardware stores. It wasn't till the 50's when you saw gas stations as 
we know them today and that infrastructure wasn't complete till the 60's.<br>
 
You could make the car have a 2000 mile range and people will still complain 
that they cant charge when they want to quickly.</p>

<p>The simplest form of storing energy is in a gyro. 300lbs wheel at 300,000

<p>Daimler has acquired 10% of Tesla as everybody should now know. In press 
release Tesla (Elon Musk) says that it is mainly interested about Daimler 
battery tech. Does anybody know what tech that is? Best I could find was this:
http://www.zsw-bw.de/info/current/365Orte/Barenschee.pdf </p> 
<p>That shows that they have 200Wh/kg battery that has excellent cycling 
capability (over 2000 cycles with 90% capacity which equals about 400000 miles 
running in Roadster). Energy density isn't that high. 200Wh/kg is not anything 
extraordinary. With Roadster 450kg battery pack, assuming 100kg casing, that 
would be 350kg*200Wh/kg = 70kWh battery pack. That is only 23% improvement. Of 
course that battery seems to be rather durable so it might not need as heavy 
casing and complex environment control system. If I drop 50kg out of that 
equation I get 80kWh which is about 33% increase. 240 * 1.33 =~ 320 miles.</p> 
<p>I do expect at least 400Wh/kg batteries appearing in the market in next two 
years. When Type S is ready it should have 600 mile range, not 300.</p> 
<p>It might be that main benefit from this co-operation is that Tesla is 
getting those batteries in discount prices.</p>

<p>Joshua Maxwell; I would use flywheels for high life span. They have 
relatively high energy density, are relatively cheap, easy to maintain, and 
have no capacity degradation over time.</p> 
<p>Capacitor tech is not moving faster ahead than battery tech. Batteries in 
very close future should give about 1.5-2kWh/kg energy density and power 
density of over 100kW/kg, maybe over 200kW/kg. That is capacitor-class power 
density with battery energy density. No capacitor can match that. But that 
doesn't matter in this case.</p> 
<p>You say that you can charge capacitor in 30 (what? minutes I assume). You 
can do that same for batteries or flywheels. That's no problem. Speed of 
recharging is not battery/flywheel problem, it is grid connection problem. You 
gain no advantage of capacitor fast recharge capability when grid can't deliver 
you that power. For price of one supercapacitor you get 10-100 or more high 
enough energy density batteries / flywheels, so capacity timeout is not 
battery/flywheel problem, it is capacitor problem. Note that you don't need to 
use high-price, high energy density lithium-ion batteries, you can use whatever 
is cheapest in long term. Recharge station doesn't have space- or 
weight-problem like cars do.</p> 
<p>In all cases, no matter which tech you use, you need grid connection that 
can deliver enough power to charge all used batteries/flywheels/capacitors in a 
day. That means for 24 85kWh cars 85kW connection, which is way beyond ordinary 
grid connection. For more more. Luckily with high capacity car batteries 
charging stations don't get many customers during one day that charge their 
cars. You need to use charging station _only_ in long road trips. That should 
reduce customer base in about 90% of current gas station customers. That also 
means that charging stations wont generate income unless they deliver some 
other service like restaurant.</p> 
<p>As for completely filling battery from another battery, you don't need 
twice the capacitance. Voltage used determines which way current is flowing, so 
you can drain one battery dry while other is recharging until voltage drops 
below charging. This same obviously applies to capacitors too.</p> 
<p>That 200A @1700V is for volts too high for car to handle. Best voltage for 
car would be its battery pack native voltage + some for charging so that 
onboard PEM can handle that voltage. That means 200A @ 500V or so. That is 
100kW which would charge 85kWh battery in about 50 minutes. That's fast enough.
</p> 
<p>I don't believe that people would complain about &quot;slow charging&quot; 
with 2000 mile range. With that kind of range they wouldn't even notice that it 
takes time to recharge car (or at least 99% of people wouldn't). Electricity is 
available pretty much everywhere, and if you have that kind of range you just 
plug it in when you are home and leave your garage every single day with full 
battery pack. 2000 miles at 60 mph would mean 33 hours of driving without 
chance to charge even slowly. That is more than two days of 16 hour driving if 
you sleep 8 hours in between, _and_ you don't charge your car (even slowly) at 
night. You would need roughly 240kWh for 8 hours = 30kW connection to charge it 
back full during night. Half that (15kW = 380V @ 40A: no problem for charging) 
and you can drive nearly four days with no need to fast charge your car. 
Initial car range makes a big difference.</p>

<p>I think the battery tech that Daimler has that Tesla whats to test is the 
new SCib battery from Toshiba I read in an article a week ago that I cant find 
now that Toshiba had given some of these batteries to major car makers in the 
US and Europe to test for use in EVs.</p> 
<p>http://www.autobloggreen.com/2007/12/11/toshibas-new-scib-battery-charge...
</p> 
<p>Timo and Michael you mentioned gyros for the charging station I don't see 
who they would work efficiently for electrical power transfer or storage. You 
would waste a lot of energy going from electrical to mechanical and then back 
to electrical to charge the car. Batteries would also have a similar loss due 
to their internal resistance. Capacitors do not have internal resistance and 
are there for more efficient. The way the charge stations would be profitable 
would be from as you said a restaurant , food mart, Arcade, or some other store 
front, or mechanics shop. They could also make money by providing power back to 
the grid when not charging cars. Three of these capacitors per charge bay would 
be enough to charge a car

Though I share my name with the company I am not affiliated with them in any 
way its just a happy coincidence.</p>

<p>I found the article that states that Toshiba has shipped the SCib's to 
leading car makers.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>All this talk about charge stations needing to store power is just not 
reasonable. Electric power companies provide 3phase 480V power to millions of 
factories world wide and can easily do the same for charge stations. At the 
last company I worked at they made school buses and factory was about 80,000 
sq.ft. (small by most factory standards). It had a 600 amp service. This power 
supply is 480 x 600 x 1.73 = 498kW.</p> 
<p>Evonic (Daimler) batteries are far superior to Toshiba's scib. Evonic are 
Lithium Manganese Polymer as are Chevy Volts, Tata's Indica EV, Kia, Hyundai. 
Toshiba may be trying to flog these batteries to auto companies but no one is 
buying because they are much lower energy density.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  1:49am | mei 25, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I just read (again) Sciencedirect Journal Of Power Sources. There has been 
change in articles compared to last year. Now it is not even a news to have 
500Wh/kg energy density, in fact all tests are made for those chemistries that 
provide *at least* that high energy density.</p> 
<p>Higher energy densities are now in class 200-300mAh/g with around 3.5V 
(translates to 700-1050Wh/kg) and even those are not &quot;big news&quot; just 
ordinary experiments. Biggest I saw was over 2000Wh/kg.</p> 
<p>Those are so called gravimetric energy densities. Volumetric are normally 
about twice as high, so 2kWh/l or 200kWh for 100 liters which would give you 
range over 600miles (about 705miles with Type S efficiency) and is about size 
of large gas tank. That would weight about 200kg. Considering that 185kW 
electric engine weights a lot less than 185kW ICE engine + heavier transmission 
+ other accessories that ICE needs weight/power -ratio is then in BEV favor. 
ICE range is still bigger, but about 700 miles is over breakpoint (10 hours of 
driving at 60mph average speed), which means that you need to rarely recharge 
even in longer road trips and when you do you can choose which &quot;recharge 
station&quot; you would like to use to get where you are going and are not 
forced to use always same one (these recharge stations obviously don't exist 
yet).</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  2:54am | mei 25, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Joshua Maxwell; Flywheels have very high efficiency: about 95-98% 
(basically electric engine/generator efficiency). Also batteries have that same 
high efficiency. You do have losses, but they are not big ones. Flywheels do 
not have any capacity degradation over time, are relatively cheap / Wh and very 
easy to maintain which is their main benefit over pretty much any other energy 
storage method. Main point is that they are cheap over time.</p> 
<p>Also: read that Maxwell ultracapacitor data sheet. Energy capability of one 
of those is 101.7Wh. That means you need about 850 of those to get one Type S 
85kWh 300 mile battery charged. Not three. One unit weights about 60kg. That is 
60kg *850=51000kg. One unit has dimensions of 762 x 425 x 265 mm (~0.085 m^3) 
so 850 of those is about 73 m^3 or about 2m*6m*6*m. That is for one car. And 
that doesn't count necessary air caps between units.</p> 
<p>I don't think Daimler or Tesla would be using SCiB batteries. They have 
lousy energy density of about 67Wh/kg which is little bit over half of what 
Tesla is using now. Only good thing in those is that they can be charged fast, 
but because charging speed is really limited by connection that doesn't matter.
</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  6:26am | mei 25, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Joshua Maxwell; I found online store for those Maxwell ultracapasitors. One 
with slightly higher energy density (BMOD0058 E015 B1) has energy density of 
2.67Wh/kg and weight 680g. That has price of $247 / unit.</p> 
<p>To get one 85kWh battery charged you need 85000Wh/2.67Wh/kg = 31835kg of 
those. Since one weights 680g that is 31835000g/680g = 46816 units. Times cost 
= $11 563 670. That is a lot of batteries or flywheels.</p> 
<p>If those get price a lot down or energy density a lot up then I agree with 
you, but as it is now capacitors just aren't useful.</p> 
<p>For flywheels I found several articles, example this one: 
http://www.itpower.co.uk/investire/pdfs/flywheelrep.pdf</p> 
<p>That shows that flywheels aren't exactly cheap either (initial cost around 
$1000/kWh) but their maintenance costs are very low and usable lifetime decades 
long.</p> 
<p>It might be that standard &quot;cheapest battery you can find&quot; 
solution would be better than flywheels, at least for now. For $85 000 you can 
buy huge of battery-based storage unit. Maybe litium-ion batteries win this 
race too.</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Lihium shortage? Is it possible?</p> 
<p>I think it is. Current estimates of easily accessible lithium is between 
8-20 million tons. Lets get optimistic and say 15 billion kg would be what we 
have. There will be about one billion cars out there soon (China and India are 
fast growing in this). One billion cars with 200kg battery packs is 200 billion 
kg. Even if we assume that only one tenth of that is lithium it is still 20 
billion kg. Even if we recycle every bit of lithium it might not be enough.</p> 
<p>It might be that lithium ion -based batteries are not &quot;savior of the 
future&quot; after all. We might need some other method of storing energy if we 
want to use EV:s. Fuel cell cars maybe if non-polluting cheap method of 
generating hydrogen is invented, or ultracapacitors if they ever get near 
batteries in capacity. Superconducting magnetic storage? Maybe in distant 
future with high temperature superconductors. Nuclear fusion? Not entirely 
impossible if something like Focus Fusion concept can be miniaturized in 
car-size energy source.</p> 
<p>Aluminum as replacement for Lithium? That could solve pretty much all 
problems for abundance, but I haven't seen realistic aluminum battery concept. 
Europositron claims that they have invented one, but that is very likely to be 
just a scam to collect money.</p> 
<p>Anyone seen any feasible battery concept that isn't based on lithium? It 
would need to have at least 400Wh/kg potential to be realistic replacement.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Christopher Kiely  12:25pm | mei 26, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Timo, a feasible replacement for the batteries will hopefully be future 
ultracapacitors... forget the batteries all together.</p> 
<p>With almost instant recharging you should be able to recoup a significant 
amount of spent energy through the dynamic braking system, they have a longer 
life than any current battery and they're more efficient. There is a lot of 
potential in the ultracaps (or superconductors), and they're already being used 
in mass-transit applications but until the technology is refined and filters 
down to the automotive level it seems most companies pursuing the battery 
technology are placing their bets on lithium.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  12:01am | mei 27, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Christopher Kiely; We have to use batteries for now. There just isn't any 
other feasible alternative. In future there might be, but as you can see from 
my post to Joshua Maxwell current ultracaps have two-three orders of magnitude 
too weak energy density, and there is nothing in sight to show that they get 
much better than that. In fact I don't believe they ever will get close to even 
NiMH batteries. In automotive use higher efficiency is nullified by increased 
weight. One good thing is that they really can be used to collect nearly all 
braking energy, but OTOH so can best batteries too.</p> 
<p>Don't get me wrong, I do hope that something like EEStor system could be 
viable, but as it is now they lack necessary energy density to be useful. *IF* 
EEStor is real then we might have alternative very soon, but I'm pretty 
sceptical about that.</p>

<p>I read that MIT is looking at nanotubes applications for ultracapacitors. 
They feel that coating the ion collecting area with nanotubes can increase the 
surface area by 5 to one. The nanotube coating also allows twice the voltage 
over current technology. The combination is projected to increase the energy 
density of ultracapacitors from 5 % of battery technology to 50%. They also 
spoke of being able to extract more of the energy from capacitors in hybrid 
cars than from batteries. I question this since the more charge that is 
depleted from a capacitor the lower the voltage becomes making its use limited.

<p>Rich Colwell,</p> 
<p>One of the frustrating things is reading about all these great new 
developments, and finding out that non are actually available to individual 
users. Tesla does make the best motor in my opinion, but there are several that 
come close including Raser (licensed to Hyundai), Kaisei and tm4 (only 
prototypes, I think), and PML Flightlink. Only PML has announced that they are 
making a production line for their Hi-Pa drives and this link
http://www.hipadrive.com/faq.html says about 18 months (been there for almost a 
year). Now I'm not a big fan of wheel motors, but if you are creative, you 
might be able to use one in the position where your ICE is, or maybe with the 
axis vertical and a 90 deg drive.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Just now, I started visiting this blog. What's striking is your Range Vs. 
Speed curve, which is equivalent to vehicle efficiency vs. speed. Whether this 
represents human transportation efficiency (if you consider driving time 
unproductive) or not, the fact is that drivers actually spend most of their 
driving miles at low speeds. Think about stop-and-go driving. As an engineer 
with a transmission (IVT) invention, I've studied vehicle kinetics and 
demographic statistics to get a feel for real-world practical applications of 
transmissions; this study revealed that American drivers go only 11 m.p.h. on 
average! This is probably a surprise to most readers here. Now look at the 
Tesla Roadster 'Range Vs. Speed' curve again; maximum efficiency is at ~18 
m.p.h., but at American average speed of 11 m.p.h. it's efficiency is ~94% of 
maximum! That's excellent! It is as though the Tesla was intentionally designed 
for our real world driving. Does this mean we should expect 11 m.p.h. range, on 
average? No. Our mix of driving speeds includes 65 m.p.h (or more), and one 
should consider the *distribution* of our speeds. As the CTO explains, such 
efficiencies fall off drastically at low and high speeds because of nonlinear 
effects, such as parasitic losses, and high order functions of aerodynamics 
&amp; tire drag. But in total, high efficiency is obtained optimally here. 
Drivers have little choice about their driving speeds, so this efficiency is 
fortuitous. American driving speeds are likely representative of world-wide 
driving, approximately. Tesla is doing what other auto engineers should have 
done long ago. Consider reality!</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  10:37am | mei 30, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Barry A. Simkins; I agree that Tesla is tailor-made for average US citizen, 
but I don't think that low speed estimate applies to all of us. US is notorious 
about that there people use cars to get everywhere, even very short distances. 
That is not true all over the world. 11mph average speed is obviously artifact 
of sitting in traffic jam most of the time and driving very low speeds at city 
centrals.</p> 
<p>I myself live in about 1M people city and not all of us own a car because 
we simply don't need one. There are trams, metro, city buses and excellent 
light traffic ways. In cities with excellent light traffic ways using bicycles 
gets you in your destination faster than with car. In fact I probably get to 
work faster *walking* than with a car (about 25 min walking distance) if you 
count time from door to door. If we want to get somewhere longer you can always 
rent a car or use a train.</p> 
<p>As for me specially I need car only for long-distance driving, and then 
average speed is closer to 50mph than 40mph.</p> 
<p>Then again that might actually mean that global average driving speed is 
18mph :-)</p>

the availability of Lithium?
http://gas2.org/2008/10/13/lithium-counterpoint-no-shortage-for-electric...<br>

 Sounds like the Silicon shortage for PV: not really a problem. Just an 
industry taken by surprise. Now new factories actually bring the price down.<br>
 I really hope your predictions about 400Wh/kg or more in a couple of years pan 
out, especially if the price where brought down to 1$/kWh or something. That 
would really be the end of the internal combustion engine. And good riddance.

<p>Auke Hoekstra; Thank you very much about that link. It seems that my info 
about lithium shortage was simply wrong. I thought that easily accessed lithium 
reserve is very limited, but if you can get it from seawater with just $30/kg, 
then we have way more than enough lithium for those batteries.</p> 
<p>Also that you need only 1.5kg of lithium for 1kWh battery that means that 
it costs $45 to get 1kWh battery. Lithium battery price comes from something 
else than materials.</p> 
<p>So, lets get those 2kWh/kg batteries at $1000. 500Wh/kg very near future 
and more shortly after :-)</p> 
<p>(I assume you did mean to write about lithium, not silicon. Silicon is, if 
I recall correclty, second most abundant mineral in earth crust. Ordinary sand 
is mostly silicon).</p> 
<p>No I don't have a blog. I work at university so I have access to all kinds 
of scientific materials that you usually would need to buy for free, and I'm 
just read a lot of those.</p> 
<p>Dimitris; Tesla ESS is very safe, and designed to disengage in case of 
accidents. Cars are also otherwise safe too, there has been real life accidents 
already with Roadster and those have shown that they are safe cars to drive.</p>
<p>Tesla ESS is a lot safer than gasoline, except maybe in case where you 
drive your car into lake. In that case I really don't know what happens.</p> 
<p>Brakes are just ordinary friction brakes, so no difference there. 
Regenerative &quot;braking&quot; is actually engine brake, and engages when you 
lift your feet from accelerator, not when you press the brakes.</p>

<p>Hi Timo, I think it may be a race. Can battery technology improve to the 
point where batteries can be quickly charged through the dynamic braking 
system? Or can ultracaps (supercaps) meet the energy density requirements first?
</p> 
<p>Both technologies have desirable and undesirable characteristics. The ideal 
energy source would contain characteristics of both batteries and caps: energy 
density of a battery, life span of a capacitor, ability to be repeatedly and 
quickly charged like a capacitor. It will be interesting to see what technology 
wins out. I am also skeptical about some of the &quot;on the horizon&quot; 
technologies that seem to get announced weekly these days, but I temper my 
skepticism with a heavy dose of optimism about the future of EVs.</p> 
<p>What is important is that consumer products like the Tesla are successful, 
because consumer demand is what's going to drive the R&amp;D.</p> 
<p>Here's an interesting article on &quot;nanoball&quot; batteries that are 
attempting to combine the quick charging benefits of a cap in to a battery.</p>

<p>Timo: Let's see; you are interested in Tesla (Menlo Park), and you live in 
a city with 1M. San Jose? Academic. E.E. or M.E. student or prof? SJSU? 
Whatever. I used to bicycle to work in Silicon Valley, about 13 miles each way, 
and would pass my car-driving coworkers several times during the trips. City 
driving is slow. You are painfully right in suggesting that many Americans use 
cars for short distances, where infrastructure like Caltrans, BART or bicycles 
would be more efficient. Cars mean freedom &amp; independence to Americans. 
This cultural bias must change. Car companies have historically responded with 
accomodation, not leadership; this is the moral equivalent of a drug dealer 
dispensing heroin. We haven't embraced our light-rail commuting in droves. 
American drivers prefer to lug around thousands of pounds for the convenience, 
privacy &amp; security of driving. Tesla's challenge is to persuasively nudge 
those habits into more efficient modes for us. A Roadster that can go 0-60 in 4 
seconds and125 mph tops is only a marketing tool to dramatically introduce us 
to a solution.</p> 
<p>The goal of electric cars should be to produce vehicles that are light and 
efficient enough for city driving *and* long, fast trips. Few car buyers will 
want two specialty cars, each. We should be persuaded that compact cockpit 
volume, light weight and some discomfort are attendent to more necessary 
economy. This will require imaginative car designs that significantly reduce 
aerodynamic drag, and provide sufficient performance &amp; best economy at low 
&amp; high speed. If Tesla does this progressively, Americans will adapt by 
buying their cars.</p>

<p>It is obvious to most that a generator and the electric motor are basically 
opposites. If the electric motor is turning a generator then why do you need a 
lithuim battery? What most don't know is a lituim battery causes more pollution 
to the environment then gasoline. Basically what I am saying is why do so many 
companies try and pretend that they are not intellegent enough to place the 
battery on a relay and run the motor off an alternate electrical source when 
the motor is in motion, meanwhile charging the battery back up like the basic 
opperation of todays automobile? Don't get me wrong I really like the Tesla

 With either the air-carbon or nanowire silicon anodes, and 
perhaps this Lithium-Manganese cathode [
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl8024328 ] it will be possible to get a 
very potent battery indeed! Of course, storing 10X the energy means feeding in 
10X the energy, so the demand for hi-power charging facilities would mushroom.

 With the increase in battery energy density from nanowire or 
air-carbon (or other technologies) allows one to use smaller lighter possibly 
cheaper batteries to get 300miles or even 600 miles per charge. The fact 
remains that the average driving distance is about 40 miles per day and having 
more range will not put a bigger burden on the power grid. The longer range 
battery is a convenience for the occasional vacation trip or other long trip 
need.</p>

<p>@Timo: yes I did mean Lithium. Glad that you found my link useful but be 
careful because the process to make Lithium from seawater is not proven 
technology. On the other hand: I read somewhere else (don't remember where) 
that we have not really &quot;scourged the earth&quot; for Lithium. It was 
simply too abundant and cheap until Lithium batteries emerged. This is also a 
useful recent study into the price of Lithium batteries and their 
competitiveness when build into ER-EV's like the Chevy Volt:
http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/1007<br>
 BTW I am a great 
fan of ER-EV's (I like the GM marketing term better than the PHEV) because it's 
simply a win-win solution that automatically leads to EV's once 
batteries/supercaps can be charged quickly and once the infrastructure is in 
place.<br>
 And by the way: did you see the &quot;Lightning Car&quot; that uses 
A123 batteries and claims it can recharge for 300km in 10 minutes. Not for sale 
yet but like the Tesla Roadster it is a very cool car!</p>

<p>Hey guys your cars look awesome! The &quot;S&quot; may just be my next car 
purchase. I was wondering how is the car heated?<br>
 I live in Toronto Canada 
and a car like this will need to perform well in the cold. How much will the 
range be reduced with the heater<br>
 operating in the winter?</p>

<p>Auke Hoekstra thanks for the input on the &ldquo;Lighting Car&rdquo;. It 
has some interesting design features. It has permanent magnet brushless motors 
in each wheel. It also plans on using a nano-titanate form of Lithium ion 
battery. This battery technology has a shorter recharge time, a longer life and 
increased safety at the expense of some energy density. It is interesting to 
see all this technology evolving for EVs and its ability to get rid of all the 
ICE baggage of gearboxes, differentials, drive shafts etc.</p>

<p>Perfection, i think that Nikola Tesla would bee proud that a factory and a 
car like this has his name. Reading these comments and ideas i got one my one, 
regarding better consumption of accumulated energy. The prime idea and genius 
of Tesla`s electromotors is the simplicity, one rotor one stator and miracle, 
energy, my idea is to make a rotor of almost every moving part on the car ex. 
tires and transmission that until now had only a passive (spending) role. This 
is way to create a amount of energy that can bee used for peripherals like 
stereo, car lights, etc. or maybe even more. Ok this will cost you one Tesla 
roadster :) joke :) maybe :). Everything best from muther land of Nikola Tesla, 
good work and good luck.</p>

<p>Range extender EV is slightly different than ordinary PHEV. Ordinary PHEV 
has emotor in parallel of ICE and when you need more power they both are used 
to transfer energy to tires. RE-EV has them in serial so that all the power to 
the tires comes from the EV and ICE is used as generator to charge batteries / 
transfer energy directly to emotor.</p> 
<p>So it is not only term-difference, it is also technical difference. I don't 
think Chevy Volt will ever be very successful, it is obsolete already. All 
hybrids pretty much are. Future is large range pure EV with fast chargers 
distributed here and there for those that need it in long road trips. I don't 
believe in battery swapping either, that is just too costly in long term for 
swap stations.</p> 
<p>For Lightning 10minute charging, that is entirely possible if you plug it 
directly to power station. 300 miles means around 80kWh battery and 10 minutes 
means 480kW connection. 480V 1000A. Not a everyday connector. In fact there is 
recent invention that allows charging batteries in few seconds (allowing 
175kW/kg power density), fully charged battery in about five seconds. Not 
hugely useful for automotive use (unless you are building a dragster), but for 
phones and laptops with low energy batteries, yes.</p>

<p>Aleksndar, generators convert mecanical power into electrical power. Using 
any rotating part as a generator will produce a drag, proportional to the 
electrical energy producedm slowing it down. Tesla cars already have a motor 
that can be reversed to act as a generator, restoring some charge to the 
batteries, but it slows the car down, as the energy comes from the momentum of 
the car. That is called &quot;Regenerative braking&quot;.</p> 
<p>It really isn't a good idea to drive around with the brakes on, even if 
they are regenerative, no matter where they are located.</p>

<p>It really does seem that a lot of people are missing the point.<br>
 The 
entire world is moving towards renewable energy sources. To blame Tesla for the 
total lack of forethought in the energy program of The USA is foolish. The fact 
that most of the power in the USA comes from either coal or nuclear technology 
is insane. Bottom line is that there is no alternative but to move to renewable 
energy sources. This may be solar, wind or even tidal power stations. It will 
happen, it's just a case of when.<br>
 As for those of you who are trying to 
solve the range problem with combustion engine solutions, (one demented soul 
actually proposed a Subaru engine driving a generator mounted in a trailer, 
which would drastically reduce the possible range due to increased drag) you 
are totally missing the point.<br>
 THIS IS A ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE!!!<br>
 A 
more obvious solution is solar panels on every painted surface.<br>
 Of course 
battery technology is moving forward in leaps and bounds, and this type of 
vehicle will drive that technology to advance at a much greater rate due to 
demand and supply.<br>
 My only concern is the magnetic fields produced by the 
motor, and the possible adverse effects on the occupants.<br>
 I assume Tesla 
are aware of such concerns, and are using a frequency that is not detrimental 
to human health. i.e. 55/60 Hz<br>
 Rife technology, and the Bob Beck protocol 
could be employed to actually cure diseases when driving the vehicle, having a 
positive effect, and actually curing disease whilst driving.<br>
 Please follow 
this up Tesla, because it would be a huge selling point.<br>
 I have also seen 
types of motor that are nearly 100% efficient using fixed magnets, and even 
heard some rather out there claims of motors that are up to 400% efficient 
using fixed magnets that move in and out of shielded positions, greatly 
increasing efficiency...<br>
 Yes I realise that most of you see these as 
crackpot ideas, but a quick Google search will reveal that a great many people 
hold this theory in high esteem, and many are trying to market it.<br>
 Surely 
worth at least researching to prove or disprove.<br>
 Don't forget that the 
claims made by the Tesla Motor company were totally rubbished by much of the 
scientific community.<br>
 I would have loved to see their faces when they 
realised they were so so wrong.<br>
 Well done Tesla!<br>
 I am saving for my 
own Tesla car in 2011, and will mortgage everything just to have one!</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ben Ryan; 400% efficiency is just impossibility, it would make perpetual 
machine reality. Just ordinary emotor runs about 95+ efficiency, which is about 
best efficiency percent that humans have ever made in any energy conversions.
</p> 
<p>About healing diseases using electric fields, those are just 
placebo-effects, nothing real is happening. Same thing other way around.</p> 
<p>BEV is future of the automobiles, about that I agree with you fully. Future 
is also solar and geothermal and other non-polluting energy sources.</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly you are proposing generator (alternator) in 
the car. That is basically range extender that is in some car designs like Volt.
</p> 
<p>Basic reasons are:<br>
 1) They are dead weight reducing performance.<br>
 
2) They are complex, easy to break machines which creates maintenance costs<br>

 3) They increase complexity of the design which increases cost of the 
manufacturing<br>
 4) They pollute<br>
 5) They need refilling in gas-stations
<br> 6) They greatly reduce pure electric range<br>
 7) They are noisy<br>

They are dirty<br>

<p>If you consider that this is a transformation from a 36 volt forklift to a 
240 volt roadracer, you might begin to understand that this technology has been 
around for many decades. You must , also, stop to concider that there may be 
something else that you missed. I am not talking about regenerative braking, or 
using a motor as an alternator when you apply the brakes. I am talking about 
adding a dedicated alternator. And, before you condem me, you should really 
take a closer look at the schematic, to see how it would fit in.</p>

 You clearly have no clue about what an alternator is. In an ICE 
car, it takes energy from the motor and turns it into electricity. Since there 
is no gasoline motor in the Tesla to drive the alternator, you'll have to rely 
on hamsters in rotation cages. LOTS of hamsters. LOTS of cages. And no, you 
can't use the battery to drive the alternator to charge the battery. Why? God 
says so. (He wrote the Laws of Thermodynamics specifically to frustrate fools.

<p>Tesla has done a great job in demonstrating what an all Electric Vehicle 
(EV) can be. However the all Electric Vehicle at this time in history seems to 
cater to a niche market. There are few if any charging stations and no effort 
in progress to install them. Owners of EVs would have to limit their trips to 
200 to 300 miles round trip so they can recharge at home. I call this an 
&ldquo;absolute range limitation&rdquo;. Such owners would have to own or rent 
an additional internal combustion vehicle to accommodate longer trips.</p> 
<p>The REEV (range extended Electric Vehicle) like the Volt and the PML mini 
http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/the_hybrid_mini.php offer a viable 
alternative to the EV for reducing dependence on foreign oil without the 
&ldquo;absolute range limitations&rdquo;. One could buy such a vehicle and use 
it for both everyday commutes as well as longer trips, since there is presently 
a network of petroleum fueling station across the country. These vehicles run 
on all electric till the batteries run low and then switch in an ICE motor 
generator to provide electrical energy to drive the motors or recharge the 
battery. This motor generator is the size of a spare tire in the PML 
mini&rsquo;s case. The advantage of this serial concept over the ICE direct 
drive parallel concept is the elimination of gearboxes and dual drive 
mechanisms. They allow the vehicle to maintain the clean architecture of an 
electronically controlled electric motor power train. The ICE motor can also 
run at a single rpm for optimum performance while generating electricity. While 
running off the ICE regenerative breaking could still be active to provide 
additional battery charging</p> 
<p>The main advantage of the REEV vehicle is that even with a reduced all 
electric range (from smaller battery) they would provide a big if not total 
reduction on our dependence on foreign oil. Since the average commuter distance 
is about 40 miles the REEV could on average get almost all of it energy from 
the power grid. Since the power grid derives only 1% of its power from 
petroleum products the REEV greatly reduces consumption of petroleum products. 
The major power grid fuel comes from: 49% coal, 20% natural gas and 19% 
nuclear, 7% hydro and 3 % from wind/solar (solar being the smaller). Right now 
our automobile fleet is a major consumer of petroleum in the form of gasoline 
and diesel fuel. We do use petroleum for other products such as plastics etc. 
By reducing our usage of petroleum to 40% of our current use allows us to only 
use our domestic petroleum production eliminating oil imports.</p> 
<p>I know you EV purest feel this is heresy. But it is better to refill at a 
gas station rather than call a tow truck. The range extender weight is offset 
by reducing the battery to better optimize it for the average commute distance. 
The range extender is dead weigh just like the extra battery capacity is dead 
weigh when not used for the average commute distance. The ICE is pretty 
reliable these days and would only get used for long trips. They pollute only 
on those rare long trips. It is an interim crutch till charging station catch 
on.</p> 
<p>We may not be able to count on GM to develop it Volt due to its financial 
situations. Tesla would have a good size market if it used its technology to 
develop such a product.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>BShumberger, an alternator is just a device to turn mechanical energy into 
electrical energy. So, where does that mechanical energy come from? In most 
other cars, it comes from the gasoline engine, but an electric car has no 
gasoline engine. The only source of mechanical energy in the Tesla Roadster 
comes from the movement of the car itself, tapping that would slow the car down 
- and that is precisely what the regenerative braking is. When it needs to slow 
down, it transforms the motor into an alternator, slowing the car and partially 
recharging the batteries.</p> 
<p>Now, I suppose you could put bicycle pedals on the passenger side, 
connected to an alternator, but with the limits of human power, that would mean 
an awful lot of exercise for very little distance!</p>

<p>For all the would be engineers out there who devise ways to recharge 
batteries while in transit. The mean must follow these rules:<br>
 1. Energy 
flows from high potential source to low potential sink. ( ie Positive terminal 
to ground)<br>
 2. There is always energy loss due to heat. ( yes even in wires 
they have resistance )<br>
 3. the source and sink must be out side the object 
doing work. ( ie the battery is independent from the motor)</p> 
<p>With these rules you can not charge the battery and run the motor from the 
battery concurrently you do one or the other.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  8:53am | jul 1, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>BShumberger; there is nothing to discuss. Alternator connected to emotor is 
just brake connected to motor. Alternator collects its energy by slowing down 
whatever it is connected to, so basically you are proposing to drive with 
brakes on, which is always bad idea. Your idea is not a new one, this is 
proposed every now and then. Energy is not free, not magnetic, not electric and 
not kinetic. Alternator you are proposing just turns kinetic energy to electric 
energy (with losses) , which is exact opposite what emotor is doing. You just 
end up losing energy, that's all.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  BShumberger  3:54pm | jul 2, 2009

<p></p> 
<p>Many scientific and engineering concepts like balance and equilibrium have 
been known by man for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Circular motion has 
been understood since the invention of the wheel. Variable frequency has been 
understood at least since the invention of the vacuum tube. Two wheels and a 
rope can be used to make a &ldquo;Block and Tackle&rdquo; to lift objects that 
are too heavy for us to lift by ourselves. A lever and fulcrum become a seesaw 
at a children&rsquo;s playground. All of our current technology has been 
constructed from simple concepts that we now take for granted. Only a 
nefarious, modern day, pirate could create the label of THERMO-DYNAMICS, and 
then claim that nobody can understand the principles of YIN and YANG as well as 
he does.</p> 
<p>There are companies that have been using power inverters and variable 
frequency drives to control traction motors in electric forklifts since the 
1970&rsquo;s, or earlier. Instead of the automotive companies acknowledging 
that they are catching up to 40 or 50 year old technology, these intellectual 
neophytes are trying to convince us that they are creating this technology for 
the first time, and that it has been a very difficult undertaking.</p> 
<p>I have found a solution that is &ldquo;hidden in plain sight&rdquo; within 
the automotive electrical system. This solution will allow a person to drive an 
electric vehicle across the nation without having to stop and recharge the 
battery pack or switch over to a gas powered generator. This solution also 
makes it possible to build a generator system for your home that will 
completely eliminate your monthly electric bill. A small, 5 volt, portable 
generator system can be built for use with your cell phone. If you are honestly 
searching for an alternative energy source, there are many more possible 
applications to consider, even in the aerospace industries.</p> 
<p>If your engineers and technicians can not figure out how to accomplish this 
from the concept that I have presented in my previous posts, I would be more 
than willing to demonstrate this solution in person, for a price. Of course, 
you could always practice the teachings of Toyota, and Gemba Research, and 
steal the ideas from your sources, and demonstrate a fundament lack of respect 
for the principle of diversity. While you&rsquo;re at it, make sure to erase 
all of these posts before anybody else can read them, and commit an act of 
piracy against you. (Edison vs. Tesla all over again?)</p> 
<p>I am not the one putting a government grant, or future sales, at risk. 
Also, understand that this system can replace a $12 billion nuclear reactor. 
Make your choice. Make an offer. Otherwise, I&rsquo;ve got no future, and 
I&rsquo;ve got nothing to loose. Do you?</p>

negotiation or decision making process. Wouldn&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

<p>BShumberger, What schematic? Where?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  CM  9:57pm | jul 2, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>BShumberger, our attention was elsewhere, we were not deliberately ignoring 
you, and we don't mean any disrespect. So, if I understand you correctly, your 
proposal is to use the drive motor to spin the alternator, which in turn would 
provide the electrical power for the motor? That is a very old idea, darn near 
every schoolboy thinks of that when they first learn of motors and generators.
</p> 
<p>Problem is, it takes some mechanical effort to produce electricity and the 
amount of mechanical effort needed is directly proportional to the electrical 
power produced. Try one of those hand cranked flashlights some time, and you'll 
see what I mean. If an alternator was connected to the driveshaft, the drive 
motor would have to work harder to mechanically power the alternator and the 
motor would require more electrical power, thus draining the batteries faster. 
Now, if both motor and alternator were perfect and 100% efficient, that 
alternator would produce exactly the same amount of extra power the motor 
needed, there would be no gain and no benefit at all! But it is worse than 
that, no motor or alternator is perfect, there is always some friction and 
electrical resistance wasting a small amount of power as heat. The result is, 
adding an alternator the way you propose would actually waste power and energy, 
reducing driving range and performance. Not a good idea, I'm afraid.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Ken  6:14pm | jul 6, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There can be improvement at many points in the charts. For example the 
charts show it is possible to gain efficiency at every point on the chart and 
the battery would only be needed during acceleration times. Efficiency could 
extend the batteries effectiveness during all other times extending the range 
of the battery and car to a few thousand miles per charge. For simple example 
during 'stop start driving' there could be secondary charge systems as in super 
capacitors that recharge in 9 seconds and can recharge millions of times, and 
these capacitors could play a dual role of being recharged by regenerative 
braking and actually driving the car in stop start traffic and traffic jams. 
These ultracapacitors would recharge a secondary offline battery system of 
perhaps lithium polymer batteries as well as driving the car. Lithium polymer 
can be shaped into any shape as it is a plastic. Like cup holders in the car or 
the passenger seats could be the lithium polymer batteries. Solar cells on the 
roof could also be continually charging these offline batteries which would be 
brought online when there is a need of driving range extension. With online and 
offline batteries and multiple recharging technologies and computer controlled 
continuous recharge technology the electric car coold go 10,000 miles at 80 
miles an hour without stopping. You just have to use your brain a bit and get 
your brain off off hydrocarbons (gasoline).</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  1:26pm | jul 7, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ken, 10000 miles without stopping at 80mph is just impossibility. 
Supercapasitors you suggest have very poor energy density, so they are poor 
solution to capture energy, also practical shape car uses about 10-15kW power 
at 60mph just to fight air resistance, at 80mph that is much worse. That one is 
power used that just can't be removed by improving efficiency. Efficiency can't 
go over 100%, and Roadster already is about as close to 100% as you can get. 
You always lose some power to air and rolling resistances as well as ancillary 
systems.</p> 
<p>Only way to extend range over battery capacity is to bring energy to car 
from outside of the car using something like solar panels. However solar panels 
are quite poor source to energy: roof covered with one would give something 
like 100-400W power, which is about 1-2% range extension and they are 
expensive. You gain more with just watching your power usage &quot;driving 
easy&quot;. There are other ways like inductive coils into road and that sort 
of things, but they just are too expensive and can't be used everywhere.</p> 
<p>Of course you could get huge range with huge battery, but that would also 
give you huge price-tag. In near future you can get batteries that give 1000 
mile range with reasonable price, but not quite yet.</p>

<p>1. First law of thermodynamics</p> 
<p> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change forms.<br>

 In any process, the total energy of the universe remains the same.</p> 
<p>2.Second law of thermodynamics</p> 
<p> The entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase 
over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium.A way of thinking about 
the second law for non-scientists is to consider entropy as a measure of 
disorder. So, for example, a broken cup has less order (more entropy) than an 
intact one, and it is more difficult to repair a broken cup (reducing its 
entropy) than to break an intact one (increasing its entropy). Likewise, solid 
crystals, the most organized form of matter, have very low entropy values; and 
gases, which are very disorganized, have high entropy values.</p> 
<p>In all mechanical systems there is friction which converts mechanical 
energy into heat.</p>

<p>The key is as you say of ultra capacitors having low density. There are 
research labs working on this for quite a while whith the low density 
ultracapacitors being recharged very quickly because of low density and then 
using these capacitors to recharge high density lithium batteries for example. 
This is actually the key. So this is being done. Vast amounts of energy can be 
moved using these ultra capacitors or even trickle charges. This is being done 
and is well known in the research community. If you are tripping over the

notebook thin computers they did not believe it. IBM thought there would only 
be 100 or so mainframe computers in the world total. They needed to think some 
more.</p>

<p>Ken, ultracaps are more useful than ordinary regenerative braking only at 
emergency braking-fast energy gains. Tesla Roadster engine can convert energy 
at about 200kW power, which, if utilized fully, would cause wheels to lose 
grip. Just ordinary regen braking is quite enough. You could gain slightly more 
by adding hub-motors to front wheels too, but not much more. Ultracaps are 
heavy, so if you use them to capture energy you might actually lose range 
because of increased rolling resistance.</p> 
<p>Problem with range is not efficiency (if you look at the top of this page, 
only drivetrain losses are something that can get significantly smaller). 
Problem is energy storage. That storage needs to be high energy density 
batteries, otherwise you just don't have enough energy to get anywhere.</p> 
<p>Range comes from energy storage capacity / energy losses at certain speed. 
Even if we eliminate all drivetrain losses you would still have air resistance, 
rolling and ancillary losses, and with Roadster at 80 mph you would still use 
about 250Wh/mile which translates to about 220 mile range.</p> 
<p>Only practical way to radically increase range is to get higher energy 
density cheap energy storage system. Efficiency increase is, of course, 
welcome, but it just wouldn't increase range much because current systems are 
already quite energy efficient.</p>

<p>Since batteries do not last &quot;forever&quot; and have their cycle of

<p>To Tesla Engineering and top dogs there:</p> 
<p>I contacted Fortum (Finnish/Swedish energy company) in order to question if 
there are any of the charging points they are building between my home and my 
parents home and what voltages and amps they use. Answer was that they are 
currently using 1~ phase (230V /16A) ja 3~ phase (400V / 16A) and there is not 
any yet, but they also informed me that, and now the important point:</p> 
<p>There is Europe-wide standardisation for those going on, and they think 
that they get it done by the end of the year.</p> 
<p>They are also investigating techs that allow very rapid charging (10 min 
charging was mentioned, but not how big battery pack could be recharged that 
fast). No specifics were told.</p> 
<p>In case you are not aware of this development I think you should contact 
Fortum (http://www.fortum.com). This could affect your Europe sales quite a 
bit. You should definitely have compatible system with them for Europe models.

 Presently replacement battery pricing is part of the purchase

replacement period is 7 years. By then, battery tech may have changed 
significantly, though.</p>

 Main text: &quot;just the opposite it true!&quot; 
--&gt; &quot;just the opposite is true!&quot;<br>
 Timo: &quot;hydrogen 
molecyle is basically just two protons surrounded by two electrons, &quot; No, 
that's helium. Hyrdrogen is half the size. And &quot;molecycle&quot; --&gt; 
&quot;molecule&quot;. But I do wonder what it would be like to ride around on a 
molycycle! ;)<br>
 Anatoly; it's spelled &quot;efficiency&quot;. No esses in 
the word, please! About battery cost: at $12,000 per 100,000 mile pack, that's 
$0.12/mile, which is indeed quite a bit. Costs will have to drop. Of course, 
perhaps that comparison should be made against the cost of maintenance and 
depreciation for an ICE car for 100,000 miles.</p> 
<p>Timo again: battery &quot;form factors&quot; are much more easily matched 
than internal design. Better Place (
http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/05/better-place/ ) now claims its swap 
stations are versatile enough to cope with a number of types. (40 seconds 
fastest so far, btw.) Ultimately, ownership of the batteries would be part of 
the dealer/recharge system, so that the car owner would not care so much about 
the condition of the new pack he was getting each swap, as long as it had 
enough charge to get where he needs to go.<br>
 Daniel: aero drag; maybe car 
skins should take a page from the new swim suits that use fine grooves the 
length of the body (&quot;shark skin&quot;).<br>
 Rachel; Detroit auto workers 
have been rooned by gen'rashuns of union membership. Minimum work for maximum 
pay is not compatible with the mentality of a world-challenging startup.<br>
 
TJD; about affording one: the $50,000 Model S would lease and run for about the 
same total cost as a $30,000 ICE car.<br>
 Carl; air ram -- only suggested 
about 50 times. Problem: costs more energy to overcome its addition to drag 
than it can generate. Consult works by Newton for the reasons.<br>
 Timo; the 
Nature article basically says that electric resistance and charge result from 
movement in a magnetic field, and that a way has been found to translate 
&quot;spin&quot; motion into EM motion, hence into charge. So storing and 
draining spin could create an energy-dense battery setup, or sensitive 
detection devices. I think.</p>

<p>Hydrogen *molecule* is two protons surrounded by two electrons. Helium 
doesn't from molecules, it is noble gas and chemically inert, it also contains 
two neutrons in addition to two protons. Hydrogen *atom* is single proton 
surrounded by single electron. As a full atom hydrogen and helium are nearly 
same size, because most of the size comes from electrons that surround that 
atom. However, hydrogen can lose its single electron quite easily which leaves 
only proton, and that is then a lot smaller than full atom.</p> 
<p>&quot;y&quot; in molecule was just a typo.</p>

<p>If we estimate that you go to change oils, spark plugs etc. in every about 
5000 miles and average cost of maintenance is about $200 more than BEV you get 
$4000. If car consumes about 17mpg (BMW 750i, comparable to Model S) you have 
5882 gallons used for 100,000 miles and average one gallon costs about $2.7 
(which is really cheap compared to our 1.25 euros / liter) you have $15882. 
Roadster uses about 250Wh/mile so 100,000 miles you have used 25000 kWh. If one 
kWh costs about 10 cents that is $2500. 15882 - 2500 = 13382.</p> 
<p>Combined $17,382. BEV is cheaper, but not that much cheaper. Also paying 
that $12,000 at any one time is too much for many people. Fortunately battery 
tech is advancing and it can be assumed that those prices go down quite a bit 
in near future.</p>

<p>That is still double to 20secs that it takes to plug your car in and out of 
a charger. What happens between those doesn't count because you use that mostly 
at home at night and in longer road trips when you are taking a break anyway. 
In longer road trip it doesn't matter if it takes 40 seconds or one hour if you 
use it maybe once a year. Battery swapping just isn't viable business, there 
will be too few customers to keep it alive. It might be viable *now* when 
batteries have still too low energy density to give 600+ mile range with 
reasonable price. That changes soon: making 180kWh battery pack from that 
prototype 540Wh/kg battery would weight 333kg which makes it about 100kg 
smaller than Roadster battery pack (90kWh should give 300 mile range to Type S 
-size car).</p>

<p>CM,</p> 
<p>Check this out:<br>
 As you read this, think of my transmission concept as 
the &quot;mechanical&quot; version of a rocket engine.<br>
 No matter how fast 
a rocket is moving the thrust(force applied) to the rocket is the same. The 
thrust(force applied) to the rocket is independent of the rocket's speed.<br>
 
In my transmission concept(AST) the torque(rotational force) applied to the 
wheels is independent of the wheel's rotational speed (rpm).<br>
 The torque 
available is the torque applied regardless of the wheel's rotational speed 
(rpm). There is no need to run the motor as fast as the wheel as in a direct 
drive transmission and no gearing up to reach the wheels' speed. I know it 
sounds impossible but believe me it can be done.</p> 
<p>Contrary to popular belief - It is NOT the &quot;battery storage&quot; that 
needs to be increased to obtain greater range in &quot;All Electric&quot; 
vehicles. I know It is logical to think that because electric motors are 
already 90+% efficient the answer must be to increase the energy source 
(battery storage) however the engineers are completely ignoring one important 
part of the whole system and that is the &quot;method&quot; in which the 
mechanical energy developed be the electric motor(which is very efficient) is 
&quot;transmitted&quot; to the vehicle. In other words the TRANSMISSION!</p> 
<p>Again it is logical for them to think there can be no improvement in that 
area because directly driven electric motors are very efficient through their 
entire working range and any tweaking in efficiency can be done by the use of a 
CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission). This is were they are again mistaken.
</p> 
<p>There is a far superior method of applying available torque to a system 
that is rotating at a much higher rpm and I call it an AST (All Speed 
Transmission). When integrated with an electric motor as one unit I call it an 
ASTM (All Speed Transmission Motor). The ASTM can apply a low rpm torque to a 
higher rpm system(wheels) as if it were &quot;standing still&quot;. In other 
words, regardless of, and independent of, the wheels rotational speed (rpm) as 
in the &quot;rocket's thrust&quot; example. This would be like peddling a 
bicycle at 40 miles per hour and every time you peddle you could apply the same 
torque that you had in 1st gear (by the way that can and will be done but 
that's another application). But can you imagine what that means to a vehicle 
propulsion system? It would mean much smaller motors could be used and still 
achieve adequate performance resulting in far greater range on far less battery 
storage. Still think it's not possible? Someone once said &quot;Everything is 
easy, when someone shows you how&quot;. I can show you how.</p> 
<p>Believe me this is not a &quot;something for nothing&quot; concept or 
contraption that contradicts the laws of physics or a &quot;perpetual 
motion&quot; dream. It is a solid, physically feasible, unique method of 
applying torque that has never been done before but can accomplish what I have 
described.</p> 
<p>I believe the ASTM propulsion system is the answer to the &quot;All 
Electric&quot; vehicle's range problem. There's no need to spend time that we 
don't have on development of better and/or cheaper batteries that aren't need. 
All of our American automotive models could be &quot;All Electric&quot; right 
now with the ASTM propulsion system.</p> 
<p>American's would dominate the world in automotive manufacturing, thousands 
would go back to work and we would end our oil dependency and over usage. And 
we would show the world that American Ingenuity is alive and well and always 
will be.</p>

<p>To all &quot;mystical range improvement device&quot; - suggestions:</p> 
<p>You can figure out your range simply by measuring losses at any given speed 
and divide your power supply with that figure. As simple as that. You can read 
those figures for Roadster from the top of this page.</p> 
<p>There are no mystical ways to get energy from nothing, all energies come 
from some energy source. In BEV it is battery.</p> 
<p>Improvements in efficiency are always welcome, but in machine that already 
has nearly lossless system any improvement in efficiency wont generate much 
more range. Even if you eliminate *ALL* losses from system itself 
(impossibility) you would still have aerodynamic and rolling resistances as 
well as ancillary systems that generate losses. Those alone make it impossible 
to hugely improve car range without getting better power supply.</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Wayne P. Bishop: Your &quot;rocket engine&quot; analogy is flawed. The 
thrust of a rocket engine is determined by a simple formula, M*V^2, where M is 
the Mass of the exhaust, V is the exhaust Velocity, and ^2 means the velocity 
is squared. The speed of the rocket doesn't affect the thrust, as the exhaust 
velocity is measured in relation to the rocket itself, not anything outside the 
rocket. Note that a rocket is a self-contained system, it does not need to 
&quot;push against&quot; anything outside it, which is why it works fine in the 
vacuum of space. A car is different, it relys on friction with the road to 
provide the &quot;thrust&quot;, the slipperiness of the surface makes a big 
difference, it relys on the road and is not &quot;self-contained&quot;. For the 
rocket analogy to work, the car &quot;thrust&quot; would have to be independent 
of the road and determined solely by torque and rotational speed of the wheels, 
which is obviously not the case, otherwise the speed of the car would have no 
relation to the rotational speed of the wheels! (well, maybe on a very icy 
road...)</p> 
<p>Power in a mechanically rotating system is determined by the formula T*R, 
where T is Torque and R is rotational velocity. Any system that increases the 
RPMs without changing the power must reduce the torque, and vice versa. So, any 
system with a high torque low RPM input and a high RPM output must also have a 
low torque output as well. So, your hypothetical &quot;All Speed 
Transmission&quot; with a high torque low RPM input would have a high RPM low 
torque output. Sorry, no way around that, it applies to any sort of mechanical, 
hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical transmission design. You've made an 
extraordinary claim, and I'll need to see extraordinary proof from you before 
I'll believe. If you can prove your impossible claim, you''ll be a serious 
contender for a Nobel Prize in physics.</p> 
<p>Power consumption of an electric motor is determined by the power output, 
T*R, not just the torque only. There is no real efficiency advantage to a 
&quot;high torque low RPM only&quot; design, except perhaps for a fraction less 
friction, and that advantage would be lost to friction in any variable speed 
transmission.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  1:30am | jul 21, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Wayne P. Bishop: your idea of constant torque would be useful, except for 
one small thing: Electric motor torque curve is already flat from 0-several 
thousand RPM. Your transmission idea would be good for very fast speeds (RPMs) 
where emotor torque starts to decline, but for Roadster-type torque range it 
doesn't matter much.</p> 
<p>Also applying constant torque does not mean that you get any further, it 
only means that force that accelerates tires and fights losses is constant, and 
you get maxed acceleration which still slows down when aerodynamic drag and 
rolling resistances start to climb up. Torque alone only tells you how fast car 
can accelerate, not how far it can go. You still have losses which increase 
with speed and limited energy supply, which tells how far your car can go.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  2:53am | jul 21, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To engineering:</p> 
<p>I'm curious about similar data for Type S. You don't need to include range, 
because batteries will develop still, but base losses are my interest.</p> 
<p>Type S looks more &quot;slippery&quot; than Roadster, but is also bigger 
car. From some webpage I got an impression that 300 mile version has 85kWh 
battery pack. Using data from this page shows that for constant 60mph speed 
Roadster needs 75kWh pack to get that same range. That means that Type S has 
about 12-13% bigger losses. Aerodynamic or rolling? Looking more slippery could 
mean that aerodynamic doesn't increase as much, but being heavier would mean 
rolling resistances do increase. That would also mean that there might be some 
high speed treshold where Type S has actually more range than Roadster (rolling 
resistances stay relatively constant, while air resistance is exponential). 
Which speed would that be? 85mph? 125mph? 200mph? speed of sound?</p> 
<p>Any improvements in range or speeds or somesuch for 2.0 version of 
Roadster? At least PEM is smaller (fox news report), which intuitively would 
mean better efficiency, weight and thus range.</p>

<p>i may know of a way to increase range! the only place i have found 
capacitors is onwww.overstock.com but they are advertised for car stereo 
equipment. they have built in regulators and most are shaped like a regular car 
battery. this would be great in combination with a power source like solar 
since less weight means less power loss. also, how about forward motion or the 
engine's rotation rotating a generator head to keep a charge continuously. 
there are also low light solar panels on the way. even if the capacitors with 
regulators are not purchased from overstock they could be manufactured since 
the tech is there.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>I have what I believe is a symbiotic add on technology that will help solve 
one of your most pressing battery engineering needs of substantially increased 
range.</p> 
<p>By adapting your best current vehicles to accept a tracked overhead mobile 
umbilical power feed cable capable of not only powering your EV, but also 
charging your batteries while you are attached to this overhead dollie lane 
built into the national freeway arteries.</p> 
<p>Such overhead feed lanes could be built for both passenger vehicles and 
separate EV semi-trucks like the new ones at Long Beach harbor.</p> 
<p>It's almost as simple as building an upside down elevated Hot Wheels slot 
car track, then hanging retractable power feeds from them and plugging it into 
your EV below it. The small overhead dollie would track and pace the EV below, 
capable of emergency disconnect via signal or tension on the umbilical tether 
reel above on the dollie.</p> 
<p>The best aspect of such a system is the logical expectation that the 
federal and state highway depts would be obliged to build the umbilical dollie 
grids into our interstate system, and that your product can adapt to it with 
minimum modifications to it.</p> 
<p>The guys that run the Mammoth Mountain ski resort are interested in 
building a very basic overhead umbilical dollie run that can power electric 
mountain bikes going up their ski runs in the summer months.</p> 
<p>It can be done quite easily with current technology, becoming a new X-treme 
game sport that's all electric.</p> 
<p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated guys!</p>

<p>Played around a bit with that excel sheet which you can download here. 
Increased battery to 85kWh and rolling resistance from around 55 to 85Wh/mil to 
get 300 miles at 60mph. That should be what type S is close about.</p> 
<p>I also searched shortest road to my desination which turned out to be 589.4 
km or around 370 miles. Using that excel I found out that I need average 46mph 
speed to get there. Since that was shortest, not fastest route that means speed 
limits are mainly 62.5 and 50 mph with some pretty slow parts (37.5 mph or 
slower) here and there. If I drive around 56.2 and 44 mph at those faster 
sections of those roads and don't pass ANY cars and generally use regen at 
every opportunity at slower parts of the road trip I might actually manage to 
get to my destination with just 300 mile EPA range. Might. There would not be 
any margin for error.</p> 
<p>So close. Please, PLEASE get a slightly bigger battery pack as an option. I 
want your car. Even 350 mile EPA range would be sufficient. I would just need 
to drive slowly to get to my destination. I hope battery tech has advanced so 
that 400 mile range battery is option when your car is available here.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Jon Mooring; Your idea for once is doable, though not very practical.</p> 
<p>First: Electric cars use quite a bit power going in those roads, so 
electric current going in those power feed cables would have to be very high 
and that causes a lot of losses if you are not using also very high voltages, 
which increases catastrophic accident possibility.</p> 
<p>Second: It costs a lot of money to build and maintain such infrastructure.
</p> 
<p>Third: Cars are not alike. Big truck can be over four meters high, while 
Tesla Roadster is hardly one meter. That means that Roadster would have to drag 
at least five meter high tether with it, and in tight situations (emergency 
brake, passing other car, need to evade something onto road etc.) forces that 
apply to that tether and connectors would be extreme. And just by inertia and 
aerodynamic drag it causes it would make driving quite hard which makes it less 
safe. Think about what happens if that five-meter tether disconnects from 
Roadster at high speeds. Disconnecting would cause tether to swing. If that was 
freeway and there was another bigger car next to that Roadster that could cause 
that tether to hit that car, maybe with catastrophic results.</p> 
<p>Easier would be build inductive coils under pavement and get power from 
there, but that also has problems one and two, and I think problem two is the 
main concern here. There have been huge amount of scientific research going how 
to make roads better and traffic more safe, but most of them just aren't viable 
because it just costs too much. And many of them are just daydreams of people 
that don't drive themselves, making their suggestions those that rip out your 
freedom of driving.</p> 
<p>If you want &quot;ecological&quot; transportation use electric train. I do, 
but halibut that's boring.</p>

<p>To JB Straubel or anyone involved with powertrain development at Tesla,</p> 
<p>With reference to my comment on July 19, 2009</p> 
<p>Thanks Timo and CM for your resent comments concerning my ASTM (All Speed 
Transmission Motor) concept.<br>
 However I'd like to give special thanks to CM 
for this comment - &quot;You&rsquo;ve made an extraordinary claim, and 
I&rsquo;ll need to see extraordinary proof from you before I&rsquo;ll believe. 
If you can prove your impossible claim, you'll be a serious contender for a 
Nobel Prize in physics&quot;. ( I'll remember that when I except the award.) 
lol But seriously CM you at least showed an open mind enough to say you would 
like to see proof before you would believe it. I commend you sir. Anyway, the 
fact is I CAN show(prove) how it is possible to apply a low rpm torque(motor) 
to a higher rpm system(wheels) with approximately the same torque (some losses 
due to friction,etc). I know from a power standpoint of T*R it doesn't make 
sense or even seem possible but I have figured out a way to do it. And because 
the ASTM's low rpm output torque can be applied to the vehicle wheels when at 
speed(with NO gearing up) you will save the energy that is now needed(wasted) 
just to get the motor up to the wheel's speed even before it can begin to apply 
torque to the moving wheels. Lower rpms not only saves energy, which extends 
range, but as an added benefit reduces or even eliminates motor 
&quot;whine&quot;. Runs quiet yet torque is there.<br>
 Let me know if Tesla is 
interested in learning more about the ASTM propulsion technology. Take care all.

<p>Why recharge at all? Why not just design a car so that a depleted battery 
pack could be swapped out for a fresh battery pack in the same amount of time 
it takes to fill a car with gas? Instead of or in addition to charging 
stations, have swap stations where one drives a car into a station similar to 
an automated car wash. The system positions the car, deploys some mechanical 
means of removing the depleted battery pack and installing a fresh pack. Then 
the driver is on their way in a couple of minutes. Depleted battery packs could 
go to a recharging center powered by solar and/or wind energy. Then, there is 
no fossil fuel being used at all.</p> 
<p>I can see one issue with this being a situation where a battery pack still 
has some power left but not enough to reach a destination. Then a driver would 
be swapping out a battery pack that still has some power left and may feel like 
some of the power they paid for is being wasted. Perhaps a swap station could 
measure any power left in the existing battery pack and reduce the payment for 
the fresh battery pack accordingly</p> 
<p>I envision the charge for a battery swap being just a few dollars - the $4 
the FAQ says is the average cost of the electricity that goes into charging a 
battery pack plus a profit margin. I would think it would be far less then the 
cost of filing up a car with gas.</p>

 The only lights that would be 
necessary to have in non-LED are the xenon headlights/bixenon. However, maybe 
you can<br>
 manage somehow to use the high mca LED's and some focusing method 
to replace the xenon? That would give you another few miles at nighttime. Just

<p>The overhead umbilical dollie would be powered itself, not pulled along by 
the EV. The power feed cable coming down off the dollie would retract onto a 
reel on the dollie in the event of an emergency disconnect, be it tension 
related or signal related. The dollie would then continue on by itself to the 
next exit in need of dollies at the next freeway on ramp automatically, leaving 
you and your EV on battery power to proceed where you will.</p> 
<p>I envision each dollie reel having up to 25 feet of power cord on it's 
reel. I also envision an electro magnetic coupling system allowing for 
automatic connect and disconnect to or from the dollie.</p> 
<p>The California Air Resources Board has already expressed an interest in 
checking out the basic subscale system if and when it gets built at Mammoth 
Mountain for uphill electric powered mountain bike runs on a designated course. 
I believe CARB's primary interest in this umbilical dollie system is for 
powering electric semi-trucks in the two righthand slow lanes on California 
freeways.</p> 
<p>These overhead umbilical dollies can even be designed to change lanes in 
much the same manner that trains can change tracks.</p> 
<p>The potential of this overhaed umbilical system to substantially reduce our 
dependence on fossil fuels and promote widescale use of EV cars and semi-trucks 
here in CA deserves serious consideration in my humble opinion Timo.</p>

<p>Your ASTM isn't just keeping torque it is mystically generating energy from 
nowhere. Basically you are claiming that you have invented perpetual motion 
machine. That is why CM said that comment about Nobel Prize.</p> 
<p>Think about it: if you can keep torque and increase RPM in same time you 
are generating more power, which means more energy.</p> 
<p>So lets start with lets say 15W electric engine that runs with high torque 
and low RPM. Here comes your magical transmission and changes that to high RPM 
without losing torque. Now, attach a normal transmission which increases torque 
and drops RPM back to what it was by normal gearing and use that to run 20W 
generator. Now you only need to loop that and you get perpetual machine that 
gives out 5W power. Repeat as many times as you want.</p> 
<p>You can start with hand-cranked 5W motor and end up giving energy to entire 
world.</p> 
<p>Call me sceptic, but I don't think so.</p>

<p>Timo:<br>
 Referring to your statement when you said - &quot;Think about 
it: if you can keep torque and increase RPM in same time you are generating 
more power, which means more energy.&quot; and that is like getting energy from 
nothing and I understand that. And I agree with you. However how do you explain 
this. If you have a wheel with say two small rocket jets located at opposite 
sides so as when they thrust they put say a 10 ft-lb torque on the wheel. As 
you said, or know, the rockets will always apply the same thrust(and therefore 
torque) to the wheel regardless of it's rpm. It has 10ft-lbs of torque on it at 
0 rpms and at 100 rpms and at thousand (1000) rpms right? Then where did all 
that extra energy come from when it is now at 1000 rpms with the same torque. 
The rockets are burning(expending) the same amount of fuel every second and 
thrusting with the same force, and therefore the same torque, as it did at the 
lower rpms and even at 0 rpms. Where does the extra energy(power) come from due 
to higher rpms? I am really asking because this has me puzzled and wish 
somebody could explain it to me. What I'm I missing? help!</p>

<p>Justin Smith: Tesla engineers are aware of capacitors and their 
limitations. Capacitors are good a providing brief bursts of power, but their 
energy storage is very limited, far less than any battery. Adding capacitors 
would add weight without adding much range. A car sized solar panel would 
produce just enough power to run a cooling fan, not enough power to justify the 
high cost. If the cost comes down and performance improves, that might change.
</p> 
<p>The Tesla Roadster already has a way of converting forward motion into 
electricity by converting the drive motor into an alternator. It's called 
&quot;regenerative braking&quot; and is used every time the car needs to slow 
down - but it wouldn't do to drive around with the regenerative brakes on!</p> 
<p>Jon Mooeing: You have an interesting new variation on an old idea. 
Providing power from overhead lines has long been applied to trains, and 
electric busses in places like San Francisco. If the expense of building and 
maintaining they system isn't excessive, it could be economically successful, 
but the main drawback would be getting political support and loud complaints 
about &quot;ugly wires blocking the view&quot;.</p> 
<p>A similar proposal would use overhead &quot;tow-motors&quot; to literally 
pull vehicles along the road, usable to any &quot;towable&quot; vehicle. Other 
variations would hide the power supply in a guardrail alongside the road, or 
use electromagnet coils buried in the roadway to transfer power by induction, 
or even use a linear motor drive embedded in the road to propel the cars.</p> 
<p>Another idea is to use &quot;powered guideways&quot; that would isolate the 
vehicles from pedestrians and regular traffic, and fully automated to provide 
convenient, safe, rapid and efficient transportation between cities. Just drive 
to the nearest guideway entrance, punch in your destination, then you could 
relax, read, play games or snooze until you got to your designated offramp, 
where you'd once again take control and drive to your final destination. For 
more information on various &quot;dual mode&quot; proposals, see:<br>

http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/dualmode.htm </p> 
<p>Brian Covault: Tesla Motors is considering a &quot;swappable battery&quot; 
for their upcoming Model S, as it would certainly be a fast and convenient 
&quot;refill&quot; when on a long trip. A company called &quot;Project Better 
Place&quot; is also designing an EV battery swap system, though I don't know if 
Tesla is cooperating with PBP on it. The car owner would lease the battery from 
the &quot;swap company&quot;, and when needed would just swap one leased 
battery for another, charged only for a &quot;swap fee&quot; and the charge of 
electricity, and credited with any remaining charge in the old battery.</p> 
<p>For everyday local driving it would be more convenient and cheaper to just 
plug-in to recharge at home or any &quot;park and charge&quot; lot, rather than 
have to drive out of your way the nearest battery swap station. By the way, 
Tesla plans to install high powered &quot;45 minute max&quot; charging outlets 
for the Model S, perfect for the traveller - just stop at a hiway diner with a 
&quot;fast Park and Charge&quot; lot, take a break, have lunch or a snack, and 
when you're ready to go again, so is the car!</p> 
<p>The Roadster didn't include a &quot;swappable&quot; battery, as it was 
enough of a challenge just to make this new type of battery pack work right, 
without having to worry about swapping.</p>

<p>I'd like to take modest little babysteps with my smart dollie overhead rail 
system by building a small subscale example course on Mammoth Mountain that 
powers electric mountain bikes up ski runs. Ideally two side by side course 
runs would enable two riders to compete in the sporting event sense of a timed 
uphill race.</p> 
<p>I think it would be a commercially viable means of showing the CARB 
officials the system's potential for interstate applications for both 
semi-trucks and passenger EVs.</p> 
<p>A new x-treme biking event utilising clean electric full suspension 
mountain bikes in California would sure help raise the awareness of EV 
potential in our younger generation.</p> 
<p>The electric bike's power to weight ratio would certainly make for a 
thrilling uphill ride, complete with all natural rushes of adrenalin.</p> 
<p>We need to show the public that clean new EV technology is superior to 
yesterday's polluting relics in every sense, faster, lighter, better handling 
and quieter.</p> 
<p>Once CARB is convinced the system works and could be applied to our 
interstates, it becomes a symbiotic relationship between the state, private EV

<p>Wayne P. Bishop,</p> 
<p>What you are illustrating is constant acceleration made by constant torque. 
It is true that it is possible to increase RPM without increasing use of force, 
eMotor does that for wide range of RPM.</p> 
<p>Torque is pretty close to force IE. F=ma, which gives a=F/m, only that in 
torque F is now force that causes change in angular velocity which depends of 
radius of the rotating object. t=rF or F (force causing radial acceleration) = 
t (torque) / r (radius of the wheel).</p> 
<p>Now this gets a bit confusing: When you apply power to the motor (floor the 
accelerator or in your case fire the rockets) input power is constant and you 
get constant torque, but output energy is not constant and is increasing in the 
rotating wheel. You are transferring energy from those rockets to that wheel 
that accelerates. The faster it goes, the more energy it gains. In car that 
manifests itself in increased kinetic energy of the car itself.</p> 
<p>I think there is what confuses you: with your rockets you are applying 
constant power, but because energy is power * time you are not applying 
constant energy.</p> 
<p>Problem with your transmission claim is that you are claiming that you can 
do that with transmission which does not apply any power source like those 
rockets in your example. When you increase RPM with transmission you lower 
torque output that input power source is giving you. In a way you are 
decreasing radius of the rotating object: same thing as when you use your 
bicycle and switch to larger rear cogwheel to smaller one in order to increase 
rear wheel RPM without needing to increase input RPM. t=rF and if r gets 
smaller t gets smaller too. Or if we include power in calculation P=t*angular 
speed or P(kW)=(t(Nm)*2pi*RPM)/6000. As you can see we can't increase RPM 
without increasing P unless we also decrease t.</p> 
<p>In theory (not in real life) it could be possible to build electric engine 
that does not lose any torque at any RPM which would mean constant acceleration 
force at any speed. Note that because there is friction which increases as 
speed increases that would not mean that you could accelerate from 60-120 as 
fast as you could go from 0-60.</p> 
<p>I know this is quite confusing. force/torque/power/work/energy etc. and 
their relationships are not always easy to understand.</p>

<p>To engineering: About touch screens.</p> 
<p>Have you tested how well those touch-screens behave in very cold climates 
when car has been parked for some time? Both Type S and Roadster utilize 
touch-screens for multitude of functions (including typing PIN-code to start 
it). If temperature is somewhere in -25C region do those work at all? I kind of 
don't trust on touch-screens in cold weathers. Do I need to carry portable 
hair-dryer in order to melt that touch screen first before I can start the car?
</p> 
<p>In Type S that center console touch-screen is huge. I would prefer more 
standard set of controls so that I know where my hand is without needing to 
look at. It is safer that way. Could you provide Type S without touch-screen 
controls for AC/fans/radio/stereo etc? It looks cool but I'm not convinced that 
it is practical. In fact I believe it to be anything but practical. Screens 
should be mainly for information, controls should be accessible without needing 
to look at what you are doing.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Wayne Bishop:</p> 
<p>&quot;The rockets are burning(expending) the same amount of fuel every 
second and thrusting with the same force, and therefore the same torque, as it 
did at the lower rpms and even at 0 rpms. Where does the extra energy(power) 
come from due to higher rpms?&quot;</p> 
<p>The energy comes from the continuous burning of rocket fuel. It causes the 
rocket propelled wheel to rotate at an accelerating rate increasing its kinetic 
energy. That is the same effect that a rocket has on propelling a missile to 
higher and higher speeds increasing its kinetic energy. It does not matter at 
what rate the fuel is being burnt. The more fuel burnt the more energy is 
generated in the form of higher speed motion or increased kinetic energy.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  David Noland  9:49am | jul 31, 2009

<p></p> 
<p>I got a chance to test-drive a Roadster recently, and was very impressed. 
But it has one driving trait that I hope is not passed on to the Model S (I am 
customer #717 for the S). That is the rather high built-in regen braking that 
occurs when you take your foot off the gas. It feels like very pronounced 
engine braking, like when you wind out a gas-powered car in a low gear, and 
then back off the throttle:</p> 
<p>I would very much like to see a driver-adjustable 
&quot;engine-braking&quot; regen setting for the Model-S. Set it high for 
performance driving, low for regular driving. Long downhill ahead? Turn it to 
just the right setting. Heck, turn it off altogether and coast. Some might 
argue that we need every bit of regen braking, but I don't see how this kind of 
aggressive built-in regen helps all that much--if the excessive regen causes a 
more rapid deceleration than you want , you just have to step on the gas to get 
back to the speed you wanted to go, using up the regenerated power. With regen 
turned off, you get no regen, but on the other hand the car coasts along and 
doesn't need more engine power to maintain speed.</p> 
<p>It seems to me that the best kind of regen braking is that generated by the 
brake pedal--which the Roadster doesn't have. This is a major design flaw. Even 
the Prius has brake-pedal-actuated regen braking. I hear that one problem the 
Prius has is rusty brake rotors; driven gently, the car virtually never uses 
its brakes to stop.</p> 
<p>So here's my plea for you Model S engineers: pedal-actuated regen brakes, 
plus a driver-adjustable built-in &quot;auto&quot; regen to simulate the feel 
of engine braking when you back off the throttle.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  4:33pm | jul 31, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Got an idea.</p> 
<p>This might cost a bit to produce, but all the components are here already:
</p> 
<p>Contract with Daimler and Tesla expertise of EV.</p> 
<p>How about we build few &quot;proof of concept&quot; EV:s for Formula 1 
pace/medical cars. That would have quite a bit marketing power. I expect that 
it would impact general public much more than anything else done this far.</p> 
<p>Traditionally for some time now those F1 pace-cars have been Mercedes-Benz 
AMG cars. Previously Tesla cars would have very slim chance to get there as 
pace-cars, but if you get Tesla components fitted in Mercedes as Tesla/Mercedes 
hybrid, it is much more possible.</p> 
<p>Reading from 
http://www.autoblog.com/2009/03/27/mercedes-benz-sl63-amg-returns-as-f1-... it 
seems that Roadster would have faster acceleration than what they are using 
now, but lower top speed. Because F1 race car top speed is way over 300km/h, 
and even average speeds can be over 200km/h pace car that goes only about 
200km/h would look like snail in front of fighter jets. In fact too slow pace 
car is dangerous to F1 cars, because they need speed to keep tire and brake 
temperatures high enough. Some improvement would need to be done for top speed. 
Also cornering speed needs to be quite high (that's where difference between 
ordinary car and F1 car is most obvious).</p> 
<p>Of course if you could use that 175kW/kg battery tech for 60mAh/g 
(180Wh/kg) batteries, power would not be a problem. Make 60kWh battery pack 
that could deliver something like 80000HP (not a typo, (60kW / 180W) * 175kW = 
58MW). You would only need PEM, transmission and eMotor that can handle around 
1MW power and you can have 300km/h top speed using 14kRPM single gear 
transmission without sacrificing acceleration.</p> 
<p>Of course then we have slight problem with 60kWh. Is that enough? 
Race-conditions are so much different than ordinary road conditions that I'm 
not able to estimate how long does that last. Also for pace-car how fast is 
fast enough? Do you need to accelerate entire Fuji-circuit nearly mile long 
straight, or would it be sufficient if you satisfy to around 250 top speed 
(Bernd Maylander says that he can reach 155mph at Silverstone straight with his 
pace car. That's slightly under 250km/h) How about regenerative braking? How 
much energy would you be able to collect back if you max that capability (which 
Roadster doesn't).</p> 
<p>I believe building a BEV pace car is entirely possible, but not very easy. 
It could be good advertising for EV:s in general, Mercedes-Benz and Tesla. (at 
least if it is made clear that that pace car has Tesla drivetrain).</p>

<p>Two replies about touchscreen in two days.</p> 
<p>To tomthemd: Touchscreen does not give you any feedback of where your hand 
is, ordinary controls do. It would be much harder to make adjustments to for 
example CD-player volume or cabin temperature setting if you don't even know 
what the setting is or where it is. Especially if that screen has multiple 
modes which means there is no fixed place for any control. I don't mind having 
that screen, I just don't like the idea that it replaces all ordinary center 
console controls.</p> 
<p>I also don't think touchscreen is eye-friendly in dark roads. Even bright 
backlight of ordinary speedometer gets annoying when you are driving in dark 
roads, not to mention something that is many times bigger and needs backlight 
to show you what you are doing. You should be able to turn it off and still be 
able to make adjustments to settings.</p> 
<p>Then there is that question about very cold weather. Does it function at 
all? How about adjusting something wearing gloves? How about with mittens? What 
is the freezing point of the screen?</p>

<p>Joe Simone:, CM:, Timo:, JB Straubel: Engineering:</p> 
<p>In response to your comment of July 31. I can understand the accumulation 
of kinetic energy depending on how much mass is involved which would mean how 
long it would take the rockets constant 10 ft. lb. torque to get the system to 
1000 rpms, however, what momentum(kinetic energy) you would have at 1000 rpms 
only comes into play when you are trying increase or decrease the systems rpms. 
The 10 ft.lbs. of constant torque from the rockets is still there at any rpm 
and if you apply a 10 ft. lb. load on it at any rpm it will remain at steady 
state at that rpm no matter what mass is involved and if that rpm is a steady 
1000 rpms with a 10 ft. lb. load you can gear it down with a 10-1 ratio and 
then you would now have a system at 100 rpm with 100 ft. lbs. of torque but 
when the rockets SAME energy output was at 100 rpms it was still 10 ft. lbs. of 
torque. Doesn't that mean that, within the laws of physics, you can apply(not 
&quot;change to&quot; by gearing) the same torque at any rpm without needing 
more power? (fact- rockets do just that) Everyone sees how it is possible in 
rocket physics( which means it IS physically possible right? ) but when it 
comes to wheel-to-ground physics and they are now dealing with two separate 
frames of reference, they say it is now somehow &quot;mystical&quot; and, by 
the laws of physics, impossible. It is only &quot;mystical&quot; because they 
don't know how to do it not because it is impossible. With the AST (All Speed 
Transmission) I can &quot;apply&quot; an available torque (motor) directly to a 
higher rpm system (wheels) without gearing up to do so, which would decrease 
torque. It is possible within the laws of physics as seen in the rocket example 
and if it is &quot;possible&quot; it can be done but only if one can imagine 
HOW. I can show you how but unfortunately people have to believe it CAN be done 
before they will ask to be shown how.</p> 
<p>Just a side note if anyone at Tesla is interested:<br>
 I also have a 
concept for a TRUE &quot;positively driven&quot; IVT (Infinitely Variable 
Transmission) that I thought of prior to the AST concept when I was still 
thinking in terms of gears (ratios). Again it is NOT like any known CVT or IVT 
in development today. In other words it does NOT use cones, pulleys, 
belts(steel or otherwise) and is NOT planetary, Toroidal, or incrementally 
driven. My IVT is continually driven and easily infinitely varied while under 
HEAVY torque load. There is no slipping under heavy torque because it is 
&quot;directly&quot; driven. Whoever sees it will say &quot;OH, I see, THAT'S 
how to do it&quot; Another amazing feature inherent in it's design is that 
torque(from wheels) is transferred TO the transmission as the transmission is 
down ratiod but NOT from the transmission to the motor. However the motor 
remains connected to the transmission. This means the transmission, (that can 
take heavy loads), can be used entirely for breaking. If the transmission is 
ratiod to 0 the wheels will slide. Can you imagine 18 wheelers and automobiles 
with no breaks to ware out, burn up, or needing servicing? You know that would 
be worth a billion$ right there. Take care all. Wayne</p>

<p>CM,</p> 
<p>Thanks for your comments on battery swapping. If it's going to take longer 
to swap a battery pack including drive time than it does to charge at home and 
be more expensive too, I agree that charging is better, for the commuter anyway 
at the present time. I hope that changes in the future. Until it does, I hope 
the concept of charging can be sold to the public at large.</p> 
<p>The public at large is used to pulling into gas stations for fill ups that 
take a couple of minutes rahter commuting or taking a long drive. Whether 
charging or swapping, I think people are going to want a &quot;fill up&quot; of 
an electric car to take about the same amount of time whatever form that 
&quot;fill up&quot; takes. This is the age of instant gratification after all.
</p> 
<p>People could probably get used to charging if they could try it before they 
buy it. Getting folks to buy it wilhout trying it for several charges will not 
be easy especially when an electric costs more than a gas car, the battery pack 
does not last forever and I assume replacing a battery pack is not cheap.</p> 
<p>I've read about the 45 minute quick charge. That's certainly better than 
three to five hours and gives me hope that something like a five minute quick 
charge may be possible in the future.</p> 
<p>By the way, why is it a battery pack can be charged 80% in 45 minutes while 
a full charge takes three to five hours? I have yet to come across anything 
that explains that. Is there a heating issue with trying to quick charge to 
full capacity?</p>

polymer battery technology such as the technology used in Hyperion's G3 VX line:
http://www.allerc.com/product_info.php?products_id=4563<br>
 Right now it is 
changing the world of Radio Controlled hobbies, to the extent which there is no 
advantage to internal combustion power, the electric power systems outperform 
combustion in every way. If this were used in Tesla roadsters, the roadsters 
could charge and discharge much faster, weigh incredibly less, and could handle 
more cycles of charge.</p>

<p>You wrote: &quot;Doesn&rsquo;t that mean that, within the laws of physics, 
you can apply(not &ldquo;change to&rdquo; by gearing) the same torque at any 
rpm without needing more power&quot;</p> 
<p>And answer is &quot;yes&quot;. Electric motor already does this in very 
wide RPM range. I already said that in my first message. You can imagine 
electric motor as rockets at the wheel if you like. That is the source of the 
power output.</p> 
<p>However. If you move away from to power source and *then* change RPM you 
change torque.</p>

<p>Brian, I think your argument that people are wanting to charge immediately 
is already proven to be wrong by customer blog. It is enough to charge slowly 
at home to have full battery every morning. If you are wanting to drive very 
long road trip, then you just need larger operating radius. I think 600 mile 
radius is enough for that. With one hour-long break at some servicing station 
during that trip you get easily 300 mile or more (using current techs) which is 
then 15 hours of driving at 60 mph average speed + one hour break. 16 hours + 8 
hour night sleep = 24 hours.</p> 
<p>Just ask yourself: How many times have you driven over 600 miles without 
breaks? How long did those breaks take?</p> 
<p>About that five minute charging: it is not the battery that is limiting 
that in future, it is capability to safely transfer that much energy at that 
little time. 200kWh at five minutes needs 2.4MW connection. 2400V @ 1000A. 
Roadster uses internally something like 500A connections between engine and 
battery (375V connection to 185kW engine).</p>

<p></p> 
<p>XCraft: Hyperion&rsquo;s G3 VX line batteries are not especially high 
energy density batteries. I just calculated random few of them using that 
datasheet and got something like max 150Wh/kg, which is pretty much same as 
what Roadster is using now.</p> 
<p>HP-LG325-0850-3S 11.1V 850mAh 69g = 136Wh/kg<br>
 HP-LG325-2500-4S 14.8V 
2500mAh 266g = 139Wh/kg<br>
 HP-LG325-5000-7S 25.9V 5000mAh 856g = 151Wh/kg</p> 
<p>So no revolutionary batteries there.</p> 
<p>Tesla are monitoring new battery techs and will use combination of price, 
reliability (quality) cycle capacity and energy capacity as measurements of 
what to use. There is no point of changing those battery techs all of time 
(logistics, etc.), just do it when there is clearly better battery available.
</p> 
<p>There *IS* coming way better batteries (one prototype with 540Wh/kg already 
tested last year), so improvements are in horizon. Imagine Roadster with 800 
mile range, or over 200 kg lighter battery pack and still 400mile range. And it 
doesn't stop there. There are few techs that have theoretic capacity of over 
2kWh/kg. How about 3600miles? And that's not all, also power densities are 
improving, one of them allows 175kW/kg power density (meaning 200kg battery 
could give out 35MW meaning power to outrun nitrodragsters). And that's not 
all, you get this knife set ....oops. :-)</p>

<p>Timo,</p> 
<p>Then again there are messages in the blog speculating on future 
infrastructure in or above roadways to allow charging on demand as you drive 
which tells me at least some people would prefer not to stop and charge at all.
</p> 
<p>And then there is your last message about batteries on the horizon with far 
greater range. The horizon is really looking good.</p> 
<p>The question is, do you see us getting to the horizon without a lot more 
people buying the high end electric cars of today such as the Tesla cars? 
Today, I'm thinking the Model S with the 300 mile range option is almost 
overkill for commuting. Yet, if I want to take the family for a weekend get 
away to a major city three hours away, I'm not going to make it there and back 
on one charge. Where am I going to recharge? So, I'm going to need a $45K 
electric for commutes plus a $20K+ gas model for the longer hauls.</p> 
<p>If we can get just to the 600 mile range while the electric car is still a 
niche market, beyond 500 miles, many people would just fly anyway.</p> 
<p>I'm just trying to envision the path to mass market.</p>

<p>Wayne P. Bishop, your &quot;IVT&quot; sounds interesting, have you made a 
working model to test it? If so, you should consider getting it patented, 
because a reliable variable speed transmission that can handle high torque with 
no slippage has been the goal of automotive engineers for a century. If it 
works well, there are plenty of auto companies that would offer a lot of money 
for it. I'm not sure it would be a good idea to use it for regular braking, as 
locking up the wheels would trigger a skid. But it could make a good parking 
brake, though.</p> 
<p>It took me awhile to realize what was wrong with your &quot;rocket 
wheel&quot; analogy. As I pointed out, rockets are self-contained, their 
&quot;reaction mass&quot; is accelerated along with the rocket, enabling a 
constant thrust regardless of speed (but as the rocket fires, the mass it 
carries decreases so acceleration increases). The same is not true of electric 
motors or cars, both rely on outside materials for their &quot;reaction 
mass&quot;. If you run a motor by itself, not mechanically connected to any 
outside mass, it won't budge at all. Since the &quot;reaction mass&quot; isn't 
accelerated like it is for a rocket, neither wheel motor nor car can maintain 
constant torque or thrust the way a rocket can.</p> 
<p>Brian Covault, the time it takes to recharge a battery depends on 3 factors:
<br> 1) the amount of energy that is required. A partially discharged battery 
takes less time than a fully discharged battery.<br>
 2) The amount of power 
available. Power is the rate of flow of energy, higher power means more energy 
transferred in a given amount of time, meaning faster charging (assuming the 
batteries can handle the higher charging rate).<br>
 3) The power limitations 
of the batteries themselves. Some types of batteries can handle higher power 
than others, thus can be charged more quickly (assuming higher power is 
available).</p> 
<p>So how long it takes to recharge depends on which of those 3 is the 
limiting factor.</p> 
<p>The reason why a charge from 50% to 80% can take less time than a charge 
from 80% to 99% is that, for some batteries, internal resistance increases when 
it nears full charge. That requires a slower charge rate when it gets closer to 
maximum charge. An analogy would be like filling a bucket with a valuable 
liquid. At first, you could run the hose at a high flow, but when you got near 
the top you'd want to reduce the flow to avoid overfilling and spillage, that 
last little bit would take the longest.</p>

 What are you doing while you're at your 3-hour distant 
destination? If any of that time is spent parked, it could be used for a 
partial recharge. Anyway, 3 hours there and 3 hours back on the same day is a 
lot of driving for not much time at destination. I really wonder how frequent 
such trips are. In the real world, I suspect such problem situations are fairly 
rare. You can, of course, concoct any number of them from your imagination.</p>

 Are you at liberty to discuss any of the companies 
names for investment opportunities? About the batteries you are using now, I 
was under the impression that they were old fashioned laptop cells, is this 
true? That's why I assumed that the new lipo technology would provide better 
energy density and power output. Likewise, I would assume that A123 and Altair 
Nano's NanoSafe technology would be better as well.</p>

 2/ we have oil sands! ,which we use the last resources of

will just burn and cause more pollutants..<br>
 3/ If the oil disappears we 
will use our food resources to create more oil so we can burn it as gasoline 
and pollute the earth more.<br>
 4/ (already we are all too stupid to live)<br>

 4b/ As the pollutants in the air increase the pollutants go to the arctic 
areas making the ice black which will absorb sunlight making the earth hotter 
and melting the ice causing a two or more fold result of super storms that 
destroy the costal areas and the heating of the earth which will dry out and

<p></p> 
<p>Brian Covault:</p> 
<p>&quot;The question is, do you see us getting to the horizon without a lot 
more people buying the high end electric cars of today such as the Tesla 
cars?&quot;</p> 
<p>Not with current models, no. We need a bit more affordable models with at 
least 400-500 mile ranges to make real breakthrough. 400 miles is only about 
six and half hour drive which is still desirable. Longer and I would consider 
flying instead. I would imagine something like $30k car with 450 mile range 
would make real breakthrough for BEV. $57k Type S is still too expensive for 
just 300 miles. And I believe that 300 miles makes that price-tag a bit higher 
(somewhere in $65k I would guess). Then it is just matter of marketing so that 
general public gets aware of those cars.</p> 
<p>&quot;Yet, if I want to take the family for a weekend get away to a major 
city three hours away, I&rsquo;m not going to make it there and back on one 
charge. Where am I going to recharge?&quot;</p> 
<p>We need charger infrastructure, yes. That is not yet here. Capability is. I 
believe any roadside restaurant can charge cars with several kW connection 
(just 380V three phase @ 100A would be 38kW which would charge 300 mile worth 
in about two and a half hour). Because so much of the charging will be slow 
opportunity charging in places like workplace parking lot and home there is not 
much demand of those chargers except to draw people in. It definitely will not 
be like gas-stations where people might actually need to queue to get gas.</p> 
<p>I imagine situation for those slow charger points is worse in there than it 
is here in Finland. We need to use block heaters here in winter, so every other 
park space has one &quot;slow charger&quot; already installed.</p> 
<p>Three hour drive there and back is six times...lets make 70mph average 
speed so there is some margin... 6*70 = 420 miles. Electricity is available 
pretty much everywhere, so you can slow-charge in your destination. Even just 
110V@10A is 1.1kW. With that is takes you about 31 hours to charge that missing 
120 miles worth of 300 mile range (40% of 85kWh Type S battery = 34kWh). Two 
nights and some of the day. for Fri-Su that is two 10 hour nights and five 
hours daytime from fri and sa. Su is for driving back. (BTW, how much amps 
usual home connection has in US? In Europe we use 230V system, so my figures 
might be badly wrong). And if that is not fast enough then there might be 
higher wattage connection closeby in some restaurant or something like that.</p>
<p>&quot;If we can get just to the 600 mile range while the electric car is 
still a niche market, beyond 500 miles, many people would just fly anyway.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Exactly. 600 miles is more than probable, it is more like inevitable. With 
540Wh/kg prototype battery already tested in labs, that would make 600 miles 
(in Type S size car of 200kWh) roughly 370kg battery. About 50kg smaller than 
Roadster battery. Usually in these high-tech products final product is even 
better, so I wouldn't be surprised if real capability is somewhere in 
600-700Wh/kg class. That was also better in cycling capability and because it 
replaced graphite with silicon it wasn't flammable.</p> 
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m just trying to envision the path to mass market.&quot;</p> 
<p>I'd say it takes slightly cheaper car with higher range. Type S is, like 
you said, a bit overkill for commuting, but not quite enough for longer road 
trips. But with better batteries I believe things will change. The more there 
are BEV:s in roads the more interest they draw from power companies too. Fortum 
in here has already build some chargers in Sweden and Finland and there is some 
kind of Europe-wide standardization going on for high-voltage chargers. There 
is a lot more than just Tesla happening just now.</p>

<p>CM,</p> 
<p>As far as my IVT concept goes, I do not have a prototype but the principle 
or method is pretty straight forward and anyone(engineer) that looked at it 
could see how it would work. It would be like showing somebody the principle or 
concept of a &quot;gear&quot; for the first time. You wouldn't need a prototype 
to see that it was feasible and would work. It just needs to be engineered / 
developed and it is relatively simple. By the way, if integrating an 
&quot;electric drive&quot; with this IVT would make it VERY unique.</p> 
<p>You are right, the fact that it CAN NOT SLIP because it is positively 
driven and, &quot;is what every engineer has been looking for,&quot; will make 
it a tremendous success among automotive manufactures. It has been very 
difficult to get to the right people in the &quot;Big Three&quot; auto 
manufactures. I did get an email from GM's Supervisor of Plant Engineering 
Dept(Romulus Engine Operations), Oscar Sosa in response to a blog I put on GM's 
&quot;Voltage&quot; blogs&quot; about my ASTM concept and he said he was 
interested in finding out more about it but when I emailed back to him asking 
if it would be ok to call him I didn't here any more back. He probably showed 
my blog to someone(engineer) that said it was impossible and that was that. I 
have messaged and emailed a number of IVT and CVT manufactures recently. This 
IVT is a BREAKTHROUGH concept and when I get a number of companies seriously 
interested I plan on obtaining a Provisional Application for patents on them 
(only takes a couple weeks) and then show them to the most promising company. 
If you know any company or have any contacts I would appreciate it very much if 
you could put me in touch with them.</p> 
<p>&quot;Why is it so hard, and takes so long, just to CHANGE THE WORLD?&quot; 
lol</p> 
<p>I want to clarify my IVT's braking capabilities. It DOESN'T just lock-up 
the wheels. I just said that to show that the design was strong enough to 
handle full braking(locked-up wheels at speed). Even heavy vehicles like 18 
wheelers. This IVT can be ratiod down slowly for light braking or quickly for 
fast braking. Whatever ratio the transmission is varied too, the wheels will go 
there. This IVT could be used for a braking system alone. Whoever sees it will 
see how that works. It is really slick, and simple and different then any IVT 
or CVT in use or in development today. There will be another &quot;type&quot; 
added to what's known now when it comes out. Take care, Wayne</p>

<p>CM,</p> 
<p>I forgot to respond to the end of your last comment to me of Aug. 7th. 
about my &quot;rocket wheel&quot; analogy where you said, &quot;Since the 
&ldquo;reaction mass&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t accelerated like it is for a rocket, 
neither wheel motor nor car can maintain constant torque or thrust the way a 
rocket can.&quot;</p> 
<p>Here's the thing, and this is IMPORTANT to grasp. Until rockets came along 
the propeller propelled aircraft community(aero engineers) felt the SAME way 
about thrust. They said, &quot;You can't have constant thrust without more 
power because the air you are pushing against moves away faster and faster as 
the speed increases.&quot; They couldn't imagine constant thrust at ANY speed - 
JETS. So they tried to improve on propeller design, improve aerodynamics, 
increase engine efficiency and then said, &quot;The ONLY way we will get more 
speed is with more power and more RANGE out of our aircrafts is to carry MORE 
FUEL.(sound familiar?) The engineers of today are saying the same thing about 
wheel-to-ground vehicles, They say, &quot;The road we are pushing against is 
moving away faster and faster as speed increases so there is no way to have 
constant torque at ANY speed.&quot; So they try to improve transmissions with 
CVTs, IVTs, better aerodynamics, increase engine efficiency(electric motors) 
and then say, &quot;The ONLY way we can get more RANGE out of our vehicles is 
to carry MORE FUEL (bigger or better batteries) , But just like the 
breakthrough for &quot;constant thrust&quot; there is a breakthrough for 
&quot;constant torque&quot;. And it is NOT a jet engine on a car or wheel. It 
is the ASTM (All Speed Transmission Motor). Take care, Wayne</p>

(Battery pack total weight: 450kg, capacity 54kWh). Look at &quot;more&quot; 
tab in top of the page and there &quot;white papers&quot; which has pdf of 
battery pack.</p> 
<p>Altairnano and A123 batteries have very high power density but not high 
energy density, so they are not very good for for large operating radius BEV. 
They would be for hybrid for because they have high cycle durability and small

<p>Dear Tesla Motors:<br>
 We are commercializing our RET, high efficiency, 
low cost, green, light weight, multi-fuel thermomechanical engine or 
powerblock. Our initial products are multi-fuel (including biofuel, CNG, 
Diesel, Methane) off-grid transportable generators. We have started a Green Car 
Initiative realizing our RET-GENSET can be sized to provide, green, light power 
(mechanical and/or electric) for autos. We have extensive collaborative access, 
and have been invited to discuss with a powerful, well funded government, 
engineering center. US based Energy, Materials, Manufacturing is of US 
Strategic importance and dovetails with RETs high fuel efficiency (150MPG) and 
related green technology! Most auto manufacturing in the USA is assembly, not 
engineering/ IP which is being offshored, outsourced. A RET propelled Cooper 
type sedan would get 150 MPG. We are seeking automotive chassis manufacturers 
with electronic controls; large scale composite manufacturing assistance 
(technical, financial) will come from known Federal funded centers. A RET-Telsa 
could replace 2/3rd of its battery volume/weight and achieve superior 
performance (its lighter), as well be fueled at any station, thus have 
unlimited range. This configuration will achieve 150MPG H&rsquo;way on fuel. A 
RET Hybrid Duty Cycle is 600,000 miles. A 150 MPG RET powered US NGC (New Green 
Car) Cooper Sized, selling to the public should not exceed $6,000. However, 
composite may cost more, than current estimates using steel and plastics. 
National, international markets, workers, green enthusiasts/ promoters, US 
cmcl/govt fleet sales, foreign cmcl sales. 100,000 units could be a pre-sold 
beta test, factory would be sized for over 1 million units, flexibly 
manufactured, readily available, land with lots of incentives. A high tech new 
Detroit. A paradigm changing affordable, automotive suite of products, will not 
want for stakeholders. Discussions with &ldquo;bigs&rdquo; frustrating. Perhaps 
a high tech affiliation is better than score years of experience making legacy 
products. NB if the government provides $4,500 cash for clunkers at the right 
timing, (again) then a RET NGC would cost the consumer$1,500. JR CEO SPI

<p>Wayne P. Bishop: Coming up with a bright idea is just the first step. There 
have been many bright ideas that had some subtle flaw that wasn't readily 
apparent, until they tried and failed to make it work. Engineers are often 
bombarded by folks who have a bright idea, but then they find it doesn't really 
work because they've overlooked some minor point - maybe too much friction, or 
a part that collides with another part, or the kinematics is wrong, or some 
other subtle error.</p> 
<p>Having an actual working model will prove that it works and the idea is 
sound and you hadn't overlooked some obscure point. Having a working model that 
you can show makes a better impression on the engineers you are trying to 
reach, even if it is a simple plywood and plastic model, or just something 
cobbled up from cardboard and string. A working demonstration is much better 
than saying &quot;I've got this great idea&quot; (which they've already heard 
waaay too many times).</p> 
<p>John: how much energy it takes to recharge depends on how much was used, 
charging after a short drive takes much less energy than charging from 
&quot;fully drained&quot;. The maximum recharge would take about 60 Kwh, at 12 
cents a Kw it would come to $7.20, just as Timo said. But of course, most days 
you'd be driving less than 244 miles, so the cost would be less. You definitely 
want to avoid &quot;fully drained&quot;, just like avoiding an empty tank in a 
gasser.</p> 
<p>Randal Ray McMullin: If you will scan back through previous posts in this 
blog, you will discover that there have been many proposals over the years for 
&quot;self-powering&quot; or &quot;eliminate the need to charge&quot; or 
&quot;greatly extend range&quot;. Unfortunately, they have all been impractical 
or don't work. Covering the car with solar cells increases costs, but adds at 
most 5 miles a day, so it isn't really worthwhile (that could change if costs 
drop and efficiency improves).</p> 
<p>If your idea involves attaching a generator to the wheels or the motor, or 
attaching a windmill to the car, then you haven't realized how much drag those 
devices can produce. Most EVs and hybrids can use the motor as a generator to 
partially recharge the batteries, but the electrodynamic drag it produces slows 
the car down - it is called &quot;regenerative braking&quot;. Good when you 
want to slow down, but very bad if you want to cruise along or accelerate.</p> 
<p>If your idea involves some unknown energy source, we'd better learn all 
about that energy source first. Nuclear power turned out to have some 
unexpected hazards, we don't want to unleash a new hazard to the world. If your 
idea involves violating the known laws of physics, you'll be making an 
extraordinary claim, and we'll need some extraordinary proof before even 
considering it. There are just too many crackpots out there.</p>

<p>Imagine an electric car freed of heavy, space-consuming mechanical 
components which only gasoline cars need, such as: clutches (including 
engine-to-wheels fluid couplings, i.e. &rdquo;automatic&rdquo; transmissions), 
drive shafts, or differentials.</p> 
<p>An all-electric power train, centered on a mechanically independent 
electric motor for each wheel, would do this.</p> 
<p>Maybe each motor could be strong enough for 1/3 of the whole car&rsquo;s 
power needs, to hedge against one motor&rsquo;s failure. That would 
&ldquo;overbuild it&rdquo; to be better than &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. An 
instrument panel warning light (maybe with beeper?) might communicate such a 
motor failure to the driver.</p> 
<p>An underframe designed around a center-sill, leading, through several side 
bolsters, to lighter body-supporting side-members (like a railroad car's frame) 
could support the concept. Firmly attached to the center-sill, would be each 
wheel-motor. From there, with a universal joint at each end, would be that 
wheel&rsquo;s axle. Suspension could follow some conventional four-wheel 
independent suspension arrangement.</p> 
<p>Might its bigger battery bring range between charges (at a steady 65 MPH 
cruising speed) from 200 miles to, perhaps, 300? Maybe.</p> 
<p>I will grant you, in advance, that its all wheel drive might seem best 
suited to an SUV but, it won&rsquo;t hurt a roadster or sedan to have it 
either. All owners will be glad to simply drive out of &ldquo;hopelessly&rdquo; 
miring snowbanks, or mud. Deep snow last night? Why clear the driveway? Road 
not plowed? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to unplug the car and just drive out?</p> 
<p>Since you are starting relatively freshly, why not use this platform under 
the entire Tesla fleet, so that all models can benefit from its mass-production 
savings (with fewer components to build separately)? That can let you reach 
competitive (maybe more than competitive) pricing earlier in its ramp-up of 
production.</p> 
<p>Much weight and space is freed up for battery and &ndash; well &ndash; the 
rest of the vehicle!</p>

<p>John Doe: No, high-end electric cars are not made for treehuggers, this is 
pure business and Tesla Roadsters are simply high-end sport cars. The fact that 
they help environment and kill polluting gas guzzlers is just bonus to their 
attractiveness. Cheaper models will follow that even treehuggers can afford, 
but it still is business, not charity.</p> 
<p>Tesla Roadster is quite cheap for its performance. It is as agile as 
Porsche GT3 which costs a bit more than Roadster and loses to Aston Martin DB9 
only teeny weeny bit in performance. Aston Martin DB9 costs nearly twice the 
Roadster price. Type S will be bargain in performance/luxury -scale. Roadster 
sport (AFAIK) beats nearly all factory-build sportcars in quarter mile.</p> 
<p>With new battery techs coming it will be possible to build BEV that could 
beat nitrodragster in acceleration (with right tires) and would still be safe 
and economic to drive in roads.</p>

<p>The motor on each wheel sounds like it has a lot of advantages. I 
eliminates the differential, single speed transmission etc. It sound like it 
would reduce the drive train losses which are second to the aerodynamic losses. 
The control is all in the digital electronics and inverter. However Tesla 
addressed this in one of their earlier blogs and claimed that a motor on each 
wheel increased the unsprung weight (the weight below the suspension). It 
claimed this produces poor handling.</p> 
<p>I know that the Electric Mini (
http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/the_hybrid_mini.php) and the Lightning (
http://www.autoblog.com/2008/07/09/lightning-gt-ev-sports-car-coming-thi... ) 
have motors on each wheel (hub motors).</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Don't forget that 4 motors, single speed transmissions, and controllers 
COST MORE and weigh more than 1 motor and 1 controller. You can argue that 
smaller motors/controllers would cost less than a larger version, but not much, 
each would be over 1/2 the price of the single larger version.<br>
 The only 
way to finance new expensive technology is to start with high-end products. 
Over time with increased demand and sales, the costs will come down and cheaper 
cars will be built for the rest of us. We have to give thanks to early 
adopters, willing to pay premium prices, so we can benefit later.</p>

<p>Thanks for your explanation of battery charging. I understand much better 
now.</p> 
<p>Brian H. </p> 
<p>&quot;What are you doing while you&rsquo;re at your 3-hour distant 
destination? If any of that time is spent parked, it could be used for a 
partial recharge.&quot;</p> 
<p>This assumes there is a means of charging available. I have not come across 
any motels with electrical outlets beside parking spaces. I do agree that if 
you are driving three hours to a destination, you are probably going to be 
there long enough to recharge. There just needs to be more charging 
infrastructure before we get to that point as Timo suggested or increased range 
to avoid recharging away from home.</p> 
<p>Timo</p> 
<p>Standard household current here in the US is 15 amps / 110 volts I believe. 
You make it sound like there is more charging infrastructure in Finland than 
there is here. How far along are electric cars and recharging in Finland? Or 
did I read too much into your response?</p>

<p>jdsim and David E. Manwell:</p> 
<p>I just stumbled upon this http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/005118.html
</p> 
<p>&quot;I also asked whether they thought about using in-wheel motors, since 
putting a small motor in every wheel instead of having one big motor with a 
drivetrain connecting it to the four wheels can greatly reduce mechanical 
complexity and weight, as well as improving reliability. (This is one thing 
EV's make possible which simply can't be done feasibly with combustion 
engines.) Interestingly, they did consider it, but JB said it would have made 
safety certification extremely difficult. It's perfectly safe, but the 
certification regulations are written assuming you have one motor and a 
drivetrain, so there are some certifications (such as the one for Anti-Lock 
Braking) you can't pass in a car with no drivetrain. These rules would need to 
be re-written to allow vehicles with in-wheel motors to be certified, which is 
obviously not going to happen without significant money and time spent 
lobbying--not a fight a small startup company should take on if it can avoid 
it.&quot;</p> 
<p>So it seems that use of hub-motors ise hindered by outdated legislation. 
Same way I just found out that electric motorcycles here in Finland have 
ridiculous 12.5mph speed limit. Any more outdated and it would require someone 
to run in front of it waving red flag. Can't think what an earth that person 
that made this law had been smoking. Something that damages brains for sure.</p>
<p>There is mention for Type S that it might have 4WD as option, which I 
believe would be hub-motors in front and more traditional powerful single 
engine in back with better efficiency. No real info about that though. Maybe 
all four wheels are hub-motors. Maybe not.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>I got a slight eureka moment this week about electric cars. Tunnels and 
parking halls won't need so much ventilation. Gas guzzlers both use oxygen and 
emit toxic gases, but not EV:s. That means serious savings in closed space 
ventilation costs, and also increased safety in accidents in tunnels. No 
gas-tanks to blow up or ICE to use valuable oxygen.</p> 
<p>Not a bit point, but one more advantage.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  David E. Manwell  2:17pm | aug 15, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>To jdsim: </p> 
<p>I may not have clearly described my design's concept. </p> 
<p>My underframe has a major center-sill, to which are attached light lateral 
members extending to light side-rails, which hold the body.</p> 
<p>Though I've referred to these four separate, mechanically independent drive 
motors as &quot;wheel-&quot; motors, (since each drives only one wheel) they're 
not, located literally on wheels. Each of these &quot;wheel motors&quot; is 
rigidly attached only to the frame (at its center sill) not the hub, placing it 
above (not &quot;below&quot;) the suspension, so &quot;unsprung weight&quot; is 
not increased. From motor to wheel, power is transferred through its half-axle. 
The half-axle is attached to its motor through a universal joint, with the 
half-axle's other end joining its wheel through another universal joint (to 
keep the wheel vertical throughout its travel below the suspension This 
prevents it from tucking under in hard cornering, as the early VW Beetles 
sometimes did, which often rolled them over). Since only the wheel is below the 
suspension, unsprung weight is not increased.</p> 
<p>Besides the objection you raised to handling, the vibration a hub motor 
would be subject to would, very likely, not take long to destroy it.</p> 
<p>For all four wheels the suspension is only independent. </p> 
<p>What I wrote about does not use &quot;hub motors&quot;. Though its wheels 
are each directly driven by their individual motors, they are mounted above 
(not &quot;below&quot;) the suspension.</p> 
<p>I hope this makes it clearer.</p>

<p>CM,</p> 
<p>About needing a prototype, I would say you are absolutely right for 
probably 99% of them. As a matter of fact I had an idea back in the 90's and 
was pretty sure that if I put torque on this system in a certain way that I 
would get a particular result. Well to my surprise it didn't happen the way the 
thought it would. So then I had to explain to myself what was REALLY happening 
and why. So I do know what you mean. However I think in some ( all be it very 
very few) cases if a bright idea can shown with clear drawings and a clear 
explanation it could be excepted by engineers as workable and they would be 
willing to move forward with it. But of course they would then build a 
prototype of their own to test it. I feel that with my PDIVT ( Positive Drive 
Infinitely Variable Transmission ) concept I could probably get away without 
needing a prototype for the engineers, when they see it to say &quot;I see, I 
think you've got something here!&quot;. However, since it shouldn't be 
difficult to do, I will probably as you said, &quot;cobble up&quot; something 
to definitely prove it works as advertised and to eliminate the outside chance 
that I may be missing something. (it's happened before) lol Now the ASTM (All 
Speed Transmission Motor) is a different story. It would be much more difficult 
for me to build a prototype but I guess, with a little help, it could be done. 
I think if engineers looked at the ASTM they could probably tell if it would 
work as I claim it would OR they could point out the flaw in the concept. 
However, my point is, IF a company or an entrepreneur would state flat out that 
they &quot;will NOT look at any &quot;bright Ideas&quot; unless there is a 
deminstratable prototype&quot; then they will definitely NOT be the ones that 
COULD HAVE benefited greatly monetarily or have &quot;Changed the World&quot;. 
But they could still brag, &quot;WE could have developed that!&quot;.</p>

<p>Brian Covault,</p> 
<p>We don't really have much &quot;EV culture&quot; here. But there is ate 
least one of the major power companies building charging points (slow ones) 
around major cities, and when I contacted them in order to find out if there is 
one between my parents home and my home they told me that there is Europe-wide 
standardization going on for EV chargers and they are investigating techs to 
charge cars in 10 minutes (didn't say how big battery though).</p> 
<p>Also there is small scale EV conversion project going on that is in its 
final stages (http://www.sahkoautot.fi/eng). Also Fisher Karma will be build 
here (AFAIK in same factory that builds Porsche Boxters).</p> 
<p>Finland is at winter quite cold place (depends of where you live it can get 
-20 to -40 celcius), so we use block heaters in our cars. That means that we 
have &quot;slow charging points&quot; in pretty much every residential parking

<p>Not an improvement. Tesla current batteries have something like 
120-150Wh/kg (not sure how much battery pack casing weights). For more range 
you need bigger energy density, not power density.</p> 
<p>High power density though. 1.8kW/kg. Bugatti Veyron 1001 HP (metric HP I 
guess) is about 736kW. 736/1.8 = 408kg. Tesla Roadster has about 450kg battery 
pack. How about Roadster that beats Veyron :-). You wouldn't get very far with 
that power though. Same 408kg battery would have about 39kWh energy, and used 
in full acceleration it would last 39*3600/736 = 190 seconds. Three minutes 
from full to empty.</p>

<p>I just read some comments on www.worldchanging.com/archives/005118.html and 
checked them vs your website.</p> 
<p>There is at least one real error:</p> 
<p>In efficiency tab - well to wheel -tab there is chart that says that 
Roadster mileage efficiency is 110Wh/km. In this blog JB Straubel has charts 
that show that roadster real mileage efficiency is more like 220-250 Wh/mile 
which is 137-156 Wh/km (between 50-60mph). I'm inclined to believe that there 
are a lot more of this kind of not so obvious errors around this website. (like 
that power/torque curve chart)</p> 
<p>Giving &quot;fuzzy&quot; data is not so bad, but giving out plain wrong

<p>Brian, just to elaborate a little on Timo's remarks about the battery. 
Tesla uses 2.1Ah 18650 style batteries. These Sony ones are only 1.1Ah. High 
end cells like
http://industrial.panasonic.com/www-cgi/jvcr13pz.cgi?E+BA+3+ACA4001+NCR1... are 
2.9Ah. I have suggested before that I think Tesla should offer these premium 
batteries as an option, would get over 30% more range.</p>

<p>&quot;Kevin Cardinale: In-wheel motors may reduce transmission losses about 
30% of less than 5% what it is now. So you end up with 3% energy loss instead 
of 5%. No big deal. In-wheel motors are weaker and less efficient than Tesla 
one motor solution so you would actually lose some efficiency. Weight is also 
not a issue here, transmission + shafts don&rsquo;t weight much.&quot;</p> 
<p>I spent some time thinking about EV design in the 1980's. I lived then, and 
still do live in snow country. 4 wheel drive was mandatory as design criteria, 
as safety is reduced with two wheel drive. Since then I have seen information 
on &quot;pancake&quot; permanent magnet generator/motors that might be suitable 
for in wheel use. Although you say weight and efficiency gains would not be 
significant, I have not found support for your claim that in-wheel motors are 
weaker and less efficient anywhere on this site. Indeed, electrical to 
mechanical conversion efficiency is not a simple matter, but my impression 
reading about wind generators using three phase PM energy generators is that 
they can be very efficient at low RPM. As well, it seems significant advances 
in magnetic and bonding materials, not to speak of DC to AC control systems may 
have opened the door to use of this technology for transportation purposes. I 
would be interested in your comments.</p> 
<p> And a side note: I was surprised to read your design uses electricity for 
cabin heat. I think cabin heat beyond electrical waste heat should be via 
liquid fuel, not battery. Conversion cost from fuel to heat is much higher when 
you run it through the electrical grid, and the in vehicle battery. I would 
think a heater for northern climates could make sense.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>jeremy lansman:</p> 
<p>Hub-motors are weaker than out of wheel ordinary motor just because they 
are restricted in design and size in order to fit into wheel. Smaller size 
generally means less efficiency in electric motors. Also weaker as in breaks 
more easily. Those motors are subject to enormous shaking in fast vehicles.</p> 
<p>Hub-motors OTOH could save space and allow more interesting designs. 
Especially in some harvesters or somesuch that could have wheels in movable 
hydraulic arms. Partially walking in extreme terrain, partially driving like 
car when possible.</p> 
<p>I don't understand your comment about 4WD being mandatory for snow country. 
Not for safety, nor getting anywhere (as long as you stay on roads). Don't your 
country use studded wheels at winter? We have here in Finland about half a year 
snow and ice (depends of where you go here, in Lapland snow begins much earlier 
and lasts much longer than in south-coastal areas). We have here all kinds of 
vehicles, front-wheel, rear-wheel and AWD. Mostly front-wheel drive. All are 
equally safe. AWD would be useful only for getting somewhere in deep snow. 
Don't they teach how to drive in slippery roads in driving schools there?</p> 
<p>I believe that in fact well-behaving rear-wheel or front-wheel drive car is 
safer than 4WD car in speed-induced slide. 4WD car tends to lose grip in all 
wheels at once, and getting back to control is much harder than with two-wheel 
drive car that gradually loses grip in front or in back first. You have more 
time to react and get control back. 4WD is safer only to unskilled driver that 
has no experience of driving in slippery roads (just because you lose grip 
later with 4WD). That is at least my experience with cars (and I have driven a 
lot of different vehicles, including military ones).</p> 
<p>Of course if car is _not_ well behaving then it really doesn't matter if it 
is 4WD or 2WD. I have driven one car that was horrendous to drive in slippery 
road. No warning of slide, one second you were driving nicely and next you were 
driving backwards or spinning uncontrollably. Car balance was totally off. 
Scary thing. Braking needed to be slow and carefully considered, hard braking 
and you are spinning again. Luckily I was only testing that car.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Roy:</p> 
<p>Correct my calcs but isn't that more like 70% increase?</p> 
<p>One battery weights 45g<br>
 3.6 V 2.9Ah = 10.44Wh / 45g = 0.232Wh/g = 
232Wh/kg.</p> 
<p>Roadster battery pack weights about 450kg. If we assume 50kg for casing we 
have 400kg for battery: 400kg*232Wh/kg = 92.8kWh battery pack. That is over 1.7 
times Roadster battery pack.</p> 
<p>Do you have more info about those Roadster batteries? I can't find it 
anywhere. 2.9 vs 2.1 Ah is not 70% difference, its only about 38%. Do those 
Panasonic batteries have higher nominal voltage? Or are they just lighter than 
what Tesla uses? Or is it just that battery pack casing is much heavier than I 
assumed?</p> 
<p>OTOH 6800 * 3.6 * 2.9 = 70992 or 71kWh (about). That is that about 30% 
better.<br>
 OTOH 54000/(3.6 * 2.1) = 7142 so that should be 7142 * 3.6 * 2.9 = 
74.5kWh which is about 38% better.</p> 
<p>Same volume with 30-40% increase in range. Weight could be much less.</p> 
<p>38% increase in to Roadster range is 336.72 miles. If we apply this same 
increase in Type S 300 mile battery we get 414 miles which would be enough for 
me :-) :-).</p> 
<p>And those are not new batteries. Few years more and those look like relics

<p>Timo: I will answer regarding motors later, as that takes more thought, is 
more interesting, and is more important. As to driving in snow country? 4WD 
(AWD?) is mandatory for me. Snow often accumulates before it can be removed 
from the road, especially in rural areas. I live and work in areas that are 
mountainous, so roads can be slippery and cars can start to slide regardless of 
how slow you drive. Studs do help traction on ice, but, as you know, not on 
snow. I have AWD, and sometimes need it to get where I need to go. Like up a 
hill. Or to get unstuck when the car starts to slide backwards out of control. 
Or to power through a snow drift. Yes, power on four wheels does not help the 
vehicle stop. All cars have four wheel brakes. So, some people may get a false 
sense of security when they notice improved forward traction due to 4 wheel 
power, and think they can stop more quickly. Result? Crash, boom tinkle! 
Another safety comment? It is nice when in a remote location to be able to get 
home and not freeze. By the way, I am in Anchorage Alaska. It is already 
getting cold. First freeze can happen early September, especially at higher 
elevations.</p>

<p>Timo: Understanding, and designing motors is a field of its own, and not 
being paid to do this, I just don't have time or understanding to make 
definitive statements. I do think that using an electrical system as the power 
transmission system should reduce costs, power loss, weight, and eliminate that 
snow catching differential gear box.</p> 
<p>Pulse Width Modulation electrical power controllers give us new options to 
operate motor generators. I would guess that with proper voltage modulation and 
phase control, polyphase, low RPM, pancake shaped permanent magnet motors can 
result in efficient (&gt;85%) traction motors, even under conditions of near 
zero RPM and high torque. I would want to attempt design of a tire supporting 
wheel motor that does not significantly increase wheel mass. Probably that 
cannot be done, but it would be very elegant. If not, then I suppose the motor 
would have to be mounted near the wheel itself, power transferred via a CV 
joint.</p> 
<p>I browsed the internet, and found this interesting article on PM motors as 
used in wind turbines:http://people.clarkson.edu/~pillayp/c12.pdf. I spent a 
good chunk of last night trying to understand this paper. I found but did not 
digest others. I would like to hear from someone who already knows motors and

<p>Galactic Cannibal, your question about battery useful life is a fair one, 
but it can't be answered. You just have to settle on results from simulations 
and assumptions made from road testing. Those show 100000mile useful life. When 
someone gets to that with his/hers Roadster we get a real-life answer to your 
question, but it takes time.</p> 
<p>Of course in simulations charge-discharge cycles needed for 100000 miles 
have already been made. Roadster battery pack consist of roughly 7000 small 
batteries which combined gives 54kWh of power which gives 244 miles of range. 
100000/244 is 409 cycles. If individual battery unit lasts 410 cycles with over 
80% of capacity you have your 100 000 mile lifetime. There are battery techs 
that can give several thousand cycles with over 90% capacity so 410 is 
reasonable. You don't need to test entire pack for that.</p> 
<p>Maybe Tesla has made tests with entire pack. I don't know. But that 
lifetime definitely is possible. With future techs you get easily 400-500 
hundred mile worth lifetime (battery pack size increases which means range 
increases for single cycle _and_ cycle capability improves).</p>

<p>jeremy lansman, so you AWD (all wheel drive) is not for safety but for 
rough terrain. For that low ground-clearance Type S of Roadster are pretty bad 
choices even if they could have AWD. You need something with little bit more 
off-road capability. For that I agree that AWD is the way to go. As I said in 
my previous post I have driven several military vehicles and every single one 
of those had AWD. Only some sedans for transporting VIP or some generals had 
two-wheel drive, but those were not really military vehicles.</p> 
<p>Of course the vehicle I drove most didn't have wheels but tracks. It could 
swim, climb up hills over 50 decree elevation, go in deep snow and swamps, was 
agile enough to drive fast in forests and generally get pretty much everywhere. 
Could be fitted with several different weapon platforms. Usually though just 
for transporting troops. Loved it. Unfortunately it was also pretty noisy which 
mean that anybody with ears could hear it coming from miles away and it 
generated lots of heat which made it very visible in heat seeing things even 
with camouflage, so emotor in that would have been excellent. More torque, less 
noise and heat.</p> 
<p>I wonder how to solve electricity transportation and charging in military 
equipment. &quot;portable&quot; fusion generator? (focus fusion 5MW generator 
could be small enough to fit in large military vehicle, if it ever works).</p>

 I think you answered your own question. All 18650 batteries 
weigh in about the same range of 43 to 48 grams.<br>
 One of the reasons I 
picked these Panasonic batteries is because they have the same nominal voltage. 
There are some on the market rated with more AH but do so by discharging to a 
lower voltage.</p> 
<p>6831 batteries * 45 grams = 307kg. Total battery pack weighs over 450kg so 
packaging and electronics is about 150kg not the 50 kg you assumed. Tesla pack 
is rated at about 52kWHr / 6831 batteries = 7.61WHr / 3.6v = 2.11AHr.<br>
 
Panasonic batteries quoted at 2.9AH/2.1AH = 138%, I was being conservative when 
I said over 30% increase in range, your figure of 38% is more accurate.</p> 
<p>Don't know enough about the Model S batteries. I don't believe they have 
been decided on yet. A curious remark by Elon a while back was that the Model S 
batteries would be much superior to the current Roadster batteries. I assume 
that if the Model S gets a much superior technologhy battery, that this will 
also be retro-fitted to new Roadsters. There are many exciting possibilities, 
but most are &quot;5 years off&quot;. This time is often quoted as the time to 
bring new technology from lab to market, but in fact can vary widely. I wonder 
what Elon was excited about, could it be that the EEStor battery will prove to 
be real after all? I think we only have about 6 more months to find out. I'm 
even having second thoughts about Blacklight Power which I have long considered 
to be a scam, Blacklight - run your car on water! Two years to find out if this 
is real.</p>

<p>Could the driver or passenger be exposed to any electric radiation from the 
battery or motor? I know people could get cancer for using cell phone too 
often(still being investigated). I hope there is enough insulation mechanism in 
the right places for protection purposes. Thanks for any info. - Raye</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Raye: Answer to your question is yes and no.</p> 
<p>You are subject to magnetic and electric fields in EV, yes, but those have 
no effect on human beings. Too low power and too low frequency to be even close 
to even mildly dangerous levels. You get more EM radiation from Sun every sunny 
day. Using blue-tooth in your laptop in your lap is probably more 
&quot;harmful&quot; than those are. And there is no evidence that even 
radio-frequency (except microwave) EM radiation could cause any cellular 
changes unless it is EXTREMELY intense.</p> 
<p>For some birds artificial magnetic fields could be harmful (some of those 
can see earth magnetic field which is many times weaker than even smallest 
natural magnet magnetic field, they use it for navigating). We don't have 
either magnetic field senses or electric field senses (like some sharks for 
example, have). I imagine AC magnetic field from emotor is like strobe-light 
going on and back off in very rapid succession for some homing pigeon.</p> 
<p>Excessive use of cell phones causing cancer is probably not caused by 
radio-frequency EM radiation, but more direct heating of your ear from holding 
phone next to your ear for prolonged time (I know my phone heats up pretty much 
and holding it against my ear would heat up my ear too). Heat can cause 
cellular changes pretty easily.</p>

<p>Why not rethink hub motors? Now that your moving to a more stable and

<p>Roy, I have read one article about Type S having &quot;prototype 
batteries&quot;. Don't remember which article it was. Prototype means anything 
between 250Wh to 500Wh batteries, so can't say what that means.</p> 
<p>EEStor wouldn't be extremely good for energy density (not anymore) but it 
would be a lot cheaper making car a lot cheaper to produce. Power density also 
would be very good, OTOH also lithium batteries have got in totally new figures 
in it from new invention: 175kW/kg (no that is not a typo, it really was 175 
_kilo_watts / kg) with 60mAh/g batteries. Roadster 300kg battery pack could 
produce 22.5MW power or about 30600 metric HP. 60Ah/kg * 3.6V is 216Wh/kg, so 
it would be better than Roadster current about 170Wh/kg battery. It also means 
max recharge speed is calculated in seconds.</p> 
<p>That power density is tremendous. Three times nitrodragster power using 
better Wh batteries than Roadster current. Who needs 1001Hp Veyron when you can 
have 30000 HP Roadster :-) :-). Wonder what would be top speed with that? And 
how long it would last? For first 0-300mph you would need to limit power output 
in order to prevent tire burning, so it could last longer than just calculating 
67kWh/22.5MW. Also what size of PEM and eMotor would you need to control that 
power? PEM is quite big object in Roadster.</p> 
<p>BTW what is your source of information about Roadster battery pack? I have 
read that it has 54kWh capacity now. Your text says 52kWh. Small Improvements 
there? More batteries in same pack? Tiny bit better batteries?</p>

<p>There seems to be a dozen or so posts on this blog about the impact of 
substaintial heat and air conditioning usage on the vehicle's range and the 
affect of tires that provide more effective traction in the snow. These are 
factors that need to be highlighted in the sales information if thise vehicles 
and those selling them are to be seen as a reasonable and trusted alternative 
to what we've all done all these years. I think the worst affect of the Chevy 
Volt ads about getting 230 mpg is the perception that if they would make 
misleading claims about the perfomance characteriztics, what else will you be 
unpleasantly surprised with after purchasing one. Trust is harder to regain 
after being lost.</p>

<p>Raye, If I could afford the Roadster (too expensive for my budget) I 
wouldn't worry about electro-magnetic radiation from the car, for two reasons.
</p> 
<p>First, electromagnetic leakage would represent loss of energy thus lower 
efficiency. Tesla Motors designed for high efficiency, which automatically 
means very little low frequency electromagnetic radiation.</p> 
<p>Second, the connection between low frequency electromagnetic radiation (AC 
waves, radio, microwaves, infrared) and cancer was based on a single study 
finding slightly higher leukemia rates in residents living under power lines, 
but it did not measure actual exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Multiple 
studies that measured actual exposure to low frequency electromagnetic 
radiation found no correlation between exposure and cancer risk, so it seems 
likely that something else about that particular area under the power lines was 
causing the leukemia, perhaps related to the local environment or lower income. 
The only risk of low frequency electromagnetic radiation is if the intensity is 
sufficient to cause heating it can cause burns.</p> 
<p>As for the &quot;cell phone panic&quot;, that was from a single case of a 
woman who got a brain tumor on the same side that she usually held her 
cellphone, but consider that there are hundreds of millions of cellphone users, 
it is statistically inevitable that every year a few of them would get brain 
cancer, and a 50/50 chance that it would be on the same side that they'd use 
their cell phone.</p>

<p>I was thinking about the places I would use a Roadster or a Model S. One of 
those places is my parents cottage. The cottage is about 3 hours /300km from 
the city. When I get there this is no garage, just a grassy area where the cars 
get parked. We then take about 15 steps down to the level of the cottage deck. 
With a 30m cord I can reach the spot where the cars park.</p> 
<p>Would it be a problem to charge either current or future Teslas this way? 
There is no protection from the weather, and it would just be a standard 3 
prong ext. cord. I know charging like that would be slow (ah shucks - I'd have 
to stay at the cottage longer :) ), but would the lack of a garage or other 
shelter be a serious problem if rain or snow rolled in?</p>

<p>My idea doesn&rsquo;t use &ldquo;4 single speed transmissions, ... 4 
controllers .... (which would) COST MORE ....&rdquo; with its 
&ldquo;mechanically independent electric motor for each wheel&rdquo;. It simply 
has a single controller and &ldquo;all-electric power train&rdquo; for the 
entire vehicle. In situations, like cornering, where wheels are temporarily 
turning at differing rates, one wheel (the slowest) provides the power while 
the others coast. The only &ldquo;transmission&rdquo; is the single, 
all-electric (perhaps non-electronic) power train; one &ldquo;controller&rdquo; 
handles the whole car.</p> 
<p>Where&rsquo;s the extra cost?</p>

<p>Thus far all test about cell phones have been negative. If there was a 
danger from electrical radiation I hope your home is insulated there is more 
power running through your home and down your block than produced by the 
batteries in the Tesla roadster. I think the only way to get cancer from 
electrical radiation would be to sleep in hammock strung between super high 
voltage power lines.</p>

<p>Timo: It was my understanding that the prototype Roadsters were 54kWh and 
the production 52kWh using 2.1AH batteries instead of 2.2AH as a cost savings. 
Been trying to find info to verify, but so far no luck.</p> 
<p>David: I admit, I had not thought of your arrangement using one controller 
for 4 motors. Yes I think it is a good idea and should work, since Tesla's 
motors are induction and not permanent magnet. The issue about the transmission 
is not as straight foreward. Tesla's motor as designed is a 4 pole motor 
running up to 13000 rpm. You cannot just hook these directly to the wheels and 
maintain performance without a transmission. The other alternative is to 
increase the number of poles, which is what most wheel motor designs do. Some 
wheel motor designs use a planetary gear to provide the transmission speed 
reduction.</p>

<p>Is tesla previewing to give a solution which permit the car to be charged

 Can, for example, the glass roof of a Tesla S ben

<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  11:27am | sep 8, 2009

<p></p> 
<p>xavier, solar panels in cars are not very useful. They are expensive and 
generally not worth the trouble.</p> 
<p>Your suggestion of putting solar panel instead of glass roof in Type S 
would give you approx 200W charging in midday in very sunny day. Not at all 
useful at nights, early morning and late evening, cloudy day or shadow of 
trees/buildings. Charging Type S 300mile 85kWh battery pack would take 425hours 
with 200W. 300miles / 425 hours gives 0.7miles / hour of charging. If we assume 
six useful hours worth of sunshine in usual workday at parking you gain 4.2 
mile worth charge / day.</p> 
<p>Not at all useful. Just too tiny surface area.</p> 
<p>However, you can use solar panels at your home. Tesla Motors have some 
arrangement made with solar cityhttp://www.solarcity.com/. Check that out.</p>

<p>Steve, can't answer to your question about CdA (have wondered that myself, 
AFAIK it isn't exceptionally good, just usual modern car. Model S Cd looks 
better, but it is bigger car so A is bigger), but efficiency question has been 
answered pretty thoroughly in this blog. Just look at the top of the page.</p> 
<p>Engine is very efficient 97%+ at best, 85% at minimum, so losses come 
mainly from drivetrain electronics and mechanical friction of gearing and 
shafts. Electronics mainly I believe. I'm not sure anyone knows how much you 
lose at all different individual points from wall to tires, but overall losses 
are at top of this page.</p>

<p>Dear Timo,<br>
 regarding the question to apply solar panels to recharge 
battery. I agre with your calculation but some high efficient photovoltaic thin 
moduls can reach about 80 W per square meter.<br>
 And, if you think to apply 
on a car the bicolor style like this:<br>

http://wallpapers.dpiq.org/it_17__Lancia_Thesis_Bicolore,_2004.html<br>
 you 
can have about 5 square meters of photovoltaic moduls on Tesla roadster model. 
It means 400 W, so it would be 1.4 miles per hours of charging.<br>
 Maybe it 
is not a good solution if we look at new car style and efficency results that 
we obtained, but if you think to export tesla roadstar in a country like Italy 
for example, it could be a very important solution :)<br>
 It's just an opinion.

<p>Pardon the chiche :but a chain's strength is its weakest link.</p> 
<p> The Tesla EV has a battery chain made with 6381 li-ion cells connected in 
series and parallel. Given the extreme operating environment conditions which 
an electric car is subjected to like the Telsa EV would be , I think , 
thisTelsa battery pack is a catastrophic failure waiting to happen. Each 
connection in this pack is a link like in a chain. And so my question is,Can 
Telsa's software-alogrithm find and monitor in real-time the weakest link and 
thus prevent a chemical melt-down.</p> 
<p>In my opinion the best thing about Telsa Motors is their engineering BLOG 
site . It has a huge collection of mostly sound technical comments.</p> 
<p>In the past I have asked for test proof, that the Telsa battery pack 
delivered 99,999 miles on road driving in extreme temperatures found in Chicago 
winter and Phoenix summer. TIMO has responded the best way he/she could . But 
no absolute test proof has been given.</p> 
<p>On the battery's cost side , just look at the statements made by Telsa 
below, and ask yourself would U pay $36,000 for a replacement battery pack 
after 100,000 miles. Or pay $12,000 up-front for a pack to be delivered when 
you reach 100,000. And what about Telsa's statement that after 5 years or 
approx(50,000 miles) the battery pack loses 30% of its capacity.</p> 
<p>As for the 3 1/2 hours to fully charge the pack , this is for DisneyLand 
World, and not the &quot;I want it now&quot; mentality world of 2009 
drivers........</p> 
<p> Hey TIMO are you a He or a She..............Regards ...GC</p>

</p> 
<p>Tesla Motors refers to the Roadster's battery pack as the Energy Storage 
System or ESS. The ESS contains 6,831 lithium ion cells arranged into 11 
&quot;sheets&quot; connected in series; each sheet contains 9 
&quot;bricks&quot; connected in series; each &quot;brick&quot; contains 69 
cells connected in parallel (11S 9S 69P). The cells are 18 mm (0.71 in) in 
diameter and 65 mm (2.6 in) long (18650 form-factor); this type of lithium-ion 
cell is also found in most laptop computer batteries. The pack is designed to 
prevent catastrophic cell failures from propagating to adjacent cells, even 
when the cooling system is off. Coolant is pumped continuously through the ESS 
both when the car is running and when the car is turned off if the pack retains 
more than a 90% charge. The coolant pump draws 146 watts.[63][64][65][15][66]
</p> 
<p>A full recharge of the battery system requires 3&frac12; hours using the 
High Power Connector which supplies 70 amp, 240 volt electricity; in practice, 
recharge cycles usually start from a partially charged state and require less 
time. A fully charged ESS stores approximately 53 kWh of electrical energy at a 
nominal 375 volts and weighs 992 lb (450 kg). [67]</p> 
<p>Tesla Motors stated in February 2009 that the current replacement cost of 
the ESS is slightly under USD$36,000, with an expected life span of 7 
years/100,000 mi (160,000 km), and began offering owners an option to 
pre-purchase a battery replacement for USD$12,000 today with the replacement to 
be delivered after seven years. The ESS is expected to retain 70% capacity 
after 5 years and 50,000 miles (80,000 km) of driving (10,000 miles (16,000 km) 
driven each year). Tesla Motors provides a 3 year/36,000 mile warranty on the 
Roadster with an optional 4 year/50,000 mile extended warranty available at an 
&quot;additional cost&quot; (2008 Roadster buyers received the 4/50 extension 
at no cost while later purchasers need to pay). A non-ESS warranty extension is 
available for USD$5,000 and adds another 3/36 to the coverage of components, 
excluding the ESS, for a total of 6 years/72,000 mi (120,000 km).[</p>

<p>If a human body is an electromagnetic field, it for sure would have some 
level of interaction with the EM radiation from the car. However, nobody knows 
for certain what extend of harm it would do to it. Of course, there are many 
affecting factors such as the intensity, duration, and distance, etc. Sometimes 
the harm could be simply offset by the joy from the driving experience. FYI - 
now we just found out that there is a direct link between the demise of bees 
and wide spread of cellular signals - I bet people saw that coming when they 
started using cell phones. (The Roadster probably wouldn't be for me - that is 
like getting the deadly combo - the sun and EM radiation, a head-to-toe toast 
:) )</p> 
<p>Ok, enough of that, in all seriousness, what is it gonna take to put some 
insulation mechanism in the car? How much does the rubber or ceramic powder 
cost (Ceradyne is the best company out there just in case you are interested) ? 
I know this could be like dealing with the Y2K situation - anyone still 
remember? But if the engineering team at Tesla turns around and takes the 
precautionary position, this could be a huge selling point for you - just a 
simple cost-benefit analysis. I would assume most of the Tesla owners have 
higher expectation in general and appreciate better things in life. In the end, 
can Telsa set the golden standard for the EV industry and lead the pack?</p>

<p>Roy: Internal combustion engines, with their high dependence on momentum, 
have their highest torque at high engine speed, and need reduction gears to 
start the vehicle moving. An electric motor&rsquo;s torque curve, has its high 
point as the motor starts, requiring no reduction gears for starting the 
vehicle rolling. That&rsquo;s why I suggest the all-electric power train to 
exploit this torque curve. If the electric motor can eventually spin the wheels 
at 13,000 RPM, then (Wow!). What a high speed!</p> 
<p> Jeremy Landsman: You suggested &ldquo;I suppose the motor would have to be 
mounted near the wheel itself, (with) power transferred via a CV joint.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p> I would suggest two CV joints (one from motor to half-axle [HA]; the other 
from each HA&rsquo;s other end to its driven wheel) not just one. This prevents 
that wheel/HA assembly from tucking under in hard cornering, as the early VW 
Beetles sometimes did, which often rolled them over.</p> 
<p> Otherwise, you sound quite right that &ldquo;the motor would have to be 
mounted near the wheel itself&rdquo; on the suspended mass of the vehicle, but 
just not in the (unsuspended) wheel.</p>

<p>Antonio, you forgot in your calc that you won't have all those panels 
facing Sun. If it radiates directly up you have only roof to collect radiation, 
if it is low in horizon only one side is collecting radiation assuming you car 
is faced 90 decree angle to sun. You can't get same output from car surface as 
you would from rooftop.</p> 
<p>Also that is expensive. Doing usual car paint job isn't cheap, and if you 
have solar panels in it it would be several times higher.</p> 
<p>80W is quite low conversion BTW. I calculated using two square meters as my 
base figure and got that 200W. Using your figure I would get only 160W with 
perfect conditions.</p> 
<p>i agree that if prices go down and efficiency goes up they are more that 
just curiosity (there is nanoantennae invention that can convert up to 80% of 
sun radiation to electricity which means 800W / m^2 in perfect condition). 
Until then I think they are waste of time and effort. Maybe you could get roof 
with solar panels if you pay enough, but don't expect it to affect much.</p>

<p>Raye, Roadster does have insulation. Your worry for nothing there. 
Everywhere you go you get EM radiation. From Sun, from computer next to you and 
from monitor in front of you, from your laptop, or your neighbor laptop, cars 
and metro and trams, aeroplane induction etc. etc. You just can't avoid it. 
Roadster engine magnetic field is way too low power to cause anything.</p>

<p>Hi Timo,</p> 
<p>For me, 4.2 miles charge a day is not so bad even if it appear 
&quot;nothing&quot;. My way from home to the station is 4 miles.<br>
 I've on 
good day the half of my way paid... ;-)<br>
 Seriously, a solar panel can also 
be used to avoid the battery to give power to cabin lights, 12v adaptor or just 
air blow system non? Even if this is not full power to them it can be a free 
parts. A CIS roof film of 1m&sup2; whould how much? Less than 800$. If you buy 
an electric car for her green side, if you can buy a car of 99.999$ maybe you 
are not at 800$ near...<br>
 No?<br>
 First let the way open then see how 
people react to them.<br>
 Maybe here, in Europe, do we think a way different 
as in the US?</p> 
<p>Talking about solar panles, my house is already packed with 36 Cis module, 
delivering a peak 2700Kw.<br>
 Actually, after 8 month of exploitation i'am at 
a very good (better than previewed) 2400Kw produced.<br>
 In one year, 
considering the arrival of autumn and winter, will i generate approx 3000Kw.<br>
 If such panels can give so good efficiency with not on a car?</p> 
<p>(sorry for my english which is not percfect at all)</p>

<p>David,<br>
 Power is torque times rpm. Tesla has optomized the power to 
peak around 75 mph. Torque remains linear up to the point where the voltage 
becomes a limitation, and then falls off. Peak power is usually just after this 
point (about 8000 rpm for the Tesla) . After this crossover point the 
horsepower remains almost constant as torque * speed stays the same. In order 
for Tesla to use the full power capability of the motor, they must use a 
transmission (about 8.2:1). Without this the top speed would actually be slower 
because the wind and rolling resistance would overcome the available power 
before the peak power was achieved. A consequence of having the transmission is 
that the torque is mulitplied. Therefor there is much more torque at the wheels 
than there is at the motor. This high torque at the wheels makes it possible 
for Tesla to achieve their 4 second 0-60mph time.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Just to add an exemple to this look at the Renault Fluenz E-Z concept which 
use photovolta&iuml;c cells to help the battery in giving power to the 
climatisation and other electronic on board.<br>
 Another nice point we can 
mention, in an other part, is the heat pump installed by Audi on the E-tron 
instead of a classic cooling system. Every things which can help to gain power 
and co2 must be analysed. If all this technologies, if affordable, are 
installed in the same car it can give huge result. Tesla have a lot of advance 
looking the other manufacturer. I hope they can hold the lead by learning from 
other presentation in the world.</p>

<p>xavier, don't you mean watt, not kilowatt? 2700kW peak sounds like a solar 
power plant to me.</p> 
<p>Of course you get _something_ from solar panels fitted in the car. It just 
wont be much. Generally it is not worth the cost. Because you already have 
solar panels in your home it would be wiser to plant those panels there 
instead. More efficient and less costly. You would get many miles more from 
that arrangement.</p>

<p>I think Tesla Motors has done an excellent job engineering a great car, but 
the single thing that makes the product impractical for me is battery 
longevity. It is reasonable to expect consumers to pay $100K for a 
technologically advanced performance car, and I don't expect to reach 100000mi 
anytime soon, nor have problems with the more than adequate range, but a 
five-year life expectancy for a major cost part replacement is personally not 
acceptable. If I buy a high-quality, expensive vehicle today, I have the 
reasonable expectation that it will last 20 years with basic maintenance - that 
has been my experience. The electric car will be truly tempting once it offers 
not only great driving performance, but also a battery that lasts at least 10 
years and costs less than $10K to replace.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  1:27am | sep 17, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And now a word from Journal of Power Sources:</p> 
<p>A recent article (accepted 12 June 2009) discussing about Silicon-carbon 
composite anodes lists full battery capacity of 400+Wh/kg with 0.13% loss in 
cycle capability. Roadster 300kg battery would then have 120kWh capacity which 
is 2.3 times more than it has currently. That translates to 563miles. At 100000 
miles it has been cycled 177 times. That means it would still have 447 miles 
left in the battery capacity.</p> 
<p>There is another article talking about using high voltage spinel cathode 
which also mention 100-126+mAh/g capacity with 3-4.9 voltage range 
(300-588Wh/kg depending of how much current we draw out of it) for full 
batteries with over 95% capacity retention over 50 cycles. If we take same 
400Wh/kg battery we get roughly 475-500 miles left after 100000 miles assuming 
loss is linear (which it probably isn't, but does it increase or decrease, 
article doesn't say).</p> 
<p>Anyway all of these recent articles seem to have at least 400-700Wh/kg 
capacities with 400-500Wh/kg tested on full batteries and with high 
cycleability and power. Not with single tech, but with multitude of different 
techs seem to get to same range of capability. There are also *HUGE* capacities 
mentioned in other techs (up to 2-3kWh/kg), but those are not tested with full 
battery and are more theoretical than practical.</p> 
<p>Anyway, looks promising for me.</p>

<p>The experience that I am having with my Roadster agrees with all of your

<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  8:33am | sep 19, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Alan, that 206 Wh/mi should give you 250+ mile range at highway speeds 
(assuming 52kWh battery). Have you tested can you go that far? Looks good. I 
hope that doesn't mean Roadster has inaccurate speedometer which shows less 
speed than you are actually going. Can you test that (in here there is every 
now and then automatic radar next to highway that shows you how fast you are 
going. Very good at checking if your real speed and measured speeds are same).

 Not tea bags! That's a 21% increase in efficiency and range, and

<p>Any updates for this blog? This JB Straubel efficiency-blog has been here 
now nearly ten months.</p> 
<p>We want something. Updates for Type S progression would be nice. Measured 
energy losses using whatever drivetrain prototypes use (I assume it is same as 
Roadster). Add some weight and measure again (one passenger, four passengers, 
five passengers and trunk full of stuff). Aerodynamic losses especially are my 
interest. Type S looks much more slippery than Roadster, so I guess it might 
have same or less aerodynamic resistance even that it is bigger car. Any news 
on there &quot;experimental batteries&quot; I heard are used in Type S. Specs? 
And so on and so on...</p>

<p>Very interesting and informative. Who do I talk to about an idea on 
increasing battery life?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Roy  4:30pm | sep 26, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Susan,<br>
 You are not likely to get a response from Tesla. You could just 
post your idea. By increasing life, I suppose you mean number of charge cycles, 
not range per charge. Typical Li-ion batteries are rated at about 500 cycles, 
Lithium manganese polymer 1000 to 2000, A123 claims their nano-phosphate 
battery lasts 8000 cycles. Battery life depends on many factors such as depth 
of charge/discharge. Tesla's battery charge is programmable so you can select 
maximum charge typically 85% to 95%. GM's Volt is set to charge to about 85% 
and discharge to 30% before the motor/generator kicks in. Temperature is 
another important factor, both Tesla and GM use water cooling. Solar cells on 
the roof are not worth the extra cost. I hope you are not thinking of crazy 
schemes like using an alternator to charge the battery while driving. We should 
know if EEStor is real by years' end, it is good for a million cycles. There 
are other exciting high energy density batteries in research that may be on the 
market in 5 years or so. My current favorite is a new Lithium-Sulfer battery by 
Dr. Linda Nazar

<p>The limited range of electric vehicles is still the biggest drawback for 
them. The 200-300 mile range of the Tesla vehicles is very impressive, 
especially compared to the 50 mile ranges the other car companies are bragging 
about. (how come the major car companies are only able to go 50 miles using 
only electric ?!?!?!) However, a 300 mile range is still not adequate for 
someone, or a family, when on a trip.</p> 
<p>I'm wondering why someone has not developed a hybrid that uses hydrogen 
fuel cells as the other half of the hybrid, instead of a gasoline engine. 
Couldn't a hydrogen fuel cell work just as well as a gasoline engine in either 
charging the battery or directly operating the motor of an EV?!??! Do we really 
need to have hybrids that still depend upon using gasoline engines?!?!</p> 
<p>Does Tesla have any plans to develop a state-of-the-art hybrid that doesn't 
use a gasoline engine?!?!?</p>

<p></p> 
<p>GR: problem with hydrogen fuel cell is that you don't have hydrogen 
accessible anywhere. At least I don't know any refill points for hydrogen fuel 
cells.</p> 
<p>It is also polluting tech, many times worse than ICE -engine, at least 
until we have all power plants transformed to green energy sources. You need to 
use power in order to generate hydrogen and that process has poor efficiency 
currently. The &quot;long tailpipe&quot; is very much true for hydrogen fuel 
cells.</p> 
<p>Fuel cells also have pretty poor energy and power densities, so just adding 
more and better batteries and charging them whenever you can makes more sense. 
Electricity is available pretty much everywhere. Breakpoint for BEV to really 
become common car is about 600mile range with reasonable price. With current 
battery tech advance rate it wont take long for that to happen.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  GR  12:29pm | sep 28, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I remember seeing an article that describe hydrogen 'filling stations' that 
used solar power to separate the hydrogen from water... I believe they were in 
California... whatever... I'm really just wanting to see something besides a 
gasoline engine to show up in a hybrid...</p> 
<p>But yes, the REAL solution will come when affordable, and especially cheap, 
batteries are developed that are truly practical in filling all the needs of a 
typical driver. The 600 mile breakpoint should be considered a minimum, unless 
the car could be recharged quickly enough to continue driving. I'm saying this 
based on my own personal needs. I drive once or twice a year from Austin Texas 
to Louisville Kentucky to visit family. It is a 1000 mile trip, which is just 
about the maximum distance a heathy person can drive in a day. So for my needs, 
I would have to have a car that could travel that distance at highway speeds, 
while headlights, GPS, and air conditioning or heating (and radar detector 
;&gt;) being used.</p> 
<p>Now I can make the trip in my Corvette with only 2 stops for fuel. Which 
works out just fine, since that also allows for picking up a bag of burgers a 
couple of times as well as nature breaks. So actually a 350 mile range would be 
sufficient, if the facilities were available for fully recharging the car in 15 
miinutes or so. So maybe advancements in the charging technology alone could 
solve the 'problem'.</p> 
<p>Sometimes on these trips, It can be a problem finding a gas statin that is 
open, right at the time I need to refuel. The same would be possibly true for 
finding a charging station right when one needed it. In an 'ideal' world, the 
'real' solution would be a 1000 battery range at highway speeds, eliminating 
the recharging part of the equation. Maybe part of that can be in the 
advancment of solar cell technology or generators around the rear axles that 
could provide charging while driving... I know those technologies are not up to 
the task now, but maybe in future.... However, all of those kinds of 'add-ons' 
will disappear anyway, once the batteries themselves are up to the task.</p> 
<p>I do still laugh whenever I see a 40 or 50 mile electric range being 
mentioned in the specs for the electric hybrids that all the major car 
companies are announcing and developing now... ha!!! Wouldn't it make more 
sense for all of that development money and manpower to be spent working with 
Tesla to further develop the superior technology they have already demonstrated 
is possible?!??! Get rid of the gasoline engines completely!!! Is it money and 
power of a gasoline lobby or the oil companies that is keeping that from 
happening?!?!</p>

<p>GR,<br>
 Hydrogen fuel cell cars ARE electric. They have a small battery to 
aid acceleration and capture re-gen from braking, and drive electric motors. 
Although FC range is a little better than batteries (max about 400 miles) it is 
still limited compared to gasoline. As Timo pointed out, they are less 
efficient than pure electric. Honda has already brought out the first FC car on 
the market and others will follow from Mercedes-Benz and GM. I think it is wise 
of Tesla not to compete directly with the major manufacturers in terms of 
hybrids or FC's. Fuel Cell cars and hybrids are much more complicated than BEVs 
and for Tesla who does not already have vested manufacturing in ICEs or FCs, it 
would be a major effort. And why bother when BEVs are the winning strategy 
anyway?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  9:27pm | sep 29, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Roy, I read from somewhere that Honda is abandoning FC cars in favor of BEV 
just because BEV makes more sense. I think that Mercedes-Benz (Daimler) with 
this new contract with Tesla would be also making BEV instead of FCV.</p> 
<p>Honda FCX Clarity has only 240mile range before it needs refueling.</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I'd like to revise an earlier blog of mine: </p> 
<p>On September 1st, 2009, I mentioned that: &quot;wheels are temporarily 
turning at differing rates, (with) one wheel (the shorter-radiused, inner, and 
therefore slowest one) (providing) the power while the (other 3) coast.&quot;.
</p> 
<p>I've thought of a weakness it has: to move the car through the inside of 
curves/corners, only one wheel powers the car. Each individual motor would 
really need enough power for the whole vehicle, as I had described the system, 
not 1/3 that power, as I originally said.</p> 
<p>There is a way out of this: To begin with, the vehicle could be built with 
four-wheel steering, as GM pickup trucks had, a few years ago, with their 
so-called &quot;QuadraTrack&quot;. Assuming a 4 wheeled vehicle, that would 
allow both non-leading wheels to track directly behind the wheel ahead, giving 
each the same turning radius. As they do, both of each side&rsquo;s wheels turn 
at the same speed, deploying 2 wheels, instead of only one, for power on that 
inside track. Now, with two wheels sharing that duty, both inside-track wheels 
carrying the same load, and only the outside track's wheels coasting,only half 
as much power per wheel is needed, allowing smaller motors. It still needs no 
differential, transmission, or front-to-rear drive shaft. Its power train can 
still be all-electric, with only one control system for all 4 motors together.
</p> 
<p>Or 4 separate control systems could be used instead of the 4-wheel 
steering, etc. avoiding one system's extra expense for the other's, if the 
four-wheel steering would add even more expense.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  1:55am | okt 1, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>GR, do you speak of 1000mile round trip or one way trip? If it is round 
trip, then 600 mile range would be quite sufficient. If not, then you would 
need to charge one time during your trip and once at back home (and for both 
cases once at destination).</p> 
<p>Charging 600 mile worth fast is not that simple task because of physical 
limitations. There are real issues that prevents to use enormous amps unless 
you use superconductors. Also battery itself slows things down. Current 
realistic &quot;fast charge&quot; is about 5 min charge.</p> 
<p>Thing is that for 600 miles you need to use about 170kWh battery. To charge 
it in five minutes you would need 2040kW connection. That's over 2 Megawatts. 
If you charge system is 95% efficient you are heating things up at 107kW power. 
That's a lot of heat to dissipate. For 15 min it still is a lot. Also required 
amps and volts are huge. For about 1000V system you would still need over 
2000amps to do that 5 min charging. Not a small cable.</p> 
<p>Battery swap system would allow relatively fast method of 
&quot;charging&quot; but realistic &quot;fits to all&quot; system does not 
exist and I don't think will ever do (just too few customers for it to be 
profitable).</p> 
<p>Problem with hybrids with high pure electric range is the weight and 
size-requirements for battery as well as control unit size combined with weight 
and size of the other system. Using two different systems increases complexity 
of the system as well as weight quite a bit which affects car performance. For 
FC it isn't that bad because they already are FC/BEV hybrids. Maybe in future 
we could have long-range FC/BEV hybrids and shorter (600mile) range pure BEV.

<p></p> 
<p>I'd like to revise my September 1, 2009 blog, that concerned electric cars 
supported by center-silled frames, with four, mechanically independent, 
wheel-motors attached to that center sill (not in hubs):</p> 
<p>I mentioned that: when cornering, or on curves, &quot;wheels are 
temporarily turning at differing rates, (with) one wheel ... &quot;, the 
shorter-radiused, inner trailing, and therefore slowest one, providing all the 
torque to accelerate or even just maintain speed, &quot; ... while the (other 
3) coast.&quot;.</p> 
<p>Yes, using four separate, but electronically coordinated, control systems 
could keep all wheels delivering enough torque to supply power instead of 
coasting, but would add some expense.</p> 
<p>All the above assumes only one pair of wheels steers though. Assuming a 
four wheeled vehicle, one alternative might be four-wheel steering, as GM 
pickup trucks had, a few years ago, with their so-called 
&quot;QuadraTrack&quot;. That would allow both non-leading wheels to track 
directly behind the wheel ahead, giving each the same turning radius. As they 
do, both of each side&rsquo;s wheels turn at the same speed, deploying 2 
wheels, instead of only one, for power on that inside track.</p> 
<p>Now, with two wheels sharing that duty, both inside-track wheels carrying

torque per wheel is needed, allowing smaller motors. It still needs no 
differential, transmission, or front-to-rear drive shaft. Its power train can 
still be all-electric, with only one control system for all 4 motors together.
</p> 
<p>Since four-wheeled steering is an already developed concept, would it cost 
more than four separate control systems-- more than motors with twice the 
torque?</p>

<p>Finally a new car projects that is incredibly interesting and stands out! I 
have little concerns about the technical aspects since most manufacturers come 
with great technical capacities and features to new products.</p> 
<p>But I must admit I am slightly disappointed with the design... It looks 
like a Chinese cheap copy of a 'real' sportscar. Must you really make it that 
cheap? The front looks like a mushed in dorky smart car for geriatrics. Its a 
bit too short. Lights are positioned too close to the windshield and adds a 
nerdy look. With the roof on it gets even worse. You at least lost me right 
away as a buyer.<br>
 Is it really necessary to ruin a car this way when you 
now have the chance to do something awesome and perfect? The back is fairly OK 
but could do with some remodeling too. So many car makers ruin their designs 
and then wonder why their popularity is short lived.<br>
 I guess the reason 
why Ferrari (the new California, gorgeous; every curve is a masterpiece), BMW, 
MB (2 seater AMG), Bentley, Aston Martin, etc are some of the few brands that 
keep on top year after year; they finetune their designs. Even riceburners like 
Honda managed to make a handsome car with their Cab S2000 although a bit too 
small and unpractical.</p> 
<p>And why a 2 seater that fits nothing but a grocery bag? Just extend it a 
bit and allow backseats - and you immediately open the market to twice as many 
buyers. Backseats doesn't have to mean making the car look like its meant for 
old people. I am still waiting for MB to just extend their SL 63 AMG and add 
backseats to it. At least 3/4 of a backseat is better than none. People who 
love cabs would die for a great cab with 4 seats. Unfortunately, no one makes 
them and tend to ruin the design as soon as backseats are added. If adding 
backseats become too heavy, at least try and do something about that 
unattractive front end!</p>

<p>Timo, to increase the range from 300 to 400 miles would mean increasing the 
range by 25%. The charts above shows a speed of about 55 mph for the 244 mile 
EPA rated speed on the Roadster (note the official EPA range rating was made 
using a &quot;drive cycle&quot; with varying speeds). To increase that by 25% 
to 300 miles would mean driving about 45 mph.</p> 
<p>If the Model S has a similar efficiency curve, (thats a big &quot;If&quot;) 
then a rough estimate to get a 400 mile (644 Km) would also mean travelling at 
about 45 mph (72 Kmph). That might give you the range you need with a 
substantial safety margin. Of course, if you could take 1 or 2 rest breaks 
along the way and get a partial recharge, you'd be able to drive a bit faster 
than that! I'm hoping that lots of public recharging outlets will be available 
soon along major highways.</p> 
<p>marco g. carle: Tesla Motors has started accepting online orders for 
Europe, but with a substantial backlog, it will take awhile before deliveries 
can be made. One drawback is that the nearest Tesla stores are in Munich and 
Monaco, a long ways to go for service. Tesla Motors will be opening many more 
stores as fast as finances permit, so eventually there will be Tesla stores in 
Italy.</p>

<p>GR,</p> 
<p>You highlight the situation for which EVs are not (yet) well suited. </p> 
<p>If you make that drive &quot;once or twice a year,&quot; how far do you 
drive on the other 300+ days? Chances are that it's under 200 miles. So we need 
to question whether it makes sense to engineer a car to make the twice-a-year 
trip and make it carry around the extra cost and weight the rest of the year on 
the short trips. Just like you might rent a flatbed truck from Home Depot once 
a year to haul a big load of lawn mulch, rent a car for the 1000 mile drive and 
enjoy the benefits of electrics doing what they're good at the rest of the 
year. If I owned a flatbed truck , I wouldn't be very happy driving it 1000 
miles to Louisville in a day either - I'd probably rent a Corvette for the 
trip. Pick the right tool for the job.</p> 
<p>Of course, in 30 years, electrics will be the best choice for everything.

<p>Ann, I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder in this case. I rather 
like the design of the Roadster (except with the hardtop, in that part you are 
quite correct. softtop is quite nice). Roadster design is pretty close to Lotus 
Exige, and as such is made for agility, not speed. Short car with weight in the 
center means agile car.</p> 
<p>Tesla does not have very good pictures about Roadster. Or Type S for that 
matter. There is one blogger Bill Arnett that has much better pictures. Whoever 
is taking promotional pictures about Tesla cars could use some advices from him.
http://bill.nineplanets.org/Tesla/Yosemite1/index.html. Some of the videos and 
non-Tesla pictures I have seen show that those cars are in reality very nice.
</p> 
<p>However I like Type S design much more than Roadster. I have no use for 
two-seater toy car, no matter how &quot;cool&quot; it is. I need backseats and 
decent trunk too. For practicality Type S is way better than Roadster.</p> 
<p>Roadster is like &quot;hmmm... nice looking car&quot;. Type S is like 
&quot;drool...Want one! Give me my car now!&quot;</p>

<p>BillB, GR,</p> 
<p>One solution may be, and i think many people will find that interresting, 
the possibiliti to connect an additional battery package for long run. Think at 
the Tesla S. Imagine you have a 400 miles range, you know you have to make the 
way longer, think twice at the bagagery and connect you additional 400 miles 
battery pack (think more: a rentable battery pack at the Tesla store in town!) 
and you are gone.<br>
 Renault think about that... why not here. A store where 
you can connect an additional pak, and not as renault a complete set, so you 
everytime energy for &quot;local&quot; drive and possiblities for long drive. 
Having stores in distant country will be then a great point.<br>
 You are at 
the hotel, knowing that you go back to home in 3 days... UPS or FedEx bring you 
your additional battery pack, you pay with VISA for the rent and warranty and 
you can go home.<br>
 At home, you send back the battery pak to the stores, you 
receive your money back for the warranty.</p> 
<p>This could be very very helpfull in many case. We everytime hear about 
&quot;it's too short&quot;, we can answer &quot;no more!&quot;</p>

<p>How about combining the 4-motored electric car&rsquo;s platform with a 
carbon fiber body. Boy! Would that ever be able to take on battery weight 
(without losing strength &ndash; even compromising some body weight savings for 
more strength than similarly dimensioned steel body without reaching a steel 
version&rsquo;s weight).</p> 
<p> That would increase range, at any given average speed and battery 
technology!</p>

<p>Over the last few month I have been reading what people are saying, but no 
one has put there views into practice. A lot of talk about batters and what 
could be done, but I have not read where someone has tried it first before 
writting about what the company could or should do, I am very intrested in EV, 
so what I have done, to add a plus to my story is I went and<br>
 brought an 
Electric 1500w hub motor scooter as a test bed with 4 X 50ah lead batteries 
with a top speed of 46kph and a full charge range of 55-60km. This a 48v system 
with max draw 25amps, plus been a very heavy unit. I have change the hub motor 
for 1000w high performace motor, through out the weight (lead batteries) 
replace with 1 pack of 16 = 48 x 3 of LiFePO4 batteries = half the weight of 
the lead batteries. perforance, top speed 92kph, range 200-230km on one charge.
<br> If I can do this, why has some of the writer above, done some mini trial 
to see how there ideas would work?<br>
 If you wont to see how the good DC 
motors can be with minium use of battery power, look up CSRIO in Australia and 
see how they are getting 98% out of there motors.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Rei, can you tell us (me) more about your eScooter. How much space did that 
battery pack take? How much it weights? What kind of scooter? How did you calc 
that 200-230km range?</p> 
<p>I'm not engineer and I don't have space or time to tinker with that sort of 
things right now but my vision was to build tiny cheap runabout, maybe based on 
ATV: something like this:http://www.ecoeatv.com/products/e-force-atv/ but less 
off-road (smaller and less friction tires for example) and more like a car to 
make grocery shopping. If I add two hub-motors and those batteries to 
lightweight ATV how far would you think it could go? That link ATV has usual 
lead-acid batteries (6 x 12V-50AH SLA AGM). Where did you get your batteries 
and how much did they cost?</p> 
<p>I'm also a bit confused about your engine change: from 1500W to 1000W 
system. That should net out lesser performance, not greater.</p>

<p>Just read from news that there is new high energy density lithium-ion 
battery factory being build in Finland. They are making those batteries for 
industry and EV:s.http://www.europeanbatteries.com/news</p> 
<p>Tried to dig out _how_ high energy density batteries they will make, but 
there is no info. At least not yet. Apparently they will be producing large 
format prismatic lithium iron phosphate batteries. That's pretty much all info 
I could find. That can mean anything between 200Wh/kg and 700Wh/kg, so not much 
use for that info.</p>

<p>I have an idea for &quot;charging&quot;. Installing a small wind turbined 
and a generator in the front bumper. Funneling the air that comes though the

charge your Li-ion cells. I think merging both technologies would make the

<p>Everything I have read on the Tesla Roadster is very impressive except the 
concept of the two speed transmission that could not stand up to the torque, 
and had to be locked into 2sd gear. I haven't read anywhere that I could find 
where a CVT transmission was tried. CVT's were introduced years ago, and are 
not in several different vehicles such as the Nissan Maxima. Are there any 
articles or trials using some type of CVT for better response, or is the extra 
loss just that more motion loss within the transmission to drain the batteries.

<p></p> 
<p>Not again perpetual machine inventors.</p> 
<p>lewis chandler and Mike Olsen:</p> 
<p>Energy from car movement comes from electric engine, it is not free energy. 
Installing generator to electric engine slows engine down as much as generator 
creates energy + energy losses. Same with those wind turbines, they increase 
wind resistance equal amount of the electricity generated and then some, which 
means *YOU BOTH* are suggesting lesser range. In optimal case you would get 
zero, zilch, null, 0, increase in range.</p> 
<p>Try it. Attach generator to engine and then give it a spin to start it. If 
you are correct then that combination should cause electric engine to 
accelerate.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  9:03pm | okt 14, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Joey Simon, Roadster has now single gear, not second gear locked, but 
simply one gear. That's enough to give it 0-60 in less than four second 
acceleration and 125mph top speed. There simply is no need for any transmission.

<p>lewis chandler: What powers your &quot;generator&quot;? If it is a gasoline 
engine, then you'd have some sort of plug-in hybrid. GM is using that approach 
for their upcoming Volt, but Tesla Motors decided to go &quot;pure 
electric&quot; instead. If the generator is powered by the wheels, then you 
have regenerative braking, which Tesla is already using. Great for recovering 
energy while slowing down, but of no use when cruising or speeding up, and it 
won't give &quot;unlimited range&quot;. Your &quot;idea&quot; sounds 
suspiciously like an &quot;overunity device&quot;, but I'm betting you haven't 
actually built a working model. Engineers don't believe that &quot;overunity 
devices&quot; work, and the only way you'll ever get them to listen is to build 
a fully functional model that they can test. Sorry to say, I suspect the Ford 
and Chrysler engineers may be right and you've overlooked someting that 
prevents your idea from working.</p> 
<p>Mike Olsen: You aren't the first to suggest a wind turbine on the car, more 
like the 101st. Sorry to tell you this, but you've over-estimated the amount of 
power a small wind turbine can produce, and under-estimated the aerodynamic 
drag it will produce. The energy loss to that drag is about twice the energy 
the wind turbine can produce.</p> 
<p>Joey Simon: Tesla Motors solved the &quot;transmission problem&quot; over a 
year ago, by using a simple single gear transmission and adjusting the voltage 
to boost torque at low speeds. A CVT would add unnecessary weight and cost. 
Tesla has already put the new solution into production and has delivered over 
700 Roadsters to happy clients.</p>

<p>Range Extension:<br>
 It seems to me that if the maximum changing rate is 
16.8 kwh, and if the maximum discharge rate of a new 100% charge battery is 55 
kwh, that the maximum mathematical range extended device would only add ~30% to 
the range given all variables are equal and the load minus converter losses is 
greater than 55 kwh draw from the new battery. Is this a safe assumptions of 
the limitations of the current arrangement?<br>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Jacob, I don't quite understand what you are saying.</p> 
<p>If you say that maximum charging rate is 16.8kW then you get infinite range 
with infinite kWh battery with speed/acceleration that uses less than 16.8kW. 
Maximum discharge energy from battery is 55kWh, but with range extender energy 
would obviously be more than that. Maximum discharge rate power is obviously a 
lot more (about 200kW), and so is also maximum charge power, but that just is 
not used in usual charging.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  CM  3:55pm | okt 21, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Brian H: I don't know the current total of deliveries, I only find out when 
there is an announcement from Tesla.</p> 
<p>Jacob: The 16.8 Kilowatt rate is the power limit a 240 volt 70 amp electric 
outlet can provide, it isn't the charge rate limit of the battery pack itself. 
But as far as any &quot;range extender&quot; is concerned, it is irrelevant, as 
the main function of a range extender is to take over the electrical load from 
the battery pack, not to recharge the battery, and it would partially recharge 
the battery ony if there was surplus power available. The only limit to a range 
extender would be set by its fuel supply. BTW, &quot;Kilowatt&quot; is a 
measurement of power, and &quot;kilowatt-hour&quot; is a measurement of energy, 
that is, power over a time interval. The total Energy the Roadster battery 
stores is 53 Kilowatt-hours, but the peak power output of that battery is over 
185 Kilowatts!</p> 
<p>Jerry Psimer: The cost of solar cells is high, and the power produced is 
low, especially if shaded or angled away from the sun. Attaching solar cells to 
the car would add thousands to the cost, but would add less than 5 miles of 
driving range per day. Tesla Motors didn't consider it worth the additional 
cost. That could change if costs drop or power output improves.</p>

<p>Battery changing:</p> 
<p>Just made some calculations based on my sisters yearly driving (thinking I 
could buy her a Roadster). Based on that she would save about 12000$ in fuels 
in five year period. Then noticed that Tesla is offering battery replacement 
for 10000&euro; in seven years. For seven years savings would be 12000&euro;. 
Looking good this far.</p> 
<p>Problem is that by that time she had driven battery pack to unusable 
condition. She drives easily over 25000km / year which is over 15000 miles / 
year. In seven years that is over 110000 miles. If battery contains only 70% of 
its capacity after 50000 miles (based on FAQ) then that would approximate 40% 
or less capacity after seven years. That's not enough.</p> 
<p>Spec sheet says &quot;Battery Replacement (price based on battery 
replacement 7 years after delivery of your Roadster.<br>
 Pro-rated rates 
available for Battery Replacement before or beyond 7 years.)&quot; What are 
those &quot;Pro-rates&quot;?</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Hi.</p> 
<p>I always wondered how efficient are the petrol generators. They are 
basically ICE engines hooked to a generator to create electricity. Looking at 
new Peugeot's diesel engines they achieve astonishing 70 mpg (probably driven 
at 55)</p> 
<p>that is about 15kw power needed to push the car so the ICE must be able to 
produce at least 15kw for 70mpg at 55 = about 19 KWh/galon</p> 
<p>given the 54 KWh battery at the Tesla this means recharging it in 3h 
(including the losses probably)</p> 
<p>Now take note that the diesel engine I am quoting is 2liter. However if you 
make it smaller (as 15kw is not much power - about 20 hp) probably under 1l 
very compact engine can produce such power at similar rates. May be even more 
economical.</p> 
<p>Would it be feasible if such generator is made mountable/portable so you 
mount it in the trunk or something when you go on a long trip. At 55 the tesla 
is going to do 70 mpg using that ICE to produce the electricity and you wont 
have to stop, unless you drive over 65.</p> 
<p>Given that you will need that ICE probably 1-2 times a year it can be made 
even rentable.</p> 
<p>The thing is , how cheap/small they can make such device and how hard is to 
make it mountable/portable</p> 
<p>I guess if it weights 200 pounds its not mountable/portable. Probably 50-60 
pounds at most can be considered portable</p> 
<p>http://autospeed.com/cms/title_Little-Diesels/A_109062/article.html</p> 
<p>I think its feasible to produce a 10-15 KW diesel engine using cutting edge 
technologies and make it so small to be portable.<br>
 you can probably leave 
heat decipation and other items needed , at the car all time, and make only the 
actual engine block removable, (fuel pumps, reservoir and stuff can also stay 
at the car at all time as they would be small).</p> 
<p>Anyone have any ideas or reasons if this is impossible - why?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  RawSteel  5:13pm | okt 22, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Finally I found some reference !!!!</p> 
<p>http://www.fram.nl/workshop/engine/smartengine.htm</p> 
<p>Weight = engine + gearbox + marine gear = 65 + 14 + 22 = 101 kg. (223 lb)
</p> 
<p>So the actual engine is 65kg!!!!!!!! wow</p> 
<p>an 300-400 cubic engine will be able to produce the needed 15-20 kw of 
power and I bet it will be probably under 35kg.</p> 
<p>Why havent anyone already thought of that. Electric cars are super 
efficient and we can use that.</p>

 That aluminum technology is a multi-step affair. Store pure 
aluminum in a protective solution with gallium, then add water which is broken 
down by aluminum's aggressive affinity for oxygen, releasing the hyrdrogen, 
which is then run through a fuel cell which generates the electricity, which 
would have to be &quot;buffered&quot; in some kind of instantly variable 
storage to allow for acceleration, etc.</p> 
<p>Its storage capacity is large, though, so it might see the light of day. 
</p> 
<p>But it wouldn't be using the aluminum frame as its metal source! The metal 
has to be added in small pieces or powder to the solution, or provided in 
solidified Ga-Al-Si(?) solution form. When exhausted, the residue is a mass of 
fluffy alumina &quot;foamed&quot; solid on top of the mixture, which must/can 
be removed for repurification. Which is where the electricity cost comes in, 
because that's a very power-intensive step.</p>

<p>Finally a new car projects that is incredibly interesting and stands out! I 
have little concerns about the technical aspects since most manufacturers come 
with great technical capacities and features to new products.</p> 
<p>But I must admit I am slightly disappointed with the design&hellip; It 
looks like a Chinese cheap copy of a &lsquo;real&rsquo; sportscar. Must you 
really make it that cheap? The front looks like a mushed in dorky smart car for 
geriatrics. Its a bit too short. Lights are positioned too close to the 
windshield and adds a nerdy look. With the roof on it gets even worse. You at 
least lost me right away as a buyer.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Rawsteel, that kind of portable generator has been proposed before and it 
isn't that bad idea. Roadster uses only about 15kW in highway speeds (much more 
in accelerations) so if you can produce, let say 20kW with generator and charge 
battery with that leftover 5kW you should be able to use battery for 
accelerations and still get battery slowly charged. With 5kW that would take 
about 10 hours, with 20kW 2.5 hours.</p> 
<p>If not for driving and charging then smart charger + that kind of generator 
and stop for charging. You need also around two and a half - three gallons of 
diesel (if using that engine you linked) for full charge. That would be around 
75mpg. Pretty nice. I bet there are better solutions than that engine that are 
tuned for generator use only.</p> 
<p>BTW 65kg isn't that small for engine less than one liter. I had one old 0.9 
liter Fiat engine that engine block was light enough for me to easily carry 
alone, much lighter than 60kg. Of course that was not full engine it had many 
parts stripped out (cooling, exhaust, etc.), but it also was _old_ tech.</p> 
<p>Full weight of the system could be somewhere around 100 kg (maybe 50kg 
engine, tiny gearbox for that for getting right steady RPM for generator, fuel 
and generator itself). You could make that portable enough for carrying it in 
Type S, but I think that takes too much space for Roadster.</p>

<p>I hope that you could consider removable batteries that recharging station 
could replace. This would reduce the delay in charging the vehicles. Setting up

<p>Anybody got the latest production count on the Roadsters? Just curious.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  4:05am | okt 29, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Just found confirmation of my first impresstion that Type S is more 
slippery than Roadster:</p> 
<p>http://green.autoblog.com/2009/03/26/tesla-model-s-50-000-ev-sedan-seats...
</p> 
<p>&quot;...and the S has a cd of about .27 vs. the Roadster's drag 
coefficient of .35.&quot;</p> 
<p>Difference doesn't sound much, but it is. 0.35 vs 0.27 allows Type S reach 
same or possibly even smaller air resistance as Roadster, while being quite a 
lot bigger car. That means that larger losses are result of bigger weight 
(mass, inertia, whatever) , and in steady highway speed only rolling resistance 
which is bigger in bigger car causes Type S to lose to Roadster in Wh/mile 
comparison. All other resistances should be about same. This also means that 
Type S assumed 300 mile range with 85kWh pack could actually be larger than 
that in steady highway speed. 85 vs 54 kWh is over 150% bigger battery pack and 
300 vs 244 miles is only about 120% bigger range.</p> 
<p>Have this been tested in any way? Using Type S prototype and some extra 
weight simulating extra battery weight and Roadster drivetrain?</p> 
<p>We (or at least I) would like to hear progress information about Type S 
like we had for Roadster. Range achieved, battery chemistry used etc.</p>

<p>Timo,</p> 
<p>Rather than a 20kW generator, I suggest having a 10kW one. If you start out 
with a full battery charge, and it takes 15kW to drive at highway speeds, then 
a 10kW generator running all the time would reduce the battery drain to 5kW, 
and yield a total of 10 hours of driving (= 500+ miles). Stopping for an hour 
for lunch (with the generator still running) would add back 10kWh to the 
battery (another 2 hours of driving).</p> 
<p>This could be an extremely efficient engine (or gas turbine). It only needs 
to run at one speed, with no worries about the torque curve.</p> 
<p>For most typical driving trips, a 5kW (or so) generator would probably be 
adequate. On a typical drive with normal stops, 5kW would give you well over a 
400 mile range.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>RawSteel, your idea of a removable &quot;range extender&quot; engine and 
generator is technically possible, but it does have some formidable engineering 
challenges and might not be practical. The range extender unit would have to be 
powerful enough to take most of the load from the batteries and contain engine, 
generator, cooling system and fuel tank, yet compact and light enough to be 
easily removed and installed (some sort of hoist would be useful). For safety 
sake, it would need to properly vent the engine exhaust, have reliable 
electrical connections to the car, avoid overheating the fuel tank, and safely 
contain the fuel in case of an accident.</p> 
<p>It doesn't make sense to remove the engine but leave the cooling system and 
fuel tanks in the car - you would have to disconnect fuel lines and coolant 
lines (unless air cooled), with the potential of spills and leaks, and as you 
pointed out, they are small, so why not keep them together as one unit.</p> 
<p>The minor advantage in EV performance that would result from removing the 
weight of the range extender and extra range from installing it might not be 
worth the hassle of removing and installing the range extender. It might be 
more practical (though less elegant) to mount the range extender in a trailer 
towed behind the car, or just have it permenantly mounted in the car.</p> 
<p>Or we could just use more battery capacity for greater driving range, and 
quick charging during rest stops for those long trips. That is the Tesla Motors 
plan.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>What I would like to know is the real world cost of operation ? One power 
costs to charge it per mile, Two cost of parts to repair one including bat.... 
cost and disposal fee Etc. . Most people I don't think have a clue where the 
power they use comes from Coal, Hydro,Nuk,Etc., if we were using water to make 
all our electricity (which is the cheapest energy available) this would be a 
good thing but more electric cars need more power in the grid and we are right 
now pretty tight in the wires on the ground. that mean more transmision lines 
(oh people will be happy about that ) and more power generating capacity. Wind 
and solar if we double it in five years, at &gt;1 percent now on the grid, that 
will make it 2 percent , still not much on the grid from alts.,and all the 
political hype is all bs and lots people are making money selling the global 
warming bs. dont get me wrong I beleive we shouldnt be wasting things energy 
included, I have some bad news for people in that area because things have been 
changing on this planet long before man got oil and coal out of the ground. If 
these people selling it are so into beleiving it they wouldnt be (jet setting) 
all over the planet and using more energy then the average person does ( pretty 
(Hypocratic) in my opinion) . Anyway you people tell me where the juice is 
going come from ,Please? I like the concept but I cant see the cost per mile to 
be good and that is the bottom line !</p>

<p>Steve,<br>
 Are you suggesting that just because the payoff of lower energy 
costs, no pollution and no dependence on foreign oil is still several years off 
in the future, that we shouldn't start?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Thomas  6:24am | nov 3, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The power to recharge my Roadster costs about $6 for a standard charge and 
I get about 200 miles, so that's about 3 cents per mile. That's the cost from 
the utility, but about half my power comes from the solar panels on my roof. 
The sunshine is free, and the panels are already paid for.</p> 
<p>Yes, the climate on Earth is always changing. Before we started burning 
fossil fuels in large quantities, the Earth was on a slow cooling trend that 
would have put us into another ice age in about 20,000 years. That trend was 
discovered in the 70's and a scientific paper was written about it. The popular 
media then took that and hyped the heck out of it, telling people we had 
&quot;global cooling&quot;, while conveniently forgetting to mention the 20,000 
year time frame! That's why you don't want to get your science knowledge from 
Newsweek!</p> 
<p>In only 200 years, we have completely reversed that gradual climate change 
and put the world on a sharply increasing temperature trend by greatly 
increasing the CO2 and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.</p> 
<p>You argument that global warming isn't happening because people still fly 
on jets is laughable. It do hope you are joking.</p> 
<p>By the way, the US spends many hundreds of billions of dollars each year 
importing foreign oil. Estimates for the next ten years are about $7 Trillion 
being drained out of our economy. If we drive electrics, that money stays here, 
in our economy. That's enough cash to purchase an awful lot of clean energy 
generation and modernized electric grid.</p>

<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  2:10am | nov 4, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Some serious competition to Tesla Roadster: 
http://www.ewolf-car.com/index_en.html#/e2</p> 
<p>Doesn't say price, and based on what it claims that is more a race-car than 
sport-car. 250km/h top speed, 0-100km/h under three seconds, 0-200 under seven 
seconds, 400km range. Probably also $1M price-tag.</p> 
<p>Based on text it uses Li-tec Cerio batteries, and Li-tec has partnership 
with Daimler (http://www.li-tec.de/en/company.html) . Does that mean that Type 
S batteries are same as in that EWolf e2 -car? Sounds promising, OTOH I can't 
find any specifics about their batteries. One of the pdf-files I found says 
something interesting: &quot;developed for Formula One&quot;. That would mean 
very high power density.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  3:15am | nov 4, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Inspired by Steves comment I tried to find out how much electricity 
(energy) is used to refine raw oil to petrol or gasoline. Can't find that 
anywhere. Does anyone know how much that is? They might use excess oil for 
energy generation from well directly, but that does still count in the 
polluting factor.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  3:56am | nov 4, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Another bit of eWolf -car:</p> 
<p>&quot;Each flat cell (the battery has a total of 84) weighs just 1 kg and 
measures 23 x 18 cm. That means it is only a bit larger than an exercise book. 
Another important aspect of the Li-Tec battery with CERIO&reg; flat cells is 
its cycle stability and unrivalled service life (10 years) and range (over 300 
km). That makes Li-Tec the spearhead of current flat cell development.&quot;</p>
<p>That is 84kg battery with 187mile range. Assuming same or similar 
efficiency as Roadster we get 244 compared to 187 = 76.5% range which would 
mean 54kWh * 76.5% = about 40kWh battery pack. 40kWh / 84kg is 476Wh/kg energy 
density. HUGE improvement over Tesla current batteries. Can't wait to see that 
in Type S. And of course in 2012 Roadster. That range would be over the 
breakpoint of making ICE permanently obsolete (if it can be made relatively 
cheap by large scale manufacturing). Over 600 miles with single charge. 10 
hours of driving in 60 mph average speed.</p> 
<p>If that really is the real energy density of those batteries and they are 
already in production we can have electric car revolution sooner than even I 
expected.</p> 
<p>I really really hope that this isn't some overestimate hype of their 
batteries.</p>

<p>Li Tec is a Daimler-Evonik JV. According to the article below, Daimler 
holds the majority. I would assume that Tesla is very well informed indeed. I 
would also consider it wise for Tesla not to brag too early and loudly about 
future batteries, and potential suppliers - not because these may not become 
avaiable, but simply to not alert competitors needlessly.<br>

convert their old cars to be electric. and maybe they could get one of those 
shows on discovery where they convert a couple cars to high performance

<p>Here is my 2 cents. I have seen a few comments about Charging Stations. I 
have another vision for them and would like to know what you think.</p> 
<p>This is the Ramp-up System. You simply drive up the ramp which releases 
your discharged batteries and replaces it with a fully charged pack. The 
Ramp-up would hold always hold a battery pack or more. The Ramp will be 
available fro any consumer and also any commercial station. The commericial 
station version will be more sophisticated with RFID technology allowing you to 
charge your credit card at the same time. Imagine a charge for a charge. The 
inboard computer will home in on the nearest station or an individual who wants 
to make his ramp available for the public. Thus, any individual can be an an 
Access Point.<br>
 Just as the computer industry has flouished with W3C 
standards and IEEE standards for connectivity (protocols, ports, physical plugs 
etc.), electric car technology can flourishes with interchanging power packs.

<p>Brian H. I was aiming for energy density, not range. Tesla battery (not 
entire pack, but batteries) is only about 300kg so that would be 300/84 x 187 = 
667 miles.</p> 
<p>Of course that wolf e2 is quite a bit lighter than Roadster (because of 
those batteries) so it probably is also more efficient, which in turn means 
that range calculation I used needs some correcting factor. But I'm also quite 
skeptical about that range claim.</p> 
<p>Lets make some &quot;we don't believe hype without proof&quot; reduction: 
187 -&gt; 150 miles. Also increasing weight from 84 kg to 450 kg affects 
range....lets make some number here...(84 kg battery with casing is about 10% 
of e2 weight while 450 kg is from 1200+kg 37%, aerodynamics other affect some 
which doesn't count here...) guessing 10% loss, which makes that 135 miles for 
Roadster.</p> 
<p>That would give 300/84 x 135 = 482 miles. Roadster has 244 mile range, so 
that is *STILL* about twice the Roadster current battery tech.</p> 
<p>Also if cycle life is better and battery size get doubled (kW), that is *at 
least* twice the durability in charge/discharge cycling.</p> 
<p>For Alfred, even if Tesla gets those batteries, Daimler is probably first 
major car maker to benefit from them, not Tesla. We might get electric luxury 
MB:s soon to compete against Type S.</p> 
<p>That isn't necessarily bad thing, but it might be (for Tesla, not for 
general public).</p> 
<p>If Daimler is doing this well in inventing new tech, I wonder what other 
not-dinosaur-infested-companies like VW is doing.</p>

 Thanks for the link. I think E-Wolf will do well. The Li-Tec 
battery is a lithium-polymer design similar to Volt's. I do not think you can 
assume &quot;similar efficiency to the Roadster&quot;. That open wheel 
formula-one style single-seater is bound to have much lower aerodynamic drag. 
It is also very light weight. I do believe li-polymer batteries are superior, 
but not nearly as dramitically as you suggest.</p>

<p>http://blog.storybridge.org/2009/07/leave-oil-in-ground-drive-electric-w...

<p>In that same article both diesel and petrol get only 30 gallons of ICE fuel

<p>Roy, that Ewolf e2 is two-seater hard-top sportcar like ...Roadster with 
hard top. Not open wheel and not that much lighter either (weights about 900kg 
which is without batteries more than Tesla Roadster would weight). From 
pictures it doesn't look even as slippery as Roadster, too many sharp angles 
and scoops and stuff. Longer, taller and wider than Roadster (5.0 x 1.9 x 1.2 
vs 3.9 x 1.8 x 1.1). It might have lower CdA than Roadster but not much lower.

<p>I thought you were refering to the E1 since the E1 is listed as having a 
300km range vs the E2 at 400km. Also the E1 is 500kg total with 270kg 
batteries. Couldn't find battery portion of E2 with 900kg total weight.<br>
 I 
suspect that the E1 has 3 of these 84+kg batteries and the E2 would have 5 or 
6. I say 84+kg because the 84kg is just for the cells and there has to be 
packaging and at least minimal BMS included in the total battery. 90kg total 
would be 6kg of packaging and battery management electronics. For those 
unfamiliar with the Batery Management System, it makes sure all the cells in 
the battery are equally charged during charging and prevents over charging 
which would destroy the cells. BMS usually includes fuses and other protective 
features such as shutting down on overtemperature.</p>

<p>Roy, 900 kg is directly from ewolf website. Same with range which is said 
to be over 400 km there. 300km is from another article I found ...trying to 
find it again... hmm... there it is:</p> 
<p>http://www.gizmag.com/ewolf-e2-electric-sportscar/13107/</p> 
<p>That uses miles: 186 which translates to 297.6 km. That I then rounded to 
300 km. It is also mentioned in ewolf website in performance - flashgizmo, and 
there &quot;revolutionary battery technology&quot;. (which one to believe? I 
think the smaller figure)</p> 
<p>Of course this is just vision at this point, I don't think they have even 
prototype build yet, so those figures can and will change.</p> 
<p>Where did you find info about that battery total weight? I found few German 
pdf with mention that e1 has 180 kg battery. That sounds more like ordinary 
battery to me, but I can't find any info about e2 battery weight (only figure I

 E1 battery weight<br>

http://www.ewolf-car.com/assets_de/presse/auto-portale/www.evworld.com.pdf<br>
 
SYNOPSIS: The e.1 weighs a mere 990 lbs, 594 of which are battery and it<br>
 
could point the way to the future of racing.<br>
 594 lbs = 270 kg. As I 
described above I believe these are 3 batteries of 90 kg each. The E1 is 
probably configurable with different number of batteries depending on the 
length of the race. That would explain your link describing the 180 kg 
batteries (i.e. two 90 kg batteries installed). I do not believe any of these 
battery options are &quot;old technology&quot;.</p>

<p>Tesla, I'm impressed, as always. Great work. I'm still saving for a Model S!
</p> 
<p>You guys are doing everything you can. As much as I'd like to see custom 
kits and other suggestions such as range extention that I've seen in various 
comment threads, there are other companies doing those things, most are not 
very good, and it would divert too many resources and focus away from Tesla's 
critical success in getting real-world, ground-up, pure EVs on the road.</p> 
<p>Speaking of the Model S, I'd like to see some specs on the Model S - real 
specs, like actual EPA-based range data, 0-60 times, battery sizes and costs, 
etc. I'd like to see video clips of their traction control tests like they have 
for the Roadster. Maybe it's too soon to discuss the pricing of options, but at 
least it would be neat to have the Model S, as well as the Roadster, under the 
various tabs, such as the &quot;design&quot; tab, where there are detailed 
pictures of the exterior and interior, as well as the ability to see what the 
car looks like in the various colors available. It's already there for the 
Roadster.</p> 
<p>I'm assuming that the data and options I'm asking about are available, if 
the Limited version is going to be rolling off the assembly line less than 2 
years from today. At least, I would hope so, with such a short timeframe as 
well as the fact that the factory is already being built. Most of this stuff 
would have to have been known long before the details of the plant could be 
completed. I wasn't following Tesla at all until the Roadster first rolled out 
of the shop in late 2008, so I don't know how much teasing Tesla did with the 
Roadster specs before it was actually being produced.</p> 
<p>One concern about the Model S, though: I hope that Tesla is sharp enough 
not to just put the exact same system into the Model S without the same battery 
(ooh, bad pun) of tests. All I can think of is France's Ariane 5 rocket that 
self-destructed because one of the onboard flight control modules was never 
updated/calibated for the Ariane 5 (taken right from the much smaller, weaker 
Ariane 4). There was nothing wrong with the trajectory or speed of takeoff, but 
the control module thought so, and triggered the self-destruct. The Model S is 
bigger in every way compared to the Roadster, so the ABS brakes and traction 
control systems would have to be, at the very least, recalibrated and run 
through the full round of testing.</p> 
<p>Also, about the Model S, is someone else manufacturing the glider? Is this

<p>My Toyota Scion xA is the last gasser I'll ever own, and it will be 
replaced with a Model S in 2012. Ford's Focus EV will only have half the range 
of the base Model S, and the other cars on the horizon, such as Nissan's Cube 
EV, won't have the same range either. That eWolf looks a bit esoteric, much 
more than the Roadster turned out to be. Until they come up with a more common 
vehicle, Tesla is still way ahead of all respectable competition. Ford and 
Nissan have the financial and manufacturing might to get ahead of Tesla, but 
that's years down the road - Tesla got the jump on them. Now with the 
partnering of Daimler, Tesla will be able to match anyone in any category.</p>

<p>I wonder if it would be possible and feasible to add solar paneling to the 
roofs windows on the Tesla Model S. The top-back and top-front window could 
come optional with a SEV solar panel like the Toyota Prius does, increasing 
mileage and decreasing recharge time and energy cost.<br>
 Maybe the technology 
of transparent solar panels for windows is already advanced enough as well and 
could even replace all windows with solar technology, which can be added as a 
film, like window tinting. The foil would also be UV-protective and does 
supposedly only cost a 10th to manufacturer then regular solar panels. They do 
not convert as much energy into electricity, but therefore you don't even know 
it is there. When we talk about solar foil, could it not be implemented into 
the rest of the car chassis as well? The latest solar technology is already 
equivalent to fossil fuels, so maybe it is even possible to make the car almost 
100% power independent. For me it could work out, I live in Florida, don't 
drive too much and my car is always parked outside in the sun.</p>

<p>Mike Gillette: Currently, superconductivity require ultracold temperatures 
below -182 C or -297 F, that requires specialized cryogenic refrigeration. The 
energy needed to power that refrigeration is several times greater than the 
small amount of power saved through improved motor efficiency, it would be a 
big step backwards.</p> 
<p>Now if someone develops a material that is superconductive at room 
temperature, then that would be of interest. Unfortunately, no one had done 
that, and the few that have claimed to do so turned out to be frauds.</p>

 Big car companies can make EVs, but they are generally just more 
interested in making gas cars. GM is treating the Volt just like they treated 
the EV1, it is a big PR program to show how green they are but they are 
dragging out introduction and have now announced that they are going to make 
only about 10000 in the first two years. They initially stated that the plant 
that is making them could make 250,000 per year.<br>
 Seems like the oil 
companies still have the upper hand and have enough control over GM to keep 
them firmly focused on selling gas guzzelers.</p>

<p>CM, I wonder if superconductivity could be used for energy storage. There 
are few materials that are superconductive in liquid nitrogen (boiling point 
77K) which isn't very hard thing to obtain. As far as I know small 
superconductive coil can hold a huge amount of electricity. Of course there 
would be constant loss by refrigeration needed, so that would not be very ideal 
for saving energy, but it could be useful as energy storage.</p> 
<p>Anybody have any figures about energy density of such system? Scalability? 
Has anybody even tried to make such thing small enough to fit into car?</p> 
<p>Not that it would be feasible currently for price, safety or energy cost, 
I'm just curious.</p>

<p>I just noticed that the Tesla Model &ldquo;S&rdquo; (the sedan) has a 0-60 
mph acceleration time of 5.6 seconds. That is quite fast. I hate to be a 
party-pooper but, as a sedan, does it need much more than the 9 to 10 seconds, 
that a typical American sedan takes? I hate to mention the Prius but, even 
todays &ldquo;3rd generation&rdquo; model sells well with around 10.</p> 
<p> Couldn&rsquo;t building it with less emphasis on acceleration, bring 
greater range than 300 miles?</p> 
<p> 300 miles may be the lower end , before refilling, of a typical gasoline 
car's range, but would increasing that do any harm? After all, recharging does 
take about &quot;45 minutes&quot;.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Roy  11:23am | dec 19, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>David,</p> 
<p>There is a large difference between need and want. Most customers of 
expensive sedans expect high performance, even if they don't use it.</p> 
<p>The best thing about electric drive its that there is no tradeoff between 
peformance and milage. In fact if the car has higher acceleration, that means 
it also has higher regenerative braking and that leads to slightly more milage.
</p> 
<p>The Roadster uses 2.2Ah batteries, simply because thery are cheap (I hassen 
to add that Teslay buys the highest quality for reliability). Panosonic has 
2.9Ah batteries and just announced 3.1Ah version. If customers are willing to 
pay a premium for these batteries, then the Roadster and Sedan could have 
almost 50% increase in range.</p>

<p>A Good blog. Have you had the opportunity to consider use of the waste heat 
from the battery pack and the motor and it'controller for heating the cabin?

 Electric motors have a very high efficiency over a 
very wide speed range and power output. Unlike a gasoline engine, reducing the 
power output of the electric motor would get only a little improvement in 
efficiency and range. On the other hand, that kind of thrilling acceleration 
and power makes it easier to sell that $50K luxury car. I suspect that the 
Model S might well become the least expensive car capable of doing 0-60 mph in 
5.6 seconds, it will certainly be the least expensive 4 passenger sedan with 
that acceleration, and any gasser with that type of performance will be a 
terrible gas hog!</p> 
<p>Reducing top speed has a bigger effect on range due to aerodynamic drag, 
but the Model S wouldn't sell if it was limited to a maximum speed of 50 mph</p>
<p></p>  &nbsp;  David E. Manwell  2:27pm | dec 21, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Roy: </p> 
<p>Electric drive is wonderful, but high acceleration still takes more work 
than lower levels of it. Doesn't higher acceleration require more amps through 
the motor to get it? Getting get even more mileage would be made impossible by 
using that extra battery energy for extra acceleration. Losing no battery 
energy for snappier aceleration would violate laws of physics. Energy has no 
free lunch.</p> 
<p>CM: </p> 
<p>No, the model &quot;S&quot; wouldn't sell well at 50 MPH top speed, but how 
about 100 MPH? That doesn't turn off buyers of 100 MPH &quot;gassers&quot;, in 
the $50,000 price range.</p> 
<p>Wouldn't the inability to risk long trips, due to a lengthy recharge 
required only partly through a 500 mile daily drive be likely to turn people 
off?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Roy  6:34pm | dec 21, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>David,<br>
 While it is true that higher acceleration requires more amps, 
the higher amperage is for a shorter time. It requires a given amount of work 
to accelerate to a given speed, but the rate at which it get there is not a 
factor. There is an exception, if the wheels are spinning then energy is lost 
to burning the tires. Your are right about Energy has no free lunch, but not 
correct in thinking it requires more energy to achieve a given speed quickly.
</p> 
<p>Re long trips: For the next several years people will accept the fact that 
they will usually be better off driving a gas powered car for long trips. Only 
when BEVs can drive 500 miles on a charge and a substantial charge, say 50%, 
can be done during a lunch break, will people use BEVs for long trips.</p>

<p>When will the Tesla have an onboard generator so that it will not need to 
be plugged into a.c outlet ?</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  cablechewer  3:33pm | dec 23, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Herb,</p> 
<p>Tesla has expressed no interest in building hybrids. If you have an on 
board generator you effectively have a hybrid. Tesla is instead looking into 
battery swap stations and fast charging facilities. Once the infrastructure for 
those is in place the need for a generator will disappear.</p> 
<p>I like the speed of a battery swap station, but I am not sure I want to 
give up my battery in exchange for one that is &quot;in the system&quot;. I 
worry that such swap stations may become a place people try to dump older 
batteries they have been charging at home for several years or that I may get a 
battery that has been abused in some fashion. Perhaps those concerns are not 
really justified (if everyone uses the stations all the time they should not 
be), but they are on my mind.</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  CM  3:04pm | dec 28, 2009 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>cablechewer: The only way battery swapping makes economic sense is if the 
batteries are leased from the swap company. That way, drivers are not swapping 
out their battery, they are swapping one leased battery for another. I would 
expect that any battery lease would include provisions for free replacement of 
any battery that falls below certain performance standards, and batteries that 
no longer had sufficient capacity for auto use would still have enough capacity 
for utilities to use for load leveling and backup power, extending their useful 
lifespan.</p>

<p>&quot;Roy, what range do you think is the breakpoint for EV making ICE 
obsolete? You mention 800 miles in your answer to Kevin.&quot;</p> 
<p>Dunno about Roy, but I think the range is actually a mere 500 miles. That's 
4 hours each way with a little to spare. Longer than that and there's already a 
better alternative to driving, most of the time (train or plane for big 
destinations, ATV or snowmobile for the middle of nowhere :-) ), or you can 
arrange charging facilities at the far end.</p> 
<p>A somewhat better 'countryside' train network would reduce the breakpoint 
to about 250 miles, which Tesla is already promising to be able to do reliably 
on the Model S.</p> 
<p>Western Europe already has a dense train network and the breakpoint there 
is probably more like 120 miles, which can already be achieved routinely; as 
soon as Europe gets mass-production electric cars the gas cars will just go 
away.</p>

 Unfortunately I am still waiting for really solid data on

of the garage? Would I be able to park it downtown, outdoors, being snowed on, 
not plugged in, for 4 hours and start it again afterwards?....</p>

<p>In canada its cold. The parking lots have had plugs for block heaters for 
the gasoline cars so the blocks dont freeze in winter for many years. So an 
electric car can just plug into the plugs already available in every parking 
lot. A Tesla pack has a heater to keep the packs warm. It seems easy to have a 
tesla car in Canadas north. Everything is already set up and has been for years.
<br> New batteries with increased voltages can bring the distance more than 300

a picture of snowfall burrying a gas guzzler. Poor helpless gas guzzler. So 
where is the teslas 750? It seems like Its a bit like the movie 'the great

does it has any max cold temp</p>

<p>George, not all Canadian parking lots have outlets. In Southern Ontario 
outlets for block heaters in parking lots are virtually unheard of. I have 
heard they are common in Alberta and the Prairies.</p> 
<p>I have been told by a Tesla sales rep that cold is less of an enemy to the 
battery than heat. It made sense given the protection the battery has against 
thermal runaway for the cells. However both extremes will cause some 
difficulty. In extreme cold steering will stiffen, brakes will be stiff and 
slower to respond and the battery will consume energy keeping itself regulated. 
Other than the potential for a slow drain of the battery none of this is any 
worse than my existing diesel powered car - in fact it might even be better 
because my diesel fuel is in danger of gelling at only -23C (exact temperature 
where gelling starts depends on the fuel &amp; additive mix).</p>

the wind chill was dangerous, and there were photos of people having to skii 
out of their neighbourhoods to get around and there were trucks swept off the 
interstate into the ditch by the weather and yet it was 'just another day tor 
the roadster' a bit windy but no trouble for the 750. The car travels well in 
the snow..<br>
 like &quot;Ho Hum&quot; i thought there was going to be bad 
weather. Well aparently there was bad weather but the people in the tesla did 
not notice.<br>
 Well the Tesla car is one of the few that can drive on the

<p>Electric cars are nice however if they are to be truly affordable and 
feasible, then our electric power suppliers must be upgraded to handle the NEW 
load and the electric users in this country must convert to hyper efficiencies. 
The only, pending other developments, constant supply of electricity is hydro 
and nuclear.; solar and wind are not constant suppliers across the country. Any 
person buying electrics should be required to reduce their household electric 
use to a point to support charging an electric vehicle.</p> 
<p>The Tesla proves electric autos are not dull and boring. but the 
government, utilities, and the people need to get the electric supply of the 
country figured out. Else we will all be green because we'll be in the dark

<p>The people need to get the electric supply figured out. This is correct 
since everything is old. there is 10 gigawatts of power every day hitting our 
planet from the sun which is enough to power most cities in the earth. so no 
power? no imense power is everywhere. How to use it?<br>
 One day the paint on 
the car would be sufficient to power batteries enough to drive 100 miles an 
hour across country.<br>
 the batteries will be many and computer controlled so 
when they are depleted, charged groups will supply the power while depleted 
batteries will go offline to be recharged in 10 seconds to superconductor 
levels. These nono batteries will be able to absorb energy directly from the 
environment and there will never be any need to plug the car in to recharge the 
battery. this is a future scenario. Is it fantastic? the technology to do this 
exists today.</p>

<p>Ken: you are right about how wrong the idea of attaching generators to the 
axle and wind turbines to make unlimited range is. The people who come up with 
those ideas, over and over, don't realize that generators and wind turbines 
produce drag, a resistance that is proportional to the power they produce, and 
on an electric car that drag would cause the motor to use more electrical power 
than they could produce in electricity.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, Tesla Motors cars do indeed use regenerative braking, by 
using the motor as a generator they take advantage of that &quot;generator 
drag&quot; to both slow the car down and partially recharge the battery! The 3 
phase AC induction motor Tesla developed is particularly well suited for that, 
it gives precise control of torque during acceleration and during regenerative 
braking.</p> 
<p>I tell those people that what they are proposing would be a form of 
regenerative braking, and while that's good when you want to slow down, it 
isn't good to drive around with the brakes on!</p>

<p>In good conditions Sun radiation is about 1000W / m^2 . Something like 
typical sedan has somewhere around 10m^2 area facing Sun at midday at the 
equator. That's 10kW. Roadster would use around 50 kW at steady 100mph. And 
Roadster is smaller vehicle than typical Sedan. Current techs allow changing 
maybe 30% of that to electricity. You don't get very fast to anywhere with 
about 3kW of power. With that power you hardly move at all with practical car 
in everyday conditions.</p> 
<p>Also Earth gets a lot more than 10GW / day form Sun. Fom Wiki: 
1.740&times;10^17 W. Multiply by 24 to get Wh / day = 41.760 x10^14 or 4.176 x 
10^18 Wh</p> 
<p>kilo=10^3, Mega=10^6, Giga=10^9, Tera=10^12, Peta=10^15, Exa=10^18 so that

<p>While all the attached information is quite useful, what is the true cost 
[Kw per mile as with mpg] ? Not using gas is one thing, but what will this do

<p>Mika,</p> 
<p>Even if that works I doubt the tow truck driver would be impressed with 
what you are doing to their fuel economy. The regen braking would impose 
resistance for the tow truck to overcome. It might really stress the towing 
equipment and attachment points as well. Not an experiment I would want to try 
with a car that costs upwards of $110k (base price; delivery, options selected 
and a charging station or two add to it fast).</p> 
<p></p>  &nbsp;  Timo  6:04am | jan 19, 2010 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Mika; that's entirely possible. It just feels like towing a car with brakes 
on, but some powerful truck wouldn't notice Roadster behind it. Could cause 
severe strain to towing cable or chassis of the Roadster though.</p>

<p>David E. Manwell: Tesla cars are already set up with with an interlock to 
prevent driving while plugged in for charging. Tesla licensed a charging 
technology from AC Propulsion that uses some of the motor control circuitry for 
charge controlling, so obviously it can't be driven while plugged in.</p> 
<p>Mika: While it is possible to use regenerative braking to recharge the 
battery while being towed, that would be a &quot;last resort&quot; solution due 
to the strain on equipment and reduction of fuel economy for the tow truck. 
Much better to simply be towed to the nearest available charging outlet.</p> 
<p>Steven Zimmerman: Unless your electrical rates are excessively high or low, 
an EV would use about 2 to 3 cents of electricity per mile. Average driving in 
a Roadster uses about 240 watthours per mile, or 0.24 Kwh per mile. For 
electric rates of 10 cents per Kwh, that would come to 2.4 cents. (hard fast 
driving would use more, gentle driving less) Compare that with gasoline costs 
from 7 cents (hybrid) to 25 cents (guzzler) per mile, and the fuel cost savings 
are clear.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>CM - That&acute;s what I meant, last resort obviously. If you are going to 
be towed anyhow, why not show some green to friendly (??) truck driver and get 
charged half way. I understand that regen is quite effective charger.</p>

commented about our weird car taxes and our leading status as EV manufacturer 
(sarcastic comment). I answered that I haven't yet because there is no info 
about Type S batteries, and Roadster 70% after 50000 miles is way too little to 
me or my sister who also drives a lot. I also commented that Type S is a bit 
too much &quot;Pimp My Ride&quot; -car with its 17&quot; touchscreens and

<p>I had an idea regarding electric cars which I'm not sure is viable, but 
would like to share. The electric car is limited by how far it can go on a 
charge. I understand that braking is routed back into the battery, extending 
distance, but would it be possible or feasible to include a small turbine to 
harness the wind when driving to recharge the battery? That way, when driving 
on the Interstate, the battery could be extended for greater distance as it is 
constantly being recharged, especially at higher speeds.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Andrew: Your contribution is one of many that have suggested a perpetual 
motion machine.</p> 
<p>These never work because they fail to consider the machine's internal 
friction. No matter how hard we try to reduce friction, some is always present. 
Energy must always be added from an external source to overcome it.</p> 
<p>That's why electric cars' batteries must be eventually be recharged, which 
adds some energy from an external source, to replace energy lost. When the 
electric car is running, it's overcoming the friction from its mechanism and 
that from the air it displaces. Your onboard wind turbine would also present 
its own friction. Batteries would still end up being recharged.</p> 
<p>There is no free energy. </p> 
<p>It's also why gasoline cars have to refuel.</p>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Olda, the Roadster has an electric heater and electrically warmed seats. 
The battery has enough energy to keep the cabin warm for more than a day, even 
at -16, and it has been tested at colder temperatures than that.</p> 
<p>Brian H: Wile the display screen is nice, and like most electronics is 
reliable, it doesn't control essential functions and the car can operate 
without it.</p> 
<p>Randy Reynolds: &quot;Power&quot; is just the flow rate of Energy, and 
there are no unlimited energy sources available. That means that any vehicle 
mush have it's energy supply replenished from another source, such as liquid 
fuels or electrical recharging. Even &quot;solar powered&quot; cars need 
sunlight as an energy source. Now, there are some scam artists that claim to 
have an &quot;unlimited power source&quot;, but their devices never work the 
way they claim.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The battery pack is regulated when it is cold or hot to keep a specific 
range temperature. After a week of sitting the power range would go (for 
example) from 176 to 170 or so on a nice week. If it is really cold, or really 
hot as in california the power drain while sitting may be greater. Not 
significant perhaps but some may notice.<br>
 However when the car is sitting 
on the road, if there were new solar cells on the roof say. Then the circuites 
would allow the solar cells to charge the battery enough to offset the drain 
that the cooling systems are having on the battery. So when the customer comes 
to the car a week later, the charge of the battery is still half full, justy 
like when they left the car sitting a week ago, even if the temperature all 
week had been extremely hot. They should test this.</p>

<p>BL Hayes says<br>
 quote<br>
 The Tesla proves electric autos are not dull 
and boring. but the government, utilities, and the people need to get the 
electric supply of the country figured out. Else we will all be green because 
we&rsquo;ll be in the dark with no electricity.<br>
 The power grid of this 
country is not going to get fixed by auto makers nor battery technology matter 
if you can&rsquo;t charge it.<br>
 unquote</p> 
<p>The point this misses is that power consumption is far greater during the 
DAYTIME hours than at night. It is at night when there is a great deal of 
excess capacity, so, charging your electric car at night is an ideal situation 
for everyone, including the utilities.</p> 
<p>Electricity is even much less expensive at night, because the companies 
want to keep their equipment running. Now, if everyone had electric cars, it 
would be an interesting exercise to see if the night time power requirements 
outstrip the daytime. I doubt it, based on the fact that industry still is not 
using anywhere near the same amount of power at night that it does during the 
day - many business turn off a large number of lights - computers are either 
shutdown or go into hibernate mode, etc.</p> 
<p>Then, there's always the option of supplementing the electric cars power 
with solar cells. The Fisker Karma is going to offer solar cells on the car as 
an option. While it won't provide 100% of the energy needed, it is a step in 
the right direction. Think of something akin to a convertible rising out of the 
trunk and unfolding over the top of of the car during the day to gather power.

<p>Since there isn't a gas tank on an electric car, miles per gallon is rather 
meaningless. Perhaps a better measure for operating cost comparison might be 
miles per dollar (MPD).</p> 
<p>For example, if gasoline were $3.00 per gallon and a car could travel 30 
miles on a gallon of gasoline, then it could do 10 MPD. If the car could travel 
60 miles on a gallon of gasoline, its MPD would be 20.</p> 
<p>If a car traveled 100 miles, it took 24 kwh of electricity to recharge, and 
electricity were 10 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh), it would cost $2.40 to go 
100 miles and its MPD would be 42.</p> 
<p>This doesn't include any allowance for replacing the battery after 7-10 
years. Who knows what that might run?</p>

<p>I have had a quality idea about further uses fo your power train. It would 
be as revolutionary as your cars, in a different field. I am still reasearching 
specs and power enchancements from several sources. Your B W trans. has a 
(8.2752:1) ratio, you also have rear wheel drive, indicating a differential. 
Does the diff. have further reduction, or is it one to one? What is your final 
drive ratio? It will be several months before real action. I'm hoping Tesla 
would be interested in helping with a proto type, or at a minimum selling me 
the needed componants, remembering this is a prototype for your bennifit, and 
we do not have millions. A cost, or donation basis would be fine, like a 
&quot;rebuild&quot;. If you have a sub contractor on the motors, they would 
love the extra sales generated with the success. I'm assuming the motors can be 
manufactured to run both clock-wise and counter clock-wise directions. It would 
also be an international news story as well!!! GREAT MARKETING for you!! Closer 
to the time plus my research, will make this a strong idea to be pursued!</p>

<p>Very intersting data to see. I am surprised to see just how high the range 
could possibly be, espically at speeds at 55-70 miles per hour. Optimal range 
seems to be very high! I know others have said this but it would be intersting 
to see just how much the use of AC/heaters/headlights etc. would change these 
numbers.</p>

<p>Of course, although reducing speed reduces the effects of drag, etc, it 
also increases drive time, which increases HVAC.<br>
 It's rather unfortunate 
that the trips where the driving range is most important are the very ones 
where the driving speeds are going to be the highest.<br>
 I don't think these 
range worries are going to be<br>
 all that bothersome once there are plenty of 
level 3 charging stations enroute. At 300 miles of range and 1 hour recharge 
times, driving an EV on a trip won't be significantly more inconvenient than 
traveling via ICE.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>I think the search for more range in a single charge is ultimately a dead 
end.<br>
 The bottom line is that producing mechanical energy from electricity 
will always (for the distant foreseeable future) entail a high cost battery 
from cutting edge technology.<br>
 If electric locomotion is to truly make the 
jump into all out consumerism a new strategy for the NEAR future is in order.
<br> Tesla is (I think) going to make a big jump with the model S but the 
typical family is always on about range, range, range. We all know that the 
typical family doesn't exceed it's 150 miles a day often but the risk of 
running out of juice effects us on an almost primitive level. You can't just 
call AAA for a tank of gas.</p> 
<p>I can't believe I'm pissing away such a good idea on a blog, and if Tesla 
doesn't do it in a few years I will. But, here goes.<br>
 Towable batteries. 
All Tesla needs to do is work with a standards committee on a protocol to work 
with a towable battery. Tesla could even build them. If your mind is going like 
mine does you already see the ups and downs. The downs are that it may not be 
graceful to think about a model S towing a battery behind it. Certainly not 
'luxurious' in reference to the status quo.</p> 
<p>BUT the up sides murder all of the currently hindering aspects of 
electric-only locomotion. If you are about to get stranded you can go pick up a 
tow-able. If you are going on a long trip you can pick up a tow-able. Perhaps 
exchange it along the way (quicker and cheaper than a gas up).<br>
 As far as 
logistics the business side should be immediately apparent. The obvious choice 
would be Tesla locations, you could also franchise out. Perhaps with gas 
stations or U-haul. Towable batteries would ideally work with all major 
electric vehicles so theoretically they'd catch on pretty quick. Payment could 
be automated, a club method or credit card deductible etc. Licensing would be 
easy as they could be licensed as trailers. I could go on.</p> 
<p>Towable batteries could fix a whole lot of irks people have about making 
the switch to electric-only.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>I would like to see an infrastructure of (480V, 45min) charging stations 
about every 150mi along the major interstates. This might be a nice franchise 
opportunity. Also, I would like to see a couple of major hotel chains have 220V 
charging capability for overnight recharging along the major highways. This 
would allow EVs to easily traverse the USA.<br>
 This is a much better solution 
than a towable battery.</p>

<p>Attrezzopox: how often do you drive with a trailer? Not often I bet. </p> 
<p>A trailer is cumbersome, large enough to make ALL driving maneuvers more 
protracted (try parking with a trailer sometime, see how much effort it takes), 
hinders vehicle movements, and utterly kills speed, acceleration, and range.</p>
<p>You're talking about increasing the mass/weight of a car by at least 50% 
(battery is close to half a model s's total weight, plus you'd need the trailer 
to lug it around). Just the extra weigh alone will cut your range back so far 
that your two batteries will take you no further than you'd go without the 
trailer battery connected.</p> 
<p>You're also falling into the typical gas mindset: how many places do you go 
where thereis no electricity? Honestly, you can plug in ANYWHERE. You don't 
need to FIND a gas station, just drive up to a hotel, Restaraunt, even 
someone's house and ask if you can plug in for an hour or so! Gas is only in a 
station, electricity is EVERYWHERE, or close enough.</p> 
<p>BTW, there are already tow trucks being retro-fitted to carry generators to 
give a stranded motorist a charge wherever they get stuck. FYI</p>

<p>I just took the Excel data that was provided so kindly by JB, and I changed 
the kwH to 90000 for the Model S, as was recently claimed by Elon Musk, instead 
of the 55000 for the Roadster. The Range vs Speed chart is dramatically 
improved, with a range of 277 to 320 miles driving at 70mph to 65mph, 
respectively. This is incredible if true. I didn't think that the 300mi range 
was intended to mean highway driving, but apparently it may be.</p> 
<p>I realize this calculation assumes quite a bit. The Model S will be much 
heavier, and have worse aerodynamics probably than the Roadster, so these 
numbers are definitely off. But just adding the additional battery capacity of 
the Model S will improve the range dramatically at highway speeds. Does anyone 
know how the aerodynamics of the Model S compare to the Roadster?</p>

<p>Okay, I'm no engineer, or electrical whiz. But I've got a question. 
Wouldn't it be possible to incorporate a small generator with a Brown's gas 
hydrolysis (I think that's the term) setup? Given that ceramic engines are 
viable nowadays, and can be run with a synthetic or bio-derived lubricant, this 
would likely keep the green footprint that you've aimed for. This would also 
extend the range of your vehicle tremendously.</p> 
<p>Again, I'm not an engineer, just a history buff, and I know from the 
lessons of history, that some of the greatest inventions and innovations have 
been because some yutz said, &quot;What if...&quot;</p>

 40 miles and $5 a gallon = 12.5 cents a mile </p> 
<p>Which adds up to you should not assume the higher buying price and hence 
higher depreciation on an EV will be regained by lower running costs.</p>

<p>Haven't been many posts here for awhile so just wanted to say that this 
info, JB, is part of why i LOVE Tesla so much! It's probably about the most 
important data that i can think of about an EV - and only TM makes it so 
readily available for its EVs. (Not that there are a lot of other EV makers 
*yet* - but i sure hope they emulate this).</p> 
<p>Anyway, Right On! and I appreciate all the love that clearly went into 
collecting these seminal data. Since i focus on using Solar PV to power our 
EVs, knowing kWh/Mi (or MPK) achievable, is sure helpful in translating from 
kWh produced daily/ after losses.</p> 
<p>Peak Oil, who cares, and GO solar EVs!</p>

<p>Tesla could be involved in meeting the 60 mpg requirement for vehicles in 
the next two years.</p> 
<p>eemc is developing a standardized blueprint for converting every type of 
vehicle to the efficiency of all electric operation with the convenience of 
never having to wait while recharging. The current fuel distribution 
infrastructure would be entirely capable of supplying energy to the feed the 
machine. Were we to combine efforts it would eliminate the need for eemc to 
completely reinvent this specific &lsquo;wheel.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>There's a draft white paper showing the most efficient method for building 
a full series hybrid vehicle of any type; check with me at the e-mail address 
that I used to register for the Tesla web site.</p>

<p>RD2, my understanding of the aerodynamics for the S will be far superior to 
that of the Roadster. Look at the shape, it's a wing in reverse. I'm looking 
forward to #160 arriving in my driveway.</p> 
<p>Good health</p>

<p>JB,<br>
 With over 20 million &quot;electric&quot; miles now on Tesla 
vehicles, what is the single biggest component failure?<br>
 Is it mechanical 
or electrical?</p>
