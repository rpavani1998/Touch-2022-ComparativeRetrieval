Planes or Trains: Which Are Greener? <br>
<br>
 Monday, 12 December 2011  
&nbsp;|&nbsp; Guest Contributor | Blog Entry <br>

<p><em>Hey Mr. Green, What of the recent claim that trains can be as hard on 
the environment as airplanes?</em>&ndash; Mark in Richmond, California</p> 
<p>Yes, they &quot;can,&quot; but remember that the operative word is 
&quot;can,&quot; not &quot;are,&quot; because not all trains are created equal. 
Some best planes environmentally, and some don't. But a bad rap on trains may 
be spreading because of some rather superficial interpretations of recent 
transit research. So let's try to get the facts straight before right-wing 
pundits start whipping up anti-train sentiment by twisting the truth&mdash;like 
they already have been by dissing everything from hybrid cars to fluorescent 
bulbs to bicycles.</p> 
<p>So it all depends on the kind of train, what type of infrastructure is 
built to support it, where it's located, what kind of energy it runs on, and 
how many passengers ride. It seems fairly obvious that if a train has few 
riders, it may well be burning more fuel per &quot;passenger mile&quot; and 
spewing out more pollution per mile than a packed airplane. Conversely, it may 
emit less per passenger if it's jam-packed.</p> 
<p>But comparing methods of travel gets a lot more complicated when you go 
beyond engine energy and look at the total environmental impact of everything 
from obtaining all the raw materials needed to manufacture everything involved, 
and to build and maintain roads, rails, and airports. Such variables were 
recently analyzed in an astonishing doctoral dissertation by Mikhail V. Chester 
at the University of California, Berkeley. No wonder this document and an 
article by Chester and his dissertation director Arpad Horvath have attracted 
attention to the train/plane question. What these guys do is go way beyond 
comparing energy use and greenhouse gases from vehicles themselves, and look at 
the energy and pollutants (like sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and carbon 
monoxide) generated by processes from the entire life cycle of planes, trains, 
and cars and the infrastructures that support them. Chester even researches the 
impact of maintaining insurance on the various modes of motion!</p> 
<p>What we get from this comprehensive life cycle analysis is what's indicated 
above. For example, the San Francisco Bay Area's electric train-transit system 
known as BART is responsible for substantially less carbon dioxide and nitrous 
oxide emissions per passenger mile than any plane. But Boston's Green Line 
light rail is responsible for slightly more carbon dioxide than midsize and 
large aircraft, but way less nitrous oxide. Yet it almost bumps the top of the 
chart on sulfur dioxide emissions. If Boston were less dependent on fossil 
fuels, the numbers would look very different. In fact, as these researchers 
point out, all comparisons can change drastically if energy sources, 
technologies, and demographics change.</p> 
<p>You'll notice that I mentioned they also compare cars to other modes of 
transportation. Because of this, it seems to me that people who dwell on the 
train/plane issue have got the whole thing upside down. In almost every 
category, planes and trains are far better for the environment than individual 
passenger vehicles. San Francisco's BART accounts for less than half as much 
carbon dioxide per passenger mile as an SUV.&nbsp; But remember, we're talking 
&quot;per passenger mile&quot; throughout. If more people only had the good 
sense and social grace to carpool, motor vehicles would be far less ruinous.</p>
<p>All this should warn us not to use data perversely. A comparison of San 
Francisco's commuter train with a large jet doesn't mean all that much, because 
nobody is flying on the morning commute, though Steve Jobs once reportedly used 
a helicopter. But the fact that a commuter train, whether Boston's or San 
Francisco's is so much better than a car, makes it the best option for such 
areas. What's most useful about this kind of research is that it helps us view 
a system holistically. Yes, that a train might not be the ideal solution, and, 
yes, it could be a boondoggle in the name of environment if it doesn&rsquo;t 
have enough riders or requires intense construction efforts or is too dependent 
on fossil-fuel energy.</p> 
<p>Finally, there's your basic geography. Long commutes and trips to the mall 
from oversized houses out in the sprawl create environmental dilemmas no matter 
what the mode of transportation. After all, New York City's carbon footprint is 
only a third of the national average, thanks to its compactness, transit 
system, and apartments that average half the size of new houses in the suburbs. 
A ban on building in the middle of nowhere might be more important than the 
transportation we choose to get to and from it.</p>

 When 
it comes to moving people this is a real battle sometimes. The U.S. rail system 
is woefully behind the times, as is much of it's infrastructure, due to 
underinvestment. I always have found this odd for a country that prides itself 
on it's technical achievements.<br>
<br>
It should also be said that when it 
comes to cargo, trains beat planes hands down!<br>

<h3>Eco Tip</h3> 
<p>Unplug appliances when not in use. Your electronics&mdash;computers, TVs, 
phone chargers&mdash;use energy even when they're turned off. Stand-by power 
can account for as much as 20% of home energy use. Save both energy and money 
by unplugging your devices, or put them on a power strip that you can turn off 
when they are not in use.&nbsp;More tips...</p> <br>
