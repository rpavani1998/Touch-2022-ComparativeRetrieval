<h2>Do country dogs feel pain less than city dogs?</h2> 
<h3>By Christie Keith</h3> 
<p>October 25, 2007</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I lived in the country for 16 years, and in all that time, I never noticed 
that pain hurts any less when one has cows or horses for neighbors instead of 
an accountant and her engineer husband. I&rsquo;m just saying.</p> 
<p>So I was fascinated by an article in the October issue of DVM magazine 
about a Minnesota veterinarian currently fighting the suspension of his license 
due to questions about his care of a dog with a fractured leg.</p> 
<p>As so often happens when legal and regulatory proceedings get run through 
the media mill, I don&rsquo;t think we can really know the facts of the case 
itself. The dog&rsquo;s owners, the veterinarian, and the state board will have 
to hash that out. But the article raises an issue of concern to all pet owners, 
and it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s long been of huge importance to me: Treating 
and preventing pain in veterinary medicine. From the article:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>For 59 years, Dr. Carl Seemann practiced as northern Minnesota&rsquo;s 
surgical &ldquo;spine man,&rdquo; a solo generalist who, at age 84, saw three 
clients a day until Christmas last year.</p> 
<p>Yet the sudden end of Seemann&rsquo;s long career was no retirement gift. 
It arrived via mail on Minnesota Board of Veterinary Medicine (MBVM) 
letterhead. On the stationary were the words &ldquo;license suspension.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>[....]</p> 
<p>The board&rsquo;s complaint, while initially centered on allegations of an 
orthopedic procedure gone bad, has narrowed to one aspect of veterinary care: 
the postoperative management of pain.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The veterinarian understandably is protesting the suspension, and 
&ldquo;has gone to trial, hired expert witnesses and spent $85,000 defending 
his reputation and his standards of practice.&rdquo; That all makes sense. But 
his specific defense has me scratching my head:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;City people,&rdquo; Seemann argues, live in a different world than 
rural America, where pain-management drug costs often are considered 
impractical. While he acknowledges the public&rsquo;s increasing tendency to 
anthropomorphize animals and demand a higher grade of services, he still 
doesn&rsquo;t use analgesics following spays.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I am absolutely shocked this case has gone this far,&rdquo; Seemann 
says. &ldquo;I just was trusting that this crazy thing couldn&rsquo;t be 
happening to me. I&rsquo;ve always been a very dedicated veterinarian.&rdquo;
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t quite see the provision of surgical pain control falling into 
the category of anthromorphism, nor did his attorney&rsquo;s explanation do 
much for me:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;An allegation has been made that the failure to provide prophylactic 
pain management just because an animal has undergone a procedure is somehow 
below the standard of care,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This case is almost 
antithetical to the concept of pets being considered personal property. If you 
have an automobile and say &lsquo;I want the basics,&rsquo; the repair shop 
will give you the basics. Under the law, veterinarians should still be allowed 
to do that.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So, if I don&rsquo;t treat my dog like an inanimate object, I&rsquo;m 
treating him as if he were a human being? Did we just skip over the option of 
treating him like a dog, a mammal who feels pain, and who recovers from injury, 
illness, and surgery faster and with fewer complications if that pain is 
controlled?</p> 
<p>DVM quotes Dr. Robin Downing, president of the International Veterinary 
Academy of Pain Management and one of the authors of the American Association 
of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) and the American Animal Hospital Association 
(AAHA) pain-management guidelines, as saying:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you that we in veterinary medicine now have enough data 
published that it is inexcusable for any veterinarian not to have a clear 
understanding that it&rsquo;s necessary to help a patient be comfortable 
following surgery&hellip; If there are five practices in a community and three 
embrace the guidelines, they have effectively raised the standard of care in 
that community. Those two other practices will be judged in that context.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Considering that analogy, &ldquo;it appears Dr. Seemann was asleep at the 
wheel,&rdquo; (Minnesota Board of Veterinary Medicine exectutive director Dr. 
John) King contends. &ldquo;Our bottom line is to protect the public. People 
shouldn&rsquo;t believe that if they live in Podunk the practice of medicine is 
anything less than in the city,&rdquo; he says.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>King also said, &ldquo;(T)his is not about failing to give pain medication 
for a hangnail. This is about orthopedic surgery.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The article is here. What do you think? What do you want for your dogs and 
cats by way of pain management? Do you think you usually get it?</p>

<p>you mean to tell me, when i move to the country, my pets won&rsquo;t need 
pain meds?! umm, ok.</p> 
<p>i think it&rsquo;s up to vets to stay very current and always inform their 
patients and give them choices. i&rsquo;ve had several young cats spayed at 
once with varying recovery results in the pain and picking at the stitches 
areas. my dog is EXTREMELY pain sensitive, where as one of my rescues who went 
through bladder surgery wasn&rsquo;t (damn! that boy bounced back well!) i 
think pet parents should be given the info and each case should be discussed by 
the vet. they need to know the pros and cons of the meds and what to expect. i 
stopped the pain meds on my bladder boy early. basically tapered off petty 
quick as he dictated. i think we could have lived anywhere, and his pain 
management would have been the same {rolls eyes}</p> 
<p>my vets are both traditional and holistic, so we basically get a choice of 
care and a run down on the different choices. now they know the route i want to 
go, so we generally start there and talk about future options, unless they feel 
traditional my be better. i expect a vet to treat the particular animal and 
inform me of my choices (with full explanations including drug effects and 
interactions) with back up info. animals do not have cookie cutter solutions 
anymore than we do (sorry big pharma!) i can&rsquo;t imagine my pain sensitive 
dog going through ortho without pain meds. or even the average not so sensitive 
dog. they may just not need as much, but i would like to know they could have 
what they needed!</p> 
<p>and if they think i&rsquo;m projecting feelings onto my dog, i challenge 
them to manage her when she&rsquo;s in pain. and that includes getting her to 
eat.</p>

<p>While this vet is trying to frame the issue as country/city, I thihk 
it&rsquo;s more a function of age of vet.</p> 
<p>In my own experience, (suburban Philadelphia where the local vets pride 
themselves on having the Penn Vet School close at hand), my 35+ years of 
practice vets are fairly slow to hand out pain meds. I don&rsquo;t remember 
being given pain meds when any of my animals were spayed (Persians 20 years ago 
and Pepper 5 years ago). In fact, when Pepper was attacked by a Dalmation (this 
was one troubled dog) 3 years ago and required surgery to close the wounds, my 
vet (who I know genuinely cares about her) very specifically told me that he 
WASN&rsquo;T givening her pain meds &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s a Border Collie 
and I want her to rest. If she feels better, she&rsquo;ll do too much. The pain 
will tell her to rest and that&rsquo;s what she needs.&rdquo; I spent days 
sitting next to her, just gently stroking her as she laid there in pain &mdash; 
I felt so bad for her as she seemed miserable, but &mdash; prior to finding 
this site &mdash; I thought we were doing the right thing.</p> 
<p>So, I think this &ldquo;difference in treatment&rdquo; is more a function 
of the vet&rsquo;s age rather than location. But I&rsquo;ve also found that the 
city/country arguement plays better in country courts, so I&rsquo;m not 
surprised the lawyer is playing up that angle.</p>

<p>Well, as perhaps the only blogger here that is from a farm background I 
have to weigh in.</p> 
<p>There most definately is a difference between attitudes on pain between 
city and farm (notice I said farm and not just rural) people.</p> 
<p>This extends to humans as well. This stems from the specific type of work 
ethic that says that you get up and do your job and just block that bad knee 
from your thoughts because there isnt anyone else there to do it. Many the 
times I went out on cold winter mornings with colds and flu and various 
injuries and found a way to get it done.</p> 
<p>This can extend to animals from farms who have their routines too and I 
think just getting outside is part of that. Certainly, if you sit inside 
staring at the TV to see what Briteny is up to today you become more aware of 
your condition than you would be if you were preoccupied with milking sixty 
cows in a stantion barn. I have seen dogs with terrible injuries who are used 
to being with the boss who you would think would just not want to get up become 
disraught at the prospect of not being where they were supposed to be and will 
hobble out on three legs or crawl if they have to to be with the boss. Its a 
sick sick dog in that life who will not respond in this way.</p> 
<p>I think you have to look at the animal in each situation. They can tell you 
if they are in distress by their eyes and their actions. Failure to attempt 
normal activity is certainly a sign that they need some help and I suspect this 
vet would tell you that.</p> 
<p>But, do not discount the natural pain relief of simply not dwelling on it. 
That at least is where he is coming from and it may well have something to do 
with age. People with that ethic and commitment to their lives and work are 
harder and harder to find. Modern ideas of the pan-pharmacopia have simply not 
gained their respect and depending on the details which we do not know, you 
shouldnt sit in automatic harsh judgement.</p>

<li> 
<p>My response to this comes from a number of angles:</p> 
<p>1) Recall the recent thread on Rimadyl and other NSAIDS, and the whole 
question on whether or not vets were adequately educating their patients on 
what to be aware of when such drugs were given out. I think the responses on 
that thread pretty much established that vets are NOT doing a good job of 
informing their clients about the pros and cons of administered NSAIDS. I 
remain leary of the use of Rimadyl, and yet - as a cat owner whose cat is in 
today for her spay surgery - the whole question of pain management/Rimadyl in 
particular is very much on my mind as an inadequately-resolved issue.</p> 
<p>2) Many of us have experienced how stoic our pets CAN be in the face of 
pain. When I was in school, I was simply told that animals have &ldquo;a higher 
pain threshhold&rdquo;. Whether or not hard scientific evidence exists to 
support such a statement, it is well entrenched in the consciousness of many 
veterinary practitioners.</p> 
<p>3) What I describe in #2 above is the primary reason - I believe - that 
postoperative pain medications have not traditionally been a part of customary 
veterinary practice.</p> 
<p>4) On the &ldquo;city v.s. country&rdquo; thing - I do believe there is a 
difference here, and that - in addition to the factors Bernie describes - that 
it is also influenced by the daily practices of animal husbandry used on 
agricultural animals. Pain meds are not only NOT routinely used in a lot of 
procedures, but they are in fact generally prohibited (I don&rsquo;t remember 
exactly how the guidelines go) due to the fact that an animal who is destined 
to become part of the human food chain cannot carry pharmaceutical drugs in its 
system.</p> 
<p>In addition, there are the economics of agricultural practices. If I am a 
pig farmer and I have to neuter 200 baby pigs, it would be pretty costly to go 
through pain management (and this includes anesthesia during the procedure) for 
all of them. You just go into the pig yard, grab one of those little boys by 
his hind legs, lop off his &ldquo;privates&rdquo;, slap on a brushfull of 
iodine, and go on to the next one. This is what farmers get used to doing with 
their livestock, and so telling them that their dogs and cats require more than 
that just doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fit&rdquo; into their worldview. (Am I 
generalizing here? You bet! But having gone to school in a rural community 
taking coursework having to do with small animal care, I saw this dichotomy - 
and heard it spoken to me from fellow students who were in the Agricultural 
programs - on a daily basis. They just didn&rsquo;t see the point in expending 
that kind of money and effort on the care of their cats and dogs.)</p> 
<p>All that having been said, I&rsquo;m not sure Dr. Seemann is being 
well-served. It was pretty clear to me that emerging trends in pain management 
have NOT been codified in any formal way. It&rsquo;s not unlike the emerging 
trends in new vaccination protocols, for example. Nowadays you can pretty 
easily find a vet who&rsquo;ll agree to forego yearly vaccs, but not that many 
years ago, a lot of vets were afraid for their licensure if they did NOT 
vaccinate yearly. And back then, who could have predicted which way the 
pendulum would swing? There was nothing formalized, and the vets who were 
fearful to depart from a yearly protocol were not being entirely unreasonable 
in that fear.</p> 
<p>The valid point I think Dr. Seemann has is that if there are going to be 
actionable changes in accepted practice, then there needs to be some more 
formal mechanism put in place than just &ldquo;you should know about this stuff 
because it&rsquo;s what everyone else is doing now&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Well, as someone who lives with chronic pain, I whole heartedly advocate 
pain management. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t suck it up and go 
to work and do housework and take care of my dogs and live my life. But boy, a 
little bit of medical help does make all of that easier. The excuse that 
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s just the way it&rsquo;s done around here&rsquo; or that 
that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s been done in the past, or that farmers are 
desensitized to stock animal pain is no excuse. Just because pigs have been 
neutered without anethesia and after care in the past, doesn&rsquo;t make it 
right. And as far as keeping a pet quiet after injury or surgery, and pain 
management making it harder, that&rsquo;s where crates come in handy. Sorry if 
I&rsquo;ve ruffled any feathers, but this topic hits too close to home. There 
is no doubt in my mind that not offering pain management is cruelty.</p> 
<p>Comment by Cardimom &mdash; October 26, 2007 @ 8:29 am </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>I too grew up in an agricultural community and support Bernie&rsquo;s view 
that there is a different way of looking at things &mdash; not wrong or bad, 
just different. I can see where a person might refuse to pay for analgesic 
drugs, perceiving them to be unnecessary. I also support TOP&rsquo;s POV.</p> 
<p>Heck even just a few years ago (3 and 5), I was not sent home with 
painkillers following spay/neuter surgeries. And these were not surgeries done 
in &ldquo;podunk&rdquo; locations &mdash; they were done in suburban clinics. 
It&rsquo;s been only in the last 2 years that I&rsquo;ve come home with 
Deramaxx or Rimadyl after various procedures. Age of the vet has not been a 
contributing factor. This seems to be another area of vet practice where views 
of what is the appropriate protocol have changed rapidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The excuse that &lsquo;that&rsquo;s just the way it&rsquo;s done 
around here&rsquo; or that that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s been done in the past, 
or that farmers are desensitized to stock animal pain is no excuse.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Cardimom, there&rsquo;s a difference between an explanation and an excuse. 
Taken in the context of traditional agricultural practices, this entire 
question becomes more complex than a simple &ldquo;right v.s. wrong&rdquo; 
question.</p> 
<p>Yes - it was hard for me to understand how my fellow students were so 
dismissive of what I felt to be a minimum acceptable standard of care for pet 
dogs and cats. However, as I learned more about the normal husbandry practices 
they were being taught as reasonable and acceptable, their viewpoint made more 
sense to me. Not from the standpoint of me agreeing with them - but rather, 
from the standpoint of me gaining a better understanding of how their viewpoint 
had come to be formed.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if USDA rules allow anesthesia and pain management in 
animals destined for the human food chain even to this day. But knowing the 
reality of what is being taken for granted in those whose livelihood is based 
on these kinds of animal husbandry practices helps one at least understand 
where these ideas come from - a first and very necessary step if there is ever 
goind to be any reasoned discussion on such questions.</p> 
<p>Comment by The OTHER Pat &mdash; October 26, 2007 @ 9:05 am </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Amazing&mdash;this topic came up with some of my clients yesterday. They 
were complaining that clinics are guilting pet owners into tests and meds that 
are not really needed and are taking their business to vet clinics that are not 
run that way.</p> 
<p>I reside in a rural area outide of a major urban sprawl. How animals are 
managed and cared for here is vastly different between households but also 
definately not the urban model.</p> 
<p>We have two veterinary clinics and I&rsquo;ve worked with all of them for 
years. We also have a horse vet that commutes up to treat the ranches and 
private horses around these parts.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, it is a choice. Each case is different and each animal responds 
differently.</p> 
<p>Animals are hardwired differently and most wild animals do not show signs 
of weakness or illness until severely along. I believe a vestigial component 
remains active in domestic animals which is why you don&rsquo;t always identify 
or see pain.</p> 
<p>Some animals do not show any symptoms of pain and their activity remains 
normal after procedures. Some do not.</p> 
<p>Something not brought up yet is the increasing tendency of some clinics to 
boost their profitability through additional sales of specialty foods, drugs, 
and other pet owner needs.</p> 
<p>In this area, the big chain (VCA) has lost a large number of clients 
because they have become too corporate and to uninterested.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a long standing professional relationship with the clinic 
since the early 1990s and I won&rsquo;t go there any more either.</p> 
<p>Here is my short story, when my vet called in a pain medication 
prescription (she was coming up to euthanize my dog) the week of the 
euthanasia, the clinic refused&mdash;stating that my dog had to come in for an 
exam.</p> 
<p>In the past, my professional standing in the local animal community has 
always been met with professional courtesy and this was ridiculous&mdash;leave 
the animal in pain because they wanted to examine him?</p> 
<p>Because my vet was in another area and couldn&rsquo;t dispense the meds the 
local clinic would not even honor the request from another vet. Okay, so I went 
elsewhere and got it and immediately saw relief on his face&mdash;broke my 
heart.</p> 
<p>What I hear from my clients is that they get additional fee after fee for 
tests and other preventative care practices. They don&rsquo;t like it and the 
fees are prompting people to not get vet care or to drive an hour and a half or 
more to get veterinary care.</p> 
<p>Selecting random clinics and practioners is not an answer. As mentioned 
previously, our animal management standards are NOT national or cross industry.
</p> 
<p>Finally, it is up to the pet owner to decide what is needed with guidance. 
So how far does that go? How many people reading have had similar problems with 
human doctors who do not outline options or side effects?</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this matter was handled wisely and believe it is a 
symptom of change that is in the air concerning animal care and management.</p> 
<p>Until management of livestock for food consumption is done humanely, 
regulation and enforcement how animals are being managed in their households is 
standardized, changes in the sheltering and animal service standards are 
consistent, this is just another mess to take up court time. Slapping one hand 
when there are a ton of others operating in the same way is not the solution.

<p>In a rural practise I would expect to have to ask for pain management like 
lidocaine and NSAIDs, but I would ask at the beginning and insist on it. Even 
if a vet doesn&rsquo;t do this routinely they shopuld certainly be capable of 
doing it upon request.</p> 
<p>re: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if USDA rules allow anesthesia and pain 
management in animals destined for the human food chain even to this day.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Yes, they vertianly do&mdash;under labelled use or AMDUCA and with an 
appropriate withdrawal period. It isn&rsquo;t common but it most certainly is 
entirely legal, possible and safe for public health as NSAID withdrawal periods 
are only a few days (4-7, typically). Some large animals vets do routinely use 
local anelgesic and anesthetics for all invassive proceduries.</p>

<p>I, too, live with chronic pain. I can choose to medicate it or not 
depending on other factors. But having been through surgeries and broken bones 
and painful burns I know that I do sometimes choose pain relief. On the other 
hand, my animals have no choice. I make that choice for them. Am I to decide, 
that because I have a strong work ethic (it&rsquo;s got to be done and if not 
me, who?) I should choose to leave my companions in pain? In that case, if I 
should become unable to make the choice for myself, should I be left in pain 
because I live in a rural area, or because the pain will &ldquo;keep me 
quiet&rdquo;?</p> 
<p>I firmly believe that appropriate pain management should be a part of 
veterinary care. I believe those responsible for pets should try to avoid 
unnecessary suffering. If rest is important, I already have ways to limit my 
pets activities to a therapeutic level.</p> 
<p>If I ever break my back again, I sure hope that my physician doesn&rsquo;t 
point out that we live in a remote rural area and that consequently I do not 
need medication.</p>

<p><i>Modern ideas of the pan-pharmacopia have simply not gained their respect 
and depending on the details which we do not know, you shouldnt sit in 
automatic harsh judgement.</i></p> 
<p>I am not sitting in judgment on this vet. As I said, there are lots of 
facts in this case, we don&rsquo;t know them, and the media often gives only 
bits and pieces of a story.</p> 
<p>But I can and do evaluate the actual words and facts themselves, as 
statements. And when incorrect medical information is given, I defintely judge 
it. There is no other responsible thing to do.</p> 
<p>I do not agree that this is all &ldquo;gray area&rdquo; stuff. There is not 
one study to support the idea that letting animals or people &ldquo;tough it 
out&rdquo; is better than managing their pain.</p> 
<p>And it&rsquo;s not all big pharma, either. Many of the pain control 
techniques are other than drugs &mdash; physical therapy, massage, 
hydrotherapy, acupuncture, supplements, lifestyle changes.</p> 
<p>Taking pain seriously as a medical issue is not about work ethic or values.
</p> 
<p>The moral judgment of an individual who takes or fails to take pain 
seriously is absolutely dependent on their viewpoint, education, lifestyle, 
cultural issues, etc.</p> 
<p>So the question is not: Is this vet, or other vets with this 
attitude/belief system, good, evil, or somewhere in between &mdash; which we 
can&rsquo;t know and isn&rsquo;t, to me, the point &mdash; or are the 
statements of fact themselves correct.</p> 
<p>Animals, and people, recover faster and with fewer complications from 
surgery and injury if their pain is controlled. There are perfectly good people 
who don&rsquo;t know that or don&rsquo;t believe it. I just don&rsquo;t want 
any of them treating my dogs, or me.</p>

<p><i>Because my vet was in another area and couldn&rsquo;t dispense the meds

<p>In defense of that clinic, it would be a violation of pharmacy laws &mdash; 
it would be ILLEGAL &mdash; for them to dispense this medication to anyone not 
their patient.</p> 
<p>Only pharmacies may dispense drugs on a prescription. Even though it is 
frequently done that one clinic &ldquo;fills a prescription&rdquo; for a vet 
out of the area or even a local vet who doesn&rsquo;t carry the drug in 
question, it&rsquo;s absolutely against the law.</p> 
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t your vet just call in the prescription to a pharmacy? Even 
if it was a veterinary drug, some pharmacies do carry those, and if they 
didn&rsquo;t, pretty much every drug I can think has a human counterpart 
that&rsquo;s close enough.</p> 
<p>The pain control point is well taken, but I think the pharmacy issue is 
also very important here.</p>

<p>rural vs city&hellip; you know, it&rsquo;s not that different with people.
<br> Folks who live in rural areas are more stoical about pain too&hellip; 
it&rsquo;s partly cultural and partly practical (there aren&rsquo;t nearby 
medical practioners)</p> 
<p>Comment by EmilyS &mdash; October 26, 2007 @ 12:43 pm </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>EmilyS, you said it best.<br>
 But in my experience it is a much deeper 
cultural view. The best comparisson I can make is to Zen Bhudism. I have seen 
farmers in their 80&rsquo;s limping around completely surpressing severe 
arthritis symptoms and not thinking a bit of it except to cuss a bit when they 
can&rsquo;t grip something as well as needed or perhaps can&rsquo;t climb a 
ladder.</p> 
<p>I could also tell some stories about standard agricultural procedures that 
have not changed that much like castration that is never done with any form of 
anasthesia that would have a PETA purson chewing their own limb off.</p> 
<p>An old line vet or farmer would watch the animal carefully and make sure 
that it is not rigid or distracted. Then, non drug methods would be used such 
as massage or warm or cold compresses long before the pills came out. But even 
those would in fact use it if nothing else was working.</p> 
<p>I have seen animals tear their stitches out many times and think nothing of 
it. This is not to say that they do not feel pain but I am convinced that they 
prioritise it differently. When an animal is in decided pain the behavior 
changes and a practiced eye can spot this.</p> 
<p>Now if a hurried urban vet in their tightly scheduled modern practices 
doesnt have time they are many more times likely to hand over the pills. It 
prevents re-visits and possibility of pain developing without having the 
&ldquo;waste&rdquo; that well managed time&hellip;</p> 
<p>Also, country vets are more likely to be dealing with someone who is 
themselves more experienced with animals and vet care than the average urban 
pet owner. I offer myself as an example. I began school in pre vet med but 
ended up in ag, have worked as an artificial inseminator and have assisted vets 
in any number of procedures. I know what to look for and so would any of my 
farmer friends.</p> 
<p>As a result, in these communities it is simply not necessary to use drugs 
as a blanket prophelactic because that is what the owner is for.</p> 
<p>I think these days, younger vets do not understand this and the collission 
of rural and urban populations are creating a mismatch of intentions and 
expectations.</p> 
<p>I happen to be doing some writing on this very subject but it is fiction 
involving the changing of the guard (as it were) in rural communities.</p>

<p>Re comment &ldquo;Folks who live in rural areas are more stoical about pain 
too&hellip; it&rsquo;s partly cultural and partly practical (there aren&rsquo;t 
nearby medical practioners)&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Response: I doubt that this has ever been scientifically studied [who 
tolerates pain better or who is more stoic, city folk or rural folk] - at least 
no one quoted a source. But I, a city girl, beg to differ. I can tolerate pain 
with the best of them, if not better. And I have. But why should I when it only 
results in a protracted recovery? [Yes, many studies to support this, for both 
animals and humans.]</p> 
<p>My upbringing was that you grin and bear it until it becomes obvious that 
you need pain management. However, as an adult my belief [which IS supported by 
scientific findings] is that reasonable pain management from the outset goes a 
long way towards a faster and uneventful recovery process. Now it&rsquo;s true 
that animals don&rsquo;t know when to take it easy when they are taking pain 
meds, but it&rsquo;s up to the human supervise.</p> 
<p>Judicious pain management should definitely be added to the DVM practice 
guidelines and mandatory CEU courses in this area should be part of licensure 
retention.</p>

<p>This post and subsequent discussion is very timely to me. I&rsquo;m in 
Texas, visiting with friends who run a small working cattle ranch. And I do 
mean WORKING: I flew in on a red eye (no sleep) and then spent 12-plus hours 
helping with ranch chores.</p> 
<p>Yesterday, I went with my friend to pick up some new cattle. Watched as 
they were herded through chutes, squeezed in a contraption I&rsquo;m sure 
someone else will have a name for to be weighed and vaccinated, loaded on to a 
trailer, taken to the vet and then sent through more chutes, squeezed in an 
even more deluxed contraption and then castrated. That last? A couple quick 
slices and that was that. No numbing before, just a wash of the area before and 
after with Betadine solution.</p> 
<p>The veterinarian was fast and skilled, and the procedure was over in 
seconds. On calf didn&rsquo;t even react; the other bawled a little. Half hour 
later, both were grazing in a new pasture as if nothing had ever happened.</p> 
<p>My friends adore and respect their cattle, and so, too, do the people we 
went to pick up the new ones from. They&rsquo;re all into sustainable and 
animal-friendly ranching &mdash; this is not a feedlot or factory farm. The 
animals are healthy and friendly, and they were patted and talked to throughout 
the day. (The vet even offered a sympathetic &ldquo;sorry, guys&rdquo; before 
his work.)</p> 
<p>Weird experience for a city girl, I tell you, but a very interesting and 
thought-provoking one.</p>

<p>Gina, that was a stock chute you were seeing.<br>
 Most vets have portable 
ones but I had built a home made one into my heifer shed that was probably not 
as sophisticated as the ones you saw.<br>
 Many of the portable ones can also 
be tilted to make a kind of operating table if need be.</p> 
<p>What you may not have noticed was that first the vet observed the animals 
post procedure for a bit. He probably just looked back at them briefly and just 
looked at their gait to make certain that none of them were walking stiffly and 
then a little closer to see if there was any excessive bleeding. Then the owner 
would have checked them later for the same things. To a casual observer they 
might as well have been just taking in the view.</p> 
<p>Lynn,<br>
 I am not talking about toughing it out or working thru the pain. 
I am talking about being able to just not feel it.<br>
 Maybe I cant sight a 
study but I have watched it again and again in both animals and humans and 
well&hellip; there it is.</p> 
<p>I think that rural (meaning farm rural not just gentlemen farmers) are more 
active and put a higher priority on doing their daily tasks where I have seen 
any number of city folk sit in their easy chairs and focus on their ills 
instead of their lives.</p> 
<p>Hang around any group of older people and the bulk of the conversation will 
be their latest afliction. Do the same in a farming community and that part of 
the talk will take less than a minute. If you ask a farmer how things are going 
he is likely to respond &ldquo;Gotta go!&rdquo;. Ask a city dweller and you are 
more likely to hear how their back is acting up again.</p> 
<p>I firmly believe that you can teach yourself not to feel pain as you can 
also teach yourself to feel every little ache.<br>
 I think this is the normal 
state for most animals who aren&rsquo;t apt to sit and dwell on what just 
happened to them.</p>

<p>Gina, you may or may not be aware of Temple Grandin and her work on 
livestock squeeze chutes:</p> 
<p>http://welcome.colostate.edu/i.....ms_grandin</p> 
<p>Temple Grandin is autistic. When she was young, she noticed how the 
pressure of the squeeze chutes seemed to calm the cattle. She related that to 
her own experiences of being calmed by the application of uniform, steady 
pressure, and built a &ldquo;squeeze chute&rdquo; for herself that she found 
helped her calm down when she became very agitated.</p> 
<p>As an adult, she has formalized this field of study into studies on humane 
livestock animal management. She has redesigned a lot of the squeeze chutes and 
other livestock restraint systems so that they are safer and even more 
effective at calming animals.</p> 
<p>Her work - as well as her personal history - is truly fascinating.</p>

<p>Which would matter more if, number one, hiding pain wasn&rsquo;t a survival 
strategy for animals in the wild, where being impaired increases your chance of 
being dinner for another animal, and number two and most importantly, study 
after study in humans and animals hadn&rsquo;t shown that recovery time is 
shortened and complications are lessened when pain is controlled.</p> 
<p>That is the bottom line. You can speculate all you want that animals 
don&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel&rdquo; pain because you can&rsquo;t observe it, but 
research doesn&rsquo;t support that view, even if it&rsquo;s rational.</p> 
<p>The argument that people who believe this aren&rsquo;t monsters is 
absolutely valid, but so is the argument that they&rsquo;re incorrect to

<p>Bernie, hopefully you have also observed this in city people and animals. 
If you haven&rsquo;t, you should.</p> 
<p>Nonetheless, ignoring pain takes energy that might be better used elsewhere.
</p> 
<p>The REAL question is this: What kind of recovery do you want? If you want 
the fastest and best recovery without adverse effects, then pain management 
might be indicated. If you choose to go the stoic route because that&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;what we did in my family&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s sissy to take pain 
meds&rdquo; then you&rsquo;re not in tune with today&rsquo;s modern practices.
</p> 
<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m talking about JUDICIOUS and medically ADVISED pain 
management.</p> 
<p>Seriously, if you have a headache you take a Tylenol. Who wants to tough it

<p>Lynn says &ldquo;Seriously, if you have a headache you take a Tylenol. Who

<p>For every action, there&rsquo;s a consequence. I don&rsquo;t pop a Tylenol 
for every little headache; in fact, I&rsquo;m pretty pill adverse, choosing 
natural methods for pain relief. Frankly, pain doesn&rsquo;t deter me much. If 
it did, I&rsquo;d never get out of bed. I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows enough 
about physiology to make routine pill popping truly safe. To each their own.</p>
<p>I personally think we&rsquo;re a pill popping society with everyone looking 
for solutions that come in a prescribed bottle, even for our animals.</p> 
<p>Gina, the castrations that you witnessed were actually pretty humane. Ask 
about the &ldquo;other method&rdquo; and prepare to cringe. But the calves 
don&rsquo;t seem to get all upset about it.</p>

<p>To me, when pain impedes quality of life, pain medication is indicated. My 
cats show little to no pain until they are very, very sick. So I don&rsquo;t 
think that not showing it doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t feeling pain.<br>
 With that said, I am sure there are folks at both ends of the spectrum ~ some 
who overmedicate and some who don&rsquo;t medicate at all.<br>
 I also think 
that all farm animals deserve to be treated humanely (I&rsquo;m a vegetarian) 
and when necessary euthanized humanely. My former in-laws had a small dairy 
farm. I remember one cow who delivered a calf who died. That cow stood where 
her calf had been laying and cried for a very long time. Any animal that can 
express that kind of emotional pain surely deserves to be kept as physically 
comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>We know a lot more about FDA-approved drugs as opposed to herbs, natural 
methods, and supplements, not to mention WHERE these drugs and supplements are 
manufactured and how well [or not] quality-controlled.</p> 
<p>Remember - I said JUDICIOUS use of meds, not pill-popping. Nor do I pop a 
pill for every minor ache. But I&rsquo;ll be darned if I would deny myself the 
choice.</p>

 No I have not seen it in city people. certainly not to the same 
degree which is qhite a wide gulf. In my experience city folks will sit and 
wallow in the discomfort because their work is somewhere else that they do not 
got when they are sick or injured. Farmers live in their work and do not have 
the opportunity to think about it.</p> 
<p>I think its all in the focus of your life. You either controll the pain or 
you are controlled by it. The best way to control it is to look past it. But 
its like telling someong to NOT think of an elephant for a half hour unless you 
are trained for it from little on.</p> 
<p>Animals are like this. They are busy getting on with the things animals do 
and dont sit and focus on it.</p> 
<p>As Gina described, the calves were up and eating within minutes. The 
significance of their injury simply does not occur to them so they simply 
ignore it.</p> 
<p>We as humans have the curse of anticipation and can feel the dentist drill 
long before it enters our mouths. But if you have never been told of the pain 
and come from an experience base that tells you to focus on something else, 
that is what you will do.</p> 
<p>This may be hard to understand is you have not seen it at work but it is 
there none the less. So, its understandable that with your experience you would 
opt for pain killers when others with a different background would not.</p> 
<p>Pet owners tend to be empathetic with their animals and not clinical. In 
truth, there is nothing wrong with that. But there is also nothing wrong with 
the culture I know in managing pain by observation first and medication or 
therapy when indicated. Its both practical and effective IF you know what you 
are doing.</p>

<p>ok, that&rsquo;s it. i&rsquo;m getting pretty darn sick of these 
generalizations. i&rsquo;m a rough and tumble city gal (at the moment) that can 
handle quite a bit and my life can&rsquo;t stop for a freakin&rsquo; hang nail 
which you are getting pretty close to implying. but maybe that was because i 
was born and raised in the burbs, so i&rsquo;m not quite as delicate?! kinda 
funny that i was the one who filled in for my farmer when he was struck with 
lyme and needed help with the Sat CSA. He took it easy while i did the hauling 
etc, even though i had 2 hands healing from an injury (the kind of injury that 
breaks open and bleeds all over, but not too painful). and i was more than 
happy to do it. neither one of us whined or discussed it and everything got 
done. teamwork. understanding. sometimes ya just need some time to heal. which 
my hands had pretty much had. but his body hadn&rsquo;t. he could have gotten 
it done i&rsquo;m guessing, but why should he when i and another could.</p> 
<p>so where do you put us born and bred suburban folks on your pain vs lay 
back and complain scale? and what about the city folks that endure all kinds of 
hardships farm folks wouldn&rsquo;t begin to understand. or just your average 
Construction Dude working through whatever in a heatwave in August in NYC?! 
(which can be deadly, btw)</p> 
<p>us &lsquo;city folk&rsquo; have a lot more backbone than you seem to want 
to believe. you might be better to break it down by up bringing and 
personality. it&rsquo;s an individual thing. not a mass labeling issue. my 
sister would wilt under conditions i take in stride, for example. and as i said 
early on, my dog has a very low pain tolerance, where as some of my rescues 
haven&rsquo;t. should i let her suffer because other dogs are more stoic? and 
before you suggest it&rsquo;s a projected thing by me, believe me, it 
isn&rsquo;t! her behavior is how i would find her injuries. same with my cats.
</p> 
<p>please Bernie, i totally respect you from what you&rsquo;ve written here, 
but people can&rsquo;t be categorized by city folk/farm folk. and you 
can&rsquo;t lump all city folk into one category. i&rsquo;d say most of NYC and 
surrounding is hard working folks that must work through things. think of 
single mothers working more than one job, for example, that can&rsquo;t afford 
to miss work. or me. i&rsquo;m the only one responsible for me and mine. i 
can&rsquo;t just blow things off to sit back and complain and take pain 
killers. and i think you&rsquo;ll find that is the general drift in many urban 
settings. i may be like a farmer in that my work is at home ( ;) ), but many 
city folks go &lsquo;somewhere else&rdquo; to get the job done no matter what. 
they don&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry that you have a false perception of how &ldquo;city 
folks&rdquo; deal with pain. I must say that I am disappointed that you feel I 
&ldquo;would opt for pain killers when others with a different background would 
not.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Some people thrive on suffering, Bernie; I am not one of them and I 
certainly would not perchance this with animals.</p> 
<p>While I may be a city girl, I have seen horses gelded. Not pleasant - it 
was a fast process, but frightening for them being held and controlled.</p> 
<p>I think you need to look beyond your immediate environment. You might be 
surprised at what people in the city endure. We are hardly pill-popping wimps.
</p> 
<p>That said, I will say that pain is arguably a perception with a variety of 
threshholds. I&rsquo;ve got one friend in the deep suburbs who whines with a 
headache; I&rsquo;ve got a 35 year-old cousin, mother of 4 kids under 12, dying 
of cancer in the next 6 months. She lives in the city and is ever so grateful 
for exacting pain management so that her kids have a better experience of what 
is left of their mom.</p> 
<p>And you can also make a good psychological case that those who whine or 
those who overload on drugs probably have serious psych issues [on the farm and 
in the city - mental illness doesn&rsquo;t discriminate].</p> 
<p>EVERY case is unique, every individual different. Perhaps your experiences 
are limited&hellip;..but it&rsquo;s really unfair to make such generalizations.

<p>Lynn, I was born in Chicago and did not come to Wisconsin until I was 13. I 
still have plenty of relatives there and have made a life long study of 
observing the differences first hand.</p> 
<p>Its enough to say that there is a readily visible disconnect between the 
two. People here are seen by IL folk as crude and rough and maybe a little 
dumb. When IL people come here on vacation they are referred to as 
&ldquo;FIBs&rdquo; which does NOT stand for Fine Illinois Boys. They are seen 
as whiney self interested and materialistic.</p> 
<p>When I talk to Chicago relatives they are much more likely to discuse their 
(or another family member&rsquo;s) last operation.</p> 
<p>When I talk to Wisconsinites its more likely to be the weather or some 
aspect of work or life unless someone they know actually died recently.</p> 
<p>For me, coming to Wisconsin was like discovering some lost civilization 
where local vets had their instruments in the back seat of their cars and 
medications in jars in the kitchen cupboard and their wives maintained paper 
ledgers of the accounts. Their clients were skeptical of new advances and 
change happened slowly over generations.</p> 
<p>Those differences are fewer now which may be why this particular event came 
to our attention where it would not have been given a second thought even 
twenty years ago. But the practical, pragmatic and stoic soul of the region is 
still here.</p> 
<p>Just because modern technology has given us new options does not invalidate 
millenia of evolved animal (and human) husbandry.</p>

<p>Bernie, your smug superiority and condescension are not helping you convey 
whatever actual value there may be buried somewhere in what you&rsquo;re saying.
</p> 
<p>Ignoring pain on a conscious level does not mean that the physiological 
effects are not there, or not taking their toll. Appropriate use of pain relief 
eases the physiological strain and makes of a speedier recovery with fewer 
complications; this is amply documented in repeated scientific studies.<i>There 
is nothing practical or pragmatic about ignoring this information.</i> Stoic, 
sure, but &ldquo;practical&rdquo; or &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo;? Sorry, no.</p> 
<p>Just because modern technology has given us new options doesn&rsquo;t mean 
we can&rsquo;t still get from the east coast to the west coast by well-stocked 
wagon train (and it&rsquo;s been done, fairly recently); that the wagon train 
will still work, however, doesn&rsquo;t mean that choosing to do that rather 
than taking a plane is &ldquo;practical&rdquo; or &ldquo;pragmatic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is exactly the kind of disconnect I am talking about.</p> 
<p>The modernists always think they have the next best thing.</p> 
<p>The reason these people are skeptical is that so much of the modern 
solutions that have been presented have failed them.</p> 
<p>Go back and read Silent Spring and you see one of the most obvious. I 
remember products like Lasso and Dual used for anual grass control in corn and 
potatoes that was supposed to be an entirely safe herbiced. Then it was found 
that it was not only carcinogenic but liked to leach down into the water table 
instead of breaking down the way Dupont claimed.</p> 
<p>A non ag example is hormone replacement therapy for women. Breast cancer 
anyone?</p> 
<p>At the turn of the last century there was a man namde Dr. James who 
promoted the &ldquo;James Way&rdquo; of handling livestock. He was a pundit in 
the field and a comtemporary of Kellog, Post and Frank Loyd Wright - all self 
contained practitioners with all the answers&hellip;.</p> 
<p>James founded the Jamesway Corp., a major maker of cattle handling and 
feeding equipment. IT was quality stuff. The company is still in business but 
has merged with competitor Starline to create J-Star.</p> 
<p>James invented the head lock stantion and influenced the Wisconsin dairy 
barn in the same way that Wright affected the prarie style home.</p> 
<p>But as time wore on people discovered on their own that his methods had 
problems and although they were used in thousands of barns later studies showed 
that they were in fact rather inhumane because it restricted the cows movements 
and often lead to severe injuries and even death, certainly losses in animal 
productivity.</p> 
<p>None of James&rsquo; methods are used in new barns anymore. While many 
farmers did a good job in managing their cattle with his equipment no one would 
go back to that again.</p> 
<p>Today we are arguing about how to manage pain in animals. Some see drugs as 
the only alternative and others see it as a last resort.<br>
 Yet the 
proponents of mandatory medication are as likely as not to believe in 
accu-puncture, yoga and meditation for the same purpose all the while refusing 
to believe that there is something very similar at work here.</p> 
<p>The hallmark of rural society is health skepticism being unwilling to 
quickly abandon tried and true methods for the latest bit of research. They 
have learned over the centuries that research is only as thick as the next 
study.</p> 
<p>Is there any better way to observe the gulf between city and country 
attitudes than to read this blog?</p> 
<p>Use the meds if thats what you believe in. But do not dismiss these people 
as a cult or backward or cruel. Their experience is deeper than yours.</p>

<p>Liz, you and others have completely mischaracterized what I am trying to do 
here.</p> 
<p>I love my animals and would never let them suffer for a minute. I had my 
old freind Brandy put to sleep because I thought she was suffering even though 
it broke my heart. If my new pal Scout was injured and aparently in pain I 
would not hesitate to buy the medicine to relieve it.</p> 
<p>These people have no less empathy for their animals than you do but have 
developed different strategies to deal with it that have proven themselves 
successful over an extremely long period of time.</p> 
<p>Quite the contrary to your assertions I am simply asking the non-rural 
among you to reserve judgement on a group of people that have not always been 
served well by the latest technology and are (I would hope) understandably 
skeptical about its benefits and cost.</p> 
<p>Consider organic farming. The rules for the identity of organic milk 
totally prohibit the use of even antibiotics in treating cows for mastitis. 
Non-organic producers must withhold milk from sale for a fixed period depending 
on the drug but organic farmers must take the cow out of production entirely if 
treated.</p> 
<p>Left untreated this condition can cause the complete necrosis of the 
affected quater (cows udders are divided into quaters). It is not at all pretty 
and extremely painful but pain medications are not allwed either!</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m going to say this again for effect: PAIN MEDICATIONS ARE NOT 
PERMITTED IN ORGANIC FARMING!</p> 
<p>I would be much more convinced of the sincerity of the urban consumers 
concern for animal rights if that concern for the animals extended to allowing 
that this same vet would not hesitate to employ.</p>

<p><i>One other poing Lis,</i></p> 
<p>Well, at least this time you paid enough attention to get my name right.</p>
<p><i>In quoting me you plucked out only the side of my comments that were 
negative toward urbanites.</i></p> 
<p>I also pointed out that urbanites have similar prejudices against rurals 
but you chose to ignore that.</p> 
<p>Um, Bernie, you expresed your prejudices against urbanites&mdash;and then 
you expressed some of your other prejudices against urbanites, your beliefs 
about what you think we believe about farm people. I&rsquo;ts like the Madison 
cab driver, who with the friendliest intentions, referred to the 
&ldquo;fact&rdquo; that I think of Wisconsin as &ldquo;flyover country.&rdquo; 
Um, no, sorry, I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve never even heard the phrase<i>except
</i> from midwesterners expressing <i>their beliefs</i> about what people on 
the coasts think about them.</p> 
<p>To provide the balance you think exists in this one-sided sneering contest, 
you&rsquo;d have to either point out negative comments about farmers made by 
others here, or genuinely positive comments you&rsquo;ve made about urban 
people in this discussion.</p> 
<p>Finding either might be a bit of a problem, though.</p>

<p>Oh, and the organic farming thing?</p> 
<p>Right now, there are a several different groups and organizations, with 
competing standards and rules, all vying for primacy as &ldquo;the&rdquo; 
standard for organic foods. That&rsquo;s the reason that the 
&ldquo;organic&rdquo; label on something is of limited to zero value. I 
don&rsquo;t doubt your word that one of them is as kooky as you say. If there 
were any easy way to know what the word &ldquo;organic&rdquo; means on any 
particular package, people would be in a better position to decided whether or 
not it&rsquo;s something they want to support.</p> 
<p>As is, I prefer to be guided by terms that have real meanings, and specific 
information from the companies marketing/producing the foods&mdash;including 
whether or not they&rsquo;ll actually answer specific questions for concerned 
consumers.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t quite see, though, what the shaky and 
unreliable meaning of the word &ldquo;organic&rdquo; has to do with whether or 
not you give appropriate pain relief to a pet you claim to regard as a member 
of the family, or just decide for them that they&rsquo;re just going to have to 
&ldquo;ignore&rdquo; the pain because pain meds are for city wusses.</p> 
<p>Comment by Lis &mdash; October 29, 2007 @ 8:45 am </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Yes, companies like Wal-Mart have in fact diluted that standard but my 
comments still stand.</p> 
<p>The issue is: What exactly is &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; treatment?</p> 
<p>According to your experience automatically assuming pain is the only 
allowable course of treatment. This so much so that Lynn wants to pull the 
man&rsquo;s license if he does not conform. Yet none of your are vets rural or 
otherwise.</p> 
<p>But I have repeatedly said (and you have ignored it) that what these vets 
do is rely on actual observations of the animal that effectively lets the 
animal themselves request the meds. I know of no vet or rural pet owner who 
would knowingly allow their animal to suffer and I reject any characterization 
to that end.</p>

<p>Lis, Here is my full quote&hellip;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Its enough to say that there is a readily visible disconnect between 
the two. People here are seen by IL folk as crude and rough and maybe a little 
dumb. When IL people come here on vacation they are referred to as 
&ldquo;FIBs&rdquo; which does NOT stand for Fine Illinois Boys. They are seen 
as whiney self interested and materialistic.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Notice that I was pointing out that each sees the other in a different 
light and not exclusively attacking city folk.</p> 
<p>If it seemed that way in other places it is because it is my perception 
that in this thread it is the rural philosphy that is under assault.</p>

<li> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;companies like Wal-Mart&rdquo;; the standards 
for what&rsquo;s &ldquo;organic&rdquo; and what&rsquo;s not are genuinely in 
flux.</p> 
<p>As for assuming pain or not&mdash;I&rsquo;ll yield to the guys on the 
question of whether castration is a sufficient physical trauma to warrant pain 
relief. In the case of major surgery or major physical trauma, though, sorry, 
yes, pain is a physiological fact, and you can disbelieve in it all you want; 
it&rsquo;s still there, and like gravity, it still has real physical effects. 
Gravity will cause you to fall to the gorund if you jump out a window, even if 
you sincerely believe you&rsquo;re Superman, and untreated pain following major 
surgery or physical trauma will slow your recovery and potentially cause 
complications&mdash;even if you think you&rsquo;re Superman and can just 
&ldquo;ignore&rdquo; the pain into non-existence. That&rsquo;s because pain is 
real and physical, and it uses energy and physiological resources to 
&ldquo;ignore&rdquo; it, that could better be spent on<i>healing</i>.</p>

<p>Bernie, are you aware that many, many professionals in many, many fields 
are required to provide evidence of yearly training to remain current in their 
fields in order to maintain their licensure? This has NOTHING to do with being 
&ldquo;held hostage&rdquo; or &ldquo;re-education camps&rdquo;. This is simply 
an acknowledgement that a responsible professional remains up-to-date with the 
new findings in their field. That&rsquo;s WHY the acronym &ldquo;CEU&rdquo; for 
&ldquo;Continuing Education Unit&rdquo; is such a widely understood concept. 
You don&rsquo;t go to school in a professional field, and 20 years later 
continue practicing based on 20 year old knowledge that has never been updated.
</p> 
<p>The open, educated mind WELCOMES the opportunity to remain current on new 
findings and new learnings - regardless of whether or not all of these things 
get incorporated into one&rsquo;s personal practice.</p> 
<p>Comment by The OTHER Pat &mdash; October 30, 2007 @ 6:45 am </p> </li>

<p>Bernie, right about now you probably feel pretty maligned. Normally, I stay 
out of discussions like this, but I felt compelled this time to speak.</p> 
<p>You are clearly an intelligent, articulate individual. I was born into a 
city background, spent several years in the US Army, settled into a rural 
setting for a decade, and currently reside in more of a city environment. I 
understand your viewpoint as it relates to the differences between city and 
country living, completely.</p> 
<p>I think what&rsquo;s setting folks off here, however, is that you&rsquo;re 
presenting your pain management thoughts (which, in and of themselves, do 
promote an understanding, if not agreement, with the rural mindset) through 
your rural/city perception as if that perception were a universal truth.</p> 
<p>Which, of course, it isn&rsquo;t, &lsquo;though I can empathize that it 
feels that way from where you sit.</p> 
<p>You are dismissing pre-emptive pain management out-of-hand because you 
believe the concept is a soft city-folk idea and not worthy of rural 
consideration. What if you&rsquo;re wrong? You say the current lack of pain 
management has worked for years and years. What if pre-emptive pain management 
allowed those animals to return to full health sooner? Or even saved the lives 
of some that just couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;work&rdquo; through the pain?</p> 
<p>If you remove the negative &ldquo;city-soft&rdquo; connotation you&rsquo;ve 
attached to pain management and consider it simply on its own merits, even 
disregarding the many studies that show healing occurs faster in the absence of 
pain (which I don&rsquo;t), there&rsquo;s no harm in granting an animal relief, 
be it a cow, a working dog, or a housecat. Given that, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?

<p>That may be what you <i>think</i> you are doing. In reality, though, <i>you
</i> are the one who has repeatedly and persistently described the people you 
disagree with in insulting and demeaning terms. City people 
&ldquo;wallow&rdquo; in our pain. They are &ldquo;whiney(sic) and 
self-indulgent and materialistic.&rdquo; Rural people are &ldquo;pragmatic and 
practical.&rdquo; We should defer to the judgment of rural people because 
&ldquo;their experience is deeper than your own.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You do not just disagree, but actively express your <i>disrespect</i> for 
anyone who &ldquo;believes in&rdquo; (apparently, in your imagination, similar 
to &ldquo;believing in&rdquo; astrology) the effectiveness of pain medication 
as demonstrated by<i>both</i> personal experience and extensive, 
well-documented, medical research.</p> 
<p>And you&rsquo;re offended by the suggestion that veterinarians, including 
rural veterinarians, should be required to take some number of Continuing 
Education Units every year. You describe this as &ldquo;re-education 
camp&rdquo;&mdash;and please, no whining that you&rsquo;re not calling us all 
un-American commies when you use that particular phrase; that&rsquo;s where it 
comes from and that&rsquo;s the image you intend to provoke. We&rsquo;re 
supposed to be afraid to keep arguing, lest we be tarred as evil unAmerican<i>
commies! Sorry, I&rsquo;m not playing your game.</i></p> 
<p>CEU requirements are <i>standard</i> across a wide range of licensed 
professions. Lawyers. Accountants. Teachers. Nurses. Doctors&hellip;what was 
that last one? Doctors??? Human doctors, who only have to keep up with the 
state of knowledge in the medical field for<i>one</i> species? Yup, human 
doctors.</p> 
<p>Would you care to explain to us why you think it&rsquo;s so insulting to 
suggest that veterinarians, treating multiple species and not knowing for sure 
which species is either going to come in the door or require a housecall next, 
should be required to take some Continuing Education Units, so that they stay 
current and aware of what&rsquo;s going on in their field, regardless of 
whether any particular development seems applicable to their patient &amp; 
client base?</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s some mighty big chip you&rsquo;ve got on your shoulder, Bernie.
<i>No one</i> participating in this discussion has described you or your farmer 
buddies in anything remotely comparable to the terms you&rsquo;ve described 
city people in, and you regard even the most mundance suggestion that 
veterinarians shoud be treated like any other licensed profession. And yes, by 
the way, those CEU requirements for lawyers and doctors<i>do</i> apply to rural 
practitioners just as much as to urban practitioners. No free passes for being 
morally superior to us weak, lazy, corrupt city people.</p>

<p>I think that rural people are insulted by the continual insinuation that 
they are somehow less educated or backward or stupid compared to city people.
</p> 
<p>If you are interested in education why dont we all come down to my farm for 
a minute and take a class on accumulated farm knowledge 101.</p> 
<p>Why do we feel pain?</p> 
<p>When you sprain your ankle your ankle is sending you a message that - hey - 
you had better not use me for a while. We have a problem down here.</p> 
<p>Now, you can use a cane or a crutch and you can go to a doctor and have him 
give you an ankle brace to keep you off of it. You can also ask for something 
for the pain that will not cure the ankle but will make it feel just fine.</p> 
<p>But, if you go out and run a marathon you are likely to do yourself a huge 
amount of harm. In fact substances like &ldquo;bute&rdquo; have been illegally 
in horse racing for years to convince them to do exactly that.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone has figured out how to have a conversation 
with a dog or cow or cat explaining that although they might well feel much 
better after they get this pill they still should stay off that leg and not go 
chasing rabbits.</p> 
<p>Pain tells the dog the lay still and is doing you and your pooch or 
whatever a great service. It reminds them to stay off the limb until it feels 
better which is the appropriate time to resume normal activity.</p> 
<p>Of course, the effect of pain and its severity have to be monitored closely 
and unless you have the ability to fully sedate the dog or restrain him or 
otherwise enforce the inactivity sometimes the message that pain sends is 
exceedingly useful.</p> 
<p>If you dont think that pain can be a useful tool in managing the behavior 
of animals consider what an electric fence does. It teaches the heifer not to 
go there where she might get into trouble.</p> 
<p>Similarly, shock collars for dogs are used for all kinds of training from 
teaching a hunting dog not to run too far afield to preventing a dog from 
barking excessively in town. NO, I dont use these things myself but I can also 
accept that a particularly defyant dog can be saved from loss or death if 
nothing else works.</p> 
<p>A wise vet can also use observations of pain to diagnose other problems or 
an animals lack of progress in healing which are completely negated when it is 
medicated. In fact even the most modern vet schools will teach this in 
discussing diagnostic skills.</p> 
<p>Pain is an important feature of evolution and an entirely natural 
informative tool and as long as it does get out of hand and become debilitating 
any animal can and does use it effectively to help in the healing process.</p> 
<p>These are the things that people who have spent their lives close to 
animals know. Their education comes from many lifetimes of observations and 
wise vets will accept this and learn from it themselves.</p> 
<p>As long as people choose to intrude into their lives and livelihood there 
is always going to be that disconnect and resentment I see festering here.</p> 
<p>Before you imply that someone does not know what they should know, best you 
are certain that you know all you should and not assume that you have nothing 
to learn from them.</p> 
<p>No CEUs, sorry. But if you are wise you will take something from it.</p>

<p>OK, so I&rsquo;ve been reading this for a few days now, from a Texas cattle 
ranch. I really do think people need to step out of themselves sometimes (and 
I&rsquo;m NOT singling anyone out here) and look at the situation from outside 
their own point of view.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in the state of mind that is urban California, most of my 
life. (Although mind you, Sacramento is an urban oasis in the midst of some of 
the biggest ag counties in the nation &mdash; from Shasta, Butte, Sutter and 
Yuba all the way down to the Nos. 1 and 2 ag counties in the world, Fresno and 
Tulare.) I&rsquo;ve also lived in the very rural and very poor fishing and 
timber communities of Franklin County, Florida. Have a passing knowledge of 
rural Texas (this morning I notice bruising from where a ranch gate hit me, and 
a cut from a barbed-wire fence!) and other parts of this truly interesting and 
diverse country.</p> 
<p>I have always, always found that everyone has something to offer, and 
something to say, if you just shut up and LISTEN for a while.</p> 
<p>Nobody here is saying rural people are bumpkins. Certainly not me. This 
weekend I listened to a PhD economist and a board-certified veterinary 
internist, both women, both ranchers, as well as a country vet and some really 
good smart stock hands. (One of whom was a young man of around 16.)</p> 
<p>I listened to an explanation of advanced artificial insemination techniques 
that will mean that one great cow will have multiple offspring implanted in 
other cows. And I listened, too, to plans to breed a great field dog to two top 
males &mdash; one of them deceased. (DNA will be used to sort out the parentage 
on the resulting double-sired litter.)</p> 
<p>This is not &ldquo;tried and true&rdquo; old methodology, but cutting-edge, 
high-tech modern agriculture.</p> 
<p>And yes, continuing education is essential for country vets, farmers and 
ranchers, because the world is changing everywhere.</p> 
<p>Now, on top of the interest in using new techniques and technology to 
advance the &ldquo;production&rdquo; of better farm animals in terms of yield, 
conformation, temperament, what-have-you, where are the open minds when it 
comes to making the environment more comfortable for an individual animal?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m seeing a disconnect here. Am I the only one?</p> 
<p>On the original situation in Minnesota, I gotta be honest here: I think the 
vet needs to retire. Because when you close your mind, you&rsquo;re done. 
Whether or not he should be struck off is up to the state board of veterinary 
medicine to decide, but I guaran-damn-tee-ya I&rsquo;d never take a dog to him.

contrary.</p> 
<p>As for the rest, since you&rsquo;re clearly joking, I&rsquo;ll just shake

maybe even something from one of those *gasp* hard-studying vets who should be

</i></p> 
<p>Bernie, no one here has said or implied anything remotely like this. 
I&rsquo;m not responsible for the tapes you&rsquo;re hearing inside your head.
</p> 
<p>In fact, you are the one who has been persistently describing city folks as 
lacking the intelligence, practicality, and moral fiber of rural folks.</p> 
<p>CEU requirements, in the (many!) professions where they exist, apply to <i>
all</i> practitioners, city, country, or suburban. I&rsquo;m sorry if you 
misunderstood, but the suggestion of mandatory CEU requirements was intended for
<i>all</i> vets, not just your favorite rural practitioner.</p> 
<p><i>If you are interested in education why dont we all come down to my farm 
for a minute and take a class on accumulated farm knowledge 101.</i></p> 
<p>If I decide to take up agriculture on even a small, urban scale (as my 
grandfather did, growing wine grapes and kitchen vegetables in the midst of a 
very thickly settled city for many years), I will most certainly seek the 
knowledge of farmers. I trust you&rsquo;ll forgive me, though, if instead of a 
farmer in Wisconsin, I choose to consult a New England farmer, who actually 
knows the local climate and soil conditions, and is well-versed in New 
England&rsquo;s two-crops-a-year agricultural system. (The larger crop each 
year is rocks.)</p> 
<p><i>Before you imply that someone does not know what they should know, best

<p>Bernie, you need to read and reread this, and think about it very, very 
carefully.</p>

<p>As a vet tech in Minnesota, I have been following this thread with great 
interest. I would like to try to bring a couple of new points to the discussion.
</p> 
<p>1) Effective pain management is still a work in progress (in people and in 
animals). The fact that there is no standard protocol defined is evidence of 
that. To this reader, it seems that much of this discussion centers around 
whether our pets&rsquo; pain is viewed by us in a subjective manner or an 
objective manner. To me, neither is right or wrong. BUT, there is a way to 
bring the two together. There has been a lot of work done on pain management by 
the Glasgow University and they have produced a way of evaluating an 
animal&rsquo;s pain based on their behavior. It&rsquo;s called the Glasgow 
Composite Measure Pain Scale and can be viewed or downloaded at
http://www.gla.ac.uk/vet/resea.....e/cmps.htm. The pain scale has been getting 
a lot of positive attention from the veterinary community, and I can tell you 
that clients that I have shared it with have appreciated it too. I&rsquo;d be 
interested in reading reactions from bloggers here as well.</p> 
<p>2) It is my impression that veterinary medicine tends to follow trends in 
human medicine. I think this has happened in pain management as well as other 
things. Over the last several years the trend in human medicine has been to use 
more medications to manage pain for reasons which have already been mentioned 
here. However, that trend may be changing as doctors are now being prosecuted 
for either overdosing, or allowing themselves to be taken advantage of by 
addicts. Many human doctors are now backing away pain management to some 
degree. The New York Times Magazine recently carried a piece on this issue 
which can be seen athttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/07.....ref=slogin. This has 
also recently become a matter of discussion in the veterinary community as 
veterinarians are now seeing their prescriptions being misused by addicts and 
are trying to find ways to prevent that. I recently came across just this 
discussion on VIN (Veterinary Information Network), so it is very relevant.</p> 
<p>Comments?</p> 
<p>Comment by Marilyn &mdash; October 31, 2007 @ 8:30 am </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Gina, I was working with flushing eggs and implantation thirty years ago. 
Its nothing new (to me). It is whole other topic of controversey that I wont 
get into. But all that is entirely irrlevant to the topic.</p> 
<p>If you feel that these guys are doing something wrong you have the correct 
solution. You can get a second opinion or as you said, take your business 
elsewhere. But, unless you can tell me that they withheld medication even when 
the animals were in visible distress I think that advocating the loss of their 
licenses is simple reprehensible and ill informed.</p> 
<p>What I have found interesting is the presumption that the idea of wholesale 
and automatic medication of animals would in fact be the practice advocated in 
a CEU course. While you may find some school somewhere that would have a course 
offering to that end the outline I gave for pain as a diagnostic tool is much 
more likely to be the norm than and consumer&rsquo;s notion of pain management 
vs. pain as management.</p> 
<p>I think you will find that part of the curriculim of the modern vet school 
deals with client management which is not the same thing as patient management 
- owner vs. animal.</p> 
<p>There is a saying among fishermen that the first thing the lure has to 
catch is the fisherman and not the fish. Similarly, practice management is 
mostly about satisfying the customer which is not the animal. Certainly, 
getting a good outcome is part of this but modifying practices to satisfy the 
sensibilities of the payer is without a doubt a motivation. This in fact was 
pointed out by others in this thread early on not to mention the revenue 
generated by selling the drugs in the first place.</p> 
<p>Look back and read the comments by Dorene above and what her vet had told 
her&hellip; &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s a Border Collie and I want her to rest. 
If she feels better, she&rsquo;ll do too much. The pain will tell her to rest 
and that&rsquo;s what she needs.&rdquo; 100% consistent I would say but now 
after reading this she is having doubts&hellip; Who would after some of the 
hysterics displayed here?</p> 
<p>Perhaps I did get off on my high horse abour rural vs. city too much. Its a 
subject that invokes a great deal of passion with me for reasons that are too 
complex to get into here - perhaps another time&hellip; To that extent I 
appologize.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest going back to the earlier posts on this topic. Some of 
the best observations were in fact made by people who turned on me a bit after 
I went off on that tilt. But for sure, there is a huge difference here.</p>

<p>I wanted to take a seperate opportunity to thank Marilyn for her comments. 
A voice of reason is always welcome in a hot arguement.</p> 
<p>I have been out of direct involvement in farming for some time but never 
far from it or animals of other kinds and I can recognize that I am not up on 
all the latest trends but the information she offered is well stated.</p> 
<p>Notice that it lays down some very specific guidlines based on OBSERVATIONS 
of the animals before plunking down the presriptions which is perhaps a 
formalization of some of the very old methods I was attempting to describe in 
my grumpy old way.</p> 
<p>If you can accept what she has posted then I can accept that as a 
compromise.</p> 
<p>Thank you Marilyn!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re welcome, Bernie. Thanks for your comments. I noticed that the 
link I posted above for the New York Times Magazine article does not work. Try 
this one: &ldquo;When is a Doctor a Drug Pusher?&rdquo;

<p>Bernie: CEU courses are not to promote a protocol, but rather to enlighten 
those in the field, to create a knowledgebase so that a good decision may be 
rendered by the practitioner.</p> 
<p>As it turns out, a year ago I got to tag along to an 
Anesthesiologists&rsquo; seminar. It may surprise you to know that doctors who 
specialize in pain management are NOT backing away from prescribing pain meds. 
It&rsquo;s the doctors who do NOT specialize in this field that are backing 
away&hellip;..perhaps because they recognize they don&rsquo;t know enough about 
how to prescribe these drugs, that their practice guidelines are out of date.
</p> 
<p>I have ALWAYS advocated that NO PHYSICIAN other than a certified specialist 
in Psychiatry or Neurology should Rx psychotropic drugs [mental illness]. And 
yet every GP seems to think &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo; - but now 
the smart ones who are not Psychiatrists or Neurologists are rethinking 
prescribing them. The smart internist will refer you to a specialist who can 
best asses the need for such drugs. And the same goes for cancer drugs - for 
the most part no one but Oncologists and certain Rheumatologists should be 
prescribing them. [Few other types of physicians do prescribe such 
drugs&hellip;&hellip;probably because they know that by and large they make you 
feel pretty darned crummy.]</p> 
<p>Then we come to pain killers. A good orthopedic surgeon for example will 
have a strong standard by which to determine which drugs are appropriate and 
for whom. I have a highly regarded team of orthopedic surgeons and they are 
very well trained in pain assessment and staging. I&rsquo;ve had 3 orthopedic 
surgeries in the last 5 years and in all cases the ONLY pain killers I was 
given were the ones given to me as part of the anesthesia induction. Some are 
longer lasting [a few days] - enough to get you through the grueling front end 
of recovery. If I need meds beyond that I could call the physician&hellip;..but 
I have never had the need.</p> 
<p>The reality is that pain killers are essential for a good quality of life 
for many people who deal with chronic pain. However, such drugs should never be 
prescribed except by those physicians who deal with related diseases on an 
hourly basis. Not your GP, not your internist. And maybe prescribing certain 
levels of pain meds need to be legally restricted to specialists.</p> 
<p>The NY Times article was a good one, though it failed in certain areas:<br>

 1. to present appropriate and detailed stats,<br>
 2. by catching the 
reader&rsquo;s attention with the story of one OSTEOPATH [physician who is not 
an MD, but who has similar training and credentialing requirements as an MD; is 
trained to be more of a primary care or preventative medicine doctor and who 
often treats the WHOLE patient],<br>
 3. it set the tone for the rest of the 
story and sadly cast a pall on the good work pain management specialists are 
doing.</p> 
<p>Now we come to veterinarians. I hope that soon specialization in pain 
management comes into being. That the smart GP DVM will recognize that this is 
a specialty and will likely refer you to someone greatly experienced in this 
area.</p> 
<p>As I have said from the very beginning, JUDICIOUS prescription of drugs is 
imperative.</p> 
<p>So now we&rsquo;re back to the original topic: are country animals more 
pain-tolerant than city animals? I think, just like with humans, it&rsquo;s 
highly individual.</p> 
<p>Bernie, I thank you for reviewing the postings and consider their merit. It 
takes an intelligent person to give unbiased consideration to all the sides. 
Still, I don&rsquo;t agree with the posture of the NY Times article. And while 
I believe the Glasgow pain assessment technique is a more than timely advent, I 
can not concur with part two of Marilyn&rsquo;s posting.</p> 
<p>Incidentally, you will be pleased to know that my local library emailed me 
to let me know that &ldquo;Merle&rsquo;s Door,&rdquo; the book you recommended, 
has come in. I look forward to reading it.</p>
