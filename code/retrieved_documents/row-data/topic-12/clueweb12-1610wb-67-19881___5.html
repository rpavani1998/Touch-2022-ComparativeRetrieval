 &gt;&gt;&gt;Even a 3.5m inflatable with a 15hp motor will 
plane.<br>
<br>
 You can go down to 3.5 hp and still plane some of these craft. 
<br> <br>
 It frightens me to see 3.5-ish RIBs ( Davit friendly ) powered by up 
to<br>
<br>
 40 hp outboards. I think it's irresponsible for someone to spec a 
craft like<br>
 this. <br>
<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;Surely better to facilitate 
training youngsters rather than pretend it<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;doesn't happen 
cause it's not allowed.<br>
<br>
 Agreed !! <br>
<br>

 as an owner of a 3.9metre rib with a 
40HP yamaha, what exactly is<br>
 &quot;irresponsible&quot;. The engine is 
within the specs of the boat. ( This rib<br>
 has been used in the irish sea as 
well). And yes its on my davits, though<br>
 let me tell you anyone with davits 
carrying 40Hp enginess are in the<br>
 minority. The rib tops at about 30 mph, 
which is slower then the 2 stroke<br>
 variants. <br>
<br>
 Would specing the 
rib with a 30 or 20hp make me any more &quot;responsible&quot;.<br>
<br>
 I 
have a big issue with age limits , three years ago or whenever it was<br>
 
perfectly legal for 15 year olds to drive this kit, suddenly its not, the<br>
 
issue isnt age its competence. ( God knows theres enough incompetent<br>
 
adults around ).<br>

<br>
 
Under the command of someone of your considerable experience, no problem :-)<br>
<br> However in novice/newbie hands potentially lethal. <br>
<br>
 I have 
noticed a trend ever since the Celtic Tiger started to get his water<br>
 
wings, of over powered RIBs of all sizes.<br>
 e.g. 6-ish metres with twin 
150hp Honda 4 stroke ( quite a heavy engine in<br>
 itself ) <br>
 If the 
operator is aware of the excessive power and uses it appropriately<br>
 OK, but 
<br> in a lot of cases these boats are pushed to the limit most of the time ( or
<br> until the operator <br>
 has his/her near death experience ) <br>
<br>
 
Dave &gt;&gt;&gt;Would specing the rib with a 30 or 20hp make me any more<br>
 
&quot;responsible&quot;.<br>
<br>
 That's a matter of choice obviously but 
depending on the requirements and<br>
 competency of all the potential 
operators, on balance I would say yes<br>
<br>
<br>

 Sure I agree , the issue isnt the spec 
of the RIB, more the incompetence of<br>
 the owner. The same things exists on 
the road as well.<br>
<br>
 I witness on SUnday , three very fast speedboats, 
with very loud and<br>
 obviously powerful petrol engines, play 
&quot;chicken&quot; and endlessy circle and<br>
 cut accross each other bows at 
high speed near the Lakeside recently. Each<br>
 boat had between 2-4 
occupants, A receipe for a disaster and a subsequent<br>
 clampdown in my view.

 Surely the key issue is mandatory 3rd party insurance. In 
many cases I<br>
 suspect it would force many of the owners into having to 
obtain the<br>
 necessary training. <br>

 Hi 
List,<br>
<br>
 I wish to confirm Dave's comments in this instance , last 
Sunday there were<br>
 indeed 4 not 3 speed boats in the inner lake between 
Quigleys and<br>
 Portaneena playing chicken as he described it , c. 2.30-2.45 
pm circling<br>
 each other in a dangerous series of manouvres at speed,not 
only that some of<br>
 the occupants were small children and not all of them 
had life jackets on<br>
 either - it's an accident waiting to happen only it 
will not be an accident<br>
 - such an event implies the element of chance - 
being in the wrong place at<br>
 the wrong time - this will not be the case in 
these situations it is<br>
 reckless behaviour akin to dangerous driving . 
These unthinking people are<br>
 behaving irresponsibly endangering the lives 
of innocent people both those<br>
 in the speed boats but also that of other 
water users (ie fishermen &amp;<br>
 boaters) in their vicinity . We were 
coming in slowly and these idiots were<br>
 cutting across our bows at speed I 
hooted to show our displeasure at their<br>
 behaviour !!! <br>
<br>
 The 
'waterways ireland' patrol boat can not be everywhere but something must<br>
 
be done about this type of behaviour before its too late .<br>

 Hi Mark and Dave, <br>
 I'm 
just seeking clarification here - are you both arguing that there should<br>
 
be no age limit or that the age limit should be 15?<br>

 I 
would argue that the examiner who issues the powerboat cert should be the<br>
 
decider, that person may feel a certain 12 year old has a better grasp of<br>
 
the issues then a 15 year old.<br>
<br>
 The previous situation was that there 
was no lower age at all. the mistake<br>
 in my opinion was to overlook 
certification as a way around teh problem,<br>
 rather then just a simple age 
mechanism.<br>
<br>
 To a previous poster, mandatory insurance is not a way of 
improving<br>
 standards, its merely a way of driving up the cost of insurance.
