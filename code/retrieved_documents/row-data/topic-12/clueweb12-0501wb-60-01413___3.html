<h2>[edit] Districts</h2> 
<p>The name London originally referred only to the once-walled &quot;Square 
Mile&quot; of the original Roman (and later medieval) city (now confusingly 
called the &quot;City of London&quot; or just &quot;The City&quot;). London, 
however, has taken on a much larger meaning to include all of the vast central 
part of the modern metropolis, the city having absorbed numerous surrounding 
towns and villages over the centuries. Reflecting the massive size of the 
metropolis, therefore, the term Greater London embracescentral London together 
with all the outlying suburbs that lie in one continuous urban sprawl within 
the lower Thames valley. Though densely populated by New World standards, 
London retains large swathes of green parkland and open space, even within the 
city center.</p> 
<p><b>Greater London</b> consists of 32 London boroughs and the City of London 
that, together with the relatively new Mayor of London, form the basis for 
London's local government. The names of several boroughs, such as Westminster 
or Camden, are well-known and self-explanatory, others less so, such as Hackney 
or Tower Hamlets. A traveller's London, however, is better defined not by 
strangely shaped and often fairly arbitrary administrative divisions but rather 
by recognized cultural, functional and social districts of varying type and 
size:</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Central 
<ul> 
<li>West End - theatres and shops 
<ul> 
<li>Chinatown </li> 
<li>Covent Garden - designer and alternative shopping, as well as the famous 
Royal Opera House</li> 
<li>Leicester Square - one of the mainstream entertainment hubs. Lots of 
cinemas.</li> 
<li>Oxford Street - high-street shopping </li> 
<li>Soho - nightclubs and restaurants, the heart of gay London </li> 
<li>Trafalgar Square - churches, galleries and monuments </li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Bloomsbury - academic and intellectual area, many of the University of 
London's constituent colleges are based here</li> 
<li>Clerkenwell </li> 
<li>City of London - the historical, and financial, core of the city </li> 
<li>Holborn </li> 
<li>Marylebone </li> 
<li>Mayfair </li> 
<li>South Bank - a vibrant, artsy area fronting the river Thames </li> 
<li>St James's - a city in its own right, and home of the British government 
and royal family</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> West - major centers include Chelsea, Kensington, Paddington, Acton, 
Chiswick, Ealing, Fulham, Hammersmith, Hayes, Shepherd's Bush and Uxbridge.</li>
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> North West - the upscale areas of Finchley, Hampstead, Hampstead garden 
suburb, Maida Vale andSt. John's Wood; but also includes immigrant and working 
class Kilburn and Wembley.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> North - covers Archway, Camden, Crouch End, Islington and Wood Green. 
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> East - a mixture of galleries and bustling nightlife, as well as the some 
of the most deprived areas in the country. Now the focus of redevelopment for 
theLondon 2012 Olympic Games. covers Bethnal Green, Bow, Brick Lane, Clerkenwell
,Docklands, Hackney, Mile End, Poplar, Shoreditch, Stepney, Stratford, 
Walthamstow and Whitechapel</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> South West - covers Battersea, Brixton, Clapham, Kingston, Putney, 
Richmond, Wimbledon, Streatham, Sutton, Tooting, Twickenham and Wandsworth. 
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> South East - covers Greenwich, Bromley, Croydon, Deptford, Dulwich, 
Lewisham and Penge.</li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Understand</h2> 
<h3>[edit] History</h3> 
<p>Settlement has existed on the site of London since well before Roman times, 
with evidence of Bronze Age and Celtic settlement. The Roman city of Londinium, 
however, established just after the Roman conquest of Britannia in the year 43, 
formed the basis for the modern city (some isolated Roman period remains are 
still to be seen within the City). After the end of Roman rule in 410 and a 
short-lived decline, London experienced a gradual revival under the 
Anglo-Saxons, as well as the Norsemen, and emerged as a great medieval trading 
city, and eventually replacedWinchester as the royal capital of England. This 
paramount status for London was confirmed when William the Conqueror, a Norman, 
built the Tower of London after the conquest in 1066 and was crowned King of 
England in Westminster.</p> 
<p>London went from strength to strength and with the rise of England to first 
European then global prominence the city became a great center of culture, 
government and industry. London's long association with the theater, for 
example, can be traced back to the English renaissance (witness the Rose Theatre
[2] and great playwrights like Shakespeare who made London their home). With 
the rise of Britain to supreme maritime power in the 18th and 19th centuries, 
the possessor of the largest global empire, London became an imperial capital 
and drew people and influences from around the world to become, for many years, 
the largest city in the world.</p> 
<p>England's royal family has, over the centuries, added much to the London 
scene for today's traveller: theAlbert Memorial, Buckingham Palace, Kensington 
Palace, Royal Albert Hall,Tower of London and Westminster Abbey being prominent 
examples.</p> 
<p>Despite the inevitable decline of the British Empire, and considerable 
suffering during World War II (when London was heavily bombed by the German 
Luftwaffe in the Blitz), the city is still a top-ranked world city: a global 
center of culture, finance, and learning. Today London is easily the largest 
city in the United Kingdom, eight times larger than the second largest city,
Birmingham, and ten times larger than the third, Glasgow, and dominates the 
economic, political and social life of the nation (much to the annoyance of 
people in the provinces i.e. everywhere except London). It is full of excellent 
bars, galleries, museums, parks and theaters. It is also the most culturally 
and ethnically diverse part of the country, and, for a visitor, a nice 
side-effect of this is the wide range of cuisines available. Samuel Johnson 
famously said, &quot;when one is tired of London, one is tired of life.&quot; 
Whether you are interested in ancient history, modern art, opera or underground 
raves, London has it all.</p> 
<p>London possesses one of the best collections of museums and galleries 
anywhere in the world. World cultures throughout history are well represented, 
for example, at the British Museum. TheMuseum of London (admission free) makes 
an ideal destination for the traveller who wants to understand the history and 
ongoing legacy of this great city.</p> 
<h3>[edit] London 2012 Olympic Games</h3> 
<p>The International Olympic Committee decided in 2005 that London will serve 
as the host city for theGames of the XXX Olympiad [3], the Summer Olympic Games 
of 2012. This will make London the first city to hold the Olympic Games three 
times, having hosted the games previously in 1908 and 1948. The vast majority 
of events will be held in a regenerated area in East London.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Get in</h2> 
<h3>[edit] By plane</h3> 
<p>Image:London airport links summary.svg </p> 
<p>London (all airports code: <b>LON</b>) is served by a total of six 
airports. Traveling between the city and the airports is made relatively easy 
by the large number of public transport links that have been put in place over 
recent years. However, if transiting through London be sure to check the 
arrival and departure airports carefully as transfers across the city may be 
quite time consuming. In addition to London's six official airports (of which 
only two are located within Greater London) there are a number of other 
regional UK airports conveniently accessible from London. Since they offer a 
growing number of budget flights choosing those airports can be cheaper (or 
even faster, depending on where in London your destination is).</p> 
<p>For transfers directly between London's airports, the fastest way (short of 
a taxi) is the direct inter-airport bus service by National Express[4]. Buses 
between Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton run at least hourly, with 
Heathrow-Gatwick services taking 65min (&pound;18) and Heathrow-Stansted 
services 90min (&pound;20.50) (note that services between Stansted and Luton 
run only every two hours). However, it's essential to allow leeway, as London's 
expressways, especially the orbital M25 and the M1 motorway, are often 
congested to the point of gridlock. Buses have toilets on board.</p> 
<h4>[edit] London Heathrow</h4> 
<dl> 
<dd> <i>Main article: Heathrow Airport</i> </dd> </dl> 
<p>Heathrow (ICAO: <b>EGLL</b>, IATA: <b>LHR</b>) [5] is London and Europe's 
largest airport and the world's busiest airport in terms of international 
passenger movement, with services from most available major airports 
world-wide. There are five terminals, with a fifth one opened in March 2008. 
Flights landing at Heathrow are often delayed by up to an hour as a simple 
result of air traffic congestion and waiting for parking slots. A quick summary 
of transport options (also see Heathrow Airport[6]): </p> 
<ul>

<ul> 
<li> <strong>Second fastest: by Heathrow Connect rail</strong>, : 0845 678 
6975, Website:http://www.heathrowconnect.com/. Follows same route as Heathrow 
Express but stops at several intermediate stations to London Paddington so

<ul> 
<li> <strong>Taxi</strong>. A taxi from Heathrow to central London will cost 
&pound;45-60, you can check the price to your exact destination using a taxi 
fare calculator [http://www.worldtaximeter.com/london]. You may wish to 
consider taking a taxi if you have a lot of baggage or small children. 
Alternatively catch public transport into the city centre and then catch a 
taxi. There are two types of taxis: Black cabs (usually slightly more expensive 
- can be hailed on a street) or licensed mini cabs (cheaper - must be booked 
over the phone or on the web). There are over 1000 minicab companies in London, 
the largest one is Addison Lee (020 7387 8888)[http://www.addisonlee.com/], 
other companies offering airport transfers can be found in the Yellow Pages

<h4>[edit] London Gatwick</h4> 
<p>(IATA: <b>LGW</b>, ICAO: <b>EGKK</b>) [7] London's second airport, also 
serving a large spectrum of places world-wide. To get to the center of the 
city, the following options exist:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>By rail: Gatwick Express</strong>, : 0845 850 1530, Website: 
http://www.gatwickexpress.com/. Every 15 minutes, journey time 30-35 minutes.

long-distance cycle path into Central London, but as it involves going through 
the North Downs and South London and over, it will likely be quite a ride. For 
adventerous people.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>By Licenced Minicab: West End Car Services</strong>, : 020 7734 
8970,: info@westendcarservices.com, Website: 
http://www.westendcarservices.com/home.php?action=getaquote. A Licenced Cab 
from the airport to Central London (&amp;pound;60) would take about an 
hour(depending on traffic) WestEndCarServices.com.</li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit] London Stansted</h4> 
<p> Sleeping at Stansted Airport </p>
<p><br>
 A large number of budget flights depart from Stansted as early as 6AM 
(when the lowest fares are available). However, this presents travellers with a 
problem, as the airport's location is a long way outside London, and transport 
to the airport does not operate before 5:30AM. Due to the high price of 
accommodation in the city and near the airport, and the fact that many budget 
airlines don't pay for accommodation in the event of cancellation, an 
increasing number of travellers choose to spend the night in the airport prior 
to their flight. A crowd of around 100 travellers (up to 400 in summer) camp in 
the main departure/arrivals hall every night, effectively turning it into a 
giant dormitory. Tips for sleeping at Stansted Airport:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Arrive early, preferably around 10PM, and stake your territory 
immediately. Benches without armrests are in limited supply and fill up quickly.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> If you arrive later take a floor mat and sleeping bag. Sleeping on the 
floor is tolerated by the staff, but avoid pitching your bed in front of shops 
and counters.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> A sleeping bag is generally recommended as the automatic doors constantly 
open and close as passengers arrive, and it can get chilly in winter.</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li> Safety is not a problem. The airport is miles away from any settlement 
and security guards overlook the open-plan building 24/7.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Ear plugs and eye covers are a must, as the cleaning staff are noisy and 
shop assistants start arriving at 4AM to open shutters.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> At least one cafe is open all night, offering snacks and hot drinks. </li>
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Toilets remain open and are normally in good condition. There are no 
drinking fountains.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p>(ICAO: <b>EGSS</b>, IATA: <b>STN</b>)[8] Currently London's third airport, 
the base for a large number of budget carriers (for example EasyJet[9] and 
RyanAir[10]) and flights within Europe and a few inter-continental flights. 
There are several commercial wi-fi hotspots covering most of the airport, but 
they charge extortionate rates. A free wi-fi hotspot is located in the arrivals 
gate area, next to the phone booths offering fixed internet. Transport options 
into central London:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>By rail: Stansted Express to London Liverpool Street</strong>, : 
0845 600 7245, Website:http://www.stanstedexpress.com/. Every 15 minutes,

<li> <strong>By rail then London Underground: Stansted Express to Tottenham 
Hale then London Underground (Victoria line)</strong>, : 0845 600 7245, Website:

<h4>[edit] London Luton</h4> 
<p>(ICAO: <b>EGGW</b>, IATA: <b>LTN</b>)[11] Has traditionally been a holiday 
charter airport, but is now also served by some budget scheduled carriers. As 
per Stansted, and for the same reasons, many choose to spend the night here 
before flying, although &quot;First Capital Connect&quot; trains run 24 hours.

<ul> 
<li> <strong>By rail</strong>, Website: http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/.

<h4>[edit] Other airports near London</h4> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>London Southend Airport</strong>, : 01702 608100, Website: 
http://www.southendairport.com/. (IATA: '''SEN''', ICAO: '''EGMC''') Currently 
undergoing redevelopment and is set to become London's sixth international 
airport once the new rail link is completed. At present it serves destinations 
in the British isles only.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Southampton Airport</strong>, : 0870 040 0009, Website: 
http://www.baa.co.uk/main/airports/southampton. Every 30 minutes, journey time 
1 hour. (IATA: '''SOU''', ICAO: '''EGHI''') is not officially a London airport, 
though accessible enough to conveniently serve the capital, especially South 
West London. A couple of budget carriers serving an increasing number of 
European destinations are based here. Direct trains connect Southampton airport 
to London Waterloo station. &pound;30-35 round trip</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Birmingham International Airport</strong>, : 0870 733 5511, 
Website:http://www.bhx.co.uk. Every 30 minutes, journey time 75 minutes. (IATA: 
'''BHX''', ICAO: '''EGBB''') is another non-London airport worth considering as 
a less congested and hectic alternative to Heathrow, being just over an hour 
away from London. As a major airport serving the UK's second largest city, 
there is a good choice of long distance and European destinations. Direct 
trains connect Birmingham International to London Euston and Watford. From 
&pound;10 (advance web purchase) one way. &pound;35-100 round trip.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By train</h3> 
<p>London has one international rail route (operated by Eurostar [13] 0870 518 
6186 ) fromParis (2h15) and Brussels (1h50) diving under the sea for 22 high 
speed miles (35km) via the Channel Tunnel to come out in England. It terminates 
at St Pancras International. There are no less than 12 main line<i>National Rail
</i> [14] terminals (although in conversation you may hear the brand <i>
National Rail</i> infrequently if ever it differentiates main line and London 
Underground services; journey planner online or phone 08457 48 49 50). With the 
exception of Fenchurch Street (nearest tube: Tower Hill) these are on the 
London Underground. Most are on the circle line. Clockwise starting at 
Paddington, major<i>National Rail</i> stations are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Paddington</b>, serves South West England and Wales including 
Slough, Maidenhead, Reading, Oxford, Bath, Bristol, Taunton, Exeter, Plymouth 
andCardiff and Swansea. Also the downtown terminus of the Heathrow Airport 
Express (see above) and serves some suburban stations such as Acton Main Line 
and Ealing Broadway.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Marylebone</b>, serves some north western suburban stations 
such as Amersham, Harrow on the Hill and Wembley Stadium. Also servesAylesbury, 
High Wycombe, Banbury, Stratford-upon-Avon and the city of Birmingham. It is 
much cheaper but slightly slower to take a train from Marylebone to Birmingham 
instead of a train from London Euston.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Euston</b>, serves the Midlands, north-west England and west 
Scotland: Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Chester, Oxenholme Lake District, 
Carlisle, Glasgow, and Holyhead for connecting ferries to/from both the 
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sleeper trains to Scotland leave from 
Euston.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>St Pancras International</b>, serves Paris, Brussels, Luton Airport 
and theEast Midlands: Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London King's Cross</b>, serves East Anglia, north-east England and 
eastScotland: Cambridge, Doncaster, Leeds, York, Kingston upon Hull, Newcastle 
upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Platform 9 3/4 from the Harry Potter books 
is marked with a special sign, although platform 9 itself is actually in the 
fairly unpleasant metallic extension used by Cambridge trains.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Moorgate</b>, serves some northern suburbs. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Liverpool Street</b>, serves East Anglia: Ipswich and Norwich. 
Also the downtown terminus of the Stansted Airport Express.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Fenchurch Street</b>, serves commuter towns north of the Thames 
estuary toSouthend. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Bridge</b>, <b>London Cannon Street</b>, <b>London Waterloo East
</b> and <b>London Charing Cross</b>, serve south and south east London and 
England:Brighton, Dover, Eastbourne, Hastings and Ramsgate. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Blackfriars</b>, serves Luton Airport and Brighton. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Waterloo</b>, serves south west London and England: Portsmouth, 
Winchester, Southampton, Bournemouth, Weymouth, Salisbury and Exeter. </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Victoria</b>, serves south east London and England: Brighton, 
Dover, Eastbourne, Hastings and Ramsgate. Also the downtown terminus of the 
Gatwick Airport Express.</li> </ul> 
<p>In South London many areas only have <i>National Rail</i> services (no 
London Underground services but there are buses). London Bridge, Victoria, 
Cannon Street and Charing Cross serve the South East. London Waterloo serves 
the South West.<b>First Capital Connect</b> (frequently referred to as <b>
Thameslink</b>) is a cross London route between Bedford and Brighton via Luton 
Airport (Parkway), St Pancras International, Farringdon, City Thameslink, 
Blackfriars, London Bridge and Gatwick Airport.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By bus</h3> 
<p>Most international and domestic long distance bus (UK English: coach) 
services arrive at and depart from a complex of coach stations off Buckingham 
Palace Road inSt James's close to London Victoria rail station. All services 
operated by National Express or Eurolines (see below) serve<b>Victoria Coach 
Station</b>, which actually has separate arrival and departure buildings. 
Services by other operators may use this station, or the<b>Green Line Coach 
Station</b> across Buckingham Palace Road. The following are amongst the main 
coach operators:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>National Express</strong>, : 0870 580 8080, Website: 
http://www.nationalexpress.com/. is by far the largest domestic coach operator 
and operates services to / from London from throughout [[England]], [[Wales]] 
and [[Scotland]]. Advance ticketing is usually required and recommended 
practice in any case</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Eurolines</strong>, : 0870 514 3219, Website: 
http://www.eurolines.com/. is an associate company of National Express, and 
runs coach services to / from London with various cities in [[Northern 
Ireland]], the [[Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] and continental Europe. Advance 
ticketing is required.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Megabus</strong>, : 0900 160 0900, Website: 
http://www.megabus.com/uk/index.php. operates budget coach services from/to 
London (Victoria Coach Station) to/from several major regional cities, it is 
even possible to get to Inverness in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] Highlands. Fares 
are demand responsive but can be very cheap (&pound;1.50 if you book far enough 
in advance).</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By car</h3> 
<p>There is also the option of a central London Park and Ride site located at 
Park Lane and Marble Arch, seeNational Park and Ride Directory </p> 
<h2>[edit] Get around</h2> 
<p>The city has one of the most comprehensive public transport systems in the 
world. Despite residents constant, and sometimes justified, grumbling about 
unreliability public transport is often the best option for getting anywhere 
for visitors and residents alike and is far more reliable than locals would 
have you believe. Indeed, nearly a third of households do not feel the need to 
own a car. The city has recently been awarded the city with the best public 
transport in the world.</p> 
<p><b>Transport for London (TfL)</b> [15] is a government organisation 
responsible for all public transport. Visit their website. It contains maps 
plus an excellent<b>journey planner</b> [16]. They also offer a 24-hour travel 
information line, charged at local rate: tel<i>020 7222 1234 (or text 60835) 
for suggestions on getting from A to B, and for up to the minute information on 
how services are running. Fortunately for visitors (and indeed residents) there 
is a single ticketing system, Oyster, which enables travellers to switch 
between modes of transport on one ticket - but even this has a few limitations 
(see the guide below) and it is not yet universally accepted by many of the 
private rail operators.</i> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>By tube / underground</b> </li> </ul> 
<p>12 colour-coded lines cover the central area and suburbs mostly north of 
the River Thames, run by TfL</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>By Docklands Light Railway (DLR)</b> </li> </ul> 
<p>Only runs in the east of the city, privately run but part of TfL's network 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>By tram (Tramlink)</b> </li> </ul> 
<p>A tram service that only operates in southern suburbs around Wimbledon and 
Croydon.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>By London Overground</b> </li> </ul> 
<p>The London Overground is now featured on Tube Maps although runs a lot less 
frequently than the tube (some branches run just 2 or 3 trains per hour). A 
suburban rail service that crosses north London and round to Richmond, run by 
TfL. The East London Line is now closed until 2010 when it will become part of 
the new London Overground.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>By National Rail including Airport Express trains</b> </li> </ul> 
<p>Rail services to Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton airports (tickets 
are generally sold at a premium) and suburban services that run out of the city

centre; operated by numerous private train companies).</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>By boat</b> </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Oyster Card</h3>  Oyster Card in use <br>

<p> Oyster pay-as-you-go on National Rail </p>
<p><br>
 Be careful - while Oyster pay-as-you-go is valid on London 
Underground, London buses and London Overground, pay-as-you-go is not valid on 
many<i>National Rail</i> trains - you have to use a <i>Travelcard</i>, buy 
separate paper tickets. Refer to the<i>Oyster Pay-as-you-go on National Rail</i>
 map[17] to help you, or ask at the station. Don't get caught out, staff are 
generally unsympathetic! However, if you are only using the tube, bus and tram, 
Oyster pay-as-you-go makes a lot of sense.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><b>Oyster</b> [18] is a contact-less electronic smartcard run by Transport 
for London. You can &quot;charge up&quot; an Oyster card with electronic funds. 
This cash is then deducted according to where you travel. The cost of a single 
trip using the Oyster card is less than buying a single ticket outright, but 
this varies depending on where you're traveling and whether by bus or tube. 
Touch the card against a yellow disc, prominently displayed on the entry and 
exit gates for the Tube (do not try to insert it into the slot!) and on buses 
and trams. Theoretically you don't need to remove it from your wallet or bag to 
do this, the card reader can work through a bag, but in reality you may need to 
take the card out to get it to work. Be careful standing near the readers on 
some bendy buses, they are often quite sensitive and may read your card from 
several centimetres away, even if you did not intend this. If you keep it in 
your wallet try not to sit on it as sometimes they will crack and cease to 
work. For the tube, be sure to touch the card on the yellow disc both when you 
enter the tube AND when you exit at your final destination; otherwise you will 
be charged &pound;4. You can also add various electronic tickets onto the card, 
and the card is simply validated each time you use it. You can get an Oyster 
Card from any Tube station for a deposit of &pound;3. This is fully refundable 
if you hand it in at the end of the trip. If you have any pay-as-you-go credit 
left this will also be refunded. However, there is no expiry date on the Oyster 
Card or any pay-as-you-go credit on the card. Getting a refund for unused 
credit is, frankly, a hassle.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Which ticket?</h4> 
<h5>[edit] Pay-as-you-go (PrePay)</h5> 
<p>You can charge up your Oyster card with electronic cash at any tube station 
ticket machine or ticket desk (you can even use a credit card to do this if 
your credit card has a PIN number) with Oyster pay-as-you-go, also known as 
PrePay. This money is then deducted from your card each time you get on a 
service. Pay-as-you-go is much cheaper than paying in cash for each journey. 
For instance, a cash tube one way in Zone 1 is &pound;4, while with an Oyster 
Card it costs &pound;1.50. On the tube, be sure to touch in and touch out again 
at the end of your journey. The fare is calculated based on your start and end 
points. If you forget to touch your Oyster card at the start and finish you 
will be charged extra! Furthermore, a cash bus fare is &pound;2 while with 
Oyster it is &pound;0.90. It also saves time getting onto buses. In the central 
area, tickets have to be bought at a machine by the bus stop if you don't have 
an Oyster and outside the zone from the driver.</p> 
<p>The amount of PrePay deducted from your Oyster card in one day is capped at 
the cost of the appropriate<b>paper day ticket (day Travelcard)</b> for the 
zones you have travelled through, less 50 pence. For zone 1-2 (central London 
including everywhere inside the Circle line and some places outside) this is 
&pound;4.80 (&pound;6.30 M-F before 9:30AM).</p> 
<h5>[edit] Travelcard season tickets</h5> 
<p>Weekly, monthly and longer-period <i>Travelcard season tickets</i> can be 
purchased at all tube station ticket offices. These can be used on any tube, 
DLR, bus, London Overground,<i>National Rail</i> or tram service within the 
zones for which they were purchased. Note that they can not be used on any 
Airport Express trains (Heathrow Express, Gatwick Express and Stansted 
Express). A Zone 1-6<i>Travelcard</i> can be used on the London Underground 
(Piccadilly line) to/from Heathrow Airport.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Summary</h4> 
<p>The following table summarises the validity of the different tickets you 
can use on Oyster. For most tourists, tubes and buses are the only transport 
you will use, but be aware of the limitations if you travel on<i>National Rail
</i> or on Airport Express trains. </p> Bus London Underground London Overground
National Rail DLR Tram Airport Express trains <br>
<b>Pay-as-you-go</b> yes yes 
yes <i>sometimes</i> yes yes no <br>
<b>Travelcard</b> yes yes yes yes yes yes 
no <br>
<b>Bus pass</b> yes no no no no yes no <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<li> Airport Express trains are Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Express, and 
Thameslink to Luton</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Piccadilly line to Heathrow is a London Underground train, so PrePay and 
Travelcards are valid.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Travelcards are only valid within the zones you buy. </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By foot</h3> 
<p>For travelling shorter distances in London there is no better way. Walking 
forces you to slow down and look around, and in a city like London there's 
always something interesting to look at if you take the time. Walking can also 
be the quickest way to get somewhere: check your map, central London is 
surprisingly compact. London walking directions can be planned online with the 
walkit.com walking route planner[19]. </p> 
<h3>[edit] By tube / underground</h3> 
<p> Tube etiquette </p>
<p><br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Beware of pickpockets. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> When using the escalators always stand on the right to allow people in a 
hurry to pass. If you are standing on the left people will occasionally shove 
you out the way.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Whilst waiting for a train, allow others coming down the escalators 
behind you space by moving down the platform.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> If a train is badly overcrowded, to see when the next is due look at the 
information display. If it's only a couple of minutes you would be as well to 
wait, it could be less crowded.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Allow passengers to get off the train before boarding yourself. While 
passengers are trying to get off do not stand in front of the doors. Stand 
either to the right or to the left of the train doors, and allow passengers to 
disembark before attempting to get on. Adhering to this train equette will make 
life easier.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Have your Oyster card ready for the top of the escalators so not to 
obstruct barriers.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Move clear of the foot of escalators, ticket halls and station entrances. 
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Some platforms in Zone 1 have the words &quot;Mind the Gap&quot; written 
on the platform edge. When the train stops, the carriage doors will line up 
with this warning.</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p>The <b>London Underground</b> [20] - also known popularly as <b>The Tube</b>
 - has trains that criss-cross London in the largest underground rail network 
anywhere in the world (it was also the first, the first section of the 
Metropolitan Line dates back to 1863). The Tube is an easy method of transport 
even for new visitors to London.</p> 
<p>Tube maps [21] are freely available from any station, most tourist offices 
and are prominently displayed throughout stations and, for some obscure reason, 
in the back of most diaries. The Tube is made up of 12 lines each bearing a 
traditional name and a standard color on the Tube map. To plan your trip on The 
Tube work out first which station is closest to your starting point and which 
closest to your destination. You are able to change freely between lines at 
interchange stations (providing you stay within the zones shown on your 
ticket). Use the Tube Map to determine which line(s) you will take. Since the 
Tube Map is well designed it is very easy to work out how to get between any 
two stations, and since each station is clearly signed and announced it is easy 
to work out when to get off your train. Visitors should be aware, however, that 
the Tube map is actually a diagram and not a scaled map, making it misleading 
for determining the relative distance between stations as it makes central 
stations appear further apart and somewhat out of place. The Tube map also 
gives no information on London's extensive overground bus network and its 
orbital rail network.</p> 
<p>Trains run from around 5:30AM to about 1AM. This mode of transport is 
usually the fastest way to get from one part of London to the another, the only 
problem being the relative expense, and the fact that it can get extremely 
crowded during rush hours (7:30AM-9:30AM and 4:30PM-7PM). On warm days take a 
bottle of water with you.</p> 
<p>An integrated map of London's Tube, Train and Bus Map can be purchased 
online at mapvendor.com[22] or alternatively you can view the map online [23]. 
</p> 
<h3>[edit] By bus</h3> <br>
Red bus in London <br>
Bus stop 
<p>London's iconic red buses are recognized the world over, even if the 
traditional open-platform Routemaster buses have been largely phased out. 
Old-fashioned<b>Routemaster</b> buses, with an open rear platform and on-board 
conductor to collect fares, run on<b>Heritage Route 9</b> and <b>15</b> every 
15 minutes, daily between about 9:30AM and 6:30PM.</p> 
<p>Over 5 million bus trips are made each weekday; with over 700 different bus 
routes you are never far from a bus in London.</p> 
<p>Each bus stop has a sign listing the routes that will stop there. Bus 
routes are identified by numbers and sometimes letters, for example the 73 runs 
between Seven Sisters and Victoria. Yellow route signs indicate you must 
purchase your ticket before you board. This means you must either have a 
Pay-as-you-go Oyster card, travelcard season ticket, bus saver ticket, bus 
pass, or have bought a one way ticket from a machine at the bus stop. Note that 
these machines don't provide change (all the more reason to use one of the 
other options). Buses display their route number in large digits at the front, 
side, and rear of the bus.</p> 
<p>The difficulty with buses over the tube is knowing when to get off; while 
tube stations are clearly marked it is sometimes more difficult to work out 
where to get off a bus. All bus stops have their location and the direction of 
travel marked on them, although by the time you've seen this it can be too late 
to get off! Bus drivers are usually too busy to be able to tell you when you've 
reached your destination. Your best bet is to ask fellow passengers and/or to 
trace your route on a map[24]. </p> 
<p>Standard bus services run from around 6am in the morning to 12:30AM. Buses 
are generally quicker than taking the Tube for short trips (less than a couple 
of stops on the Tube), and out of central London you're likely to be closer to 
a bus stop than a tube station. Around midnight the bus network changes to the
<b>night bus</b> network. The night bus service is a reliable and often 
interesting way to get home at night. Night buses are identified by an 'N' at 
the start of the route number, for example the N73 runs between Walthamstow 
Central and Victoria. Bus routes, numbers and timetable all change with most of 
the buses radiating out from around theTrafalgar Square area to most outlying 
parts of Greater London. Be careful though, as not all night buses are prefixed 
with an &quot;N&quot;, some are simply a 24 hour service, such as the 214 from 
Liverpool St-Highgate Hill. Fares are the same for night buses as for regular 
services.</p> 
<p>Children under 14 travels free without identification, under 16 travels 
free on production of a Child Oyster photocard. However, unlike The Tube single 
tickets do not allow you to transfer to different buses.</p> 
<p>Many of the most popular buses tend to be of the double-length articulated 
variety, known as bendy buses. Routes served by this type of bus always carry a 
yellow route sign as detailed above. Care should be taken as it is possible for 
those unfamiliar with this type of bus to get on board and then have no way of 
paying. This could be related to the relative ease of hopping on and off these 
without paying (at stops, doors open along the length of the bus and there is 
no on-board conductor). This is, however, illegal and can be very risky - large 
teams of inspectors frequently descend on these buses accompanied by police, 
and it's entirely possible to be arrested and prosecuted.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By DLR</h3> 
<p><b>Docklands Light Railway (DLR)</b> is a dedicated light rail network 
operating inEast London, connecting with the tube network at Bank and Tower 
Gateway. As the trains often operate without a driver, it can be quite exciting 
- especially for children - to sit in front and look at through the window, 
whilst feeling as though one is driving the train oneself. Apart from the 
trains looking slightly different and running slightly less frequently than the 
Tube, visitors may as well treat the two systems as the same.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By tram (Tramlink)</h3> 
<p>Tramlink, opened in 2000, is the first modern tram system to operate in 
London. South London is poorly served by the Tube and lacks east-west National 
Rail services so the network connects Wimbledon in South West London to 
Beckenham in South East London and New Addington, a large housing estate in 
South Croydon. The network is centred onCroydon, where it runs on street-level 
tracks around the Croydon Loop.</p> 
<p>Route 3 (Wimbledon to New Addington - green on the Tramlink map) is the 
most frequent service, running every 7 1/2 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime 
and every 15 minutes at all other times. Beckenham is served by Routes 1 and 2 
(yellow and red on the Tramlink map), which terminate at Elmers End and 
Beckenham Junction respectively. Both services travel around the Loop via West 
Croydon and run every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30 
minutes at all other times. Between Arena and Sandilands, these two services 
serve the same stops.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By cycle</h3> 
<p>Due to the expense of other forms of transport and the compactness of 
central London, cycling is a tempting option. Excellent free cycle maps[25] can 
be obtained from your local tube stations, bike shop, or ordered online.</p> 
<p>Despite recent improvements, London remains a relatively hostile 
environment for cyclists. London motorists seem reluctant to acknowledge the 
existence of cyclists, especially at busy junctions. The kind of contiguous 
cycle lane network found in many other European cities does not exist. The 
safest option is to stick to minor residential roads where traffic can be 
surprisingly calm outside rush hours. The towpaths in North London along the 
Grand Union Canal and Regent's Canal are the closest thing to a truly 
traffic-free cycle path in the capital. The Grand Union canal connects 
Paddington to Camden and the Regent's Canal connects Camden to Islington, Mile 
End and Limehouse in East London. It takes about 30-40min to cycle from 
Paddington station to Islington along the towpaths. In summer they are crowded 
with pedestrians and not suitable for cycling, but in winter or late in the 
evening they offer a very fast and safe way to travel from east to west in 
North London. Care should be taken as to where you choose to park your bike. 
Many areas, some surprisingly busy, attract cycle thieves, while chaining a 
bicycle to a railing which appears to be private property can occasionally lead 
to said bike being removed. Cycling on the sidewalk (pavement) is illegal.</p> 
<p>Non-folding bikes can only be taken on limited sections of The Tube 
network, mostly only on the above-ground sections outside peak hours. For this 
reason, folding bicycles are becoming increasingly popular. There is a map 
showing this on the Transport for London website. Most<i>National Rail</i> 
operators allow bicycles outside peak hours also.</p> 
<p>Critical Mass London [26] meets for regular rides through central London at 
6PM on the last Friday of each month. Rides start from the southern end of 
Waterloo Bridge. The London Cycle Campaign[27] is an advocacy group for London 
cyclists and organizes regular group rides and events. Many improvements have 
been made for cyclists in the city over the last few years, even if they remain 
no more than gestures in most places. Noticeably, there are many new signposted 
cycle routes and some new cycle lanes, not to mention more cyclists since the 
2005 public transport attacks.</p> 
<p>In the United Kingdom helmets are not compulsory for cyclists, and opinions 
differ on their value. In London, many cyclists, especially those seen in rush 
hour, also wear filter masks, but their efficacy is even more disputed.</p> 
<p>You must have working front and rear lights during hours of darkness. 
Flashing LED lights are legal. Reflective clothing is always a good idea even 
during the day.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By taxi</h3> <br>
London Cab 
<p>London has two types of taxis: the famous <b>black cab</b>, and so-called 
<b>minicabs</b>. Black cabs are the only ones licensed to 'tout for business' 
(ie pick people up off the street), while minicabs are more accurately 
described as 'private hire vehicles' and need to be pre-booked.</p> 
<p>The famous <b>black cab</b> of London (not always black in these days of 
heavy advertising!) can be hailed from the curb or found at one of the many 
designated taxi ranks. It is possible to book black cabs by phone, for a fee, 
but if you are in central London it will usually be quicker to hail one from 
the street. Their yellow TAXI light will be on if they are available. Drivers 
must take an extensive exam in London's streets to be licensed for a black cab, 
meaning they can supposedly navigate you to almost any London street without 
reference to a map. They are a cheap transport option if there are five 
passengers as they do not charge extras, and many view them as an essential 
experience for any visitor to London. Black cabs charge by distance and by the 
minute, are non-smoking, and have a minimum charge of &pound;2.20. Tipping is 
not mandatory in either taxis or minicabs, despite some drivers' 
expectations..... Use your discretion , if you like the service you may tip 
otherwise don't.</p> 
<p>Taxis are required by law to take you wherever you choose (within Greater 
London) if their TAXI light is on when you hail them. However many, especially 
older drivers, dislike leaving the centre of town, or going south of the River 
Thames. A good way to combat being left at the side of the curb is to open the 
back door, or even get into the cab, before stating your destination.</p> 
<p><b>Minicabs</b> are licenced hire vehicles that you need to book by phone 
or at a minicab office. They generally charge a fixed fare for a journey, best 
agreed before you get in the car. Minicabs are usually cheaper than black cabs, 
although this is not necessarily the case for short journeys. Licensed minicabs 
display a Transport For London (TFL) License Plate - usually in the front 
window. One of the features of the license plate is a blue version of the 
famous London Underground &quot;roundel&quot;. Note that some areas in London 
are poorly serviced by black cabs, particularly late at night. This has led to 
a large number of illegal minicabs operating - just opportunistic people, with 
a car, looking to make some fast money. Some of these operators can be fairly 
aggressive in their attempts to find customers, and it's now barely possible to 
walk late at night through any part of London with a modicum of nightlife 
without being approached. You should avoid mini-cabs touting for business off 
the street and either take a black cab, book a licensed minicab by telephone, 
or take a<b>night bus</b>. These illegal drivers are unlicensed and sadly they 
are often unsafe: a number of women are assaulted every week by illegal minicab 
operators.</p>

<h3>[edit] By road</h3> 
<p>Londoners who drive will normally take public transport in the centre; 
follow their example. Car drivers should be aware that driving into central 
London on weekdays during daylight hours incurs a hefty charge, with very few 
exemptions (note that rental cars also attract the charge). Cameras and mobile 
units record and identify the number plates and registration details of all 
vehicles entering the charging zone with high accuracy. The<b>Central London 
Congestion Charge</b> [28] M-F 7AM-6PM (excluding public holidays) attracts a 
fee of &pound;8 if paid the<b>same day</b>, or &pound;10 if paid on the next 
charging day. Numerous payment options exist: by phone, online and by voucher. 
Failure to pay the charge by midnight the next charging day (take note!) incurs 
a hefty automatic fine of &pound;80 (&pound;40 if paid within 2 weeks).</p> 
<p>Despite the Congestion Charge, London - like most major cities - continues 
to experience traffic snarls. These are, of course, worse on weekdays during 
peak commuting hours, i.e. between 7:30AM-9:30AM and 4PM-7PM At these times 
public transport (and especially the Tube) usually offers the best alternative 
for speed and reduced hassle. Driving in Central London is a slow, frustrating, 
expensive and often unnecessary activity. Traffic is slow and heavy, there are 
many sorts of automatic enforcement cameras, and it is difficult and expensive 
to park. A good tip is, that outside advertised restriction hours, parking on a
<i>single</i> yellow line is permissible. Parking on a red line or a <i>double
</i> yellow line is never permissible and heavily enforced. Find and read the 
parking restrictions carefully! Parking during weekdays and on Saturday can 
also mean considerable expense in parking fees - fees and restrictions are 
ignored at your extreme financial peril - issuing fines, clamping and towing 
vehicles (without warning!) has become a veritable new industry for borough 
councils staffed by armies of traffic wardens.</p> 
<p>For the disabled driving can be much more convenient than using public 
transport. If disabled and a resident of a member state of the EU then two cars 
can be permanently registered, for free, for the congestion charge.</p> 
<p>Motorbike is arguably the fastest way around London, but also the most 
dangerous. The congestion zone does not apply, and thus for anyone commuting 
it's usually the cheapest option (possibly excluding bus rides). Parking for 
motorbikes and scooters is free at many of the reserved areas.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By boat</h3> 
<p>A slower, pleasant way to travel through the city; privately owned, but 
discounts are offered on some lines to Travelcard holders. The London Waterbus 
Company runs scheduled services (more in summer, less in winter) from Little 
Venice to Camden Lock with a stop at the London Zoo. The 45 minute trip along 
Regent's Canal is a delightful way to travel.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By skate</h3> 
<p>Inline skating on roads and sidewalks (pavements) is completely legal, 
except in the City of London (a district). Roads are not the greatest but 
easily skatable. In the center drivers are more used to skaters than in the 
outskirts.</p>

<p>London hosts an outstanding collection of world-class museums. Even better, 
it is the only one of the traditional &quot;alpha world cities&quot; (London,
New York City and Paris) in which the majority of the museums have no entrance 
charges, thus allowing visitors to make multiple visits with ease. Although 
London can be expensive many of the best museums and galleries are free 
includingTate Modern, Tate Britain, British Museum, National Gallery, National 
Portrait Gallery and most museums in Greenwich. Donations are welcome. Note 
that admission to many temporary exhibitions is not free. The 'green lungs' of 
London are the many parks, great and small, scattered throughout the city 
includingSt James Park and Hyde Park. Most of the larger parks have their

possibly want to buy is available in London, if you know where to look, and if 
you can afford it (London is not particularly noted for bargain shopping, owing 
to high prices and high exchange rates - though it can be done with some 
determination). In Central London, the main shopping district is theWest End

<h2>[edit] Eat</h2> This guide uses the following price ranges for a typical 
meal<i>for one</i>, including soft drink: <br>
<b>Budget</b>  Below &pound;10 
<br> <b>Mid-range</b>  &pound;10-40 <br>
<b>Splurge</b>  &pound;40+ <br>
<br>

<p><b>Smoking Ban</b> </p>
<p>Remember - smoking is banned in all UK pubs and restaurants. </p> <br>
<br>

<p>It is a huge task for a visitor to find the 'right place' to eat in London 
- with the 'right atmosphere', at the 'right price' - largely because, as in 
any big city, there are literally thousands of venues from which to choose. 
Unfortunately, London is one of the world's most expensive cities to eat in. 
However, there are plenty of good-value, even cheap places to eat - you just 
have to know where to look. Following is a (very!) rough guide to what you 
might get, should you fancy eating out:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;3</b> - a good English pub or cafeteria breakfast with a rack 
of bacon, beans in tomato sauce, egg, sausage, orange juice and coffee or tea. 
Most pubs stop this offer at 11am.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;5</b> - a couple of sandwiches and a soft drink, some takeaway 
fish and chips, or a fast food meal. There are also a number of mostly Chinese 
restaurants which serve an all you can eat buffet for around this price. These 
are dotted about the West End and it is well worth asking a member of public or 
a shopkeeper where the nearest one is. These restaurants make much of their 
revenue on drinks although these are usually still moderately priced. The food 
whilst not being of the finest standard is usually very tasty and the range of 
dishes available is excellent.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;10</b> - &pound;6-7: a good pub meal and drink or a good 
Chinese/Indian/Italian/Thai/Vietnamese buffet. Be aware that many pubs have a 
buy-one-get-one-free offer, and you can either order two main dishes for 
yourself or bring a friend. &pound;10: some more expensive French, 
mediterranean and international restaurants do cheaper two or three course 
lunch menus.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;20</b> - a lot more choice. You can have a good meal, half a 
bottle of wine and change for the tube home. There are plenty of modest 
restaurants that cater for this bracket.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;50+</b> - with more money to spend you can pick some of the 
city's finer restaurants. It may be a famous chef (like Jamie Oliver or Gordon 
Ramsay) or simply a place that prides itself on using the finest ingredients. 
But if you are trying to impress a special someone it'll be worth it. There is 
no maximum limit on what you can spend as some restaurants seem intent on 
pushing this higher and higher.</li> </ul> 
<p>Prices inevitably become inflated at venues closest to major tourist 
attractions - beware the so-called tourist traps. The worst tourist trap food 
is, in the opinion of many Londoners, that served at the various steak houses. 
Real Londoners wouldn't dream of eating here - you shouldn't either! Notorious 
areas for inflated menu prices trading on travellers' gullibility and lack of 
knowledge are the streets around the British Museum, Leicester Square and 
Piccadilly Circus.</p> 
<p>In the suburbs, the cost of eating out is reduced drastically. Particularly 
in large ethnic communities, there is a competitive market which stands to 
benefit the consumer. In East London for example, the vast number of KFC-style 
chicken shops means that a deal for 2 pieces of chicken, chips (fries) and a 
drink shouldn't cost you more than &pound;2, and will satisfy even the largest 
of appetites. Another good (and cheap) lunch option is a chicken or lamb doner 
(gyro) at many outlets throughout the city.</p> 
<p>Tipping may also be different than what you're used to. All meals include 
the 17.5% VAT tax and some places include a service fee (10-12%). The general 
rule is to leave a tip for table service, unless there's already a service 
charge added or unless the service has been notably poor. The amount tipped is 
generally in the region of 10%, but if there's a figure between 10 and 15% 
which would leave the bill at a conveniently round total, many would consider 
it polite to tip this amount. Tipping for counter service, or any other form of 
service, is unusual - but some choose to do so if a tips container is provided.
</p> 
<h3>[edit] Restaurants</h3> 
<p>As one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, you can find restaurants 
serving food cuisine from nearly every country, some of it as good as, if not 
better than the countries of origin. If you are looking for particular 
nationalities these tend to be clustered in certain areas:Brick Lane in East 
London is famous for curries but for better quality Tooting in South West London
 has a good reputation and is cheaper.Brixton for African/Caribbean, Chinatown 
inSoho for Chinese, Edgware Road in Marylebone for Middle Eastern and Drummond 
Street (just behind Euston railway station) for a selection of good value 
Indian vegetarian.Golders Green for Jewish and Kingsland Road for good cheap 
Vietnamese. Other nationalities are equally represented, but are randomly 
dotted all over London. It is usally wisest to eat in restaurants on main 
thoroughfares, rather than on quiet backstreets.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Chains</h3> 
<p>Like other capitals in the world, London has the usual array of fast food 
outlets. Sandwich shops are London's most popular places to buy lunch, and 
there are a lot of places to choose from. Some Italian sandwich shops have a 
very good reputation and you can identify them easily by looking at the long 
queues at lunchtime. If all else fails, Central London has lots of 
mini-supermarkets operated by the big British supermarket chains (e.g. Marks 
&amp; Spencer, Sainsbury's, Tesco) where you can pick up a pre-packed sandwich.

cooked food at a reasonable price, in a well-designed canteen style restaurant. 
Diners are seated on benches opposite each other, so not a good place for an 
intimate meal. Two dozen restaurants around [[London/Central|Central London]]. 
Main course &pound;5-8</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Vegetarian</h3> 
<p>London has plenty of vegetarian-only restaurants, and a quick search in 
Google will produce plenty of ideas, so you never have to see a piece of cooked 
meat all week. If you are dining with carnivorous friends, then most 
restaurants will cater for vegetarians, and will have at least a couple of 
dishes on the menu. Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants are generally more fruitful, 
as they have plenty of traditional dishes that only use vegetables. There are 
also many vegetarian Thai buffet places where you can eat somewhat unconvincing 
(but tasty) meat substitute grub for &pound;5. These can be found on Greek 
Street, Old Compton Street and Islington High Street.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Food For Thought</strong>, : Neal Street, Covent Garden. Tasty 
range of choices for vegetarians and vegans.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Red Veg</strong>, : Dean Street, Soho <em>(opposite Tesco)</em>. 
For those of you looking for veggie fast food, some great stuff.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Religious</h3> 
<p>Due to the mix of cultures and religions, many London restaurants cater 
well for religious dietary requirements. The most common signs are for Halal 
and Kosher meat, from burger joints to nice restaurants. There are plenty of 
Kosher restaurants in London, mainly inGolders Green and Edgware. </p>

tryIndie London. </p> <br>
<br>

<p>London is home to a great many pubs, bars and nightclubs. The weekly 
magazine<i>Time Out</i> [41] can inform you of what's going in London's night 
life, as well as with cultural events in general.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Pubs &amp; bars</h3> 
<p>London is an expensive place and your drink is likely to cost more than its 
equivalent elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Expect to pay close on &pound;3 for 
a pint of beer in an average pub. However many local pubs, especially those run 
by chains like Wetherspoons and Scream tend to be more reasonably priced, the 
latter catering for a student audience. In the Bloomsbury area, check out<b>The 
Court</b> (near the North end of Tottenham Court Road) and <b>The Rocket</b> 
(Euston Road); both are fairly cheap to drink in, given that they cater for 
students of the adjacent University College London. Directly opposite the 
British Library is<b>The Euston Flyer</b>, popular with locals and commuters 
alike given its close proximity toSt Pancras International railway station. 
Classier bars and pubs can be much more expensive. However, the cost of alcohol 
drops significantly the further away you go from the centre (though be aware 
that West London tends to be an exception, with prices pretty much the same as 
the centre).</p>

<h3>[edit] Nightclubs</h3> 
<p>Nightlife seems to be an integral feature of London life and there are 
countless nightclubs in and around Central London with music to suit even the 
most eclectic of tastes. Districts in London tend to specialize to different 
types of music.</p> 
<p>The <b>Farringdon/Hoxton/Shoreditch</b> area mainly consists of clubs 
playing drum and bass, house and trance music and is home to two superclubs, 
Fabric (arguably the sexiest nightclub in London) and Turnmills. The clubs in 
this area are often home to the world's top DJ's and attracts a lively crowd.
</p> 
<p>The area around the <b>West End</b> (Leicester Square, Mayfair, Piccadilly) 
is home to the more upmarket and exclusive clubs in London. This area attracts 
a rather pretentious crowd who love to flaunt what they have and is a must go 
to celebrity spot. Beware that drinks are ridiculously expensive and many clubs 
operate a guestlist only policy. Music played here is often of the chart funky 
house, hip hop and R&amp;B genre. Notable clubs include Cafe De Paris, China 
White, Funky Buddha, Mahiki, Number One Leicester Square and Paper.</p> 
<p>The <b>Camden</b> area in North London is made of clubs which play Indie, 
metal and rock music. Notable clubs include Electric Ballroom, the world famous 
Koko, and Underworld.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Gay and lesbian</h3> 
<p>London has a vibrant gay scene with countless bars, clubs and events. The 
nucleus of London's gay scene is undoubtedly the western half of Old Compton 
Street inSoho and the surrounding area, but over the last couple of years 
Vauxhall has seen a boom. You will probably find that most places, particularly 
Camden and Shoreditch, straight bars will have a mixed clientele. To find out 
what is going on during your visit, Boyz Magazine[42] is published fortnightly 
and is freely available at most London gay venues, and contains listings of 
everything that is happening in all the major clubs in London and the South 
East. Gay Pride[43] is held every year in June with parade and street parties. 
The choice of places to go sometimes seem to be unmanageable.</p>

<h2>[edit] Sleep</h2> 
<p>London has hundreds of options for accommodation from hostels through 
historic bed and breakfasts (B&amp;Bs) and apartments to five star hotels. Your 
budget will have a lot to do with what part of London you will want to stay in. 
Prices range from &pound;20-200 per person per night. Expect smaller than 
average rooms especially at the low end of this range. The extra cost of 
getting around is probably not significant compared to hotel savings further 
out. With the excellent Tube available where you stay won't limit what you see 
but be sure to check where the closest tube station is to your hotel. Staying 
further out will be cheaper but when travelling in allow 1-2min per tube stop 
(near the center), around 2-3min per stop (further out) and 5min per line 
change. This can easily total up to a 1 hour journey if there is a walk at each 
end.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Bloomsbury - relatively quiet district with a wide range of 
accommodation. Cartwright Gardens features a dozen small B&amp;Bs in historic 
houses. Many budget options are located on Argyle Street. Gets a little seedy 
towards and beyond King's Cross railway station.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Earl's Court in West central London - budget and modest accommodation as 
well as good 4 star hotels.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Paddington in West central London - has undergone a lot of change 
recently largely resulting from the Heathrow Express train coming into 
Paddington station. Good hotels can be found in the immediate area of the 
station and in quieter spots a short walk away.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> St James's - lots of small B&amp;Bs around the back of Victoria railway 
station, in the Pimlico area.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Bed &amp; Breakfast Hotel</b> - The Jesmond Dene Hotel [44] is an 
inexpensive family Bed and Breakfast that can offer you cheap hotel 
accommodation in London together with a traditional English Breakfast and clean 
and cozy rooms. The Jesmond Dene Hotel has been established for over 20 years, 
and is located in Central London, UK. It is close to many famous sites and has 
the best local transportation in London. The nearest underground station is 
Kings Cross St. Pancras - from here you are moments away from all parts of 
London and have easy access to the northern parts of the UK. Prices start from 
&pound;35 per night for a basic single room.<i>27 Argyle Street Kings Cross 
London WC1H 8EP, UK. Tel: 020 7837 4654.</i> </p> 
<p><b>Hostels</b> are not necessarily as unpleasant as you may think, and as 
long as you don't mind sharing with others, they can be the most cost effective 
option, and also offer breakfast as well as kitchens for self catering. The<b>
Youth Hostel Association of England and Wales</b> [45] (YHA) operates four 
hostels in Central London. As of 2006, the YHA's prices were &pound;24.80 for 
Bed and Breakfast per night for Hostelling International members, a &pound;1 
supplement per person per night for non-members. Like everything else, you 
should book online well in advance - the hostels usually fill up on Friday and 
Saturday nights about 14 days before. A top tip is don't be put off if there 
are no beds left online, phone the hostel in question to see if there are still 
beds available or if there has been a cancellation. Some of the YHA's 
properties also offer a limited number of private family rooms - expect to pay 
&pound;61 per night.</p>

<h2>[edit] Contact</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Wi-Fi access</h3> 
<p>Unlike some other cities, London is unfortunately not noted for free public 
wifi access - as yet. That said, a number of projects are in place or in 
development. See[46] for a map containing free wifi locations. </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Online-4-Free.com</strong>, Website: http://online-4-free.com/. 
One of the most promising (it seems) for traveller-frequented areas, a service 
that provides blanket coverage along the banks of the River Thames (and some 
surrounding streets) from Millbank down to Greenwich Pier, and a small 'cloud' 
in Holborn - the free service only asks that you view a short advertisement 
every half hour in order to get 256 kbps (higher rates and ad-free come at a 
small charge). Free</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Tate Modern</strong>, Website: 
http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/information/wifi.htm. Offering for a trial period 
free wi-fi internet access. Free</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Starbucks</strong>. Offering free wi-fi internet access for all 
their customers. Free</li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Stay safe</h2> 
<p>In an emergency, telephone &quot;999&quot; (or &quot;112&quot;). This 
number connects to Police, Ambulance and Fire/Rescue services. You will be 
asked which of these three services your require before being connected to the 
relevant operator.</p> 
<p>Like many big cities, London has a variety of social problems, especially 
begging, drug abuse, theft (mobile phones are a favourite). London has one of 
the oldest police forces in the world, The Metropolitan Police Service (
http://www.met.police.uk/), and as such, makes London an extremely safe place 
to visit and walk around. Alongside the regular Police, the are over 4000 
Police Community Support Officers (PCSO's) that provide a highly visible 
presence on the streets and are able to deal with low-level crime. Normal 
precautions for the safe keeping of your personal possessions, as you would do 
in any other city, are suggested.</p> 
<p>Don't take illegal minicabs (see 'Getting Around' for details). Travelling 
on lower deck of a night bus is generally safer, as there are more passengers 
around, and you are visible by the bus driver. If you have been the victim of 
crime on the railways or the London Underground, you should report the crime as 
soon as possible to the British Transport Police, who have an office in most 
major train and tube stations. Elsewhere, you should report your crime as 
normal to the Metropolitan Police.</p> 
<p>If you're planning to go out late at night and are worried about safety, 
frequent crowded areas such as the West End. There are always plenty of people 
on the street, even at 4am. Generally, outside central London, South and East 
suburban areas are considered more dangerous, notably Brixton and Hackney, 
although some parts of North-West London such as Harlesden and Northern Camden 
are also known trouble spots. The main problem which is present right 
throughout London to various degrees is drunken behaviour, particularly on 
Friday and Saturday nights and after soccer matches. Loud and rowdy behaviour 
is to be expected and fights and acts of aggression do occur. If harrassed, it 
is best to simply ignore and walk away from those concerned. Trouble spots can 
be expected around popular drinking locations such as Soho and in various 
suburban centres.</p> 
<p>Even busy night time Soho presents a particular danger; the <b>&quot;clip 
joint&quot;</b>. The usual targets of these establishments are male tourists. 
Usually, an attractive woman will casually befriend the victim and recommend a 
local bar. The establishment will be near-desolate, and even if the victim has 
only a drink or two, the bill will run to hundreds of pounds. If payment is not 
immediately provided, the bouncers will lock the &quot;patrons&quot; inside and 
take it by force. If it appears you are being lured into a &quot;clip 
joint&quot;, the easiest way out is to recommend a different bar to the new 
&quot;friend&quot; trying to get you into her &quot;favourite local place&quot; 
- and if she staunchly refuses, be very suspicious.</p> 
<p>The Metropolitan Police have placed significant resources in combating 
street level crime. Working in conjunction with borough councils they have been 
able to significantly cut and bring the level of theft and pickpocketing in 
major retail areas in London. Whilst gun crime, by United States standards is 
extremely low, deaths from gunshot wounds are increasing, however these usually 
occur within gang disputes particularly in South and East London. Knife crime 
is however much higher and as such, conflicts should be avoided as tragic 
deaths caused as a result of seemingly petty incidents do occur from concealed 
weapons.</p> 
<p>Street gang culture is a growing problem in London as with many other 
cities in England. Distinctive dress codes can be noticed which include 
excessive amounts of sports and/or hip-hop clothing, loose fitting baseball 
caps and most notoriously, hooded tops which are usually worn with the hood up 
all throughout the day and night and during hot and cold weather. If you notice 
crowds of youths dressed in this distinctive style, avoid them. Do not escalate 
situations as such individuals are often extremely violent and can suddenly 
demonstrate extreme aggression and often carry concealed knives and even guns. 
You are unlikely to encounter such problems within predominantly touristy 
central London, but various outer suburbs require greater vigilance.<b>Avoid 
large areas of social housing estates unless you know people there, they can be 
very dangerous places.</b> London is also home to some notorious organised 
gangs, but they wont pose any danger unless you are involved in that scene.</p> 
<p>London is a fairly safe city for its size, and most visits should be 
trouble-free. The police are generally very helpful when problems do occur.</p>
