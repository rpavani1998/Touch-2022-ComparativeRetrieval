<title>The TSA Blog: Why is ID Important for Security?</title>

<h3>  Why is ID Important for Security? </h3> 
<p> </p> Last week we announced on our Web site a plan to begin REQUIRING ID 
from travelers on June 21st. This plan includes enabling our officers to refuse 
entry into the area beyond the security checkpoint to anyone who does not 
cooperate with us to establish his or her identity. The exclusive reason to do 
this is to ensure people are who they say they are and are not gaming the 
system by using a boarding pass with a fake name; a well-known endeavor of 
professionals andcollege kids alike that could potentially circumvent the 
no-fly list.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Does that mean that if you lose your wallet 
in the cab on the way to the airport you&rsquo;re going to have to walk home?
</em> </strong> <br>
<br>
Absolutely not&hellip;this rule is solely focused on 
the passenger who simply will not provide ID or help us establish their 
identity.<br>
<br>
So for the security experts in the crowd (and you know 
you&rsquo;re out there) you might be asking yourself a few questions, like:<br>

<br> <strong><em>So if a terrorist shows up and says his dog ate his ID, 
you&rsquo;ll just let him go?<br>
</em></strong> <br>
The answer is a simple 
and clear NO. Under today&rsquo;s rules, you show up, say you lost your ID, get 
a quick pat down, have your bag searched and you&rsquo;re on your way. One 
enterprising fellow has even advocated it as a quicker way through security in 
the past.<br>
<br>
Starting June 21, that person could be subjected to a range 
of options, including interviews with behavior detection officers and local 
and/or federal law enforcement, enhanced pat-downs or other options. By 
increasing our options, people with bad intentions don&rsquo;t know what 
exactly to plan against, have to beat multiple layers at the checkpoint and 
need to be ready to face any number of obstacles to their plans.<br>
<br>

<strong><em>Why would a terrorist show up and say he has no ID when he can just 
show a fake and breeze right through?<br>
</em></strong> <br>
Ah hah, 
that&rsquo;s where layers of security really come into play. TSA has deployed 
thousands of highly-trained document checkers to identify fake IDs. We&rsquo;ve 
caught everything from Spring Breakers with terrible IDs tofraudulent passports
. Our officers are very adept at finding fake documents and work closely with 
behavior detection officers on a daily basis. The old story of the airline 
contractor not even looking up at a person while checking IDs is long in the 
rear view mirror.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>This is just an assault on my personal 
freedoms and security theater.</em></strong> <br>
<br>
The only reason 
we&rsquo;re doing this is to make sure people are who they say they are and not 
someone who is a known threat to aviation.<br>
<br>
Also, our partners in the 
law enforcement and intelligence communities work tirelessly to identify 
potential threats to aircraft. Enhancing our ID requirements further enables 
TSA security officers to ensure that individuals are who they say they are when 
they enter the security checkpoint and not individuals who may pose a threat.
<br> <br>
<strong><em>And for all the legal eagles out there, it is my 
constitutional right to fly without ID.</em></strong> <br>
<br>
Under the law 
that created TSA, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, the TSA 
administrator is responsible for overseeing aviation security (P.L. 107-71) and 
has the authority to establish security procedures at airports (49 C.F.R. 
&sect; 1540.107). Passengers who fail to comply with security procedures may be 
prohibited from entering the secure area of airports to catch their flight (49 
C.F.R. &sect; 1540.105(a)(2). Additionally, in Gilmore v. Gonzalez, 435 F.3d 
1125 (9th Cir. 2006) the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the 
plaintiff&rsquo;s constitutional challenges to a passenger identification 
policy.<br>
<br>
This initiative is simply a way for us to better enforce the 
no-fly list and ensure the safety of the traveling public. No secret motives, 
no hidden agendas, just a security enhancement aimed at people trying to game 
the system.<br>

<strong>Update: 6/14/08<br>
</strong> <br>
Just a 
quick note&hellip; Our ticket checkers found a fraudulent ID at JFK. Just 
thought some of you might be interested.<br>
<br>
At New York Kennedy Airport 
(JFK) on Thursday, June 12, a passenger was interviewed by police after 
attempting to enter into a security checkpoint with a fraudulent ID.<br>
<br>
A 
TSA Travel Document Checker noticed a passenger trying to use a fraudulent New 
York driver&rsquo;s license and notified the Port Authority Police Department 
who came and interviewed her. The Port Authority Police Department released the 
passenger after issuing a Summons to Appear.<br>
<br>
Travel Document Checkers 
are TSA officers that are specially trained to detect fraudulent IDs and 
boarding passes to help keep our airports safe and secure.<br>

<p>sounds a lot like Nazi Germany to me... Where are your papers?? If the 
security systems actually worked then there would be no need to check ID. This 
is just another attempt to control the American people and steal more and more 
of our rights. We need to take back some more essential liberty. Thank you TSA 
for continuing to trample on the Constitution and then mock those of us who 
care. AWESOME job.</p>

<p>C'mon people, you had to know by now that the TSA's word supersedes the 
Constitution of the United States of America.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, as has 
been demonstrated many, many times before, it's much too easy to design fake 
boarding passes that look 100% real, even to these so-called trained inspectors 
(See: Boing Boing). My last set of boarding passes were printed on paper that 
felt like a cheap Wal-Mart receipt.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the terrorists from 
9/11 were in the country legally and had valid IDs (see: open a newspaper), and 
were these &quot;laws&quot; in place on September 11th, 2001, those planes 
would have still been hijacked.<br>
<br>
Wake me up when the TSA actually does 
something that actually increases airport security! (Although I still stand by 
the opinion that if someone ever tries to hijack an airplane ever again, every 
person on that plane will stand up and beat that hijacker into a bloody pulp.)

<p>Too many holes in this feeble attempt to say that it enhances security. 
Show me just ONE terrorist that you have apprehended. Or maybe you can use the 
argument that they are scared away. Like in the previous article, a comment was 
made that the 9/11 terrorists ALL had valid ID's and used their real names. 
Yes, you have caught numerous criminals, but none caught, would have caused a 
&quot;security&quot; problem on an airplane. This is just to get the public 
used to one more &quot;requirement&quot; to fly, so that the next round of 
requirements will come easier. Like the frog in the hot water experiment. I 
think you will have a hard time really convincing us this promotes security.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s think about this:<br>
<br>
Making sure the guy sitting next to 
you on the plane isn&rsquo;t a terrorist is about as basic as security gets. 
Ensuring that people on the no-fly list don&rsquo;t get on board is as 
important as using the metal detector. To do that, you have to be able to 
identify people. This new requirement is meant for the person that simply 
won&rsquo;t produce ID nor work with us to determine that they&rsquo;re not 
someone that poses a threat to that flight.<br>
<br>
Instead of allowing anyone 
without an ID to show up, go through a quick pat down and bag check, 
circumventing watch list matching, we&rsquo;re now opening up the options to 
include interviews with behavior detection officers and law enforcement; 
options no real terrorist is looking forward to and ones that legitimate 
passengers will find quicker and more convenient than today&rsquo;s process.<br>
<br>&ldquo;If the security systems actually worked then there would be no need 
to check ID.&rdquo; You really mean to advocate searching exclusively for 
pointy objects and not individuals that may pose a threat? If so, we&rsquo;re 
at a philosophical divide that no amount of discussion is going to change.<br>

<br>One need look no further than the ongoing trial in London to see the 
dangers of looking only for things. The London plotters were going to use items 
that weren&rsquo;t on the prohibited item list at the time but would have blown 
up 7 airliners over the Atlantic. As the 9/11 Commission said, &ldquo;the 
policy challenges were linked to this failure of imagination&hellip;&rdquo;<br>

<br>&ldquo;This is just another attempt to control the American people and 
steal more and more of our rights.&rdquo; Actually, it&rsquo;s an effort to 
keep people that pose a threat to aviation off airplanes and keep you, your 
family and mine safe.<br>
<br>
And I sincerely hope you do not feel that anyone 
at TSA is mocking you. We value this opportunity to discuss important issues 
with the traveling public and cherish the opportunity to communicate directly 
with you.<br>

<br>
Seriously, though, 
you people seriously messed up. You need to train your agents to say 
&quot;papers please&quot; when they ask for ID, because that's what this is. 
The agenda is to ensure that everyone has their papers in proper order. This 
would be security theater if you did this for the purpose of catching the bad 
guys, but for that to be true you need to be doing this to catch the bad guys.
<br><br>
BTW, an unanswered question from way back - what about the states that 
do not conform to READ ID? I think I get it - none of them will be allowed in 
the sterile area.<br>
<br>
What's really funny (not) is that you claim you're 
not preventing anyone from flying, you're only preventing them from entering 
the sterile area. Show me how to fly without entering the sterile area and I 
will agree with you.<br>
<br>
You people need to goosestep over to the 
constitution and read it. You obviously haven't a clue.</p>

<p>Yes, Christopher, I do feel you are mocking me. I neither need nor want the

rights trampled by TSOs who make up rules on the spot and having to pay for 
bureaucrats to imagine new ways to remove what is left of my constituional 
rights.<br>
<br>
After re-reading the London bomber plot, do you know what I 
noticed? I noticed that sniffers could have detected the bombs. Concentrated 
H2O2 is detectable.<br>
<br>
You gained credibility when you actually addressed 
the mmw and 3-1-1 issues. You've lost it again with this. It seems the TSA<i>
wants</i> to be hated.<br>
<br>
And you still refuse to address the states that 
don't conform to REAL ID. Will it be 100% pat downs or 100% denial into 
sanitized area?</p>

<p>You have completely failed to explain how requiring people to identify 
themselves to government agents prior to traveling within the United States 
will improve transportation security.<br>
<br>
You wrote that beginning June 
21, you will require passengers to present ID. Then, beginning with the 
following paragraph, you explained that some passengers will not be required to 
present ID. The truth is that you are not requiring ID, but plan to continue to 
coerce people into voluntarily showing ID and also to harass travelers who wish 
to exercise their right to travel and associate without interference from their 
government.<br>
<br>
You wrote, <i>&quot;This plan includes enabling our 
officers to refuse entry into the area beyond the security checkpoint anyone 
that does not cooperate with us to establish his or her identity. The exclusive 
reason to do this is to ensure people are who they say they are and are not

endeavor of professionals and college kids alike that could potentially

<br>
This will not ensure that people 
are who they say they are. Anyone with sufficient determination will acquire a 
fake ID or steal someone else's identity and get a real ID with that person's 
identity and his own photograph. In fact, your system will allow a criminal 
organization to probe your system by sending people on innocent trips, noting 
which ones are flagged for additional screening, then send the other people on 
a real mission later.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to note that most of the 
instances of passengers being caught with falsified ID cards and passports that 
are described onTSA's &quot;Travel Document Checker (TDC)&quot; Web page (under 
&quot;Travel Document Checking Success Stories&quot;) were arrested on charges 
of immigrations violations, possession of illegal drugs, or credit card theft.
<b>None of them is described as having been found to be carrying anything that, 
had he brought it onto his flight, would have put other passengers or crew at 
risk.</b></p>

<p>While flying out of Kansas City last year, I saw TSA signs at the airport 
stating that travelers must present government-issued photo identification. I 
knew that wasn't true, and I didn't show ID. I neither caused trouble nor 
slowed things down for other travelers when I asserted my right to travel 
without checking in with the government by identifying myself; I was taken out 
of line to be screened along with other &quot;selectees&quot;.<br>
<br>
After 
returning home, I filed a complaint with TSA. I received aresponse from Jeanne 
Oliver, Associate Director of TSA Office of the Executive Secretariat. She did 
not indicate that TSA would fix the problem, but did confirm that if a traveler 
is &quot;unwilling or unable to produce a valid form of ID, the traveler is 
required to undergo additional screening at the checkpoint to gain access to 
the secured area of the airport.&quot; People who show ID receive a 
less-thorough screening. Any time saved when people volunteer to show ID comes 
at the cost of less effectively checking them for dangerous items.<br>
<br>

We're being lied to about federal air travel policies by airport security at 
KCI and other locations, and it's not making us any safer.<br>
<br>
Government 
agents requiring people to show ID before boarding a flight wouldn't make air 
travel any safer. It's relatively easy to get a fake ID, and regardless of how 
much technology we put into ID cards, a criminal will be able to purchase a 
fake one or steal someone else's identity and get a real ID with his picture 
and the other person's name.<br>
<br>
We can and do call upon TSA to ensure 
safe air travel by preventing people from carrying dangerous items onto 
flights. TSA's current practice of allowing people who show ID through security 
with less screening than other people receive contributes to a false sense of 
security, breeding complacency among passengers, crew, and TSA agents.<br>
<br>

I acknowledge that the inconvenience of showing ID is trivial. My concern is 
that a requirement to show ID would allow the government to monitor and 
restrict our travel. Our courts have established that people in this country 
have the right to travel and associate without being monitored or stopped by 
the government unless they have been convicted of committing a crime or are 
suspected -- with good reason -- of having committed a crime. They have ruled 
that we cannot set up roadblocks and checkpoints to stop everyone who passes 
just to catch the few who have done something wrong, or to find the few who are 
suspected of intending to do something wrong.<br>
<br>
Recent Congressional 
testimony suggests that over 900,000 names are now on the United States' 
so-called &quot;terrorist watch list&quot;. Many people who have found 
themselves on the list are U.S. citizens who have no ties to any terrorist 
organization. There is no appeals process for those who have been blacklisted. 
We are not allowed to know who is on the list, who put them there, or why they 
were put on it.<br>
<br>
<b>If these people pose a danger to others, why don't 
we go arrest them instead of waiting for them to present themselves at the 
airport, then hassling them or preventing them from flying before sending them 
on their way?</b><br>
<br>
Even if we could prune the list so that it included 
only people who actually pose a &quot;known&quot; threat, potential terrorists 
could probe the system by sending people on innocent trips, observing which 
ones were subjected to additional screening, then later sending the other 
people on a real terrorist mission. Restricting travel based on an ID check 
simply cannot improve security.<br>
<br>
People can show their ID to whomever 
they want, whenever they want to do so, if it makes them feel safer. My doing 
so doesn't make me feel any safer. When a government agent asks me to show my 
papers or searches me, I feel *un*safe. It reminds me of descriptions of life 
in the former USSR, where identification was required upon demand, movement was 
restricted, and people either kept quiet and did as they were told, or risked 
disappearing into the night, never to be heard from again.<br>
<br>
When I see 
security guards in airports wearing what look like police uniforms and 
demanding identification, and police on our streets wearing what look like 
military uniforms, driving DHS-grant-funded armored vehicles, marching in riot 
gear with machine guns, pepper-spraying and Tasing peaceful demonstrators, it 
makes me feel like I live in what is approaching a totalitarian state.</p>

<p>None of your reasoning makes sense. If I lie about who I am, but aren't 
carrying anything to pose a threat to an airline, what does it matter if I fly 
within the United States?<br>
<br>
If I'm a college student attempting to fly 
on a ticket with soemone elses name on it, how is that a threat to homeland 
security or an airplane?<br>
<br>
How about I just tell you my name to 
establish my identity. It works for law enforcement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Enhancing 
our ID requirements further enable TSA security officers to ensure that 
individuals are who they say they are when they enter the security checkpoint 
and not individuals that may pose a threat.&quot; I call redundant argument and 
respond with redundant arguement. BS Having a name on a piece of plastic match 
a name on a piece of paper doesn't improve security and takes time away from 
processes that might. Consider...Sticks and Stones can break my bones, but 
Names will never hurt me. Prohibit dangerous items from being taken on 
airplanes, don't worry about peoples names.<br>
<br>
Of the 900,000+ names on 
your no fly list, how many really belong to terrorists? Has your agency ever 
caught a terrorist with the assistance of the no-fly list? I've heard of a lot 
of 5 yr olds, grandmothers, and others hastled, delyed, SSSSearched and annoyed 
by the process, but few or no big fish caught by your agency.<br>
<br>
Thanks 
for posting the subject though, I'm sure you'll get quite the response.</p>

So, I noticed the last time I flew, that the ID checker 
used a black light and loupe (sp?) on my Passport when matching the names. I'm 
curious, though. What memory techniques are you teaching your TSOs that allow 
them to memorize the monstrous no-fly list so that they can match my name 
against it in their head?<br>
<br>
It seems your rational is such: 
&quot;Everyone who enters an airport is a threat until we determine them not to 
be.&quot; That sounds a little like the exact opposite of &quot;innocent until 
proven guilty.&quot;<br>

<p>I always show ID when asked - don't think it is a big deal although I 
understand who doesn't want to show it. It is the addition of a new rule and 
the whole &quot;layers of security&quot; talk that worries me.<br>
<br>
First 
computers had to come out of bags. There was no Science to prove that X-rays 
can't see through fabric, but we still had to follow the rule. Then in was 
shoes, then it was fingerprinting and photographing, then nail clippers (now 
back), then no fly and &quot;suspicious&quot; persons lists then liquid 
limitations, then having to take hooded sweatshirts off (beware! unwritten 
rule!), then transit visas, then puffers, then virtual strip search machines, 
and now ID or Psycho Super Screener grilling you Guantanamo style (better 
described as ID &quot;or else&quot;).<br>

How many new rules, all 
unjustified and unproven, will we have to subject to? When does this stop?</p>

<br>
No. If he is a terrorist, he is probably 
in prison. If you want to take action based on the fact someone will someday 
become a terrorist by committing an act of terrorism, you will need to check 
your crystal ball. In the United States, we are innocent in the eyes of the law

No. Best we can tell, plenty of innocent people are on your blacklist. 
You will not allow us to know how they got there or how to get off of it.<br>

<br><i>&quot;To [restrict travel based on our secret blacklist, we] have to be

Agreed. However, we should not 
restrict travel based on your blacklist, and you simply<i>cannot</i> identify 
people who are determined not to be identified.<br>

requirement is meant for the person that simply won&rsquo;t produce ID nor work 
with us to determine that they&rsquo;re not someone that poses a threat to that

Exactly. You're going to punish patriots for 
standing up for their rights. Those people who are willing to simply lie to 
you, helping to convince everyone else that it is okay to ask for permission 
from their government before traveling within their own country, will be 
unaffected by your new rule.<br>

<br>
You have that option now, prior to implementation 
of your new rule. This statement is irrelevant to the topic at hand.<br>
<br>

<i>&quot;[Someone wrote:] `If the security systems actually worked then there 
would be no need to check ID.' You really mean to advocate searching

<br>
I believe that it is ridiculous for you to allow thousands of 
security guards to determine on-the-spot whether someone &quot;may pose a 
threat&quot; based on anything besides whether or not that that person is 
carrying a dangerous item onto a flight.<br>
<br>

Identity Project: No matter how sophisticated the security embedded into an 
I.D., a well-funded criminal will be able to falsify it. Honest people, 
however, go to Pro-Life rallies. Honest people go to Pro-Choice rallies, too. 
Honest people attend gun shows. Honest people protest the actions of the 
President of the United States. Honest people fly to political conventions.<b>
What if those with the power to put people on a 'no fly' list decided that they 
didn't like the reason for which you wanted to travel? The honest people 
wouldn't be going anywhere.</b></p>

<p>I take the liberty of offering the words of one who has read, researched, 
reasoned and conributed to the discussion here. As trollkiller said:<br>
<br>

&quot;Anonymous said...<br>
You can all thank, with weepy eyes, activist John 
Gilmore who took the U.S. government to court in 2004 over showing ID to fly. 
Gilmore refused to show ID to TSA and also refused to undergo the more thorough 
&quot;secondary screening&quot; search. He eventually lost his case before the 
9th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals which recognized that persons have the 
right to travel, but not necessarily by airplane. So through Gilmore's activist 
actions intent on undoing ID requirements to fly, he did the exact opposite and 
compelled one of the most liberal activist courts in this country to reject his 
claim and create the case law that this requirement will be based upon. Don't 
forget this little tidbit of authority taken directly from tsa.gov:<br>
Under 
the law that created TSA, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, the TSA 
administrator is responsible for overseeing aviation security (P.L. 107-71) and 
has the authority to establish security procedures at airports (49 C.F.R. 
&sect; 1540.107). Passengers that fail to comply with security procedures may 
be prohibited from entering the secure area of airports to catch their flight 
(49 C.F.R. &sect; 1540.105(a)(2).<br>
<br>
If a lawyer at the TSA signed off on 
this based on the Gilmore vs. Ashcroft (now Gonzales) case, they need to find 
another profession.<br>
<br>
For those that want to play along at home, here is 
the 9th Circuit Court Of Appeals ruling. (PDF Warning)<br>
<br>
The MOST 
important aspect of the Gilmore case is Gilmore refused to show his ID to the 
AIRLINE employees.<br>
<br>
The Gilmore case hinges on the fact that he could 
fly without ID if he allowed himself to be subject to a secondary screening. 
(Reasonable) Gilmore chose not to allow it.<br>
<br>
The case also hinges on 
the fact he could leave instead of being searched. (Reasonable)<br>
<br>
The 
9th Circus also ruled that his travel was not restricted because he did not 
prove to them that the same ID requirement was in place for buses or trains. 
(Lazy)<br>
<br>
With this new policy in effect it requires you show your ID to 
a Government agent and removes the choice of a secondary screening. If the 
passenger decides to uphold his right not to present papers the TSA can invoke 
penalties.<br>
<br>
I have been working on this post for two days, I was trying 
to be fair, and just present the facts. I can't, this idiotic new rule has my 
blood boiling. Reading the court decision that will bolster this new ID 
requirement and the asinine reasoning the 9th Circuit used to back their ruling 
is about to make my head explode.<br>
<br>
Take this part where they say 
denying a person the ability to fly is equal to denying a person the ability to 
drive. Bolding mine.<br>
<br>
III. Right To Travel<br>
[11] Gilmore alleges 
that the identification policy violates<br>
his constitutional right to travel 
because he cannot travel by<br>
commercial airlines without presenting 
identification, which<br>
is an impermissible federal condition.10 <br>
<br>
We 
reject Gilmore&rsquo;s<br>
right to travel argument because the Constitution 
does not<br>
guarantee the right to travel by any particular form of 
transportation.<br>
<br>
Because Gilmore lacks standing to challenge anything 
but the identification policy&rsquo;s impact on air travel, his sole argument
<br>is that &ldquo;air travel is a necessity and not replaceable by<br>
other 
forms of transportation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Although we do not question this 
allegation for purposes of this petition, it does not follow<br>
that 
Defendants violated his right to travel, given that other<br>
forms of travel 
remain possible.<br>
<br>
This circuit&rsquo;s decision in Miller v. Reed, 176 
F.3d 1202<br>
(9th Cir. 1999), is on point. In Miller, the plaintiff challenged
<br>California&rsquo;s requirement that applicants submit their social<br>

security numbers to the DMV in order to obtain valid drivers<br>
licenses. <br>

<br>The plaintiff alleged that this policy violated his fundamental<br>
right 
to interstate travel and his right to freely exercise<br>
his religion. In 
affirming the district court&rsquo;s dismissal<br>
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), 
we concluded that<br>
<br>
&ldquo;by denying Miller a single mode of 
transportation&mdash;in a car driven by himself&mdash;the DMV did not 
unconstitutionally impede Miller&rsquo;s<br>
right to interstate travel.&rdquo; 
Id. at 1204.<br>
<br>
Although we recognized<br>
the fundamental right to 
interstate travel, we also acknowledged<br>
that &ldquo;burdens on a single 
mode of transportation do not<br>
implicate the right to interstate 
travel.&rdquo; Id. at 1205 (citing<br>
Monarch Travel Servs., Inc. v. 
Associated Cultural Clubs,<br>
Inc., 466 F.2d 552, 554 (9th Cir. 1972)).<br>

[12]<br>
<br>
Like the plaintiff in Miller, Gilmore does not possess a 
fundamental right to travel by airplane even though it is the most convenient 
mode of travel for him.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the identification<br>

policy&rsquo;s &ldquo;burden&rdquo; is not unreasonable. See Shapiro v.<br>

Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629 (1969) (noting the right of all<br>
citizens to be 
&ldquo;free to travel throughout the length and breadth<br>
of our land 
uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or 
restrict this movement&rdquo;), overruled in part on other grounds by Edelman 
v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651,<br>
670-71 (1974). <br>
The identification policy 
requires that airline passengers either present identification OR be subjected 
to a more extensive search.<br>
<br>
The more extensive search is similar to 
searches that we have determined were reasonable and<br>
&ldquo;consistent with 
a full recognition of appellant&rsquo;s constitutional<br>
right to 
travel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
SOMEONE, anyone please explain to me how denying 
someone the ability to OPERATE a car equals the ability to deny someone access 
to a vehicle they are NOT operating? If I am not driving the thing I DON'T need 
a license.<br>
<br>
Thought processes like this is one of the reasons the 9th 
Circuit gets overturned on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
By this fouled up 
reasoning the authorities could in all Constitutional righteousness deny you 
EVERY form of travel except walking. After all denying you a mode of 
transportation does not equal denial freedom of travel.<br>
<br>
To sum up if 
the TSA is going to use Gilmore as its case law to back this new ID requirement 
it will need to understand that<br>
<br>
1) Gilmore refused to show ID to an 
AIRLINE employee, not the TSA,<br>
<br>
2) Gilmore had the OPTION of a 
secondary screening.<br>
<br>
3) Gilmore was not sanctioned for refusing to 
show the ID,<br>
<br>
4) Gilmore was free to leave<br>
<br>
The TSA's new ID 
requirement does not pass the test that allows us to free to travel throughout 
the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or 
regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.<br>
<br>
It is 
an unreasonable burden&quot;<br>
<br>
It took me a few hours to do reaserch 
that trollkiller distilled into a single posting.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

<p>&quot;Circumventing watch list matching&quot; is a joke and will remain a 
joke even after the implementation date.<br>
<br>
Speaking of watch lists and 
no fly lists, if someone is dangerous enough to be on a watch list or a no-fly 
list, shouldn't they be dangerous enough to be arrested and/or prosecuted and 
convicted in a court of law? However that is exactly what does not happen in 
the overwhelming majority of cases where a person with a name on the watch list 
or no-fly lists attempts to travel and does NOT attempt to &quot;circumvent the 
watch list&quot;.<br>
<br>
All such administrative requirements from the TSA 
are very much like what the Nazis and Soviets did, the very things that our 
parents and grandparents in uniform fought against in the Second World War and 
during the Cold War: &quot;Your papers!&quot;, government permission to travel 
domestically, etc.<br>
<br>
Did we lose the Second World War and the Cold War 
only to adopt the ways of our enemies? History books say America won, but it 
looks like the TSA is intent on adopting the same kind of means of control that 
were favored by the Nazis and the Soviets who were on the losing side of 
history.</p>

<p>So help me out here. Is the TSO:<br>
<br>
(a) Checking to see that the 
boarding pass is valid, and<br>
(b) Running the name on the ID through the 
no-fly list?<br>
<br>
Because right now, all one has to do is print their own 
fake boarding pass (e.g., use an old boarding pass and change the name, date, 
and flight number with graphics program and reprint it) that matches their ID. 
However, they've actually had a squeaky clean accomplice make the flight 
reservations, so when the board the airplane they use their real boarding pass.
<br><br>
If you're not doing a and b you fail. And as far as I know, the TSOs 
have no way to validate the boarding pass.<br>
<br>
Note that even if you fail 
at a and b, a terrorist organization can still trivially defeat any ID 
checkpoint by using the &quot;carnival booth&quot; algorithm (google for more 
details).</p>

<p>Christopher, I think that you need to reread Gilmore v. Gonzalez, 435 F.3d 
1125 (9th Cir. 2006). In Gilmore, the Government said that producing ID was not 
required to travel and you were only subjected to a secondary search. It was on 
that foundation that the court rejected Gilmore's challenge. By requiring the 
equivalent of an oral ID, the Ninth Circuit might not see it the same way this 
time.<br>
<br>
As for the London bombers, I think you need to review the 
current testimony of just what was planned and what was to be used. Your 
statement doesn't comport with what I have read.</p>

Let&rsquo;s think about this:<br>
<br>
<br>

Instead of allowing anyone without an ID to show up, go through a quick pat 
down and bag check, circumventing watch list matching, we&rsquo;re now opening 
up the options to include interviews with behavior detection officers and law 
enforcement; options no real terrorist is looking forward to and ones that 
legitimate passengers will find quicker and more convenient than today&rsquo;s 
process.<br>
_____________________________<br>

If these new options are in 
addition to the old process of a<br>
&quot;quick pat down and bag check&quot;, 
how will I find this to be &quot;quicker and more convenient&quot;?</p>

Carry and show your id and u will

<br>
if you forget your id, just 
tell them.<br>

if you dont have one, then just go to the BMV and get a 
state id card ( u need one to get a ticket at the counter or ligitimitly drive

<p>Welcome to the United States of East Germany. Your papers please?<br>
<br>

Seriously, did any of TSA leadership take a civics class or even elementary 
social studies in the US? When I did (in the 1980s), we were taught that a key 
difference between the USA and the USSR and Eastern Bloc was that we didn't 
have to have permission from the government for domestic travel, and didn't 
have to show ID papers on demand.<br>
<br>
My dad spent 23 years in the Cold 
War Air Force to keep the Communists from taking over. My grandfathers both 
fought in WWII to keep the Nazis from taking over. Seems to me that we're 
getting closer to that all being a waste.<br>
<br>
This is yet another example 
of TSA mission creep, and yet the American people put up with it.<br>
<br>
And 
it's another excuse for TSOs to badger and harass innocent people who forget 
their ID, now that they can be officially denied travel based on a subjective 
judgment of &quot;cooperation.&quot;<br>

Then you can either produce the ID, or

<p>I must reiterate, as I've said over and over. I don't care who the person

a person is does absolutely nothing to identify their intent. This farce of 
ID's at the checkpoint is merely a revenue protection mechanism for the

<p>Remember, in Gilmore v. Gonzales, Gilmore did not possess government-issued 
photo identification. (His driver's license was revoked when he was diagnosed 
with epilepsy.) He used and gave his real name, yet he was prevented from 
making his flight (in order to meet with his congressional representative). 
This rule discriminates against those without identification. (And the court 
ruling was simply wrong. Secret laws cannot be constitutional.)<br>
<br>
ID has 
nothing to do with security and everything to do with control.<br>
<br>
Your 
agents may be trained to recognize fake IDs, but what about fake boarding 
passes? I can print my real boarding pass and an identical copy with a 
different name. Use one to get through security and one to board the flight. 
This prevents NOTHING.<br>
<br>
The no-fly list is a disaster. It has prevented 
exactly zero terrorists from flying. It has, however, stopped peaceful 
activists from getting to planned demonstrations and congressmen from flying 
home to meet with their constituents. Is has inconvenienced hundreds if not 
thousands of innocent people from legitimate travel because of a near match on 
a name. There are far too many names on the list to be effective.<br>
<br>
A 
passenger is either a threat because they have a weapon or they are not. 
Whether their name matches one of thousands on an ever-growing list is 
irrelevant.<br>
<br>
The airlines support these measures, because it sells more 
tickets. If the name on your ticket doesn't exactly match the name on your ID 
(e.g., Bob v. Robert), you can be forced to purchase a new ticket.<br>
<br>
In 
California, you have the right to use any name you wish, as long as you are not 
doing so to commit fraud. In other words, the state of California has the 
common sense to recognize that it's your behavior, not your name, that counts.

These policies are hurting the economy by decimating tourism.<br>

<p>Um, the passenger controls the lock (the boarding pass) and the key (the 
ID). So what exactly does this prevent?<br>
<br>
Maybe, if the TSA was checking 
IDs against an airline database of issued boarding passes (or perhaps directly 
against the no-fly list), then MAYBE you could make an argument that this 
could, maybe, potentially possibly make a difference.<br>

The only point

<br>
Enough other 
Americans have ripped apart your agency's notion that ID= any measure of 
security. I will focus on Hawley's flimsy justification and his completely 
unsupported rationale.<br>
<br>
You tried to impress us by quoting a single law 
and a CFR that implements it. Let's look at just a couple of aspects of it, 
shall we?<br>
<br>
<i>From the law itself:<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;(l) 
REGULATIONS.&mdash;<br>
&lsquo;&lsquo;(1) IN GENERAL.&mdash;The Under Secretary 
is authorized to<br>
issue, rescind, and revise such regulations as are 
necessary<br>
to carry out the functions of the Administration.<br>
<br>

&lsquo;&lsquo;(2) EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.&mdash;<br>
<br>
 &lsquo;&lsquo;(A) IN 
GENERAL.&mdash;Notwithstanding any other provision<br>
 of law or executive 
order (including an executive order<br>
 requiring a cost-benefit analysis), if 
the Under Secretary<br>
 determines that a regulation or security directive must
<br> be issued immediately in order to protect transportation<br>
 security, 
the Under Secretary shall issue the regulation<br>
 or security directive 
without providing notice or an opportunity<br>
 for comment and without prior 
approval of the Secretary.<br>
<br>
 (B) REVIEW BY TRANSPORTATION SECURITY 
OVERSIGHT<br>
 BOARD.&mdash;Any regulation or security directive issued under
<br> this paragraph shall be subject to review by the Transportation<br>
 
Security Oversight Board established under section<br>
 115. Any regulation or 
security directive issued under this<br>
 paragraph shall remain effective 
unless disapproved by<br>
 the Board or rescinded by the Under Secretary.<br>

<br>&lsquo;&lsquo;(3) FACTORS TO CONSIDER.&mdash;In determining whether to<br>

issue, rescind, or revise a regulation under this section, the<br>
Under 
Secretary shall consider, as a factor in the final determination,<br>
whether 
the costs of the regulation are excessive<br>
in relation to the enhancement of 
security the regulation will<br>
provide. The Under Secretary may waive 
requirements for an<br>
analysis that estimates the number of lives that will 
be saved<br>
by the regulation and the monetary value of such lives if<br>
the 
Under Secretary determines that it is not feasible to make<br>
such an estimate.
</i><br>
<br>
1. Did Hawley determine that implementing this procedure was an 
&quot;emergency&quot; under PL 107-71? If it wasn't an emergency, I would like 
for you to publish the following documentation:<br>
<br>
1. Chertoff's approval 
of this new procedure, and,<br>
2. A formal approval of the Transportation 
Security oversight Board.<br>
<br>
For the life of me, I couldn't imagine that 
Chertoff and Hawley would not have followed the law of the land to the letter. 
So, all of this justification and approvals documentation must be right at your 
fingertips.<br>
<br>
It's insulting to the American people that you use college 
kids with fake IDs as justification for a &quot;regulation or security 
directive must be issued immediately in order to protect transportation 
security.&quot; (Yep, that's in the law also.)<br>
<br>
Now, how about actually 
reading the Gilmore decision, OK? Here, I'll help you:<br>
<br>
<i>John Gilmore 
(&ldquo;Gilmore&rdquo;) sued Southwest Airlines and the<br>
United States 
Attorney General, Alberto R. Gonzales, among<br>
other defendants,1 alleging 
that the enactment and enforcement of the Government&rsquo;s civilian airline 
passenger identification<br>
policy is unconstitutional. The identification 
policy<br>
requires airline passengers to present identification to airline<br>

personnel before boarding or be subjected to a search that is<br>
more exacting 
than the routine search that passengers who<br>
present identification 
encounter.</i><br>
<br>
An entire Federal District Court bench based the 
Gilmore decision on this assumption. For you to dismiss the entire Gilmore 
decision as not relevant is laughable and insulting to the American people.<br>

<br>And finally:<br>
<br>
<i>This initiative is simply a way for us to better 
enforce the no-fly list and ensure the safety of the traveling public. No 
secret motives, no hidden agendas, just a security enhancement aimed at people 
trying to game the system.</i><br>
<br>
How can you blatantly lie like this and 
sleep at night? This is pure &amp; simple retaliation by a cabinet member with 
no regard for the Constitution he swore to protect and serve. It's pure and 
simple retaliation for not getting his way with REAL ID. And, it's pure and 
simple retaliation against Americans who choose to travel anonymously.</p>

<p>If you are going to blow smoke at least light the cigar first.<br>
<br>
I 
am very very glad you cited the Gilmore case as the legal rational to require 
ID. As you may have noticed on the other page, I have been looking into the 
Gilmore case.<br>
<br>
First and be VERY CLEAR on this, what lost Gilmore his 
case were these facts.<br>
<br>
1) he refused to show an AIRLINE employee his 
ID.<br>
<br>
2) he had the OPTION to take a secondary screening instead of 
showing his ID.<br>
<br>
3) Gilmore was not sanctioned for refusing to show the 
ID,<br>
<br>
4) Gilmore was free to leave.<br>
<br>
Look at the court's opinion 
on the Freedom to travel issue. My inline comments in bold text.<br>
<br>
<i>
III. Right To Travel<br>
<br>
[11] Gilmore alleges that the identification 
policy violates his constitutional right to travel because he cannot travel by 
commercial airlines without presenting identification, which is an 
impermissible federal condition. 10<br>
<br>
We reject Gilmore&rsquo;s right to 
travel argument because the Constitution does not guarantee the right to travel 
by any particular form of transportation.<br>
</i><br>
<br>
<b>True the 
Constitution does not explicitly cover the right to travel, common law does.</b>
<br><i><br>
<br>
Because Gilmore lacks standing to challenge anything but the 
identification policy&rsquo;s impact on air travel, his sole argument is that 
&ldquo;air travel is a necessity and not replaceable by other forms of 
transportation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Although we do not question this allegation for 
purposes of this petition,<br>
<br>
it does not follow that Defendants violated 
his right to travel, given that other forms of travel remain possible.<br>
</i>
<br><br>
<b>Translation: the court did not bother researching the question 
pertaining to the nessecity of air travel. If this had happened in Hawaii would 
the &quot;other forms of travel&quot; argument be viable?</b><br>
<br>
<i><br>

This circuit&rsquo;s decision in Miller v. Reed, 176 F.3d 1202<br>
(9th Cir. 
1999), is on point. In Miller, the plaintiff challenged<br>
California&rsquo;s 
requirement that applicants submit their social<br>
security numbers to the DMV 
in order to obtain valid drivers<br>
licenses. The plaintiff alleged that this 
policy violated his fundamental right to interstate travel and his right to 
freely exercise his religion. In affirming the district court&rsquo;s dismissal 
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we concluded that &ldquo;by denying<br>
Miller a 
single mode of transportation&mdash;in a car driven by<br>
himself&mdash;the 
DMV did not unconstitutionally impede Miller&rsquo;s<br>
right to interstate 
travel.&rdquo; Id. at 1204.<br>
</i><br>
<br>
<b>This is one of the reason's 
the 9th Circuit gets overturned on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
The denial of a 
driver's license due to lack of documentation DOES NOT equal denial of air 
travel.<br>
</b><br>
<i><br>
Although we recognized the fundamental right to 
interstate travel, we also acknowledged that &ldquo;burdens on a single mode of 
transportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel.&rdquo; Id. at 
1205 (citing<br>
Monarch Travel Servs., Inc. v. Associated Cultural Clubs,<br>

Inc., 466 F.2d 552, 554 (9th Cir. 1972)).<br>
<br>
[12] Like the plaintiff in 
Miller</i><br>
<br>
<b>Gilmore is NOTHING like Miller. The &quot;one mode of 
transportation&quot; in the Miller case is strictly the operation of an 
automobile. Unlike Mr. Gilmore, Mr. Miller is still free to use the roads as a 
PASSENGER.</b><br>
<i><br>
, Gilmore does not possess a fundamental right to 
travel by airplane even though it is the most convenient mode of travel for 
him. Moreover, the identification<br>
policy&rsquo;s &ldquo;burden&rdquo; is 
not unreasonable.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Note the &quot;Moreover, the identification 
policy&rsquo;s &ldquo;burden&rdquo; is not unreasonable.&quot; Very true the ID 
requirement in the Gilmore case was not an unreasonable burden because Gilmore 
could have OPTED for a secondary screening instead.</b><br>
<i><br>
<br>
See 
Shapiro v.<br>
Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629 (1969) (noting the right of all 
citizens to be &ldquo;free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our 
land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden 
or restrict this movement&rdquo;), overruled in<br>
part on other grounds by 
Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651,<br>
670-71 (1974). </i><br>
<b><br>
<br>
Note 
the court affirms it is the RIGHT of citizens to travel uninhibited by rules, 
regulations that are an unreasonable burden or restrict movement.</b><br>
<br>

<i><br>
The identification policy requires that airline passengers <b>either</b>
 present identification<b>or</b> be subjected to a more extensive search. The 
more extensive search is similar to searches that we have determined were 
reasonable and<br>
&ldquo;consistent with a full recognition of 
appellant&rsquo;s constitutional right to travel.&rdquo; United States v. 
Davis, 482 F.2d 893, 912-13 (9th Cir. 1973).</i><br>
<br>
<b>Notice the 
&quot;either or&quot; part of that statement. Either you show ID OR you get 
extra screening. Most people find that reasonable. Under your new order, the 
passenger has no choice. (please look up what the court considers an order)<br>

<br>Because of this lack of choice, the ID order creates an envioroment that is 
diametrical to the right of all citizens to be &ldquo;free to travel throughout 
the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or 
regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement&quot;.</b><i>
<br><br>
[13] In Davis, an airline employee searched the defendant&rsquo;s 
briefcase as part of the airport&rsquo;s preboarding screening procedure.<br>

<br>Although we remanded for further consideration of whether the defendant 
consented to the search, we held that airport screening searches of potential 
passengers and their immediate possessions for weapons and explosives is 
reasonable so long as each potential passenger maintains the right to leave the 
airport instead of submitting to the search. Id. at<br>
912. <br>
<br>
In so 
holding, we considered several airport screening procedures, including 
behavioral profiling, magnetometer screening, identification check, and 
physical search of the passenger&rsquo;s person and carry-on baggage. Id. at 
900.<br>
<br>
We see little difference between the search measures discussed in
<br>Davis and those that comprise the &ldquo;selectee&rdquo; search option of
<br>the passenger identification policy at hand.</i><br>
<br>
<b>The court 
reaffirms the reasonableness of a secondary screening</b><br>
<i><br>

Additionally, Gilmore was free to decline both options and use a different mode 
of transportation.<br>
</i><b><br>
<br>
Gilmore had options, he had to decline 
BOTH options before being refused.<br>
<br>
With the new order, we have no 
options. Unless this is all a farce.<i></i></b><i><br>
<br>
In sum, by 
requiring Gilmore to comply with the identification policy, Defendants did not 
violate<br>
his right to travel.</i><br>
<br>
<b>The ID policy in place at the 
time of Gilmore was, show ID or get a secondary screening. This new policy does 
not allow those simple options.<br>
<br>
Denial of access is now PUNITIVE in 
nature due to the fact the passenger is required to genuflect in order to be 
allowed a secondary screening instead of the presentation of an ID.<br>
<br>

Lack of options and a punitive nature makes the new ID order a burden that 
unduly restricts travel.<br>
<br>
Gilmore was very specific in the scope of the 
ruling. Under the old ID requirement, Gilmore lost. Under the new ID 
requirement I am not so sure he would.</b><br>
<br>
Whew I bet it took as long 
for me to mark that up as it did for them to write it.<br>
<br>
What we need to 
happen is someone will have to be a test case for this new requirement. I would 
do it but I lack cash for a legal team. The test case needs to happen where air 
travel is the only real choice of travel. Someplace like Hawaii or Alaska.<br>

<br>If anyone wants to pony up the dough, I could use a Hawaiian or Alaskan 
vacation.<br>

<p>Honestly.<br>
<br>
First of all, I'd like to show my appreciation for 
making a blog entry about this. That's a kudos on your part.<br>
<br>
This 
policy really bothers me, however... why waste people's time by interviewing 
them if they forgot their ID? While the old policy (just SSSS'ing them, giving 
them a pat down) is admittedly pretty easy and non-intrusive, it's what makes 
sense. People won't appreciate being interviewed by police if they forgot their 
ID - they'll feel like they did something wrong. That gives way to a police 
state feeling, which is unAmerican.<br>
<br>
I understand your ID checking 
revune needs...however, why don't you have the airlines do it? It's their 
responsibilty, not yours. This just creates an additional, unnecessary dragnet 
and will consume people's time...all for nothing. The key to airport security 
is that someone doesn't have dangerous items on them. Simple as that. Let true, 
centuries-old intelligence agencies (FBI, NSA) do the work.<br>
<br>
This is a 
true cornerstone of mission creep...and I don't like it. While the liquid 
policy is stupid, pointless, and silly, it's somewhat reasonable compared to 
this ID policy, especially for domestic travel. You're responsible for ensuring 
the safety of people flying on planes--and safety means physical items. I think 
others have said it all.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind this will greatly inconvenience 
people, but especially those who are Deaf, mute, has religious beliefs, and 
those who are autistic.<br>
<br>
I've always tried to respect your side, 
TSA...but in this instance, you've gone too far, creating a &quot;papers 
please&quot; environment (even though it may not be intentional), and it's not 
necesssary nor is it American. Nix the interviews and give us our pat downs, 
but keep it at that.<br>
<br>
I hope you'll at least take my suggestion in 
consideration, since I'm a mere citizen... but take it from me, you guys are 
going too far this time.<br>

<p>The TSA should continue to allow refusal to show ID without enhanced 
visible screening. This way the TSA could launch an emergency secret 
investigation of anyone who doesn't show ID.<br>
<br>
So lets say as soon as I 
came up to a ID checkpoint with &quot;No ID&quot; written on my boarding pass, 
the officer would immediately contact his supervisor. That supervisor would 
then start dispatching undercover officers and investigators. So while the 
undercover officers observe me as I walk through the airport, investigators 
would be pulling up video of me from airport cameras and as much other 
information that they could find.<br>
<br>
This gives authorities the chance to 
discover I'm actually a terrorist and have me attested without me knowing that 
they were investigating me the whole time.</p>

<p>Big fat meh on this entry. Your response to the constitutional right to 
travel freely within the U.S (ID or no ID) is: &quot;Too bad for you, legal 
eagle. By the way, we don't have a secret agenda.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, whether 
that is true or not, you are still contributing to a climate of oppression. The 
more rights that are taken away from average people, the worse things will get. 
A compliant and docile populace isn't in anyone's best interest! (Except maybe 
the government's) Also, when do you stop making up new rules and restrictions? 
At what point is the process &quot;good enough&quot; or can we count on the 
rules getting more and more byzantine and nonsensical with each passing year?
<br><br>
Meanwhile, I find it curious that you don't address the fact that the 
ID check is essentially useless if the terrorist does have valid ID. I hate to 
break it to you, but there are plenty of terrorists out there that aren't on 
any no-fly list, and if they were getting on a plane, there would be nothing 
stopping them from using their own perfectly valid ID. At that point, we're 
back to the detection of dangerous items in baggage. THAT is where you should 
be concentrating your efforts. Not on more useless rules that punish free 
thought and civil disobedience.<br>
<br>
If I were you, I'd be taking a good 
long look at some of our concerns about the dumping of hazmat in open trash 
cans in public areas. That and the fact that no one is allowed to see the 
&quot;G-Rated&quot; MMW images. If they're so innocent, put them out in public. 
(Have the screens viewable by the people in line at the checkpoint) Frankly 
asking me to trust that those low-res images that were put up are what the 
screeners see is asking a lot. Why should I believe anything I read on this PR

Sounds a bit like your situation. 
<br><br>
I asked him a few questions in regard to how he flew - without 
exception, he was flying on business, as is the case for most of the travelers 
that leave out of Huntsville. I asked him if his company got the travel 
arrangements themselves, or contracted it out to someone else. He told me that 
a third-party arranged the travel plans, and issued them to his company.<br>

<br>The next question cinched it as far as I was concerned. I asked him how far 
in advance did they make the travel arrangements.<br>
<br>
Turns out, the 
third-party that handled all of the company's travel arrangements typically 
made said arrangements within twenty-four hours of the flight.<br>
<br>
There 
was no 'false positive' on any watch list. The third-party company that handled 
his travel arrangements fit, 100% of the time, into the CAPPS profile for what 
it desigates as selectees.<br>

Would you want someone sitting next to you that is wanted for murder and armed 
robbery? You don't need a knife or gun to kill someone as someone with the 
desire can do so with a pen. We are screening for weapons as well as those 
intending evil to the plane and/or passengers and crew of the plane. It's not 
just about weapons folks.<br>
<br>
If you have never watched the reality tv 
program airline I'd advise you to do so. The airlines deny boarding to drunk 
passengers all the time. Those people can't bring down the plane by being drunk 
on the plane, but they can and often do disrupt the flight, the airport 
environment, the other passengers, and everyone around them. Because of this 
they are a danger to the flight and are denied boarding. The TSA doesn't become 
involved unless the behavior is shown in the checkpoint, but it's not just what 
you are carrying but who you are and how you behave that matters when traveling 
by air.</p>

<p>To just change the name on the boarding pass and have an ID match that

<p>I've always defended TSA against it's more rabid critics. Frankly, most of 
it's critics are ill informed and just plain wrong. Now though? I can no longer 
defend TSA. If not unconstitutional, it is at a minimum unenforceable and 
stupid. TSA already lost a similar case once, why try again? I hope the next

TSA has never done ANYTHING to 
improve airport security. Every American knows this, and so does TSA, and so do 
the poor wretches tasked to lie to the American public via this blog. This ID 
policy is rank nonsense, up there with 3.4-1-1, since it presumes that no 
terrorist is capable of saying, &quot;I lost my ID.&quot;<br>

<p>When the TSO checking my ID can properly recognize my ID as being valid 
without asking me what it is, I will recognize them as being properly trained 
and deserving of respect. Until then, their skills are unsatisfactory and I 
shall notify their supervisors of the need for retraining. At the same time, I 
will not berate them for being members of the American Stasi or similar, for 
they are just trying to do their poorly defined job.<br>
<br>
When the TSO 
looking at my bags via an X-ray machine can recognize the difference between a 
flash drive and a knife, I will recognize them as being properly trained and 
deserving of respect. Until then, they are playing with equipment they don't 
know how to use and their supervisors shall notified of the need for 
retraining. I will not be a smart*ss and hand the TSO the printed copy of the 
x-ray machines operator manual.<br>
<br>
When the TSO that checks my bags by 
hand can properly unpack, inspect and repack the equipment I carry, or is smart 
enough to ask me how to do it, I will thank them, recognize them as being 
properly trained and of being deserving of respect. Until then, they will be 
politely instructed on how not to break things. If they do not accept 
instruction, I will immediately request to speak to their supervisor without 
getting out of line or attempting to repack my bags.<br>
<br>
When the TSO I 
encounter is courteous, polite, and professional in behavior, I will recognize 
them as being deserving of respect. Until then, they are but costume-wearers 
looking for a free donut. I will pity them, but I will not berate them, for 
they are unaware of how poorly they fit their job description.<br>
<br>
When 
every TSO is well trained, and knows how to do their job properly, I fully 
expect that the TSA will immediately change all the rules for some poorly 
thought out and undefined 'security reason.'</p>

<p>Dear hsvtso Dean,<br>
<br>
Thank you for the information regarding possible 
reasons for haraSSSSment (love the term). I do not fit in: made all 
reservations myself, well in advance, round trips. I also do not have looks or 
a name that could be considered &quot;suspicious&quot; (whatever that is). 
Probability laws point out to my being on a watch list (ridiculous, since I 
have absolutely no connection that could be regarded as remotely 
&quot;worrisome&quot;).<br>
<br>
Besides that, I still do not understand how 
getting a boarding pass marked SSSS then being allowed to wonder freely within 
the airport before subjecting to haraSSSSment improves security.</p>

<br>Gilmore had the option of leaving.<br>
<br>
Gilmore wasn't required to 
provide ID to a federal employee. He only had to present it to an airline 
employee/contractor.<br>
<br>
Gilmore had the option of taking an SSSS if he 
chose not to present ID.<br>

Gilmore can not possess a drivers license for

<p>&quot;Starting June 21, that person could be subjected to a range of 
options, including interviews with behavior detection officers, local and/or 
federal law enforcement, enhanced pat-downs or other options. By increasing our 
options, people with bad intentions don&rsquo;t know what exactly to plan 
against, have to beat multiple layers at the checkpoint and need to be ready to 
face any number of obstacles to their plans.&quot;<br>

This is beyond

thousands and thousands of citizens guilty of absolutely nothing more than 
forgetting their wallet or having their purse stolen on a business trip. All

but assuming you meant something like, &quot;Why are you people so opposed to 
the idea of security guards and government agents demanding that people present 
ID upon demand?&quot;: Because what is being established is a government 
checkpoint at which we are required to identify ourselves and wait for 
permission to proceed. It is a restriction of our right to travel, and thus of

No, I don't think so. 
If someone is a known terrorist, I doubt he's going to walk into a government 
office to request an ID. Do you think so?<br>
<br>
This might make it a little 
bit harder for them to get a fake ID, but matter how much technology we put

&quot;steal&quot; someone else's identity and get a card with his picture and

<p>Maybe this ID rule is a make-work program for the BDOs: If they can pick 
out liars on the ID issue they can score more 'wins' in their job performance 
statistics.<br>
<br>
TSA is full of pointy-haired management geniuses: Actual 
enforcement of this new rule might increase their sham terrorist detection 
metrics, but as Bruce Schneier noted, it is all about control:&quot;That's 
right; people who refuse to show ID on principle will not be allowed to fly, 
but people who claim to have lost their ID will. I feel well-protected against 
terrorists who can't lie.&quot;<br>
<br>
And according to Daniel Solove, it may 
be an example of first amendment discrimination:&quot;Although the First 
Amendment doesn't restrict the TSA from requiring IDs in order to board an 
airplane, it does restrict using the ID requirement to penalize people who 
engage in expressive conduct. Because the TSA requirement seems to be targeted 
to this kind of expressive conduct (hence the exception for lost or stolen 
IDs), it may run afoul of the First Amendment.&quot;<br>
<br>
As for your 
&quot;By increasing our options, people with bad intentions don&rsquo;t know 
what exactly to plan against,&quot; justification, you really do seem to be 
going for the Keystone-Cops terrorist detection plan. What is next? Will you

IS losing essential liberties.<br>
<br>
Our Founding Fathers felt that the 
right travel was such an undeniable RIGHT, and the courts have agreed to this 
point, that is was not necessary to include it as part of the Constitution.<br>

<br>Just in case you think this important issue just &quot;slipped their 
minds&quot; the right to travel between the States has been a Right since the 
Articles of Confederation, the first Constitution, that created the United 
States of America.<br>
The Articles of Confederation<br>
<br>
Article IV. <i>
The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the 
people of the different States in this Union,<b>the free inhabitants of each of 
these States</b>, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted, <b>
shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens</b> in the 
several States; and<b>the people of each State shall free ingress and regress 
to and from any other State</b>, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of 
trade and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions, and restrictions 
as the inhabitants thereof respectively, provided that such restrictions shall 
not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any 
State, to any other State, of which the owner is an inhabitant; provided also 
that no imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid by any State, on the 
property of the United States, or either of them.</i><br>
<br>
If foundation 
documents are not enough to convince you of the right to travel validity maybe 
the latest legal brick will. From the Gilmore vs. Gonzales (previously Ashcroft)
<br><br>
<i>Although we recognized the fundamental right to interstate travel, 
we also acknowledged that &ldquo;burdens on a single mode of transportation do 
not implicate the right to interstate travel.&rdquo; Id. at 1205 (citing<br>

Monarch Travel Servs., Inc. v. Associated Cultural Clubs,<br>
Inc., 466 F.2d 
552, 554 (9th Cir. 1972)).<br>
<br>
[12] Like the plaintiff in Miller, Gilmore 
does not possess a fundamental right to travel by airplane even though it is 
the most convenient mode of travel for him. Moreover, the identification<br>

policy&rsquo;s &ldquo;burden&rdquo; is not unreasonable.<br>
<br>
See Shapiro v.
<br>Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629 (1969) (noting the right of all citizens to be 
&ldquo;free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited 
by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this 
movement&rdquo;), overruled in<br>
part on other grounds by Edelman v. Jordan, 
415 U.S. 651,<br>
670-71 (1974).<br>
<br>
The identification policy requires 
that airline passengers either present identification or be subjected to a more 
extensive search. The more extensive search is similar to searches that we have 
determined were reasonable and<br>
&ldquo;consistent with a full recognition of 
appellant&rsquo;s constitutional right to travel.&rdquo; United States v. 
Davis, 482 F.2d 893, 912-13 (9th Cir. 1973).</i><br>
<br>
Hopefully you will 
notice above what the TSA is refusing to acknowledge. Even though the above 
ruling strengthened the<b>reasonableness</b> of having the OPTION to show ID <b>
OR</b> submitting to a secondary screen, it DID NOT weaken the right of all 
citizens to be &ldquo;free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our 
land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden 
or restrict this movement.<br>
<br>
Before you go &quot;ah ha&quot;, the single 
mode of transportation denied Miller was his DRIVING a vehicle because he 
refused to give his SS number to the DMV. Mr. Miller is still free to ride in a 
car, bus, train, or plane. I don't know about you but all I want to do is ride 
the plane, not drive it.<br>
<br>
Just in case you are curious about the 
MONARCH TRAVEL SERVICES v. ASSOCIATED CULTURAL CLUBS case cited;<br>
<br>
<i>
<br>ACCI was in the transportation business thinly disguised as a club. The 
district court correctly decided that it was an indirect carrier.<br>
<br>
ACCI 
argues that the statutes and regulations it violated are unconstitutional 
restrictions on the right to travel because not everyone can afford to pay the 
higher fares on regular flights to Europe. No unconstitutional restraints on 
anyone's right to travel is imposed by the challenged statutes and regulations. 
The persons regulated are carriers. Of course, higher air tariffs will limit 
travel of those who cannot pay the price.<b>A rich man can choose to drive a 
limousine; a poor man may have to walk. The poor man's lack of choice in his 
mode of travel may be unfortunate, but it is not unconstitutional.</b></i><br>

<br>I think we can all agree to the last part. I don't think anybody wants to 
ride a Welfare Airline.<br>
<br>
In summary, the TSA has no right to demand an 
ID and restrict the travel of free citizens that refuse to capitulate.<br>
<br>

Trying to use the case law they have admitted to as the basis for their new 
found foolishness, would be like me arguing the use of a take a penny, leave a 
penny cup at the convenience store gives me permission to stick my hand in the 
till.<br>
<br>
I know if I tried to stick my hand in the till, Ali or Muhammad 
would make sure I pulled back a nub. That is what will happen to the TSA if 
they continue to push this unconstitutional restriction of travel. Either the 
courts or the legislators will be sure the long arm of the TSA is shortened.<br>
<br>Before anybody gets all bunched up, yes the names of the guys that work the 
convenience store by my house are really named Ali and Muhammad. They are 
originally from Bangladesh and are here for the freedom and opportunity. Nice 
guys but try to steal from them and they take it personally.<br>
<br>
When the 
TSA or ANY Government agency tries to steal my liberty, or my rights, I take it 
personally.</p>

<br>
No, making sure that passengers aren't carrying 
anything which is a threat to the aircraft is as basic as security gets - and 
it's what you're SUPPOSED to be doing, and according to your latest published

at everyone's driver's licenses now, too, just in case you weren't already

[TSA blog guy]Christopher said: &quot;Instead of allowing 
anyone without an ID to show up, go through a quick pat down and bag check,

Do you REALLY need us to 
throw the BS flag on this, Christopher? You *AREN'T* checking the No-Fly list 
(an odious concept in and of itself in which someone too innocent to arrest is 
too dangerous to fly, and which contains numerous children while deliberately 
excluding known terrorists. Yeah, way to go there, guys...). You're comparing 
the boarding pass to the ID, both of which are being handed to you by the 
passenger you're allegedly checking. Others have pointed out how ludicrously 
easy it is to defeat this so-called &quot;security check&quot;, so I see no 
need to elaborate further.<br>
<br>
[TSA blog guy]Christopher said: &quot;You

Yes, I 
do mean that, and if *YOU* don't as well, then you REALLY ought to pull your 
head out. If they don't have the &quot;pointy objects&quot;, in your terms, 
THEY CAN'T HARM THE AIRCRAFT. And again, you aren't doing all that well just 
looking for THOSE things. Adding still more unnecessary distractions can only 
further endanger the aircraft and passengers.<br>
<br>
Oh well - at least your 
disgusting unConstitutional efforts are discouraging ever-larger numbers of 
passengers from flying, so there are fewer people to suffer the results of your 
failures.<br>
<br>
[TSA blog guy]Christopher said: &quot;Actually, it&rsquo;s 
an effort to keep people that pose a threat to aviation off airplanes and keep 
you, your family and mine safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
By destroying fundamental 
rights? YOU are the threat, far more than some mad-bomber terrorist. Stick to 
actually looking for THINGS which can threaten the safety of the aircraft, and 
come back and talk to us again after you can consistently get an exemplary

<p>While I believe that the integrity of travel documents is vital, when I 
handed my European passport containing a US visa to a trained document checker

Yes we are. If a terrorist has no

who he is? It's time that our government stops throwing law abiding citizens

At New York Kennedy

attempting to enter into a security checkpoint with a fraudulent ID.<br>
<br>
A 
TSA Travel Document Checker noticed a passenger trying to use a fraudulent New

who came and interviewed her. The Port Authority Police Department released the

the TSA's idea of a 'big catch' worthy of a blog update on the weekend???<br>

<br>BTW-I noticed there was no mention of the role, if any, the TSA's SPOTniks 
played in this 'big catch'; were they off for the weekend or did someone skip 
one of Kip's security layers?<br>
<br>
As has been pointed out previously, both 
on this thread as well as others, if those on the TSA's assorted 'watch lists' 
are so dangerous, they should be arrested, charged, &amp; tried in a court of 
law.</p>

Did this person carry any contraband that

<p>Why is I.D important for security?<br>
<br>
It's not. And if you guys at 
the TSA don't see the logical fallacies in your ID policy, you really ought not 
to be in charge of anyone's safety.<br>
<br>
There are altogether too many TSA 
rules that just totally defy common sense. Your agency is, judging from the 
available evidence, clumsy and slow to act, totally unable to balance safety 
and customer service, in a PR free fall you've been trying (and failing) to get 
out of since your inception due to your numerous public screwups. Your 
ground-level staff are uneducated and poorly paid, and when they're not making 
up rules on the spot they're improperly and inconsistently enforcing the ones 
that do exist. And there are newer and stupider rules being created all the 
time.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, this blog, created to foster dialog between us and 
you is just another venue for you guys to show how poorly you understand the 
business you're in. You ignore valid questions, post meaningless PR drivel, and 
insult us by spinning your screwups as triumphs.<br>
<br>
I haven't flown into 
or out of the states for about a year now, and I'm not going to fly again until 
at least the moronic 3-1-1 rules are rescinded or you stop dumping our 
dangerous and explosive shampoo in public trash bins.<br>
<br>
Listen, liquids 
are hazmat or they're not, you need to publicly show the MMW screens, teach 
your staff some manners and common sense (and lose the faux-cop uniforms), and 
for god's sake stop making up newer and dumber policies and start examining 
your weaknesses honestly. I a lot more afraid of having my rights violated by 
some ego-inflated TSO than I am about my plane being hijacked.</p>

<br>
TSA's job 
is to ensure transportation safety, not to catch criminals. Setting up a 
checkpoint at airports to stop everyone just to find the few criminals is 
un-American, and probably unconstitutional.<br>
<br>
Our courts have 
established that people in this country have the right to travel and associate 
without being monitored or stopped by the government unless they have been 
convicted of committing a crime or are suspected -- with good reason -- of 
having committed a crime. They have ruled that we cannot set up roadblocks and 
checkpoints to stop everyone who passes just to catch the few who have done 
something wrong, or to find the few who are suspected of intending to do 
something wrong.<br>
<br>
This is really simple: If someone is so dangerous 
that he shouldn't be allowed to travel within the country, we should send the 
police to arrest that person and get him in front of a judge -- not wait for 
him to show up at an airport, then hassle him or turn him away. If he's not 
believed to be of sufficient danger to have him arrested, then we should let 
him go about his business.<br>
<br>
It is not the duty of the TSA or any other 
part of the Executive Branch to judge guilt and impose punishment. Those are 
reserved for the Judicial Branch.</p>

<p>In your blog, you indicate the exclusive reason is to ensure people are who 
they say they are and not gaming the system using a boarding pass with a fake 
name. Unless TSA boarding pass/ID checkers at the security checkpoint are tied 
in to the no-fly list, the system can still be gamed, in the same manner as 
originally publicized by the graduate student who authored the DIY boarding 
pass website.<br>
<br>
Let's say I am an evil-doer named John Badman, and I 
have a state driver's license issued under that name, and I am on the no-fly 
list. Now I buy a ticket with a fake name such as John Cleanname which is not 
on the no-fly list. Prior to my flight, I check-in online, and print the 
boarding pass for John Cleanname. Then I fake up my boarding pass and change 
the passenger name from John Cleanname to John Badman.<br>
<br>
At the security 
checkpoint, I present my fake boarding pass, and my authentic, government 
issued ID for John Badman. My ID matches my boarding pass, and the TSA agent 
would wave me through. Unless the TSA agent is able to clear my ID against the 
no-fly list at that point, the system does not work as intended. On one hand, 
it is true that TSA with its visual inspection of ID and boarding pass has 
corectly verified that I am indeed who I claim to be (John Badman), on the 
other hand, the TSA agent has no idea that John Badman is someone who shouldn't 
be allowed to fly.<br>
<br>
Later, when I get to the gate, I present to the 
gate staff my real boarding pass issued to John Cleanname so that my boarding 
pass matches their passenger manifest. One might argue that the gate staff 
should do a secondary match to make sure that I have and ID that matches the 
boarding pass, which in turn matches their passenger manifest. That in turn can 
be defeated by determined evil-doers by the production of a fake ID with a 
matching name. To counter this, DHS must then escalate and put all airline gate 
staff through the same law enforcement/TSA training to spot fake credentials.
<br><br>
If TSA is indeed intent on solving this loophole, the security 
checkpoint must be tied-in to the no-fly list and the airline reservation 
system.<br>
<br>
Learn from what other countries have done. In several foreing 
airports, there is an initial security screening done at the beginning of the 
secure zone as it is currently done in US airports. Secondarily, there is 
another comprehensive security screening at what's called the gate-hold area. 
Every passenger is screened twice: once to get into the secure area of the 
airport, another time to get into the specific waiting lounge for the gate.</p>

First of all, 
Chertoff doesn't have time to know &quot;the depth of the threat&quot;. He and 
Hawley have demonstrated absolutely zero desire to arrive at that 
understanding. If they did, the entire DHS would look entirely different and 
the TSA would not exist.<br>

<br>
Wow, just 
wow.<br>
<br>
Michael Chertoff's mother was a stewardess at El Al, his father 
was a Rabbi, and he was a prosecutor.<br>
<br>
How does that make Michael 
Chertoff uniquely qualified to be the security expert beyond reproach, a person 
so in tune with the threats that face this country that not even the agencies 
under his control should be questioned? It doesn't.<br>
<br>
If the agencies 
under his control are any indication of the man, he is poorly qualified for the 
task at hand. Let's look at just two of them.<br>
<br>
FEMA, an agency under 
the control of Michael Chertoff, absolutely FAILED during Katrina's aftermath. 
The agency was unable to do the simple task of moving supplies from point A to 
point B.<br>
<br>
TSA, an agency under the control of Michael Chertoff, 
absolutely FAILS at its given task. Cargo is still unsecured, screeners FAIL to 
find test bombs 70% of the time, and theft of passenger items run rampant.<br>

<br>Now the TSA, in an unconstitutional and un-American move, REQUIRES my 
federally approved Government issued ID in order to travel.<br>
<br>
Maybe the 
fact that Michael Chertoff is an Israeli citizen makes the idea of presenting 
travel papers appealing to him. Maybe he envisions 
&#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1501; being set up not only at the borders but in 
random areas. You know we must keep the Palestinians.... er I mean the 
Terrorists under control.<br>
<br>
This is NOT Israel, an by God it will not be 
Israel if I have anything to say about it.</p>

Note that the new TSA rule that 
will become effective June 21, 2008, does not require potential airline 
passengers to present credentials (i.e., to &quot;show ID&quot;); that will 
still be optional, and will still help people avoid a more thorough secondary 
screening. The new rule<i>will</i> require passengers not to be honest about 
any intention to travel without checking in with the federal government. Those 
of us who wish to do so will need to convince agents at government checkpoints 
that our credentials were simply misplaced, not withheld on principle.<br>
<br>

<i>&quot;Instead, the TSA should focus on improving the search for dangerous

I agree.<br>
<br>

<br>
Generally, yes, 
although many things can be used as a weapon (e.g., a plastic knife, a door 
handle torn from the lavatory, or bare hands) by anyone who wishes to use them 
as such. But restricting travel -- based on the opinion of someone who guesses 
that a particular traveler might want to do harm, or based on the anonymous 
opinion of the some maintainer of a blacklist -- is just plain wrong.<br>
<br>

Requiring us to request and receive permission to travel within our own country 
does nothing to improve our safety, although TSA repeatedly states without 
explanation that it does. Punishing us for asserting our rights, as TSA has 
stated intent to do beginning four days from now (making crystal clear that 
this is no longer about ensuring safety, but about exerting control), just 
sends us further down the path towards life under a totalitarian regime. It's 
good for those who want to maintain control over the public and bad for 
everyone else.<br>
<br>
This country was founded by people who were previously 
living under a government that abused its power. Let's not set ourselves up for 
more of that which many of our ancestors fought to escape simply becuase some 
of us were sofrightened by a horrendous crime (one that clearly could have been 
avoided) that they have since sat by idly while our Constitution is being 
subverted in the name of keeping us safe from anoverblown threat that is likely 
to be no more dangerous to the average person than wasCommunism during the Cold 
War.</p>

<p>So, after 9/11 I had to remove all my pointy objects that used to be OK.<br>
<br>Then some idiot failed to hurt anybody and I had to take off my shoes.<br>

<br>Then they turned up the sensitivity on those devices and even my belt 
buckle set off the metal detector, so now I have to take off my belt. (And the 
answer to your next question is &quot;No, I don't have one of those 
ostentatious belt buckles.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Then they got word from the British 
that our beverages are threats to security, so we all had to reduce the liquids 
that we carry on. (I remember the previous time that the British tried to foist 
rules on us in regard to tea...)<br>
<br>
Now I not only have to show my ID, I 
have to remove it from the clear plastic carrier in my wallet.<br>
<br>
Every 
year they add another rule. The undercover inspectors continue to get guns and 
explosives past the TSA, but every year my hassle increases.<br>

If I'm 
not polite at the checkpoint, perhaps it's because you guys keep increasing the

<p>Checking IDs to try to find terrorists is useless because of the low number 
of terrorists, and the false positive rate of using ID checks as a proxy for 
terrorist intent.<br>
<br>
In the updated post, you tout finding another 
non-terrorist as a 'success': &quot;The Port Authority Police Department 
released the passenger after issuing a Summons to Appear.&quot; If you are 
trying to catch terrorists, this is another<b>*false alarm*</b>.<br>
<br>
If 
this is your best example of how document checking keeps us safe, TSA is 
hopeless.<br>
<br>
Suppose 1 false ID per 3 days is normal, and your document 
checkers found a hundred 'sucesses' like this one during the last year. Then 
100 times out of 100 a document checking success lead to no terrorists being 
caught. By this, odds of someone that TSA catches by fake ID being an actual 
terrorist is less than 1% and the odds that TSA is wasting time is nearly 100%. 
And on the miniscule chance that TSA actually does notice a real terrorist with 
one of these checks, they will likely treat them the same way as they do with 
the other 99.9999% of false positives.<br>
<br>
The low rate of terrorism, and 
the false positives that TSA touts so loudly make it clear that TSA is huge 
waste.<br>
<br>
Try working through this page with terrorism as cancer, 
2,000,000 people per day, and any TSA &quot;detection&quot; program you can 
think of.<br>
<br>
If we were truly serious about transportation safety, we 
would be better off putting all the TSA personnel to work fixing bridges and 
roads: A 10% improvement in road safety would save4200 lives per year</p>

<br>
I haven't forgotten 9/11. I 
also choose not to let the terrorists win by giving our our way of life and 
cowering in fear of them. Security is one thing. What TSA isn't doing is 
security, it's fear mongering.<br>
<br>
If you, sir, choose to buy into that, I 
can't help you.<br>
<br>
<i>Did you people forget that there are terrorist out 
there who are desperate to destroy our country and kill the American people?</i>
<br><br>
One could successfully argue that this is what our government is doing 
already. We could argue that with the war on terror that we've spilled more 
American blood and wasted more money than the terrorists have cost us. We've 
wasted more money and life standing in these ridiculous lines and being subject 
to TSA's stupidity than we lost on 9/11.<br>
<br>
We are destroying our country 
from the inside by constantly trading freedom for &quot;security.&quot; Ben 
Franklin is attriubuted to saying &quot;They who would give up an essential 
liberty for temporary security, deserve neither liberty or security.&quot; So 
with Kippie's latest ID farce, he's essentially trying to quash dissidence. If 
you forget your ID, you're ok. If you dare to stand up for your rights, you 
will not fly. This isn't freedom. It's communism.<br>
<br>
We're doing exactly 
what the terrorists hoped to do: destroy America. No, they knew they could 
never take us on in military might, but they knew they could get us to implode 
from the inside. Even Abraham Lincoln said that's how American would destroy 
itself ... from the inside. And that's exactly what we're doing with every 
stupid thing TSA and DHS require now. Osama's probably laughing his tail off in 
his cave.<br>
<br>
Even J. Edgar Hoover said in his study of communism that 
that communist governments require internal passports for traveling. What's 
happening now?<br>
<br>
I was at the Holocaust Museum a few weeks ago and in 
&quot;Daniel's Story&quot;, the boy told about how they needed papers to do 
anything and were subject to inspection of those papers and goods at any time. 
They couldn't travel freely. I couldn't help but see how the exact same thing 
is happening in this country today. And people like you are letting it happen 
and in fact welcoming it! Wake up!<br>
<br>
America used to be the land of the 
free and the home of the brave. We're less free than we used to be and we're 
certainly not brave anymore.<br>
<br>
<i>This is just another form of security 
to protect all of YOU! from this happening.</i><br>
<br>
And please tell me how 
these ID checks are keeping us safe. The TSO doesn't compare it against the no 
fly list. The no fly list doesn't contain names of the most dangerous 
terrorists because the government doesn't want to tip them off that we're on to 
them. The no fly list inconveniences thousands of people everyday even ones 
with common names like Robert Johnson, David Nelson, and so forth and does 
nothing to prevent a terrorist to get on a plane.<br>
<br>
Please tell me how 
it succeeds in keeping us safe? People already have debunked that myth on here 
so I'm not going into it again.<br>
<br>
I'll give you a hint: TSA has to trot 
success of busting college kids with fake ID's to look like it's doing 
something. If this were really stopping terrorists, wouldn't they be catching 
them?<br>
<br>
<i>So be grateful, is it so hard to be at the airport a couple 
hours early, and go through extra measures of security to ensure YOUR FAMILIES 
SAFETY!!.</i><br>
<br>
Yes, it's hard. It's hard because all the extra hassle 
is show and does nothing to enhance security! And arguably, TSA is making us 
LESS safe by focusing on fake ID's, shampoo and toothpaste and letting things 
like bombs and guns thru.<br>
<br>
<i>If we started letting anyone through and 
the terrorist attacked, then you would blame the security for not doing their 
job.</i><br>
<br>
No one is saying that we shouldn't have security. That's a 
straw man and a sign of a weak argument.<br>
<br>
Guess what? When the 
terrorists attack again, I will hold TSA accountable. I will hold them 
accountable for wasting billions of dollars and time, subjecting us to all this 
crap and it not making a lick of difference. Security didn't fail on 9/11. It 
was cooperating with the hijackers and letting them take control of the 
cockpits that caused it. Those holes have been closed.<br>
<br>
<i>So eather 
way the security at the Airport are darned if they do and darned if they do not 
by people like all of you.</i><br>
<br>
TSA wouldn't (or shouldn't) be held to 
account if they actually did security right. Unfortunately, they're going to be 
scapegoats no matter what because when something happens again, Congress will 
get up in arms about it. I'd rather have TSA be able to throw in Congress's 
face that they did security RIGHT with risk based policies and there was 
nothing they could have done to prevent it rather than put on the dog and pony 
show that they do now to try to put on the illusion of security when the facts 
show that our checkpoints leak like a sieve and other vulnerabilities are left 
wide open.</p>

safety. They are actively drifting their mission while not doing a good job of 
their primary mission. They are working on PR blogs and new uniforms with shiny 
badges while not checking air cargo. They are triple checking boarding passes 
and confiscating water from passengers while some people with airside access 
receive limited checks.<br>

Nothing that happened on 9/11 as to screening

detained, referred to LEO for arrest, or detected since their inception? Clue

<br>
I have two theories 
about this myself.<br>
<br>
<b>Theory #1:</b><br>
<br>
This caused by one thing 
being added while another thing wasn't taken away in our operating procedures.
<br><br>
Ergo, a hypothetical scenario:<br>
<br>
On the first day, we're told 
to verify the presence of the boarding pass when the passenger comes through 
the walk-through metal detector.<br>
<br>
On the second day, we're told to take 
over the travel document checking role previously held by contracted airline 
personnel. We're told to do this, without the procedures from the first day 
being rescinded.<br>
<br>
On the third day, we're still checking the boarding 
pass at both locations.<br>
<br>
On the fourth day, we're still checking the 
boarding pass at both locations.<br>
<br>
Ad nauseum.<br>
<br>
You get the idea.
<br><br>
<b>Theory #2:</b><br>
It could also be intentional on grounds of 
redundancy. If, for example, the TDC checker missed that they were a selectee, 
then the TSO at the WTMD could catch it.</p>

<p>I don't see the big problem here. If you really need to get to where you 
are flying to, just follow the rules and regulations. I work at LAX and 
passengers always act surprised like they don't know the process. When you buy 
your ticket it saids go to whatever website and read the rules, but people 
don't take time out to read them for whatever reason. I say if you don't like 
the process then maybe you should drive. It's passengers that don't wanna go 
with the flow that miss their flights and then have the nerve to blame TSO's 
like myself. I don't make the rules, but I have to follow them just like every 
one else. STOP complaining because people easily forget about what happened on 
9/11 and after that tragic event.</p>

You don't make the

foreign and domestic. The TSA has become the domestic enemy. Will you uphold 
your oath? Or was the oath just empty words to you?</p>

<p>I do not see how the requirement to show valid ID that proves that the 
person holding the boarding pass is the person able to fly on the ticket makes 
TSA the enemy. ID's have been checked since the TSA took over and people 
without boarding passes couldn't go through. Now that rule has just been more 
thoroughly enforced to prevent gaming the system. It's not against the 
constitution to require ID or it wouldn't have been allowed all this time 
folks. If it's unconstitutional it would have been struck down oh so long ago.

<br>
Before June 21st, 2008 the ID check was NOT a 
requirement to be granted access to a sterile area.<br>
<br>
If a citizen 
refused to show ID they were given a secondary screening, something that the 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals stated in the Gilmore decision was Constitutional.
<br><br>
Under the new rule showing ID IS a requirement to be granted access to 
the sterile area. In the Gilmore case the court ruled Gilmore's rights were not 
violated because Gilmore had the OPTION of a secondary screening. The TSA has 
removed that option in not only an unconstitutional move but a blatantly 
illegal move based on the limits in 49 C.F.R. &sect; 1540.</p>

<br>
This confusion stems from the unfortunate misuse of &quot;ID&quot;. ID stands 
for identification.<b>Identification is a <i>process</i></b> -- the process of 
identifying someone, of determining his or her identity. The cards we typically 
refer to as &quot;IDs&quot; are not an identifications (which doesn't even make 
sense), they are credentials -- things that are used in the process of 
identification.<br>
<br>
What TSA is really asking us to do is to present our 
credentials so that they can identify us. Prior to June 21, 2008, passengers 
were required neither to present credentials nor to assist government agents at 
the checkpoint with determining identity of the passengers. Now, passengers are 
still not required to present credentials, but are required to assist with 
identification.<br>
<br>
And of course, the troublesome part is that we are not 
allowed to pass this checkpoint without identifying ourselves in a manner that 
is acceptable to the government agents there, then waiting for permission to 
proceed. I fear that if we accept this at airports, we'll soon be accepting it 
elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<b>Many Americans thought we'd never see the day that, like 
people living in cold-war USSR and under other totalitarian regimes, we would 
be stopped by government agents at a checkpoint and required to identify 
ourselves &amp; get permission to proceed.</b> Unfortunately, many younger 
Americans have been so conditioned to presenting credentials (usually a driver 
license) to private parties that they fail to see the risk of being required to 
do so in order to pass government checkpoints.<br>

<p>On a recent flight, my husband and I went through security separately. Upon 
meeting up at the gate, we realized that we each had gone through security with 
the others boarding pass. The TSA screeners did not notice that the ID 
presented did not match the names on the boarding passes! Anyone could have 
picked up my identification and gone through security as me! The TSA can come 
with a million new requirements/guidelines/restrictions, but I will not feel 
more secure until I have confidence in the TSA and its agents</p>

<p>I don't know what the big fuss is about adding extra security. Everyone in 
America thinks this is a big deal, and that oh my gosh.... our rights are being 
taken away. Everybody just relax please. Let these people do their jobs. 
Sometimes implementing new policies and procedures helps them figure out what 
is working and what is not, so they can make better changes in the future. So 
lets hold them to high standards, but give them a chance to do their jobs.</p>

<p>Apparently you haven't read much of the discussion here. No one is 
complaining about &quot;adding extra security&quot;. We're complaining about 
adding intrusive procedures that add little or no security.<br>
<br>
No where 
in this post did Bob explain<i>how</i> an ID check enhances security.<br>
<br>

SeeBruce Schneier's August 28, 2008, <i>Los Angeles Times</i> op-ed, &quot;The 
TSA's useless photo ID rules&quot; for more.<br>
<br>
In it, Schneier writes:
<br><br>
<i>&quot;Anyone on the no-fly list can easily fly whenever he wants. 
Even worse, the whole concept of matching passenger names against a list of bad 
guys has negligible security value.<br>
<br>
&quot;How to fly, even if you are 
on the no-fly list: Buy a ticket in some innocent person's name. At home, 
before your flight, check in online and print out your boarding pass. Then, 
save that web page as a PDF and use Adobe Acrobat to change the name on the 
boarding pass to your own. Print it again. At the airport, use the fake 
boarding pass and your valid ID to get through security. At the gate, use the 
real boarding pass in the fake name to board your flight.<br>
<br>
&quot;The 
problem is that it is unverified passenger names that get checked against the 
no-fly list. At security checkpoints, the TSA just matches IDs to whatever is 
printed on the boarding passes. The airline checks boarding passes against 
tickets when people board the plane. But because no one checks ticketed names 
against IDs, the security breaks down.<br>
<br>
&quot;This vulnerability isn't 
new. It isn't even subtle. I first wrote about it in 2006. I asked Kip Hawley, 
who runs the TSA, about it in 2007. Today, any terrorist smart enough to Google 
&quot;print your own boarding pass&quot; can bypass the no-fly list.<br>
<br>

&quot;This gaping security hole would bother me more if the very idea of a 
no-fly list weren't so ineffective. The system is based on the faulty notion 
that the feds have this master list of terrorists, and all we have to do is 
keep the people on the list off the planes.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's just not 
true. The no-fly list -- a list of people so dangerous they are not allowed to 
fly yet so innocent we can't arrest them -- and the less dangerous &quot;watch 
list&quot; contain a combined 1 million names representing the identities and 
aliases of an estimated 400,000 people. There aren't that many terrorists out 
there; if there were, we would be feeling their effects.<br>
<br>
&quot;Almost 
all of the people stopped by the no-fly list are false positives. It catches 
innocents such as Ted Kennedy, whose name is similar to someone's on the list, 
and Islam Yusuf (formerly Cat Stevens), who was on the list but no one knew why.
<br><br>
&quot;The no-fly list is a Kafkaesque nightmare for the thousands of 
innocent Americans who are harassed and detained every time they fly. Put on 
the list by unidentified government officials, they can't get off. They can't 
challenge the TSA about their status or prove their innocence. (The U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals decided this month that no-fly passengers can sue the 
FBI, but that strategy hasn't been tried yet.) &quot;</i></p>

<br>Good try... The Freedom Center is not even in Arlington. Anybody who has

license to her new surname. I made trip reservations for the family using her

deficiencies and inconveniences, it is still the safest system we have ever had.
