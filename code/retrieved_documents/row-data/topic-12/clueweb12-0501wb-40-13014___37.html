<p> </p> <br>

<p>Not long ago, my wife and I went from Vancouver to Ottawa on Via Rail. The 
three-day first stage of our journey was on Via's Silver and Blue service: 
individual roomettes, superb food, and endless hours in a dome car. The second 
stage, from Toronto to Ottawa, was on a regular train taking four hours.</p> 
<p>I'd taken short train trips before -- in Canada, the U.S., and China -- but 
nothing this long. Yes, the romance of the rails was a factor: the last spike, 
Gordon Lightfoot, even<em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>. How many British 
films and TV shows take place on trains? How many of our ancestors rode swaying 
across the Prairies to take possession of their own quarter section?</p> 
<p>Compounding that romantic feeling was an anxious sense that flying can't 
last. A generation has grown up accustomed to cheap airfares and frequent 
flights. But our sudden understanding of global warming has made us more than 
nervous. Jet after jet dumps greenhouse gases at 38,000 feet -- the equivalent 
of what each passenger might emit in a year of routine highway driving.</p> 
<p>George Monbiot, in his book Heat, confesses he can find no solution for air 
travel as a contributor to global warming. Other transportation systems can 
reduce their emissions, but airliners are locked into burning kerosene at high 
altitudes. At least one airline, Ryanair, reports a slowdown in ticket sales 
thanks tomedia condemnation of low-cost air travel as an environmental problem.
</p> 
<p><strong>Train travel nostalgia trip?</strong></p> 
<p>So could we go back to train travel for business trips, tourism, and family 
reunions? Could we hand air travel over to the minorities: the very rich, the 
very powerful, and the military?</p> <br>

<p>It wouldn't be easy. According to a StatsCan survey of domestic travel, 
Canadians made 175.1 million person-trips in 2004. Of those, 160.8 million were 
by car, 7 million were by plane, 4.6 million were by bus, and only 1.3 million 
were by train. (Train trips that year jumped by 17 per cent over 2003.)</p> 
<p>What's more, government policies since the 1970s have deliberately 
discouraged train travel. Both Liberal and Conservative governments have cut 
subsidies for passenger trains. According to Wikipedia, 80 per cent of our 
current train travel is in the Windsor-Quebec City corridor. Via Rail's #2 
train, the one we took, runs just a couple of times a week, carrying no more 
passengers than an average Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Toronto.</p> 
<p>Via's passengers, rich or poor, need patience. You can ride fairly cheaply, 
and miserably, by sitting up day and night in &quot;comfort class.&quot; Or you 
can sit in an open compartment during the day and sleep in a berth at night. 
Or, as we did, you can sleep in a fairly comfortable roomette with your own 
toilet, sink, and door.</p> 
<p><strong>Freight trains outrank passengers</strong></p> 
<p>Whatever class you travel in, you soon realize that every freight train 
outranks you. The #2 slows down or stops several times a day to let freights go 
by. It's exciting, at first, to sit on a siding as the freight cars whiz by 
just a metre or so away. Then it's just noisy and boring.</p> 
<p>Living in a rolling hotel, passengers soon focus on mealtimes, and the 
meals are very good. But depending on when you're booked for a sitting, you may 
eat lunch at 11:00 or dinner at 8:00. Once fed, the berth passengers retreat to 
their seats for naps; the Silver and Blue passengers go to the dome or back to 
their roomettes. Some people use the activity car to play cards or bingo. On 
our trip, many of the passengers ignored the scenery and talked about other 
places they'd traveled.</p> 
<p>To run a similar service for double or triple the number of passengers 
would require an enormous investment in infrastructure: double- and 
triple-tracking, more trains, more stops, split-second scheduling. Costs would 
have to come down dramatically, requiring a dramatic boost in subsidies.</p> 
<p>Moreover, passengers would have to change their attitudes and expectations. 
Most of today's train travellers are affluent seniors, in no rush to get 
anywhere. They travel for pleasure, not for urgent business or family matters.
</p> 
<p>Most air travelers, by contrast, would go crazy on a long-distance train. 
They're used to being cramped in an aluminum tube for a few hours, maybe with a 
video screen on the seat back in front of them. It's not as comfortable as the 
train, but it's brief. The idea of taking three days and nights just to attend 
a wedding or graduation, or a business meeting, would seem intolerable by 
comparison.</p> 
<p><strong>An airliner on wheels</strong></p> 
<p>The second stage of our trip was sharply different from the #2. The train 
from Toronto to Ottawa was, in effect, an airliner on rails.</p> 
<p>Seats were extremely comfortable, even more than the seats in our 
roomettes. We could stow our luggage in either a special section at the front 
of the car, or in an overhead compartment. Snacks and drinks were available 
from carts pushed down the aisle. We'd brought our own lunch, and used 
airline-style pull-down tables.</p> 
<p>Equally important, this train was fast. We stopped at a few stations along 
the way, but most of the time we rolled through the Ontario countryside at well 
over 100 km/h. So I can see why 80 percent of Canada's train traffic is in this 
Windsor-Quebec City corridor. Destinations are close, and you can generally go 
from downtown to downtown. It's actually cheaper, in money and time, to take 
the train than to fight traffic out to an airport, park, get on the plane, and 
then reverse the process at your destination. The same is almost true of 
cross-Canada train travel. Maybe you'd save a couple of hundred dollars if you 
drove, but it would be a costly saving. To drive from Vancouver to Toronto in 
three days would be impossible. You'd have to stop for meals, for sleep, for 
gas. Food, fuel and accommodations would all cost plenty. And you'd arrive 
exhausted and stressed.</p> 
<p><strong>When air travel is not an option</strong></p> 
<p>It seems likely that at some point air travel will cease to be an option 
for most of us, unlessdirigibles make an unexpected comeback. Whether for long 
or short trips, we will have to travel by surface transport. Maybe it will be 
buses, moving in huge convoys down Highway 1. Maybe it will be hybrid cars, 
with computers keeping them at a safe distance from one another. But it could 
be trains.</p> 
<p>Imagine a train like the Toronto-Ottawa shuttle, but with even better 
seating -- like that in airline business class, able to stretch into something 
like a bed. Imagine the train running on a dedicated track from Vancouver to 
Kelowna to Revelstoke and then to Calgary and points east.</p> 
<p>Some trains would make scheduled stops along the way. Others would rocket 
from Vancouver to Calgary, then to Regina or Saskatoon, then to Winnipeg, and 
on to Toronto. Long-distance travelers could sleep in their seats, watch video 
or go online, and enjoy simple but tasty food.</p> 
<p>Passengers would need to consider their journey as important as their 
destination -- an opportunity for fun, relaxation, and socializing. They would 
certainly be pleasanter than the aluminum tube that brought me home to 
Vancouver from Ottawa in five cramped hours.</p>

<h3>Rail vs Air</h3> 
<p>The last time I traveled Via Rail the leg through the rockies was at night! 
This was so that the timing into Winnipeg would be at about dinner time. Via 
gets a big fat ZERO for tourist viewing the best scenery. I was certainly 
unimpressed with the seas of grain all day long across the prairies so that I 
could just glimpse the rockies at sunset.</p> 
<p>The time factor for Air will still trump that for Rail for a very long time.
</p> 
<p>The wide-open spaces in Canada will not likely be covered in 'bullet 
trains'. More likely are coal fired throwbacks that crawl along at a snails 
pace. Creature comforts? Not likely, you are just as likely to see a greyhound 
bus equivalent cattle car stuck between the grain cars, with grease and coal 
smoke smeared windows, no food or water and no stops for 5 hours.</p> 
<p>The cost factor will be what puts air travel back into the 'jet setters' 
again and leaves the rest with either puddle jumping (in normally aspirated 
engines like Cessna-152's) or accepting the time delay and riding the rails. It 
may take another 20 years but the price of fuel will kill mass air travel in 
the end, and put it only in the hands of the 'jet setting' rich.</p> 
<p>The reality that regular cargo gets priority over passengers should come as 
no surprise, the cargo was paid for long ago and regularly and there is no 
passenger rail service anywhere any time that was not subsidised by cargo 
shipments.</p> </li>

<h3>It's not long haul trains we should be planning for...........</h3> 
<p>it is medium to short haul trips. since the early 90's AMTRAK has been 
running TALGO pendular (tilt) trains from Vancouver to Seattle and Seattle to 
Portland. Because the trains 'tilt', they are able to take curves faster and 
because they have a lower centre of gravity, they are more stable.</p> 
<p>Until this year, BC reneged on a promise for track improvements to increase 
capacity (red herring) to allow a second train up to Vancouver instead of it 
terminating in Bellingham.</p> 
<p>Such short haul trips could include Vancouver to Whistler; Calgary to 
Edmonton; Medium haul trips (over night) Vancouver to Kelowna; Vancouver to 
Calgary; etc.</p> 
<p>By using tilt trains, one can decrease journey times by up to 40%. We are 
not talking TGV or bullet trains here, but proven technology, increasing 
passenger trains performance, without staggering costs.</p> 
<p>If one wants to see real improvements to our rail system, ban bureaucrats 
and politicians from flying and force them onto the rails.</p> </li>

<h3>A lot of business travel isn't necessary</h3> 
<p>Something everyone forgets with &quot;business meetings&quot; is that a lot 
of them aren't strictly necessary. Yes, it's nice to be able to meet face to 
face every so often, but for routine meetings and conferences technology</p> 
<p>I work for a software company and all our training and long-distance 
meetings are conducted via video or phone conferencing and screen sharing. It's 
extremely effective and also saves the company immense amounts in travel time 
and costs. I can see traveling to something like a conference or a yearly or 
quarterly meet-and-greet, but F2F isn't always necessary for everything. I know 
there's the old argument about &quot;people need face time&quot;, and this is 
true to an extent...but not when you balance it against global warming and the 
fact that we are rapidly running out of oil.</p> </li>

<h3>Costs more</h3> 
<p>If you check Via Rail ticket prices (SuperSaver) versus discount airlines, 
they are usually higher. Higher classes of service also cost more.</p> 
<p>If one assume's that trains are more fuel efficient, it's tough to get over 
paying more to get there slower, while saving fuel.</p> 
<p>Also take into account the trains don't run daily, and your scheduling 
flexibility is toast.</p> 
<p>A Greyhound bus costs half the price and is faster, with daily service.</p>

<h3>New era-Ethical choices or......?</h3> 
<p>It is not the question whether to travel by train or not but whether to 
travel at all.</p> 
<p>Our so called vacations have become earth destroying missions. We have 
driven, flown, cruised without a thought of what it is doing to the planet 
because after all &quot;we deserve a vacation!&quot;.</p> 
<p>Even environmentalists fly and or travel to meetings and conferences! </p> 
<p>Travel for business can be handled by the technology available.</p> 
<p>I have decided not to fly or take vacations anymore due to envionmental 
concerns. I park my car for months and walk or take transit whenever possible. 
I only have a car 'cause out here the local bus stops at 8 p. m.</p> 
<p>I heard a theologian on the radio and he stated thst plane travel is now 
&quot;a sin&quot;.<br>
 Although i'm not religious- he is right.</p> 
<p>Call it a sin or reckless or just plain stupid-the days of hopping on a 
plane or driving for thousands of kms. have to come to a &quot;crashing&quot; 
stop.</p> 
<p>We cannot save the planet without changing our habits. Stay home, go for a 
walk and the next time your group, politcal party or friends feel the need to 
hold a gathering that requires travel-speak up...how necessary is it? Don't go 
and try to persuade others to do the same.</p> </li>

<h3>My Favourite Mode of Travel</h3> 
<p>Train is by far my favourite mode of travel. When I was working in Korea

<p>However, both countries have one thing in common: small land area and large

<p>Train travel requires huge infrastructure compared to air travel and with a

<h3>Maglev in evacuated tunnels</h3> 
<p>Crawford, I'm surprised at you. A sci-fi guy like yourself should be able 
to come up with something better than dirigibles. One of my favorite 
illustrated book series as a little kid was about future technologies. One of 
the technologies the books on travel mentioned were Maglev trains in the near 
frictionless environment of evacuated tubes. You could get speeds of close to 
5000 kmph, all powered by electricity, at a tiny fraction of the energy 
required by jet aircraft. However, you'd be talking enormous initial 
infrastructure costs. You can check out the ideas behind the technology at the 
following links.</p> 
<p>One is under development in Switzerland:<br>

<p>A website about the technology:<br>
http://www.et3.com/index.html</p> 
<p>A rather technical discussion of the technology:<br>

http://faculty.washington.edu/jbs/itrans/suppes.htm</p> 
<p>If we really do start to have serious shortages of oil, a transport 
technology like this may become vital. Although I really like the ideal of 
dirigibles for certain types of short haul cargo transport, and for cruise air 
liners. Imagine floating over the Rockies in the warm comfort of a dirigible.

<p></p> 
<p>Think of the population denisty versus North America. The only place that 
high speed electric rail could possiblybe profitable in North America would be 
from New York to Washington DC. Western Europe has 300m people alone. There are 
100m between Tokyo and Osaka. South Korea is the size of Vancouver Island and 
has 45m people.</p> 
<p>Even at an average speed of 200 km/h it would take 25 hours to reach 
Toronto from Vancouver and the cost of laying and maintaining the track would 
be astronomical considering it would have to be laid across the Rockies and the 
Canadian Shield.</p> </li>

<h3>High-Speed Rail</h3> 
<p>Because high-speed rail is so fast, it can cover often cover its operating 
costs or even make an operating profit. Less employee time per trip and each 
train can make more runs.</p> 
<p>Really need to build new tracks though. On many corridors in North America, 
the tracks are nearing capacity with all the freight being shipped around so 
there is not the track time to run much passenger rail effectively. Hopefully 
even more will be shipped by rail to get rid of some of the trucks on the road.
</p> 
<p>California is seriously considering high-speed rail from San Diego to 
Sacramento. Unfortunately, in spite of his recent &quot;greening&quot;, he 
wants to spend money on road expansion instead of high-speed rail and transit. 
He is pushing the Hydrogen Hypeway as his solution. What a joke. Unfortunately, 
Gordo feel for it.</p> 
<p>Here, it is time to start looking at a line from Vancouver to Portland so 
we are really when peak oil happens. It could eventually be connected to the 
California Line.</p> 
<p>Florida would have had high-speed rail by now if it was not for Jeb Bush. 
They actually had written high-speed rail into the state constitution but Jeb 
ran a misinformation campaign to get it voted out.</p> </li>

<p></p> 
<p>Yes. I know. I've ridden it twice now. An amazing trip.</p> 
<p>Some people aren't in a hurry to get from A to B and are willing to pay a 
premium for great food and great views. Sounds like a plug, but I don't work

<p>No doubt their Whistler run will be as profitable. That money could have 
been going into public coffers instead of private, but Kevin Falcon botched 
that file too.</p> 
<p>Regarding population density, I think it's safe to assume Canada's will 
rise. It would be nice to plan ahead for a change. Total cost accounting of the 
current system with its attendant costs for deaths, enforcement, etc makes 
highway travel more expensive than it appears IMO.</p> 
<p>Air travel is a luxury the planet can ill afford anymore. We need to adjust 
our thinking instead of off-loading the problems onto our children (as usual).

<h3>Density-Schmensity</h3> 
<p>Canada's population density is highly concentrated on a narrow east-west 
axis such that trans-national rail only requires one or two rail beds to 
connect the major cities in each provice.</p> 
<p>If it was feasible to do it once, it should be feasible to do it again.</p> 
<p>Measure the money spent on air travel between Candian cities, it would 
easily support high speed passenger rail.</p> 
<p>But, it would be too slow compared to air travel, so it would fail. </p>

<p>In fact, there's no limit to the amount of gasoline a Canadian can burn, is 
there? Ever see a gas pump that had a limit?</p>

<h3>Did it fall or was it pushed</h3> 
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy</p> 
<p>Whatever one believes of the destruction of urban rail systems - Los 
Angeles's system of old is a favorite of conspiracy theorists - there is little 
doubt, in my mind, that the passenger rail systems across this continent were 
&quot;sabotaged&quot; as an aid to build an airline industry.</p> 
<p>We are now paying the heavy environmental costs. A most important 
consideration is that, coupled with the production of &quot;green&quot; 
electricity, affordable electrified, passenger rail systems would add 
tremendous improvement to our air quality.</p> </li>

<p></p> 
<p>Not necessarily so. Given today's airport hassles and the need to show 
oneself considerably before flight departure, and getting to and from airports 
usually quite distanced from the city centres one is destined for. On the 
shorter trips, I don't doubt the train traveller would reach his/her 
destination ahead of the flying passenger.</p> 
<p>In any event, it will be worth it for many to arrive more relaxed and less 
white-knuckled - even though a trip may take longer.</p> 
<p>The important thing is that this affordable, cleaner option is there.</p>

<h3>High-speed rail seems to</h3> 
<p>High-speed rail seems to work well in Europe, including areas where you 
might not think. Finland's high-speed link between Kupio and Helsinki (500 km) 
serves a sparse population of less than a million, but nevertheless manages to 
run 5 times a day - 7 hours by car, mostly in the dark, or 3 1/2 hours by 
train. Your choice.</p> 
<p>Germany's high-speed has been limited by the low number of grade-separated 
tracks for the ICE - many still share lines with freight and local service, 
forcing the ICE to run at 160 kmh on many runs, so Deutsche Bahn committed a 
year or so ago to spending $7 billion Euros in the next 4-5 years to double the 
number of high-speed grade-separated lines to 6000 km.</p> 
<p>I rode the service Frankfurt to Berlin a couple of years back - 4 hours 
portal to portal, sorting my documents and pictures on the laptop with a glass 
of German beer at my elbow all the way. The only thing is the view isn't as 
exciting as from a plane - at 250 kmh the scenery flashes past so fast you get 
nauseous watching, or else you're in a trench or tunnel.</p> 
<p>London to Nice in 6 hours. Brussels to St. Petersburg in 14 hours. Milan to 
Krakow in 7 hours. Europe's tied its future to rail and it seems to work all 
right. What lessons can we learn?</p> 
<p>jwstewart's right - with Canada's orientation east-west, a double-tracked 
rail corridor to link up with the Windsor-Quebec City corridor would serve the 
vast majority of the population with spur lines to other cities. 8000 km of new 
track would equal a whole new opportunity for entrepreneurs to provide service 
to the population. Never mind the airlines - they're the new dinosaurs.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, a return to rail travel would also require the mandatory 
subsidies that currently exist for air and road travel be eliminated. Road 
travel especially only pays about $5 billion in gas, consumption and road taxes 
annually, but is funded nationally and provincially to the tune of more than 
$16 billion across the country. And that's not even counting the municipal road 
networks in each city or town which rail travel would not eliminate.</p> </li>

<h3>I too really enjoyed VIA and AMTRAK</h3> 
<p>Like Crawford, I too have taken some lengthy rail journeys lately, and 
enjoyed them a great deal. I went too and from Winnipeg (2 nights), sleeping in 
coach, this spring, and down to Oakland in a roomette. It was most pleasant, 
and it slowed me down - which at the time is what I needed. I flew back from 
Oakland and of course had to go through the whole security thing - give up a 
bottle of lotion (it was more than 3 oz.), take off my shoes, submit to all the 
indignities and cramped quarters of airline travel. I think I'll take the train 
whenever I can. The bus is okay, too, but you can't get up and wander around 
and go to the lounge or dining car. For me, airplane travel now is definitely 
my last choice. And I can feel good about perhaps doing less damage to the 
environment, though I agree with Southdeltawalker that the real solution is to 
cut our motorized travel as much as we can (walking and cycling I think are 
okay).</p> </li>

<h3>Quote:Passengers would need</h3> 
<p> </p>  Quote: <br>

<blockquote> Passengers would need to consider their journey as important as 
their destination -- an opportunity for fun, relaxation, and socializing. They 
would certainly be pleasanter than the aluminum tube that brought me home to 
Vancouver from Ottawa in five cramped hours.</blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>The last part of Kilian's piece is the only faulty part that I can find.</p>
<p>Via is unpopular largely because it cannot divide recreational travel from 
utilitarian, (or business or necessary) travel. It is either unwilling, or has 
no model, or makes more money at freight than passenger or whatever, but the 
needs of the recreational traveller - about whom Kilian waxes so philosophic 
above - are completely different than the utilitarian traveller.</p> 
<p>In the immortal words of William P. Lear &quot;After 5 hours, wall-to-wall 
girls are no substitute for getting there.&quot; Which is why business 
executives with sense bought his jets instead of the competition's. His jets 
were slimmed-down, efficient, un-luxurious modes of transport that would go 600 
MPH to cross the continent in 5 hours. Everyone else was stuck in leather 
seats, bars and girly-movies in 350 MPH pigs that anaesthetized their occupants 
for the 9 hour flight required to cross the same distance. No surprise that 
most of those jet-manufacturers eventually went bankrupt. Tycoons of industry 
are not normally known for being slow on the uptake.</p> 
<p>So why is Via so slow? R'man, W'man, IAMC and Jane Doe might have a lot of 
thoughts, but I'm considering mostly its the tax system. Rail pays full freight 
- no subsidies any more, while other transportation modes get subsidies. 
Therefore, there's more consistency, hence more money in freight. Thus, freight 
gets the right-of-way, while passenger gets the siding.</p> 
<p>If someone wants to start up a high-speed rail commuter service, I'll buy a 
few shares. It won't be easy, I'll guarantee you. But it will be profitable, 
and all it needs is some of our much-vaunted entrepreneurs to step up to the 
plate and take the chance, instead of forcing government into the role. I'll be 
happy to put in a few thousand into shares for a good business plan.....</p> 
<p>.....knowing all the while it could fail, like my friend's high-speed 
catamaran service from Vancouver to Sechelt....</p> </li>

<h3>Keeping our hand in</h3> 
<p>I am glad we have rail travel for a number of reasons.</p> 
<p>First, it is so much more pleasant than air travel. You aren't crammed into 
a tiny space, you are not bullied by security people, you don't have your time 
wasted by needing to be at your departure point two hours early, you get fresh 
air, you can walk around all you want, your ears don't pop unless you climb a 
mountain, you see the scenery, you have fewer Type A (rude, rushed, pushy) 
fellow passengers around you, you can use your cell phone... but you know all 
that.</p> 
<p>Second, if your engine dies, your train simply stops.</p> 
<p>Third, as long as we are running passenger service, we remember something 
about how to do it. I think we agree that at some point, air travel will simply 
not be reasonable. Oil will be too scarce or too expensive, and you can't run a 
plane on electricity, as you can a train. That point in time may be far in the 
future, but if we arrive at that point having kept our hand in the passenger 
train business, we'll be better off for it.</p> </li>
