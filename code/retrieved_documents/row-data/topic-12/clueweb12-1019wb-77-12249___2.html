<h1>Are greener planes an acceptable compromise?</h1>  20 Jun 2007 | Author:

<p>Check in here for lower emissions</p> 
<p>While aviation retains its bad-boy image, at least one airline is dealing 
with the public&#146;s concerns about climate change</p>  It seems like an odd 
concept in the face of the UK&#146;s current anti-flying hysteria, but picking 
the most environmentally friendly airline could be a way for consumers to 
engage with climate change while governments wrestle with tougher questions.<br>
<br>Flybe, a UK airline, says is has now invested more than $2 billion in 
&#147;environmentally sensitive&#148; aircraft. By 2009, they say, they will 
have one of the most environmentally friendly aircraft fleets in the world.<br>

<br>Campaigners will be up in arms about this. Newer groups like the articulate 
and direct action focused Plane Stupid organisation have already been on 
television news complaining about a recent report from an airline pilots union.
<br> <br>
<b>Rail&#146;s halo slips&#133;</b> <br>
<br>
The British Airline 
Pilots Association claims that for flights over 500 kilometres, new planes 
perform as well as trains.<br>
<br>
Plane Stupid retorts that airline emissions 
are two to four times more harmful to the environment at altitude, and that 
most flights are less than 500 kilometres in Europe anyway, making the train a 
better option.<br>
<br>
Flybe says their &#147;ecolabel&#148; initiative for 
their new planes is &#147;designed to help consumers identify which type of 
aircraft or which type of route is the most sensitive choice to the 
environment&#148;.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Effective insulation in homes would get 
bigger gains, quicker, than fighting flying&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The airline is 
also going to buy carbon offsets via PURE, a non-profit carbon offsetter. 
Passengers will opt in to pay for these.<br>
<br>
Flybe&#146;s self created 
eco-labelling scheme will be audited by Deloitte, and will provide passengers 
with &#147;detailed but user-friendly breakdown of the fuel consumption, carbon 
emissions and noise patterns of the aircraft type to be used on their 
journey&#148;.<br>
<br>
The scheme will allow passengers to assess the 
environmental impact of their journey. Passengers, the airline says, &#147;will 
then be in a position to decide, on an informed basis, whether they want to 
carbon-offset that journey&#148;.<br>
<br>
<b>Flying: a reality</b> <br>
<br>

Flybe pitches its new planes as scoring &#147;an impressive B rating for CO2 
emissions&#148;.<br>
<br>
It is hard to know if that&#146;s impressive or not. 
However, in a low margin industry, where trade publications still refer to 
environmental &#147;myths&#148;, such as climate change, this seems to signify 
leadership.<br>
<br>
For some environmentalists, flying will now never be 
socially acceptable. For everyone else, it will continue to be a reality for 
longer distances.<br>
<br>
Governments and companies appear to be hoping that 
if we can get emissions down elsewhere, that will have to make up for it. Even 
Kyoto excludes it. Carbon offsetters too, will probably do well out of it in 
the coming years, although there is bound to be a shake out in the market over 
time.<br>
<br>
Given that effective insulation in homes would get bigger gains, 
quicker, than fighting flying, perhaps its time for the &#147;insulation action 
group&#148; to be formed.<br>
<br>
Water, transport, food, heating, and power 
are all going to be affected by climate change and its change agenda. The 
action by governments right now is focusing on the easy wins: pressuring 
business, for example, or pushing product carbon labelling.<br>
<br>
But soon 
much harder questions, like fuel prices and their impact on behaviour will need 
addressing if the 70 or 80% cuts in carbon currently suggested are anything 
like realistic. <br>
