<h1>Myth Busted: Better to drive than fly? It depends!</h1> 25 Aug/11 <br>

<p>We asked the question: <strong>Is it better to drive than to fly for 
business or vacation travel?</strong> Surprisingly, the answer may be NO. Or 
more accurately, IT DEPENDS.</p> 
<p>This was an interesting and challenging question because of the number of 
variables involved. The answer depends on the length of your journey, how full 
the plane is, whether you&rsquo;re driving solo or carpooling, and many more 
factors!</p> 
<p>One of the more recent and detailed analyses I came across done by 
Sightline Institute actually found that the worst way to travel (for the 
planet) was by driving solo. This applied whether the vehicle you were driving 
was an SUV or an average car. The best transportation choices in this study 
were to hop on a bus, take a train, or to carpool with 2 other passengers.</p> 
<p>An earlier report from the IPCC shows the complexity of variables at play. 
In this analysis, it makes a big difference whether you&rsquo;re taking a short 
haul or long haul flight, and whether you&rsquo;re driving a truck to your 
destination or a small car.</p> 
<p><strong>Financially</strong>, your best choice will again be influenced by 
a variety of factors, especially where you are heading. When calculating your 
driving costs, don&rsquo;t forget to factor in higher gas prices in other 
provinces (CAA quotes an average of 130c/L nationally), wear and tear on your 
vehicle (budget about 5c/km for the average vehicle), and meals and hotels. For 
flights, don&rsquo;t forget to include the cost of taxis or buses to and from 
the airport (city buses are a very inexpensive option).</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re planning on taking a train or bus, keep an eye on upcoming 
or last minute sales. Consider joining mailing lists to catch deals early.</p> 
<p>Some of the best options for work travel or family vacations can also be 
close to home. Teleconferencing, &ldquo;Skyping&rdquo; and webinars are all 
great options for businesses looking to cut their carbon and their budget. And 
some of the most relaxing vacations I have been on have been right here in 
Manitoba.</p> 
<p>What are some of your favorite ways to travel carbon (and dollar)-light?</p>

<p>One factor I don&rsquo;t see mentioned which may affect the analysis of 
flying is whether you are taking a direct flight. Do the calculated numbers 
assume equal distance traveled using all modes of transportation? Connecting 
flights are sure to increase the carbon footprint of flying. If I want to fly 
from Winnipeg to Denver the carbon footprint will be significantly different 
whether I take a direct flight vs. connecting thru Minneapolis, Chicago, 
Calgary, etc.</p> </li>

<p>Minor question: what is the above referenced gas mileage in, Imperial or US 
gallons?</p> </li>

<p>Anyone want to guess the carbon footprint of Canadian generals taking 
holidays in their private jets?</p> </li>

<p>Great comments! I couldn&rsquo;t take a close look at the factors involved 
in the evaluation done by Sightline Institute. In the second case, the figures 
given from IPCC seem to suggest you would need to consider each leg of your 
flight journey separately as short, medium or long haul, and then add these 
together for an idea of your trip&rsquo;s total impact.</p> 
<p>Looking at Peter&rsquo;s question, I assume the first evaluation is in US 
gallons, as the organization is based in the U.S. The IPCC evaluation and later 
CAA quotes are in metric.</p> </li> </ol>

<h5>Thompson&rsquo;s Bruce Krentz shares his 365 days of cycling experience
</h5>
<p>I won&rsquo;t even begin to pretend that cycling 365 days a year is for 
everyone, but it could certainly be for more people. Committing to riding 
absolutely every day is for only a &ldquo;special&rdquo; few, and I almost made 
it. &ndash; Bruce Krentz</p> </li>
