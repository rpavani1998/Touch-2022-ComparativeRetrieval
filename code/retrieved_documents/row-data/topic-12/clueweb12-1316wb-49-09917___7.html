<ul> 
<li>By 2020, passengers will be able to arrive at their destinations faster by 
high-speed rail than by plane on nearly half of the densest European air routes.
<br></li> 
<li>One-third to one-half of European travelers would like to switch to 
another means of transportation.<br>
</li> 
<li>Both airlines and railways could win far more passengers by focusing on 
automobile travelers&mdash;30 percent of whom would prefer to travel by air or 
rail&mdash;than by trying to steal market share from each other.<br>
</li> 
<li>There is room for only a few cross-border operators&mdash;success requires 
a differentiated offering for new consumer segments along with smooth 
implementation.</li> </ul>  &nbsp; 
<p><em>The Boston Consulting Group has conducted the first pan-European study 
of the travel market, surveying 13,000 consumers from 13 countries on the means 
of transportation they use, why and how they use them, their preferences for 
one mode of travel over another, and their perceptions of the brands of 43 
passenger-transportation operators, including long-distance rail carriers, 
traditional airlines, and low-cost airlines. The results of this survey provide 
further evidence that there is considerable opportunity in the European travel 
industry.</em></p> 
<p>Europe&rsquo;s travel sector has been evolving for some time, but the pace 
has accelerated as competition has intensified among modes of travel and across 
national borders. Railways and airlines are coming face-to-face with new 
challenges as deregulation and consolidation, combined with high-speed 
technologies and new business models, enable both rail and air travel to be fast
<em>and</em> low-cost. By 2020, passengers will be able to travel faster from 
point to point by high-speed rail than by plane on nearly half of 
Europe&rsquo;s densest air routes. Eurostar&rsquo;s continued dominance of the 
London-to-Brussels route demonstrates how effectively rail can capture share: 
Eurostar&rsquo;s market share on the route has climbed from 44 percent in 2002 
to 75 percent in 2008. Airlines are rising to the challenge: leading companies, 
such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, have established rail partnerships and 
codeshares to broaden their reach and provide better connections into their 
hubs. As a result, travelers will enjoy an unprecedented range of options among 
operators and modes of travel.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition to these changes on the supply side, powerful consumer trends 
are also driving competition across national borders and competitive barriers. 
Our study, which is the first to explore these trends, found, for example, that 
the travel preferences of European consumers&mdash;especially in the lucrative 
segment of business travel&mdash;no longer differ significantly from one 
country to another. This has created opportunities for travel operators to 
become pan-European. So far, however, only easyJet, Ryanair, and, to some 
extent, Eurostar have footprints outside their home markets, making them truly 
cross-border brands.</p> 
<p>As changes on both the supply side and the demand side take hold, railways 
and airlines will no longer be able to claim the captive customer base they 
once counted on. One of our study&rsquo;s major findings is that more than 30 
percent of consumers would like to switch travel modes, and in some countries 
the number is as high as 65 percent. Considering the size of the travel market, 
this presents a huge opportunity for the provider of the alternate mode of 
travel and an enormous threat to the incumbent. Furthermore, both rail and air 
providers have neglected the largest portion of the market: the automobile 
sector. In Germany and the United Kingdom, for example, more than twice as many 
long-distance trips are taken by car as by air and rail combined. More than 30 
percent of the drivers we surveyed said they would prefer to travel by air or 
rail.</p> 
<p>The potential for rail operators to attract airline passengers and vice 
versa pales when compared with the opportunity for both rail and air providers 
to lure passengers currently traveling by automobile. If only a small fraction 
of automobile travelers who would like to switch to either train or plane could 
find the right offering, airlines and railways could expand their markets 
considerably. Our study suggests that both airlines and railways could win far 
more passengers by focusing on that untapped opportunity than by trying to 
steal market share from each other.</p> <br>
