<p>Understanding the Void-of-Course Moon<br>
by Jenni Stone</p> 
<p>The Moon makes a complete circle through the twelve signs every 28.5 days 
and spends approximately 2.5 days in each sign.</p> 
<p>Some Moon signs are felt more acutely than others: In the sign of Aries, 
for instance, the energy is physical and sometimes angry, a dynamic force that 
can be used to tackle tasks and start projects; the Moon in Taurus is a more 
laid-back and sensual urge to enjoy fine dining and good music. As the Moon 
arrives in the sign of Gemini, the telephone starts ringing and the messages 
begin to pour in. There are, of course, other influences at work in the solar 
system, but the Moon is always playing &quot;background music&quot; that keeps 
us connected to the Earth and the stars.</p> 
<p>There is a time, however, when this connection is interrupted and we 
&quot;float&quot; between signs. This is the time we call the void-of-course 
Moon. It starts after the Moon has made its last major aspect (1) to the Sun or 
planets and is still within the sign, and the Moon is considered void of course 
until it enters the next sign.</p> 
<p>The Moon goes void of course every two days or so, and this can last 
anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. Sometimes, the Moon is void of 
course for two consecutive days; in August 2002, it lasted for almost three 
days when the Moon failed to make any aspects while in the sign of Cancer.</p> 
<p>There is a distinctive quality to the energy during a void-of-course Moon: 
Stores and restaurants are unusually quiet, judgment is impaired, and many 
people have a hard time making decisions. Business meetings can take a strange 
turn, and people find it difficult to work together as a group.</p> 
<p>Few astrology books mention this phenomenon, and there seems to be a lack 
of published information in this area. In an article about interpreting the 
void-of-course Moon in natal charts, Robert Hand quotes Julius Firmicus 
Maternus, a 4th-century Roman astrologer. &quot;If however the Moon is so 
positioned that she is carried toward nothing, nor is she joining herself to 
any star by a proper ray, and no benevolent star occupies the angles, it will 
make degraded paupers, and those who are destitute of all things that are 
necessary, and those for whom the things which are an aid to daily living are 
denied, and those who always require the support of strangers in order to 
sustain life.&quot; (2)</p> 
<p>These grim consequences appear to have been combined with the horary 
interpretation of a chart with a void-of-course Moon, which says that 
&quot;nothing will come of this.&quot; The conclusion is that action is 
unproductive during this time. Llewellyn&rsquo;s astrological calendar says 
that people are &quot;fuzzy &ndash; or vague &ndash; scattered even&quot; and 
that &quot;action initiated during this time is often wasted, irrelevant, or 
incorrect.&quot;</p> 
<p>However, this is not always so. Over the past two years, I have conducted 
research (3) with a group of friends who know nothing of astrology beyond their 
Sun-sign column in the local newspaper and are therefore not interested in 
either confirming or denying our current pet astrological theories.</p> 
<p>This is what we found, plus some suggested ways to plan ahead and use the 
void-of-course Moon in positive ways.</p> 
<p>1. Routine goes well, but take care when starting new projects.</p> 
<p>2. Organize and throw out the clutter: This is an opportunity to get rid of 
the piles of papers and junk that have been accumulating. Files may be 
reorganized, desks and closets cleaned out; it is easy during a void-of-course 
Moon to see what is needed and what should be discarded. With blockages 
cleared, the natural flow of harmony and balance is restored. When the Moon 
enters into the next sign, there is a noticeable &quot;sweetness&quot; to the 
space that is created.</p> 
<p>3. Spiritual disciplines like yoga or meditation take on a new dimension. 
Problems can be put on hold, and a state of inner peace is possible at these 
times. A luxurious timelessness pervades the senses. Music can be felt more 
deeply, and nuances of emotions are distinct.</p> 
<p>4. Edit and correct: Writers use this time to revise their work. New ways 
of expressing ideas can be found during this time.</p> 
<p>5. Take stock of your surroundings: Shortages, mistakes, and missing items 
are more noticeable during the void.</p> 
<p>6. Sleep: Lazy morning and afternoon naps are especially tranquil when the 
Moon is void of course, and the line between sleeping and waking is deliciously 
blurred. Lucid dreaming can be encouraged by instructing the mind to find 
answers through dreams.</p> 
<p>7. Relax and &quot;hang loose&quot;: Take time off to restore and replenish 
your internal batteries.</p> 
<p>8. Look ahead and be prepared: This can be a most productive time for 
making &quot;to do&quot; lists and reviewing the status of projects. It is easy 
to see what needs to be brought up to date during the void-of-course Moon. Much 
can be accomplished, and a profound sense of clarity and satisfaction is often 
experienced.</p> 
<p>9. Social events with friends can be giddy and intoxicatingly fun. Throw an 
impromptu party or a potluck dinner. Then add an element of surprise with games 
like charades or Scrabble where you make up the words and the rules. Do not 
serve food that takes too much preparation: Pick up some Kentucky Fried 
Chicken, and ask guests to bring cookies or a pint of their favorite ice cream 
for a taste test.</p> 
<p>10. Travel: The void-of-course Moon can be a good time to take a trip, if 
someone else is doing the driving. A journey by air, train, boat, or bus can be 
relaxing, and the time will pass easily. This is because the trip is routine to 
the bus driver or pilot and airline attendants.<br>
 During the three-day void 
in August 2002, I traveled via Virgin Atlantic to England. The plane was only 
half full, and the trip was trouble-free. The only challenge was the car ride 
to the airport. My driver did not speak English, and I didn&rsquo;t happen to 
speak his native language (Russian).</p> 
<p>11. Try something you&rsquo;ve never done before. It&rsquo;s not sensible 
to try rock climbing for the first time or to make a demo tape to launch your 
singing career, but it can be liberating to try a new activity when the Moon is 
void of course. A pioneering attitude in artistic pursuits brings results that 
range from groundbreaking to bizarre; intellectual and philosophical 
brainstorming can yield innovative ideas.</p> 
<p>12. The inner voice can be heard keenly now: Intuition is strong during 
this time. Inner reflection can be more profound, and inner conflicts can be 
resolved.</p> 
<p>What not to do during this time.</p> 
<p>1. Do not start important or life-changing projects during the 
void-of-course Moon: The outcome will not be what you want or expect. We all 
have undertakings that remain unfinished; this is just one of the causes. In 
Africa, I understand there is a tribe that buries women with all of their 
unfinished projects &ndash; and they would have to dig a mighty big hole for my 
grave.</p> 
<p>2. Try to avoid meeting new people: A first date or job interview should 
not be scheduled during the void. People you first meet while the Moon is void 
of course will not be who they appear to be; you tend to see them through 
rose-colored glasses, and this kind of euphoria doesn&rsquo;t last. 
Disappointment and frustration result when they (or you) don&rsquo;t live up to 
the image.</p> 
<p>I have personally tested this tenet many times. My own rule is this: If the 
other person suggests a time that is void for a first meeting, I will counter 
with a time of my choice, but if this person insists, then I will go ahead 
&ndash; while staying alert for setbacks and hindrances to a long-term 
relationship.</p> 
<p>One man (a prospective boyfriend) insisted on meeting for lunch when the 
Moon was void of course. He told me of his foot and shoe fetish, and I assumed 
that would be the extent of his weirdness. But on the third date, I learned 
that he was a &quot;recovering&quot; alcoholic. This became obvious when he 
soaked up three double scotches and peed on the floor.</p> 
<p>I have noticed that relationships started when the Moon is void of course 
usually end with telephones being slammed down.</p> 
<p>3. Do not start a new job when the Moon is void of course. My friend 
Rebecca called to tell me that she had no choice but to start her civil service 
position on a day when the Moon was void of course all day.</p> 
<p>&quot;What will happen?&quot; she questioned. &quot;I can&rsquo;t put it 
off, but I feel superstitious.&quot;</p> 
<p>I told her that her job would either turn out to be something other than 
what she expected, or she would leave in an unforeseen way. She called a couple 
of months later to say that she&rsquo;d be leaving her job before the year was 
out because, after three years of trying, she was finally pregnant!</p> 
<p>For the sake of research, I asked: &quot;Were you pregnant when you started 
the job?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>(This is not suggested as a means of getting pregnant!)</p> 
<p>4. Plans made during the void-of-course Moon do not turn out as expected: 
This can be used in a constructive way. Say, for example, that there is a 
luncheon you don&rsquo;t want to attend, a relative you don&rsquo;t want to 
meet, or an astrology reading you don&rsquo;t want to give. By making plans 
during a void-of-course Moon, it is sometimes possible to steer clear of these 
events.</p> 
<p>The only times this doesn&rsquo;t seem to work are during Mercury or Venus 
retrograde. Plans made during Mercury retrograde usually have to be revised 
anyway, and since Venus retrograde is a test of ethics and integrity, the truth 
is likely to be exposed and the outcome will not be to your advantage.</p> 
<p>5. Items bought during a void Moon do not fulfill their intended purpose. 
For more than 20 years, since first learning this rule, I&rsquo;ve avoided 
purchasing high-ticket items during this time. However, on one occasion when I 
needed a watch, I knew that the Moon was void of course, but I decided to make 
the purchase anyway. It was a $10 watch and, I told myself, what the hell if it 
fell apart after a couple of months? That cheap watch, however, kept perfect 
time for seven years! The band was replaced three times. Only when I dropped 
the watch and the glass cracked did I decide to throw it &ndash; still ticking 
&ndash; in the garbage.</p> 
<p>The void is a perfect time to go to the dollar store. Sometimes, the 
bargain-basement item proves indispensable, and the inexpensive gift intended 
for someone else is something you&rsquo;ll want to keep and treasure forever.
</p> 
<p>Knowledge Is Power</p> 
<p>Knowing ahead of time is empowerment. In a perfect world, we would all 
embrace the natural rhythm of the Moon and stars &ndash; and we&rsquo;d 
instinctively know the right moment for action &ndash; but in the real world, 
business meetings are scheduled in advance, and jobs have to be completed by a 
deadline.</p> 
<p>However, friends who were involved in my research over the past two years 
reported success by starting projects when the energy is there to move forward 
easily and by using the void-of-course Moon productively &ndash; to organize, 
plan, or just relax.</p> 
<p>Some friends found considerable business and financial success, while still 
taking time off to spend with family and friends. Others felt spiritually 
satisfied, and all seemed to achieve better balance by living in harmony with 
the energy of the cosmos.</p> 
<p>&quot;Knowing ahead helps people to focus,&quot; said my friend David, 
&quot;not on business, but on the business of life. Being successful takes 
talent, tenacity, and drive, but good timing can make a significant impact and 
broadens the net. Busy people &hellip; hard-driving and successful people want 
to see things through to the end, and they think that this is the most 
productive way to get the job done. But knowing ahead and taking time off 
during the &lsquo;void&rsquo; helps me to take a step back and then to finish 
the project at a time of my own choosing.&quot;</p>
