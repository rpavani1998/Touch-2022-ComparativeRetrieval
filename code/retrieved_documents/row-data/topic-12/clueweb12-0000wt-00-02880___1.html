<p>Noisy, vibrant and truly multicultural, <b>London</b> is a megalopolis of 
people, ideas and energy. The capital and largest city of both theUnited Kingdom
 and ofEngland, it is also the largest city in Western Europe and the European 
Union. Situated on the River Thames inSouth-East England, <b>Greater London</b> 
has an official population of nearly 8 million people &mdash; although the 
figure of over 14 million for the city's total metropolitan area more 
accurately reflects London's size and importance. London is one of the great 
&quot;world cities,&quot; and remains a global capital of culture, fashion, 
finance, politics and trade.</p> 
<p>London will host the 2012 Summer Olympics. </p> 
<h2>[edit] Districts</h2> 
<p>The name London originally referred only to the once-walled &quot;Square 
Mile&quot; of the original Roman (and later medieval) city (confusingly called 
the &quot;City of London&quot; or just &quot;The City&quot;). Today, London has 
taken on a much larger meaning to include all of the vast central parts of the 
modern metropolis, with the city having absorbed numerous surrounding towns and 
villages over the centuries, including large portions of the surrounding 
&quot;home counties&quot;, one of which - Middlesex - being completely consumed 
by the growing metropolis. The term Greater London embraces Central London 
together with all the outlying suburbs that lie in one continuous urban sprawl 
within the lower Thames valley. Though densely populated by New World 
standards, London retains large swathes of green parkland and open space, even 
within the city centre.</p> 
<p><b>Greater London</b> consists of 32 London boroughs and the City of London 
that, together with the office of the Mayor of London, form the basis for 
London's local government. The Mayor of London is elected by London residents 
and should not be confused with the Lord Mayor of the City of London. The names 
of several boroughs, such asWestminster or Camden, are well-known, others less 
so, such asWandsworth or Lewisham. This traveller's guide to London recognises 
cultural, functional and social districts of varying type and size:</p>

in London all that life can afford&quot;</i> &mdash; Samuel Johnson </dd> </dl> 
<h3>[edit] History</h3> 
<p>Settlement has existed on the site of London since well before Roman times, 
with evidence of Bronze Age and Celtic settlement. The Roman city of Londinium, 
established just after the Roman conquest of Britannia in the year 43, formed 
the basis for the modern city (some isolated Roman period remains are still to 
be seen within the City). After the end of Roman rule in 410 and a short-lived 
decline, London experienced a gradual revival under the Anglo-Saxons, as well 
as the Norsemen, and emerged as a great medieval trading city, and eventually 
replacedWinchester as the royal capital of England. This paramount status for 
London was confirmed when William the Conqueror, a Norman, built theTower of 
London after the conquest in 1066 and was crowned King of England in Westminster
.</p> 
<p>London went from strength to strength and with the rise of England to first 
European then global prominence and the city became a great centre of culture, 
government and industry. London's long association with the theatre, for 
example, can be traced back to the English renaissance (witness the Rose Theatre
[3] and great playwrights like Shakespeare who made London their home). With 
the rise of Britain to supreme maritime power in the 18th and 19th centuries 
and the possessor of the largest global empire, London became an imperial 
capital and drew people and influences from around the world to become, for 
many years, the largest city in the world.</p> 
<p>England's royal family has, over the centuries, added much to the London 
scene for today's traveller: theAlbert Memorial, Buckingham Palace, Kensington 
Palace, Royal Albert Hall, Tower of London, Kew Palace and Westminster Abbey 
being prominent examples.</p> 
<p>Despite the inevitable decline of the British Empire, and considerable 
suffering during World War II (when London was heavily bombed by the German 
Luftwaffe in the Blitz), the city is still a top-ranked world city: a global 
centre of culture, finance, and learning. Today London is easily the largest 
city in the United Kingdom, eight times larger than the second largest,
Birmingham, and ten times larger than the third, Glasgow, and dominates the 
economic, political and social life of the nation. It is full of excellent 
bars, galleries, museums, parks and theatres. It is also the most culturally 
and ethnically diverse part of the country, making it a great multicultural 
city to visit. Samuel Johnson famously said, &quot;when one is tired of London, 
one is tired of life.&quot; Whether you are interested in ancient history, 
modern art, opera or underground raves, London has it all.</p> 
<h3>[edit] The City and Westminster</h3> <br>
The world famous St. Stephen's 
Tower (the main bell is Big Ben) 
<p>If you ask a Londoner where the centre of London is, you are likely to get 
a wry smile. This is because historically London was two cities: a commercial 
city and a separate government capital.</p> 
<p>The commercial capital was the City of London. This had a dense population 
and all the other pre-requisites of a medieval city: walls, a castle (The Tower 
of London), a cathedral (St Pauls), a semi-independent City government, a port 
and a bridge across which all trade was routed so Londoners could make money 
(London Bridge).</p> 
<p>About an hour upstream (on foot or by boat) around a bend in the river was 
the government capital (Westminster). This had a church for crowning the 
monarch (Westminster Abbey) and palaces. As each palace was replaced by a 
larger one, the previous one was used for government, first the Palace of 
Westminster (better known as the Houses of Parliament), then Whitehall, then 
Buckingham Palace. The two were linked by a road called The &quot;Strand&quot;, 
old English for riverbank.</p> 
<p>London grew both west and east. The land to the west of the City (part of 
the parish of Westminster) was prime farming land (Covent Garden and Soho for 
example) and made good building land. The land to the east was flat, marshy and 
cheap, good for cheap housing and industry, and later for docks. Also the wind 
blows 3 days out of 4 from west to east, and the Thames (into which the sewage 
went) flows from west to east. So theWest End was up-wind and up-market, the 
East End was where people worked for a living. </p> 
<p>Modern-day London in these terms is a two-centre city, with the area in 
between known confusingly as the West End.</p>

<br>
<br>
London Eye 
<p>Despite a perhaps unfair reputation for being unsettled, London enjoys a 
dry and mild climate on average. Only one in three days on average will bring 
rain and often only for a short period. In some years such as 2010 there is no 
rain for several weeks.</p> 
<p>Winter in London is mild compared to nearby continental European cities, 
due to both the presence of the Gulf Stream and urban heat effect. Average 
daily maximum is 8&deg;C (46&deg;F) in December and January. Snow does occur, 
usually a few times a year but rarely heavy (a few years being exceptions such 
as the winters of 2009 and 2010, with temperatures dipping down to sub-zeros 
regularly). Snow in London can be crippling, as seen at the end of 2010. Just 7 
cm (3 in) of snow will cause trains to stop running, airports to see 
significant delays, and mail service will halt. London is a city which does not 
cope well with snow; walkways, stairs, and streets will not be cleared by 
shovels or plows. The streets will be salted/gritted, but will remain slick and 
snow/slush covered until the sun melts it away. Daylight hours are short with 
darkness filling up the sky by 4pm in December.</p> 
<p>Summer is perhaps the best season for tourists as it has long daylight 
hours as well as mild temperatures. The average daily high temperatures in July 
and August are around 24&deg;C (75&deg;F) The highest temperature since 2000 
was recorded once in August at 38&deg;C (100&deg;F). This means London can feel 
hot and humid for several days in the summer months. Also, because of urban 
heat effect, during night time it could feel muggy.</p> 
<p>Regardless of which time of the year, the weather in London could change 
quickly from sunny to rain and from hot to cold.</p> 
<h3>[edit] London 2012 Olympic Games</h3> 
<p>The International Olympic Committee decided in 2005 that London will serve 
as the host city for theGames of the XXX Olympiad [4], the Summer Olympic Games 
of 2012. This will make London the first city to hold the Olympic Games three 
times, having hosted the games previously in 1908 and 1948. The vast majority 
of events will be held in a regenerated area in East London.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Tourist Information Centres</h3> 
<p>Details of London's primary Tourist Information Centre are given below. 
There are other more minor centres and those are listed in the relevant 
district articles.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Britain and London Visitor Centre (BLVC), 1 Regent St, SW1Y 4XT (nearest 
tube station Piccadilly Circus), &#9742; +44 870 156 6366, [5]. M 09:30-18:00

10:00-16:00, Public holidays: 10:00-16:00. Closed 25-26 Dec and 1 Jan. Visit 
London is the official visitor organisation for the capital and has a lot of 
free information for visitors in several different languages. It also acts 
commercially and can have some astoundingly good last minute deals on 
accommodation. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul>

<h3>[edit] By plane</h3> <br>
Summary map of rail connections to London 
airports 
<p>Due to London's huge global city status it is the most served destination 
in the world when it comes to flights.</p> 
<p>London (all airports code: <b>LON</b>) is served by a total of five 
airports. Travelling between the city and the airports is made relatively easy 
by the large number of public transport links that have been put in place over 
recent years. However, if transiting through London, be sure to check the 
arrival and departure airports carefully as transfers across the city may be 
quite time consuming. In addition to London's five official airports (of which 
only two are located within Greater London), there are a number of other 
regional UK airports conveniently accessible from London. Since they offer a 
growing number of budget flights, choosing those airports can be cheaper (or 
even faster, depending on where in London your destination is).</p> 
<p>For transfers directly between London's airports, the fastest way (short of 
a taxi) is the direct inter-airport bus service by National Express[6]. Buses 
between Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton run at least hourly, with 
Heathrow-Gatwick services taking 65 min (&pound;18) and Heathrow-Stansted 
services 90 min (&pound;20.50) (note that services between Stansted and Luton 
run only every two hours). However, it's essential to allow leeway, as London's 
expressways, especially the orbital M25 and the M1 motorway, are often 
congested to the point of gridlock. Some buses have toilets on board.</p> 
<h4>[edit] London Heathrow</h4> <br>
Rail and tube lines go to different 
terminals at Heathrow 
<dl> 
<dd> <i>Main article: Heathrow Airport</i> </dd> </dl> 
<p>Heathrow (IATA: <b>LHR</b>, ICAO: <b>EGLL</b>) [7] is London and Europe's 
largest airport and the world's busiest airport in terms of international 
passenger movement, with services available from most major airports 
world-wide. Currently, four of the five terminals are operational - T2 is 
closed until 2014 for redevelopment. Flights landing at Heathrow are often 
delayed by up to an hour as a simple result of air traffic congestion and 
waiting for parking slots. To complicate the matter, airlines that fly into 
Heathrow are currently playing a system-wide game of musical chairs as gate 
assignments are cycled through the new terminal, making it even more necessary 
for travelers to check their terminal and gate assignment in advance. Do plan 
your itinerary to allocate some time needed to get through Heathrow Airport T3, 
it can be long if you are not holding an UK / EU passport. A quick summary of 
transport options (also seeHeathrow Airport): </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Fastest: by Heathrow Express rail, (Paddington Station - Heathrow 1, 2, 3 
&amp; 5), &#9742; +44 845 600 1515, [8]. Every 15 min, journey time 15 min. <b>
Travelcard &amp; Oyster card not valid.</b> These train lines terminate at 
London Paddington which for most people will require a tube, bus, or cab ride 
to their final destination. Despite the Heathrow Express &amp; Connect's speed, 
they are often not the fastest way to a final destination in London. One way, 
adult prices: &pound;18 (if purchased online or from ticket machine/office) and 
&pound;23, when purchased onboard; round trip is &pound;34. &nbsp;edit </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Second fastest: by Heathrow Connect rail, (Paddington Station - Heathrow 
1, 2, 3 &amp; 4), &#9742; +44 845 678 6975, [9]. <b>Travelcard &amp; Oyster 
card not valid to Heathrow. Does not serve Terminal 5.</b> Follows same route 
as Heathrow Express but stops at several intermediate stations to London 
Paddington so journey is 25 minutes and trains less frequent. One way 
&pound;9.10, round trip &pound;17.80. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Cheapest: by London Underground (Piccadilly line), &#9742; +44 845 330 
9880, [10]. Every few minutes, journey time approximately 1 hour, however this 
depends on your destination. For the cheapest single fare ask for an <i>Oyster
</i> card (&pound;5 refundable deposit). Zone 1-6 Travelcard valid. If using 
this method to return to Heathrow during the morning/evening peak, leave plenty 
of time in departing from central London as trains often get rerouted down the 
Rayners Lane branch or terminate short at Acton Town or Northfields - even if 
they were originally designated as Heathrow-bound. Be aware that weekend 
engineering works can result in replacement buses being run in place of the 
trains - check with the TFL website beforehand. With Oyster one way &pound;2.90 
(off-peak) to &pound;4.80 (peak). &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Bus N9</b> [11] operates service from midnight-05:00 between Heathrow 
and Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square, roughly following the Piccadilly 
Line into Central London</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Taxi. A taxi from Heathrow to central London will cost &pound;45-60. You 
may wish to consider taking a taxi if you have a lot of baggage or small 
children. Alternatively catch public transport into the city centre and then 
catch a taxi. There are two types of taxis: Black cabs (these can be hailed on 
a street or at a taxi rank) and licensed mini cabs (these are typically cheaper 
- but must be booked in advance over the phone or on the web). There are over 
1000 minicab companies in London. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Pre-booked Mini Cab. A pre-booked sedan transfer from Heathrow to central 
London will cost &pound;35-40. This an excellent and cheaper alternative to a 
black cab. The big advantage is the fixed fare, regardless of traffic 
conditions or route. There are dozens of companies serving Heathrow, just 
google 'heathrow minicab'. Once booked, the driver will be waiting for you with 
a sign bearing your name in the arrivals area. Be sure to generously tip the 
hard-working mostly immigrant drivers. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Also: to South London, &#9742; +44 845 748 4950, [12]. Bus 285 (or taxi) 
to Feltham railway station (20 minutes) then a train to London Waterloo on the
South Bank or Clapham Junction in South West London. Furthermore, bus X26 
(limited stop) is an express route stopping in three of South London's district 
centres: Kingston, Sutton and Croydon. Zone 1-6 Travelcard valid on all London 
buses and trains. &pound;2 single. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Airport Parking</b> [13]. Heathrow Terminal 5 Parking. </li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit] London Gatwick</h4> 
<p>(IATA: <b>LGW</b>, ICAO: <b>EGKK</b>) [14] London's second airport, also 
serving a large spectrum of places world-wide. It is the world's busiest single 
runway airport and is split into a<b>North</b> and <b>South Terminal</b>. To 
get to the centre of the city, the following options exist:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> By rail: Gatwick Express, &#9742; +44 845 850 1530, [15]. Every 15 min, 
journey time 30-35 min. To London Victoria. Travelcard not valid. One way 
&pound;18.90, round trip &pound;33.20, for the cheapest fare visit their website

<h4>[edit] London Stansted</h4> 
<p>Getting to Stansted for an early morning flight is fairly straight forward, 
coaches run through the night, provided by Terravision[22] and National Express 
from London Victoria and London Liverpool Street. Terravision costs &pound;9 
one way and run roughly every hour throughout the night, check their site[23] 
for up to date timetable information. Be aware that lines are very common at 
Stansted, security check can easily take an hour. Also getting to the airport 
can take longer than the proclaimed 90 minutes, expect more like 120 minutes.
</p> 
<p><b>Sleeping at Stansted Airport</b> </p>
<p>A large number of budget flights depart from Stansted as early as 6AM (when 
the lowest fares are available). However, this presents travellers with a 
problem, as the airport's location is a long way outside London, and transport 
to the airport is sporadic before 5:30AM. Due to the high price of 
accommodation in the city and near the airport, and the fact that many budget 
airlines don't pay for accommodation in the event of cancellation, an 
increasing number of travellers choose to spend the night in the airport prior 
to their flight. A crowd of around 100 travellers (up to 400 in summer) camp in 
the main departure/arrivals hall every night, effectively turning it into a 
giant dormitory. Tips for sleeping at Stansted Airport:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Arrive early, preferably around 10PM, and stake your territory 
immediately. Benches without armrests are in limited supply and fill up quickly.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> If you arrive later, take a floor mat and sleeping bag. Sleeping on the 
floor is tolerated by the staff, but avoid pitching your bed in front of shops 
and counters.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> A sleeping bag is generally recommended as the automatic doors constantly 
open and close as passengers arrive, and it can get chilly in winter.</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li> Safety is not a problem. The airport is miles away from any settlement 
and security guards overlook the open-plan building 24/7.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Ear plugs and eye covers are a must, as the cleaning staff are noisy and 
shop assistants start arriving at 4AM to open shutters.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> At least one cafe is open all night, offering snacks and hot drinks. 
Boots the chemist is also open 24/7</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Toilets remain open and are normally in good condition. There is a 
drinking fountain to the left of the Accessorize storefront and the security 
entrance &quot;Door 1&quot;, where you can fill water bottles for the night.
</li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p>(ICAO: <b>EGSS</b>, IATA: <b>STN</b>) [24] Currently London's third 
airport, the base for a large number of budget carriers (for example EasyJet[25]
, RyanAir[26], Thomson and Pegasus [27]) and flights within Europe and a few 
inter-continental flights. There are several commercial wi-fi hotspots covering 
most of the airport, but they charge extortionate rates. A free wi-fi hotspot 
is in the arrivals gate area, next to the phone booths offering fixed internet.

<h4>[edit] London Luton</h4> 
<p>(ICAO: <b>EGGW</b>, IATA: <b>LTN</b>)[35] Is smaller than Stansted, but 
still a major hub for many Low Cost airlines, and over 10 million passengers 
fly through the airport each year. It boasts the same facilities of the other 
major airports and also like Stansted, it is common place for some passengers 
on early morning flight, to sleepover in the terminal before their flights. The 
Parkway Airport station, which serves the terminal is about 20 minutes walk 
back into town, though there is a regular shuttle bus charging &pound;1.50 to 
take you to the station.</p> 
<p>The airport is a major hub for easyJet, Ryanair, Wizzair, Thomson Airways 
and Monarch Airlines, with other airlines also serving the airport like Aer 
Arann, FlyBE and El Al, to cities primarily inScotland, Europe, North Africa 
and the Mediterranean Basin.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> By rail, [36]. Journey time: 20-55 min. &pound;12.50 one way. Travelcard 
not valid. &nbsp;editThe airport has its own railway station &quot;Luton 
Airport Parkway&quot;, and is served by trains 24 hours a day from Central 
London using &quot;First Capital Connect Trains&quot; and connects with St 
Pancras International. There are up to 10 trains an hour, depending on the time 
of day. All trains go to London St Pancras International, but many also 
continue on to Blackfriars, London Bridge and Elephant &amp; Castle, and 
Gatwick Airport. The station is nearly 2 km (1 mi) from the terminal building, 
there is a shuttle bus service running between the terminal and airport every 
10 minutes, costing &pound;1 each way.</li> </ul>

<ul> 
<li> By car. 60 km (34 mi) north of London, just off the M1 motorway which 
connects London with the Midlands and the North of England. Depending on where 
you are travelling from in London and time of day, journey times take 45-90 
mins. Road users should plan their journey and check traffic conditions, as if 
an incident occurs on London's busy roads, journey times can dramatically 
increase. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit] London City Airport</h4> 
<p>(ICAO: <b>EGLC</b>, IATA: <b>LCY</b>)[39] A commuter airport close to the 
city's financial district, and specializing in short-haul business flights to 
other major European cities. Not as expensive to fly into than it used to be, 
and you may indeed find that from some origins, this may be your cheapest 
London airport to fly to, without even considering the cost savings of NOT 
coming from the distant larger London airports with &pound;10+ transfer costs. 
Then there is the added bonus is that it is close to central London, with a 
convenient link on the DLR.</p> 
<p>To get to the city centre the following options exist: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> By Docklands Light Railway (DLR). See also: Get around. Travelcard valid. 
&nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> By taxi. Journey time approximately 30 min. &pound;20-35. &nbsp;edit </li>

<li> By bus, [40]. Take the 474 bus to Canning Town station and then the 115 
or N15 into central London. See also:Get around. Travelcard valid. &nbsp;edit 
</li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit] Other airports near London</h4> 
<ul> 
<li> London Southend Airport, &#9742; +44 1702 608100, [41]. (IATA: <b>SEN</b>
, ICAO:<b>EGMC</b>) Currently undergoing redevelopment. A new railway station 
opened in 2011, which is adjacent to the new terminal. Airport claims to become 
London's sixth international airport. At present it serves destinations in the 
British Isles only, but from April 2012 easyjet will operate a number of 
european routes. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Ashford Airport</b>, also known as Lydd Airport has rather 
seasonal, limited services and is used primarily for businessmen.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Southampton Airport, &#9742; +44 870 040 0009, [42]. Every 30 min, 
journey time 1 hour. (IATA: <b>SOU</b>, ICAO: <b>EGHI</b>) is not officially a 
London airport, though accessible enough to conveniently serve the capital, 
especially South West London. A couple of budget carriers serving an increasing 
number of European destinations are based here. Direct trains connect 
Southampton airport to London Waterloo station. &pound;30-35 round trip. &nbsp;
edit <b>Bournemouth Airport</b> similarly operates a couple of Ryanair flight 
amongst others, and is not too far west on the train line from Southampton.</li>
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Birmingham International Airport, &#9742; +44 870 733 5511, [43]. (IATA: 
<b>BHX</b>, ICAO: <b>EGBB</b>) is another non-London airport worth considering 
as a less congested and hectic alternative to Heathrow, being just over an hour 
away from London. As a major airport serving the UK's second largest city, 
there is a good choice of long distance and European destinations. Direct 
trains connect Birmingham International to London Euston and Watford. From 
&pound;10 (advance web purchase) one way, &pound;35-100 round trip. &nbsp;edit 
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Other small airports, such as <b>Oxford Airport</b> can also be useful. 
<b>Kent International Airport</b> and <b>Shoreham Airport</b> (near Brighton) 
are similarly small.<b>Biggin Hill</b> in Bromley borough had a rejected 
licence bid in 2010 for commercial flights for the Olympics but may recieve one 
in the near future.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By train</h3> 
<p>London is the hub of the British rail network - every major city in 
mainland Britain has a frequent train service to the capital, and most of the 
smaller, provincial cities and large towns also have a direct rail connection 
to London of some sort - although the frequency and quality of service can vary 
considerably from place to place.</p> 
<p>Rail fares to London vary enormously from very cheap to prohibitively 
expensive - the golden rules are to book Advance tickets for a particular train 
time, don't travel into the city on Friday afternoons and Sundays, and avoid 
buying tickets on the day of travel. There are three basic types of ticket, 
which are summarised below. Note that much of the advice applies to rail travel 
in general within the United Kingdom.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>ANYTIME</b> - travel on any train, any operator at any time, returning 
within one month with few restrictions. Very expensive however - on a long 
distance journey from Northern England or Scotland for example - an Anytime 
return ticket to London won't leave you with any change out of &pound;250!</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>OFF-PEAK</b> - travel on certain trains within a specific time-frame; 
again returning within one month. Typically this excludes anything that arrives 
into London during the morning rush hour (before 10:00 typically), or any train 
which departs during evening rush hour (16:30-18:30). Weekends generally carry 
no restrictions on the use of Off-Peak tickets. There are however, a 
monumentally complex number of exceptions for which Off-Peak tickets are and 
aren't valid which are barely fathomable to the British, never mind overseas 
visitors. If you are in any doubt at all about the validity of an Off-Peak 
ticket, ask a guard at the station or a ticket office BEFORE getting on a train 
- as on-train conductors can be notoriously unforgiving.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>ADVANCE</b> - travel on a specific day and train time, booked up to 12 
weeks in advance either in person at a railway station, over the telephone, or 
online. Two Advance single tickets for the outward and return legs of the 
journey are generally cheaper than the Off-Peak return ticket. Better deals can 
often be had by going directly to the train operator's website. The earlier you 
book, the more you save - you can get down to as little as &pound;12.00 one-way 
from Scotland for example, but these tickets are non-refundable, and cannot be 
used on anything other than the date, train time and operator that is printed 
on the reservation. Go on any other train and get caught and you will be 
obliged to pay the Anytime fare for the journey you are making - which as we've 
said before is hideously expensive!</li> </ul> 
<p>The local and commuter rail companies within the London and Home Counties 
area also have a bewildering array of special fares which are all in essence, 
variations of the Off-Peak ticket and are far too detailed to cover here, go 
directly to the website of the operator concerned for more information. Note 
that if you only intend to use trains within the Greater London boundary, then 
the<b>Oyster Card</b> (explained below) is by far the easiest and cheapest 
option to use.</p> 
<p>Seats can be reserved for free on all long-distance trains to London - the 
reservation is always issued automatically with an Advance ticket, and with 
most Off-Peak and Anytime tickets bought online. If, for whatever reason you 
hold an Anytime or Off-Peak ticket and there is no seat reservation coupon, 
then it is highly recommended you get one from any railway station ticket 
office - if you want to avoid camping out in the vestibule for all or part of 
the journey!! First Class is available on all long distance services to London, 
the standard of service varies from operator to operator, but in general you 
get a wider, more comfortable seat, free tea/coffee for the duration of the 
journey, and some sort of complimentary catering service. If can be great value 
if you get an Advance first-class fare, but it is extremely expensive 
otherwise, and to be honest - not really worth it. You can pay a Weekend 
supplement (generally &pound;15-&pound;20) to sit in the first class section of 
the train on Saturdays and Sundays, - useful if the service you are on is 
hideously overcrowded - but you don't get the same catering service as during 
the week.</p> 
<p>If you are the holder of a Britrail pass, things are simpler - but remember 
you still have to make a seat reservation for the train you intend to travel on 
- otherwise you run the risk of standing for the journey! If you intend to use 
the overnight Sleeper trains to London, you will have to pay a berth supplement 
for every member of your party - provided there is berth availability on the 
train.</p> 
<p>London has one international high speed rail route (operated by Eurostar 
[44] 0870 518 6186 ) from Paris (2h 15min) and Brussels (1h 50 min) diving 
under the sea for 35 km (22 mi) via the Channel Tunnel to come out in England. 
It terminates at St. Pancras International Station. For domestic train 
services, there are no fewer than 12 main line<i>National Rail</i> [45] 
terminals (although in conversation you may hear the brand<i>National Rail</i> 
infrequently if ever it differentiates main line and London Underground 
services; journey planner online or phone 0845 748 49 50). With the exception 
of Fenchurch St (tube: Tower Hill) these are on the London Underground. Most 
are on the circle line. Clockwise starting at Paddington, major<i>National Rail
</i> stations are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Paddington</b>, serves South West England and Wales including 
Slough,Maidenhead, Reading, Oxford, Bath, Bristol, Taunton, Exeter, Plymouth and
Cardiff and Swansea. Also the downtown terminus of the Heathrow Airport Express 
(see above) and serves some suburban stations such as Acton Main Line and 
Ealing Broadway.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Marylebone</b>, serves some north western suburban stations 
such as Amersham, Harrow on the Hill and Wembley Stadium. Also servesAylesbury, 
High Wycombe, Banbury, Stratford-upon-Avon and the city of Birmingham. It is 
much cheaper but slightly slower to take a train from Marylebone to Birmingham 
instead of a train from London Euston. Recently a new service to<b>Shrewsbury
</b>, <b>Telford</b> , and Wrexham has been launched by the <b>Wrexham &amp; 
Shropshire</b> railway company [46]. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Euston</b>, serves the Midlands, north-west England and west 
Scotland:Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Chester, Oxenholme Lake District, 
Carlisle, Glasgow, and Holyhead for connecting ferries to/from both the 
Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Sleeper trains to Scotland leave from 
Euston.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>St Pancras International</b>, serves Paris, Brussels, Lille, as well 
as Luton Airport,Catford several destinations in Kent and the East Midlands: 
Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London King's Cross</b>, serves East Anglia, north-east England and 
east Scotland:Cambridge, Doncaster, Leeds, York, Kingston upon Hull, Newcastle 
upon Tyne, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Platform 9 3/4 from the Harry Potter books 
is marked with a special sign, although platform 9 itself is actually in the 
fairly unpleasant metallic extension used by Cambridge trains.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Moorgate</b>, serves some northern suburbs. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Liverpool Street</b>, serves East Anglia: Ipswich and Norwich. 
Also the downtown terminus of the Stansted Airport Express.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Fenchurch Street</b>, serves commuter towns north of the Thames 
estuary toSouthend. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Bridge</b>, <b>London Cannon Street</b>, <b>London Waterloo East
</b> and <b>London Charing Cross</b>, serve south and south east London and 
England:Brighton, Dover, Eastbourne, Hastings and Ramsgate. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Blackfriars</b>, serves Gatwick Airport and Brighton. </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Waterloo</b>, serves south west London and England: Portsmouth, 
Winchester, Southampton, Bournemouth, Weymouth, Salisbury and Exeter. </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>London Victoria</b>, serves south east London and England: Brighton, 
Dover,Eastbourne, Hastings and Ramsgate. Also the downtown terminus of the 
Gatwick Airport Express.</li> </ul> 
<p>In South London many areas have only <i>National Rail</i> services (no 
London Underground services but there are buses). London Bridge, Victoria, 
Cannon St and Charing Cross serve the South East. London Waterloo serves the 
South West.<b>First Capital Connect</b> (frequently referred to as <b>Thameslink
</b>) is a cross London route between Bedford and Brighton via Luton Airport 
(Parkway), St. Pancras International, Farringdon, City Thameslink, Blackfriars, 
London Bridge and Gatwick Airport.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By bus</h3> 
<p>Most international and domestic long distance bus (UK English: coach) 
services arrive at and depart from a complex of coach stations off Buckingham 
Palace Road inWestminster close to London Victoria rail station. All services 
operated by National Express or Eurolines (see below) serve<b>Victoria Coach 
Station</b>, which actually has separate arrival and departure buildings. 
Services by other operators may use this station, or the<b>Green Line Coach 
Station</b> across Buckingham Palace Road. The following are amongst the main 
coach operators:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> National Express, &#9742; +44 870 580 8080, [47].  is by far the largest 
domestic coach operator and operates services to / from London from throughout 
England, Wales andScotland. Advance ticketing is usually required and 
recommended practice in any case. Fares are low - especially when booked in 
advance via the web. A few journeys are fast but most are notably slower than 
using the train. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Eurolines, &#9742; +44 870 514 3219, [48].  is an associate company of 
National Express, and runs coach services to / from London with various cities 
inNorthern Ireland, the Ireland and continental Europe. Advance ticketing is 
required. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Megabus, &#9742; +44 900 160 0900, [49].  operates budget coach services 
from/to London (Victoria Coach Station) to/from several major regional cities, 
it is even possible to get to Inverness in theScottish Highlands. Fares are 
demand responsive but can be very cheap (&pound;1.50 if you book far enough in 
advance). &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Greyhound, &#9742; +44 900 096 0000, [50].  coach services with free 
wi-fi, newspapers and extra legroom. From/to London (Victoria Coach Station) 
to/from several cities. Fares can be very cheap. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By car</h3> 
<p>London is the hub of the UK's road network and is easy to reach by car, 
even if driving into the centre of the city is definitely not recommended. 
Greater London is encircled by the<b>M25 orbital motorway</b>, from which 
nearly all the major trunk routes to Scotland, Wales and the rest of England 
radiate. The most important are listed below.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>M1:</b> The main route to/from the North, leading from the East 
Midlands, Yorkshire and terminating at Leeds. Most importantly, Britain's 
longest motorway - the M6, branches from the M1 at Rugby, leading to 
Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, the Lake District and onwards to the 
Scottish border, and ultimately Glasgow.</li> 
<li> <b>A1/A1(M)</b> The A1 is the original, historic &quot;Great North 
Road&quot; between England and Scotland's capital cities and has largely been 
converted to motorway standard; it runs up the eastern side of Great Britain 
through Peterborough, York, Newcastle and continues north through 
Northumberland and the Scottish Borders to Edinburgh.</li> 
<li> <b>M40/A40:</b> Arrives in London from a north westerly direction, 
linking the city with Oxford and providing an additional link from Birmingham.
</li> 
<li> <b>M4:</b> The principal route to/from the West - leading to Bath, 
Bristol and cities South Wales (Cardiff and Swansea). It is also the main route 
towards Heathrow Airport.</li> 
<li> <b>M3:</b> The main route to London from the shipping port of Southampton.
</li> 
<li> <b>M2/M20</b>: Together, these motorways are the main link to the coastal 
ferry (and Channel Tunnel) ports of Dover and Folkestone from Continental 
Europe.</li> 
<li> <b>M11</b>: The M11 connects Stansted Airport and Cambridge to London, 
and it terminates on the north eastern periphery of the city.</li> </ul> 
<p>In addition to the M25, here are two inner ring roads in London which skirt 
the central area:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>A406/A205 North Circular/South Circular</b> The North Circular is a 
half circle on the North of the Thames, and is mostly a dual carriageway. It 
has direct connections with the M4, M40, M1 and M11 motorways and can be useful 
if you want to quickly get around the northern suburbs of the city. The 
corresponding South Circular is really a local road which is made up of 
segments of main suburban thoroughfares. The two roads are connected at the 
east end of the circle in North Woolwich/Woolwich Arsenal by the Woolwich Free 
Ferry, which runs approx. every 10-15 minutes and is free of charge, although 
it can only carry a limited amount of vehicles so avoid during busy periods as 
the queues can be very long! The ferry stops running after 10pm, so it's 
advisable to travel through the Docklands and use the Blackwall Tunnel instead.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Comparatively few people will actually drive into (or anywhere near) the 
centre of London. The infamous M25 ring road did not earn its irreverent 
nicknames &quot;The Road To Hell&quot; and &quot;Britain's biggest car 
park&quot; for nothing. The road is heavily congested at most times of the day, 
and is littered with automatically variable speed limits which are enforced 
with speed cameras. Despite the controversial &quot;congestion charge&quot;, 
driving a car anywhere near the centre of London remains a nightmare with 
crowded roads, impatient drivers and extortionate parking charges (that's if 
you can find a space in the first place, that is!). From Monday through Friday, 
parking in the City of London is free after 18:30; after 13:30 on Saturday and 
all day Sunday.</p> 
<p>There are also a number of Pay as you go car rental companies operating 
around London including<b>WhizzGo</b> [51] and <b>Car Clubs</b> [52] </p> 
<h2>[edit] Get around</h2> 
<p> <b>Transport maps</b> </p>
<p> London is the home of the famous tube map, and TfL produce some excellent 
maps to help you get around:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Tube map </li> 
<li> Tube and trains with Oyster card information </li> 
<li> Bus maps - if you know which borough you're in, these maps are very useful
</li> 
<li> River buses - great if you're near the Thames </li> </ul> <br>
<br>

<p><b>Engineering work</b> </p>
<p> In the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics, Transport for London are 
undertaking a massive redevelopment programme on the 19th- and 20th-Century 
Tube network. As a result, many Tube lines are closed on most weekends, and 
some lines close for several weeks at a time. Alternative bus services may be 
provided, but these can be slowed down by traffic congestion. It is very 
important to check the TfL website fortravel updates, especially at weekends, 
to avoid disappointment. A number of mobile phone apps are also available to 
download which show line closures on real-time Tube maps.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The city has one of the most comprehensive public transport systems in the 
world. Despite residents' constant, and sometimes justified, grumbling about 
unreliability, public transport is often the best option for getting anywhere 
for visitors and residents alike.</p> 
<p>In central London use a combination of the transport options listed below - 
and check your map! In many cases you can easily walk from one place to another 
or use the busses. Be a Londoner and only use the tube as a way of travelling 
longer distances - you're here to see London - you can't see it underground!</p>
<p><b>Transport for London (TfL)</b> [53] is a government organisation 
responsible for all public transport. Their website contains maps plus an 
excellent<b>journey planner</b> [54]. They also offer a 24-hour travel 
information line, charged at premium rate: tel<i>+44-843-</i>2221234 (or text 
60835) for suggestions on getting from A to B, and for up to the minute 
information on how services are running. Fortunately for visitors (and indeed 
residents) there is a single ticketing system, Oyster, which enables travellers 
to switch between modes of transport on one ticket.</p> 
<p>The main travel options in summary are: </p> 
<p><b>Central London</b> </p> 
<p><b>By tube / underground</b> 11 colour-coded lines cover the central area 
and suburbs mostly north of the River Thames, run by TfL.</p> 
<p><b>By Docklands Light Railway (DLR)</b> Runs only in the east of the city, 
privately run but part of TfL's network.</p> 
<p><b>By boat</b> Commuter boats and pleasure cruises along the River Thames, 
privately run but part of TfL's network.</p> 
<p><b>Airport Express</b> Express rail services run to Heathrow, Gatwick, 
Stansted and Luton airports (tickets are generally sold at a premium), 
privately run and not part of the TfL network.</p> 
<p><b>Suburban London</b> </p> 
<p><b>By tram (Tramlink)</b> A tram service that operates only in southern 
suburbs around Wimbledon and Croydon.</p> 
<p><b>By Overground</b> 3 orange-coloured lines circling the northern suburbs 
(including the former East London line) , part of TfL's network.</p> 
<p><b>By National Rail</b> A complex network of suburban rail services, mostly 
running in the southern suburbs, privately run and not part of the TfL network, 
although many do accept Oyster payments.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Oyster Card</h3>  Oyster Card in use <br>

<p><b>Oyster</b> [55] is a contactless electronic smartcard run by Transport 
for London. In general, Oyster is the more cost effective option than paper 
tickets if you plan to be in London for any more than a couple of days, or if 
you intend to make return visits to the city - the savings quickly recover the 
initial purchase cost. You can buy an Oyster Card from any Tube station for a 
deposit of &pound;5. You can also get a<b>Visitor Oyster card</b> [56] for a 
deposit of &pound;5, although these cards can be used only to pay as you go and 
cannot be loaded with 7 Day Travelcards. You can &quot;charge up&quot; an 
Oyster card with electronic funds. This cash is then deducted according to 
where you travel. The cost of a single trip using the Oyster card is 
considerably less than buying a single paper ticket with cash. Prices vary 
depending on distance travelled, whether by bus or tube, and on the time of 
day. You can also add various electronic 1 week, 1 month and longer-period 
tickets onto the card, and the card is simply validated each time you use it. 
The deposit is fully refundable if you hand it in at the end of the trip. 
However, there is no expiry date on the Oyster Card or any pay-as-you-go credit 
on the card. If you have any pay-as-you-go credit left this will also be 
refunded. You will get refunds in cash only if you paid in cash. Be prepared to 
give your signature on receipts or even show ID for refunds over a few pounds.
</p> 
<h4>[edit] Pay-as-you-go (PrePay)</h4> 
<p>You can charge up your Oyster card with electronic cash at any tube station 
ticket machine or ticket desk (you can even use a credit card to do this if 
your credit card has a PIN number) with Oyster pay-as-you-go, also known as 
PrePay. This money is then deducted from your card each time you get on a 
service. The fare is calculated based on your start and end points. 
Pay-as-you-go is much cheaper than paying in cash for each journey. For 
instance, a cash tube one way in Zone 1 is &pound;4, while with an Oyster Card 
it costs &pound;1.90. Furthermore, a cash bus fare is &pound;2.40 while with 
Oyster it is &pound;1.35.</p> 
<p>The amount of PrePay deducted from your Oyster card in one day is capped at 
the cost of the appropriate<b>paper day ticket (day Travelcard)</b> for the 
zones you have travelled through. For zone 1-2 (central London including 
everywhere inside the Circle line and some places outside) this is &pound;6.60 
(&pound;8 M-F before 09:30).</p> 
<p>On the tube, be sure to touch in and touch out again at the end of your 
journey. If you forget to touch your Oyster card at the start and finish you 
will be charged extra!</p> 
<p>Oyster also saves time getting onto buses. If you don't have an Oyster, 
tickets have to be bought at a machine by the bus stop in the central area, and 
from the driver outside the zone.</p> 
<p> If you have a National Railcard, such as the 16-25 year old railcard, you 
can register this with your Oyster card at a Tube ticket office and then 
continue to receive special discounts on your TFL travel.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Travelcards</h4> 
<p>A <b>Travelcard</b> may be loaded onto an Oyster card or may be purchased 
as a paper ticket.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Day Travelcard</i> - Zones 1-2 - Anytime: &pound;8.00, Off-Peak

comprehensive list of the prices visit the TFL website:</p> 
<p>1 Day Travelcards [57] </p> 
<p>7 Day, Monthly &amp; Annual Travelcards [58] </p> 
<h4>[edit] Travelcard season tickets</h4> 
<p>Weekly, monthly and longer-period <i>Travelcard season tickets</i> can be 
purchased at all tube station ticket offices. These can be used on any tube, 
DLR, bus, London Overground,<i>National Rail</i> or tram service. You have to 
select a range of zones when you buy it, numbered 1-9. If you happen to travel 
outside the zone, you can use PrePay (see above) to make up the difference. 
Note that they can<i>not</i> be used on any Airport Express trains (Heathrow 
Express, Gatwick Express and Stansted Express). However, a Zone 1-6 Travelcard
<i>can</i> be used on the London Underground (Piccadilly line) to/from Heathrow 
Airport.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Tips</h4> 
<ul> 
<li> Touch the card against a yellow disc, prominently displayed on the entry 
and exit gates for the Tube (do not try to insert it into the slot!) and on 
buses and trams.</li> 
<li> On the Docklands Light Railway, and on the Overground railway stations in 
the outlying parts of the city there are no entry or exit gates (except at 
interchanges with the Tube like Bank or Stratford), so you have to be sure to 
touch your Oyster card on the readers (which are clearly signposted) as you 
enter and leave. Failure to do this when you begin a journey is regarded as 
fare dodging (carrying a penalty fare or even a fine if you are caught). 
Equally, failing to touch out when you leave a station will result in you being 
overcharged for your journey, as the system will make a default deduction of 
&pound;6.50 since it doesn't know which station you left at.</li> 
<li> Theoretically you don't need to remove your Oystercard from your wallet 
or bag to do touch in/out - the card reader can work through a bag, but in 
reality you may need to take the card out to get it to work - watch out for 
this especially if you have another smartcard in your wallet/purse (e.g. an an 
employers' identity badge or a contactless bank card) as this can confuse the 
barriers or ticket machines.</li> 
<li> Be careful standing near the readers on some bendy buses, they are often 
quite sensitive and may read your card from several centimetres away, even if 
you did not intend this.</li> 
<li> If you keep your Oystercard in your wallet try not to sit on it as 
sometimes they will crack and stop working.</li> </ul> 
<h4>[edit] Validity</h4> 
<p>The following table summarises the validity of the different tickets you 
can use on Oyster. For most tourists, tubes and buses are the only transport 
you will use, but be aware that these tickets are not valid on Airport Express 
trains.</p> Bus London Underground London Overground National Rail DLR Tram

<br>

<ul> 
<li> Bus (and Tram) Passes are only available for periods of 7 days and longer.
</li> 
<li> Travelcards are valid only within the zones you buy. </li> 
<li> Piccadilly line to Heathrow is a London Underground train, so PrePay and 
Travelcards are valid.</li>

A reminder on the streets of London to 
&quot;Look Right&quot; when you cross the road 
<h3>[edit] By foot</h3> 
<p>London is a surprisingly compact city, making it a walker's delight and 
often being the quickest method of transport.</p> 
<p>Because Britain drives on the left hand side of the road, for most foreign 
visitors it can be all too easy to forget that traffic will come at you from 
the opposite direction than you are used to when crossing a street - for this 
reason<b>remember to look right when you cross the road</b>. </p> 
<p>Particularly on Central London's busiest streets, it is easy to spot native 
Londoners as they are able to weave in and out of the large crowds at fast 
speed. Refrain from walking slowly in tight spaces to avoid annoying any fast 
walking people that may be trying to pass.</p>

<p> <b>Tube etiquette</b> </p>
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Beware of pickpockets. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Drinking alcohol or smoking anywhere on the underground is illegal. </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> When using the escalators, <b>always stand on the right</b> to allow 
people in a hurry to pass. If you are standing on the left people will 
occasionally ask grumpily for you to get out the way, especially during rush 
hour when commuters are far less forgiving.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Allow passengers to get off the train before boarding yourself by 
standing to the right or to the left of the train doors.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Move down the carriages if standing during busy periods </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Have your Oyster card or ticket ready for the top of the escalators so 
not to obstruct barriers.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Be careful at the ticket barrier of people coming up close behind you in 
an attempt to get through the barrier on your ticket. This isn't a huge 
problem, but it does happen.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Some platforms in Zone 1 have the words &quot;Mind the Gap&quot; written 
on the platform edge. When the train stops, the carriage doors will usually 
line up with this warning.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Give up your seat to the elderly and those less able to stand, especially 
if the seat is reserved for such a purpose.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <i>Never</i> try to board or leave a train when the door warning (a 
rapidly-repeating high pitch beep) is sounding. Many older trains are not 
fitted with sensors to detect if the doors are blocked and it's all too easy to 
become stuck in the doors, although the train cannot start if the doors are 
still open.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> <br>
<br>

<p> The <b>London Underground</b> [59] - also known popularly as <b>The Tube
</b> - has trains that criss-cross London in the largest underground rail 
network in the world (it was also the first, the first section of the 
Metropolitan Line dates back to 1863). The Tube is an easy method of transport 
even for new visitors to London.</p> 
<p>Tube maps [60] are freely available from any station, most tourist offices 
and are prominently displayed in stations and in the back of most diaries. The 
Tube is made up of 11 lines each bearing a traditional name and a standard 
colour on the Tube map. To plan your trip on The Tube work out first which 
station is closest to your starting point and which closest to your 
destination. You can change between lines at interchange stations (providing 
you stay within the zones shown on your ticket). Since the Tube Map is well 
designed it is very easy to work out how to get between any two stations, and 
since each station is clearly signed it is easy to work out when to exit your 
train. Visitors should be aware, however, that the Tube map is a diagram and 
not a scaled map, making it misleading for determining the relative distance 
between stations as it makes central stations appear further apart and somewhat 
out of place - the most distant reaches of the Metropolitan Line for example 
are almost 60 km (40 mi) from the centre of the city. In central London, taking 
The Tube for just one stop can be a waste of time; Londoners joke about the 
tourists who use the Tube to travel between Leicester Square and Covent Garden 
stations. This is especially true since the walk from a tube station entrance 
to the platform at some central stations can be extensive. The Tube map also 
gives no information on London's extensive overground bus network and its 
orbital rail network.</p> 
<p>Trains run from around 05:30 to about 01:00. They are usually the fastest 
way to travel in London, the only problem being the relative expense, and that 
it can get extremely crowded during rush hours (07:30-10:00 and 16:30-19:00). 
On warm days take a bottle of water with you. Also note that engineering works 
usually take place during weekends or the evening. Contact TfL or visit their 
web site[61] especially if you plan to travel on a Saturday or a Sunday when 
entire lines may be shut down.</p> 
<p>All lines are identified by name (Circle Line, Central Line, Piccadilly 
Line). Many lines have multiple branches rather than running point-to-point so 
always to check the train's destination (which is shown on the front of the 
train, the platform indicator screens and will be broadcast on the train's PA). 
Some branch lines (such as the Chesham branch of the Metropolitan Line or the 
Kensington Olympia branch of the District Line) run as shuttles and require a 
transfer onto the 'main line'. Note that the Northern Line has two separate 
routes through the city centre which split at Euston and rejoin at Kennington, 
one (officially called the Charing Cross Branch but known by locals as the West 
End branch) runs through the West End serving Leicester Square, Charing Cross 
and Waterloo, while the other route runs via the City of London (officially 
called the Bank branch but also referred to as the City branch) with major 
stops at Kings Cross and Bank.</p> 
<p>Despite the confusing layout of the line, it is fairly easy to work out 
which way your train is going; for example a northbound Northern Line train to 
Edgware along the Charing Cross branch will be displayed on the indicator as 
'Edgware via ChX' and the on-board PA will announce 'This train terminates at 
Edgware via Charing Cross'. Finally, note that direction signs for the 
platforms indicate the geographical direction of the line,<i>not</i> the last 
stop of the line. Always always advisable to carry a pocket Tube map (available 
for free at most stations) to help you with this.</p> 
<p>Almost all stations have automatic ticket barriers. If you pay by Oyster 
Card, just tap your card against the yellow pad to open the barriers (both upon 
entrance and exit). If you have a paper ticket, insert it face-up into the slot 
on the front of the machine, and remove it from the top to enter the station. 
If you have a single-ticket it will be retained at the exit gate. If you have 
luggage or if your ticket is rejected there is normally a staffed gate as well. 
Paper tickets can be purchased from vending machines in the station lobby. 
There are two types of machine: the older machines that have buttons for 
different fare levels and accept only coins and the new touchscreen machines 
that have instructions in multiple languages, offer a greater choice of ticket 
and accept bills and credit/debit cards (note that if your card has no embedded 
microchip, you cannot use these machines, you pay at the ticket counter).</p> 
<p>Single tickets are charged at a premium (often costing only a little less 
than a 1-day travelcard) of &pound;4 flat fare for journeys within or beyond 
Zone 1 or &pound;3 for journeys outside of Zone 1. Single Oyster fares are 
charged by the number of zones crossed, starting at &pound;2.00 for 1 zone up 
to &pound;4.80 for 6 zones. Paper travel cards valid for 1 day, 3 days or 7 
days are also available and can also be used on buses, National Rail trains, 
the DLR and Croydon Tramlink. They are priced by zones: a 1-day travelcard for 
Zones 1-2 costs &pound;8.40 (day anytime).</p> 
<h3>[edit] By bus</h3> <br>
Double-decker bus in London <br>
Bus stop 
<p>London's iconic red buses are recognized the world over, even if the 
traditional<b>Routemaster</b> buses, with an open rear platform and on-board 
conductor to collect fares, have been phased out. These still run on<b>Heritage 
Route 9</b> and <b>15</b> daily between about 09:30 and 18:30, every 15 
minutes. Buses are generally quicker than taking the Tube for short (less than 
a couple of stops on the Tube) trips, and out of central London you're likely 
to be closer to a bus stop than a tube station. On some busy routes, extra-long 
buses known as &quot;bendy buses&quot; are used. Routes served by these buses 
always carry a yellow route sign as detailed below. Care should be taken as it 
is possible for those unfamiliar with them to get on then have no way of 
paying. This could be related to the relative ease of hopping on and off 
without paying (doors open along the length of the bus and there is no on-board 
conductor). This is, however, illegal and can be very risky - large teams of 
inspectors frequently descend on these buses accompanied by police, and it's 
possible to be arrested and prosecuted. Normally, however, those who get on the 
bus via the doors in the middle will be asked (or rather yelled) to come to the 
front and pay.</p> 
<p>Over 5 million bus trips are made each weekday; with over 700 different bus 
routes you are never far from a bus. Each bus stop has a sign listing routes 
that stop there. Bus routes are identified by numbers and sometimes letters, 
for example the 73 runs between Victoria and Seven Sisters. Yellow signs 
indicate you must purchase your ticket before you board. You must either have a 
Pay-as-you-go Oyster card, travelcard season ticket, bus saver ticket, bus 
pass, or have bought a one way ticket from a machine at the bus stop. These 
machines don't provide change (all the more reason to use one of the other 
options). From age 11 and up you must show an Oyster card on buses, yet 
journeys are free. Student Oysters (only available to students studying in 
London) go up to age 18 and journeys are still free, failure to show an Oyster 
means a &pound;2 fare.</p> 
<p>Buses display their route number in large digits at the front, side and 
rear. All bus stops have their location and the direction of travel on them.</p>
<p>The iBus system has now been rolled out the iBus on every bus and garage in 
London. This new system provides bus times and destination information on a 
audio-visual display.</p> 
<p>Unlike The Tube one way tickets do not allow you to transfer to different 
buses.</p> 
<p>Bus route map </p> 
<h4>[edit] Night bus</h4> 
<p>Standard bus services run from around 06:00-00:30. Around half past 
midnight the network changes to the vast night bus network of well over 100 
routes stretching all over the city. There are two types of night buses: 24 
hour routes and N-prefixed routes.</p> 
<p>24-hour services keep the same number as during the day and will run the 
exact same route, such as the number 88, for example. N-prefixed routes are 
generally very similar to their day-route, but may take a slightly different 
route or are extended to serve areas that are further out. For example, the 29 
bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green during the day; however, the N29 
bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green and on to Enfield.</p> 
<p>Night buses run at a 30 minute frequency at minimum, with many routes at 
much higher frequencies up to every 5 minutes.</p> 
<p>Prices stay the same, and daily travelcards are valid until 04:00 the day 
after they were issued, so can be used on night buses. Most bus stops will have 
night bus maps with all the buses to and from that local area on it, although 
it is good to check on the TfL website beforehand, which also has all those 
maps easily available.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By DLR</h3> 
<p><b>Docklands Light Railway (DLR)</b> is a dedicated light rail network 
operating inEast London, connecting with the tube network at Bank, Tower 
Gateway (close to Tower Hill tube station), Canning Town, Heron Quays (close to 
Canary Wharf tube station) and Stratford. As the trains often operate without a 
driver, it can be quite exciting - especially for children - to sit in front 
and look at through the window, whilst feeling as though one is driving the 
train oneself. The DLR also runs above ground on much of its route, and travels 
through many picturesque parts of London, including the docklands area where 
most of London's skyscrapers are located. Apart from the trains looking 
slightly different and running slightly less frequently than the Tube, visitors 
may as well treat the two systems as the same.</p> 
<p>Unlike the tube, the DLR uses the honor-system at all stations apart from 
Bank and Stratford. Tickets are available from the machines at stations (most 
stations are unstaffed so make sure you are armed with a handful of coins or 
low-denomination notes) and are distance-based. Travelcards are also accepted, 
as are Oyster cards, which must be validated when entering the platform, and 
then validated again when exiting the station.</p> 
<p>The DLR can be a little confusing as the routes are not easily 
distinguished - generally trains run between Bank - Lewisham, Stratford - 
Lewisham, Bank - Woolwich Arsenal, Stratford - Woolwich Arsenal and Tower 
Gateway - Beckton. Displays on the platform will tell you the destination and 
approximate wait for the next 3 trains, and the destination is also displayed 
on the front and side of the train.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By train</h3> 
<p>The British railway system is known as <b>National Rail</b> (although some 
older signs still refer to it as &quot;British Rail&quot;). London's suburban 
rail services are operated by several private companies under tightly-written 
government contracts, and mostly run in the south of the city, away from the 
main tourist sights. Only one line (Thameslink) runs through central London - 
on a north-south axis between London Bridge or Blackfriars stations, and the 
underground level of St Pancras main line station. There is no one central 
station - instead, there are twelve mainline stations dotted around the edge of 
the central area, and most are connected by the Circle line (except Euston, 
Fenchurch St and those South of the river like London Waterloo and London 
Bridge). Most visitors will not need to use National Rail services except for a 
few specific destinations such as Hampton Court, Kew Gardens (Kew Bridge 
station), Windsor Castle, Greenwich or the airports, or indeed if they are 
intending to visit other cities in the UK. Since 2 January 2010, pay-as-you-go 
Oystercards are accepted on all routes within London travel zones 1-6.</p> 
<p>Visitors are well advised to remember that the quickest route between two 
stations might be a combination of the Tube as well as the National Rail 
network. (For example: getting to Wimbledon from central London by Tube using 
the District Line takes significantly longer (around 45 minutes) than taking 
the National Rail service from Waterloo to Wimbledon (around 15 minutes).)</p> 
<p>Airport Express Rail services run to Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton 
airports - tickets are generally sold at a premium and Oystercards not valid.
</p> 
<h3>[edit] By Overground</h3> 
<p>In common parlance, Londoners may refer to travelling by 
&quot;overground&quot; (or &quot;overland&quot;), meaning going by National 
Rail (as opposed to going by Underground). However, only one service is 
officially called Overground -<b>London Overground</b> is a Transport for 
London rail service. It is operated and promoted just like the Underground, 
with the logo like the Tube (except orange) on stations and full acceptance of 
Oystercards. London Overground appears on the Tube map as an orange line, and 
services run acrossNorth London suburbs from east to west. Overground services 
can be a useful shortcut for crossing the city, bypassing the centre, for 
example from Kew Gardens to Camden. London Overground services also connect 
busy Clapham Junction railway station in the Southwest to West London 
(Shepherds Bush and Kensington) and Willesden Junction in the Northwest.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By tram (Tramlink)</h3> 
<p>Tramlink, opened in 2000, is the first modern tram system to operate in 
London. South London is poorly served by the Tube and lacks east-west National 
Rail services so the network connects Wimbledon in South West London to 
Beckenham in South East London and New Addington, a large housing estate in 
South Croydon. The network is centred onCroydon, where it runs on street-level 
tracks around the Croydon Loop.</p> 
<p>Route 3 (Wimbledon to New Addington - green on the Tramlink map) is the 
most frequent service, running every 7 1/2 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime 
and every 15 minutes at all other times. Beckenham is served by Routes 1 and 2 
(yellow and red on the Tramlink map), which terminate at Elmers End and 
Beckenham Junction respectively. Both services travel around the Loop via West 
Croydon and run every 10 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30 
minutes at all other times. Between Arena and Sandilands, these two services 
serve the same stops.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By cycle</h3> 
<p><b> Cycling in the United Kingdom</b> </p>
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cycling on the pavement (sidewalk) is illegal, except where a cycle route 
has been designated by signs or painted lines.</li> 
<li>When cycling on roads, you must ride on the left with other vehicles. </li>
<li>You must have working front and rear lights during hours of darkness. 
Flashing LED lights are legal. Reflective clothing is always a good idea even 
during the day.</li> 
<li>Helmets are not compulsory for cyclists in the United Kingdom, and their 
effectiveness is as much a matter of debate here as anywhere else. In London, 
many cyclists, especially those seen in rush hour, also wear filter masks, but 
their efficacy is even more disputed.</li> 
<li>It is illegal to jump through a red light for cyclists as well as 
motorists. Advance stop lines at traffic lights allow cyclists to wait ahead of 
other traffic at red lights. In practice, most car drivers ignore this and 
occupy the cycle space when waiting at lights.</li> </ul> 
<p>The rules for cyclists are available in the British Government publication 
The Highway Code </p> <br>
<br>

<p>Due to the expense of other forms of transport and the compactness of 
central London, cycling is a tempting option. Excellent free cycle maps[62] can 
be obtained from your local tube stations, bike shop, or ordered online.</p> 
<p>London now offers a city-wide cycle hire scheme, operated by Transport for 
London. For an hourly charge, bicycles may be hired from automated hire 
stations around the city. The bikes, all coloured a distinctive bright blue, 
can be unlocked and ridden around the city with a credit card, and must be 
returned to another hire station by locking the bike into the rack.</p> 
<p>Despite recent improvements, London remains a relatively hostile 
environment for cyclists. London motorists seem reluctant to acknowledge the 
existence of cyclists, especially at busy junctions. The kind of contiguous 
cycle lane network found in many other European cities does not exist. The 
safest option is to stick to minor residential roads where traffic can be 
surprisingly calm outside rush hours.</p> 
<p>Most major roads in London will have a red-route (indicated by red-painted 
tarmac) which is restricted to buses, taxis and bicycles. There are many bus 
stops on red routes, which can present a problem cycling around buses.</p> 
<p>Cycle-lanes exist in London but they are often sporadic at best - usually a 
3-foot wide section of tarmac barely wide enough for one cyclist typically 
indicated by green-painted tarmac. Many improvements have been made for 
cyclists in the city over the last few years, even if they remain no more than 
gestures in most places. Noticeably, there are many new signposted cycle routes 
and some new cycle lanes, not to mention more cyclists since the 2005 public 
transport attacks. A new network of &quot;Cycle super-highways&quot; has 
recently been launched: these are indicated by bright blue-painted tarmac. 
Motor vehicles often park on cycle lanes, rendering them unusable.</p> 
<p>The towpaths in North London along the Grand Union Canal and Regent's Canal 
are the closest thing to a truly traffic-free cycle path in the capital. The 
Grand Union canal connects Paddington to Camden and the Regent's Canal connects 
Camden to Islington, Mile End and Limehouse in East London. It takes about 
30-40min to cycle from Paddington station to Islington along the towpaths. In 
summer they are crowded with pedestrians and not suitable for cycling, but in 
winter or late in the evening they offer a very fast and safe way to travel 
from east to west in North London.</p> 
<p>Care should be taken as to where you choose to park your bike. Many areas, 
some surprisingly busy, attract cycle thieves, while chaining a bicycle to a 
railing which appears to be private property can occasionally lead to said bike 
being removed.</p> 
<p>Taking bikes on trains is very limited in London due to overcrowding. 
Non-folding bikes can be taken only on limited sections of The Tube network, 
mostly only on the above-ground sections outside peak hours. For this reason, 
folding bicycles are becoming increasingly popular. There is a map showing this 
on the Transport for London website. Most<i>National Rail</i> operators allow 
bicycles outside peak hours also.</p> 
<p>Critical Mass London is a cycling advocacy group which meets for regular 
rides through central London at 6PM on the last Friday of each month. Rides 
start from the southern end of Waterloo Bridge.</p> 
<p>The London Cycling Campaign [63] is an advocacy group for London cyclists. 
With active local groups in most of the city's boroughs, it is recognised by 
local and regional government as the leading voice for cycling in the capital.

<h3>[edit] By taxi</h3> <br>
London Cab 
<p>London has two types of taxis: the famous <b>black cab</b>, and so-called 
<b>minicabs</b>. Black cabs are the only ones licensed to 'ply for hire' (ie 
pick people up off the street), while minicabs are more accurately described as 
'private hire vehicles' and need to be pre-booked.</p> 
<p>The famous <b>black cab</b> of London (not always black!) can be hailed 
from the curb or found at one of the many designated taxi ranks. It is possible 
to book black cabs by phone, for a fee, but if you are in central London it 
will usually be quicker to hail one from the street. Their amber TAXI light 
will be on if they are available. Drivers must take an extensive exam in 
central London's streets to be licensed for a black cab, meaning they can 
supposedly navigate you to almost any London street without reference to a map. 
They are a cheap transport option if there are five passengers as they do not 
charge extras, and many view them as an essential experience for any visitor to 
London. Black cabs charge by distance and by the minute, are non-smoking, and 
have a minimum charge of &pound;2.20. Tipping is not mandatory in either taxis 
or minicabs, despite some drivers' expectations..... Use your discretion, if 
you like the service you may tip otherwise don't. Londoners will often just 
round up to the nearest pound.</p> 
<p>Taxis are required by law to take you wherever you choose (within Greater 
London) if their TAXI light is on when you hail them. However some, especially 
older drivers, dislike leaving the centre of town, or going south of the River 
Thames. A good way to combat being left at the side of the curb is to open the 
back door, or even get into the cab, before stating your destination.</p> 
<p><b>Minicabs</b> are normal cars which are licenced hire vehicles that you 
need to book by phone or at a minicab office. They generally charge a fixed 
fare for a journey, best agreed before you get in the car. Minicabs are usually 
cheaper than black cabs, although this is not necessarily the case for short 
journeys. Licensed minicabs display a Transport For London (TFL) License Plate 
- usually in the front window. One of the features of the license plate is a 
blue version of the famous London Underground &quot;roundel&quot;. A list of 
licenced minicab operators can be found at TfL Findaride:[64]. Note that some 
areas in London are poorly serviced by black cabs, particularly late at night. 
This has led to a large number of illegal minicabs operating - just 
opportunistic people, with a car, looking to make some fast money. Some of 
these operators can be fairly aggressive in their attempts to find customers, 
and it's now barely possible to walk late at night through any part of London 
with a modicum of nightlife without being approached. You should avoid 
mini-cabs touting for business off the street and either take a black cab, book 
a licensed minicab by telephone, or take a<b>night bus</b>. These illegal 
drivers are unlicensed and sadly they are often unsafe: a number of women are 
assaulted every week by illegal minicab operators (11 per month).</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Cabwise, Liverpool Station, &#9742; 60835, [65]. 1.30. A free service 
provided by TFL which texts you local licensed minicab numbers. Text CAB to 
60835. Costs the price of a text message. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By car</h3> 
<p>Londoners who drive will normally take public transport in the centre; 
follow their example. Unless you have a disability, there is no good reason 
whatsoever to drive a car in central London.</p> 
<p>Car drivers should be aware that driving into central London on weekdays 
during daylight hours incurs a hefty charge, with very few exemptions (note 
that rental cars also attract the charge). Cameras and mobile units record and 
identify the number plates and registration details of all vehicles entering 
the charging zone with high accuracy. The<b>Central London Congestion Charge</b>
[66] M-F 07:00-18:00 (excluding public holidays) attracts a fee of &pound;8 if 
paid the<b>same day</b>, or &pound;10 if paid on the next charging day. 
Numerous payment options exist: by phone, online, at convenience stores 
displaying the red 'C' logo in the window and by voucher. Failure to pay the 
charge by midnight the next charging day (take note!) incurs a hefty automatic 
fine of &pound;80 (&pound;40 if paid within 2 weeks).</p> 
<p>Despite the Congestion Charge, London - like most major cities - continues 
to experience traffic snarls. These are, of course, worse on weekdays during 
peak commuting hours (i.e. between 07:30-09:30 and 16:00-19:00). At these times 
public transport (and especially the Tube) usually offers the best alternative 
for speed and reduced hassle. Driving in Central London is a slow, frustrating, 
expensive and often unnecessary activity. There are many sorts of automatic 
enforcement cameras and it is difficult (and expensive) to park. A good tip is, 
that outside advertised restriction hours, parking on a<i>single</i> yellow 
line is permissible. Parking on a red line or a<i>double</i> yellow line is 
never permissible and heavily enforced. Find and read the parking restrictions 
carefully! Parking during weekdays and on Saturday can also mean considerable 
expense in parking fees - fees and restrictions are ignored at your extreme 
financial peril - issuing fines, clamping and towing vehicles (without 
warning!) has become a veritable new industry for borough councils staffed by 
armies of traffic wardens.</p> 
<p>For the disabled driving can be much more convenient than using public 
transport. If disabled and a resident of a member state of the EU then two cars 
can be permanently registered, for free, for the congestion charge.</p> 
<p>Motorcycles and scooters are fairly common in London as they can pass 
stationary cars, can usually be parked for free and are exempt from 
congestion-charging. Scooters and bikes with automatic transmission are much 
more preferable - a manually-geared racing bike is completely impractical 
unless you have excellent clutch-control! Likewise to bicycles, car-drivers 
have a disregard to anyone on two wheels and larger vehicles have an unwritten 
priority so take care when crossing junctions. A fully-enclosed crash-helmet is 
mandatory. Parking for bikes is usually free - there are designated 
motorcycle-parking areas on some side-streets and some multi-level parking lots 
will have bike parking on the ground level.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By boat</h3> <br>
A river bus at Tower Millennium Pier 
<p>London is now starting to follow the example of cities such as Sydney and 
Bangkok by promoting a network of river bus and pleasure cruise services along 
the River Thames. London River Services[67] (part of Transport for London) 
manages regular commuter boats and a network of piers all along the river and 
publishes timetables and river maps similar to the famous tube map. While boat 
travel may be slower and a little more expensive than tube travel, it offers an 
extremely pleasant way to cross the city with unrivalled views of the London 
skyline - Big Ben, St Paul's Cathedral, the Tower of London, etc. Sailing under 
Tower Bridge is an unforgettable experience.</p> 
<p>Boats are operated by private companies and they have a separate ticketing 
system from the rest of London transport; however if you have a Travelcard you 
get a 33% discount on most boat tickets. Many boat operators offer their own 
one-day ticket - ask at the pier kiosks. Generally, tickets from one boat 
comapny are not valid on other operators' services. Oyster cards can be used as 
payment for the 'Clipper'-styled commuter services but not for tour boats.</p>

<p>plus all the central London sights in Westminster and the South Bank </p> 
<p>As well as the Thames, consider a trip along an old Victorian canal through 
the leafy suburbs of North London. TheLondon Waterbus Company runs scheduled 
services (more in summer, less in winter) from Little Venice to Camden Lock 
with a stop at the London Zoo (pick up only). The 45-minute trip along Regent's 
Canal is a delightful way to travel.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By skate</h3> 
<p>Inline skating on roads and pavements (sidewalks) is completely legal, 
except in theCity of London (a district). Roads are not the greatest but easily 
skatable. In the centre drivers are more used to skaters than in the outskirts.

<p>London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate 
district articles and only an overview is presented here. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Landmarks</h3> <br>
Buckingham Palace. 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Buckingham Palace</b> - The official London residence of the Queen, 
also inWestminster. Open for tours during the summer months only, but a 
must-see sight even if you don't go in.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> The <b>London Eye</b>. The world's third largest observation wheel, 
situated on theSouth Bank of the Thames with magnificent views over London. 
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Marble Arch</b> is a white Carrara marble monument designed by John 
Nash. It is located in the middle of a huge traffic island at one of the 
busiest intersections in central London where Oxford St meets Park Lane in
Mayfair. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Piccadilly Circus</b> is one of the most photographed sights in 
London. The status of Eros stands proudly in the middle while the north eastern 
side is dominated by a huge, iconic neon hoarding.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>St Paul's Cathedral</b>, also in the City, is Sir Christopher Wren's 
great accomplishment, built after the 1666 Great Fire of London - the great 
dome is still seated in majesty over The City. A section of the dome has such 
good acoustics that it forms a &quot;Whispering Gallery&quot;.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Tower Bridge</b> - Is the iconic 19th century bridge located by the 
Tower of London nearthe City. It is decorated with high towers and featuring a 
drawbridge and you can visit the engine rooms and a Tower Bridge exhibition.
</li> </ul> <br>
St Paul's Cathedral 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Tower of London</b> - Situated just south east of the City, is 
London's original royal fortress by the Thames. It is over 900 years old, 
contains the Crown Jewels, guarded by Beefeaters, and is aWorld Heritage site. 
It is also considered by many to be the most haunted building in the world. If 
you are interested in that sort of thing its definitely somewhere worth 
visiting. Sometimes there are guided ghost walks of the building.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Trafalgar Square</b> - Home of Nelson's Column and the lions, and once 
a safe haven for London's pigeons until the recent introduction of hired birds 
of prey. It recently attracted controversy over the 'Fourth plinth', previously 
empty, being temporarily home to a Marc Quin sculpture, 'Alison Lapper 
Pregnant'. Overlooked by the National Gallery, it's the nearest London has to a 
'centre', and has recently been pedestrianised.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Westminster Abbey</b> and the <b>Palace of Westminster</b> (including 
<b>Big Ben</b> and the <b>Houses of Parliament</b>) in Westminster. The seat of 
the United Kingdom parliament andWorld Heritage site, as well as setting for 
royal coronations since 1066, most recently that of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. 
The Palace of Westminster is open to the public only for viewing parliamentary 
debates, tours of the building are available during July-August when Parliament 
is away on summer recess.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>30 St Mary Axe</b> or <b>The Gherkin</b>, a peculiarly-shaped 180 m- 
(590 ft-) building in the City, which provides a 360-degree view of London on 
the 40th floor.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>The Shard</b>, a futuristic skyscraper due to be topped-out in 2012, 
that already dominates the London skyline and will become the tallest building 
in the EU. When finished this multi-use 310 m (1,017 ft) tower will feature a 
viewing deck on the 72nd floor.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Museums and Galleries</h3> 
<p>London hosts an outstanding collection of world-class <b>museums</b>. Even 
better, it is the only one of the traditional &quot;alpha world cities&quot; 
(London,Tokyo, New York City and Paris) in which the majority of the museums 
have no entrance charges, thus allowing visitors to make multiple visits with 
ease. Although London can be expensive, many of the best museums and galleries 
are free including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>British Museum </li> 
<li>National Gallery </li> 
<li>National Portrait Gallery </li> 
<li>Victoria and Albert Museum </li> 
<li>Natural History Museum </li> 
<li>Tate Modern </li> 
<li>Tate Britain </li> </ul> 
<p>and most museums in Greenwich. Note that admission to many temporary 
exhibitions is not free.</p> 
<p>Aside from these world famous establishments, there is an almost 
unbelievable number of minor museums in London covering a very diverse range of 
subjects. The British government lists over 240 genuine museums in the city.</p>
<h3>[edit] Parks</h3> <br>
St James' Park 
<p>The 'green lungs' of London are the <b>many parks</b>, great and small, 
scattered throughout the city includingHyde Park, St James Park and Regent's 
Park. Most of the larger parks have their origins in royal estates and hunting 
grounds and are still owned by the Crown, despite their public access.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Hyde Park and adjoining Kensington Gardens make up a huge open space in 
central London and are very popular for picnics.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Regent's Park is wonderful open park in the northern part of central 
London.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> St James's Park has charming and romantic gardens ideal for picnics and 
for strolling around. St. James's Park is situated between Buckingham Palace on 
the west and Horse Guards Parade on the east.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Hampstead Heath is a huge open green space in north central London. Not a 
tended park a such and is remarkably wild for a metropolitan city location. The 
views from the Parliament Hill area of the heath south over the city are quite 
stunning.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Richmond Park also is a huge green space, but has a thriving deer 
population that is culled in the spring. Excellent place for cycling.</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li> Bushy Park, near to Hampton Court Palace, is the second-largest park in 
London. More low-key than its larger cousin, Richmond Park, it too has a large 
deer population. Bushy Park contains numerous ponds, bridleways, two 
allotments, and at its northern edge, the National Physical Laboratory.</li> 
</ul> <br>
One of more than 800 Blue Plaques throughout London 
<h3>[edit] Blue Plaques</h3> 
<p>English Heritage runs the Blue Plaques [68] programme in London. Blue 
Plaques celebrate great figures of the past and the buildings that they 
inhabited. These are among the most familiar features of the capital&rsquo;s 
streetscape and adorn the fa&ccedil;ades of buildings across the city. Since 
the first plaque was erected in 1867, the number has grown steadily and there 
are now more than 800. Recipients are as diverse as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 
Sigmund Freud, Charles de Gaulle, Jimi Hendrix and Karl Marx. Look out for 
these around the city.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Do</h2> 
<p>London is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate 
district articles. To make the most of the city's tremendous cultural offerings 
(performing arts, museums, exhibitions, clubs, eateries and numerous others), 
visitors will do well to pick up a copy of a cultural magazine like Time Out 
London (available at most corner shops and newsagents) which gives detailed 
information and critiques on what's around town including show times and 
current attractions. The website[69] also has major shows listed and there is 
also an iPhone/iPod app available though these tend to not be as detailed as 
the print version.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Take a walk through London's <b>Royal Parks</b>. A good walk would start 
at Paddington station, and head through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green 
Park (passing Buckingham Palace) and St James Park before crossing Trafalgar 
Square and the River Thames to theSouth Bank and Waterloo Station. At a 
strolling pace this walk would take half a day, with plenty of places to stop, 
sit, drink, eat en-route. A good pictorial description of this walk can be 
found online at Trips By Trains Royal Parks Walk[70]. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Live Music. London is one of the best cities in the world for concerts, 
spanning from new musical trends to well known bands. Between huge concert 
facilities and small pubs, there are hundreds of venues that organise and 
promote live music every week. Many concerts, especially in smaller or less 
known places are free, so there is plenty of choice even for tourists on a 
budget. London has long been a launchpad for alternative movements, from the 
mods of the 60s, punks of the 70s, new romantics of the 80s, the britpop scene 
of the 90s and in recent years the indie rock movement spearheaded by The 
Libertines and their ilk. It has one of the world's most lively live music 
scenes: any band heading a British, European or World tour will play London, 
not to mention the local talent. London's Music Scene is incredibly diverse, 
covering all genres of music from electro-jazz to death-metal, and all sizes of 
bands, from the U2s and Rolling Stones of the world to one man bands who 
disband after their first gig. This diversity is reflected in prices. As a 
rough guide: &pound;20+ for 'top 40' bands in arena sized venues, &pound;10+ 
for established bands in mid sized venues, &pound;6+ for up and coming bands 
and clubnights in smaller venues, &pound;5- for upstarting bands in bars and 
pubs. London has hundreds of venues spread out over the city and the best way 
to know what's going on where is to browse online ticket agencies[71], music 
magazine's gig directories[72] and bands' myspaces[73]. However, there are a 
few areas which have higher concentrations of pubs and venues than others. 
Kilburn is situated in North West London. It's long been known as an Irish 
area, and though their numbers have somewhat declined any visit to a local pub 
will show their influence remains today. Kilburn's important venue is The Good 
Ship.[74] Due to its inclusive policies and fair payment system, The Good Ship 
is a favorite place for young aspiring bands to try to get a foot off the 
ground. Good for those who would like to see bands &quot;before they were 
big&quot;, who appreciate &pound;5 entrance fees, good beer and friendly staff. 
&nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Theatre. The West End, especially the areas concentrated around Leicester 
Square, Covent Garden, Shaftesbury Avenue and Haymarket, is one of the world's 
premier destinations for theatre, including musical theatre. Covent Garden has 
the only Actor sponsored school in the city called the Actors Centre[75] which 
also gave way to the London Acting Network[76], a London acting community 
support group. In the centre of Leicester Square there is an official half-price
<b>TKTS</b> booth. For up-to-date listings see the weekly magazine <i>Time Out
</i> [77] or check the official London theatreland site [78]. The South Bank is 
another area well-known for world class theatre, and is home to both the 
National Theatre and the Globe Theatre, the latter of which is London's only 
thatched building and an atraction in itself. Each Globe performance has over 
700 &pound;5 tickets. London's theatre scene outside of these two main 
districts is known as &quot;the Fringe&quot;. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Watch a movie. As well as the world-famous blockbuster cinemas in the 
West End, London has a large number of superb art house cinemas. In the summer 
months, there are often outdoor screenings at various venues, such as Somerset 
House and in some of the large parks. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Watch football, [79]. Take in a home match of one of the city's 15+ 
professional football clubs for a true experience of a lifetime as you see the 
passion of the &quot;World's Game&quot; in its mother country. London will have 
five clubs in the top Premier League in the upcoming 2011&ndash;12 
season&mdash;Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham, Queens Park Rangers (QPR) and Tottenham 
Hotspur. A level down, in the Football League Championship, finds Crystal 
Palace, Millwall and West Ham United. Six other clubs are in lower levels of 
the professional league system&mdash;Brentford, Charlton Athletic and Leyton 
Orient in Football League One; and AFC Wimbledon, Barnet and Dagenham &amp; 
Redbridge in Football League Two. Many of the bigger clubs will require booking 
in advance, sometimes many months ahead, but smaller clubs allow you to simply 
turn up on match day and pay at the gate. You<i>will</i> be able to find a 
ticket to a quality football match on any Saturday during the season. &nbsp;edit
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Wimbledon, [80]. Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world 
and is widely considered the most prestigious. Naturally it is a regular 
feature on the Tennis calendar. London goes &quot;tennis crazy&quot; for two 
weeks when the competition commences in late June and early July. &nbsp;edit 
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Open House London Weekend, [81]. Explore many of the city's most 
interesting buildings during the London Open House Weekend - usually held on 
the third weekend of September. During this single weekend, several hundred 
buildings which are not normally open to the public are opened up. See website 
for details of buildings opening in any given year - some buildings have to be 
pre-booked in advance - book early for the popular ones! &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Winter Skating.</b> London has a number of outdoor ice rinks that open 
in the winter months. Considered by some to be somewhat overpriced and 
overcrowded, they nonetheless have multiplied in recent years, easing 
congestion and increasing competition. Most charge from &pound;10-12 (adults) 
for an hour on the ice, including skate hire. See the district articles for the
City of London, East End and Leicester Square. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Summer Skating.</b> In summer (and also in winter, for the more 
dedicated) there is also a thriving roller skating (on inline and traditional 
&quot;quad&quot; skates) scene in London, catering to many disciplines 
including street hockey, freestyle slalom, dance, general recreational skating 
(including three weekly marshalled group street skates) and speed skating. This 
mostly centres around Hyde Park (on the Serpentine Road) and Kensington Gardens 
(by the Albert Memorial). See the district articles forMayfair-Marylebone and 
South West London. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Tours. If you don't feel like splashing out on one of the commercial bus 
tours, you can make your own bus tour by buying an<b>Oyster</b> card and 
spending some time riding around London on the top deck of standard London 
buses. Of course you don't get the open air or the commentary, but the views 
are very similar. You will likely get lost but that is half the fun; if it 
worries you go for a commercial tour. &nbsp;edit </li> 
<li>Spitalfields Markets, 65 Brushfield St London E1 6AA (Straight down Bell 
Lane past 66-68 and keep walking). Visit the thriving old Spitalfields markets 
which were the original London fruit markets. They have a daily market selling 
amazing vintage odds and ends and new fresh clothes! Visit 66/68 Bell Lane 
nearby to see a wealthy merchants house, rumor has it John Lennon once played 
on the roof of this building with Yoko Ono. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul>

<h2>[edit] Learn</h2> 
<p>London attracts more students from overseas than any other city in the 
world, and is home to a huge variety of academic institutions. Its universities 
include some of the oldest and most prestigious in the world.</p> 
<p>Many of the city's most prestigious colleges fall under the auspices of the 
<b>University of London</b> [82] including: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> University College London (UCL), [83]. The first university established 
in London, offering a wide range of courses. UCL academic research is cited 
more than any other university in the UK, and its courses are regarded as 
amongst the best &nbsp;edit </li> 
<li> London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), [84]. The only 
college in the UK focused exclusively on social sciences, whose courses are 
regarded as amongst the very best in the world. Often associated with 
neo-liberal political economic theory. &nbsp;edit </li>

<ul> 
<li> Other institutions include <b>Imperial College London</b> [89], the UK's 
leading university specialising in sciences and<b>University of the Arts London
</b> [90] for courses in art, design and media. </li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>[edit] Learn English</h3> 
<p>London is a natural place to learn and improve spoken and written English. 
There are a huge range of options, from informal language exchange services to 
evening classes and formal language schools. There are a number of unaccredited 
schools charging hefty fees and offering qualifications that are viewed as 
worthless. If choosing a course from a privately-run school or college, it is 
important to ensure the institution is accredited by the British Council.</p> 
<p>Some links to British Council accredited schools: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> Linguaenglish London, [91]. Lingua London is a family-run English 
language school and has been teaching English only courses in London for over 
10 years. &nbsp;edit </li> 
<li> Language in London, [92]. This is the first school in the world to win 
the British Council prize for innovation in English teaching. Located in

<li> Rose of York, [93]. Rose of York has been teaching English language 
courses for over 21 years and they offer full-time, intensive or part-time 
English courses &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Work</h2> 
<p>London is one of the world's leading financial centres and so professional 
services is the main area of employment, although this sector has been hit hard 
by the global financial crisis. As of Mid 2010, the job market in London has 
recovered somewhat, it is best to check with recruiters and staffing agencies.
</p> 
<p> London is hugely popular as a working holiday destination - work in bars 
and the hospitality industry is relatively easy to find.</p> 
<p>Wages are generally higher in London than the rest of the UK, although the 
cost of living is higher still.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Buy</h2> <br>
Harrods 
<p>London is also one of the world's most fashion conscious cities, which 
explains the abundance of clothing shops from the flagship shops ofOxford Street
 to the tiny boutiques ofBrick Lane. </p> 
<p>Though not particularly known for bargain shopping, nearly anything you 
could possibly want to buy is available in London. In Central London, the main 
shopping district is the West End (Bond St, Covent Garden, Oxford St and Regent 
St). On Thursdays many West End stores close later than normal (19:00-20:00).
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Oxford Street</b>. Main shopping street home to flagship branches of 
all the major British high street retailers in one go including Selfridges[94], 
John Lewis[95] (includes a food hall), Marks &amp; Spencer [96] and other 
department stores. Really overcrowded and has pretty ordinary shops actually.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Regent Street</b> (between Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus). 
Includes such gems as Hamleys, considered to be London's flagship toy store, on 
seven levels, and the London Apple Store.</li> </ul>

designer interior stores such as Heals, whilst the southern end is famous for 
its large concentration of hi-fi, computer and electronics stores.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Covent Garden</b> [97]. Fashionable area home to quaint outlets and 
relatively expensive designer stores. Around Seven Dials chains include Adidas 
Originals, All Saints, Carhartt, Fred Perry, G Star Raw and Stussy. For shoes 
head for Neal St. Also the London Transport Museum whose gift shop has some of 
the best souvenirs in the city (old maps, vintage Tube posters, etc). But the 
vendors are now not allowed to sell merchandise with Union Jacks on. Sad.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Charing Cross Road</b> (near Covent Garden). A book lovers haven! New, 
second-hand, antiquarian and specialist.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Soho</b> . Offers alternative music and clothes. Now home to Chappell 
of Bond St's historic music shop.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Camden Town</b>. Alternative clothing and other alternative shopping,

with trendy restaurants, jewellers and speciality shops including the world 
famous trademark Fortuny[99], . </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Westminster</b>. Some of the world's most famous shirts are made on 
Jermyn St. Savile Row is home to some of the world's best men's bespoke tailors 
including Henry Poole, Gieves &amp; Hawkes, H. Huntsman &amp; Sons, Dege &amp; 
Skinner and many other.</li> </ul> 
<p>Westfield: In Shepherd's Bush. Hard to miss. Has designer shops in with the 
more affordable chain shops. It's the biggest shopping centre in Europe. Has 
lots of good places to eat. It can get very busy on weekends though. Has it's 
own train station.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Markets</h3> 
<p>Borough (tube: London Bridge) [100] is a great (if expensive) food market, 
offering fruit, veg, cheese, bread, meat, fish, and so on, much of it organic. 
Th-Sa (best to go in the morning, since it gets unpleasantly crowded by around 
11:00).</p> 
<p>Old Spitalfields Market [101] is an excellent market for clothes from 
up-and-coming designers, records, housewares, food, and all things trendy, it 
was once the London fruit markets. Find it at 65 Brushfield St London E1 6AA 
(Straight down Bell Lane past 66-68 and keep walking). Visit 66/68 Bell Lane 
nearby to see a wealthy merchants house, rumor has it John Lennon once played 
on the roof of this building with Yoko Ono. Also checkoutBrick Lane, Greenwich 
andPortobello, [102]. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Airports</h3> 
<p>Tax-free shops in airports are not strong in variety, prices are equal to 
London, and they close rather early as well. Shop listings at airport web sites 
can help to plan your tax-free (vs traditional) shopping. In the evening allow 
extra half an hour as closing hours are not always strictly respected.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Eat</h2> This guide uses the following price ranges 
for a typical meal<i>for one</i>, including soft drink: <br>
<b>Budget</b>  
Below &pound;15 <br>
<b>Mid-range</b>  &pound;15-50 <br>
<b>Splurge</b>  
&pound;50+ <br>
<br>

<p><b>Smoking Ban</b> </p>
<p>Smoking is banned in all UK pubs and restaurants. </p> <br>
<br>

<p>It is a huge task for a visitor to find the 'right place' to eat in London 
- with the 'right atmosphere', at the 'right price' - largely because, as in 
any big city, there are literally thousands of venues from which to choose, 
ranging from fast food joints, pubs, and mainstream chains all the way up to 
some of the most exclusive restaurants in the world which attract the kind of 
clientele that don't need to ask the price. Sorting the good from the bad isn't 
easy, but London has something to accommodate all budgets and tastes. Following 
is a rough guide to what you might get, should you fancy eating out:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Up to &pound;5</b> - you can get a good English pub or cafeteria 
breakfast with a rack of bacon, beans in tomato sauce, egg, sausage, orange 
juice and coffee or tea. Most pubs stop this offer at 11:00, but there are 
literally hundreds of backstreet cafes (collquially known as &quot;greasy 
spoons&quot;) which will serve this sort of food all day.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;7</b> - will buy you a couple of sandwiches and a soft drink, 
some takeaway fish and chips, or a fast food meal. There are also a number of 
mostly Chinese restaurants which serve an all you can eat buffet for around 
this price. These are dotted about the West End and it is well worth asking a 
member of public or a shopkeeper where the nearest one is. These restaurants 
make much of their revenue on drinks although these are usually still 
moderately priced. The food whilst not being of the finest standard is usually 
very tasty and the range of dishes available is excellent. There are literally 
thousands of so called takeaways in London and a cheap alternative to a 
restaurant meal. Check with your hotel management if they allow food deliveries 
before ordering in. Most takeaways will offer some form of seating, but not all 
do.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;6-10</b> - will get you a good pub meal and drink or a good 
Chinese/Indian/Italian/Thai/Vietnamese buffet. Be aware that many pubs have a 
buy-one-get-one-free offer, and you can either order two main dishes for 
yourself or bring a friend.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;15</b> - some more expensive French, Mediterranean and 
international restaurants do cheaper two or three course lunch menus.</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;25</b> - offers you a lot more choice. You can have a good 
meal, half a bottle of wine and change for the tube home. There are plenty of 
modest restaurants that cater for this bracket.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>&pound;50 (to almost any amount!)</b> - with more money to spend you 
can pick some of the city's finer restaurants. It may be a famous chef (like 
Michel Roux, Jr or Gordon Ramsay) or simply a place that prides itself on using 
the finest ingredients. Worth the splurge to impress a special someone. Note 
that these establishments often need to be booked well in advance, and most 
will enforce a dress code of some sort, like<b>Rules</b> of Covent Garden, the 
oldest resturant still extant.</li> </ul> 
<p>Prices inevitably become inflated at venues closest to major tourist 
attractions - beware the so-called tourist traps. The worst tourist trap food 
is, in the opinion of many Londoners, is served at the various steak houses 
(Angus Steak House, Aberdeen Steak House etc - they are all dotted around the 
West End and near to the main train stations). Londoners wouldn't dream of 
eating here - you shouldn't either! Notorious areas for inflated menu prices 
trading on travellers' gullibility and lack of knowledge are the streets around 
the British Museum, Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus. Even the major fast 
food chains charge a premium in their West End outlets - so watch out.</p> 
<p>Pubs within the touristy areas of London are usually a poor choice for food 
although there are some brilliant 'gastro-pubs' hidden away - use the internet 
or a good guide (such as Time Out) to find them. In general avoid all pubs that 
have graphic-designed and printed menus - it's peoples experiences in these 
kind of places that gives Britain a bad name for food! Look around you - see 
any locals tucking in? No? - then you shouldn't either. The other rule to 
follow when avoiding poor food is the same as in any other part of Europe - is 
the menu available in multiple languages? If yes then start running!!</p> 
<p>In the suburbs, the cost of eating out is reduced drastically. Particularly 
in large ethnic communities, there is a competitive market which stands to 
benefit the consumer. In East London for example, the vast number of chicken 
shops means that a deal for 2 pieces of chicken, chips (fries) and a drink 
shouldn't cost you more than &pound;3 especially on<b>Brick Lane</b>. Another 
good (and cheap) lunch option is a chicken or lamb doner (gyro) at many outlets 
throughout the city, though meat quality is often poor.</p> 
<p>For more authentic Cockney food, try <b>pie and mash</b>, which originates 
from the working-class in the East End.[103] Usually minced beef and cold water 
pastry pie served with mashed potato, mushy peas and 'liquour' gravy, it tastes 
a lot better then it sounds. Some of the best pie houses are<b>M. Manze</b> in 
Peckham or<b>F. Cooke</b> in Hackney Broadway Market.[104] Water Souchet and 
London Particular (green-pea and ham) are classic Cockney soups, though hard to 
find on menus. For those game,<b>jellied eels</b>, pickled-cockles and whelks 
are all traditional London seafood.[105] </p> 
<p>Tipping may also be different than what you're used to. All meals include 
the 20% VAT tax and some places include a service fee (10-12%). The general 
rule is to leave a tip for table service, unless there's already a service 
charge added or unless the service has been notably poor. The amount tipped is 
generally in the region of 10%, but if there's a figure between 10 and 15% 
which would leave the bill at a conveniently round total, many would consider 
it polite to tip this amount. Tipping for counter service, or any other form of 
service, is unusual - but some choose to do so if a tips container is provided.
</p> 
<h3>[edit] Restaurant streets</h3> 
<p>Whilst central London is full of restaurants and cafes it is useful for the 
visitor to be aware that there are some areas where the majority of diners are 
Londoners, rather than tourists, and in general you will get a much more 
pleasant, better value, and less crowded eating experience than you will find 
in the West End. These places are best visited in the evenings.</p> 
<p><b>Upper Street</b> Head to Highbury &amp; Islington (Victoria line) or 
Angel (Northern line). Dozens of excellent restaurants, popular with young 
professionals.</p> 
<p><b>Drummond Street</b> in the Euston area has a fine mix of Indian 
restaurants - a short walk from Euston railway station.</p> 
<p><b>Clapham Junction</b> is not just a train station - but also home to many 
good restaurants and bars, in particular on Lavender Hill and Battersea Rise</p>
<p><b>Lordship Lane</b> in the southern suburbs - head to East Dulwich station 
- a good selection of european restaurants and a few award winning gastropubs
</p> 
<p><b>High Street Croydon</b> Croydon is derided by most Londoners as the end 
of the earth, however this suburban gem of a road has at least 30 decent 
restaurants, including three Argentinians, a South African curryhouse, a couple 
of fancy modern European brassieres, and just about every over type of cuisine 
you can think of. Sadly chain restaurants are moving in (Zizzi's, Pizza 
Express) but most of the places are still independent. Get a quick train to 
East Croydon station from Victoria or London Bridge.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Restaurants</h3> 
<p>As one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities, you can find restaurants 
serving food cuisine from nearly every country, some of it as good as, if not 
better than in the countries of origin.</p> 
<p>Indian food in London is especially famous and there is hardly a district 
without at least one notable Indian restaurant.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for other particular regional foods these tend to be 
clustered in certain areas and<i>some</i> examples are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Brick Lane in the East End is famous for Bangladeshi curries. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Brixton for African/Caribbean. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Chinatown just off Leicester Square for Chinese. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Edgware Road in Marylebone and Paddington is popular for Middle Eastern 
cuisine.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Drummond Street (just behind Euston railway station in the London/Camden 
district) has lots of vegetarian restaurants - mostly Indian.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Golders Green for Jewish fare. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Kingsland Road for good cheap Vietnamese. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Finsbury Park and nearby areas for Greek and Turkish. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Tooting, East Ham, Wembley and Southall for authentic &amp; cheap Indian 
eateries including authentic South Indian restaurants serving hot pongal, 
dosas, idlis and other South Indian &quot;tiffin&quot; items.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Kings Street this extends on to Chiswick High Road from Hammersmith Tube 
Station and is one long road of a choice of restaurants at very reasonable 
prices, some bargain mentions are the Thai restaurants offering 2 course lunch 
for &pound;7. Nearby Shepherds bush is about a 15min walk and is alive with 
bars and pubs in the evening.</li> </ul> 
<p>Other nationalities are equally represented and randomly dotted all over 
London. It is usually wisest to eat in restaurants on main thoroughfares rather 
than on quiet backstreets.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Chains</h3> 
<p>Like other capitals in the world, London has the usual array of fast food 
outlets. Sandwich shops are the most popular places to buy lunch, and there are 
a lot of places to choose from including Eat and Pret a Manger. Some 
Italian-style sandwich shops have a very good reputation and you can identify 
them easily by looking at the long queues at lunchtime. If all else fails, 
Central London has lots of mini-supermarkets operated by the big British 
supermarket chains (e.g. , Sainsbury's, Tesco) where you can pick up a 
pre-packed sandwich.</p> 
<p>Fast food with an Asian flair is easy to find throughout the city, with 
lots of Busaba Eathai, Wagamama, and Yo! Sushi locations throughout the city. 
Nando's has spicy peri peri style grilled chicken.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Vegetarian</h3> 
<p>London has plenty of vegetarian-only restaurants many of them championing 
organic foodstuffs, and a quick search in Google will produce plenty of ideas, 
so you never have to see a piece of cooked meat all week.</p> 
<p>If you are dining with carnivorous friends most restaurants will cater for 
vegetarians and will have at least a couple of dishes on the menu. 
Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants are generally fruitful, as they have plenty of 
traditional dishes (good Indian/Bangladeshi options can be found in the Brick 
Lane area of Spitalfields or further afeild in East Ham, Tooting Broadway and 
Southall. These also tend to be very cheap eats with authentically prepared 
dishes with a true local ambience). There are also many vegetarian Thai buffet 
places where you can eat fake meat in tooth-achingly sweet sauces for under 
&pound;5. These can be found on Greek and Old Compton Sts inSoho and Islington 
High Street. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Religious</h3> 
<p>Due to the mix of cultures and religions, many London restaurants cater 
well for religious dietary requirements. The most common signs are for Halal 
and Kosher meat, from burger joints to nice restaurants. There are lots of 
Halal restaurants[106] and shops all over London including Whitechapel Rd and 
Brick Lane inthe East End, Bayswater, Edgware Rd and Paddington and in many 
parts ofnorth London. There are plenty of Kosher restaurants in Golders Green, 
Edgware and Stamford Hill. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Convenience stores and supermarkets</h3> 
<p>Convenience stores such as Tesco Metro, Sainsbury Central/Local, Budgens, 
Costcutter, SPAR, Somerfield as well as privately-run 'corner shops' sell 
pre-made sandwiches, snacks, alcohol, cigarettes, drinks etc. Most are open 
from 05:00-23:00 although some such as Tesco Metro or convenience stores 
located at petrol stations may open 24 hours although they will stop selling 
alcohol after 23:00. Be aware that Whistlestop convenience stores (located in 
or around train stations) are notoriously overpriced and should be avoided. If 
using a petrol-station convenience store late at night (i.e. after 23:00) the 
store will be locked and you should order and pay through the external service 
window.</p> 
<p>Full-size superstores such as Tesco, Asda and Morrisons are rare in the 
city centre and usually require a 15-20 min tube ride to reach them. One of the 
closest is the ASDA store close to Crossharbour DLR Station on the Lewisham 
line - about 15-minute ride from Bank Station or at the end of the 135 24-hour 
bus line. There is also a Tesco in the Surrey Quays shopping mall which is next 
to Canada Water station on the Jubilee line - again about 10-15 minutes from 
the centre of town. If you plan on buying lots of groceries it's worth the trip 
as prices are much lower than in any downtown supermarkets.</p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Drink</h2> 
<p>London is home to a great many pubs, bars and nightclubs. The online city 
guide<i>View London</i> [107] and the weekly magazine <i>Time Out</i> [108] can 
inform you of what's going in London's night life, as well as with cultural 
events in general.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Pubs &amp; bars</h3> 
<p>London is an expensive place and your drink is likely to cost more than its 
equivalent elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Expect to pay around &pound;4 for a 
pint of lager or Guinness (or around &pound;3.50 for a pint of ale) in an 
average pub, but be aware that as with restuarants, pubs close to major tourist 
attractions cash in on travellers' gullibility so be on your guard for the 
tourist traps where higher prices are not unheard of. Despite this however it<i>
is</i> still possible to find a sub-&pound;3 pint in central London - it takes 
some determination. If you're looking to save money and meet travellers then 
pub crawls are guided tours that run nightly in central London. You'll save the 
ticket price on the savings you get from discounted drink deals and what you 
would have spent on club entry. The &quot;1 Big Night Out&quot; pub crawl is 
the biggest operator and starts from near Leicester square underground station.
</p> 
<p>Many local pubs, especially those run by chains like Wetherspoons and 
Scream tend to be more reasonably priced with good drink promotions on weekday 
nights and during the day. As with the rest of the UK, chain pubs abound which 
Londoners tend to avoid like the plague. A good place to get cheap beer is at 
any one of the Sam Smith's run pubs that are dotted around Soho and north of 
Oxford Street. These pubs are good traditional boozers which are frequented by 
the local working population and odd celeb.</p> 
<p>In the Bloomsbury area, check out <b>The Court</b> (near the north end of 
Tottenham Court Road) and<b>The Rocket</b> (Euston Road). Both are fairly cheap 
to drink at, given that they cater for students of the adjacent University 
College London. Directly opposite theBritish Library is <b>The Euston Flyer</b>
, popular with locals and commuters alike given its close proximity toSt 
Pancras International railway station. </p> 
<p>Classier bars and pubs can be much more expensive. However, the cost of 
alcohol drops significantly the further away you go from the centre (though be 
aware thatWest London tends to be an exception, with prices pretty much the 
same as the centre).</p> 
<p>Two important endemic London breweries are Young's and and Fullers. Young's 
was founded inWandsworth in 1831 (but has recently relocated to Bedford) and 
nowadays it boasts 123 pubs in central London alone.<b>The Founder's Arms</b> 
on theSouth Bank is one of the brewery's most well known establishments. 
Fullers was founded a bit later in 1845 at Chiswick (where you can take a most 
enjoyable tour of the brewery, including beer-tasting) and the jewel in its 
crown is probably the Grade I listed<b>Old Bank Of England</b> on Fleet Street, 
thanks to its breath-taking interiors. Fuller's flagship beer is the famous 
'London Pride', however to try a truly authentic Cockney pint, ask at bars if 
they serve a seldom seen now<b>Porter</b>, a dark style of beer originating in 
London in the 18th Century, similar but less heavy then a<b>Stout</b>. For a 
different taste, try<b>London Gin</b>, a popular type of spirit, often mixed 
with tonic water, (and a slice of lemon) to make G &amp; T's.</p> 
<p>It's hard to say which pub in London is truly the oldest but it's easy to 
find contenders for the title. Many pubs were destroyed in the Great Fire of 
London &ndash; indeed, Samuel Pepys supposedly watched the disaster from the 
comfort of<b>the Anchor</b> in Borough. Pubs were rebuilt on sites that claimed 
to have been working pubs since the 13th century.<b>Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese</b> 
inFleet Street is on the site of an old monastery and its cellar dates back to 
the 13th century. The<b>Princess Louise</b> and <b>Citty of York</b> are two 
lovely pubs close by, along High Holborn with interesting decor; as is the<b>
Jerusalem Tavern</b> of Farringdon, a converted Georgian coffee shop, which 
sells the Norfolk beer, St. Peters.<b>The Royal Oak</b> of Borough, is another 
pub which is the only representative of an out-of-town brewery in London, that 
of Harvey's of Lewes. The food is fantastic as is the atmosphere. Those 
interested in London's historic and literary connections can't miss<b>The 
Spaniard's Inn</b> in Hampstead. Dick Turpin is said to have been born here; 
John Keats and Charles Dickens both drank here; it's mentioned in Dickens'<i>
The Pickwick Papers</i>and Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>. The Goose at Catford, 
was reputedly a favourite of Karl Marx.</p> 
<p>For the best view in the city, try pubs on the banks of the Thames. The 
South Bank has lots of good bars with plenty of iconic bridges and buildings in 
sight the cocktail bar in the OXO tower is a secret that most tourists walk by 
everyday. Heading towardsBermondsey, pub crowds become a little less touristy. 
</p> 
<p>If you're after gastropubs, you may like to visit London's first, <b>The 
Eagle</b>, in Clerkenwell, established in 1991. You can also try Time Out's 
favourite newcomer,<b>The Princess Victoria</b> on Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's 
Bush. </p> 
<p>Wine buffs can enjoy the famous <b>Davys</b> wine bars that dot the city. 
The company, established in 1870, import wines and own over thirty bars in the 
centre. Other big names in wine include the Michelin-starred<b>Cellar Gascon</b>
 and<b>Vinoteca</b>, both in Smithfield. For a posh wine tasting experience, 
there is<b>Vinopolis</b> by Borough Market, though a tour price will be as 
eye-watering as the produce sampled.</p> 
<p>Big hotels, such as The Dorchester and The Ritz, and upmarket clubs around 
Leicester Square and Soho are reliable bets for a date at the bar. The 
Connaught Hotel inMayfair-Marylebone boasts its house bar, plus the Time Out 
favourite, The Coburg. Still in Mayfair, The Polo Bar at The Westbury is very 
intimate.</p> 
<p>You can rely on most up-and-running bars to offer a short cocktail menu and 
there are also bars that position themselves as cocktail specialists.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Nightclubs</h3> 
<p>Nightlife is an integral part of London life and there are countless 
nightclubs in and around Central London with music to suit even the most 
eclectic of tastes. Districts in London tend to specialize to different types 
of music.</p> 
<p>The Farringdon/Hoxton/Shoreditch area has many clubs playing drum and bass, 
house and trance music and is home to the superclub Fabric. The clubs in this 
area are often home to the world's top DJ's and attracts a lively, hip and 
friendly crowd.</p> 
<p>The area around Mayfair is home to the more upmarket clubs in London. This 
area attracts a rather more showy crowd who love to flaunt what they have and 
is a must go to celebrity spot. Beware that drinks are ridiculously expensive 
and many clubs operate a guestlist-only policy. Music played here is often of 
the commercial chart, funky house, hip hop and R&amp;B genre. Notable clubs 
include China White, Luxx, Maddox, Jalouse, Funky Buddha, Whisky Mist, Mahiki, 
No 5 Cavendish Square, Embassy, Vendome and Maya.</p> 
<p>Nightclubs around the Leicester Square area hold the same music policy, but 
are rather more accessible, with numerous club and pub crawl promoters 
scattered around the area offering deals on entry. Notable clubs are Cafe De 
Paris, 1 Big Night Out pub crawl, Penthouse, Sound, Tiger Tiger, Zoo bar and 
Ruby Blue.</p> 
<p>The Camden area is home to clubs which play Indie, metal and rock music and 
notably the Electric Ballroom, the world famous Koko (Fridays) and Underworld, 
however be aware that Camden clubs are mostly shut (or empty) on the weekdays.
</p> 
<h3>[edit] Gay and lesbian</h3> 
<p>London has a vibrant gay environment with countless bars, clubs and events 
in almost every district in the city.</p> 
<p>The nucleus of London's gay scene is undoubtedly Old Compton St and the 
surrounding area inSoho but over the last couple of years Vauxhall has seen a 
boom in Gay venues. You will find that many areas, particularly inCamden Town 
andShoreditch, that straight bars will have a mixed clientele. To find out what 
is going on during your visit, you can check:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> qmagazine.com [109] a weekly magazine that comprehensively covers the 
London gay scene with handy night by night listings available on-line and in 
print</li> 
<li> Boyz Magazine [110] which is published fortnightly and is freely 
available at most London gay venues, and contains listings of everything that 
is happening in all the major clubs in London and the South East.</li> </ul> 
<p>Please note that the borough of Hackney is developing a reputation of being 
not gay friendly, having recently passed legislation that could lead to the 
closure of the boroughs sole LGBT bookshop and community resource. It is 
expected that the business 'Expectations' will close by the end of March 2011.
</p> 
<p><b>Gay Pride</b> [111] is held every year in June with parade and street 
parties. The choice of places to go sometimes seem to be unmanageable.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> London Gay and Lesbian Switchboard (LLGS), &#9742; +44 20 7837 7324 (
admin@llgs.org.uk), [112]. This voluntary service has been operating since <i>
1974</i> and as well as providing counselling they offer an incredibly thorough 
information service about Gay events, accommodation and businesses in London. 
&nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Sleep</h2> This guide uses the following price ranges 
for a standard<i>double</i> room: <br>
<b>Budget</b>  Under &pound;70 <br>
<b>
Mid-range</b>  &pound;70 to &pound;140 <br>
<b>Splurge</b>  Over &pound;140 <br>
<br> 
<p>London has hundreds of options for accommodation to suit all budgets from 
hostels through historic bed and breakfasts (B&amp;Bs), mainstream chain hotels 
and apartments all the way to some of the most exclusive luxury hotels in the 
world such as The Savoy, The Ritz and Claridges where a stay in a top suite 
will cost upwards of &pound;1,000 per night. The average cost of hotel 
accommodation in London is higher than in any other major British city. Prices 
invariably become inflated close to major sporting tournaments (such as the 
London Marathon, Wimbledon or major England football/rugby fixtures), or other 
important events taking place in the city - so it pays to plan your trip around 
such occasions or book your accommodation well in advance.</p> 
<p>In general, most people tend to stay within &quot;Zone 1&quot; of the 
underground, however do your research carefully - sometimes being that extra 
five minutes away from a station can make the difference in cost and quality 
and local food and drinking options. In any case, you can always catch a bus 
anyway - by the far the best way to see the city and get about generally.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Hotels</h3> 
<p>Your budget will have a lot to do with what part of London you will want to 
stay in. Tourist-standard prices range from &pound;20-200 per person per night. 
Expect smaller than average rooms especially at the low end of this range. As a 
general rule, expect to pay between &pound;75-150 per night for a 2 or 3 star 
hotel in the central area of the city. Many of the big name chain hotels now 
offer substantial discounts (with rates often down as low as 
&pound;30-&pound;50 per room per night) if you book well in advance, but the 
drawback is that you have to pay the full amount upfront at the time of booking 
and there are no refunds if you cancel. The heart of the West End is the most 
expensive place to stay and most hotels are either 4 or 5 star and most will 
command a hefty price premium.</p> 
<p>The City can also be very expensive during the week, as it relies heavily 
on the business market but prices often drop over the weekend and it can be a 
good way of getting into a higher standard of accommodation than you could 
otherwise afford. Bear in mind though that this part of central London becomes 
a ghost town over the weekend, and you will find that few (if any) bars and 
restaurants will be open.</p> 
<p>A top tip however is to always check the likes of LondonTown.com, Expedia 
and LateRooms as well as the hotel's own website - since there are often deals 
to be had which can reduce the costs significantly.</p> 
<p>The extra cost of getting around is probably not significant compared to 
savings made by staying in a hotel further out. With the excellent Tube system 
where you stay won't limit what you see. Always be sure though to check where 
the closest tube station is to your hotel. Staying further out will be cheaper 
but when travelling in allow 1-2 min per tube stop (near the centre), around 
2-3 min per stop (further out) and 5-10 min per line change. This can easily 
total up to a 1 hour journey if there is a walk at each end.</p> 
<p>A more imaginative alternative could be to stay in a nearby town with quick 
and easy train travel to London. For example, livelyBrighton (otherwise known 
as 'London by Sea') is only an hour away, but your budget will go much further 
and there are excellent accommodation options.</p> 
<p>Some of the better value options are to be found in the following central 
districts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Bloomsbury. Relatively quiet district with a wide range of accommodation, 
and has enjoyed a surge in popularity following Eurostar's move to St Pancras 
International station. Cartwright Gardens features a dozen small B&amp;Bs in 
historic houses. Many budget options are located on Argyle Square (just off the 
Euston Road). Gets a little seedy towards and beyond King's Cross railway 
station.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Earl's Court and West Kensington in west central London. Budget and 
modest accommodation as well as good 4-star hotels. Be careful with the 
cheapest accommodation in this area though as it will likely be very seedy 
indeed.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Paddington and Bayswater in north west central London. Has undergone a 
lot of change recently largely resulting from the Heathrow Express train coming 
into Paddington station. Good hotels can be found in the immediate area of the 
station and in quieter spots a short walk away as well as in the traditional 
mid-range accommodation area further south in Bayswater.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Westminster. Lots of small B&amp;Bs around the back of Victoria railway 
station in the Pimlico area.</li> </ul> 
<p>A slightly left-field option is to check the Landmark Trust [113], a 
building preservation charity who purchase notable old buildings in the UK, 
renovate and run them as holiday lettings. An interesting approach to saving 
old buildings for sure.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Hostels</h3> 
<p>Not necessarily as unpleasant as you may think, and as long as you don't 
mind sharing with others, they are the most cost-effective option and also 
offer breakfast as well as kitchens for self catering. The &quot;official&quot;
<b>Youth Hostel Association of England and Wales</b> [114] (YHA) operates five 
hostels in Central London. Like everything else, you should book online well in 
advance - the hostels usually fill up on Friday and Saturday nights about 14 
days before. A top tip is don't be put off if there is no availability left 
online, phone the hostel in question to see if there are still beds available 
or if there has been a cancellation. Some of the YHA's properties also offer a 
limited number of private family rooms - expect to pay around &pound;60 per 
night.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that for foreign visitors, the YHA hostels will require to see 
a form of ID (a passport or national identity card) and a valid membership card 
from a local YHI (Youth Hostelling International)-recognised Youth Hostel 
association. For British visitors, a valid YHA (SYHA for Scotland) membership 
card is all that's required. For all non-YHI members, the YHA will levy a 
&pound;3 welcome stamp per day.</p> 
<p>There are a number of other, independent hostels throughout the city and 
these are listed in the relevant district articles.</p> 
<p>In the summer season, many of the colleges and universities in Central 
London open up their<b>student halls of residence</b> as hotels during 
vacations, at usually much lower rates than proper hotels, but expect very 
basic facilities (e.g. communal bathrooms, no catering facilities), but you 
will get the personal privacy that you don't get in hostels for not very much 
more cost. London University vacation accommodation providers include;UCL 
Residences LSEVactions, TravelStay.com and Cortisso. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Apartments</h3> 
<p>Some apartment-hotels offer good value accommodation for those travelling 
in a group - often better quality than many hotels but at a cheaper individual 
rate per person.</p> 
<p>Capsule-style crash spaces are just arriving, but currently these are only 
in central locations.</p> 
<p>Short-term apartment or flat rentals are an attractive option for many 
travelers to London, and there are innumerable agencies offering them, almost 
all of them nowadays through the internet. A key consideration for renting a 
short term flat is if you are visiting in a large group or a family. In such 
cases a short stay in London can be more affordable compared to staying in a 
hotel. Your best protection is to deal only with London apartment rental 
agencies which have been recommended by independent sources you feel you can 
trust, and to deal only with those that accept confirmations via credit card.
</p> 
<h2>[edit] Contact</h2> 
<h3>[edit] Wi-Fi access</h3> 
<p>London is unfortunately not noted for free public wifi access - although 
the number of hotspots is continuing to grow.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Online-4-Free.com, [115]. One of the most promising (it seems) for 
traveller-frequented areas, a service that provides blanket coverage along the 
banks of the River Thames (and some surrounding streets) from Millbank down to 
Greenwich Pier, and a small 'cloud' in Holborn - the free service asks only 
that you view a short advertisement every half hour in order to get 256 kbps 
(higher rates and ad-free come at a small charge). Free. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Tate Modern, [116]. Offering for a trial period free wi-fi internet 
access. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> British Library, [117]. Offers free internet access throughout the 
library with registration. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Royal Festival Hall at Southbank Centre, [118]. Offers free unencrypted 
wi-fi throughout the building without registration. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<p>Another good place for free wi-fi would be McDonald's, where free 24-hour 
period wi-fi are offered to customers. Starbucks offers free wi-fi for 
customers registering their prepaid Starbucks Card. Furthermore, Pret-A-Manger 
franchises offer free internet without a login.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Stay safe</h2> 
<p>In an emergency, telephone &quot;999&quot; (or &quot;112&quot;). This 
number connects to Police, Ambulance and Fire/Rescue services. You will be 
asked which of these three services you require before being connected to the 
relevant operator.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Crime</h3> 
<p>Like many big cities, London has a variety of social problems, especially 
begging, drug abuse and theft (mobile phones are a favourite, often snatched by 
fast-moving cyclists).</p> 
<p>London has the oldest police force in the world, The Metropolitan Police 
Service[119], and on the whole, London is a safe place to visit and explore. 
Alongside the regular Police, there are over 4,000 Police Community Support 
Officers (PCSOs) that provide a highly visible presence on the streets and are 
able to deal with low-level crime. Normal precautions for the safe keeping of 
your personal possessions, as you would in any other city, are suggested.</p> 
<p>Crime mapping has been launched in London allowing residents and visitors 
to see the level of recorded crime for different areas[120]. </p> 
<p>If you're planning to go out late at night and are worried about safety, 
frequent crowded areas such as the West End. There are always plenty of people 
on the street, even at 4AM. Generally, outside central London, the South, and 
East suburban areas are considered more dangerous, notablyBrixton and Hackney, 
although some parts of North-West London such asHarlesden and northern Camden 
are also known trouble spots.</p> 
<p>The main problem right throughout London to various degrees is drunken 
behaviour, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights and after football 
matches. Loud and rowdy behaviour is to be expected and fights and acts of 
aggression also occur. If you are harassed, it is best to simply ignore and 
walk away from those concerned. Trouble spots can be expected around popular 
drinking locations such asSoho and in various suburban centres. </p> 
<p>Every night, Soho presents a particular danger: the <b>&quot;clip 
joint&quot;</b>. The usual targets of these establishments are lone male 
tourists. Usually, an attractive woman will casually befriend the victim and 
recommend a local bar or even a club that has a &quot;show&quot;. The 
establishment will be near-desolate, and, even if the victim has only a drink 
or two, the bill will run to hundreds of pounds. If payment is not immediately 
provided, the bouncers will lock the &quot;patrons&quot; inside and take it by 
force or take them to an ATM and stand over them while they extract the cash.
</p> 
<p>To be safe, if a woman you just met suggests you a place, try to recommend 
a different bar. If she insists on hers then walk away and do not listen to her 
suggestions. Sometimes this con trick takes place when someone is lured into a 
private club with the promise of something perhaps more than a drink (like a 
'private show' or sex for a small amount of money). A 'hostess fee' will appear 
on the bill for several hundred pounds, even though there has been nothing more 
than polite conversation.</p> 
<p>The Metropolitan Police have placed significant resources in combating 
street level crime. Working in conjunction with borough councils, they have 
been able to bring the level of theft and pickpocketing in major retail areas 
in London to a level that is manageable.</p> 
<p>Street gang culture is a growing problem in London as with many other 
cities in England. While most groups of youngsters are not likely to present 
any danger to tourists, some people feel the need to be slightly more vigilant 
in certain areas, especially certain outer suburbs.</p> 
<p>If anyone offers you a free &quot;stress test&quot;, they are likely trying 
to recruit you into the Church of Scientology. The best option is to walk away 
or just say &quot;<i>No thank you</i>&quot; politely, as people are commonly 
harassed into giving personal details.</p> 
<p> <b>Scams/Con Artists</b> </p> 
<p>London has a large number of con artists around, all trying to convince you 
to hand over your money one way or another. In a well-known scam, an older 
gentleman will ask you for directions, convincing you that he thought you were 
English. This scam has been used for over ten years.</p> 
<p>Other popular scams are a man in a suit asking for emergency money for the 
phone (seen in Shoreditch many times). Also a man with a very convincing fake 
gash on his arm - asking for money to get to hospital (strangely refusing the 
offer of calling an ambulance).</p> 
<p>One of the most popular scams in London, is the ticket machine scam, when, 
while buying a ticket at a train station someone will approach you and act as 
if they want to help you buy the right ticket. In reality they will wait until 
your money is in the machine, then lean across, cancel the transaction and 
pocket your cash.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Transport</h3> 
<p>Don't take illegal minicabs (see Get around for details). </p> 
<p>Travelling on lower deck of a night bus is generally safer, as there are 
more passengers around, and you are visible by the bus driver.</p> 
<p>If you have been the victim of crime on the railways or the London 
Underground, you should report the crime as soon as possible to the British 
Transport Police, who have an office in most major train and tube stations. 
Elsewhere, you should report your crime as normal to the Metropolitan Police.
</p> 
<h2>[edit] Stay healthy</h2> 
<p>The UK's <b>National Health Service</b> (NHS) will provide <b>emergency</b> 
treatment for anyone in the UK, irrespective of whether they reside in the UK.
