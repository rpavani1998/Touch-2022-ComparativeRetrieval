A few years ago I rode the then-new Eurostar train from Paris to Brussels. We 
were whizzing along at 180 mph or so, when the &quot;train attendant&quot; did 
something that slowed the journey down considerably for me: she asked me what I 
wanted to eat.&nbsp; <br>
 Just like on a plane, she took my order and then 
came and set a tray full of food on my lap. That was the only dining option, if 
I recall. It was clear she was quite pleased with herself in that she was 
providing the same kind of service you would get on a plane!&nbsp; <br>
 I was 
less than pleased. Why would anyone imitate the inconvenience of air travel, 
where a plate of food, usually bad, is placed precariously on your lap and thus 
forces you to eat elbows held in so you don't hit your neighbor, and 
cautiously, lest you spill food down your front, which usually happens anyway. 
The great thing about train travel, from a comestible viewpoint, is that you 
can sit across the table from someone, chat, and have a proper meal. Or at 
least, you used to be able to. Why would a train imitate the inconveniences of 
a plane?&nbsp; <br>
 In Europe, the answer is that flying has long been much 
more of an elite activity than here (although that is changing with the 
introduction of low-cost airlines like Ryan air). By imitating air travel, the 
Eurostar folks were saying, &quot;See, we are just as sophisticated and elite 
as an airplane!&quot;&nbsp; <br>
 Here in the USA, train travel is also 
imitating air travel. Amtrak now issues tickets clearly designed to resemble 
plane tickets and offer the train equivalent of the frequent flier program. 
Most significantly, Amtrak is now practicing &quot;yield management,&quot; 
where you are charged different ticket prices depending on when you buy. So far 
you can still get a full refund on Amtrak if you don't use the ticket, but who 
knows, maybe that will change too to resemble airlines' no-refund policies. <br>
 In the physical design of its trains, Amtrak is imitating airlines by placing 
luggage racks overhead with doors that close. Little space is provided anymore 
for separate luggage compartments at the end of the aisles, much less entirely 
separate baggage cars. This makes no sense. Planes place luggage racks overhead 
because there is no other space for them. On trains, where space is much less 
at a premium, you shouldn't need to strain a muscle putting a heavy suitcase 
over your head.&nbsp; <br>
 There are two or three things at work here, and 
they intermingle. One is Amtrak's attempt to raise revenue by imitating the 
hostile pricing practices of airlines. That's understandable, if not pleasing. 
Nor is it a good policy choice, but we will leave that for another day. A 
second thing going on is that plane travel has become the dominant inter-city 
travel mode, and other modes of travel imitate it. Besides the reasons already 
stated, it may be because they don't have the time or energy to educate 
passengers in a different way of doing things.
