<br>

<p>Will plug-in cars be a success?</p> 
<p>If by success, we mean &ldquo;sell lots of vehicles&rdquo; the answer is 
probably &ldquo;no&rdquo; unless the price comes down a lot&ndash;say 50% from 
today&rsquo;s prices, so that price is in line with what common people can 
afford. People don&rsquo;t pay more for a car than the loan officer will 
approve for a loan, plus their available down payment. Today&rsquo;s high price 
puts plug-ins out of the price range for most people unless there are huge 
government subsidies&ndash;subsidies that governments cannot afford. The cars 
have other drawbacks&ndash;like limited range and the possible need for 
expensive battery replacement long after the warranty has expired&ndash;further 
cutting back on the marketability of the cars.</p> 
<p>The high cost of plug in vehicles&nbsp;is not just the batteries&ndash;it 
is the cost of the cars themselves. Unless these costs can be brought down, the 
use of batteries with lower capacity to recapture braking energy and to provide 
an acceleration boost, similar to the way today&rsquo;s Prius does today, may 
be a better choice, and is likely to produce a car which is salable to a wider 
range of potential buyers.</p> 
<p>Even with their drawbacks, I expect plug-in cars will find at least a small 
market, for a number of reasons that I will explain in this post. One of these 
reasons is that many people believe that plug-in automobiles will reduce CO2 
emissions. In my view, this belief is false&ndash;but this belief, as well as a 
number of other hopes and fears, are likely to lead a steady interest in 
plug-in automobiles by those wealthy enough to afford them, as well as support 
by politicians who want to appear to be doing something useful.</p> 
<p><strong>The Cost Problem with Plug-In Electric Automobiles</strong></p> 
<p>A major issue is the high front-end cost of plug-in electric autos. The 
government cannot possibility afford to pay subsidies to a large number of auto 
owners, and auto companies cannot expect to offer cut-rate deals, once they are 
selling very many of the vehicles. The current Nissan Leaf&rsquo;s base list 
price (before subsidies) is $35,200, which includes the cost of a 24 kWh battery
estimated to cost $15,600 (or $650 per kWh). The Chevy Volt has a base price of 
$40,280, which includes a 16 kWh batteryestimated to cost $10,000 (or $625 per 
kWh).</p> 
<p>Figure 1. Breakdown of Nissan Leaf Battery Costs according to Wall Street 
Journal</p> 
<p>According to the WSJ article High Battery Cost Curbs Electric Cars</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>. . . researchers such as Mr. Whitacre, the National Academies of Science 
and even some car makers aren&rsquo;t convinced [the high cost of batteries 
will come down], mainly because more than 30% of the cost of the batteries 
comes from metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt. (Lithium makes up only 
a small portion of the metals in the batteries.)</p> 
<p>Prices for these metals, which are set on commodities markets, aren&rsquo;t 
expected to fall with increasing battery production&mdash;and may even rise as 
demand grows, according to a study by the Academies of Science released earlier 
this year and engineers familiar with battery production.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>We know that metals costs are closely related to oil costs, because oil is 
used in their extraction. So reducing battery costs may be a challenge. And it 
is not just battery costs that are high&ndash;it is the rest of the car cost 
that is high-priced as well, especially for the Volt, which runs on either 
gasoline or electricity (but only for 35 miles on electricity). Furthermore, at 
current pricing,it is doubtful that auto manufacturers are making money on the 
cars. They likely will need cost decreases, just to be able to keep sales 
prices at their current levels, if they are to earn a reasonable profit.</p> 
<p>If sales prices remain at their current levels, and the government is not 
able to keep up subsidies, monthly payments to buy the cars will put the cars 
out of reach for many buyers. For example, if a person starts with a $35,000 
car and a $5,000 down payment (or a $40,000 car and a $10,000 down payment), 
the amount to be financed will be $30,000. The monthly payment will be $753.87 
(assuming 6% sales tax on $35,000; 6% interest on loan, and 4 year term). How 
many buyers can afford this high a monthly payment?</p> 
<p>The second problem comes on resale of the vehicle. According to the 
calculator I used, the market value of the (originally $35,000 car) after 4 
years will be $19,600. But how many people will want to buy a four-year old car 
for $19,600, knowing that they may have to buy a new battery for the car for 
$10,000 or $15,600 (or a refurbished one, for a little less)? Prius has had 
very good &ldquo;lasting power&rdquo; with its NiMH battery, with batteries 
said to last up to 180,000 miles, but it is not as clear that lithium-ion 
batteries will last that long,according to this article.</p> 
<p>There are other problems from the point of used car buyers. Many potential 
used car buyers don&rsquo;t have garages for their cars, making charging more 
difficult if there is not a commercial charging location near-by. Apartment 
building owners could theoretically add charging capability, and put in the 
capability to bill the costs back to the appropriate owner, but unless there 
are a lot of potential plug-in buyers looking for this service, it is difficult 
to see this happen.</p> 
<p>Loan terms for a used cars are shorter than for new cars (often 36 months), 
putting the financing of expensive used cars out of the range of less well-off 
buyers, as well. Interest rates may also be higher.</p> 
<p>Both Nissan and Chevy have put together better than market leasing 
arrangements for their new Leaf and Volt, in which they apply the full $7,000 
rebate to the three-year lease term, and assume generous residual values. But 
even at these prices, the cost of the lease plus the electricity for the Nissan 
Leaf is more than the cost of a Nissan Versa (the corresponding non-plug in 
electric car) plus the cost of gasoline, unless gasoline costs average higher 
than $5.07 per gallon over the three-year period (or $5.97 per gallon, if the 
Leaf owner has to pay the cost of road repairs, in addition to electricity).</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Lease comparison calculations&ndash;for those interested:</p> 
<p>A Nissan Leaf leases for $349 month, after taking full credit for the 
$7,500 rebate and a $1999 initial payment. A Nissan Versawould lease for $200 
month, with a $1999 initial payment. The monthly gasoline cost of the Nissan 
Versa (assuming 1,000 miles of travel, a fuel cost of $3.63 gallon, and 30 
miles per gallon for the Nissan Versa) would be $121, and the lease cost plus 
fuel cost would be $321. The Nissan Leaf would use electricity estimated at 2 
cents a mile, or $20, so the cost of the Nissan Leaf lease, plus its fuel costs 
would be $369 month. Thus, the monthly cost would be $48 higher with a Nissan 
Leaf compared to a Versa at a fuel cost of $3.63 month.</p> 
<p>Road maintenance and repairs average about 3 cents a mile or $30 month for 
1,000 miles of travel, based on a comparison ofHighway and Public Street 
construction costs to vehicle miles traveled. These are to some extent covered 
by gasoline costs, but are not included in the electric pricing. If the Leaf 
owner had to pay for road maintenance costs in addition, the total cost of the 
Leaf would be $78 higher. To bring the Versa cost up to the cost of the Leaf, a 
person would need a price of an average gasoline price of $5.07 during the 
three-year period, not including road maintenance costs, or $5.97 including 
road maintenance costs.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><strong>If Saving Gasoline is a Goal</strong></p> 
<p>Non plug-in hybrids, such as today&rsquo;s non-plug in Toyota Prius, 
require much less batter capacity than plug-ins&ndash;about 1.5 kWh compared to 
16 kWh for the Chevy Volt, and 24 kWh for the Nissan Leaf. This lower battery 
requirement keeps the cost of the vehicle lower, and keeps the replacement cost 
of the battery lower. If the real issue is saving gasoline, it may be that use 
of cars such as today&rsquo;s Prius provide more &ldquo;bang for the 
buck,&rdquo; and are also be more salable to second-hand vehicle buyers.
According to John Peterson, there are five generic vehicle configurations, each 
with a typical fuel savings:</p> 
<p>Figure 2. John Petersen's list of vehicle configurations and fuel savings.
</p> 
<p>Peterson makes the following comparison. If a car is driven 12,000 miles a 
year and gets 30 miles to a gallon, it will use 400 gallons of fuel a year. If 
there are 96 kWh of batteries available to reduce fuel consumption (the amounts 
are scalable):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>96 kWh of batteries would be enough for a fleet of 64 Prius-class hybrids 
that will each save 160 gallons of fuel per year and generate a societal fuel 
savings of 10,240 gallons per year;</li> 
<li>96 kWh of batteries would be enough for a fleet of six Volt-class plug-in 
hybrids that will each save 300 gallons of fuel per year and generate a 
societal fuel savings of 1,800 gallons per year; and</li> 
<li>96 kWh of batteries would be enough for a fleet of four Leaf class 
electric vehicles that will each save 400 gallons of fuel per year and generate 
a societal fuel savings of 1,600 gallons per year.</li> </ul> 
<p>Thus, if high battery costs present a problem from the point of view of 
automobile salability, or if battery supply is constrained, it would seem to 
make more sense to use batteries in Prius-style hybrids, rather than in plug-in 
vehicles.</p> 
<p><strong>Can We Expect Plug In Automobiles to Reduce CO2Emissions?</strong>
</p> 
<p>Many people believe that plug-in automobiles will reduce CO2 emissions, and 
will buy the cars, with this belief. I disagree with the assessment, however. I 
expect that using plug-in cars will raise CO2&nbsp;emissions. My argument is as 
follows:</p> 
<p>World oil production is basically maxed out. The world will extract as much 
oil from the ground as it is able. If you or I don&rsquo;t use a model with a 
gasoline engine, and instead buy a plug-in model, admittedly there will be a 
reduction in the gasoline that you or I would use. But we live in a world 
market for oil. If we don&rsquo;t buy the oil,<strong>the oil will not be left 
in the ground.</strong> Instead, the price of oil may drop by a tiny bit, and 
the oil will be bought by someone else. In fact, if we save money by buying 
electricity instead of oil, we may ourselves use the leftover money to buy 
something else that uses oil. &nbsp;Because world oil production is now 
virtually flat (inelastic), regardless of oil price, the fact that we save oil 
doesn&rsquo;t really make any difference in the whole scheme of things. Unless 
there is a fairly large drop in price, there will be no drop in world oil 
production and consumption.</p> 
<p>I would argue that what electric cars do is allow us to raise our demand 
for other sources of energy (mostly coal and natural gas&ndash;sources of 
supply which are more elastic), so that we end up burning those sources faster, 
in an attempt to allow<strong>more people to have cars</strong>, without 
exhausting our liquid fuel supply, or to allow people who have cars<strong>to 
drive them further</strong>.</p> 
<p>Of course, if we simply compare the emissions of plug-in&nbsp;cars to 
emissions of cars with internal combustion engines (ICE), there will be appear 
to be appear to be a CO2 emission savings per car, with the amount depending on 
what fuel is used for electricity (coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, etc.). We 
don&rsquo;t have the choice of using more ICEs though&ndash;our other choice is 
to &ldquo;do without.&rdquo; And furthermore, the oil we would have used stays 
in the world supply, to be used elsewhere.</p> 
<p>But many people do not make the comparison I make, and will want to 
purchase plug-in vehicles, on the assumption that because of the efficiency of 
electric engines, there is at least a small savings in CO2, relative to ICEs, 
even with coal as a source of electricity.</p> 
<p><strong>Other Reasons for Wanting Plug-In Vehicles</strong></p> 
<p>Apart from these issues, it seems like there are several other reasons why 
some people will choose to buy plug-in vehicles or will argue that subsidies 
should be used, to encourage greater use by many drivers. These reasons include 
the following:</p> 
<p><strong>Save money on fuel.</strong> Is the purpose of plug-in 
vehicles&nbsp;to give the small number of people who are rich enough to 
purchase them the chance to save money on fuel, if they keep their cars long 
enough? Some people believe that oil prices will rise to $20 a gallon (and the 
economy won&rsquo;t collapse at the same time). If this is their concern, and 
they can afford the high cost of a plug-in vehicle, they may choose a plug-in 
auto, even if the price is high relative to other cars.</p> 
<p><strong>Allow individual drivers to drive longer.</strong> Is the purpose 
of plug-in electric vehicles to provide those who have enough foresight to buy 
the plug-in electric vehicles a chance to motor around, when others are unable 
to, because gasoline is unavailable? People may buy them with this view, but I 
would argue that there is no point in subsidizing costs if this is the 
purpose&ndash;owners will get their reward, if there is a reward of this sort.
</p> 
<p><strong>Reduce oil imports.</strong> Natural gas and coal used to run power 
plants are mostly fuels from US sources. Wind and solar PV are mostly one-time 
investments, that don&rsquo;t require much ongoing fuel supply (except for 
maintenance). If we can use these instead of imported oil to power vehicles, 
the argument goes, it will reduce our dependence on imported oil.</p> 
<p>Figure 3. US imports of petroleum products, based on EIA data. 2011 data is 
for the partial year.</p> 
<p>I would argue that oil imports will decline, regardless of what we do. The 
issue is really one of making whatever we do have go farther (which is next on 
my list of reasons).</p> 
<p><strong>Allow more people to drive vehicles, and drive them further.
</strong> Anything that allows what liquid fuel supply we have to go farther, 
such as supplementing oil powered cars with cars powered by electricity, allows 
more people to drive cars, and to drive them further. I would argue that this 
is a primary reason for both plug-in autos and for higher mileage standards for 
cars in general. If we are entering into a period of fuel shortages, this might 
be a major reason for electric vehicles, if the price of electric vehicles can 
be brought down low enough. The efficiency arguments given earlier would 
suggest that non-plug-ins should be given preference, but if batteries can be 
made cheaply and total vehicle costs can be brought down, this difference may 
not be an issue.</p> 
<p><strong>Show Off.</strong>&nbsp;I would argue that for some people, a major 
motivation for buying a plug-in vehicle&nbsp;today is to be first in the 
neighborhood with such a car. A related purpose might be &ldquo;to have the 
latest electronic toy.&rdquo; Providing subsidies (based on taxes of people 
less well off than the drivers of these vehicles) would seem silly if this is 
the main purpose for at least some of the cars.</p> 
<p><strong>Allow business as usual (BAU) to continue longer.</strong> It seems 
to me that this may be what is in the back of some people&rsquo;s minds. If we 
don&rsquo;t have enough fuel for gasoline vehicles, perhaps electric vehicles 
will solve our problems, and we can continue to motor along for the next 50 or 
100 years.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is a reasonable expectation. BAU will stop for 
whatever reason it stops&ndash;perhaps financial reasons. It will stop, whether 
we have used our electric vehicles for their full lifetimes or not. Not 
everyone will see things this way, however, and the people who believe 
differently will want to purchase what they think will help for the long term.
</p> 
<p><strong>Allow politicians to look like they are doing something.</strong> I 
think this is a big part of the push for plug-in automobiles. Whether or not 
the vehicles are really scalable, will save CO2, or will help Detroit 
automakers, I think this is a major reason for plug-in electric vehicles.</p> 
<p><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></p> 
<p>There is a common belief that if there are two options, Option A and Option 
B, buyers will choose Option A if the cost of Option A is less than that of 
Option B. This is true up to a point. People won&rsquo;t buy either Option A or 
Option B, if neither is affordable, or if the option won&rsquo;t fit with their 
current lifestyle.</p> 
<p>The cost of a Nissan Leaf over a lifetime of 20 years (200,000 miles) is 
the cost of the vehicle, plus the cost of a second battery, for a total cost of 
$50,800, or a cost of 25.4 cents per mile. The lifetime cost of a Chevy Volt is 
similar, if we include the cost of an extra battery. The total cost is $50,280, 
or 25.1 cents per mile.</p> 
<p>In addition, the Nissan Leaf will need to buy electricity over the life of 
the car, currently estimated to cost 2 cents per mile&ndash;probably more than 
this in the future, if electricity prices rise, in response to higher fossil 
fuel prices. If plug-in vehicles get to be any reasonable share of the total 
vehicles, governments will need to find a way to tax the owners to collect fees 
for road construction and maintenance. These costs, according to my 
calculations, amount to about 3 cents a mile. So total costs (ignoring 
maintenance and other costs) are about 30 cents a mile, plus interest payments 
on debt. These costs will be shared very unequally among owners, with the early 
owners paying a disproportionate share of the costs.</p> 
<p>If a vehicle owner buys a 30 mile a gallon car for $15,000, and it also 
lasts for 200,000 miles, the cost of vehicle ownership will be 7.5 cents per 
mile. The cost of fuel will be 12.1 cents per mile, at today&rsquo;s price of 
$3.63 gallon, making the total cost (excluding interest on loans and vehicle 
maintenance) 19.6 cents per mile.</p> 
<p>If debt were completely interest free, and buyers valued a dollar today the 
same as a dollar 20 years from now, theoretically an average fuel cost of $6.75 
over the life of the vehicle would balance costs out (since this would imply a 
gasoline cost of 22.5 cents per mile). But in the real world, this is not the 
case. If one needs to account for interest issues, the average cost per gallon 
would need to be much higher than $6.75&ndash;perhaps be double this amount, 
depending on the interest rate.</p> 
<p>There are huge additional questions:</p> 
<p>1. Will there really be enough electricity for plug-in vehicles, 10 or 20 
years from now? Japan and German are taking nuclear off line now. Coal 
transport depends on oil. It may be that electricity supplies are as 
constrained as oil supplies.</p> 
<p>2. How will financing of the high cost vehicles be achieved, and at what 
interest rates? There are limits as to what governments can do.</p> 
<p>3. Will resale markets of plug-in vehicles work out as planned?</p> 
<p>At this point, I personally would not make a push for plug-in vehicles, but 
I can understand why some people might want to do so, especially if they are of 
the belief that costs can come down substantially in the future.</p>

<p>Gail,</p> 
<p>One point you haven&rsquo;t touched on is how poor electric vehicles are at 
carrying loads. The Chevy Volt, for example, has a load capacity of a little 
over 700 pounds. That&rsquo;s not enough to carry four average American males 
(who weight 195 pounds unclothed) even with an empty fuel tank. Even the Prius 
can carry over 800 pounds (though it is sold as a five-seater).</p> 
<p>The alternative fuel-saving option is an efficient internal combustion 
engine. Even if we restrict it to currently available (in the U.S.) vehicles 
you have the VW Jetta TDI which uses a bit more fuel than the Volt but carries 
about 50% more weight (and can tow a 1000 pound trailer) while costing slightly 
over 50% as much (base price about $22,500).</p> 
<p>Even GM can see the logic of this approach: the turbodiesel Chevrolet Cruze 
is expected in 2013 and will probably be even cheaper than the the VW. While 
the Cruze is smaller than the VW Jetta, it is still larger (inside) than the 
Volt, and carries a larger load.</p> <br>

<p>Good point! People will be willing to pay for the value they get, and the 
small load capacity reduces the value of the vehicles. Furthermore, many people 
will eliminate them completely, because they don&rsquo;t meet their 
family&rsquo;s transportation needs.</p> <br>

<p>I considered buying a hybrid or electric vehicle a few years ago when 
looking at buying a car. I did the math and they were prohibitively expensive 
and it just did not make sense. I think you also have a problem with these cars 
now that they have an image problem. They are tied to one political ideological 
group and more specifically one class within that political ideological group 
(upper middle class and wealthy liberals&hellip;generally far left liberals 
which come across as smug to everyone else&hellip;South Park did an excellent 
critique on this) and it turns off everyone else who isn&rsquo;t in their camp, 
pretty hard core. Minorities I know in the Bay can&rsquo;t stand Prius drivers 
either. I can tell you that everyone who is not in the far far leftist club in 
the Bay Area jokes about all the Prius drivers and other hybrid and electric 
car drivers being smug, self absorbed types who are rude drivers. These types 
of things definitely deter people like me and more moderates and conservatives 
from every joining the Prius or other Hybrid club. No matter how much they 
insult us for not getting in line and wasting our money on an image.</p> <br>

<p>Why be smug at smugness? Some people drive large cars. Some people walk. 
Some people take the local bus. But being smug about people being smug will not 
solve the transportation problem. These energy and transportation problems are 
not easy ones and each person the does something to aid this frail system is 
likely benefitting others in their community.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Gail:</p> 
<p>Excellent POST. To those of us that follow the peak oil literature, it is 
well-understood that electric or hybrid cars neither help the oil depletion nor 
the atmospheric CO2 problem and probably make them worse. However, they do 
contribute green feel goodness and less guilt in a civilization where the 
misery index in rapidly escalating, so maybe that is worth something. One thing 
you missed in your POST is the cost of maintaing roads. This is soon going to 
become a bottleneck and maybe a show stopper for vehicle sales other than old 
trucks. As JK might say, efforts to maintain &ldquo;happy motoring&rdquo; are 
just incredulous!</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>
 September 7, 2011 at 3:15 pm <br>

<p>Yes, I probably should have written about green feel-goodness too, but that 
would have offended some.</p> 
<p>I mentioned the cost of maintaining roads, but didn&rsquo;t say much about 
it because the post was getting long as it was. The cost is definitely rising. 
The long-term trend is probably up, because of high oil costs and lower number 
of private passenger autos relative to trucks, as the economy goes down hill. 
In the North, where freezing and thawing is an issue, the roads will need to be 
repaired, regardless of how little traffic they have. Repairs will also need to 
follow major storms, with or without much traffic on the roads.</p> <br>

<p>I enjoyed your post. You make an important point using natural gas to make 
electric to drive cars allows us to deplete both oil and natural gas by 
driving. I also appreciate the use of numbers (facts and figures) so much of 
the energy debate is assertions with no information content. Keep up the good 
work. </p> <br>

<p>Hi Gail,</p> 
<p>Given your research and analysis skills I&rsquo;ve no doubt about what you 
have presented in this post. However, I&rsquo;d like to suggest a different 
approach to the subject: what is the likely continuance (say for the next 20 
years) of private vehicle ownership that even remotely supports the current car 
culture?</p> 
<p>The analysis of mpg, cost of ownership, affordability, status symbols, etc 
strikes me as a bit odd for a blog called &ldquo;Our Finite World&rdquo; 
&ndash; more like a Consumer&rsquo;s Report analysis. Much of our discussion 
here focuses on the notion that depleting oil supplies (along with many other 
resource/environmental issues) will lead to a collapse of BAU unless drastic 
changes are implemented. Many people who comment here have expressed the idea 
that we have already missed the opportunity to avoid some manner of collapse in 
the next few decades or so. Personally, I like to think that there are still 
some opportunities to mitigate the worst consequences of peak everything. Aside 
from that tiny bit of optimism, I&rsquo;m trying to understand what scenarios 
are possible/probable in the next few decades. The one scenario I don&rsquo;t 
find likely is one in which we worry about buying family vehicles that provide 
for 200,000 miles of motoring about in any manner that resembles today&rsquo;s 
paradigm.</p> 
<p>I find it strange that we have comments here that view this issue through 
the prism of political ideology or elitism. I suggest that we try to analyze 
the most likely way that humans will move about the face of the earth in 20 or 
30 years. And, how we might actually transition to more sustainable modes of 
transportation. Although I agree that small amounts of fuel saved by individual 
actions are pretty futile, it seems to me that dramatic/extensive changes in 
public policy could make a real difference.</p> 
<p>And what might these changes look like? I&rsquo;m sure most will find my 
suggestions to be totally crazy unless you buy into the basic thesis of Peak 
Everything. For example (US centric): national max speed 35 mph with mandatory 
governors, elimination of half the public roadways, no new parking facilities, 
significant tax increases for private vehicle weight, etc. The general idea 
being to totally eliminate the current private automobile paradigm over the 
next 20 years or so. To greatly encourage and provide safety for Neighborhood 
Electric Vehicles (NEV) which are basically weatherized golf carts and Human 
Powered Vehicles (HPV) such as velo-mobiles, bikes and trikes. To convert the 
transportation portion of our economy to one driven by slower and lower cost 
public transportation (forget high speed trains). NEV-HPV for local travel 
combined with public transportation for the rest. The book &ldquo;Plan C&rdquo; 
goes into a lot more detail on this subject.</p> 
<p>For those who find these suggestions unpalatable for economic reasons, 
personal reasons or what-have-you &ndash; then it would seem to be your 
responsibility to suggest how the laws of physics can be dealt with as oil 
depletes, the planet warms, the oceans acidity, deserts spread, aquifers 
deplete, species extinction rates increase, millions of humans starve in 
Africa, human population grows, etc. Even if I&rsquo;m wrong about the time 
frame (say 100 years instead of 20), what kind of morality supports the idea 
that today&rsquo;s generation of humans has the right to degrade the biosphere 
of our planet and deprive many future generations of a livable planet.</p> <br>

<p>Dave: I cannot avoid agreeing with your vision, as implied in your 4th 
(penultimate) paragraph, although I might see a different approach. And more 
than just transportation is involved, but the same vision still applies.</p> 
<p>Slightly off topic: I see high-speed trains as an expensive distraction. 
What we need are trains that work as well as they did pre-WW2. A few years ago 
we of the Chicago branch of my wife&rsquo;s extended family traveled to and 
from Philadelphia, for a major family event, via Amtrak. Slow travel; our 
passenger train was repeatedly shunted onto a siding so the lordly freight 
trains could take priority. (Getting past the south end of Lake Michigan was 
like a Kafka novel illustrated by Hieronymus Bosch.) The rails were in 
miserable shape. A grandniece was badly burned by leaning against a wall by her 
seat; the heating system had gone postal. We have a saying about walk before we 
run; regarding trains, we should try skootch before we crawl.</p> 
<p>But for really dystopian railroad transportation (freight or passenger), 
there is Mexico. Interestingly, back in the 1930&prime;s and 1940&prime;s, 
Mexican railroads worked well; back in the bad old days of the Porfirio 
D&iacute;az dictatorship, Mexican railroads were world class.</p> 
<p>Cheap fuel is nonrenewable and in increasingly short supply. Human 
bungling, cupidity and incompetence, whether governmental or private 
enterprise, is infinitely renewable and inexhaustible.</p> <br>

<p>Hi David,</p> 
<p>Back in the good old days (maybe bad) when we jumped on a plane in blissful 
ignorance to go cycling in Europe, we used trains in Ireland and France. In 
Ireland &ndash; slow and funky. In France &ndash; very fast and modern. From a 
cyclist perspective, I loved the trains in Ireland &ndash; just roll your bike 
on the train with no extra preparation and no rush. I truly love France, but 
trying to manage a bike on a high speed train is not much fun.</p> 
<p>I see no compelling reason for high speed trains. If you buy into the idea 
of trains being compatible with bikes, there are more important considerations 
than 150 mph.</p> <br>

<p>You make some good points. </p> 
<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have written the post, except that some of The 
Oil Drum staff members had been discussing some related material behind the 
scenes, so I tried to work through the details, trying to figure out what the 
issues really were (rather than focusing on, say, whether better batteries 
could fix some perceived problem). But you are right&ndash;it is hard to get 
very excited about something that is supposed to last of 200,000 miles, when we 
are hitting limits right now. The chances of the whole thing working seem 
pretty remote.</p> 
<p>I am afraid that the scenario we will be hitting is that we will lose most 
imported goods, and this could cause things to screech to a halt very quickly. 
It is hard to even imagine what we would do in such a 
situation&ndash;hopefully, things would hold together for a while, but there 
are so many connected pieces. Food transport would be a major concern.</p> 
<p>What we really need is things that will last a long, long time. If we use 
bicycles, we need ones that won&rsquo;t need new tires, or some other important 
part, that you and your neighbors can&rsquo;t put together quickly with local 
materials. We really do need 200,000 mile vehicles, if we expect to have 
vehicles.</p> 
<p>I am not sure that we can expect to have vehicles, for precisely this 
reason. We may have to go back to what people did before&ndash;ride animals, or 
have animals pull carts. But it is hard to write a post, unless I have 
something more favorable to offer than this.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Gail,</p> 
<p>Although the use of bicycles on the Ho Chi Minh trail has been somewhat 
romanticized and exaggerated, never-the-less, bikes moved a lot of material 
under very adverse conditions. Perhaps we can learn from this experience about 
what is most important for a utilitarian bike.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve often been fascinated about the subject of a &ldquo;sustainable 
bike&rdquo;. The frame is really not an issue as bamboo is quite adequate 
(probably other woods also). A spoked wheel also does not seem to be a huge 
challenge &ndash; although I wonder what kind of simple technology might be 
used to create a basic rubber tire (or something functionally equivalent). The 
real power and glory of a bike comes from chains and gears (please &ndash; no 
rants from unicyclists). I suspect that chains and gears can be salvaged from 
millions of unused bikes for the next 50 years or so. After that, it remains to 
be seen if these two items can be locally produced at reasonable cost with 
low-tech methods &ndash; I tend to think this is quite possible. Other bike 
parts like brakes and cables seem to be less of a challenge in a low tech world.
</p> 
<p>We should have college level competition to produce a low tech bike &ndash; 
maybe this is already being done?</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>

<p>I agree. Figuring out a low-tech bicycle should be a high priority.</p> 
<p>There may be other low tech approaches that would work as well, more 
barges, and upgrades to these. Where we have railroad tracks, there may be 
simpler systems that could be used on the rail tracks, as long as these can be 
maintained.</p> 
<p>I think all of the emphasis on high tech (use more coal and natural gas) 
solutions has kept people from thinking about solutions at a human scale level, 
that can really be maintained for the long term.</p> <br>

<p>There are a couple of groups that are focused on 3rd world bikes that 
don&rsquo;t break. I&rsquo;ve looked at them from time to time for Africa. But 
I didn&rsquo;t consider the local manufacture of chains. Honestly in the flat 
parts of Africa i&rsquo;ve been in, who needs gears. I think of the American 
bikes of the 30&prime;s and 40&prime;s and the modest means of the 
family&rsquo;s that owned them, they didn&rsquo;t have gears.</p> <br>

<p>Dave, I agree the happy motoring model seems to be scheduled for some 
reduction in the near term, and a lot of reduction in the medium term. I see it 
here in Pennsylvania with the disappearance of Suburbans, Big Trucks, 
Expeditions, etc as everyday vehicles. If I understand the data correctly 
12millionish (wsj) light vehicles is a rather dramatic decrease in the 21st 
century. I don&rsquo;t see us going back to 17.</p> 
<p>I own a LEV (from Polaris), it used lead batteries, and gets me where I 
need to go in rural<br>
 PA, and could do the same in suburban (minus the law). 
but is a 2 seater, appropriate for hauling groceries, materials, and going to 
doctor&rsquo;s appointments, no AC, no heat. For $10,999, $2700 more than the 
gas version, it seems a reasonable premium for something that draws 1kw when 
charging, an easy load on my solar panels. I think LEV&rsquo;s and NEV&rsquo;s 
offer an opportunity to get out of the Detroit mentality that everything that 
you drive must be like an ICE vehicle.</p> 
<p>As with everything in this descent (or step function down for a true 
doomer), working towards &ldquo;local&rdquo; XYZ, community sufficiency, and 
very reduced expectations on comfort (I wear a real coat, gloves and a hat 
driving it in the winter), is what we should be doing now for ourselves and to 
help other people make that transition.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Schoff,</p> 
<p>Can you provide a link to the vehicle you own? I looked on Polaris&rsquo; 
web site and I see their version of a NEV &ndash; but, that does not seem like 
what you have? Also, what are the legal issues? We have biked in a retirement 
community in Florida that allows NEVs but only within the city limit &ndash; 
plus some other restrictions.</p> 
<p>Low Emission Vehicles (LEV) seems to cover a pretty broad range but 
I&rsquo;ve not actually drilled down on this &ndash; probably should.</p> <br>

<p>Thanks for the link. Their website is a bit hard to navigate but I get the 
general idea. They have a cab kit to enclose the vehicle and make it more 
weather friendly. I wonder what it would take to strip down something like this 
Nissan Versa and put in a 30 mph electric system with something like an 80 mile 
range. Much like your Ranger, no crash protection, no AC, no power windows, or 
anything that adds weight or uses extra energy. I wonder what it would need to 
cost in a bare bones configuration (as opposed to the high priced Nissan Leaf 
&ndash; BAU type of car)?</p>

<p>Factoids:</p> 
<p>Toyota Camry is 170 horsepower in the base model. Upscale 250 Hp.</p> 
<p>1 horsepower is 745 watts. To have a 200 Hp Camry equivalent electric car 
requires 150,000 watts.</p> 
<p>If you want to run the car using 3/4 its power (150 Hp) for 1 hour, 
that&rsquo;s 150 X 745 = 112,000 watt hours. If you get 100% efficiency in the 
battery in and out, that&rsquo;s the target number for a Camry equivalent 
vehicle running 1 hour.</p> 
<p>A watt is 1 volt X 1 ampere. If your house is uses 240 Volts to charge 
that&rsquo;s 112,000 watt-hours / 240 Volts = 466 ampere hours. Since your 
house circuit breakers won&rsquo;t endure 466 amperes, you have to throttle 
down the amperes and take longer than 1 hour. 20 amp breakers are typical for 
residences, but rewiring the house might double that. So using 40 amps, you can 
put 1 hour of Camry driving into a battery over a period of 466 / 40 = over 10 
hours.</p> 
<p>1 lousy hour in a Camry massed car takes 10 hrs to charge up, if you rewire 
your house, and if you have a non existent 100% efficient in/out battery. Want 
lower mass? That means &ldquo;want a death trap?&rdquo;. Want 2 hours travel, 
charge it up over 24 hrs.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s all silly and is going to kill people in car wrecks even before 
it kills people wasting energy on a non viable solution.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Owen, </p> 
<p>Maybe everything you state above is true, if one drives there 200 Hp Camry

<ul> 
<li> Owen says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 2:00 pm <br>

<p>You missed my reducing the horsepower to 3/4 maximum for typical driving.
</p> 
<p>Massless cars are deathtraps in an crash. You incur that risk for the 
joyous privilege of charging up a battery 10+ hrs to get 1 hour of use at a 
price 25% higher than a conventional vehicle, to extend oil supply a few days.
</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s silly. Optimal strategy is to suppress competing consumption 
militarily. Everything else makes the problem worse.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>

<p>Perhaps it extends oil supply a few days. More likely, it just lets someone

someone else using it.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> Owen says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 5:16 pm <br>

<p>I am going to back off a bit from the massless deathtrap thing, but only a 
bit.</p> 
<p>The Leaf is of comparable weight to a base model and stripped down Camry. 
That&rsquo;s the little169 Hp engine. A more average engine (operative word 
average) at 200 Hp will add, as will the typical automatic transmission, so the 
&ldquo;typical&rdquo; Camry will weigh more (and carry more, so &ldquo;curb 
weight&rdquo; is probably the wrong comparison) than a Leaf, but not a ton, as 
it were, more. There is also most certainly the issue of uniform distribution 
of mass. A Camry engine is going to take the impact for you because it&rsquo;s 
in front of you. The Leaf battery is under your seat.</p> 
<p>The point would be $$$ to rewire your house for 240 V (or higher) and 40 
amp wires (you can&rsquo;t just pound amperage through thin wires; they melt) 
as well as breakers, all so you can wait 10+ hours to have enough get up and go 
for 1 lousy Camry equivalent hour. And you get to pay 25% more for the 
opportunity to endure all that.</p>

<p>Oh, Gail. The inevitability of your conclusion there is relentless. 
It&rsquo;s like the law of supply and demand. It trumps everything else. 
However, if as a society, you have sunk everything into long lasting, low 
energy consumption goods, your decline will be that much less painful as the 
rest of the world realigns with a resource constrained future.</p> 
<p>Is there a name for someone else swooping in to consume the resource that 
someone else saved?</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>

<p>When I think of long lasting, low energy consumption goods, I think of 
things like wheel barrows, and pots and pans, and looms for cloth that can be 
operated without electricity.</p> 
<p>A lot of people seem to think of electric cars, wind turbines, and Energy 
Star refrigerators that can be operated with a little less electricity than 
last year&rsquo;s model. The issue is that none of these things will last 
longer than the electric grid, and that may not be all that long. So we need to 
be planning farther ahead, if we want to be prepared.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if there is a name for someone else swooping in to 
consume the resource that someone else saved. The idea has clearly been around 
since Bible times. Wars were fought, and treasure carried back. There were 
thieves back then, as there are now. There are more sophisticated ways of doing 
this too&ndash;tax structure, for example, can take from one group, to give to 
another.</p> <br>
</li> 
<li> schoff says: <br>
 September 14, 2011 at 11:00 am <br>

<p>This actually a response to Gail and &ldquo;low energy&rdquo;. Perhaps we 
can differentiate between home energy and commercial energy. Throughout the 
northeast there were plenty of manufacturers using water power to run machines 
in the 19th century, all of those sites<br>
 still exist, I don&rsquo;t even 
remember much of the tooling being steel, most seemed made of iron, but I could 
be wrong. If you want electricity for those sites as well, I think the ability 
to make a generator out of millions of spare alternators should be pretty 
simple.</p> 
<p>For the home, you are going to have lots of small legacy solar, like 
d.lights and sunwize systems for a little bit of lighting, and then some 
standalone PV homes that will have electricity for decades during the day, but 
not at night (unless you can manufacture sulfuric acide and refurb batteries).
</p> 
<p>I see water being the real issue, and something you might want to consider 
by muncipality. For instance NYC is essentially gravity fed, as is 
Harrisburg&rsquo;s. Philadelphia is not, lose the grid for an extensive period 
and it is over (note this is not about treating the water, this is about 
pumping it into the city itself). It would make an interesting table, taking 
the top 50 municipalities in this context and then their setting. For instance 
no water for Philly in a place which has water is different than no water for 
LA in a place that is a desert.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>
 September 14, 2011 at 1:14 pm <br>

<p>I am guessing what we should be using most of the solar panels for is 
pumping water for the cities that don&rsquo;t have gravity fed sources. If they 
can only run a few hours at a time, that is better than nothing. That would be 
a much better use for the panels than running someone&rsquo;s dishwasher or 
clothes washer (neither of which would do much without water).</p> <br>

</ul> </li> 
<li> schoff says: <br>
 September 14, 2011 at 1:31 pm <br>

<p>I agree Gail. And now you have really uncovered an interesting possibility. 
Most water treatment systems have storage at various stages, including the 
final product stage (various municipalities around Pennsylvania seem to have a 
couple of days worth of treated water). There might be a nice integration there 
to deal with peak solar power during the day. I also wonder how much difference 
there is between winter and summer use of water for various municipalities.</p>

<p>Gail<br>
 Appreciate the thought on the subject. Two things to consider 
though. First, you need to take into account that this is a multi-variable 
problem. I agree that it is not likely that battery powered vehicles will 
create any significant in-roads if one assumes that the mass of current 
vehicles remains the same. With a typical 3000-lb vehicle, the weight and cost 
of the battery is significant because you need a big expensive battery to haul 
around a lot of mass that really doesn&rsquo;t add to the utility of the 
vehicle. With expensive batteries, it just means a return to smaller and 
lighter cars which in the end will provide the same utility as current large 
vehicles. Second, there is technology advancement in battery technology that 
will provide 400 mile range probably sooner rather than later. We had a talk 
here in Seattle by MIT Professor Donald Sadoway on emerging battery technology 
last year. He is of the opinion that there is potential to increase the energy 
density by a factor of three in the immediate future, ~10 years. Sadoway also 
doesn&rsquo;t foresee there to be an issue with regards to power generation. He 
states that electric vehicles will use the same amount of energy per household 
as our refrigerators. So don&rsquo;t expect advancements either in using car 
batteries and smart grid to even out utility loads. The power use just 
isn&rsquo;t large enough to make a difference.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m also of the opinion that companies like GM are subject to the 
Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma. Harvard business professor Clayton Christensen has 
written about how dominant companies can be displaced by disruptive technology 
because they are incapable of developing and nurturing less capable technology 
that competes with their current products. The Chevy Volt will likely prove to 
fall into this situation. GM needs to develop products that have the same cost 
structure and profit margins as their current vehicles and so they develop an 
expensive gas/plug-in electric hybrid vehicle which can maintain their profit 
margins and corporate structure. The problem here it that the technology is 
likely not easily downward scalable. Consequently it is probably more likely 
that a company like Tata or a golf cart manufacturer with lower overhead costs 
will be the successful electric car manufacturer.</p> 
<p>I think we all know of your thoughts on continued economic growth and the 
debt based economy. Certainly we aren&rsquo;t going to see the two to three 
cars per household that we&rsquo;ve seen in the past because we all just 
aren&rsquo;t going to have the same degree of material wealth. But it might be 
reasonable for there to be neighborhood vehicles or only one vehicle per 
household.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 9:11 am <br>

<p>My complaints are really with the idea that we can keep BAU going with 
electric cars. The Leaf and Volt are heavy cars, with the big batteries.</p> 
<p>I could see glorified golf carts a lot more easily. The cost would be 
reasonable. Of course, one might ask whether bicycles might not work just as 
well, for the short distances under discussion.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> Bicycle Dave says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 7:33 pm <br>

<p>Hi Gail,</p> 
<p>As much as I love bikes, I think we need the glorified golf carts (NEV) for 
a variety of reasons: weather, disability, old age, babies and infants, etc. 
There are a whole class of people and many situations where a NEV makes good 
sense. But neither bikes or NEVs will ever be put into widespread use until 
they are safe to use for nearly all purposes. It is never going to work if we 
have to share the road with 70 mph, 3,000 lb steel boxes operated by people who 
may or may not be competent and not distracted.</p> 
<p>The real question is whether or not we start soon enough to create new 
transportation models to serve our basic needs in a power-down future.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> schoff says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 9:28 pm <br>

<p>Agreed. I want to take my 75 year old mother to her doctor&rsquo;s 
appointment in the NEV. I need to trailer 1000 lbs of feed from time to time. I 
also don&rsquo;t like to goto church sweaty.</p> <br>
</li> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 9:44 pm <br>

<p>I think a big part of our problem is that we can&rsquo;t get any kind of 
agreement as to how we need to change. A lot of folks have their heads in the 
clouds, thinking we can all drive electric plug in vehicles, with 300 mile 
ranges, and buy them for $15,000 a piece. Others think that maybe glorified 
golf cars would be the way to go, but how to clear the roads for them. A third 
view is that we need to plan on riding horses, or horse driven carts, but where 
would we raise all of the horses, and what would we feed them.</p> 
<p>I am afraid we need to wait until everything falls apart, and then we use 
whatever is available, which may not be much at all.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> Bicycle Dave says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 10:32 pm <br>

<p>Hi Gail,</p> 
<p>In a perfect scenario (most doubtful) we would conserve high energy sources 
(liquid fuel or big batteries) just for those activities that really need them. 
Clearing roads (snow or whatever) and plowing fields being prime candidates. I 
think roads will last much longer and need less maintenance (except from 
vegetation) if we only use them for NEVs and HPVs.</p> 
<p>As you say: &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t get any kind of agreement as to how we 
need to change&rdquo;. This is the real problem and it stems from the fact that 
we can&rsquo;t agree upon the nature of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; itself. 
&ldquo;Change&rdquo; is in the realm of &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;. As I&rsquo;ve 
said before, it is very hard to have effective solutions when the problem 
itself is not understood. I will refrain from flogging my theory about why we 
are unable to understand the problem.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Gail,</p> 
<p>Here in Australia a popular rationale for plug-in cars argues this: A very 
large numbers of plug-in cars can act as a giant sponge (electricity can be 
charged and discharged from them into the grid depending on the time of day or 
night) and via this means peaks in the larger electricty system can be ironed 
out and the power system can thus operate much more efficiently.</p> 
<p>In this way, it is argued, the improved efficiency in the electricity 
system will be adequate to totally energise those cars without needing any 
augmented sources of power.</p> 
<p>I am unaware if that rationale has hit the US, but would be interested if 
the argument is based on solid logic or wishful thinking. It sounds neat 
enough, but I am not sold on the idea. The theory certainly appeals to those 
who think there is a free lunch.</p> <br>

 I believe I&rsquo;ve read that the additional charging and 
discharging would cause the batteries to wear out more quickly. If this is 
correct, it would mean that more batteries would have to be produced, and this 
would necessitate additional resource consumption.</p> <br>

<p>I have read that that is one of the issues. The number of charge /

batteries than the quick charge approach.</p> <br>

<p>I think the giant sponge idea has been disproved as impractical, and also 
that the quantity of storage would be too small. I don&rsquo;t think I can find 
a link, though.</p> 
<p>There is also the issue of whether people would be happy, if when they go 
to drive the car, the battery has been drained to help supply needed 
electricity elsewhere.</p> 
<p>The cost of installing the system for what I expect would be a fairly small 
number of users would seem to be prohibitively high as well.</p> <br>

<p>It would be far better to store electrical energy in hot water heaters

<p>I am pretty sure you are right. Even if the whole thing of storage could be 
worked out (and leave the person with electricity to drive the car when 
needed), adding and subtracting electricity would wear out the battery more 
quickly, and there would be an electrical loss in the round-trip.</p> <br>

<p>Plug-in cars wont succeed,even if they appear to, because the problem with 
cars, as it turns out, is cars themselves. How they are powered is almost 
becomeing irrelevent. Only a few people realize the high cost of car-dependency 
does not lie strictly in the price of gas, or what a barrel of oil will go for 
in 10 years, but all the other costs of maintaining a car-dependant system are 
whats really going to drag us down. All those roads, bridges, traffic cops, 
accidents, deaths, sudsides to oil and auto-makers. Thats whats really 
crippling us, not &lsquo;how&rsquo; the cars are powered. Sure gas is makeing a 
colossal mess of everything too, but governments love oil and oil companies, 
and looks the other way at the damage they do.</p> 
<p>However, even if cars were made marginally &hellip;..cleaner, I cant bring 
myself to call them green, b/c that would be a lie, none of the other problems 
created by personal, private 1 person per 4000 pound metal and plastic box get 
resolved-not one. Well perhaps local air quality *might* marginally improve 
over time, but even that is in doubt since imo, car-culture will collpse long 
before any of the benefits of so called plug-ins even become detectable.</p> 
<p>OFW is asking a pointless question. Strange a blog called finite world 
wouldnt realize that cars, and the machinations of corporations and governments 
to keep them rolling along,are what are draining the world. In every way.</p> 
<p>One last point. Compareing the cost of a PIH@25.1 cents p/m, then saying an 
&lsquo;efficent&rsquo; gas-burner comes in a 19.6 cents. A few thoughts. First, 
most amerikans dont own or want to own efficent gas-burners, some to be sure, 
but not many. So the actual costs for more amerikans is undoubtably not as good 
as 19 cents. Second, amerika heavilty sudsidizies both the production and 
consumption of fossil-fuels in ways to numerous to list. Bottom line is, 
amerikan gas is at least 1/2 or maybe even a 1/3 if what is should be. On a 
strictly dollars and cents basis, gas-o-line would be a clear loser on anything 
like an even playing field.zThis is not to say I think PIH are a good idea, 
they are not. Only that gas has been made arftically cheaper than it ought to 
be. That said, the immense subsides the US has historically lavished on oil 
companies are probably not going anywhere, but I think its worth considering 
gas is only &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; because amerikan and world taxpayers subsidize 
it so heavily in the first place.</p> <br>

<p>My concern is about the connectedness of the international financial 
system. One of the current issues is the ability of the Euro to stay together, 
because the current structure isn&rsquo;t working (in part, because of rising 
energy prices and recession). A recent UBS publication says:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> <strong>The Euro should not exist (like this)</strong></p> 
<p>Under the current structure and with the current membership, the Euro does 
not work. Either the current structure will have to change, or the current 
membership will have to change.</p> 
<p><strong>Fiscal confederation, not break-up</strong> </p> 
<p>Our base case with an overwhelming probability is that the Euro moves 
slowly (and painfully) towards some kind of fiscal integration. The risk case, 
of break-up, is considerably more costly and close to zero probability. 
Countries cannot be expelled, but sovereign states could choose to secede. 
However, popular discussion of the break-up option considerably underestimates 
the consequences of such a move.</p> 
<p>. . .(Section on economic cost skipped)</p> 
<p><strong>The political cost </strong><br>
 The economic cost is, in many 
ways, the least of the concerns investors should have about a break-up. 
Fragmentation of the Euro would incur political costs. Europe&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;soft power&rdquo; influence internationally would cease (as the concept 
of &ldquo;Europe&rdquo; as an integrated polity becomes meaningless). It is 
also worth observing that almost no modern fiat currency monetary unions have 
broken up without some form of authoritarian or military government, or civil 
war.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I would put the likelihood of breakup higher than the report suggests, 
especially over, say, a two year time frame. There is also the possibility that 
the US&rsquo;s debt problems (or those of the UK, or some other large power) 
could lead to payment problems among nations. Perhaps this is an issue I am 
overly worried about. If international finance doesn&rsquo;t 
&ldquo;work,&rdquo; international trade becomes much more cumbersome. It can 
still work, on a more limited scale, with more controls. But it is hard to see 
how we would get the steady stream of new products and replacement parts that 
we now depend upon.</p> <br>

<p>Gail,</p> 
<p>International trade worked before there was an effective international 
finance system. It still works in places where there is no effective 
international finance system: as an example, look at Iran, where even with most 
trade theoretically prohibited, foreign goods are widely available. Or look at 
Somalia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Somalia) where trade 
flourishes in a country with no finance or government in the conventional sense.
</p> 
<p>I can envision widespread international trade even following a complete 
collapse of industrial civilization. Remember that there was trade between 
Europe and China (the Silk Road) over 2000 years ago. Even after a collapse 
some parts of the world will want goods from another part, and have some other 
goods with which to pay for them. For example, a small-scale steel mill may be 
set up, in a town where there is available coking coal and scrap iron, making 
products such as steel tubing for bicycle frames. Another small factory might 
be set up near a rubber plantation to make bicycle tires. Bilateral trade 
between two such enterprises would be logical, and could be carried out by 
small sailing ships using practically no fossil fuel.</p> 
<p>We would no longer be looking for a &ldquo;steady stream of new 
products&rdquo;, but we could still get a steady stream of simple and durable 
products which are beyond the capabilities of local sources.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>
 September 8, 2011 at 12:34 pm <br>

<p>I agree that trade would go on in the way you describe&ndash;bilateral 
trade, using small sailing ships, for example. I don&rsquo;t think it would 
permit our current BAU lifestyle, though. The real test would be whether the 
electrical system could be kept operating&ndash;if there would be enough spare 
parts. Without the electrical system, it is hard to transport oil (pipelines 
use electricity, pumps use electricity) and to refine oil. So we would be at 
risk of losing the oil (and probably natural gas) systems as well.</p> <br>

<p>Perhaps this idea of individual transportation (aka cars, air travel) is 
all we would have to say good by to? This concept is becoming obsolete on many 
fronts.</p> 
<p>Commuting to a job site? Not really needed for most of the workers, only 
old fashioned management styles keeps that concept alive
http://www.teleworkresearchnetwork.com/outdated-management-practices-block-telework-and-flexible-work-styles/6127
<br> (This is not so much fantasy, I and many folks I know can now work from 
anywhere &ndash; choosing home most often; I do not commute any more. And I do 
not need to travel a lot either although in my job a couple years ago one would 
travel &gt;50% of their time. All that thanks to technologies which make a lot 
of personal meetings aspects obsolete).<br>
 Air travel for exotic vacation or 
to meet people in person? C&rsquo;mon &ndash; we can live without that just 
fine.<br>
 Soooo&hellip;.how would a world look like in which the individual 
transportation concept has collapsed? No car industry, whether electric or 
conventional &ndash; simply not needed. No jobs there, no air travel and (or 
very little and highly expensive), no jobs there, related industries shrinking 
or collapsing also. But resources ($, productivity, energy) flowing into other, 
new and yet to emerge industries which would provide the alternatives/similars. 
Food costs will skyrocket &ndash; but that also will probably drive folks to 
try growing stuff close to home.</p> 
<p>Very expensive delivery services (medical, materials, maintenance, goods) 
seem to be needed &ndash; and would this way be shared by many and use much 
less oil compared to our current regular driving to shopping sprees)&hellip;</p>

<p>It is going to be a slower world, we will try to do less. My father 
following his day of work and my little league practice (in our small town), 
thought nothing of sitting on his front porch swing drinking a beer and talking 
to the neighbors who were passing by, or on their own porches. This is how I 
remember the 60&prime;s. He told me that after WW2, it was an even slower 
lifestyle.</p> 
<p>While it is possible that there will be no cars at all in a total doomer 
world, in descent I would say that there will be cars, and it will be what he 
described to me in the 30&prime;s and 40&prime;s. Some people had them in the 
family or whatever, and you borrowed them for the critical trip to the 
hospital, a medical specialist, or a relative&rsquo;s death or a very very 
special event. In Africa I see this for the clinic and funeral all the time. 
There are no cars, but the countryside can be canvassed to hire one for these 
critical trips.</p> 
<p>The problem is rebuilding what was there that allowed for this. In his home 
town, the 1500 square foot slaughter house doesn&rsquo;t exist. The small 
market is gone, as is the truck farming that supported it (they are now all 
dairy). The train station is gone, as are the tracks, but the bed is still 
there. The bus stop (for between towns) went away in the 60&prime;s, but 
interesting returned last year at least for going to the big city (of 45,000).

<p>It would be possible to cut back, but there are limits.</p> 
<p>It would be difficult to run the international companies without air 
travel. At some point, it is necessary to check up on workers in person. In 
China, we hear about companies with fraudulent financial statements. I think 
working with India would be the same.</p> 
<p>There is quite a bit of local work that can&rsquo;t be done long-distance. 
If someone is going to run a day care, it can&rsquo;t be done long distance 
(but it can be done in the home). Making goods usually has to be done in a 
factory. Quite a bit of health care has to be done in person.</p> <br>

<p>Gail, that&rsquo;s an incredibly thorough and well-connected evaluation of 
plug-in vehicles. Great comments from readers, too.</p> 
<p>Let me start with a glimmer of hope, before I move on to the grim reality: 
There are reports the Nissan LEAF battery costs Nissan much less than you state 
in your article:</p> 
<p>
http://gas2.org/2010/05/05/report-nissan-leafs-battery-costs-a-staggeringly-cheap-375kwh-to-produce/
</p> 
<p>This article puts the cost of the LEAF battery at $375/kWh. Of course, this 
begs the question then why the LEAF is still so expensive. The optimistic 
thought is that Nissan is just exploiting its uniquely low battery cost, 
pricing relative to the competition, and reaping the additional profit. Given 
the battery supply constraint (which you mention) there&rsquo;s no point in 
Nissan trying to increase volume with lower prices, since battery supply is not 
very elastic.</p> 
<p>Of course, this glimmer of hope does little to alter the conclusion of your 
article: There are plenty of other factors lined up to limit or negate any 
large-scale social benefit of plug-in vehicles.</p> 
<p>The core of the solution has to be behavioral changes that transform our 
culture into one that requires very little energy-consuming activity in the 
first place, even before we start looking to efficiency. Equipping everyone 
with Priuses that get double the average fuel efficiency does nothing if 
consumers use that to double the miles driven. I&rsquo;ve long advocated the 
most important solutions to transportation emissions are: 1) drive less, 2) 
carpool more, and 3) use more efficient modes of transportation. Without 1 and 
2, there is little hope of 3 having much effect.</p> 
<p>Use of plug-ins falls into category 3. Assuming we can first accomplish 1 
and 2, the discussion of how best to switch to more efficient modes becomes 
relevant. First, there are more efficient modes than personal vehicles, which 
require the transport of 3000 pounds of car to move 150-300 pounds of payload 
(1 or 2 passengers). The most efficient concept in urban environments is 
personal rapid transit (PRT), which uses a 1500 pound pod on an electrified 
monorail to carry up to 6 passengers, a ratio of 250-1500 pounds of vehicle per 
pound of passenger (&ldquo;v/p&rdquo;), compared to 750-300 v/p for a typical 
passenger automobile.</p> 
<p>Setting aside solutions other than personal automobiles, your analysis of 
various vehicle options is right on. Given the constrained battery material 
supply, it&rsquo;s much more effective to equipment many people with 
conventional hybrids than to equip a few people with all-battery plug-ins. 
Unfortunately, social and political factors prevent such an efficient 
deployment of battery resources.</p> 
<p>Taking all factors into account, the best solution would be to equip the 
most needy people with the least expensive vehicles. A wealthy individual 
benefits from a fuel efficient car much less than a poor individual does. 
Ideally, the poorest car buyers should get the largest subsidies to purchase 
the most efficient cars. Of course, this is a socialist idea that would never 
gain traction in the U.S.</p> 
<p>A (slightly) more acceptable alternative might be to give incentives to 
lower income buyers of second-hand plug-in vehicles. The elites who purchase 
the new plug-in vehicles will then have some (a little) financial incentive to 
support this program and the poor would benefit. Of course, we all benefit when 
the poor have access to affordable transportation to get them to work. One 
condition of this second hand purchase incentive program should be that a 
government or independent agency inspect the battery for all vehicles resold 
under this program, to ensure that the second-hand buyer gets a battery in 
reasonably good shape.</p> 
<p>Speaking of which, a battery inspection program should become a routine 
part of any plug-in vehicle resale. This would be no different than inspecting 
the engine on a gasoline car before resale. In fact, inspecting a battery 
should be easier than inspecting a more complicated gasoline engine. All you 
would need is a single battery cycle test and a certified test result, much 
like a smog check, which is routine in California.</p> 
<p>In the absence of any measures to incentivize the most effective 
distribution of limited battery resources, what should an individual buyer do? 
I&rsquo;ve been driving fuel efficient vehicles since 1998, hybrids since 2000, 
and a plug-in since this year. I recognized that the plug-in was a less 
effective use of battery resources than a hybrid. If there was a system in 
place to encourage efficient distribution of battery resources, I would gladly 
participate in and support in. In the absence of such a system, I can only act 
in my own personal best interest, which was to buy the plug-in.</p> 
<p>Your article questions the lifetime cost-efficiency of a plug-in, but given 
that the driving infrastructure is unlikely to last the life of a new car, the 
lifetime cost-efficiency becomes irrelevant. What is relevant (again in the 
absence of a larger action) is how best I can make use of the remaining driving 
infrastructure. Given the insecurity of petroleum based transportation, the 
plug-in vehicle gives me transportation security that a conventional hybrid 
does not.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect to be able to make use of any car for more than about 
5-10 years, but during that time, having a plug-in maximizes the chances of my 
being able to make use of the car.</p> 
<p>Again, thanks for committing your thorough and systematic analysis into a 
well-written article, and thanks to the readers who post insightful comments. I 
hope I&rsquo;ve added value to the discussion.</p> <br>

<p>You have raised an interesting point which is part of my thinking, I 
don&rsquo;t assume that the driving infrastructure will remain at its current 
quality (high), that it will decline dramatically. This influences what kind of 
NEV/LEV plugins that I am interested in, we own a Prius which I&rsquo;ve 
contemplated giving to my step daughter, and buying something 
&ldquo;better&rdquo;, either the new Prius hybrid or Leaf/Volt. But none of 
them in my mind as low 2 wheel drive vehicles be able to survive what I believe 
the road will look like in 10 years. However my Polaris LEV will, in fact I 
still use more offroad then onroad. Even though I think the GEM NEV&rsquo;s are 
ugly, what stops me ultimately from buying its flatbed truck version is its 
reliance on high quality toads.</p> <br>

<br> Yes, they sold 181. One hundred and eighty one sold between January and 
July in a country with more than 20 million personal cars.<br>
 Last year in 
the same period they&rsquo;d sold 16 EVs.<br>
 In the same period this year 
they sold 6,467 hybrids and more than 500.000 fuel vehicles and that in spite 
of a severe economic crisis and 20% unemployment</p> 
<p>In spite of aid from the government of up to 6,000 euros per car, in a fund 
of 76 million euros. Only 2% of businesses consider buying EVs after studying 
their problems, and specially the resale value, next to nothing.<br>

<p>The Oil Drum has more or less said they will not publish the post. One 
reason given (by one of the staff members) was that resale value 
shouldn&rsquo;t be brought up, because it isn&rsquo;t an engineering issue. 
(Give me a break!) He also was arguing that things might get much better, 
cost-wise. What would cost improvements do to resale values of the 
first-generation cars?</p> 
<p>I can see, though, that my wording is probably too strong for a very 
&ldquo;green&rdquo; audience, that is hoping for plug-ins to save them.</p> <br>

<p>From what I can perceive (if we ignore for a moment that maintaining 
private transport as the primary means of travel is in big trouble, no matter 
how we try to do it) full-electric plug-in vehicles have so many disadvantages 
that they won&rsquo;t make it in the market place. Especially in view of the 
fact that a turbo charged diesel vehicle ends up arguably emitting less 
pollution whilst maintaining all the advantages of the traditional petrol 
engined car.</p> 
<p>Like it or not, private cars will be part of the transport mix for the next 
umpteen years, but it seems that, unless there are incredible advances in 
electric technology, super efficient fossil fueled engines, coupled with 
downsizing of vehicle weight, will easily win the day.</p> <br>

<p>ICE is here to stay, agreed. But I think the focus on recreating the ICE 
experience is the problem, and this is due to the Detroit mentality and its 
inability to bring out a different class of vehicles (at least since the 
mini-van). Plug-in works for a different class, call it 2 seater, 35 miles, 
35mph using lead acid batteries. The regulatory framework almost exists here in 
the Federal NEV and LEV regulations, what is missing in the regulations is 
35mph, it is currently capped at 25mph.</p> 
<p>The GEM, Polaris, and others who have been working in or towards those 
regulations may make that class more of a reality, but it is going to take more 
entrants with different designs (i think the GEM is incredibly ugly for 
instance), and different price points.</p> 
<p>At another angle, with the availability of a number of electric 
motorcycles, I wonder when someone will simply use the trike angle and build an 
enclosed electric one.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> gailtheactuary says: <br>
 September 13, 2011 at 1:05 pm <br>

<p>Regarding the enclosed motorcycle, I think part of it may have to do with 
when a vehicle becomes too close to something that is regulated by crash-worthy 
tests.</p> 
<p>With all of the vehicles, there is a problem of integrating them into the 
mix that is currently available. I know that in China, there have been problems 
with electric bicycles going too fast relative to regular bicycles, and there 
being accidents. If there is a bike like with lots of regular bikes, and not 
too many electrics, I can see this would be a problem.</p> 
<p>There are many versions of the problem. It is hard to add a new class of 
vehicles, for this reason.</p> <br>

<ul> 
<li> schoff says: <br>
 September 13, 2011 at 3:44 pm <br>

<p>that is a good point. undoubtedly it is hard. For GEM that is probably why 
they focused their initial marketing on campus&rsquo;s, military bases, places 
like that. i would imagine that the downtown environments of California like 
MountainView would work just fine as well since the speed limit of 25mph and 
the &ldquo;rule of law&rdquo; both operate there. My entire town of 45,000 
people is either 25 or 35mph and the rule of law operates there as well. 
I&rsquo;d like<br>
 to believe that I could drive them now in my town without 
problems; however, i will wait<br>
 another five or so years of descent when 
half the traffic is gone&hellip;.</p> <br>

<p>It would be better to make more High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes than 
push EV too hard imho. Although I would say a modest battery with 5 mile range 
would be useful for zeroing out gasoline consumption for most small trips. That 
type of battery would make for a better hybrid that can get some range from the 
electric grid, especially if coupled to night time recharging using a simple

<p>While it is going to be a few more miles than that (15), I think the Prius 
plug in could be a game changer over the next five years. I think your model of 
thinking, &ldquo;zeroing out&rdquo; trips could become a cultural phenomena for 
drivers of this (and like designed) vehicles. Like many people, I try to 
organize trips to make a number of stops, and if I run out of milk, 
2&times;4&prime;s, or whatever, i simply don&rsquo;t go back out for that until 
I have another trip of multi-stops. I think with this new Prius plug in will 
help me give up on certain retail experiences and settle on closer solutions 
for Pizza, milk, 2&times;4&prime;s, whatever. If I can charge it on my solar 
panels then in my mind it is a free trip.</p> <br>

<p>It is no longer necessary to guess or estimate the costs of running an 
electric car, maintenance, battery costs etc as the figures are available on 
the Renault website for vehicles you can actually order, together with a 
maintenance contract, and conveniently the batteries are leased to the cost 
shows separately and covers depreciation.<br>
 We only have the figures for the 
Kangoo van at the moment, and unfortunately that does not qualify for a subsidy 
in the UK, so the purchase price is around 5,000 Euros more than the equivalent 
diesel but in France they are about the same.<br>
 Renault reckon that by the 
time they hit around 500,000 &ndash; 1 million electric vehicle sales of all 
types they will be able to sell for the same price as the diesel without the 
subsidy.<br>
 Here is the Renault Fr website for those comfortable in French:
<br> 
http://www.renault-ze.com/fr-fr/gamme-z.e./renault-kangoo-express-z.e./presentation-15.html
</p> 
<p>And here is the full pdf of the prices for battery hire and so on for 
Renault UK:<br>
http://www.renault.co.uk/resources/PDF/brochures/ze_pg.pdf</p> 
<p>A bit of calculation shows that off-setting battery hire and electricity 
against petrol in an urban environment and allowing 3 miles per kwh to cover 
the extra draw from heating etc and using &pound;1.33/litre the petrol price at 
maybe 8 miles/litre or so you are several hundred pounds a year better off with 
the electric vehicle, enough very roughly to cover the excise duty payable on 
petrol, so in the US it would be pretty well a wash.</p> 
<p>It should be noted though that the first service occurs after a year or 
12,000 miles, with services thereafter only at 25,000 mile intervals.<br>
 This 
is a considerable saving, and Renault should you choose to go for a maintenance 
contract do it for 80% of the diesel price.</p> 
<p>No doubt some will want to argue that Renault have got their sums wrong, 
but for customers the answers are in.<br>
 The electric vehicle in cheaper in 
Europe, likely comparable in the US, and as subsidies reduce there are good 
prospects of being able to still remain competitive whilst shouldering their 
full share of taxation, and low maintenance costs are thrown in as a freebie.

<p>.Zero-emission vehicles are eco-friendly vehicles such as electric vehicles 
EVs and fuel-cell vehicles FCVs that have no tailpipe emissions of CO2 or other 
gases..We believe the potential for zero-emission vehicles is extremely 
promising. .Electric vehicles are often confused with hybrid vehicles which run 
on a combination of a gasoline engine and electric motor. The difference is 
that electric vehicles require no gas have no tailpipe and therefore are free 
from emissions..There are a range of environmentally-friendly technologies 
available today including efficient internal-combustion engines clean diesels 
hybrids electric cars and fuel cell vehicles.</p> <br>

<p>The vast majority of cars on the road today are far more powerful than they 
need to be to get a few people (and often only one person) from one place to 
another. This is because gasoline has been very cheap for the last 80 years. In 
addition, many people, like me, are driving gas guzzeling monsters (2000 
Expedition) because they like, and can still afford, big vehicles, or because 
they drive little, or got them used at a low price. Millions of people drive 
pick-ups who never haul a thing. These big, overpowered vehicles waste vast 
amounts of gasoline. (I&rsquo;m retired in small town Slidell, LA, so a tank 
last me for over a month. And the huge monster may keep me out of intensive 
care if someone on the cell phone hits me. A hospital stay can buy truck loads 
of gasoline.)<br>
 Don&rsquo;t write off the electric car. Metals can be 
discovered and recycled. When I was a kid back in the stone age, cars were junk 
after 100,000 miles. Now people can get 200,000 miles, or more, out of them. 
Better lubricants, manufacturing methods, and materials make a big difference 
in durability. Mass production, using ever more complex robots, can lower 
production cost. Electric motors can last decades. I used to live next to a 
sewer lift station. Those GE motors ran for decades inside a hot concrete 
building. With the latest materials and coatings, the body of a car, in places 
where salt wasn&rsquo;t used on the roads, could be built to last for 30 years. 
The batteries would be the only thing that would need to be exchanged. Electric 
motors can be easily replaced. They can be rewound without the need for much 
additional copper being mined. Many work trips will be able to be accomplished 
without using any gasoline or diesel. That will save a lot of money to use to 
buy the car. Better batteries will be invented. A few days ago, I read about a 
research group that invented a new gel lithium battery, which they claim will 
be better and cheaper to produce than the current ones. And people aren&rsquo;t 
going to throw away their used electric cars. Once enought of them are 
manufactured, a used vehicle market will develop. The used ones won&rsquo;t 
sell for $40,000.<br>
 I&rsquo;m not saying that peak oil won&rsquo;t be a big 
crisis. It will cause a financial mess as it destroys a lot of demand by 
decreasing disposable income. But we all won&rsquo;t be riding bicycles next 
decade. It is a big planet with a lot of minerals still to be discovered. They 
just found an enormous copper deposit right near the Southern Alaska coast. 
There is no way to find a lot of minerals without drilling a hole and knowing 
what is coming out of it. A Canadian company recently found a big rare earth 
deposit in Nebraska. We will be poorer in the future than we are today, but we 
won&rsquo;t disappear anytime soon.</p> <br>

<p>Bill,<br>
 Unfortunately, gas-guzzling monsters are still the logical 
choice for many Americans. Fuel costs even for these &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; are 
a trivial part of the cost of owning and running them unless you are putting a 
lot of miles on them. The purchase price, insurance and taxes for many SUVs and 
pickups are very much the same as for smaller, fuel efficient cars. For 
example, I can get a brand new Ford F-150 truck in Houston for $21166. The 
cheapest Toyota Prius is $24565, and the cheapest VW Jetta TDI is $24401. The 
insurance on the Ford is probably less than either of the fuel efficient 
vehicles because it will cost a lot less to repair if it is in an accident, and 
any mechanical repairs for the Ford will cost much less. The conventional 
body-on-frame construction is simpler to repair and to service, and parts 
probably cost less.</p> 
<p>So why pay more for something that costs more to own, even if it does use 
less fuel?</p> 
<p>But you are quite right about the ridiculous amount of power today&rsquo;s 
cars and trucks have. The Ford Model T was the worlds most popular car for more 
than a decade a century ago, and it had all of 22 horsepower. More recently, 
the original VW Beetle made do with 34 horsepower, even when first sold in the 
U.S.A.</p> 
<p>Even the original Ford V8 of the 1930s, praised by Clyde Barrow for its 
performance escaping from police, had only 65 horsepower.</p> 
<p>But there are few motor vehicles currently sold in the U.S. with less than 
100 horsepower (the Smart Fortwo, with 70HP is the only one I know of). Even 
small economy cars such as the Nissan Versa (122HP), the Ford Fiesta (120HP) 
and the Chevrolet Cruze (136HP) have engines as powerful as the base engines 
offered with the full-size gas-guzzlers of the 1950s such as the 1952 Ford 
Customline (110HP) and the 1954 Chevrolet Bel Air (123HP). I can remember a 
comment by an engineer in about 1952 (I wish I could remember who it was): 
&ldquo;Any car with over 100HP is either too big or overpowered.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<p>You have a pretty strong point on fuel costs. For example, I can estimate 
that if I either rode a bike or commuted with my friend using her car that I 
could save at most $1000 a year in fuel costs. Now my friend who lives in 
Indiana and drives 50+ miles per day decided to go for a Prius. She just hated 
the gasoline station and wasting her money she said.</p> <br>

<p>I miss my 2.8L 4&times;4 extended cab 1985 s10 pickup, it had 110 hp. i did 
everything with that vehicle from firewood to towing a 25 foot boat on a 
trailer (carefully and sometimes with the heater on in the summer to keep the 
engine cool). My V6 190hp tacoma 4&times;4 is definitely too much for the 
firewood, trailering, and towing that I do, except that when i get on the 
thruway they really expect me to go to 75mph. i think that is part of the 
problem&hellip;&hellip;.</p> 
<p>as for cars, i simply don&rsquo;t understand the hp mind set there at all.
