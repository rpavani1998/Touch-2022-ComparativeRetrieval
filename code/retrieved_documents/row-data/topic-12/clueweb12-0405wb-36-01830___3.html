<ul> 
<li> newsmoo  May 2005 Permalink <br>
 My boyfriend and I want to spend 2 
weeks in September visiting the following places:-<br>
Poland - Warsaw &amp; 
Malbork<br>
Lithuania - Vilnius <br>
Estonia - Tallin <br>
Sweden - Stockholm 
&amp; Gothenburg<br>
<br>
I have looked at train journey lenghts from country 
to country in the Europe Rough Guide book but cannot see anything about a 
direct link between Vilnius and Tallin. Has anyone travelled this route or any 
of the other routes we are planning. What is the best way to travel from Tallin 
to Stockholm - boat or plane? Any information or advice would be gratefully 
received. </li>

 Are you in the UK? <br>
<br>
If so watch 
BBC3 2030 on Thursday nights. There is a woman doing a tour of the old Eastern 
Bloc - most of which is on train.<br>
<br>
She is a bit of a rubbish presenter 
but last night (05/05)she was in Vilnius and next week (12/05) she is in Tallin 
- getting the train inbetween. If you watch it there might be some clues about 
what the journey is like?<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>

 Haven't heard that there is a 
train from Vilnius to Tallinn (I am Estonian).<br>
The choices I am aware: 
plane or bus (the previous link is correct - Eurolines) </li>

You have to go via Riga and then 4-5 hour by coach to Tallinn. their 
is no direct train from Vilnius to Tallinn. </li>

 I think traveling by bus between 
Vilnius to Tallinn is better option as there is no train connection between 
them. </li>
