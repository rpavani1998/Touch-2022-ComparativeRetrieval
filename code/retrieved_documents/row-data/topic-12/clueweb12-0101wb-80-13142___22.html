<h3>Understanding the Ultra Portable</h3> 
<p>Before we get anywhere in this review, we have to have <em>the talk</em>. A 
friend of mine likes to call this talk a DTR, or Defining the Relationship. 
Usually with her it refers to something romantic but with the MacBook Air there 
are many similarities. It needs to be very clear what your expectations are of 
it and what sort of relationship you plan on having with the notebook in order 
to avoid something unpleasant.</p> 
<p><br>
 Are you going home with it? </p> 
<p>When Apple announced the MacBook Air, it was met with harsh criticism from 
many; it was almost as if the Air was being treated as the next MacBook Pro 
instead of an ultra portable Mac.</p> 
<p>Let me give you an example. Back in college I needed a notebook to take to 
class with me that I could take notes on and email/browse with during class 
(not all lectures were as captivating as I&rsquo;d like). Lugging even a 
5-pound notebook around to class was a pain, I wanted something whose weight 
and form factor resembled its name; I wanted a notebook, something very thin, 
very light and just as easy as a pad of paper to carry around with me.</p> 
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t going to be my ultimate work machine, I wasn&rsquo;t 
going to be running Photoshop on it, I just needed it to do some basic writing 
and web browsing. In many senses all I needed was a notebook-sized iPhone.</p> 
<p>Since writing and basic internet access were the main duties of this 
machine, things like hard disk space, having an internal optical drive and 
absolute performance weren&rsquo;t really concerns; running Notepad or TextEdit 
just doesn&rsquo;t require much. At the same time, having a good keyboard, a 
killer form factor and keeping weight down were all more important than with a 
regular notebook.</p> 
<p>Historically the ultra portable has been first and foremost, a very light 
notebook. The first ultra portables were around 3 lbs, but over the years 
we&rsquo;ve seen entries into the space weigh in at less than 2 lbs. If you 
look at the weight of a textbook and remember how much you hated lugging that 
around in school, you&rsquo;ll understand how even a 1 pound difference in 
notebook weight can make a big difference.</p> 
<p>The weight side of an ultra portable is only one facet of importance, form 
factor is the other. This thing has to feel small in your hands when carrying 
it around, it has to feel just as natural and painless as carrying a paper 
notebook around.</p> 
<p>The problem is that in the quest for small size and ultimate lightness, a 
number of sacrifices are made. Performance, keyboard, screen size/resolution, 
expansion, durability, battery life and price are all areas that you have to 
make sacrifices in if you want an ultra portable notebook.</p> 
<p>You give up performance because the cooling and power requirements of a 
high speed CPU just aren&rsquo;t possible to satisfy given the form factor and 
weight requirements of an ultra portable. There&rsquo;s no budget for a large 
battery and heatsinks need to be on the order of millimeters in thickness. 
Ultra Low Voltage CPUs are generally preferred here and it&rsquo;s only 
recently that we&rsquo;ve seen ultra portables really get faster than 1GHz.</p> 
<p>The screen size of a notebook actually determines the keyboard layout and 
size. In order to keep power consumption down, smaller screens with cramped 
resolutions are the norm in the ultra portable space. With a smaller screen, 
the keyboard that the screen covers when closed is similarly tiny. These two 
limitations generally run in contrary to one of the main uses for having an 
ultra portable: writing a lot becomes difficult. I owned a Sony X505 imported 
from Japan and it got me through my last year of college, but the keyboard was 
terrible to type on. It had a Japanese key layout so some of the key labels 
were in the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; places. I had to rely on memory of a US 
keyboard layout to figure out which one to hit which is more difficult than 
you&rsquo;d think on a keyboard with very small keys. Writing normal sentences 
wasn&rsquo;t a problem, it&rsquo;s the punctuation that really threw me off. My 
hands always had to do this strange ballet/gymnastics move in order to 
punctuate anything, which eventually drove me away from the notebook.</p> 
<p>Expansion is an obvious problem; most of the ultra portables I&rsquo;ve 
owned over the years didn&rsquo;t have integrated optical drives, which made 
installing applications or just reading a disc handed to me while on the road 
frustratingly impossible.</p> 
<p>In order to keep things light, ultra portables generally have tiny 
batteries and are built out of very lightweight materials - resulting in poor 
battery life and a hardly durable feel. The durability issue is compounded by 
the notebooks being very thin, which only makes them feel more likely to break. 
Admittedly I&rsquo;ve never had an ultra portable break on me, but I&rsquo;ve 
also never really dropped one. They do develop creaks over time just like other 
notebooks, there&rsquo;s just no getting around that.</p> 
<p>And finally we have the issue of price; the culmination of all of these 
sacrifices is a very light weight, very portable device...that also costs a 
great deal of money. Spending $2K - $3K on an ultra portable isn&rsquo;t out of 
the ordinary.</p> 
<p>Many consider Apple to be a leader in the computing world, but in many ways 
it is an attentive follower. Apple hasn&rsquo;t historically been the first to 
introduce a new type of device, but rather a company that looks at where others 
have done poorly and attempts to do better. Apple didn&rsquo;t invent the ultra 
portable, but with the MacBook Air it&rsquo;s attempting to do it right.</p> 
<p>With that pesky DTR out of the way, let&rsquo;s get to know the Air a bit 
better.</p> 
<h3>The Air on Paper</h3> 
<p>On paper, the MacBook Air's size is impressive until you compare it to the 
MacBook - in many ways the Air is just a thinner MacBook. The screen is 
identical and the footprint is virtually unchanged. The two pounds Apple has 
managed to shave off and the reduction in thickness are huge, regardless of how 
small they may seem in numerical form.</p> &nbsp; <strong><strong>MacBook Air

Hmmm... by bsozak on <em>
Monday, January 18, 2010</em>  For the price difference between the two it 
seems hard for me to justify the SSD version, though intuitively it would seem 
like the advantages would be greater. The odd thing to me is the number of 
people who claim to really notice the difference, even though the benchmarks 
don't seem to be that drastically different in a lot of areas.<br>
<br>
I also 
wonder if the type of SSD makes a difference? I've heard great things about 
Runcore SSD which has some really good pricing here - but if I end up dropping 
that kind of coin for moderately better performance, I don't think I'd be too 
happy.  bsozak <br>

drink the koolaid children! by steveyballmer on <em>Tuesday, July 08, 2008</em> 
 It is amazing to me that so many people can't seem to see through the Steve 
Jobs Reality Distortion Field! Everytime he gets up at one of his sissy-boy 
&quot;conventions&quot; he performs cheap magic tricks for the faithful, 
sometimes he even drags well meaning journalist along with him!<br>
The platter 
he is serving on in this picture is a &quot;Macbook&quot; (even though it's 
thinner than a magazine) Hot Air.<br>
Think about it, you are getting less for 
more! Skinny for plenty! Scrawney for money! Slim for uh, um, I can't think of 
a rhyme but if I could it would be something bad.<br>
PEOPLE, PEOPLE, PEOPLE!

Windows on MBA? by RedWolf on <em>Thursday, 
February 21, 2008</em>  The start of the review comes off as a bit too 
pro-apple. It was quite thorough and by the end, I didn't feel the same 
pro-apple bias. I thought the comparison to the Ferrari was excellent. The MBA 
is a luxury. If you can't afford two laptops you should get a more practical 
laptop and skip the MBA.<br>
<br>
I was dissappointed in the lack of a mention 
of Windows on the MBA. My Dell Inspiron 700M is getting a bit old and I'm 
looking for a replacement. I have a need to run windows regularly. How does the 
MBA run windows in bootcamp? Does the drive sharing work?<br>
<br>
I can see 
the MBA working for people who have the money to spend on a third computer 
(second laptop) and for anyone who does a lot of typing but needs a laptop that 
can be carried around. I can also see it working for my wife (the primary user 
of our 700M). She wants something that is light and easy to carry around the 
house. One of my biggest complaints about my 700M is the cramped keyboard. A 
full size keyboard would be wonderful.  RedWolf <br>

Good Review Overall by kac77 on <em>
Tuesday, February 19, 2008</em>  I feel the review was good overall. But really 
I think the MBA was put in the most positive light as possible. Everyone says 
it's a niche product, well what niche is that?? Once you start to go deeper the 
whole niche theory, or &quot;Its not made for you&quot; aspect starts to appear 
rather light in common sense. Lets look at the supposed markets:<br>
<br>

College Students<br>
<br>
OK the MBA could possibly work it here. However, how 
many of you had two computers when at college? The MBA really does require a 
companion PC in order to assure the buyer that he/her can reinstall the OS if 
problems arise. In addition, having 1 USB port in college would be insane. When 
I was in College mine got a thorough work out. I transferred files to and from 
via USB drives, logging onto the network, installing software which was apart 
of the class. That one USB would be a hindrance no matter how you look at it.
<br> <br>
<br>
Traveling Managers (Marketing or Sales I presume) <br>
<br>

These people use their laptops even more than college people do. They are 
designing presentations. Most of them require the need to VPN into their office 
network in order to retrieve misc files they might require. They are 
downloading email often from remote locations so having 3G capability would be 
mandatory. Since there isn't a express port or PCMIA slot they are stuck with 
WIFI?? Trust me on this the sales guy isn't sitting in Starbucks in order to 
download his/her email or work on the latest spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
These points 
are what I'm talking about. When you just scratch the surface it appears fine 
but when you go deeper the lack of ports, no drive, no 3G, no Ethernet, (and 
no, being in IT I am not going to have the Marketing department change their 
own battery or hard drive) I think it makes the MBA become more of a product 
you get to do small work on a weekend when you happen to want a latte.<br>
<br>

Finally what wasn&rsquo;t touched on at all, transferring files from the host 
PC. Most likely you are going to want to put some music on your computer, or 
just sync those files that you need for work. I&rsquo;ve heard reviews from 
other sites that this process can take way more than 2.5 hours more like 5 or 
more. Some weren&rsquo;t even able to complete the process without using the 
Ethernet dongle. In addition, you can&rsquo;t use the one USB port with the 
Migration Assistant. Just how much weight would have been added to put on 
FireWire anyway???<br>
<br>
The overall thing with this device is that in order 
to achieve a baseline of functionality you are conceivably carrying around an 
Ethernet dongle, possibly the Super Drive (probably not in college, but most 
definitely if you are traveling) a USB extension cord, plus some sort of 3G 
device if you really want to be mobile. Once you are carrying around all of 
these things have you really saved any weight? With 3G this product really 
would have made some sense. The argument to looking forward where all 
information is on a network somewhere or at home would have held some weight. 
Without it the product comes off as trying to sell a drowning man a glass of 
water.<br>
<br>
This device really has one market &hellip;the CEO. This is a 
person who checks email at home or in the office isn&rsquo;t really going to be 
accessing the VPN much from a remote location. Having 1 USB port would be fine. 
He isn&rsquo;t doing the presentations, someone else usually is. At best while 
on the go he&rsquo;s taking notes. For this person this device makes perfect 
sense but for anyone else I just don&rsquo;t see it.<br>

Great review! by MacTheSpoon on <em>Saturday, February 16, 2008</em>  Thanks 
very much, this was a really comprehensive, excellent review!  MacTheSpoon <br>

Reply <br>
3 things... by Phrozt on <em>Friday, February 15, 2008</em>  Two 
comments about the benchmarks, one question about the battery.<br>
<br>
First, 
about the battery. It's been said that one of the shortcomings of the iPhone is 
that there are a limited number of times the battery can be charged. Does the 
Air suffer this same fate? Obviously this would have less of an impact than the 
iPhone situation, because the battery can clearly be removed and therefore 
replaced, but I'm still wondering about it's limits (especially after the 
mention of the 8 hour bug).<br>
<br>
As for the benchmarks, I think something 
needs to be said about the differences of expectations in real world use (in 
regards to the SSD vs. stock HDD argument). You said that you noticed 
everything starting/working quicker w/the SSD, but the benchmarks showed that 
in write situations, it showed an obvious disadvantage. I think it's important 
that you stress real world expectations in this situation. The more you use a 
computer, the more your expectations change. You *want* a program to start up 
at the snap of your fingers, but you *expect* saves/exports/transfers to take a 
long time. Therefore, from a real world useability standpoint, the SSD would be 
much better experience, because it improves in the areas where you have high 
expectations, and only falters in areas that you already have low expectations.
<br> <br>
Finally, about the usage tests. All three of these tests are heavily 
read reliant with almost no writing. Since the SSD takes longer to complete 
write projects, and therefore more energy overall to complete the process, I 
would be interested to see what the usage time would be if you were to script 
out a process that included a lot of PDF/image/file conversions/saves.<br>
<br>

All in all, a very good, in-depth and objective review. Wonderful job.  Phrozt

MBA ultraportable by totenkopf on <em>Friday, February 15, 2008
</em>  &quot;Thinner and lighter&quot; only covers about two thirds of 
ultraportable, It's still basically the same footprint... how is that helpful? 
Can you not handle two extra pounds and the oppressive thickness of the mac 
book? When you open it up it's the same size as the rest of the mac books! If 
you take an old walkie-talkie cellphone and make it lighter and slimmer and 
than call it ultra portable... IT STILL DOESN'T FIT IN YOUR POCKET! , They 
completely missed the point of the ultra portable! The asus eee can operate as 
an extension of your desktop by allowing you to write, surf and accomplish 
minor tasks away from your primary machine. Yes, it is not the most comfortable 
on the eyes or the hands... It's not supposed to be! Apple was afraid to make 
the necessary sacrifices to make a true ultra portable computer.<br>
<br>
As a 
thin laptop it's a failure! No removable battery? What if i want to use some 
optical media on a train/bus/plane? I have to plug in some stupid portable 
optical drive? that isn't convenience that's a tragedy. I don't care how nice 
the display looks if i'm looking at a machine with worse specs than a $700 
cheaper mac book. Once again, Apple is selling form over function... that's 
right, you get nothing extra for your money, just the envy of other iNerds.<br>

<br>And to the author: describing it as a ferrari is laughable. True, it isn't 
fit for use as your primary machine, but isn't it supposed to perform better 
than your primary machine? I'd call it the mac book &quot;airhead&quot;. It's 
like that blonde, oxygen thief piece of arm candy you always wanted to make you 
look good around your friends!It doesn't actually do anything very well, but at 
least it's inadequate for everyday use.  totenkopf <br>
