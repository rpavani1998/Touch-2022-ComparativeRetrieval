<h3>Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Fri Jan 07, 2011 6:15 pm </p>  Hi, <br>
<br>
Thanks so much for visiting 
my post, I really need some help from all of you Canadians that are living or 
have lived in the UK.<br>
<br>
First some background: I am a Canadian currently 
living in San Francisco, and I like it here for the most part. I always wanted 
to live in Europe, not necessarily theUK but Europe. I have been a number of 
times to both the UK andEurope traveling but have never had the pleasure of 
living there. obviously if I were to move across the pond it would be to the UK 
for obvious language reasons.<br>
<br>
My wife is key to this as she was born 
in Canada to a British father and an American mother - she has all 3 
citizenships (passports). she has never wanted to to live in the UK but we both 
agreed that we wanted to do something different and live somewhere outside of 
Canada more specifically Toronto. We ended up moving to San Francisco as this 
was one of 2 places in the US I was willing to move (New York is the other;)) 
So we are here and we are good here for the most part. some things are lacking 
here - lack of worldliness with the people, the stupidest healthcare system one 
could possibly create and fox news taken seriously are a few examples.<br>
<br>

So recently we were pondering what we should do with ourselves here and my wife 
is now considering moving to the UK. the feeling that I had prior to this move 
isn't as strong. I mean I would love to move there, but I don't want to risk it 
at the expense of what we have here, which is good job, nice weather and find 
out that it was a mistake and that it's not that great a life over there. so 
when she posed this to me I really began to research what other people's 
experiences are who did move there. and I am getting really mixed messages with 
the more in the negative.<br>
<br>
This is where you come in: <br>
<br>
I was 
wondering if fellow Canadians (or non-canadians with similar stories) who did 
move over there could share their experiences and sort of describe if it's been 
a worthwhile experience. don't get me wrong I want to move there, I'm just not 
in place where I can go and find out (like I could of prior to this move). I 
would like a little bit of a educated decision as I don't want to move there 
and regret it, and based on a lot of peoples experiences, it seems people for 
the most part are not happy.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much Top <br>

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Tue Jan 11, 2011 9:30 am </p>  I am in your boat, the research that I have 
done so far says - no, don't do it. Life in North America is so much better. I 
have known at least three people in various stages of life and career that have 
done theUK thing and have not been happy. <br>
<br>
My husband spent half a 
year in his early 20s - hates and never wants to go back. But would live in San 
Diego (I know you are in San Fran - one of my fave cities too! and NYC - I 
lived there)...<br>
<br>
My friend went there to be with her British BF, but 
lasted about a year - came back to NYC missing everything and everyone (the BF 
went back to NYC with her - and he is much happier there too - and he is a 
Brit!).<br>
<br>
The only person I knew who kind of liked it was a young 
ambitious woman who just had no cares in the world had a decent job in the UK 
and spent all her money traveling to Ibiza and partying.<br>
<br>
For me, I am 
not impressed with the salaries offered for someone in my profession - and the 
level of expenses (rent, transportation, food).<br>
<br>
Comparatively 
speaking, you will cut in half the quality of living when you move there from 
North America. This is what's stopping me. But the experience is something I 
would like to have (and the travel nut in me is excited about exploring more of 
Europe)... Top <br>

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Fri Jan 14, 2011 4:25 pm </p>  I've been here (London) for two years. My 
intention when moving here was to settle here in theUK permanently. I took on a 
permanent job and planned to wait out my work visas until becoming eligible for 
indefinite leave to remain, and continue from there.<br>
<br>
I've been here 
long enough to have gotten over most of the adjusting and the initial 
questioning, homesickness, unsettled feelings. I've settled now. I have a 
partner, a home, a life, here in the UK.<br>
<br>
You need to make your own 
decision. But on reading your post, if it was me in your position, I would not 
move here. That's just me. You might find it different. But you would be giving 
up what sounds like a good existence there, with a good quality of life and 
lots of positives going for you. It's hard to live here. Just normal ordinary 
life is much more difficult, at least speaking from a London perspective it 
certainly is. Things like grocery shopping, doing laundry, getting from point a 
to point b - these things are far less convenient than in north america. It's 
not a huge deal, but it seems to gradually build over time. At least it has for 
me. And it's true about how expensive everything is. I've always been a good 
saver, but here, I never have a penny to spare and pay the equivalent in rent 
every month that would purchase 1 car per month in Canada. Seriously. And the 
people are another thing to adjust to - not always a positive thing, at least 
not in London.<br>
<br>
It seems to me like you're looking for an adventure. 
Perhaps a temporary stay in the UK would be fun, but not at the risk of losing 
what you currently have. Perhaps there's another way of adding that element to 
your lives rather than sacrificing what you've got to move to the UK? Would you 
be able to take a leave of absence from your work and do some exploring around 
Europe, then return to your home?<br>
<br>
Or have you considered somewhere of 
comparative quality of life, yet still a change, like perhaps Vancouver?<br>

<br>I don't regret coming here. But I do miss the comfort and convenience of my 
life in Canada, and all my loved ones there. I think if I could do this again, 
I would choose NOT to come to the UK, and would stay in Canada. But the thing 
is, I couldn't have come to that realisation unless I had moved to the UK in 
the first place and had the experiences I have had. So, no regrets. Just wisdom 
gained. Character built. Blah blah...<br>
<br>
I hope this helps and doesn't 
make the decision even more difficult for you. Top <br>

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Fri Jan 21, 2011 12:43 pm </p>  I would have to agree that moving to the UK
 on a permanent basis isnt a good idea.. I have moved to the UK from Canada 
about six months ago to join my spouse I still havent adjusted yet. and the 
weather is horrible and its sooooo expensive especially with the VAT up to 20% 
and i thought the new HST in Canada was bad LOL also the jobs here are not as 
good in canada from a administration point of view in regards to annual 
salary.. anyways its ok for a temp place to do some travelling thruEurope but I 
plan on moving back to Toronto by the time my visa expires...<br>

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Thu Jan 27, 2011 4:49 am </p>  Jerms, it depends on what you want. I moved 
here with my British husband 19 years ago and raised two children here.<br>
<br>
The thing is, if you like driving your car at cheaper gas prices, living in a 
detached house etc, you won't like most of Europe, including the UK. It's not 
set up for convenient living and all-night cafes, stores etc are thin on the 
ground. Since I grew up in central Toronto I wasn't used to much of this North 
American convenience and it didn't matter to me.<br>
<br>
There are advantages 
to theUK (and I'm speaking mostly of England here). You can visit many more 
interesting places on weekends - castles, stately homes, enormous numbers of 
museums and the countryside. Yes, it's a tiny place, but very picturesque and 
there are many footpaths with &quot;the right to roam&quot; - so you can walk 
over someone's land in the country. This is a huge pleasure. If you have a 
permanent job, you often get 5 weeks of holidays, too. The National Health 
Service, while it has its faults, will treat you free and unlike in Canada, it 
also includes cheap dentistry - what about a checkup for the equivalent of 25 
US dollars?<br>
<br>
If you're into culture, it's fantastic. Even with the 
current cuts (more of that later) they subsidise far more theatre, art, 
concerts, museums than Canada or the US. And of course London is only a 3 hour 
train ride away from me and it has enough culture for the rest of your life and 
more. Plus the whole ofEurope is right there, a short plane (or Eurostar train) 
away.<br>
<br>
But right now is not a good time - this horrendous 
Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition is basically doing a worse version of 
Margaret Thatcher's cuts, slashing funding on everything from libraries, 
healthcare and children's programs to youth unemployment schemes and the BBC. 
By the time they're done, much of the advantages here will be gone and they 
will have create huge social problems. In short, if you're affluent, try it, 
but unless you're a raving right-winger this is not a good time to live here.

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Mon Feb 07, 2011 9:16 pm </p>  OMG....IBIZA.....how I miss it (was there 
last September. By the way - VERY easy to spend all your money there. 60 euro 
to get into a club and 13 euro for a rum &amp; coke)...... <br>
<br>
I think it 
depends on how you've set yourself up. For me, I'm looking to work in the UK 
for many reasons:<br>
<br>
1) I work for a multi-national company. I could 
request a transfer<br>
<br>
2) I want to gain more work experience and on an 
international level which I think will help further advance my career (I'm in 
advertising. I want to learn how other countries determine their ratings, how 
they buy, etc. I want to learn the media landscape)<br>
<br>
3) I'm young and 
I've started to love travel! Last year I went to Cuba, Ibiza (LOVE!!!!) and 
Berlin. I want to continue travelling and it's very much affordable from the UK
<br> <br>
4) I've determined my approximate salary range and even on the 
&quot;lower&quot; end of the spectrum, I'd still be saving more than what I was 
saving when I first began my job here in Canada (I determined my approximate 
expenses in &pound; and compared to what I was paying here however with the 
final $ converted into &pound;)<br>
<br>
By the sounds of it, you've got your 
life all set-up. Picking up and moving might not be worth it. From what I've 
read, a lot of the quality of life enjoyed in North America pretty well goes 
out the window....so unless you are willing to give up a lot, I don't think 
there would be much point in going. For me, it's an entirely different story 
(helps when you are in your early 20's). Top <br>

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Tue Feb 08, 2011 9:45 am </p>  Hi, <br>
I don't like swaying people from 
making their own decisions. But I initially came out to the UK for what was 
supposed to be 6 months and that was almost 7 years ago. I came to teach and to 
enjoy something different for a while but I ended up meeting my husband and 
haven't left yet.<br>
<br>
I'll start with what is good in my experience. There 
is just something a little different in the way you feel when you have lived 
somewhere else. Not just &quot;oh, look at me I've gone somewhere for a year 
and now I'm worldly&quot;. I find myself returning to Canada sometimes thinking 
that &quot;the people here are so unrefined&quot; in a snobby English sort of 
way like I was born into some higher class. Which is funny cause I'm not but 
that's how emersed I am I suppose. That's just how used to an English accent I 
am. I don't think I will ever regret the decision and in all honesty, when you 
make pounds the money is all relative. Gas is expensive but wine is cheap! I've 
gone back home and thought some things were really expensive there now.<br>
<br>
Anyway, 7 years later and I've also become a winging pom as they say. English 
people come by that expression honestly but it's true. They complain a lot!<br>

<br>Now my husband and I are dying to get out...I mean dying. When I landed 
here after 3 weeks home for Christmas I felt bile in my stomache coming from my 
prestine country back to the UK.<br>
<br>
In all honesty though, the first 
couple years here were great and I don't think I ever would have come to the 
conclusions I have about Canada and the UK unless I did live here for so long. 
There's a lot of fun to be had here withEurope at your doorstep (honestly you 
could be in Rome in 4 hours)!<br>
<br>
If you do want to try it, try it. Just 
try not to stay too long if it's not the long term you're after. What's the 
worst that can happen? You don't like it and go back? Like everyone says here, 
you need to make your own decisions, of course you do, no one can drag you over.

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Thu Feb 10, 2011 12:14 pm </p>  hi! <br>
<br>
I just moved back to London 
(from Montreal). Was here for a few months in 2009 now I'm here for a few years 
(got in about a month ago). I think before you move somewhere for awhile. It's 
always good to visit the city and get a vibe from it (not everywhere is good 
for everyone). Although yes it's very expensive here and yes there's a ton of 
people in a very small space (Canada compared to UK...let's be honest) it still 
all seems worth it because of how amazing this city is. It's ALWAYS buzzing. 
Places to go, people to met, things to do. It's a city that you would never be 
bored of or could hate. And there is something here for everyone. However I 
understand you don't have that luxury of just popping over, but I just wanted 
to throw it out there because it is a huge thing.<br>
<br>
Something that is 
REALLY hard here, in my experience anyway that's what I have to take from, is 
getting information. The English have a way of &quot;beating round the 
bush&quot; that I am not used to. BUT once that information is finally obtained 
it is alot easier to move threw the system. Administration wise...be prepared 
to do alot of your own work they are not very interested (in my experience once 
again) to let MORE people into the country. You may have an easier time because 
of your wife, use that for sure and make sure you register with her (have her 
physically there). You're most likely to get it done quicker and they will see 
you more &quot;as one of your own&quot;. I'm not sure if that's at all helpful 
but I think it's something that you want to consider...it's not easy to get 
into this country.<br>
<br>
London itself (once you're in) like I said it's 
just out of this world. The vibe and energy is worth all the paperwork and 
admin crap. Anyone can find their place here. The only thing I personally have 
trouble with is the general British attitude and ways of thinking and just 
being. I really recommend that you read &quot;Watching the English&quot; by 
Kate Fox before you decide. It's silly to say but it's something that can make 
you feel VERY foreign if you aren't used to it or simply not aware. That's why 
I think some people &quot;don't like it here&quot; because Canadians especially 
are just not used to &quot;the English way&quot;.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps a 
tiny bit! Good luck!<br>

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Sat Feb 12, 2011 9:54 am </p>  like cestmoi said it really depends on your 
situation and how you feel. If your wife has no interest in living in the UK 
that could prove problematic but who knows? I wouldn't automatically reccomend 
or not reccomend anywhere.<br>
The UK certainly has 1 advantage over the 
continent in that, its close toEurope but they speak English. Traveling to 
Europe is certainly easier as well.<br>

<h3>Re: Is the UK worth moving to or not? very confused!!!</h3> 
<p> Sun Mar 06, 2011 4:56 am </p>  I reckon that unless you're just starting 
out in your career a move to another country nearly always means at least a 
temporary drop in salary / prospects. Unless of course you get an internal 
transfer or something like that.<br>
<br>
If it's any comfort that doesn't just 
apply to Canadians coming to the UK. I've known many British people who've gone 
to Canada and been disappointed at the apparent lack of work, prospects and 
decent pay on offer.<br>
<br>
The problem is, you leave your network behind 
when you move countries, so when you're looking for work you're effectively 
always making that &quot;cold call&quot;, and if you're education and 
background are in another country employers feel they're taking more of a risk.
<br> <br>
So if you want to move to the UK, do it first and foremost for the 
experience itself. Top <br>
