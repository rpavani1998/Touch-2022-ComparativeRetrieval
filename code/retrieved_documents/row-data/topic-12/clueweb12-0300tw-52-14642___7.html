<h1>David Mitchell's Soapbox: climate change doubters - video</h1> 
<p>Last week David Mitchell solved the environment - and he's a bit miffed 
that didn't make more of a stir. So this week he thought he'd tackle climate 
change doubters. These disbelievers must concede that climate change is a 
'possibility'. In which case, why take the risk &ndash; and continue ruining 
the planet, in the meantime?</p>

<p>A very good point: Pascal's wager, in effect. Why take the chance?</p> 
<p>However, such an emminently sensible position won't stop the usual 
pointless exchange along the lines of &quot;we're right&quot; &quot;no, we're 
right&quot;.</p>

<p>David - I guess that means you're never getting on a plane again, or a 
train, or a car - because hey - why take the risk?</p> 
<p>It's probable that man's activity is driving warming to the planet. It's 
possible that the outcome of this will one day prove to be catastrophic, it's 
also possible that it won't. What's certain is that it is not yet a clear and 
present danger - until then; you'd be as well flinging shyte at the moon.</p>

<p>Really eliminating carbon emissions the way the Greens want would bankrupt 
this country - causing a collapse in living standards that would make the 
current cuts look like tea for two at Claridge's!</p>

<p>Most sceptics believe the climate is constantly changing.</p> 
<p>Most sceptics believe that there is probably a 'man-made' element to it.</p>
<p>What most sceptics do not believe in is 'Catastrophic Man-Made Global 
Warming'.</p> 
<p>Hope that clears it up for you Mr Mitchell.</p> 
<p>Secondly, we have our doubts about the solutions, some of which are going 
to kill a lot more people than any CAGW ever will.</p> 
<p>Mr Mitchell, please watch the number of Cold Weather Deaths rise as the 
taxes on fuel rise over the next few years and then see if you feel so smug.</p>

<p>Dont get me wrong I appreciate that climate change is happening, and I also 
understand we are most likely causing it, will the planet really be 
un-inhabitable though, or is there a chance we can adapt?</p> </li>

<p>Also I am a bit of a fatalist in that I believe that Man has managed to 
cause his own demise, I don't think it is in our DNA to act on a problem which 
may kill us in a few generations, as someone said above, there will be no clear 
and present danger until its too late. I think what we need is the metaphorical 
Saber Tooth lion breathing down our necks before we will actually get off our 
arse, I genuinely believe most people will otherwise go about their daily lives.

<p>Most of the 'independent' scientific bodies depend on funding from 
Governments or industry bodies which are dependent on being right - never mind 
that it'd be quite embarrassing to finally be proved wrong!</p> 
<p>Take, for example, CERN whose CLOUD project recently published data that 
suggests that in fact the climate change we are experiencing is a lot more 
dependent on solar activity and not human activity!</p> 
<p>Seems an odd coincidence that the data is being played down to avoid 
&quot;the highly political arena of the climate change debate.&quot; especially 
since the last time the project had data suggesting this it was shut down from 
Governmental pressure after intense pressure from the Green lobby...</p> 
<p>But i suppose you're right - better safe than sorry! also, would be good to 
end dependence on Russian gas and Libyan oil!</p> </li>

<p>Unfortunately, the people you have to convince are American Republican 
politicians who see anything that gets in the way of big business as a pinko 
plot to turn the US into a socialist flower-garden; millions of redneck 
numbskulls and fundamentalist Christians who think there's a big guy in the sky 
operating the controls; and huge multinational corporations who believe it's 
true but pretend it isn't because their share prices will crash.</p>

<p>Climate Change happens: warming, cooling, and warming and cooling again. 
</p> 
<p>I do everything I can to limit the amount of <b>pollution</b> I personally 
contribute to this messy world, but I will not be made to feel guilty for 
emitting carbon dioxide from my mouth and nostrils nor methane my arse! And, I 
refuse to feel bad about the tiny amounts of power that I use when compared to 
the vast quantities of energy wasted by super-powerful trans-national 
corporations (disgusting polluters that all get tax breaks or hide their money 
in off-shore accounts) or be told by the media moguls that hang out on 
gin-palaces in the Med (&pound;1500 in deisel fuel to travel 5 miles) that 
Carbon Taxes are a good idea!</p> 
<p>So, sorry David, playing the ventriloquist's dummy for the man-made global 
warming lobby is a waste of your brains and talent!</p> </li>

<p>I don't particularly care about climate change. </p> 
<p>I do however think it's dimwitted to consume finite resources as though 
they are infinite - and not even care about the consequences.</p> 
<p>Or as fnusnuank demonstrates, continuously move the goalposts. </p> 
<p>I've heard sceptics claim; </p> 
<p>There is no climate change, there is but it's not man made and now, there 
is but it's not going to be that bad. The last is particularly odd as sceptics 
traditionally point out how unpredictable climate patterns are.</p> </li>

<p><i>Most of the 'independent' scientific bodies depend on funding from

<p>This has been going on for a long time. Follow the current popular view or 
struggle to get funding.</p> 
<p><i>Take, for example, CERN whose CLOUD project recently published data that 
suggests that in fact the climate change we are experiencing is a lot more 
dependent on solar activity and not human activity!</i></p> 
<p>If you look at it logically the main source of heat light etc is the sun. 
Turn off the sun we all freeze. Make the sun alot more active we fry. We can 
see from past history there are dramatic climate changes when we were few in 
number and chasing mamoths about the place. You could fairly argue we are 
poisining the planet and causing alot of damage.</p> </li>

<p>No country wants to be the one to sacrifice the most to help the 
environment to the advantage of their rivals.</p> 
<p>It would help diffuse American reluctance for instance if China came 
on-board.</p> 
<p>The political climate change skeptics (eg. Republican Party) are 
nationalists not genuine skeptics.</p> </li>

<p>Not quite the same risk though, is it? On the one hand you get on a plane 
knowing there's an infinitesimal chance it will go down; you know the 
statistics and you're prepared to take that gamble with your own life.</p> 
<p>On the other hand the scientific consensus is that man is changing the 
climate in a way which will prove catastrophic for several billion people if it 
isn't checked. Now you're not gambling with your own life, because you'll be 
safely dead before the shit hits the fan, you're gambling with billions of 
lives of people not even born yet who might ask what kind of selfish twat would 
choose to ignore all the warning signs because it meant making small changes to 
his or her lifestyle.</p>

<p>I agree David, but I think you lack ambition. There's like a one in a 
squillion chance that an asteroid will smash into the planet destroying all 
life. So why take the risk? So I propose we build a giant net in space to catch 
any approaching rocks.</p> 
<p>Think of all the jobs building this would create! All the new technologies 
we'd develop. It's literally a win win deal. After all spending loads of money 
we don't have solving non existent problems is how humans have gone from living 
in caves to producing not very funny videos for the Guardian.</p> </li>

@darthij: I take it that you didn't even bother to read the synopsis

<i> 'There is no climate change, there is but it's not man 
made and now, there is but it's not going to be that bad. The last is 
particularly odd as sceptics traditionally point out how unpredictable climate 
patterns are.'</i></p> 
<p>They do that, but with 'climate', 'sceptics' usually are confusing 
'weather'. Perhaps this is intentional? Then they jump to 'Sun big, People 
small' tactic. Nobody is arguing that people are bigger than the sun seems a 
too obvious response. The data doesn't support that the sun is the only driver 
of climate though.</p> 
<p>I've heard so much about this solar activity issue. As you say, at first 
the denier will say 'it's not happenening,' before then changing to the 'it is 
happening but not by us' without ever conceding that their first assertion is 
invalidated by their second. Then as evidence they claim solar activity is 
really the cause.</p> 
<p>First they will blame the 11 year solar cycle thinking that technical 
sounding words will outflank the scientist (!) - which contradicts another 
well-trodden and inaccurate assertion that the earth has been cooling since 
1998. if 1998 were the year of maximum global temperatures it was closer to the 
solar minimum than maximum - and then with the longer term '60, no 70, no 80' 
year solar cycle where activity peaked in the sixties. as solar activity has 
barely changed except for a gradual and slow decline over the next fifty years. 
when the denier sees the graphs for this they then will try to obfuscate before 
shifting the goal posts again.</p> 
<p>In the end all that happens in reality is you both end up like a dog 
chasing it's tail. Better to let them spin off on their own. If you're lucky 
they'll try to quote Monkton!</p>

<p>The flaw in Pascal's wager is that the nature of the worship God requires 
is not clear. Pascal would have said Jansenist ultra-Catholicism. David 
Mitchell says Puritan denial of energy usage. Pastafarians say cruel mockery of 
all faith-based positions.</p> 
<p>However, these Precautionary Principles just reinforce the desires of the 
person who promotes them. By definition, acting before we have evidence is not 
evidence based.</p> 
<p>David Mitchell says catastrophic AGW is a higher priority than directly 
reducing poverty through efficiency.</p> 
<p>That's his choice but listening to him won't cause his death... just the 
death of the poor.</p> 
<p>Unless he's right, of course. But as he may not be why not wait and see? 
There are plenty of less risky things to do to save the world.</p> </li>

<p>I don't care whether its getting hotter or colder or who or what caused it 
to happen. All I know is that if life in the future is going to change for the 
worse, we should do our best to try and solve it now, before it happens.</p> 
<p>The only scenario in which we can get away with doing absolutely nothing, 
is if we can all agree that nothing negative resource or climate related will 
ever happen in the future. We'll never all agree on that, so we should all just 
get over ourselves and deal with it.</p> 
<p>Increasing population and dependency on dwindling fossil fuels are both 
happening whether climate change is or not. We'll have to tackle the first two 
whether or not climate change is happening but as luck would have it solving 
the first two might also contribute significantly to mitigating climate change 
too.</p> 
<p>Lets forget the whole climate change thing and address the other two - 
they're harder to deny.</p> </li>

<p>This is an interesting argument. It is interesting as for once the 
scientists are actually asking to have faith in a viewpoint that does not 
strictly satisfy the scientific method or positivist approaches to knowledge.
</p> 
<p>Personally I believe man has had an effect on climate change. To what 
extent and consequence is where we start moving into areas whereby scientists 
themselves use to discredit arguments of non-scientific based beliefs or 
assertions of truth.</p>

<p>You know what, I have no idea if man made climate change is real or not. 
I&rsquo;m not an expert and don&rsquo;t have the time or inclination to become 
one.</p> 
<p>However I have no doubt that those experts who do believe it is happening 
are sincere (talk of tax raising conspiracies are pure tin foil hat drivel) and 
that even if the science is proven to be inaccurate there are numerous other 
benefits to be had from cleaning up our act.</p> 
<p>If nothing else environmentalism will make our natural resources last 
longer, our air more pleasant to breathe and our scenery nicer to look at. 
Which are great results in themselves.</p> </li>

<p>Lots of people make the obvious but nonetheless sensible comment that 
throwing trillions of dollars at a risk that may or may not materialise may not 
be sensible.</p> 
<p>What makes spending those trillions of dollars definitely not sensible is 
that, even on the analysis of people advocating the most draconian measures, 
they won't work. For example, even if the Kyoto Protocol had been fully 
implemented, it was expected only to reduce global temperatures from what they 
otherwise would have been by a tiny fraction of one degree.</p> 
<p>So, David, I have the answer for you: we take the risk because the risk you 
are concerned about may not materialise, the cost of addressing it isn't worth 
it, and the measures available to us won't work anyway.</p>

<p>Government climate change targets will put &pound;500 on the average 
family's fuel bill within four years, a study by Dr Richard Wellings warns. By 
2015 some 500 pounds will be added to the household fuel bills. We have 
government&rsquo;s targets driven by ideology not rational thinking.</p> 
<p>And how many people will the coalition kill because of these stupid 
policies? On average 25,000 old people die eacg year because they cannot afford 
to eat and keep warm. In the recent cold winter this figure peaked at 35,000. 
With the recent energy price rises and the extra 500 pounds perhaps the 
coalition will be happy when 50,000 plus old people are dying each year. 
Perhaps they want it this way as it&rsquo;s one way of keeping the pension 
expenditure down.</p> </li>

there was nearly a 100 % chance you were to be struck by lightning also all the 
worlds scientists were telling you you were going to get struck by lighting 
based on numerous supporting theories. If we could physically see lightning

<p>I'm pleased to see the term &quot;climate change doubters&quot; being used 
rather than &quot;climate change deniers&quot;. The latter was a small 
influence pushing me towards a more sceptical position - I thought, if the 
evidence was so obvious, why were they resorting to smears? The association of 
&quot;deniers&quot; was obviously intended to be withHolocaust deniers.</p> 
<p>I'm not saying anyone should decide their position on such slight grounds. 
But I am glad to see a more polite term used in the debate and I hope it

<p>Pushing 'green' and/or nuclear technologies won't bankrupt us. It will 
bankrupt fossil fuel companies and various dicatatorships in the middle east, 
but not the majority of the globe.</p> 
<p>Cars that are more fuel efficient? How is that uneconomical! Diversity of 
food and energy security, why is that a ridiculous suggestion!</p> 
<p>The economic risks of NOT acting are far higher for the world as a whole 
than the economic risks of taking action the might not have been necessary.</p>
