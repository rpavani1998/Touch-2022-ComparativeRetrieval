<title>The Planes Of Existence, A Closer Look</title>
<body>

<h1>FANTASY COSMOLOGY, AND<br>
THE STRUCTURE OF THE MULTIVERSE</h1> 
<p>I have just recently finished reading the official AD&amp;D Manual of the 
Planes by Jeff Grubb. I was on the whole not displeased with it, but there are 
some things that I feel compelled to write about.</p>
<p>In a fantasy game like AD&amp;D it is always tempting for certain 
individuals to come along and proclaim ultimate rules which all others must 
follow, lest they be outside the realm of that particular game. I believe, at 
one time, E. Gary Gygax himself took such a stand, foolishly reserving the 
right of &quot;last word&quot; creativity in any AD&amp;D system for himself. 
In the<b><i>Manual of the Planes</i></b>, Grubb also had a note of &quot;last 
word&quot; finality to much of his writing. Each and every time I come across 
such arrogant behavior I simply cringe. I do realize some sense of uniformity 
is both desired and required in anything approaching a game which is to be 
played internationally, but still any hint of finality in the rules of your 
universe should ultimately come from you and not outside sources. If you agree 
or you can live with other people's rules, that's great; if not, then you 
shouldn't feel obligated to do so. As such, I have always praised any language 
or any rules in the official system which explicitly or implicitly state your 
universe should ultimately be run under your rules, and anything the books say 
should be construed simply as guide lines.</p>
<p>To that end, my take on the subject is thus: Each DM has his or her unique 
universe. In it we can typically find their version of a prime material plane, 
the astral and ethereal planes, and the inner and outer planes. A whole range 
of alternate or parallel planes of existence may also be found in any DM's 
universe. In fact, anything the DM cares to put in their universe is within 
their control alone and makes up what will ultimately be known as their 
AD&amp;D universe. Ultimately, it is the DM that decides how the laws of their 
universe shall be played.</p>
<p>Other DMs or GMs control and make the rules for their own universes. Since 
it is a fact our PCs tend to migrate from universe to universe, or from one 
DM's world to another DM's world, it is always nice to have gross similarities 
between universes. But having differences can be nice as well. In fact, it is 
exploring these differences which can enliven one's adventuring and gaming 
experiences. Finally, it is the collection of all universes, real or imagined, 
AD&amp;D or otherwise, that make up what is commonly referred to as<b>THE 
MULTIVERSE.</b> </p>
<p>My AD&amp;D universe is no different in these regards. The rules and laws 
of my universe are mine, and are therefore frequently different from the 
official written words from on high. And because of my sense of reality and 
goals of consistency, hopefully my universe makes a kind of sense which is 
superior to the official world of AD&amp;D. Let's face it, if it didn't make 
more sense, at least to me, I would have freely and quickly adopted the 
official written word and used it in my own universe. As it turns out, I have 
probably done just that; in fact, more often than going my own way. This has 
the advantage of drawing on the creativity and hard work of others, and gives a 
broader scope to my AD&amp;D universe. But there are still clear and distinct 
differences.</p>
<p>If I don't like a rule, especially ones that are derived from specific 
quirks of Earth's history, or ones that seem to me to be completely arbitrary, 
I change them. For example, the notion that a cleric, like some of their 
historical Christian counter parts on Earth, didn't like to draw blood and 
therefore were restricted to the use of specific non-edged weapons. In reality, 
this rule probably was set in place as a game balancing force for lower level 
campaigns. Why play fighters if a cleric is so much better? On my world, in my 
universe, this isn't a necessary balancing force; there are very good reasons 
to play either character class, and without Orlantian historical reasons not to 
draw blood, it makes no sense to avoid doing so and much more sense that a 
cleric should use the weapon most often depicted or associated with their 
particular deity. As such, a cleric of Thor will use a hammer, but a cleric of 
Poseidon would almost certainly use a trident, while a cleric of Athena might 
use a spear or a sword. If no particular weapon readily comes to mind for a 
given deity, the cleric should feel free to use any weapon of their choice, 
including a sword or other edged weapon. (Here<b>CLERIC</b> simply refers to 
the Priest Character Class as a generic term and no more should be read into 
that. I realize some new 2nd ed. definition may have arisen, but I frequently 
tend to still think of things in the old 1st ed. way).</p>
<p>Now some may say why use Earth based mythology at all if you're so dead set 
against some of it? The reason is simple. It is vast and useful, as well as 
educational and interesting. Not to mention relatively easy. But that is no 
reason to be saddled with a very generalized rule based on a religion which 
itself didn't make the transition. Such a rule would, or at least might make 
sense if that particular sect of Christianity was transplanted to your 
universe, or if your universe was already an approximation of historical Earth. 
In the meantime, the possibility the gods I use on my world and the gods of 
classical mythology, as well as other mythologies, may have had an influence on 
historical earth and therefore be one and the same gods is still open.</p>
<h2>THE PLANES OF EXISTENCE</h2> 
<p>Specifically, I wish to explore the rules concerning other planes of 
existence at this time. The first thing that made me cringe while reading the<b>
<i>Manual of the Planes</i></b> was the official written word that all 
&quot;time&quot; is a constant in all known planes of existence and can not be 
expanded, contracted, created, or destroyed. This isn't even true in the known 
real universe, the prime material plane, let alone other various planes of 
existence. While confined to the PMP, as one travels faster and faster, time 
acts differently. The relativistic effects of time actually become noticeable 
when achieving speeds of about 1/10th the speed of light or greater. Time also 
acts differently under extremely strong gravitational fields such as near a 
neutron star or close to the event horizon of a black hole. Time is NOT 
constant everywhere, but even on the PMP alone time is positively warped. And I 
don't even want to start in on the fact that certain standard spells already 
mess around with gravity as well as time, thus the initial premise of the<b><i>
Manual of the Planes</i></b> is faulty on its face. </p>
<p>From our everyday experiences and lives we are, unfortunately, locked in a 
mindset that convinces each of us everything must have a past, a present, and a 
future. It is this very linear temporal mind set which causes us to ask 
nonsense questions such as &quot;Where did the universe come from?&quot; In 
reality, time and space began at the first event, or the big bang. Since 
&quot;time&quot; and &quot;space,&quot; or &quot;space-time,&quot; began at 
that point, there was no &quot;before&quot; and no &quot;elsewhere.&quot; The 
question of where did the universe come from implies at one &quot;time&quot; 
the universe was &quot;elsewhere,&quot; or that at one time where the universe 
is now was empty space. Since there was no time &quot;before&quot; the big 
bang, and also no elsewhere for the universe to come from, we can see we are 
hopelessly trying to fit a real, but unique non-everyday situation into the 
mind set of our everyday frame of reality; but not everything has a past, a 
present, or a future. I mention all this for simple proof time isn't constant. 
So with that in mind, how can a system of planes of existence based on such a 
faulty premise be usable to me? Quite simply, it can't. Therefore, time may 
easily run differently when you are on different planes of existence.</p>
<h2>THE ASTRAL PLANE</h2> 
<p>The astral plane is the most striking example of the time differential 
phenomenon. That plane, like the ethereal plane, is tied to the prime material 
plane in a very real, but mysterious way. As it turns out, a naturally 
occurring resonance arises between large orbiting bodies of sufficient mass and 
that portion of the astral plane associated with the orbit of these bodies and 
the associated singularity or central star. After thousands or even millions of 
years, a natural harmonious frequency is established between time on the PMP of 
such an orbiting body and its associated astral plane. Generally, this works 
out to be exactly 1,000 times the number of standard rotational periods within 
one standard orbital period of the orbiting body. (1,000 times the number of 
days in a year). Specifically, on Orlantia where there are 400 days in a year, 
the ratio is 400,000 to 1. On Earth, with 365.25 days in a year, it is 365,250 
to 1. As such, one day on Orlantia would seem to be 400,000 days or 1,000 
Orlantian years on the astral plane. Also, one day on the astral plane near 
earth would seem to be 365,250 days or 1,000 earth years on the astral plane. 
Now it is a fact that certain advantages and disadvantage arise from this 
remarkable phenomenon.</p>
<p>Time spent on the astral plane seems almost instantaneous from the point of 
view of a PMP observer. Thus, you could plane shift to the astral plane, 
adventure for 1,000 years, and return to the PMP where only a single day would 
have passed. During such time you would have aged only a single day, PMP 
poisons would have the effect of having been in your system but a single day, 
you would seem to be fatigued by but a single day, and a host of other similar 
effects. So why not do this all the time? Simple. As creatures of the PMP, you 
are tied to it in a very real way. For example, you have to rest, study, or 
pray 400,000 times longer to get your spells back, to naturally heal, to 
accumulate life force or experience, or in many other ways, to get anything 
worthwhile done on that plane. In the meantime, you would be subjected to 1,000 
astral years of encounter rolls or run the risk of death over what would seem 
to be a great period of time. Naturally, the encounters in such a place would 
be few and far between, and mostly of creatures native to the astral plane, so 
even over a 1,000 years there might be only several such instances, if even 
that many.</p>
<p>Let's face it, the astral plane's primary useful purpose is to travel great 
distances in a short amount of PMP time. One useful property of the astral 
plane is that the speed of light is not a limiting factor, and distances 
between points are not as specific as one might think. As such, interplanetary 
or even intergalactic distances can be achieved in the blink of a PMP eye. 
Teleportation, dimension door, and other similar spells utilize these 
properties to their advantage. By temporarily becoming astral, moving the 
desired distance and direction while the mind is shut down or in a state of 
protected suspension, and popping back to the PMP in the desired location, 
these spells move small objects from point A to point B quicker than any other 
known method of travel. Naturally, reaching the outer planes via the astral 
plane is also of importance, but I will speak more of that later.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the PMP, any extraordinary or recent experience gained 
there is adjusted by the DM to account for the natural factors involved in such 
a dimension. That is, the xp. normally stated for astral goodies are awarded at 
that time. Keep in mind, though, that only a few encounters, if any at all, 
would be likely to occur during even an apparent 1,000 year stint in the astral 
plane and most people do not spend that kind of time out there in the first 
place. This would make adventuring or living in the astral plane proper, a 
rather boring experience. Under such considerations, it is IMPOSSIBLE to take 
advantage of thousands of years of adventuring, gaining treasure, magic, and 
experience, and finally returning to the PMP dozens if not hundreds of levels 
higher than you were just a few PMP days before.</p>
<p>I imagine it would be like sitting around and waiting several thousand 
years between encounters. From the point of view of the astral individual, this 
is time that must really be waited out. You would really have to keep your mind 
occupied to prevent yourself from going insane while waiting centuries between 
encounters. You can't even spend that time learning new languages, learning 
stories or songs, or doing anything you would normally consider advantageous. 
Why? The natural chemical bonds set up in the brain that create our long term 
memories are also slowed down by that 400,000 to 1 factor, just like all other 
metabolic functions. So it would take me 400,000 times longer to learn a 
language, a song, a story, or other similar experience and no real advantage is 
gained. But if that is so, why can I think at normal speeds? The reason for 
this is simply because you are living within the spirit or soul. What is 
happening is really a reflection of the spirit more than a reflection of the 
body.</p>
<p>Now because of the slow chemical learning, if it would take a year to learn 
Elvish on the PMP, it would take 400,000 years of continuous and repeated study 
on the astral plane to burn that language into my memory. Only extraordinary, 
probably life threatening events and circumstances, frequently involving other 
intelligent beings on the astral plane, will ultimately end up staying with 
you; and even then, only in some small way. It is these rare, but few and far 
between events that give you the little experience your DM awards you upon your 
leaving the astral plane.</p>
<p>Also, short-term memories are retained as opposed to long term memories. 
Short-term memories are partially retained in a more spiritual manner within 
the spirit or soul. (<i>You may think this is pure bull, and you'd be right. So 
what</i>)? Long term memories are more chemical in nature, or at least have a 
definite chemical component. You are only likely to remember what ever happened 
to you during the last few hours, or perhaps the last few days of apparent 
astral time. As such, years of astral study WOULD NOT be burnt into the memory 
pathways of your brain, but only the last few hours might be actively retained 
(unless you study the same thing repeatedly, again and again and again and.). 
Upon the return to the PMP or other normal time flow plane, those few years of 
study would be lost. You may remember learning Alderami, but like someone who 
hasn't used a skill or language for years or decades, you've completely 
forgotten any useful working knowledge of those few astral years of study. At 
best they kept you from going insane by keeping your mind active, but now you 
draw a complete blank. It would only be with the continuous and repeated study 
of the same things again and again over a period of 400,000 astral days that 
you may eventually hope to remember any language or other complex time 
consuming study or training you learned while on the astral plane.</p>
<p>Short-term memory is also a partial explanation for why much of the xp. 
carries over and stays with you. It is likely you will leave the astral plane 
while such things are in short term memory (the spirit or soul). Much of the 
experience stays with you until your return to the PMP. Once there, the 
short-term spiritual memories have time to become long-term chemical memories, 
and you may remember or forget them, depending on how good your character's 
long-term memory really is.</p>
<p>Of course, there are ways to take advantage of this time differential 
situation as well. Only economics and a few other peculiar properties of the 
astral plane limit one in such endeavors. For example, taking a book along with 
you to copy on the astral plane, as well as ink and parchment, would allow one 
to take advantage of several hundred hours of work on the astral plane while 
only a few seconds or minutes of PMP time may have elapsed. Naturally, you'd 
have to find a way to write with ink in an environment with no gravity, but 
this could be done with a little thought. Still, this is mindless, repetitive 
work as opposed to creative work, and even then it takes extreme concentration 
not to lose your train of thought in the plane of thought. There is, in fact, a 
good chance that such a copied work would contain flaws that went unnoticed 
until your return to the PMP. (I imagine the success or failure would be a 
direct function of one's intelligence and/or wisdom).</p>
<p>Now don't get the wrong idea here. It's always easy for a player to 
proclaim their PCs are perfectly willing to endure considerable hardships, 
great amounts of pain and anguish, untold suffering, or even wait seemingly 
endless amounts of boring time to achieve even the littlest of goals. For 
example, a PC tells me he is willing to scratch through a strong wooden door 
with his spoon even after I inform him it will take several days to do such a 
thing. He decides time is not a factor, the danger is little or nonexistent, 
and with a snap of our fingers the time has passed. This doesn't take into 
account the hours of back breaking work, the blisters and splinters, and the 
aching knees and joints which would result from such an endeavor and naturally 
make one reluctant to do it at all; to say nothing of ruining a perfectly good 
spoon. It is an example of bad roleplaying. His character should stoop to such 
an action only as an act of desperation or great need. So, be careful not to 
let your players ignore their physical or mental hardships at the snap of one's 
fingers. Copying a book is not something a PC is likely to get into the habit 
of doing because it is both boring and uninspired, lengthy, tedious work. 
They're adventurers for god's sake! Not scribes! (If a player still insists on 
trying to do something like this when you feel he should try other, more 
obvious methods besides brute force, perhaps suggesting a halt to the game 
until next session may make him think otherwise. That is, if he really wants to 
spend a couple days clawing through a thick wooden door, tell him you will 
resume playing next session, unless he can find a speedier method of entry. 
This method should, of course, only be used when you feel there is an obvious 
way other than brute force to achieve the desired results).</p>
<p>It was with just such an example in mind that I carefully considered the 
problems of the official written word on the astral plane. As they have it, 
time runs the same on each plane, but there is some sort of relative time 
factor involved where, coincidentally, an individual on the astral plane would 
only age 1 day after spending 1,000 years on the astral plane. So in both their 
system and my system, each individual ages a single day for 1,000 years on the 
astral plane. But in their system, 1,000 years also passes on the PMP. Thus, in 
order to take a one way trip into the future and avoid any PMP enemies or 
escape justice or whatever other things would change in 1,000 years, your group 
simply slips onto the astral plane, mindlessly states they will wait it out in 
their secure metal box far from any world or any dangers, snaps their fingers, 
and returns home. After all, food, water, sleep, and other things, which would 
normally necessitate moving around, are not required in such a situation. Now 
the DM is obligated to instantly create 1,000 years of history and social 
evolution. The entire complexion of the game has changed. Of course, 1,000 
years needn't be the mark. Even 10 years into the future could have interesting 
results. And how, pray tell, will the DM keep the players from such an abuse in 
the official written system?</p>
<p>Oh well, no system is perfect, and my system probably has some flaws which, 
even though not readily apparent to me or my players, may be apparent to 
someone else.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with extended periods of time on the astral plane in my 
universe, there is a lack of cohesion and focus; also a lack of determination 
of purpose. For example, an author might decide he could go to the astral 
plane, compose great original work after great original work, and return with 
centuries of work before the very next PMP day had started. Unfortunately the 
work, when examined, would have the scrambled or nonsensical arrangement of a 
dream. Things that seem to make perfect sense on the astral plane when examined 
in the cold hard light of the PMP would seem to be utter rubbish. This is why 
some people liken dreams to astral travel. It may therefore be the reason your 
dreams make sense at the time, but upon reflection in the morning, they are 
utter nonsense. Creativity is also a chemical process of the brain. No matter 
if you are in my system, or the official system, one is going to have to take 
such things into account.</p>
<p>To continue, upon the author's return to the PMP, the author couldn't even 
hope to fix his work for he would have no lasting memory of the work, the ideas 
which inspired it, or what he may have been thinking more than just a few 
astral months ago. All those things passed from spiritual short-term memory 
long ago and never had a chance to become chemical long-term memories. All that 
work would be lost. Too bad for him.</p>
<p>It is also a fact that, due to the nature of energy, magic, one's mind, and 
a few other considerations, a magic user couldn't write scroll after scroll on 
the astral plane proper, and expect to return home with months of completed, 
useful work in just a few PMP minutes. Similar considerations prevent things 
like spell research, magic item manufacture, training, or any other lengthy 
mental and/or physical endeavors from being accomplished on the astral plane by 
any creatures not native to that environment.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware it takes approximately 1,500 GP in cost to buy even one 
plane shift scroll, let alone the 3,000-gp cost for two (got to get back home, 
you know?). So one wonders, is attempting to take advantage in such an astral 
fashion really worth the risk, let alone the $300,000 per attempt?</p>
<h2>SOME ASTRAL ADVANTAGES MAY STILL BE TAKEN</h2> 
<p>The Alodarian Empire takes advantage of the astral to PMP ratio of 400,000 
to 1 in at least a couple of ways. First, the Truestone Artifact is physically 
kept there. The minds within the Artifact are not affected in the same manner 
as other living minds on the astral plane. This is a property and consequence 
of the artifact. Also, it is a fact the minds in the Truestone Artifact are not 
technically living (and certainly not chemically based). The 400,000 to 1 ratio 
does lend great speed to the information storage and retrieval properties of 
the empire.</p>
<p>Another way the empire takes advantage of the time differential is in a 
type of punishment employed in their justice system. Convicted criminals of 
certain crimes, which might normally be considered capital crimes, are held in 
a sensory depravation area on the astral plane with the aid of a self-charging 
magic item. This has the effect of solitary confinement for centuries or even 
millennium while waiting only minutes or days on the PMP. The repetitive nature 
of the confinement is sufficient for the prisoner to remember their experience 
and to therefore drive the prisoner insane.</p>
<p>Once released, the insane individual has a randomly determined alignment 
that is one of the results of being driven insane in that manner. A heal spell, 
also by a self charging magic item called a lavender pearl, and therefore 
inexpensive, cures the insanity, but not the new alignment. The character is 
then different in three important ways:</p>
<p>One, much of their old experiences and memories are long forgotten, leaving 
only rudimentary skills and basic skills such as language, certain social 
skills, and a relatively low level of any advanced education they may have had. 
For example, any adventurer would probably start out again as 1st level no 
matter how much experience they had to begin with. (As a quick aside, these 
people, and even retired adventurers, tend to forget anything they do not 
continuously practice; their experience may eventually drop to zero, but that 
is still 1st level. However, I allow them to refresh their memory at 10 times 
the normal rate; that is, they gain 10 times any experience earned until they 
reach the level they had formerly achieved at which time they earn experience 
at their normal rate. In addition to this, any training cost would be a mere 
1/10th of the normal training cost and take only 1 day per level to relearn 
their old skills).</p>
<p>Two, they have a randomly determined alignment. It may end up being the 
same one they had before, but that only happens one in nine times. The 
government isn't trying to change their alignment to something more acceptable, 
but the change is just a consequence of this type of punishment.</p>
<p>And three, they are left with such a horrible memory of the punishment 
that, no matter what their new alignment, they'll do almost anything, even 
frequently including suicide, to avoid that kind of punishment again. As such, 
they are released into Alodarian society, hopefully to sin no more.</p>
<p>One more note on the time differential between the PMP and the astral 
plane. Most astral creatures are not really native to the astral plane. They 
are instead native to the so-called demi-planes within the astral plane. Some 
of the creatures that are actually native to the astral plane proper generate a 
type of natural field around themselves which is similar to the same sort of 
field generated around the astral demi-planes. These fields, or pockets of 
astral space, have time running closer to the PMP time. In this way, one 
needn't consider possible disastrous results that would inevitably arise from 
different races on different planes taking full advantage of unforeseen factors 
resulting from the time differential between planes. Suffice it to say, all 
creatures which normally might be considered native to the astral plane could, 
in some way, travel astrally as a native ability or by magic commonly available 
to them. In this way the natives can travel within the astral plane and their 
demi-plane. They may also travel to other planes touched by the astral plane, 
eventually returning to their demi-plane via the astral plane.</p>
<p>These astral demi-planes are sometimes artificial, but usually they are 
naturally occurring, such as a large chunk of earth floating like an island in 
astral space. A wizard's astral castle, large enough to generate its own pocket 
of slower moving relative time, would be a prime example of an artificial 
astral demi-plane. (Actually, in this regard, the entire PMP may be considered 
a type of demi-plane floating in the astral plane. It too would have an effect 
on time, and thus what we consider normal time flow would be an aspect of the 
same phenomenon that causes time to run more slowly near any demi-plane). 
Relatively secure in the astral plane in such a place, since the time is so 
similar to the time on the PMP, a wizard could learn spells, do spell research, 
create magic items and scrolls, and other normal activities as their body is 
functioning in a normal time stream. After months of work in such a relatively 
secure place, the wizard could return to the PMP where, yes, the same number of 
months had also passed since time runs in both places at a similar rate.</p>
<p>Larger occurring natural demi-planes also have the slower moving time. 
Closer to the same time as the PMP, these places are typically the homes of 
such races as the Githyanki or the Githzerai and are generally located outside, 
but near a solar system. As such, these creatures would only be seen near 
Orlantia if they actively traveled astrally toward, or to it.</p>
<p>Now in the astral plane there are the so-called astral pools of color. 
These pools naturally occur and are gateways into other planes of existence. 
The color of the pool is a good indication of the plane it connects to, but not 
the location in that plane. Also, as the astral traveler approaches such a 
pool, like approaching a demi-plane, the time differential begins to drop. The 
closer they get the closer to PMP or other planar time they also get. 
Eventually, when close enough to the pool or demi-plane, time is running there 
at the same rate that it is running on that other connected plane. You will 
therefore begin to tire, hunger, heal, learn, and age as you would if you were 
on the other connected plane.</p>
<p>Now if you look out into and through the colored pool it is possible, 
provided there is sufficient light on the connected plane, to see certain 
aspects on that plane. If you so desire you can travel to such a plane in a one 
way manner without the aid of a<b><i>Plane Shift</i></b> spell. This is a one 
way ticket. You may not travel back to the astral plane without employing 
additional magic such as another<b><i>Plane Shift</i></b> spell. </p>
<p>Usually, adventurers may travel to the proper pool if they have done so 
before, are guided by an astral native, or have a map of some sort. By 
visualizing the desired destination, coupled with the previous knowledge, the 
native's help, or the map, the party can travel to it with 1, 2, or 3 encounter 
rolls, depending on how well they know the path already, how well the native 
knows the path, or the accuracy of the map.</p>
<p>I should also mention, since it is extremely important, that most 
encounters and other experiences on the astral plane are actually sufficiently 
near a demi-plane, an astral pool of color, or even a creature. All of these 
places happen to be running sufficiently close to the real PMP time; so they 
will not make much of a difference. These places, akin to the border ethereal, 
are tied to their near non-astral places in such a way that any adventuring 
done there could be treated, for memory, experience, healing, fatigue, poisons, 
and other purposes, as if it occurred on that associated non-astral plane. In 
this way, one needn't even begin to consider the entire mind bending time 
differential phenomenon as long as you stay close to such a place, and as long 
as you spend very little time in between such places while traveling from one 
to another.</p>
<p>It is a fact that in my universe certain astral coordinates, as well as the 
coordinates of other planes, are fixed to a reference system using the central 
star of a particular solar system. For example, the planet's position on a 
particular day may coincide with a particular color pool being in a particular 
position near a certain known point on the PMP. That is, on the 113th day of 
the year, if you plane shift to the astral plane from the old well in farmer 
Brown's north field, you will immediately come across the color pool to the 
elemental plane of water which leads to the &quot;undersea&quot; city of Ariel 
on the elemental plane of water. Of course, being close to the 113th day, or 
close to the old well, is probably good enough provided you go through the 
extra astral travel and any resulting extra encounter rolls. If you are even 
further away, the trip is still possible since you have a rough idea of where 
these things may be; but several extra encounter rolls would then be typical no 
matter how well you knew your way.</p>
<p>So you see, the astral plane proper on my world is rarely used for anything 
other than travel from point A to point B on the PMP, or travel to various 
astral demi-planes or keeps, or to the outer planes of existence. While astral, 
much of what was written in the<b><i>Manual of the Planes</i></b> may or may 
not apply as the situation demands. I like the general business of reducing 
magic pluses of weapons and armor by one for each plane removed from its 
intended plane. I imagine magic works differently on the astral plane than on 
the PMP and probably is similar to that which is stated in the<b><i>Manual of 
the Planes</i></b>. Duration and time considerations more closely follow my 
stated premise. Potion duration are similar to spell duration, since in my 
universe potions simply impart the ability to immediately cast a similar spell 
as a natural effect, and are not necessarily a slow metabolic time released 
capsule kind of deal which the official word seems to think they are.</p>
<p>Any change in the velocity of an object or person is mostly mentally 
achieved by an average of one's intelligence and wisdom rather than just their 
intelligence. Other travel is by magic or conservation of momentum, both linear 
and angular. This plane has no true up or down, and gravity does not function 
here at all, which is another reason why it is hard to write with quill and ink 
on the astral plane, but may act normally in a demi-plane. The entire astral 
plane glows of magic and appears to be well illuminated in a dull gray kind of 
way. Of all the planes of existence, the astral plane is the only one I 
consider to be truly infinite. All others, like the PMP, are just incredibly 
large.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> Gravity mostly depends on sheer mass and the distance between 
the center of mass for the bulk of it and the object in question (normally 
you). This is how gravity works on the PMP, which is, you may recall, just one 
large example of a demi-plane. However, that's not the whole story. There are 
ways to shape the smaller pockets of demi-planes that can affect the strength 
of gravity, up to a point. Suffice it to say that a savvy wizard could adjust a 
few things such that his astral castle could have virtually any amount of 
gravity he wanted if he didn't go to extremes. Thus, gravity from 0 to 3 Gs is 
possible, though almost all wizards use their home planet's value of G so they 
feel at home and do not have to make adjustments when they travel to and fro. 
Time still runs virtually the same within these limits since time is a function 
of something else. But the point is your typical demi-plane will typically have 
normal gravity.</p>
<h2>THE ASTRAL PLANE AND THE <br>
 ORDERLY TRANSFER OF PCs FROM ONE UNIVERSE 
TO ANOTHER</h2> 
<p>Finally, it is through the astral plane, a quirk in the astral plane, or 
typically by some unexpected phenomenon of the astral plane, that a PC manages 
to accidentally or intentionally end up in an entirely different universe by 
permission of his or her old AND new dungeon masters alike. The former usually 
just gives permission for the player to take his character with him when he 
stops playing, and the new DM certainly must grant permission for a player to 
play in his or her universe. The old DM usually must give their permission 
simply because I believe it is important not to allow a player to circumvent a 
world's dangers just on a whim. That is, if he got himself in a mess of trouble 
the PC doesn't automatically have the power to leave the universe to avoid it 
and save his character. This distinction is pretty philosophical. What is the 
difference between a powerful character you achieved after years of great play 
in great worlds run by great DMs and a nearly identical character some munchkin 
just creates over the weekend? One is &quot;real&quot; and one is 
&quot;false&quot; and the distinction may not matter to you, but it does matter 
to me. Thus, if your character were to get out of a tough spot in a DM's world 
simply by your whim of leaving the universe, what you'd really be playing from 
that point on is, in my opinion, a false character since the real one probably 
died. If it doesn't matter to you, then so be it. I at least like to play real 
characters. This is why I feel it is only with permission of your old DM that 
you may take a real character out of their universe; hopefully this DM 
understands his responsibility and will let you do this in practically all 
instances when your character is &quot;safe&quot; in &quot;town&quot; and you 
simply wish to play elsewhere; but even if he's a jerk and he improperly uses 
his power to &quot;punish&quot; you for leaving in this philosophical manner, 
you would still be playing a false character. After all, it is not up to you or 
your PC to dictate what the properties of the universe will be. Just avoid DMs 
who are jerks whenever possible.</p>
<h2>THE ETHEREAL PLANE</h2> 
<p>The ethereal plane is the other plane of existence which touches the PMP 
and which is also extensively used for travel. Due to the slower nature of the 
ethereal plane, as compared to the astral plane, the distances traveled are at 
best intraplanetary (point to point on the same planet) and hardly ever 
interplanetary (from one planet to another planet), let alone interstellar or 
intergalactic distances.</p>
<h2>THE NEAR, OR BORDER ETHEREAL PLANE</h2> 
<p>All places on the PMP touch the near, or border ethereal plane. Quite 
simply, this is where the ethereal plane is most closely tied to the PMP. As 
such, it is possible for ethereal creatures to even see, though vaguely, 
objects on the PMP; even then only when there is sufficient illumination on the 
PMP. Ethereal creatures can be seen here by people on the PMP if they employ 
magic such as detect invisibility, or under just the right conditions. 
(Whatever the DM requires for a story would be a prime example of the 
&quot;right&quot; conditions).</p>
<p>There is an unseen wind in the border ethereal whose velocity is randomly 
determined. (Actually, this ethereal wind is probably a function of the 
planet's revolution and its rotation, but nobody really knows this except the 
wizard Michelson and the sage Morley). This wind makes things on the PMP, when 
an ethereal creature can see them, appear to be in a different location from 
their real location. It is because of this wind that ethereal travelers are 
unable to achieve pinpoint accuracy when traveling back to the PMP, always 
being off by a random distance in a random direction up to several hundred feet 
&quot;indoors&quot; and several hundred yards &quot;outdoors.&quot; Only some 
natives of the ethereal plane, like phase spiders, can detect this wind and 
take such displacements into account. This is why it is nearly impossible to go 
ethereal, travel pass a locked door in a dungeon, and come back to the PMP 
without greatly risking becoming substantial within some solid, material form 
(like a wall or a table) on the PMP.</p>
<p>If the ethereal traveler accidentally attempts to enter the PMP at a point 
of solid matter, they may take damage, or perhaps make a save vs. death, or 
perhaps they will simply be stunned and displaced to the nearest available open 
space on the PMP, or even end up stunned and back in the deep ethereal plane. 
This is up to the DM and the whims of the DM at that time and is justified as 
another unforeseen random factor so it needn't even have similar results each 
time it happens. I know for oil of etherealness that this always bounces you 
into the PMP somewhere. In standard play, they seem to have them go into the 
deep ether, only to be able to return to the PMP later, somehow without the aid 
of a<b><i>Plane Shift</i></b> spell? Personally, I don't think so, so if they 
end up stunned in the deep ether, when they do recover they will be stranded on 
the ethereal plane until they either employ plane shifting magic or find a 
naturally occurring pool of some kind.</p>
<p>Travel while confined to the border ethereal plane is relatively safe. You 
may travel in any direction desired by simply thinking it. Here, the only sense 
of up or down, north or south, east of west, or whatever come from any vague 
sense you may have of the bordering PMP and those directions there. Your speed 
is 100 times your normal PMP movement rate. That is, if you have a 12&quot; 
rate, you could normally travel 24 miles on the PMP in 10 hours, or 240 miles 
in the border ethereal in 10 hours. As time runs the same here as on the PMP, 
you would require rest and food at that time. This travel is usually along a 
great circle route unless going through the planet's crust, which is a somewhat 
more dangerous proposition. This would only be done if it were so much shorter 
the party decides to risk it. (Travel through the planet's mostly metal inner 
layers is impossible). There is but a single encounter roll when going from 
point A to point B while confined to the border ethereal plane, and while 
staying above, or at least, nearly above ground. Here, in the border ethereal, 
the Ether Cyclone is not a normal possibility.</p>
<p>While in an ethereal state, one can pass freely though most things on the 
PMP without notice or harm. The exceptions are huge concentrations of metal 
ores, thick sheets of more refine metals, and the living material of most 
creatures found in the monstrous manual as they generate a sufficient aura of 
energy which ethereal matter cannot pass though. Also, some now dead material 
of once living creatures that had various ethereal properties may be employed 
as a method of blocking ethereal matter from transit. Your local alchemist, and 
therefore your DM, has the final word on any such materials. One example, 
however, might be gorgon blood mixed with mortar. Such a cell constructed with 
this material would probably keep an individual from plane shifting out of 
there or anybody from plane shifting into the cell as well.</p>
<h2>ETHEREAL COMBAT</h2> 
<p>Combat on the ethereal plane is tricky. All magic items are reduced by one 
plus. If they are non-magical, they do zero points of damage for weapons or 
provide no protection for armor. Any pluses left are still used to hit, damage, 
save, or protect as normal. If the weapons or armor are still magical, they 
work as normal at their reduced levels. Other protection devices such as 
bracers of defense, cloaks of protection, rings of protection, etc., either are 
reduced by 1 plus or are reduced by 1 or more AC advantage points by your DM. 
This usually takes the kind of item into account.</p>
<p>Additional damage is done by one's prime requisite, as if it were strength 
on the strength table. e.g., an 18 intelligence for a magic user would be +1 to 
hit, +2 to damage. This bonus is not to exceed the bonus for a score of 20 or 
higher for PCs. Thus, +3 to hit, +8 to damage is the maximum bonus. Exceptional 
scores for prime requisites of 18 in other categories other than strength 
should be rolled every time one travels to the ethereal plane. Such a roll 
would, however, only be revealed to the player after combat began. From this we 
can see a cleric of 18 wisdom, upon traveling ethereal, would roll for 
exceptional wisdom if combat occurred. If he rolled an 82, his bonus would be 
as if he had an 18/82 strength. He would keep and use this bonus until he left 
the ethereal plane. If he ever returned to fight again, a different roll would 
be made, but only after combat began.</p>
<p>Dexterity bonuses still improve your armor class. They also add to your 
plus to hit rolls for missile or thrown weapons, but only at short range. 
Medium ranges can only be achieved with magic arrows (remember the -2 penalty). 
Long-range is impossible. Magic bows impart one less plus to their missiles, so 
the arrows are only magic if they were shot from at least a +2 (therefore now a 
+1) bow, or the arrows were at least +2 (therefore now a +1) to begin with. (A 
normally +1 bow shooting a normally +1 arrow is now +0 since the -1 penalty 
applies to each item, and such an arrow will do no damage). If the arrows are 
still magic, they will do normal base damage plus their lower bonus damage. If 
not, they do no damage. In any event, missiles will eventually come to a stop 
and drift in the ethereal fog until found and taken.</p>
<p>Weapon specialization bonuses to hit and to damage are still used. Natural 
weapons such as hands, feet, claws, and teeth still do normal damage. Spells 
and most other consideration follow the guidelines given in the<b><i>Manual of 
the Planes</i></b> except where they violate my basic premises. Normal ethereal 
materials affect each other only slightly. Ethereal water will not drown you. 
Ethereal acid will hurt you, but not as badly as normal. Real water, somehow 
brought into the ethereal plane, will eventually turn to ethereal water. Until 
it does, however, it can drown you. Gas attacks are less effective as the PCs 
can survive without air for up to 10 times longer in the border ethereal and 
100 times longer in the deep ethereal. Note that this implies there is 
breathable air on the ethereal plane (or some such thing that functions tin a 
similar way).</p>
<p>Some weapons and armor may be ruled to have unusual qualities that allow 
them to forgo their normal penalties. Such items are usually intelligent, wise, 
very powerful, or from other planes of existence to begin with. Other 
exceptions would include items made specifically for the plane in question. 
e.g., a +3 ethereal long sword. This item would be +2 to hit and +2 to damage 
on the PMP, but on the ethereal plane it is +3, +3. A normal +4 PMP long sword 
would work as well on the ethereal plane since it would act as a +3 sword there.
</p>
<p>Combat in the border ethereal is identical to combat in the deep ethereal 
except for the time differential problems of short-term memory. If you want the 
full xp. you'd best get back to the border ethereal or the PMP relatively soon, 
least the experience fade from your short term memory.</p>
<h2>THE DEEP ETHEREAL PLANE</h2> 
<p>If greater distances are required, and time is of the essence, one can 
travel from the border ethereal through the ethereal curtain into the deep 
ethereal. Once there, like in astral travel, there is a time differential, but 
with a ratio of only 100 to 1. Most rules concerning attempts to take advantage 
of the time differentials that apply to the astral plane also apply here in the 
deep ethereal plane. Travel within the grayish fog of the deep ethereal is 
quicker than the border ethereal. The number of encounter rolls is determined 
in the same manner as those in the astral plane. [3 rolls for the unknown 
paths, 2 for slightly known, and 1 for well known]. Here, unlike the border 
ethereal, the ether cyclone is a normal possible encounter. Ultimately, this is 
a safer and quicker method of travel ONLY when a single encounter roll is to be 
made because you know the path well, your guide knows it well, or you have 
hyper-accurate maps and information.</p>
<p>The time required for this travel - from point A to point B via the deep 
ethereal - is typically 1/10000th of the time that it would take to really 
travel there via the PMP on a great circle route. This would be like traveling 
at 10,000 times your normal movement rate or about 240,000 miles in ten hours 
(Making the top deep ethereal travel speed about 24,000 mph). One could travel 
from Earth to Earth's moon in just 10 hours or so. It is possible to take one's 
time and be more careful. Such considerations will subtract one encounter roll, 
not to be less than one per trip in any event, but will slow your speed from 
10,000x to 1,000x your normal PMP movement rate. Even at this speed of 10x the 
border ethereal speed it is possible to get most places on Orlantia in just 
under one hour, provided you have no encounters or other problems along the way.
</p>
<p>Once inside the deep ethereal, you can seek out the proper curtain to one 
of the inner planes or to the PMP. This may be the plane you just left, but in 
a more suitable location or a different plane altogether. There, you can freely 
pass through the curtain into the associated border ethereal plane along that 
particular inner plane. You may then travel along the border ethereal until you 
find what you seek. Another<b><i>Plane Shift</i></b> spell will take you into 
that inner plane. Thus, a round trip would require four<b><i>Plane Shift</i></b>
 spells and the proper two sets of tuning forks. (One to go ethereal and travel 
to where you wish to be, one to go PMP from that point and go adventuring on 
the PMP or inner plane, another to go ethereal again when you are finished in 
that location and so you may travel back home on the ethereal plane, and one 
more to go back to the PMP and home).</p>
<p>Here's a lively little example: Your party wishes to quickly get to the 
capital city of Katana on the northern continent. Traveling via ship would take 
weeks and this is too long. Using a plane shift, the party moves into the 
border ethereal plane near Alodar. Now traveling to Katana would only take 3 or 
4 hours, 1/100th the time of the sea voyage. Since this is in the near or 
border ethereal only one encounter roll would be made. Provided no encounters 
happened, you could then shift down to the PMP and find yourself up to several 
hundred yards off target. You'd then walk into Katana. (It's usually a good 
idea to come down to the PMP at least several hundred yards outside of a city).
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the evil wizard you are after, just teleported to Katana. If 
you travel via the border ethereal plane, the wizard will almost certainly kill 
your friends in Katana before you'd arrive to stop him. Thus, you travel to the 
border ethereal via a<b><i>Plane Shift</i></b> spell. You next pass through the 
ethereal curtain into the deep ethereal plane. Traveling to Katana will require 
at least three encounter rolls since you've never made this trip before via the 
deep ethereal plane. If the ethereal cyclone gets you, you can say a prayer 
over the graves of your friends later, provided you survive. If you luck out 
and manage to avoid any encounters in the deep ethereal, you may arrive at the 
adjacent ethereal curtain to Katana.</p>
<p>This is the same curtain you passed through before, but in a different 
location. You could go to the curtain of one of the other inner planes from 
here, but your friends are counting on you so you stay near the curtain to the 
PMP. Then, you next pass through the curtain into the border ethereal plane. 
From there, you get your bearings and travel a short distance to Katana. 
Finally, after a mere 2 seconds PMP time of deep ethereal travel, and perhaps a 
total of 10 minutes of border ethereal travel near both Alodar and near Katana, 
you arrive on the PMP close to Katana. You hurriedly rush into the city to warn 
your friends. Of course, the evil wizard arrived in Katana almost one turn, or 
10 minutes, before you did (Teleportation in the blink of an eye, you know?). 
Will your advantage of better knowing the probable location of your friends be 
enough, or will the evil wizard still beat you to the punch? (Traveling via a 
plane shift through the astral plane may be slightly quicker, though a little 
more dangerous as nastier things tend to live on the astral plane).</p>
<h2>THE INNER PLANES</h2> 
<p>The inner planes of existence include the proper elemental planes of water, 
air, fire, and earth as well as the positive material plane (the +MP) and the 
negative material plane (the -MP). Also included are the paraelemental planes. 
These include the paraelemental planes of ice, ooze, magma, and smoke, all of 
which border the proper elemental planes. Next, those planes that border the 
+MP or border the -MP include the quasi-elemental planes. These include the 
quasi-elemental planes of salt, dust, ash, and vacuum which border the -MP, and 
the quasi-elemental planes of radiance, minerals, steam, and lightning which 
border the +MP.</p>
<p>It is easiest to enter these planes from the ethereal plane by passing 
through the correct color ethereal curtain. This would take you to the border 
ethereal plane for that particular inner plane. From there, one can plane shift 
down to the adjacent inner plane. Of course, survival within one of these inner 
planes may be problematic. It is practically a death sentence to enter most of 
these planes without the proper preparations. For example, entering earth would 
kill you if you couldn't freely move through or breath earth; entering water 
would probably drown you; entering fire would almost certainly burn you to 
death; entering air, on the other hand, would be reasonably safe. Entering into 
the +MP or the -MP would be almost instant death. The<b><i>Manual of the Planes
</i></b> has done a careful and considered treatment of each of these problems. 
I have no wish to repeat such a fine body of work at this time.</p>
<p>Where I disagreed with the <b><i>Manual of the Planes</i></b>, however, 
invites comment. Right away I didn't see the need for time to run differently, 
so it doesn't in my universe. I didn't particularly like the mode of travel in 
the inner planes. They suggest one simply decide which direction gravity should 
be in and suddenly find themselves at a velocity of 1,000 feet/round or about 
17 ft/sec. This is probably because they wish to avoid even simple equations of 
motion involving accelerations. I don't have a problem with such things; so my 
world doesn't have a problem with such things.</p>
<p>Since I decided mental thought was sufficient to change the sense of 
gravity, and I decided to use the utility of requiring one round of thought to 
change that sense, I simply had to decide upon an acceleration constant. Or 
better yet, an acceleration formula as a function of one's intelligence and 
wisdom. Thus, without the aid of additional magic, one's acceleration is up to 
one half of their combined intelligence and wisdom in ft/sec^2. For example, a 
man with an 18 intelligence and a 12 wisdom would have an acceleration of up to 
15 ft/sec^2. Eventually, one would reach their terminal velocity. This would be 
determined by the conditions of that particular plane. Typical examples of 
terminal velocities might be 100 feet/second in air, 10 feet/second in water, 
1,000 feet/second in fire, and 0 feet/second in earth. (68.2, 6.82, 682, 0 mph 
or 28&quot;, 3&quot;, 280&quot;, or 0&quot; respectively).</p>
<p>As a reminder for the interested reader, the following equations are useful:
</p>
<p>Distance Traveled = Average Velocity x Time.<b> D = VaveT</b> </p>
<p>Final Velocity = Starting Velocity + Acceleration x Time. <b> Vf = Vi + AT
</b> </p>
<p>Average Velocity = One Half x (Final Velocity + Starting Velocity).<b> Va = 
[Vf + Vi]/2</b> </p>
<p>(Final Velocity)2 - (Starting Velocity)2 = 2 x Acceleration x Distance. <b> 
Vf2 - Vi2 = 2AD</b> </p>
<p>Distance = Starting Velocity x Time + One Half x Acceleration x Time2.<b> D 
= ViT + (AT2)/2</b><br>
</p>
<p>Often times conditions for problems are set such that initial velocities 
and such are zero, and drop right out and need not be considered further. This 
greatly simplifies many equations, too.</p>
<p>Now, a man would be able to achieve terminal velocity of the plane of 
elemental fire in about 66 seconds or one round, provided his acceleration 
constant is 15 ft/s^2. Thus, only a very short time (2 rounds) is required to 
accelerate from a stopped position to terminal velocity (1 round to change the 
sense of gravity, and another round to accelerate to terminal velocity). 
Therefore, if you really wish, simply use your terminal velocities as the 
normal traveling speeds of your PCs. If you do decide to use some of the 
equations, when it becomes very important in a particular situation, just 
remember to keep your units of measurement consistent throughout the equations.
</p>
<p>Naturally, one can see why the official word from on high might wish to 
avoid even these simple equations, as they wouldn't want a certain level of 
physics or mathematics to be a prerequisite to playing AD&amp;D. I'm not even 
sure a simpler level of mathematics is possessed by the writers of AD&amp;D, as 
indicated by their apparent confusion and almost interchangeable use between 10 
cubic feet and 10 feet cubed. However, as I have mentioned, these first 
approximation equations are no problem for me, take practically no time at all, 
and lend the game a sense of realism that I enjoy, and even then I only employ 
them in those rare instances when a quick calculation will show if you can stop 
in time or you will hit that wall, and this doesn't come up very often to begin 
with. Of course, the second or third approximations - taking friction and drag 
constants into consideration - would be too much for me to do simply. Maybe 
they're not for you and you'd like to include them. Oh well.</p>
<h2>THE OUTER PLANES</h2> 
<p>I wish to remain deliberately vague on the outer planes. In a similar 
fashion, I like the gods to remain obscure. Keeping the players from knowing 
too much about the outer planes, the gods, or even the after life is one's best 
defense against their trying to take advantage of the weak links in one's 
armor. This is a specific case for one of the most important rules as a DM. 
Never explain yourself or justify your rulings unless you absolutely have to. 
This just invites argument. Now don't get me wrong. Feedback is necessary and 
good, and asking your players what they think is vitally important. But 
remember it is your world. After you've taken things into consideration and 
made your ruling, don't let anybody push you around. It's just a fact, as it 
turns out, your players are less inclined to even attempt to push you around if 
you don't give them total access to your thoughts by explaining yourself. So, 
if you can avoid it, don't do it. And, of course, that's why I like to keep the 
outer planes and the gods a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say I have no more desire to include the outer planes in my 
world than I have to include the gods actively adventuring with the PCs. Of 
course the outer planes do exist, as well as the gods, and are an ever-present 
reminder of the powers that be. When I do include them in my campaign they are 
there only briefly, only in avatar form, and usually for very specific reasons. 
That is, I would never bring in a god on a whim or as a random encounter. 
Usually I won't even do that but will instead send a representative of the 
deity.</p>
<p>At best, I include the first layers of the outer planes. At least, insofar 
as my players and their PCs can gain access to them. I may one day decide to 
include more, but I'll have to be very careful if I head down that path.</p>
<p>For now, it is enough to know that reaching the first layers of the outer 
planes may be accomplished via the astral plane or through the so called 
conduits which connect them directly to the PMP.</p>
<h2>MORE GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE PLANES</h2> 
<p>In my campaigns I like to pretty much stay on the PMP. When I use the other 
planes of existence it is usually for the purposes of explaining some 
underlying reality, or for the purpose of travel from point A to point B on the 
PMP via such planes. As such, it is true the ethereal and astral planes 
frequently come into play. The inner planes may be, of course, useful for an 
adventure or two every now and then. I usually have the party go there on some 
specific quest. I would use the outer planes for the same purpose, but with 
less frequency, and only for more powerful groups.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Plane Shift</i></b> spell is the favorite method of travel 
between the planes. With the proper tuning forks a group can travel from the 
PMP directly to any of the four elemental planes or directly to the ethereal or 
astral planes. Other planes may be accessed with a<b><i>Plane Shift</i></b> 
spell if they first get closer. That is, to get to the paraelemental planes, 
quasi-elemental planes, +MP, or -MP via plane shift, one must first either be 
ethereal or adjacent to said plane on another inner plane. To get to the first 
layer of an outer plane using plane shift, you must first plane shift to the 
astral plane where you can then travel to the proper pool or plane shift 
directly to the outer plane if you have the proper tuning fork.</p>
<p>Other possible modes of transport exist as well. Naturally occurring 
vortices or nexus points may arise on the PMP to any of the inner planes, to 
different alternate planes, or to a different location on the PMP. These may be 
permanent, temporary, or periodic nexus points.</p>
<p>Permanent nexus points usually arise where there are permanent conditions 
sufficient to bridge the gap between the PMP in tendril space and another plane 
of existence. As an example, a nexus point to the paraelemental plane of ice 
may be found in the permanently frozen wastelands of the Polar Regions. Another 
example would be a nexus to the elemental plane of fire inside the heart of an 
active volcano. These are examples of sympathetic nexal points.</p>
<p>Temporary nexus points may arise after, or during unusual conditions. These 
conditions bridge the gap between the PMP in tendril space and one of the other 
planes. For example, a hurricane may open a nexus into the elemental plane of 
air or a particularly powerful bolt of lightning may open one into the 
quasi-elemental plane of lightning. Such nexus points may only last long enough 
for a party, which just happens to be in the vicinity, to travel through before 
forever closing. Another method of returning must be used. Of course what 
usually happens is something native to such a plane takes the brief opportunity 
to come onto the PMP, giving any such convenient party something to deal with.
</p>
<p>Periodic nexus points are like permanent ones except they don't quite 
bridge the gap from the PMP to a different plane. Such places may be found to 
be unusual with the aid of a detect magic or a detect invisibility spell. It 
turns out the periodic motion of the orbit of the planet may open such a nexus 
once a year as the point passes through the right conditions on the ethereal or 
astral planes. Or, for example, perhaps every seventeen years when the planets 
are in the right alignment, or even every month when Folar eclipses Septer. 
This periodic pattern would depend entirely on the type of nexus point and its 
location. Actually, more importantly, it depends on the whims of the DM.</p>
<p>Also, periodic nexus points have very regular duration so you may rely on 
them. For example, the nexus point to the paraelemental plane of ice that 
occurs every eighteen years always opens up in the same place on the surface of 
the Imperial Sea and stays open for one Folar (10 days). A group of brave 
adventurers may sail into the point making the transition from the relatively 
warm Imperial Sea to a very chilly arctic like sea. From there, they may travel 
to a frozen glacial covered land where they may find the pools of liquid 
nitrogen. I once sent them there to immerse Tripdarius, a frost brand sword, 
which had recently become inactive. They did this in the hopes of reviving its 
lost powers.</p>
<p>Other typical uses of temporary nexus points might include a gate which 
opens up onto the first level of hell, on the far side of Orlantia, on a 
different planet in a different solar system, or even somewhere else. Whatever 
the DM wishes the DM can create. I have, for example, a little known gate that 
opens when Septer and Folar eclipse when they are both in full phase. This 
happens once a year, during the spring equinox. This gate opens up onto the far 
side of Septer and stays open for one day. So what, you say? Well, all right, 
so what? It's still there.</p>
<h2>THE DIMENSIONAL COORDINATES OF OTHER PLANES OF EXISTENCE</h2> 
<p>Historically, long before the empire made its rise, certain planar magic 
began to be developed. These were dimensional coordinate magics. Everything on 
the PMP could be given the 3 coordinates of length, width, and height. But, 
they also had a fourth coordinate- the PMP coordinate. This fourth number 
simply indicated which plane of existence you were on. If you could change that 
number, you'd be on another plane.</p>
<p>Through research and experimentation, various planar coordinates were 
tried. It was discovered one could do this by enveloping oneself in a kind of 
mental field (usually achieved through meditative states). This field started 
to actually decrease the probability of your existence on your current plane. 
Eventually, if you did it right, the probability of you being elsewhere became 
higher than the probability of your being here. This form of probability 
travel, also known as planar tunneling, was the forerunner of most planar magic.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though they discovered they could travel elsewhere, 
they didn't always know where. The current known planes of existence have come 
down through the ages as reasonably safe places from whence one could return. 
Or, if not safe, from whence one could return if properly protected before one 
went there, and if you didn't remain too long. Other planar coordinates have 
been tried. So far, no matter what protections were given, the travelers have 
never returned. These planes of &quot;DEATH&quot; are avoided. Of course, they 
may be great places that have nothing to do with death but only something to do 
with the inability to travel back home. They're still avoided whenever 
possible. I won't even go there.</p>
<p>Of course this leads me to wonder about the development of magic, the 
different kinds of abilities and limitations of magic, and what magic really 
is, anyway. You too, you say? Follow the link then.</p>
