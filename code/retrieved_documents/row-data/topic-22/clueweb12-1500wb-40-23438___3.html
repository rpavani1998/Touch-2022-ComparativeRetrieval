<h3>Subway Switches From Pepsi to Coke</h3> 
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports (sub. req'd) that Subway is 
switching its fountain business from Pepsi to Coke. According to the article, 
Subway has more U.S. and Canadian restaurants than McDonald's, which I was 
unaware of.</p> 
<p>A spokesman for Pepsi said, &quot;It's inconceivable to think this has 
anything to do with products or service. This is about an incredibly big bag of 
cash, and we hope Coke is offering the same deal to the rest of its 
customers.&quot;</p> 
<p>I'm sure Subway got a good deal from Coke, but I wouldn't say it's <em>
inconceivable</em> this decision was made on product quality as well. When 
deciding which restaurant to eat at, the first question that invariably comes 
to my mind is, &quot;Do they sell Coke products, or Pepsi products?&quot; This 
is an extremely important question. If the answer is the latter, then the food 
simply must be<em>outstanding</em>, so that I'm willing to put up with Pepsi. 
It is for this reason that I largely avoid the Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried 
Chicken, Taco Bell triumvirate, all formerly owned by PepsiCo, Inc., and still 
selling that inferior product. If I go somewhere I don't know what they sell, I 
order a Coke. If the waiter/waitress asks me, &quot;Is Pepsi OK?,&quot; I make 
it a point to give a disappointing look, sometimes settling for water.</p> 
<p>Coke simply has better products, and Coca Cola, Co.'s superiority over 
PepsiCo with respect to their flagship colas is substantially comparable to the 
superiority the 1927 Yankees would have over the little league team I played on 
when was 11. (Side note: For purposes of this discussion, and really for 
purposes of my life, I'm ignoring that Mountain Dew and Mello-Yellow exist.)</p>
<p>On Monday, <em>Motley Fool</em> writer Rex Moore reported the results of a 
highly scientific blind taste test at<em>Fool</em> headquarters between Vanilla 
Coke and Pepsi Vanilla. The results? Out of 19 taste-testers, 68% chose the 
correct response, Vanilla Coke. Which only leaves us with one question: What in 
the world is wrong with the taste buds of 32% of<em>Fool</em> employees? (Note 
#2: I have never tasted Pepsi Vanilla. I do not believe, however, that in any 
way hinders my comparison of the two products.)</p> 
<p>In sum, I'd like to say congratulations to Subway. You have chosen wisely. 
And I don't have to avoid you anymore.</p>
