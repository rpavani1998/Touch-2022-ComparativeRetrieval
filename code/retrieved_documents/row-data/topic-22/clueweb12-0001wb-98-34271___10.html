<h1>Discountitus, the Disease That's Sweeping the Marketing Community</h1>

 Al Ries <br>
 Last month, J.C. Penney hired a new chief 
executive who used to runApple stores. In a New York Times article, here's how 
CEO Ron Johnson described his plans for Penney: &quot;Take this great American 
brand and make it become something unbelievably exciting.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p> Fat chance. </p> 
<p> <strong>Most department stores are infected </strong><br>
 You seldom see 
a department-store advertisement based on anything except a sale. The latest 
J.C. Penney ad was a six-page insert promoting a &quot;Fourth of July 
sale.&quot;</p> 
<p> In addition to dozens of &quot;super hot buys,&quot; the insert features 
&quot;Red Zone clearance, final-markdowns 80% off. New markdowns 50-70% 
off.&quot; Also featured is &quot;jcpCA$H,&quot; offering consumers &quot;$10 
off any purchase totaling $25 &amp; up.&quot;</p> 
<p> Belk, Dillards, Kohl's, Macy's, Sears and most mainstream department 
stores are also infected by<em>discountitus</em>. </p> 
<p> Kohl's, in particular. A typical mailing: &quot;Start with these 
incredible sale prices of 20-60% off. Take an extra 15% off everything. Plus 
add a $5 bonus.&quot;</p> 
<p> <strong>Airlines to pizza to car insurance </strong><br>
 In industry 
after industry, the discount is the focus of the advertising.</p> 
<p> Here's the opening dialog of a typical Progressive commercial featuring 
Flo and a potential customer.</p> 
<p> &quot;Are you a safe driver?&quot; </p> 
<p> &quot;Yes.&quot; </p> 
<p> &quot;Discount! Do you own a home?&quot; </p> 
<p> &quot;Yes.&quot; </p> 
<p> &quot;Discount! Are you gonna buy online?&quot; </p> 
<p> &quot;Yes.&quot; </p> 
<p> &quot;Discount!&quot; </p> 
<p> Over at Geico, &quot;15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car 
insurance.&quot; Geico and Progressive are the biggest spenders in the 
category. Last year Geico spent $741 million on advertising. Progressive, $506 
million. Longtime car-insurance leaders like State Farm ($453 million) and 
Allstate ($368 million) are lagging behind.</p> 
<p> <strong>Penney vs. Apple </strong><br>
 Over at J.C. Penney, if Ron 
Johnson plans to use an Apple strategy to turn his company around, it's too 
late. Once discountitus has spread through an industry, it's awfully hard to 
eradicate.</p> 
<p> Take airlines. Yesterday, airline companies competed on the basis of who 
could build the better brand. Today, airline companies compete on the basis of 
who can offer the bigger discounts. No wonder Southwest Airlines is a big 
winner, and most airline customers can't explain the difference between 
American, Delta and United.</p> 
<p> One reason why discountitus is spreading so rapidly is the internet. 
Clipping coupons is being replaced by typing on keyboards. Groupon and the 
other daily-deal websites are only one factor. Anybody who owns a computer 
today can get competitive prices on a host of items almost instantly.</p> 
<p> Unless you want to spend the rest of your life doing discount marketing, 
you should be asking yourself, &quot;What's the cure?&quot;</p> 
<p> <strong>Believers vs. agnostics </strong><br>
 Take a closer look at the 
consumer a company is trying to reach with its advertising and PR.</p> 
<p> Psychologically, consumers can be divided into two categories: 1) Brand 
believers and 2) Brand agnostics. And they vary by category. They can be 
believers in one category (ketchup) and agnostics in another category 
(airlines).</p> 
<p> Watch believers go through the Sunday supplements. They only clip coupons 
for<em>brands</em> they already use. </p> 
<p> Watch agnostics go through the Sunday supplements. They ignore brands and 
clip coupons for<em>categories</em>. (Extreme agnostics don't buy anything 
without a coupon.)</p> 
<p> Discountitus is turning brand believers into brand agnostics. The lure of 
a &quot;big discount&quot; is enough to seduce a consumer into thinking that 
all brands in the category are pretty much alike.</p> 
<p> In categories that have not been seriously contaminated, the cure for 
discountitus is a dose of positioning. But as Prophet, a leading marketing 
consultancy, reported in its latest state of marketing study: &quot;Positioning 
has always been about differentiation. But in this unfolding environment, 
differentiation is short-lived.&quot;</p> 
<p> We differ on that. The cure for discountitus is not differentiation. Nor 
is positioning essentially about differentiation, either.</p> 
<p> <strong>Positioning is owning a word in the mind</strong><br>
 As 
discountitus spreads its way through the marketing community, that word more 
often than not is &quot;leadership.&quot;</p> 
<p> Leadership is what makes Google the most powerful brand in the 
&quot;search&quot; category. Leadership is what makes iPod the most powerful 
brand in the &quot;MP3 player&quot; category. Leadership is what makes Heinz, 
Hertz, Haagen-Daz, Hellmann's, Home Depot and a host of other brands powerful 
in their categories.</p> 
<p> But how to you get to be the leader? And how does the leader keep from 
catching the discountitus disease?</p> 
<p> <strong>Launch a new brand in a new category </strong><br>
 Over the past 
few decades, it's become clear that the only way to become a leader is to 
launch a new brand in a new category.</p> 
<p> Like Apple did with the iPad, the first tablet-computer. Currently, the 
iPad has some 75% of the tablet market.</p> 
<p> An also-ran that has been line-extended to death has no hope of ever 
becoming the market leader. The best it can do is to narrow its focus to shore 
up a position in a segment of the category.</p> 
<p> Has Pepsi-Cola ever substantially increased its share of the cola market 
with Pepsi-Cola Retro, Pepsi Throwback, Pepsi Twist, Pepsi Natural, Pepsi Raw, 
Pepsi A.M., Pepsi Kona, Pepsi Light, Pepsi Max, Pepsi XL, Pepsi Blue, Pepsi One 
or Crystal Pepsi?</p> 
<p> No, it has not. In fact, regular Pepsi-Cola has fallen behind Diet Coke to 
third place in the cola category.</p> 
<p> What's next for Pepsi-Cola? More of the same. Pepsi Next. </p> 
<p> <strong>Lower the boom on price </strong><br>
 If you read the papers, you 
know the regular price of most products or services on the market today is 
&quot;50% off.&quot;</p> 
<p> Every Thursday, our local newspaper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 
features &quot;This week's best deals.&quot; Last week, there were eight. One 
was &quot;free.&quot; One was &quot;40% off&quot; and the other six were 
&quot;50% off.&quot;</p> 
<p> That's not unusual. By far, the vast majority of daily deals are 50% off 
or BOGO -- buy one, get one free.</p> 
<p> When rumors of Apple's imminent launch of a tablet computer circulated on 
the internet, the pundits predicted the product would be priced around a 
thousand dollars.</p> 
<p> Apple surprised them with a list price of $495. The company lowered the 
boom at a level that competitors had difficulty getting under. Today, you find 
the table-computer market remarkably free of discountitus.</p> 
<p> Apple used the same strategy with its iTunes brand by insisting on a 
99-cent price. (Don't feel sorry for Apple. The company is making its money on 
volume, not on margin.)</p> 
<p> When you're the leader in a category, you cannot be overtaken by a 
competitor who thinks differentiation is going to make a big difference.</p> 
<p> And when you're the leader in the category and you lower the boom on 
price, you can inoculate the category from the disease of discountitus.</p>
