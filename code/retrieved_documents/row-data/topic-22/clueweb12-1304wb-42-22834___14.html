<h1>News flash: Octopuses are actually psychic!</h1>  September 6, 2010 | 
Posted by Mike Lisieski<br>

<p>Here at the Southern Fried Science Network, all of us bloggers have been 
charged to post articles dealing with ocean-related pseudoscience as part of 
SFSN&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Ocean of Pseudoscience Week.&rdquo; Since I try to 
keep this blog firmly focused on cephalopods, I was at first antsy that I would 
not find anything to write about. However, the (sometimes distressingly) wide 
pool of information that is the internet has not disappointed me.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ve all heard about Paul the Octopus by now. A Google search for 
&ldquo;Paul the Octopus&rdquo; (the exact phrase) turns up 5.5 million results. 
A blossoming cephalopod enthusiast who is curious about Paul can pick from 
literally millions of sources of information to hear about this phenomenon, and 
if she&rsquo;s smart, will try to pick one that seems credible. Like, say, a
<strong>CNN news report</strong>. She would find some informative and 
entertaining quips, and would mostly get the facts straight. That is, until she 
got to the point in the article where the CNN reporter asks an 
&ldquo;expert&rdquo; the critical question:</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;Can an octopus really be psychic?&rdquo;</strong></p> 
<p>After reading this section, if she had any sort of head on her shoulders, 
our inquisitive internet reader would (hopefully) be aghast, and a bit miffed 
that a CNN report would be such a lousy source of information.</p> 
<p>Before I go on, let me say that there are any number of highly qualified 
people who could of answered this question. There are several researchers who 
study cephalopod behavior and cognition who are generally pretty friendly, and 
besides thatentire societies of researchers devoted to scientificially studying 
claims of the &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo;. CNN is supposed to be credible, 
right? They&rsquo;re one of the big names in news, globally. But their reporter 
didn&rsquo;t pick anybody who was an expert in the science and psychology 
behind &ldquo;parapsychological&rdquo; phenomena or an expert on cephalopods. 
Instead, he decided to interview Michelle Childerley (see herpersonal homepage
), a self-proclaimed &ldquo;Animal Communication Expert<br>
 Pet Psychic &amp; 
Behaviour Specialist.&rdquo; Her qualifications include thinking that she could 
talk to her pet dog as a child (who didn&rsquo;t, though?), as is proclaimed on 
her&ldquo;About&rdquo; page:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Michelle felt since the age of seven that she was aware of a special 
connection with her dog Jason, her soul mate throughout her childhood. She 
always knew exactly what Jason was thinking and feeling and would enjoy endless 
conversations. After Jason was taken away at the age of twelve, Michelle shut 
down her intuitive awareness for many years to come.<br>
 It wasn&rsquo;t until 
2006 that Michelle became aware of her ability once again when the dog of a man 
selling the big issue suddenly spoke to her. In that moment a reconnection was 
established and Michelle then set out to bridge the gap between animal and 
human communication.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>(As an aside: what is &ldquo;the big issue&rdquo;? I&rsquo;d love to know.)
</p> 
<p>So what did Ms. Childerley have to say about Paul? You might have guessed 
what her take would be. Fromthe CNN article: </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Michelle Childerley, who describes herself as an animal communications 
expert, told CNN that all animals &mdash; as well as humans &mdash; possess a 
psychic ability, with telepathy the main way of communicating among many 
species. She says dogs can often sense what an owner wants before they vocalize 
it.<br>
 As for as Paul&rsquo;s ability to predict a football result, 
Childerley claims the octopus is perfectly aware of what he is being asked. 
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s picking up on what everyone around him is thinking,&rdquo; 
she said. &ldquo;He knows there are two boxes which represent two sides, so 
he&rsquo;s basically tuned in to the more positive team at the moment he makes 
his choice.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Why care about this women and her claims about communications with animals? 
For one thing, she&rsquo;s selling these claims to people as a sort of 
veterinary care, taking money both from misled pet owners and from legitimate 
practitioners (this is not to say she might not use some legitimate animal 
training procedures in some of her work, but she will also accept 30 pounds to 
do an &ldquo;animal readings/consultations by an emailed or posted 
photograph&rdquo;, which means that you send her some money and a picture of 
your pet, and she will tell you what&rsquo;s wrong with your pet&rsquo;s 
emotional/psychic life. Despite my small knowledge of the field of veterinary 
medicine, I am sure that this is not a legitimate veterinary care technique.) 
In addition, claims like hers serve to distract from and give a bad name to 
people who are trying to work on the sciences of animal communication and 
animal-human communication. It turns out that communicating with animals in a 
reproducible and useful way is much more difficult than being paid money to 
look at a digital image and coming up with a diagnosis and prognosis based on 
the feeling you get from the image. Pet psychics (especially those who bill 
themselves with sciencey-sounding titles like &ldquo;Animal Communications 
Expert&rdquo;) give a bad name to the scientists who are working hard to 
actually understand and explain animal communication and cognition.</p> 
<p>The reporter might have redeemed the article if he&rsquo;d presented any 
other opinions on the topic, or any indication that readers might want take 
this &ldquo;expert&rsquo;s&rdquo; testimony with a grain of salt. Sadly, he 
didn&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re left wondering whether he really took Ms. 
Childerley&rsquo;s comments seriously, or if he&rsquo;s just kind of bad at 
finding relevant people to interview.</p> 
<p>To give credit and links where they are due, I first heard about this story 
at Boing Boing, where Maggie Koerth-Baker had the right reaction to it: a hearty
facepalm.</p> 
<p>Thanks for reading!</p> <br>

<p>Just FYI, &ldquo;The Big Issue&rdquo; is actually a very worthy social 
institution &mdash; it&rsquo;s a (thankfully non-religious) magazine for sale 
by those who are homeless, generally contains a mix of news, interviews &amp; 
reviews of general bits and pieces, occasionally has a mix CD of pop or rock 
music donated by artists stuck in there. The vendors have to sign a pledge to 
stay clean and sober, in return they get most of the cover price of what they 
sell &amp; help finding long-term housing.</p> 
<p>And yes, why anyone in the world takes Childerly seriously is utterly 
beyond me. You would think anyone with two brain cells to rub together for a 
spark would be able to spot delusion as serious as this, but there you go. It 
seems one will never go broke by underestimating general common sense.</p> Reply

<p>CNN sent a camera crew on a shark cruise I was on. The reporter, Rob 
Marciano, usually spends his time as the weather guy on CNN&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;American Morning&rdquo;. Sending strange people to do stories is nothing 
new.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Let me blow your mind, Mike. Here&rsquo;s a way to make millions of dollars 
with Paul the Psychic Octopus.</p> 
<p>Picture a TV commercial. In it, Paul is in a tank. On one side is a can of 
coke. On the other is a can of Pepsi. The narrator says &ldquo;The question of 
Coke vs. Pepsi has been debated for decades. Now, Paul the psychic octopus will 
finally answer, once and for all, which is better&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Pepsi or Coke, if you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re welcome.</p> Reply

<p>There&rsquo;s lots of brands it could work for. Ford vs. Chevy (Paul could 
click the auto-start up button on the keys), Kelloggs vs. General Mills, etc.
