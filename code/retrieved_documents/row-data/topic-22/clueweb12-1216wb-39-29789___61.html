<br>

Even though the Emmys are still about 7 weeks away, I'm going to go ahead and 
put the Emmy Ballot online already for the &quot;Beat TVGuy Online 
International Sweepstakes Extravaganza!&quot;...<br>
<br>
The reasons are 
varied...<br>
<br>
1. I'll be pretty busy in September due to that, you know, 
getting married thing...<br>
2. Why put off tomorrow what you can do today? <br>
3.I'm bored. <br>
<br>
So, as a refresher to those of you who are new to the 
world o' TVGuy...<br>
<br>
1. Entries are free but you may only enter once. <br>
2. You may email your selections to me (my email link is always available on 
this page near the top) but they must be received by Saturday, September 15th 
by 2pm M.S.T.<br>
3. There will be prizes awarded (tba) but to win them you 
must have a higher total than me. I will post my selections the evening before 
the awards ceremony...<br>
4. There is a special prize for highest total for 
Colorado Residents only, regardless of beating my entry or not...<br>
<br>
Got 
it? Okay.. then let's get to the categories... (I'll link to this in my Links 
column so you don't have to bookmark this page or anything... this form will be 
just a click away in the weeks leading up to the Emmys...)<br>

My friend Troy has had 
some &quot;Movie Fests&quot; this summer where he shows the first two films in 
a trilogy at his impressive home theater, then they go out to an actual theater 
for part 3... &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, 
&quot;Shrek&quot;... all have gotten this treatment this season... for one 
reason or another scheduling has prohibited TVGal and I from attending... and 
there is just one more film series left for us to try to be there for...<br>

<br>I'll let his delightful email invitation speak for itself below.... <br>

<br> __ <br>
<br>
To the person reading this email right now.... <br>
<br>
The 
following conversation by cell phone between you and Jason Bourne was received 
and recorded on July 24th at approximately 3:56 PM, MST and has been 
transcribed as follows....<br>
<br>
You: Is this Jason? <br>
Jason: It is. Er, 
it was. Actually it&rsquo;s Bob now. Bob Freber.<br>
You: Uh, 
Bob?.............Really?<br>
Jason: Yes, but the name&rsquo;s not important. 
Please listen carefully -<br>
You: - Seriously? 
&ldquo;Bob&rdquo;....that&rsquo;s the best you could do?<br>
Jason: The name 
doesn&rsquo;t matter &ndash; look, you need to focus, alright?<br>
You: 
&ldquo;Bob Freber&rdquo;?<br>
Jason: Listen to me! It&rsquo;s very important 
that you go to Troy and Lisa&rsquo;s house one week from this Sunday!<br>
You: 
Ummm....okay.<br>
Jason: You got that? Troy and Lisa's. <br>
You: Right. 
Who&rsquo;s house?<br>
Jason: The Blossers! XXXX S. FXXXXXXX Place in Highlands 
Ranch.<br>
You: Right! Got it. Sooooo, why am I going there exactly? <br>
Jason:
 Look - they're tracking me, so all I can say right now is....BOURNE FEST.<br>

You: Sweet! <br>
Jason: Here are some of the details -Sunday, August 5th, the 
fest starts at 2:00pm with THE BOURNE IDENTITY.<br>
You: Cool! <br>
Jason: 
Followed byTHE BOURNE SUPREMACY at 4:30pm.<br>
You: What about the third one? 
<br> Jason: Everyone will then go to the AMC Highlands Ranch 24 to see THE 
BOURNE ULTIMATUM, so make sure to contact Troy by Saturday August 4th if you 
want an advance ticket.<br>
You: Right...August 4th. What should I bring to the 
fest?<br>
Jason: Feel free to bring a snack or beverage to share. <br>
You: Got 
it. Anything else?<br>
Jason: I also here there's going to be a raffle - <br>

You: Ooh! A prize? <br>
Jason: Possibly. You'll have to find out on the 5th. 
Just remember that....<br>
You: Yes? <br>
Jason: ....wait....wait.....I think 
they've found me.....<br>
You: What? <br>
Jason: I have to go - <br>
You: Wait -
<br> Jason: I have to go NOW! Don't forget - Sunday August 5th! <br>
You: But 
wait -<br>
Jason: - they found me.... <br>
<em>(muffled gunshot is heard)</em> 
<br> <br>
With an invitation that well done, how can we not go? Plus I'm really 
looking forward to &quot;Bourne Ultimatum&quot;... which by all accounts is the 
best film of the summer... So we'll be there Troy... really... see ya Sunday....
<br> <br>
________________ <br>
Jason: I can tell you the license plate numbers 
of all six cars outside. I can tell you that our waitress is left-handed and 
the guy sitting up at the counter weighs two hundred fifteen pounds and knows 
how to handle himself. I know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of 
the gray truck outside, and at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half 
mile before my hands start shaking. Now why would I know that? How can I know 
that and not know who I am?<br>

Saw this really 
interesting movie trailer before &quot;Transformers&quot; the other day... for 
a movie codenamed &quot;Cloverfield&quot; or &quot;01-18-08&quot; or something 
or other.... apparently it's caused quite the ruckus on the 'net... it is 
officially untitled as of this time, but here is the teaser poster for it...<br>

<br>
Speaking of movies, 
watched &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot; while TVGal was raking in the Wedding Shower 
gifts on Sunday...<br>
<br>
I was all ready to mock this thing to Kingdom 
Come... I mean, Stallone wrote<em>and</em> directed it!! The cheesiest possible 
sequel with a fiftysomething fighter in the ring... mockery is at hand!!<br>

<br>and.... <em>no</em>. <br>
<br>
Shit. It was actually pretty good. I'm 
stunned. How is that possible?????<br>
<br>
Really. I'm not kidding. The 
Cinematography, lighting, editing... damn. Mix in Bill Conti's now immortal 
score... and I've got chills.<br>
<br>
Well, at least the ending will be cheesy 
and he'll triumph predictably and we can...<br>
<br>
...good lord, <em>
noooooooooo</em>. I'm stunned. Wow. Didn't see that coming... <br>
<br>
Damn 
you Sylvester Stallone. Damn you....<br>

(the end credits music is just glorious... and 
the alternate ending (Spoiler Alert ahead!) that had Rocky winning the fight 
rather than losing it... well, much better decision for the film... glad they 
went the route they did... heck, I'm boosting the score to 70 just for that 
reason alone... can't remember being more surprised by a film in a long 
time....)<br>

While in Vegas last week I wanted to stop by 
the World Famous &quot;Welcome To Las Vegas&quot; sign and take a photo of 
myself with it...<br>
<br>
...not for any sentimental or nostalgic reason, but 
because it counts as a &quot;Virtual Geocache&quot; - a hobby of mine - and I 
was approaching my 100th find...<br>
<br>
I found out after talking to my 
cabbie that... well, this would be difficult as it was pretty far away from the 
main airport entrance... which wasn't a big deal.. I didn't give it a second 
thought actually... well, until my cabbie forced me to address it 17 times...
<br> <br>
What do I mean? Let's look in to the actual conversation between 
myself and my cab driver a week ago.... just bear with me...<br>
<br>
Cab 
Driver Guy: Where to? Airport? <br>
TVGuy: Yes. Was wondering if... <br>
Cab 
Driver Guy: That's no problem. Make tons of Airport runs every day. Between 
here and the Resort it's...<br>
TVGuy: Umm.. yes. But I was wondering if you 
could maybe do a stop by the airport...<br>
Cab Driver Guy: Where to? I make 
lots of runs to the Airport everyday and I'm very familiar with the...<br>

TVGuy: Well... I'm assuming you know where the Las Vegas Sign is... <br>
Cab 
Driver Guy: Oh yeah, I've driven tons of people there... it's a very popular 
spot for people to take pictures and...<br>
TVGuy: Yes, that's what I wanted to 
do. How far is it from the airport? I Googled it and it seemed like it was just 
across the street and...<br>
Cab Driver Guy: Well, yes, but it's on the other 
side. A fare to the airport is $21.00. If I took you over there it would be 
about double... you know, around say... $42.00...<br>
TVGuy: Oh. So you 
couldn't walk it from the spot you would normally drop me off at...<br>
Cab 
Driver Guy: Oh no, it's on the other side. Like ten miles. I make tons of runs 
to the airport each day and I can tell you firsthand that it would double your 
fare to about.. say... $42.00.<br>
TVGuy: ( <em>not caring that much in the 
first place</em>). Okay, just take me to the departures gate then. Forget about 
it. Wasn't that big of a deal. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Well, that of course is where a 
normal conversation would end... unfortunately, Cab Driver Guy had other 
ideas....<br>
<br>
Cab Driver Guy: I mean, I'm happy to take you over there... 
it's just that it will cost about $21 to take you to the airport but it will be 
about double... around $42 to take you over to that sign...<br>
TVGuy: Not a 
problem. I'll just do it another time. Don't worry about it.<br>
Cab Driver Guy:
 It's amazing how many people want their picture taken with that sign... I've 
taken tons of people over there... but it costs about double to do that rather 
than take them to the airport proper...<br>
TVGuy: Ummm... yes. I don't want to 
charge my company for a $42 cab ride. I'll do it another time. Thanks anyway. (
<em>Opens newspaper and begins to read</em>...) <br>
Cab Driver Guy: Yeah, that 
sign is real popular. Of course it costs double to go over there... about $42 
dollars rather than $21.... but I'm happy to take you over there if you want 
to...<br>
TVGuy: Umm.. No. Thanks. Forget I brought it up... <br>
Cab Driver 
Guy: I take a lot of people over there... that sign is real popular.. but its 
way over there.. look there.. do you see the Strip?<br>
TVGuy: ( <em>Looks up
</em>)... you mean the giant wall of casinos up ahead? Yeah, I see them... <br>

Cab Driver Guy: Well, the Sign is over to the left side and the Airport is over 
there to the right... it would cost you about double to go over there... I 
mean, I'm happy to take you over there...<br>
TVGuy: Err... no. The Departure 
Gate is fine. Thanks. I'll do it another time. Let's just drop...<br>
Cab 
Driver Guy: You see, the airport is over there... and the Sign is on the 
left... I mean, I'm happy to take you over there.. I just want you to know that 
it would cost about $42 for you to go over there... which is double the normal 
rate of.. er.. $21.<br>
TVGuy: ( <em>wondering if I've dropped onto the set of 
&quot;Groundhog Day</em> <em>2&quot;</em>) Umm.. No. I'll do the sign thing 
another time. Really. Just take me to the airport....<br>
Cab Driver: If you 
want, I can take you over there... but it would cost you double... I mean, I 
can take you there but it's on the other side of the airport... people love 
that sign...<br>
<br>
Okay, there was still 10 minutes left before I arrived at 
the airport... I was trapped withCaptain Repeato in this car and apparently the 
drive would cost me double.. you know, around $42.00. In case you hadn't 
gleaned that info so far...<br>
<br>
So rather than fight the conversation, I 
decided to take a different tactic the rest of the way....<br>
<br>
TVGuy: You 
know, I really would like to get my picture taken with that sign. How much 
would it cost to go over to the west side of the airport?<br>
Cab Driver Guy: 
Well, it would cost about double... it's $21.00 to the gate, so to go over 
there....<br>
TVGuy: So around $42??? <br>
Cab Driver Guy: Yes, that's right. I 
mean, I'm happy to take you over there and....<br>
TVGuy: So what you're saying 
is that it costs twice as much to go to the west side than the east side, then 
it costs half as much to go to the east side than it does the west side...<br>

Cab Driver Guy: ( <em>thinking hard</em>) Err.. well, all I know is that it 
costs double to...<br>
TVGuy: So it's half as much to go one place as it is the 
other, but twice as much to go the former rather than the latter. In effect a 
200% markup for one trip but a 50 percent reduction by half for the travel to 
loop back to the starting point....<br>
Cab Driver Guy: ( <em>brain beginning 
to lock up...)</em> Well, er... that sign is popular and I'm happy to drive... 
<br> TVGuy: I'm wondering if you went to the first place after the second place 
if you'd be able to cut the fare in half since the initial fare would be 50 
percent of what it normally would be despite the extra travel gained from 
preventing the mileage to double and in effect cutting the cost in half, say... 
$21. Which would be less than the starting price if the route was changed to go 
east rather than west, unless it's a Holiday, in which case fares are double 
unless you're in the Continental United States. Then it's half of what it would 
normally be, which is double the normal rate.. which is $42.<br>
Cab Driver: ( 
<em>confused to a point where his driving is actually becoming compromised</em>
...) I don't understand sir.. do you want to go to the sign or not...<br>
TVGuy:
 (<em>evilly</em>) I don't think so. But how much is it if I wanted to again?? 
<br> Cab Driver Guy: <em>(happy to understand a question again...)</em> $42!! I 
don't mind taking you over there but it would...<br>
TVGuy: Maybe next time. 
Let's just go to the terminal, which is about $21 as I understand it. Which is 
half as much as going to the Las Vegas Sign. Which people like. But it's 
farther away. And costs more. About double. Or twice the normal amount. Which 
is more than $21. By a factor of two. I think. I'm not good at doing math in my 
head. Do you have an abacus by any chance??<br>
Cab Driver Guy: ( <em>not sure 
what an abacus is</em>) Ummmm.... no. I don't think so. <br>
TVGuy: That's a 
damn shame... a damn shame.<br>
<br>
Silence ensued happily the rest of the 
trip. And yes, I did ask how much was the fare when I arrived at the gate. 
Surprisingly, it was $21. Which is, you know, less than $42.<br>

<br>It was &quot;Chick Flick&quot; night here at the Mansion the other evening 
and... well...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Music and Lyrics&quot; (Hugh Grant, Drew 
Barrymore); if you don't go in expecting much, well... you'll then get exactly 
what you're expecting... but all things considered, could have been worse... 
and Hugh Grant once again is a delight, regardless of the script....<br>

<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Because I Said So&quot; (Diane Keaton, 
Mandy Moore); I really think the professionals should handle this one....<br>

<br> &quot;As close to perfectly unwatchable as it can be...&quot; <br>

--Lawrence Toppman,<em>Charlotte Observer</em> <br>
<br>
&quot;By far the most 
appallingly cretinous picture in which Keaton has ever appeared...&quot; <br>

--Rick Kisonak,<em>Film Threat</em> <br>
<br>
&quot;Any relationship between 
the world of &quot;Because I Said So&quot; and actual human behavior is purely 
coincidental...&quot; <br>
--Scott Tobias, <em>The Onion</em> <br>
<em></em> 
<br> &quot;..derivative, unfunny and thuddingly bad...&quot; <br>
--Claudia 
Puig,<em> USA Today</em> <br>
<em></em> <br>
&quot;I hated this movie.&quot; 
<br>--Richard Roeper, <em>Ebert &amp; Roeper</em> <br>
<br>
I actually think 
it's worse than that... nearly unwatchable... the last scene has the mother and 
the daughters singing at a wedding with their &quot;men&quot; playing guitar 
behind them... whilst the guests watch approvingly.... if I attended a wedding 
where this occurred I would take my gift off the table, place it in front of 
the wedding party and light it on fire... a putrid film on every level....<br>

<br>
And another July 
4th photo...<br>
<br>
___ <br>
<br>
6 days of travel are over and order is 
restored at the TVGuy Mansion...<br>
<br>
I would like to note that our 3 days 
in Vegas were spent at perhaps the nicest hotel I've ever been to...<br>
<br>

Scratch that.. it was the nicest...(Green Valley Resort for those of you 
scoring at home...)<br>
<br>
I'll give you an example... they had a private 
pool area called &quot;The Pond&quot;...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

If you wanted to rent one of those cabanas, it would cost you anywhere between 
$100-$250 per hour (!) depending on the day... what do you get for that pricey 
amount? Glad you asked...<br>
<br>
11am Mini Smoothies: Island Oasis Tropical 
Smoothies<br>
<br>
12pm Evian Body Mist: Host will go by each cabana and offer 
a mist, spraying a fine stream of Evian from head to toe...<br>
<br>
1pm Ice 
Cold Towels: Cucumber and Citrus flavors will be watered and iced down in a 
fridge. Host will place on tray give out to cabanas...<br>
<br>
(Note: I'm not 
entirely sure why the towels are &quot;flavored&quot;? Are they edible? Sadly, 
I never discovered the answer...)<br>
<br>
2pm Frosted Grapes: Host will pull 
frosted grapes and place them in souffle cups and give to guests in cabanas...
<br> <br>
You get the idea... <br>
<br>
Anyway, great place and a nice way to 
spend three days... but I'm glad I'm home...<br>
<br>
Oh, I bought a magazine 
to read on the plane for the trip home and the cover photo and the photos 
inside were taken at that very resort that I stayed in... isn't that strange? 
What are the odds?<br>

It's time for yet another 
installment of America's Fastest Growing Web Sensation... &quot;I Had No 
Idea!&quot;... in which I learn more about something that has puzzled me either 
past or present.. and hopefully shines some light into the cupboard of 
ignorance...<br>
<br>
...on my first visits to the mountains and canyons of my 
now adopted state of Colorado I noted several spheres hanging from lines across 
the highway... you know, like this....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I noticed them again this 
weekend when we were driving back from Grand Junction... so yet again I ask.... 
what are those things for anyway?<br>
<br>
I Had No Idea! #3 <br>
<br>
Q: What 
are those colored balls hanging from lines over highways?<br>
<br>
A: They are 
primarily used for pilots (helicopters mostly) so they can see the wires... 30 
percent of the time when a helicopter strikes a wire it results in a 
fatality.... so two halves of a sphere are clamped on the wire for easy visual 
confirmation... they are almost always painted in Aviation Orange, although 
Red, Yellow and White are also used... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't you feel better now? I know I do... thanks 
again for joining us for &quot;I Had No Idea&quot;...<br>
<br>

was made possible by grants from Dell Laboratories, 7-11 and Viewers Like 
You...)<br>

<strong>New in Theaters This Week<br>

</strong> <br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Hairspray&quot; (John Travolta); this movie is 
getting incredible reviews... but I still have two problems with it...<br>
1. 
John Waters is a drag.<br>
2. John Travolta in drag. <br>
<br>
As such, it will 
be a rental I'm sure here at the TVGuy Mansion... and I'll give it a try. 
Really I will... honest. I think. Who the heck knows by then... this isn't 
legally binding is it??<br>
<br>
Rating (out of 100) <br>
Rotten Tomatoes: 94 
<br>Metacritic: 79 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Sunshine&quot; (Cillian 
Murphy); a sci-fi movie about the sun.. and earth.. and some other stuff. Maybe 
some spaceships... I've heard absolutely nothing about it... but it looks 
pretty good...<br>
<br>
Rating (out of 100)<br>
Rotten Tomatoes: 82 <br>

Metacritic:70 <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, by the way... this would be a good spot to say 
if you want to watch a movie trailer that is incredibly sophomoric but still 
pretty damn funny,click here and you'll be whisked away to TVGuy Video for 
&quot;Hot Rod&quot; (better than it sounds).<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; I Now 
Pronounce You Chuck And Larry&quot; (Adam Sandler, Kevin James); wow.. this 
film looks horrid. Like, you'd rather drive your car into a tree instead of 
watching it horrid... Proceed at your own risk...<br>
<br>
Rating (out of 100) 
<br>Rotten Tomatoes: 14 <br>
Metacritic: 39 <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>New on DVD 
This Week<br>
</strong> <br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Premonition&quot; (Sandra Bullock); 
wait...I'm seeing a vision... it's getting clearer.. hmm.. it seems I'm 
psychic... when I first saw the trailer for this movie I predicted it would 
suck. Guess what, I'm right!!!<br>
<br>

&gt;&gt;&quot; Hills Have

than I...<br>

<br>
Caught up with a few films over the 
past week...<br>
<br>
on DVD... <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Fast Food Nation&quot; 
(Greg Kinnear); TVGal tells me it was quite different from the book.. the first 
hour was great... once Kinnear (one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood 
in my opinion) leaves the film, it slows down to a crawl... watchable though...
<br> <br>
The highlight? Bruce Willis in a 8 minute scene that is just 
terrific...<br>
<br>
The lowlight? The actual footage of slaughterhouse 
brutality of cow-killing... Look, I know where my meat comes from... but this 
is over the top... I almost threw up on my couch.. but yet I still like 
hamburger.. So there...<br>
<br>
Rating (out of 100)<br>
Rotten Tomatoes: 50 
<br>Metacritic: 64 <br>
TVGuy: 50 <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Eragon&quot; 
(Jeremy Irons, John Malkovic); The most generic Fantasy movie ever made. 
Honestly, it's paint by numbers at this point for these films... and it once 
again reminds me how incredibly good the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films 
were....<br>
<br>
...but the special effects involving the dragon were insanely 
well done... so that's something...<br>
<br>
Rating (out of 100)<br>
Rotten 
Tomatoes: 16 <br>
Metacritic: 38 <br>
TVGuy: 36 <br>
<br>
and in a Theater 
(Yes, I actually went to the movies...)<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&quot; Transformers
&quot; (Shia LaBeouf Josh Duhamel, Megan Fox); I had about 3 hours to kill the 
other day and this puppy clocks in at a robust 138 minutes... so despite the 
fact that I had never seen the cartoon and had no real interest in seeing the 
film at all... I plopped down my 4 bucks and gave it a whirl... what did we 
find out??<br>
<br>
1. Josh Duhamel is going to have a very long and prosperous 
career as &quot;That Anonymous Good-Looking Heroic Guy From TV's &quot;Las 
Vegas&quot;... he was surprisingly good...<br>
<br>
2. Shia LaBeouf (honestly, 
worst name ever for a budding movie star?) was funny and charming and heroic 
and really excellent in this role. I guess he's Indiana Jones' son in the 4th 
film Spielberg is helming now... so good for him... sounds like that whole 
&quot;career&quot; thing is going well..<br>
<br>
3. Megan Fox (my new favorite 
name for any person working in Hollywood).... well, I'll just let the photos 
tell the story...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
her doing a little commercial work..... <br>
<br>

...and a promotional still from the film...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I mean... come on.... her 
last name is &quot;Fox&quot; people...<br>
<br>
4. Every shitty cliche or poor 
movie-making decision that Michael Bay has included in all of his previous loud 
noisy films is unfortunately here, from the clueless military chief to a 
simplistic screenplay that could have been written by a 3rd grade English 
class.... in one hour... by hand...<br>
<br>
5. So with a witless director, 
brutal dialogue and spacious plotting what do we have here?<br>
<br>
Well, I 
don't know how to say this... but....<br>
<br>
...it's pretty good. Really. 
Honest.<br>
<br>
How is this possible? Well, other than reasons 1, 2 and 3 
above.. it's pretty simple...<br>
<br>
 The Special Effects are so good I'd go 
so far to call themAstonishing. As in, &quot;Jurassic Park for the time&quot; 
Great...<br>
<br>
Nice to see a witless noisy summer blockbuster actually 
deliver Fun for a change... nice job by all... well, maybe not the 
screenwriter....<br>
<br>
Rating (out of 100) <br>
Rotten Tomatoes: 57 <br>

Metacritic: 60 <br>
TVGuy: 62 <br>
<br>
and with that, off to Grand Junction 
for the weekend, then to Sin City for work for three days... I'll see you back 
here Wednesday or so... until next time...<br>

<br>
Played Group Trivia with some 
friends last night at our local watering hole... here were a few we missed (the 
solution can be found by dragging your cursor past the word 
&quot;Answer&quot;...)<br>
<br>
Q: Where did Walter Payton attend college? <br>

<br>Answer: Jackson State <br>
<br>
Q: Who was President of the U.S. 
immediately following Abraham Lincoln?<br>
<br>
Answer:  Jackson <br>
<br>
Q:  
On the TV Program &quot;Married with Children&quot;, what female hating 
organization did Bundy belong to? <br>
<br>
Answer: No Ma'am <br>
<br>
Other 
than that, pretty much a clean sweep for Team TVGuy... a dominating performance 
which gave us victories in two of the three rounds and First Place overall as 
well... a future giant Wing and Beverage party is forthcoming with our combined 
gift certificate winnings... we're nearing the $100 dollar mark... join us, 
won't you?<br>

<br>
During a taping of one of our sports 
shows today I noted that the 2-year-old of our host that was watching the show 
in the studio had a Visitors Pass filled out and placed on his back.<br>
<br>

Yes, the Security here thought that the 24 month old boy was a threat, and had 
to be identified...<br>
<br>
...damn you al qaeda!!! <br>
<br>
____ <br>
<br>

I've seen people eating waffles with syrup off a plate in their car on the way 
to work.... and I thought that would easily be the strangest thing I'd see in a 
car...<br>
<br>
...until today's horrifying shirt change by a 54 year old woman 
in her front seat...<br>
<br>
...who wasn't wearing any undergarments.... <br>

<br>Yep, so much for the waffles..... <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
I know 
that the &quot;Head On&quot; commercials have been beaten to death by comedy 
programs, newspaper columnists and bloggers everywhere... but I hadn't seen the 
commercial in some time until this morning whilst I was nibbling on my egg 
white veggie omelet at work (how I ever worked in a place without a cafeteria 
I'll never know...)<br>
<br>
During the early morning CNN hours it popped on 
twice... and I was struck by just how ridiculous it still was.... (the 
commercial can be seen at TVGuy Videohere if you need a refresher..) <br>
<br>

Their websiteis here... which is about what I suspected it would be... 
ridiculously simple and contains virtually no information whatsoever...<br>
<br>
As for its abilities to remove your head pain... folks... I hate to break this 
to you...<br>
<br>
...but it's for all intents and purposes a tube of Wax. <br>

<br>Yes, <em>Wax</em>. <br>
<br>
It's a homeopathic product... meaning that the 
active ingredients are diluted to such a degree that for all intents and 
purposes they don't actually exist in the product itself...<br>
<br>
White 
bryony (a type of vine) and potassium dichromate are the two &quot;major&quot; 
ingredients... and they are diluted to .000001 PPM and 1 PPM respectively.<br>

<br>If you aren't grasping how insanely small an amount that is... well, enter 
the TVGuy Scientific Workshop won't you??<br>
<br>
&gt;1. Take an eyedropper... 
<br> <br>
&gt;2. Fill it with your medicine <br>
<br>
&gt;3. Drive to the 
Pacific Ocean.<br>
<br>
&gt;4. Place one drop into the ocean. <br>
<br>
&gt;5. 
Wait 1 year.<br>
<br>
&gt;6. Go back to the ocean and drink 1 drop of water 
from the Ocean.<br>

&gt;7. Congrats, you've just healed yourself! <br>
<br>
(There are some homeopathic solutions with a listed dilution of 200C, which 
mathematically is less than one molecule per all the known matter in the 
universe...<em>effective</em>!) <br>
<br>
So the next time you have a 
headache... do yourself a favor and take an aspirin, okay?<br>
<br>
And by the 
way... if you need to refer to their graphic to find your forehead...<br>

proceeding.. just a thought...<br>

At the grocery 
store the other day I saw a display for the new Diet Pepsi &quot;Max&quot;... 
which is cola with extra caffeine and ginseng...<br>
<br>
How did people 
decades ago get by without these Super Nitroglycerin Energy Boost Beverages 
that are all the rage?? Did people sleep til noon in the 19th Century??<br>
<br>
Anyway... a quick glance down the Pepsi section of the beverage aisle 
revealed....<br>

More July 4th 
photos...<br>
<br>
________ <br>
<br>
From our recent Chicago trip... here's a 
shot of some of the Chicago Skyline looking South from Millennium Park..<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
I thought the red building was kinda strange... <br>
<br>
TV's 
Matt remarked that it was the &quot;Sore Thumb Institute&quot;.... (well done 
Matt...) <br>
<br>
And just in case you were wondering what was the lamest name 
for a boat, well...ever was... have no fear, I quickly snapped a photo to 
ensure its timeless immortality would be preserved right here...<br>
<br>

...before I show the photographic evidence of its supreme lameness... what do 
you think would be the lamest boat name possible in Illinois' biggest city?<br>

<br> &gt;&gt;Lake Michigan? <br>
&gt;&gt;Windy City?? <br>
&gt;&gt;Go Cubs! <br>
&gt;&gt;The Abe Lincoln??? <br>
&gt;&gt;The Softer Side of Sears (Tower)???? 
<br> <br>
Sure, all worthy... but all pale before the idiocy that is.... <br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, Imagination at work there 
isn't it?? What, &quot;Illinois&quot; was taken?<br>
<br>
(Look, I know the 
name of the boat is probably something other than &quot;Chicago&quot;... but if 
you don't want people to think it is.. you damn well put the actual name of the 
boat somewhere.. you know.. on  the boat!! The joke remains...) <br>
<br>
_____ 
<br> <br>
So, something I like to do from time to time is infiltrate upscale 
condos and homes with a colorful backstory and pretend I'm interested in 
purchasing said property... just to get a feel of how &quot;the other 
half&quot; lives... get decorating ideas for the TVGuy Mansion, etc...<br>
<br>

I may have outdone myself in Chicago.... I'll let you be the judge...<br>
<br>

I approached my target building with the purpose of just getting in and taking 
some phtos of Sunrise with the city in the background... the diligent security 
guard would not let me up, even to the workout room...<br>
<br>
so I went to 
Lake Michigan and photographed the Cloud Gate Monument ad nauseum (you'll be 
subjected to it in a future photo series...) and the Navy Pier... but on my way 
back I thought I'd give it another try since it was now acceptable business 
hours...<br>
<br>
I was successful in confusing the new Security Guard (must 
have been a shift change) in getting a key to the workout facility on the 43rd 
floor... and off I went...<br>
<br>
I have to say, if this was the view from my 
workout facility...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
...I might be fit enough to win 
the Tour de France (without steroids!) <br>
<br>
The view from the deck was 
equally nice...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The view from the East standpoint was not 
quite as spectacular... but still... it was the 43rd floor...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>So after taking it all in, I walked over to the elevator lobby and got 
trapped in a conversation with a guy who lived in the building about the merits 
of that particular dwelling... he wouldn't shut up about the &quot;intricate 
fixtures&quot; (what does that mean??) and the great parking!! <br>
<br>

Okay... anyway, I extricated myself from that and was ready to escape the 
building with my photos when I was greeted at the front desk by the Developer 
himself (!) who had heard how interested I was and hoped he could show me 
around personally!!!<br>
<br>
Sigh... okay, since I was busted I agreed to go 
on his &quot;tour&quot;... so up we went to some random units in the higher 
floors...<br>
<br>
Normally I would just play along according to the 
circumstances of the visit... but this guy was particularly offensive.. 20 
seconds into meeting him he insulted anyone who made less than $500,000 a year 
as &quot;ghastly&quot;.. so I decided to go all out in my &quot;role 
play&quot;...<br>
<br>
The following conversational snippets are not 
embellished in any way.. really...<br>
<br>
TVGuy: ( on the way up in the 
elevator) I'd like to see a finished kitchen in a unit.. cooking is very 
important to me...<br>
Real Estate Guy &quot;Bob&quot;: Really? Are you trained 
in any particular discipline? Or do you just not enjoy eating out?<br>
TVGuy: 
Have you heard of the meat product &quot;SPAM&quot;?<br>
Bob: Yes, but I've 
never...<br>
TVGuy: My father invented it... processed meats are very important 
to my family...<br>
Bob: ( momentarily speechless) Well.. our kitchens are very 
state-of-the...<br>
TVGuy: If they aren't acceptable to me, a 2nd generation 
SPAM heir, then I doubt that we'll be here very long...<br>
<br>
<br>
Moments 
later.. in the first unit he was showing me...<br>
<br>
TVGuy: So, this is the 
kitchen?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bob: Yes, this is the kitchen... the cabinets 
are...<br>
TVGuy: I'm assuming they are Eucalyptus wood, which is standard in 
buildings of this ilk (I'd never used the word &quot;Ilk&quot; before... I was 
pretty proud of myself at this point...) <br>
Bob: Umm... I'm not sure of the 
material, but I can call the builder personally at home and...<br>
TVGuy: It's 
irrelevant... take me to the deck... where my parties will be held...<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
( admittedly this building is pretty 
sweet.. but for $645,000 it should be...I was about to let him off the hook but 
this nugget popped out next..) <br>
<br>
Bob: This building is predominately 
Caucasian.. which I assume would be to your liking... none of &quot;their 
music&quot; that can ruin an evening...<br>
TVGuy: ( pausing to contemplate 
what was just said...) ..Yes... I despise &quot;their music&quot;... especially 
anything that mentions a &quot;booty&quot;...<br>
Bob: Yes, I hate... 
&quot;booty&quot; as well.. <br>
TVGuy: ( chuckling inwardly): I have seen 
enough here.. take me to another of your luxury condominiums immediately...<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
TVGuy: ( arriving at new condo)... well... this kitchen 
Clearly is equipped with Eucalyptus cabinetry (even though to me it looked 
exactly the same)... you do accept Cash at closing don't you?? My father 
doesn't like to finance anything.. unless it's a boat... and my fiance hates 
dealing with paperwork...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Bob: 
(momentarily stunned..) Umm.. yes, Cash is acceptable... I didn't know you were 
engaged.. Congratulations! When's the wedding?<br>
TVGuy: Well, one of her 
friends is in legal trouble right now.. so we have to finish that before we can 
go ahead with the wedding plans.. I assume they'll be in Monte Carlo... I've 
told her it can be anywhere she wants...<br>
B ob: ( seeing huge dollar signs 
in his eyes ..) I hope the legal trouble isn't too serious... <br>
TVGuy: No., 
the Hilton family has fantastic legal counsel... I expect Paris to be out of 
jail anytime now...<br>
Bob: ( gulping) Paris Hilton? That's your fiance's 
friend?<br>
TVGuy: Unfortunately.. I assume we'll have to invite the entire 
Hilton family to the festivities... and since they are friends with the 
Trumps... god, we'll have to invite them as well.. I know they are looking in 
Chicago for a place to lay over on flights.. I'll give them your card.. you do 
have a card, don't you??<br>
Bob: Yes.. er... of course.. it may be down in my 
office... perhaps on our way out...<br>
TVGuy: Whatever... I've seen what I 
need to... I'm prepared to sign some documents... I assume they are ready down 
in your financial office...<br>
Bob: Er.. well, no... we'll have to... <br>

TVGuy: I see.. I'll be back here with my fiance on Saturday... will you have 
your lawyers be here then to smooth out any difficulties? I don't enjoy my 
Aston-Martin to be parked just anywhere... (It's important to note at this 
point that I'm dressed in a 12 dollar t-shirt and Eddie Bauer shorts with Nike 
Tennis shoes...) <br>
Bob: Of course.,... why don't you give me a number that I 
can reach you at to set everything up to your satisfaction and...<br>
TVGuy: 
Don't insult me.. I'll have my representatives call you... I hope it's not a 
problem if I buy 2 or more units at the same time.. I don't like to dawdle (
Clearly at this point the Academy Award is mine... even I can't believe 
myself...) <br>
Bob: ( elevator opens); Let me get you my card Mr... what was 
your name again?<br>
TVGuy: Varnson.. Kel Varnson... ( hoping he isn't a 
Seinfeld fan...) You can reach me at Trump Tower in New York starting 
tomorrow... I'll have my secretary call you this afternoon with details..<br>

Bob: Let me get you my card then... <br>
TVGuy: That won't be necessary... 
&quot;Bob&quot;... I'll contactyou.. Good Day... ( walks out of building...) 
<br> <br>
I may never do this again.. clearly I don't think I can top this... 
but wherever there is a &quot;Bob&quot; out there to be scolded verbally... 
TVGuy will not rest...<br>
<br>
..until next time... <br>

<br>Salma: Hello, I'm Salma Hayek. The movie &quot;Chicago&quot; is nominated 
for 13 Academy Awards. But, let's look at the facts. &quot;Chicago&quot; is 
only 113 minutes long, while other nominated movies - for example, 
&quot;Frida&quot; - is 118 minutes long. What's the matter, 
&quot;Chicago&quot;? Couldn't you come up with five more minutes?<br>
