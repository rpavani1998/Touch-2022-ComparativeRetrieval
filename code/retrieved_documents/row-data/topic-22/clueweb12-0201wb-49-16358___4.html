<h1>Why Word-of-Mouth Works Wonders</h1> <br>

<p>Home &gt; Promote &gt; Marketing &gt; Viral Marketing</p> 
<p>by Michel Fortin</p> 
<p> Viral marketing is the process of implementing means through which the 
knowledge of your existence self-propagates. Like a virus, your visibility 
spreads throughout a network of people who refer you to each other. Unlike 
unsolicited advertisements (such as &quot;spam&quot;), which stops once it 
reaches its destination (and the reason spammers must keep spamming in order to 
remain successful), viral marketing continues to spread almost effortlessly 
since the people who refer you to others know each other. In addition, those 
who get to know you or know about you through third party referrals grant you a 
higher level of confidence, credibility, and loyalty.</p> 
<p> This &quot;word-of-mouth&quot; advertising is crucial in the offline 
world. But referral or network marketing, to which it is commonly referred, is 
also priceless on the Web. They say that the key to marketing success in the 
offline world is &quot;location, location, location.&quot; On the Internet it's 
no different. In other words, your marketing success depends highly on the 
number of locations you appear -- places on which your site, link, company 
name, or product name exist. In essence, it is to be in as many places as 
possible, talked about by as many people as possible, and seen by as many 
eyeballs as possible.</p> 
<p> Remember an old dictum a mentor of mine once told me, which is: 
&quot;Implication is more powerful than specification.&quot; In other words, if 
you tell people you're the best, that you're the leader in your field, or that 
your product is the best solution to their needs, your self-serving promotional 
bias can be instantly recognized. Your statement smacks of being untrue and is 
rarely believable at face value. And if you do make such claims, you will then 
have your work cut out for you in order to prove them.</p> 
<p> However, if someone that you know says to a friend, relative, associate, 
or acquaintance that you are indeed the best or that you do have the solution 
to their problems, how much more believable will that person's statement be? 
Statistically, the answer is much more. Therefore, word-of-mouth, referrals, 
and networking systems are not only important because they create an awareness 
of your business (or for creating traffic, in the online world), but also 
important to the degree to which third party marketing indirectly communicates 
your superiority and the value of the products or services you offer. In his 
new book (which I highly recommend) &quot;The 22 Immutable Laws of 
Branding,&quot; Al Ries stresses the importance of leadership and how that 
leadership is communicated. According to Ries, people never buy the best -- 
even if they think or say that they do. They usually buy the leader (or what 
they perceive as being the best). And that perception is often molded by what 
they are told and by what others do, not by what is fact or by what is being 
advertised.</p> 
<p> Coke, for example, outsells Pepsi. But according to Ries, taste tests 
conducted by both Coke and Pepsi reveal that Pepsi is the better tasting brand. 
So, why does Coke still beat Pepsi in sales? It is not because it is the leader 
in the marketplace or promoted itself as such but because it is *known* as the 
leader.</p> 
<p> Coke was the first cola &quot;in the mind&quot; of the marketplace and 
thus the one most talked about, even to this day. When a person is introduced 
to cola for the first time, he or she is often told to try Coke. People in 
restaurants still refer to the word &quot;coke&quot; as the generic name for 
colas even when the restaurant only serves Pepsi. Why is that? It's because, 
while other colas are bombarding them with marketing messages, people have 
heard of Coke first and most likely from other people. That's the power of 
word-of-mouth advertising.</p> 
<p> Consequently, if your business or Web site is unique, focuses on a niche, 
or is the first in some category, the knowledge of your existence will spread 
almost naturally. But creating specific systems and using specific tools that 
will leverage the spreading of that message helps to multiply your marketing 
punch exponentially. Such tools help to stimulate word-of-mouth advertising, 
which is more effective than general advertising. For along with communicating 
your existence to the world, word-of-mouth advertising helps to cast that aura 
of leadership and superiority.</p> 
<p> Networking systems, for example, include strategic marketing alliances, 
joint ventures, and affiliate programs. Online, they are often called referral 
traffic generators. And, unlike the more traditional traffic generators such as 
banners and search engines, these specific tools are much more effective since 
they are used by third parties and not by the original advertiser.</p> 
<p> In fact, referral traffic generators are key ingredients of online 
success. A great example is a referral service like the one recently launched 
by my associates at &quot;Internet Marketing Challenge&quot; -- the publishers 
of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; e-zine of which I am the editor. This new service 
is based on this viral marketing concept (for a sample, please visit
success-doctor.com/referral.htm). </p> 
<p> Nevertheless, if you received a call, letter, or e-mail from someone you 
know referring you to a particular company, how much more credible will that 
referral be when compared to a blatant advertisement coming from the company 
itself? You got it. Much more. </p> <br>
