<br> Coca-Cola and its Evolution The Coca-Cola company started out as an 
insignificant one man business and over the last one hundred and ten years it 
has grown into one of the largest companies in the world. The first operator of 
the company was Dr. John Pemberton and the current operator is Roberto 
Goizueta. Without societies help, Coca-Cola could not have become over a 50 
billion dollar business. Coca-Cola was invented by Dr. John Pemberton, an 
Atlanta pharmacist. He concocted the formula in a three legged brass kettle in 
his backyard on May 8, 1886. He mixed a combination of lime, cinnamon, coca 
leaves, and the seeds of a Brazilian shrub to make the fabulous beverage(Things 
go better with Coke 14). Coca-Cola debuted in Atlanta's largest pharmacy, 
Jacob's Pharmacy, as a five cent non- carbonated beverage. Later on, the 
carbonated water was added to the syrup to make the beverage that we know today 
as Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola was originally used as a nerve and brain tonic and a 
medical elixir. Coca-Cola was named by Frank Robinson, one of Pemberton's close 
friends, he also penned the famous Coca-Cola logo in unique script. Dr. John 
Pemberton sold a portion of the Coca-Cola company to Asa Candler, after 
Pemberton's death the remainder was sold to Candler. Pemberton was forced to 
sell because he was in a state of poor health and was in debt. He had paid 
$76.96 for advertising, but he only made $50.00 in profits. Candler acquired 
the whole company for $2,300(Coca-Cola multiple pages). Candler achieved a lot 
during his time as owner of the company. On January 31, 1893, the famous 
Coca-Cola formula was patented. He also opened the first syrup manufacturing 
plant in 1884. His great achievement was large scale bottling of Coca-Cola in 
1899. In 1915, The Root Glass Company made the contour bottle for the Coca-Cola 
company. Candler aggressively advertised Coca-Cola in newspapers and on 
billboards. In the newspapers, he would give away coupons for a free Coke at 
any fountain. Coca-Cola was sold after the Prohibition Era to Ernest Woodruff 
for 25 million dollars. He gave Coca-Cola to his son, Robert Woodruff, who 
would be president for six decades(Facts, Figures, and Features Multiple 
pages). Robert Woodruff was an influential man in Atlanta because of his 
contributions to area colleges, universities, businesses and organizations. 
When he made a contribution, he would never leave his name, this is how he 
became to be known as Mr. Anonymous. Woodruff introduced the six bottle carton 
in 1923. He also made Coca-Cola available through vending machine in 1929, that 
same year, the Coca- Cola bell glass was made available. He started advertising 
on the radio in the 1930s and on the television in 1950. Currently Coca-Cola is 
advertised on over five hundred TV channels around the world. In 1931, he 
introduced the Coke Santa as a Christmas promotion and it caught on. Candler 
also introduced the twelve ounce Coke can in 1960. The Coca-Cola contour bottle 
was patented in 1977. The two liter bottle was introduced in 1978, the same 
year the company also introduced plastic bottles(Coca-Cola multiple pages). 
Woodruff did have one dubious distinction, he raised the syrup prices for 
distributors. But he improved efficiency at every step of the manufacturing 
process. Woodruff also increased productivity by improving the sales 
department, emphasizing quality control, and beginning large-scale advertising 
and promotional campaigns. Woodruff made Coke available in every state of the 
Union through the soda fountain. For all of these achievements he earned the 
name, The Boss(Facts, Figures, and Features Multiple pages). In 1985, the 
Coca-Cola Company made what has been known as one of the biggest marketing 
blunder. The Coca-Cola company stumbled onto the new formula in efforts to 
produce diet Coke. They put forth 4 million dollars of research to come up with 
the new formula. The decision to change their formula and pull the old Coke off 
the market came about because taste tests showed a distinct preference for the 
new formula. The new formula was a sweeter variation with less tang, it was 
also slightly smoother(Demott 54). Robert Woodruff's death was a large 
contributor to the change because he stated that he would never change 
Coca-Cola's formula. Another factor that influenced the change was that Coke's 
market share fell 2.5 percent in four years. Each percentage point lost or gain 
meant 200 million dollars. A financial analyst said, Coke's market share fell 
from 24.3 percent in 1980 to 21.8 percent in 1984(Things go better with Coke 
14). This was the first flavor change since the existence of the Coca- Cola 
company. The change was announced April 23, 1985 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater 
at the Lincoln Center. Some two hundred TV and newspaper reporters attended 
this very glitzy announcement. It included a question and answer session, a 
history of Coca-Cola, and many other elements(Oliver 131). The debut was 
accompanied by an advertising campaign that revived the Coca-Cola theme song of 
the early 1970s, I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke(Say it ain't so, Coke 24). 
The Jingle read like this: I'd like to teach the world to sing In perfect 
harmony. I'd like to buy the world a Coke And keep it company. The change to 
the world's best selling soft drink was heard by 81 percent of the United 
States population within twenty-four hours of the announcement. Within a week 
of the change, one thousand calls a day were flooding the company's eight 
hundred number (1-800-GET-COKE). Most of the callers were shocked and/or 
outraged, many said that they were considering switching to Pepsi. Within six 
weeks, the eight hundred number was being jammed by six thousand calls a day. 
The company also fielded over forty thousand letters, which were all answered 
and each person got a coupon for the new Coke. A retired Air Force officer, 
explained in a letter to the Coca-Cola company that he wanted to be cremated 
and interred in a Coke can, but now that this change had come about he was 
reconsidering(Pendergrast Multiple pages). Sharlotte Donneally, a thirty-six 
year old anthropologist said, I hate the new stuff(Demott 60). Wendy Koskela, a 
thirty-five year old vice president of an insurance company said, It's too 
sweet. It tastes like Pepsi. She also stated, Real Coke had punch. This taste 
almost like it's flat(Demott 60). Many American consumers of Coca-Cola asked if 
they would have the final say. When Pepsi heard that the Coca-Cola company was 
changing its secret formula they said that it was a decision that Pepsi tastes 
better. Roger Enrico, the president and CEO of Pepsi-Cola wrote a letter to 
every major newspaper in the U.S. to declare the victory, the letter read like 
this(Oliver 128): It gives me great pleasure to offer each of you my heartiest 
congratulations. After eighty-seven years of going at it eyeball to eyeball, 
the other guy just blinked. Coca-Cola is withdrawing their product from the 
marketplace, and is reformulating brand Coke to be more like Pepsi...There is 
no question the long-term market success of Pepsi has forced this move...Maybe 
they finally realized what most of us have known for years, Pepsi tastes better 
than Coke. Well, people in trouble tend to do desperate things...and we'll have 
to keep our eye on them. But for now, I say, victory is sweet, and we have 
earned a celebration. We're going to declare a holiday on Friday. Enjoy! Best 
Regards, Roger Enrico President, CEO Pepsi-Cola USA Coca-Cola officials said, 
The new formula will boost Coke's share by 1 percent. That is worth 200 million 
dollars a year. Coca-Cola management had to decide: Do nothing or buy the world 
a new Coke(Things go better with Coke 14). They decided to develop the new 
formula. Roberto Goizueta, the president of the Coca-Cola Company stated, The 
old Coke formula, with its secret flavoring ingredient, called Merchandise 7X, 
will stay locked in the Trust Company of Georgia bank vault in Atlanta, never 
to be used again(Demott et. al 55). This is what many Coke officials said, This 
is the most significant soft drink development in the company's history(Demott 
et. al 54). The change back to the old Coke was known as the Second Coming. 
Roberto Goizueta said, Today, we have two messages to deliver to the American 
consumer, first, to those of you who are drinking Coca-Cola with its great new 
taste, our thanks...But there is a second group of consumers to whom we want to 
speak to today and our message to this group is simple: We have heard 
you(Oliver 178). On July 10, 1985, eighty-seven days after the new Coke was 
introduced, the old Coke was brought back in addition to the new one. This was 
greatly due to dropping market share and consumer protest. The market share 
fell from a high of 15 percent to a low of 1.4 percent(Miller 38). Roberto 
Goizueta and Donald Keough took full blame for this failed product launch. Don 
Keough, Coca-Cola president, said in response to the comeback, The truth is we 
are not dumb and we are not that smart(New bottle 18). Roberto Goizueta's 
response when the change about, We have heard you(Moore 8). This was said to be 
a classic marketing retreat. Coca-Cola executives admitted that they had goofed 
by taking the old Coke off the market. One old Coke loyalist said, The company 
had spoiled the taste of its ninety nine year old soft drink and betrayed a 
national trust(Moore 8). Ike Herbert, a Coke marketer said, You would have 
thought we had invented a cure for cancer(Pendergrast 366). The Coca- Cola 
company's eight hundred number received eighteen thousand calls of gratitude. 
One caller said they felt like a lost friend had returned home. The comeback of 
old Coke drove stock prices to the highest level in twelve years. This was said 
to be the only way to regain the lead on the cola wars(Classic comeback of an 
old champ 12). In 1979, fifteen hundred employees moved to the new corporate 
headquarters in Atlanta located on North Avenue. The new corporate headquarters 
came to be known as The Tower. During the time when the research for the new 
formula was taking place, it was known as The Bunker(Oliver 53). The known 
ingredients in present day Coca-Cola are water. caffeine, phosphoric acid, 
vanilla, various oils and essences and extracts of the coca leaf and the kola 
nut. The one in four hundred part of cocaine was removed from Coca-Cola in 
1903(Demott 54). Five years after the infamous Coke fiasco, the Coca-Cola 
company tried to bring back the reformulated Coke. The effort to phase in Coke 
II into the soda market was quite unsuccessful(Miller 38). During the Woodruff 
era, Mr. Woodruff made a promise to the armed forces of the United States to 
supply Coca-Cola to every serviceperson. He said that costs and location did 
not matter, he supplied 5 billion bottles to the service. In the mid-1970's, 
more than half Coca-Cola sold was outside of the U.S. Coca-Cola products 
outsell closest competitor by more than two to one. One in every two colas and 
one in every three soft drinks is a Coca-Cola product(Facts, Figures, and 
Features 16). The best known trademark in the world is sold in about one 
hundred and forty countries to 5.8 billion people in eighty different 
languages. This is why Coca-Cola is the largest soft drink company in the 
world. Coca-Cola is worth more than 58 billion dollars on the stock 
market(Coca-Cola, The Coca-Cola Company 232). For more than 65 years, Coca-Cola 
has been a sponsor of the Olympics. The 1996 Summer Olympics will be held in 
Atlanta, Georgia, the home of Coca-Cola. One great earmark that the Coca-Cola 
company has is helping the people of Atlanta. They accomplish this through 
scholarships, hotlines, donations and contributions, etc. Another large 
accomplishment that the Coca-Cola has, is being the first company to make and 
use recycled plastic bottles. One way to see all of the achievements of the 
Coca- Cola company is to visit the World of Coke in Atlanta. It houses a 
collection of memorabilia, samples of the products, exhibits, and many other 
exciting items(Facts, Figures, and Features Multiple pages). All of what has 
been said is the basis of what Coca-Cola was built on. Without societies help, 
Coca-Cola could not have become over a 50 billion dollar business. Keep on 
consuming the world's favorite soft drink, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola and its

has been known as one of the biggest marketing blunder. The Coca-Cola company 
stumbled onto the new formula in efforts to produce diet Coke. They put forth 4 
million dollars of research to come up with the new formula. The decision to 
change their formula and pull the old Coke off the market came about because 
taste tests showed a distinct preference for the new formula. The new formula 
was a sweeter variation with less tang, it was also slightly smoother(Demott 
54). Robert Woodruff's death was a large contributor to the change because he 
stated that he would never change Coca-Cola's formula. Another factor that 
influenced the change was that Coke's market share fell 2.5 percent in four 
years. Each percentage point lost or gain meant 200 million dollars. A 
financial analyst said, Coke's market share fell from 24.3 percent in 1980 to 
21.8 percent in 1984(Things go better with Coke 14). This was the first flavor 
change since the existence of the Coca- Cola company. The change was announced 
April 23, 1985 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at the Lincoln Center. Some two 
hundred TV and newspaper reporters attended this very glitzy announcement. It 
included a question and answer session, a history of Coca-Cola, and many other 
elements(Oliver 131). The debut was accompanied by an advertising campaign that 
revived the Coca-Cola theme song of the early 1970s, I'd Like to Buy the World 
a Coke(Say it ain't so, Coke 24). The Jingle read like this: I'd like to teach 
the world to sing In perfect harmony. I'd like to buy the world a Coke And keep 
it company. The change to the world's best selling soft drink was heard by 81 
percent of the United States population within twenty-four hours of the 
announcement. Within a week of the change, one thousand calls a day were 
flooding the company's eight hundred number (1-800-GET-COKE). Most of the 
callers were shocked and/or outraged, many said that they were considering 
switching to Pepsi. Within six weeks, the eight hundred number was being jammed 
by six thousand calls a day. The company also fielded over forty thousand 
letters, which were all answered and each person got a coupon for the new Coke. 
A retired Air Force officer, explained in a letter to the Coca-Cola company 
that he wanted to be cremated and interred in a Coke can, but now that this 
change had come about he was reconsidering(Pendergrast Multiple pages). 
Sharlotte Donneally, a thirty-six year old anthropologist said, I hate the new 
stuff(Demott 60). Wendy Koskela, a thirty-five year old vice president of an 
insurance company said, It's too sweet. It tastes like Pepsi. She also stated, 
Real Coke had punch. This taste almost like it's flat(Demott 60). Many American 
consumers of Coca-Cola asked if they would have the final say. When Pepsi heard 
that the Coca-Cola company was changing its secret formula they said that it 
was a decision that Pepsi tastes better. Roger Enrico, the president and CEO of 
Pepsi-Cola wrote a letter to every major newspaper in the U.S. to declare the 
victory, the letter read like this(Oliver 128): It gives me great pleasure to 
offer each of you my heartiest congratulations. After eighty-seven years of 
going at it eyeball to eyeball, the other guy just blinked. Coca-Cola is 
withdrawing their product from the marketplace, and is reformulating brand Coke 
to be more like Pepsi...There is no question the long-term market success of 
Pepsi has forced this move...Maybe they finally realized what most of us have 
known for years, Pepsi tastes better than Coke. Well, people in trouble tend to 
do desperate things...and we'll have to keep our eye on them. But for now, I 
say, victory is sweet, and we have earned a celebration. We're going to declare 
a holiday on Friday. Enjoy! Best Regards, Roger Enrico President, CEO 
Pepsi-Cola USA Coca-Cola officials said, The new formula will boost Coke's 
share by 1 percent. That is worth 200 million dollars a year. Coca-Cola 
management had to decide: Do nothing or buy the world a new Coke(Things go 
better with Coke 14). They decided to develop the new formula. Roberto 
Goizueta, the president of the Coca-Cola Company stated, The old Coke formula, 
with its secret flavoring ingredient, called Merchandise 7X, will stay locked 
in the Trust Company of Georgia bank vault in Atlanta, never to be used 
again(Demott et. al 55). This is what many Coke officials said, This is the 
most significant soft drink development in the company's history(Demott et. al 
54). The change back to the old Coke was known as the Second Coming. Roberto 
Goizueta said, Today, we have two messages to deliver to the American consumer, 
first, to those of you who are drinking Coca-Cola with its great new taste, our 
thanks...But there is a second group of consumers to whom we want to speak to 
today and our message to this group is simple: We have heard you(Oliver 178). 
On July 10, 1985, eighty-seven days after the new Coke was introduced, the old 
Coke was brought back in addition to the new one. This was greatly due to 
dropping market share and consumer protest. The market share fell from a high 
of 15 percent to a low of 1.4 percent(Miller 38). Roberto Goizueta and Donald 
Keough took full blame for this failed product launch. Don Keough, Coca-Cola 
president, said in response to the comeback, The truth is we are not dumb and 
we are not that smart(New bottle 18). Roberto Goizueta's response when the 
change about, We have heard you(Moore 8). This was said to be a classic 
marketing retreat. Coca-Cola executives admitted that they had goofed by taking 
the old Coke off the market. One old Coke loyalist said, The company had 
spoiled the taste of its ninety nine year old soft drink and betrayed a 
national trust(Moore 8). Ike Herbert, a Coke marketer said, You would have 
thought we had invented a cure for cancer(Pendergrast 366). The Coca- Cola 
company's eight hundred number received eighteen thousand calls of gratitude. 
One caller said they felt like a lost friend had returned home. The comeback of 
old Coke drove stock prices to the highest level in twelve years. This was said 
to be the only way to regain the lead on the cola wars(Classic comeback of an 
old champ 12). In 1979, fifteen hundred employees moved to the new corporate 
headquarters in Atlanta located on North Avenue. The new corporate headquarters 
came to be known as The Tower. During the time when the research for the new 
formula was taking place, it was known as The Bunker(Oliver 53). The known 
ingredients in present day Coca-Cola are water. caffeine, phosphoric acid, 
vanilla, various oils and essences and extracts of the coca leaf and the kola 
nut. The one in four hundred part of cocaine was removed from Coca-Cola in 
1903(Demott 54). Five years after the infamous Coke fiasco, the Coca-Cola 
company tried to bring back the reformulated Coke. The effort to phase in Coke 
II into the soda market was quite unsuccessful(Miller 38). During the Woodruff 
era, Mr. Woodruff made a promise to the armed forces of the United States to 
supply Coca-Cola to every serviceperson. He said that costs and location did 
not matter, he supplied 5 billion bottles to the service. In the mid-1970's, 
more than half Coca-Cola sold was outside of the U.S. Coca-Cola products 
outsell closest competitor by more than two to one. One in every two colas and 
one in every three soft drinks is a Coca-Cola product(Facts, Figures, and 
Features 16). The best known trademark in the world is sold in about one 
hundred and forty countries to 5.8 billion people in eighty different 
languages. This is why Coca-Cola is the largest soft drink company in the 
world. Coca-Cola is worth more than 58 billion dollars on the stock 
market(Coca-Cola, The Coca-Cola Company 232). For more than 65 years, Coca-Cola 
has been a sponsor of the Olympics. The 1996 Summer Olympics will be held in 
Atlanta, Georgia, the home of Coca-Cola. One great earmark that the Coca-Cola 
company has is helping the people of Atlanta. They accomplish this through 
scholarships, hotlines, donations and contributions, etc. Another large 
accomplishment that the Coca-Cola has, is being the first company to make and 
use recycled plastic bottles. One way to see all of the achievements of the 
Coca- Cola company is to visit the World of Coke in Atlanta. It houses a 
collection of memorabilia, samples of the products, exhibits, and many other 
exciting items(Facts, Figures, and Features Multiple pages). All of what has 
been said is the basis of what Coca-Cola was built on. Without societies help, 
Coca-Cola could not have become over a 50 billion dollar business. Keep on 
consuming the world's favorite soft drink, Coca-Cola. Word Count: 6183<br>
