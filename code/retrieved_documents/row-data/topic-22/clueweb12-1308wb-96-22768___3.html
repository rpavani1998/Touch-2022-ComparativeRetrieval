<h4>Is There Value to Developing a Brand for the CFP Marks?</h4> 
<p>Many planners report that the primary reason their clients choose to work 
with them is a foundation of trust built with that individual client, which 
subsequently blossoms forth into a bona fide planner-client relationship. 
Accordingly, many planners have recently begun to ask: why the CFP Board fee 
increase to support public awareness of the CFP marks, if that&rsquo;s not how 
clients select their planners anyway?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Amongst the various messages posted on the Financial Planning magazine 
discussion forums (you can view the two separate threads here and here) 
regarding the recent CFP Board announcement that it isconsidering an 80% fee 
increase to help fund a public awareness campaign for the CFP marks, a common 
theme began to emerge. To paraphrase it, the assertion was &ldquo;I have never 
had a client state that they chose to work with me because of my CFP 
certification. They choose to work with me because of my individual 
trustworthiness, credibility, and ability to deliver the guidance they need. So 
what&rsquo;s the point of big fee increase, especially when it&rsquo;s going to 
fund something that isn&rsquo;t relevant in the decision-making process when 
individuals select a financial planner anyway?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Certainly, I won&rsquo;t deny that the ability to communicate effectively 
with prospective clients and to inculcate a trust relationship is crucial to an 
individual&rsquo;s decision-making process about who to work with for financial 
guidance. But I think to also imply that people don&rsquo;t find the CFP marks 
relevant in the decision-making process &ndash; especially because they 
don&rsquo;t ask questions about the CFP marks or state that they were a factor 
in initial client meetings &ndash; is to ignore the powerful reality that is 
&ldquo;branding.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Branding is an often misunderstood phenomenon; in part, I think 
that&rsquo;s because we as financial planners are not trained in marketing, but 
more significantly I think it&rsquo;s because, as research on branding itself 
ironically shows, we are often not even aware of the impact that branding is 
actually having on our own decision-making process. Nonetheless, the impact is 
there, and it&rsquo;s significant. In perhaps one of the most infamous examples 
(at least in the world of marketing and branding), think back to the popular 
Coke versus Pepsi taste tests that have occurred over the past few decades. In 
the initial version, Coke conducted an extensive series of taste tests where 
consumers were presented with a can of Coke and a can of Pepsi, tasted each 
one, and reported which one tasted better; the majority of consumers chose 
Coke. In response, Pepsi initiated the so-called &ldquo;Pepsi Challenge&rdquo; 
where consumers were given two unidentified soft drinks (one Coke, one Pepsi), 
were instructed to try each and report which one they liked better, and 
after-the-fact found out which one they had chosen. In the Pepsi Challenge 
blind-taste-test version, a significant majority now chose Pepsi as the drink 
of choice. These are some pretty astounding results. When consumers saw which 
drink they were consuming, they chose Coke. If they didn&rsquo;t know which was 
Coke and which was Pepsi, though, they chose Pepsi. And what accounted for the 
difference? In a word: branding.</p> 
<p>In more recent research replicating these results, scientists have actually 
shown using neurological imaging scans that the brain actually responds 
differently to a blind-taste-test version of Coke, than a version of Coke where 
the subject sees and knows that it&rsquo;s Coke. In essence, the Coke brand 
&ndash; and the way our brain processes it &ndash; is so powerful, that we 
literally, biochemically and physiologically, enjoy Coke more when we can see 
and associate the Coke brand with the beverage that we are drinking. In other 
words &ndash; at least as far as the research is concerned &ndash; Pepsi 
actually &ldquo;tastes&rdquo; better than Coke, but doesn&rsquo;t taste as good 
as Coke plus Coke&rsquo;s brand value (or viewed another way,Coke has a 
stronger brand than Pepsi and as a result influences people's opinions of which 
soda tastes better - good thing they have a strong branding campaign!).</p> 
<p>So not only does the impact of a solid brand have an incredible impact 
&ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t just affect our choice, it actually changes the<i>
experience</i>itself to be more positive when we can associate a good brand 
with the product or service we&rsquo;re consuming!!! &ndash; but it is equally 
important to note that we are generally completely unaware of this phenomenon 
(and as discussed ina previous post in this blog, we are often remarkably 
oblivious of the actual factors that influenced and led to a decision that we 
made). In this context,<i>no one </i>who consumed Coke in the taste test <i>ever
</i>stated &ldquo;I think the Pepsi tastes better, but I prefer Coke because I 
just think it&rsquo;s a better brand.&rdquo; Yet as the research shows, 
consumers<i>did </i>choose Coke in large part <i>because </i>of its brand, and 
actually enjoyed the taste of Coke more as a result. But again, they were 
completely unaware of the impact that branding was having on them. Nonetheless, 
if consumers drink Coke but don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s Coke &ndash; or worse, 
see it presented as some never-heard-of &ldquo;no name&rdquo; cola drink 
&ndash; they prefer Pepsi instead.</p> 
<p>In the context of the CFP marks, this leads us to several important 
conclusions. The first is that, even if people are being affected by what 
limited branding exists already with respect to the CFP marks, they are almost 
certainly unaware that the CFP marks influenced their decision (and to say the 
least, will not likely<i>say </i>that the CFP marks were a factor in making the 
choice). Second, to the extent that very limited branding has been done in the 
past, it may in fact be true that the CFP marks are rarely a factor in the 
decision-making process; but this is not because branding doesn&rsquo;t matter, 
it&rsquo;s because the branding hasn&rsquo;t actually been done enough to have 
a broad reaching impact in the first place! In addition, it is notable that in 
support of the CFP Board&rsquo;s own pre-research (see their extensive 
discussion in thisCFP Board Certificant Connection video) in considering the 
public awareness initiative, they conducted significant focus-group marketing 
research, and their results indicated that in fact, the value and virtues of 
the CFP marks are so significant that consumers actually<i>do</i> state that 
the marks would be a material factor in their decision-making process. However, 
the focus-group research showed that the marks can only be a factor 
if/when/once the consumer actually becomes familiar with the ethics, 
experience, education, and examination requirements that the marks entail. In 
other words, the research further shows that until there is awareness, the CFP 
marks are not a factor; but once there is awareness, the CFP marks become an 
important (albeit still not the only) conscious factor in choosing an advisor, 
not to mention any subconscious branding impact.</p> 
<p>So the bottom line is that the research &ndash; both with respect to 
branding overall, and the value of the marks in particular given their rigor 
&ndash; indicates that public awareness of the requirements for CFP 
certification and branding of the CFP marks really does have value, at least to 
the extent that the marketing/advertising efforts themselves are delivered 
properly and effectively. And the fact that the typical planner experience 
suggests the CFP marks are not a part of the client decision-making process are 
not necessarily a contradiction of this, since people are generally unaware of 
the impact that branding has on their own decisions, and in reality there 
really isn&rsquo;t very much branding for the CFP marks in the eyes of the 
public in the first place.</p> 
<p>Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily address whether the CFP Board has 
the right price-tag on their public awareness campaign, whether this is the 
&ldquo;right&rdquo; time for a fee increase, whether they can reach a 
sufficient audience to have impact, or many of the other issues regarding the 
debate on the proposed fee increase that have beendiscussed previously in this 
blog, as well as whether the CFP Board is even the right choice to 
&quot;champion&quot; the cause. Nonetheless, when it comes to the fundamental 
question of whether there is value itself in having more public awareness of 
the CFP marks for advancing the delivery of financial planning by CFP 
professionals, the answer appears to be &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; most definitely.</p> 
<p>So what do you think? Does financial planning and the CFP certification 
need to get onto the public awareness bandwagon and develop its value as a 
brand? Or are you still unconvinced?</p>  Posted by Michael Kitces at 14:34 |

 Well done Michael. You did 
address my comment before I posted it, but to answer your question, I'm still 
not convinced.<br>
<br>
 I don't believe they will be able to create a powerful 
enough &quot;brand&quot; to justify the cost. I don't believe in brand 
marketing. I think all marketing expenses should be measured against results. 
In these situations WE write a blank check to a marketing firm with absolutely 
no way to track the results. We would never do this with our clients' money yet 
we are doing it with ours.<br>
<br>
 On a side note, did you read Blink? I 
think in that book Gladwell talked about the Coke/Pepsi taste test. He 
attributed it to a sip verses drinking a whole glass. After a whole glass the 
results were opposite, if I remember right. Interesting, regardless #1  Chuck

 Chuck, <br>
 It's worth 
noting that the CFP Board's public awareness campaign is not an offering of $9 
million per year with zero metrics.<br>
<br>
 In point of fact, they are 
outlining multiple metrics to evaluate results, and one of the reasons that the 
CFP Board chose Arnold Advertising is for their strong reputation in the 
advertising industry for delivering MEASURABLE results (which means both that 
measurable change happened, and that they create metrics to measure and affirm 
that change).<br>
<br>
 Granted, they are still sorting out some of the exact 
metrics details that will be used, because the reality is that the campaign 
itself is still in the design phases.<br>
<br>
 But the board of directors, and 
CFP Board staff, have been very clear that there is a huge focus on delivering 
measurable results. This isn't just throwing $9+ million at a black hole with 
no plan or intention of evaluating whether it did anything.<br>
