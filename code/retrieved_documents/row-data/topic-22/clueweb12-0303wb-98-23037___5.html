<h2>Five seconds of fame: Digital signage as a Sippable Medium</h2> 
<p>Author: Bill Gerba on 2007-09-30 11:51:19</p>  Over the past few weeks, a 
lot more people have been asking us how to make compelling digital signage 
content. I don't know if it's because the technical issues have finally been 
solved and they're ready to move on to the next step, or if there are simply 
more project managers who understand that a network is only as good as the 
content that runs on it. Whatever the reason, I'm glad that more companies are 
thinking about specific content creation strategies for their retail, financial 
and health care networks. Their efforts should make these networks more 
effective at engaging viewers and delivering the right messages at exactly the 
right place and time. As if to emphasize the increasing awareness of digital 
signage content, I came across another article that reinforces just how little 
time we have -- and consequently, just how compelling our content needs to be 
-- when trying to woo shoppers at retail.<br>
<br>
 In his article at 
MediaPost, Nigel Hollis talks about thechanges made to the Tesco network over 
in the UK. Tesco TV was a banner child for the digital signage community when 
it was first rolled out by their media partner, JCDecaux. Unfortunately, 
mismanagement and a misunderstanding of how in-store digital media workscaused 
the network to languish, and some people questioned whether the whole thing 
would be scrapped. Thankfully, under the skilled management of Dunnhumby (which 
handles Tesco's POP arrangements), the network is now thriving, and the group 
has even shared some of their secrets. For example, we all know by now that a 
brandonly has a few seconds to win its First Moment of Truth with a consumer. 
While P&amp;G may have discovered this phenomenon, Dunnhumby's research 
confirms it, as they note that content shouldn't be longer than 15 seconds. In 
fact, a mere five seconds is even better, though admittedly these quick bursts 
of content are best suited to high traffic shopping aisles, rather than high 
dwell-time areas. As Hollis notes, &quot;The power of these 'alerts' rests not 
in their creativity but in their proximity to purchase. The alerts reported to 
be most effective are those for price-off events and new or seasonal items. And 
that's both the strength and weakness of in-store video. Because its influence 
is concentrated at the point of purchase, it will be most successful for 
categories that are already impulse- or activation-oriented. Though useful for 
encouraging switching, in-store video is not as good at building long-term 
brand loyalty.&quot; The latter part of the argument notwithstanding (since 
strategies forusing digital signage to build brands are entirely different from 
those using it to boost sales), we're once again confirming thatdigital signage 
content usually works best when delivered in short bursts. <br>
<br>
 With this 
in mind, I would like to officially dub digital signage the &quot;Sippable 
Medium&quot;. What do I mean by that? Well, to explain it we'll have to go back 
to the Cola Wars of the late 1970s and early 80s. At that time, Pepsi (who was 
rapidly gaining market share as the beverage choice of the Next Generation) 
went around the country conducting televised, blind taste tests between 
themselves and Coke. Everyone from celebrities to children to the elderly 
seemed to be involved. The tester was given a small cup of cola from box A, 
another small cup from box B, and then asked which they preferred. Invariably, 
the tester chose the Pepsi.<br>
<br>
 While you might just chalk it up to 
scripted tests and TV magic, Pepsi also performed better in more scientific 
tests, and even Coke admitted it. Why? Because Pepsi is much sweeter than Coke. 
So when consumed in very small amounts (a few sips), it comes across as more 
flavorful. However, when taken in larger amounts (say a 12 ounce can), many 
people find the cola to be cloying and instead prefer Coke. Pepsi understood 
the strengths and weaknesses of their product, and engineered a test optimized 
in its favor. They were able to legitimately say two out of three (or whatever 
the proper ratio is) preferred Pepsi, conveniently leaving off the little 
asterisk explaining that this is only true when consumed a mere ounce or two at 
a time. Coke was so scared by this that they introduced one of the biggest 
debacles in marketing history: the short-lived New Coke. Designed to be sweeter 
and more sippable, the drink was widely rejected and very quickly replaced with 
the Coke Classic that we know and love today.<br>
<br>
 Back in digital signage 
land, we face a challenge, especially in light of ongoing in-store media 
measurement studies by POPAI and Nielsen/PRISM (one of which justannounced some 
preliminary findings). Digital signage is a lot like Pepsi to a static POP 
display's Coke: best consumed in small quantities. Whereas a POP display or an 
endcap is designed to be shopped, walked past, seen from a distance, examined 
up close, and constantly navigated around, a piece of content on a digital sign 
often must be impactful, but fleeting. Take more than a few seconds to make 
your point, and lose the shopper's attention. Repeat yourself too often, and 
your message becomes annoying. Unlike Pepsi, though, we don't get to choose how 
we're tested and measured, so it's entirely possible that when these 
organizations release their findings, the true nature of in-store digital media 
won't be accurately portrayed. On the other hand, we continue to gain insight 
into how our product is best perceived and used, just like Pepsi did. With that 
information, we can continue to get better at developing successful content 
strategies, optimizing network execution plans, and enjoying the sweet -- but 
not too sweet -- taste of success.<br>

this dated one) to always be insightful. It seems to us at Miller Zell that 
perhaps the PRISM initiative suffered from too many appendages. Perhaps the 
better way to go is to build out a smaller more economical data model that all 
agree to as part of their shopper (or customer) data warehouse models. We can 
then as an industry begin to capture consistent data and have a consistent view 
of the whole shopper insight medium. Let's define this thing from a pure 
shopper insight perspective as opposed to muddling the water with all other 
media elements...start small and then build it.<br>

<br>
Thanks very much for the kind words. I think 
there are two competing forces here that partly explain the failure of PRISM:
<br> <br>
On one side are old-school agencies and planners that MUST have an 
apples-to-apples comparison to TV, print, etc. in order to get their jobs done. 
They were interested in PRISM, but perhaps not enough to foot the whole R&amp;D 
bill.<br>
<br>
On the other side are shopper marketing experts (like Miller 
Zell), as well as the retailers and brands themselves, who would much prefer 
the type of data you're talking about, because it will enable them to do more 
business (as opposed to CPM-style ads, which just enable them to maybe sell 
some ads).<br>
<br>
What we're seeing from the measurement newcomers is exactly 
the kind of approach that you're talking about, and in the end, it may well 
prove to be the right one. <br>
