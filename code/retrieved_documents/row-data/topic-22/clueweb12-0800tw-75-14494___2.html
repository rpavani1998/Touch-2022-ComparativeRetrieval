<p>A recent taste test between U.S. Coke and Mexican Coke revealed that 80 
percent of tasters prefer Mexican Coke, which is made with sugar (as opposed to 
American Coke, which is made with high fructose corn syrup). This would lead 
one to assume that all sugar-sweetened sodas should taste better than their 
HFCS counterparts, right? Well, now we're not so sure ...</p> 
<p>Our team of editors recently conducted another taste test, this time between
<strong>Pepsi</strong> (with HFCS) and<strong> Pepsi Throwback</strong> (with 
sugar). We fully expected Pepsi Throwback to come out on top, just like Mexican 
Coke. Surprisingly, we were wrong. Here's a little background to lead up to our 
taste test ...</p> 
<p>Pepsi has been creating soft drinks since 1898, and the formula hasn't 
changed much since then. But in the 1980s, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) 
replaced cane sugar as the soda's sweetener because HFCS was cheaper than cane 
sugar (the U.S. government had levied tariffs on imported cane sugar and was 
now subsidizing the production of corn). There was little to no choice for soda 
manufacturers but to switch to HFCS.</p> 
<p>With more and more Americans concerned about the health effects of HFCS, 
people have been turning to soft drinks made with old-fashioned cane or beet 
sugar, when available. Many small mom-and-pop soda companies use these sugars, 
but not until recently have the large soda companies, such as Pepsi, made a 
move to revert back to sugar in certain &quot;special-edition&quot; lines of 
their drinks.</p> 
<p>Pepsi responded in 2009 by releasing Pepsi Throwback, a soda that uses its 
old formula and includes sugar (cane and beet) instead of HFCS. This new 
offering was not based on any health concerns about HFCS, but more about 
consumer demand. Initially the soda was released for a limited time only, but 
when customers found that their new beverage of choice was gone from shelves, 
Pepsi backpedaled and decided in January of 2011 to add Throwback to its list 
of permanent offerings (as long as consumers keep buying it). And after many 
blunders with the design, Throwback now features the original Pepsi design used 
between 1973 and 1987.</p> 
<p>So what does it taste like? What's the difference? Unlike Coca-Cola, which 
claims its regular Coke (made with HFCS) and Mexican Coke (made with sugar) 
taste the same, Pepsi makes no such claim. In fact, regular Pepsi and Pepsi 
Throwback taste different.Steve Tanner at BevReview.com says Throwback has none 
of the tinny metallic taste of HFCS-based Pepsi -- instead it offers a clean 
and consistent flavor.</p> 
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p> 
<p>Twenty editors blind taste-tested the two colas, side by side, and found ...
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>50 percent</strong> of our tasters could tell the difference 
between regular Pepsi and Pepsi Throwback.</li> 
<li><strong>55 percent</strong> of our tasters preferred regular Pepsi to 
Pepsi Throwback.</li> </ul> 
<p>Here's what our tasters thought:</p> 
<p><strong>Regular Pepsi:</strong> &quot;Tangy and metallic.&quot; 
&quot;Watery.&quot; &quot;Sweeter on the finish.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>Pepsi Throwback:</strong> &quot;Sweeter at the start -- 
better.&quot; &quot;Coats tongue.&quot; &quot;Really thick with syrupy 
mouthfeel.&quot; &quot;Bubbly.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>IN SUMMARY:</strong> Unfortunately most tasters mistook the sweeter 
taste of Throwback (made with sugar) as containing HFCS and thought it was 
regular Pepsi. Though most tasters agreed that Pepsi Throwback has a sweeter 
taste and regular Pepsi has more of a metallic taste.</p> 
<p><strong>Can you tell the difference between Pepsi made with HFCS and sugar?

 20 minutes ago ( 7:16 AM)  Throwback Pepsi definitely beats 
&quot;regular&quot;. It tastes like when I was younger. The only improvement 
would be to put it in glass--no can or plastic taste taint! But the best 
&quot;Throwback&quot; is Mountain Dew! If I ever find IT in glass, I'm buying a 
case. I don't drink much soda because of the calories, but I'd make an 
exception for that.<br>
<br>
 Remember the old Mountain Dew bottles with 
&quot;It'll tickle yore innards&quot;? Some people thought it was 
&quot;naughty&quot;. Those were the days! (Now I sound ancient. Ha!)<br>
<br>
 
Seriously, cane sugar beats HFCS for taste, hands down.  lovetostitch:

 15 hours 
ago ( 4:29 PM) The only HFCS pops we buy are the ones that aren't available 
with sugar. I'm glad to see sugar back. I buy as much Heritage Dr. Pepper as I 
can get when it goes on sale. We buy Pepsi Throwback and some Coke when we can 
find it. 7-Up and Sierra Mist are much better with sugar.  qzephyr: The only

 19 hours 
ago (12:47 PM) Our house certainly can tell! We have a &quot;mixed 
marriage&quot; - one diehard Coke fan (me) and one diehard Pepsi fan (my 
partner). We can each taste the difference between HFCS and sugar-based sodas 
in either drink. I cannot drink regular Pepsi due to the sweetness so I refuse 
to drink it. My partner will relent and occasionally drink Coke if Pepsi is not 
available though dislikes the &quot;high acid taste&quot; in HFCS Coke. She 
doesn't mind Mexican Coke.<br>
<br>
 We were in South Africa last year and 
bought Pepsi and Coke - talk about different formulations based on what is 
available to the bottler! To our complete surprise, she preferred the Coke and 
I didn't mind the Pepsi. So odd.<br>
<br>
 On the recent variations, she's 
recently found Mexican Pepsi (not throwback, not regular) and prefers that. She 
can easily distinguish the taste between the three as a daily Pepsi drinker. 
And I think that's key to any of these tests: what is your normal drink? Blind 
tastes on Pepsi wouldn't matter much for me - I don't drink Pepsi if I have a 
choice. I could discern the difference, but it didn't matter too much to me. 
And of course I can taste just about any variation of Coke since I know that 
best. Mexican Coke is preferable, US Coke is good and the South African stuff? 
It seemed sweeter than US or Mexican. And that nasty New Coke from the 80s?? 
Don't even get me started!!  CokeFan: Our house certainly can tell! We have a 
&quot;mixed marriage&quot;<br>
