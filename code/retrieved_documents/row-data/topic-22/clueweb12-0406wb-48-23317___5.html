<p> Welcome back to another edition of Forum Spotlight. This has been one of 
the busiest weeks we've ever had here at SharkyExtreme - from video cards to 
CPU roadmaps to MP3 players, we've pretty much run the gamut this week. There 
has been surprisingly little reaction in the forums to the<b>Playstation2 launch
</b> earlier this week, but then again, if I were one of the lucky ones to 
receive one, I'd probably be smack on my rear playing with the thing rather 
than posting rambling thoughts on it. If you weren't so lucky, you could always 
speculate on how much faster your next DDR-equipped Athlon system will perform 
in comparison to the overly-hyped console. Wait...did he say DDR? Stay tuned 
for more information. We'd spill the beans right here and now, but then we'd 
have to kill you.</p>
<p> Until then, feel free to discuss whatever is on your mind over at 
SharkyForums.com. Each week we take several of the most 
popular/insightful/controversial threads and present them to you for easy 
digestion. Feel free to jump in at any time (it's kind of like jump rope, in a 
way) and discuss, as we've added links on each spotlight page so you can easily 
add your own comments and contribute to the debate! Why would you want to do 
such a thing? Well, if your repartee strikes us as useful, humorous, or 
otherwise entertaining, it stands the distinct possibility of being featured 
next week. Without further ado...</p>

<p> <b>Rambus Technology</b><br>
 For those of you who aren't particularly 
clear on how Rambus memory works, this thread makes an excellent read. There 
are some good explanations, as well as a few valuable links that will turn any 
novie into a well schooled memory whiz-kid.</p>
<p> <b>MP3 Software</b><br>
 What is your favorite encoding software. Yeah 
yeah, we really believe you only use MP3 to back up your CD's (I'm so sure). 
Can y ou tell the difference between CD audio and MP3 encoded audio? If not, 
it's time for some speakers.</p>
<p> <b>Question On The 760</b><br>
 We can't give you any details about the 
760 chipset from AMD, but let's face it, would we really be promoting this 
thread if it weren't just around the corner?</p>
<p> <b>NV20</b><br>
 Like fists at a boxing match, rumors about the NV20 are 
really flying. Will we see six pipelines with three texture units per pipeline? 
Your guess is as good as ours. Seriously, we have no clue what the NV20 will 
look like.</p>
<p> <b>RADEON DDR Or GeForce2 MX?</b><br>
 We've seem a few heated discussions 
regarding today's high-end video cards, but rarely do we see the value-end 
vehemently debated. There are quite a few good choices out there right now, so 
which really is better?</p>
<p> <b>Coke or Pepsi?</b><br>
 Although we usually like to drink 
Tommyknockers, we will occasionally have a Coke or two. SO what'll it be? Coke 
or Pepsi?</p>
