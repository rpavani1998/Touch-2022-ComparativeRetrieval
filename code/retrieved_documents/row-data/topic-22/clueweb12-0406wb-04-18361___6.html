<strong><strong>Multiply Your 
Marketing Like a Virus<br>
</strong>By Michel Fortin (c) 2009 In today&rsquo;s 
Internet, conversations are cropping up all over the place. People are talking. 
They are talking about products. They are talking about businesses. And they 
are certainly talking about their experiences.&nbsp;
<p></p> 
<p>When you look at how blogs, forums and social networking sites have 
exploded in the last few years, you can see how powerful word-of-mouth is. But 
the question is, is it all really important? Can it really help your business?
</p> 
<p>Yes.</p> 
<p>And I&rsquo;m not talking about traffic. And you don&rsquo;t need to be 
controversial, either. I&rsquo;m talking creating systems to leverage, manage 
and profit from the &ldquo;buzz.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Word-of-mouth is one of the most powerful lead and business generation 
processes there is. Online, some people call it &ldquo;word-of-mouse.&rdquo; 
But we know it more as viral marketing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Viral marketing is the process of implementing means or tools through which 
the knowledge of your existence self- propagates. Like a virus, your visibility 
spreads throughout a network of people who refer you to each other.</p> 
<p>Notwithstanding the power of backlinking, traffic and SEO, viral marketing 
is key for a number of reasons. Success in the offline world is 
&ldquo;location, location, location.&rdquo; The Internet is no different. Your 
success depends highly on the number of locations you appear online &ndash; 
places on which your site, link, company or product name exist.</p> 
<p>In essence, to expand your reach, you need to be in as many places as 
possible, talked about by as many people as possible and be in front of as many 
eyeballs as possible.</p> 
<p>With viral marketing, there are three ways of doing it:</p> 
<p>Create content<br>
 Create applications<br>
 Create systems</p> 
<p>The first is self-explanatory. Your content may be controversial or 
buzzworthy. It may create raging fans &ndash; or enraged enemies.</p> 
<p>The second is simple: you create an application &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s 
a video, audio, file, software, document, etc &ndash; that people can pass 
around, and thus proliferates the knowledge of your existence on the web 
through other people&rsquo;s efforts.</p> 
<p>I might write about these two at a later time. But for now, the one on 
which I want to focus is the third: creating a system.</p> 
<p>Before I give you some examples, let me explain why word-of- mouth works 
wonders. Those who get to know you or to know about you through a third party 
grant you a higher level of confidence, credibility and loyalty. According to 
Dr. Robert Cialdini in his amaz&iacute;ng book, &ldquo;Influence: The 
Psychology of Persuasion,&rdquo; this is social proof in action.</p> 
<p>Remember a dictum a mentor of mine once told me, which is: 
&ldquo;Implication is far more powerful than specification.&rdquo; In other 
words, if you tell people you&rsquo;re the best, that you&rsquo;re the leader 
in your field, or that your product is the best solution to their needs, your 
self-serving promotional bias makes it all suspect.</p> 
<p><strong>However, if someone other than you &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s on a 
blog, in an email, on a social networking site or in person &ndash; says to 
another that you are indeed the best or that you do have the best solution to 
their problems, how much more believable will that person&rsquo;s statement be? 
How much more credible and trustworthy?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The answer is &ldquo;definitely more.&rdquo;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Accordingly, word-of-mouth is not only important because it creates 
an awareness of your business (let alone traffic), but also it is important to 
the degree to which third party marketing indirectly communicates greater 
credibility, superiority and value of the products or services you provide.
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>In his book &ldquo;The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding,&rdquo; Al 
Ries stresses the importance of leadership and how that leadership is 
communicated.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>According to Ries, people don&rsquo;t buy the best &ndash; they 
only think they do. They usually buy the leader (or what they perceive as being 
the best). And that perception is often molded by what they are told and by 
what others do, not by what is fact or by what is being advertised.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Coke, for example, outsells Pepsi. But according to Ries, taste 
tests reveal that Pepsi is the better tasting brand. So, why does Coke still 
beat Pepsi in sales? It is not because it is the leader in the marketplace or 
promoted itself as such but because it is known as the leader. And the reason 
it is known as the leader is because Coke was the first cola &ldquo;in the 
mind&rdquo; of the marketplace.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>It is the one most talked about, even to this day. When a person is 
introduced to cola for the first time, they are often told to try Coke. 
Restaurant patrons still ask for &ldquo;coke,&rdquo; even when Pepsi is the 
only cola served. Why is that? While other colas are bombarding them with 
marketing messages, people have heard of Coke first, and most likely from other 
people.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Consequently, if people hear about you from other people, and not 
some advertisement or pitch, this social proof will create not only a certain 
buzzworthiness about you but also an almost instant trustworthiness.</strong>
</p> 
<p><strong>How do you do that? The most significant method is to be the first. 
If your business or website is unique, focuses on a niche or is the first in 
some category, the knowledge of your existence will spread quite naturally, 
almost like wildfire. It becomes viral in and of itself, in other words.
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying you need to be new. I&rsquo;m only saying 
you need to be unique. Or better yet, you need to be the first. Whether 
it&rsquo;s catering an existing product to a new niche, or adding a new twist 
to an existing product, you become the first.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>I said it before: don&rsquo;t be the best, be the first. But more 
important, as Ries pointed out, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be the first in the 
marketplace, be the first in the MIND of the marketplace.&rdquo;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>That said, there are ways to use systems that will leverage the 
spreading of that message, on the other hand, which helps to multiply your 
marketing punch. Such systems both simulate and stimulate word-of-mouth 
advertising.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Networking systems, for example, include strategic marketing 
alliances, joint ventures, and affiliate programs. And unlike the more 
tradwebsional traffic generators such as ads and search engines, these specific 
tools are much more effective since they are used by third parties and not by 
the original advertiser.<br>
