<h1>Is Pepsi really better than Coke?</h1> 
<h2>Once again the Penzo family conducts a blind taste test, comparing top 
brands and less expensive products. The results may surprise you.</h2>  By&nbsp;
MSN Money partner&nbsp;Apr 20, 2012 12:00PM <br>

<p><i><b>This post comes from Len Penzo at partner blog </b></i><i><b>Len 
Penzo dot Com</b></i><i><b>. </b></i></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>People have been enjoying cola-flavored soft drinks ever since 1886, when 
the first glasses of Coca-Cola were&nbsp;served up for&nbsp;5 cents each (about 
$1.10 in today's dollars) at an&nbsp;Atlanta pharmacy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Today, soft drinks are a key part of a beverage industry worth billions of 
dollars, so it should be no surprise that when it comes to the highly 
competitive soft drink wars, the century-long crusade for cola lovers being 
waged by Coke and Pepsi shows no sign of abating.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In 1975, Pepsi introduced a blind taste test known as the &quot;Pepsi 
Challenge.&quot; Held in malls and shopping centers across America, it 
tried&nbsp;-- unsuccessfully&nbsp;-- to settle the &quot;Coke vs. Pepsi&quot; 
debate once and for all.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pepsi claims the challenge proved that more Americans prefer Pepsi. Maybe 
so. But when it comes to bragging rights for America's top-selling soft drink, 
Pepsi has played the perennial bridesmaid to Coke ever since Pepsi made its 
debut at the turn of the 20th century.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Bing:</b> Malcolm Gladwell and the sip test</li> </ul> 
<p>And Pepsi's pride took another hit in 2011 when sales of Diet Coke 
surpassed those of Pepsi, making it&nbsp;the second most popular soft drink in 
the U.S.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Is Coke <i>really</i> that much better than Pepsi? I think so. Arguably, 
the biggest difference between the two soft drinks is that Pepsi is sweeter, 
while Coke has a bit more carbonation&nbsp;-- and I have a bias toward that 
refreshing fizz.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Today, my preference for Coke is so strong that I'll often change my drink 
order to root beer or lemonade at establishments that carry Pepsi.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For the record, I haven't always been a Coke drinker. As a kid, my family 
drank only Pepsi. In fact, I didn't become a loyal Coke drinker until I finally 
left the nest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Anyway, with that in mind, I decided to find out which cola my family would 
ultimately choose in a modified version of my own Pepsi Challenge.<i>(Post 
continues below video.)</i></p> <br>

<p><b>How the test was conducted</b></p> 
<p>As with my ketchup blind taste test, I recruited a bunch of family members 
as an expert panel. This time there were 10 eager volunteers (plus the dog, of 
course).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the panel in place, I prepared individual cola samples in separate 
paper cups. To ensure the taste test was a blind comparison, the samples were 
marked &quot;A&quot; through &quot;D.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The experts were asked to rank each cola solely for taste, from best to 
worst, with four points for the top performer and one point for the worst. The 
panel members were also free to make comments about each sample. When comparing 
products, panelists&nbsp;who could not discern a clear taste advantage between 
two or more brands were allowed to give identical rankings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Introducing the cola competitors</b></p> 
<p>I ran down to my local Albertsons supermarket and bought all four cola 
brands they were offering for sale: Pepsi, Coke, Royal Crown, and Chill, which 
is a bargain brand marketed by Shoppers Value.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here, in reverse order, is a summary of the cola taste test results, based 
upon the inputs of my expert panel:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>4. Coca-Cola</b></p> 
<p><b>Price (2 liters):</b> $1.79.<br>
<b>Panel scoring:</b> 17 points.<br>
<b>
Average score (4-point scale):</b> 1.6.<br>
<b>Human judges who deemed it the 
best:</b> 0.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>OMG! Coca-Cola inventor Dr. John Pemberton must be rolling over in his 
grave. Not only did the top-selling U.S. soft drink&nbsp;-- not to mention my 
personal favorite&nbsp;-- finish in last place, it was thoroughly trounced 
by&nbsp;the competition. How bad was it? Not a single panelist selected Coke as 
the favorite cola, and six of the&nbsp;10 human judges rated it&nbsp;dead 
last.&nbsp;A seventh ranked it second from the bottom. Flavor was the 
predominant complaint. The Honeybee gave the Coke demerits for being &quot;too 
watery,&quot; while Dad said&nbsp;it was &quot;lacking in flavor.&quot; On the 
positive side, Mark liked Coke's &quot;fizz factor.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>3. RC Cola</b></p> 
<p><b>Price (2 liters):</b> $1.29.<br>
<b>Panel scoring:</b> 25 points.<br>
<b>
Average score (4-point scale):</b> 2.4.<br>
<b>Human judges who deemed it the 
best:</b> 2.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Royal Crown Cola has been around in its present incarnation since 1934. 
Today, it is distributed by Dr Pepper/Snapple Group. Although not as popular as 
Coke or Pepsi in terms of sales, RC Cola received the blue ribbon from two 
panelists, and three other judges ranked it second best. Chris thought it was 
the &quot;best tasting by far,&quot; and Aunt Doris gave it her highest mark 
because it was &quot;simply perfect.&quot; On the other hand, Matthew 
said&nbsp;Royal Crown tasted &quot;flat,&quot; and both Nina and my mom thought 
RC was &quot;too sweet.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>2. Chill</b></p> 
<p><b>Price (2 liters):</b> $1.<br>
<b>Panel scoring:</b> 27 points.<br>
<b>
Average score (4-point scale):</b> 2.5.<br>
<b>Human judges who deemed it the 
best:</b> 3.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The bargain brand performed well, earning three blue ribbons from the 
panel. Only one panelist, Mark, thought the Chill cola was the worst of the 
bunch. He said&nbsp;it was &quot;way too syrupy.&quot; It's interesting to note 
that my Mom and Dad both picked Chill as their favorite cola and remarked on 
their evaluation sheets that they thought it was&nbsp;probably Pepsi.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>1. Pepsi Cola</b></p> 
<p><b>Price (2 liters):</b> $1.79.<br>
<b>Panel scoring:</b> 31 points.<br>
<b>
Average score (4-point scale):</b> 2.9.<br>
<b>Human judges who deemed it the 
best:</b> 5.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As far as my expert panel was concerned, Pepsi is clearly the top&nbsp;pop. 
It received the&nbsp;blue ribbon from five of the judges, and two others 
thought it was second best. My dad was the only one to rank it last (&quot;too 
flat&quot;), but he was in the minority. Kevin wryly noted that the only thing 
that could have made the Pepsi better was a splash of rum.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>So is Pepsi really better than Coke?</b></p> 
<p>While Coke has always been America's top-selling soft drink, Pepsi has 
steadfastly maintained that, in head-to-head competition, more people prefer 
the taste of&nbsp;its product in blind taste tests. And even though my taste 
test experiment included additional competitors, it still managed to back up 
Pepsi's claims.</p>

<p><b>Smart Spending on the go:</b> Get our app for your&nbsp;Android&nbsp;or 
iPhone </p> </li> </ul>So while the results of my little cola taste test 
experiment will have most Pepsi fans screaming &quot;I told you so,&quot; in 
the end, it's just another skirmish in a long battle that will most likely do 
absolutely nothing to convince Coke drinkers that Pepsi should rightfully be 
declared the cola world's &quot;King of the Hill.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I know I'm<b> </b>not impressed. As far as I'm concerned, Coke will always 
be No. 1 in my book.</p>

 I like Pepsi 
&nbsp;best and will change my order to another soft drink when in an 
establishment that serves coke, I am not surprised that Pepsi won against all 
comers in your taste test. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1

 Give me good 
home-brewed root beer over all of these (A&amp;W or Thomas Kemper are among the 
best commercial root beers).&nbsp; Otherwise, I'd take Pepsi (Diet).&nbsp; 
There must be something in the Coke that creates addiction (I know it has not 
contained cocaine for many many years).&nbsp; I see adults walking around with 
liter bottles of Coke in hand quite often.&nbsp; I've never seen any with RC or 
Pepsi.<br>
