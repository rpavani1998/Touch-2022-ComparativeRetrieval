 Personally, I prefer drinking Coke 
to drinking Pepsi. Whenever I am given a choice, whether in a restaurant, on a 
plane, or in a convenience store, I will choose Coke. Why? I think it's because 
I like the taste - it's not as sweet as Pepsi. At least that's what I think.<br>
<br>How much does &quot;taste&quot; really matter? You probably remember a 
classic ad campaign of the early 1908s, &quot;The Pepsi Challenge.&quot; Pepsi 
developed the campaign to tell an interesting story. In 1972, 
&quot;exclusive&quot; drinkers, those who drank over Coke and those who drank 
only Pepsi, made up 18% (Coke) and 4% (Pepsi) of the soft drink population. By 
the early 1980s, those who drank exclusively Coke dropped to 12% and those who 
drank exclusively Pepsi had increased to 11% of the soft drink population. 
Pepsi decided that this increase was based on the taste of their soft drink and 
set out to prove their point with &quot;The Pepsi Challenge.&quot;<br>
<br>
In 
shopping malls, grocery stores and other public locations, Pepsi conducted 
blind taste tests. In these televised spots, consumers were asked to pick the 
soft drink they liked better, without knowing whether the cola they tasted was 
Coke or Pepsi. As results came in, it became apparent - Pepsi tasted better 
than Coke - 57% of testers chose Pepsi and only 43% chose Coke. Showing blind 
taste tests on TV commercials was innovative and the results of the taste test 
sparked a revolution... remember new Coke?<br>

<b>Neuromarketing
</b><br>
<br>
Nearly 30 years later, in the summer of 2003, neuroscientist Read 
Montague conducted this classic taste test with a fMRI (functional Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging) machine, which tracks blood flow to different regions of the 
brain. His subjects took the Pepsi Challenge and Montague watched their neural 
activity. In the blind taste test, the blood flow showed half the subjects 
preferred Coke and half preferred Pepsi. Yet, when subjects were told which 
brand they were drinking, their neural activity demonstrated that three-fourths 
favored Coke. This was quantitative proof that brand affects customers' choices.
<br> <br>
Neuromarketing, the study of how the brain responds to brands and 
advertising, is getting more and more attention. Its practitioners believe 
neuromarketing is more effective than other measurement techniques because the 
information it provides comes directly from consumers' brains and is not 
affected by participant bias. Not only does neuromarketing eliminate 
self-reporting bias, it also removes consumers' inability to articulate 
differences between conscious and unconscious thoughts. It seems like a perfect 
solution to measure the emotional response to products or brands.<br>
<br>

There are some problems, however. The moving-image MRI rents for $1,000 an hour 
at Emory University in Atlanta so a single experiment, including at least 12 
subjects, can cost $50,000. Only very large companies like General Motors or 
Coca Cola can afford the expense. It's hardly likely to be adopted by many 
companies. The other barrier is the un-natural testing environment. Scanning 
neural activity in an MRI is far removed from the actual experience 
environment. An experience process like purchasing at a retail store or buying 
online can hardly be conducted in an fMRI on a massive scale. While I do 
believe neuromarketing will break through these barriers one day, that day may 
be a long way off.<br>
<br>
Recently, I conducted similar taste tests without 
using an MRI. I tested my students at universities in China, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, The Netherlands, France, and Australia, undergraduates, graduate 
students, and working adults with ages ranging from early 20s to late 40s. Each 
student performed two taste tests - one was a blind taste test, in the other I 
told them which cup contained Coke and which contained Pepsi. Their choices in 
the blind taste test are not consistent with their choices in the open taste 
test. From one-fourth to one-half of students did not respond consistently to 
the blind and open taste tests. Even though some students identified themselves 
as Coke or Pepsi fans, they confused the taste of Coke and Pepsi, choosing one 
as the best-tasting in the blind test and the other in the open test<br>
<br>

Both the MRI scanning and my students' taste tests suggest that people perceive 
and react differently when they know which brand they are consuming. There is a 
missing link between consumers' perceptions and their ultimate behaviour. So, 
what is going on inside their minds?<br>
