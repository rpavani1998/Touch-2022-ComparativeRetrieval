<h1>Coke, Pepsi Alter Recipe to Avoid Cancer Labels</h1> 
<p>By Martinne Geller, Reuters</p> 
<p>10 March 12</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This announcement comes on the heels of published findings by the Center 
for Science in the Public Interest that generated a great deal of public 
attention. See the full story of CSPI's findingshere. - JPS/RSN</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>he change will not be noticeable to consumers, according to statements from 
both companies.</p> 
<p>Coke and Pepsi said on Friday that they had asked their suppliers of the 
caramel coloring in their colas to alter their manufacturing process to meet 
the requirements of a California ballot initiative aiming to limit people's 
exposure to toxic chemicals.</p> 
<p>&quot;Consumers will notice no difference in our products and have no 
reason at all for any health concerns,&quot; said PepsiCo spokeswoman Gina 
Anderson in a statement.</p> 
<p>The change is meant to reduce the amount of a chemical called 
4-methylimidazole, or 4-MI, which in January was added to the list of chemicals 
covered by California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, 
also known as Proposition 65.</p> 
<p>High levels of that chemical have been linked to cancer in animals.</p> 
<p>The California statute says that &quot;no person in the course of doing 
business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical 
known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first 
giving a clear and reasonable warning ...&quot;</p> 
<p>Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Sheidler said the modification to the manufacturing 
process will have no effect on the formula, color or taste of Coca-Cola.</p> 
<p>Both companies said they started in California, and would expand the use of 
the reduced 4-MI caramel coloring over time.</p> 
<p>Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) said all the caramel color being 
produced for it meets the new California standard.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a 
U.S. watchdog group, said it found unsafe levels of the chemical in cans of 
Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Dr Pepper and Whole Foods Markets Inc's (WFM.O) 365 Cola.
</p> 
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said at the time it was reviewing the 
group's petition but stressed that the drinks were still safe. An FDA spokesman 
said a person would have to drink &quot;well over a thousand cans of soda a day 
to reach the doses administered in the studies that have shown links to cancer 
in rodents&quot;.</p> 
<p>Shares of Coke and Pepsi were both up less than 1 percent in afternoon 
trade, roughly in line with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. Dr Pepper 
Snapple shares were up 1.1 percent at $38.12.</p>

<p> We are concerned about a recent drift towards vitriol in the RSN Reader 
comments section. There is a fine line between moderation and censorship. No 
one likes a harsh or confrontational forum atmosphere. At the same time 
everyone wants to be able to express themselves freely. We'll start by 
encouraging good judgement. If that doesn't work we'll have to ramp up the 
moderation.</p> 
<p> General guidelines: Avoid personal attacks on other forum members; Avoid 
remarks that are ethnically derogatory; Do not advocate violence, or any 
illegal activity.</p> 
<p> Remember that making the world better begins with responsible action. </p>

+13 # warkovision 2012-03-10 09:23  Is it 
me or does it matter that colas are artificially colored? If it tastes the same 
what's the difference?? Why color it? Do people really associate color with the 
way it will taste? I understand from a visual perspective it might be more 
attractive to some but is it really that important? I'm not in sales or 
anything but would people be less likely to purchase a &quot;clear&quot; 
uncolored cola if they knew that it didn't contain potentially dangerous 
coloring?<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br>
+10 # Texas Aggie 2012-03-10 10:34  I 
suspect that people have so internalized the idea that colas should be dark 
that any new light colored product would have to be marketed under another 
name. People's buying habits are not exactly noted for their practicality and 
rationality.<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br>
+8 # Capn Canard 2012-03-10 10:08  In my 
view this is an indictment of the western capitalist's whole paradigm. Part of 
that paradigm that maintains that profit motive produces the best product and 
there is always a drive to reduce cost the results only measured on the bottom 
line. How much more evidence do we need?<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br>
+5 # DaveM 
2012-03-10 10:45  I believe there actually have been several attempts to market 
clear colas, which bombed. They cannot compete with generations of advertising 
showing a dark brown liquid. I don't know, but: was any cola ever actually that 
color, even with the original (19th Century) ingredients?<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
<br> +8 # sandyboy 2012-03-10 11:02  Put back the cocaine, I say! Probably less 
harmful than 4-MI and certainly more fun. Oops! Sorry for advocating 
&quot;illegal activity&quot;, o webmaster!<br>

catfather 2012-03-10 13:25  TO: warkvosion, Texas Aggie and DaveM: Some 60 
years ago, my favorite soft drink here in Cincinnati was called &quot;Creme 
Soda.&quot; We kids called it &quot;red pop&quot; -- a bright, ruby-red and 
very sweet drink. But if we drove less than 100 miles west, to Indianapolis, 
&quot;red pop&quot; wasn't red -- it was crystal clear, like 7-Up. It was made 
by the same company, my father told me, and the only difference was the color 
-- he told me. NOT SO! to this juvenile consumer. It did NOT taste like red pop 
'cause it wasn't red. Then we moved to New Jersey...and the Creme Soda was 
brown! And did it ever taste different! (In fact, it was a different recipe, 
and in fact was really vanilla soda.) Years later, the maker of Cincinnati red 
pop altered its recipe 'cause the wonderful red dye was labeled carcinogenic. 
The &quot;new&quot; red pop took on a red-orange color. That was the only 
change -- THEY said -- but it aure tasted different. Now that I am a grown up, 
I drink Coke Zero (I hope)<br>

13:29  BTW to RNS Team...In your recent statement about vitriolic drift, you say
<br> <br>
 &quot;We'll start by encouraging good judgement.&quot; <br>
<br>
As 
this is the U.S., not the UK -- don't you mean you'll be &quot;encouraging good 
judgment&quot;?  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br>
+6 # GF4A 2012-03-10 14:02  While they're 
at it, Coke and Pepsi had better take a hard look at the artificial sweetener, 
ASPARTAME.<br>

+1 # rockieball@yahoo.com 2012-03-12 06:40  Right and also 
HFCS. I used to like and drinks A&amp;W Root Beers as well as Dad's Old 
Fashion. We used to buy a half gallon jug of the syrup at the local A&amp;W and 
mix our own at home. But today I cannot stand the taste because they removed 
the sugar and use HF Corn Syrup and it taste different.<br>
 I don't drink 
Pepsi or Coke never did like it. As for diet soda you can have that it's worse 
than regular for your health.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br>

17:11  I was addicted to Pepsi for several years. Now, I just drink water or 
fruit juice. Simple solution --- STOP drinking chemicals overloaded with real 
OR fake sugar.<br>

Quoting 
<blockquote> I was addicted to Pepsi for several years. Now, I just drink

Absolutely Pablo..however I do 
caution you to make sure your water is not toxic with butane, arsenic, toluene. 
That is easy I think as long as it is bottled in glass. Your fruit juice will 
probably be from a GM plant so I would suggest determining first if your juice 
is free of pesticides and herbicides. The same rule should apply to your sugar 
source, beet or cane or maple or honey. The maple trees should be free of 
pesticides and the honey should come from domestic bees because we have no idea 
what toxic pollen the wild bees pick up because they are dying by the millions.
