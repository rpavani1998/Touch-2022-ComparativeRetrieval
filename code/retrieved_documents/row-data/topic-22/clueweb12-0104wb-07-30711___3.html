<h1>Which is better? Giving or Investing?</h1> Posted on January 17, 2012 by

<p><em>By Sally Boulter, Manager of Individual Initiatives at Calvert 
Foundation</em></p> 
<p>Which is better? Coke or Pepsi? Even a casual reader of the commentary 
around impact investing and philanthropy will note that much of the discussion 
is centered on which is better. But it is not a Coke-or-Pepsi decision with one 
option being clearly superior.<br>
 Impact investing and philanthropy each have 
their own unique roles to play in moving society forward. They are distinct and 
yet collaborative tools that can be accessed and employed to improve 
people&rsquo;s lives.</p> 
<p>To oversimplify, investment capital can help build things like small 
businesses, affordable housing, community health clinics, senior centers, 
schools, water systems in the developing world, etc. On the other hand, 
philanthropy is essential to providing funding for the arts, job and literacy 
training, pregnancy prevention, eldercare, and similar programs which will 
never be supported by the market alone. In many situations, these needs and the 
programs that support them aren&rsquo;t exclusively served by one or the other. 
In fact, in many cases, we see the clear benefit in having both, working in 
partnership.</p> 
<p>A prime example of the investment-philanthropy partnership can be seen at 
St. John&rsquo;s Bread &amp; Life in Brooklyn, NY. Every day at St. 
John&rsquo;s more than 1,000 hungry Brooklyn children, families, and 
individuals receive nutritious meals. Recently theLow Income Investment Fund, a 
Calvert Foundation borrower for the last five years, provided a $7 million loan 
to enable St. John&rsquo;s to expand their facilities and serve a total of 
450,000 meals annually. Using a loan to fund St. John&rsquo;s space needs meant 
that more philanthropy was available to provide services to the recipients of 
the meals, like Naishaune Spencer (pictured right with his daughter). At St. 
John&rsquo;s, Naishaune receives nutritional counseling, health and hygiene 
products, and social services such as workforce development, literacy training, 
psychiatric services, and substance-abuse counseling. &ldquo;I ran with the 
wrong crowd and ended up homeless, jobless, and in a whole lot of 
trouble,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With the help of St. John&rsquo;s Bread &amp; 
life, loving family and friends, and sheer dedication, I was able to go back to 
school, get a great job, have a steady income and, most significantly, get my 
first apartment.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Traditional philanthropy and government programs, while critical to 
improving the lives of the poor, can never by themselves meet all the needs of 
disadvantaged communities. Impact investing offers a new way to bring capital 
to improving lives and a new way for people to connect with each other based on 
mutual benefit.</p> 
<p>At Calvert Foundation, our aim is to transform investment culture so that 
every investor becomes an impact investor. As a nonprofit, however, we 
recognize and value the vital role that philanthropy plays even within the 
impact investing sector, for things like risk capital and technical assistance 
for social entrepreneurs.</p> 
<p>I look forward to the day when we stop viewing philanthropy and impact 
investing as a Coke-or-Pepsi choice and start to see them for what they are: 
natural allies in the struggle to make the world a better place for ALL of us 
to live, work, raise our families, and perhaps have a little fun.</p> 
<p>As for soda, we all know Coke is it.</p> <br>

<p>One other thing philanthropy can do is to help jump-start investment 
(including the impact investing movement). Clearly, we need both.</p> 
<p>As for soda, I put my money on plain water or fruit juices rather than 
carbonated water &hellip;</p> Reply <br>
