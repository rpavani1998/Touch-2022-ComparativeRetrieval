<h2>It&rsquo;s Time to Expand the Circle</h2> 
<p> Posted on January 31, 2012 by thea </p> <br>
<br>

<p><em>This post by&nbsp;Lisa Green Hall, President and CEO, was originally 
published on theCenter for Financial Inclusion blog, and is part of their&nbsp;
Expert Exchange: Building A Movement Toward Financial Inclusion by 2020, 
cultivating conversation around the goal of reaching full financial inclusion 
by 2020. For further questions about this series, write toSonja E. Kelly, 
Fellow, Center for Financial Inclusion at ACCION International.</em></p> 
<p>Lisa Hall</p> 
<p>In September, I had the opportunity to participate in a dialogue with more 
than 45 other participants as part of a roundtable hosted byACCION&rsquo;s 
Center for Financial Inclusion. The purpose of this new blog is to continue the 
conversation we started that day &ndash; and I am honored to be the first to 
post here.</p> 
<p>At Calvert Foundation, we often talk about impact investing as a virtuous 
circle, one that creates empowerment, opportunity, and engagement by connecting 
investors, underprivileged individuals, and communities. This connection 
&ndash; to me &ndash; is the ultimate goal of financial inclusion. It&rsquo;s 
about a connected circle of people, with mutual benefit for all the 
stakeholders involved, and with clients at the center.</p> 
<p>So how do we make finance more inclusive?</p> 
<p><strong>First, we have to build out the community of those dedicated to 
financial inclusion by expanding the types of partnerships we pursue.</strong> 
Strategic partnerships are difficult due to competing interests. Key 
information can be proprietary, and goals don&rsquo;t always align. In general, 
the financial inclusion industry needs to continue to build that capacity.</p> 
<p>I am proud of the collaboration we at Calvert Foundation (through our 
subsidiary,Community Investment Partners) established with Citibank to get more 
dollars to communities where jobs and investments are needed most. In less than 
two years, this cooperation increased our lending activities by more than 50 
percent. Partnerships are critical. At an industry level, therefore, we need to 
think about what partnership models will look like in the future, moving 
partnerships beyond the typical investor/service provider relationship. We need 
to do more &ndash; and we can&rsquo;t do it alone.</p> 
<p><strong>Second, we also need to constantly look ahead.</strong> The needs 
of microfinance institutions and their clients are evolving and changing every 
day. New technologies bring new opportunities, but are also disruptive. The 
microfinance community can continue to provide niche services, or it can 
explore new products and new business models that will take it out of its 
comfort zone. Throughout, there will continue to be a need for patient, 
flexible, and affordable capital &ndash; but this is just one building block, 
and the delivery mechanisms are changing.</p> 
<p><strong>Finally, we must work to protect clients and continue to evaluate 
social impact.</strong> In 2009 Calvert Foundation began working with CGAP and 
ACCION to provide an investor perspective at the beginning stages of the Client 
Protection Principles now called the Smart Campaign. We were proud to become 
one of the first signatories, and have since worked to incorporate the 
principles into our investment process from beginning to end. We began using 
social impact covenants in our loan agreements, requiring MFI borrowers to 
comply with the Smart Campaign, or have their own code of ethics with 
equivalent emphasis on client protection. We have expanded the social impact 
section of our due diligence reports to include evaluation of the potential MFI 
borrower&rsquo;s compliance with the principles. As of Q3 2011, 77 percent of
Calvert Foundation&rsquo;s MFI borrowers had signed on to the Smart Campaign. 
We hope by the end of 2012 that number will be 100 percent.</p> 
<p>This last point about client protection and social impact is fundamental. 
When I was at theTBLI Conference in London earlier this month, I saw 
&ldquo;Occupy&rdquo; protesters just a block from where the conference was 
being held. They were camped out in tents near St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, 
waving signs that expressed frustration about a system they felt had harmed 
more than helped them. Financial inclusion is about bringing everyone into the 
system &ndash; but also about ensuring that that system is beneficial for those 
who participate.</p>

<h2>Which is better? Giving or Investing?</h2> 
<p> Posted on January 17, 2012 by thea </p> <br>
<br>

<p><em>By Sally Boulter, Manager of Individual Initiatives at Calvert 
Foundation</em></p> 
<p>Which is better? Coke or Pepsi? Even a casual reader of the commentary 
around impact investing and philanthropy will note that much of the discussion 
is centered on which is better. But it is not a Coke-or-Pepsi decision with one 
option being clearly superior.<br>
 Impact investing and philanthropy each have 
their own unique roles to play in moving society forward. They are distinct and 
yet collaborative tools that can be accessed and employed to improve 
people&rsquo;s lives.</p> 
<p>To oversimplify, investment capital can help build things like small 
businesses, affordable housing, community health clinics, senior centers, 
schools, water systems in the developing world, etc. On the other hand, 
philanthropy is essential to providing funding for the arts, job and literacy 
training, pregnancy prevention, eldercare, and similar programs which will 
never be supported by the market alone. In many situations, these needs and the 
programs that support them aren&rsquo;t exclusively served by one or the other. 
In fact, in many cases, we see the clear benefit in having both, working in 
partnership.</p> 
<p>A prime example of the investment-philanthropy partnership can be seen at 
St. John&rsquo;s Bread &amp; Life in Brooklyn, NY. Every day at St. 
John&rsquo;s more than 1,000 hungry Brooklyn children, families, and 
individuals receive nutritious meals. Recently theLow Income Investment Fund, a 
Calvert Foundation borrower for the last five years, provided a $7 million loan 
to enable St. John&rsquo;s to expand their facilities and serve a total of 
450,000 meals annually. Using a loan to fund St. John&rsquo;s space needs meant 
that more philanthropy was available to provide services to the recipients of 
the meals, like Naishaune Spencer (pictured right with his daughter). At St. 
John&rsquo;s, Naishaune receives nutritional counseling, health and hygiene 
products, and social services such as workforce development, literacy training, 
psychiatric services, and substance-abuse counseling. &ldquo;I ran with the 
wrong crowd and ended up homeless, jobless, and in a whole lot of 
trouble,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With the help of St. John&rsquo;s Bread &amp; 
life, loving family and friends, and sheer dedication, I was able to go back to 
school, get a great job, have a steady income and, most significantly, get my 
first apartment.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Traditional philanthropy and government programs, while critical to 
improving the lives of the poor, can never by themselves meet all the needs of 
disadvantaged communities. Impact investing offers a new way to bring capital 
to improving lives and a new way for people to connect with each other based on 
mutual benefit.</p> 
<p>At Calvert Foundation, our aim is to transform investment culture so that 
every investor becomes an impact investor. As a nonprofit, however, we 
recognize and value the vital role that philanthropy plays even within the 
impact investing sector, for things like risk capital and technical assistance 
for social entrepreneurs.</p> 
<p>I look forward to the day when we stop viewing philanthropy and impact 
investing as a Coke-or-Pepsi choice and start to see them for what they are: 
natural allies in the struggle to make the world a better place for ALL of us 
to live, work, raise our families, and perhaps have a little fun.</p> 
<p>As for soda, we all know Coke is it.</p> <br>

<h2>Keeping the Faith</h2> 
<p> Posted on December 28, 2011 by thea </p> <br>
<br>

<p><em>By Patrick Davis, Calvert Foundation Senior Associate.</em></p> 
<p>In November, after returning from the Resource Center for Religious 
Institutes (RCRI) Conference in St. Louis, I was moved to write about my 
experience forthe UnSectored blog. Now, a few weeks later, I wanted to share a 
version of that post with readers of Calvert Foundation&rsquo;s blog.</p> 
<p>RCRI is primarily a conference for religious treasurers to learn about 
developments in financial management that relate to their ministry. Not 
surprisingly, topics in Socially Responsible Investing are particularly 
prominent, and so I attended on behalf ofCalvert Foundation. There I was joined 
by many impact investing (or community investing) organizations including
Oikocredit, Partners for the Common Good, Leviticus Fund, Hope Enterprise 
Corporation, Urban Partnership Bank, and Mercy Loan Fund, among others.</p> 
<p>I was fortunate enough to spend some time with many great people, but I 
especially appreciated the chance to reconnect with two nuns that I&rsquo;ve 
worked with previously. Sister Pam Buganski of theSisters of Notre Dame and 
Sister Corinne Florek of theReligious Communities Investment Fund are each 
forces of nature in their own right &ndash; inspiring, compassionate, tireless 
advocates for social justice&hellip;and new thinking in finance.Sister Corinne 
has been featured in this blog before, for her work using impact investing 
principles to care for retired nuns while supporting people in underserved 
communities</p> 
<p>My conversations with the sisters reminded me of the faith 
community&rsquo;s special and often unrecognized place in the development of 
what we now call impact investing. More than 30 years ago, faith-based 
investors began to point to scripture as a basis for moving real assets into 
the community development space. In fact, the faith community provided critical 
seed funding that jump-started countless community loan funds and microfinance 
institutions that we know well today. For more background, check out the
Community Investing Toolkit for the Faith Community report from the Social 
Investment Forum Foundation.</p> 
<p>Congregations and religious retirement funds continue to be some of the 
most significant contributors to impact investing institutions, and this 
commitment to social justice through investment was established decades prior 
to the current excitement about impact investing. As an industry, impact 
investing cannot realize its vision without understanding its roots. Faith 
communities have continued to support the industry when it&rsquo;s been 
difficult, unpopular, or in glaring contradiction to the prevailing financial 
philosophies of the day.</p> 
<p>Flying home from RCRI, I found myself reflecting on the recent buzz around 
impact investing. The industry has attracted interest from a wide range of 
institutions &ndash; some are drawn to impact investing because they believe in 
the potential for market-beating returns in the long run, others because it 
allows for the integration of social or environmental values in investment 
portfolios. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the impact investing 
movement is that serves such a wide spectrum of beliefs and values, and as 
such, transcends common political, religious, and social boundaries.</p> 
<p>In the melting pot of all those beliefs and values, though, there have been 
only a handful of steadfast supporters. In our culture, we approach hot new 
things with both enthusiasm and trepidation. As it was described to me 
recently, everyone wants to be the &ldquo;first second&rdquo; adopter of a new 
behavior. When it comes to impact investing, the faith community has been quite 
the opposite &ndash; jumping in with both feet. With values systems firmly 
rooted in concepts of equity and social justice, faith-based institutions have 
contributed enormously to the development of the impact investing industry. 
Personally, I&rsquo;m deeply grateful to Sister Pam, Sister Corrine, and the 
countless other supporters of our work that I get to see each year at RCRI. In 
years to come, I hope that our supporters in the faith community earn as much 
benefit from their investment as we have from their involvement.</p> <br>
