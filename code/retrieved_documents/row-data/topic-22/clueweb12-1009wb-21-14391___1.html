<h2>&quot;Is Pepsi okay?&quot; No. No, it isn't. Ever.</h2> 
<p>I&nbsp;drink Diet Dr. Pepper. If Diet Dr. Pepper isn't available at a 
restaurant, I order Diet Coke. Neither are as good as regular Dr. Pepper, 
I&nbsp;know, but I have to watch my girlish figure. Those of you who ask for 
Diet Coke at a restaurant that doesn't sell Diet Coke are bound to have heard 
this timid question upon ordering:&nbsp;&quot;Is Pepsi okay?&quot; I'll relate 
this to the Web later, but first, allow me to rant.</p> 
<p>There are a few restaurants near the HCK2 offices where I'm asked this 
question. I&nbsp;repeatedly forget they don't carry Coke products, and when I 
hear the Pepsi question, I just wince and say, &quot;No thanks, I'll have iced 
tea.&quot; This question isn't a dealbreaker for me and the restaurants&mdash;I 
frequent those places mainly for the food they serve.</p> 
<p>However, this is a dealbreaker for me and Pepsi.</p> 
<p>I&nbsp;get why this situation exists. It's contractual. As a restaurant 
owner, you choose Pepsi or Coke products&mdash;in doing so, you get the perks 
offered by one supplier, spend less on product, take fewer deliveries. I get 
it. So why do I have a bias against Pepsi?</p> 
<p>It's a question of serving your audience. Pepsi holds about 30% of the 
fountain drink market. This is why fewer of you hear the question, &quot;Is 
Coke okay?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Well, Benji,&quot;&nbsp;you might ask, &quot;shouldn't you be 
frustrated with Coca-Cola as well, if they do the same thing?&quot;</p> 
<p>Nope.</p> 
<p>If Coke holds such a vast majority share of the market, they are in a 
position of privilege. More people will naturally order their products at a 
restaurant and therefore Coke has the muscle to approach these places with 
contracts for exclusivity. Whether this is abuse of privilege or just a smart 
tactic to maintain market share is up for debate.</p> 
<p>&quot;Is Pepsi okay?&quot;&nbsp;The question, when I hear it from the voice 
of a server, is always tinged with the expectation of refusal. 
&quot;I&nbsp;hate to disappoint you, and I know you will be disappointed, but I 
have to ask if Pepsi is okay since we don't sell the product you asked 
for.&quot; This is because they know from experience only a third of you want 
Pepsi in the first place.</p> 
<p>If Pepsi wants to increase its market share, contractual exclusivity is not 
the way to do it. The company puts themselves in a position of constantly 
disappointing the people they consider to be potential customers. This 
restriction is not the way to win over the public. Then again, look at the 
Pepsi logo... they don't have a history of implementing ideas that people love.
</p> 
<p>So, let me relate this to the Web. In my example above, there are three 
parties:&nbsp;the supplier, the restaurant, and the patrons. By only choosing 
to serve Pepsi, a restaurant is making itself and the supplier happy, but 
wholly ignoring the satisfaction of its patrons, the people who keep the 
restaurant in business to begin with.</p> 
<p>In the Web industry, we have clients, Web firms, and audiences. All too 
often, a client and Web firm will team up to launch a site that only makes the 
client and Web firm happy, but then completely ignores the needs of the 
audience. Then suddenly, the client is surprised that 70% of its audience is 
pissed off or unsatisfied.</p> 
<p>A good Web firm works for the audience. Everything a client tells its 
agency should be questioned, not out of disrespect for the client, but out of 
respect for the audience. A good Web firm will remain objective and often 
flat-out disagree with the assessments of its own clients because it knows Web 
sites exist for the people that visit them, not for the people that 
commission&mdash;or design&mdash;them.</p> 
<p>The success of a project, and of a client, depends first and foremost on 
how successfully the audience needs are addressed. It isn't about what you want 
to serve. It's about what your patrons want to drink.</p>

<p>Coke has the worst customer server and are known for it throughout the 
restaurant industry. I have two restaurants and everything single day, I think 
about somehow getting rid of these idiots who can't do simple things like take 
your order and deliver it. On top of that, the price is different is more then 
half the invoices that are left behind by the driver. If you call them, and 
when/if they return your call then eventually you get the new invoice along 
with a notice of payment. Pepsi on the other hand has a much better reputation 
and Mountain Due is a big big seller but their diet sodas are crap! Pepsi is 
more popular around the world but in the US, coke is taking advantage of being 
number one which is awfully painful for vendors.</p> </li>

<p>Speaking of Pepsi vs. Coke, Ad Age just wrote about Pepsi's new 2.5-minute 
&quot;Oh Africa&quot; World Cup ad. Even though Coke is the official sponsor of 
the World Cup, Pepsi has beaten them to the punch. Pepsi's new strategy is all 
viral and social. But, according to Ad Age, it won't be cheap - just like all 
the money they spent on their new branding not too long ago. Check it out:
