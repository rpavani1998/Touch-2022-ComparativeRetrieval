<h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4> 
<p>In the modern urban culture consumption of soft drinks particularly among 
younger generation has become very popular. Soft drinks in various flavors and 
tastes are widely patronized by urbane population at various occasions like 
dinner parties, marriages, social get together, birthday calibration etc. 
children of all ages and groups are especially attracted by the mere mention of 
the word soft drinks.</p> 
<p>With the growing popularity of soft drinks, the technology of its 
production, preservation, transportation and or marketing in the recent years 
has witnessed phenomenal changes. The so-called competition for this product in 
the market is from different other brands. Mass media, particularly the 
emergence of television, has contribute to a large extent of the ever growing 
demand for soft drinks the attractive jingles and sport make the large audience 
remember this product at all times.</p> 
<p>It is expected that with the sort of mass advertising, reaching almost the 
entire country and offering various varieties annual demand for the product is 
expected to rise sharply in the times to come.</p> 
<p>In any marketing situation, the behavioral / environmental variables 
relating to consumers, competition and environment are constantly influx. The 
competitors in a given industry may be making many tactical maneuvers in market 
all the time. The may introduce or initiate an aggressive promotion campaign or 
announce a price reduction. The marketing man of the firm has to meet all these 
maneuver and care of competitive position of his firm and his brand in the 
market. The only route open to him for achieving this is the manipulation of 
his marketing tactics.</p> 
<p>In today's highly competitive market place, three players have dominated 
the industry; The New York based Pepsi Company Inc. The Atlanta based coca- 
cola and U.K. based Cadbury Schweppes.</p> 
<p>Through the globe, these major players have been battling it out for a 
bigger chunk of the ever-growing soft drink market. Now this battle has been 
evolved up to India too with the arrival of these three giants.</p> 
<p>Soft drink industry is on amazing growth; ultimately these are only one 
person who will determine their fortunes. The Indian consumer the real War to 
quench his thirst has just begun.</p> 
<h4>SOFT DRINK INDUSTRY: AN OVERVIEW</h4> 
<p>It all began in 1886, when a tree legged brass kettle in Hohn Styth 
pemberton's backyard in Atlanta was brewing the first P of marketing legeent 
Unaware the pharmacist has given birth to a caramel colored syrup, which is now 
the chief ingredient of the world's favorite drink. The syrup combined with 
carbonated the soft drink market. It is estimated that this drink is served 
more than one thousand million times in a day.</p> 
<p>Equally oblivious to the historic value of his actions was Frank Ix. 
Robinson, his partner and book keeper. Pemberton &amp; Robinson laid the first 
foundation of this beverage when an average nine drinks per day to begin with, 
upping volumes as sales grew.</p> 
<p>In 1894, this beverage got into bottle, courtesy a candy merchant from 
Mississippi. By the 1950's Colas was a daily consumption item, stored in house 
hold fridges. Soon were born other non- cola variants of this product like 
orange &amp; Lemon.</p> 
<p>Now, the soft drink industry has been dominated by three major player - (1) 
The New York based Pepsi co. Inc.(2) The Atlanta based coca cola co. (3) The 
united Kingdom based Cadbury Schweppes.</p> 
<p>Though out the glove these major players have been battling it. Out for a 
bigger chunk of the ever-growing cold drink market. Now this battle has begun 
in India too. India is now the part of cold drink war. Gone are days of Ramesh 
Chauhan, India's one time cola king and his bouts of pistol shooting. Expect 
now to hear the boon of cannons when the Coca Cola &amp; Pepsi co. battles it 
out for, as the Jordon goes a bigger share of throat. By buying Over local 
competition, the two American Cola giants have cleared up the arena and are 
packing all their power behind building the Indian franchisee of their globe 
girdling brands. The huge amount invested in fracture has never been seen 
before. Both players seen an enormous potential in his country where swigging a 
carbonated beverage is still considered a treat, virtually a luxury. 
Consequently, by world standards India's per capita consumption of cold drinks 
as going by survey results is rock bottom, less than over Neighbors Pakistan 
&amp; Bangladesh, where it is four times as much.</p> 
<p>Behind the hype, in an effort invisible to consumer Pepsi pumps in Rs 3000 
crores (1994) to add muscle to its infrastructure in bottling and distribution. 
This is apart from money that company's franchised bottles spend in upgrading 
their plants all this has contributed to substantial gains in the market. In 
colas, Pepsi is already market leader and in certain cities like Banaras, Pepsi 
outlets are on one side &amp; all the other colas put together on the other. 
While coke executive scruff at Pepsi's claims as well as targets, industry 
observers are of the view that Pepsi has definitely stolen a march over its 
competitor coke. Apart from numbers, Pepsi has made qualitative gains. The 
foremost is its image. This image turnaround is no small achievements, 
considering that since it was established in 1989, taking the hardship route 
prior to liberalization and weighed down by export commitments.</p> 
<p>Now, at present as there are three major players coke, Pepsi and Cadbury 
and there is stiff competition between first two, both Pepsi and coke have 
started, sponsoring local events and staging frequent consumer promotion 
campaigns. As the mega event of this century has started, and the marketers are 
using this event - world cup football, cricket events and many more other 
events.</p> 
<p>Like Pepsi, coke is picking up equity in its bottles to guarantee their 
financial support; one side coke is trying to increase its popularity through.
</p> 
<p>Eat Food, enjoy Food. Drink only coca cola. Eat cricket, sleep cricket. 
Drink only coca cola. Eat movies, sleep movies. Drink only coca cola.</p> 
<p>On the other side of coin Pepsi has introduced AMITABH BACHHAN for 
capturing the lemon market through MIRINDA - Lemon with &quot;zor ka jhatka 
dhere se lage&quot;. But no doubt' that UK based Cadbury is also recognizing 
its presence. So there is a real crush in the soft drink market. with launch of 
the carbonated organize drink Crush, few year ago in Banaras ., the first in a 
series of a launches , Cadbury Schweppes beverage India (CSBI) HAS PLANNED:- 
The world third largest soft drink marketers all over the country.CSBI o wholly 
owned subsidiary of the London based $ 6.52billion. Cadbury Schweppes is hoping 
that crush is going well and well not suffer the same fate as the Rs. 175 crore 
Cadbury India's apple drink Apella. CSBI is now with orange (crush), and 
Schweppes soda in the market.</p> 
<p>As orange drinks are the smallest of non-cola categories that is Rs. 1100 
crore markets with 10% market share and cola heaving 50% is followed by Lemon 
segment with 25%.</p> 
<p>The success of soft drink industry depends upon 4 major factors viz.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Availability</li> 
<li>Visibility</li> 
<li>Cooling</li> 
<li>Range</li> </ul> 
<h4>AVAILABILITY</h4> 
<p>Availability means the presence of a particular brand at any outlet. If a 
product is now available at any outlet and the competitor brand is available, 
the consumer will go for it because generally the consumption of any soft drink 
is an impulse decision and not predetermined one.</p> 
<h4>VISIBILITY</h4> 
<p>Visibility is the presence felt, if any outlet has a particular brand of 
soft drink say- Pepsi cola and this brand is not displayed in the outlet, then 
its availability is of no use. The soft drink must be shown off properly and 
attractively so as to catch the attention of the consumer immediately Pepsi 
achieves visibility by providing glow signboards, hoarding, calendars etc. to 
the outlets. It also includes various stands to display Pepsi and other flavors 
of the company.</p> 
<h4>COOLING</h4> 
<p>As the soft drinks are consumed chilled so cooling them plays a vital role 
in boosting up the sales. The brand, which is available chilled, gets more 
sales then the one which is not, even if it is more preferred one.</p> 
<h4>RANGE</h4> 
<p>This is the last but not the least factor, which affects the sale of the 
products of a particular company.</p> 
<p>Range availability means the availability of all flavors in all sizes.</p> 
<h4>HISTORY OF COCA-COLA</h4> 
<p>Jon Styth Pemberton first introduced the refreshing taste of Coca-Cola in 
Atlanta, Georgia it was May 1861 when the pharmacist concocted caramel colored 
syrup in three- legged brass kettle in his backyard. He first distributed the 
new product by carrying Coca-Cola in a jug coin enjoys in a glass of Coca-Cola 
at the soda fountain. Whether by design or accident, carbonated water was 
teamed with the new syrup, producing a drink that was proclaimed 
&quot;Delicious and Refreshing&quot;.</p> 
<p>Dr. Pemberton's Partner and bookkeeper, Mr. Frank Robinson, suggested the 
name and penned as &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; in the unique flowing script that is 
still famous worldwide today.</p> 
<p>Dr. Pemberton's sold 25 gallons of syrup, shipped in bright Red wooden 
kegs. Red has been a distinctive color associated with the No.1 soft drink 
brand ever since. For his efforts, Dr. Pemberton grossed $ 50 and spent $ 73.96 
on advertising, by 1891, Atlanta chemist as a G.Canler had acquired complete 
ownership of the Coca-Cola business.</p> 
<p>He purchases it from the Dr.Pemberton family for $ 2300. With in 4 year his 
merchandising flair helped to expand the consumption of Coca-Cola to over $25 
million. Robert W. woodruff become the president of the Coca-Cola company in 
1923 and his more than six decades of leadership took the business of 
commercial success making Coca-Cola an institution the world over. Coca-Cola 
begins as a never tonic, but candy merchant Joseph A. Biedenharn of Mississippi 
was looking for awry to serve refreshing beverages. He responded to this demand 
began offering bottle Coca-Cola using syrup shipped from Atlanta, during a hot 
summer in 1894.</p> 
<h4>1894 ... A modest start for a bold idea</h4> 
<p>In a candy store in Vicksburg, Mississippi, brisk sales of the new fountain 
beverage called Coca-Cola impressed the store's owner, Joseph A. Biedenharn. He 
began bottling Coca-Cola to sell, using a common glass bottle called a 
Hutchinson. Biedenharn sent a case to Asa Griggs Candler, who owned the 
Company. Candler thanked him but took no action. One of his nephews already had 
urged that Coca-Cola be bottled, but Candler focused on fountain sales.</p> 
<h4>1899 ... The first bottling agreement</h4> 
<p>Two young attorneys from Chattanooga, Tennessee believed they could build a 
business around bottling Coca-Cola. In a meeting with Candler, Benjamin F. 
Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead obtained exclusive rights to bottle Coca-Cola 
across most of the United States (specifically excluding Vicksburg) - for the 
sum of one dollar. A third Chattanooga lawyer, John T. Lupton, soon joined 
their venture.</p> 
<h4>1900-1909 ... Rapid growth</h4> 
<p>The three pioneer bottlers divided the country into territories and sold 
bottling rights to local entrepreneurs. Their efforts were boosted by major 
progress in bottling technology, which improved efficiency and product quality. 
By 1909, nearly 400 Coca-Cola bottling plants were operating, most of them 
family-owned businesses. Some were open only during hot-weather months when 
demand was high.</p> 
<h4>1920s ... Bottling overtakes fountain sales</h4> 
<p>As the 1920s dawned, more than 1,000 Coca-Cola bottlers were operating in 
the U.S. Their ideas and zeal fueled steady growth. Six-bottle cartons were a 
huge hit after their 1923 introduction. A few years later, open-top metal 
coolers became the forerunners of automated vending machines. By the end of the 
1920s, bottle sales of Coca-Cola exceeded fountain sales.</p> 
<h4>1920s and 30s ... International expansion</h4> 
<p>Led by longtime Company leader Robert W. Woodruff, chief executive officer 
and chairman of the Board, the Company began a major push to establish bottling 
operations outside the U.S. Plants were opened in France, Guatemala, Honduras, 
Mexico, Belgium, Italy, Peru, Spain, Australia and South Africa. By the time 
World War II began, Coca- Cola was being bottled in 44 countries.</p> 
<h4>1940s ... Post-war growth</h4> 
<p>During the war, 64 bottling plants were set up around the world to supply 
the troops. This followed an urgent request for bottling equipment and 
materials from General Eisenhower's base in North Africa. Many of these 
war-time plants were later converted to civilian use, permanently enlarging the 
bottling system and accelerating the growth of the Company's worldwide business.
</p> 
<h4>1960s ... New brands introduced</h4> 
<p>Following Fanta in the 1950s, Sprite, Minute Maid, Fresca and TaB joined 
brand Coca-Cola in the 1960s. Mr. Pibb and Mello Yello was added in the 1970s. 
The 1980s brought diet Coke and Cherry Coke, followed by POWERADE and DASANI in 
the 1990s. Today hundreds of other brands are offered to meet consumer 
preferences in local markets around the world.</p> 
<h4>1970s and 80s ... Consolidation to serve customers</h4> 
<p>As technology led to a global economy, the retailers who sold Coca-Cola 
merged and evolved into international mega-chains. Such customers required a 
new approach. In response, many small and medium-size bottlers consolidated to 
better serve giant international customers. The Company encouraged and invested 
in a number of bottler consolidations to assure that its largest bottling 
partners would have capacity to lead the system in working with global 
retailers.</p> 
<h4>1990s ... New and growing markets</h4> 
<p>Political and economic changes opened vast markets that were closed or 
underdeveloped for decades. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Company 
invested heavily to build plants in Eastern Europe. And as the century closed, 
more than $1.5 billion was committed to new bottling facilities in Africa.</p> 
<h4>21st Century ...</h4> 
<p>The Coca-Cola bottling system grew up with roots deeply planted in local 
communities. This heritage serves the Company well today as people seek brands 
that honor local identity and the distinctiveness of local markets. As was true 
a century ago, strong locally based relationships between Coca-Cola bottlers, 
customers and communities are the foundation on which the entire business grows.

PepsiCo is a world leader in convenient snacks, foods and beverages with

through our past and see the key milestones that define PepsiCo.</p> 
<p>PepsiCo is a world leader in the food chain business. It consists of many 
companies amongst which the prominent once are Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay and Pepsi 
Food International. The group is presently into two of the most profitable and 
profitable and growing industries namely, beverages and snack foods. It has 
scores of big brands available in nearly 150 countries across the globe. The 
group has established for itself once of the strongest brands in various 
segments of its operations.</p> 
<p>The beverages segment primarily markets its Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew 
and other brands worldwide and 7-UP outside the U.S. markets. These are 
positioned in close competition with Coca-Cola Inc. of USA. A point which is 
worth a mention is that Coca- Cola gets 80% of its profits for International

goods company comprised of Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay will continue to 
bear the PepsiCo name. The move should enhance both corporations ability to

<h4>PEPSICO IN INDIA</h4> 
<p>PepsiCo gained entry to India in 1988 by creating a joint venture with the 
Punjab government-owned Punjab Agro Industrial Corporation (PAIC) and Voltas 
India Limited. This joint venture marketed and sold Lehar Pepsi until 1991, 
when the use of foreign brands was allowed; PepsiCo bought out its partners and 
ended the joint venture in 1994. Others claim that firstly Pepsi was banned 
from import in India, in 1970, for having refused to release the list of its 
ingredients and in 1993, the ban was lifted, with Pepsi arriving on the market 
shortly afterwards. These controversies are a reminder of &quot;India's 
sometimes acrimonious relationship with huge multinational companies.&quot; 
Indeed, some argue that PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company have &quot;been major 
targets in part because they are well-known foreign companies that draw plenty 
of attention.&quot;</p> 
<p>In 2003, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a non-governmental 
organization in New Delhi, said aerated waters produced by soft drinks 
manufacturers in India, including multinational giants PepsiCo and The 
Coca-Cola Company, contained toxins, including lindane, DDT, malathion and 
chlorpyrifos pesticides that can contribute to cancer, a breakdown of the 
immune system and cause birth defects. Tested products included Coke, Pepsi, 7 
Up, Miranda, Fanta, Thumps Up, Limca, and Sprite. CSE found that the 
Indian-produced Pepsi's soft drink products had 36 times the level of pesticide 
residues permitted under European Union regulations; Coca Cola's 30 times. CSE 
said it had tested the same products in the US and found no such residues. 
However, this was the European standard for water, not for other drinks. No law 
bans the presence of pesticides in drinks in India.</p> 
<p>The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo angrily denied allegations that their 
products manufactured in India contained toxin levels far above the norms 
permitted in the developed world. But an Indian parliamentary committee, in 
2004, backed up CSE's findings and a government-appointed committee, is now 
trying to develop the world's first pesticides standards for soft drinks. Coke 
and PepsiCo opposed the move, arguing that lab tests aren't reliable enough to 
detect minute traces of pesticides in complex drinks.</p> 
<p>As of 2005, The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo together hold 95% market 
share of soft-drink sales in India. PepsiCo has also been accused by the 
Puthussery panchayat in the Palakkad district in Kerala, India, of practicing 
&quot;water piracy&quot; due to its role in exploitation of ground water 
resources resulting in scarcity of drinking water for the panchayat residents, 
who have been pressuring the government to close down the PepsiCo unit in the 
village.</p> 
<p>In 2006, the CSE again found that soda drinks, including both Pepsi and 
Coca-Cola, had high levels of pesticides in their drinks. Both PepsiCo and The 
Coca-Cola Company maintain that their drinks are safe for consumption and have 
published newspaper advertisements that say pesticide levels in their products 
are less than those in other foods such as tea, fruit and dairy products. In 
the Indian state of Kerala, sale and production of Pepsi-Cola, along with other 
soft drinks, was banned by the state government in 2006, but this was reversed 
by the Kerala High Court merely a month later. Five other Indian states have 
announced partial bans on the drinks in schools, colleges and hospitals.</p>

<h4>BRAND HISTORY</h4> 
<p>Pepsi is a hundred year old brand loved by over 200 million people 
worldwide. The largest single selling soft drink brand in India is the 
ubiquitous'socialiser'at every occasion.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Youngistan loves it. 200 million people worldwide love it. But what has 
made Pepsi the single largest selling soft drink brand in India is actually a 
formula concocted a century ago in a far away continent.</li> 
<li>1886, United States of America. Caleb Brad man, the man with a plan, got 
on to formulate a blockbuster digestive drink and decided to call it Brad's 
drink. It was this doctor's potion that was to become Pepsi Cola in 1898, and 
eventually, Pepsi in 1903.</li> 
<li>Pepsi has always played on the front foot and since its inception has come 
out with revolutionary concepts like Diet, 2L bottles, recyclable plastic cola 
bottles and the enviable My Can.</li> </ul>

<h4>THE RIVARLY BEGINS:</h4> 
<h4>Coke Comes to India</h4> 
<p>Coca-Cola comes to India with fanfare in the fifties. For a number of days, 
The Hindustan Times and other newspapers of New Banaras carried full page 
advertisement showing a big boy in uniform with a soft-drink crown as the cap. 
There was no indication of the product. After a few days, Coke was introduced. 
It was an entirely new drink which fascinated people. It soon became the 
national drink. For the first time, a soft-drink was available from one corner 
of the country to another. The person who brought Coca- Cola to India was the 
father of late Sardar Charanjit Singh, Sardar Mohan Singh. A practical man 
Mohan Singh realized that to popularize Coca-Cola, and make it a best seller it 
was necessary to &quot;catch them young.&quot; So he focused on youngsters in 
the society. The company realized that to become a mass consumption product, 
one has to go to the village. They gave much importance to the distributive 
network. The company trucks supplied coke to even the remotest village.</p> 
<p>Few products appears to be more similar than soft drinks, yet the Cola wars 
that mark the competition between Coke and Pepsi show how even organizations 
with highly similar product can be differentiated by their business strategies. 
Then comes battles over the issue of bottle size standardization. Coke the arch 
rival tried to offering more Cola at a lower price. Pepsi which had some of its 
early investment tied up in 250ml bottles, went the fountain way. The General 
bottle size freed has settled at 300 ml. 100 ml more than the pre MNC standard. 
Fountain mix dispensers, carry home bottles, even 1.50 plastic bottle with caps 
good enough to keep them lying down and still preserve the fizz.</p> 
<p>It poured in vast sums to whip up its visibility at the retail level, so 
that consumers were greeted virtually at every street corner by Pepsi's blue, 
red and white colors, because they have perception &quot;the thing on display 
Sells more.&quot; Coca-Cola is, finally, redoing the real thing to the 
replicate the success that it's arch-rival, PepsiCo. Has achieved with its fast 
and furious marketing. But to win them, Coke is copying Pepsi.</p> 
<h4>MARKETING STATEGIES OF COKE AND PEPSI</h4> 
<h4>PRODUCT</h4> 
<p>Coke was launched in India in Agra, October 24, in '93', soon after its 
traditional all Indian launch of its Cola. At the sparking new bottling plants 
at Hathra, near Agra. Coke was back with a bang after its exit in 1977.</p> 
<p>Coke was planning to launch in next summer the orange drink, Fanta-with the 
clear lemon drink, sprite, following later in the year.</p> 
<p>Coke already owns more brands than it will over need, since it has bought 
out Ramesh Chauhan. Coke just needs to juggle these brands around dextrously to 
meet its objectives, to ensure that Pepsi does not gain market share in t 
Today, Coke's product line includes, Coca-Cola, Thumps Up, Fanta, Gold Spot, 
Maaza, Citra, Sprite, Bisleri Club Soda and Diet Coke.</p> 
<h4>PACKAGING</h4> 
<p>Coca-Cola India Limited (CCIL) has bottled its Cola drink in different 
sizes and different packaging i.e., 200 ml bottle, 300 ml. Bottle, 330 ml. 
Cans, 500 ml. Bottle fountain Pepsi, and bottles of 1 and 2 litre.</p> 
<h4>PRODUCT POSITIONING</h4> 
<p>One important thing must be noticed that Thumps Up is a strong brand in 
western and southern India, while Coca Cola is strong in Northern and Eastern 
India. With volumes of Thumps Up being low in the capital, there are likely 
chances of Coca Cola slashing the prices of Thumps Up to Rs. 5 and continue to 
sell Coca Cola at the same rate. Analysts feel that this strategy may help Coke 
since it has 2 Cola brands in comparison to Pepsi which has just one.</p> 
<p>Thumps Up accounts for 40% of Coca Cola company's turn over, followed by 
Coca Cola which has a 23% share and Limca which accounts for 17% of the turn 
over of the company. (Thumps up being the local drink, its share in the market 
is intact, forcing the company to service the brand, as it did last year Mr. 
Donald short CEO, Coca Cola India, said that, &quot; we will be absolutely 
comfortable if Thumps Up is No. 1 brand for us in India in the year 2000. We 
will sell whatever consumers want us to&quot;. Coca Cola India has positioned 
Thumps up as a beverage associated with adventure because of its strong taste 
and also making it compete with Pepsi as even Pepsi is associated with 
adventure, youth.</p> 
<h4>PRICE</h4> 
<p>The price being fixed by industry, leaving very little role for the players 
to play in the setting of the price, in turn making it difficult for 
competitors to compete on the basis of price.</p> 
<p>The fixed cost structure in Carbonated Soft Drinks Industry, and the 
intense competition make it very difficult to change or alter the prices. The 
various costs incurred by the individual company's are almost unavoidable. 
These being the costs of concentrates, standard bottling operations, 
distributor and bottlers commissions, distribution expenses and the promotional 
and advertising expenditure (As far as Coke is concerned, it had to incur a 
little more than Pepsi as Pepsi paved its way to India in 1989 while Coke made 
a come back in 1993.)</p> 
<p>Currently a 300 ml. Coke bottle is available for Rs. 6 to8 The 330 can was 
initially available for Rs. 13 and now, since the price has gave up to Rs. 18 
per can. The prices of 500 m, 1 litre. And 2ltr being Rs. 15 Rs. 23 and Rs. 40 
respectively (according to the current survey).</p> 
<p>Dating back to '93', when Pepsi hiked the price of Pepsi - Cola from Rs. 5 
to Rs. 6 per 250 ml. bottle in some parts of the country-including Agra. Coke 
penetrated the market with price of Rs. 5 for a 300 ml. bottle, making it 
cheaper by Rs. 1 and 50 ml. than Pepsi. Coke's strategy at that time being able 
to expand the availability of soft drinks even in rural India. Coke's priority 
being to first increase the number of drinks per drinker, and then the number 
of drinkers itself. Pepsi also tried this but was trapped by a series of 
competitive price increase and changes in bottle sizes by Parle. But the prices 
of soft drinks have shot up since Pepsi's arrival and the current prices are 
being mentioned as under.</p> 
<h4>Price list</h4> 
<p>Name Bottle Size MRP (in Rs.)</p> 
<p>Coke Per Bottle 200 ml 6</p> 
<p>Coke 300 ml 10</p> 
<p>Coke 500 ml (Plastic / Glass) 22</p> 
<p>Coke 2 litre 60</p> 
<p>Diet Coke (Can) 330 ml Can 35</p> 
<p>Coke (Can) 330 ml Can 38</p> 
<p>However, the trends may have been in the early '90's, now the prices of 
Pepsi and Coke are the same making it difficult in future and present to 
compete on the basis of price.</p> 
<h4>PLACE</h4> 
<p>Coke may have gained an early advantage over Pepsi since it took over Parle 
in 1994. Hence, it had ready access to over 2, 00,000 retailer outlets and 60 
bottlers. Coke was had a better distribution network, owing to the wide network 
of Parle drinks all over India. Coke has further expanded its distribution 
network.</p> 
<p>Coke and its product were available in over 2, 50,000 outlets (in contrast 
with Pepsi's 2, 00,000). Coke has a greater advantage in terms of geographical 
coverage.</p> 
<p>But Coke has had problems with its bottlers as the required profits for the 
bottlers have not been forthcoming. This is more so because Coke has hiked the 
price of its concentrate by Rs. 8 Further, Coke's operations in India are 100% 
Fobs. Now, it plans to convert then into COBOs. This is straining the 
relationship between the Coke and its bottlers.</p> 
<p>The company had decided to create a fund to reimburse performing bottlers 
for the extra costs incurred on account of the hike in prices of soft drink 
concentrates. Mr. Short also realized that India is a price sensitive market 
and the company would have to absorb in the increase in excise duty and said 
that in the long run Coke will have to slash prices for the benefit of the 
consumers and said that they were considering a cut in the prices of their 
fountain soft drinks.</p> 
<p>Coke and Pepsi have devised strategies to get rid of middlemen in the 
distribution network. However, 50% of the industry unfortunately depends on 
these middlemen. As of now, around 100 agents are present in Bananas. Bottlers 
of the 2 multinationals have strongly felt the need to remove these middlemen 
from the distribution system, but very little success has been achieved in 
doing so.</p> 
<h4>PROMOTION</h4> 
<p>It must be remembered that soft drinks purchases are an &quot;impulse buy 
low involvement products&quot; which makes promotion and advertising an 
important marketing tool. The 2 arch rivals have spent a lot on advertising and 
on promotional activities.</p> 
<p>To promote a brand and even to spend a lot on advertising, the company must 
be aware of the perceived quality of the brand, its brand power (if at all 
there is) since consumers make purchase decision based on their perceptions of 
value i.e., of quality relative to price.</p> 
<p>According to Paul Stobart, Advertising encourages customers to recognize 
the quality the company offers. Price promotions often produce short-term sales 
increases. Coca Cola has entered new markets and also developing market 
economics (like India) with much-needed jobs.</p> 
<p>Coke attributes its success to bottlers, the Coca Cola system itself, i.e., 
its executive committees, employees, BOD, company presidents but above all from 
the consumer.</p> 
<p>Coke's red color catches attention easily and also the Diet Coke which it 
introduced was taking the Cake, as Pepsi has not come out with this in India. 
Ever since Coke's entry in India in 1993, Coke made a come back (after quitting 
in 1977), in October 24 in Agra, the city was flooded by trucks, there 
wheelers, tricycle cards-all with huge red Coke-emblazoned umbrellas. Retailers 
were displaying their Coke bottles in distinctive racks, also with 
specially-designed iceboxes to keep Coke bottles cold. This was one big jolt to 
Pepsi.</p> 
<h4>STRATEGIES ADOPTED</h4> 
<h4>BY COKE AND PEPSI</h4> 
<p>The Pepsi Process: Despite being a global brand, Pepsi has built its 
success on meeting the Indian consumer's needs, particularly in terms of making 
the brand synchronize with localized events and traditions. Instead of harping 
on its global lineage, ergo, it tries to plug into ethnic festivals, use the 
vernacular indifferent part of the country, and blend into the local fabric. 
Pepsi is using both national campaigns-such as the Drink Pepsi, Get Stuff 
scheme, which offers large discounts on other products to Pepsi-buyers as well 
as local.</p> 
<p>The Coke Copy: Instead of creating a bond with the customers through small 
but high-impact events, Coca-Cola chose to associate itself with national and 
international mega events like the World Cup Cricket, 1996, and world cup 
football 1998. But now coke is also entering into local actions. Coke is also 
trying to make their brand synchronize with localized events traditions and 
festivals. Coca-Cola new tag line in this advertisement is &quot;Real shopping, 
real refresher&quot;. In this way Coke is copy Pepsi.</p> 
<h4>EMPOWERMENT</h4> 
<p>The Pepsi Process: Once of the strongest weapons in Pepsi's armory is the 
flexibility it has empowered its people with. Every manager and salesperson has 
the authority to take whatever steps he, or she, feels will make consumers 
aware of the brand and increase its consumption.</p> 
<p>The Coke Copy : Flexibility is the weapon that Coca-Cola, fettered as it is 
by the need for approvals from Atlanta for almost everything. In the past, this 
has shown up in its stubborn insistence on junking the franchisee network it 
had acquired from Parle; in its dependence on its own feedback mechanism over 
that of its bottlers;' and on its headquarters-led approach.</p> 
<h4>PRICE</h4> 
<p>The Pepsi process: Pepsi has consistently wielded its pricing strategy as 
in invitation to sample, aiming to turn trial into addiction.</p> 
<p>It launched the 500 ml bottle in 1994 at Rs. 8 versus Thumps Up's Rs. 9, in 
April, 1996, its 1.5 liters bottle followed Coke into the marketplace at Rs. 30 
- Rs 5 less than Coke's .But it couldn't continue the lower price positioning 
for long.</p> 
<p>The Coke Copy: Initially, coke carbon-copied the strategy by introducing 
its 330ml cans in January 1996, at an invitation price of Rs. 15 before raising 
it to Rs. 18. By this time, it had realized that the Coca-Cola brand did not 
hold enough attraction for customers to fork out a premium. The 200ml Coke, 
launched so far in parts of eastern, western, and northernIndia, is priced at 
Rs. 5, lowering the entry-barriers. Too really drive the market, as Coke wants 
to you must go down to Rs. 3'.</p>

<h4>COLA WARS</h4> 
<h4>Coca-cola v/s Pepsi</h4> 
<h4>OVER A CENTURY OF COLA SLOGANS, COMMERCIALS, BLUNDERS, AND COUPS</h4> 
<p>There's little doubt that the most spirited and intense competition in the 
beverage world is between Coca-Cola and Pepsi. These two American companies 
long ago took their battle worldwide, and although there are other colas in the 
market, these giants occupy this high-stakes arena by themselves. The impact of 
Coke and Pepsi on popular culture is indisputable, and I have observed in my 
time managing this web site that America has not become jaded about the cola 
wars. The memorabilia, the jingles, the trivia - all still popular. So I am 
offering this page in an attempt to assuage a wee bit of the Coke and Pepsi 
thirst that is thriving on our planet.</p> 
<h4>IT ALL STARTED . . . .</h4> 
<p>Coca-Cola was invented and first marketed in 1886, followed by Pepsi in 
1898. Coca- Cola was named after the coca leaves and kola nuts John Pemberton 
used to make it, and Pepsi after the beneficial effects its creator, Caleb Brad 
ham, claimed it had on dyspepsia. For many years, Coca-Cola had the cola market 
cornered. Pepsi was a distant, no threatening contender. But as the market got 
more and more lucrative, professional advertising became more and more 
important. These soda companies have been leading the way in advertising ever 
since.</p> 
<h4>ADVERTISING HISTORY &amp; COMMERCIALS</h4> 
<p>Pepsi has definitely leaned towards the appeal of celebrities, popular 
music, and young people in television commercials, while Coke relies more 
heavily on images of happiness and togetherness, tradition, and nationalism, 
perpetually trying to cash in on its original lead. In a simplified sense, you 
could sum up the strategies as Coke: Old, Pepsi: New. In fact, as we will see, 
when Coca-Cola tried something new, it was disaster.</p> 
<p>The first magazine ad for Coca-Cola appeared in Munsey's in 1902. 
Advertisements began to appear on billboards, newspapers, and streetcars. Soon 
there were serving trays with images of people enjoying Coca-Cola, and glasses 
with the cola's name on them. At this time, Coca-Cola and Pepsi were served in 
drugstore soda fountains.</p> 
<p>In 1909, Pepsi used its first celebrity endorser, automobile race driver 
Barney Old-field, in newspaper ads. In 1921, Pepsi went bankrupt, but continued 
to appear on the scene, although not nearly so successfully as Coca-Cola. In 
1931, Pepsi went bankrupt again, but the new owner, Roy Megargel, would hit 
upon an idea that would finally give Coca- Cola some competition. In 1934, he 
marketed Pepsi in a 12-ounce bottle for a nickel. At the time, Coca-Cola was 
sold in a 6-ounce bottle for ten cents. Voila! Profits for Pepsi. Pepsi racked 
up another first by airing the first radio jingle in 1939. It was so popular 
that it was played in jukeboxes and became a hit record Coca-Cola hit the 
airwaves in 1941. In 1946, inflation forced Pepsi to increase prices. And in 
1950, Pepsi offered a larger 26- ounce bottle to court the young American 
housewife.</p> 
<p>In the 1960's, the cola ad wars moved to television. Coca-Cola employed a 
host of celebrity singers to promote the product, including Connie Francis , 
Tom Jones, The New Beats, Nancy Sinatra, and The Supremes. As we moved through 
the years, both colas incorporated some of their best slogans (&quot;Pepsi 
Generation&quot; and &quot;the Real Thing&quot;) into subsequent commercials.
</p> 
<p>In the 1970s, market research showed that consumers preferred the taste of 
Pepsi over Coke. The Pepsi Challenge is still being conducted today. But Coke 
came up with what is arguably the best of all cola commercials, the 1971 I'd 
like to buy the World coke ad. This landmark was recalled in Christmas versions 
in 1983 and 1984, and a 1990 Super Bowl ad, which was enough to make some Baby 
Boomers weep with nostalgia.</p> 
<p>In the 1980's, Pepsi lined up the celebrities, starting with late Michael 
Jackson, then Madonna, Michael J. Fox, Billy Crystal, Lionel Ritchie, Gloria 
Stefan, Joe Montana, and others. Coke signed on Michael Jordan, New Kids on the 
Block, Aretha Franklin, Elton John, and Paula Abdul.</p> 
<p>In 1985, responding to the pressure of the Pepsi Challenge taste tests, 
which Pepsi always won, Coca-Cola decided to change its formula. Bill Cosby was 
the pitchman. This move set off a shock wave across America. Consumers angrily 
demanded that the old formula be returned, and Coca-Cola responded three months 
later with Classic Coke. Eventually, New Coke quietly disappeared.</p> 
<p>Pepsi, meanwhile, had its own flop, Crystal Pepsi, which was supposed to 
catch the strange wave of the times when everything colorless was clean and 
desirable (Zima, bottled water). And then there was Pepsi Lite with the lemony 
flavor and one calorie, introduced in 1975. Remember that one? Apparently they 
didn't expect us to because later they gave us Pepsi One, using the same 
concept, but a completely different taste. And, extending the idea even 
further, we are now getting Pepsi Twist, a new product with a twist of lemon 
flavor.</p> 
<p>In 1991, Ray Charles sang, &quot;You got the right one baby, uh-huh!&quot; 
Also in the 1990s, Cindy Crawford and the Spice Girls pitched Pepsi. And then 
Pepsi aired commercials featuring the aggravating little girl (Halide 
Eisenberg) with her troubling male voice. In the new century, both colas 
continue to battle it out on the television screen. And celebrities continue to 
be important promoters. Recently, Pepsi has had commercials by Bob Dole and 
Faith Hill, among others.</p> 
<h4>SLOGANS</h4> 
<p>It's clear in looking at the slogans over the years that Coke and Pepsi 
have very different targeting strategies. Coke is touting itself as the 
original, the authentic, and appealing to a sense of tradition, positioning 
itself as an integral part of daily American life. Pepsi, on the other hand, is 
promoting itself as something new, young, and hip, which seems a little odd 
after over 100 years. But Coke was first, after all. Pepsi has always targeted 
the youth market more aggressively than Coke.</p>

<h4>Pepsi v Coca-Cola war turns hot</h4> 
<p>The ongoing cola war between global rivals Pepsi and Coca-Cola has taken a 
weird twist in India with the former dragging the latter to court. The charge: 
Coca-Cola has snatched employees, bottlers, and agents, all of whom are bound 
to Pepsi by a contract. Pepsi has charged Coke with having entered into a 
conspiracy to disrupt its business operations by inducing key employees and 
associates to break existing contracts illegally. Pepsi has sought a permanent 
injunction and an ex parte order against coke, restraining it from taking away 
Pepsi's employees and business associates. Pepsi has also reserved the right to 
seek financial damages from Coke at a later date if necessary.</p> 
<p>Pepsi has claimed that a dozen middle-level managers and three territory 
managers broke their contracts with Pepsi to join Coke in recent months, while 
during the last year and half, seven managers quit Pepsi to join Coca-Cola.</p> 
<p>Justice C M Nair of the Delhi high court on April 17 issued notices and 
summons to Coca-Cola and 15 others for May 6. However, Justice Nayar refused to 
grant the ex parte injunction sought by Pepsi India to stop the alleged 
inducements by Coke in offering employment to Pepsi's employees while the suit 
was pending in court.</p> 
<p>On behalf of Pepsi, Ashok Desai and Arun Jaitley contended that Coca-Cola 
had been &quot;rattled by the huge success of Pepsi in India entered into a 
conspiracy during the last six months to cause loss and damage to Pepsi's 
business interests by adopting unfair and illegal means.&quot;</p> 
<p>It added that Coca-Cola had approached many key managers and had 
successfully lured a commercial manager of its bottling business Gaurav Duggal, 
and a manager in Surat Sailesh Joshi, besides others.</p> 
<p>Pepsi charged that while initially these approaches were sporadic, over the 
last six months it is clear that Coca-Cola has changed its strategy and has 
decided to consciously target and approach key employees of Pepsi at various 
locations in India.</p> 
<p>The company has alleged that in most cases, the employees have not been 
given time to adhere to the 90-day notice period and the one-year 
confidentiality agreement. The latter deal bars employees joining its rivals 
for at least a year.</p> 
<p>Desai claimed Coke's actions would directly harm the business interests of 
Pepsi, which had invested over $300 million in the country in establishing 
business infrastructure. In its defense, Coke is expected to seek relief in the 
Indian Constitution which states that there can be no restriction on the 
movement of labor. Besides, any effort by a company to restrict its employees 
from joining other companies might fall foul of the Monopolies and Restrictive 
Trade Practices Act as an unfair trade practice.</p> 
<p>Pepsi has cited the instance of Coke snapping up cricketer Javagal Srinath 
in spite of the latter signing a contract with Pepsi's sports consultant, 21st 
Century Media. However, media reports, quoting sources, said that Srinath's 
contract had been only in the verbal stage.</p> 
<p>Similarly, Pepsi has charged Coke with inducing the Board of Control for 
Cricket in India to give the sponsorship of the recently concluded Pepsi 
Triangular Cricket Series to Coke, as acknowledged in the BCCI submission 
before the Bombay high court, even while a contract was signed with Pepsi.</p> 
<p>Pepsi has listed the case of Coke trying to induce its music consultant DNA 
Networks Private Ltd, which organized the Yanni show, to snap its ties with 
Pepsi and join Coke. Incidentally, in results announced for the first three 
months of the year, Pepsi has swept Coca-Cola aside. Pepsi has reported a 
growth of 27 per cent compared to Coke's 21 per cent during the same period. In 
the first three months of last year, Pepsi grew by 18 per cent only.</p> 
<p>Coca-Cola India chief executive Donald Short had announced that Coke would 
grow by at least 20 per cent for the whole of 1998. Coca-Cola, along with the 
Parle brands it acquired when it came into India -- Thums Up, Limca, and Gold 
Spot - continue to dominate India with a 55 per cent market share to Pepsi's 43 
per cent. But in the cola segment, Coke comes a poor third after Thumps Up and 
Pepsi.</p> 
<p>The current summer season is the most important for the cola giants, with 
consumption at its peak.</p> 
<h4>BATTLE OF THE BEVERAGES:</h4> 
<h4>PEPSI IS NOT AS PRICEY</h4> 
<p>Regardless of which soda you like better though, Pepsi seems the better 
value than Coke right now. Coke is trading at a nearly 20 percent premium to 
Pepsi based on 2002 P/Es even though the two companies' earnings growth rates 
are nearly identical. (Pepsi's are actually a shade higher.)</p> 
<p>And when you look at revenues, the gap is even more dramatic. Coke is 
trading at 7 time's estimated 2002 sales while Pepsi is trading at 3.5 times 
2002 revenue estimates. Both companies are expected to post slight declines in 
sales this year and an increase of about 4 percent in 2003. Due to this 
disparity in valuation, Jeff Kanter, an analyst with Prudential Securities, 
says he has a &quot;buy' rating on Pepsi and &quot;hold&quot; on Coke. 
Prudential does not do investment banking.</p> 
<p>To be sure, Coke is still the market share leader in soft drinks. One of 
the main reasons the stock has outperformed Pepsi this year was because it 
reported a better than expected gain in unit volume in the first quarter. And 
the company has taken steps to cement its carbonated beverage lead as well gain 
ground in the bottled water market. (Coke and Pepsi both have their own brands 
of water, Dasani and Aquafina, respectively.) On Tuesday, Coke announced that 
it was acquiring the Seagram's line of mixers, tonic, ginger ale and seltzer 
from Diageo and per nod Richard. And last month, Coke entered into an agreement 
with Group Danone to distribute Evian bottled water in North America.</p> 
<h4>Some pretzels with that soda?</h4> 
<p>But while Coke relies solely on beverages for growth, another factor in 
Pepsi's favor is its diversity. &quot;What attracts me to Pepsi is I have more 
faith in their ability to grow earnings. Not only are they successful on the 
beverage side but they are successful with salty snack foods,&quot; says Crit 
Thomas, director of growth equity for National City Investment Management Co., 
the sub advisor for Armada Funds. As of March 31, Pepsi was the seventh-largest 
holding in the Armada Tax Managed Equity Fund and the tenth-largest holding in 
the Armada Equity Growth Fund.</p> 
<p>In fact, Pepsi's carbonated beverages are not even the biggest generator of 
sales and earnings for the company. Pepsi's Frito-Lay brand of snack foods, 
which include Fritos, Doritos and Rold Gold, accounted for 61.2 percent of 
revenue and 65.3 percent of operating profits in the first quarter.</p> 
<p>Pepsi's soft drink business made up 19 percent of sales and 23.2 percent of 
operating profit. Pepsi also owns Gatorade and Quaker Foods, having acquired 
Quaker Oats last year.</p> 
<p>One potential risk for both Pepsi and Coke is the economy. No, not if it 
goes back into a recession. If the economy continues to improve, the stocks 
could fall victim to what is known as sector rotation, the selling of defensive 
companies like food and beverages in order to buy more economically sensitive 
companies in the financial services and technology sectors. To that end, shares 
of Pepsi and Coke fell slightly on Wednesday during the Cisco-induced market 
rally.</p> 
<p>Still, Thomas says signs that the dollar is starting to weaken compared to 
other currencies should prop up both stocks. That's because a weaker dollar 
helps boost the profits of international subsidiaries, since profits made in a 
foreign currency are converted back to dollars. The majority of Coke's sales 
are from its international operations, with just 38 percent of revenue coming 
from the U.S. last year. Pepsi is not as big globally but currency fluctuations 
are still a factor, as international sales accounted for 29 percent of revenue 
in 2001.</p> 
<h4>Coke and Pepsi in India:</h4> 
<p>Coca-Cola controlled the Indian market until 1977, when the Janata Party 
beat the Congress Party of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. To punish 
Coca-Cola's principal bottler, a Congress Party stalwart and longtime Gandhi 
supporter, the Janata government demanded that Coca-Cola transfer its syrup 
formula to an Indian subsidiary. Coca-Cola balked and withdrew from the 
country. India, now left without both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, became a protected 
market. In the meantime, India's two largest soft-drink producers have gotten 
rich and lazy while controlling 80% of the Indian market. These domestic 
producers have little incentive to expand their plants or develop the country's 
potentially enormous market. Some analysts reason that the Indian market may be 
more lucrative than the Chinese market. India has 850 million potential 
customers, 150 million of whom comprise the middle class, with disposable 
income to spend on cars, VCRs, and computers. The Indian middle class is 
growing at 10% per year. To obtain the license for India, Pepsi had to export 
$5 of locally made products for every $1 of materials it imported, and it had 
to agree to help the Indian government to initiate a second agricultural 
revolution. Pepsi has also had to take on Indian partners. In the end, all 
parties involved seem to come out ahead: Pepsi gains access to a potentially 
enormous market; Indian bottlers will get to serve a market that is expanding 
rapidly because of competition; and the Indian consumer benefits from the 
competition from abroad and will pay lower prices. Even before the first bottle 
of Pepsi hit the shelves, local soft drink manufacturers increased the size of 
their bottles by 25% without raising costs.</p> 
<h4>PRICE</h4> 
<p>Maximum retail price of 300 ml bottles is controlled by the Central 
Government. The other size and packs are priced keeping factors like 
competition, internal costs, external costs, and the corporate objective of the 
company in the mind.</p> 
<h4>PRODUCT SELLING PRICE MAX. RETAIL PRICE</h4>

<h4>PREFERENCE TO THE BRAND</h4>

<h4>PUBLIC RELATIONS ANGLE</h4> 
<h4>Innovative and exciting offers</h4> 
<p>The respondents were asked to compare between PepsiCo and Coca-Cola [I] 
Ltd. in terms of who comes up with innovative and exciting offers, or rather 
things which are lively and interesting to participate.</p> 
<p>50% of the respondents replied in favor of PCI while 30% responded in favor 
of CCI. 17% of the respondents thought that both were equally good and it 
varied with time, place and occasions. 3% of the respondents were not aware of 
all the activities and were modest to admit it.</p> 
<p>Quick and responsive to different occasions and events. Comparing PepsiCo 
and Coca-Cola [I] Ltd, 55% of the respondents replied that it was undoubtedly 
PepsiCo. They supported their statement with reasoning, saying so that PepsiCo 
was first to associate with India's 50 years of independence.</p> 
<p>On the other hand 22% of the respondents felt that Coca-Cola [I] Ltd. is 
not trailing back. It sponsors mega events like different Cricket tournaments, 
Olympic Games, World Cup Football etc.19% of the respondents came up with a 
more balanced answer. They said if one of the companies sponsors One event it's 
sure that the other will definitely go on for the next. It's a tough tussle and 
is really difficult to demarcate today.</p> 
<h4>MARKET SHARE PERCENTAGE IN NEW DELHI</h4> 
<p>COKE 56%</p> 
<p>PEPSI 35%</p> 
<p>Pure Drinks 9%</p> 
<h4>Local Brand</h4> 
<p>In a survey done by A &amp; M magazines on the best marketing companies in 
India. Pepsi and Coca-Cola were also entered. The results were as follows:</p> 
<p>Pepsi - 5h</p> 
<p>Coca-Cola - 4h</p> 
<p>The results of 95 were:</p> 
<p>Pepsi - 7th</p> 
<p>Coca-Cola - 9h</p> 
<p>This shows that both the companies are paying more attention to the 
marketing of their products. Pepsi is higher up on the scale than Coca-Cola. We 
can see that by the brilliant advertising done by Pepsi, which can be seen on 
every hook and corner of metro cities consumers, so prefer Pepsi advertisements 
and other activities of Pepsi, to that of Coca- Cola.</p> 
<h4>FINDINGS &amp; ANALYSIS</h4> 
<p>The Indian soft drinks market is at 140 million cases per year. This is 
very low, even as compared to Pakistan and Bangladesh. All these factors 
together have contributed to a 20% growth in the soft drinks industry.. If this 
demand continues to grow at 20% grow at 20% annually, within 10 years the 
volumes could reach 1 billion cases. This kind of growth is the reason for the 
entry of the two giants of the soft drink industry of the world.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Coca-Cola</li> 
<li>Pepsi</li> </ul> 
<p>Coca-Cola and Pepsi together control 97% of the 4 entire Indian markets. 
The rest of the 3% is shared by companies like Cadbury-Schweppes and 
Campa-Cola. The total no. of case sold is 140 million of these 77 million cases 
of Cola drinks are sold and 63 million of non-cola drink. There is a rapid 
increase in the sale of cola soft drinks. Whereas in 1990, they accounted for a 
third of all soft drinks sold, now their share is well over half. Also cola 
sales are growing at a faster rate than non-colas. One of the reasons for this 
could be the aggressive marketing strategies for Cola drinks by Pepsi and 
Coca-Cola. The race to quench the great Indian thirst had deigned.</p> 
<h4>Pepsi findings:</h4> 
<p>Pepsi is the 2ND largest selling soft drink in India today. In DELHI it has 
35% of the market share. In India it has 44% of the market share making it the 
largest selling soft drink, but the second largest company in terms of sales.
</p> 
<p>The sales of Pepsi is approximately Rs. 1,000 crore annually in India of 
this only about Rs. 30 crore annually is credited to the foods section of 
Pepsi. The rest is all earned by the soft drinks.</p> 
<h4>The soft drinks in Pepsi Foods LTD include:</h4> 
<ol> 
<li>Pepsi Cola</li> 
<li>Mirinda Orange</li> 
<li>7-Up</li> 
<li>Mirinda Lemon</li> </ol> 
<p>The main advantage the Pepsi has over its nearest competitor i.e., 
Coca-Cola is that of it's was the first multinational to enter India, in the 
soft drinks sector. Pepsi officials and 'Dial-a-Pepsi' scheme to grow the 
market, instead of giving discounts at the retail level. Another point which 
attributed to Pepsi's success is the bottling operations. Pepsi does most of 
its bottling on its own. Another significant investment of Pepsi has been 
fountains. Fountains have considerably increased sales of Pepsi, as they have 
offered consumers a whole new way to experience soft drink. According to a 
study done, 80% of all soft drinks are consumed on premise, at the point of 
purchase, rather than at home; thus the fountain initiative has paid off.</p> 
<p>Thus we see that Pepsi has followed aggressive marketing strategies making 
they get into the minds of the consumer by being visible inside and outside the 
consumers home by way of television, radio Newspapers, hoarding, 
sales-promotion schemes, etc. Pepsi has been voted the number one customer 
service company across categories in terms of regularity, availability 
responsiveness and initiative.</p> 
<h4>PRESENT COMPETITON BETWEEN COCA COLA AND PEPSI</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>If we see the present scenario its hard to tell which brand is winning the 
cola wars as Pepsi had extended its cola wars to other sectors like FRITO-LAYS 
and NIMBOOZ which is giving tough competition to coca -cola which doesn't 
target on these sectors.</li> 
<li>Second aspect which is to be given in consideration is that, both the 
companies are spending heavily on advertisement and more celebrities are roped 
in by both the companies to fight the competition.</li> 
<li>Recently COLA-COLA beverages ACTORS IMRAN KHAN AND KALKI for a new ad ;to 
reply back to this a new ad by PEPSI beverages featuring ACTOR RANBIR KAPOOR 
and VINDHU DARA SINGH came up which is making waves at present.</li> 
<li>Coke is served in MC DONALDS and there we won't find Pepsi products even 
the coffee served is of GEORGIA which is a coca-cola brand, same is the case of 
PIZZA HUT and KFC which is owned by PEPSI CO there only Pepsi products are 
served, this had lead 2 clear war in restaurant segment as well...</li> 
<li>PEPSI is targeting young generation and their ad campaigns are a clear 
example of that, whereas coca-cola is targeting the family as a whole which has 
been its old formula from ages.</li> 
<li>Presently coca-cola may be leading in beverages like coke, but its facing 
severe competition from Mirinda, Nimbooz and snack industry where PEPSI is 
ruling thanks to its KURKURE ad that has led to great sales for PEPSI CO.</li> 
<li>Though in packed drinking water KINLEY (COCA-COLA BRAND) and ACQAFINA 
(PEPSI CO BRAND) both are treated equally by customers. Moreover BISLERI still 
rules in this segment.</li> </ul> 
<h4>FUTURE SCENERIO OF COCA COLA V/S PEPSI</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>The COLA WARS between coca-cola and Pepsi would further grow and in my 
view its never ending</li> 
<li>Both the companies would try to become NO1 and there would AD WAR between 
the two which would prove to be beneficial for actors/actresses as they would 
earn more through advertisements.</li> 
<li>Pepsi have started advertisements with female actresses DEEPIKA PADUKONE 
and COCA-COLA which had up till know only endorsed male actors for the 1st time 
endorsed KALKI of DEVD fame with IMRAN KHAN in its new ad.</li> 
<li>With the coming up of COMMENWEALTH GAMES 2010 in NEW DELHI, both the 
brands would try to attract customers towards itself with heavy promotion and 
ad campaigns to build new customers and increase there share in market as well 
as strengthen their brand value and earn profits.</li> </ul> 
<h4>Consumers</h4> 
<p>For the purpose of the study, questionnaires were prepared for the 
Consumers. Care was taken to interview all types of consumers, i.e.:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Different age groups</li> 
<li>Males and females</li> 
<li>People from different localities, etc.</li> </ol> 
<p>In all about 60 consumers were interviewed. The conclusions that one can 
draw from these answers provided by the consumers showed that marketing 
activities do form a major part of the decision.</p> 
<p>One thing that was common amongst all the consumers who were once a day or 
once a week. The number one factors the influences a customer while buying a 
soft-drink was taste. This was true for all the consumers who were interviewed. 
The rest of the conclusions as deducted from the questionnaires are as follows:
</p> 
<p>The younger generation preferred soft drinks to the older generation.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Children up to 15 years of age liked to have soft drinks up to 2-3 times a 
day.</li> 
<li>Young adults liked to have soft drinks up to 1-2 times a day.</li> 
<li>Adults liked to have soft drinks about once or twice a week.</li> </ol> 
<p>Children preferred Coca-Cola Fanta, Mirinda orange. Young adults liked 
Pepsi. The older generation preferred Coca-Cola, Limca &amp; Mirinda Lemon.</p> 
<p>The reason given for choice of favorite's soft drink was taste and easy 
availability. Only if the consumer liked the taste of drink, he would have it 
again.95% of the consumers felt that marketing strategies of the company did 
affect the sales of their soft-drink.</p> 
<p>Marketing strategies made the consumer try a drink for the first time. The 
second time round it was the consumers choice himself and not strategy could 
affect that. Youngsters were more acceptable to change. They tried different 
drinks, Cola and non-Cola. Adults stick to one and they prefer drinks that do 
not affect their health, like Limca.</p> 
<p>Major number of people found television advertising to be the most 
effective. Young and the old liked to watch the advertisements on television.
</p> 
<p>Sponsoring events, outdoor advertising and sales promotion schemes were 
second choice of the consumers. Under television advertising, Pepsi came in as 
the number 1 favorite of the people the advertisement of Shah-Rukh Khan and the 
dog was the favorite of the consumers. Their new advertisement of Mirinda Lemon 
is also lifted by the people. The advertisement that came in second was the 
Coca-Cola advertisement of the people Cricket and the song Must-Kalander going 
on at the back. These, advertisement remained most in the minds of the people. 
Most of the consumers felt that Pepsi was the market leader in the soft-drink 
industry, in Delhi well as in India.</p> 
<p>99% of the consumers interviewed felt that the marketing strategies of the 
Coca-Cola and Pepsi have helped them in attaining the huge market share that 
they possess. Women and children prefer cans as compared to men. These are the 
major conclusion that can be drawn about a consumers' behavior. Companies must 
take the initiative of finding out the habits of the consumers and then 
changing them, in their favor.</p> 
<h4>ANALYSIS OF QUESTANNAIRE</h4> 
<p>50 respondents were chosen among different age groups for conducting the 
survey</p> 
<h4>FINDINGS:</h4> 
<ol> 
<li>YOUNGSETRS prefer PEPSI COLA over COKE</li>

<li>Price plays an effective role for choosing of product among INDIAN 
CONSUMERS.</li> 
<li>TASTE came out to be most important for the consumers in preferring for a 
particular brand.</li> 
<li>TELEVISION came out to be most effective for ad campaigns as respondents 
of all age groups watch tv.</li> </ol> 
<h4>RECOMMENDATIONS</h4> 
<p>Soft drinks are an impulse product. When a person is thirsty, he would 
first think of water or tea. Some even would prefer 'Nimbooz &quot;</p> 
<p>The Indian population is the largest in the world today, there can be no 
other country in the world, which provides so much of an opportunity for the 
soft-drink manufacturers. The Indian soft drink market is at 140 million cases 
per year, this is very low. Thus the consumption of soft drink can go up.</p> 
<p>Sinc118+e the entry of Coca-Cola into the country the industry is growing 
at a rate of 20% annually. If this rate is maintained, then by the year 2005 
the market of soft drink would be 1 billion cases annually.</p> 
<p>However Coca-Cola wants to accomplish this feat by them. To do this the 
industry has to take certain steps. All the companies are fighting to get a 
major share of this growing market. They should all try to increase the total 
market along with their individual shares. On the basis of all the field work 
and table work done, some suggestions can be made, which may help the company 
in increasing the total market as well as the sale of the companies. The 
various suggestions that can be made are as follows:</p> 
<p>Soft drinks retail at prices between Rs. 6 and Rs. 10. These are expensive 
when measured against purchasing power.</p> 
<p>According to one study, it takes Indian 50 minutes of work to be able to 
buy a bottle in other countries, the norm is five minutes. Thus to increase the 
total market of soft drinks, manufactures should try and decrease the prices, 
so as to increase sales.</p> 
<p>Availability is a major factor, which makes the consumer buy a soft drink. 
Soft drinks should be made available more readily than present. There are only 
300, 000 retailers stocking soft drinks in India. Thus retailing outlets should 
be increased. Also related to this point, is vending machines. In developed 
machines, vending machines are kept in all consumer areas, like super markets, 
schools, amusement parks, local markets, etc. These Tempt a person into buying 
the soft drink. So if vending machines are put in strategic areas, it would 
definitely increase consumption of soft drinks.</p> 
<p>Soft drink cans which are very convenient, as the consumer can take them 
anywhere, unlike a bottle, are very expensive retailing from Rs. 15-Rs. 18. To 
increase sale of cans, this price should be brought down.</p> 
<p>Innovations increase sales of company. For e.g. fountain Pepsi increased 
sales of Pepsi Cans increased sales of Coca-Cola. Thus the companies hav 
constantly come out with innovative ideas.Example-300 ml plastic bottles, which 
the consumer can take with him, unlike the glass bottles, which he has to 
return. Plastic bottles can even be used again by households for various 
purposes.</p> 
<p>The companies should conduct studies to get to know about consumer habits. 
For e.g. Coke knows that Americans see 69 of its commercials every years , put 
5.2 ice cubes in a glass and prefer cans to pop out of vending machines at a 
temperature of 35 degrees. If the companies know all this and more about Indian 
consumer behavior, it could tell them how to sell their drinks, so as to 
increase sales.</p> 
<p>It is seen In India, that people prefer having their drinks with or after 
food. Companies could have commercials which show people enjoying their drink 
with a good meal, so that consumers associate drinking soft drinks while having 
food.</p> 
<p>Companies should try to educate the consumer about the health related 
subject. For e.g.:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Limca is recommended to patients by doctors.</li> 
<li>Cola drinks are known to be very fattening</li> </ol> 
<p>But in fact cola drinks contain no calories from fat they contain calories 
from sugar which can be easily burned off. The soft drink cans and plastic 
bottles should mention the calories and other related information on the 
packing.</p> 
<p>Companies should try to build high brand equity. This provides a number of 
advantages to the company.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The company enjoys reduced marketing costs because of high level of 
consumer brand awareness and loyalty.</li> 
<li>The company will have more trade leverage in bargaining with distributors 
and retailers since the customer expects them to carry the brand.</li> 
<li>The company can change a higher price than its competitors because the 
brand has higher perceived quality.</li> 
<li>The company can more easily launch brand extension.</li> 
<li>Above all, the brand offers the company some defense against fierce price 
competition.</li> </ol> 
<p>The companies should go in for diversification Once the brand is known, it 
is easier to sell more of its products. For e.g. Coca-Cola clothes have sold 
about $100 million worth of clothes and accessories. This would increase 
revenues of the company.</p> 
<p>The companies should not have competitor myopia. It is more often the 
latent company than the current competitor who busies the company. Pepsi and 
Coca-Cola are so busy fighting with each other, that they have left the 
non-cola sector open for Cadbury-Schweppes.</p> 
<p>Advertising is a way building brand image. It does not promote quick 
selling. Thus companies should used advertising only for long advertising can 
be used for:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Brand image building</li> 
<li>Reminder advertising: reminding people to buy these drinks.</li> 
<li>Reinforcement advertising-Telling people that they have made the right 
choice.</li> </ol> 
<p>Television advertising seems to make a impact on the consumers (based on 
questionnaire answers) so companies should concentrate more on television 
advertisements.</p> 
<p>Sales promotion tools create a stronger and quicker response. Thus sales 
promotion tools such as coupons, contests, premiums and the like should be used 
to dramatize product offers and to boost sales. Sales-promotion effects are 
usually short run and induce the people to purchase soft drinks, now.</p> 
<p>Coca-Cola and Pepsi have taken up sponsoring of events on a major scale. 
All kinds or events, whether big (Wills Worked cup) or small (college contests) 
have either Pepsi or Coke banners of sponsorship. The effectiveness of this can 
be questioned. Whether these activities increase sales or not is a big huge 
question mark.</p> 
<p>PepsiCo and Coca Cola (I) Ltd. should reduce their massive spending on 
sponsoring events and try and channel this money into more productive 
activities, like innovative packaging etc.</p> 
<p>It is recommended that company should introduce more and more customer 
oriented schemes and contexts. For e.g. Pepsi's new campaign &quot;Pepsi cool 
mal&quot; in which they are giving free gifts to their customers.</p> 
<p>The company should maintain a small group of &quot;missionary sales 
man&quot; whose functions should be to guide distributors and retailers, keep a 
constant watch over the prevailing situation to provide the continuous feedback 
to the company.</p> 
<p>It is also recommended that companies should launch soft drink in small 
pack 200 ml and 150 ml.</p> 
<p>Thus we see that there various steps which can be taken by the companies to 
increase their sales and to increase the total market share.</p>
