<h3>Soda: The Pepsi Throwback Throwdown </h3> 
<p>Posted by Carey Jones and John Edwards, November 22, 2011 at 10:30 AM</p>

<p><strong>John: </strong> We can leave debates about the nutritional, 
societal, agricultural, and economical issues surrounding high-fructose corn 
syrup to another column. But as more and more companies are introducing 
non-HFCS products, it's no surprise to see soda companies jump on the marketing 
bandwagon, introducing products like<strong>Pepsi Throwback</strong>, sweetened 
with good ol' sugar.</p> 
<p>Coca-Cola has long offered versions with sugar in other countries, as well 
as in many Kosher food stores.<strong>But are sugar-based beverages better?
</strong> I'll admit, I would grab the 12-pack of Throwback over the regular 
Pepsi because of my aversion to HFCS. (I didn't actually know if it tasted 
better, but the marketing had convinced me. Then, there's my fondness for the 
old packaging, and for Cindy Crawford.)</p> <br>

<p><strong>Carey: </strong> John is loyal to Mexican Coke, so I wasn't at all 
surprised he'd seek out sugar-sweetened Pepsi. But does he really prefer the 
taste of sugar&mdash;or just the idea of it? A few years ago,Adam Kuban tasted 
very little difference between Pepsi Throwback and the usual kind (and found a 
<em>very</em> slight office preference for Throwback in a double-blind taste 
test). What seems to me more relevant was that,in an exhaustive Food Lab, Kenji 
tested &quot;Mexican Coke&quot; (made with sugar) against normal American coke 
(corn syrup). He not only found that most tasters<em>don't</em> prefer the 
sugar version, but that<em>thinking</em> something was a Mexican Coke (or the 
experience of drinking it out of the bottle) had a huge impact.</p> 
<p>It's of little matter to me (I preferred American Coke in every single 
test, and I'm a diet soda drinker, anyway), but John goes out of his way for 
Pepsi Throwback. If he doesn't really prefer it, that's a pretty big waste of 
time and money. (And John already has enough habits that waste time and money.)
</p>

<p>Cans; bottles. We went for cans. [Photo: Robyn Lee]</p> 
<p><strong>John: </strong>For consistency's sake, we wanted all cans. American 
Pepsi, American Coke, and Pepsi Throwback were easy enough. But sugar-sweetened 
Coke? Your standard &quot;Mexican Coke&quot; comes in a bottle.</p> 
<p><strong>Carey: </strong>The solution came through a rather unlikely source: 
a new Celebrity cruise ship. We were on a weekend cruise (er, more on that 
later) leaving from Bayonne, but the shiny new boat was built in Germany, and 
they'd fully stocked their larders with German products, naturally enough. I 
got excited about the teeny Euro-style yogurt pots and drinking &quot;Coke 
Light.&quot; John was all about the German sugar-sweetened Coke. So we made 
sure a can got back to dry land for the taste test.</p> 
<p><strong>John: </strong>Given that I'd rather sip and muse about soda than 
be tested on it (and that Monday Night Football was on), I figured we'd taste 
all four in unlabeled cups and call it a night. Being a rather severe stickler 
for detail, Carey insisted on a much longer battery of tests. (She'll roll her 
eyes and forgive me if I belch during taste tests, but half-assing it is not an 
option.)</p> 
<p><strong>Carey: </strong>So we not only tested Pepsi Throwback vs regular, 
and Coke vs sugar Coke, but every possible permutation&mdash;twice.</p> 
<p></p>

<p><strong>John: </strong>The results? I consistently preferred Pepsi to Coke 
(which didn't surprise me), and sugar-sweetened soda to corn-syrup soda. What 
surprised me is that I actually preferred corn syrup Pepsi to sugar-sweetened 
Coke. (I know I'm a Pepsi guy. It runs pretty deep.)</p> 
<p><strong>Carey: </strong>With a sample size of one, this isn't intended to 
&quot;prove&quot; that any one of these sodas is superior to another. It did 
illustrate once again, though, thatthere are discernible differences between 
the colas, and between sugar-sweetened ones and standard American versions. 
(And that John doesn't need to board another cruise ship for German sugar Coke 
fix; a fifteen-second walk to the bodega for a Pepsi will do.)</p> 
<p><strong>John: </strong>One of the most interesting takeaways, for me, was 
how consistently I noticed something odd about the HFCS. It leaves a tinny, 
metallic aftertaste, and it's a little sharper; and though it's not quite as 
sweet-tasting, there's something oddly cloying about the drinks that included 
it.</p> 
<p>To quote Baudelaire, the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was 
convincing the world he doesn't exist. High Fructose Corn Syrup is trying 
desperately to shed its current moniker in an ad campaign rebranding itself as 
just another rendition of sugar. But after this taste test, I'm sticking to 
sugar when I can.</p> 
<p><strong>Carey: </strong>Turns out John was right about his own preferences, 
even in a blind taste-test. I'm sure they're only reinforced by the packaging. 
But really, what's wrong with that? I don't care if there are sugar pills or 
ibuprofen in my Advil bottle as long as my headache goes away.</p> 
<p>Do you seek out Pepsi Throwback or sugar-sweetened Coke? And <strong>do you 
think you can taste a real difference?</strong></p>
