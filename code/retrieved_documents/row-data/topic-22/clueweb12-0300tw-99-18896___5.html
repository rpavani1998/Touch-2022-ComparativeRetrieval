<h1>Which one is the better of the two?</h1> 
<p>For centuries, these brands have evolved significantly and has gained an 
international audience. What is it about these two companies that continues to 
lure people into purchasing their products and what is the secret to their 
everlasting success? Most importantly, which one of these logos can stand the 
test of time without being changed?</p> 
<h2>The Evolution of Coca-Cola</h2> 
<p>The famous Coca-Cola logo was created by John Pemberton&rsquo;s bookkeeper, 
Frank Mason Robinson, in 1885. Robinson came up with the name and chose the 
logo&rsquo;s distinctive cursive script. The typeface used, known asSpencerian 
script, was developed in the mid 19th century and was the dominant form of 
formal handwriting in the United States during that period.</p> 
<p>Robinson also played a significant role in early Coca-Cola advertising. His 
promotional suggestions to Pemberton included giving away thousands of free 
drink coupons and plastering the city of Atlanta with publicity banners and 
streetcar signs.</p> 
<p>For the full history of the brand and with other Coca-Cola advertisements, 
you can read the story on Wikipedia.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of Pepsi</h2> 
<p>Pepsi is one of the world&rsquo;s most famous brands much like its rival 
Coca Cola. Pepsi Cola was originally called Brad&rsquo;s Drink after its 
creator, Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist from North Carolina.</p> 
<p>The original trademark application for Pepsi-Cola was filed on September 
23, 1902 with registration approved on June 16, 1903. In the 
application&rsquo;s statement, Caleb Bradham describes the trademark as an, 
&ldquo;arbitrary hyphenated word &ldquo;PEPSI-COLA,&rdquo; and indicated that 
the mark was in continuous use for his business since August 1, 1901. The 
Pepsi-Cola&rsquo;s description is a flavoring-syrup for soda water. The 
trademark expired on April 15, 1994.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>With regards to the new Pepsi logo, it appears that the blue, white, and 
red bottle cap we&rsquo;ve all known and loved has grown a personality. Below 
is a chart showing what each of these different circle variations may represent 
as a customer&rsquo;s facial expression.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>The &ldquo;Timeless&rdquo; Challenge</h2> 
<p>The subject of this chapter is to answer the question, &ldquo;Which logo 
appears to stand the test of time, Coke or Pepsi?&rdquo; Well, below is a 
diagram that will answer that question. It isn&rsquo;t a fluke either, it is 
really true.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Ending Thought</h2> 
<p>Is it a strange coincidence, or is this just another sign that answers why 
Coca-Cola holds the highest dominance in sales when Pepsi is second?</p>

<p>It is fascinating how Coke kept their logo the same and Pepsi has 
re-branded theirs many times. I still like Pepsi better, though. </p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;ve have never been fond of Pepsi. I have always considered it a 
&lsquo;bad facsimile&rsquo; of Coke &ndash; plus, Coca-Cola just tastes better!

<p>As far as taste goes, I can&rsquo;t decide which one I like better probably 
because I keep switching from Coke to Pepsi and back. However, for the logo, 
Coca-Cola made a smart move by not rebranding and I don&rsquo;t think Pepsi 
should have rebranded after their 1998 logo.</p> 
<p>I do believe Coke had &ldquo;tried&rdquo; to push a rebrand but they 
quickly caught their mistake before it was too late and reverted back to the 
original.</p> 
<p>Thanks Emily and Darrin for your thoughts. I appreciate it!</p> </li> </ol>
