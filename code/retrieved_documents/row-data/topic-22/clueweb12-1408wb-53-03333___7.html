Which works 
better in advertising: Paris Hilton in a bikini or a cute baby? Is there really 
such a thing as subliminal advertising and does it work? Are logos worth the 
cost? If Pepsi won the &ldquo;Pepsi Challenge&rdquo; back in 1975, why is Coke 
still the dominant cola?<br>
<br>
 Well all of these questions and many more 
are answered in Buyology &ndash; Truth and Lies About Why We Buy by Martin 
Lindstrom. Buyology is based on a three-year, $7-million neuromarketing study. 
Previously marketers would bring in focus groups to help analyze how and why 
people choose products or services. Unfortunately these groups gave marketers 
poor information because what a consumer says and what they do may be totally 
different.<br>
<br>
 Lindstrom bypassed the focus groups and used a $4-million 
fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine to get to the truth about 
how people buy. The fMRI machine measures the amount of oxygenated blood 
throughout the brain and can pinpoint an area as small as 1 millimeter. When 
the brain is working there is a greater flow of oxygenated blood to that area. 
Neuroscientists can track this to determine which part of the brain is working. 
This information then can determine what part of your brain lights up at 
different scenes in a commercial.<br>
<br>
 So let&rsquo;s answer the title 
question: In 2005 Paris Hilton was featured in a skimpy bathing suit washing a 
Bentley automobile in a very suggestive manner. When she was done she lounged 
across the Bentley and took a bite out of a hamburger. The company that 
sponsored the commercial was a major fast food company. Now place a guy in an 
fMRI machine and watch what part of his brain lights up. It won&rsquo;t be the 
food craving portion of the brain. Most guys will remember the ad but are hard 
pressed to name the hamburger chain.<br>
<br>
 On the other hand, babies&rsquo; 
faces have a big effect on the brain. When tested in the fMRI machines a 
picture of a smiling baby lit up the part of the brain linked to detection of 
rewarding stimuli. This means that if you are trying to decide whether to place 
a picture of your new van or a baby in your ad, go for the baby. Additional 
testing proved that smiling faces on your technicians will lead to increased 
future business.<br>
<br>
 Subliminal advertising story lines in TV programs 
like Columbo and The Twilight Zone have given subliminal advertising an 
undeserved reputation. People became so paranoid of mind control that in 1974 
the FCC proclaimed any TV station using subliminal advertising could lose its 
license. Because tobacco companies cannot advertise on TV or radio, they use a 
modern and very effective version of subliminal advertising. Marlboro uses the 
color red in many different ways, such as NASCAR and Ferrari Formula 1 race 
cars. When smokers are exposed to Marlboro red in fMRI machines, their minds 
generate the same cravings as if for a pack of Marlboros. The subliminal images 
didn&rsquo;t show any visible logos, so the smokers weren&rsquo;t consciously 
aware that they were viewing an advertising message and they let their guard 
down. Today logos get lost in the maze of advertising messages.<br>
<br>
 The 
use of color as branding works well for UPS as they market everything today 
with the slogan &ldquo;Let Brown Do It.&rdquo; Color has been shown to increase 
brand recognition by up to 80 percent. A carpet-cleaning company may do the 
same thing by using purple trucks and using the slogan &ldquo;Ask for the 
purple truck.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, we know that works well in Detroit.
<br> <br>
 One other area more effective than a logo is connecting a particular 
fragrance to a product. This is the power of sensory association. One of the 
best loved-fragrances across the world is Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s Baby 
Powder. You can see the white bottle in your mind when you smell vanilla but 
you can&rsquo;t remember their logo. Vanilla is the most popular scent in the 
United States due to primal childhood associations, and because it is the scent 
of a mother&rsquo;s breast milk. Why do you think Coca Cola brought out Coca 
Cola Vanilla (formerly Vanilla Coke)?<br>
<br>
 This may be a great opportunity 
for a cleaning company to use a delicate vanilla fragrance during cleaning and 
also to incorporate it into any marketing materials. When the customer receives 
a postcard reminder in the mail with embedded vanilla in the card it will bring 
back a flood of pleasant memories from the last cleaning.<br>
<br>
 Why does 
Pepsi win every taste test against Coke and yet Coke always outsells Pepsi?<br>

<br> In 1975 Pepsi beat Coke quite easily in the original Pepsi Taste Test 
Challenge. Malcolm Gladwell in his 2005 book Blink proposed that the reason 
consumers chose Pepsi was due to it being a &ldquo;sip test&rdquo; as opposed 
to drinking a full can. Pepsi being the sweeter product wins in a sip taste but 
a full can overwhelm with sugar, which is why Coke still dominates the market. 
Nice hypothesis Malcolm, but as Buyology proves, science beats speculation 
every time.<br>
<br>
 In 2003, 67 people were given the test again, but this 
time they used the fMRI machine. The results were the same as twenty-eight 
years earlier. Pepsi was again the champ. The subjects were tested again but 
first they were told which product they were drinking. The results showed 75 
percent of the tasters picked Coke. While the doctor watched the brains of the 
respondents during the fMRI he noticed two different areas of the brain light 
up. The rational side of the brain chose Pepsi because it tasted better. The 
emotional side of the brain had all the years of Coke&rsquo;s branding: the 
history, color, design, fragrance and even childhood memories of polar bears, 
Santa Claus and Coke. Sorry, but Pepsi using Michael Jackson in their 
commercials can&rsquo;t compete with Santa.<br>
<br>
 Emotions are the way in 
which our brains encode things of value, and brands or companies that engage us 
emotionally will win every time. Most market research is based on the idea that 
people behave in a predictable rational way. This was disproved in Predictably 
Irrational by Dan Ariely.<br>
<br>
 The field of neuromarketing is the 
long-awaited marriage of science and marketing. The dominant idea in Buyology, 
Predictably Irrational, and Habit by Neale Martin is that 90% of consumer 
buying behavior originates in the unconscious mind. Your company must build 
consistent, pleasant memories in your customer&rsquo;s emotional brain. The 
fastest way to do this is through the senses.<br>
<br>
Look at each part of 
your operational and marketing systems and determine how you can improve the 
sensory components. <br>
