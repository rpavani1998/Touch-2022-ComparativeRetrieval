<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the soft drink marketers&rsquo; uses of Social 
Media here.</p> 
<p>As you may recall, Pepsi was one of the first big-name marketers to 
aggressively go &ldquo;all-in&rdquo; in a Social Media sense, with its much 
talked-about &ldquo;Pepsi Refresh Project.&rdquo; This was a commitment from 
Pepsi to support worthwhile causes recommended and voted on by its customers 
and fans. Pepsi used Social Media (primarily Facebook) to elicit suggestions, 
to &ldquo;crowd source&rdquo; the causes (have fans and friends vote on them), 
and to report news developments.</p> 
<p>What gathered a lot of media attention for Pepsi wasn&rsquo;t so much the 
program itself, but the fact that Pepsi was pulling back in its traditional 
media spending in order to fund this program. As it turns out, the brand really 
didn&rsquo;t need to cut back much, just the couple of spots it traditionally 
ran in the Super Bowl.</p> 
<p>In the year following &ldquo;Pepsi Refresh,&rdquo; Pepsi&rsquo;s flagship 
product slipped into third place in the soft drink category (behind Diet Coke). 
Many Social Media naysayers were quick to blame this slide on Pepsi&rsquo;s 
move from mass media to Social Media. While I, for one, don&rsquo;t think 
Pepsi&rsquo;s descent in the cola wars was due to the fact that it didn&rsquo;t 
run a couple of Super Bowl spots (more on that inthis post), I do think the 
marketer dropped the ball when it came to defining and managing the 
&ldquo;Pepsi Refresh&rdquo; program. Specifically, I take Pepsi to task for 
three key reasons:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The focus was more on the &ldquo;crowd sourcing&rdquo; part of the program 
than in the good works themselves. Pepsi seemed to be more interested in social 
media for social media&rsquo;s sake rather than dedicated to a specific cause 
and serving as a catalyst for building a community of fans who also supported 
it. Social Media is most effective when it is used to amplify a strategy, not 
become one.</li> 
<li> The program didn&rsquo;t have a clear mission. Instead of focusing on a 
clear, single goal (for example, fresh drinking water in third-world 
countries), suggestions from fans were all over the map. Many were 
geographically limited, so the Pepsi community as a whole would not benefit or 
see the results. If you&rsquo;re going to start a movement (which is what 
Social Media at its best is capable of doing), you need to have a clear, 
succinct, non-compromising vision of what it is you will do and how 
specifically your audience can contribute and participate.</li> 
<li> The program didn&rsquo;t treat all community members fairly. The more 
active you were in Social Media, the more influence you had over the process. 
There were charges, in fact, of cheating on the part of some charitable 
entities in order to extort funds from Pepsi. This is not the kind of PR you 
want.</li> </ol> 
<p><br>
 Contrast what Pepsi did more than a year ago to what Coke is doing 
now. Coke has teamed with theWorld Wildlife Fund to help preserve the habitat 
of the Arctic Polar Bear. Promoted by both mass media and Social Media, this 
program spells out exactly what the marketer intends to do (donate up to $2 
million for Arctic habitat preservation over five years) and how the Coke 
community can help support (purchase cans and bottle of Coke with the polar 
bears on it). Simple. Elegant. Easy to understand. Easy to take part in. A 
cause that is hard to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to. By partnering with WWF, Coke 
also aligned itself with a an organization which is beyond reproach, giving the 
program more legitimacy. What&rsquo;s more, when you see someone drinking a 
Coke from a polar bear can, you immediately identify him as a fellow Arctic 
preservationist.</p> 
<p>Of course, I do have some issues with this campaign as well. An annual 
donation of just $500,000 for an organization that has annual sales in the 
billions is less than a drop in the bucket. Chances are, Coke is spending at 
least 20 times that amount in paid media promoting this campaign alone. Hey 
Coke. Don&rsquo;t be so chintzy. Increase your contributions ten fold.</p> 
<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t seen it, here is the spot Coke is running 
promoting its Save the Arctic efforts:</p>
