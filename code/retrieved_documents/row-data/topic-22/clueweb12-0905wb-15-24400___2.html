<h2>Essential Life Lesson #2: The Cola Wars Are Settled</h2> 
<p>We here at Current Configuration got together and had a frank and extensive 
discussion about Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola.* Billions of dollars, we&rsquo;re 
sure, have been spent to convey the virtues and defects of one or the other by 
the companies who manufacture vast oceans of each beverage. With over two 
decades of experience under our belts (and we&rsquo;ve owned quite a few belts 
since birth), we set out to definitively answer the question, which is better, 
Coca-Cola or Pepsi Cola?</p> 
<p> Coca-Cola.</p> 
<p>Coca-Cola has a complex yet easy-to-enjoy flavor that&rsquo;s well 
carbonated and not overly sugared, which is rare for a mainstream soda. Pepsi 
Cola, on the other hand, is for children and adults who thread their donuts 
with Twinkies when they&rsquo;re not licking their candy wrappers for the extra 
sugar.</p> 
<p>Additionally, this is about &rsquo;Coca-Cola Classic&rsquo;, not New Coke, 
Diet Coke, Diet Caffeine-Free Coke, Cherry Coke, Coke with Lemon, Diet Coke 
with Lime, Vanilla Coke, or whatever other poorly-conceived-of spin-off 
concoction they&rsquo;re foisting on us this week. That stuff ain&rsquo;t right.
</p> 
<p><i>Graphic coming soon probably not ever.</i></p> 
<p>*Also note that this is a comparison of Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi Cola, and 
excludes all other colas, some of which are better than either. Royal Crown 
Cola, which is a personal favorite here at Current Config, is an example of 
this.</p>
