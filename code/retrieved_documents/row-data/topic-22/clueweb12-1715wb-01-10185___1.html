<p>&ldquo;[This] book has been purposefully made small so that you can keep it 
with you in your purse, backpack, briefcase, or pocket&hellip;Whatever you do, 
don&rsquo;t put it on a shelf!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s author Ellis Jones&rsquo; advice regarding his latest edition 
of<em>The Better World Shopping Guide</em>, a handy, pocket-sized reference 
book intended to help shoppers make socially and environmentally responsible 
purchasing choices.</p> 
<p>The book<em> </em>is an invaluable resource for anyone concerned about the 
consequences of his or her everyday buying decisions, whether from the 
perspectives of peak oil or climate change, animal testing, toxic waste 
dumping, child labor or corporate accounting scandals, to name just a few of 
the issues. The book systematically ranks every type of company from airlines 
to banks to cereal manufacturers on an A-to-F scale, and presents the 
information in an easy-to-follow, shopping-friendly format.</p> 
<p>The first several pages succinctly outline the book&rsquo;s origins and the 
methodology used to rank companies. Jones, a Ph.D. in sociology, wrote the book 
after doing years of research on corporate behavior&mdash;drawing on resources 
like the Better Business Bureau, the Center for Public Integrity and the 
Environmental Protection Agency&mdash;compiling the data into an extensive 
database and then distilling these data down into a report card-style grade for 
each business or product.</p> 
<p>He felt motivated to write the book out of a realization that every dollar 
spent is &ldquo;a vote for the world you want to live in,&rdquo; but that 
information needed in order to make informed decisions is much harder to come 
by than information needed in order to assess, say, the latest presidential 
candidates.</p> 
<p>After this initial bit of background, Jones proceeds to his list of the 10 
best corporations (which include Clif Bar, Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s and Aveda) 
and his list of the 10 worst. He then concisely spells out what each of the 
letter grades used to rank companies means. &ldquo;A&rdquo; companies, he 
writes, often &ldquo;were created specifically to provide socially and 
environmentally responsible options for consumers,&rdquo; while &ldquo;F&rdquo; 
companies &ldquo;are actively participating in the rapid destruction of the 
planet and the exploitation of human beings.&rdquo; The rest fall somewhere 
in-between.</p> 
<p>The guide itself runs the gamut from airlines (with British Airways taking 
the lead with an A minus) to wines (with Yellow Tail, Gallo and Carlo Rossi all 
tying with a B minus). For each class of companies, a chart on the right ranks 
them all from A to F, while the page on the left provides some general buying 
tips and lists examples of corporate heroes and villains for that particular 
company category.</p> 
<p>A few examples of corporate heroes include Toyota, which leads its industry 
in combating climate change; Hewlett Packard, which has a perfect 100 on the 
Human Rights Campaign Equality Index; Newman&rsquo;s Own, which donates all of 
its profits to education and charity; and Whole Foods, which is powered 
entirely by renewable energy.</p> 
<p>As for corporate villains, you&rsquo;ll find the usual array of big box 
stores, oil companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and fast food 
restaurants&mdash;as well as a few surprise entries that just might change the 
way you shop for everything from noodle soup to computer software.</p> 
<p>The book contains plenty of interesting informational tidbits for peak oil 
readers. For example, did you know that New Belgium has the first ever 100 
percent wind-powered brewery, or that Kettle Foods converts all of its waste 
oil into biodiesel?</p> 
<p>Another nice feature of the book is the product category index located at 
the back, which is intended to help readers find items that they may have 
missed the first time through. Couldn&rsquo;t find condensed milk? It&rsquo;s 
under &ldquo;Baked Goods and Baking Supplies&rdquo;&mdash;as are marshmallows, 
corn meal and evaporated milk. Didn&rsquo;t see bacon bits? They&rsquo;re in 
the &ldquo;Sugar, Spices &amp; Sweeteners&rdquo; section, which also covers 
syrup, honey and salt.</p> 
<p>Jones freely admits that his guide is &ldquo;far from complete,&rdquo; and 
that readers will likely come across companies and brands in their everyday 
dealings that receive no mention in the book. Indeed, the present reviewer can 
name several such companies right offhand: TOP Food &amp; Drug, First Mutual 
Bank, Black Bear Diner, Big Boy Restaurants, Taco Time andTaco del Mar, to name 
just a few. The book also has a couple of rather puzzling omissions of major 
companies (where inthe heck is Denny&rsquo;s?).</p> 
<p>Set against these omissions, however, is a list of helpful, sweeping rules 
to follow when evaluating companies or products that do happen to fall through 
the cracks. If Product X is certified fair trade or organic, it gets an A or a 
B plus, respectively. If Company Y produces clothing or shoes, it automatically 
falls into the D or F category. If you know nothing at all about the company, 
assign it a C. Local credit unions automatically receive a B; organic and local 
beer breweries get an A minus; and farmers markets, food co-ops and local 
bakeries or vineyards all tie with a resounding A plus. In addition to laying 
out these general guidelines, Jones welcomes readers&rsquo; feedback on the 
book&rsquo;s Web site: www.betterworldshopper.org.</p> 
<p>And even if <em>The Better World Shopping Guide</em> is far from complete, 
it still does a great service to socially responsible shoppers. It 
doesn&rsquo;t cover 100 percent of the companies and products that are out 
there, but it does nail quite a large percentage of them. And that&rsquo;s a 
whole lot better than nailing zero percent of them&mdash;which is pretty much 
where we&rsquo;d be without a convenient guide like Jones&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>For me, a chief highlight of reading this book is that is resolved, once 
and for all, the perennial question&mdash;debated endlessly intongue-in-cheek 
TV ads from the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s&mdash;of whether Coke is better than 
Pepsi. I can now safely say which is the better beverage from a social and 
environmental responsibility standpoint (never mind that both of them rot away 
our kidneys in equal measure). And you&rsquo;ll know too, once you&rsquo;ve 
read the book!</p>
