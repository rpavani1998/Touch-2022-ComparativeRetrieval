<h3>Soda Pop</h3>  Okay so I'm warning you in advance that this entry is going 
to go awry quickly.&nbsp; It will be like spending the day with an ADD 
kid.&nbsp; Oh look!&nbsp; Something shiny!  Which totally reminds me of one of 
my favorite jokes (next to - how do you make a kleenex dance?&nbsp; Put a 
little boogie in it!)&nbsp; How many ADD kids does it take to change a 
lightbulb?&nbsp; Wanna ride bikes?!  Yeah!  Okay so anyway - I've decided Soda 
is Satan. It is evil and must be the reason I am fat (I'm sure ice cream has 
nothing to do with it - so ice cream is safe for now!)&nbsp; Today is &quot;no 
soda day 3.&quot;&nbsp; And I'm totally ROCKIN' this no soda thing.&nbsp; 
Seriously, it started because I need to drink more water.&nbsp; I need to drink 
more water because tanning makes you dehydrated (oh pool boy?!) Plus soda is 
BAD.&nbsp; Remember?  So today, I had fast food - the worst of all fast food 
even.&nbsp; McDonald's.&nbsp; Know what goes with grease?&nbsp; Soda!&nbsp; 
Guess what I had with my chicken mcnuggets?&nbsp; Water!!&nbsp; I rock!&nbsp; 
yeah me!  Okay - so I know that soda and coke and pop and whatever is called 
different things in different areas.&nbsp; So like in one part of the US it's 
all soda.&nbsp; In another everything is called Coke.&nbsp; Well, here in CA I 
call everything &quot;cola&quot; Coke.&nbsp; But the servers always say, 
&quot;Is Pepsi okay?&quot; (Pepsi is WAY BETTER...but that's an argument better 
left for another day)&nbsp; So when you're somewhere that they call everything 
COKE what if it's Pepsi?&nbsp; Or are all establishments like Pro-Coke and 
Pepsi isn't allowed - and OMG RC don't even think about it!&nbsp; Do they still 
ask people in those areas if Pepsi is okay?&nbsp; Why do I care about this?  
So, apparently I have a new sense of clarity that allows me to really analyze - 
well, everything.&nbsp; So today, at the bank, I saw a lady with a weird 
face.&nbsp; Her face wasn't ugly - there was just something strange about 
it.&nbsp; So I checked out her forehead to see if it was possible that she had 
a five-head and that was the problem.&nbsp; She did have an unusually large 
forehead, but it was not caused by the usual strange hairline that most 
five-headed people have.&nbsp; In fact, the problem with her face was that 
although her head was totally normal - her face was kind of small - and it was 
lower on her head than it should have been.&nbsp; She suffered from Poor Facial 
Placement.&nbsp; Sad.

<p>I think most people these days have ADD (I do). I blame tv &amp; the evil 
commercials. :)</p> <br>
