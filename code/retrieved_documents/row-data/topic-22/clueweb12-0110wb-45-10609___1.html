<title>Esmerel: Coke and the Mysteries of Life</title>

<h1>The Expiry Time on the Coke Bottle</h1>  Everyone loves Coca-Cola, right? 
Many Waldings prefer Coke to Pepsi. (And some Waldings, who are allergic to 
citric acid, can't even drink Pepsi; but that's a tale for another time.) But 
this page is not about the debate between Coke and Pepsi. This page is about 
the expiry time on the bottle.
<p> If you've ever bought a bottle of Coke, you've probably noticed that, 
beside the best-before date, there is always a time. On the nearest bottle, I 
see that it is Oct 13, 97 at 12:30. Does this really mean that the bottle of 
Coke is best not only before October 13, but before 12:30 on that day? We 
decided to write to Coke and find out.</p> 
<h2>A visit to the Coke site</h2> We visited the Official Coca-Cola site and 
explored. It's an interesting site that changes every day, and we also found a 
place to click and email our question. Here is what we wrote:
<p> <em> Hi there. I have a question about the expiry date and time on your 
Coca-Cola bottles. I know that the date on the bottle indicates the date at 
which the Coke expires. However, my question is what does the time on the 
bottle mean? Does it really mean that the Coke expires before that specific 
time? I am just curious and hope you can answer my question. Thank you.</em> 
</p> 
<h2>Response from Coca-Cola</h2> <em> Thank you for contacting The Coca-Cola 
Company via e-mail. We appreciate this opportunity to help you to understand 
what the coding means on our bottles.
<p> The date on the packaging is called the &quot;Optimum Taste Date&quot;. We 
recommend you consume the product by this date to enjoy the best taste. The 
time stamp that you see actually is the time of the day the product was 
produced in the production facility. Our products are safe to consume beyond 
the date but may have begun to lose their flavor.<br>
</p>
<p> If you ever have product that does not meet your expectation, please call 
us, 1-800-438-2653, and one of our representatives will be happy to assist you.
</p>
<p> If you have additional questions or comments, please visit our Web site 
again.</p></em>

<p> &quot;Optimum taste date&quot;, huh? Does that mean the Coke tastes better 
and better and better until that date, and then starts losing its flavour? 
Unfortunately, we never manage to keep bottles of Coke around here long enough 
to find out!</p>  Do you have any more questions? Check out:
