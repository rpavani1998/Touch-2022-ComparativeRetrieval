<h2>Pepsi Needs Coke</h2> 
<p>I was flying from Philadelphia to Orlando one evening in May, during the 
National Hockey League playoffs. As it happened, the Philadelphia Flyers were 
playing the Tampa Bay Lightning and Tampa Bay was getting the better of 
Philadelphia. The Florida-based flight crew periodically announced game 
developments, razzing the Philadelphians gently, at least at first. The 
passengers more than rose to the bait, responding with boos and catcalls. Tampa 
Bay won the game about the time we touched down and I felt a distinct mood 
shift from good-natured jocularity to something more tense. I wondered why. 
It&rsquo;s only a game, right?</p> 
<p> Identity in America is changing. A century ago, we knew ourselves by our 
region, state or hometown. The new immigrants clung to the ethnic enclave or 
the religion their parents brought from across the ocean. Trades, even 40years 
ago, were roughly divided on lines of national origin &ndash; Italian 
stonemasons, Irish painters and plasterers, German tool-and-die makers.<br>
<br>
 Two generations later, we&rsquo;ve lost our ethnic roots. Very few of us are 
of a single ethnicity and those who&rsquo;ve gone back to the old country know 
our cousins just think of us as &ldquo;the Americans.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve lost 
our regionalism. The true Vermont accent, with its rounded vowels and 
&ldquo;ayap&rdquo; interjections is increasingly rare, along with a thousand 
other shadings of American English.</p> 
<p> The new identity has to be portable, so we can carry it around the country 
as we chase our faceless jobs from town to town. Sports team identification is 
one thing we can take with us and Red Sox and Yankee fans glare at each other 
from beneath peaked caps all across the country.</p> 
<p> Pickup trucks wear bumper stickers reading, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather push a 
Chevy than drive a Ford,&rdquo; or vice versa. Worse is the decal of the little 
boy relieving himself on the opponent&rsquo;s corporate logo. What&rsquo;s the 
attraction in those? Is it not vacuous and vapid enough to derive your sense of 
self-worth from your pickup truck that you must now compound the idiocy by 
proclaiming your disdain for the make of truck you do not drive?</p> 
<p> By engaging in this behavior, we are responding exactly as programmed by 
our corporate masters. Among my acquaintances &ndash; you know who are are 
&ndash; are those who will walk out of a restaurant because it serves Pepsi 
rather than Coke. At this stage of the game, Pepsi and Coke need each other. 
Where would one brand be without the other to push against, to enforce brand 
loyalty, to keep the customers in line?</p> 
<p> A quarter-century ago, some whiz kid on the payroll at Miller Brewing got 
the brainstorm to pit the drinkers of Lite beer against each other, in groups 
of &ldquo;great taste&rdquo; and &ldquo;less filling.&rdquo; It was pure 
marketing genius and was only undermined by the fact that the product was 
undrinkable.</p> 
<p> Now politics is marketed to us the same way. There are Democratic 
&ldquo;blue&rdquo; states and Republican &ldquo;red&rdquo; states. (Oddly 
enough, they&rsquo;re the same colors associated with Pepsi and Coke, 
respectively &ndash; or the Crips and the Bloods. Ponder that.) States neither 
&ldquo;blue&rdquo; nor &ldquo;red&rdquo; are &ldquo;battlegrounds&rdquo; and 
the Crips and Bloods, uh, the Democrats and Republicans will be slugging it out 
from now until November.</p> 
<p> Although there are real difference between the parties and candidates this 
year, it&rsquo;s sad to hear civic debate devolve into knee-jerkery. It only 
encourages ad hominem, negative tactics and everyone is so busy defending 
&ldquo;our side&rdquo; from &ldquo;their side&rdquo; that accountability on all 
sides goes by the board.</p> 
<p> If you want to see where this can lead us, cast a glance toward Israel and 
Palestine. Two sides locked in a death struggle that may not only kill all of 
them, but is sucking in half the world besides. Decades of atrocities committed 
against &ldquo;us&rdquo; justify whatever we chose to do to &ldquo;them.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p> Four years after George Bush promised unity, not division the world is 
more polarized than perhaps it was at the height of the Cold War. It&rsquo;s 
time to realize the only true measure of an individual or nation must be based 
on how we act, not who we are &ndash; and it&rsquo;s time to start acting 
better than we have.</p>
