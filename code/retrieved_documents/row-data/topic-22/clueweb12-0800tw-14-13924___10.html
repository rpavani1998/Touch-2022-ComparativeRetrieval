<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you guys have ever heard about this, but there are 
certain small costs that, over time, tend to add up. I know, this is the first 
I&rsquo;m hearing about it too. For instance, if you buy a latte at the local 
Tim Horton&rsquo;s of Starbucks, you&rsquo;re shelling out like 3 bucks a trip. 
If you do that just 3 days a week, that&rsquo;s close to $10 a week, which is 
over $500 per year. Boom, I just figured out why you&rsquo;re struggling 
financially. Cut out the lattes, silly.</p> 
<p>In case you couldn&rsquo;t tell, most of that first paragraph was 
sarcastic. By now, most of us have figured out that recurring small expenses 
have a way of adding up over time. And yet, every time I go into Starbucks, the 
place is still relatively busy. Either people just don&rsquo;t care, or 
they&rsquo;ve found other areas to cut out of their budget so they can afford a 
nicecoffee sometimes.</p> 
<p>As much as I&rsquo;ve read about the latte factor, I&rsquo;ve read next to 
nothing about cutting out another drink that&rsquo;s overpriced, habit forming 
and can affect your behavior as well. Yes guys, I&rsquo;m talking about that 
favorite&nbsp;elixir that makes all ladies attractive to us, alcohol.</p> 
<p>There are all sorts of reasons why cutting out alcohol is much more 
effective than coffee. Generally, you don&rsquo;t tend to consume more than one 
expensive coffee a day, yet most of us can attest to sitting down at a bar and 
not getting back up until half a dozen drinks have been polished off.</p> 
<p>Each of those drinks isn&rsquo;t cheap either. I live in a sleepy small 
town, so we don&rsquo;t really have any swanky bars in my neck of the woods. 
Even the reasonably priced drinks locally will set you back a minimum of $6, 
once you tip the pretty girl who poured it for you. Considering that the 
ingredients of the drink cost the place about 50 cents, that&rsquo;s an awful 
big premium to pay for a little extra self confidence. I guarantee the latte 
folks aren&rsquo;t making that much off a coffee, yet they always get the bad 
rap.</p> 
<p>Used in small doses, alcohol can make an awkward guy slightly more charming 
or can help someone relax after a long day. If you overindulge though, the 
awkward guy becomes a blubbering moron and the guy who&rsquo;s trying to relax 
starts to get excited about the most pointless things, meaning they&rsquo;ve 
committed the same faux pas they set out to avoid.</p> 
<p>What goes great with alcohol? Deep fried bar food, that&rsquo;s what! Soon, 
the chicken wings, nachos and jalapeno poppers are at the table, 
which&nbsp;simultaneously expand your waistline and shrink your wallet. There 
goes another $20 down the drain. Oh well, at least you didn&rsquo;t spend it on 
lattes.</p> <br>

<p>As a teetotaler myself, I can attest to the pressure you&rsquo;ll get from 
your friends to join them in their boozing ways. In a lot of ways, peer 
pressure becomes even worse when you&rsquo;re an adult. What do you mean 
you&rsquo;re not drinking with us? What are you, some sort of wuss? I&rsquo;ve 
heard variations of those lines more times than I care to count. Your peers 
will be amazed and look at you like there&rsquo;s an extra foot growing out of 
your forehead. How can anyone possibly have fun without drinking?</p> 
<p>Just once, I want you to go out with your friends and substitute Diet Coke 
for your favorite alcoholic beverage. As long as there&rsquo;s a few of you at 
the table, the wait staff will be happy to keep refilling your soda for free, 
since they&rsquo;re getting ample tips from the others at the table. Plus, 
you&rsquo;ll often get your drink for free, since they&rsquo;ll just assume 
you&rsquo;re the designated driver. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you&rsquo;ll 
actually drive around your drunk friends. I&rsquo;d recommend against it, since 
drunk people are generally kind of annoying when you&rsquo;re sober.</p> 
<p>If you do insist on drinking, might I recommend a slight improvement on 
your methods? The kids call it pregaming, and while I can&rsquo;t say I approve 
of drinking to excess, this is a way to at least get the cost 
down.&nbsp;Pregaming, for those of you who aren&rsquo;t cool like me, means you 
start drinking at home, getting a &nbsp;little drunk by the time you make it to 
the bar. It&rsquo;s a way of stretching your drinking dollar.</p> 
<p>From a personal finance standpoint, drinking alcohol has the potential to 
be far costlier than drinking coffee. And yet, I never see any posts telling 
people to quit drinking. I&rsquo;m hoping this post changes your mind, since 
you&rsquo;ll probably annoy me if we ever meet up and you&rsquo;ve been 
drinking. I do want us to be friends.</p>

<p>I rarely have alcohol when I&rsquo;m out because the markups are so 
ridiculous, at least in restaurants. The same exact bottle of wine (same year, 
same vineyard) that I can buy at the liquor store for $18 costs $35 at my local 
restaurant.</p> 
<p>We don&rsquo;t drink much (only on weekends), so our policy is that when we 
do drink we get good stuff. Nice wines ($20 to $40 per bottle; my girlfriend is 
from France and has very discerning tastes..with few exceptions the wines over 
$50 aren&rsquo;t that much better for those under $40), and good beer. I have a 
bottle of 22-year-old Talisker single malt that is now about 30 years old, not 
because I&rsquo;ve been letting it age but because I have a sip once or twice a 
year.</p> 
<p>So in a nutshell my alcohol strategy is: buy high, consume low.</p>

<p>I attribute much of my vast wealth to the fact that I don&rsquo;t drink 
&ndash; LOL. Seriously though, I can&rsquo;t even imagine how much I&rsquo;ve 
saved over the years by not consuming alcohol. That&rsquo;s some serious coin 
for sure!</p> 
<p>The only thing I disapprove about this post is that you actually 
recommended that someone drink DIET COKE. That stuff is just plain nasty! Diet 
Pepsi is miles better and I&rsquo;m a Coke guy myself. If you&rsquo;re going to 
cut out the calories &ndash; at least drink Coke Zero instead. It tastes 
halfway decent!</p>

<p>Welcome Nelson. Great article. You are a hit.</p> 
<p>As far as liquor goes my hubby and I hardly drink. We actually have it on 
our list to do more. lol. Not that we are striving to become alcoholics but it 
mainly represents the need for us to loosen up and have more fun. We tend to 
get bogged down with work and the to do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;t have fun like 
we used to.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;re right though. It does add up and it really doesn&rsquo;t add 
that much to your life. There are much better things to do with your money.</p>

<p>I drink alcohol. Not ashamed of it. Control is key. I do enjoy a few pops 
and a scotch on the weekend.</p> 
<p>I rarely go out however. Once in a while with pals but we don&rsquo;t go to 
pubs or bars more than once a year, and even then, we usually go shoot pool. So 
my 3 Upper Canada Lagers and 1 Grants Scotch put me back $4.50 or so on a 
Friday night, compared to paying around $21 at a bar.</p> 
<p>And I bring my own fair trade organic (yummy!) coffee to work daily in a 
thermos. No booze in it though. ;)</p> </li>

<p>I join SPF in defense of alcohol and all things wonderful. Just a couple 
things to consider:</p> 
<p>In the golden glow of a couple of bourbon mojitos, your student debt is no 
longer a spiteful monkey on your back, but a fluffy white poodle in your lap.
</p> 
<p>Beer makes you more attractive and vastly improves your dancing (at least 
in one&rsquo;s own mind). Purveyors of beer know this fact. That&rsquo;s why 
beer is served in large quantities in venues likely to be infested with dancing 
fools.</p> 
<p>Alcohol-fueled personal interaction is more meaningful and emotive, e.g. 
&ldquo;I LOVE you, man!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Cigars + whiskey = good.<br>
 Cigars + Shirley Temple = not good.</p> 
<p>I could go on&hellip;</p>

<p>Alcohol fueled personal interaction isn&rsquo;t more meaningful. It&rsquo;s 
just louder and you say things you wouldn&rsquo;t sober. I&rsquo;m not sure 
that&rsquo;s a benefit.</p> 
<p>Also, one might argue drinking to forget your problems isn&rsquo;t the most 
effective way to deal with your problems. You don&rsquo;t forget, you just 
avoid.</p> 
<p>Cigars + anything = bad</p> </li> </ul></li>

<p>Good post Nelson!</p> 
<p>I agree with the article for the most part, but not about the costs of 
coffee over beer. Most of the beer in my fridge costs $1 per bottle! Can you 
get a coffee for under $1? I actually don&rsquo;t know because we brew all our 
coffee and expressos at home. I think the last time I visited Starbucks was 
years ago.</p> 
<p>Besides, some things in life are just worth the price, like good scotch ;)
</p> 
<p>Interesting what the kids call drinking before going out these days 
&ldquo;pregaming&rdquo;. I must be getting old, (in my 30&prime;s), we used to 
call it &ldquo;primers&rdquo;. Good &lsquo;ol days&hellip;.</p>

<p>I think the &ldquo;beer in your fridge&rdquo; = &ldquo;the coffee you make 
at home&rdquo;</p> 
<p>and the &ldquo;beer you buy for $4 in a bar&rdquo; = &ldquo;the coffee you 
buy for $3 at starbucks&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If you are trying to draw an analogy between the two drinks, that is.</p>

<p>Good post! I always see people pointing out expenses such as coffee or 
dining out during lunch, but rarely alcohol.</p> 
<p>Since my wife and I don&rsquo;t drink, we don&rsquo;t have to deal with the 
cost of alcohol&hellip;or the hidden costs (bar food). However, we get the 
short end of the stick on vacations. Whenever a place has a great deal for an 
&ldquo;all-inclusive&rdquo; package, it&rsquo;s only a great price for people 
who drink. If we&rsquo;re only getting water, then we are actually losing money!

<p>I don&rsquo;t really drink much, but when I started trying to spend only 
$200/month on groceries, I dropped even more! It&rsquo;s tough to convince 
myself to buy a 6-pack of cider for $12, when my whole grocery budget for the 
week is under $50!</p> 
<p>I went out to dinner with work folks a couple of weeks ago, and ended up 
spending $30 for half a turkey burger. I was trying to be frugal, and 
wasn&rsquo;t that hungry, so split a meal with one of the girls. Unfortunately, 
my coworkers started ordering rounds of shooters, and even though I declined to 
drink all but the first one, the ones ordered for me showed up on my bill (only 
the first couple of rounds, thank goodness.) My coworker who likes to act 
&ldquo;generous&rdquo; and pick up appetizers, etc, ended up spending almost 
$70. And believe me &ndash; those drinks weren&rsquo;t worth it!</p> </li>

<p>I think about this specific example all the time, but failed to put in the 
effort to convert it into such great words!</p> 
<p>I rarely drink. And even more rarely do I drink when I go out to eat.</p> 
<p>Last night, I actually, unwillingly, had a drink when I went out to the 
Keg. I had exactly enough cash on me to cover my meal (pre calculated with tip 
included). The place was packed and I had to go sit in the bar, at the counter 
at that. I was alone, so it didn&rsquo;t matter to me. But because I was 
sitting at the bar, I felt obliged to buy a drink, especially since I was 
eating there. The drink added 15% to the bottom line of my bill. This meant I 
had to use my credit card, spend over my budget, and leave with $30 cash more 
in my pocket than planned.</p>
