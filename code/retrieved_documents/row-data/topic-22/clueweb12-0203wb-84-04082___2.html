<p>But Really, I Prefer... <br>

<p>Some shoppers swear by their favorite brands. Why are they convinced 
it&rsquo;s better?<br>
<br>
 Those who think they&rsquo;re beyond the reach of 
marketing gimmicks might not have heard of neuromarketing, which is marketing 
using neuroscience to get you to buy a product.<br>
<br>
 Some call 
neuromarketing transformative, while others believe it&rsquo;s unethical 
because it uses brain imaging to uncover your deepest emotions, then uses the 
information to create ads that induce you to buy.<br>
<br>
 Traditional 
marketing has relied on questionnaires and focus groups to gauge 
consumers&rsquo; responses to new and existing products.<br>
<br>
 
Unfortunately, what people think is not always what they say, which makes the 
marketing data unreliable.<br>
<br>
 As most can relate, people usually give 
answers that are more socially acceptable and make them look good.<br>
<br>
 
The data gathered with neuromarketing gives a much deeper and honest assessment 
of a person&rsquo;s unfiltered reaction to a product.<br>
<br>
 Several years 
ago, a group of researchers set out to do their own &ldquo;Pepsi 
Challenge&rdquo; and test whether consumer emotions drive purchase decisions. 
Scientists put consumers inside a functional magnetic resonance imager while 
taking the &ldquo;Pepsi Challenge.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 The imager is a noninvasive 
test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to monitor blood flow 
changes in the brain, revealing which areas are active. While being monitored 
with the imager, people taking the &ldquo;Pepsi Challenge&rdquo; did not know 
which drinks were Coke and Pepsi. Half ended up choosing Pepsi and activated 
the areas of their brain associated with rational thought.<br>
<br>
 When 
participants learned which drink was Coke, the areas associated with emotions 
were stimulated, and they switched their preference to Coke. This meant 
positive emotions can overrule rational thought &mdash; a result of brand 
loyalty.<br>
<br>
 Another method of monitoring brain activity is through 
electroencephalograms, which measure the electrical activity in the brain. 
These show certain products also activate parts of the brain that anticipate 
rewarding stimuli such as food, sex and addictive drugs.<br>
<br>
 These 
results have marketers attempting to access and manipulate hidden desires and 
preferences that reside deep in the brain. They&rsquo;ve already begun using 
electroencephalograms to determine which ads stimulate strong emotions so they 
will be remembered longer.<br>
<br>
 Some might ask, is this ethical? Are ads 
designed using neuromarketing going to have people buying products they 
don&rsquo;t need, want or cannot afford? Supporters say no ad campaign can turn 
people into lemmings.<br>
<br>
 Still, you might want to ask, am I making a 
rational or emotional purchase?</p>
