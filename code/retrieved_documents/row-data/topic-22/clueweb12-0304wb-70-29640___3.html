<p></p> 
<p>Once a month, The Marketing Dialog examines a marketing campaign and asks 
the question, &ldquo;Brilliant Marketing or What?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This month&rsquo;s subject came from a very hard dose of reality I 
encountered last week when I was speaking with a junior member of our staff and 
mentioned New Coke.&nbsp; I got that &lsquo;deer caught in the 
headlights&rsquo; look that told me she had never heard of New Coke, nor 
probably had anyone in her generation since this all happened in the 
mid-80&rsquo;s.&nbsp; So for you who are old enough to remember, take a trip 
down memory lane with me as I distill the New Coke experience, with the benefit 
of 20/20 hindsight, for the younger researchers.</p> 
<p>It should be noted that before New Coke was introduced, Pepsi was 
conducting its very successful marketing campaign &lsquo;The Pepsi 
Challenge&rsquo; that compared Coke to Pepsi. In the taste-test challenges, 
Pepsi usually won but not for the right reasons.&nbsp; Respondents were offered 
a cold, fresh cup of Pepsi next to a lukewarm, flat cup of Coke.&nbsp; Which 
would you choose?&nbsp; With so many dollars at stake in the soda category, it 
isn&rsquo;t a surprise that research methodologies are occasionally skewed.</p> 
<p>Coke market share began declining and the company embarked on extensive 
marketing research to determine the correct response. Based on many, many focus 
groups and taste tests, Coke concluded that the answer was solely the taste of 
the product.&nbsp; The taste tests were conducted offering respondents a choice 
between a small cup of regular Coke, a small cup of a sweeter formula of Coke 
and a small cup of Pepsi that resulted in the roll-out of New Coke.&nbsp; The 
sweeter Coke usually was preferred. However, although a small cup of a sweeter 
drink may taste better at the time, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that a 
12 ounce &lsquo;sweeter&rsquo; drink would be preferred.&nbsp; Too much of a 
sweet thing might not be what Coke drinkers wanted.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Nonetheless, Coke marketers&rsquo; faith in their taste tests was so 
strong, since the sweeter mixture beat both Pepsi and &lsquo;regular&rsquo; 
Coke, New Coke was introduced in 1985 to replace the original drink formula. 
New Coke was immediately put into production and the original drink was 
completely discontinued.</p> 
<p>The public&rsquo;s reaction to New Coke &ndash; or more accurately to the 
discontinuation of the original Coke formula - was sudden and severe.&nbsp; 
Although market research showed that 80 percent of the American public was 
aware of the change within days and the company&rsquo;s stock went up after the 
announcement, that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a good thing.&nbsp; The mistake 
made was treating Coke as any other brand and not as a true American icon.</p> 
<p>Although most tasters liked the sweeter New Coke formula, 10 percent - 12 
percent of consumers stated that they were angry that Coke would consider 
changing the original recipe and some went so far as to state that they would 
stop drinking Coke altogether rather than switch to Pepsi.&nbsp; Anti-New Coke 
groups sprang up overnight, most vocal in the South (home of Coca-Cola), and it 
soon became apparent that consumers were more upset about the withdrawal of the 
original formula than pleased with the taste of the new one.&nbsp; In fact, 
these consumers told researchers that it felt like they were discussing the 
death of a family member versus a soft drink.</p> 
<p>The switch lasted just 77 days until Coca-Cola announced it was bringing 
back Coke &lsquo;Classic.&rsquo; Even then, however, consumers were suspicious 
of Coke and didn&rsquo;t think Classic tasted like the original recipe. They 
were right since Coke had substituted cane sugar in the original formula for 
high-fructose corn syrup, which gives the drink a different taste (but is less 
expensive for the company to use in manufacturing the product.) &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Adding to the confusion, immediately after the switch, 
&lsquo;conspiracy&rsquo; rumors flew that Coke had done this as a marketing 
ploy to increase sales in the original brand when it was reintroduced.&nbsp; In 
response to this, Donald Keogh, Coke&rsquo;s president at the time stated, 
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not that dumb, and we&rsquo;re not that smart&rdquo;.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>What Coke failed to anticipate was the visceral connection consumers felt 
to the product they grew up with.&nbsp; The Coke marketers finally concluded 
was that it hadvastly underestimated the size of the public who would be 
alienated by the switch, even when introduced to a new product they perceived 
was preferred.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By 2002, Coke II, as it was eventually called, was discontinued 
entirely.&nbsp; In a strange twist, however, if you look at the soda shelves 
these days, you will see &lsquo;retro&rsquo; soda formulations, such as the 
&lsquo;original&rsquo; Mountain Dew and &lsquo;original&rsquo; Pepsi being 
offered to consumers.&nbsp; The primary difference in the 
&lsquo;original&rsquo; versus the current formulations is that the 
&lsquo;retro&rsquo; versions use sugar, not corn syrup as the sweetener.&nbsp; 
Since it&rsquo;s been over 25 years since New Coke debuted, maybe it&rsquo;s 
time to try it as a brand extension for their existing core products. However, 
they should definitely not call it New Coke!&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Should we give New Coke a second chance or relegate it to the long list 
of case studies of products that failed?&nbsp; Do you think the research 
conducted was faulty &ndash; or just not thorough enough?</b></p>

<h3>Comments</h3>  i think they were little overconfident because of past coke 
lagacy.. they might have some kind of strong assumptions in their minds that 
what ever they do with coke it would not decrease their consumer width... 
though people were addicted of coke but what the manufacturers forgot is &quot; 
its not only the name of coke which drived people mad but they were addicted of 
its origenal taste&quot; so the research was both faulty and not thorough 
enough! Posted @ Tuesday, September 20, 2011 2:00 PM by laila amjad <br>
 John, 
thanks for your article on New Coke.It's a thoughtful article on an always 
interesting topic. You forgot to comment on the huge egos involved in the 
decision, including the Surge man. The brilliance was in their recovery, 
leveraging the brand's short term demise by re-energizing it with new levels of 
loyalty. Pepsi has not recovered.&nbsp;<br>
Don Keough said it was a great 
marketing gambit, but he was not smart enough to actually plan it.&nbsp;<br>

Great companies make their own luck. Posted @ Thursday, September 22, 2011 
10:32 AM by Pete Booth  Sorry, I have to disagree with the stated Coke-Pepsi 
facts. Early in my research career, I was asked to examine the consumer 
research used to justify the Pepsi Challenge claim that in a blind taste test, 
the majority of declared Coke drinkers preferred Pepsi. I didn't design or 
conduct the research. I only examined it after the fact to see if the claim 
could withstand an expected legal challenge. Without going into details, I 
found the research to be properly conducted including the tricky issue of 
sample selection. Respondents weren&rsquo;t given cold Pepsi vs. luke warm flat 
Coke. And Coke never challenged Pepsi in court. The rest of John&rsquo;s 
assertions are correct as far as I know. Pepsi won the challenge because it is 
(was) slightly sweeter. And Coke, in its own taste tests found that in brand 
unidentified taste tests, Coke users preferred a sweeter formulation than their 
&ldquo;Classic&rdquo; Coke &ndash; so Coke changed the formula and the name. 
Wrong. Coke drinkers were loyal the brand, not just to the taste. And they 
punished Coke for taking away part of their heritage. Posted @ Friday,

You 
were obviously a little closer to the action than I was - I just know what I 
observed when the Pepsi Challenge came to my city and I guess it's like a lot 
of research facilities - some are good, others, not so. The group that was 
conducting the 'test' I saw were clearly weighting the results in Pepsi's 
favor, whether they were instructed to or not. And I totally agree with your 
last statement - especially in the South, Coke was the generic name for any 
soda when I was growing up, which usually was a Coca-Cola, and maybe New Coke 
would have succeeded if they had 'prepped' consumers beforehand, but as you 
point out, they completely ignored the 'heritage' of Coke and its deep 
connection with consumers before surprising them - bad marketing!. Thanks for 
your comments! Posted @ Wednesday, September 28, 2011 4:07 PM by John Grafton 
<br>  Thanks for your comments Pete! And the amazing thing to me was that 
nobody lost their job over it! To fire someone would be admitting that Coke 
made a mistake - and thed'll never admit to that. Posted @ Wednesday, September

 Not all the 
time no one can win the match of stock market trade , humans are bounded with 
emotions and personal affairs that makes them to take wrong decisions at right 
time even though they are masters of trade. Markets dramatically change they 
their flow and no one exactly produce or expect 100% from their profits . 
Choosing the right indicator or analyzing software blended with human aspect 
gives better results.&nbsp;<br>
