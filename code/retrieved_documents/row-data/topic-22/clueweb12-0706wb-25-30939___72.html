<p>
&hellip;.bzzz&hellip;.snap&hellip;.crackle&hellip;awheeeeeeyoooooo&hellip;distortion&hellip;.static&hellip;fade 
in&hellip;. Excuse me while I break into your regularly scheduled programming 
of corporate identity changes to focus on another aspect of 
Brand&acirc;&acirc;&#128;&#158;&cent;: packaging. I&rsquo;ve worked in both the 
corporate identity and packaging fields for over 10 years now. If I could sum 
up my general feeling on mass-market packaging (in the United States), 
I&rsquo;d say it sucks. At some point, there are only so many variations one 
can do on ribbons, splashes, swooshes, dimensional type and fake water 
droplets. When small percentage points of market share can mean hundreds of 
millions of dollars, you can kind of understand. Kind of. So it thrills me to 
no end when someone of stature refuses to do it anymore.</p> 
<p>I present the New Old Coke.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>For years, since the early 90s really, the familiar red can of Coca-Cola 
has added more and more elements. From splashes and exploding bottles to 
buttons to polar bears to fizzies and water drops, the can has seen many 
permutations. To what end, though? Convincing people that this drink which they 
know so well is still the same drink? At the point which you have an iconic 
product that, as long as you don&rsquo;t screw with the formula, everyone 
knows, how do you keep refreshing the brand? It&rsquo;s a tough challenge, and 
Coke&rsquo;s really pulled out a beauty here.</p> 
<p>They&rsquo;ve essentially done absolutely nothing. All the extra bits and 
doodads and extraneous graphics are gone. Classic coke imagery: the red, the 
ribbon, and the coke script. &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; is even in a simple 
lowercase sans serif. This is a confident design. Coca-cola is acknowledging 
that we all know the product, so just drink it. They&rsquo;ve given similar 
treatment to the majority of the Coke line, including Diet and Zero. Simple, 
back to basics, pure equity. Compared with Pepsi&rsquo;s blow-it-all-out 
how-many-designs-can-we-produce-in-a-summer strategy, this takes guts. You just 
don&rsquo;t see that all too often from one of the largest brands in the world 
and I certainly appreciate it.</p> 
<p>(If you want to see a large collection of cans, dating way back to the 50s, 
checkthis site out.)</p> 
<p>I now return you to your regularly scheduled program, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s 
Not My Logo&rdquo;.

<p>Hooray! I was ecstatic when I saw the new can for the first time; thanks 
for giving it mention here. Coke got it right: This can is perfect.</p>

<p>Growing up in the 90's this design brings back a great era of graphic 
design!</p> 
<p>Yes this is excellent keep it simple, clean and drinkable.</p> 
<p>I LOVE IT!</p> 
<p>this is what Coca-Cola is all about, it's recognizable symbol, thats what 
make Coke!</p> 
<p>Now Pepsi, how about you shed some extra graphic pounds?</p>

<p>Just saw Moira Cullen at an AIGA Retreat and she was proudly showing off 
her cans. Wait, that did not sound right! Was discussing her cans. Again, not 
so right sounding.</p> 
<p>Anyhow, as design director of Coke, she said you would not believe how hard 
it was to redesign the can and NOT have bubbles on the cans!</p> 
<p>I agree, absolutely pure and beautiful. </p>

<p>What? Ugh.</p> 
<p>This modernist obsession is getting creepy. This is <em>not</em> well 
executed simplicity. There's absolutely no elegance. Where is the white-space? 
Why is the logo so big? How will the back - with all its text and code-bars - 
integrate ?</p> 
<p>This just looks like those Dharma packagings in Lost (sorry for the poor 
reference, let's try again). This feels like Orwell's '84. It says : &quot;You 
drink coke - because it's coke and that's how it has to be&quot;. While it used 
to say : &quot;You're having coke here. Refreshing, warm-harted, sparkling. You 
like it that way don't you?&quot;</p> 
<p>Man, I liked the mini yellow stripe.</p> 
<p>They <em>are</em> going to loose market-share with this, and luckily we'll 
be back to the old soon.</p> 
<p>How would apple look if it's logo spread it's fat ass all over the place 
like this, and didn't even have the subte gradients, the glow, the deliquate 
tints? Because none of this is here. This is not well executed simple design, 
this is non-design. Elements that are<strong>just</strong> put together, in a 
rather clumpsy, undeliberate way.</p> 
<p>How it should have been : horizontal, way smaller logo. Smack in the 
middle. One type for all products. I mean, how can one justify that 
&quot;ZeR0&quot; thing, there? And the swoosh? How about getting rid of it? It 
has even less meaning than the water-droplets, and way way less functions than 
that old little touch of yellow.</p> 
<p>All that unanimous praise is seriously disappointing me (not a very 
constructive thing to say - but I really feel so).</p>

<p>If only consumers would learn how to be monolithic this would all be so 
much easier... The reality is that there is no such thing as &quot;good&quot; 
design and &quot;bad&quot; design. There is effective, there is popular, 
elegant even; but certainly not &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.</p> 
<p>Obviously because we [designers] were all educated in similar educational 
programs, read the same magazines, and studied the same &quot;Old Masters&quot; 
we tend to have an idea about what &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; designs 
are. But, those ideas are extremely biased.</p> 
<p>I don't think this new/old can is any better or worse than it's 
predecessor. It is certainly clean, but it's the same old thing; no creativity; 
just a reaching back to an old design and calling it retro or classic as a 
means to explain why Coke should write a check for the design. Honestly, if I 
saw this can on the shelf next to it's predecessor I would assume they were 
years-old overstock and grab the more detailed can. Just a study of one there, 
nothing to it really.</p> 
<p>Americans have always favored &quot;simple&quot; designs for one reason... 
THEY ARE CHEAPER TO PRINT. This goes for logos and packaging. But, to assume 
that the American public prefers simple is absurd because us pesky consumers 
REFUSE to just become monolithic drones who think and act the same way.</p> 
<p>Here's a project I have had my students do that I have never had to do 
myself. Drive through four different neighborhoods:</p> 
<p>1. A rich, white neighborhood<br>
 2. A working class, ethnically diverse 
neighborhood<br>
 3. A lower class, ethnically diverse neighborhood<br>
 4. An 
African-American ghetto (the projects).</p> 
<p>Pay ONLY attention to the companies that ONLY service that demographic and 
see how much their ads vary. There is a HUGE difference in what 
&quot;good&quot; design is between a Celine Dion CD and a Little John or Master 
P CD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Many would contend that the Lil John and Master P CDs 
are NOT Good Design (myself included), but the record label that sells the CDs 
would say that the design is PERFECT.</p> 
<p>The new Coke can works for a certain demographic, but certainly not mine. 
Doesn't mean it is bad or good, just means that they missed my demo. Maybe I 
wasn't their target, and most often for companies this large Anglos around the 
globe are the main target and they will have sub-identities for the world's 
minorities. This is because, they recognize the limitations of a design, even a 
good one, when distributed on a global scale.</p> 
<p>My opinion, for what it's worth, is this is an effective design; as 
effective as the first hundred times they used it. It is truly classic, and 
because of Coke's history, it will always be a good design to fall back on. 
But, it's really no better than it's predecessor. It is going to be cheaper to 
print, so it is a winner in that regard, but not as artistic.</p> 
<p>Did Coke win with this design... It's a draw as far as I can see, and I 
doubt the can alone will do much to improve sales. The other re-rebranding 
elements are nice as I love &quot;classic&quot; designs, and maybe that was 
their focus more so than the packaging itself.</p>

<p>I think it's especially important they did this with all the varieties and 
flavors Coke now comes in. As you said in contrast to &quot;Pepsi's 
blow-it-all-out how-many-designs-can-we-produce-in-a-summer strategy&quot; this 
makes it really easy to distinguish which product is what with the simplest 
possible visual cues. If I were to buy Pepsi right now I'd have to read the 
label just to be certain I was getting plain old regular Pepsi!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>I agree with the last 2 posts... As I myself prefer Coke over the other 
colas, I was taken aback by the latest reincarnation of this classic. Ok. I get 
it, retro is back as it is every other decade. Though if I saw this design next 
to one of the more graphic cans, I would most definately pick up the more 
graphic. This is stricktly due to knowing that it was canned sometime this 
decade.</p> 
<p>I like the simplicity of the design, but the design was poorly executed. 
The font is MUCH to large and overall quite boring to look at. To me it looks 
as though they got lazy and decided to look at an ancient can and carbon copy 
it.</p> 
<p>The idea of a throwback is nice... clean lines on solid color can make 
quite the impact, but they missed the mark and my demographic as well.</p> 
<p>I will look forward to the next rollout.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>WOW! Where to begin? Having worked at The Coca-Cola Company, in the same 
department that Moria Cullen now runs, I can imagine getting this design 
approved was hell on earth.</p> 
<p>Having been there in the 90's, I can tell you the reason a Coke package can 
end up with a million appendages is because the brand marketing MBA's spend 
millions of hours writing brand strategies that talk about effervescence and 
refreshment and believe that each package should communicate EVERYTHING!</p> 
<p>I did notice in stores, that the 2L bottles have a few sparce bubbles 
splattered about. I can only guess this was a compromise with the higher ups.
</p> 
<p>I would say to the couple nay-sayers here that the beauty of this design is 
that it allows people young an old and from each sub-culture to endow their own 
feelings and meaning to this iconic brand. That is the value of good simple 
design. Advertising and marketing can build specific experiences and 
connections with the differnt target groups, while this icon stands strong and 
grows more valuable. From what I have heard, this trademark is so valuable, 
that if the company lost EVERYTHING - buildings, equipment, people, facilities, 
etc. EVERYTHING all over the world, but still retained ownership of this TM, 
they could get a loan off it's value to start over completely. Tell that to 
your next client who does not understand the value of design.</p> 
<p>And now my only fear is that sales may shift because of some price of an 
ingredient in Argentina or whereever and this very appropriate design will be 
blamed. See the great work of Duffy Design from the 90's on Diet Coke, Minute 
Maid, Fruitopia, etc. Great design that was bastardized after only a few short 
years.</p> 
<p>An identity this well produced does not happen with out a design thinking 
champion on the inside! I hope it last!</p>

<p>All the comments on how the font on the new can is too large, while 
praising the previous design confuses me. To me, the font is the same size - 
they simply dropped the bevels, shading, and 3-D effects.</p>

<p>I suspect the client isn't as confident as the designer about reverting to 
the simplified look.</p> 
<p>Look closely at the promotional photos of the new cans (and not just in 
these examples you found): they all have water droplets on the cans to 
substitute for the ones that used to be painted on.</p>

<p>There was recently a light brand of Coke released in my area that came in a

Lite, but can't remember and no longer see it on the shelves. It was only in 
CVS and I thought it was a Pepsi product until I got a closer look. If anybody 
knows anything about this PLEASE share it with me. I am willing to bet it 
either flopped or Pepsi sued them but I can't find that info.</p>

<p>Agreed Jeff. The placement and size of the logo seems the same. Also, I 
don't feel like you can tout the way the barcodes and tables integrate into the 
old can at all.</p> 
<p>Coke's brand as mentioned above is almost unrivaled. There was (is?) a 
billboard outside of Austin,TX that was simply a silhouetted Coke botttle on 
it's side. The caption read &quot;Quick, name a soft drink...&quot; What I like 
about the new can is it actually has more bravado than the old can. It says, 
this is Coke. You know it, you know you love it, so screw all the other stuff. 
To me that's something I can get behind.</p> 
<p>As a disclaimer, I'm a snooty designer who happens to believe that Coke is 
the greatest chemical concoction mankind has ever invented.</p>

<p>Jeff : you don't seem to be getting my point. The older cans weren't good 
graphic design. They were overly commercial, but had the merit to effectively 
communicate something, that was actually quite correct.</p> 
<p>Now these cans seem to try to make a statement - of simplicity, retro, 
whatever. And fail at it, both graphically and communicatively : they're 
inelegant and don't communicate a thing any more.</p> 
<p>So yes, I rather have something that's ugly <em>but</em> dynamic, and that 
fits the feelings drinking coke could get me, rather than something ugly, and 
ugly, and also just plain ugly.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>My personal feeling on the Diet Coke brand is that Coca-Cola really doesn't 
quite know what to do with it. For years, it has been a stand-alone product, 
i.e. the design was independent of the red classic can. In the last redesign 
(with all the fizzies and bubbles), they brought it back to being a sub-brand 
of classic coke. I make the assumption that this was because the connotation of 
&quot;diet&quot; in the marketplace was changing dramatically (witness all the 
&quot;zero&quot; beverages) and they couldn't support a unique positioning for 
it any longer. It surprised me when it first came out, and I'm still a little 
surprised that they continued this with the latest design.</p>

<p>My first thought when I first saw it (the blue can, not the gray &amp; blue 
one) I thought it was a Pepsi product. Then when I finally realized it was a 
Coke product I thought it was a concession that their competitor's color was 
better. A BLUE COKE BOTTLE!!! Hell has truly frozen over.</p>

<p>Wow. I love the 'back to basics' approach for Coke. The red can and white 
script speak everything the world has come to know or needs to know about the 
brand.</p> 
<p>Coke's packaging has become so extraneous over the past several years, this 
was bound to be the next direction. They've not completely abandoned the 
frills, though - go look at packaging and ads for Sprite, Vault, and some of 
their other non-Coke brands. They're exhausting.</p>

<p>Jon - That has been a struggle for Coke for 20+ years. The more line 
extensions they add, the more they seem confused to have brands like diet and 
cherry Coke be their own brand or flavor extensions. It flips back and forth 
with almost every new CMO.</p> 
<p>Plus, you are right, with the changing beverage world of waters and teas, 
etc. the diet soft drink category has suffered.</p>

<p>Tom &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;&Acirc;&Acirc;&nbsp;Coke's introduction of Coke 
Zero typifies that confusion. The original design was very silver, similar to 
Diet Coke. My initial reaction when I saw it in stores was that they were 
following the Sprite strategy, which renamed Diet Sprite as Sprite Zero (and 
lost the Diet language completely). It seemed a bold move for what had been, 
essentially, a stand-alone product in the Coke line. The longer Diet Coke and 
its various iterations stayed on the market, the more confusing it became. 
Converting Coke Zero to a primarily black can was a smart move (along with 
elimination of C2...). I'm still not completely sure of the difference between 
Diet Coke and Coke Zero (preferring to just go with the hard stuff when I have 
it), but at least I can separate them visually.</p>

<p>I wonder how much age plays into how people are reacting to this. There's a 
certain level of nostalgia for me; it evokes the design of Coke cans before the 
New Coke debacle, back when I was a child and the Cola Wars had yet to start. 
The difference seems to be that &quot;Classic&quot; replaced &quot;Enjoy&quot; 
on the label.</p> 
<p>It's minimalism and nostalgia all in one. Maybe Coke is conceding the 
African-American audience to Pepsi with this, or maybe not screaming above the 
energy drink cans with aggressive colors and logos is going to hurt their 
market share with teenagers. I don't know. But for those of us over the age of 
30, it's a reminder of how simple things were when we were children.</p>

<p>I don't think sheer nostalgia is what will sell this. It's certainly not a 
long-term strategy. In this instance, the can is simply an icon and should look 
contemporary but not overdone, and they've achieved that. The advertising and 
primary marketing channels (I see the can as secondary here) will drive the 
messaging. It's also possible that Coke has realized how hard it is to be all 
things to all people.</p>

<p>The striking thing about the new can to me isn't the lack of graphics, it's 
that red; it blazes. I can't see muddying that up with a bunch of effects. I've 
long thought that it's about time that a soft drink company stop reminding 
people about the stomach lining-damaging carbonation they're about to consume.

<p>BTW this this can isn't based on nostalgia if it was they would use the old

different back then.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So in essence they are using the current mark NOT the old one.</p>

<p>Less is more. </p> 
<p>It always starts out with an innocent outline -y'know, to give it a little 
<strong>PUNCH</strong>. <br>
 And then a drop shadow -to, y'know, make it 
<strong>POP</strong>. <br>
 And then a gradient &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;y'know to 
make it<strong>SHINEY</strong>...<br>
 Then come the add-onns: bubbles, 
halftone patterns, sparkles, textures! more colors! Colored halftone shadows. 
Ooh! what's that filter called?!</p> 
<p>Pretty soon, you wake up one day -just as Michael Jackson does 
everyday&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; and look in the mirror and say in horror,<strong>
&quot;What have I done?!!!&quot; &quot;I was beautiful just the way I was 
created!&quot;</strong></p> 
<p>Thankfully, in design, you can undo.</p> 
<p>There's a proper application for all of those effects and filters but the 
point is:</p> 
<p>K.I.S.S. wins every time.</p> 
<p>Design is about communication. The more voices talking at the same time, 
the harder it becomes to hear/understand the message.</p> 
<p>Stick to the basics: Line. Shape. Color.</p> 
<p>Less is MORE.</p> 
<p>I've never drunk a Coke or Pepsi in my life but I'll definately buy that 
can and place it next to my classic 8 oz. green-glass Coke bottle. I have a 
feeling it won't last for long.</p> 
<p>What flavor <em>is</em> Coke anyway? It smells like some carpet cleaning 
chemical.</p>

<p>The new &quot;old&quot; design is a step in the right direction.</p> 
<p>However, is the word &quot;classic&quot; even necessary? It was introduced 
when the classic formula was brought back to differentiate it from &quot;New 
Coke&quot;.</p> 
<p>Since New Coke is no longer produced, the word &quot;classic&quot; on its 
product serves only as a reminder of its marketing blunder.</p>

better than the dreck we've seen the past 10 years or so. Of course I'm a big

Monday that the new look can will hit the Japanese market on Jan 29 before its

<p> I disagree that the Australian cans are &quot;how it should be&quot;. 
Using the existing product logos with the super clean, flat, modern graphics on 
the can seems like visual disconnect to me. Those marks are big and bold and I 
believe that weight and energy causes them to look floaty in all that space not 
at home in it.</p>

<p>I think the Aussie cans ROCK! But this conversation underlies something 
that we all know is true. THERE IS NO SINGULAR METHOD FOR DESIGN.</p> 
<p>The conversation appears to be going this way:</p> 
<p>&quot;I love it, it's clean and simple.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I hate it, it's boring.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;You're an idiot, this is an elegant design.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;No, you're an arrogant design junkie, the people want something 
different.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;WHAT! The people don't know what they want. It is the job of the 
designer to tell people what they want because they don't know.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;What, we are supposed to GIVE the people what they want.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p> 
<p>This plays out over and over again and in the end Coke is still going to 
make Billions. If the Aussies like the cans (and this guy too) then that is 
probably why they were launched there and not here.</p> 
<p>I think it is time for ALL of us to admit that we are not the center of the 
design universe, and while it is fine to say that we don't like or appreciate 
something; it is not our place to try to hold every logo that is released to 
our individual standards.</p> 
<p>The BLATANT exception to all of this mumbo jumbo I said is the 2012 
Olympics logo. I think we can all agree that someone took a steaming pile of 
feces, threw it against the wall, and with their finger scribbled &quot;London 
2012&quot; in it.</p>

 3. relabel the 
before and after to be the opposites, or dont label it all</p> 
<p>you'll get a different response I'm sure.<br>
 Its great to see Coke doing 
somthing like this, but I believe there's value in the &quot;before&quot; can 
as well. Packaging design is always evolving to meet consumer/marketing needs, 
Package designs change every 6months to 3years depending on the campaign while 
corporate identities should last at least 8years or more. (minus that awful new 
att logo, someone needs to redo that one soon).</p> 
<p>The designer in me loves the simple, uncluttered can but its a whole new 
ball game when looking into that 2-way mirror. Which one says 
&quot;refreshing&quot; which one says &quot;fun&quot; which one says coke is a 
beverage, which one says its a corporation. Which one is 2007 vs 1990?</p>

<p>I don't even like Coke, but this design is beautiful in it's simplicity. It 
takes away some of the &quot;BUY ME - DRINK ME!&quot; all caps, all 
exclamations, whoring itself kind of look, and I like that.</p> 
<p>An iconic brand should be able to retain it's integrity for longer than a 
summer. I believe I read a while back that Coke had reached it's pinnacle of 
world-wide saturation and public awareness - anyone who could possibly drink 
Coke knows about it by now.</p> 
<p>I'm still not going to drink it (nothing short of the promise of riches 
could get me to buy Coke) but I really like the look.</p>

<p>The yellow stripe brings warmth, and tones the whole thing down a bit.</p> 
<p>I couldn't remember who or when, but I once saw an interview of the guy 
behind the yellow stroke (it got him famous). If I remember well, it was added 
after the new Coke fiasco. Surprisingly, the guy seemed to say the yellow 
stripe is a huge part of what brought coke back to live subversively. Sales 
went back up immediately.</p> 
<p>That simple intervention has the ability to de-dramatize the can, to give 
it a more human and accessible feeling. In that perspective, it has as much use 
and reason to exist as the wave (which expresses dynamism, flow...). Its 
absence shows either one of two things : the point is either to cut down on the 
price of the printing, or to be nostalgic (which any trends-agency will tell 
you is not a right move at all for 2008-09, for what it's worth). But if the 
point was to act &quot;less-is-more&quot;, it clearly failed in my perspective. 
There's either too much uselessness for it to be elegant or too few elements 
for it be communicative.</p> 
<p>Regarding the Aussie can : the circle-bottle-graphic and the slimness of 
the can indeed give it an energy-drink look, and are likely unneeded. I was 
more referring to the lack of wave, the smallness and position of the logo and 
the almost equal treatment of the names.</p> 
<p>But Corey is right, Coke remains Coke and its millions, its need to please 
all worldwide and I'm not ever expecting anything brilliant to come from them 
anyway. Which is presumably why this post has irritated me. Sorry, but it 
really takes to be an American to be fooled by Coca-Cola's trying to be 
&quot;the real thing&quot; in packaging (as Pedro shows with more diplomacy in 
his comment above).</p>

<p>I think the point here is that we can't move forward with understanding the 
latest Coke design while we, as designers, do not learn how to discuss a design.
</p> 
<p>I believe there were only three of four comments worth reading. The rest 
were just a repetition of the other: the design is good, they loved it, and 
Coke is my favorite soda. Who cares! What difference does it make?</p> 
<p>We must expand our vocabulary and move beyond &quot;good,&quot; &quot;love 
it,&quot; etc.</p> 
<p>Just because one happens to like one design it doesn't mean it is the best. 
I wonder if all those who have said that the new Coke design is 
&quot;great&quot; (whatever that is supposed to mean) just say so because if 
given the opportunity they wouldn't have done better than what that latest 
design did.</p> 
<p>If one thinks that one design is good... explain why! Your own nostalgia 
ain&acirc;&euro;&acirc;&#132;&cent;t helping to understand why 
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;new/old&acirc;&euro;&Acirc;&#157; designs work.<br>

<p>What the heck does that even mean? At this point, Coke doesn't need to 
&quot;communicate&quot; anything beyond the fact that it's a can of Coke. If 
the &quot;after&quot; can communicates anything, it says &quot;Coke&quot;. The 
&quot;before&quot; can says &quot;Coke!!LOL!!111&quot;. I just want a goddamn 
soda.<br>

<p>I would posit that the new design is superior to the old as it gives more 
surface area to show off the bubbles and condensation which arise on the can as 
it is exposed to room temp. I suspect, although I don't have the data to back 
this up, that a potential drinker is likely to have a more positive 
appreciation for a can which supports that natural process and shows the user 
that the temperature of the Coke is perfect rather than a fake set of bubbles 
or condensation or a design which is so busy it does not lend itself to showing 
off this aspect of the soda drinking experience. In that respect the best 
design might very well include as much color field as possible to give the 
condensation bubbles ample room to show off.</p> 
<p>Or I might be biased as I immediately recognized the design closer to the 
pre-New Coke debacle and was encouraged and gratified by this return to form. 
But I would like to think that the designers are smart enough to know how 
important the condensation is to the visceral experience of drinking soda.</p>

<p>I like the previous logo better, This newer logo looks too plain and the 
dynamic ribbon looks like a line of cocaine. The ORIGINAL design they are 
trying to resemble the dynamic ribbon looked better. Are they ever going to 
remove the word &quot;classic&quot; there is no need for it anymore!</p>

<p>As a graphic design student, I am definitely not as experienced in the 
field as perhaps a few who have commented here, but what I can say is: when 
designing, make a DECISIVE choice for every element in a design, otherwise it 
looks like a mistake...Don't just &quot;almost&quot; line something up, either 
line it up or change it's position completely.</p> 
<p>On the one hand, it was decisive for Coke to go from all the 
afore-mentioned elements to the few that are there now. That was a good choice, 
in my opinion, considering the clutter driven design we see every day. On the 
OTHER hand, with the exception that the swoop looks a little different and that 
the classic is all small caps (which is very smart, and whether or not that 
should even be there, I'll let someone else have the 
opinion)&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;with those exceptions, the can does basically look 
like the old one. This just seems redundant, and they could've designed 
something decisively DIFFERENT if what they were going for is DIFFERENT. 
Someone compared this Coke change to Apple changing it's identity/packaging and 
going for simple, no clutter, but that can't be compared to this, because with 
the script type &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; and same old design in general, it really 
seems like it's meant to be nastalgic, not necessarily simple and modern, as 
it's been suggested. The Coke zero definitely is an improvement of design, and 
is decisively different-not many soda designs have black dominating, and it was 
a smart move, but there again, if they were going for nastalgia, then why not 
do that across the board with all the Coke product designs? Inconsistent and 
confusing.</p> 
<p>The Australian cans, while I agree that they look more like energy drinks, 
I believe they are going in the right direction where simplicity is concerned. 
(which, in a way, who cares if it looks like an energy drink cuz everybody 
knows its Coke and they could always go back to the old way if it lost money in 
sales from the lack of &quot;recognition&quot; on the shelf, which probably 
wouldn't happen) I would've been thrilled if the Australian version is the new 
can I saw in stores here, even if it does look have it's design flaws.</p> 
<p>All that said, as a consumer who probably drinks, shamefully, 3 or 4 Cokes 
a DAY, I was confused by the new Coke design. I kept thinking, as someone 
mentioned earlier, that they were old cans, until I realized I was seeing the 
cans with that design in more than one location. I am BORED TO TEARS of that 
design!</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a cultural difference at play here. I must be having a 
coke about every two weeks. And when I do, I don't &quot;just want a goddamn 
soda&quot;. I'm<strong>having</strong> a coke. Like when I drink a glass of 
whine. When drinking a good and refined whine, I like to see it being poured 
from a refined bottle. When I'm having a &quot;fresh break&quot;, I quite like 
the can to allow me to groan &quot;oh yeah&quot;.</p> 
<p>I guess to you Coke is like toilet paper. You consume it unawarely. In that 
case, I understand. I would so very much like toilet-paper-packagings not to be 
as &quot;communicative&quot;. If they head ears, I definitely would at least 
once have shouted back at them in the store, presumably not in a very mannered 
way.</p>

<p><i>Perhaps there is a cultural difference at play here.</i></p> 
<p>Guillaume, I think you have a good point here. American mass-market 
packaging tends to follow the &quot;more-is-more&quot; philosophy. It's almost 
a policy of overstating one's case. Granted, I saw my share of that in Europe 
as well, but there seems to be more willingness over there to give a product 
personality without overdoing it.</p> 
<p>Seen in that light, the restrained, back-to-basics approach of Coke is a 
welcome sight in this market, at least to me. I don't find it lacking 
communication. It radiates confidence in the Coke brand. The larger personality 
aspects of the brand are communicated through other marketing channels, of 
which packaging is just one. By recognizing that the majority of American 
consumers know this product so well, emphasizing refreshment and water 
condensation and fizziness via the can graphics is simply unnecessary.</p>

<p>As much as i love simplistic design, i do find it hard to get excited about 
a can of coke. Funny how companies spend years and years working on their 
packaging and branding and revert to more or less what they had to begin with. 
At the end of the day coca colas will sell by the bucketload regardless of what 
can it comes in. I do like the diet look as diet in the uk has always had some 
extra things on the can, as has zero. But yeah it's a nice clean look, i just 
cant get too excited about it</p>

<p>Interesting that the initial comments commend Coke for getting rid of the

the new, &quot;clean&quot; look?</p>

<p>I really like the clean lines and simplicity of the new/redesign, like so 
many others wrote before me. BUT... (forgive me if this was already mentioned, 
there were too many comments to read in depth) I also really like the type drop 
shadow on the &quot;before&quot; Coke can. It helps to elevate the type from 
the surface and therefore stand out, giving a flat surface some dimension. 
Drops done well do that.</p> 
<p>So, what could they do to the &quot;new&quot; Coke can to give it some 
umph? I dunno. How about blind-emboss the Coca-Cola type/logo mark??? That 
would be a whole new level of nifty!</p>

<p>They made a mistake with the new cans. They used the version of the logo

<p>I'm also from Australia, but I have the new US cans and love them.<br>
 
Also I don't see it worth getting knickers in a knot... why...because basically:
<br> 1. the can will change again in a few years<br>
 2. they have probably 
gone for the stripped back look so they can slowly re-introduce other design 
elements over the coming years! (kind of like the music industry trends... all 
the young ppl of each generation find what we grew up with and considered 
'normal' to be all retro and cool, so by going back to a clean design, it also 
becomes a new canvas for the next generation of designers and consumers to 
build upon...<br>
 3.It has also clearly streamlines the fact that it's the 
base flavour leaving the &quot;cherry and vanilla etc&quot; flavours to have 
something that differs from the original..<br>
 p.s love those pepsi cans 
above, it's a real shame they don't use them<br>
 Its kind of like wiping the 
slate clean but at the same time laying a new foundation for which it can be 
built upon, because no doubt it will be.</p>

<p>I like the new design. Only problem I had with it is that I was in no way 
PREPARED for it. Yesterday I just went to the supermarket to buy Coke (here in 
Germany) and voil&Atilde;&Acirc;&nbsp; &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; there's the new 
design. I actually passed the crates three or four times before recognizing it 
for what it was. And I fear that some if not most other people will have the 
same trouble at first. I just hope that this possible negative influence on 
sales will not be &quot;blamed&quot; to the new design, only to the lack of 
COMMUNICATING it.</p> 
<p>BTW: how are they introducing the new design in the US and other regions?

 I love the simplicity. I wish they had taken it further and dropped 
&quot;classic&quot; altogether. There is no New Coke anymore, just Coke or 
Coca-Cola. I'd love to see that reality reflected on their packaging. And, yes, 
I'm a Coke drinker.</p>

<p>I really like the new design; it's simple and, in my opinion, somewhat 
elegant. Yes, Coke will probably save money on printing costs, though I find it 
hard to believe they would go to this aesthetic solely for that purpose (but 
I'm just a naive student).<br>
 Also, the aluminum 20 ounce cans are stunning, 
if you've had a chance to check them out. I think this is a bold move in the 
right direction, as the over-saturation of unnecessary (and frivolous) graphic 
design typically feels like a cover up for a sub-par product. Nice to see that 
Coke had the confidence to proudly show it's brand maturity which has lasted so 
many years.<br>

<p>Turner Duckworth, the designers of the current Coke graphics, just won the 
first ever Design Lion at the Cannes advertising festival. Seems some others 
appreciate the simplicity approach too. Nice going, TD!</p>

<p>I absolutely love the new (original) design being brought back. I used to 
collect Coca-Cola memorabilia such as cans and bottles etc and I often wondered 
why they needed to change from what they used to have which was simple and 
beautiful to the monsters they unleashed on shelf. So happy someone had the 
balls to actually go 'NO' to anymore add ons and decided to actually take all 
of it away to reveal the beauty underneath. The same thing can often be said 
with girls with too much make-up ;)</p>

<p>Here in Mexico, this logo arrived in the beginning of this year... and it 
looks really great! I agree with dianette, Coca-Cola always had great designs...

<p>The Coca-Cola cans here in Vancouver have now dropped the 'classic'. (Which 
was getting pretty ludicrous, because where has anyone ever found 'New Coke' 
since Classic was reintroduced?)</p>

<p>To introduce a non-visual talking point, when seeing a large red Coke can 
and reading JonSel's 
&quot;....bzzz....snap....crackle...awheeeeeeyoooooo...distortion....static....fade 
out....&quot; I first thought he was writing out the auditory experience of 
opening a can of Coke. Then I realized it was static. The sound of opening a 
can of Coke is one more very powerful element of the Coke experience.</p>

<p>here's how you know coke's new, simpler designs are a success: pepsi 
followed suit less than a year later. although, ironically, most reviews i've 
read of the new pepsi design (or, more particularly, the new &quot;globe smilie 
logo&quot;) have been negative.<br>

<p>Compare this to the comments on the new Pepsi. Interesting what happens 
when you simplify. Here it's good; Pepsi is the New Coke of designs. Failure.

<p>Well I'm disappointed in you all. I was hoping that it would reveal itself 
in this long list of comments, but it did not.</p> 
<p>The yellow ribbon was a selling of advertising space on behalf of Coke to 
McDonald's which happened back in 2002/2003. The ribbon of yellow appeared, and 
then weeks later you would have started to see coupons for McDonald's appearing 
on select Coke packaging. Look at the color of the golden arches and other 
McDonald's products. Same yellow as was on the now dated Coke design. Note that 
the Coke can design prior to the yellow ribbon was pretty much the exact same 
design.</p> 
<p>I was Lovin' that pysch project between these two giants and I felt proud 
to discover the association!</p> 
<p>My suspicion is that it was actually McDonald's idea. But I haven't 
bothered to research in to either of the companies advertising interests (other 
than the obvious fact the Coke products are supplied by McDonald's). It could 
have been McDonald's idea, Coke's or an outsourced agency I suppose.</p> 
<p>I'm also seeking employment :)</p>
