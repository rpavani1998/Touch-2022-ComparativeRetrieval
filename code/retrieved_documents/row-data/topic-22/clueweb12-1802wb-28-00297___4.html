 I've been reading &quot;Blink: The Power of 
Thinking Without Thinking&quot; by Malcolm Gladwell. What a fascinating book! 
It's not a design book and contrary to the way the title sounds, it's not a 
&quot;how-to&quot; book. What it does is help us to understand how/why humans 
make snap judgements in the blink of an eye. When you think about it, this 
concept has a lot to do with how we do what we do as designers. It particularly 
speaks to how clients react to our work as well as to us, personally.<strong>
Clients at a Blink</strong> At some point during every project, while selling 
our work to clients or while our clients' clients are interacting with our 
finished product, Blink comes into play. Clients make a snap judgement to the 
initial design comps we show them based on their own, subconscious 
feelings/emotions/biases. An award-winning design which we created for one 
client, a design the client may have<em>loved</em>, could be soundly rejected as
<em>crap</em> by another client. Same work. Polar opposite reactions. Is it 
really the work the client is reacting to? Maybe not. Maybe they love the work 
we show them because they love<em>us</em>? More specifically, the love the 
process we have just subjected them to. Conversely, maybe they hate the work 
because they hate us or the process leading up to the presentation of work.
<p></p> Imagine sitting in a five star restaurant where they lost your 
reservation, made you wait 30 minutes, the waiter talked down to you and wasn't 
very attentive. What are the chances that despite the horrible process you've 
been subjected to, you'll find that your meal was an absolute delight? Not 
great. On the other hand, you could receive a lesser meal served to you by a 
friendly staff who remember you and greet you warmly every time you come and 
think it's the best meal you ever had.<strong>The &quot;New Coke&quot; of design
</strong> One of the examples Gladwell uses in his book is that of New Coke. By 
now New Coke is infamous as one of the biggest branding and marketing failures 
of the 20th century. Those of us old enough to remember, know that New Coke had 
it's origins in the rise of Pepsi as a solid #2 competitor to perennial soft 
drink king, Coke. During the 70s, Pepsi started a &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot; 
during which it depicted in TV commercials featuring blind taste tests in which 
consumers would sip both Pepsi and Coke and declare which one tasted better. In 
Pepsi's ads (as well as private blind tests conducted by Coke) a majority of 
consumers tested chose Pepsi. This set off a panic which led Coke to tamper 
with it's #1 selling formula and come up with a new one. New Coke was born. By 
all scientific reasoning, New Coke should have been a hands down success. 
Unlike regular Coke, New Coke handily beat competitor Pepsi in blind taste 
tests by a wide margin. Yet New Coke ended up being an instant and unmistakable 
failure! Why? Gladwell explains that New Coke was built to win taste tests. To 
appeal to consumers who only<em>sipped</em> the cola in small amounts. Of 
course, consumers don't sip cola out of small cups, they drink it by the glass, 
can, bottle or cup. While New Coke did very well against Pepsi during taste 
tests, it failed to make a positive impression in the arena where most 
consumers interact with their cola and in the amounts that they drink their 
cola. This has implications in design because we do the same thing! We craft 
designs and initial comps that are built to push clients into a specific design 
direction and hopefully pick one design over a variety of others we provide for 
them. But they are not interacting with our design the way they would normally, 
just as consumers in the &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot; were not interacting with 
Coke and Pepsi the way they would normally. With a set of web comps, clients 
are not allowed to scroll the page or click on the menu items. For brochure 
comps, clients are not allowed to hold it in their hands and feel/smell the 
paper. So they must make snap judgements based on artificial criteria and in 
atypical settings that can send us into the wrong direction and lead to faulty 
solutions.<strong>New Coke of design</strong>. Now of course, I understand why 
it's not possible to create fully navigatable websites at the comp level or 
brochure comps that can be printed, held and touched. But understanding how 
snap judgements are made can help us to understand the gulf between designer 
and design client and perhaps lead us to better ideas in our process that help 
us to get feedback that is truly helpful in creating better, more effective 
design solutions. .chris{}
