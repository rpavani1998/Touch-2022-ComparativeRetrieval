<h3>CHARMAINE YOEST SAYS COKE SHOULD ATTACK PEPSI</h3> 
<p>UPDATE 8/13/06: NOOYI PROMOTED AND APPOINTED CEO OF PEPSI</p> 
<p>Charmain Yoest, wickedly smart, and refreshingly American says Coke should 
attack Pepsi over the Indra Nooyi controversy. She's right that Pepsi is 
vulnerable to attack. But I doubt Coke will exploit it. Who will exploit it? 
I'm waiting for a small, upstart all-American soft drink brand to take this on. 
The positioning opportunities are perfect. Rarely do the planets align for this 
kind of attack.</p>

<li><br>
John Boyd articulates the secret to successful campaigning. Boyd's 
O-O-D-A Loop and thoughts on organic command and control should be mastered by 
all marketers. Boyd's phrase is best - &quot;unraveling the competition.&quot;

practices, in sports, or in personal relationships.Click here to read more on

<h2>Critical Look At Blue Ocean Strategy</h2>

Blue Ocean Strategy - How to Create Uncontested Market Space And Make 
The Competition Irrelevent is one of the most successfull business books in 
recent times.Click here to read several different Blue Ocean critiques..</li>

<h2>Recommended Reading</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>  Most marketers used to the bright colors, short lists and pretty 
pictures of Seth Godin, Tom Peters and Guy Kawasaki will find this list 
daunting to say the least. Which is why the list forms a golden opportunity for 
those marketers with the hearty appetite necessary to devour the contents. 
While most of your competitors are trying to paint cows purple - you'll be out 
kicking ass.<br>

<p>MARKETING: STRATEGY</p> 
<p>Sun Tzu- The Art of War <em>Shambhala/Thomas Cleary version</em>.</p> 
<p> WHY MARKETERS SHOULD READ: Because Sun Tuz is the ultimate marketing 
strategist. Learn how to win without fighting. And when you do have to fight - 
how to kick ass and win.</p> 
<p> MONEY QUOTE: <em>Therefore use these assessments for comparison, to find 
out what the conditions are. That is to say which political leadership has the 
Way? Which general has the ability? Who has the better climate and terrain? 
Whose discipline is effective? Whose troops are stronger? whose officers and 
soldiers are the better trained? Whose system of rewards and punishments 
clearer? This is how can know who will win. (Pg. 46)</em></p> 
<p>MARKETING: TACTICS</p> 
<p>Machiavelli - The Prince <em>Mentor Book's version with forward by 
Christian Gauss.<br>
</em><br>
 WHY MARKETERS SHOULD READ: Because Machiavelli 
delivers a great primer on dealing with unethical tactics - like blog swarms, 
short sellers, social activists, corrupt competitors, media relations, etc.</p> 
<p> MONEY QUOTE: <em>A new prince has never been known to disarm his subjects, 
on the contrary, when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, for 
by arming them, these arms become your own, those that you suspected become 
faithful, and those that were faithful remain so, and from being merely 
subjects become your partisans. (Pg. 105)</em></p> 
<p>MARKETING: CAMPAIGNING</p> 
<p>The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War <em>Robert Coram's biography 
of John Boyd.<br>
</em><br>
 WHY MARKETERS SHOULD READ: Because Boyd 
articulates the secret to successful campaigning. Boyd's O-O-D-A Loop and 
thoughts on organic command and control should be mastered by all marketers.</p>
<p> MONEY QUOTE: <em>For a time, Boyd and Spinney were reluctant to fully 
explain the O-O-D-A Loop; it was far too dangerous. If someone truly 
understands how to create menace and uncertainty and mistrust, then how to 
exploit and magnify the presence of these disconcerting elements, the Loop can 
be vicious, a terribly destructive force, virtually unstoppable in causing 
panic and confusion and - Boyd's phrase is best - &quot;unraveling the 
competition.&quot; This is true whether the Loop is applied in combat, in 
competitive business practices, in sports, or in personal relationships. (Pg. 
334)</em><br>
<br>
 MARKETING: CRISIS</p> 
<p>The Second World War, Volume 2: Their Finest Hour <em>Winston Churchill's 
WWII chronicles.<br>
</em><br>
 WHY MARKETERS SHOULD READ: Because everything 
you read today about crisis management is wrong. Churchill's personal 
experiences leading up to and during WWII provide a practical foundation for 
dealing with crisis.</p> 
<p> MONEY QUOTE: <em>There never was an occasion when powers were abrogated or 
challenged, and anyone in this circle could always speak his mind; but the 
actual war direction soon settled into a very few hands, and what seemed so 
difficult before became much more simple - apart of course, from Hitler. In 
spite of the turbulence of events and the many disasters we had to endure, the 
machinery worked almost automatically, and one lived in a stream of coherent 
thought capable of being translated with great rapidity into executive action. 
(Pg. 17)<br>
</em><br>
 MARKETING FUNDAMENTALS</p> 
<p>Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors 
<em>Michael Porter's classic</em>.</p> 
<p> WHY MARKETERS SHOULD READ: Porter provides a fundamental primer on 
competition including practical tools and techniques that are even more 
important today than they were 25 years ago.</p> 
<p> MONEY QUOTES: <em>One broad approach is to use superior resources and 
capabilities to force an outcome skewed toward the interest of the firm, 
overcoming and outlasting retaliation - we might call this brute force 
approach. This sort of approach is possible only if the firm possesses clear 
superiorities, and it is stable only as long as the firm maintains these 
superiorities, and as long as competitors do not misread them and incorrectly 
attempt to change their positions. (Pg. 91)<br>

<strong><br>
20 CAMPAIGN SIGNALS - ARE YOU SIGNALING OR IS YOUR COMPETITION?<br>
<br>

</strong>The Campaign SIGNALS wizard describes 20 signals a competitor may 
demonstrate indicating potential vulnerabilities. An example of a potential 
campaign signal is a competitor launching an expensive high profile strategic 
branding campaign which then makes them vulnerable to low profile direct 
marketing campaigns. Why? Traditional branding theory advocates the need for a 
consistent message broadcast over time. So while your competitor is waiting for 
the branding to &quot;work&quot; you're already at work taking market share.

<strong>SEVEN FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF KILLER 
COMPETITIVE STRATEGY<br>
<br>
</strong>The Campaign STRATEGY wizard describes 
seven fundamental building blocks of strategy with specific examples. These 
seven building blocks are price, quality, service, features, infrastructure, 
relationships and execution. Strategy is the enabler between ends and means. 
The ends represent the objective. The means includes enterprise resources, 
competencies, etc. In order for strategy to perform this enabling function it 
needs to be effective, comprehensible and executable. An example of strategy 
would be for the challenger to attack a leaders premium price, with their own 
premium pricing (NOT discount pricing!) in tandem with superior quality, 
features or reputation.Click to download.<br>
<br>
<strong>54 TACTICS TO SELECT 
FROM IN BUILDING YOUR OWN PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.<br>
<br>
</strong>The Campaign 
TACTICS wizard is designed to provide a catalyst to drive strategy and tactics.

describes 54 different strategies and tactics. Each strategy has a one line 
description, an explanation of the strategy, the basis for the strategy and a 
potential tactical application.Click to download.<br>

<strong>
DETERMINING ASYMMETRICAL ADVANTAGES - WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE COMPETITION CHEATS.
<br><br>
</strong>Campaign SYMMETRIES indicate the &quot;fairness&quot; of your 
campaign. Some competitors are willing to go further than others in order to 
win a battle. A battle between two competitors with essentially comparable 
offering, infrastructure, relationships and execution, and, committed to 
playing by an established set of rules, can be considered a symmetrical 
conflict. When a competitor resorts to breaking or bending the rules, and you 
are unwilling to match their tactics, then you have the makings of an 
asymmetrical conflict, a battle you will likely lose. The Campaign SYMMETRIES 
wizard provide a gauge by which to measure the symmetry of your battle for 
market share.Click to download.</p> </li> </ul> 
<h2>Case Study: $10 Million to $50 Million...</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><br>
<br>
This is a case study for a campaign that increased sales from $10 
million a month to $50 million a month in 60 days. This campaign was executed 
back in 1997-98 but it still serves today as an interesting example of the 
impact maneuver theory can have on marketing campaigning. It's really quite 
interesting in that back in 1997 we were urging&nbsp; the client, Syquest, to 
adopt a business model that would later be embraced by Steve Jobs and Apple - 
the iPod/iTunes&nbsp; model.Click here to download the case study.</p> </li>
