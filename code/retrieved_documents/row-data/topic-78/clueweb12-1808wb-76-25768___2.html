<h2>zsort: portable sorting algorithms in Common&nbsp;Lisp</h2> 
<p>with 6 comments</p> 
<p>zsort is a library that I started working on as a simple hobby project. 
More or less around the same time I decided to checkwhich algorithms the 
different Common Lisp implementations use. It is now part of Quicklisp so it 
can be easily used (thanksZack!). </p> 
<p>The main goal of zsort is to be a collection of portable sorting 
algorithms. If they can be fast, even better. Common lisp provides thesort and 
stable-sort functions but these can have different algorithms implemented 
according to each implementation, which can make an application unportable if 
you rely on a specific type of sorting. Also, the standard functions might not 
be the best for a certain situation and as such you might need a specialized 
sort. Even if for most situations the standard functions are more than enough, 
thezsort library could be a useful complement.</p> 
<p>Right now the implemented algorithms are: insertion sort, quicksort, 
randomized quicksort, merge sort, heapsort and counting sort. The plan is to 
add more algorithms, for example,bucket sort and timsort. However, the main 
thing on the todo list is adding the possibility ofexternal sorting (to handle 
large amounts of data) and parallel versions of some sorting algorithms. I am 
considering usinglparallel for this but I am still undecided.</p> 
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, but I think the library as it is 
can already be a little useful. And of course, all kind of suggestions and 
improvements are welcome!</p>

<h2>Best Paper Award at EuroGP&nbsp;2012</h2> 
<p>with 4 comments</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Last week I was at EuroGP where I presented my latest paper &ldquo;
Automatic Design of Ant Algorithms with Grammatical Evolution&rdquo; (pdf, 
slides) and it won the <strong>Best Paper Award</strong>! I am very happy with 
this distinction since EuroGP is the leading conference on Genetic Programming 
attended by the best researchers in the field.</p> 
<p>In this paper, a Grammatical Evolution approach is used for the automatic 
design ofAnt Colony Optimization algorithms. The used grammar has the ability 
to guide the learning of novel architectures, by rearranging components 
regularly found on manually designed variants (for example, the Elitist 
Ant-System, the Ant Colony System or the Max-Min Ant System). This approach was 
tested with theTSP and the results show that the evolved algorithmic strategies 
are effective, exhibit a good generalization capability and are competitive 
with human designed variants. This is still a starting point and there is a 
large amount of work to be done but the indications given by these results are 
encouraging!</p> 
<p>This year the conference took place in M&aacute;laga, Spain, as part of Evo*
 as usual. The event was great with an excellent organization lead byCarlos 
Cotta. It was a fantastic Evo*! Next year it will be held in Wien!</p>

<h2>Book review: The Tangled&nbsp;Web</h2> 
<p>leave a comment &raquo;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For the past couple of months I&rsquo;ve been reading The Tangled Web: A 
Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications by Michael Zalewski. The book was 
published byno starch press and they were kind enough to provide me a copy for 
review. I enjoy reading about topics outside my main field and interests. 
It&rsquo;s a way to keep myself informed and learn new things and this book 
fits exactly into this category.</p> 
<p>The Tangled Web is mostly about web technologies and how insecure they are 
by nature. The book is a very engaging narrative, full of details and 
impressive war stories. It focuses on the practical issues of web technologies 
and not on the theory of security. The book can be very useful for web 
developers and those interested in security. For example, at the end of each 
chapter we can find a &ldquo;Security Engineering Cheat Sheet&rdquo;, which 
presents us a summary of things to consider/do. These sheets alone make the 
book worthwhile having. The book is organized in three main parts. In the first 
one, the author tells us the story of the inception of the web until today and 
discusses all the important technologies, protocols, etc. The second part 
focuses on the browser security and the third part on &ldquo;the things to 
come&rdquo;. Although the book is not very thick (around 300 pages) it 
addresses too many important issues to completely absorb them in a single 
reading.</p> 
<p>To conclude, the Tangled Web is a solid book, full of interesting and 
useful information. For web developers and security experts it should be a must 
read book. For the rest of us it is an enjoyable reading.</p>

<h2>Macros Design&nbsp;Patterns</h2> 
<p>with 4 comments</p> 
<p>I was reading the thread What are some fun or useful macros? on reddit and 
it reminded me ofanother thread that appeared in the Pro mailing list. These 
kind of threads are always enjoyable because each time you learn something new 
and see really interesting things. While reading them, it crossed my mind that 
another variant of this question would be<em>what are some fun or useful macros 
design patterns</em>. Instead of examples of specific code macros (general or 
not) it would be nice to see common programming practices using macros. So, for 
a lack of a better expression name, let&rsquo;s call them<em>macros design 
patterns</em>. </p> 
<p>My favorite one is to configure an algorithm, especially when we want to 
use the correct types. Essentially, we write an algorithm using a macro that 
takes types or configuration arguments and then we expand it to the appropriate 
desired configurations. For example, if you have an algorithm that operates on 
different types of sequences, instead of writing several duplicate functions 
with the same algorithm but with the associated type declarations, just apply 
this pattern. A simple but contrived example: we want to compute the mean of a 
vector but use its proper type. In addition, we might also want the possibility 
of using a key to access the vector elements. We can write the following macro:
</p> 
<pre><code>(defmacro mean-body (vector vector-type vector-ref key) (let ((size 
(gensym)) (i (gensym))) `(locally (declare (type ,vector-type ,vector)) (let 
((,size (length ,vector))) (/ (loop for ,i from 0 below ,size sum ,(if key 
`(funcall ,key (,vector-ref ,vector ,i)) `(,vector-ref ,vector ,i))) ,size)))))
</code></pre> <code> </code> 
<p><code></code></p> 
<p>The macro contains the algorithm (in this simple case the mean) and the 
arguments allow us to configure the multiple versions we need. If we want a 
simple-vector, the macro will expand to use the correct type declaration and 
svref. If a key function is needed it will also include it. Then, we can call 
the macro with the several configurations value inside the main function:</p> 
<pre><code>(defun mean (vector &amp;optional key) (typecase vector 
(simple-vector (if key (mean-body vector simple-vector svref key) (mean-body 
vector simple-vector svref nil))) (vector (if key (mean-body vector vector aref 
key) (mean-body vector vector aref nil))) (otherwise (if key (mean-body vector 
sequence elt key) (mean-body vector sequence elt nil)))))</code></pre> <code> 
</code> 
<p><code></code></p> 
<p>This can be very useful in situations where we want to optimize code since 
it becomes easy to add the proper type declarations to the input arguments of 
an algorithm. Moreover, we keep the algorithm in a single place, making it 
easier to maintain. Depending on the situation, we can also define a function 
for each configuration. In the example we could have a mean-simple-vector and 
mean-vector.</p> 
<p>I don't know if it has already a specific name but I like to call it <em>
the configurable algorithm pattern</em>. I find it very useful. And thinking 
back to the redditthread, what are your favorite macros design patterns? Which 
ones do you find useful and use them regularly? If you want to share, feel free 
to drop a line. I am interested in seing and learning other patterns!</p>

<h2>Sorting algorithms used in the CL&nbsp;implementations</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p>Which sorting algorithm should one implement when developing a program? The 
best answer is probably<em>none</em>. Use the sort provided by your 
system/library/etc. Unless you know your input data has some special properties 
that you can take advantage of, the provided sort should be enough for your 
needs and probably is more efficiently implemented.</p> 
<p>However, I think it is important to know what sorting algorithm is 
implemented. If one knows the properties of the data, it is possible to 
understand if the provided sort can or will pose a problem. In the same way a 
programmer shouldn&rsquo;t implement a sorting algorithm every time it needs to 
sort something, the programmer should also be aware of the 
limitations/advantages of the system sort. That way one can decide if a special 
sort is needed or not.</p> 
<p>Common Lisp provides the functions sort and stable-sort. The HyperSpec 
describes their operation well but it does not define the sorting algorithm. 
That decision is left free to the implementations. In addition, both functions 
don&rsquo;t necessarily share the same algorithm. The difference between the 
two is that the second function sorts in a way that guaranteesstability, i.e., 
two elements that are equal remain in the same position after sorting is 
completed. The use of sort and stable-sort requires some care (see the section
sort pitfalls) but lets focus on the algorithms and not on its usage.</p> 
<p>What sorting algorithms do the major open source CL implementations 
actually implement? I was curious about it and went to check the source forABCL,
CCL, CLISP, CMUCL, ECL and SBCL. Not surprising, we find some differences 
between the implementations. What it was more unexpected to discover is that 
some implementations also use different sorting algorithms according to the 
sequence type. A quick survey of the findings is summarized in the following 
table (if anythings is incorrect, please tell me). The links for the source 
code are in the implementation name (careful, in CCL and SBCL there are two 
links).</p> Implementation sort stable-sort <br>
ABCL merge sort (lists) / 
quicksort merge sort <br>
CCL merge sort (lists) / quicksort merge sort <br>

CLISP tree sort tree sort <br>
CMUCL heapsort merge sort <br>
ECL merge sort 
(lists) / quicksort quicksort (strings + bit vectors) / merge sort <br>
SBCL 
merge sort (lists) / heapsort merge sort <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
 In terms of the implementation of sort, quicksort is the most 
used algorithm, followed byheapsort. The choice for these algorithms is 
expected. Both have an average-case performance of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>) 
and heapsort guarantees a worst-case performace of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>) 
too. Quicksort has a worst-case performance of O(<em>n2</em>) but it can be 
optimized in several ways so that it also gives an expected worst-case 
performance of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>). However, it seems that the quicksort 
implementations are not completely optimized. In ECL (and ABCL) quicksort 
implements a partition scheme which deals better with duplicate elements 
(although is not the three-way partitioning) but it always picks as pivot the 
first element. CCL chooses the pivot with a median-of-3 method and always sorts 
the smaller partition to ensure a worst-case stack depth of O(lg<em>n</em>). 
</p> 
<p>As for CLISP, I think it uses a tree sort but I am not entirely sure. The 
only source file I could find with a sort implementation wassort.d and it looks 
like it contains an implementation of tree sort with a self-balanced binary 
tree, which also gives this algorithm an average and worst-case performance of 
O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>). </p> 
<p>As expected, most of the implementations use merge sort to implement 
stable-sort since it is a stable sort with average and worst-case performance 
of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>). Apparently, all implementations are bottom-up 
merge sorts with the exception of CCL and ECL. Another interesting thing is 
that merge sort is also used for lists in sort, in most of the implementations. 
However, I found it surprising to find quicksort in the stable-sort column 
because it is not a stable algorithm. Since it is only used for strings and bit 
vectors, it is not really an issue. While reading the source code of the 
implementations, I realized that ABCL was using quicksort in stable-sort for 
all non-list sequences. This is a problem that exists in the current1.0.1 
release but I&rsquo;ve sent a bug report with a quick fix to the maintainers. 
The next release should have stable-sort fixed.</p> 
<p>This exploration of the sorting algorithms used in the open source 
implementations was very educational and interesting to me. I&rsquo;ve learned 
what algorithms are actually used and enjoyed seing how they were implemented. 
Just spotting the issue in ABCL stable-sort made this review worthwhile. I 
think there is still room for improvement in some implementations but knowing 
now the strengths and weaknesses of the sorts in CL is already good enough. On 
a final note, I just wonder what are the algorithms used inACL and LW. </p>
