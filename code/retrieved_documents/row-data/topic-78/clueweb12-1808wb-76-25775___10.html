<h2>zsort: portable sorting algorithms in Common&nbsp;Lisp</h2> 
<p>with 6 comments</p> 
<p>zsort is a library that I started working on as a simple hobby project. 
More or less around the same time I decided to checkwhich algorithms the 
different Common Lisp implementations use. It is now part of Quicklisp so it 
can be easily used (thanksZack!). </p> 
<p>The main goal of zsort is to be a collection of portable sorting 
algorithms. If they can be fast, even better. Common lisp provides thesort and 
stable-sort functions but these can have different algorithms implemented 
according to each implementation, which can make an application unportable if 
you rely on a specific type of sorting. Also, the standard functions might not 
be the best for a certain situation and as such you might need a specialized 
sort. Even if for most situations the standard functions are more than enough, 
thezsort library could be a useful complement.</p> 
<p>Right now the implemented algorithms are: insertion sort, quicksort, 
randomized quicksort, merge sort, heapsort and counting sort. The plan is to 
add more algorithms, for example,bucket sort and timsort. However, the main 
thing on the todo list is adding the possibility ofexternal sorting (to handle 
large amounts of data) and parallel versions of some sorting algorithms. I am 
considering usinglparallel for this but I am still undecided.</p> 
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, but I think the library as it is 
can already be a little useful. And of course, all kind of suggestions and 
improvements are welcome!</p>

<h2>Macros Design&nbsp;Patterns</h2> 
<p>with 4 comments</p> 
<p>I was reading the thread What are some fun or useful macros? on reddit and 
it reminded me ofanother thread that appeared in the Pro mailing list. These 
kind of threads are always enjoyable because each time you learn something new 
and see really interesting things. While reading them, it crossed my mind that 
another variant of this question would be<em>what are some fun or useful macros 
design patterns</em>. Instead of examples of specific code macros (general or 
not) it would be nice to see common programming practices using macros. So, for 
a lack of a better expression name, let&rsquo;s call them<em>macros design 
patterns</em>. </p> 
<p>My favorite one is to configure an algorithm, especially when we want to 
use the correct types. Essentially, we write an algorithm using a macro that 
takes types or configuration arguments and then we expand it to the appropriate 
desired configurations. For example, if you have an algorithm that operates on 
different types of sequences, instead of writing several duplicate functions 
with the same algorithm but with the associated type declarations, just apply 
this pattern. A simple but contrived example: we want to compute the mean of a 
vector but use its proper type. In addition, we might also want the possibility 
of using a key to access the vector elements. We can write the following macro:
</p> 
<pre><code>(defmacro mean-body (vector vector-type vector-ref key) (let ((size 
(gensym)) (i (gensym))) `(locally (declare (type ,vector-type ,vector)) (let 
((,size (length ,vector))) (/ (loop for ,i from 0 below ,size sum ,(if key 
`(funcall ,key (,vector-ref ,vector ,i)) `(,vector-ref ,vector ,i))) ,size)))))
</code></pre> <code> </code> 
<p><code></code></p> 
<p>The macro contains the algorithm (in this simple case the mean) and the 
arguments allow us to configure the multiple versions we need. If we want a 
simple-vector, the macro will expand to use the correct type declaration and 
svref. If a key function is needed it will also include it. Then, we can call 
the macro with the several configurations value inside the main function:</p> 
<pre><code>(defun mean (vector &amp;optional key) (typecase vector 
(simple-vector (if key (mean-body vector simple-vector svref key) (mean-body 
vector simple-vector svref nil))) (vector (if key (mean-body vector vector aref 
key) (mean-body vector vector aref nil))) (otherwise (if key (mean-body vector 
sequence elt key) (mean-body vector sequence elt nil)))))</code></pre> <code> 
</code> 
<p><code></code></p> 
<p>This can be very useful in situations where we want to optimize code since 
it becomes easy to add the proper type declarations to the input arguments of 
an algorithm. Moreover, we keep the algorithm in a single place, making it 
easier to maintain. Depending on the situation, we can also define a function 
for each configuration. In the example we could have a mean-simple-vector and 
mean-vector.</p> 
<p>I don't know if it has already a specific name but I like to call it <em>
the configurable algorithm pattern</em>. I find it very useful. And thinking 
back to the redditthread, what are your favorite macros design patterns? Which 
ones do you find useful and use them regularly? If you want to share, feel free 
to drop a line. I am interested in seing and learning other patterns!</p>

<h2>Sorting algorithms used in the CL&nbsp;implementations</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p>Which sorting algorithm should one implement when developing a program? The 
best answer is probably<em>none</em>. Use the sort provided by your 
system/library/etc. Unless you know your input data has some special properties 
that you can take advantage of, the provided sort should be enough for your 
needs and probably is more efficiently implemented.</p> 
<p>However, I think it is important to know what sorting algorithm is 
implemented. If one knows the properties of the data, it is possible to 
understand if the provided sort can or will pose a problem. In the same way a 
programmer shouldn&rsquo;t implement a sorting algorithm every time it needs to 
sort something, the programmer should also be aware of the 
limitations/advantages of the system sort. That way one can decide if a special 
sort is needed or not.</p> 
<p>Common Lisp provides the functions sort and stable-sort. The HyperSpec 
describes their operation well but it does not define the sorting algorithm. 
That decision is left free to the implementations. In addition, both functions 
don&rsquo;t necessarily share the same algorithm. The difference between the 
two is that the second function sorts in a way that guaranteesstability, i.e., 
two elements that are equal remain in the same position after sorting is 
completed. The use of sort and stable-sort requires some care (see the section
sort pitfalls) but lets focus on the algorithms and not on its usage.</p> 
<p>What sorting algorithms do the major open source CL implementations 
actually implement? I was curious about it and went to check the source forABCL,
CCL, CLISP, CMUCL, ECL and SBCL. Not surprising, we find some differences 
between the implementations. What it was more unexpected to discover is that 
some implementations also use different sorting algorithms according to the 
sequence type. A quick survey of the findings is summarized in the following 
table (if anythings is incorrect, please tell me). The links for the source 
code are in the implementation name (careful, in CCL and SBCL there are two 
links).</p> Implementation sort stable-sort <br>
ABCL merge sort (lists) / 
quicksort merge sort <br>
CCL merge sort (lists) / quicksort merge sort <br>

CLISP tree sort tree sort <br>
CMUCL heapsort merge sort <br>
ECL merge sort 
(lists) / quicksort quicksort (strings + bit vectors) / merge sort <br>
SBCL 
merge sort (lists) / heapsort merge sort <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;<br>
 In terms of the implementation of sort, quicksort is the most 
used algorithm, followed byheapsort. The choice for these algorithms is 
expected. Both have an average-case performance of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>) 
and heapsort guarantees a worst-case performace of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>) 
too. Quicksort has a worst-case performance of O(<em>n2</em>) but it can be 
optimized in several ways so that it also gives an expected worst-case 
performance of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>). However, it seems that the quicksort 
implementations are not completely optimized. In ECL (and ABCL) quicksort 
implements a partition scheme which deals better with duplicate elements 
(although is not the three-way partitioning) but it always picks as pivot the 
first element. CCL chooses the pivot with a median-of-3 method and always sorts 
the smaller partition to ensure a worst-case stack depth of O(lg<em>n</em>). 
</p> 
<p>As for CLISP, I think it uses a tree sort but I am not entirely sure. The 
only source file I could find with a sort implementation wassort.d and it looks 
like it contains an implementation of tree sort with a self-balanced binary 
tree, which also gives this algorithm an average and worst-case performance of 
O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>). </p> 
<p>As expected, most of the implementations use merge sort to implement 
stable-sort since it is a stable sort with average and worst-case performance 
of O(<em>n</em>lg<em>n</em>). Apparently, all implementations are bottom-up 
merge sorts with the exception of CCL and ECL. Another interesting thing is 
that merge sort is also used for lists in sort, in most of the implementations. 
However, I found it surprising to find quicksort in the stable-sort column 
because it is not a stable algorithm. Since it is only used for strings and bit 
vectors, it is not really an issue. While reading the source code of the 
implementations, I realized that ABCL was using quicksort in stable-sort for 
all non-list sequences. This is a problem that exists in the current1.0.1 
release but I&rsquo;ve sent a bug report with a quick fix to the maintainers. 
The next release should have stable-sort fixed.</p> 
<p>This exploration of the sorting algorithms used in the open source 
implementations was very educational and interesting to me. I&rsquo;ve learned 
what algorithms are actually used and enjoyed seing how they were implemented. 
Just spotting the issue in ABCL stable-sort made this review worthwhile. I 
think there is still room for improvement in some implementations but knowing 
now the strengths and weaknesses of the sorts in CL is already good enough. On 
a final note, I just wonder what are the algorithms used inACL and LW. </p>

<h2>ECLM 2011&nbsp;Notes</h2> 
<p>with 2 comments</p> 
<p>This last weekend I was in Amsterdam to attend the European Common Lisp 
Meeting. This was my third participation in a organized Lisp meeting (after the 
first ZSLUG in Zurich and the ELS 2011 in Hamburg) and I am happy I&rsquo;ve 
decided to go. I was only present at the meeting itself since going to the 
dinners and city tour would have been way out of my budget. Anyway, the ECLM 
was a nice venue. I enjoyed most of the talks and still had an opportunity to 
talk with fellow lispers. I enjoyed talking withLu&iacute;s Oliveira and meeting
Zach Beane.</p> 
<p>The first talk was given by Nick Levine and it can be viewed in two parts. 
In the first one, he talked about his experiences of trying to write aCL book 
forO&rsquo;Reilly. It was quite interesting to see how hard can it be to 
prepare a book, especially for a publisher who was (is?)not very lisp-friendly. 
The second part was mostly about the community, although presented with a rant 
on libraries. This is a topic that has been debated several times. Thanks to
Quicklisp, the problem now is not installing libraries but <em>finding them and 
knowing which ones are good</em>. I am not sure if creating another site as 
suggested would be a good thing since resources are already scarce. Perhaps 
more thought must be made in how to improve the current ones.CLiki still seems 
to me the best starting point. Still, Nick Levine talk was good and 
entertaining. One of the best in the meeting.</p> 
<p>The following talks were mostly about companies that use CL as their main 
programming language.Jack Harper talked about the company he recently started, 
Secure Outcomes, that produces a unique portable fingerprint scanner. I must 
say his talk was quite inspiring! He talked about how to get a startup running 
and the decisions that took him to choose Lisp as the main development 
language. In addition, he also explained why prefers Lispworks to any other 
implementation.</p> 
<p>Next, it was the talk given by Dave Cooper. I must confess his talk was the 
weaker of the day mainly because he talked about two different subjects without 
any connection. He started talking aboutGDL, the main product from his company, 
Genworks. I&rsquo;m sure GDL can be a great thing but I didn&rsquo;t get much 
from his talk. About halftime, the talk suddenly changed to theCommon Lisp 
Foundation. This was the interesting part of the talk since he explained the 
aims of CLF, the people behind it, etc. However, it was not clear how it will 
distinguish itself from ALU in terms of operation (in terms of purpose, CLF 
just focus on Common Lisp while ALU in all Lisp dialects) and this was the main 
concern that was expressed during the questions time. After presenting CLF, and 
since there was still some time left for the next presenter, he went back to 
GDL.</p> 
<p>Afterwards, it was the turn of Luke Gorrie to present his lisp-hacker 
startupTeclo Networks. His talk was an expanded/updated version of the one 
given in Zurich. Still, it was also quite interesting. He started by telling 
how a group of hackers with a Lisp and/orErlang background got together to 
improve the mobile TCP/IP communications. Then, he showed us how TCP badly 
misbehaves in a mobile network and how their product,Sambal, can give 10% to 
27% improvements. Another interesting point of the talk was that CL is used as 
their main development language. In short, it is used to develop and study all 
their algorithms. They have a TCP/IP stack fully implemented in CL! Moreover, 
all their analysis and maintenance tools are also all in CL. However, in the 
actual product boxes they have reimplemented the algorithms in C. The reason: 
extreme pragmatism. Luke concluded by hinting that the sales of their product 
is going very well!</p> 
<p>In the afternoon the talks started with Paul Miller from Xanalys. The talk 
was dedicated toLink Explorer, a windows desktop tool to analyze data. The 
application is quite impressive and was developed using just CL. Paul also gave 
us a demonstration of the tool as well as some notes on future development.</p> 
<p>The best and most awaited talk, <em>Quicklisp, technically and socially</em>
, was given byZach Beane. The talk focused on several aspects of Quicklisp. 
Zach started by giving an overview of the famous library problem of CL, the 
solutions that existed before QL, explaining their advantages and 
disadvantages. Also, and very important, what people were actually using and 
what difficulties they were facing. In a survey he did, most CL programmers 
were installing libraries by hand, including Zach! Then he proceed to how 
Quicklisp was developed, some technical issues, what is the role of Quicklisp 
and what is the reception after one year. The talk focused then on the social 
impact of Quicklisp in the community. One of the things that makes Zach happy 
it&rsquo;s the number of emails he gets saying that people are back to using CL 
and contributing more to the community (i.e., making libraries available) 
because of QL. Finally, some indications of what is to come. My perception is 
that the possibility to enable hacking as it was possible with clbuild is one 
of the most exciting future features for Quicklisp. Zach&rsquo;s talk was 
excellent from all points of view!</p> 
<p>The last talk of the day was by Hans H&uuml;bner. This was my second 
favorite presentation. Although the topic, code style and conventions, can 
start some heated discussions, I must say that I agree with almost everything 
Hans H&uuml;bner mentioned. However, like everything, some common sense is 
always necessary. One of the main points was that lispers should not use 
constructions which are not part of the standard language when the standard 
provide options, just because you want to save some typing. It is more 
important for another programmer to understand faster what is written than 
forcing him to look for the definition of the unusual constructs. Theif*, bind 
were examples given. Hans also talked abut the 80-column rule, style guides, 
etc. In the end, it always depends on the project, the people, etc, but code 
style is important and should not be ignored.</p> 
<p>The meeting ended with several lightning talks. The most interesting bits 
were:Marco Antoniotti announced ELS 2012, to be held in Zadar, Croatia, around 
April-May;Christophe Rhodes talked again about swankr, a swank and slime for R; 
theannouncement of ABCL 1.0.0 by Erik Huelsmann. </p> 
<p>Some words on the organization. Organizing a meeting of this kind is not 
easy andEdi Weitz and Arthur Lemmens must be congratulated for making a great 
event. Not all was perfect but everything went smoothly. I wish that it 
continues to happen in the coming years!</p>

<h2>NXT&nbsp;2.0</h2> 
<p>leave a comment &raquo;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Yesterday I finally dedicated some time to assembly my newest toy: a Lego 
Mindstorm NXT 2.0! I just made the basic drive rover with some sounds. I need 
now to explore more the capabilities of the NXT. I need to see what other 
options exist in terms of programming the brick.</p> 
<p>As before, the internal language it&rsquo;s a bit limited. I played with 
the original Mindstorm a few years ago. Already back then, I used for a few 
experiments a set of Lisp macros to generate some commands for the rover. There 
isXS in Lisp but I&rsquo;m not sure if that is what I want. Something more like 
lejOS would be nicer (but in Common Lisp). Anyway, regardless of that, a 
mindstorm is always a cool toy :-)</p>
