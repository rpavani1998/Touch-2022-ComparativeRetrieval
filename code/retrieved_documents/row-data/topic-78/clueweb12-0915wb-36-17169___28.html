<p>I recently attempted to fit the quicksort algorithm into under 140 
characters of Ruby. It looks like:</p> 
<pre> <code> def q(s);t=s.dup;t.size&lt;=1 ? t 
:(p=t[i=t.size/2];t.delete_at(i);x,y=[],[];t.each{|e|e&lt;p ? x&lt;&lt;e : 
y&lt;&lt;e};n=q(x);m=q(y);n+[p]+m)end</code> </pre> 
<p></p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s a little hard to read, so here&rsquo;s the first working 
version I wrote before attempting to squeeze it into twitterable form:</p> 
<pre> <code> def quicksort(sequence) tmp = sequence.clone if tmp.count &lt;= 1 
return tmp else pivot_index = (tmp.count / 2) pivot = tmp[pivot_index] # pull 
the pivot out of the array. tmp.delete_at(pivot_index) # create 2 
sub-sequences, one &lt; pivot, one &gt;= pivot sub_sequence_a = [] 
sub_sequence_b = [] tmp.each do |element| if element &lt; pivot sub_sequence_a 
&lt;&lt; element elsif element &gt;= pivot sub_sequence_b &lt;&lt; element end 
end # quicksort sub-sequence 1 new_sub_sequence_a = quicksort(sub_sequence_a) # 
quicksort sub-sequence 2 new_sub_sequence_b = quicksort(sub_sequence_b) # 
return sub1 plus pivot plus sub2 new_sub_sequence_a + [pivot] + 
new_sub_sequence_b end end</code> </pre> 
<p>A key step in this implementation is pulling the pivot <em>out</em> of the 
array (see around line 9). In my first naive attempt at quicksort I just 
deleted the pivot right from<code>sequence</code>, the array object that is 
passed in to be sorted.</p> 
<p>Anyone see the problem there?</p> 
<p>At first, I sure didn&rsquo;t. After all, I put the pivot back in the 
return value, right? (Second to last line.)</p> 
<p>That does indeed ensure that the <em>returned</em>, <em>sorted</em> array 
has all the same elements as the original array. But the original array that I 
passed in would now have one less item. It would (did) lose an element every 
time I&rsquo;d run my naive (read: incorrect) implementation of quicksort on it.
</p> 
<h3>WTF?</h3> 
<p>Enter passing objects by reference. In Ruby, everything is passed by 
reference.(1) It can be easy to forget this, though, especially if you&rsquo;re 
used to changing objects with the assignment (&ldquo;=&rdquo;) operator.</p> 
<blockquote> 1 Just in case that&rsquo;s not a familiar phrase, &ldquo;by 
reference&rdquo; refers to the idea that a reference to the<strong>actual object
</strong> (like a pointer, if you will) is being passed, not just a copy of the 
object, or just the value of the object (which is called passing &ldquo;by 
value&rdquo;). (And no, by &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not talking about 
pointers in C/C++, I&rsquo;m just trying to say that a reference<strong>refers 
to</strong> or in a sense, <strong>points to</strong>, the actual original 
object.)</blockquote> 
<p>For example:</p> 
<pre> <code> def reassign(obj) obj = &quot;Not the same!&quot; end #irb &gt; 
greeting = &quot;Hello!&quot; =&gt; &quot;Hello!&quot; &gt; reassign(greeting) 
=&gt; &quot;Not the same!&quot; &gt; puts greeting Hello! =&gt; nil</code> 
</pre> 
<p>So, assignment inside a method doesn&rsquo;t change our object. Ruby must 
not<em>really</em> be passing a referece, right? Wrong, it sure is.</p> 
<pre> <code> def shiftit(obj) obj.shift end #irb &gt; h = {:foo =&gt; 
&quot;bar&quot;, :bar =&gt; &quot;baz&quot;, :baz =&gt; &quot;qux&quot;} =&gt; 
{:foo=&gt;&quot;bar&quot;,:bar =&gt;&quot;baz&quot;,:baz=&gt;&quot;qux&quot;} 
&gt; a = [1,2,3,4,5,6] =&gt; [1,2,3,4,5,6] &gt; shiftit(h) =&gt; {:bar 
=&gt;&quot;baz&quot;,:baz=&gt;&quot;qux&quot;} &gt; shiftit(a) =&gt; 
[2,3,4,5,6] &gt; # BUT WAIT &gt; h =&gt; {:bar 
=&gt;&quot;baz&quot;,:baz=&gt;&quot;qux&quot;} &gt; a =&gt; [2,3,4,5,6]</code> 
</pre> 
<p>Huh. How about that. Our original objects were changed when they were 
modified inside the method.</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;ll find that any method of modifying an object inside another 
method with actually change (even delete, if you go that far) the original 
object that you passed in. Ruby quite definitely, always, passed objects by 
reference.</p> 
<h3>Then How come <em>assignment</em> in a method doesn&rsquo;t change an 
object?</h3> 
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question. I was stumped on this one myself for a bit. 
The answer comes down to the idea of<em>bindings</em> and <em>scope</em>. When 
I tell Ruby that<code>foo = &quot;bar&quot;</code>, Ruby binds the local 
variable named<em>foo</em> to a String object, &ldquo;bar&rdquo;. foo is a 
String object, and when I pass it to my<code>reassign</code> method, I am 
passing a reference to the real object,<code>foo</code>.</p> 
<p>However, inside the method, I&rsquo;m in a new scope. When I type <code>foo 
= &quot;Some new value&quot;</code> inside the method scope, trying to reassign 
<code>foo</code>, Ruby sees that I&rsquo;m binding foo to a new value; but from 
inside method scope, Ruby is not going to let me change the binding from 
another scope. So instead, Ruby figures that I want a local variable that is<em>
also</em> named <code>foo</code>, inside my method scope, and it assigns my new 
value to the local<code>foo</code>, not the original <code>foo</code>.</p> 
<p>I could alter it, still: if I changed the <code>reassign</code> method so 
that it did<code>obj.replace(&quot;Some new value!&quot;)</code> inside the 
method body, the original object would be changed, just like<code>shiftit</code>
 did to the array and the hash.</p> 
<h3>I think I&rsquo;m a clone, now</h3> 
<p>Back to the quicksort implementation I started with: the way to get around 
this is to use .clone or .dup to get a<em>copy</em> of the object. That way you 
aren&rsquo;t actually modifying the original object. Even when I realized this 
was happening, I still made the mistake of just doing<code>tmp = sequence</code>
 on my first try. No good; same exact problem.<code>tmp</code> is now just a 
reference straight to<code>sequence</code>, so altering <code>tmp</code> 
modifies<code>sequence</code> as well. Need to use <code>tmp = sequence.clone
</code>, or something like it.</p> 
<h3>That&rsquo;s all I have to say about that</h3> 
<p>Say it with me now: &ldquo;Ruby passes objects by reference. <em>Ruby 
passes objects by reference.</em> Every time. <em>All the time.</em> <strong>By 
reference.</strong>&rdquo;</p> 
<h1>Fun With the Major Scale</h1> 
<p> Aug 11th, 2010 </p> 
<p>Got to chatting with Nate (@fowlduck) about musical notation last night. He 
was pointing out that bits of the notation seem arbitrary and probably archaic, 
likening it to legacy code of a sort. For example, why no whole tone between B 
and C, E and F? This post is NOT meant to be a defense of music notation, a 
&ldquo;setting straight&rdquo; of anything, or even a definitive description of 
musical theory (at which I&rsquo;m a rank amateur). It just got me thinking 
about the major scale and the circle of fourths &amp; fifths, which led to some 
playing around on the command line, which led to this. Enjoy.</p> 
<p>The thing that makes it seem so strange is, at least in part, the major 
scale. The octave consists of twelve semi-tones, in which the major scale is 
set in this pattern: whole tone, whole tone, semitone, whole tone, whole tone, 
whole tone, whole tone, semi-tone. Like so:</p> 
<pre> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 | C | | D | | E | F | | G | | A | | B | C 
| ... (etc)</pre> 
<p>The next root note (13th semi-tone, above) is only a semi-tone off from the 
last note of the scale. And so on. The semi-tone before or after any given note 
is a flat or a sharp respectively, giving rise to the B# == C, Cb == B, E# == 
F, Fb == E identities. So, let&rsquo;s just accept the scale as a given; that 
this pattern of whole tones and semi-tones sounds pleasing to the ear.</p> 
<p>So why is it C that has all natural notes (no sharps or flats)? Good 
question. That part, to me at least, does seem arbitrary, but effectively it 
doesn&rsquo;t matter. Given the above system, the major scale in one key and 
one key only will have no sharps or flats. But still, why structure the notes 
this way? It still doesn&rsquo;t necessarily seem to make sense.</p> 
<p>There are a few reasons. For one, we want to be able to express every scale 
by naming off the notes, and we&rsquo;d like each note to be a different 
letter. So we need 7 letters.</p> 
<p>Where it gets really interesting is the circle of fourths and fifths.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So, if you go around clockwise, you&rsquo;re counting by fifths (G is the 
fifth note of the C major scale, D is the fifth note of the G major scale, etc) 
and if you go around counter-clockwise you&rsquo;re counting by fourths (F is 
the fourth note of C, Bb is the fourth note of F, etc). If you go around 
clockwise, each scale has one additional sharped note until you get to 180 
degrees around, then it has n-1 flat notes, and loses one flat each fifth till 
you get back to C (no sharps or flats); vis versa the other direction. This is 
actually really cool; each scale, in addition to being unique in that, well, it 
has a different root note, is unique in that it is the only scale to have its 
specific number of sharps or flats. If a scale has 3 sharps, it&rsquo;s A. 
Period. There isn&rsquo;t another choice. Neat!</p> 
<p>So for fun, we can explore the circle of fifths in the command line. First 
lets set it up:</p> 
<pre> <code> &gt; circle = (0..11).map{|n| n*7%12 } =&gt; [0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 11, 
6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5]</code> </pre> 
<p>Well. That doesn&rsquo;t mean a whole lot. How can we map it to notes? 
Let&rsquo;s just construct a reference array really quick. (I&rsquo;m making it 
an instance variable so I can use it in a method later; this was all done in 
irb.)</p> 
<pre> <code> &gt; @notes = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C#/Db&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, 
&quot;D#/Eb&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;E#/F&quot;, &quot;F#/Gb&quot;, 
&quot;G&quot;, &quot;G#/Ab&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A#/Bb&quot;, 
&quot;B/Cb&quot;] =&gt; [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C#/Db&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, 
&quot;D#/Eb&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;E#/F&quot;, &quot;F#/Gb&quot;, 
&quot;G&quot;, &quot;G#/Ab&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A#/Bb&quot;, 
&quot;B/Cb&quot;]</code> </pre> 
<p>So, to read our circle, we&rsquo;d do:</p> 
<pre> <code> &gt; circle.map{|n| @notes[n]} =&gt; [&quot;C&quot;, 
&quot;G&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;B/Cb&quot;, 
&quot;F#/Gb&quot;, &quot;C#/Db&quot;, &quot;G#/Ab&quot;, &quot;D#/Eb&quot;, 
&quot;A#/Bb&quot;, &quot;E#/F&quot;]</code> </pre> 
<p>Hooray. The circle of fifths. Now, so what? Well, let&rsquo;s make a little 
method to construct a major scale from the<code>@notes</code> variable. 
We&rsquo;ll take a root note as an argument, so we can construct any major 
scale we like.</p> 
<pre> <code> &gt; def major(root=0) ?&gt; offset = (0..11).map{|n| 
@notes[(n+root)%12]} ?&gt; [offset[0], offset[2], offset[4], offset[5], 
offset[7], offset[9], offset[11]].join(&quot; &quot;) ?&gt; end =&gt; nil</code>
</pre> 
<p>So, just calling <code>major</code> with no arguments should give us the C 
major scale; calling with, say, 5 should give us F major (5 in this case is the 
index of F in @notes; but you were already following that, I know):</p> 
<pre> <code> &gt; major =&gt; &quot;C D E E#/F G A B/Cb&quot; &gt; major(5) 
=&gt; &quot;E#/F G A A#/Bb C D E&quot;</code> </pre> 
<p>So we said that the circle of fifths added a sharp each increment, and then 
flipped to flats and removed on each increment. Let&rsquo;s watch it happen:</p>
<pre> <code> &gt;&gt; circle.each{|n| puts major(n) } C D E F G A B G A B C D 
E F#/Gb D E F#/Gb G A B C#/Db A B C#/Db D E F#/Gb G#/Ab E F#/Gb G#/Ab A B C#/Db 
D#/Eb B C#/Db D#/Eb E F#/Gb G#/Ab A#/Bb F#/Gb G#/Ab A#/Bb B C#/Db D#/Eb F C#/Db 
D#/Eb F F#/Gb G#/Ab A#/Bb C G#/Ab A#/Bb C C#/Db D#/Eb F G D#/Eb F G G#/Ab A#/Bb 
C D A#/Bb C D D#/Eb F G A F G A A#/Bb C D E</code> </pre> 
<p>Not as neat as it could look since I put the #/b both in the original notes 
array; the note you&rsquo;d read would be the one with a consecutive letter 
after the previous note. So in G, the note following E is F#. In Eb, the note 
following G is Ab&hellip; and so on. The same note<em>letter</em> only appears 
once in any given scale. A sharp or flat is added or removed each increment you 
go around the circle.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any startling conclusions to close this off with. Just 
that music is pretty cool, and that a few of the things that<em>seem</em> 
arbitrary just have to be that way &ndash; assuming we&rsquo;re going to base 
the system around 12 equally tempered semitones (seeEqual Temperment, or even 
Bach&rsquo;s Well-Tempered Clavier (evidently there&rsquo;s some dispute over 
whether or not Bach&rsquo;s intended tuning was equal or, uh, 
&ldquo;well&rdquo; tempered; I was not aware of this!)) and a 7 note major 
scale &ndash; neither of which are absolutely necessary, of course, and there 
are other ways to do it. SeeMathematics of musical scales and tuning systems 
for more.</p> 
<p>Happy musicking.</p>

<h1>I Write Like</h1> 
<p> Jul 27th, 2010 </p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the I write like links show up on facebook and twitter a 
few times, so I decided I&rsquo;d take a look. Not content to simply feed it 
one sample, I fed it the text from several of the posts from the archive. Here 
were the results:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>I Hold Strong Opinions About The Placement Of Curly Braces</li> 
<li>
<p>=&gt; I write like: <strong>H.P. Lovecraft</strong>. <em>Really? 
Wait&hellip; what?</em></p></li> 
<li>
<p>No, We&rsquo;re Not The Stupid Ones</p></li> 
<li>In Which I Am No Longer A Very Good Bachelor</li> 
<li>Oracle To Acquire Oracle</li> 
<li>
<p>=&gt; I write like: <strong>Cory Doctorow</strong>. <em>Huh. You think? 
Well, okay. Thanks!</em></p></li> 
<li>
<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s New Web</p></li> 
<li>=&gt; I write like: <strong>Jonathan Swift</strong>. <em>[blushing] No, 
no&hellip; you&rsquo;re too kind.</em></li> </ul> 
<p>Not sure how they are analyzing the text and reaching their conclusions, 
but there&rsquo;s at least a<em>little</em> bit of smarts in there; that last 
one, the one which was compared to Swift, is indeed a satire, though I&rsquo;m 
not going to claim it&rsquo;s in the calibre of Swift&rsquo;s satire, but 
still; their algorithm picked something out of it which prompted the 
comparison. Not bad.</p> 
<p>So, evidently, according to their analyses, I write most often like Cory 
Doctorow. I&rsquo;ve only read<em>Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom</em>, and 
several of his blog posts/essays, but enough to consider it a compliment, 
though I&rsquo;m not certain it&rsquo;s deserved. Regardless, there we have it.

<h1>How Not to Write Sorting Algorithms in Ruby</h1> 
<p> Jul 18th, 2010 </p> 
<p>The second chapter of <em>Introduction To Algorithms</em> by Cormen, 
Leiserson, et al., describes the algorithms for Insertion Sort and Merge Sort 
in pseudocode, and compares their relative efficiency (or lack thereof). I 
decided to write them out in Ruby and run some simple benchmarks, just for fun.
</p> 
<h2>Insertion Sort</h2> 
<p>There are a variety of ways one could write the insertion sort in Ruby; 
this is more or less an literal translation of the<em>Intro to Algorithms</em> 
pseudocode to ruby &ndash; it could perhaps be made a little more ruby-ish, but 
here&rsquo;s my version:</p> 
<pre> <code> def insertion_sort(sequence) 
sequence[1..sequence.size].each_with_index do |j, index| i = index 
sequence[0..i].reverse.each do |k| break unless k &gt; j sequence[i + 1] = k i 
= i - 1 end sequence[i+1] = j end end</code> </pre> 
<p>In a nutshell:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Start with the second element (index 1).</li> 
<li>Save the index in a local variable, because we&rsquo;re going to use it to 
figure out which array element to swap the current element into.</li> 
<li>Take the sub-array 0..i (where <em>i</em> is the current index being 
looked at), and go backwards until the element in your inner loop is less than 
the current element from the outer loop, also decrementing<em>i</em> each 
iteration.</li> 
<li>Copy the element in index [i] to index [i + 1]</li> 
<li>Outside the inner loop, we&rsquo;ll put the current element at [i + 1].
</li> </ol> 
<p>In case this is a little unclear, it would go something like this:</p> 
<p>Starting array: [5,2,3,1,4,0]</p> 
<p>First pass: [<strong>2</strong>,<em>5</em>,3,1,4,0]</p> 
<p>Second pass: [2,<strong>3</strong>,<em>5</em>,1,4,0]</p> 
<p>Third pass: [<strong>1</strong>,<em>2</em>,<em>3</em>,<em>5</em>,4,0]</p> 
<p>Fourth pass: [1,2,3,<strong>4</strong>,<em>5</em>,0]</p> 
<p>Fifth pass: [<strong>0</strong>,<em>1</em>,<em>2</em>,<em>3</em>,<em>4</em>,
<em>5</em>]</p> 
<p>(<strong>Bold elements</strong> are the ones which were the 
&ldquo;current&rdquo; element moved back,<em>italic elements</em> are the ones 
that had to be shifted forward in this step.)</p> 
<h2>Merge Sort</h2> 
<p>The merge sort is split into two parts; a <code>merge</code> method that 
acts as a helper, and the actual<code>merge_sort</code> which calls itself 
recursively, also calling<code>merge</code> when needed.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a version modeled after the pseudocode in <em>Intro to 
Algorithms</em>:</p> 
<pre> <code> def merge_sort(sequence, first, last) if first &lt; last mid = 
(first + last) / 2 merge_sort(sequence, first, mid) merge_sort(sequence, mid + 
1, last) merge(sequence, first, mid + 1, last) end end def merge(sequence, 
first, mid, last) left = sequence[first..mid - 1] right = sequence[mid..last] 
left.push(Float::MAX) right.push(Float::MAX) i = 0 j = 0 (first..last).each do 
|n| if left[i] &lt;= right[j] sequence[n] = left[i] i = i + 1 else sequence[n] 
= right[j] j = j + 1 end end end</code> </pre> 
<p>A few notes: You&rsquo;ll notice that in the <code>merge</code> method, 
when the sequence is split into two parts, the value Float::MAX is pushed onto 
each as the final element.<em>Intro to Algorithms</em> uses the idea that 
&ldquo;infinity&rdquo; is set to the last element. Hopefully I can explain why 
in the description of the algorithm.</p> 
<p>First, the merge method. The merge method assumes that the left half and 
the right half of the section of the array it&rsquo;s looking at are<em>already 
sorted</em>. Having made this assumption, it loops through the range it&rsquo;s 
considering (<code>first..last</code>), and puts either the first element of 
the left side, or the first element of the right side, whichever it least. It 
increments each subarray as it goes; when it gets past the last element of 
either array, Float::MAX will<em>always</em> be higher (or so we assume, for 
the sake of this implementation) than whatever is in the other array. So merge 
finishes up, basically (ahem)<em>merging</em> the two halves together in place, 
with the whole first..last range sorted.</p> 
<p>Now, the actual merge_sort method. It first checks to see if first &lt; 
last; if this were<em>false</em>, then the range would be an array of size 1, 
and an array of size 1 is already sorted. So assuming the range first..last is 
&gt; 1, it calculates a midpoint; integer division works fine for this, using
<code>(first + last) / 2</code>. Then it calls itself recursively on each 
subarray; these in turn will continue splitting each subarray into two parts 
until it gets to the point where it&rsquo;s just two subarrays of one element 
each; which are then fed to<code>merge</code> and sorted. As the method returns 
from each level of recursion, each &ldquo;half&rdquo; of the subarray under 
consideration has been sorted, until it gets all the way back to the first call 
to<code>merge_sort</code>, and executes <code>merge</code> on each (sorted) 
half of the full array.</p> 
<p>Phew. I&rsquo;m going to attempt to show another example, in case 
that&rsquo;s helpful. Let&rsquo;s say we started with the same starting array 
as the insertion_sort example. This time, to show what the recursion is 
actually doing, I&rsquo;ll write out what each nested call to merge_sort( 
and/or merge) would actually look like:</p> 
<p>Starting array: [5,2,3,1,4,0]</p> 
<pre> merge_sort([5,2,3,1,4,0], 0, 5): mid &lt;- 2 merge_sort([5,2,3], 0, 2): 
mid &lt;- 1 merge_sort([5,2], 0, 1): mid &lt;- 0 merge_sort([5], 0, 0): 
merge_sort([2], 1, 1): merge([5,2],0, 1, 1): left &lt;- [5,&infin;] right &lt;- 
[2,&infin;] loop(0..1): [2,5] # just showing the result in this step; the two 
elements are sorted. merge_sort([3], 2, 2): merge([2,5,3], 0, 2, 2): left &lt;- 
[2,5,&infin;] right &lt;- [3,&infin;] loop(0..2): [2,3,5] merge_sort([1,4,0], 
3, 5): mid &lt;- 4 merge_sort([1,4], 3, 4): mid &lt;- 3 merge_sort([1], 3, 3): 
merge_sort([4], 4, 4): merge([1,4], 3, 4, 4): left &lt;- [1,&infin;] right 
&lt;- [4,&infin;] loop(3..4): [1,4] merge_sort([0], 5, 5): merge([1,4,0], 3, 5, 
5): left &lt;- [1,4,&infin;] right &lt;- [0,&infin;] loop(3..5): [0,1,4] 
merge([2,3,5,0,1,4], 0, 3, 5): left &lt;- [2,3,5,&infin;] right &lt;- 
[0,1,4,&infin;] loop(0..5): [0,1,2,3,4,5]</pre> 
<p>Uhm, hopefully that&rsquo;s clear. If you&rsquo;re bothering to read this 
and it still isn&rsquo;t clear, just run the sort locally and add some<code>
print</code> or <code>puts</code> statements liberally so you can see 
what&rsquo;s going on. Note: I did take a liberty in the above listing of 
what&rsquo;s happening; in actuality the entire array is passed each time; I 
made it look as though just the subarray were being passed in each case, 
because that is the only part that is being looked at in each nested section. 
Again, if you&rsquo;re interested enough in the topic that you&rsquo;re still 
working out this algorithm, fire up irb and just try it out, it will make more 
sense as you do so.</p> 
<h2>Wait, why is this called &ldquo;how <em>not</em> to write sorting 
algorithms&hellip;?&rdquo;</h2> 
<p>Aha. I thought you&rsquo;d never ask. Well, the main reason is that both of 
these methods are significantly slower than good old Array::sort, which is 
built in to Ruby (and which, as far as I know, is implemented using thequicksort
 algorithm).</p> 
<p>So, just for fun, I wrote a little script to make some benchmarks of these 
various methods on arrays of various sizes. Here were the results:</p>

<p>The interesting column is the last one: <em>real</em>, as in &ldquo;real 
time&rdquo; (more or less, taking into the account that we&rsquo;re just 
benchmarking).</p> 
<p>The small array is pretty fast for all three methods, but even still, we 
can see that merge_sort is a<em>little</em> faster, and the built in .sort! 
(using quicksort) is<em>way</em> faster: only 0.000016 seconds.</p> 
<p>The next bigger, bigger_array, the differences stand out a little more. 
Insertion takes 0.24 seconds, merge takes 0.028, and sort! (again), way faster, 
only 0.00016 seconds.</p> 
<p>A ten thousand element array starts to show the difference even more 
dramatically: insertion_sort now takes 24.1 seconds, close to half a minute, 
while the merge_sort still runs in under a second. sort!, once again, is 
blowing them away at only 0.0016 seconds.</p> 
<p>Finally, a hundred thousand element array; sorry for the lack of stats, but 
I was too impatient to let insertion_sort finish. Let&rsquo;s just say it would 
take awhile. Now even the merge_sort shows its limits, taking over a minute, 
about 74.3 seconds. And finally, good old sort! clocking in at only 0.02 
seconds.</p> 
<p>So the reason this is how <em>not</em> to write sorting algorithms in ruby 
is simply that, you really probably don&rsquo;t need to, unless you need 
something faster than a quicksort written in C. The reason, hopefully, to be 
playing around writing algorithms in Ruby or in<em>whatever</em> your favorite 
language happens to be, is just to understand them better.</p> 
<p>And it&rsquo;s fun.</p>

<p>Ruby Algorithm library &lt;&ndash; some pretty interesting stuff in here. I 
didn&rsquo;t look at this until after I&rsquo;d already written my versions of 
the insertion sort and the merge sort; their version of insertion_sort is 
nearly the same, but their merge sort is somewhat more succinct, and looks 
worth playing around with.)</p> 
<h1>Relative Primes, Revisited</h1> 
<p> Jul 8th, 2010 </p> 
<p>As I thought; there&rsquo;s always a better way to do it. @jmchilton, who 
was a TA when I took Structure of Computer Programming I (or whatever it was 
called; the Scheme class) at the U of M, supplied this alternative solution to 
the relative prime problem:</p> 
<pre> <code> def gcd(a, b); b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b); end; def rp(a, b); 
gcd(a, b) == 1; end</code> </pre> 
<p>Or, indented:</p> 
<pre> <code> def gcd(a, b) b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b) end def rp(a, b) gcd(a, 
b) == 1 end</code> </pre> 
<p>In other words, it pays to know your math. <code>gcd</code> is a recursive 
function, basically Euclid&rsquo;s algorithm for finding the greatest common 
denominator.<code>rp</code>, then, simply returns true if the GCD of a and b is 
1; otherwise false.</p> 
<p>Very nice. I wish I&rsquo;d thought to do it that way, but I&rsquo;ll 
certainly remember it.</p> &larr; Older Blog Archives Newer &rarr; <br>
