<p>Insertion sort is a great algorithm, because it&rsquo;s very intuitive and 
it is easy to implement, but the problem is that it makes many exchanges for 
each &ldquo;light&rdquo; element in order to put it on the right place. Thus 
&ldquo;light&rdquo; elements at the end of the list may slow down the 
performance of insertion sort a lot. That is why in 1959Donald Shell proposed 
an algorithm that tries to overcome this problem by comparing items of the list 
that lie far apart.</p> 
<p><br>
Insertion sort compares every single item with all the rest elements 
of the list in order to find its place, while Shell sort compares items that 
lie far apart. This means light elements move faster to the front of the list.
</p> 
<p>On the other hand, it is obvious that by comparing items that lie apart the 
list can&rsquo;t be sorted in one pass like insertion sort. That is why on each 
pass we should use a fixed gap between the items, then decrease the value on 
every consecutive iteration.</p> 
<p><br>
We start to compare items with a fixed gap, that becomes lesser on 
each iteration until it gets to 1.</p> 
<p>However it is intuitively clear that Shell sort may need even more 
comparisons than insertion sort. Then why should we use it?</p> 
<p>The thing is that insertion sort is not an effective sorting algorithm at 
all, but in some cases, when the list is almost sorted it can be quite useful. 
With Shell sort, once the list is sorted for gap = i, it is sorted for every 
gap = j, where j &lt; i, and this is its main advantage.</p> 
<p><br>
Shell sort can make less exchanges than insertion sort.<br>
</p> 
<h3>How to choose gap size</h3> 
<p>A &quot;not-so-cool&quot; thing about Shell sort is that we have to choose 
&ldquo;the perfect&rdquo; gap sequence for our list. This is not an easy task, 
because it is very dependent on he input data. The good news is that there are 
some gap sequences proven to work well in general cases.<br>
</p> 
<h3>Shell Sequence</h3> 
<p>Donald Shell proposes a sequence that follows the formula FLOOR(N/2k), then 
for N = 1000, we get the following sequence: [500, 250, 125, 62, 31, 15, 7, 3, 
1]</p> 
<p><br>
Shell sequence for N=1000: (500, 250, 125, 62, 31, 15, 7, 3, 1)<br>

</p> 
<h3>Pratt Sequence</h3> 
<p>Pratt proposes another sequence that&rsquo;s growing with a slower pace 
than the Shell&rsquo;s sequence. He proposes successive numbers of the form 
2p3q or [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, ...].</p> 
<p><br>
Pratt sequence: (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, ...)<br>
</p> 
<h3>Knuth Sequence</h3> 
<p>Knuth on other hand proposes his own sequence following the formula (3k 
&ndash; 1) / 2 or [1, 4, 14, 40, 121, ...]</p> 
<p><br>
Knuth sequence: (1, 4, 13, 40, 121, ...)</p> 
<p>Of course there are many other gap sequences, proposed by various 
developers and researchers, but the problem is that the effectiveness of the 
algorithm strongly depends on the input data. But before taking a look to the 
complexity of Shell sort, let&rsquo;s see first its implementation.<br>
</p> 
<h2>Implementation</h2> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a Shell sort implementation on PHP using the Pratt gap 
sequence. The thing is that for this data set other gap sequences may appear to 
be better solutions.</p> 
<pre>$input = array(6, 5, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4); function shell_sort($arr) { $gaps 
= array(1, 2, 3, 4, 6); $gap = array_pop($gaps); $len = count($arr); while($gap 
&gt; 0) { for($i = $gap; $i &lt; $len; $i++) { $temp = $arr[$i]; $j = $i; 
while($j &gt;= $gap &amp;&amp; $arr[$j - $gap] &gt; $temp) { $arr[$j] = $arr[$j 
- $gap]; $j -= $gap; } $arr[$j] = $temp; } $gap = array_pop($gaps); } return 
$arr; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 shell_sort($input);</pre> 
<p><br>
It&rsquo;s easy to change this code in order to work with Shell 
sequence.</p> 
<pre>$input = array(6, 5, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4); function shell_sort($arr) { $len 
= count($arr); $gap = floor($len/2); while($gap &gt; 0) { for($i = $gap; $i 
&lt; $len; $i++) { $temp = $arr[$i]; $j = $i; while($j &gt;= $gap &amp;&amp; 
$arr[$j - $gap] &gt; $temp) { $arr[$j] = $arr[$j - $gap]; $j -= $gap; } 
$arr[$j] = $temp; } $gap = floor($gap/2); } return $arr; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8 shell_sort($input);</pre> 
<h2><br>
Complexity</h2> 
<p>Yet again we can&rsquo;t determine the exact complexity of this algorithm, 
because it depends on the gap sequence. However we may say what is the 
complexity of Shell sort with the sequences of Knuth, Pratt and Donald Shell. 
For the Shell&rsquo;s sequence the complexity is O(n2), while for the 
Pratt&rsquo;s sequence it is O(n*log2(n)). The best approach is the Knuth 
sequence where the complexity is O(n3/2), as you can see on the diagram bellow.
</p> 
<p><br>
Complexity of Shell sort with different gap sequences.<br>
</p> 
<h2>Application</h2> 
<p>Well, as insertion sort and bubble sort, Shell sort is not very effective 
compared to quicksort or merge sort. The good thing is that it is quite easy to 
implement (not easier than insertion sort), but in general it should be avoided 
for large data sets. Perhaps the main advantage of Shell sort is that the list 
can be sorted for a gap greater than 1 and thus making less exchanges than 
insertion sort.</p>

HTML5 is the most dramatic step in the evolution of web standards. It 
incorporates features such as geolocation, video playback and drag-and-drop.
HTML5 allows developers to create rich internet applications without the need 
for third party APIs and browser plug-ins.&nbsp; Under the banner of HTML5, 
modern web standards such as CSS3, SVG, XHR2, WebSockets, IndexedDB, and 
AppCache are pushing the boundaries for what a browser can achieve using web 
standards.&nbsp; ThisMicrozone is supported by Microsoft, and it will delve 
into the intricacies of using these new web technologies and teach you how to 
make your websites compatible with all of the modern browsers.<br>
