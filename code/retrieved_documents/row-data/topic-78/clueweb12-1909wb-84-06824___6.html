<h2>How To: Run a Perl script from PHP</h2> 
<p>23rd January 2006 - By Aaron</p> 
<p>While you may be dreading this part of your project, this task is 
surprisingly easy for non-major implementations.</p> 
<p>The example I&rsquo;m going to use for this is implementing a perl calendar 
into a php web page.</p> 
<p>First off, you need to have your web server correctly serving the perl as 
is. In other words, call the perl you will want from a web browser. If 
http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/helloworld.pl works right, then you&rsquo;re 
set. If it doesn&rsquo;t, you need to troubleshoot why your perl isn&rsquo;t 
being executed correctly.</p> 
<p>Next you need to use a simple include-style command called <code>virtual
</code>.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of this in use.</p>

<h2>Sorting: Quick Sort</h2> 
<p>13th January 2006 - By Paradochs</p> 
<h3>Information</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Order: O(n&sup2;)</li> 
<li>Best Case: O(nlog(n))</li> 
<li>Average: O(nlog(n))</li> 
<li>Memory Usage: O(log(n))</li> 
<li>Stable: No</li> 
<li>Comparison Based: Yes</li> </ul> 
<h3>Description (from wikipedia)</h3> 
<p>Quicksort is a well-known sorting algorithm developed by C. A. R. Hoare 
that, on average, makes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. However, in the 
worst case, it makes O(n&sup2;) comparisons. Typically, quicksort is 
significantly faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms, because its 
inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most 
real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the 
possibility of requiring quadratic time. Quicksort is a comparison sort.<br>
 
Quicksort sorts by employing a divide and conquer strategy to divide a list 
into two sub-lists.</p> 
<p>The steps are:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Pick an element, called a pivot, from the list.</li> 
<li>Reorder the list so that all elements which are less than the pivot come 
before the pivot and so that all elements greater than the pivot come after it 
(equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its 
final position. This is called the partition operation.</li> 
<li>Recursively sort the sub-list of lesser elements and the sub-list of 
greater elements.</li> </ol> 
<p>The base case of the recursion are lists of size zero or one, which are 
always sorted. The algorithm always terminates because it puts at least one 
element in its final place on each iteration.</p>

<h2>Sorting: Merge Sort</h2> 
<p>13th January 2006 - By Paradochs</p> 
<h3>Information</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Order: O(nlog(n))</li> 
<li>Best Case: O(nlog(n))</li> 
<li>Average: O(nlog(n))</li> 
<li>Memory Usage: O(n)</li> 
<li>Stable: Yes</li> 
<li>Comparison Based: Yes</li> </ul> 
<h3>Description (from wikipedia)</h3> 
<p>Conceptually, merge sort works as follows:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Divide the unsorted list into two sublists of about half the size</li> 
<li>Sort each of the two sublists</li> 
<li>Merge the two sorted sublists back into one sorted list.</li> </ol> 
<p>The algorithm was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.</p>

<h2>Sorting: Insertion Sort</h2> 
<p>13th January 2006 - By Paradochs</p> 
<h3>Information</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Order: O(n&sup2;)</li> 
<li>Best Case: O(n)</li> 
<li>Average: ?</li> 
<li>Memory Usage: O(1)</li> 
<li>Stable: Yes</li> 
<li>Comparison Based: Yes</li> </ul> 
<h3>Description (from wikipedia)</h3> 
<p>Insertion sort is a simple sort algorithm, a comparison sort in which the 
sorted array (or list) is built one entry at a time. It is much less efficient 
on large lists than the more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, 
or merge sort, but it has various advantages:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Simple to implement</li> 
<li>Efficient on (quite) small data sets</li> 
<li>Efficient on data sets which are already substantially sorted</li> 
<li>More efficient in practice than most other simple O(n2) algorithms such as 
selection sort or bubble sort</li> 
<li>Stable (does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys)
</li> 
<li>In-place (only requires a constant amount O(1) of extra memory space)</li> 
<li>It is an online algorithm, in that it can sort a list as it receives it.
</li> </ul> 
<p>In abstract terms, each iteration of an insertion sort removes an element 
from the input data, inserting it at the correct position in the already sorted 
list, until no elements are left in the input. The choice of which element to 
remove from the input is arbitrary and can be made using almost any choice 
algorithm.</p> 
<p>Sorting is typically done in-place. The result array after k iterations 
contains the first k entries of the input array and is sorted. In each step, 
the first remaining entry of the input is removed, inserted into the result at 
the right position.</p> 
<p>The most common variant, which operates on arrays, can be described as:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Suppose we have a method called insert designed to insert a value into a 
sorted sequence at the beginning of an array. It operates by starting at the 
end of the sequence and shifting each element one place to the right until a 
suitable position is found for the new element. It has the side effect of 
overwriting the value stored immediately after the sorted sequence in the array.
</li> 
<li>To perform insertion sort, start at the left end of the array and invoke 
insert to insert each element encountered into its correct position. The 
ordered sequence into which we insert it is stored at the beginning of the 
array in the set of indexes already examined. Each insertion overwrites a 
single value, but this is okay because it&rsquo;s the value we&rsquo;re 
inserting.</li> </ol>
