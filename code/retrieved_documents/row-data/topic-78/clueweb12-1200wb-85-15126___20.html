<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>The existing fortran code base provides many conventional ranking or 
sorting routines, but very few specialized ranking or sorting routines. 
Specifically, we know of no other fortran code which sorts or ranks only a 
small proportion of an array (partial ordering). Such partial ranking routines 
have applications in statistics for rapidly computing extreme order statistics, 
finding nearest neighbors, and other clustering operations. In addition, many 
applications need to work with only the unique values in an array (unique 
ordering). Such unique ranking routines allow users to isolate individual cases 
out of a mass of discrete data. Many times the frequency of the unique values 
proves interesting (e.g., empirical distributions). ORDERPACK handles all of 
these ordering needs. Also, ORDERPACK contains a partial unique ranking 
routine. Such a routine would prove useful in finding a limited number of 
unique values in an array. Inversion of orderings becomes difficult when 
duplicates exist (not a one-to-one relation). The ORDERPACK inverse ranking 
routine handles this difficult case. As an added bonus ORDERPACK provides an 
unusual routine which allows user controllable partial random permutation of 
arrays. ORDERPACK contains conventional or unconditional sorting routines as 
well.</p> 
<p>Finally, many fortran sorting or ranking routines do not take advantage of 
available memory and cache to maximize performance. The routines in ORDERPACK 
have been designed to take advantage of modern machines.</p> 
<p>To show the potential speed gains, we conducted an experiment involving 
100,000 trials of simulating a random vector of length 500 with duplicates and 
ranking the 9 smallest unique elements (duplicates discarded). On a 600 Mhz 
PIII machine using the CVF 6.1a compiler it took under 2.7 seconds for the 
unique partial ranking. In fact, the time was dominated by the simultation of 
the vector, looping, and other overhead.</p> 
<p>A similar experiment involved 100 trials of simulating a random vector of 
length 1,000,000 and ranking the 20 smallest elements (keeping duplicates). On 
a 460 Mhz AlphaStation with Compaq Fortran 90 V5.2, taking care to increase 
stacksize, partial ranking by itself took 2.3 seconds,<i>i.e.</i> 23 
milliseconds per vector. In that case, the total overhead for random vector 
simulation was nearly 1 minute.</p> 
<p>Users can freely download ORDERPACK 2.0 from this site.</p> 
<p>As time goes by, we hope to extend ORDERPACK, and welcome your suggestions 
to this aim.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h4>Ranking versus sorting</h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ranking consists in finding, for each element of a set, its rank in the 
sorted set, without effectively changing the initial order (or disorder&nbsp;!) 
of the set. In many instances, it suits better the actual need of the user, who 
can then use the index array to order other related sets or to select some 
elements, than a sorting program would.</p> 
<p>Ranking is especially needed when the sizes of the elements are large, and 
that moving them around is resource-consuming.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h4>Optimization choices</h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>We tried to take into account the recent trends in computing to make our 
compromise choices. Of course, no two problems are the same, and for some of 
them, the following decisions may happen to be wrong. We just hope that for 
most cases, they will be right.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Make extensive use of work arrays: Memory can be extended, time cannot.
</li> 
<li>Try to reduce the number of operations in the inner loops, even if it 
increases code size.</li> 
<li>Assume that cache size is relatively small, and try to maximize cache hits.
</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h4>Programming style</h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>Programming style is personal, and difficult to modify when one has been 
programming for several decades. Perhaps the following should have been under 
the<i>``word of apology''</i> item: my programming style does not stick tightly 
to commonly established rules.</p> 
<p>If you want to modify my programs, it might be useful to know: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>that I don't state IMPLICIT NONE, I prefer to rely on a good compiler to 
catch the sort of errors that it catches, and even more of them;</li> 
<li>that I use some naming conventions that go back to the 6-character 
variable names limit, and the conventions of implicit typing. Most names are 
made of a first letter indicating the type of the variable, a 3-letter radix 
defining its fundamental meaning, and one or two suffix letters for qualifiers. 
I joyfully mix French and English in these names, for instance, IWRKF is an 
integer index (I) of temporary nature (WRK) representing an upper limit (F --<i>
Fin</i> is <i>End</i> in French);</li> 
<li>that I used my pretty-printer f90ppr to indent and lay out the source code.
</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h4>Examples of use</h4> 
<p></p> 
<p>In order to make use of Fortran 90 argument passing improvements, it is 
necessary to make the routine interface known to the calling program. There are 
three main ways to implement it:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Explicit interfaces, either included in the body of the calling routine, 
or gathered in an ``interface module''. Interfaces for all<i>default real</i> 
ORDERPACK procedures are provided in fileinterfaces.f90. An example of 
including the interface block in the calling program can be found in the sample 
programsort7.f90.</li> 
<li>Embedding the routine of interest as a &quot;contained routine&quot; into 
the calling procedure. An example of such way can be found in thefollow.f90 
program, that rebuilds a curve from a set of X, Y coordinates.</li> 
<li>Embedding the routine of interest into a MODULE, and USEing that module in 
the procedure that calls the routine. This is fine and recommended for small 
programs, but yet may lead to architecture and<i>Makefile</i> problems for 
large applications. Since we wanted to provide generic versions of the 
routines, and to beF-compatible, this is the way we used here. An example of 
use is provided as the test programtstvalnth.f90.</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>A word of apology</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>When one looks at the description of a sorting algorithm, the process seems 
pretty simple, and can usually hold in 10 to 20 lines of pseudo-code. But if 
one wants an optimized program, one takes this simple implementation, and looks 
for redundant operations, investigates runs with sample data sets with a 
profiling tool, and is led to duplicate code with slight modifications rather 
than use tests in inner loops, to process differently the first and the last 
iterations, or to take into account some special cases that are only special in 
that they can be done faster.</p> 
<p>In the end, the number of lines of source code may be multiplied tenfold, 
and the readability decreased in a similar proportion. Unfortunately, this is 
the price to pay for speed of execution. It was that way when I started 
programming more than 20 years ago, and I have forsaken any hope that it might 
become otherwise before I return to dust. So please accept my apologies that 
this code is often complex and difficult to read.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Ranking</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>In some instances, one is not actually interested in modifying the order of 
the elements in a set, but only in knowing how to access them in increasing -- 
or decreasing -- order. Ranking, as it is called, provides the index array I(:) 
such as the set S(I(:)) is ordered. One of the advantages of carrying out 
ranking rather than sorting is that the index array can be computed without the 
performance penalty of moving the elements around when they are of large sizes. 
A similar point is that the index array can be used to index other data.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<h4>Unconditional ranking</h4> 
<p>Subroutine MRGRNK (XVALT, IMULT)<br>
 Ranks array XVALT into index array 
IRNGT, using merge-sort<br>
 For performance reasons, the first 2 passes are 
taken out of the standard loop, and use dedicated coding.</p> 
<p>Subroutine MRGREF (XVALT, IRNGT)<br>
 Ranks array XVALT into index array 
IRNGT, using merge-sort<br>
 This version is not optimized for performance, and 
is thus not as difficult to read as the previous one.</p> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Partial ranking</h4> 
<p>Subroutine RNKPAR (XVALT, IRNGT, NORD)<br>
 Ranks partially XVALT by IRNGT, 
up to order NORD (refined for speed)<br>
 This routine uses a pivoting strategy 
such as the one of finding the median based on the quicksort algorithm, but we 
skew the pivot choice to try to bring it to NORD as fast as possible. It uses 2 
temporary arrays, one where it stores the indices of the values smaller than 
the pivot, and the other for the indices of values larger than the pivot that 
we might still need later on. It iterates until it can bring the number of 
values in ILOWT to exactly NORD, and then uses an insertion sort to rank this 
set, since it is supposedly small.</p> 
<p>Subroutine RAPKNR (XVALT, IRNGT, NORD)<br>
 Same as RNKPAR, but in 
decreasing order (RAPKNR = RNKPAR spelt backwards).</p> 
<p>Subroutine REFPAR (XVALT, IRNGT, NORD)<br>
 Ranks partially XVALT by IRNGT, 
up to order NORD<br>
 This version is not optimized for performance, and is 
thus not as difficult to read as some other ones. It uses a pivoting strategy 
such as the one of finding the median based on the quicksort algorithm. It uses 
a temporary array, where it stores the partially ranked indices of the values. 
It iterates until it can bring the number of values lower than the pivot to 
exactly NORD, and then uses an insertion sort to rank this set, since it is 
supposedly small.</p> 
<p>Subroutine RINPAR (XVALT, IRNGT, NORD)<br>
 Ranks partially XVALT by IRNGT, 
up to order NORD<br>
 This version is not optimized for performance, and is 
thus not as difficult to read as some other ones. It uses insertion sort, 
limiting insertion to the first NORD values. It does not use any work array and 
is faster when NORD is very small (2-5), but worst case behavior (intially 
inverse sorted) can easily happen. In many cases, the refined quicksort method 
is faster.</p> 
<p>Integer Function INDNTH (XVALT, NORD)<br>
 Returns the index of the NORDth 
value of XVALT (in increasing order)<br>
 This routine uses a pivoting strategy 
such as the one of finding the median based on the quicksort algorithm, but we 
skew the pivot choice to try to bring it to NORD as fast as possible. It uses 2 
temporary arrays, one where it stores the indices of the values smaller than 
the pivot, and the other for the indices of values larger than the pivot that 
we might still need later on. It iterates until it can bring the number of 
values in ILOWT to exactly NORD, and then takes out the original index of the 
maximum value in this set.</p> 
<p>Subroutine INDMED (XVALT, INDM)<br>
 Returns the index of the median 
(((Size(XVALT)+1))/2th value) of XVALT<br>
 This routine uses the recursive 
procedure described in Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 3, 5.3.3 - 
This procedure is linear in time, and does not require to be able to 
interpolate in the set as the one used in INDNTH. It also has better worst case 
behavior than INDNTH, but is about 10% slower in average for random uniformly 
distributed values.</p> 
<p><b>Note that in Orderpack 1.0, this routine was a Function procedure, and 
is now changed to a Subroutine.</b></p> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Unique ranking</h4> 
<p>Subroutine UNIRNK (XVALT, IRNGT, NUNI)<br>
 Ranks an array, removing 
duplicate entries (uses merge sort).<br>
 The routine is similar to pure 
merge-sort ranking, but on the last pass, it discards indices that correspond 
to duplicate entries. For performance reasons, the first 2 passes are taken out 
of the standard loop, and use dedicated coding.</p> 
<p>Subroutine UNIPAR (XVALT, IRNGT, NORD)<br>
 Ranks partially XVALT by IRNGT, 
up to order NORD at most, removing duplicate entries<br>
 This routine uses a 
pivoting strategy such as the one of finding the median based on the quicksort 
algorithm, but we skew the pivot choice to try to bring it to NORD as quickly 
as possible. It uses 2 temporary arrays, one where it stores the indices of the 
values smaller than the pivot, and the other for the indices of values larger 
than the pivot that we might still need later on. It iterates until it can 
bring the number of values in ILOWT to exactly NORD, and then uses an insertion 
sort to rank this set, since it is supposedly small. At all times, the NORD 
first values in ILOWT correspond to distinct values of the input array.</p> 
<p>Subroutine UNIINV (XVALT, IGOEST)<br>
 Inverse ranking of an array, with 
removal of duplicate entries<br>
 The routine is similar to pure merge-sort 
ranking, but on the last pass, it sets indices in IGOEST to the rank of the 
original value in an ordered set with duplicates removed. For performance 
reasons, the first 2 passes are taken out of the standard loop, and use 
dedicated coding.</p> 
<p>Subroutine MULCNT (XVALT, IMULT)<br>
 Gives, for each array value, its 
multiplicity<br>
 The number of times that a value appears in the array is 
computed by using inverse ranking, counting for each rank the number of values 
that ``collide'' to this rank, and returning this sum to the locations in the 
original set. Uses subroutineUNIINV.</p> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Random permutation: an interesting use of ranking</h4> 
<p>A variation of the following problem was raised on the internet <i>
sci.math.num-analysis</i> news group:<br>
<i>Given an array, I would like to 
find a random permutation of this array that I could control with a 
``nearbyness'' parameter so that elements stay close to their initial 
locations. The ``nearbyness'' parameter ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 such that no 
element moves from its initial location, and 1 such that the permutation is 
fully random.</i></p> 
<p>Subroutine CTRPER (XVALT, PCLS)<br>
 Permute array XVALT randomly, but 
leaving elements close to their initial locations<br>
 The routine takes the 
1...size(XVALT) index array as real values, takes a combination of these values 
and of random values as a perturbation of the index array, and sorts the 
initial set according to the ranks of these perturbated indices. The relative 
proportion of initial order and random order is 1-PCLS / PCLS, thus when PCLS = 
0, there is no change in the order whereas the new order is fully random when 
PCLS = 1. Uses subroutineMRGRNK.</p> 
<p>The above solution found another application when I was asked the following 
question:<br>
<i>I am given two arrays, representing parents' incomes and their 
children's incomes, but I do not know which parents correspond to which 
children. I know from an independent source the value of the correlation 
coefficient between the incomes of the parents and of their children. I would 
like to pair the elements of these arrays so that the given correlation 
coefficient is attained, i.e. to reconstruct a realistic dataset, though very 
likely not to be the true one.</i></p> 
<p>Program GIVCOR<br>
 Given two arrays of equal length of unordered values, 
find a &quot;matching value&quot; in the second array for each value in the 
first so that the global correlation coefficient reaches exactly a given target
<br> The routine first sorts the two arrays, so as to get the match of maximum 
possible correlation. It then iterates, applying the random permutation 
algorithm of controlled disorder ctrper to the second array. When the resulting 
correlation goes beyond (lower than) the target correlation, one steps back and 
reduces the disorder parameter of the permutation. When the resulting 
correlation lies between the current one and the target, one replaces the array 
with the newly permuted one. When the resulting correlation increases from the 
current value, one increases the disorder parameter. That way, the target 
correlation is approached from above, by a controlled increase in randomness. 
Since full randomness leads to zero correlation, the iterations meet the 
desired coefficient at some point. It may be noted that there could be some 
cases when one would get stuck in a sort of local minimum, where local 
perturbations cannot further reduce the correlation and where global ones lead 
to overpass the target. It seems easier to restart the program with a different 
seed when this occurs than to design an avoidance scheme. Also, should a 
negative correlation be desired, the program should be modified to start with 
one array in reverse order with respect to the other, i.e. coorelation as close 
to -1 as possible.</p> </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Sorting</h2> 
<p></p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<h4>Full sorting</h4> 
<p>Subroutine INSSOR (XVALT)<br>
 Sorts XVALT into increasing order (Insertion 
sort)<br>
 This subroutine uses insertion sort. It does not use any work array 
and is faster when XVALT is of very small size (&lt; 20), or already almost 
sorted, but worst case behavior (intially inverse sorted) can easily happen. In 
most cases, the quicksort or merge sort method is faster.</p> 
<p>Subroutine REFSOR (XVALT)<br>
 Sorts XVALT into increasing order (Quick 
sort)<br>
 This version is not optimized for performance, and is thus not as 
difficult to read as some other ones. This subroutine uses quicksort in a 
recursive implementation, and insertion sort for the last steps with small 
subsets. It does not use any work array</p> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Partial sorting</h4> 
<p>Subroutine INSPAR (XVALT, NORD)<br>
 Sorts partially XVALT, bringing the 
NORD lowest values at the begining of the array.<br>
 This subroutine uses 
insertion sort, limiting insertion to the first NORD values. It does not use 
any work array and is faster when NORD is very small (2-5), but worst case 
behavior can happen fairly probably (initially inverse sorted). In many cases, 
the refined quicksort method is faster.</p> 
<p>Function FNDNTH (XVALT, NORD)<br>
 Finds out and returns the NORDth value 
in XVALT (ascending order)<br>
 This subroutine uses insertion sort, limiting 
insertion to the first NORD values, and even less when one can know that the 
value that is considered will not be the NORDth. It uses only a work array of 
size NORD and is faster when NORD is very small (2-5), but worst case behavior 
can happen fairly probably (initially inverse sorted). In many cases, the 
refined quicksort method implemented by VALNTH&nbsp;/ INDNTH is faster, though 
much more difficult to read and understand.</p> 
<p>Function VALNTH (XVALT, NORD)<br>
 Finds out and returns the NORDth value 
in XVALT (ascending order)<br>
 This subroutine simply calls INDNTH.</p> 
<p>Function VALMED (XVALT)<br>
 Finds out and returns the median 
(((Size(XVALT)+1))/2th value) of XVALT<br>
 This routine uses the recursive 
procedure described in Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 3, 5.3.3 - 
This procedure is linear in time, and does not require to be able to 
interpolate in the set as the one used in VALNTH/INDNTH. It also has better 
worst case behavior than VALNTH/INDNTH, and is about 20% faster in average for 
random uniformly distributed values.</p> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Unique sorting</h4> 
<p>Subroutine UNISTA (XVALT, NUNI)<br>
 Removes duplicates from an array<br>
 
This subroutine uses merge sort unique inverse ranking. It leaves in the 
initial set only those entries that are unique, packing the array, and leaving 
the order of the retained values unchanged.</p> </li> </ul>
