 It's 
always more fun to do this with real people (sort by height, for example). The 
London Perl Mongers tried this as a drinking game: You get enough people down 
the pub (or, in one this case, outside a bar in portugal during conference 
season) and apply booze. Then bubble sort them as a group (lots of shouting 
Stay! Switch!.) Add drinking penalties when people screw up the algorithm. You 
get the idea.

<p>One thing this seems to show me (at least the video does)<br>
the rate of 
completion - how much is sorted by each point in the process<br>
the algorithms 
seem to all do that a bit differently; some have most of the work completed in 
the beginning, some in the end.<br>
Most seem to take one piece of data and 
plunk it right in order; the merge sort seems to be the only one with 
intermediate groupings.<br>
and there's one final pass to make sure the data's 
in order.</p>

<p>The heap sort actually has intermediate structure. If you watch carefully 
you can see that it has two phases, the first much shorter than the second. 
However, the structure isn't as visibly obvious as for merge sort.</p> 
<p>If it had showed quicksort (I can't understand why it didn't) then you'd 
have seen some intermediate structure there too.</p> 
<p>I also noticed that the selection sort wasn't as good as it could be. It's 
more efficient to select the largest and the smallest unsorted values on each 
pass - you halve the number of passes, and on each pass you do 50% more work, 
so overall it's a 25% improvement.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

<p>One interesting application of such audible/visual representations could be 
for diagnostic reasons.There are numerous cases where experienced observers can 
spot patterns or anomalies in patterns that machine algorithms have trouble 
with.</p> 
<p>One example I was involved in years ago at Boeing was a tool for diagnosing 
a large switch matrix used in a piece of automated test equipment. Each output 
could be tied to a high, low or open signal, driven from a controller over an 
HPIB bus. Failure modes included not only an output stuck high, low or open, 
but address bus problems where some lines would cause passive failures or 
activate more than one pin. After watching a poor engineer go through a suspect 
matrix panel for over a day, entering a command on the bus, finding the pin on 
a patch panel, sticking a voltmeter on it, over and over a few thousand times, 
we came up with a solution. Bi-colored LEDs wired to a patch panel and a 
program to exercise the matrix with a series of address patterns. An observer 
could spot a single bad switch or a hung address bus line in a few seconds just 
by looking for an anomaly in a couple of checkerboard and other patterns.</p>
