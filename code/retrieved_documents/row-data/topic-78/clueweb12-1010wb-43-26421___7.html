<p>&ldquo;An algorithm must be seen to be believed.&rdquo;<br>

<p><em>How we ended up here</em><br>
 It all began a few days ago with an 
email from a friend (thanks Denny). I was inspired to dust off my software 
engineering cap, and review a few choice topics in computer science. What 
better way to study than to write up a blog post sampling the materials of 
interest. I accept that in the limited span of blog posts I won&rsquo;t do 
proper justice to any topic of sufficient depth, that&rsquo;s what books are 
for. Each post in the series begins with an anchor quote and takes off through 
the fundamentals of software design theory and practical implementation details 
with an emphasis on the latter. Much of my sophomoric understanding of computer 
science comes from iterative practice, reading, and communicating with folks 
much smarter than myself.</p>

<h2>Algorithms</h2> 
<p><br>
 In short, an algorithm is a recipe.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> A formula or set of steps for solving a particular problem. To be an 
algorithm, a set of rules must be unambiguous and have a clear stopping point. 
Algorithms can be expressed in any language, from natural languages like 
English or French to programming languages like FORTRAN<br>
 (source)</p> 
<p>In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (pronounced 
/&#712;&aelig;l&#609;&#601;&#633;&#618;&eth;m/ ( listen)) is an effective 
method expressed as a finite list[1] of well-defined instructions[2] for 
calculating a function[3]. Algorithms are used for calculation, data 
processing, and automated reasoning.<br>
 (source) </p> </blockquote> 
<p><b>Understanding Strategies beats Memorizing Tactics</b></p> 
<p>Algorithms are well specified techniques for performing an unbounded 
variety of tasks (good luck learning all algorithms). They are the tactics 
employed by computer scientists day in and day out, many times without even 
conscious awareness until further optimization is needed. When working on 
application specific problems at a high level, it&rsquo;s a distraction to 
constantly dive into deep operating system and compiler details.</p> 
<p>There are broad patterns common to vastly separated problem spaces. These 
strategies serve as motivations for both design and implementation of 
algorithms. Divide and conquer and greedy techniques are deployed time and time 
again within algorithms.</p> 
<p>A couple of the most famous divide and conquer techniques are the FFT and 
MapReduce (slides, web article). The FFT iteratively breaks down the Discrete 
Fourier Transform into a series of odd and even components until it get&rsquo;s 
down to a single multiply and add.</p> 
<p>I first came across map reduce while reading a set of slides by Jeff Dean, 
Designs, Lessons and Advice from Building Large Distributed Systems.<br>
<br>
 
I didn&rsquo;t give it much thought at the time, as it appeared to be a good 
framework for implementing a divide and conquer strategy. A few months later I 
hit upon MR again while reading through CouchDB&rsquo;s architecture for 
retrieving documents. It&rsquo;s no surprise sharp folks utilize similar 
strategies for very different types of problems.</p> 
<p>Greedy algorithms make locally optimally decisions, often keeping several 
potential solutions, and generate a final decision when a forcing function 
requires an estimate in finite time. One example of a greedy algorithm is an 
implementation of the Multiple Hypothesis Tracker or MHT. The MHT associates 
combinations of measurements (factorial growth), calculates likelihood scores, 
and retains a set number of associations per iteration. At each phase there is 
always a set of best tracks that it can report out, yet there is a possibility 
that the global best solution will be pruned during an iteration (heuristics 
make no guarantees). For understanding the nuances of greedy strategies I defer 
to the expert, Boss Hog.<br>
</p> 
<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2> 
<p>I blame the cruel mistress entropy for the heroic efforts needed to 
repeatedly sort unorganized data, such is nature. The methods to sort data are 
as varied as there are ways to visualize it, each algorithm and its 
implementation is crafted with an artistic touch. If you&rsquo;re looking for a 
sort to fit your problem&rsquo;s constraints, an excellent starting point is the
Wikipedia page which I quote shamelessly below. The gifs from Wikipedia display 
an animation of each algorithm in action. The gifs cycle through visualizations 
after a brief pause.<br>
</p> 
<p><em>Quicksort</em><br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> Quicksort sorts by employing a divide and conquer strategy to divide a 
list into two sub-lists.<br>
 The steps are:</p> 
<p>1)Pick an element, called a pivot, from the list.</p> 
<p>2) Reorder the list so that all elements with values less than the pivot 
come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot 
come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the 
pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation. 
Recursively sort the sub-list of lesser elements and the sub-list of greater 
elements. The base case of the recursion are lists of size zero or one, which 
never need to be sorted.</p> 
<p>Simple version</p> 
<pre> In simple pseudocode, the algorithm might be expressed as this: function 
quicksort(array) var list less, greater if length(array) &le; 1 return array // 
an array of zero or one elements is already sorted select and remove a pivot 
value pivot from array for each x in array if x &le; pivot then append x to 
less else append x to greater return concatenate(quicksort(less), pivot, 
quicksort(greater))</pre> </blockquote> 
<p>The quicksort on average requires O(n log n) comparisons and worse case 
O(n^2).</p> 
<p><em>Merge sort</em><br>
<br>
 The merge sort implements a divide and 
conquer strategy. If the size of a sublist is 0 or 1 it&rsquo;s sorted. The 
merge sort breaks up a list into two sublists of equivalent size. Each sublist 
is then merged.</p> 
<p>The following is a pseudo code example of the algorithm&rsquo;s 
implementation (source)</p> 
<pre> function merge_sort(m) if length(m) &le; 1 return m var list left, 
right, result var integer middle = length(m) / 2 for each x in m up to middle 
add x to left for each x in m after middle add x to right left = 
merge_sort(left) right = merge_sort(right) result = merge(left, right) return 
result function merge(left,right) var list result while length(left) &gt; 0 or 
length(right) &gt; 0 if length(left) &gt; 0 and length(right) &gt; 0 if 
first(left) &le; first(right) append first(left) to result left = rest(left) 
else append first(right) to result right = rest(right) else if length(left) 
&gt; 0 append first(left) to result left = rest(left) else if length(right) 
&gt; 0 append first(right) to result right = rest(right) end while return result
</pre> 
<p>The merge sort has an average and worst case performance of O(nlogn).</p> 
<p><em>Bubble sort</em><br>
(source)<br>
 The bubble sort iterates through a 
collection swapping adjacent elements into a specified order. The process 
repeats itself until no further elements are swapped. The algorithms average 
and worst case performance is O(n^2)</p> 
<p><em>Heapsort</em><br>
<br>
 The heapsort finds an extreme element (largest 
or smallest) and places it at one end of the list, continuing until the entire 
list is sorted. Theheap is a binary tree where the root node is larger than any 
of it&rsquo;s children, key(A) &gt;= key(B). The heap is also a maximally 
efficient implementation called a priority queue. The average and worst case 
performance is O(nlogn).</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> Heapsort begins by building a heap out of the data set, and then removing 
the largest item and placing it at the end of the partially sorted array. After 
removing the largest item, it reconstructs the heap, removes the largest 
remaining item, and places it in the next open position from the end of the 
partially sorted array. This is repeated until there are no items left in the 
heap and the sorted array is full. Elementary implementations require two 
arrays &ndash; one to hold the heap and the other to hold the sorted elements.
<br> (source) </p> </blockquote> 
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning another heap, the Fibonacci Heap, which 
I&rsquo;ll come back to in the tomorrow&rsquo;s post on graphs 
(Dijkstra&rsquo;s search algorithm).</p> 
<h2>Packing Problems</h2> 
<p><br>
 (source)<br>
 The image says it all about packing problems. Your goal 
is to fit as many N-dimensional structures as possible into the smallest region 
possible, and the maximum density algorithm wins. If you&rsquo;re really into 
this type of problem,Dropbox is hiring.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> Packing problems are a class of optimization problems in recreational 
mathematics which involve attempting to pack objects together (often inside a 
container), as densely as possible. Many of these problems can be related to 
real life storage and transportation issues. Each packing problem has a dual 
covering problem, which asks how many of the same objects are required to 
completely cover every region of the container, where objects are allowed to 
overlap.<br>
 In a packing problem, you are given:<br>
 
&lsquo;containers&rsquo; (usually a single two- or three-dimensional convex 
region, or an infinite space)<br>
 &lsquo;goods&rsquo; (usually a single type 
of shape), some or all of which must be packed into this container<br>
 Usually 
the packing must be without overlaps between goods and other goods or the 
container walls. The aim is to find the configuration with the maximal density. 
In some variants the overlapping (of goods with each other and/or with the 
boundary of the container) is allowed but should be minimised.<br>

<p>MD5 was considered a popular and fairly secure cryptographic hash function 
in the late 1990s, but is now known to have several predictable 
vulnerabilities. It converts a variable length input string into a 128bit 
output.SHA-1 is a more recent standard for secure cryptography but is 
susceptible to other known vulnerabilities (is nothing sacred).</p> <strong>

<p>There are a few other areas I&rsquo;d like to include, but I&rsquo;ll have 
to return and append them to the post at another time (hopefully this weekend 
time allowing). For now I&rsquo;ll leave these as placeholders as a reminder to 
myself.</p>
