<h1>Computer Algorithms: Quicksort</h1> Posted on March 13, 2012 by Stoimen

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>When it comes to sorting items by comparing them merge sort is one very 
natural approach. It is natural, because simply divides the list into two equal 
sub-lists then sort these two partitions applying the same rule. That is a 
typical divide and conquer algorithm and it just follows the intuitive approach 
of speeding up the sorting process by reducing the number of comparisons. 
However there are other &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo; sorting algorithms 
that do not follow the merge sort scheme, while they have practically the same 
success. Such an algorithm is quicksort.</p> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<p>Back in 1960 C. A. R. Hoare comes with a brilliant sorting algorithm. In 
general quicksort consists of some very simple steps. First we&rsquo;ve to 
choose an element from the list (called a pivot) then we must put all the 
elements with value less than the pivot on the left side of the pivot and all 
the items with value greater than the pivot on its right side. After that we 
must repeat these steps for the left and the right sub-lists. That is 
quicksort! Simple and elegant!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It is a pure divide and conquer approach as merge sort, but while merge 
sort&rsquo;s tricky part was merging the sorted sub-lists, in quicksort there 
are other things to consider.</p> 
<p>First of all obviously the choice of a pivot is the bottleneck. Indeed it 
all depends on that pivot. Imagine that you choose the greatest value from the 
list &ndash; than you&rsquo;ve to put all the other items of the list into the 
&ldquo;left&rdquo; sub-list. If you do that on each step you&rsquo;ll 
practically go into the worst scenario and that is no good. The thing is that 
in the worst case quicksort is not so effective and it&rsquo;s practically as 
slow as bubble sort and insertion sort. The good thing is that in practice with 
randomly generated lists there is not a high possibility to go into the worst 
case of quicksort.</p> 
<h3>Choosing a pivot</h3> 
<p>Of course the best pivot is the middle element from the list. Thus the list 
will be divided into two fairly equal sub-lists. The problem is that 
there&rsquo;s not an easy way to get the middle element from a list and this 
will slow down the algorithm. So typically we can get for a pivot the first or 
the last item of the list.</p> 
<p>After choosing a pivot the rest is simple. Put every item with a greater 
value on the right and every item with a lesser value on the left. Then we must 
sort the left and right sub-lists just as we did with the initial list.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that with this algorithm naturally we&rsquo;re going into 
a recursive solution. Typically every divide and conquer approach is easy to 
implement with recursion. But because recursion can be heavy, there is an 
iterative approach.</p> 
<h2>Implementation</h2> 
<p>As I said above recursive approach is something very natural for quicksort 
as it follows the divide and conquer principles. On each step we divide the 
list in two and we pass those sub-lists to our recursive function. But 
recursion is dangerous sometimes, so an iterative approach is also available. 
Typically iterative approaches &ldquo;model&rdquo; recursion with extra memory 
and a model of a stack, which is our case. Here we have two examples of 
quicksort &ndash; recursive and iterative in PHP. Let&rsquo;s go first with the 
recursion.</p> 
<h3>Recursive Quicksort</h3> 
<pre>$list = array(5,3,9,8,7,2,4,1,6,5); &nbsp; // recursive function quicksort
($array) { if (count($array) == 0) { return array(); } &nbsp; $pivot = $array[0]
; $left = $right = array(); &nbsp; for ($i = 1; $i &lt; count($array); $i++) { 
if ($array[$i] &lt; $pivot) { $left[] = $array[$i]; } else { $right[] = $array[
$i]; } } &nbsp; return array_merge(quicksort($left), array($pivot), quicksort(
$right)); } &nbsp; // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 print_r(quicksort($list));
</pre> 
<h3>Iterative Quicksort</h3> 
<pre>$list = array(5,3,9,8,7,2,4,1,6,5); &nbsp; // iterative function 
quicksort_iterative($array) { $stack = array($array); $sorted = array(); &nbsp; 
while (count($stack) &gt; 0) { &nbsp; $temp = array_pop($stack); &nbsp; if (
count($temp) == 1) { $sorted[] = $temp[0]; continue; } &nbsp; $pivot = $temp[0];
$left = $right = array(); &nbsp; for ($i = 1; $i &lt; count($temp); $i++) { if (
$pivot &gt; $temp[$i]) { $left[] = $temp[$i]; } else { $right[] = $temp[$i]; } }
 &nbsp;$left[] = $pivot; &nbsp; if (count($right)) array_push($stack, $right); 
if (count($left)) array_push($stack, $left); } &nbsp; return $sorted; } &nbsp; 
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 print_r(quicksort_iterative($list));</pre> 
<h2>Complexity</h2> 
<p>The complexity of quicksort in the average case is O(n*log(n)) &ndash; same 
as Merge sort. The problem is that in the worst case it is O(n2) &ndash; same 
as bubble sort. Obviously the worst case is when we have an already sorted 
list, and we constantly take for a pivot the last element of the list. But we 
should consider that in practice we don&rsquo;t quite use sorted lists that we 
have to sort again, right?</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Application</h2> 
<p>Quicksort is a great sorting algorithm and developers often go for it, but 
let&rsquo;s see some pros and cons of it.</p> 
<h3>Why using quicksort</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Recursive implementation is easy</li> 
<li>In general its speed is same as merge sort &ndash; O(n*log(n))</li> 
<li>Elegant solution with no tricky merging as merge sort</li> </ol> 
<h3>Why not using quicksort</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>As slow as bubble sort in the worst case!</li> 
<li>Iterative implementation isn&rsquo;t easy</li> 
<li>There are faster algorithms for some sets of data types</li> </ol> 
<p>Quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its principles. 
Indeed if you have two sorted lists one with items with a greater value from a 
given value and the other with items smaller form that given value you can 
simply concatenate them and you can be sure that the resulting list will be 
sorted with no need of special merge.</p> 
<p>In fact quicksort is a very elegant general purpose sorting algorithm and 
every developer should be familiar with its principles.</p>
