<h2>zsort: portable sorting algorithms in Common&nbsp;Lisp</h2> 
<p>with 6 comments</p> 
<p>zsort is a library that I started working on as a simple hobby project. 
More or less around the same time I decided to checkwhich algorithms the 
different Common Lisp implementations use. It is now part of Quicklisp so it 
can be easily used (thanksZack!). </p> 
<p>The main goal of zsort is to be a collection of portable sorting 
algorithms. If they can be fast, even better. Common lisp provides thesort and 
stable-sort functions but these can have different algorithms implemented 
according to each implementation, which can make an application unportable if 
you rely on a specific type of sorting. Also, the standard functions might not 
be the best for a certain situation and as such you might need a specialized 
sort. Even if for most situations the standard functions are more than enough, 
thezsort library could be a useful complement.</p> 
<p>Right now the implemented algorithms are: insertion sort, quicksort, 
randomized quicksort, merge sort, heapsort and counting sort. The plan is to 
add more algorithms, for example,bucket sort and timsort. However, the main 
thing on the todo list is adding the possibility ofexternal sorting (to handle 
large amounts of data) and parallel versions of some sorting algorithms. I am 
considering usinglparallel for this but I am still undecided.</p> 
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done, but I think the library as it is 
can already be a little useful. And of course, all kind of suggestions and 
improvements are welcome!</p>

<p>FYI the next release of lparallel will add support for fine-grained 
parallelism, which may simplify some algorithms.</p> 
<p> (defun fib (n)<br>
 (declare (optimize (speed 3)))<br>
 (if (&lt; n 2)<br>

 n<br>
 (let ((a (fib (- n 1))) (b (fib (- n 2))))<br>
 (+ a b))))</p> 
<p> (defpar pfib (n)<br>
 (declare (optimize (speed 3)))<br>
 (if (&lt; n 2)
<br> n<br>
 (plet ((a (pfib (- n 1))) (b (pfib (- n 2))))<br>
 (+ a b))))</p> 
<p>On my two-core machine (pfib 35) is 2x faster than (fib 35). `defpar' does 
not do any code-walking; it uses a macrolet and an alternate scheduler.</p> 
<p>If `pfib' had been defined using `defun' instead of a `defpar', the `plet' 
would cause massive slowdown due to task overhead.</p> 
<p>(I am not settled on the name `defpar' because it's too close to 
`defparameter', however I lack something better.)</p>

<p>Hi James,</p> 
<p>Thanks for your update. From your example it really looks quite easy to 
code certain algorithms. I will definitely take a closer look at lparalell. It 
is a very nice piece of work!</p> 
<p>Regarding the name, what about &ldquo;pdefun&rdquo; ? It would be more 
coherent with other names, like pmap, preduce, plet, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, the original name was `pdefun&rsquo; for the reasons you mention. 
However I found the expectation of seeing the `def&rsquo; prefix for toplevel 
definitions too great.</p> 
<p>But `defpar&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t a winner either. `defpfun&rsquo; might have 
worked if it wasn&rsquo;t so awkward.</p>

<p>Oh, I see! What about `defparallel&rsquo;? IMHO, it&rsquo;s nicer than 
`defpar&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s not that longer.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of `defparallel&rsquo; is that it is notoriously easy to 
fumble typing `parallel&rsquo;, as you did in your first comment. I also wanted 
to keep the length short in order to preserve indentation when switching 
to/from `defun&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>But I don&rsquo;t have strong opinions on it; pdefun, defpar, defparallel 
seem about equally good and equally bad.</p>

<p>Yes, you&rsquo;re right. Anyway, I look forward for the new release!</p>
