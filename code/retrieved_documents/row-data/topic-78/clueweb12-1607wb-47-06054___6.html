<h1>Project 1: QuickSort</h1> 
<p> The goal of this project is reinforce the work on sorting arrays by 
implementing the quicksort algorithm and to conduct a careful emperical study 
of the relative performace of sorting algorithms.</p> 
<h2> 1. Introduction</h2> 
<p>Recall the difference between insertion and selection sorts. Although they 
share the same basic pattern (repeatedly move an element from the unsorted 
section to the sorted section), we have</p> 
<p>Insertion </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Take the next unsorted item (easy) </li> 
<li>put it in the right place (hard) </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Selection </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Take the smallest unsorted item (hard) </li> 
<li>put it in the next place (easy) </li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now, consider the basic pattern of merge sort:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>split </li> 
<li>sort the pieces recursively </li> 
<li>reunite </li> </ul> 
<p>More specifically, merge sort splits the array simplistically (it's the 
&quot;easy&quot; part). The reuniting is complicated. What if there were a 
sorting algorithm that had the same basic pattern as merge sort, but stood in 
analogy to merge sort as selection stands towards insertion? In other words, 
could there be a recursive, divide-and-conquer, sorting algorithm for which the
<i>splitting</i> is the hard part, but leaves an easy or trivial <i>reuniting
</i> at the end?</p> 
<p>To design such an algorithm, let's take another look at what merge sort 
does. Since the splitting is trivial, the interesting parts are the recursive 
sorting and the reuniting. The recursive call sorts the subarrays<i>internally
</i>, that is, each subarray is turned into a sorted subarray. The reuniting 
sorts the subarrays<i>with respect to each other</i>, that is, it moves 
elements between subarrays, so the entire range is sorted.</p> 
<p>To rephrase our earlier question, the analogue to mergesort would be an 
algorithm that sorts the subarrays with respect to each other<i>before</i> 
sorting each subarray. Then reuniting them is trivial. The algorithm is called 
&quot;quicksort,&quot; and as its name suggests, it is a very good sorting 
algorithm.</p> 
<p>Here's a big picture view of it. Suppose we have an array, as pictured 
below. We pick one element,<i>x</i>, and delegate it as the &quot;pivot.&quot; 
In many formulations of array-based quicksort, the last element is used as the 
pivot (though it doesn't need to be the last).</p> 
<p> Then we separate the other elements based on whether they are greater than 
or less than the pivot, placing the pivot in the middle.</p> 
<p>In a closer look, while we do this partitioning of the array, we maintain 
three portions of the array: the (processed) elements that are less than the 
pivot, the (processed) elements that are greater than the pivot, and the 
unprocessed elements. (In a way, the pivot itself constitutes a fourth 
portion.) The indices<i>i</i> and <i>j</i> mark the boundaries between portions:
<i>i</i> is the last position of the portion less than the pivot and <i>j</i> 
is the first position in the unprocessed portion. Initially, the &quot;less 
than&quot; and &quot;greater than&quot; portions are empty.</p> 
<p>During each step in the partitioning, the element at position <i>j</i> is 
examined. It is either brought into the &quot;greater than&quot; portion 
(simply by incrementing<i>j</i>) or brought into the &quot;less than&quot; 
portion (by doing a swap and incrementing both<i>i</i> and <i>j</i>).</p> 
<p>(Think about that very carefully; it's the core and most difficult part of 
this project.)</p> 
<p>At the end, the unprocessed portion is empty.</p> 
<p>All that's left is to move the pivot in between the two portions, using a 
swap. We're then set to do the recursive calls on each portion.</p> 
<h2>2. Setup</h2> 
<p>Make a directory for this class (if you haven't already). Make a new 
directory for this project. Then copy into it some starter code, which will be 
similar to the code you started with in lab.</p> 
<p></p> 
<pre> cd 245 mkdir proj1 cd proj1 cp /homes/tvandrun/Public/cs245/proj1/* . 
</pre> 
<h2>3. Implementing quicksort</h2> 
<p> Notice there are two functions with <code>quickSort</code> in their name. 
The second function corresponds to the prototype for quick sort found in<code>
sorts.h</code> and used in the driver <code>sDriver.c</code> It is finished. It 
starts the recursive process by calling<code>quickSortR()</code>, which is the 
one you need to finish.</p> 
<p>Notice that <code>quickSortR()</code> takes not only an array but also a 
starting point and a stopping point in the array. It is only sorting a given 
range in the array. Both functions return an int to be consistent with the 
other functions, all of which return the number of comparisons.</p> 
<h2>4. Experiments</h2> 
<p>As we have been talking about in class, merge sort and quick sort are in 
different &quot;complexity classes&quot; in terms of the their worst case 
performance. Merge sort is<i>O</i>(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>), whereas quicksort is 
<i>O</i>(<i>n</i>^2). (<i>O</i>(<i>n</i> lg <i>n</i>) is faster). However, 
these are worst cases; we might find that experimentally one of the algorithms 
may behave better on average.</p> 
<p>Write a program or programs to automate experiments to compare the running 
time and<i>number of comparisons</i> for quicksort, mergesort, shell sort, and 
one of the other sorts (selection, insertion, or one of the bubbles)</p> 
<p>This time, instead of counting comparisons, we'll take actual time 
measurements.<code>arrayUtil</code> has a function <code>getTimeMillis()</code>
. It returns the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since midnight, Jan 
1, 1970---the standard way to do time keeping on many computer platforms. By 
calling this function before and after sorting and taking the difference, we 
can compute how long it takes to sort.</p> 
<p> Use several different arrays of several sizes, and compare the results for 
the different algorithms.</p> 
<h2>6. To turn in</h2> 
<p>Write a few paragraphs explaining how you did your experiment and what your 
findings are. Present your data using a table and one or more graphs.</p> 
<p>Turn in your code, results, and write-up by copying them to a turnin 
directory I have prepared for you. Please turn in an entire directory. For 
example, if you make a directory called<code>proj1-turnin</code> containing all 
the files you want to turn in, then copy this using</p> 
<pre> cp -r proj1-turnin /cslab.all/ubuntu/cs245/turnin/(your user id) </pre>
