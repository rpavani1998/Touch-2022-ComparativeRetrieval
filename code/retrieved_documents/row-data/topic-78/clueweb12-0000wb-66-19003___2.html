<h3>External Sorting</h3> <br>
<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3> <br>
 External sorting refers to the sorting of a file 
that is on disk (or tape). Internal sorting refers to the sorting of an array 
of data that is in RAM. The main concern with external sorting is to minimize 
disk access since reading a disk block takes about a million times longer than 
accessing an item in RAM (according to Shaffer -- see the reference at the end 
of this document).
<p> Perhaps the simplest form of external sorting is to use a fast internal 
sort with good<strong>locality of reference</strong> (which means that it tends 
to reference nearby items, not widely scattered items) and hope that your 
operating system's virtual memory can handle it. (Quicksort is one sort 
algorithm that is generally very fast and has good locality of reference.) If 
the file is too huge, however, even virtual memory might be unable to fit it. 
Also, the performance may not be too great due to the large amount of time it 
takes to access data on disk.</p> 
<h3>Methods</h3> <br>
 Most external sort routines are based on mergesort. 
They typically break a large data file into a number of shorter, sorted<strong>
runs</strong>. These can be produced by repeatedly reading a section of the 
data file into RAM, sorting it with ordinary quicksort, and writing the sorted 
data to disk. After the sorted runs have been generated, a merge algorithm is 
used to combine sorted files into longer sorted files. The simplest scheme is 
to use a 2-way merge: merge 2 sorted files into one sorted file, then merge 2 
more, and so on until there is just one large sorted file. A better scheme is a 
multiway merge algorithm: it might merge perhaps 128 shorter runs together.<br>

<br> 
<h3>Analysis</h3> <br>
 According to Shaffer, a multiway merge using half a 
megabyte of RAM and a disk block size of 4 KB could hold 128 disk blocks in RAM 
at once. This would allow 128 runs to be merged together in one pass. The 
average initial run size would be 1 MB. (See Shaffer on how that can be 
obtained with only 1/2 MB of RAM.) A file of size 128 MB could be sorted in 2 
passes (one to build the initial runs and one to merge them). A file of size 16 
gigabytes could be sorted in just 3 passes.
<p> Note that you do not want to jump back and forth between 2 or more files 
in trying to merge them (while writing to a third file). This would likely 
produce a lot of time-consuming disk seeks. Instead, on a single-user PC, it is 
better to read a block of each of the 2 (or more) files into RAM and carry out 
the merge algorithm there, with the output also kept in a buffer in RAM until 
the buffer is filled (or we are out of data) and only then writing it out to 
disk. When the merge algorithm exhausts one of the blocks of data, refill it by 
reading from disk another block of the associated file. This is called<strong>
buffering</strong>. On a larger machine where the disk drive is being shared 
among many users, it may not make sense to worry about this as the read/write 
head is going to be seeking all over the place anyway.</p> 
<h3>Practical Data</h3> <br>
 Shaffer presents the following practical data 
concerning external sorting. In this experiment a 4 MB file was sorted on a 
particular computer. A simple mergesort that did<em>not</em> build initial 
sorted runs took 451 seconds. A 2-way mergesort that used initial runs of 128 
KB took only 160 seconds. A multiway mergesort that used the same initial runs 
took only 103 seconds. Clearly, using initial sorted runs dramatically speeds 
up the sorting.<br>
<br>

<h3>Example Program</h3> <br>
 The ideas behind an external sort seem simple 
enough, but implementing a working program is fairly complex. The following 
example attempts to show the main features used in most any external sort: 
producing sorted initial runs, the merging of sorted runs, and the buffering of 
data. However, the design used is simpler than that which is most likely used 
in a real-world external sort. A key place where this is true is that the 
example program merges only 2 sorted files at a time; it does not attempt to do 
a multiway merge (such as the 128-way merge mentioned above). The program also 
uses buffers of size 64 KB, which is no doubt smaller than necessary. 
Performance would probably be better with larger buffers. The buffers were kept 
small so that the merge portion of the algorithm could be observed without 
needing a huge test file. Note that when the program is creating a sorted run, 
it uses a single 64 KB buffer, but when it is merging a couple of sorted runs, 
it uses three 64 KB buffers. A more likely scenario in a good external sort is 
that the same amount of memory is used in both cases, no matter how many 
buffers exist in each case. Buffers all of the same size were used to keep the 
example simpler.

<li>extsort.h</li> 
<li>extsort.cpp</li> </ul> <br>
<br>
 The example program does a 
case-insensitive sort of the text file that the user supplies when prompted by 
the program. It is assumed that each line of the file contains a word and is no 
more than 31 characters in length. No attempt is made to order in any way words 
that are identical except for capitalization. (For example, there is no 
guarantee what order the sort will place the words MacIntosh and Macintosh 
since they are seen as identical. Duplicate words such as these are kept in the 
file.) The output data is placed back under the original file name.
<p> The <code>MakeSortedRuns</code> function copies into a buffer a chunk of 
data from the file being sorted. This buffer is then sorted in main memory by 
using quicksort. The sorted data is written out to a temporary file. The 
temporary files for these sorted runs are placed in the current directory in 
files named ExtSortTemp.0, ExtSortTemp.1, etc.</p> 
<p> The <code>HandleMerges</code> function has the job of merging all of these 
sorted runs, two at a time, until all of the data is merged back under the 
original file name. Other than the special cases, the typical pattern used is 
to merge ExtSortTemp.0 and ExtSortTemp.1 into ExtSortTempA.0, then the next 2 
sorted runs are merged into ExtSortTempA.1, etc. Next we merge the files with 
the A in their names into ExtSortTemp files. We also merge the top-numbered 
pair of ExtSortTempA files first, placing the merged data into a file named 
ExtSortTemp.0, then we merge the next pair of ExtSortTempA files into a file 
named ExtSortTemp.1, etc. The reason to take the higher-numbered files first 
this time is that the highest numbered sorted run may be a short remnant that 
was left over because we had an odd number of runs. That remnant was simply 
renamed instead of being merged with another file. By now taking the 
highest-numbered run first, we merge that short remnant with another run.</p> 
<p> Note that the header file has a symbol DEBUG that can be defined if you 
want to see debugging output. Comment this line off if you do not want this 
information to appear on the screen. Shown below are the debugging messages 
produced when sorting a modified copy of the linux.words file. (This file had a 
couple of extra words added. Also, since the words were already in order, the 
file was sorted, with the Linux sort command, starting at the third character 
of each line. This scrambled the order of the words, giving appropriate test 
data for the external sort program.) Note that the test data file contained 
45429 words, one per line.</p>

<br>

<p> The above output shows that the promised pattern of merges was indeed used 
by the external sort program. Note that when the number of sorted runs is odd, 
the remaining file is simply renamed. The final merge shows that when only 2 
sorted runs remain, they are merged back into the original file.</p> 
<p> Those who are interested might want to try modifying the example program 
to use a multiway merge and possibly the &quot;replacement selection&quot; 
algorithm discussed in Shaffer's text. See the references below for more 
information.</p>
