<h2>Administrivia</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> I have decided not to assign another homework before break since most of 
you will be working hard on homeworks, essays, and such for your other classes.
</li> 
<li> Those of you who want more programming to do please come and see me. </li>
<li> I wasn't able to get your homeworks graded because I was spending time 
developing today's lab.</li> 
<li> For part of today's class, we'll work on lab 9, which focuses on the 
quicksort algorithm.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Short lab: Quicksort</h2> 
<p> Work on lab 9 for approximately twenty minutes to improve your 
understanding of the operation of quicksort.</p> 
<h2>Faster Sorting Methods</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> We've seen a number of sorting routines. 
<ul> 
<li> Some are O(n*n) </li> 
<li> One (merge sort) is O(n*log_2(n)), but requires significantly extra space.
</li> 
<li> One (quicksort) is expected O(n*log_2(n)), but can behave significantly 
worse.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li> Can we do better than O(n*log_2(n))? </li> 
<li> It depends on our basic operations. </li> 
<li> If you are restricted to compare and swap, it turns out that you can't do 
better than n*log_2(n) steps. Why not? A careful analysis will show you that if 
you use fewer steps, you won't have been able to compare each element to every 
other element (directly or indirectly). If there are two elements that were 
never compared, they may not be in the correct place.</li> 
<li> So, can we throw away our comparisons of elements and swaps? </li> 
<li> (Yes, but it doesn't seem to be covered in Bailey.) </li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Silly Sort</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Here is an interesting sorting algorithm that relies on limitations to 
the input to ensure quicker sorting.
<pre> /** * Sort an array containing the values 1 ... n. * pre: The array is 
of size n. * pre: Each value between 1 and n appears exactly once in the * 
array * post: The array contains the same elements and they're sorted. */ 
public sillySort(int[] stuff) { for (int value = 1; value &lt;= this.size(); 
++value) { stuff[value-1] = value; } / for } // sillySort</pre> </li> 
<li> What is the running time of this algorithm? </li> 
<li> Why is this an unsatisfying algorithm? </li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Bucket Sort</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> If we know that the elements in our array are in a restricted range, we 
can do a sort that array without comparing and swapping, if we're willing to 
use some extra space.</li> 
<li> In <strong>bucket sort</strong>, we build a set of buckets that 
correspond to the range of elements. We then step through our array, copying or 
moving each element to the appropriate bucket. When we're done copying 
elements, we can simply pull them out of the buckets in order (since the 
buckets are ordered).</li> 
<li> What is the running time? O(n+m), where n is the number of elements and m 
is the number of buckets.</li> 
<li> What is the extra space requirement? O(m). </li> 
<li> A simple variation is to have bigger buckets, and recursively sort each 
bucket. This can save some space, but may then require extra time. (In the 
extreme case, we only use two buckets in each sort or subsort, giving us 
something close to quick sort.)</li> 
<li> One implementation question that arises is how to implement the buckets, 
given that the same bucket may hold multiple elements. We'll leave that 
question to the future.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Radix Sort</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> If each object to be sorted can be represented as a sequence of values 
(e.g., a sequence of digits in a decimal number, a sequence of characters in 
words, a sequence of bits in the binary representation of the object) and 
sorting can be based on that sequence, then it is possible to sort based on 
those sequences.</li> 
<li> In <strong>radix sort</strong>, one repeatedly partitions the objects 
based on one of the elements of the sequence, moving from least significant to 
most significant element of the sequence. After each partition, we glue the 
partitions back together, smallest to largest.</li> 
<li> Each partitioning must maintain the previous partitioning within each new 
partition. E.g., if a precedes b after the first partitioning, and a and b end 
up in the same group in the second partitioning, then a must precede b in its 
group.</li> 
<li> Most often, we simply use bits for the partitioning, as these are easiest 
to check and use.</li> 
<li> In psuedo-Java, for the boolean case 
<pre> public static void radixSort() { radixSort(v,0); } // radixSort /** * 
Radix sort the vector, starting with the bth-least significant * bit. * pre: 0 
&lt;= b &lt; # of places in the sequence representation of * the data type * 
pre: this vector has been radix sorted for all 0 &lt;= i &lt; p * post: this 
vector is radix sorted */ public static void radixSort(place p) { // Base case, 
we've run out of bits if (p == PLACES_IN_ELEMENT) return; // Recursive case, 
partition and move on to the next bit splitAndJoin(b); return radixSort(b+1); } 
// radixSort /** * Split the elements at the pth position * pre: 0 &lt;= b &lt; 
# of places in the sequence representation of * the data type * post: For all 
i, the pth place in v[i] &lt;= the pth place in v[i+1] **/ public static void 
splitAndJoin(int p) { // Create the set of buckets Vector[] buckets = new 
Vector[POSSIBLE_PLACE_VALUES]; for(int i = 0; i &lt; POSSIBLE_PLACE_VALUES; 
++i) buckets[i] = new Vector(); // Paritition the vector for(int i = 0; i &lt; 
size(); ++i) { buckets[elementAt(i).placeValue(p)].addElement(elementAt(i)); } 
// Put 'em back together setLength(0); for(int i = 0; i &lt; 
POSSIBLE_PLACE_VALUES; ++i) { addElements(buckets[i]); } } // splitAndJoin</pre>
</li> 
<li> What's the running time? Well, there are O(l) rounds, where l is the 
number of positions in the sequences. In each round, we spend O(n) time taking 
stuff out of the vector (assuming that we can append to each bucket in constant 
time) and O(m+n) time putting stuff back into the vector. That gives an overall 
running time of O(l*(m+n)).</li> 
<li> However, we can often call l and m constants (e.g., for integers, l is 
always 32 and m is always 2), so that's a running time of O(n).</li> 
<li> Space usage is O(n+m), for the temporary buckets. </li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Other sorting algorithms</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> As we learn some more data structures, we'll also learn some more sorting 
methods that depend on those data structures. One to look forward to is<em>heap 
sort</em>. </li> </ul>
