<h2>NAME</h2> 
<pre> perl58delta - what is new for perl v5.8.0 </pre> 
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> 
<pre> This document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and the 
5.8.0 release. Many of the bug fixes in 5.8.0 were already seen in the 5.6.1 
mainte- nance release since the two releases were kept closely coordinated 
(while 5.8.0 was still called 5.7.something). Changes that were integrated into 
the 5.6.1 release are marked &quot;[561]&quot;. Many of these changes have been 
further developed since 5.6.1 was released, those are marked 
&quot;[561+]&quot;. You can see the list of changes in the 5.6.1 release (both 
from the 5.005_03 release and the 5.6.0 release) by reading perl561delta.</pre> 
<h2>Highlights In 5.8.0</h2> 
<pre> &middot; Better Unicode support &middot; New IO Implementation &middot; 
New Thread Implementation &middot; Better Numeric Accuracy &middot; Safe 
Signals &middot; Many New Modules &middot; More Extensive Regression Testing
</pre> 
<h2>Incompatible Changes</h2> 
<pre> <b>Binary</b> <b>Incompatibility</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>5.8</b> <b>is</b> <b>
not</b> <b>binary</b> <b>compatible</b> <b>with</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>releases
</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>recompile</b> 
<b>your</b> <b>XS</b> <b>modules.</b> (Pure Perl modules should continue to 
work.) The major reason for the discontinuity is the new IO architecture called 
PerlIO. PerlIO is the default configuration because without it many new 
features of Perl 5.8 cannot be used. In other words: you just have to recompile 
your modules containing XS code, sorry about that. In future releases of Perl, 
non-PerlIO aware XS modules may become com- pletely unsupported. This 
shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult for module authors, however: PerlIO has been 
designed as a drop-in replacement (at the source code level) for the stdio 
interface. Depending on your platform, there are also other reasons why we 
decided to break binary compatibility, please read on.<b>64-bit</b> <b>platforms
</b> <b>and</b> <b>malloc</b> If your pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl 
malloc is no longer being used because it does not work well with 8-byte 
pointers. Also, usually the system mallocs on such platforms are much better 
optimized for such large memory models than the Perl malloc. Some memory-hungry 
Perl applications like the PDL don&rsquo;t work well with Perl&rsquo;s malloc. 
Finally, other applications than Perl (such as mod_perl) tend to prefer the 
sys- tem malloc. Such platforms include Alpha and 64-bit HPPA, MIPS, PPC, and 
Sparc.<b>AIX</b> <b>Dynaloading</b> The AIX dynaloading now uses in AIX 
releases 4.3 and newer the native dlopen interface of AIX instead of the old 
emulated interface. This change will probably break backward compatibility with 
compiled mod- ules. The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other 
applications like mod_perl which are using the AIX native interface.<b>
Attributes</b> <b>for</b> <b>&quot;my&quot;</b> <b>variables</b> <b>now</b> <b>
handled</b> <b>at</b> <b>run-time</b> The &quot;my EXPR : ATTRS&quot; syntax 
now applies variable attributes at run-time. (Subroutine and &quot;our&quot; 
variables still get attributes applied at compile-time.) See attributes for 
additional details. In particu- lar, however, this allows variable attributes 
to be useful for &quot;tie&quot; interfaces, which was a deficiency of earlier 
releases. Note that the new semantics doesn&rsquo;t work with the 
Attribute::Handlers module (as of version 0.76).<b>Socket</b> <b>Extension</b> 
<b>Dynamic</b> <b>in</b> <b>VMS</b> The Socket extension is now dynamically 
loaded instead of being stati- cally built in. This may or may not be a problem 
with ancient TCP/IP stacks of VMS: we do not know since we weren&rsquo;t able 
to test Perl in such configurations.<b>IEEE-format</b> <b>Floating</b> <b>Point
</b> <b>Default</b> <b>on</b> <b>OpenVMS</b> <b>Alpha</b> Perl now uses IEEE 
format (T_FLOAT) as the default internal floating point format on OpenVMS 
Alpha, potentially breaking binary compatibil- ity with external libraries or 
existing data. G_FLOAT is still avail- able as a configuration option. The 
default on VAX (D_FLOAT) has not changed.<b>New</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>Semantics
</b> <b>(no</b> <b>more</b> <b>&quot;use</b> <b>utf8&quot;,</b> <b>almost)</b> 
Previously in Perl 5.6 to use Unicode one would say &quot;use utf8&quot; and 
then the operations (like string concatenation) were Unicode-aware in that 
lexical scope. This was found to be an inconvenient interface, and in Perl 5.8 
the Unicode model has completely changed: now the &quot;Unicodeness&quot; is 
bound to the data itself, and for most of the time &quot;use utf8&quot; is not 
needed at all. The only remaining use of &quot;use utf8&quot; is when the Perl 
script itself has been written in the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode. (UTF-8 has not 
been made the default since there are many Perl scripts out there that are 
using various national eight-bit character sets, which would be illegal in 
UTF-8.) See perluniintro for the explanation of the current model, and utf8 for 
the current use of the utf8 pragma.<b>New</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>Properties</b> 
Unicode<i>scripts</i> are now supported. Scripts are similar to (and superior 
to) Unicode<i>blocks</i>. The difference between scripts and blocks is that 
scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages, while the 
blocks are more artificial groupings of (mostly) 256 charac- ters based on the 
Unicode numbering. In general, scripts are more inclusive, but not universally 
so. For example, while the script &quot;Latin&quot; includes all the Latin 
characters and their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include 
the various punctuation or digits (since they are not solely 
&quot;Latin&quot;). A number of other properties are now supported, including 
&quot;\p{L&amp;}&quot;, &quot;\p{Any}&quot; &quot;\p{Assigned}&quot;, 
&quot;\p{Unassigned}&quot;, &quot;\p{Blank}&quot; [561] and 
&quot;\p{SpacePerl}&quot; [561] (along with their &quot;\P{...}&quot; versions, 
of course). See perlunicode for details, and more additions. The &quot;In&quot; 
or &quot;Is&quot; prefix to names used with the &quot;\p{...}&quot; and 
&quot;\P{...}&quot; are now almost always optional. The only exception is that 
a &quot;In&quot; pre- fix is required to signify a Unicode block when a block 
name conflicts with a script name. For example, &quot;\p{Tibetan}&quot; refers 
to the script, while &quot;\p{InTibetan}&quot; refers to the block. When there 
is no name con- flict, you can omit the &quot;In&quot; from the block name 
(e.g. &quot;\p{BraillePat- terns}&quot;), but to be safe, it&rsquo;s probably 
best to always use the &quot;In&quot;).<b>REF(...)</b> <b>Instead</b> <b>Of</b> 
<b>SCALAR(...)</b> A reference to a reference now stringifies as 
&quot;REF(0x81485ec)&quot; instead of &quot;SCALAR(0x81485ec)&quot; in order to 
be more consistent with the return value of<i>ref()</i>. <b>pack/unpack</b> <b>
D/F</b> <b>recycled</b> The undocumented pack/unpack template letters D/F have 
been recycled for better use: now they stand for long double (if supported by 
the platform) and NV (Perl internal floating point type). (They used to be 
aliases for d/f, but you never knew that.)<i>glob()</i> <b>now</b> <b>returns
</b> <b>filenames</b> <b>in</b> <b>alphabetical</b> <b>order</b> The list of 
filenames from<i>glob()</i> (or &lt;...&gt;) is now by default sorted 
alphabetically to be csh-compliant (which is what happened before in most UNIX 
platforms). (<i>bsd</i><b>_</b><i>glob()</i> does still sort platform natively, 
ASCII or EBCDIC, unless GLOB_ALPHASORT is specified.) [561]<b>Deprecations</b> 
&middot; The semantics of bless(REF, REF) were unclear and until someone proves 
it to make some sense, it is forbidden. &middot; The obsolete chat2 library 
that should never have been allowed to escape the laboratory has been 
decommissioned. &middot; Using chdir(&quot;&quot;) or chdir(undef) instead of 
explicit<i>chdir()</i> is doubtful. A failure (think chdir(<i>some</i><b>_</b>
<i>function()</i>) can lead into unintended <i>chdir()</i> to the home 
directory, therefore this behaviour is deprecated. &middot; The builtin<i>dump()
</i> function has probably outlived most of its use- fulness. The core-dumping 
functionality will remain in future available as an explicit call to 
&quot;CORE::dump()&quot;, but in future releases the behaviour of an 
unqualified &quot;dump()&quot; call may change. &middot; The very dusty 
examples in the eg/ directory have been removed. Suggestions for new shiny 
examples welcome but the main issue is that the examples need to be documented, 
tested and (most impor- tantly) maintained. &middot; The (bogus) escape 
sequences \8 and \9 now give an optional warning (&quot;Unrecognized escape 
passed through&quot;). There is no need to \-escape any &quot;\w&quot; 
character. &middot; The *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated, use *glob{IO} instead. 
&middot; The &quot;package;&quot; syntax (&quot;package&quot; without an 
argument) has been dep- recated. Its semantics were never that clear and its 
implementation even less so. If you have used that feature to dis- allow all 
but fully qualified variables, &quot;use strict;&quot; instead. &middot; The 
unimplemented POSIX regex features [[.cc.]] and [[=c=]] are still recognised 
but now cause fatal errors. The previous behaviour of ignoring them by default 
and warning if requested was unacceptable since it, in a way, falsely promised 
that the features could be used. &middot; In future releases, non-PerlIO aware 
XS modules may become com- pletely unsupported. Since PerlIO is a drop-in 
replacement for stdio at the source code level, this shouldn&rsquo;t be that 
drastic a change. &middot; Previous versions of perl and some readings of some 
sections of Camel III implied that the &quot;:raw&quot; &quot;discipline&quot; 
was the inverse of &quot;:crlf&quot;. Turning off &quot;clrfness&quot; is no 
longer enough to make a stream truly binary. So the PerlIO &quot;:raw&quot; 
layer (or &quot;discipline&quot;, to use the Camel book&rsquo;s older 
terminology) is now formally defined as being equivalent to binmode(FH) - which 
is in turn defined as doing whatever is necessary to pass each byte as-is 
without any translation. In particular binmode(FH) - and hence &quot;:raw&quot; 
- will now turn off both CRLF and UTF-8 translation and remove other lay- ers 
(e.g. :<i>encoding()</i>) which would modify byte stream. &middot; The current 
user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird use of the first array 
element) is deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl 
5.10.0, and the feature will be implemented differently. Not only is the 
current interface rather ugly, but the current implementation slows down normal 
array and hash use quite noticeably. The &quot;fields&quot; pragma interface 
will remain available. The<i>restricted</i> <i>hashes</i> interface is expected 
to be the replacement interface (see Hash::Util). If your existing programs 
depends on the underlying implementation, consider using Class::PseudoHash from 
CPAN. &middot; The syntaxes &quot;@a-&gt;[...]&quot; and 
&quot;%h-&gt;{...}&quot; have now been deprecated. &middot; After years of 
trying, suidperl is considered to be too complex to ever be considered truly 
secure. The suidperl functionality is likely to be removed in a future release. 
&middot; The 5.005 threads model (module &quot;Thread&quot;) is deprecated and 
expected to be removed in Perl 5.10. Multithreaded code should be migrated to 
the new ithreads model (see threads, threads::shared and perlthrtut). &middot; 
The long deprecated uppercase aliases for the string comparison operators (EQ, 
NE, LT, LE, GE, GT) have now been removed. &middot; The tr///C and tr///U 
features have been removed and will not return; the interface was a mistake. 
Sorry about that. For simi- lar functionality, see pack(&rsquo;U0&rsquo;, ...) 
and pack(&rsquo;C0&rsquo;, ...). [561] &middot; Earlier Perls treated &quot;sub 
foo (@bar)&quot; as equivalent to &quot;sub foo (@)&quot;. The prototypes are 
now checked better at compile-time for invalid syntax. An optional warning is 
generated (&quot;Illegal charac- ter in prototype...&quot;) but this may be 
upgraded to a fatal error in a future release. &middot; The &quot;exec 
LIST&quot; and &quot;system LIST&quot; operations now produce warnings on 
tainted data and in some future release they will produce fatal errors. 
&middot; The existing behaviour when localising tied arrays and hashes is 
wrong, and will be changed in a future release, so do not rely on the existing 
behaviour. See &quot;Localising Tied Arrays and Hashes Is Broken&quot;.</pre> 
<h2>Core Enhancements</h2> 
<pre> <b>Unicode</b> <b>Overhaul</b> Unicode in general should be now much 
more usable than in Perl 5.6.0 (or even in 5.6.1). Unicode can be used in hash 
keys, Unicode in regu- lar expressions should work now, Unicode in tr/// should 
work now, Uni- code in I/O should work now. See perluniintro for introduction 
and perlunicode for details. &middot; The Unicode Character Database coming 
with Perl has been upgraded to Unicode 3.2.0. For more information, see 
http://www.uni- code.org/ . [561+] (5.6.1 has UCD 3.0.1.) &middot; For 
developers interested in enhancing Perl&rsquo;s Unicode capabilities: almost 
all the UCD files are included with the Perl distribution in the<i>lib/unicore
</i> subdirectory. The most notable omission, for space considerations, is the 
Unihan database. &middot; The properties \p{Blank} and \p{SpacePerl} have been 
added. &quot;Blank&quot; is like C<i>isblank()</i>, that is, it contains only 
&quot;horizontal whites- pace&quot; (the space character is, the newline 
isn&rsquo;t), and the &quot;SpacePerl&quot; is the Unicode equivalent of 
&quot;\s&quot; (\p{Space} isn&rsquo;t, since that includes the vertical 
tabulator character, whereas &quot;\s&quot; doesn&rsquo;t.) See &quot;New 
Unicode Properties&quot; earlier in this document for addi- tional information 
on changes with Unicode properties.<b>PerlIO</b> <b>is</b> <b>Now</b> <b>The</b>
<b>Default</b> &middot; IO is now by default done via PerlIO rather than 
system&rsquo;s &quot;stdio&quot;. PerlIO allows &quot;layers&quot; to be 
&quot;pushed&quot; onto a file handle to alter the handle&rsquo;s behaviour. 
Layers can be specified at open time via 3-arg form of open: 
open($fh,&rsquo;&gt;:crlf :utf8&rsquo;, $path) 
&acirc;&#148;&#130;&acirc;&#148;&#130; ... or on already opened handles via 
extended &quot;binmode&quot;: binmode($fh,&rsquo;:encoding(iso-8859-7)&rsquo;); 
The built-in layers are: unix (low level read/write), stdio (as in previous 
Perls), perlio (re-implementation of stdio buffering in a portable manner), 
crlf (does CRLF &lt;=&gt; &quot;\n&quot; translation as on Win32, but available 
on any platform). A mmap layer may be available if platform supports it (mostly 
UNIXes). Layers to be applied by default may be specified via the 
&rsquo;open&rsquo; pragma. See &quot;Installation and Configuration 
Improvements&quot; for the effects of PerlIO on your architecture name. 
&middot; If your platform supports<i>fork()</i>, you can use the list form of 
&quot;open&quot; for pipes. For example: open KID_PS, 
&quot;-&acirc;&#148;&#130;&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;aux&quot; or die $!; 
forks the<b>ps(1)</b> command (without spawning a shell, as there are more than 
three arguments to<i>open()</i>), and reads its standard output via the 
&quot;KID_PS&quot; filehandle. See perlipc. &middot; File handles can be marked 
as accepting Perl&rsquo;s internal encoding of Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-EBCDIC 
depending on platform) by a pseudo layer &quot;:utf8&quot; : 
open($fh,&quot;&gt;:utf8&quot;,&quot;Uni.txt&quot;); Note for EBCDIC users: the 
pseudo layer &quot;:utf8&quot; is erroneously named for you since it&rsquo;s 
not UTF-8 what you will be getting but instead UTF-EBCDIC. See perlunicode, 
utf8, and http://www.uni- code.org/unicode/reports/tr16/ for more information. 
In future releases this naming may change. See perluniintro for more infor- 
mation about UTF-8. &middot; If your environment variables (LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, 
LANG) look like you want to use UTF-8 (any of the the variables match 
&quot;/utf-?8/i&quot;), your STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR handles and the default open 
layer (see open) are marked as UTF-8. (This feature, like other new features 
that combine Unicode and I/O, work only if you are using PerlIO, but 
that&rsquo;s the default.) Note that after this Perl really does assume that 
everything is UTF-8: for example if some input handle is not, Perl will 
probably very soon complain about the input data like this &quot;Malformed 
UTF-8 ...&quot; since any old eight-bit data is not legal UTF-8. Note for code 
authors: if you want to enable your users to use UTF-8 as their default 
encoding but in your code still have eight- bit I/O streams (such as images or 
zip files), you need to explic- itly<i>open()</i> or <i>binmode()</i> with 
&quot;:bytes&quot; (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;binmode&quot; in 
perlfunc), or you can just use &quot;binmode(FH)&quot; (nice for pre-5.8.0 
backward compatibility). &middot; File handles can translate character 
encodings from/to Perl&rsquo;s internal Unicode form on read/write via the 
&quot;:<i>encoding()</i>&quot; layer. &middot; File handles can be opened to 
&quot;in memory&quot; files held in Perl scalars via: 
open($fh,&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;, \$variable) &acirc;&#148;&#130;&acirc;&#148;&#130; 
... &middot; Anonymous temporary files are available without need to &rsquo;use 
File- Handle&rsquo; or other module via open($fh,&quot;+&gt;&quot;, undef) 
&acirc;&#148;&#130;&acirc;&#148;&#130; ... That is a literal undef, not an 
undefined value.<b>ithreads</b> The new interpreter threads 
(&quot;ithreads&quot; for short) implementation of multithreading, by Arthur 
Bergman, replaces the old &quot;5.005 threads&quot; implementation. In the 
ithreads model any data sharing between threads must be explicit, as opposed to 
the model where data sharing was implicit. See threads and threads::shared, and 
perlthrtut. As a part of the ithreads implementation Perl will also use any 
neces- sary and detectable reentrant libc interfaces.<b>Restricted</b> <b>Hashes
</b> A restricted hash is restricted to a certain set of keys, no keys out- 
side the set can be added. Also individual keys can be restricted so that the 
key cannot be deleted and the value cannot be changed. No new syntax is 
involved: the Hash::Util module is the interface.<b>Safe</b> <b>Signals</b> 
Perl used to be fragile in that signals arriving at inopportune moments could 
corrupt Perl&rsquo;s internal state. Now Perl postpones handling of signals 
until it&rsquo;s safe (between opcodes). This change may have surprising side 
effects because signals no longer interrupt Perl instantly. Perl will now first 
finish whatever it was doing, like finishing an internal operation (like<i>
sort()</i>) or an exter- nal operation (like an I/O operation), and only then 
look at any arrived signals (and before starting the next operation). No more 
cor- rupt internal state since the current operation is always finished first, 
but the signal may take more time to get heard. Note that breaking out from 
potentially blocking operations should still work, though.<b>Understanding</b> 
<b>of</b> <b>Numbers</b> In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of 
Perl&rsquo;s under- standing of numbers, both integer and floating point. Since 
in many systems the standard number parsing functions like 
&quot;strtoul()&quot; and &quot;atof()&quot; seem to have bugs, Perl tries to 
work around their deficien- cies. This results hopefully in more accurate 
numbers. Perl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions 
and basic arithmetics (+ - * /) if the arguments are integers, and tries also 
to keep the results stored internally as integers. This change leads to often 
slightly faster and always less lossy arith- metics. (Previously Perl always 
preferred floating point numbers in its math.)<b>Arrays</b> <b>now</b> <b>always
</b> <b>interpolate</b> <b>into</b> <b>double-quoted</b> <b>strings</b> <b>[561]
</b> In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what. The 
behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpo- late into 
strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was compiled, and 
otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-time error. In versions 5.000 
through 5.003, the error was Literal @example now requires backslash In 
versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was In string, @example now must be 
written as \@example The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing 
&quot;fred\@exam- ple.com&quot; when they wanted a literal &quot;@&quot; sign, 
just as they have always written &quot;Give me back my \$5&quot; when they 
wanted a literal &quot;$&quot; sign. Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl now sees an 
&quot;@&quot; sign in a double-quoted string, it<i>always</i> attempts to 
interpolate an array, regardless of whether or not the array has been used or 
declared already. The fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning: 
Possible unintended interpolation of @example in string This warns you that 
&quot;fred@example.com&quot; is going to turn into &quot;fred.com&quot; if you 
don&rsquo;t backslash the &quot;@&quot;. See 
http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/at-error.html for more details about the 
history here.<b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Changes</b> &middot; AUTOLOAD is now 
lvaluable, meaning that you can add the :lvalue attribute to AUTOLOAD 
subroutines and you can assign to the AUTOLOAD return value. &middot; The 
$Config{byteorder} (and corresponding BYTEORDER in config.h) was previously 
wrong in platforms if sizeof(long) was 4, but sizeof(IV) was 8. The byteorder 
was only sizeof(long) bytes long (1234 or 4321), but now it is correctly 
sizeof(IV) bytes long, (12345678 or 87654321). (This problem didn&rsquo;t 
affect Windows plat- forms.) Also, $Config{byteorder} is now computed 
dynamically--this is more robust with &quot;fat binaries&quot; where an 
executable image contains bina- ries for more than one binary platform, and 
when cross-compiling. &middot; &quot;perl -d:Module=arg,arg,arg&quot; now works 
(previously one couldn&rsquo;t pass in multiple arguments.) &middot; 
&quot;do&quot; followed by a bareword now ensures that this bareword 
isn&rsquo;t a keyword (to avoid a bug where &quot;do q(foo.pl)&quot; tried to 
call a sub- routine called &quot;q&quot;). This means that for example instead 
of &quot;do format()&quot; you must write &quot;do &amp;format()&quot;. 
&middot; The builtin<i>dump()</i> now gives an optional warning &quot;dump() 
better written as CORE::dump()&quot;, meaning that by default 
&quot;dump(...)&quot; is resolved as the builtin<i>dump()</i> which dumps core 
and aborts, not as (possibly) user-defined &quot;sub dump&quot;. To call the 
latter, qualify the call as &quot;&amp;dump(...)&quot;. (The whole<i>dump()</i> 
feature is to consid- ered deprecated, and possibly removed/changed in future 
releases.) &middot;<i>chomp()</i> and <i>chop()</i> are now overridable. Note, 
however, that their prototype (as given by 
&quot;prototype(&quot;CORE::chomp&quot;)&quot; is undefined, because it cannot 
be expressed and therefore one cannot really write replacements to override 
these builtins. &middot; END blocks are now run even if you exit/die in a BEGIN 
block. Internally, the execution of END blocks is now controlled by 
PL_exit_flags &amp; PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END. This enables the new behaviour for 
Perl embedders. This will default in 5.10. See per- lembed. &middot; Formats 
now support zero-padded decimal fields. &middot; Although &quot;you 
shouldn&rsquo;t do that&quot;, it was possible to write code that depends on 
Perl&rsquo;s hashed key order (Data::Dumper does this). The new algorithm 
&quot;One-at-a-Time&quot; produces a different hashed key order. More details 
are in &quot;Performance Enhancements&quot;. &middot; lstat(FILEHANDLE) now 
gives a warning because the operation makes no sense. In future releases this 
may become a fatal error. &middot; Spurious syntax errors generated in certain 
situations, when<i>glob()</i> caused File::Glob to be loaded for the first 
time, have been fixed. [561] &middot; Lvalue subroutines can now return 
&quot;undef&quot; in list context. How- ever, the lvalue subroutine feature 
still remains experimental. [561+] &middot; A lost warning &quot;Can&rsquo;t 
declare ... dereference in my&quot; has been restored (Perl had it earlier but 
it became lost in later releases.) &middot; A new special regular expression 
variable has been introduced: $^N, which contains the most-recently closed 
group (submatch). &middot; &quot;no Module;&quot; does not produce an error 
even if Module does not have an<i>unimport()</i> method. This parallels the 
behavior of &quot;use&quot; vis-a- vis &quot;import&quot;. [561] &middot; The 
numerical comparison operators return &quot;undef&quot; if either operand is a 
NaN. Previously the behaviour was unspecified. &middot; &quot;our&quot; can now 
have an experimental optional attribute &quot;unique&quot; that affects how 
global variables are shared among multiple interpreters, see &quot;our&quot; in 
perlfunc. &middot; The following builtin functions are now overridable:<i>each()
</i>, <i>keys()</i>, <i>pop()</i>, <i>push()</i>, <i>shift()</i>, <i>splice()
</i>, <i>unshift()</i>. [561] &middot; &quot;pack() / unpack()&quot; can now 
group template letters with &quot;()&quot; and then apply repetition/count 
modifiers on the groups. &middot; &quot;pack() / unpack()&quot; can now process 
the Perl internal numeric types: IVs, UVs, NVs-- and also long doubles, if 
supported by the platform. The template letters are &quot;j&quot;, 
&quot;J&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;. &middot; 
&quot;pack(&rsquo;U0a*&rsquo;, ...)&quot; can now be used to force a string to 
UTF-8. &middot; my __PACKAGE__ $obj now works. [561] &middot;<i>POSIX::sleep()
</i> now returns the number of <i>unslept</i> seconds (as the POSIX standard 
says), as opposed to<i>CORE::sleep()</i> which returns the number of slept 
seconds. &middot;<i>printf()</i> and <i>sprintf()</i> now support parameter 
reordering using the &quot;%\d+\$&quot; and &quot;*\d+\$&quot; syntaxes. For 
example printf &quot;%2\$s %1\$s\n&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;; 
will print &quot;bar foo\n&quot;. This feature helps in writing internation- 
alised software, and in general when the order of the parameters can vary. 
&middot; The (\&amp;) prototype now works properly. [561] &middot; 
prototype(\[$@%&amp;]) is now available to implicitly create references (useful 
for example if you want to emulate the<i>tie()</i> interface). &middot; A new 
command-line option, &quot;-t&quot; is available. It is the little brother of 
&quot;-T&quot;: instead of dying on taint violations, lexical warnings are 
given.<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>meant</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>

&middot; In other taint news, the &quot;exec LIST&quot; and &quot;system 
LIST&quot; have now been considered too risky (think &quot;exec @ARGV&quot;: it 
can start any program with any arguments), and now the said forms cause a 
warning under lexical warnings. You should carefully launder the arguments to 
guarantee their validity. In future releases of Perl the forms will become 
fatal errors so consider starting laundering now. &middot; Tied hash interfaces 
are now required to have the EXISTS and DELETE methods (either own or 
inherited). &middot; If tr/// is just counting characters, it doesn&rsquo;t 
attempt to modify its target. &middot;<i>untie()</i> will now call an <i>UNTIE()
</i> hook if it exists. See perltie for details. [561] &middot; utime now 
supports &quot;utime undef, undef, @files&quot; to change the file timestamps 
to the current time. &middot; The rules for allowing underscores (underbars) in 
numeric constants have been relaxed and simplified: now you can have an 
underscore simply<b>between</b> <b>digits</b>. &middot; Rather than relying on 
C&rsquo;s argv[0] (which may not contain a full pathname) where possible $^X is 
now set by asking the operating system. (eg by reading<i>/proc/self/exe</i> on 
Linux,<i>/proc/curproc/file</i> on FreeBSD) &middot; A new variable, 
&quot;${^TAINT}&quot;, indicates whether taint mode is enabled. &middot; You 
can now override the<i>readline()</i> builtin, and this overrides also the 
&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt; angle bracket operator. &middot; The command-line options -s 
and -F are now recognized on the she- bang (#!) line. &middot; Use of the 
&quot;/c&quot; match modifier without an accompanying &quot;/g&quot; modi- fier 
elicits a new warning: &quot;Use of /c modifier is meaningless without 
/g&quot;. Use of &quot;/c&quot; in substitutions, even with &quot;/g&quot;, 
elicits &quot;Use of /c modifier is meaningless in s///&quot;. Use of 
&quot;/g&quot; with &quot;split&quot; elicits &quot;Use of /g modifier is 
meaningless in split&quot;. &middot; Support for the &quot;CLONE&quot; special 
subroutine had been added. With ithreads, when a new thread is created, all 
Perl data is cloned, however non-Perl data cannot be cloned automatically. In 
&quot;CLONE&quot; you can do whatever you need to do, like for example handle 
the cloning of non-Perl data, if necessary. &quot;CLONE&quot; will be executed 
once for every package that has it defined or inherited. It will be called in 
the context of the new thread, so all modifications are made in the new area. 
See perlmod</pre> 
<h2>Modules and Pragmata</h2> 
<pre> <b>New</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b> &middot; 
&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot;, originally by Damian Conway and now main- 
tained by Arthur Bergman, allows a class to define attribute han- dlers. 
package MyPack; use Attribute::Handlers; sub Wolf :ATTR(SCALAR) { print 
&quot;howl!\n&quot; } # later, in some package using or inheriting from 
MyPack... my MyPack $Fluffy : Wolf; # the attribute handler Wolf will be called 
Both variables and routines can have attribute handlers. Handlers can be 
specific to type (SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH, or CODE), or specific to the exact 
compilation phase (BEGIN, CHECK, INIT, or END). See Attribute::Handlers. 
&middot; &quot;B::Concise&quot;, by Stephen McCamant, is a new compiler backend 
for walking the Perl syntax tree, printing concise info about ops. The output 
is highly customisable. See B::Concise. [561+] &middot; The new bignum, bigint, 
and bigrat pragmas, by Tels, implement transparent bignum support (using the 
Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat, and Math::BigRat backends). &middot; 
&quot;Class::ISA&quot;, by Sean Burke, is a module for reporting the search 
path for a class&rsquo;s ISA tree. See Class::ISA. &middot; &quot;Cwd&quot; now 
has a split personality: if possible, an XS extension is used, (this will 
hopefully be faster, more secure, and more robust) but if not possible, the 
familiar Perl implementation is used. &middot; &quot;Devel::PPPort&quot;, 
originally by Kenneth Albanowski and now main- tained by Paul Marquess, has 
been added. It is primarily used by &quot;h2xs&quot; to enhance portability of 
XS modules between different ver- sions of Perl. See Devel::PPPort. &middot; 
&quot;Digest&quot;, frontend module for calculating digests (checksums), from 
Gisle Aas, has been added. See Digest. &middot; &quot;Digest::MD5&quot; for 
calculating MD5 digests (checksums) as defined in RFC 1321, from Gisle Aas, has 
been added. See Digest::MD5. use Digest::MD5 &rsquo;md5_hex&rsquo;; $digest = 
md5_hex(&quot;Thirsty Camel&quot;); print $digest, &quot;\n&quot;; # 
01d19d9d2045e005c3f1b80e8b164de1 NOTE: the &quot;MD5&quot; backward 
compatibility module is deliberately not included since its further use is 
discouraged. See also PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint. &middot; &quot;Encode&quot;, 
originally by Nick Ing-Simmons and now maintained by Dan Kogai, provides a 
mechanism to translate between different charac- ter encodings. Support for 
Unicode, ISO-8859-1, and ASCII are com- piled in to the module. Several other 
encodings (like the rest of the ISO-8859, CP*/Win*, Mac, KOI8-R, three variants 
EBCDIC, Chi- nese, Japanese, and Korean encodings) are included and can be 
loaded at runtime. (For space considerations, the largest Chinese encodings 
have been separated into their own CPAN module, Encode::HanExtra, which Encode 
will use if available). See Encode. Any encoding supported by Encode module is 
also available to the &quot;:<i>encoding()</i>&quot; layer if PerlIO is used. 
&middot; &quot;Hash::Util&quot; is the interface to the new<i>restricted</i> <i>
hashes</i> feature. (Implemented by Jeffrey Friedl, Nick Ing-Simmons, and 
Michael Schw- ern.) See Hash::Util. &middot; &quot;I18N::Langinfo&quot; can be 
used to query locale information. See I18N::Langinfo. &middot; 
&quot;I18N::LangTags&quot;, by Sean Burke, has functions for dealing with 
RFC3066-style language tags. See I18N::LangTags. &middot; 
&quot;ExtUtils::Constant&quot;, by Nicholas Clark, is a new tool for exten- 
sion writers for generating XS code to import C header constants. See 
ExtUtils::Constant. &middot; &quot;Filter::Simple&quot;, by Damian Conway, is 
an easy-to-use frontend to Filter::Util::Call. See Filter::Simple. # in 
MyFilter.pm: package MyFilter; use Filter::Simple sub { while (my ($from, $to) 
= splice @_, 0, 2) { s/$from/$to/g; } }; 1; # in user&rsquo;s code: use 
MyFilter qr/red/ =&gt; &rsquo;green&rsquo;; print &quot;red\n&quot;; # this 
code is filtered, will print &quot;green\n&quot; print &quot;bored\n&quot;; # 
this code is filtered, will print &quot;bogreen\n&quot; no MyFilter; print 
&quot;red\n&quot;; # this code is not filtered, will print &quot;red\n&quot; 
&middot; &quot;File::Temp&quot;, by Tim Jenness, allows one to create temporary 
files and directories in an easy, portable, and secure way. See File::Temp. 
[561+] &middot; &quot;Filter::Util::Call&quot;, by Paul Marquess, provides you 
with the framework to write<i>source</i> <i>filters</i> in Perl. For most uses, 
the frontend Filter::Simple is to be preferred. See Fil- ter::Util::Call. 
&middot; &quot;if&quot;, by Ilya Zakharevich, is a new pragma for conditional 
inclu- sion of modules. &middot; libnet, by Graham Barr, is a collection of 
perl5 modules related to network programming. See Net::FTP, Net::NNTP, 
Net::Ping (not part of libnet, but related), Net::POP3, Net::SMTP, and 
Net::Time. Perl installation leaves libnet unconfigured; use<i>libnetcfg</i> to 
con- figure it. &middot; &quot;List::Util&quot;, by Graham Barr, is a selection 
of general-utility list subroutines, such as<i>sum()</i>, <i>min()</i>, <i>
first()</i>, and <i>shuffle()</i>. See List::Util. &middot; 
&quot;Locale::Constants&quot;, &quot;Locale::Country&quot;, 
&quot;Locale::Currency&quot; &quot;Locale::Language&quot;, and Locale::Script, 
by Neil Bowers, have been added. They provide the codes for various locale 
standards, such as &quot;fr&quot; for France, &quot;usd&quot; for US Dollar, 
and &quot;ja&quot; for Japanese. use Locale::Country; $country = 
code2country(&rsquo;jp&rsquo;); # $country gets &rsquo;Japan&rsquo; $code = 
country2code(&rsquo;Norway&rsquo;); # $code gets &rsquo;no&rsquo; See 
Locale::Constants, Locale::Country, Locale::Currency, and Locale::Language. 
&middot; &quot;Locale::Maketext&quot;, by Sean Burke, is a localization 
framework. See Locale::Maketext, and Locale::Maketext::TPJ13. The latter is an 
article about software localization, originally published in The Perl Journal 
#13, and republished here with kind permission. &middot; 
&quot;Math::BigRat&quot; for big rational numbers, to accompany Math::BigInt 
and Math::BigFloat, from Tels. See Math::BigRat. &middot; &quot;Memoize&quot; 
can make your functions faster by trading space for time, from Mark-Jason 
Dominus. See Memoize. &middot; &quot;MIME::Base64&quot;, by Gisle Aas, allows 
you to encode data in base64, as defined in RFC 2045 -<i>MIME</i> <i>
(Multipurpose</i> <i>Internet</i> <i>Mail</i> <i>Exten-</i> <i>sions)</i>. use 
MIME::Base64; $encoded = encode_base64(&rsquo;Aladdin:open sesame&rsquo;); 
$decoded = decode_base64($encoded); print $encoded, &quot;\n&quot;; # 
&quot;QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==&quot; See MIME::Base64. &middot; 
&quot;MIME::QuotedPrint&quot;, by Gisle Aas, allows you to encode data in 
quoted-printable encoding, as defined in RFC 2045 -<i>MIME</i> <i>(Multipur-</i>
<i>pose</i> <i>Internet</i> <i>Mail</i> <i>Extensions)</i>. use 
MIME::QuotedPrint; $encoded = encode_qp(&quot;\xDE\xAD\xBE\xEF&quot;); $decoded 
= decode_qp($encoded); print $encoded, &quot;\n&quot;; # 
&quot;=DE=AD=BE=EF\n&quot; print $decoded, &quot;\n&quot;; # 
&quot;\xDE\xAD\xBE\xEF\n&quot; See also PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint. &middot; 
&quot;NEXT&quot;, by Damian Conway, is a pseudo-class for method redispatch. 
See NEXT. &middot; &quot;open&quot; is a new pragma for setting the default I/O 
layers for<i>open()</i>. &middot; &quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot;, by Nick 
Ing-Simmons, provides the implementation of IO to &quot;in memory&quot; Perl 
scalars as discussed above. It also serves as an example of a loadable PerlIO 
layer. Other future pos- sibilities include PerlIO::Array and PerlIO::Code. See 
Per- lIO::scalar. &middot; &quot;PerlIO::via&quot;, by Nick Ing-Simmons, acts 
as a PerlIO layer and wraps PerlIO layer functionality provided by a class 
(typically implemented in Perl code). &middot; 
&quot;PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint&quot;, by Elizabeth Mattijsen, is an example of 
a &quot;PerlIO::via&quot; class: use PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint; 
open($fh,&quot;&gt;:via(QuotedPrint)&quot;,$path); This will automatically 
convert everything output to $fh to Quoted-Printable. See PerlIO::via and 
PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint. &middot; &quot;Pod::ParseLink&quot;, by Russ Allbery, 
has been added, to parse L&lt;&gt; links in pods as described in the new 
perlpodspec. &middot; &quot;Pod::Text::Overstrike&quot;, by Joe Smith, has been 
added. It converts POD data to formatted overstrike text. See 
Pod::Text::Overstrike. [561+] &middot; &quot;Scalar::Util&quot; is a selection 
of general-utility scalar subrou- tines, such as<i>blessed()</i>, <i>reftype()
</i>, and <i>tainted()</i>. See Scalar::Util. &middot; &quot;sort&quot; is a 
new pragma for controlling the behaviour of<i>sort()</i>. &middot; 
&quot;Storable&quot; gives persistence to Perl data structures by allowing the 
storage and retrieval of Perl data to and from files in a fast and compact 
binary format. Because in effect Storable does serial- isation of Perl data 
structures, with it you can also clone deep, hierarchical datastructures. 
Storable was originally created by Raphael Manfredi, but it is now maintained 
by Abhijit Menon-Sen. Storable has been enhanced to understand the two new hash 
features, Unicode keys and restricted hashes. See Storable. &middot; 
&quot;Switch&quot;, by Damian Conway, has been added. Just by saying use 
Switch; you have &quot;switch&quot; and &quot;case&quot; available in Perl. use 
Switch; switch ($val) { case 1 { print &quot;number 1&quot; } case 
&quot;a&quot; { print &quot;string a&quot; } case [1..10,42] { print 
&quot;number in list&quot; } case (@array) { print &quot;number in list&quot; } 
case /\w+/ { print &quot;pattern&quot; } case qr/\w+/ { print 
&quot;pattern&quot; } case (%hash) { print &quot;entry in hash&quot; } case 
(\%hash) { print &quot;entry in hash&quot; } case (\&amp;sub) { print &quot;arg 
to subroutine&quot; } else { print &quot;previous case not true&quot; } } See 
Switch. &middot; &quot;Test::More&quot;, by Michael Schwern, is yet another 
framework for writing test scripts, more extensive than Test::Simple. See 
Test::More. &middot; &quot;Test::Simple&quot;, by Michael Schwern, has basic 
utilities for writing tests. See Test::Simple. &middot; 
&quot;Text::Balanced&quot;, by Damian Conway, has been added, for extracting 
delimited text sequences from strings. use Text::Balanced 
&rsquo;extract_delimited&rsquo;; ($a, $b) = 
extract_delimited(&quot;&rsquo;never say never&rsquo;, he never said&quot;, 
&quot;&rsquo;&quot;, &rsquo;&rsquo;); $a will be &quot;&rsquo;never say 
never&rsquo;&quot;, $b will be &rsquo;, he never said&rsquo;. In addition to<i>
extract</i><b>_</b><i>delimited()</i>, there are also <i>extract</i><b>_</b><i>
brack-</i> <i>eted()</i>, <i>extract</i><b>_</b><i>quotelike()</i>, <i>extract
</i><b>_</b><i>codeblock()</i>, <i>extract</i><b>_</b><i>vari-</i> <i>able()</i>
,<i>extract</i><b>_</b><i>tagged()</i>, <i>extract</i><b>_</b><i>multiple()</i>,
<i>gen</i><b>_</b><i>delimited</i><b>_</b><i>pat()</i>, and <i>gen</i><b>_</b>
<i>extract</i><b>_</b><i>tagged()</i>. With these, you can implement rather 
advanced parsing algorithms. See Text::Balanced. &middot; &quot;threads&quot;, 
by Arthur Bergman, is an interface to interpreter threads. Interpreter threads 
(ithreads) is the new thread model introduced in Perl 5.6 but only available as 
an internal interface for extension writers (and for Win32 Perl for 
&quot;fork()&quot; emulation). See threads, threads::shared, and perlthrtut. 
&middot; &quot;threads::shared&quot;, by Arthur Bergman, allows data sharing 
for interpreter threads. See threads::shared. &middot; &quot;Tie::File&quot;, 
by Mark-Jason Dominus, associates a Perl array with the lines of a file. See 
Tie::File. &middot; &quot;Tie::Memoize&quot;, by Ilya Zakharevich, provides 
on-demand loaded hashes. See Tie::Memoize. &middot; 
&quot;Tie::RefHash::Nestable&quot;, by Edward Avis, allows storing hash ref- 
erences (unlike the standard Tie::RefHash) The module is contained within 
Tie::RefHash. See Tie::RefHash. &middot; &quot;Time::HiRes&quot;, by Douglas E. 
Wegscheid, provides high resolution timing (ualarm, usleep, and gettimeofday). 
See Time::HiRes. &middot; &quot;Unicode::UCD&quot; offers a querying interface 
to the Unicode Character Database. See Unicode::UCD. &middot; 
&quot;Unicode::Collate&quot;, by SADAHIRO Tomoyuki, implements the UCA (Uni- 
code Collation Algorithm) for sorting Unicode strings. See Uni- code::Collate. 
&middot; &quot;Unicode::Normalize&quot;, by SADAHIRO Tomoyuki, implements the 
various Unicode normalization forms. See Unicode::Normalize. &middot; 
&quot;XS::APItest&quot;, by Tim Jenness, is a test extension that exercises XS 
APIs. Currently only &quot;printf()&quot; is tested: how to output vari- ous 
basic data types from XS. &middot; &quot;XS::Typemap&quot;, by Tim Jenness, is 
a test extension that exercises XS typemaps. Nothing gets installed, but the 
code is worth study- ing for extension writers.<b>Updated</b> <b>And</b> <b>
Improved</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b> &middot; The following 
independently supported modules have been updated to the newest versions from 
CPAN: CGI, CPAN, DB_File, File::Spec, File::Temp, Getopt::Long, Math::BigFloat, 
Math::BigInt, the podla- tors bundle (Pod::Man, Pod::Text), Pod::LaTeX [561+], 
Pod::Parser, Storable, Term::ANSIColor, Test, Text-Tabs+Wrap. &middot;<i>
attributes::reftype()</i> now works on tied arguments. &middot; AutoLoader can 
now be disabled with &quot;no AutoLoader;&quot;. &middot; B::Deparse has been 
significantly enhanced by Robin Houston. It can now deparse almost all of the 
standard test suite (so that the tests still succeed). There is a make target 
&quot;test.deparse&quot; for trying this out. &middot; Carp now has better 
interface documentation, and the @CARP_NOT interface has been added to get 
optional control over where errors are reported independently of @ISA, by Ben 
Tilly. &middot; Class::Struct can now define the classes in compile time. 
&middot; Class::Struct now assigns the array/hash element if the accessor is 
called with an array/hash element as the<b>sole</b> argument. &middot; The 
return value of<i>Cwd::fastcwd()</i> is now tainted. &middot; Data::Dumper now 
has an option to sort hashes. &middot; Data::Dumper now has an option to dump 
code references using B::Deparse. &middot; DB_File now supports newer Berkeley 
DB versions, among other improvements. &middot; Devel::Peek now has an 
interface for the Perl memory statistics (this works only if you are using 
perl&rsquo;s malloc, and if you have compiled with debugging). &middot; The 
English module can now be used without the infamous performance hit by saying 
use English &rsquo;-no_match_vars&rsquo;; (Assuming, of course, that you 
don&rsquo;t need the troublesome variables $&acirc;&#128;&#152;, $&amp;, or 
$&rsquo;.) Also, introduced @LAST_MATCH_START and @LAST_MATCH_END English 
aliases for &quot;@-&quot; and &quot;@+&quot;. &middot; ExtUtils::MakeMaker has 
been significantly cleaned up and fixed. The enhanced version has also been 
backported to earlier releases of Perl and submitted to CPAN so that the 
earlier releases can enjoy the fixes. &middot; The arguments of<i>
WriteMakefile()</i> in Makefile.PL are now checked for sanity much more 
carefully than before. This may cause new warn- ings when modules are being 
installed. See ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more details. &middot; 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker now uses File::Spec internally, which hopefully leads to 
better portability. &middot; Fcntl, Socket, and Sys::Syslog have been rewritten 
by Nicholas Clark to use the new-style constant dispatch section (see ExtU- 
tils::Constant). This means that they will be more robust and hopefully faster. 
&middot; File::Find now<i>chdir()</i>s correctly when chasing symbolic links. 
[561] &middot; File::Find now has pre- and post-processing callbacks. It also 
correctly changes directories when chasing symbolic links. Call- backs 
(naughtily) exiting with &quot;next;&quot; instead of &quot;return;&quot; now 
work. &middot; File::Find is now (again) reentrant. It also has been made more 
portable. &middot; The warnings issued by File::Find now belong to their own 
category. You can enable/disable them with &quot;use/no warnings 
&rsquo;File::Find&rsquo;;&quot;. &middot;<i>File::Glob::glob()</i> has been 
renamed to<i>File::Glob::bsd</i><b>_</b><i>glob()</i> because the name clashes 
with the builtin<i>glob()</i>. The older name is still available for 
compatibility, but is deprecated. [561] &middot; File::Glob now supports 
&quot;GLOB_LIMIT&quot; constant to limit the size of the returned list of 
filenames. &middot; IPC::Open3 now allows the use of numeric file descriptors. 
&middot; IO::Socket now has an<i>atmark()</i> method, which returns true if the 
socket is positioned at the out-of-band mark. The method is also exportable as a
<i>sockatmark()</i> function. &middot; IO::Socket::INET failed to open the 
specified port if the service name was not known. It now correctly uses the 
supplied port number as is. [561] &middot; IO::Socket::INET has support for the 
ReusePort option (if your platform supports it). The Reuse option now has an 
alias, Reuse- Addr. For clarity, you may want to prefer ReuseAddr. &middot; 
IO::Socket::INET now supports a value of zero for &quot;LocalPort&quot; (usu- 
ally meaning that the operating system will make one up.) &middot; &rsquo;use 
lib&rsquo; now works identically to @INC. Removing directories with &rsquo;no 
lib&rsquo; now works. &middot; Math::BigFloat and Math::BigInt have undergone a 
full rewrite by Tels. They are now magnitudes faster, and they support various 
bignum libraries such as GMP and PARI as their backends. &middot; Math::Complex 
handles inf, NaN etc., better. &middot; Net::Ping has been considerably 
enhanced by Rob Brown: multihoming is now supported, Win32 functionality is 
better, there is now time measuring functionality (optionally high-resolution 
using Time::HiRes), and there is now &quot;external&quot; protocol which uses 
Net::Ping::External module which runs your external ping utility and parses the 
output. A version of Net::Ping::External is avail- able in CPAN. Note that some 
of the Net::Ping tests are disabled when running under the Perl distribution 
since one cannot assume one or more of the following: enabled echo port at 
localhost, full Internet con- nectivity, or sympathetic firewalls. You can set 
the environment variable PERL_TEST_Net_Ping to &quot;1&quot; (one) before 
running the Perl test suite to enable all the Net::Ping tests. &middot;<i>
POSIX::sigaction()</i> is now much more flexible and robust. You can now 
install coderef handlers, &rsquo;DEFAULT&rsquo;, and &rsquo;IGNORE&rsquo; 
handlers, installing new handlers was not atomic. &middot; In Safe, %INC is now 
localised in a Safe compartment so that use/require work. &middot; In SDBM_File 
on dosish platforms, some keys went missing because of lack of support for 
files with &quot;holes&quot;. A workaround for the prob- lem has been added. 
&middot; In Search::Dict one can now have a pre-processing hook for the lines 
being searched. &middot; The Shell module now has an OO interface. &middot; In 
Sys::Syslog there is now a failover mechanism that will go through alternative 
connection mechanisms until the message is suc- cessfully logged. &middot; The 
Test module has been significantly enhanced. &middot;<i>Time::Local::timelocal()
</i> does not handle fractional seconds any- more. The rationale is that 
neither does<i>localtime()</i>, and <i>timelo-</i> <i>cal()</i> and <i>
localtime()</i> are supposed to be inverses of each other. &middot; The vars 
pragma now supports declaring fully qualified variables. (Something that 
&quot;our()&quot; does not and will not support.) &middot; The 
&quot;utf8::&quot; name space (as in the pragma) provides various Perl- 
callable functions to provide low level access to Perl&rsquo;s internal Unicode 
representation. At the moment only<i>length()</i> has been implemented. </pre> 
<h2>Utility Changes</h2> 
<pre> &middot; Emacs perl mode (emacs/cperl-mode.el) has been updated to 
version 4.31. &middot;<i>emacs/e2ctags.pl</i> is now much faster. &middot; 
&quot;enc2xs&quot; is a tool for people adding their own encodings to the 
Encode module. &middot; &quot;h2ph&quot; now supports C trigraphs. &middot; 
&quot;h2xs&quot; now produces a template README. &middot; &quot;h2xs&quot; now 
uses &quot;Devel::PPPort&quot; for better portability between dif- ferent 
versions of Perl. &middot; &quot;h2xs&quot; uses the new ExtUtils::Constant 
module which will affect newly created extensions that define constants. Since 
the new code is more correct (if you have two constants where the first one is 
a prefix of the second one, the first constant<b>never</b> got defined), less 
lossy (it uses integers for integer constant, as opposed to the old code that 
used floating point numbers even for integer con- stants), and slightly faster, 
you might want to consider regenerat- ing your extension code (the new scheme 
makes regenerating easy). h2xs now also supports C trigraphs. &middot; 
&quot;libnetcfg&quot; has been added to configure libnet. &middot; 
&quot;perlbug&quot; is now much more robust. It also sends the bug report to 
perl.org, not perl.com. &middot; &quot;perlcc&quot; has been rewritten and its 
user interface (that is, com- mand line) is much more like that of the UNIX C 
compiler, cc. (The perlbc tools has been removed. Use &quot;perlcc -B&quot; 
instead.)<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>perlcc</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>
considered</b> <b>very</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>and</b> <b>unsupported.</b> 
[561] &middot; &quot;perlivp&quot; is a new Installation Verification Procedure 
utility for running any time after installing Perl. &middot; &quot;piconv&quot; 
is an implementation of the character conversion utility &quot;iconv&quot;, 
demonstrating the new Encode module. &middot; &quot;pod2html&quot; now allows 
specifying a cache directory. &middot; &quot;pod2html&quot; now produces XHTML 
1.0. &middot; &quot;pod2html&quot; now understands POD written using different 
line endings (PC-like CRLF versus UNIX-like LF versus MacClassic-like CR). 
&middot; &quot;s2p&quot; has been completely rewritten in Perl. (It is in fact 
a full implementation of sed in Perl: you can use the sed functionality by 
using the &quot;psed&quot; utility.) &middot; &quot;xsubpp&quot; now 
understands POD documentation embedded in the *.xs files. [561] &middot; 
&quot;xsubpp&quot; now supports the OUT keyword.</pre> 
<h2>New Documentation</h2> 
<pre> &middot; perl56delta details the changes between the 5.005 release and 
the 5.6.0 release. &middot; perlclib documents the internal replacements for 
standard C library functions. (Interesting only for extension writers and Perl 
core hackers.) [561+] &middot; perldebtut is a Perl debugging tutorial. [561+] 
&middot; perlebcdic contains considerations for running Perl on EBCDIC plat- 
forms. [561+] &middot; perlintro is a gentle introduction to Perl. &middot; 
perliol documents the internals of PerlIO with layers. &middot; perlmodstyle is 
a style guide for writing modules. &middot; perlnewmod tells about writing and

best practices gathered over the years. &middot; perlpodspec is a more formal 
specification of the pod format, mainly of interest for writers of pod 
applications, not to people writing in pod. &middot; perlretut is a regular 
expression tutorial. [561+] &middot; perlrequick is a regular expressions 
quick-start guide. Yes, much quicker than perlretut. [561] &middot; perltodo 
has been updated. &middot; perltootc has been renamed as perltooc (to not to 
conflict with perltoot in filesystems restricted to &quot;8.3&quot; names). 
&middot; perluniintro is an introduction to using Unicode in Perl. (perlu- 
nicode is more of a detailed reference and background information) &middot; 
perlutil explains the command line utilities packaged with the Perl 
distribution. [561+] The following platform-specific documents are available

perlwin32 These documents usually detail one or more of the following subjects: 
configuring, building, testing, installing, and sometimes also using Perl on 
the said platform. Eastern Asian Perl users are now welcomed in their own 
languages: README.jp (Japanese), README.ko (Korean), README.cn (simplified Chi- 
nese) and README.tw (traditional Chinese), which are written in normal pod but 
encoded in EUC-JP, EUC-KR, EUC-CN and Big5. These will get installed as perljp 
perlko perlcn perltw &middot; The documentation for the POSIX-BC platform is 
called &quot;BS2000&quot;, to avoid confusion with the Perl POSIX module. 
&middot; The documentation for the WinCE platform is called perlce (README.ce 
in the source code kit), to avoid confusion with the perlwin32 documentation on 
8.3-restricted filesystems.</pre> 
<h2>Performance Enhancements</h2> 
<pre> &middot; <i>map()</i> could get pathologically slow when the result list 
it gener- ates is larger than the source list. The performance has been 
improved for common scenarios. [561] &middot;<i>sort()</i> is also fully 
reentrant, in the sense that the sort function can itself call<i>sort()</i>. 
This did not work reliably in previous releases. [561] &middot;<i>sort()</i> 
has been changed to use primarily mergesort internally as opposed to the 
earlier quicksort. For very small lists this may result in slightly slower 
sorting times, but in general the speedup should be at least 20%. Additional 
bonuses are that the worst case behaviour of<i>sort()</i> is now better (in 
computer science terms it now runs in time O(N log N), as opposed to 
quicksort&rsquo;s Theta(N**2) worst-case run time behaviour), and that<i>sort()
</i> is now stable (meaning that elements with identical keys will stay ordered 
as they were before the sort). See the &quot;sort&quot; pragma for information. 
The story in more detail: suppose you want to serve yourself a lit- tle slice 
of Pi. @digits = ( 3,1,4,1,5,9 ); A numerical sort of the digits will yield 
(1,1,3,4,5,9), as expected. Which 1 comes first is hard to know, since one 1 
looks pretty much like any other. You can regard this as totally triv- ial, or 
somewhat profound. However, if you just want to sort the even digits ahead of 
the odd ones, then what will sort { ($a % 2) &lt;=&gt; ($b % 2) } @digits; 
yield? The only even digit, 4, will come first. But how about the odd numbers, 
which all compare equal? With the quicksort algorithm used to implement Perl 
5.6 and earlier, the order of ties is left up to the sort. So, as you add more 
and more digits of Pi, the order in which the sorted even and odd digits appear 
will change. and, for sufficiently large slices of Pi, the quicksort algorithm 
in Perl 5.8 won&rsquo;t return the same results even if reinvoked with the same 
input. The justification for this rests with quicksort&rsquo;s worst case 
behavior. If you run sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } ( 1 .. $N , 1 .. $N ); (something 
you might approximate if you wanted to merge two sorted arrays using sort), 
doubling $N doesn&rsquo;t just double the quicksort time, it<i>quadruples</i> 
it. Quicksort has a worst case run time that can grow like N**2, so-called<i>
quadratic</i> behaviour, and it can hap- pen on patterns that may well arise in 
normal use. You won&rsquo;t notice this for small arrays, but you<i>will</i> 
notice it with larger arrays, and you may not live long enough for the sort to 
complete on arrays of a million elements. So the 5.8 quicksort scrambles large 
arrays before sorting them, as a statistical defence against quadratic 
behaviour. But that means if you sort the same large array twice, ties may be 
broken in different ways. Because of the unpredictability of tie-breaking 
order, and the quadratic worst-case behaviour, quicksort was<i>almost</i> 
replaced com- pletely with a stable mergesort.<i>Stable</i> means that ties are 
broken to preserve the original order of appearance in the input array. So sort 
{ ($a % 2) &lt;=&gt; ($b % 2) } (3,1,4,1,5,9); will yield (4,3,1,1,5,9), 
guaranteed. The even and odd numbers appear in the output in the same order 
they appeared in the input. Mergesort has worst case O(N log N) behaviour, the 
best value attainable. And, ironically, this mergesort does particularly well 
where quicksort goes quadratic: mergesort sorts (1..$N, 1..$N) in O(N) time. 
But quicksort was rescued at the last moment because it is faster than 
mergesort on certain inputs and platforms. For example, if you really<i>
don&acirc;</i>&#128;&#153;<i>t</i> care about the order of even and odd digits, 
quicksort will run in O(N) time; it&rsquo;s very good at sorting many 
repetitions of a small number of distinct elements. The quicksort divide and 
conquer strategy works well on platforms with relatively small, very fast, 
caches. Eventually, the problem gets whittled down to one that fits in the 
cache, from which point it benefits from the increased memory speed. Quicksort 
was rescued by implementing a sort pragma to control aspects of the sort. The<b>
stable</b> subpragma forces stable behaviour, regardless of algorithm. The <b>
_quicksort</b> and <b>_mergesort</b> subpragmas are heavy-handed ways to select 
the underlying implementation. The leading &quot;_&quot; is a reminder that 
these subpragmas may not survive beyond 5.8. More appropriate mechanisms for 
selecting the imple- mentation exist, but they wouldn&rsquo;t have arrived in 
time to save quicksort. &middot; Hashes now use Bob Jenkins 
&quot;One-at-a-Time&quot; hashing key algorithm ( 
http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html ). This algorithm is reasonably 
fast while producing a much better spread of values than the old hashing 
algorithm (originally by Chris Torek, later tweaked by Ilya Zakharevich). Hash 
values output from the algorithm on a hash of all 3-char printable ASCII keys 
comes much closer to pass- ing the DIEHARD random number generation tests. 
According to perl- bench, this change has not affected the overall speed of 
Perl. &middot;<i>unshift()</i> should now be noticeably faster. </pre> 
<h2>Installation and Configuration Improvements</h2> 
<pre> <b>Generic</b> <b>Improvements</b> &middot; INSTALL now explains how you 
can configure Perl to use 64-bit inte- gers even on non-64-bit platforms. 
&middot; Policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a Policy.sh file (see 
INSTALL) and you use Configure -Dprefix=/foo/bar and in the old Policy $prefix 
eq $siteprefix and $prefix eq $vendorprefix, all of them will now be changed to 
the new prefix, /foo/bar. (Previously only $prefix changed.) If you do not like 
this new behaviour, specify prefix, siteprefix, and vendorprefix explicitly. 
&middot; A new optional location for Perl libraries, otherlibdirs, is avail- 
able. It can be used for example for vendor add-ons without dis- turbing 
Perl&rsquo;s own library directories. &middot; In many platforms, the 
vendor-supplied &rsquo;cc&rsquo; is too stripped-down to build Perl (basically, 
&rsquo;cc&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t do ANSI C). If this seems to be the case and 
&rsquo;cc&rsquo; does not seem to be the GNU C compiler &rsquo;gcc&rsquo;, an 
automatic attempt is made to find and use &rsquo;gcc&rsquo; instead. &middot; 
gcc needs to closely track the operating system release to avoid build 
problems. If Configure finds that gcc was built for a differ- ent operating 
system release than is running, it now gives a clearly visible warning that 
there may be trouble ahead. &middot; Since Perl 5.8 is not binary-compatible 
with previous releases of Perl, Configure no longer suggests including the 
5.005 modules in @INC. &middot; Configure &quot;-S&quot; can now run 
non-interactively. [561] &middot; Configure support for pdp11-style memory 
models has been removed due to obsolescence. [561] &middot; configure.gnu now 
works with options with whitespace in them. &middot; installperl now outputs 
everything to STDERR. &middot; Because PerlIO is now the default on most 
platforms, &quot;-perlio&quot; doesn&rsquo;t get appended to the 
$Config{archname} (also known as $^O) anymore. Instead, if you explicitly 
choose not to use perlio (Con- figure command line option -Uuseperlio), you 
will get &quot;-stdio&quot; appended. &middot; Another change related to the 
architecture name is that &quot;-64all&quot; (-Duse64bitall, or &quot;maximally 
64-bit&quot;) is appended only if your pointers are 64 bits wide. (To be exact, 
the use64bitall is ignored.) &middot; In AFS installations, one can configure 
the root of the AFS to be somewhere else than the default<i>/afs</i> by using 
the Configure parame- ter &quot;-Dafsroot=/some/where/else&quot;. &middot; 
APPLLIB_EXP, a lesser-known configuration-time definition, has been documented. 
It can be used to prepend site-specific directories to Perl&rsquo;s default 
search path (@INC); see INSTALL for information. &middot; The version of 
Berkeley DB used when the Perl (and, presumably, the DB_File extension) was 
built is now available as @Config{qw(db_ver- sion_major db_version_minor 
db_version_patch)} from Perl and as &quot;DB_VERSION_MAJOR_CFG 
DB_VERSION_MINOR_CFG DB_VERSION_PATCH_CFG&quot; from C. &middot; Building 
Berkeley DB3 for compatibility modes for DB, NDBM, and ODBM has been documented 
in INSTALL. &middot; If you have CPAN access (either network or a local copy 
such as a CD-ROM) you can during specify extra modules to Configure to build 
and install with Perl using the -Dextras=... option. See INSTALL for more 
details. &middot; In addition to config.over, a new override file, config.arch, 
is available. This file is supposed to be used by hints file writers for 
architecture-wide changes (as opposed to config.over which is for site-wide 
changes). &middot; If your file system supports symbolic links, you can build 
Perl outside of the source directory by mkdir perl/build/directory cd 
perl/build/directory sh /path/to/perl/source/Configure -Dmksymlinks ... This 
will create in perl/build/directory a tree of symbolic links pointing to files 
in /path/to/perl/source. The original files are left unaffected. After 
Configure has finished, you can just say make all test and Perl will be built 
and tested, all in perl/build/directory. [561] &middot; For Perl developers, 
several new make targets for profiling and debugging have been added; see 
perlhack. &middot; Use of the<i>gprof</i> tool to profile Perl has been 
documented in perlhack. There is a make target called &quot;perl.gprof&quot; 
for generating a gprofiled Perl executable. &middot; If you have GCC 3, there 
is a make target called &quot;perl.gcov&quot; for creating a gcoved Perl 
executable for cov- erage analysis. See perlhack. &middot; If you are on IRIX 
or Tru64 platforms, new profiling/debug- ging options have been added; see 
perlhack for more infor- mation about pixie and Third Degree. &middot; 
Guidelines of how to construct minimal Perl installations have been added to 
INSTALL. &middot; The Thread extension is now not built at all under ithreads 
(&quot;Con- figure -Duseithreads&quot;) because it wouldn&rsquo;t work anyway 
(the Thread extension requires being Configured with 
&quot;-Duse5005threads&quot;).<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>5.005</b> 
<b>threads</b> <b>are</b> <b>unsupported</b> <b>and</b> <b>deprecated:</b> <b>if
</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>code</b> <b>written</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>
old</b> <b>threads</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>migrate</b> <b>it</b> <b>to
</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>ithreads</b> <b>model.</b> &middot; The Gconvert 
macro ($Config{d_Gconvert}) used by perl for stringi- fying floating-point 
numbers is now more picky about using sprintf %.*g rules for the conversion. 
Some platforms that used to use gcvt may now resort to the slower sprintf. 
&middot; The obsolete method of making a special (e.g., debugging) flavor of 
perl by saying make LIBPERL=libperld.a has been removed. Use -DDEBUGGING 
instead.<b>New</b> <b>Or</b> <b>Improved</b> <b>Platforms</b> For the list of 
platforms known to support Perl, see &quot;Supported Plat- forms&quot; in 
perlport. &middot; AIX dynamic loading should be now better supported. &middot; 
AIX should now work better with gcc, threads, and 64-bitness. Also the long 
doubles support in AIX should be better now. See perlaix. &middot; AtheOS ( 
http://www.atheos.cx/ ) is a new platform. &middot; BeOS has been reclaimed. 
&middot; The DG/UX platform now supports 5.005-style threads. See perldgux. 
&middot; The DYNIX/ptx platform (also known as dynixptx) is supported at or 
near osvers 4.5.2. &middot; EBCDIC platforms (z/OS (also known as OS/390), 
POSIX-BC, and VM/ESA) have been regained. Many test suite tests still fail and 
the co-existence of Unicode and EBCDIC isn&rsquo;t quite settled, but the 
situation is much better than with Perl 5.6. See perlos390, perlbs2000 (for 
POSIX-BC), and perlvmesa for more information. &middot; Building perl with 
-Duseithreads or -Duse5005threads now works under HP-UX 10.20 (previously it 
only worked under 10.30 or later). You will need a thread library package 
installed. See README.hpux. [561] &middot; Mac OS Classic is now supported in 
the mainstream source package (MacPerl has of course been available since perl 
5.004 but now the source code bases of standard Perl and MacPerl have been 
synchro- nised) [561] &middot; Mac OS X (or Darwin) should now be able to build 
Perl even on HFS+ filesystems. (The case-insensitivity used to confuse the Perl 
build process.) &middot; NCR MP-RAS is now supported. [561] &middot; All the 
NetBSD specific patches (except for the installation spe- cific ones) have been 
merged back to the main distribution. &middot; NetWare from Novell is now 
supported. See perlnetware. &middot; NonStop-UX is now supported. [561] 
&middot; NEC SUPER-UX is now supported. &middot; All the OpenBSD specific 
patches (except for the installation spe- cific ones) have been merged back to 
the main distribution. &middot; Perl has been tested with the GNU pth userlevel 
thread package ( http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/pth.html ). All thread tests 
of Perl now work, but not without adding some<i>yield()</i>s to the tests, so 
while pth (and other userlevel thread implementations) can be considered to be 
&quot;working&quot; with Perl ithreads, keep in mind the possible 
non-preemptability of the underlying thread implementa- tion. &middot; Stratus 
VOS is now supported using Perl&rsquo;s native build method (Con- figure). This 
is the recommended method to build Perl on VOS. The older methods, which build 
miniperl, are still available. See per- lvos. [561+] &middot; The Amdahl UTS 
UNIX mainframe platform is now supported. [561] &middot; WinCE is now 
supported. See perlce. &middot; z/OS (formerly known as OS/390, formerly known 
as MVS OE) now has support for dynamic loading. This is not selected by 
default, how- ever, you must specify -Dusedl in the arguments of Configure. 
[561]</pre> 
<h2>Selected Bug Fixes</h2> 
<pre> Numerous memory leaks and uninitialized memory accesses have been hunted 
down. Most importantly, anonymous subs used to leak quite a bit. [561] &middot; 
The autouse pragma didn&rsquo;t work for Multi::Part::Function::Names. &middot;
<i>caller()</i> could cause core dumps in certain situations. Carp was 
sometimes affected by this problem. In particular,<i>caller()</i> now returns a 
subroutine name of &quot;(unknown)&quot; for subroutines that have been removed 
from the symbol table. &middot; chop(@list) in list context returned the 
characters chopped in reverse order. This has been reversed to be in the right 
order. [561] &middot; Configure no longer includes the DBM libraries (dbm, 
gdbm, db, ndbm) when building the Perl binary. The only exception to this is 
SunOS 4.x, which needs them. [561] &middot; The behaviour of non-decimal but 
numeric string constants such as &quot;0x23&quot; was platform-dependent: in 
some platforms that was seen as 35, in some as 0, in some as a floating point 
number (don&rsquo;t ask). This was caused by Perl&rsquo;s using the operating 
system libraries in a situation where the result of the string to number 
conversion is undefined: now Perl consistently handles such strings as zero in 
numeric contexts. &middot; Several debugger fixes: exit code now reflects the 
script exit code, condition &quot;0&quot; now treated correctly, the 
&quot;d&quot; command now checks line number, $. no longer gets corrupted, and 
all debugger output now goes correctly to the socket if RemotePort is set. 
[561] &middot; The debugger (perl5db.pl) has been modified to present a more 
con- sistent commands interface, via (CommandSet=580). perl5db.t was also added 
to test the changes, and as a placeholder for further tests. See perldebug. 
&middot; The debugger has a new &quot;dumpDepth&quot; option to control the 
maximum depth to which nested structures are dumped. The &quot;x&quot; command 
has been extended so that &quot;x N EXPR&quot; dumps out the value of<i>EXPR</i>
 to a depth of at most<i>N</i> levels. &middot; The debugger can now show 
lexical variables if you have the CPAN module PadWalker installed. &middot; The 
order of DESTROYs has been made more predictable. &middot; Perl 5.6.0 could 
emit spurious warnings about redefinition of<i>dl</i><b>_</b><i>error()</i> 
when statically building extensions into perl. This has been corrected. [561] 
&middot; dprofpp -R didn&rsquo;t work. &middot; *foo{FORMAT} now works. 
&middot; Infinity is now recognized as a number. &middot; UNIVERSAL::isa no 
longer caches methods incorrectly. (This broke the Tk extension with 5.6.0.) 
[561] &middot; Lexicals I: lexicals outside an eval &quot;&quot; weren&rsquo;t 
resolved correctly inside a subroutine definition inside the eval &quot;&quot; 
if they were not already referenced in the top level of the eval&quot;&quot;ed 
code. &middot; Lexicals II: lexicals leaked at file scope into subroutines that 
were declared before the lexicals. &middot; Lexical warnings now propagating 
correctly between scopes and into &quot;eval &quot;...&quot;&quot;. &middot; 
&quot;use warnings qw(FATAL all)&quot; did not work as intended. This has been 
corrected. [561] &middot;<i>warnings::enabled()</i> now reports the state of 
$^W correctly if the caller isn&rsquo;t using lexical warnings. [561] &middot; 
Line renumbering with eval and &quot;#line&quot; now works. [561] &middot; 
Fixed numerous memory leaks, especially in eval &quot;&quot;. &middot; 
Localised tied variables no longer leak memory use Tie::Hash; tie my %tied_hash 
=&gt; &rsquo;Tie::StdHash&rsquo;; ... # Used to leak memory every time local() 
was called; # in a loop, this added up. local($tied_hash{Foo}) = 1; &middot; 
Localised hash elements (and %ENV) are correctly unlocalised to not exist, if 
they didn&rsquo;t before they were localised. use Tie::Hash; tie my %tied_hash 
=&gt; &rsquo;Tie::StdHash&rsquo;; ... # Nothing has set the FOO element so far 
{ local $tied_hash{FOO} = &rsquo;Bar&rsquo; } # This used to print, but not 
now. print &quot;exists!\n&quot; if exists $tied_hash{FOO}; As a side effect of 
this fix, tied hash interfaces<b>must</b> define the EXISTS and DELETE methods. 
&middot;<i>mkdir()</i> now ignores trailing slashes in the directory name, as 
man- dated by POSIX. &middot; Some versions of glibc have a broken<i>modfl()</i>
. This affects builds with &quot;-Duselongdouble&quot;. This version of Perl 
detects this broken- ness and has a workaround for it. The glibc release 2.2.2 
is known to have fixed the<i>modfl()</i> bug. &middot; Modulus of unsigned 
numbers now works (4063328477 % 65535 used to return 27406, instead of 27047). 
[561] &middot; Some &quot;not a number&quot; warnings introduced in 5.6.0 
eliminated to be more compatible with 5.005. Infinity is now recognised as a 
num- ber. [561] &middot; Numeric conversions did not recognize changes in the 
string value properly in certain circumstances. [561] &middot; Attributes (such 
as :shared) didn&rsquo;t work with<i>our()</i>. &middot; <i>our()</i> variables 
will not cause bogus &quot;Variable will not stay shared&quot; warnings. [561] 
&middot; &quot;our&quot; variables of the same name declared in two sibling 
blocks resulted in bogus warnings about &quot;redeclaration&quot; of the 
variables. The problem has been corrected. [561] &middot; pack &quot;Z&quot; 
now correctly terminates the string with &quot;\0&quot;. &middot; Fix password 
routines which in some shadow password platforms (e.g. HP-UX) caused<i>
getpwent()</i> to return every other entry. &middot; The PERL5OPT environment 
variable (for passing command line argu- ments to Perl) didn&rsquo;t work for 
more than a single group of options. [561] &middot; PERL5OPT with embedded 
spaces didn&rsquo;t work. &middot;<i>printf()</i> no longer resets the numeric 
locale to &quot;C&quot;. &middot; &quot;qw(a\\b)&quot; now parses correctly as 
&rsquo;a\\b&rsquo;: that is, as three char- acters, not four. [561] &middot;<i>
pos()</i> did not return the correct value within s///ge in earlier versions. 
This is now handled correctly. [561] &middot; Printing quads (64-bit integers) 
with printf/sprintf now works without the q L ll prefixes (assuming you are on 
a quad-capable platform). &middot; Regular expressions on references and 
overloaded scalars now work. [561+] &middot; Right-hand side magic (GMAGIC) 
could in many cases such as string concatenation be invoked too many times. 
&middot;<i>scalar()</i> now forces scalar context even when used in void 
context. &middot; SOCKS support is now much more robust. &middot;<i>sort()</i> 
arguments are now compiled in the right wantarray context (they were 
accidentally using the context of the<i>sort()</i> itself). The comparison 
block is now run in scalar context, and the argu- ments to be sorted are always 
provided list context. [561] &middot; Changed the POSIX character class 
&quot;[[:space:]]&quot; to include the (very rarely used) vertical tab 
character. Added a new POSIX-ish character class &quot;[[:blank:]]&quot; which 
stands for horizontal whites- pace (currently, the space and the tab). &middot; 
The tainting behaviour of<i>sprintf()</i> has been rationalized. It does not 
taint the result of floating point formats anymore, making the behaviour 
consistent with that of string interpolation. [561] &middot; Some cases of 
inconsistent taint propagation (such as within hash values) have been fixed. 
&middot; The RE engine found in Perl 5.6.0 accidentally pessimised certain 
kinds of simple pattern matches. These are now handled better. [561] &middot; 
Regular expression debug output (whether through &quot;use re 
&rsquo;debug&rsquo;&quot; or via &quot;-Dr&quot;) now looks better. [561] 
&middot; Multi-line matches like &quot;&quot;a\nxb\n&quot; =~ /(?!\A)x/m&quot; 
were flawed. The bug has been fixed. [561] &middot; Use of $&amp; could trigger 
a core dump under some situations. This is now avoided. [561] &middot; The 
regular expression captured submatches ($1, $2, ...) are now more consistently 
unset if the match fails, instead of leaving false data lying around in them. 
[561] &middot;<i>readline()</i> on files opened in &quot;slurp&quot; mode could 
return an extra &quot;&quot; (blank line) at the end in certain situations. 
This has been cor- rected. [561] &middot; Autovivification of symbolic 
references of special variables described in perlvar (as in 
&quot;${$num}&quot;) was accidentally disabled. This works again now. [561] 
&middot; Sys::Syslog ignored the &quot;LOG_AUTH&quot; constant. &middot; 
$AUTOLOAD,<i>sort()</i>, <i>lock()</i>, and spawning subprocesses in multiple 
threads simultaneously are now thread-safe. &middot; Tie::Array&rsquo;s SPLICE 
method was broken. &middot; Allow a read-only string on the left-hand side of a 
non-modifying tr///. &middot; If &quot;STDERR&quot; is tied, warnings caused by 
&quot;warn&quot; and &quot;die&quot; now cor- rectly pass to it. &middot; 
Several Unicode fixes. &middot; BOMs (byte order marks) at the beginning of 
Perl files (scripts, modules) should now be transparently skipped. UTF-16 and 
UCS-2 encoded Perl files should now be read cor- rectly. &middot; The character 
tables have been updated to Unicode 3.2.0. &middot; Comparing with utf8 data 
does not magically upgrade non-utf8 data into utf8. (This was a problem for 
example if you were mixing data from I/O and Unicode data: your output might 
have got magically encoded as UTF-8.) &middot; Generating illegal Unicode code 
points such as U+FFFE, or the UTF-16 surrogates, now also generates an optional 
warn- ing. &middot; &quot;IsAlnum&quot;, &quot;IsAlpha&quot;, and 
&quot;IsWord&quot; now match titlecase. &middot; Concatenation with the 
&quot;.&quot; operator or via variable inter- polation, &quot;eq&quot;, 
&quot;substr&quot;, &quot;reverse&quot;, &quot;quotemeta&quot;, the 
&quot;x&quot; operator, substitution with &quot;s///&quot;, single-quoted 
UTF-8, should now work. &middot; The &quot;tr///&quot; operator now works. Note 
that the &quot;tr///CU&quot; functionality has been removed (but see 
pack(&rsquo;U0&rsquo;, ...)). &middot; &quot;eval &quot;v200&quot;&quot; now 
works. &middot; Perl 5.6.0 parsed m/\x{ab}/ incorrectly, leading to spuri- ous 
warnings. This has been corrected. [561] &middot; Zero entries were missing 
from the Unicode classes such as &quot;IsDigit&quot;. &middot; Large unsigned 
numbers (those above 2**31) could sometimes lose their unsignedness, causing 
bogus results in arithmetic operations. [561] &middot; The Perl parser has been 
stress tested using both random input and Markov chain input and the few found 
crashes and lockups have been fixed.<b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Changes

[561] &middot; NetBSD/threads: try installing the GNU pth (should be in the 
pack- ages collection, or http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/), and Config- ure 
with -Duseithreads. &middot; NetBSD/sparc Perl now works on NetBSD/sparc. 
&middot; OS/2 Now works with usethreads (see INSTALL). [561] &middot; Solaris 
64-bitness using the Sun Workshop compiler now works. &middot; Stratus VOS The 
native build method requires at least VOS Release 14.5.0 and GNU C++/GNU Tools 
2.0.1 or later. The Perl pack function now maps overflowed values to +infinity 
and underflowed values to -infinity. &middot; Tru64 (aka Digital UNIX, aka DEC 
OSF/1) The operating system version letter now recorded in $Con- fig{osvers}. 
Allow compiling with gcc (previously explicitly for- bidden). Compiling with 
gcc still not recommended because buggy code results, even with gcc 2.95.2. 
&middot; Unicos Fixed various alignment problems that lead into core dumps 
either during build or later; no longer dies on math errors at runtime; now 
using full quad integers (64 bits), previously was using only 46 bit integers 
for speed. &middot; VMS See &quot;Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS&quot; and 
&quot;IEEE-format Floating Point Default on OpenVMS Alpha&quot; for important 
changes not otherwise listed here.<i>chdir()</i> now works better despite a CRT 
bug; now works with MULTI- PLICITY (see INSTALL); now works with Perl&rsquo;s 
malloc. The tainting of %ENV elements via &quot;keys&quot; or 
&quot;values&quot; was previously unimplemented. It now works as documented. 
The &quot;waitpid&quot; emulation has been improved. The worst bug (now fixed) 
was that a pid of -1 would cause a wildcard search of all processes on the 
system. POSIX-style signals are now emulated much better on VMS versions prior 
to 7.0. The &quot;system&quot; function and backticks operator have improved 
func- tionality and better error handling. [561] File access tests now use 
current process privileges rather than the user&rsquo;s default privileges, 
which could sometimes result in a mismatch between reported access and actual 
access. This improve- ment is only available on VMS v6.0 and later. There is a 
new &quot;kill&quot; implementation based on &quot;sys$sigprc&quot; that allows 
older VMS systems (pre-7.0) to use &quot;kill&quot; to send signals rather than 
simply force exit. This implementation also allows later systems to call 
&quot;kill&quot; from within a signal handler. Iterative logical name 
translations are now limited to 10 itera- tions in imitation of SHOW LOGICAL 
and other OpenVMS facilities. &middot; Windows &middot; Signal handling now 
works better than it used to. It is now implemented using a Windows message 
loop, and is there- fore less prone to random crashes. &middot;<i>fork()</i> 
emulation is now more robust, but still continues to have a few esoteric bugs 
and caveats. See perlfork for details. [561+] &middot; A failed (pseudo)fork 
now returns undef and sets errno to EAGAIN. [561] &middot; The following 
modules now work on Windows: ExtUtils::Embed [561] IO::Pipe IO::Poll Net::Ping 
&middot;<i>IO::File::new</i><b>_</b><i>tmpfile()</i> is no longer limited to 
32767 invo- cations per-process. &middot; Better<i>chdir()</i> return value for 
a non-existent directory. &middot; Compiling perl using the 64-bit Platform SDK 
tools is now supported. &middot; The<i>Win32::SetChildShowWindow()</i> builtin 
can be used to con- trol the visibility of windows created by child processes. 
See Win32 for details. &middot; Non-blocking waits for child processes (or 
pseudo-pro- cesses) are supported via &quot;waitpid($pid, 
&amp;POSIX::WNOHANG)&quot;. &middot; The behavior of<i>system()</i> with 
multiple arguments has been rationalized. Each unquoted argument will be 
automatically quoted to protect whitespace, and any existing whitespace in the 
arguments will be preserved. This improves the portability of system(@args) by 
avoiding the need for Win- dows &quot;cmd&quot; shell specific quoting in perl 
programs. Note that this means that some scripts that may have relied on 
earlier buggy behavior may no longer work correctly. For example, 
&quot;system(&quot;nmake /nologo&quot;, @args)&quot; will now attempt to run 
the file &quot;nmake /nologo&quot; and will fail when such a file isn&rsquo;t 
found. On the other hand, perl will now execute code such as 
&quot;system(&quot;c:/Program Files/MyApp/foo.exe&quot;, @args)&quot; 
correctly. &middot; The perl header files no longer suppress common warnings 
from the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. This means that additional warnings may 
now show up when compiling XS code. &middot; Borland C++ v5.5 is now a 
supported compiler that can build Perl. However, the generated binaries 
continue to be incompatible with those generated by the other supported 
compilers (GCC and Visual C++). [561] &middot; Duping socket handles with 
open(F, &quot;&gt;&amp;MYSOCK&quot;) now works under Windows 9x. [561] &middot; 
Current directory entries in %ENV are now correctly propa- gated to child 
processes. [561] &middot; New %ENV entries now propagate to subprocesses. [561] 
&middot;<i>Win32::GetCwd()</i> correctly returns C:\ instead of C: when at the 
drive root. Other bugs in<i>chdir()</i> and <i>Cwd::cwd()</i> have also been 
fixed. [561] &middot; The makefiles now default to the features enabled in 
ActiveState ActivePerl (a popular Win32 binary distribu- tion). [561] &middot; 
HTML files will now be installed in c:\perl\html instead of 
c:\perl\lib\pod\html &middot; REG_EXPAND_SZ keys are now allowed in registry 
settings used by perl. [561] &middot; Can now<i>send()</i> from all threads, 
not just the first one. [561] &middot; ExtUtils::MakeMaker now uses $ENV{LIB} 
to search for libraries. [561] &middot; Less stack reserved per thread so that 
more threads can run concurrently. (Still 16M per thread.) [561] &middot; 
&quot;File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir()&quot; now prefers C:/temp over /tmp (works better 
when perl is running as service). &middot; Better UNC path handling under 
ithreads. [561] &middot;<i>wait()</i>, <i>waitpid()</i>, and backticks now 
return the correct exit status under Windows 9x. [561] &middot; A socket handle 
leak in<i>accept()</i> has been fixed. [561] </pre> 
<h2>New or Changed Diagnostics</h2> 
<pre> Please see perldiag for more details. &middot; Ambiguous range in the 
transliteration operator (like a-z-9) now gives a warning. &middot; 
chdir(&quot;&quot;) and chdir(undef) now give a deprecation warning because 
they cause a possible unintentional chdir to the home directory. Say<i>chdir()
</i> if you really mean that. &middot; Two new debugging options have been 
added: if you have compiled your Perl with debugging, you can use the -DT [561] 
and -DR options to trace tokenising and to add reference counts to displaying 
vari- ables, respectively. &middot; The lexical warnings category 
&quot;deprecated&quot; is no longer a sub-cate- gory of the &quot;syntax&quot; 
category. It is now a top-level category in its own right. &middot; Unadorned<i>
dump()</i> will now give a warning suggesting to use explicit <i>CORE::dump()
</i> if that&rsquo;s what really is meant. &middot; The &quot;Unrecognized 
escape&quot; warning has been extended to include &quot;\8&quot;, 
&quot;\9&quot;, and &quot;\_&quot;. There is no need to escape any of the 
&quot;\w&quot; characters. &middot; All regular expression compilation error 
messages are now hopefully easier to understand both because the error message 
now comes before the failed regex and because the point of failure is now 
clearly marked by a &quot;&lt;-- HERE&quot; marker. &middot; Various I/O (and 
socket) functions like<i>binmode()</i>, <i>close()</i>, and so forth now more 
consistently warn if they are used illogically either on a yet unopened or on 
an already closed filehandle (or socket). &middot; Using<i>lstat()</i> on a 
filehandle now gives a warning. (It&rsquo;s a non- sensical thing to do.) 
&middot; The &quot;-M&quot; and &quot;-m&quot; options now warn if you 
didn&rsquo;t supply the module name. &middot; If you in &quot;use&quot; specify 
a required minimum version, modules match- ing the name and but not defining a 
$VERSION will cause a fatal failure. &middot; Using negative offset for<i>vec()
</i> in lvalue context is now a warnable offense. &middot; Odd number of 
arguments to overload::constant now elicits a warn- ing. &middot; Odd number of 
elements in anonymous hash now elicits a warning. &middot; The various 
&quot;opened only for&quot;, &quot;on closed&quot;, &quot;never opened&quot; 
warnings drop the &quot;main::&quot; prefix for filehandles in the 
&quot;main&quot; package, for example &quot;STDIN&quot; instead of 
&quot;main::STDIN&quot;. &middot; Subroutine prototypes are now checked more 
carefully, you may get warnings for example if you have used non-prototype 
characters. &middot; If an attempt to use a (non-blessed) reference as an array 
index is made, a warning is given. &middot; &quot;push @a;&quot; and 
&quot;unshift @a;&quot; (with no values to push or unshift) now give a warning. 
This may be a problem for generated and evaled code. &middot; If you try to 
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc a number less than 0 or larger than 255 using the 
&quot;C&quot; format you will get an optional warning. Similarly for the 
&quot;c&quot; format and a number less than -128 or more than 127. &middot; 
pack &quot;P&quot; format now demands an explicit size. &middot; unpack 
&quot;w&quot; now warns of unterminated compressed integers. &middot; Warnings 
relating to the use of PerlIO have been added. &middot; Certain regex modifiers 
such as &quot;(?o)&quot; make sense only if applied to the entire regex. You 
will get an optional warning if you try to do otherwise. &middot; Variable 
length lookbehind has not yet been implemented, trying to use it will tell 
that. &middot; Using arrays or hashes as references (e.g. 
&quot;%foo-&gt;{bar}&quot; has been deprecated for a while. Now you will get an 
optional warning. &middot; Warnings relating to the use of the new restricted 
hashes feature have been added. &middot; Self-ties of arrays and hashes are not 
supported and fatal errors will happen even at an attempt to do so. &middot; 
Using &quot;sort&quot; in scalar context now issues an optional warning. This 
didn&rsquo;t do anything useful, as the sort was not performed. &middot; Using 
the /g modifier in<i>split()</i> is meaningless and will cause a warning. 
&middot; Using<i>splice()</i> past the end of an array now causes a warning. 
&middot; Malformed Unicode encodings (UTF-8 and UTF-16) cause a lot of warn- 
ings, as does trying to use UTF-16 surrogates (which are unimple- mented). 
&middot; Trying to use Unicode characters on an I/O stream without marking the 
stream&rsquo;s encoding (using<i>open()</i> or <i>binmode()</i>) will cause 
&quot;Wide character&quot; warnings. &middot; Use of v-strings in use/require 
causes a (backward) portability warning. &middot; Warnings relating to the use 
interpreter threads and their shared data have been added.</pre> 
<h2>Changed Internals</h2> 
<pre> &middot; PerlIO is now the default. &middot; perlapi.pod (a companion to 
perlguts) now attempts to document the internal API. &middot; You can now build 
a really minimal perl called microperl. Building microperl does not require 
even running Configure; &quot;make -f Make- file.micro&quot; should be enough. 
Beware: microperl makes many assump- tions, some of which may be too bold; the 
resulting executable may crash or otherwise misbehave in wondrous ways. For 
careful hackers only. &middot; Added<i>rsignal()</i>, <i>whichsig()</i>, <i>do
</i><b>_</b><i>join()</i>, op_clear, op_null, <i>ptr</i><b>_</b><i>ta-</i> <i>
ble</i><b>_</b><i>clear()</i>, <i>ptr</i><b>_</b><i>table</i><b>_</b><i>free()
</i>, <i>sv</i><b>_</b><i>setref</i><b>_</b><i>uv()</i>, and several UTF-8 
interfaces to the publicised API. For the full list of the avail- able APIs see 
perlapi. &middot; Made possible to propagate customised exceptions via<i>croak()
</i>ing. &middot; Now xsubs can have attributes just like subs. (Well, at least 
the built-in attributes.) &middot; dTHR and djSP have been obsoleted; the 
former removed (because it&rsquo;s a no-op) and the latter replaced with dSP. 
&middot; PERL_OBJECT has been completely removed. &middot; The MAGIC constants 
(e.g. &rsquo;P&rsquo;) have been macrofied (e.g. &quot;PERL_MAGIC_TIED&quot;) 
for better source code readability and maintain- ability. &middot; The regex 
compiler now maintains a structure that identifies nodes in the compiled 
bytecode with the corresponding syntactic features of the original regex 
expression. The information is attached to the new &quot;offsets&quot; member 
of the &quot;struct regexp&quot;. See perldebguts for more complete 
information. &middot; The C code has been made much more &quot;gcc -Wall&quot; 
clean. Some warning messages still remain in some platforms, so if you are 
compiling with gcc you may see some warnings about dubious practices. The 
warnings are being worked on. &middot;<i>perly.c</i>, <i>sv.c</i>, and <i>sv.h
</i> have now been extensively commented. &middot; Documentation on how to use 
the Perl source repository has been added to<i>Porting/repository.pod</i>. 
&middot; There are now several profiling make targets.</pre> 
<h2>Security Vulnerability Closed [561]</h2> 
<pre> (This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.) (5.7.0 
came out before 5.6.1: the development branch 5.7 released ear- lier than the 
maintenance branch 5.6) A potential security vulnerability in the optional 
suidperl component of Perl was identified in August 2000. suidperl is neither 
built nor installed by default. As of November 2001 the only known vulnerable 
platform is Linux, most likely all Linux distributions. CERT and vari- ous 
vendors and distributors have been alerted about the vulnerability. See 
http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt for more 
information. The problem was caused by Perl trying to report a suspected 
security exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail. On Linux plat- 
forms the /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which when com- bined 
with suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in a serious compromise 
instead of reporting the exploit attempt. If you don&rsquo;t have /bin/mail, or 
if you have &rsquo;safe setuid scripts&rsquo;, or if suidperl is not installed, 
you are safe. The exploit attempt reporting feature has been completely removed 
from Perl 5.8.0 (and the maintenance release 5.6.1, and it was removed also 
from all the Perl 5.7 releases), so that particular vulnerability isn&rsquo;t 
there anymore. However, further security vulnerabilities are, unfortu- nately, 
always possible. The suidperl functionality is most probably going to be 
removed in Perl 5.10. In any case, suidperl should only be used by security 
experts who know exactly what they are doing and why they are using suidperl 
instead of some other solution such as sudo ( see 
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/ ).</pre> 
<h2>New Tests</h2> 
<pre> Several new tests have been added, especially for the <i>lib</i> and <i>
ext</i> sub- sections. There are now about 69 000 individual tests (spread over 
about 700 test scripts), in the regression suite (5.6.1 has about 11 700 tests, 
in 258 test scripts) The exact numbers depend on the plat- form and Perl 
configuration used. Many of the new tests are of course introduced by the new 
modules, but still in general Perl is now more thoroughly tested. Because of 
the large number of tests, running the regression suite will take considerably 
longer time than it used to: expect the suite to take up to 4-5 times longer to 
run than in perl 5.6. On a really fast machine you can hope to finish the suite 
in about 6-8 minutes (wall- clock time). The tests are now reported in a 
different order than in earlier Perls. (This happens because the test scripts 
from under t/lib have been moved to be closer to the library/extension they are 
testing.)</pre> 
<h2>Known Problems</h2> 
<pre> <b>The</b> <b>Compiler</b> <b>Suite</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Very
</b> <b>Experimental</b> The compiler suite is slowly getting better but it 
continues to be highly experimental. Use in production environments is 
discouraged.<b>Localising</b> <b>Tied</b> <b>Arrays</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hashes</b>
<b>Is</b> <b>Broken</b> local %tied_array; doesn&rsquo;t work as one would 
expect: the old value is restored incor- rectly. This will be changed in a 
future release, but we don&rsquo;t know yet what the new semantics will exactly 
be. In any case, the change will break existing code that relies on the current 
(ill-defined) semantics, so just avoid doing this in general.<b>Building</b> <b>
Extensions</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Fail</b> <b>Because</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Largefiles</b>
 Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with 
&acirc;&#128;&#152;large- files&rsquo;, a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which 
file offsets default to 64 bits wide, where supported. Modules may fail to 
compile at all, or they may compile and work incorrectly. Currently, there is 
no good solution for the problem, but Configure now provides appropriate non- 
largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs in the %Config hash (e.g., 
$Config{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the extensions that are having problems can 
try configuring themselves without the largefileness. This is admittedly not a 
clean solution, and the solution may not even work at all. One potential 
failure is whether one can (or, if one can, whether it&rsquo;s a good idea to) 
link together at all binaries with differ- ent ideas about file offsets; all 
this is platform-dependent.<b>Modifying</b> <b>$_</b> <b>Inside</b> <b>for(..)
</b> for (1..5) { $_++ } works without complaint. It shouldn&rsquo;t. (You 
should be able to modify only lvalue elements inside the loops.) You can see 
the correct behaviour by replacing the 1..5 with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<b>mod_perl</b> 
<b>1.26</b> <b>Doesn</b>&acirc;&#128;<b>&acirc;</b>&#128;&#153;<b>t</b> <b>Build

INSTALL instead.<b>libwww-perl</b> <b>(LWP)</b> <b>fails</b> <b>base/date</b> 
<b>#51</b> Use libwww-perl 5.65 or later. <b>PDL</b> <b>failing</b> <b>some</b> 
<b>tests</b> Use PDL 2.3.4 or later. <b>Perl_get_sv</b> You may get errors like 
&rsquo;Undefined symbol &quot;Perl_get_sv&quot;&rsquo; or &quot;can&rsquo;t 
resolve symbol &rsquo;Perl_get_sv&rsquo;&quot;, or the symbol may be 
&quot;Perl_sv_2pv&quot;. This probably means that you are trying to use an 
older shared Perl library (or extensions linked with such) with Perl 5.8.0 
executable. Perl used to have such a subroutine, but that is no more the case. 
Check your shared library path, and any shared Perl libraries in those 
directories. Sometimes this problem may also indicate a partial Perl 5.8.0 
installa- tion, see &quot;Mac OS X dyld undefined symbols&quot; for an example 
and how to deal with it.<b>Self-tying</b> <b>Problems</b> Self-tying of arrays 
and hashes is broken in rather deep and hard-to- fix ways. As a stop-gap 
measure to avoid people from getting frus- trated at the mysterious results 
(core dumps, most often), it is for- bidden for now (you will get a fatal error 
even from an attempt). A change to self-tying of globs has caused them to be 
recursively ref- erenced (see: &quot;Two-Phased Garbage Collection&quot; in 
perlobj). You will now need an explicit untie to destroy a self-tied glob. This 
behaviour may be fixed at a later date. Self-tying of scalars and IO thingies 
works.<b>ext/threads/t/libc</b> If this test fails, it indicates that your libc 
(C library) is not threadsafe. This particular test stress tests the<i>
localtime()</i> call to find out whether it is threadsafe. See perlthrtut for 
more informa- tion.<b>Failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thread</b> <b>(5.005-style)</b>

</b> <b>migrate</b> <b>your</b> <b>code</b> <b>to</b> <b>ithreads.</b> The 
following tests are known to fail due to fundamental problems in the 5.005 
threading implementation. These are not new failures--Perl 5.005_0x has the 
same bugs, but didn&rsquo;t have these tests. ../ext/B/t/xref.t 255 65280 14 12

as 5.005-style threads are considered fundamentally broken. (Basically what 
happens is that com- peting threads can corrupt shared global state, one good 
example being regular expression engine&rsquo;s state.)<b>Timing</b> <b>problems
</b> The following tests may fail intermittently because of timing problems, 
for example if the system is heavily loaded. t/op/alarm.t 
ext/Time/HiRes/HiRes.t lib/Benchmark.t lib/Memoize/t/expmod_t.t 
lib/Memoize/t/speed.t In case of failure please try running them manually, for 
example ./perl -Ilib ext/Time/HiRes/HiRes.t<b>Tied/Magical</b> <b>Array/Hash</b>
<b>Elements</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Autovivify</b> For normal arrays 
&quot;$foo = \$bar[1]&quot; will assign &quot;undef&quot; to $bar[1] (assuming 
that it didn&rsquo;t exist before), but for tied/magical arrays and hashes such 
autovivification does not happen because there is currently no way to catch the 
reference creation. The same problem affects slic- ing over non-existent 
indices/keys of a tied/magical array/hash.<b>Unicode</b> <b>in</b> <b>
package/class</b> <b>and</b> <b>subroutine</b> <b>names</b> <b>does</b> <b>not
</b> <b>work</b> One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in 
package/class or subroutine names. While some limited functionality towards 
this does exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of 
Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported. One reason of this unfinishedness 
is its (currently) inherent unporta- bility: since both package names and 
subroutine names may need to be mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode 
capability of the filesystem becomes important-- and there unfortunately 
aren&rsquo;t portable answers.</pre> 
<h2>Platform Specific Problems</h2> 
<pre> <b>AIX</b> &middot; If using the AIX native make command, instead of 
just &quot;make&quot; issue &quot;make all&quot;. In some setups the former has 
been known to spuriously also try to run &quot;make install&quot;. 
Alternatively, you may want to use GNU make. &middot; In AIX 4.2, Perl 
extensions that use C++ functions that use statics may have problems in that 
the statics are not getting initialized. In newer AIX releases, this has been 
solved by linking Perl with the libC_r library, but unfortunately in AIX 4.2 
the said library has an obscure bug where the various functions related to time 
(such as<i>time()</i> and <i>gettimeofday()</i>) return broken values, and 
therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is not linked against libC_r. &middot; vac 5.0.0.0 
May Produce Buggy Code For Perl The AIX C compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may 
produce buggy code, resulting in a few random tests failing when run as part of 
&quot;make test&quot;, but when the failing tests are run by hand, they 
succeed. We suggest upgrading to at least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been 
known to compile Perl correctly. &quot;lslpp -L&acirc;&#148;&#130;grep 
vac.C&quot; will tell you the vac version. See README.aix. &middot; If building 
threaded Perl, you may get compilation warning from pp_sys.c: 
&quot;pp_sys.c&quot;, line 4651.39: 1506-280 (W) Function argument assignment 
between types &quot;unsigned char*&quot; and &quot;const void*&quot; is not 
allowed. This is harmless; it is caused by the<i>getnetbyaddr()</i> and <i>
getnet-</i> <i>byaddr</i><b>_</b><i>r()</i> having slightly different types for 
their first argu- ment.<b>Alpha</b> <b>systems</b> <b>with</b> <b>old</b> <b>
gccs</b> <b>fail</b> <b>several</b> <b>tests</b> If you see op/pack, op/pat, 
op/regexp, or ext/Storable tests failing in a Linux/alpha or *BSD/Alpha, 
it&rsquo;s probably time to upgrade your gcc. gccs prior to 2.95.3 are 
definitely not good enough, and gcc 3.1 may be even better. (RedHat Linux/alpha 
with gcc 3.1 reported no problems, as did Linux 2.4.18 with gcc 2.95.4.) (In 
Tru64, it is preferable to use the bundled C compiler.)<b>AmigaOS</b> Perl 
5.8.0 doesn&rsquo;t build in AmigaOS. It broke at some point during the 
ithreads work and we could not find Amiga experts to unbreak the prob- lems. 
Perl 5.6.1 still works for AmigaOS (as does the the 5.7.2 devel- opment 
release).<b>BeOS</b> The following tests fail on 5.8.0 Perl in BeOS Personal

message saying &quot;unable to remap&quot;. This is known problem with Cygwin, 
and a workaround is detailed in here: http://sources.red-

build of) the NDBM_File on FAT filesystems. Installation (or build) on NTFS 
works fine. If one attempts the test on a FAT install (or build) the following 
failures are expected: ../ext/NDBM_File/ndbm.t 13 3328 71 59 83.10% 1-2 4 16-71

FAT (or if using AnyDBM_File on FAT), run Configure with the -Ui_ndbm and 
-Ui_dbm options to prevent NDBM_File and ODBM_File being built.<b>DJGPP</b> <b>

</i><b>_</b><i>r()</i>, it has been fixed in FreeBSD 4.6 (see perlfreebsd 
(README.freebsd)).<b>FreeBSD</b> <b>Failing</b> <b>locale</b> <b>Test</b> <b>117
</b> <b>For</b> <b>ISO</b> <b>8859-15</b> <b>Locales</b> The ISO 8859-15 
locales may fail the locale test 117 in FreeBSD. This is caused by the 
characters \xFF (y with diaeresis) and \xBE (Y with diaeresis) not behaving 
correctly when being matched case-insensi- tively. Apparently this problem has 
been fixed in the latest FreeBSD releases. ( 
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=34308 )<b>IRIX</b> <b>fails</b> <b>
ext/List/Util/t/shuffle.t</b> <b>or</b> <b>Digest::MD5</b> IRIX with MIPSpro 
7.3.1.2m or 7.3.1.3m compiler may fail the List::Util test 
ext/List/Util/t/shuffle.t by dumping core. This seems to be a compiler error 
since if compiled with gcc no core dump ensues, and no failures have been seen 
on the said test on any other platform. Similarly, building the Digest::MD5 
extension has been known to fail with &quot;*** Termination code 139 
(bu21)&quot;. The cure is to drop optimization level (Configure -Doptimize=-O2).
<b>HP-UX</b> <b>lib/posix</b> <b>Subtest</b> <b>9</b> <b>Fails</b> <b>When</b> 
<b>LP64-Configured</b> If perl is configured with -Duse64bitall, the successful 
result of the subtest 10 of lib/posix may arrive before the successful result 
of the subtest 9, which confuses the test harness so much that it thinks the 
subtest 9 failed.<b>Linux</b> <b>with</b> <b>glibc</b> <b>2.2.5</b> <b>fails</b>
<b>t/op/int</b> <b>subtest</b> <b>#6</b> <b>with</b> <b>-Duse64bitint</b> This

2.01% 61 63 65 If you are building on a UFS partition, you will also probably 
see t/op/stat.t subtest #9 fail. This is caused by Darwin&rsquo;s UFS not sup- 
porting inode change time. Also the ext/POSIX/t/posix.t subtest #10 fails but 
it is skipped for now because the failure is Apple&rsquo;s fault, not 
Perl&rsquo;s (blocked signals are lost). If you Configure with ithreads, 
ext/threads/t/libc.t will fail. Again, this is not Perl&rsquo;s fault-- the 
libc of Mac OS X is not threadsafe (in this particular test, the<i>localtime()
</i> call is found to be threadun- safe.) <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>X</b> <b>dyld

getting warnings about missing symbols, for example dyld: perl Undefined 
symbols _perl_sv_2pv _perl_get_sv you probably have an old pre-Perl-5.8.0 
installation (or parts of one) in /Library/Perl (the undefined symbols used to 
exist in pre-5.8.0 Perls). It seems that for some reason &quot;make 
install&quot; doesn&rsquo;t always completely overwrite the files in 
/Library/Perl. You can move the old Perl shared library out of the way like 
this: cd /Library/Perl/darwin/CORE mv libperl.dylib libperlold.dylib and then 
reissue &quot;make install&quot;. Note that the above of course is extremely 
disruptive for anything using the /usr/local/bin/perl. If that doesn&rsquo;t 
help, you may have to try removing all the .bundle files from beneath 
/Library/Perl, and again &quot;make install&quot;-ing.<b>OS/2</b> <b>Test</b>

sfio, and Compaq/Tandem&rsquo;s NonStop-UX. Test 91 is known to fail on QNX6 
(nto), because &quot;sprintf &rsquo;%e&rsquo;,0&quot; incor- rectly produces 
0.000000e+0 instead of 0.000000e+00. For tests 129 and 130, the failing 
platforms do not comply with the ANSI C Standard: lines 19ff on page 134 of 
ANSI X3.159 1989, to be exact. (They produce something other than &quot;1&quot; 
and &quot;-1&quot; when formatting 0.6 and -0.6 using the printf format 
&quot;%.0f&quot;; most often, they produce &quot;0&quot; and &quot;-0&quot;.)<b>

serious but as of yet unsolved. It points at some prob- lems with the 
signedness handling of the C compiler, as do the 64bitint, arith, and pow 
failures. Most of the rest point at problems with SysV IPC.<b>Term::ReadKey</b>

switch yylook 79bad switch yylook 79#ifdef A29K ^ CC-65 cc: ERROR File = try.c, 
Line = 3 A semicolon is expected at this point. This is caused by a bug in the 
awk utility of UNICOS/mk. You can ignore the error, but it does cause a slight 
problem: you cannot fully benefit from the h2ph utility (see h2ph) that can be 
used to convert C headers to Perl libraries, mainly used to be able to access 
from Perl the constants defined using C preprocessor, cpp. Because of the above 
error, parts of the converted headers will be invisible. Luckily, these days 
the need for h2ph is rare. &middot; If building Perl with interpreter threads 
(ithreads), the<i>get-</i> <i>grent()</i>, <i>getgrnam()</i>, and <i>getgrgid()
</i> functions cannot return the list of the group members due to a bug in the 
multithreaded support of UNICOS/mk. What this means is that in list context the 
func- tions will return only three values, not four.<b>UTS</b> There are a few 
known test failures, see perluts (README.uts).<b>VOS</b> <b>(Stratus)</b> When 
Perl is built using the native build process on VOS Release 14.5.0 and GNU

problems in the USS (UDP sockets and printf formats). The pat, tr, and fold 
failures are genuine Perl prob- lems caused by EBCDIC (and in the pat and fold 
cases, combining that with Unicode). The Constant and Embed are probably 
problems in the tests (since they test Perl&rsquo;s ability to build 
extensions, and that seems to be working reasonably well.)<b>Unicode</b> <b>
Support</b> <b>on</b> <b>EBCDIC</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Spotty</b> Though mostly 
working, Unicode support still has problem spots on EBCDIC platforms. One such 
known spot are the &quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\P{}&quot; regu- lar expression 
constructs for code points less than 256: the &quot;pP&quot; are testing for 
Unicode code points, not knowing about EBCDIC.<b>Seen</b> <b>In</b> <b>Perl</b> 
<b>5.7</b> <b>But</b> <b>Gone</b> <b>Now</b> &quot;Time::Piece&quot; 
(previously known as &quot;Time::Object&quot;) was removed because it was felt 
that it didn&rsquo;t have enough value in it to be a core module. It is still a 
useful module, though, and is available from the CPAN. Perl 5.8 unfortunately 
does not build anymore on AmigaOS; this broke accidentally at some point. Since 
there are not that many Amiga devel- opers available, we could not get this 
fixed and tested in time for 5.8.0. Perl 5.6.1 still works for AmigaOS (as does 
the the 5.7.2 development release). The &quot;PerlIO::Scalar&quot; and 
&quot;PerlIO::Via&quot; (capitalised) were renamed as 
&quot;PerlIO::scalar&quot; and &quot;PerlIO::via&quot; (all lowercase) just 
before 5.8.0. The main rationale was to have all core PerlIO layers to have all 
low- ercase names. The &quot;plugins&quot; are named as usual, for example 
&quot;Per- lIO::via::QuotedPrint&quot;. The &quot;threads::shared::queue&quot; 
and &quot;threads::shared::semaphore&quot; were renamed as 
&quot;Thread::Queue&quot; and &quot;Thread::Semaphore&quot; just before 5.8.0. 
The main rationale was to have thread modules to obey normal naming, 
&quot;Thread::&quot; (the &quot;threads&quot; and &quot;threads::shared&quot; 
themselves are more pragma-like, they affect compile-time, so they stay 
lowercase).</pre>
