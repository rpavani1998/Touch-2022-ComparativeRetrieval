<p>Fast food is cheap, convenient, filling, and to many of us it tastes good. 
&nbsp;If you are eating out, a fast food restaurant is often the cheapest 
option, but unfortunately not a healthy one.&nbsp; Eating just one fast food 
meal can pack enough calories, sodium, and fat for an entire day or more. 
Eating fast food on a regular basis can lead to a host of different health 
problems, both physical and psychological.</p> 
<p>Still, in a bad economy the quick-and-cheap temptation can often be hard to 
resist. As an informed customer, though, you can make healthier choices and 
still enjoy the price and convenience of fast food restaurants.</p> <br>

<h2>When is it healthy to eat fast food?</h2> 
<p>The short answer is: rarely. Typically, fast food is low in nutrition and 
high in trans fat, saturated fat, sodium, and calories. Some examples:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>One sack of &ldquo;hash bites&rdquo; or &ldquo;potato snackers&rdquo; from 
White Castle, for example, contains 10 grams of very unhealthy trans fat. The 
American Heart Association recommends we consume less than 2 grams of trans fat 
per day. So in one side order, you&rsquo;ve just eaten more than five 
days&rsquo; worth of heart-busting trans fat!</li> 
<li>A single meal of a Double Whopper with cheese, a medium order of fries, 
and an apple pie from Burger King contains more saturated fat than the American 
Heart Association recommends we consume in<strong>two</strong> days. </li> </ul>
<p>Moderation becomes the key. It&rsquo;s OK to indulge a craving for French 
fries every now and then, but to stay healthy you can&rsquo;t make it a regular 
habit. Finding a healthy, well-balanced meal in most fast food restaurants can 
be a challenge, but there are always choices you can make that are healthier 
than others.</p> 
<h2>Learning to make healthier choices at fast food restaurants </h2> 
<p> Making healthier choices at fast food restaurants is easier if you prepare 
ahead by checking guides that show you the nutritional content of meal choices 
at your favorite restaurants. Free downloadable guides help you evaluate your 
options. If you have a special dietary concern, such as diabetes, heart health 
or weight loss, the websites of national non-profits provide useful advice. You 
can also choose to patronize restaurants that focus on natural, high quality 
food.</p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t prepare ahead of time, common sense guidelines help to 
make your meal healthier. For example, a seemingly healthy salad can be a diet 
minefield when smothered in high-fat dressing and fried toppings, so choose a 
salad with fresh veggies, grilled toppings, and a lighter dressing. Portion 
control is also important, as many fast food restaurants serve enough food for 
several meals in the guise of a single serving.</p> 
<h3>Tips for making healthy choices at fast food restaurants</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Make careful menu selections &ndash; pay attention to the 
descriptions on the menu.</strong>Dishes labeled deep-fried, pan-fried, basted, 
batter-dipped, breaded, creamy, crispy, scalloped, Alfredo, au gratin, or in 
cream sauce are usually high in calories, unhealthy fats, or sodium. Order 
items with more vegetables and choose leaner meats.</li> 
<li><strong>Drink water with your meal.</strong> Soda is a huge source of 
hidden calories. One 32-oz Big Gulp of regular cola packs about 425 calories, 
which can quickly gulp up a big portion of your daily calorie intake. Try 
adding a little lemon to your water or ordering unsweetened iced tea.</li> 
<li><strong>&ldquo;Undress&rdquo; your food.</strong> When choosing items, be 
aware of calorie- and fat-packed salad dressings, spreads, cheese, sour cream, 
etc. For example, ask for a grilled chicken sandwich without the mayonnaise. 
You can ask for a packet of ketchup or mustard and add it yourself, controlling 
how much you put on your sandwich.</li> 
<li><strong>Special order. </strong>Many menu items would be healthy if it 
weren't for the way they were prepared. Ask for your vegetables and main dishes 
to be served without the sauces. Ask for olive oil and vinegar for your salads 
or order the dressing &quot;on the side&quot; and spoon only a small amount on 
at a time. If your food is fried or cooked in oil or butter, ask to have it 
broiled or steamed.</li> 
<li><strong>Eat mindfully. </strong>Pay attention to what you eat and savor 
each bite. Chew your food more thoroughly and avoid eating on the run. Being 
mindful also means stopping before you are full. It takes time for your body to 
register that you have eaten. Mindful eating relaxes you, so you digest better, 
and makes you feel more satisfied.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Tips for what to AVOID at fast food restaurants</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Supersized portions. </strong>An average fast food meal can run to 
1000 calories or more, so choose a smaller portion size, order a side salad 
instead of fries, and don't supersize anything. At a typical restaurant, a 
single serving provides enough for two meals. Take half home or divide the 
portion with a dining partner.</li> 
<li><strong>Salt.</strong> Fast food restaurant food tends to be very high in 
sodium, a major contributor to high blood pressure. Don&rsquo;t add insult to 
injury by adding more salt.</li> 
<li><strong>Bacon</strong>. It&rsquo;s always tempting to add bacon to 
sandwiches and salads for extra flavor, but bacon has very few nutrients and is 
high in fat and calories.&nbsp;Instead, try ordering extra pickles, onions, 
lettuce, tomatoes, or mustard to add flavor without the fat.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Buffets</strong> <strong>&ndash; even seemingly healthy ones like 
salad bars.</strong> You'll likely overeat to get your money's worth. If you do 
choose buffet dining, opt for fresh fruits, salads with olive oil &amp; vinegar 
or low-fat dressings, broiled entrees, and steamed vegetables. Resist the 
temptation to go for seconds, or wait at least 20 minutes after eating to make 
sure you're really still hungry before going back for more.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Watch your fast food sodium intake</h3> 
<p> High salt/sodium intake is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. 
The American Heart Association recommends that adults stay under 1500 mg of 
sodium per day, and never take in more than 2,300 mg a day. A study by the New 
York City Health Department surveyed 6,580 meals bought at fast-food restaurant 
chains and found that:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> About 57% of the meals exceeded the 1,500-mg daily sodium level.</li> 
<li> Fried chicken outlets including KFC and Popeye's were the worst 
offenders, with 83% of meals exceeding 1500 mg of sodium and 55% of the meals 
surpassing 2,300 mg of sodium.</li> 
<li> At only one of the 11 chains included in the study, Au Bon Pain, did more 
than 7% of meals contain less than 600 mg, the FDA&rsquo;s &quot;healthy&quot; 
sodium level for meals. But even there, 46% of meals had 1,500 mg or more of 
sodium.</li> 
<li> Even those eating lower calorie meals were likely to exceed their daily 
sodium limit within a single meal.</li> </ul>

<h2>Guides can help you make healthier meal choices</h2> 
<p>Many fast food chains post nutritional information on their websites. 
Unfortunately, these lists are often confusing and hard to use. Instead, you 
can go to other websites that provide health and nutrition information, but in 
easier to follow formats. Some publish downloadable comparison guides, 
inexpensive pocket guides, or mobile apps for your smart phone. There are also 
many websites geared towards making healthy choices at restaurants depending on 
your specific dietary needs, whether your concern is diabetes, cancer, heart 
disease, or weight management.</p> 
<p>See Resources and References section below for more information on finding 
guides to help you make healthier meal choices.</p> 
<h2>Healthier fast food at burger chains </h2> 
<p>Figuring out healthier options at your favorite fast food burger chain can 
be tricky. A typical meal at a burger joint consists of a &quot;sandwich&quot;, 
some fries, and a drink, which can quickly come in at over 1700 calories for 
something like Burger King's Triple Whopper with a large fries and a 16 oz. 
soda. A better option would be a regular single patty burger, small fries, and 
water, which is about 500 calories. Alternatively you may enjoy a veggie burger 
smothered in grilled onion and mushrooms. Or if you want a large beef burger, 
then skip the fries and soda and have a side salad and water instead.</p> 
<h3>The Big Burger Chains</h3> 
<p><strong>Less Healthy choices</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li> Double-patty hamburger with cheese, mayo, special sauce, and bacon</li> 
<li> Fried chicken sandwich</li> 
<li> Fried fish sandwich</li> 
<li> Salad with toppings such as bacon, cheese, and ranch dressing</li> 
<li> Breakfast burrito with steak</li> 
<li> French fries</li> 
<li> Milkshake</li> 
<li> Chicken &ldquo;nuggets&rdquo; or tenders</li> 
<li> Adding cheese, extra mayo, and special sauces</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Healthier choices</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li> Regular, single-patty hamburger without mayo or cheese</li> 
<li> Grilled chicken sandwich</li> 
<li> Veggie burger</li> 
<li> Garden salad with grilled chicken and low-fat dressing</li> 
<li> Egg on a muffin</li> 
<li> Baked potato or a side salad</li> 
<li> Yogurt parfait</li> 
<li> Grilled chicken strips</li> 
<li> Limiting cheese, mayo, and special sauces</li> </ol> <br>
<br>

<h3>For a healthier fast food option at a burger restaurant try:</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> McDonald's Hamburger: 260 calories, 9g fat (3.5g saturated fat). </li> 
<li>Wendy's Jr. Hamburger:&nbsp; 280 calories, 9g fat (3.5g saturated fat). 
</li> </ul> 
<h2>Healthier fast food at fried chicken chains</h2> 
<p>Although certain chains have been advertising &ldquo;no trans fats&rdquo; 
in their food, the fact is that fried chicken can pack quite a fattening punch. 
According to the restaurant&rsquo;s nutrition info, just a single Extra Crispy 
Chicken breast at KFC has a whopping 440 calories, 27 grams of fat, and 970 mg 
of sodium. A healthier choice is the drumstick, which has 160 calories, 10 
grams of fat, and 370 mg of sodium. Alternatively, if you like the breast meat, 
take off the skin and it becomes a healthy choice at 140 calories, 2 grams of 
fat, and 520 mg of sodium.</p> 
<p> Some tips for making smarter choices at fast food chicken restaurants:</p> 
<h3>The Big Fried Chicken Chains</h3> 
<p><strong>Less healthy choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Fried chicken, original or extra-crispy. </li> 
<li>Teriyaki wings or popcorn chicken </li> 
<li>Caesar salad </li> 
<li>Chicken and biscuit &ldquo;bowl&rdquo; </li> 
<li>Adding extra gravy and sauces</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Healthier choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li>Skinless chicken breast without breading </li> 
<li>Honey BBQ chicken sandwich </li> 
<li>Garden salad </li> 
<li>Mashed potatoes </li> 
<li>Limiting gravy and sauces</li> </ol> <br>
<br>

<h3>For a healthier fast food option at a fried chicken restaurant try:</h3> 
<p>KFC Original Recipe Chicken Breast (with breading and skin removed) and a 
side of green beans: 190 calories, 4.5g fat (1.5g saturated fat).</p> 
<h2>Healthy fast food: Mexican chains </h2> 
<p>Fast food chains that specialize in tacos or burritos can be caloric 
minefields or they can be a good option for finding healthy fast food. Rice, 
beans, salsa, and a few slices of fresh avocado can make a very healthy meal. 
But adding cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips can turn even a good meal 
into an unhealthy one. Also, it&rsquo;s very important to remember portion 
control in these types of restaurants, as many offer enormous serving sizes. 
Simply eat half and take the rest home for another meal.</p> 
<p> Several chains, like Taco Bell and Baja Fresh, have &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; 
menu options that feature less fat and fresher ingredients.</p> 
<h3>The Big Taco Chains </h3> 
<p><strong>Less healthy choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Crispy shell chicken taco</li> 
<li> Refried beans</li> 
<li>Steak chalupa</li> 
<li>Crunch wraps or gordita-type burritos</li> 
<li> Nachos with refried beans</li> 
<li> Adding sour cream or cheese</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Healthier choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Grilled chicken soft taco</li> 
<li> Black beans</li> 
<li> Shrimp ensalada</li> 
<li> Grilled &ldquo;fresco&rdquo; style steak burrito</li> 
<li> Veggie and bean burrito</li> 
<li>Limiting sour cream or cheese</li> </ol> <br>
<br>

<h3>For a healthier fast food option at a Mexican restaurant try:</h3> 
<p>Taco Bell Taco Salad (without the shell, sour cream, or cheese): 330 
calories, 13g fat (5g saturated fat)&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Healthy fast food: Sub sandwich chains</h2> 
<p>Many of us love the many different types of sandwiches available: hot, 
cold, wrapped, foot long&mdash;often served with a salad instead of fries. 
While their ads promote the health benefits of sandwich shops, studies have 
found that many people eat more calories per meal at a sub shop than at 
McDonalds. This may be because people feel so virtuous eating 
&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; as the ads suggest, they reward themselves with chips, 
sodas, or extra condiments that can turn a healthy meal into an unhealthy one.
</p> 
<p>You can make healthier choices at a deli or sub shop but you need to use 
some common sense.</p> 
<h3>Subs, Sandwich and Deli Choices</h3> 
<p><strong>Less healthy choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Foot-long sub</li> 
<li> High-fat meat such as ham, tuna salad, bacon, meatballs, or steak</li> 
<li>The &ldquo;normal&rdquo; amount of higher-fat (cheddar, American) cheese
</li> 
<li> Adding mayo and special sauces</li> 
<li> Keeping the sub &ldquo;as is&rdquo; with all toppings</li> 
<li>Choosing white bread or &ldquo;wraps&rdquo; which are often higher in fat 
than normal bread</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Healthier choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Six-inch sub</li> 
<li> Lean meat (roast beef, chicken breast, lean ham) or veggies</li> 
<li> One or two slices of lower-fat cheese (Swiss or mozzarella)</li> 
<li> Adding low-fat dressing or mustard instead of mayo</li> 
<li> Adding extra veggie toppings</li> 
<li> Choosing whole-grain bread or taking the top slice off your sub and 
eating it open-faced</li> </ol> <br>
<br>

<h3>For a healthier fast food option at a sub sandwich restaurant try:</h3> 
<p>Subway 6&quot; Roast Beef Sub (on whole wheat bread with veggies, no 
mayo):&nbsp; 290 calories, 5g fat (2g saturated fat)</p> 
<h2>Healthy Asian food</h2> 
<p>Asian cultures tend to eat healthily, with an emphasis on veggies and with 
meat used as a &ldquo;condiment&rdquo; rather than the focus of the meal. 
Unfortunately, many Western versions of these ethnic foods tend to be much 
higher in fat and calories &ndash; so caution is needed. A great tip for all 
Asian restaurants &ndash; use the chopsticks! You&rsquo;ll eat more slowly, 
since you can&rsquo;t grasp as much food with them at one time as you can with 
your normal fork and knife.</p> 
<h3>Asian Food Choices </h3> 
<p><strong>Less healthy choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Fried egg rolls, spare ribs, tempura</li> 
<li> Battered or deep-fried dishes (sweet and sour pork, General Tso&rsquo;s 
chicken)</li> 
<li> Deep-fried tofu</li> 
<li> Coconut milk, sweet and sour sauce, regular soy sauce</li> 
<li> Fried rice</li> 
<li> Salads with fried or crispy noodles</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Healthier choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Egg drop, miso, wonton, or hot &amp; sour soup</li> 
<li> Stir-fried, steamed, roasted or broiled entrees (shrimp chow mein, chop 
suey)</li> 
<li> Steamed or baked tofu</li> 
<li> Sauces such as ponzu, rice-wine vinegar, wasabi, ginger, and low-sodium 
soy sauce</li> 
<li> Steamed brown rice</li> 
<li> Edamame, cucumber salad, stir-fried veggies</li> </ol> <br>
<br>

<h3>For a healthier fast food option at a Chinese restaurant try:</h3> 
<p>Panda Express Tangy Shrimp with a side of mixed veggies: 260 calories, 7.5 
g fat (1.5g saturated fat).</p> 
<h2>Healthy Italian fast food </h2> 
<p>The anti-carbohydrate revolution has given Italian food a bad rap, but 
Italian is actually one of the easiest types of cuisine to make healthy. Stay 
away from fried, oily, or overly buttery food, as well as thick crust menu 
items, and you can keep your diet goals intact.</p> 
<p>Watch out for the following terms, which are common sources of high fat and 
calories: Alfredo, carbonara, saltimbocca, Parmigiana, lasagna, manicotti, 
stuffed (all have heavy amounts of cream and cheese). Generally Italian places 
have lots of veggies in their kitchen so it&rsquo;s easy to ask to have extra 
veggies added to your meal.</p> 
<h3>Italian and Pizza Restaurant Choices</h3> 
<p><strong>Less healthy choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Thick-crust or butter-crust pizza with extra cheese and meat toppings</li>
<li> Garlic bread</li> 
<li> Antipasto with meat</li> 
<li> Pasta with cream or butter-based sauce</li> 
<li> Entr&eacute;e with side of pasta</li> 
<li>Fried (&ldquo;frito&rdquo;) dishes</li> </ol> 
<p><strong>Healthier choices</strong> </p> 
<ol> 
<li> Thin-crust pizza with half the cheese and extra veggies</li> 
<li> Plain rolls or breadsticks</li> 
<li> Antipasto with vegetables</li> 
<li> Pasta with tomato sauce and veggies</li> 
<li> Entr&eacute;e with side of veggies</li> 
<li> Grilled (&ldquo;griglia&rdquo;) dishes</li> </ol> <br>
<br>

<h3>For a healthier fast food option at a pizza restaurant try:</h3> 
<p> Pizza Hut Fit 'N Delicious Chicken &amp; Veggie Pizza (2 slices):&nbsp; 
208 calories, 9g fat (4g saturated fat)</p> 
<h2>Chains with natural, high-quality fast food </h2> 
<p>Whether you choose to eat fast food at a McDonald&rsquo;s, a Subway, or a 
local deli, there are always menu choices that are healthier than others. 
However, some fast food restaurants offer a greater variety of healthy menu 
choices than others. In a recent survey of the 100 largest fast food chains in 
America,<strong>Health magazine</strong> compiled a list of the healthiest fast 
food restaurants. The top 5 were:</p> 
<p>Panera Bread &ndash; provides a wide variety of healthy menu options, 
half-sized portions, and organic chicken. Plenty of healthy choices on the 
kids&rsquo; menu, too, but avoid the sticky buns on display at the counter.</p> 
<p>Jason&rsquo;s Deli &ndash; uses organic ingredients and encourages portion 
control by offering smaller meals at a discounted price. Beware of the sodium 
content of their sandwiches, though.</p> 
<p>Au Bon Pain &ndash; serves healthy, low calories soups, salads, and 
sandwiches using whole grains and organic chicken. Nutritional information is 
posted at each restaurant, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to check the sodium 
content before ordering.</p> 
<p>Noodles and Company &ndash; cooks noodle bowls using healthy Soybean oil, 
fresh vegetables and organic meat and tofu. The desserts, however, are much 
less healthy.</p> 
<p>Corner Bakery and Caf&eacute; &ndash; offers healthy breakfast choices, 
plus healthy salads, sandwiches, and soup. Check their website for nutritional 
information first, though, as it&rsquo;s not available in the restaurants.</p>
