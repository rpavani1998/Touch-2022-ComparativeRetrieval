<h1>How to do a family meal makeover</h1> Posted on April 8, 2011 by Sucheta 
<br> 
<p>More and more families are choosing to cook at home due to health and cost 
factors. It is no surprise that home cooked food is comparatively healthier 
because you know exactly what you put in it (hopefully not preserved and canned 
items.) Also, it&rsquo;s much cheaper than ordering in, especially for 2+ 
people households. The challenge families&rsquo; face is how to keep the same 
homemade recipes interesting and appealing to the entire family, young and old.
</p> 
<h3>Here are some simple recommendations to make a typical family meal 
makeover &ndash;</h3> 
<p>1. Make it healthier by using substitutes like olive oil instead of butter 
or vegetable oil, wheat flour instead of white, low fat cheeses, etc. Always 
use fresh herbs, garlic and spices to make the dish more flavorful. Avoid 
recipes that are deep fried. You know what&rsquo;s not food for you!</p> 
<p>2. Create the interest by blending flavors across cuisines. Grab a starch 
from one country and add a sauce from another. Try a thai red curry with penne 
pasta, then add shrimp or chicken depending on what your family prefers. Top 
chicken tikka masala on a flat bread or pizza. Serve a gazpacho with shells or 
macaroni pasta for a delicious &amp; healthy meal.Read more on fusion cooking.
</p> 
<p>3. Presentation is key. We tend to judge a book by its cover and perceive 
the flavor of the food by its looks. Try to plate the food like you would see 
in an expensive restaurant. It doesn&rsquo;t take much, just a garnish of 
cheese or parsley for most dishes would do. You can also control the portions 
your family is eating by pre plating them.</p> 
<p>The way you go about doing this each night is by being conscious 
and&nbsp;creative. Try to diversity with what you know rather than trying new 
complicated recipes. For example, you need not serve the same old spaghetti 
with marinara. Add some fresh tomatoes, green onions, olives, feta and make 
your own instant sauce. Have the kids pitch in while cooking and make something 
using some of the ingredients they prefer to eat. These are simple makeovers to 
do and the whole family can enjoy the process.</p>  This entry was posted in
