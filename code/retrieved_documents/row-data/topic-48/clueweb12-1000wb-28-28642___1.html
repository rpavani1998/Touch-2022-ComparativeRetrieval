<h1>Tip For Day Eight</h1> <br>

<p>Retrain You Taste Buds To Prefer Whole Wheat Bread (flickr photo)</p> 
<h1>If you love white breads and pastas, how will you ever get used to whole 
grains?</h1> 
<p>I decided to move my family away from whole grains a couple of years ago, 
and at first it wasn&rsquo;t easy.&nbsp; Now it&rsquo;s a choice. &nbsp;After 
reading&ldquo;The Culprit and the Cure&rdquo; I decided it was time to give 
this whole-grain &lsquo;fad&rsquo; a try.</p> 
<p>For the first few months I would go from eating whole grain pasta and brown 
rice back to the white.&nbsp; It seems I just still craved white rice and 
pasta.&nbsp; As time went by I found I was enjoying the whole grain foods 
better.&nbsp; They have more texture, don&rsquo;t get sticky in the pan, 
it&rsquo;s harder to overcook them and they have a nuttier flavor.</p> 
<p>At first I made some dishes with whole-grain, some with white, and some 
were 50/50.&nbsp; Now we&rsquo;ve gone completely to a whole grain diet (except 
when we go to a Mexican restaurant that still serves white tortillas).&nbsp; 
What can I say?&nbsp; No one is perfect.</p> 
<p>It is absolutely possible to re-train your taste buds so that you no longer 
crave the sticky white starchy pastas and breads.&nbsp; You can learn to prefer 
brown rice, whole-wheat spaghetti, and whole-wheat tortillas over white.</p> 
<p><strong>Why Bother? </strong></p> 
<p>You may be wondering, why bother?&nbsp; Remember that for grains to be made 
into fluffy products such as white rice, pasta or bread they have to go through 
aprocess that removes the bran and germ which depletes many of the nutrients 
and fiber. Though we&rsquo;ve become accustomed to the softer texture of 
processed grains, we have lost much of the nutritional value.</p> 
<p>Whole grains can help prevent chronic diseases that are now prevalent in 
our society such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease. Plus, the best thing 
about the unprocessed products is the extra fiber keeps us full longer.</p> 
<p>Try to stick to only whole grains for the Ten Day Challenge and see how you 
do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bet you will be like me and give the white stuff up for 
good.</p> Share <br>
