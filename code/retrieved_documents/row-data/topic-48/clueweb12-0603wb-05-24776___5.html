<p> <b>SICILY AND THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET:</b> </p>
<p>Sicilian food falls into the &quot;Mediterranean dietary group.&quot; The 
basic Sicilian diet is similar to the typical Mediterranean diet. In the Middle 
East, unlike Italy, pasta is not as common, so chick peas and other grains 
replace the pasta in their diet. However, the dietary principles are similar: 
it is a balance of simple and complex carbohydrates, proteins, and 
non-saturated (and some saturated) fats. There is a heavy reliance upon complex 
carbohydrates, vegetables and fruits, though it differs from the northern 
European diets. The extensive use of olive oil is common in both diets, and as 
a monounsaturated fat is healthier than saturated fats--studies claim it helps 
lower cholesterol levels.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Below is an example of how the Sicilian diet fits into the 
Mediterranean dietary group:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Fruits, vegetables, bread and other grains in high consumptions </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Vegetables and legumes; potatoes, peas and beans </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Nuts and seeds </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Olive oil-an important source of monounsaturated fat </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Dairy products </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Fish is consumed in high amounts</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Poultry is consumed in low amounts and little red meat is eaten </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Eggs zero to two times a week </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Wine consumed in moderate amounts </p></li> </ul> <br>

<p><b> Pasta</b> </p> 
<p>Americans' ideas of Italian food in the United States is not what Italians 
eat in Italy! (from a nutritional viewpoint).</p> 
<p>According to FAO, data for yearly food consumption is as follows: </p> 
<p>England: 91kg fruit 89kg of vegetables. USA: 113kg fruit 129kg Vegetable 
Italy: 140kg fruit 180kg of vegetables!</p> 
<p>You can see from the data that the English do not consume a large majority 
of fruits and vegetables, and cooking vegetables in the traditional 
&quot;English style&quot; results in even less nutrient consumption. The 
Italians consume large portions of fruits and vegetables, which is unlike the 
Italian-style cooking habits in the United States where the most 'popular' 
Italian food is pizza.&nbsp; Even a veggie topped pizza does not come close to 
satisfying recommended daily vegetable requirements.</p> 
<p>Americans often think of pizza, pasta with &quot;Alfredo&quot; sauce (which 
doesn't exist in Italy!), or plates smothered with cheese.&nbsp; In reality, 
only high-end Italian restaurants in the United States offer a good variety of 
vegetables more similar to that of an authentic Italian diet. Another Italian 
staple is to eat fruit at the end of every meal--something you don't find in 
just any Italian restaurant in the States!&nbsp; Salads and pre-prepared 
dressings are unknown creations to Italians and don't compare to the taste of 
fresh olive oil and a quality balsamic vinegar. Overall, Italian-American 
cooking lacks the essentials of a good, traditional Mediterranean diet.</p> 
<p><b> Mediterranean Diet </b></p> 
<p><b> Here is a Sicilian Mediterranean Diet example: </b></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>A brioche or croissant for breakfast OR 1 slice of bread, cookies, toast, 
or cereals for breakfast with honey or jams</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>A portion of fruit 2 times per day (as snacks) </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>A portion of vegetables 2 times per day </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>A portion of fish 3 times a week </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Not more than 2 eggs per week </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>No Fast food&nbsp; </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Eat legumes more than once a week </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Eat pasta or rice at least 5 times a week - only for lunch (not allowed for 
dinner)</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Use olive oil as dressing (to replace saturated fats like butter)</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Do not consume too much alcohol </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Eat less than 150g of meat two times in a week</p></li> </ul> 
<p><b>Doctor Inguanta</b> is my personal <b>Nutritionist</b>. She is Sicilian 
and she lives in Palermo (Sicily, Italy).&nbsp; Sicily is the heart of the 
Mediterranean Diet!!!!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Try eating pasta with a simple sauce with fresh tomatoes.</p> 
<p><b>Avoid &quot;Alfredo Sauce&quot;</b> (which is unknown in Italy) and 
cream and butter based sauces. In Italy, cream-based pasta has been out of 
style since the 1980s. Avoid those strange bread sticks that come with American 
Pizza - fresh bread is healthier.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>An Italian Breakfast </strong></p> 
<p>An Italian breakfast is frugal--it usually consists of yogurt or milk or 
coffee and milk with a Cornetto (or if you are eating it at home, cookies). 
While in the U.S., people are taught to eat a large, healthy, filling 
breakfast, many consider the Italian breakfast insufficient.</p> 
<p>While there is some truth to this, breakfast is important to give you 
energy for the day...we're no longer working the fields and instead find 
ourselves seated behind computers. The goal is to limit our calorie intake.</p> 
<p>A high fat breakfast is different than a high energy breakfast. Fat makes 
your body slow down, takes longer to digest, and fogs the mind. Grains give 
high energy without all the fat and mind fogging. If we take in more calories 
than are burned throughout the day, these calories or sugars transform 
themselves into fat.</p> 
<p>Cereals and toast with fruits are fine for breakfast, so the Italian 
breakfast is right on track.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Snack: </b> Having a snack in the middle of the morning is good.&nbsp; 
Usually an Italian snack is either a piece of fruit or a juice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Lunch:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of a Sicilian lunch is a one course 
meal like pasta or a panino and a salad or piece of fruit.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong> Afternoon snack:</strong> A yogurt or some fruit. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong> Dinner: </strong>Fish, meat or chicken dishes are usually eaten 
for dinner with a vegetable side dish.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fresh pizza is usually eaten only once a week (generally on Saturday night).
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong> Drinks: </strong>&nbsp;Natural mineral water or carbonated 
&quot;sparkling&quot; water are generally consumed by Italians anywhere from 1 
to 2 liters per day.&nbsp; No more than half a liter of wine a day (of course 
varies, but this in an average).&nbsp; Other drinks, like sodas, are consumed 
rarely compared to Americans.&nbsp; They are usually consumed on the weekends 
as companion to the weekly pizza.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The &quot;Slow Food&quot; movement, initiated to encourage the enjoyment, 
moderate consumption, and in effect counter fast food, began in Italy and 
Sicily.&nbsp; This Slow Foods movement has now spread globally and many 
chapters can be found in the United States as well.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Sicily, each province has it's own Slow Food Chapter that organizes 
events and public demonstrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mediterranean diets are characterized by olive oil, as the dominant fat 
source and a high to moderate consumption of fruit and vegetables, grains, fi
sh, and legumes, in combination with a little meat and wine with meals. The 
actual phrase &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; differs according to country, but 
is associated with good health and eating practices extending life expectancy. 
After studying countries of the Mediterranean diet, a decrease has been seen in 
coronary heart disease, cancer and other food-rel.</p> 
<p>The Mediterranean diet is low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated 
fatty acids, high in antioxidants (especially vitamin C and E), and high in 
fiber and folic acid. Several epidemiological studies have investigated these 
dietary components in various forms and further support the positive health 
effects of the Mediterranean diet. Intervention studies in East Finland and 
Southern Italy have convincingly shown that the coronary risk profile (lower 
LDL cholesterol and blood pressure levels) is improved by a Mediterranean diet.
</p> 
<p>Compared to the control diet with cardiac patients, the &quot;Mediterranean 
diet&quot; has proven to lower cardiac and all-causes mortality. In addition to 
lower disease risks and increased longevity, the Mediterranean way of eating is 
tasty, enjoyable, flavorful, and results in an overall sense of well being and 
satisfaction.</p>
