<p>Ok I&rsquo;ll admit it, many a time I have enjoyed a Mexican Pizza at Taco 
Bell for &ldquo;fourth meal&rdquo;. It was those outings that inspired this 
crunchy, cheesey Mexican pizza recipe. Seasoned ground beef and refried beans 
are layered between two crispy flour tortillas and topped with Mexican tomato 
sauce, 2 cheeses, diced tomatoes and green onions. The pizza is then placed 
under the broiler until the cheese melts.</p> 
<p><em>Makes: 4 pizzas</em></p> 
<p>You will need:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 pound ground beef (you may subsitute ground turkey if you like)</li> 
<li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li> 
<li>1/4 cup water</li> 
<li>1 (7 3/4) counce can Mexican style tomato sauce</li> 
<li>1 (14.5 ounce) can refried beans</li> 
<li>1/4 cup canola oil for frying</li> 
<li>8 small flour tortillas</li> 
<li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li> 
<li>1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese</li> 
<li>2 tomatoes, seeded, diced</li> 
<li>3 green onions, diced</li> </ul> 
<ol> 
<li>Preheat oven on broiler setting.</li> 
<li>In a skillet over medium heat, brown ground beef. Strain to remove any pan 
drippings. Return to pan and add taco seasoning and water. Reduce heat and 
simmer 10 minutes.</li> 
<li>Meanwhile, heat your refried beans until they are warmed through. Also, in 
a seperate pot heat your tomato sauce until it is warmed through.</li> 
<li>Heat oil over medium-high heat. Fry one tortilla at a time until all are 
golden brown. About 2 minutes per-side. (<em>Note: </em>I like to layer the 
finished tortillas between paper towels while I am frying the remaining 
tortillas)</li> 
<li>Once the meat is brown, the beans and tomato sauce are warmed and the 
tortillas are fried, you can start assembling your pizzas. Starting with one 
crispy tortilla, layer refried beans and seasoned ground beef, then place 
another crispy tortilla on top. Next, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the Mexican 
tomato sauce on top, spreading it around with the back of your spoon. Sprinkle 
with cheddar and jack cheeses, diced tomatoes and green onions. Repeat until 
you&rsquo;ve made four pizzas.Lay assembled pizzas on a cookie sheet, depending 
on the size of your cookie sheet you may need to do these in batches. Cook the 
pizzas under the broiler until the cheese melts, about 2 minutes.</li> </ol> 
<p>If you want to spice things up you can use jalapeno refried beans or maybe 
sprinkle some diced chiles on top. Enjoy!</p>  Like this recipe? Share with

<p>I made this and tried to bake the shell instead of frying. I need to 
perfect it. Other than that it was good.</p> &rdquo; <br>
