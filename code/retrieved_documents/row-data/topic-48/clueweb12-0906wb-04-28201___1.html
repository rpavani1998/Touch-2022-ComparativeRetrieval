To opt-out of having your information shared with third parties please write to 
us.</p>

 We 
collect and combine personally identifiable information (&quot;PII&quot;) and 
non-personally identifiable information (&quot;Non-PII&quot;) through various 
sources, including those discussed below. For your reference, PII is data 
collected with an intention to specifically identify, contact or locate a 
person, including but not limited to name, address, telephone number, or e-mail 
address. Conversely, Non-PII is data that is not used to specifically identify, 
contact or locate an individual, including but not limited to zip code, gender, 
age, or IP address.</p>

technology pass information to us so that we may serve advertisements to you. 
The information passed may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, 
e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, and 
gender.</p>

not limited to your IP address, e-mail address, first name, last name, mailing 
address, and telephone number, from third party marketing partners that provide 
us with consumer data to manage on their behalf.</p> 
<p>Automatic Information/Digital Identifiers<br>
 We may automatically receive 
and store certain types of information about you through the data sources 
listed above.</p> 
<p>You may be familiar with the term &quot;cookies,&quot; which are unique 
alphanumeric identifiers that store information on your computer. A cookie is 
placed on your computer when your web browser accesses our website. We use 
cookies for tracking transactions and the user characteristics explained in 
detail throughout this Privacy Policy. If you choose, there are utilities 
available for purchase from independent software providers to install on your 
computer as well as tools/preferences you can choose through most web browsers 
to make website visits anonymous. Of course, cookies let you have a more 
satisfying website experience, so we recommend that you leave them turned on.
</p> 
<p>We also collect information through our web server applications. This 
information includes your Internet Protocol or &quot;IP&quot; address, 
date/time stamp, browser type, and referring URL.</p> 
<p>Additionally, we may use pixel tracking technology to track the completion 
of transactions with us or our advertisers, the source information for those 
transactions, and your IP address, date/time stamp, browser type, and referring 
URL.</p> 
<p>Government Forms<br>
 The Company may be required to create, collect, 
maintain, and submit certain information required by the government, such as 
IRS Forms W-9 and 1099. This information, which may include your taxpayer 
identification number, will not be used, shared, transferred, or sold for 
marketing purposes.</p> 
<p>HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?<br>
 We may use the collected PII and 
Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including 
but not limited to those explained below.</p> 
<p>Ad Serving<br>
 We may serve advertisements to you based, in part, on your 
IP address, the demographic and geographic information you submitted to the 
Company during the website registration process, and other socio-economic 
information, psychographic information, Internet behavior (i.e., browsing, 
search, shopping, purchase, and ad response behavior), and lifestyle 
information about you that we obtain from affiliated entities and from third 
parties.</p> 
<p>We also use third party advertising companies, such as Advertising.com, to 
serve advertisements when you visit our websites. These companies may use and 
optimize information (not including your name, mailing address, e-mail address, 
or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to 
provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 
If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices 
about not having this information used by Advertising.com please visit 
http://www.advertising.com/privacy_policy_details.php.</p> 
<p>Pre-select/Pre-fill Offers<br>
 Our website technology may pre-select 
certain offers for you to view based on the demographic and geographic 
information you submitted to the Company during the website registration 
process. Additionally, this technology may pre-fill some or all of the offers' 
data fields with the information you submitted during the website registration 
process in order to prevent you from having to re-enter this information. We 
may not show all of the pre-filled data fields to you.</p> 
<p>Upsell <br>
 We utilize customized post transactional or &quot;upsell&quot; 
technology to help advertisers generate sales, while providing you with a 
series of great offers we think may be of interest to you. The way it works is 
simple: once you purchase a product or service from one of our reward 
advertisers, you will be offered additional products or services that we think 
may be of interest to you. If you elect to purchase products or services from 
an advertiser in the post transactional channel, we will pass the information 
that you provided during the initial transaction to the subsequent advertiser, 
including but not limited to your credit card information. This information 
pass is done to enhance and simplify your purchasing experience. Your 
information will only be passed to an advertiser in the post transactional 
channel after you have elected to purchase their product or service. By 
electing to purchase their product or service you consent to the passing of 
your data to the third party advertiser in question.<br>
<br>
 Customer Service 
and Fulfillment<br>
 We may use your information to operate the website 
promotion, service your account and to fulfill rewards earned through Company 
websites. We may also use your information to verify your identity or claimed 
account status and, where we consider appropriate, investigate your compliance 
with the terms and conditions of the website promotion or any advertiser offer. 
We do retain customer service correspondence.</p> 
<p>Credit Card Preauthorization<br>
 By submitting your credit card 
information to us or to one of our advertisers, you are authorizing the Company 
or its agent to periodically verify that your credit card account is valid and 
has credit available by charging, and thereafter crediting, a small sum to the 
card.</p> 
<p>Marketing<br>
 We may use your information in our online (e.g., e-mail 
marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, skip 
tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs. If you would like to be removed 
from these programs please write to us.</p> 
<p>HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?<br>
 We may share the collected PII and 
Non-PII for any legally permissible purpose in our sole discretion, including 
but not limited to those explained below.</p> 
<p>Within the Company <br>
 We may share information we collect with 
affiliated companies, including our parent company and other subsidiaries of 
our parent company, for use in their ad serving and marketing programs. This 
Privacy Policy does not apply to affiliated companies and their collection, use

<p>Vendors<br>
 We may share your information with various third party vendors 
that are not part of the Company, including but not limited to vendors that

advertiser.</p> 
<p>When you answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to a marketing or survey 
question, some or all of the information that you submitted during the website 
registration process will be transferred to advertisers that we believe may be 
of interest to you without providing you with another opportunity to review the 
information.</p> 
<p>When you select &quot;yes&quot; next to an offer, we will transfer some or 
all of the information that you submitted during the website registration 
process to the applicable advertiser without providing you with another 
opportunity to review the information.</p> 
<p>Ad Serving Companies <br>
 We may use third party ad networks or ad serving 
companies to serve advertisements on our websites. We pass information about 
you to these companies so that they can deliver targeted advertisements that 
they believe will be of interest to you. The information passed to these 
companies may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, e-mail address, 
name, mailing address, telephone number, date of birth, gender, and any other 
information you provide to us. Web pages that are served by these companies 
will state that they are &quot;powered by&quot; or &quot;ads by&quot; the 
applicable company and will contain a link to that company's privacy policy.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.
</li> 
<li>Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based

third parties for various marketing purposes, including their online (e.g., 
e-mail marketing) and offline (e.g., telemarketing, cell phone text messaging, 
skip tracing, and direct mail) marketing programs. If you would like to be 
removed from these programs write to us.</p> 
<p>Data Enhancement/Appending/Validation<br>
 We may use third party service 
providers to enhance our database with additional elements, including but not 
limited to age ranges present in your household, whether you own or rent a 
home, the length of time you have lived at your residence, whether you are a 
mail order buyer or responder, household income, and gender. Further, we may 
use third party service providers to append telephone numbers to other data 
points we have in our database. We also may use third party service providers 
to validate the data we have in our database.</p> 
<p>Additionally, we may share, license or sell your information to third 
parties for use in their data validation, enhancement, information verification 
services, and, to the extent permitted by law, individual reference or look-up 
services.</p> 
<p>Governmental Agencies or Other Companies<br>
 We may share your information 
with law enforcement officials or governmental agencies: (1) in response to 
their request; (2) when permitted or required by law; or (3) to establish our 
compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or guidelines.</p> 
<p>We may store and share your information with third parties for suppression 
or opt-out purposes.</p> 
<p>We also may share your information with third parties when: (1) trying to 
protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized 
transactions; (2) investigating fraud that has already taken place; (3) 
enforcing or applying existing terms and conditions and/or other agreements;

for marketing purposes.</p>

business assets, it is possible that the information we possess may be
