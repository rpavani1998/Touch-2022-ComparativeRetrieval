<h2>Restaurant Review: Il Canale in&nbsp;Georgetown</h2> 12 Feb 
<p>The calimari was way better than this terrible picture</p> 
<p>As soon as I read a review of Il Canale on Serious Eats, I knew I had to 
go. It was proclaimed Georgetown&rsquo;s first &ldquo;Truly Neapolitan 
Pizza,&rdquo; and though I know New York is home to lots of great Neapolitan 
places, this one is practically on my doorstep. So best for the area is good 
enough for me.<br>
 So Roxie, my friend Lily, and I met up for dinner here last 
Tuesday. As expected on a Tuesday, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly packed, but I 
imagine it gets busier on weekends and I would probably make a reservation. 
Looking around, the pizzas looked just slightly bigger than personal 
size&ndash; I could probably have finished a whole one with no appetizer, but I 
didn&rsquo;t need one to myself. So we decided to share an order of calimari 
and fried zucchini to start, and then went for a Margherita pizza and the 
Italia.<br>
 We were a little worried at first that because 
&ldquo;foccacia&rdquo; was listed on the menu, we wouldn&rsquo;t get free 
bread. Thankfully, we were soon proven wrong, and though the bread itself was 
pretty standard, the roasted garlic in the olive oil that came with it was 
awesome. (Potatoes, bread, pasta&hellip; yes, the Spices love their carbs.)</p>

<p>The calimari came next, and totally blew me away. I&rsquo;m not always a 
huge fan of calimari, because I often find it too chewy. This wasn&rsquo;t 
chewy at all, however, and the batter was perfectly light and salty. The 
zucchini thrown in to the didn&rsquo;t add a whole lot, but made me feel a tiny 
bit healthier.<br>
 Next up were the pizzas. The Margherita was your classic, 
marinara sauce, mozzarella and basil. I could have done with a little more 
basil, but I though the sauce was incredible&hellip; really bright tomato 
flavors. The Italia was off the white side of the menu, meaning it had no 
sauce. It was a good prosciutto-parmesan-arugula pizza, though the toppings 
didn&rsquo;t blow me away. The stand out on both pizzas, to me, was the crust. 
Super chewy and really well flavored, it made me understand the cult of the 
Neapolitan pizza.<br>
 Best of all was the bill we got at the end! $15 each for 
a filling meal&hellip; granted we didn&rsquo;t get drinks or dessert, but it is 
undoubtedly very well priced (and certainly rivals the other Italian eateries 
in Georgetown in this respect).<br>
 I would highly recommend Il Canale for a 
nice meal out with your friends&hellip; it is budget-friendly, good for 
sharing, and has excellent food.</p>
