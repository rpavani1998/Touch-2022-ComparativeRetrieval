<h1>Pasta Salad with Chicken and Roasted Vegetables</h1></b> <br>

<p> </p> <br>
Recipe By: Sara <br>
<br>
<b>About this Recipe:</b><br>
<br>
Sara
: Pasta salads are great as a side dish or even entire meal. You can be as 
imaginative as you want, as healthy or as naughty depending on your mode! They 
are also easy to transport which makes them ideal as picnic, potluck or office 
lunch options. This recipe is as tasty as it is easy, enjoy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <b>Main Ingredients:</b><br>
<br>
 Chicken Breast: 2 Cooked and diced <br>

Pasta: 250 g (You can use any type of small or medium sized pasta like penne or 
shell. Whole wheat and flavoured pastas work well too.<br>
Yam: 1 Medium <br>

Red Onion: 1 Medium<br>
Bell Pepper: 3 Small bell peppers (Green, Red and 
Orange)<br>
Olive oil: 2 Tbsp <br>
Feta: 1/2 cup crumbled <br>
Parsley <br>

Salt and Pepper<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Salad Dressing</b>: <br>
<br>
Light 
Mayonnaise*: 1 cup<br>
Garlic: 1 Clove, minced <br>
Lemon: 1 freshly squeezed 
<br>Parsley: 2 Tbsp finely chopped <br>
Salt and Pepper <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>
Directions:</b><br>
<br>
 1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F . Line a cookie 
sheet with foil.<br>
<br>
2. Cut the bell peppers, yam and the onion into 1/2 
inch pieces.<br>
<br>
3. In a medium bowl toss the vegetables with 2 the olive 
oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange on the prepared cookie sheet.<br>
<br>
4. Roast 
vegetables 20 minutes in the preheated oven, tossing occasionally, until 
roasted**.<br>
<br>
5. While vegetables are roasting, in a large pot of salted 
boiling water, cook pasta 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.<br>
<br>

6. Make the salad dressing by mixing all the dressing ingredients.<br>
<br>
7. 
In a large bowl, toss together cooked pasta, chicken, vegetables and the salad 
dressing***.<br>
<br>
8. Pour in the desired dish, sprinkle with feta and 
decorate with parsley leaves. Serve immediately.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* You can 
use olive oil instead of light mayonnaise for a healthier option.<br>
<br>
** 
It is a good idea to use a separate cookie sheet for yams as it might take them 
longer to roast than other vegetables.<br>
<br>
*** Pasta absorbs the salad 
dressing so if you are making this dish ahead, use only half of the dressing 
and add the remaining half just before serving. <br>

 I had the opportunity to taste the real thing that Sara 
herself had cooked in a party. It was so good and delicious. I specially 
enjoyed the sweet taste of roasted yam which was a nice complement to the pasta 
salad. Thanks Sara for sharing the recipe. <br>

Self rising flour is basically all purpose flour plus baking 
powder. Sometimes it also contains a bit salt. <br>

I had a question. once a time I bought a book 
on making cakes in English. In its instructions in the ingredients there is 
self-raising flour. But I do not know what it means &amp; how I can prepare it. 
Can you help me Navid? Thanks <br>
