<p>Business travelers eat all of their meals in restaurants. But large meals 
and fatty foods don't have to spell nutritional disaster. Here are some tips to 
eat healthy in restaurants:</p> 
<p><b>1. Get it <i>your </i>way.</b> Not only are you paying for the meal, you 
have to wear the excess calories. So ask for it your way:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p> Order grilled chicken instead of fried on the salad; bean soup rather than 
refried beans.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p> Ask the kitchen not to brush your fajitas, steak, chicken or fish with 
butter.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Ask for your pizza to be prepared &quot;light&quot; on the cheese.</p> </li>
<li> 
<p>Since every tablespoon of mayonnaise, dressing, butter, and oil contains 
100 calories, ask for them &quot;on the side&quot; so you can &quot;dip and 
stab&quot;.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Do your heart and belly a favor by asking for half the meat and double the 
vegetables &#151; even in your stir-fry.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Special order a healthier (low fat/calorie, vegetarian or fruit plate) 
airline meal and give more than 24-hour notice.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Ask for a luncheon or appetizer portion. Many restaurants can accommodate 
&#151; even if it's not on the menu. Want eggplant parmigiana? Get the 
appetizer portion.</p> </li> </ul> 
<p><b>2. Make Miss Manners mad.</b> Perhaps &quot;Miss Manners&quot; would 
object, but she doesn't have to fit into your jeans, so:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Trim off the visible fat on the meat </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Pull off the chicken skin. </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Scrape off the breading or excess sauce and drain off the excess butter or 
oil.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Pat the pizza with a paper napkin to remove some of the grease. </p> </li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>3. Control your portions. </b>Since it's hard not to eat everything 
that's served, try these ideas:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Order a la carte or just tell them what you want (i.e. two enchiladas 
instead of three).</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Take a slice of bread and then give the basket back to the server. </p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p>Get the doggie bag with dinner and immediately put away half your meal. 
Then leave the box behind.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Use chopsticks. They make you eat slower, so you eat less. </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>To eliminate the temptation to keep nibbling when you've had enough, salt 
the rest of your dinner heavily or pour on the hot sauce.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p><b>4. Check the &quot;price&quot; tag.</b> Think of calories as the 
&quot;price&quot; you'll have to pay (on your waist). Did you know that:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>A large cinnamon roll has over 800 calories and more than a half a stick of 
butter?</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>One &quot;loaded&quot; nacho has more than 100 calories? </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Your morning mocha coffee contains more than 300 calories? </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>A large fountain drink has 300 calories? </p> </li> </ul> 
<p><b>5. Make leaner substitutions. </b></p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Since juice has the same number of calories as soda, order fresh fruit 
instead.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Ask for egg substitutes; they're just one-third the calories of eggs. </p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p>Order Canadian bacon or ham instead of bacon or sausage. </p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>In addition to skinless chicken and fish, choose from leaner cuts of beef 
(sirloin, filet, London broil, New York) or pork tenderloin.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Request pasta with tomato sauce instead of cream. If you really want cream 
sauce, ask them to use half the usual amount for a lighter, still flavorful 
pasta.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Instead of a full meal, order salad and a healthy appetizer such as: shrimp 
cocktail; Thai summer rolls; chicken satays; sushi; steamed vegetable 
dumplings; and pizza (&quot;light on the cheese&quot;).</p> </li> </ul> 
<p><b>6. Beware of the Extras.</b> Many meals can be made healthier just by 
cutting out some of the &quot;extras&quot;. For example:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>For an extra 100 calories, choose from: 1 tablespoon mayonnaise or salad 
dressing, 1 cheese slice; 2 strips bacon; saut&eacute;ed mushrooms; sliced 
avocado, 1 large onion ring; 7 potato puffs; 10 regular fries or 20 skinny 
French fries. Take your pick!</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>While the calories in sugar and cream aren't much per teaspoon, it all adds 
up! If you eat just 10 calories more than your body needs, you'll put on a 
pound of fat each year.<br>
</p> </li> </ul>
