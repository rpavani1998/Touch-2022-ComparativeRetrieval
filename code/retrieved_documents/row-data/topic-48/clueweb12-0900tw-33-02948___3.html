<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Takeaways&nbsp;are often&nbsp;cheap, convenient and satisfying but, 
unfortunately,&nbsp;they're not always very healthy.</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some takeaway meals&nbsp;can push you over your recommended daily maximum 
amount ofsalt and fat, which can lead to a variety of health problems, such as 
heart disease and diabetes.</p> 
<p>Some takeaways and restaurants now list&nbsp;calories on their menus, 
which&nbsp;lets you opt for something with fewer calories.</p> 
<p>Below are some tips on foods to avoid and healthier options when ordering 
your favourite takeaway.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2> Fish and chips </h2> <br>

<p>There are lots of ways of making your trip to the chippy a healthier one. 
Have a portion of baked beans or mushy peas and bread with your fish and chips. 
Watch out for other foods that are high in fat, such as pies and sausages.</p> 
<p>The thicker the chips the better because they absorb less fat. Try to have 
a smaller portion or share your chips. Ask for your fish and chips without salt 
&ndash; if you want some salt then add a small amount yourself.</p> 
<p>Don't eat all the batter around your fish because it soaks up a lot of fat. 
If available, have fish coated in breadcrumbs as it soaks up less fat.</p> 
<p>Fish and chips that are cooked in oil at the right temperature taste better 
and&nbsp;absorb less fat. So watch out for soggy batter and chips because this 
is often a sign that the oil wasn't hot enough.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Try to avoid</strong>: thin-cut chips, pies such as cheese and 
onion pie or steak and kidney pie, jumbo sausage.</li> 
<li><strong>Healthier options</strong>: fish coated in breadcrumbs, mushy 
peas, thicker-cut chips without salt.</li> </ul> 
<h2> Italian </h2> <br>

<p>If you're having pizza, choose lower-fat toppings, such as vegetables, ham, 
fish and prawns. You could ask for some extra veg on your pizza to bump up your 
daily fruit and veg portions. But if you don't want to increase the saturated 
fat content and number of calories in your meal, don't ask for extra cheese.</p>
<p>With pasta dishes, if you want a lower-fat option then go for a sauce 
that's based on tomatoes or vegetables rather than cream.</p> 
<p>If you're having a starter or a dessert then you could go for a smaller 
main meal such as a starter-size pasta with a side salad &ndash; Italian 
restaurants often serve two sizes of pasta dishes.</p> 
<p>Rather than garlic bread, which often contains a lot of butter (and is 
therefore&nbsp;high in fat), you could try bruschetta, which is a tasty 
ciabatta bread toasted and topped with fresh tomatoes and herbs.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Try to avoid</strong>: large deep-pan pizzas, pizzas with the 
crust stuffed with cheese, triple cheese with pepperoni pizzas, creamy pasta 
sauces, garlic bread.</li> 
<li><strong>Healthier options</strong>: small or medium pizza with a thin base 
and vegetable or lean meat topping, tomato-based pasta sauces, bruschetta.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2> Chinese </h2> 
<p>Anything that&rsquo;s battered or marked as &lsquo;crispy&rsquo; on the 
menu means it&rsquo;s deep fried. Watch out for starters such as prawn crackers 
and spring rolls because these are generally deep fried. Anything in batter 
will be high in fat. Sweet and sour pork is usually battered.</p> 
<p>Steamed dishes are the best option, but stir-fries are fine because they're 
usually lower in fat and include vegetables.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Try to avoid</strong>: sweet and sour battered pork balls with 
special or egg fried rice, prawn toast, spring rolls.</li> 
<li><strong>Healthier options</strong>: crab and corn soup, steamed dumplings, 
steamed vegetables and plain boiled rice, steamed fish, chicken chop suey, 
Szechuan prawns.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Thai </h2> 
<p>Try to stick to stir-fried dishes or steamed dishes containing chicken, 
fish or vegetables instead of curries.</p> 
<p>Thai curries, such as the popular green and red curries, contain coconut 
milk, which is high in saturated fat. If you choose a curry, try not to eat all 
the sauce. Have some steamed rice with your meal instead of egg fried rice.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Try to avoid</strong>: fried rice, fish cakes, spring rolls, prawn 
crackers, satay skewers with peanut sauce and sweet and sour dishes.</li> 
<li><strong>Healthier options</strong>: clear soups such as tom yum, salads, 
stir-fried meat, fish or vegetable dishes, steamed seafood dishes, such as fish 
or mussels.</li> </ul> 
<h2> Indian </h2> 
<p>Try to avoid anything that&rsquo;s creamy or deep fried. To reduce the 
amount of fat in your meal, choose dishes with tomato-based sauces, such as 
tandoori and madras, plain rice or chapatti. Also choose plenty of vegetables, 
including lentil side dishes (known as dhal).</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Try to avoid</strong>: any creamy curries such as korma, passanda 
or masala with pilau rice, naan, bhajis, pakoras and poppadoms.</li> 
<li><strong>Healthier options</strong>: tandoori or madras with chicken, 
prawns or vegetables, plain rice and chapatti.</li> </ul> 
<h2> Kebab and burgers </h2> 
<p>Donor kebabs can be high in fat. For a healthier option, go for a shish 
kebab, which is a skewer with whole cuts of meat or fish and usually grilled.
</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re having a&nbsp;burger, avoid breaded or battered chicken or 
fish patties,&nbsp;extra cheese, bacon strips and&nbsp;high-fat sauces such as 
mayonnaise. Instead,&nbsp;go for a regular, single-patty hamburger without mayo 
or cheese and have with extra salad.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Try to avoid</strong>: large doner kebab with mayonnaise and no 
salad, burgers with cheese and mayonnaise, thin-cut chips, chicken&nbsp;or fish 
patties&nbsp;deep fried in batter.</li> 
<li><strong><strong>Healthier</strong>&nbsp;options</strong>: shish kebab with 
pitta bread and salad, grilled burgers made from lean fish or meat (beef or 
whole chicken breast) and without cheese and mayonnaise.</li> </ul>

<p>So, all the studies that indicate that it is high glycaemic foods that 
contribute to obesity should be ignored, because the food industry keeps 
lobbying authorities to maintain the status quo with regard to healthy eating 
guidelines?<br>
<br>
Or you could try it for yourself; less bread, less batter 
(flour), less potato-see what happens...</p>

<h4>Artmike said on 05 December 2011</h4> 
<p>It is a bit disappointing that the advice is so broad it doesn't help you 
to really understand the evidence behind it and what is best for you in the 
context of what is a good diet for you or the impact you have on the 
environment. Equally anyone who has eaten real Asian food will know what gets 
served in UK often is a poor unhealthy second to the wide range of food, much 
very healthy, in home cooking. If only we could get that in take aways.<br>
<br>
Too much of any fat will be high in calories but coconut milk isn't the usual 
meat based saturated fat, it has a different saturated fat structure and has 
lots of health benefits. What should I choose a jumbo sausage or a Thai curry 
for overall health? Would be good to know.<br>
<br>
It is interesting that 
although cheese is targeted in this advice, the extent to which cream is added 
to so many supermarket takeaways isn't. Many people also have intolerance to 
milk, fortunately coconut cream is a much better alternative for many of us. It 
is also much more environmentally friendly than the cruel intensive milk 
farming that has a high carbon footprint. Need to consider the terrible impact 
of over fishing too.<br>
<br>
By the way presumably we shouldn't eat the batter 
round fish either, can't be better for you than anything else deep fried 
surely. However, when did you last see breaded fish in a chippy - I never have.
<br><br>
Please let us know where your research evidence comes from and who 
funds it so we can use your advice more appropriately otherwise keep up the 
good work</p>

<h4>katdes said on 05 August 2011</h4> 
<p>To those who think 'Indians' (a vague European term to describe 20% of the 
worlds population) eat those sort of takeaways every day really don&rsquo;t 
understand that most Indians eat lentils, rice, vegetables as their staple diet.
<br>The term curry implies Indians eat curries every day but in reality curries 
are highly varied, in the major with no meat whatsoever.<br>
<br>
These 
takeaways are more alien to Indians than to the British! Takeaways are a 
western marketing gimmick- don&rsquo;t get me wrong i like them too but they 
are not Indian food as i know it.</p>

<h4>blue_flower said on 27 June 2011</h4> 
<p>Not sure what exactly Cushing0 meant when they said people live on that 
type of food...but its perfectly possible to eat Indian food that is healthy. 
(or chinese or any other food for that matter)<br>
<br>
Most Indian's eat rice 
and curry and everyday, but because its made at home only a little oil is added 
and the flavour is brought out by the spices. Its possible to make curries 
without oil too.<br>
<br>
Restaurants and take-aways should be for special 
occasions/treats only as these curries are loaded with so much oil, that 
sometimes looking at it puts you off.<br>
<br>
It's not difficult to make a 
curry at home, just google the recipes. If the recipe calls for a lot of oil or 
ghee/butter only use a little olive or rapeseed oil. If it calls for coconut 
milk, just use normal milk. Try to replace cream with milk and perhaps add a 
little cornflour/tomato puree/potato or mashed potato if you need to thicken 
the curry.<br>
<br>
Avoid deep-fried foods like samosas. Even some types of 
poppadoms can be made by putting them in the microwave for 10 seconds without 
any oil!</p>
