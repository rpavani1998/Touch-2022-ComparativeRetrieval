<h4>Healthy Favorite Foods</h4> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.&quot; This adage may be the best way 
to help improve your children's nutritional intake. If you simply can't get 
your children to eat anything other than their favorite foods, like boxed 
macaroni and cheese, french fries, pizza, and cereal, don't fight it. Instead, 
try and improve the nutritional value of those foods and partner them with some 
other less favorite food disguised as 'kid friendly'.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Macaroni and Cheese</b> 
<p>To make this favorite food healthier, substitute skim milk for whole milk 
and use trans-fat-free margarine for the butter. Serve fruit on the side. Try
Earth's Best Sesame Street Elmo Mac 'n Cheese with Carrots and Broccoli. Or 
introduce your child toEarth's Best Sesame Street Frozen Cheese Ravioli. It has 
a great cheese and pasta flavor, but is enriched with important vitamins and 
minerals and is made from organic ingredients.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Pizza</b> 
<p>Earth's Best Sesame Street Frozen Whole Grain Cheese Pizza is the easiest 
way to make this choice the healthy way to go. It's made from whole grains and 
organic ingredients. Other ways to improve on a white bread crust, high fat 
cheese topping pizza is to order your pizza-to-go with extra sauce and light on 
the cheese. Kids will most likely not notice the reduced amount of cheese. 
Forget the high-fat meat toppings like pepperoni or sausage. If you're really 
daring, suggest adding green peppers on the top. (Green peppers are tops on the 
list of kid's favorite vegetables). While you're waiting for the pizza to be 
delivered, cut up some carrot sticks and serve with fat free ranch dressing. 
They may fill up on enough of these to reduce their pizza intake by a slice or 
two.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Cereal</b> 
<p>Luckily, cereal manufacturers are responding to parent demands for lower 
sugar versions of popular kid's cereals. Look for cereals made with whole 
grains that have fiber and only a little sugar (ideally less than 6 grams per 
serving). Fortified cereals help to ensure that your child is getting some of 
the more important nutrients frequently missing in a child's diet. Earth's Best 
offers organic, healthy versions of some kids favorites, includingSesame Street 
Organic Honey Nut On-the-Go O's and Cinnamon Apple Organic On-the-go O's Cereal.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Peanut Butter and Jelly</b> 
<p>Use whole wheat bread, all natural peanut butter without added sugars or 
emulsifiers and low-sugar jelly. Serve with fruit kabobs and veggies with 
low-fat dip instead of chips and pickles (which are high in fat and salt).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Chicken Nuggets</b> 
<p>Make your own nuggets using organic white meat chicken breast, dipped in a 
mixture of egg and milk and then coated with whole grain breadcrumbs, a little 
salt/seasonings and bake in a 400-degree oven for 15 minutes. Serve with 
barbeque or honey dip.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>French Fries</b> 
<p>Make sweet potato fries as an alternative to the nutrient-void deep-fried 
traditional French fry. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Wash and prepare 2 
sweet potatoes and cut into wedges. Throw into a large bowl and mix with 1 
Tablespoon olive oil and a &not;&Omega; tsp. salt. Place onto pan and bake for 
30 minutes, or until crispy on the outside. These are also yummy seasoned with 
cinnamon or Italian seasoning. Kids will love to dip sweet potato fries into 
applesauce or plain yogurt mixed with maple syrup.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Finger Food</b> 
<p>Make any food a finger food. Want your toddler to eat beans? Cook them 
crisp tender, keep them finger friendly (i.e. pieces easy to pick up) and allow 
them to be dipped into something yummy if necessary, such as a low fat cheese 
sauce or ranch dip. Go easy on the table manners for a while. There's plenty of 
time to get elbows off the table and napkins in the lap.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Don't Use Force&nbsp;</b> 
<p>Power struggles with food can interfere with acceptance. Allow a child to 
come to enjoy a food on his or her own terms. Healthy foods presented in a kid 
friendly way (e.g. small bite size, easy to chew texture, fun color) in a 
non-pressured setting, over and over again will often result in eventual 
acceptance, even preference.</p>
