recipe,Garlic Bread), Made Pizzas n Pasta with Shrimps, Tossed the boiled 
potato in yogurt, mayo, salt, pepper &amp; sugar for a yummy creamy potato 
salad&hellip;. And for pasta salad, just mixed the boiled&nbsp; pasta with some 
herbs, mayo, capsicum, salt n pepper&hellip;. And&hellip;Cut some raw Capsicum 
n Cucumbers for those who preferred raw salad.. Actually i wanted to make all 
the salad which is normally kept in the salad bar but then i became lazy n 
restricted to only 4. That&rsquo;s it&hellip;A complete luscious meal was ready 
and finally added a compliment of chilled Pepsi to it:-)</p>
