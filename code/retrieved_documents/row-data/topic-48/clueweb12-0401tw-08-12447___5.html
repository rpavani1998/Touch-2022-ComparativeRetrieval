<h2>Red Light, Green Light: The Healthiest and Unhealthiest Picks for Dining 
Out, USC&nbsp;Edition</h2> Posted on February 29, 2012 | Leave a comment <br>
 
USC, my alma mater, is located just south of downtown Los Angeles. Bordered by 
the 110 and the 10 freeways and neighboring the northern edge of South Central 
L.A., it&rsquo;s certainly not among LA&rsquo;s best &ndash; or healthiest 
&ndash; culinary establishments Figueroa is dotted with fast food joints like 
Panda Express, Fatburger, and McDonald&rsquo;s, and the nearby University 
Village has a love-it-or-hate-it food court serving up ethnic cuisines. 
Luckily, there are several local restaurants lovingly cherished by USC students 
(a 2 AM Chano&rsquo;s run is practically required before graduation) &ndash; 
and each of their menus has at least a couple healthy choices. Read on to find 
your best- and worst &ndash; bets at each of USC&rsquo;s late-night or Leavey 
marathon standbys.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>Chanos</strong></em> 
<p></p> <em><strong></strong></em> <strong>Red Light: Chano&rsquo;s Fries
</strong> <br>
 Instead of piling heaps of ground beef, refried beans, pico de 
gallo, guacamole, cheese, and sour cream on a bed of chips, Chano&rsquo;s 
serves their nachos dishes on a huge, greasy mound of French fries. With five 
forms of fat &ndash; including lard-soaked beans and fat-packed ground beef 
&ndash; this dish can easily pack in more than 1500 calories.<br>
<strong>
Yellow Light: Soft Tostada</strong> <br>
 Unlike most tostadas, Chano&rsquo;s 
Soft Tostada isn&rsquo;t fried &ndash; cutting down on a bulk of the unhealthy 
calories. And unlike a stuffed burrito, a tostada can only hold so many 
toppings &ndash; so its damage is generally limited to under 500 calories. Ask 
for extra lettuce and tomatoes to pump up your daily vegetable intake.<br>

<strong>Green Light: Chicken Taco</strong> <br>
 Instead of refined flour 
tortillas, Chano&rsquo;s these tacos are built on two corn tortillas, which 
have half the fat and calories and one fourth of the sodium. Stuffed with 
chicken, fresh salsa, and guacamole, there&rsquo;s little room to go wrong here 
&ndash; and the healthy fats in avocados aid in the absorption of lycopene from 
the tomatoes.<br>
<br>
<em><strong>Manas Indian Cuisine</strong></em> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Red Light: Lamb Korma</strong><br>
 Most lamb cuts used in Indian 
cooking come from the leg or shoulder &ndash; two of the fattiest parts. And 
Manas&rsquo; Korma is a creamy onion sauce mixed with cashews and almonds 
&ndash; making this dish heavy in the fat department. Even worse, there 
isn&rsquo;t a single vegetable to add some redeeming fiber to this dish.<br>

<strong>Yellow Light: Manas Special Curry</strong><br>
 A mix of vegetables, 
lemongrass, and spices in a coconut-based curry, this pick has some virtues and 
some evils. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s low in protein, and its heavy use of 
coconut makes it relatively high in calories and saturated fat. On the other 
hand, studies show that the saturated fats in coconut are actually healthy 
&nbsp;- boosting energy and metabolism. Additionally, the vegetables give it a 
huge fiber boost, promoting satiety.</p> <br>
<strong>Green Light: Tandoori 
Chicken</strong> <br>
 Tandoori chicken, marinated in protein-packed yogurt and 
antioxidant-spiked spices like turmeric, is a great choice on any menu. Low in 
fat &ndash; most of it drips off in the oven &ndash; tandoori dishes get their 
deep, smokey flavor from quickly roasting in a high temperature clay oven.<br>

<br> <em><strong>Pasta Roma</strong></em> 
<p></p> <strong></strong> <strong></strong> <strong>Red Light: Calzone All Meat
</strong> <br>
 Pasta Roma&rsquo;s Calzone All Meat, with mozzarella, ricotta, 
sausage, pepperoni, and meatballs, is like eating an entire pizza yourself 
&ndash; but worse. Because the calzone isn&rsquo;t limited to a delicate 
balance of toppings like a pizza is, Pasta Roma can stuff in a ridiculous 
amount of toppings. And they&rsquo;re not even healthy toppings &ndash; 
they&rsquo;re packed with sodium and saturated fat.<br>
<strong>Yellow Light: 
Ravioli (Beef, Chicken, or Cheese with Tomato, Cream, or Pink Sauce)</strong> 
<br> Depending on how your order your ravioli, this could be a hit or miss. An 
Alfredo sauce can pack more than five times the calories and four times the 
saturated fat as a tomato-based sauce. And ravioli stuffed with cheese only 
adds more saturated fat; pick beef &ndash; or even better, chicken &ndash; to 
add leaner protein. <br>
<strong>Green Light: Linguine with Mixed Seafood
</strong> <br>
 The seafood in pasta dishes is often steamed, relieving your 
dish of unwanted oil and butter. Shellfish, including mussels, clams, shrimp, 
and scallops, are high in omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and iron, and add low-fat 
protein to an otherwise carb-heavy dish. Just skip out on the extra garlic 
knots that Pasta Roma doles out: they could add more than 400 calories of 
quick-burning, insulin-spiking carbs. 
<p></p> <strong><em>Jacks N Joe</em></strong> <strong></strong> 
<p></p> <strong>Red Light: WTF?! Pancakes</strong> <br>
 You&rsquo;d probably 
be better off ordering dessert. This dish takes six large pancakes &ndash; made 
with refined flour, whole milk, and sugar &ndash; and tops them with sweetened 
cream cheese, berries, and powdered sugar. Pancakes aren&rsquo;t inherently 
unhealthy, but with sugary toppings and huge portion sizes, this is the last 
thing you want to start your day.<br>
<strong>Yellow Light: Pineapple Mango 
Smoothie</strong> <br>
 Compared to stacked pancakes and decadent French toast, 
it sounds virtuous &ndash; but it certainly won&rsquo;t fuel you through your 
morning classes. Pineapples and mangoes are among the fruits highest in sugar, 
and vanilla yogurt can contain more than 30 grams of sugar (that&rsquo;s 7.5 
teaspoons!) per six ounces. This smoothie might be relatively low in calories, 
but it&rsquo;ll also spur a quick rise and fall in blood sugar &ndash; leaving 
you hungry and grumpy soon after breakfast. 
<p><br>
<strong>Green Light: Eat Your Veggies Omelette</strong><br>
 With 
tomatoes, peppers, spinach, onions, mushrooms, and three eggs, this breakfast 
is the perfect blend of fiber and protein. Recent research has shown that 350 
calories of protein- and fiber-rich fare is the best bet to stay full and 
energized throughout the morning. Sub the JNJ potatoes for a side of fruit to 
cut even more calories and fat.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Soy Japanese Grill</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Red Light: Chicken Katsu</strong><br>
 Chicken Katsu is essentially 
the Japanese version of fried chicken; in this dish, breaded and deep-fried 
chicken cutlets are paired with a mound of rice, salad, and miso soup. The 
chicken alone can pack in more than 500 calories and 30 grams of fat; add to 
that a typical restaurant portion of white rice and an oily dressing, and the 
meal could easily surpass 1,200 calories.<br>
<strong>Yellow Light: Salmon Plate
</strong><br>
 Provided you don&rsquo;t finish the four or more servings of 
rice on the Salmon Plate, this is a relatively safe choice. The salmon is 
charbroiled, a method of cooking that uses minimal oil and better, and it comes 
with two salads. Ask for the dressing and teriyaki sauce on the side though: 
most restaurant versions are packed with oil, sugar, and salt.<br>
<strong>
Green Light: Washington Roll</strong><br>
 Soy&rsquo;s Washington Roll is a 
California Roll topped with protein-packed salmon. A typical California Roll 
carries 255 calories; the salmon sashimi topping adds another 140 calories and 
is rich in omega-3 fatty acids which promote cardiovascular health. Paired with 
Soy&rsquo;s daily salad (dressing on the side!) and an order of edemame, this 
is a light and tasty Japanese meal.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Traddies</strong></em></p> 
<p><strong>Red Light: Trojan Horse (Vodka, Rum, Gin, Orange Juice, Pineapple 
Juice, Traddies Sour Mix, Float of Brandy)</strong><br>
 This drink &ndash; 
served in a 27 ounce schooner &ndash; is automatically the worst pick on the 
spirits menu due to its colossal size. With four different types of liquor 
(each 1.5 ounce shot of alcohol packs 97 calories), two sugar-packed juices, 
and sour mix, this drink could easily surpass 1,300 calories &ndash; more than 
two-thirds of your recommended daily calorie intake.<br>
<strong>Yellow Light: 
The Tank (Bacardi 151, Wild Turkey, and coke)</strong><br>
 This cocktail is 
essentially a whiskey-spiked rum and coke. There are about 100 empty calories 
in 8 ounces of coke, but even diet coke is a bad choice: studies show that 
drinking diet soda is correlatedwith wider waistlines.<br>
<strong>Green Light: 
Vodka Martini</strong><br>
 Even though it&rsquo;s not on the spirits menu, any 
bar can whip up a vodka martini. This is your best choice for a night out, 
simply because it&rsquo;s not bogged down by mixers and excess calories. Spice 
it up with lemon slices or olives.</p>

<h2>Red Light, Green Light: The Best and Worst Picks for Dining&nbsp;Out</h2> 
Posted on February 28, 2012 | Leave a comment <br>

<p>When you dine out, sometimes you just want to hit a new Thai restaurant, or 
the tried-and-true burger joint, or the Italian eatery right down the street 
&ndash; instead of that organic, raw, macrobiotic restaurant that is undeniably 
healthy. Eating out is a treat, and it can (and should) be a part of a healthy 
diet. Follow this &ldquo;stoplight&rdquo; cheat sheet to learn how to order 
yummy food without breaking the calorie or trans fat bank. The red light means 
stop: this dish is one of the least healthy in the restaurant, and you can 
probably find a healthier but equally tasty meal. The yellow light means 
approach with caution: this isn&rsquo;t the healthiest choice on the menu, but 
you can splurge on it from time to time. And of course, the green light means 
go right ahead: this dish is balanced with protein, vegetables, and whole grain 
carbs (and it&rsquo;s more filling than a cup of soup or a bowl of edamame!).

<h2>Linguine with Steamed Mussels, Puttanesca&nbsp;Style</h2> Posted on 
February 24, 2012 | Leave a comment <br>
 As a half-Belgian, I&rsquo;m 
genetically predisposed to love mussels. I do not, however, love French fries 
&ndash; the usual accompaniment to mussels &ndash; so I decided to pair them 
with a different starch: whole wheat pasta. But instead of a heavy pasta dish 
scattered with mussels, this dish features mussels and a tangy tomato sauce, 
with whole wheat pasta added for fiber and a little bulk. Mussels are 
comparable in price to chicken, easy to prepare, and a tasty source of lean 
protein.<br>

<p></p> <strong>Ingredients</strong> <br>
 1.5 lbs mussels, scrubbed and 
debearded<br>
 2-3 anchovy fillets <br>
 3-4 garlic cloves, minced <br>
 Olive 
oil<br>
 28 ounce can San Marzano tomatoes <br>
 &frac14; &ndash; &frac12; cup 
sliced, pitted kalamata olives<br>
 2 T capers, drained <br>
 Red pepper 
flakes, to taste<br>
 Salt, to taste <br>
 Chopped parsley, basil <br>
 Whole 
wheat linguine<br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p><strong>Method</strong></p> 
<p>Prepare linguine according to packaged directions.</p> 
<p>Heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and anchovy fillets; saute 
until fillets appear to &ldquo;melt.&rdquo; Add can of San Marzano tomatoes, 
and allow to simmer for 4-6 minutes. Add red pepper flakes, salt, and half of 
each of the capers and olives. Turn up the heat and cover pot with lid. When 
sauce begins to boil, add mussels; cover with top again. Mussels should pop 
open in about three to five minutes. Discard any unopened mussels. Serve 
generously over pasta; garnish with parsley, basil, and salt, to taste.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Why should you eat this?</strong><br>
 Mussels are an incredibly 
lean source of protein, offering muscle-building amino acids with a fraction of 
the fat or calories of red meat. Mussels, as well as other clams and oysters, 
are one of the best dietary sources of vitamin B12, providing 340% of the 
recommended daily value. Vitamin B12 supports the metabolism of macronutrients 
and facilitates the proper development of nerve cells and red blood cells. 
Mussels are also high in selenium, a trace mineral with antioxidant properties, 
and iodine, which is necessary for thyroid function and metabolism.</p> 
<p>The pairing of tomatoes with omega-3 fatty acids (from three sources: olive 
oil, mussels, and anchovies) makes this dish a potent fighter against oxidative 
stress. Tomatoes are high in lycopene, a carotenoid that has been shown in 
studies to support cardiovascular health by lowering the risk oflipid 
peroxidation and to protect against some types of cancer. Even better, studies 
show that lycopene becomes four times more bioavailable when it is either 
heated or paired with healthy fats &ndash; both of which happen in this dish. 
Newer research has also shown that lycopene may reverse and protect against 
some of the DNA damage done by UV rays, so load up on fat-spiked tomatoes for 
added sun protection for your upcoming Spring Break trip!</p>

<h2>Healthy Valentine&rsquo;s Day&nbsp;Foods</h2> Posted on February 10, 2012 |
Leave a comment <br>

<p>A huge box of chocolates, a shared plate of spaghetti and meatballs, a 
heart-shaped red velvet cake: Valentine&rsquo;s Day is certainly not the time 
to shy away from indulgent foods. But your dinner doesn&rsquo;t have to be a 
caloric feast. Many foods &ndash; some common, some exotic &ndash; with 
historically aphrodisiac roots are high in valuable nutrients &ndash; and boost 
your mood at the same time.</p> 
<p><strong>Figs</strong><br>
 Featured prominently in the Bible, many scholars 
believe the fig was actually theforbidden fruit picked by Eve, giving it 
it&rsquo;s first scandalous reputation. Ancient Romans believed figs were a 
gift from the god of intoxication, Bacchus, while in ancient Greece, figs were 
symbols of love and fertility. And even with their sweet, honey-like taste, 
figs are still considered a healthy treat: with 14 grams of fiber per cup 
(broccoli has 5 grams), they are one of the highest plant-based sources of 
fiber. In addition to protecting against breast and colon cancer and lowering 
cholesterol, fiber helps in weight management. And don&rsquo;t throw away the 
famous fig leaves that once covered Adam and Eve: several studies have shown 
that they have anti-diabetic properties by reducing the amount of insulin 
needed.</p> 
<p><strong>Oysters</strong><br>
 The word &ldquo;aphrodisiac&rdquo; actually 
originated with an oyster, when the goddess of love Aphrodite rose from the sea 
in an oyster shell. Since then, oysters, as well as other mollusks, have been 
regarded as the ultimatefood of love. Low in calories and high in protein (six 
contain just 57 calories and 6 grams of protein), they&rsquo;re an excellent 
choice for an appetizer. While salmon gets all the omega-3 hype, oysters are 
high in the fatty acids as well, which contribute to a healthy heart and fight 
inflammation. They&rsquo;re also the richest source of zinc, a mineral that 
contributes to a healthy immune system and may even reduce depression and 
anger. If you can&rsquo;t stomach raw oysters, don&rsquo;t mar their delicate 
taste with cream or butter; they&rsquo;re just as delicious poached, steamed, 
baked, or roasted with a squirt of lemon juice, salt, and herbs.</p> 
<p><strong>Asparagus</strong><br>
 17th century herbalist Nicholas Culpepper 
wrote that asparagus &ldquo;stirs up lust in man and woman.&rdquo; He may have 
been on to something: a 2011 study published in the<em>International Journal of 
Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Research</em> found that extracts of asparagus 
significantly exerted aphrodisiac properties in male rats. Asparagus is rich in 
inulin, a type of soluble fiber that travels undigested to the large intestine 
and acts as a prebiotic (as a food source for probiotics like Lactobacilli). In 
studies, inulin has also been found to increase calcium absorption, making it 
the only food source (apart from calcium) that effectively improves bone 
mineral density. In addition to being high in potassium, folic acid, choline, 
biotin, and vitamins A, C, E, and K, the National Cancer Center has named 
asparagus as the top food source of glutathione, one of the most powerful 
antioxidants in the body. Serve asparagus roasted with truffles, another 
lust-boosting food.</p> 
<p><strong>Chocolate</strong><br>
<strong></strong>Chocolate &ndash; the 
ultimate Valentine&rsquo;s Day food and the number one craving of American 
women &ndash; contains a cocktail of compoundsthat contribute to both health 
and those loving feelings. With anandamide (a molecule that mimics THC), 
phenylethylamine, and theobromine, it has been found to increase the release of 
the bliss-inducing neurotransmitter dopamine. And adding more bang to your 
happiness buck, it&rsquo;s one of the few sweet treats that actually has some 
nutritional value: its flavanols are known to protect against cancer and heart 
disease and lower blood pressure. Other antioxidants boost cognitive
performance, including memory, attention span, problem solving, and reaction 
time. Stick with one ounce a day and pick a bar with at least 70% cacao (skip 
the generic supermarket Russell Stover box!); milk may hinder the absorption of 
antioxidants, while added sugar negates its benefits.</p> 
<p><strong>Truffles</strong><br>
 In 1825, French gastronome Jean-Anthelme 
Brillat-Savarin wrote that the truffle &ldquo;awakens lustful and erotic 
memories&rdquo; among both genders. And although he didn&rsquo;t know it, their 
musky scent is reminiscent of the male pheromone androstenone. Apparently, it 
attracts both sows, how eagerlydig up the truffles, and female humans. Truffles 
are high in protein, containing all the essential amino acids, making them an 
ideal source for vegetarians. Like other mushrooms, they stimulate the immune 
system and and inhibit tumor growth. Because they&rsquo;re so rare, truffles 
are extremely expensive (recently, three pounds sold for $300,000!). But their 
rich and intense taste comes with even tiny amounts, and allows you to cut back 
on fat and salt for flavoring.</p>

<h2>Super Bowl Sunday: The Best and Worst&nbsp;Dips</h2> Posted on February 4, 
2012 | 1 Comment <br>
 Dips are as big a part of the Super Bowl as chicken 
wings and a six-pack. And just like wings and a six-pack, some of them come 
with tons of empty calories, salt, and fat. Find out which dips are packed with 
nutrients, fiber, and protein, and learn how to transform your favorite dip 
into a healthy topper.<br>
<br>
<strong>Dips to pick</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>Salsa (per 2 tablespoons: 6 calories, 0 g fat, 0 g protein, 1 g fiber)
</em><br>
 Packed with tomatoes, peppers, onion, cilantro, jalape&ntilde;o, and 
spices, salsa is loaded with nutrients and flavor &ndash; and for minimal 
calories. Tomatoes add a dose of cancer-fighting lycopene, while the capsaicin 
in jalape&ntilde;os revs metabolism and helps improve cardiovascular health. 
Scientists have also recently isolated the compound dodecenal in cilantro, 
which has been found to kill Salmonella strains as twice as effectively as a 
common antibiotic. Add kick, and more nutrients, to your salsa with black 
beans, mango, and avocado cubes.</p> 
<p><em>Hummus (per 2 tablespoons: 50 calories, 2 g fat, 2 g protein, 2 g fiber)
</em><br>
 A chickpea-based spread that hails from the Middle East, hummus is a 
good source ofboth protein and fiber, making it a snack with staying power. It 
is high in iron, vitamin C, folate, and vitamin B6, and tahini (a blend of 
sesame seeds) and olive oil add monounsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids. 
If your team loses on Super Bowl Sunday, have an extra serving of hummus: 
Israeli researchers believe the high tryptophan content of chickpeas may 
increase the amount of the feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin, thereby 
alleviating depression.</p> 
<p><em>Tzatziki (per 2 tablespoons: 50 calories, 1.7 g fat, 5.2 g protein, 0.2 
g fiber)</em><br>
 Tzatziki is a traditional Greek dip made with yogurt, 
cucumber,lemon juice, and garlic. Often served with greasy, fatty gyro and 
souvlaki dishes, it offers a tangy, refreshing taste, but you can also serve it 
with fresh vegetables. Yogurt provides muscle-building protein as well as 
probiotics to improve digestion, and cucumbers offer a surprising amount of 
antioxidants, including quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol. Whip up your 
tzatziki with nonfat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to squeeze out more 
protein and less saturated fat.</p> 
<p><em>Guacamole (per 2 tablespoons: 50 calories, 4.5 g fat, 0.6 g protein, 
1.5 g fiber)</em><br>
 Although it gets a bad rap for being high in fat and 
calories, guacamole is incrediblynutrient-dense. Avocados contain high amounts 
of monounsaturated fats, which reduce the risk of heart disease and improve 
insulin sensitivity. Other studies have found that avocados, while not touted 
as a superfruit, are comparatively high in antioxidants. Add chopped tomato and 
bell pepper to your guac: the fats in avocados increase the absorption of 
beta-carotene and lycopene up to 400%.</p> 
<p><strong>Dips to Skip</strong></p> 
<p><em>Spinach and Artichoke Dip (per 2 tablespoons: 120 calories, 12 g fat, 
1.2 g protein, 0 g fiber)</em><br>
This virtuous-sounding dip is misleading; 
instead of a base of vegetables, most recipes call for huge amounts of cream 
cheese, mayonnaise, a medley of melted cheeses, and sour cream. The spinach and 
artichoke skillet even manages to pack in 1610 calories and 103 grams of fat! 
If your Super Bowl Sunday won&rsquo;t be the same without it, whip up a 
lightened-up version that adds creaminess with white beans and flavor with 
capers and lemon juice, like this version fromHealth Magazine.</p> 
<p><em>Queso (per 2 tablespoons: 90 calories, 70 g fat, 3 g protein, 0 g fiber)
</em><br>
 A staple of Tex-Mex cuisine, queso is a creamy dip made primarily of 
cheese, often with tomatoes, beans, or peppers added for flavor. At best, queso 
is simply high in calories and fat; at worst, the jarred versions are filled 
with additives, preservatives, and trans fats. Skip the queso altogether; if 
you&rsquo;re craving a creamy dip, pick one based off blended beans, and if 
you&rsquo;re looking for cheese, nosh on a few squares of sharp cheddar.</p> 
<p><em>Crab Dip (per 2 tablespoons: 124 calories, 10 g fat, 6 g protein, 0 g 
fiber)</em><br>
With lean seafood as an ingredient, this dip may sound healthy; 
but like spinach and artichoke dip, the crab only plays a supporting role to 
cream cheese, mayonnaise, cheese, and sour cream. Pick five large shrimp with 
one tablespoon of cocktail sauce to save 74 calories and knock off 10 grams of 
fat for the same succulent seafood taste.</p> 
<p><em>Seven-Layer Dip (per 2 tablespoons: 80 calories, 6 g fat, 2 g protein, 
2 g fiber)</em><br>
 This layered dip is dangerous for two reasons: with layer 
upon layer of dip, you don&rsquo;t exactly know what you&rsquo;re putting on 
your chip, and, because of those layers, each chip is piled precariously high 
with each flavorful layer, making for one high-calorie bite. The dish is, after 
all, layer after layer of fat (and it&rsquo;s not the good kind like in 
guacamole): fatty cheese, greasy beef, refried beans, sour cream&hellip;If 
you&rsquo;re after a dip with Mexican flare, choose a black bean dip with 
chopped tomato and cilantro. Black beans contain protein and fiber and help 
regulate blood sugar, keeping you satisfied until half time.</p>

<h2>Eat Healthfully While Traveling&nbsp;Abroad</h2> Posted on January 31, 2012
| Leave a comment <br>

<p>Eating healthfully can be hard enough when you&rsquo;re in the comfort of 
your own kitchen, with Whole Foods, farmer&rsquo;s markets, and recipe books at 
your disposal. But traveling abroad adds a new set of nutritional diversions: 
bad airport and plane food, the excitement of sampling new cuisines, a 
different language, bouncing from hotel to hostel to bed and breakfast&hellip;
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I recently spent two weeks in Argentina and Chile visiting my sister, who 
lives in Bariloche. As the always-hungry person I am, I had to prepare for a 
brand new food culture as well as long days traveling (it took us 30 hours to 
get home). With these tips and a bit of research, you can maintain a healthy 
diet half way around the world.</p> 
<p><strong>Plan for the airport and the plane.</strong></p> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re travelling abroad, you may spend a whole day &ndash; or 
more &ndash; in airports, on planes, and in cars. Take these steps to ensure 
you have healthy, nutritious food for your long traveling day!</p> 
<p><em>Pack a whole meal &ndash; or more</em>. Airport food can be both 
ridiculously expensiveand limited in healthy choices (McDonald&rsquo;s, 
Cinnabon, and Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts are the most common). And plane food &ndash; 
unless you&rsquo;re flying first class &ndash; is generally horrible. On your 
way to the airport, pick up your favorite healthy sandwich. Once you&rsquo;re 
sitting on the plane, you&rsquo;ll be happy to have a healthy meal while your 
fellow passengers eat Big Macs and fries.</p> 
<p><em>Pack fruits and vegetables</em>. Planes are pretty skimpy with food 
these days, so you&rsquo;ll need healthy snacks to tide you over. Instead of 
resorting to convenience store treats and candy, pack fruits, vegetables, and
nuts in your carry-on. Before you leave, make a stop at the grocery store to 
pick up apples and bananas. Bite-size produce &ndash; like blueberries, baby 
carrots, and snap peas &ndash; are ideal because they travel well, and their 
similar-to-candy size helps keep M&amp;M and Skittles cravings at bay. Pick up 
some nuts at the grocery store, too; unlike airport trail mixes, they 
won&rsquo;t be mixed with heavy ingredients like yogurt-covered pretzels and 
banana chips. Filling yourself up with fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts will 
help you maintain your already healthy diet and keep you energized through your 
long day.</p> 
<p><em>Order a special meal</em>. When you book your tickets, most airlines 
allow you to choose a &ldquo;special meal.&rdquo; Many have broad choices these 
days that cater to a wide range of diets: diabetic meal, gluten intolerant 
meal, Hindu meal, and low-caloriemeal are just a few of the options. Opt for a 
low-fat or low-calorie meal &ndash; not because fat and calories are inherently 
bad, but because those meals are simply healthier. Their virtue lies in the 
fact that the meal comes with lean protein and vegetables and most importantly, 
without the heavy, creamy sauces that usually ruin (in taste and nutrition) the 
regular meals. On our plane down to Chile, my parents looked on with jealousy 
as I ate my fruit plate and high-fiber cereal; their regular breakfast was 
pancakes covered in a sugary fruit compote.</p> 
<p><strong>Travel with nutrition boosting &ldquo;condiments&rdquo;.</strong>
<br> Foods like chia seeds, ground flaxseed, and hempseed are tiny packets of 
big nutrition. Such &ldquo;condiments&rdquo; can add a considerable amount of 
protein, fiber, monounsaturated fats, vitamins, or antioxidants to a meal that 
might need a nutrition bump. A tablespoonof chia seeds, for example, has 68 
calories, 2 grams of protein, 5.5 grams of fiber, and 4.5 grams of fat. I 
always carry a mix of chia seeds, ground flaxseed, and cinnamon to add to 
oatmeal and cereal, as well asJustin&rsquo;s Nut Butter Squeeze Packets, which 
add protein and fiber to toast or apple and banana slices. Research shows that 
adding fat or protein to high-carbohydrate meals lessens the impact on blood 
sugar, making these foods a great pairing for the white toast and refined 
cereal your hotel might serve.</p> 
<p><strong>Travel with mini-meals</strong>.<br>
 When you&rsquo;re abroad, you 
often don&rsquo;t have a kitchen &ndash; let alone a refrigerator &ndash; to
hold the snacks that would normally tide you over between meals. Instant 
oatmeal and snack bars are whole grain options that only require hot water to 
prepare. Look for bars with at least 3 grams of fiber, 5 grams of protein, and 
no more than 18 grams of sugar &ndash;Larabars, KIND bars, Pure bars, and 
Bumble Bars are good choices. They&rsquo;ll give you the energy you need to 
trek around town (or up a mountain) and to your next meal.</p> 
<p><strong>Check out the grocery store</strong>.<br>
 Just because 
you&rsquo;re on vacation doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to avoid the grocery 
store. Stock up on grab-and-go fruits and vegetableslike apples, bananas, 
carrots, and snap peas. Having produce on hand for snacks is especially 
important, since you&rsquo;re most likely dining out more than normal and 
forgoing tedious salads for local specialties. In most countries, you&rsquo;ll 
also be able to find yogurt &ndash; a convenient, fast breakfast or snack. Look 
for varieties without added sugar; luckily, most other cultures actually prefer 
plain yogurt to the sickeningly sweet American varieties. Bonus: the probiotics 
found in yogurt will help improve digestion, which can get out of whack when 
traveling.</p> 
<p><strong>Embrace the local food culture</strong>.</p> 
<p><em>Savor the local delicacies, but don&rsquo;t go overboard</em>. When you 
travel abroad, you&rsquo;re sure to find that each country has a few culinary 
specialties. Some arehealthy, and some are far from it &ndash; but that 
doesn&rsquo;t mean you should completely avoid them in the name of nutrition. 
Argentina, for example, is famous for its huge offerings of meat.<em>Asados</em>
, the Argentinian barbecue, consists of course after course of meats: ribs, 
steaks, lamb, pork, chorizo, and blood sausages are common in<em>just one meal
</em>. And Bariloche, specifically, is known for <em>milanesa</em> &ndash; 
breaded, fried meat piled high with melted cheese &ndash; and fondue 
(there&rsquo;s a large Swiss and German influence). But next to these cheesy, 
fried, fatty cuts of meat, there&rsquo;salso a healthy choice: Bariloche is a 
mountain town based around a lake, so fresh and smoked trout make an appearance 
on most menus. Most other cuisines have specialties that end up on both sides 
of the spectrum: Japan has sashimi and tempura, France has<em>moules mariniere
</em> and croque monsieur. The key is in enjoying the local delicacies in 
moderation &ndash; you don&rsquo;t need to eat them every day! Find a 
restaurant that specializes in what you really want (or better yet, if you have 
friends in the area, get an invitation to a home-cooked meal!) and savor each 
bite. Sandwich your indulgent day with healthy, vegetable-packed meals.</p> 
<p><em>Pick up some new recipes and eating habits</em>.<br>
 With more than 
two-thirds of the population obese or overweight, America is the fattest nation 
among those with advanced economies. With a culture based around fast food and 
little exercise, we could stand to take a couple of pointersfrom our 
healthier-eating counterparts. When you&rsquo;re abroad, take note of the 
healthy recipes and eating habits that you encounter. In Chile and Argentina, 
instead of caffeinating with whipped cream and caramel-covered frappuccinos, 
the locals prefer to start their day with yerba mate, a tea-like infusion made 
from leaves of the holly tree. The drink is filled with vitamins, minerals, and 
antioxidants and provides the same boost of coffee without the crash. From 
South America to Europe to Asia, there are plenty of other eating habits to 
emulate: eat your sandwiches open-faced to cut out refined sugars like the 
Swedes, eat small dishes like the Chinese&rsquo;<em>dim sum</em> or 
Greeks&rsquo;<em>mezze</em>, and use a heavy hand with spices as in Thailand 
and India.</p> 
<p><em>Learn a few phrases in the local language</em>.<br>
 If your 
Spanish/French/Thai/Arabic language skills are poor, ordering meals in 
restaurants can be difficult. Of course, having a sisterwho is fluent in 
Spanish is your best bet for ensuring a delicious and healthy dinner; arming 
yourself with a dictionary with culinary terms is also helpful. Memorize a few 
phrases that will always improve the nutrition of any meal. Because many 
restaurants (all over the world) rely on heavy amounts of butter and oil for 
flavor, ask for your fish, meat, and vegetables to be prepared<em>sin aceite
</em> (without oil) or <em>sin mantequilla</em> (without butter). It&rsquo;s 
also helpful to learn adjectives that describe the preparation of a food; the 
difference between<em>vegetales al vapor</em> (steamed vegetables) and <em>
vegetales salteadas</em> (sauteed vegetables) is huge.</p> 
<p>Maintaining your healthy diet while traveling abroad will give you the 
energy toexplore and enjoy a new country. And while it is tempting to 
completely indulge &ndash; you&rsquo;re on vacation, after all &ndash; stuffing 
your body with excess fats, sweets, and alcohol will only weigh you down. As 
long as your keep your daily calories in check, remember that at the end of the 
year, your body won&rsquo;t remember a two-week stretch where you barely ate a 
single vegetable. Upon returning to your beloved kitchen and local grocery 
store, load up on fresh produce, whole grains, lean protein, and nuts to 
continue your healthy eating plan.</p>

<h2>Quinoa Salad with Mango and&nbsp;Chicken</h2> Posted on January 22, 2012 | 
1 Comment <br>
 One-pot meals incorporate grains, vegetables, and lean protein 
into one dish, combining a smorgasbord of nutrients into one perfectly balanced 
meal. Another benefit: with all your ingredients in one bowl, you can eliminate 
the guesswork of deciding which sides to serve with your main dish. With 
high-protein quinoa and chicken &ndash; and because you can make it ahead 
&ndash; this meal is a great post-workout option. Adding finely chopped kale 
bulks up the dish and adds powerful antioxidants without overshadowing the 
tropical taste of mango, cilantro, and mint.<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
<strong></strong>&frac34; cup quinoa<br>
1 
cup chicken or vegetable broth<br>
 &frac12; cup water<br>
 4 chicken breasts
<br> 1 &frac12; mango<br>
 1 red bell pepper<br>
 &frac14; cup chopped green 
onion<br>
 3 T lemon juice<br>
 Lemon zest<br>
 1 &frac12; T olive oil<br>
 1 T 
red wine vinegar<br>
 3 kale leaves, chopped<br>
 &frac14; &ndash; &frac12; cup 
cilantro, to taste, chopped<br>
 &frac14; &ndash; &frac12;&nbsp;cup mint, to 
taste, chopped<br>
 Salt and pepper to taste</p> <strong>Method</strong>  1. 
Fill a saucepan with water and chicken or vegetable broth and quinoa; bring to 
a boil. Reduce heat to medium low; simmer for 15 minutes or until liquid is 
absorbed. Fluff with a fork and cool in refrigerator.<br>
 2. Grill chicken; 
allow to cool and then slice into strips.<br>
 3. Dice mango and red bell 
pepper; chop kale, scallions, cilantro, and mint.<br>
 4. Zest lemon. Whisk 
together lemon juice, olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper.<br>
 5. 
Toss quinoa with dressing; add mango, red bell pepper, kale, scallions, 
cilantro, and mint. Top with sliced chicken.<br>
 6. Garnish with cilantro, 
mint, and lemon zest; season to taste with salt and pepper.If you want more 
greens, serve over a bed of kale, arugula, or spinach. <br>

<p><strong>Why should you eat this?</strong><br>
 Like the Chicken and 
Vegetable Stir-Fry, this dish is packed with clean, functional foods &ndash; 
perfect for &ldquo;the day after&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve splurged and want to get 
back on track. It&rsquo;s also an ideal post-workout meal for athletes: 29 
grams of protein will help rebuild muscle fibers, and complex carbohydrate from 
quinoa will restore lose glycogen. Quinoa is also rich source of calcium 
&ndash; necessary for proper muscle contraction &ndash; and potassium, to 
promote proper hydration. Kale is colored with chlorophyll, a pigment that 
oxygenates the blood and improves red blood cell counts to help you power 
through future workouts, and mangoes contain flavanoids that reduce 
inflammation.</p> 
<p>Since this meal is best served chilled, make it on Sunday and use it as a 
quick stand-in meal on busy nights or bring it to the office for an easy lunch.
