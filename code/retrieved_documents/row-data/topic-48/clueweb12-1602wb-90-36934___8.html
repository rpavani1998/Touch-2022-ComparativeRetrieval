<h2>MTT: Mushroom, Pea and Tarragon Pot Pies</h2> Tuesday, December 13th, 2011 
<p></p> 
<p>We get together with some very lovely friends of ours every month or so to 
eat, drink and laugh. We became friends about the same time Will and I became a 
couple (so I guess about 8 years ago) and love them to pieces. There&rsquo;s 
nothing better than our raucous night full of wine, food, conversation and 
Guitar Hero (apart from that time we drank the 1982 bottle of red that was 
older than me. That did not feel good the next day). But these sorts of 
soulmate friends are bigger than supremely corked wine: they&rsquo;re for life.
</p> 
<p>These friends we have (hi, Rupert and Su!) are perfect in every way but 
one. They are both vegetarians*.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As we&rsquo;ve been friends for so long I&rsquo;ve stopped banging on about 
the whole &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you miss bacon?!&rdquo; thing, especially 
since they have started eating fish, and I now enjoy the challenge of meat-free 
cooking for them. I don&rsquo;t like to use quorn or other equivalents so try 
and get my inspiration elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Rupert and Su were supposed to come and visit this Friday but didn&rsquo;t 
due to poor Elfie getting rushed into hospital (more on that soon) so I found 
myself with some left over vegetarian ingredients to cook with this week.</p> 
<p>Therefore I give you my mushroom, pea and tarragon pie; good enough to eat 
even if you&rsquo;re a carnivore and easy enough to add meat to if you 
can&rsquo;t face a meatfree meal.</p> 
<p><em>*This is a joke, I don&rsquo;t have anything against vegetarians. 
Although, don&rsquo;t you miss bacon?</em></p>

<li>100g quartered chestnut mushrooms</li> 
<li>100g halved and sliced portobello mushrooms</li>

has evaporated.</li> 
<li>Add the peas, tarragon and cream. Bubble up for a couple of minutes and 
season with salt and pepper.</li> 
<li>Cut 2 puff pastry lids according to the size of the dishes you are using, 
or use 1 larger one (I do this by putting my dishes face down on the pastry and 
cutting one cm around). Seal the edges with a fork.</li> 
<li>If you&rsquo;re quick you can create some fancy pastry art on to put on 
top (I did an &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;W&rsquo; for &lsquo;Alice&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Will&rsquo;). I wasn&rsquo;t quick enough in the photographed example 
and my lids sunk a bit.</li>

<h2>MTT: Monday Pie</h2> Tuesday, September 20th, 2011 
<p></p> 
<p>My husband is a bit of a traditionalist &ndash; we both are. Will likes 
roast dinners in the winter, watching rugby on a Sunday, bringing home the 
bacon and Monday Pies. Monday Pies are a Harold family institution, something 
his mum used to cook often whilst he was growing up. So when I&rsquo;m trying 
to get in the good books or if I&rsquo;ve been in the dog house I will make my 
hardworkin&rsquo; man a weekend roast followed by a Monday Pie. It&rsquo;s like 
a very British Dolly Parton song.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This reason for this week&rsquo;s Monday Pie was simple: Will let me have 
three lie-ins over the weekend. THREE! What a man.&nbsp;The way to his heart 
may be his stomach but the way to my heart is most definitely through my 
snoozes.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The brilliance of Monday pie is that it&rsquo;s totally cobbled together 
yet tastes amazing, for me it&rsquo;s the best pie on earth. 
The&nbsp;components&nbsp;are quite simply: Pastry (shortcrust or puff, homemade 
or shop-bought), leftover roast meat (this week I used&nbsp;lamb),&nbsp;onions, 
2 x veg,&nbsp;and gravy. If I&rsquo;m making my own shortcrust pastry I will 
faithfully stick toDelia&rsquo;s by-hand method&nbsp;and will use 220g of flour 
to 110g of fat (55g butter/55g beef dripping&hellip; oh yeah that&rsquo;s how I 
roll). I never make my own puff pastry because, really, who can be bothered 
when there&rsquo;s jus rol?</p>

 Recipe type: Main <br>
 Prep time: 
30 mins <br>
 Cook time: 25 mins <br>
 Total time: 55 mins <br>
 Serves: 4 <br>

 Ingredients 
<ul> 
<li>1 quantity pastry (see above)</li> 
<li>Leftover roast meat (I used just under a quarter of a shoulder of slow 
roasted lamb)</li> 
<li>1 onion</li> 
<li>Any fresh herbs (I used a couple of sprigs each of rosemary and thyme)</li>
<li>2 large handfuls of assorted veg (this week mine was made up from 100g 
green beans and a handful of frozen peas)</li> 
<li>100ml wine (red for dark meat, white for light meat)</li> 
<li>400ml chicken stock</li> 
<li>1 beef stock cube</li> 
<li>2 tsp bisto</li> </ul>  Instructions 
<ol> 
<li>Start out by preparing your pastry and bringing it to room temperature.
</li> 
<li>Slice the onion in half and then lengthways. Fry off in oil on a medium 
heat and add your veg and herbs (if you&rsquo;re using any frozen veg it should 
be added at the end).</li> 
<li>Add meat and cook through.</li> 
<li>Turn up the pan slightly and deglaze the pan with wine; leave to simmer 
for 5 minutes.</li> 
<li>Add the chicken stock bit by bit, stirring all the time.</li> 
<li>Crumble in the stock cube and add the bisto. Stir until a gravy 
consistency is reached.</li> 
<li>Roll out pastry to about half a centimetre thick. Tip pie filling into 
dish and scatter any frozen veg on top.</li> 
<li>Place pastry on top of dish and seal with your fingers. Prick a couple of 
times with a fork and brush over a light egg wash.</li> 
<li>Cook at 180 degrees until golden brown on top &ndash; around 25 minutes.

<h2>The More Than Toast diet #1</h2> Sunday, July 3rd, 2011 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working pretty hard recently to shift those last 10lbs of 
baby weight. I don&rsquo;t like to exercise, I like deep fried stuff and I 
drink too much wine. Admittedly it&rsquo;s not the best recipe for weightloss, 
but I&rsquo;m persevering with a lot of powerwalking when I go shopping.</p> 
<p>During pregnancy I put on three and a half stone. Three of them have been 
banished but the last 7lbs are proving to be pretty stubborn. My mummy jelly 
belly is still well and truly in residence and I&rsquo;ve come to the 
conclusion that I am slightly wheat intolerant; there ain&rsquo;t nothing like 
my post-pizza bloat. Which is a shame, because I bloody love sandwiches, toast, 
pasta, cakes&hellip;</p> 
<p>I came up with some rules that I wanted to adhere to in order to become 
healthier, and hopefully slightly smaller-of-tum:</p> 
<p>- Drink lots of water<br>
 - Eat lots of salad<br>
 - Don&rsquo;t eat white 
bread, pizza or pasta (or refined carbs in general)<br>
 - Stay away from deep 
fried stuff, cheese (esp. deep fried cheese) and chocolate HobNobs<br>
 - Eat 
three meals a day<br>
 - Allow myself the odd treat and make sure I still enjoy 
my meals (do not want to lose the will to eat)</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve started keeping a weekly&nbsp;visual food diary which has really 
helped me stop and think about what I eat on a day-to-day basis. What would 
stop me eating three chocolate HobNobs for breakfast other than having to share 
that fact with the internet?</p> 
<p>The first installment is a little odd as there were two days of stomach bug 
when I didn&rsquo;t eat or drink anything but water (and briefly lost 4lbs), 
the day of CyberMummy when I was so busy looking for food I devoured it as soon 
as I found it, and then there is the small matter of that Burger King I forgot 
to photograph. There have also been occasions when I&rsquo;ve tucked into my 
dinner, completely forgetting to take a picture, so all you get are my 
leftovers. Soz!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>(L-R: DINNER: Lamb, sweet potato, broad beans and peas, caramalized 
shallots. BREAKFAST: toast and butter. LUNCH: Avocado and tomato salad with 
balsamic syrup dressing. DINNER: Roast sweet potatoes, mushrooms and salad. 
BREAKFAST: toast and jam. LUNCH: Pastrami and chutney salad with gherkins)</em>
</p> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p><em></em><em></em></p> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p><em>(L-R: Breakfast: Weetabix. LUNCH: Tomato and Onion omelette, avocado 
salad. DINNER:Lamb Koftes. SNACK: Elfie&rsquo;s leftovers. DINNER: Gammon with 
peas and parsley sauce and rosemary roasted new potatoes. DINNER: Steak with 
homemade french fries, salad and roast tomatoes and onions)</em></p> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p><em></em><em></em></p> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p><em>(L-R: LUNCH: (pub) Starter &ndash; Smoked Salmon and prawn parcel 
(1970s style!), Main &ndash; Beer battered fish and chips. LUNCH: Cottage 
cheese with pineapple, cheddar biscuits, cherry tomatoes. DINNER: Smoked Salmon 
and avocado salad with greek yoghurt. LUNCH: (Cafe Rouge) Starter &ndash; 
Chicken Liver Pate, Main &ndash; Spicy Sausage baguette with french fries)</em>
</p> 
<p>I haven&rsquo;t &nbsp;missed as many breakfasts as it looks here: a lot of 
the time I tend to grab a banana whilst Elfie&rsquo;s eating her toast or 
Weetabix. Obviously my &lsquo;no refined carbs&rsquo; rule isn&rsquo;t going as 
well as it could, must try harder in that respect, and I&rsquo;m amazed that 
I&rsquo;ve had two portions of french fries (erm, actually four if you count 
that burger king and then the cheeseburger I had at The Hoxton on the night of 
CyberMummy) in a week! Bad. I eat a lot of salad though, huh? +1 diet point for 
me.</p> 
<p>I will note here that it&rsquo;s a good thing my wine and Pimms consumption 
has not been photographed. Nobody&rsquo;s internet connection is tough enough 
for all the photos that would necessitate.</p> 
<p>On the whole, I&rsquo;d say Diet: 1, Alice: 0. So next week: less white 
bread. Less fries. Less wine.</p>

<h2>MTT: easy lamb koftes with tzatziki</h2> Friday, June 10th, 2011 
<p></p> 
<p>Greece is very special to our little family. The in-laws lived on the 
beautiful island ofMeganissi for a long time and my father-in-law is buried 
there so we will continue to return for holidays as often as possible. 
It&rsquo;s the least touristy place I&rsquo;ve ever visited in Greece; the 
Onassis family own the next-door island and the summer season attracts wealthy 
Greeks and Italians rather than lager-lout Brits. Don&rsquo;t tell anyone 
&ndash; I like to think it&rsquo;s our secret.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of the best things about Meganissi is the food. Stifados &ndash; fried 
aubergine &ndash; fish &ndash; salads &ndash; tzatziki. I always come home 
about 2 stone heavier with a renewed enthusiasm for feta, olives and Greek 
yoghurt.</p> 
<p>As I&rsquo;m still trying to lose the last couple of pounds of baby weight 
I try not to indulge too much but I recently made the discovery that 0% fat 
Greek yoghurt pretty much tastes the same as the fattening stuff. So now 
it&rsquo;s going on everything; breakfast, posh prawn cocktail, pudding, and my 
personal favourite: tzatziki.</p> 
<p>These lamb koftes are super easy to make, healthy and really delicious. 
Plus, when cooked, they look a little bit like poo. Always good.</p> 
<p>Easy lamb koftes with tzatziki</p> 
<p><em>Serves 2 hungry people</em><br>
 500g lamb mince<br>
 Handful fresh 
mint, finely chopped<br>
 Handful fresh parsley, finely chopped<br>
 Teaspoon 
cinnamon<br>
 Teaspoon cumin<br>
 Half a red onion, finely diced<br>
 Salt and 
pepper</p> 
<p>3 tbsp 0% fat greek yoghurt<br>
 1/4 of a cucumber, finely sliced<br>
 
Handful fresh mint, finely chopped<br>
 Salt and pepper</p> 
<p>Wraps, to serve</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>1. Mix together the mince, herbs, spices, onion and seasoning in a large 
mixing bowl. I like to use a fork or a knife to break up the meat, but then I 
get in there with my hands to smoosh it all together.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>2. Yum. Use your hands to make small sausages, about half the size of 
regular sausages. Put to one side.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>3. I hope your onion was chopped finer than mine. Not very impressive.</p> 
<p>4. In a smaller bowl mix together the remaining mint, cucumber, seasoning 
and yoghurt. Slice the red onion and put to one side.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>5. Heat half a tbsp in a pan on a medium heat and cook the lamb sausages 
until browned all over, about 5 minutes on each side.</p> 
<p>6. Make up the wraps with the sausages, yoghurt mixture and sliced red 
onion. Lettuce optional.</p>

<h2>Review: Maze</h2> Thursday, June 2nd, 2011 
<p><em>(More poor iPhone photography. One of these days I may feel comfortable 
enough to take a DSLR into a restaurant)</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you hadn&rsquo;t already guessed, I like eating. Mine and Will&rsquo;s 
ironic catchphrase is Kate Moss&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nothing taste as skinny feels
&rdquo; because really, it&rsquo;s crap. I have tried repeating it to myself 
over a dish of deep-fried calamari but IT DOESN&rsquo;T WORK.</p> 
<p>Posh eating out is really important to us because it&rsquo;s our couple 
time (apart from the frequent&nbsp;occasions&nbsp;Elfie comes with us and I now 
enjoy judging establishments on how much they accommodate her) as babies 
aren&rsquo;t &nbsp;so welcome in Michelin starred restaurants.</p> 
<p>Having recently visited Jason Atherton&rsquo;s&nbsp;Pollen Street Social we 
were keen to return to Maze, where he was previously Executive Head Chef. Along 
with the recent poor press surrounding Ramsay and Co I wondered if times had 
changed since our last visit in 2008.</p>

<h2>Happy Birthday, Will!</h2> Saturday, May 21st, 2011 
<p>My husband&rsquo;s birthday last weekend was everything a good birthday 
should be: friends, a full wine rack, food, babies, go karting and Eurovision.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A birthday treat to himself was a membership to The Wine Society. Our wine 
rack couldn&rsquo;t hold three cases of wine, so we had to get a new one. Then 
there were spaces in the rack so we had to buy more wine. You get the picture: 
we have a lot of wine right now.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there is more of a decadent starter than steamed 
asparagus and homemade hollandaise (recipe will follow when I drag my face from 
the mixing bowl. So good).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This is Rupert. Rupert&rsquo;s a fan of my hollandaise.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The gorgeous Sea Bass main course was cooked by the Birthday Boy as his 
wife was drunk and too absorbed in Eurovision to spend 30 minutes in the 
kitchen.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>There is nothing like a massive load of cheese for breakfast to get over a 
hangover.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Stilton. Red onion marmalade. Bliss.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Even Elfie got involved (Organix cheesy wheat puffs). Let&rsquo;s ignore 
the fact she&rsquo;s still in her pyjamas at midday.</p> 
<p>Basically it was an amazing weekend but hangovers continue to increase in 
their brutality. Will it ever end?</p>

<h2>MTT: Tuna and Sweetcorn Quiche</h2> Monday, May 16th, 2011 
<p>Now I live in the Home Counties and I&rsquo;m a part-time stay-at-home-mum, 
I&rsquo;ve been thinking I should really get into baking. My mum used to make 
lovely Victoria sponges for my brother and I (and she bought even better 
chocolate cakes from the deli in the next town); these cakes are an aspect of 
my childhood I will always remember really happily. I used to lick my 
brother&rsquo;s plate because it would make him totally freak out. Fun times.
</p> 
<p>I love to cook and do it often, but baking&hellip; not so much. I 
don&rsquo;t like the preciseness of measurements of the ingredients or the fact 
you can&rsquo;t really taste your cooking half way through. It&rsquo;s never 
agreed with me, even moreso since the dawn of the twee cupcake and macaroon.</p>
<p>So for my first attempt at baking in my new kitchen I chose a recipe that 
felt somewhat like a happy medium: a quiche. Everyone loves a quiche.</p> 
<p>My first attempt at shortcrust pastry failed. I have no idea why this is as 
I followed the (Rachael Ray) recipe to the letter, and even started the day by 
driving out to John Lewis to purchase some brand-new digital scales. It was bad 
&ndash; flaky and dry and no amount of trying to fix it with water worked. I 
chucked this lot and Googled for a fail-proof Delia recipe.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>THANKS RACHAEL.</p> 
<p>I was so busy fannying around with my failed pastry that I also burned the 
onions. I NEVER burn the onions so was obviously pretty distraught. I blame 
Rachel Ray again, along with the addition of a new hob with a hotter flame than 
I&rsquo;m used to.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My mood was saved by the next batch of pastry which turned out beautiful. 
Smooth and pliable. I guess just how it&rsquo;s supposed to be because it 
tasted lovely.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But then I forgot about my spatula on the frying pan. It melted. Baking 2 : 
Alice 0.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My fragile ego was rescued somewhat by the need to blind bake my pastry 
case. I have never blind baked anything in my whole life before, and it made me 
feel really quite special. Probably because I spent a whole &pound;5 on my new 
ceramic baking beans.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Look at that! I&rsquo;m a baker!</p> 
<p>After my pastry fiasco I didn&rsquo;t trust that damned Rachel Ray and her 
quiche recipe. I knew I wanted tuna and sweetcorn (my Aunt makes the most 
divine tuna and sweetcorn quiche), I threw in some dill I had in the fridge and 
used a mixture of egg and cream to get a richer finish than milk may have had.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Look at that. I baked quiche!</p> 
<p>It tasted surprisingly delicious so I offered it up to Elfie. This made it 
look not so delicious.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>But she ate every last mouthful. And she liked it.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>(This does not prove anything: this girl will eat anything).</p> 
<p>So the final score was Baking 2 : Alice 2 (I gave myself one extra as the 
quiche was so tasty). Recipe below; I guess you could call it a cheat&rsquo;s 
guide to feeling like a baker? &nbsp;It worked for me.</p> 
<p>Tuna and Sweetcorn Quiche</p> 
<p><em>(Thanks to Delia for the great pastry recipe. No thanks to Rachael Ray 
for ruining my day)</em></p> 
<p>Pastry</p> 
<p>8oz plain flour<br>
 4oz fat at room temperature (I used butter)<br>
 1tbsp 
water, plus more as needed</p> 
<p>Filling</p> 
<p>1 small tin tuna<br>
 1 small tin sweetcorn<br>
 handful of dill<br>
 1 
white onion<br>
 4 eggs, beaten<br>
 150ml double cream<br>
 50ml milk<br>
 
salt and pepper</p> 
<p>Set the oven to 180 degrees C</p> 
<p>1. Start by combining all the pastry ingredients in a bowl; mix through 
with a knife, cutting and turning to make it cling together. Use your 
fingertips to judge if you will need to add any extra to the water. The dough 
should be firm and pliable but not sticky. All the flour and fat should be 
incorporated.</p> 
<p>2. The pastry now needs to rest in the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes 
&ndash; something to do with gluten activation. According to Delia this can be 
done up to 3 days in advance but who knows they&rsquo;ll want to make quiche 3 
days in advance? Not me.</p> 
<p>3. Whilst the dough is resting you can make the filling. Start by frying 
off a finely chopped onion (until translucent, rather than black as above), 
which will take 8 to 10 minutes. Crack the eggs into a large bowl, season, then 
add the milk and cream. If you wanted to make the quiche super rich you can 
substitute the milk for more cream.</p> 
<p>4. When the dough has rested for at least 30 minutes remove it from the 
fridge and place on a lightly dusted surface. Roll out to a round shape with a 
rolling pin to a thickness of around 0.5cm. Pick up the pastry carefully, using 
the rolling pin to transport it if necessary, and place in your flan tin (mine 
is 25cm and leaves me some pastry left over). Press the pastry into the tin.</p>
<p>5. Place a layer of baking paper over the pastry, and add ceramic baking 
beans. Bake for 15 minutes.</p> 
<p>6. Remove the pastry from the oven and tip the beans into a bowl. Break up 
the tuna and sprinkle over the bottom of the case, and do the same with the 
onion and sweetcorn. Scatter finely chopped dill over the filling. Pour the egg 
and milk mixture over. Cook for a further 25-30 minutes, or until the top of 
the quiche is golden brown.</p>

<h2>Review: Pollen Street Social</h2> Monday, April 18th, 2011 
<p></p> 
<p><em>(photography courtesy of low light and the iPhone)</em></p> 
<p>Last week I was lucky enough to preview Jason Atherton&rsquo;s new venture, 
Pollen Street Social. Mr A is famously Gordon Ramsay&rsquo;s ex-Executive Chef 
at Maze (LOVE Maze), and Pollen Street Social is his first London-based 
restaurant. He must be smart because he hired my brother (who has a repultation 
for getting me hammered)&nbsp;to be in charge of the bar.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The drinking area is pretty lovely. There&rsquo;s a massive block of ice 
that is awesomely hand carved for the drinks (I&rsquo;m easily pleased) and a 
gin-based menu of unusual cocktails, though they also take requests for all the 
classics. I had something elderflower-based and refreshing in my chilled 
martini glass until it was time to go through to the dining room.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The menu is split into two different sections; small plates and main 
courses. We were told to either order a small plate as a starter followed by a 
main course, or to order around six small plates between two of us. I love the 
modern tapas way of eating so we went with the small plates, and you can blame 
the sommelier for the fact I can&rsquo;t recall how much they cost as she 
perfectly matched wines to each plate.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The highlight of the plates for me was the Pork Belly. I know it&rsquo;s 
slightly yawnsville and there&rsquo;s probably another part of the pig we 
should raving about by now but Pork Belly is my all-time favourite cut of meat. 
This one ranked in the top 3 pork bellies ever (also in top 3 pork bellies; 
maze, me). It came with a fondant something (oops), a bit of cheek, fermented 
apple, burnt onion mayonnaise and the most amazing piece of fluffed, crispy 
crackling. The meat fell apart and I&rsquo;m not ashamed to tell you my mouth 
is watering right now like nobody&rsquo;s business.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The English Breakfast plate was interesting. I&rsquo;d been told that it 
was a must-try, and came as an egg surrounded by chopped tomatoes and gorgeous 
crispy Alsace bacon. The &lsquo;toast&rsquo; was a bread soup poured over. It 
was a bit sloppy, a little weird, but good. A deconstructed breakfast soup.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The fois gras to me didn&rsquo;t taste as gorgeously creamy as others 
I&rsquo;ve tasted from Borough Market which was a let-down. However, I was half 
cut by this point so it could well have been the booze coupled with my 
lacklustre knowledge on fois gras that was a fail here rather than the food.</p>
<p></p> 
<p>The last dish I tried was the cauliflower and squid risotto. Confusing to 
my poor boozed-up squinty eyes, it arrived looking like a plate of risotto. 
Obviously. But there was more cheffy-deconstruction business going on here; the 
squid acted as the risotto paired with squid juice and cauliflower. It was too 
much for me, the texture of it seemed odd for my provincial tastebuds. Ah like 
ma squid DEEP FRIED. Must remember this.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>For pudding we ordered the rhubarb and ginger cheesecake &ndash; gorgeous 
pieces of crystallised ginger made the dish- and the &lsquo;PBJ&rsquo; which 
was an old favourite from ye olde maze days. PBJ represents peanut butter and 
jelly; I recall the dish being different at maze as it was more sandwiched 
together than the separate ingredients on this plate, but it was delicious all 
the same. We ended the evening with some insanely good coffee.</p> 
<p>I drink way too much to ever be a good restaurant critic.</p> 
<p>The night was totally made by our waiter who used to work at Shoreditch 
House and was the one who looked after us at our wedding reception in 2009. I 
may have got a bit in his face by shouting &ldquo;REMEMBER US?!&rdquo; as soon 
as we saw him. And the hug was probably inappropriate.</p> 
<p>Jason Atherton coming over to check on us at the end of the meal was a 
lovely touch. The last time I saw him was on Saturday Kitchen and I get way 
over excited at any sniff of celebrity so I practically forced him into a 
double-cheek kiss. I vowed never to wash my face again (I have) and he seemed 
like a genuinely nice guy.</p> 
<p>So in conclusion, I would and will definitely return. The ambiance and 
social aspect of the place was welcoming and warm, I love the fact that the 
whole menu is available at the bar and you are welcome to drop in for not just 
a meal but drink, coffee (did I mention? INSANE) or a dessert. There&rsquo;s 
such a buzz about this place you&rsquo;d probably end up eating in the toilet 
which would be no hardship as they&rsquo;re A+!</p>

<h2>This Week</h2> Friday, April 15th, 2011 <br>

<ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Whenever I go into London to work I generally arrive at Euston at around 
7.15am; this way I get to squeeze in a full days work and a nice breakfast. I 
would eat atEd&rsquo;s Easy Diner every day if I could (I love their 
&pound;3.85 bacon stack) but I do like to try and mix it up. Next on my to-try 
list is the newSt John Hotel and&nbsp;I have loved reading the reviews of their 
breakfasts this week:Hollow Legs, Wennie&rsquo;s Affairs and Saffron Strands.
</li> 
<li>I went to Roskilde in Denmark the summer before Elfie was born and was 
AMAZED at the general hotness of the Scandinavians. It&rsquo;s basically insane 
&ndash; there are no ugly Scandinavians. Which is why I was so pleased to see 
Adele post her top 3 Swedish Accessories. So now I can be Scandinavian-hot, too!
</li> 
<li>I have made it my summer mission to wear all the accessories I own 
(LOADS); I usually only wear the same necklace which has a charm of 
Elfie&rsquo;s baby fingerprint on it and a letter E. Jennine&rsquo;s &lsquo;
I&rsquo;m a Secret Accessory Junky&lsquo; post totally inspired me.</li> 
<li>James Van Der Memes. Just because.</li> 
<li>I have spent the morning wondering if I can justify spending &pound;92 on 
this beautiful &lsquo;If Only I had a Heart&rsquo; dress (pictured) from 
Brooklyn designerAlexandra Grecco (via WishWishWish)</li> 
<li>I so love Enjoying the Small Things. It makes me want to go and live in 
Florida and spend days on the beach and always reminds me of the importance of 
photographing as many memories as possible.</li> </ul> </ul>

<h4>Hello.</h4> <br>
 My name is Alice Harold. I am a 26 year old mum, ex-good 
time girl and Digital Consultant living just outside of London. I used to live 
in The Big City and work for a style and culture magazine until I got married, 
got pregnant and moved out. I now live a slower life in a small North 
Buckinghamshire village. You can find out more about me and see what I look like
here. <br>
<br>
 More Than Toast is so-called because that's all I ate after my 
baby girl was born. She's now 21 months and we've both almost graduated to real 
grown-up food. That's one of the things I like to blog about here, as well as 
my family, my style, my life, and baby number two who is expected in May. You 
can email me atalice@aliceharold.co.uk. <br>
