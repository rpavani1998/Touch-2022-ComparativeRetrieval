<h1>Turkos-Healthier, Delicious and More Budget Friendly Than Beef Tacos</h1>

<p>Turkey-Turkey Tacos</p> 
<p><br>
<em>Delicious, Healthier Budget Friendly Alternative to Beef Tacos</em>
</p> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p><br>
Created by Paulette Le Pore Motzko</p> 
<p><br>
Copyright January 2012</p> 
<p><br>
1-1/4 pounds ground turkey-I used Jennie-O (Target carries it 
regularly for a mere $3.47!)</p> 
<p><br>
Market Pantry Low Sodium Taco Seasoning</p> 
<p><br>
Taco Shells-Ortega or El Paso make really great ones</p> 
<p><br>
Brown the turkey in a large non-stick skillet. Once nearly browned add 
2/3 cup water and one package of Market Pantry Low Sodium Taco Seasoning. This 
is an outstanding seasoning and I use it on chicken breast or chicken thighs to 
make Chicken Tacos. You can make Taco Salads or Tostada Salads with the 
leftover meat, or if you have a family of 4, this will do just fine.</p> 
<p>Most everybody knows how to make a taco I think, especially those who live 
in southern CA, where we have a mix of all ethnic races and tacos are becoming 
almost more popular than a burger...they are better for you, that's for sure!
</p> 
<p>Mucho better for you!</p> 
<p>You can also make these as they do in Mexico, with wrap the meat mixture in 
a corn tortilla that you can either warm or serve as is-for a soft taco.</p> 
<p>(So I don't get cards and letters on this one: I know in Mexico 
traditionally tacos have shredded seasoned pork butt or carne asada in them. 
You can also fill them with cooked seasoned chicken or fish, if you can find a 
good price on it.)</p> 
<p>To save money: Buy what is in season and it is usually the best price too!
</p> 
<p>Substitute ground turkey for beef where possible and you will be eating 
healthier, saving a few bucks, and if you season the turkey, you won't even 
know-and your family won't know you made made a healthier substitution!</p> 
<p>*****<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
ENJOY!</p> 
<p><br>
Garnish with any of these things:</p> 
<p><br>
Cheddar or Mozzarella or Monterey Jack cheese for tops of Turkos</p> 
<p><br>
Lettuce</p> 
<p><br>
Salsa of your choice-Market Pantry makes an outstanding chunky salsa.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Other great brands, if you don&rsquo;t make your own: Pace, or any of the 
many of Trader Joe&rsquo;s salsas. Last time I was there they had at least 15 
different kinds there.</p>

<h3> How do you keep home made bread fresh? Your Opinions Please! </h3>

<p>I love making home made bread and I can never seem to keep it fresh, unless 
I simply slice the entire loaf and freeze it! I usually make at least two 
loaves and give one away to my parents who live next door to me, and if I feel 
ambitious and want to see a big smile on my friend Myle's I will bake up three 
loaves.How do you keep one loaf fresh as I have heard a variety of answers to 
this proverbial question.I already know that wrapping it in a cotton towel does 
NOT work and when I wrapped it in aluminum foil, it tended to mold even after a 
day here!We put so much TENDER LOVING CARE INTO THE MAKING OF OUR HOME MADE 
BREADS THAT IT IS NICE TO SHARE WHAT KEEPS IT FRESHEST THE LONGEST.Paulette Le

<h3> How do we start feeding grass to cows and the grain to hungry people

<p>I just watched THE CHEW for the first time on ABC7 and it was outstanding! 
I would rate it one of the all time best food shows on TV now.It was Meatless 
Monday and Chef Mario Bitali and Chef Michael Symon were talking about their 
philosophies on integrating more vegetables in their diet.Mario Bitali and 
others resounded the fact that most of our grain goes to feeding cows who 
should really be eating grass, as that is what they were designed to eat. The 
grain then makes them sick by making them gassy.After all, all the photos I 
have ever seen of cows in the rural areas of America's heartland are cows 
grazing on GRASS-what they were made to do, not grazing in a pile of grain-that 
took farmer's time and money to grow. Because of this, when you consider the 
price of the grain we are&hellip;Continue</p>

<p>11/23/2011 8:50 AM-10:11 AMPlan Ahead Then Relax Thanksgiving Dinner for 
Any time of the YEAR:&nbsp;&nbsp;This one is very different from any other kind 
of Thanksgiving Menu you have ever seen? Why? Because with a little preparing, 
counting the hours back 6-8 hours before your guests arrive, assembling the 
ingredients for your side dishes in two crock pots, putting your turkey, some 
vegetables in the turkey cavity in a oven roasting bag in a large, sturdy 
roasting pan&hellip;you are off and hands free-almost, aside from setting the 
table, getting your centerpieces ready, serving utensils, place mats and 
putting together whatever dessert you like.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you thought enough to 
print this Thanksgiving or any day menu and recipes, then by all means tell 
your friends and yourself-your own best friend, about my online cooking 
magazine, Cooking Up A Storm All Over The World!&copy;

<p>I just created (with Paulette's urging) a NEW 
Group&nbsp;&nbsp;called&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&quot;Wheelchair in the Kitchen&quot;.&nbsp;The Title of the Group came from a 
Blog Post that I wrote about my disability: Post Polio Syndrome.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There are a lot of people out there&nbsp;who love to cook but have had 
to&nbsp;learn to do things differently to simplify their lives so that they can 
still do what they love: Cook!&nbsp; Just because you find yourelf Disabled or 
weaker due to aging doesn't mean that you have to resort to Take-Out or frozen 
dinners.&nbsp; I will post tips and tricks along with some recipes that I have 
used for years..and hopefuly many of&nbsp;you will contribute to this 
group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Think: Quick, Simple, ingredients that you can easily find in 
your pantry, but most of all: DELICIOUS!&nbsp; If I don't approve your recipe 
right away, I will write to you and tell you why.&nbsp; Maybe YOU can think of 
a way to make that recipe easier to prepare.....Continue</p> <br>

<h3> What is the strangest thing you have ever cooked: Flub Ups, Burnt Toast

<p>&nbsp;Have you ever made something that you had high hopes for but it just 
didn't come out as you expected?You can share your stories here and also, if 
you learned something about how you would make it better next time, then it 
wasn't a flub up at all, was it!&nbsp;This one should be funny as the answers 
start coming in.&nbsp;For me, I try to avoid the word &quot;strange&quot; when 
people describe the things I cook, but I would say there was a meat loaf I made 
once that never did firm up! I remember my ex-husband eating the thing and 
saying it was &quot;good&quot;, and then I saw a smirk come on his face and I 
just told him not to eat it as it reminded me of eating ALPO-(not that I have 
eaten Alpo or anything!)&nbsp;There was another time that I was trying to make 
something blackened and it turned out more like 
&quot;burned&quot;....&nbsp;Anybody have any funny stories of kitchen disasters 
or less than perfect dishes?&nbsp;Tell em and let's laugh and make a few 
friends too!&nbsp;&hellip;Continue</p>

<p>I am not a wizard or anything, but one thing I do is listen to my readers 
and followers. If you have ideas that you think would be great to integrate 
within the site, let me know!&nbsp;I can't promise miracles, but as Debbie from 
South Texas knows, I listen, I ask and I work with people who are talented. We 
spoke about the POSSIBILITY of a Cake Decorating Group and then the next thing 
it was REALITY. :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;So, put on your thinking caps and then grab an 
apron and think of what you would like to see on here and if you would like to 
do it.&nbsp;This site is becoming more interesting and more 
&quot;flavorful&quot; with each person who contributes something to the 
pot!&nbsp;Polly MotzkoJune 17th, 2011Continue</p>

<p><b>2 Roma tomatoes coarsely chopped</b></p> 
<p><b>One 3 pound chicken roasted with extra virgin olive oil or canola oil 
brushed on the skin with a silicone basting brush. Then sprinkle with Team 
Sweet Mama&rsquo;s BBQ Seasoning from Savory Spice Shop.</b></p> 
<p><b>2 to 3 cups of hominy that has been drained from the can-Teasdale make a 
great one.</b></p> 
<p><b>4 cups water</b></p> 
<p><b>&frac12; teaspoon of Better Than Store Bought Chicken Base</b></p> 
<p><b>This couldn&rsquo;t be easier and it is a great thing to make when you 
are at home doing laundry or doing office work at your desk as I do.</b></p> 
<p><b>Put all ingredients in a large stock pot-VERY LARGE one-or Caldero, that 
you can find in many Latin American markets for hardly a small dent in your 
pocket book.</b></p> 
<p><b><br>
</b></p> 
<p><b></b></p> 
<p><b>A HELPFUL NOTE:</b></p> 
<p><b>Check out Latin American markets in your area or at least a well-stocked 
market like Jon&rsquo;s Marketplace, if you are lucky enough to live by one, or 
another family owned market. I guarantee you will get lower prices, better 
quality and no gimmicks like silly cards that you punch to get a low price! I 
want to tell the big major grocery stores that do that, that those cards cost 
money and with all that you guys spend on them you could have offered low 
prices without the card!</b></p> 
<p><b>Vary this recipe and let it be a &ldquo;Springboard For Your 
Imagination&copy;&rdquo;</b></p> 
<p><b>IN a large pot add one whole cabbage and cover with chicken broth. Add 
your choice of vegetables from onion, peppers, cooked potatoes and then add 
other seasonings to your liking of garlic, cumin, and even a cup of mild salsa 
would be awesome in this!</b></p>

<p><b>Have a delicious day or night&hellip;better yet just have a great DAY!
