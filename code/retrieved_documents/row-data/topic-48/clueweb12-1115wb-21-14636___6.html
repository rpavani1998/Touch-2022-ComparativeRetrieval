<h2>When is Enough&hellip; Enough?</h2> Uncategorized 2 Comments <br>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s one of those great questions to ponder at 4 AM while you 
lie awake waiting for the alarm to go off. Twenty years ago, when we started 
Willow Street, we had some pretty basic criteria when it came to opening a 
restaurant. We wanted to appeal to families. A place that folks could count on 
for a comfortable evening out without breaking the bank. And if you&rsquo;ve 
ever eaten at a Willow Street with your new baby or your grandmother, you know 
that we&rsquo;ve reached our goal. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough. We wanted to 
serve a varied menu. Of course wood fired pizza (it wouldn&rsquo;t be Willow 
Street without our signature dish) but also burgers, fresh salads and specials 
that were, well, special. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough. We didn&rsquo;t want to 
open in malls. At Willow Street, we like being part of a neighborhood and part 
of a community. Which is why we do our best to give back to the cities and 
towns in which we work and many of our employees live. But, that wasn&rsquo;t 
enough. We never wanted to be corporate. We like the feeling of being, 
&ldquo;that great little place around the corner.&rdquo; But, and you guessed 
it, even that wasn&rsquo;t enough. So we committed to providing our guests with 
as good a meal and as good an experience as they could have anywhere. Anywhere.

<h2>Home Is Where the Heart Is</h2> Uncategorized Comments Off <br>

<p>My name is Anthony Gomez, but you may refer to me as&hellip;.The Food Czar! 
I am a bartender, server, and all around food enthusiast currently working for 
Willow Street Pizza and Campo di Bocce of Los Gatos. Salute! I was educated at 
the Professional Culinary Institute and finished with a degree in culinary 
arts, and over the past three years, I have contributed desserts, appetizer 
plates, sauces, and cocktails to Willow Street. I absolutely love talking about 
great food, so listen to my wisdom, LOVE me, and return to your lives.</p> 
<p>A few weeks ago, I went out to a late dinner with some friends to a sports 
bar that opened recently. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much, and frankly, I knew it 
was going to be bad. However, &ldquo;TV dinner&rdquo; does not even begin to 
describe the meal I ended up with. I could actually taste the plastic that my 
dish had been wrapped in!</p> 
<p>Which brings me to my point; the saying goes &ldquo;home is where the heart 
is&rdquo;, and to produce truly amazing food, you must to cook with heart. 
There is a reason grandma&rsquo;s food is the best. There is a reason that you 
pay the money you do at fine-dining restaurants. These people cook with LOVE! 
They don&rsquo;t settle for cans, boxed potatoes, instant rice, or plastic 
wrapped insta-meals. They have unbreakable standards and take pride in their 
products.</p> 
<p>I have the absolute pleasure of working for a company in Willow Street 
Pizza that takes as much pride in homemade goodness as I do. Stocks, soups, 
sauces, OH MY! Desserts, dressings, and cheeses, YES! All homemade and all 
prepared in-house. From the dough we use for our bread and pizzas, to our fresh 
mozzarella cheese, we do it all because we know that grandma&rsquo;s way is 
best, so we do it the way she did.</p> 
<p>Until next time, eat, live, and love well.</p>

<h2>New Year&rsquo;s Promises</h2> Uncategorized Comments Off <br>

<p>&hellip;at the risk of sounding a bit like the late Andy Rooney, you ever 
wonder why people make New Year&rsquo;s resolutions? For most of us, they 
barely last until mid January let alone March. I mean, why bother? It&rsquo;s 
just one more thing to beat youself up about. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have 
a little help this year? Fat chance huh? Actually, Willow Street is really good 
at helping keep resolutions. For instance, let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;ve 
resolved to eat healthier. Go to Willow Street and order a gluten free pizza or 
pasta or any number of other great tasting healthy entries. See that? 
It&rsquo;s not that tough. Oh, so your resolution is to take the kids out once 
a week for a fun, tasty, affordable meal? Go to Willow Street on Tuesdays. Kids 
eat free, parents eat well and our kids menu doesn&rsquo;t begin and end with 
the words, &ldquo;hot dog and fries.&rdquo; So that does it, problem solved, 
resolution kept. What? You&rsquo;ve promise yourself that in 2012 date nights 
will not only be weekly but enjoyable? Go to Willow Street. Have cocktail, 
share a bruschetta, order one of your old favorites or try one of our ever 
changing specials.&nbsp;Then, have a couple of rich, decadent 
desserts&hellip;hey, there are some resolutions that you&rsquo;re on your own. 
On behalf of us at Willow Street, we wish you a Happy and prosperous New Year.

<h2>It Was A Very Good Year</h2> Uncategorized Comments Off <br>

<p>December already! Who would have thought? Although that does explain all 
those colored lights and fat men in red. As we prepare to say goodbye to 2011 
we wanted to take a moment to reflect on where we&rsquo;ve been and where 
we&rsquo;re going.<br>
 For us at Willow Street, looking back requires a long 
look. In Willow Glen, we are beginning our third decade of serving the 
community. The town has certainly changed since we opened twenty years ago. And 
nowhere is that more evident than at Willow Street. We have a new look, a new 
feel, and a new garage! That&rsquo;s right, good things come to those who wait. 
At Westgate, we&rsquo;ve become the place to catch a game in a comfortable room 
with terrific food. You know, it&rsquo;s a fact that the better you eat, the 
better The Niners play&hellip;so far so good. In Los Gatos, we&rsquo;re 
continuing to help bring the downtown to life. From sunny days on the patio to 
warm nights filled with jazz, Willow Street remains the talk of the town.<br>
 
Speaking of new things in town&hellip;Main Street Burgers has added a new 
dining room and has been voted &ldquo;Best Burger&rdquo; (again) by The Los 
Gatos Weekly. So as we say, &ldquo;It was a very good year.&rdquo; Yet none of 
it would have happened without you. Your friendship and loyalty is appreciated 
more than you can ever imagine. While our attention to quality and dedication 
to service makes us good restaurants, our supporting of and giving back to 
communities in which we work makes us good neighbors. And that&rsquo;s what 
it&rsquo;s all about. On behalf our all of us at Willow Street and Main Street, 
we wish you a prosperous and Happy New Year.</p> 23 Nov 2011 <br>

<h2>Thanksgiving Blessings</h2> Uncategorized Comments Off <br>

<p>On the surface, the idea of posting a blog with a one-day shelf life seems 
a little silly. However, the whole concept of Thanksgiving deserves a bit more 
thought than, &ldquo;When&rsquo;s the turkey going to be ready?&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s playing in the late game?&rdquo; It is a day to count 
one&rsquo;s blessings. For us here at Willow Street, to count our blessings, we 
need look no further than to you kind folks who have been there for a 
generation. Now don&rsquo;t get us wrong, we&rsquo;ve certainly had our share 
of ups and downs, of broken water pipes and long hours. Yet, thanks to your 
loyalty and friendship, it has been worth the effort. And having just completed 
our annual Sacred Heart Turkey Drive (thanks to you, a terrific success), we 
are reminded of just how lucky we are. So tomorrow, between the gravy and the 
first downs, take a moment to reflect on the good life&hellip;then loosen your 
belt and take a nap. From all of us at Willow Street, Happy Thanksgiving.</p> 14

<h2>Just Pizza? Think Again</h2> Uncategorized 1 Comment <br>

<p>&hellip;there&rsquo;s a phrase in the music business, &ldquo;one trick 
pony,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a little like, &ldquo;one and done&rdquo; or &ldquo;one 
hit wonder.&rdquo; It means that you&rsquo;re basically known for just one 
thing. Like Midas and mufflers, The Yankees and baseball or Willow Street and 
pizza. Well actually, if the truth be known, pizza may have started us on our 
journey but it&rsquo;s what else we do that has kept us at the front of the 
pack for a generation. So, listen up cause I&rsquo;m gonna &lsquo;splain it to 
you&hellip;Willow Street does more than pizza. Go ahead, say it with me. Willow 
Street does more than pizza. A lot more.<br>
 From pasta dishes, to salads, 
sandwiches, appetizers, succulent burgers, desserts, wine, local beers on tap, 
and creative cocktails, our menu stretches across a wide variety of American 
cuisine offerings. We slow roast our rotisserie chicken daily. We purchase our 
ingredients from local vendors 9 months out of the year. We have a specials 
menu that changes monthly and includes dishes like our Butternut Squash Ravioli 
and the ever-popular Summer Steak and Peach Salad. And would you like to know 
what we home-make? Literally, almost everything&hellip;our pasta sauces, salad 
dressings, soups (including stocks), fresh mozzarella cheese, pizza dough, 
honey wheat bread, and desserts. All made fresh for you. Yes, it&rsquo;s labor 
intensive, and yes, our chefs arrive at our restaurants at ungodly hours to 
prepare the day&rsquo;s ingredients; but we do it all for you. And because 
Willow Street will settle for nothing less than providing the best possible 
meal without emptying your wallet. We even offer an extensive gluten-free menu 
ranging from pizzas to pastas, beer, and molten chocolate cake. Yes, we said 
it, gluten-free molten chocolate cake. Oh, and did we mention we offer wine by 
the glass and a half? It&rsquo;s just like the glass you pour yourself at home. 
Can you think of one other restaurant that offers a glass and a half of 
wine?&hellip;don&rsquo;t worry, neither can we.<br>
 There you have 
it&hellip;Willow Street, while it may say pizza on the door, it says flavor in 
the kitchen. What will the next 20 years bring? No one knows for sure. What we 
do know is that when it comes to creative, tasty, cutting edge dishes, folks in 
the know will still be coming to Willow Street.</p> 01 Nov 2011 <br>

<h2>Social Media: News or Nuisance?</h2> Uncategorized 1 Comment <br>

<p>&hellip;so here&rsquo;s the deal. As business people, we love social media. 
What&rsquo;s not to love? Talk about direct marketing! Thanks to the folks at 
Facebook and Twitter, we can actually keep in touch with our customers 24/7. Of 
course, as private citizens, we&rsquo;re frankly not sure if 24/7 isn&rsquo;t a 
little over the top. At Willow Street, we know that there is a fine line 
between being informative and intrusive; a line that we do our best never to 
cross. The fact is, just because you were kind enough to either 
&ldquo;like&rdquo; us, join our E-Club or chose to follow us via your smart 
phone, doesn&rsquo;t give us carte blanche to interrupt your day whenever the 
spirit moves us. So, here&rsquo;s our pledge to you: If it&rsquo;s not about 
saving you money, filling you in on community events or sharing something that 
is truly compelling&hellip;we&rsquo;ll keep it to ourselves. Unless of course, 
we happen to produce a very clever video that is guaranteed to bring a smile to 
your face&hellip;but who couldn&rsquo;t use a smile now and then?</p> 18 Oct

<h2>Parody at Last: Willow Street Restaurant (Saratoga Ave.)</h2> Uncategorized
Comments Off <br>

<p>For years, the NFL and sports bars have grown increasingly further apart. 
The better the game was, the worst the food got. Fans were trapped in a 
flavorless nether world of deep fried pickles, popcorn, cold hot dogs (now 
there&rsquo;s an oxymoron) and stale peanuts. Then, one day, it all changed. 
Finally, you could enjoy the game and the meal. At Willow Street Westgate, when 
we added 5 high definition TVs and The NFL Ticket, we not only kept our same 
terrific menu and full bar, we added dishes that go perfectly with football. 
Like a Barbeque Burger or a Meatball Sandwich. Or Coconut Prawns with homemade 
pineapple chili dipping sauce&hellip;and that&rsquo;s just a few things off our 
Sports Menu. You can also celebrate a touchdown (or curse a defense) with an 
order of Fresh Manilla Clams, some Rigatoni with Italian Sausage or one of our 
signature wood-fired pizzas. Bottom line, Willow Street Westgate is a good deal 
more than just chicken wings and beer. Although, our Willow Wings have taken a 
common dish to another level. From Micro brews on tap to Margheritas and all 
the yard lines in between, this is what a sports bar was meant to be. Willow 
Street Westgate&hellip;all things being equal, we&rsquo;re not.</p>
