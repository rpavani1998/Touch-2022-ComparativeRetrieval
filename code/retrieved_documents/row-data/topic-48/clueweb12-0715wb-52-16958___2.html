A warm bowl of Pasta Pizza Soup hits the spot on a cold day. 
It&rsquo;s a great meal when you&rsquo;re trying to lose a few pounds.<br>
<br>

 The soup is low in sodium and high in flavor. If you&rsquo;re concerned about 
sodium, skip the Parmesan cheese and you&rsquo;ll have only 120 milligrams in a 
serving.<br>

&nbsp;Enjoy,<br>
