<h2> Buzy Mom's Ideas for Dinner </h2>  Posted by Home Run Inn <br>

<p>As a busy mom, our work is never done and there&rsquo;s never enough time 
in the day for all that needs to be done - one of those things being getting 
dinner on the table for the family. Here are a couple ideas from Home Run Inn - 
makers of your favorite Chicago pizza - on how to make this chore a little 
easier on mom and that will be a hit with the whole family as well.</p> 
<p>Plan a food exchange with a friend or two. Once a month or once a week, 
make a dinner that can be easily divided into several meals and swap. Freeze 
the meals to keep, then heat up to serve. You&rsquo;ll have dinners for several 
nights for the work of just one.</p> 
<p>Need something fast and easy, right now? Pop in a Home Run Inn All Natural 
frozen pizza. Dinner is served, and the kids are happy. Start with a salad or 
serve with carrot sticks to make even healthier.</p> 
<p>Plan ahead for the week so you can use ingredients for several meals. For 
example, a store-bought rotisserie chicken can be shredded and used for 
enchiladas, soup, and salad. Slow-cooked pork tenderloin quickly turns into 
barbecued pork sandwiches, or you can use these as additional toppings for your 
frozen pizza's given them your unique flare.</p> 
<p>Order a Chicago pizza or a couple pasta dishes from our website before you 
leave work, and pick up on the way home.</p> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re all done, recruit the family to commit 10 minutes or more 
to helping clean up. This could be dinner clean up, picking up toys, or some 
other cleaning chore. Whether it's after a home-cooked meal or a frozen pizza, 
busy moms need all the help we can get.</p> <br>
