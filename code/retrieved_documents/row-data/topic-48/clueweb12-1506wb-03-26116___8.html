<h2>When April Shouldn&rsquo;t Be Fooled.</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Posted by:<br>
Tate Linden</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m all for humor in the workplace, and even shared publicly on 
behalf of organizations likeGoogle, YouTube (which is basically <em>also</em> 
Google,)Starbucks (the unofficial fuel of Googlers), Toshiba (also, somehow 
related to Google, if we cared to keep up this farce,) and other upstanding 
brands.</p> 
<p>People send around the best of the best and just about everyone loves it.
</p> 
<p>But what makes an organizational April Fools prank great for the 
organization is completely different than what makes it great as a prank. We 
like the prank aspect because it makes us laugh or it catches us off guard. Or 
maybe because it made someone other than ourselves look like an idiot.</p> 
<p>Organizations both serious and playful can find successful ways to use 
April Fools to show what is important to them. Starbucks&rsquo; creating the 
drive-by coffee service shows that they understand what we want from them in an 
ideal world. It actually moves the brand forward. Toshiba having a 3-d monocle 
embraces the absurd levels to which technophiles will go (even when what they 
want is something that is[?] an impossibility.)</p> 
<p>Much like great advertising, great organizational pranks should reinforce 
what is central to the brand. For Starbucks? Service is spot on. For Toshiba 
it&rsquo;s unbelievably advanced technology. But what about something like our 
armed services?&nbsp;How does one play a prank that advances the brand of the 
&ldquo;&hellip;group of rough men [and women] who stand ready to visit violence 
on those who would harm us.&rdquo; ? (And yes, I do know that Winston 
wasn&rsquo;t talking about<em>ours</em>, but still.)</p> 
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s possible&hellip; But why would they try to do it?</p> 
<p>Seems like the reason is to show that the brand is in touch with 
today&rsquo;s potential recruits. If the military can showit&rsquo;s cool 
enough to make fun of itself then maybe it can appeal to more of the young men 
and women who could potentially enlist. It&rsquo;s PR that enhances recruiting. 
It gets the Army&rsquo;s brand mentioned and distributed by and for the very 
people that the recruiters want to reach! Cool!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So why would anyone think that this is anything but brilliance? We&rsquo;ve 
got thousands of recruiting candidates that were reminded of the Army when 
otherwise they&rsquo;d just be thinking about pranks and playing Angry Birds on 
their smart phones!</p> 
<p>Because it&rsquo;s wrong.</p> 
<p>And not just because we expect our rough men (and women) to be serious and 
proud. I&rsquo;m pretty sure we all acknowledge that the people who protect us 
need to blow off steam on occasion. (Though I can imagine a few congressmen 
hypothetically railing against this &ldquo;despicable waste of taxpayer 
money&rdquo; as an example of what&rsquo;s wrong with our government and armed 
forces today.)</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong is that the Army has, in an effort to attract recruits, 
diminished its own brand.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;The Army&rsquo;s mission is to fight and win our Nation&rsquo;s wars 
by providing prompt, sustained land dominance across the full range of military 
operations and spectrum of conflict in support of combatant commanders.&rdquo;
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I see nothing about fashionable headwear. I see nothing about pranks. I see 
nothing about PR efforts.</p> 
<p>I do see a critically important aspect of our national defense.</p> 
<p>The problem with PR that goes for the quick sale (or in this case &ndash; 
quick recruiting bump) is that it usually sacrifices the long-term equity of 
the brand to make that happen. (SeeGroupon and Burger King for examples of 
Crispin+Porter doing just that.) In this case the Army has invested time and 
money to show that they&rsquo;re funny and perhaps that they&rsquo;re 
fashionable enough to know that their current headwear isn&rsquo;t particularly 
cool. With a mission statement that is built around concepts like 
&ldquo;fight,&rdquo; &ldquo;dominance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; this 
prank actually works against the brand.</p> 
<p>Think our men and women in uniform are now going to fight more fiercely, or 
that our enemies will be more easily dominated? Think our citizens will now 
respect the Army more now that they&rsquo;veendorsed an actual company and 
given them preferential placement over competitors likeWrangler, American West, 
andAtwood?</p> 
<p>Yeah. I know. It&rsquo;s a joke. And everyone has a right to be playful 
once in a while. Or lots in a while. Whatever.</p> 
<p>Defending our nation is not funny.</p> 
<p><em>Other</em> people are perfectly welcome to make fun of the Army brand. 
It&rsquo;s part of who we are as a Nation. It is<em>not</em>, however a part of 
who the Army is to make fun of their own mission directly or indirectly.</p> 
<p>That said&hellip; at least they didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Mission 
Accomplished.&rdquo;</p> <br>

<h2>Google Autopilot</h2> 
<p>Imagine a world where you no longer need to sift through piles of email and 
strategically answer only the ones that matter.&nbsp; According to 
Google&rsquo;s Gmail that day is finally here.&nbsp; Google Autopilot handles 
all the dirty work for you.</p> 
<p>Just log in to your Gmail account and look in the upper right hand corner 
where you will see something like this:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Click on &ldquo;New! Gmail Autopilot&rdquo; and check out the great new 
features!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>(If the image above is too small you can click on it to see the full-size 
screen.)</p> 
<p>Google Autopilot can respond to business proposals, manage your personal 
relationships and match your tone in emails &ndash; all through intelligent use 
of simple slider mechanisms that effectively turn your personality into a bunch 
of computer variables.&nbsp; Note that Google warns that two accounts with the 
service may very well have conversations with each other that could 
&ldquo;commit you to dinner parties or baby namings in which you have no 
interest.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>You have been warned.</p> 
<p>Now, if only I could find an autopilot for this blog.&nbsp; And, heck, why 
not for branding in general.&nbsp; Click a button, move some sliders&hellip; 
get your new logo and brand positioning.</p> 
<p>Rock on!</p> 
<p>Have a cautiously optimistic 4/1 everyone!</p> <br>

<h2>Evidently they were not kidding&hellip;</h2> 
<p>Back in April there was a news blurb about Pizza Hut changing their name to 
Pasta Hut.&nbsp; Everyone thought it was anApril Fools prank.</p> 
<p>Then&hellip; two days ago we see this:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<h1>Pizza Hut renamed Pasta Hut to promote healthy eating</h1> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>London, October 7 (ANI): Worlds largest selling pizza restaurant<br>
 
chain, Pizza Hut, has been renamed Pasta Hut as part of a<br>
 100million-pound 
overhaul to promote healthy eating.</p> 
<p>The international franchise, which has made its commerce in the UK<br>
 
since 1973, has revealed that it is introducing healthier food for big<br>
 
nutritional changes.</p> 
<p>While a new pasta Carte du jour will be offered, the childrens menu<br>
 
shall embrace hidden vegetables, along with a complimentary side salad.</p> 
<p>The health conscious company has removed hydrogenated vegetable oils<br>
 
from its menu, and a saturated fat removal programme is underway.</p> 
<p>I am confident that people will like what they see when they come<br>
 into 
our restaurants, the Sun quoted Pasta Hut head Alasdair Murdoch as<br>
 saying.
</p> 
<p>The new Pasta Hut outlets will be unwrapped in 2009 and 2010, with<br>
 
interiors of 700 current UK restaurant being given a face-lift. (ANI)</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is still a PR stunt &ndash; especially given the 
fact thatpastahut.com is listed as an online auction portal belonging to one 
Kevin Smith.&nbsp; And if it isn&rsquo;t a PR stunt, well&hellip; Kevin is 
about to become a very rich man.</p> 
<p>(Note to big companies going through a rebranding:&nbsp; DO NOT ANNOUNCE 
YOUR NAME UNTIL YOU SECURE THE WEBSITE.&nbsp; Even if you might be able to go to
ICANN and protest &ndash; why not just do it right in the first place?)</p> <br>
