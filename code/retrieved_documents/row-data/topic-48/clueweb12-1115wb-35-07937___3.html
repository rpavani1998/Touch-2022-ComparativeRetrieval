<h2>When is Enough&hellip; Enough?</h2> Uncategorized 2 Comments <br>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s one of those great questions to ponder at 4 AM while you 
lie awake waiting for the alarm to go off. Twenty years ago, when we started 
Willow Street, we had some pretty basic criteria when it came to opening a 
restaurant. We wanted to appeal to families. A place that folks could count on 
for a comfortable evening out without breaking the bank. And if you&rsquo;ve 
ever eaten at a Willow Street with your new baby or your grandmother, you know 
that we&rsquo;ve reached our goal. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough. We wanted to 
serve a varied menu. Of course wood fired pizza (it wouldn&rsquo;t be Willow 
Street without our signature dish) but also burgers, fresh salads and specials 
that were, well, special. But that wasn&rsquo;t enough. We didn&rsquo;t want to 
open in malls. At Willow Street, we like being part of a neighborhood and part 
of a community. Which is why we do our best to give back to the cities and 
towns in which we work and many of our employees live. But, that wasn&rsquo;t 
enough. We never wanted to be corporate. We like the feeling of being, 
&ldquo;that great little place around the corner.&rdquo; But, and you guessed 
it, even that wasn&rsquo;t enough. So we committed to providing our guests with 
as good a meal and as good an experience as they could have anywhere. Anywhere.

<h2>New Year&rsquo;s Promises</h2> Uncategorized Comments Off <br>

<p>&hellip;at the risk of sounding a bit like the late Andy Rooney, you ever 
wonder why people make New Year&rsquo;s resolutions? For most of us, they 
barely last until mid January let alone March. I mean, why bother? It&rsquo;s 
just one more thing to beat youself up about. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have 
a little help this year? Fat chance huh? Actually, Willow Street is really good 
at helping keep resolutions. For instance, let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;ve 
resolved to eat healthier. Go to Willow Street and order a gluten free pizza or 
pasta or any number of other great tasting healthy entries. See that? 
It&rsquo;s not that tough. Oh, so your resolution is to take the kids out once 
a week for a fun, tasty, affordable meal? Go to Willow Street on Tuesdays. Kids 
eat free, parents eat well and our kids menu doesn&rsquo;t begin and end with 
the words, &ldquo;hot dog and fries.&rdquo; So that does it, problem solved, 
resolution kept. What? You&rsquo;ve promise yourself that in 2012 date nights 
will not only be weekly but enjoyable? Go to Willow Street. Have cocktail, 
share a bruschetta, order one of your old favorites or try one of our ever 
changing specials.&nbsp;Then, have a couple of rich, decadent 
desserts&hellip;hey, there are some resolutions that you&rsquo;re on your own. 
On behalf of us at Willow Street, we wish you a Happy and prosperous New Year.

<h2>It Was A Very Good Year</h2> Uncategorized Comments Off <br>

<p>December already! Who would have thought? Although that does explain all 
those colored lights and fat men in red. As we prepare to say goodbye to 2011 
we wanted to take a moment to reflect on where we&rsquo;ve been and where 
we&rsquo;re going.<br>
 For us at Willow Street, looking back requires a long 
look. In Willow Glen, we are beginning our third decade of serving the 
community. The town has certainly changed since we opened twenty years ago. And 
nowhere is that more evident than at Willow Street. We have a new look, a new 
feel, and a new garage! That&rsquo;s right, good things come to those who wait. 
At Westgate, we&rsquo;ve become the place to catch a game in a comfortable room 
with terrific food. You know, it&rsquo;s a fact that the better you eat, the 
better The Niners play&hellip;so far so good. In Los Gatos, we&rsquo;re 
continuing to help bring the downtown to life. From sunny days on the patio to 
warm nights filled with jazz, Willow Street remains the talk of the town.<br>
 
Speaking of new things in town&hellip;Main Street Burgers has added a new 
dining room and has been voted &ldquo;Best Burger&rdquo; (again) by The Los 
Gatos Weekly. So as we say, &ldquo;It was a very good year.&rdquo; Yet none of 
it would have happened without you. Your friendship and loyalty is appreciated 
more than you can ever imagine. While our attention to quality and dedication 
to service makes us good restaurants, our supporting of and giving back to 
communities in which we work makes us good neighbors. And that&rsquo;s what 
it&rsquo;s all about. On behalf our all of us at Willow Street and Main Street, 
we wish you a prosperous and Happy New Year.</p>
