<p>Take-out-food ~ Weight Loss <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Try these take-out-food tips while staying on your health track.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>The occasional treat doesn't do any harm</i></b><i>.</i> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>With a little bit of food menu savvy to avoid danger dishes, you can still 
indulge in your favorite takeout treats.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You don't have to avoid this food altogether when losing weight. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Be choosy and ask questions about the food you order. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What is the food cooked in? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Is it fried or deep fried?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Indian</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Think again before you order &quot;extras&quot; because poppadoms, samosas 
and bhajis are loaded with saturated fat.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Try dishes baked in the Tandoor oven, like chicken tikka, tandoori or 
shashlik that come without a sauce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Avoid creamy sauces like chicken tikka masala, which contains a huge 47g of 
fat, and rich passandas and kormas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's not the meat, it's the sauces that are the problem. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Go for something tomato-based or with vegetables, like a rogan josh, and 
eat it with brown rice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Indian breads are another fat trap. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Naan bread is full of refined sugar, and fruity peshwari naan is even worse 
with added coconut.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have to have a naan, have just a small piece or order it instead of 
rice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Danger words</b>: korma, chicken tikka masala, poppadoms</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Chinese ~ take-out-food</b>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Plain rice or noodles are healthier accompaniments to Chinese food. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Dishes with vegetables, chicken and noodles are not as stodgy and are 
easier to digest.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Go for a fine noodle, like Singapore noodles.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A fresh stir-fry of meat and fresh vegetables is better. </p> 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>These don't use sticky creamy sauces and maybe only a couple of tablespoons 
of oil.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At the Chinese take-out restaurants, the danger lies in the deep fried 
foods, so you want to avoid prawn crackers and anything cooked in batter, like 
pork or prawn balls.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Danger words</b>: special fried, batter</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Thai ~ take-out-food</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the most healthy takeout choice of all and is a better choice for 
the dieter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thai meals are generally made up of steamed rice, fish and vegetables, and 
dishes are individually cooked so are fresher than a vat of mass-cooked sauce.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thai dishes can still be laden with fat though. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A Thai green curry with sticky rice contains 29g of fat. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Avoid these and other curries that are coconut cream-based. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Coconut is often very sweet to enhance the flavor of the dish and may have 
added sugar, so avoid this on a strict regime.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As with Chinese food, stir-fried is a healthier choice. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Danger words</b>: coconut cream, Thai green curry, sticky rice</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Italian ~ take-out-food</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pasta is a healthy form of carbohydrates and is better served with a tomato 
or vegetable sauce, instead of a creamy or cheesy choice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For example, an arrabiata is a better choice than a carbonara or lasagna. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pasta filled with vegetables is a healthier option like cannelloni with 
spinach and ricotta, rather than heavy ravioli.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At an Italian restaurant, meat dishes are often on the menu and can be a 
healthy meal with salad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For starters order a healthy side salad instead of a garlic bread starter 
that oozes butter.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And if you have to have a pizza, go for a thin crust with a basic topping, 
like a margarita.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Danger words</b>: garlic bread, carbonara, lasagna, pizza</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Burgers ~ take-out-food</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you do fall for the &quot;burger trap&quot; you can ease the blow to 
your weight loss regimen by cutting out the bun and the sauce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Order your burger without a bun and top with salad, a squeeze of lemon 
juice or a low fat sauce.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many popular burger outlets also offer lower fat versions with no sauce and 
less fat, so look out for those options.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Danger words</b>: fries, burger buns, mayonnaise, creamy toppings.</p>
