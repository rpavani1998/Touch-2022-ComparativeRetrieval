<h2>Healthy Restaurant Eating</h2> <br>

<p>Americans eat more than 20 percent of meals outside of their homes and 
spend more than 40 percent of their food budgets in restaurants. Long work days 
and fast-paced lifestyles have driven many families toward the convenience of 
restaurant dining rooms, drive-through windows, home delivery, and carry-out 
meals.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, large portions, high-calorie food preparation techniques, 
and add-ons such as rolls and desserts have made restaurant meals a 
contributing factor to overweight and obesity. However, with some planning and 
thought, it is possible to eat a healthy meal away from home.</p> 
<h4>General Tips</h4> 
<p>The type of restaurant you choose can help determine how healthy your food 
will be. If you are health conscious, visit restaurants that offer selections 
that fit with your dietary needs. Restaurants that offer a variety of foods 
prepared with a variety of cooking methods such as baking, steaming, and 
grilling in additional to deep frying.</p> 
<p>Ask your server about substitutions, such as a salad instead of French 
fries or fruit instead of chips. Restaurants that offer buffets or &#147;all 
you can eat&#148; deals can often be a place to overeat.</p> 
<p>No matter what you chose for dining, delivery, or take out, you can always 
control your own calorie and fat intake. To control your hunger and prevent 
overeating at mealtime, try eating a small snack such as an apple before your 
meal.</p> 
<h4>Appetizers, Salads, and Beverages</h4> 
<p>If you order an appetizer, consider a broth or tomato-based soup, which may 
be relatively low in calories and may give you a feeling of fullness. If you 
are with other people, suggest sharing appetizers.</p> 
<p>If bread is served as an appetizer, skip the butter or spread and eat only 
one piece. Better bread choices include whole-wheat rolls, French bread, or 
unbuttered bread sticks.</p> 
<p>Salad can be one of the healthiest selections on the menu but may be a poor 
choice if it is laden with high-fat toppings. Skip the cheese, olives, and 
bacon bits and go for lots of fresh vegetables like green peppers, broccoli, 
carrots, and tomatoes. Make your salad is a rainbow of colorful veggies and 
request that low-fat or fat-free dressing be served on the side.</p> 
<p>Beverages can add unnoticed calories to your meal. Lower calorie choices 
include water, unsweetened tea or tea with a low-cal sweetener, coffee (minus 
cream and sugar), and diet soda. Sweet tea, juice, regular sodas, milkshakes, 
and fruit drinks often have high calorie content. Alcohol is high in calories; 
so if you drink, do so sparingly.</p> 
<h4>Main Courses</h4> 
<p>When ordering an entree, consider how the food is prepared. If the food is 
described as fried, sauteed, breaded, battered, tempura, creamed, scalloped, 
crispy, au gratin, or basted, avoid it. These words indicate the dish is 
high-calorie, either because it has absorbed butter or oil through frying or 
because of the addition of ingredients like cream, butter, or cheese.</p> 
<p>Look for healthier alternatives that have been poached, steamed, roasted, 
broiled, stir-fried, or grilled. If ordering meat, ask for a lean cut and trim 
away any visible fat.</p> 
<h4>Desserts</h4> 
<p>Some restaurants offer low-sugar and reduced-calorie desserts for people on 
special diets. If you really want to eat a dessert, plan ahead and reduce what 
you eat for the rest of the day to accommodate the extra calories.</p> 
<p>Another idea is to look for fruit salad in the menu&#146;s salad section. 
Fruit is a healthier alternative to traditional desserts and still gives a 
sweet taste.</p> 
<h4>Ethnic Foods</h4> 
<p>In Mexican restaurants, avoid foods that are fried, like chimichangas and 
nacho chips. Black beans and pinto beans are lower-fat than refried beans. 
Chicken, seafood and beans are generally better choices than beef or pork. Many 
Mexican dishes are covered in high-calorie cheese, guacamole, and sour cream; 
so request salsa as a topping instead.</p> 
<p>When eating pizza, reduce calories by choosing a thin crust and replacing 
bacon, sausage, and pepperoni with leaner meats, such as chicken and ham. Add 
vegetables like peppers, tomatoes, and mushrooms and ask if low-fat cheese or 
cheese-less pizza is an option.</p> 
<p>You can eat lighter in an Italian restaurant by avoiding cream sauces, 
pestos, and meat sauces; opt for tomato-based sauces such a marinara instead. 
Ask about whole wheat pastas, which are healthier than traditional pasta. In 
dishes like eggplant parmesan, ask if the eggplant can be baked, not fried.</p> 
<p>In Asian restaurants, look for foods that are steamed rather than fried. 
For example, steamed rice would be a healthier choice than fried rice. If your 
table has only regular soy sauce, request a lighter version. Look for dishes 
where the vegetables are stir-fried, grilled or steamed and avoid the tempura 
vegetables.</p> 
<p>Delis typically offer a wide variety of sandwich fillings. Lean meats like 
ham, turkey, or chicken are healthier options than bologna, salami, or 
pepperoni. Choose whole grain breads if they are available, and substitute 
mustard for mayonnaise or oil on your sandwiches.</p> 
<p>Eating out is an enjoyable experience and by making good choices, a dinner 
on the town can be a healthy dining experience.</p>
