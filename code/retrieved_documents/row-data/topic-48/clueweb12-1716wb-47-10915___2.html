<h2>Is the &ldquo;Asian Diet&rdquo; Inherently Healthier? </h2>  By Jennifer 
Kung &sdot; 11 Jan 2010 &sdot; Post a comment Tweet <br>

<p>by Hazel Hyon for MochiMag.com</p> 
<p>When I go to Asia, it&rsquo;s hard not to notice that most people there are 
incredibly skinny, especially in comparison to the average American. The 
difference in body types is apparent when I shop in Asia, and I find myself 
having to buy clothing in a size large, instead of my usual small or medium 
sizes. Then there are the remarks I hear from relatives about how 
&ldquo;healthy&rdquo; I look, which is their polite way of saying I must be 
eating a little too well.</p> 
<p>Much of what accounts for why Asians are generally more slender and 
healthier than Americans &mdash; who are currently dealing with widespread 
obesity &mdash; lies in the differences in diet. By comparing the eating habits 
in the U.S and East Asia (mainly China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan), we can 
understand why and how the typical Asian diet can translate into a healthier 
lifestyle.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s first look at the general types of foods consumed on a regular 
day in the U.S. and East Asia:</p> 
<p></p> <strong>Foods Typically Consumed in Asia</strong> <strong>Foods 
Typically Consumed in America</strong> <br>
<strong>Breakfast</strong> Rice 
porridge/sticky rice/white rice with pickled vegetables/seaweed, 
bread/specialty breads in Asian bakeries, meat/vegetable buns, soymilk Cereal 
with milk, eggs, ham, cheese, bagel with butter/cream cheese, toast, pancakes, 
waffles, sausage, croissants, donuts, coffee <br>
<strong>Lunch</strong> White 
rice with a small portion of vegetables/meat/pickles, a variation of noodles 
(soup or stir fried), wrapped rice in seaweed/sushi Sandwiches with turkey, 
ham, roast beef, tomatoes, salads with chicken/cheese/dressing, pizza <br>

<strong>Dinner</strong> Bowl of white rice, fish, tofu, soup, pork/beef/chicken 
Pasta, salad, pot roast, chicken, peas/corn/broccoli/celery, steak, sandwiches, 
bread, potatoes <br>
<strong>Dessert/snacks</strong> Fruit, dried fruit, nuts, 
rice crackers, salty crackers Chips, cake, pie, ice cream <br>
<strong>Drinks
</strong> Tea (green, oolong, black), soymilk Coffee, soda, juices <br>
<br>

<p>From the table above, we see that the main ingredient in the Asian diet is 
the beloved white rice. According to Oldways, rice provides 25 to 80 percent of 
the calories in the daily diet of 2.7 billion Asians. It&rsquo;s typically 
eaten with every meal, in the form of steamed, sticky rice. As author Jason 
Bussell of &ldquo;The Asian Diet: Simple Secrets for Eating Right, Losing 
Weight, and Being Well&rdquo; explains in an interview with Thatsfit.com, 
&ldquo;White rice is the most hypo-allergenic, easily-assimilated and 
energetically neutral of the grains.&rdquo; Since it&rsquo;s so easy to digest, 
rice can be eaten frequently throughout the day. On the other hand, the main 
ingredient for Americans is white bread, which in large amounts causes 
carb-overload, and unnecessary weight gain.</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p>Another major ingredient in the Asian diet is soy, frequently consumed in 
the form of tofu, which contains large amounts of iron, calcium and protein, 
while being low in carbohydrates and fats. Since many Asians tend to be 
lactose-intolerant, they often drink soymilk rather than whole milk. Soymilk is 
a healthier option, as it has the same amount of protein as cow&rsquo;s milk, 
but with smaller amounts of saturated fat and no cholesterol.</p> 
<p>Besides food products, a major contribution to the healthy diet of Asians 
comes from their frequent consumption of tea, particularly green, oolong or 
black. Tea is drunk throughout the day, especially after meals. Its health 
benefits have long been lauded, as it&rsquo;s known to help prevent heart 
diseases, intestinal disorders and cancers as it contains antioxidants. In the 
U.S., on the other hand, coffee, whose health benefits are often questionable, 
remains the preferred source of caffeine.</p> 
<p><strong>Eating Style</strong></p> 
<p>While Americans usually eat from separate dishes, Asians are accustomed to 
family-style dishes, where there is typically one small dish of each food group 
for everyone to share, paired with a bowl of rice and sometimes a bowl of soup. 
Instead of having to finish one&rsquo;s plate, Asians are more concerned with 
finishing one&rsquo;s bowl of rice, while consuming bite size portions of 
various types of dishes, which consist mostly of vegetables. Instead of 
worrying about eating a certain portion size, you simply stop eating once your 
stomach&rsquo;s half full.</p> 
<p>Overall, Asians mostly consume foods that are lower in carbohydrates and 
cholesterol. Sweets and processed foods are rarely ever eaten in Asia, as 
fruits usually suffice as dessert.</p> 
<p>With high mortality rates and lower cases of heart diseases among Asians 
(particularly the Japanese), it&rsquo;s no secret that the traditional Asian 
diet has numerous benefits both physically&mdash;helps maintain a healthy 
weight&mdash;and internally, as your body lower levels of unhealthy toxins.</p> 
<p>Though it&rsquo;s easy to eat as Americans do, given we live in the states, 
you can try adhering to the eating habits of your parents and grandparents, 
since it seems to be working out quite well for a few billion people halfway 
across the world.</p>

hormones and your digestive system. but then again, too much of anything is bad.
