<p>A new multi-industry voluntary agreement announced today by the Alliance 
for a Healthier Generation brings together leading food manufacturers, group 
purchasing organizations and technology companies to help America&rsquo;s 
schools serve healthier meals at more affordable prices. As a result of these 
agreements, more than 30 million students across the country will have access 
to healthier school meals &ndash; including at least 14 million students who 
currently participate in the free and reduced lunch program.</p> 
<p>AdvancePierre Foods, Domino&rsquo;s Pizza, JTM Food Group, McCain Foods 
USA, Rich Products Corporation, Schwan&rsquo;s Food Service, Trident Seafoods, 
HPS, Premier healthcare alliance, Summa/Provista, Interflex, Dole Food Company, 
Inc., and the<b>National Turkey Federation</b> have joined the effort to combat 
childhood obesity by agreeing to increase the availability of products that can 
lead to healthy schools meals. Signatories to these first of their kind 
agreements brokered by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, founded by the 
American Heart Association and the William J. Clinton Foundation, have agreed 
to develop, market and competitively price products that will lead to healthier 
school meal options; streamline the ordering process; and make identifying 
healthy options easier.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&ldquo;With students consuming up to half of their daily calories at 
school, healthy school meals are key to winning the fight against childhood 
obesity,&rdquo; said President Bill Clinton, founder of the William J. Clinton 
Foundation. &ldquo;Building on our agreements that have reduced the number of 
calories in beverages shipped to schools by 88 percent, the Alliance is now 
focusing on helping provide more nutritious meal options to more&nbsp;than 30 
million school children nationwide.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Manufacturers including AdvancePierre Foods, Domino&rsquo;s Pizza, JTM Food 
Group, McCain Foods USA, Rich Products Corporation, Schwan&rsquo;s Food Service 
and Trident Seafoods pledge not to price healthy options out of reach of school 
cafeterias. Signatories will set prices for healthier items that meet the 
Alliance for a Healthier Generation&rsquo;s science-based standards for 
nutrition at prices no higher than less healthy comparable products. 
Participating manufacturers have also pledged to increase the sales of 
compliant products by to least 50 percent of their entire school sales within 
five years.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Manufacturers have committed to aggressively promote products that align 
with the Alliance&rsquo;s Healthy Schools Program standards and will help 
schools meet or exceed the requirements currently being finalized by the USDA. 
Product commitments fall in at least one of the following categories within the 
Alliance&rsquo;s science-based guidelines for school foods:</p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Lean protein products, such as lean red meat, skinless poultry, lean deli 
meats, fat-free or low-fat cheese, beans, and tofu.</li> 
<li>Low-fat lunch entr&eacute;es with reduced total fat, saturated fat and 
sodium levels.</li> 
<li>Whole-grain products, such as bread, pasta and pizza crust. </li> 
<li>Fresh, canned or frozen fruit. </li> 
<li>Non-fried vegetables. </li> 
<li>Zero trans fat cooking oils. </li> </ul> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Increased access and lower prices to purchase healthy meal 
components makes it easier for schools to offer healthier school meals&mdash;a 
key strategy to help combat childhood obesity and to move students and staff 
toward ideal cardiovascular health,&rdquo; said Ralph Sacco, M.D., president of 
the American Heart Association and chairman, department of neurology Miller 
School of Medicine University of Miami.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>Schools can also save time and gain buying power by joining a group 
purchasing organization (GPO). With today&rsquo;s agreement three of the 
largest GPOs in the U.S. with more than $70 billion in combined buying power, 
HPS, Premier healthcare alliance and Summa/Provista, have agreed to offer 
products that meet the Alliance&rsquo;s nutritional guidelines. GPOs have been 
successful at consolidating buying power in other institutional food service 
settings including hospitals, healthcare facilities and universities. By 
applying this same model to America&rsquo;s schools, schools will see a savings 
of 10 to 20 percent in their food and beverage purchases.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p>In order to help schools take the first step in changing their purchasing 
process, the Alliance is collaborating with the technology firm Interflex to 
create an online tool that streamlines the procurement process by assisting 
schools with planning, bidding and purchasing healthier products. Dole Food 
Company, Inc. and the National Turkey Federation have also agreed to leverage 
their tools and resources to support schools in their implementation of this 
new approach to school meals.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p>&ldquo;Today is just the beginning. The food manufacturer, group purchasing 
and technology agreements are just three components of the Alliance&rsquo;s 
larger healthier school meals strategy with the goal of impacting more than 30 
million students within a five year period,&rdquo; said Ginny Ehrlich, 
executive director of the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; </p> 
<p>Additional components in the Alliance&rsquo;s school meals strategy to 
support food service professionals being launched over the next year will 
include in-person and online training programs, menu planning and cooking 
techniques and recipes from celebrity chefs to school food service staff.</p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p>Last week, the USDA released the proposed rule for the nutrition standards 
in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Program. To help schools more 
easily navigate the Alliance and USDA standards, the Alliance will update their 
guidelines to meet or exceed the final rule. The Alliance agreement announced 
today helps alleviate barriers districts will face in serving healthier school 
meals, and will enhance schools&rsquo; ability to meet those updated standards.
