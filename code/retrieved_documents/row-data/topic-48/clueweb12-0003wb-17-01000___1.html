Foreign Fare: Viva Italian! <br>

Tutta pasta!<br>

<br>
 When 
you think of Italian food, do you picture pepperoni pizza and spaghetti and 
meatballs? Well, if you go to Italy, you probably won't see these foods on a 
menu! Authentic Italian cuisine is about fresh vegetables and herbs like<i>basil
</i> and oregano. It's zesty lemon sauce and chicken cutlets and briny olives 
andcapers that bring out the taste of the sea in seafood. back to top <br>

What's Italian cuisine? <br>
 There are many regional styles of cooking in 
Italy. Many Italian dishes are cooked using olive oil, which is high in 
heart-healthyunsaturated fat. And Italians eat lots of <i>complex carbohydrates
</i> like chickpeas, fresh fruits, and a variety of vegetables. You may be 
surprised to learn that Italians eat only moderate amounts of meat and dairy 
products. In fact, the typical Italian diet looks a lot like the<i>Food Guide 
Pyramid</i>. Here are some tasty ingredients found in Italian cooking: 
<ul> 
<li>basil</li> 
<li>Parmesan cheese</li> 
<li>oregano</li> 
<li>fresh tomatoes</li> 
<li>pasta</li> 
<li>olive oil and olives</li> 
<li>red peppers</li> 
<li>fresh figs</li> 
<li>prosciutto</li> 
<li>artichokes</li> 
<li>eggplant</li> 
<li>capers</li> 
<li>greens like Swiss chard</li> 
<li>pine nuts</li> 
<li>fava beans back to top</li> </ul> Are some Italian foods healthier than 
others? <br>
 Ever go to an Italian restaurant and stuff yourself with buttered 
garlic bread, eggplant Parmesan, and a cannoli for dessert? That's one way of 
eating Italian&#151;the high-fat way. If you want a healthy Italian meal, 
choose a simple sauce like marinara or lemon and white wine rather than pesto 
or creamy Alfredo. A single plate of fettuccine Alfredo contains as much fat as 
three pints of almond ice cream! Here are some other healthy Italian food 
choices:
<ul> 
<li>Dress your green salad the way Italians do, with a little olive oil and 
balsamic vinegar.</li> 
<li>When it comes to heavy dishes, like veal or eggplant Parmesan and cheese 
manicotti, skim off the cheese topping, and you'll eliminate a good portion of 
the fat.</li> 
<li>Skip the <i>deep-fried</i> calamari appetizer, which can contain more 
cholesterol than a four-egg omelette and salad drenched in dressing.</li> 
<li>Choose regular pasta instead of high-calorie stuffed pastas, like ravioli 
and tortellini.</li> 
<li>Think of the Italian flag: red tomatoes, green zucchini, and white beans 
are the beginning of a nutritious meal.</li> 
<li>Ask to have the sauce served on the side so you can decide how much of it 
you want to eat. back to top</li> </ul> Tutta pasta! <br>
 Spaghetti, 
fettuccine, farfalle, penne, rigatoni, and cappelletti. Whatever the shape, 
pasta makes a quick and tasty meal. Pasta is a<i>carbohydrate</i> that is 
naturally low in fat unless you smother it in a cream sauce. To get more fiber 
and nutrients, look for whole-wheat pasta in most markets and health food 
stores. Pasta also comes in flavors like spinach, sun-dried tomato, and lemon 
pepper. These flavored pastas aren't any healthier than regular pasta, and they 
don't count as a vegetable<i>serving</i>. But those colors can liven up your 
plate!back to top <br>
