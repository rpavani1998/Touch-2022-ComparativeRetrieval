<i>When Oscar-winning actress Mira Sorvino learned her 
father had type 2 diabetes, she took quick action. In this Lifescript 
exclusive, find out how she helped improve her dad&rsquo;s health and lowered 
her children&rsquo;s risk of the chronic disease..</i>. <br>
<br>
Acting is a 
family business for Paul and daughter Mira Sorvino. So when Paul, 71, a veteran 
character actor who plays tough guys, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, it 
was only natural for Mira, 43, to make this a family affair too.<br>
<br>
The 
role of caretaker came easily to Mira, who won an Academy Award for best 
supporting actress in &ldquo;Mighty Aphrodite.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;After my 
dad was diagnosed, I realized I had to educate myself about his 
condition,&rdquo; says Sorvino, who also charmed moviegoers in &ldquo;Romy and 
Michele&rsquo;s High School Reunion.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wanted to be equipped with 
the right tools to help keep him on track with his treatment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>

That&rsquo;s not easy with a dad who enjoys hearty Italian meals and produces 
pasta sauces for supermarkets.<br>
<br>
Like many diabetics, Paul initially 
controlled blood-sugar levels by lowering carbohydrate and sugar intake, 
exercising, losing weight and taking prescription medicine.<br>
<br>
At first, 
the day-to-day maintenance overwhelmed him, and he kept his diagnosis a secret. 
He didn&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;burden&rdquo; Mira and her siblings, the actress 
says. Plus, the former &ldquo;Law &amp; Order&rdquo; cop was used to playing it 
tough.<br>
<br>
That&rsquo;s why the father-daughter duo launched the 
&ldquo;Diabetes Co-Stars&rdquo; awareness program, which aims to encourage 
relatives and friends to support those with the disease.&nbsp;It afflicts 
nearly 24 million Americans, including 11.5 million women.  In this Lifescript 
exclusive, Mira Sorvino reveals what she&rsquo;s doing to keep her pasta-loving 
father healthy and cut the odds that she &ndash; or her three kids &ndash; will 
develop diabetes.<br>
<br>
<strong>What were your father&rsquo;s symptoms 
before his diagnosis?<br>
</strong>He was very tired, thirsty and had a general 
malaise. No one knew these were symptoms [of diabetes] though. He ignored them 
for quite a while.<br>
<br>
<b>How did he find out?<br>
</b>He saw his doctor 
for something unrelated and the physician took a blood test that showed his 
blood sugar was in the 420s. [Normally, this level should be between 70-150.]
<br> <br>
<b>What did he do after finding out?<br>
</b>He actually kept the 
diagnosis secret for a few months. He was in denial. He didn&rsquo;t completely 
follow his doctor&rsquo;s advice, but didn&rsquo;t completely ignore it either.
<br> <br>
<b></b> <b>How did you discover he was diabetic? <br>
</b>It was 
quite frightening. I was at my father&rsquo;s house recuperating from having a 
new baby and trying to avoid the flu that the rest of my family had. [Mira is 
married to actor Christopher Backus, and they have three children: Mattea, 6; 
Johnny, 4; and Holden, 1.]<br>
<br>
Dad is a wonderful cook and had made this 
delicious pasta<i>fagioli</i>, a traditional Italian dish with pasta and beans. 
About 20 minutes after he enjoyed a generous helping, he turned a purple-ashen 
color, looked down and slumped forward in his chair. <strong>What did you do? 
<br></strong>I was instantly worried. I asked him, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going 
on?&rdquo; and he said he didn&rsquo;t know. I thought to call an ambulance, 
but he just wanted to lie down in his room.<br>
<br>
I stood vigil outside the 
door for about 20 minutes, repeatedly asking, &ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo; 
Finally, he said he was and told me: &ldquo;I think it was the diabetes. I took 
pills, and I think it&rsquo;s getting better.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<strong>Why had 
he kept it from you?<br>
</strong>He&rsquo;s from a generation where men were 
tough guys brought up to be John Wayne.<br>
<br>
Ironically, I don&rsquo;t 
think of this knowledge as a burden. I want to support and encourage him to 
take care of himself.<br>
<br>
<b>Is</b> <b>there a family history of diabetes?
<br></b>My father&rsquo;s brother has it. But I think you fail to consider that 
it can actually happen to you, or your loved one, until a confirmed diagnosis.
<br> <br>
<b>After that health scare, what went through your head? <br>
</b>I 
realized diabetes was serious, yet I had no knowledge about it or how to make 
sure my dad was safe and healthy. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to become involved 
in his health. I know family and friends are often clueless about what diabetes 
is and how to help.<br>
<br>
<b>What are you doing to support your father? <br>

</b>When his original treatment wasn&rsquo;t working, I encouraged him to talk 
to the doctor and try new medicines.<br>
<br>
I also try to get him to eat more 
healthfully, which is tough on him. I used to stock the freezer with ice cream 
to accompany cake. Now it [holds] sugar-free, low-fat options. I serve him huge 
salads, not big bowls of pasta or fried foods.  I encourage him to exercise 
more too. He has always played tennis, but I urge him to do more than that. Now 
when he&rsquo;s at my house, we walk on the beach.<br>
<br>
<b></b> <b>Has your 
father made other dietary changes?<br>
</b>He doesn&rsquo;t eat sugar anymore, 
which was a big change. Even more significant is that he cooks low-carb pasta 
and eats less of it than before.<br>
<br>
Being Italian and eating pasta is 
important for our family; it&rsquo;s a way of life. My grandfather was born in 
Naples and had pasta once a day &ndash; sometimes 2-3 times a day. When I was 
growing up, he wouldn&rsquo;t come to our house for Thanksgiving unless there 
was a pasta dish too.<br>
<br>
So cutting back and going low-carb was a very 
big step for my dad. To make dietary changes easier for diabetics who enjoy 
pasta, he hopes to produce a low-carb version with his company [Paul Sorvino 
Foods].<br>
<br>
<b>Is his diabetes under control now?<br>
</b>Thanks to diet, 
exercise and medicine, he&rsquo;s doing great. He actually looks younger than 
he did a few years ago. Like my uncle, who also has diabetes and lost a lot of 
weight to [treat] his diabetes and [boost] cardiac health, my father is 
improving his health.<br>
<br>
The way he has handled this [diagnosis] is brave 
and admirable. At first, though, he was afraid people would regard him as 
feeble.<br>
<br>
<b>How has&nbsp;your dad&rsquo;s diagnosis spurred you to make 
changes to ward off diabetes?<br>
</b>I&rsquo;ve always led a healthy lifestyle 
and been active, so it didn&rsquo;t spark many lifestyle changes. In college, I 
was on the crew team. I love to run -- it&rsquo;s my favorite exercise. And I 
always work out because being in shape is part of my job description.  But I 
made some significant dietary changes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Like what?<br>
</strong>
We were eating too much sugar.<br>
<br>
I always compensated by burning it off 
through exercising, but seeing my father and uncle live with diabetes made me 
realize that wasn&rsquo;t enough. I needed to modify my sugar intake and set a 
healthy example for my kids.<br>
<br>
<strong>How tough was that? <br>
</strong>
Sugar is everywhere you turn&hellip; ice cream and cupcake stores. I&rsquo;m 
trying to switch the kids to eating more fruits and yogurt versus those sugary 
things.<br>
<br>
We don&rsquo;t drink sugar soda. I don&rsquo;t eat a lot of 
pasta and pizza either, but I overdose on breads and sweets. Now I realize the 
importance of cutting down on those things.<br>
<br>
<b>What are you teaching 
your kids about diabetes?<br>
</b>First, they see what we&rsquo;re doing for 
Grandpa and know he can&rsquo;t eat certain things. They&rsquo;re starting to 
understand some foods might not be healthy.<br>
<br>
So we&rsquo;re cutting out 
some unhealthy foods like macaroni and cheese when we eat out. Instead, 
I&rsquo;ll make a healthier version at home by mixing eggs into hot pasta and 
use the heat of pasta to cook the egg with a tiny bit of low-fat cheddar and 
butter.<br>
<br>
They also understand that taking walks on the beach and 
playing tennis with Grandpa keeps their bodies healthy. <strong>What have you 
learned from your father&rsquo;s diabetes?<br>
</strong>We&rsquo;ve all learned 
that you can be a happy, healthy person despite diabetes &ndash; that you can 
be empowered by taking control over your blood sugar levels.<br>
<br>
Diabetes 
is something that affects the whole family, not just the person diagnosed with 
it. We&rsquo;ve made [managing it together] a positive in all our lives.<br>

<br> <b>How Much Do You Know About Diabetes?</b> <br>
In the United States 
alone, 23.6 million people have diabetes. And 5.6 million of them don&rsquo;t 
even know it. Unfortunately, misinformation about diabetes is rampant &ndash; 
and mixing up the facts about this disease can have dire consequences. Are you 
confused about diabetes? Test your knowledge with ourdiabetes quiz. <br>
