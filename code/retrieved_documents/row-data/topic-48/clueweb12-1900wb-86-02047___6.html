<h3>The Truth About Carbs- An Objective View From the Fun Pasta People 
Themselves</h3> Thursday, August 11th, 2011 
<p>&nbsp; Well, isn&rsquo;t this the question of the ages. In recent years, 
our friend the carb has been made out to be the bad guy&hellip;.every time. 
Sugar, flour, potatoes&hellip;.even fruits have been banned in many of these 
&ldquo;miracle&rdquo; diets. We&rsquo;ve all heard of, and probably tried, the 
Atkins diet. I tried it. It lasted for a complete day, and I was quite proud of 
myself.&nbsp;But, it made me feel terrible and truly was not&nbsp;a pleasant 
experience.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&hellip; what really is 
a carb, and why do we love (and need) them? A carb, full name carbohydrate, is 
a component of food used for ENERGY in the body. That&rsquo;s right, you 
don&rsquo;t get your energy from that bun less loaded bacon cheeseburger Atkins 
encouraged you to gorge on, you get more&nbsp;from the fries.</p> 
<p>Hmmm probably not&hellip;..</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last time I checked, you need 
energy to work out. &nbsp;Our bodies crave pastas, breads and rice because we 
need them for our bodies to function properly. You may have heard of net carbs, 
which are the kind with fiber and lower sugar, like PASTA AND WHOLE WHEAT 
BREADS!!! These are the kinds to fill up on! Nix the fries and go for a potato. 
Pass up the huge bowl of spaghetti or deep dish pizza and go for some whole 
wheat pasta dishes. Even regular white pastas contain a plentiful amount of the 
&ldquo;good carbs&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to mention, our pasta is a lot healthier 
than many other fattening and sugar loaded fundraising options.&nbsp;Which is 
why&nbsp;we reccomend pairing any of our pastas with a zesty marinara or olive 
oil sauce component and &hellip;voila! Not only are you getting your energy and 
fiber, your piling on those vitamins, antioxidants and omega 3&rsquo;s. Not to 
mention all of our pasta has 6 grams or more of protein per serving, and very 
low sugar! And for those of you who take extra care, check out our Petite Pasta 
Nests&hellip;.pretty nifty little things with 100 calories a nest. They come in 
whole wheat, spinach basil garlic, and tri-color. They really are delicious, 
and full of the good-for-you carbs.</p> 
<p>Mmmmm Probably yes&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 
<p>So are carbs really bad for you? Absolutely not. Just like everything else 
in life, balance is the key.</p>
