<br> <b>What do customers say about Beauty's whole wheat pizza?</b>  During May 
2005 some of our customers helped us taste test our new wheat pizza. Here are 
some of the emails customers sent! (We removed names and email addresses but 
included the full email text.) <i> we ordered the wheat pizza on wednesday 
night [substituting pepperoni for peppers] and it was amazing! we would 
absolutely get this again. it was light and crunchy and not too 'wheaty' like 
some others can be. basically, it didn't taste super healthy, but thats a good 
thing. =) thanks for doing this, and i hope you keep carrying this crust.</i> 
<i> The pizza was delicious - and 100% whole wheat! Keep up the good work and 
make sure someone from the Globe hears about you. We need more fast food like 
this.</i> <i> I love the cheese wheat pizza..... </i> <i> Oh yeah, I get 
Beauty's Pizza all the time. I used to live on Market St., and could see the 
store from my window. Now I live a farther away, but still work in the 
neighborhood, so I would say that I get pizza a couple times a month and always 
end up ordering Beauty's. I did like the whole wheat pizza. I ordered 1 with 
mushrooms, green peppers and red onions (the special), and 1 with tomatoes and 
spinach. The spinach one was absolutely fantastic. The mushroom one was also 
good, but a little dry...nothing that a little extra sauce wouldn't take care 
of. I would definitely order whole wheat crust again. I like the original 
crust, but I am trying to get more whole grains in my diet, and the whole wheat 
pizza is an excellent addition. Next time, I think I might try black beans, 
spinach, tomatoes and hot peppers. Thanks, and keep the good pizza coming. ;)
</i> <i> I just tried the whole wheat pizza and I really enjoyed it. I thought 
the pizza was very tasty and just as good as other Beauty pizzas. When I tasted 
just the crust without toppings, I may prefer the taste of Beauty's regular 
crust a little, but I would definitely order the whole wheat crust again.</i> 
<i> That whole wheat crust was great! Really, it had a nutty taste. It was so 
much better than your regular crust and I liked it thin like it came. I would 
buy that crust everytime. Please make it part of your regular menu.</i> <i> I 
finally got the Whole Wheat Pizza today with the suggested toppings. I had 3 
other people here try some as well and we all agree it was very good and would 
order it again.</i> <i> I think the whole wheat is really good. I think it is 
as good as the regular crust and I would probably order it every time I call 
Beauty's. I hope you decide to keep it.</i> <i> We tried the whole wheat pizza 
last night and it was excellent! My husband (whose favorite meal is a burger 
and fries from McDonald's) even loved it! Love the thinner crust and the 
veggies were the perfect combo.</i> <i> Just to let you know that we have 
ordered the whole wheat crust twice since you put it on the menu for a trial - 
we love it! It was a lifesaver this past weekend when we got back from an 
overseas trip and had a bare cupboard! It's really thin and tastes good with 
any topping. My husband is also grateful that you guys don't pile on the 
pepperoni and keep it simple.</i> <i> I just tried the whole wheat pizza; it's 
great! I feel so healthy. Don't stop making it!</i> <br>
<b>Is Beauty's whole 
wheat pizza 100% whole wheat?</b>  Yes. Our whole wheat crust is made from 100% 
whole wheat flour. We make the dough in our shop every day using only whole 
wheat flour, honey, yeast, salt and olive oil. We do not use any preservatives. 
 Many bread products advertised as whole wheat are in fact made from a mixture 
of refined flour and whole wheat flour. We experimented with several blended 
flour recipes but decided that we prefer the taste and texture of 100% whole 
wheat. Of course, 100% whole wheat is also healthier. <br>
<b>How is Beauty's 
whole wheat pizza priced?</b>  Our 100% whole wheat crust is priced the same as 
an extra topping: $1.25 for medium, $1.50 for large, and $1.75 for extra large. 
Look at our menu for classic and gourmet pizza prices. <br>
<b>What is 
MyPyramid?</b> <br>
 MyPyramid is the US Department of Agriculture's 
replacement for the famous Food Guide Pyramid it last released in 1992. 
(Remember the pyramid depicting different food groups and foods?) The USDA 
released MyPyramid in April 2005. Among other things, the new pyramid 
emphasizes the need to eat whole grains. &quot;Most Americans consume enough 
grains, but few are whole grains. At least half of all the grains eaten should 
be whole grains.&quot;  Here are some links to the official web site 
accompanying the new pyramid. http://www.mypyramid.gov &mdash; the main web site
<br> http://www.mypyramid.gov/pyramid/grains.html &mdash; information on whole 
grains<br>
http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/miniposter.pdf  &mdash; PDF of 
the new pyramid that tells you to &quot;Make half your grains whole&quot;<br>

<b>Should half my grains really be whole? Can I trust the USDA?</b>  The USDA 
advises that at least half of the grains you consume should be whole. You may 
wonder about the impartiality of the USDA given the strength of the food 
industry lobby. As a Cambridge or Sommerville resident you may want to review 
information from a source closer to home&mdash;the Harvard School of Public 
Health. Guidelines from the school actually suggest that all grains should be 
whole.  Here are some snippets from The Nutrition Source, a web site maintained 
by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.<br>
 
&quot;Released in early January, 2005, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
2005 [document on which MyPyramid is based] continues to reflect the tense 
interplay of science and the powerful food industry. Several of the new 
recommendations represent important steps in the right direction.&quot;  
&quot;The guidelines suggest that it is fine to consume half of our grains as 
refined starch [non whole grains]. That's a shame, since refined starches 
behave like sugar. They add empty calories, have adverse metabolic effects, and 
increase the risks of diabetes and heart disease.&quot;  &quot;The body needs 
carbohydrates mainly for energy. The best sources of carbohydrates are whole 
grains such as oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, and brown rice. They deliver the 
outer (bran) and inner (germ) layers along with energy-rich starch. The body 
can't digest whole grains as quickly as it can highly processed carbohydrates 
such as white flour. This keeps blood sugar and insulin levels from rising, 
then falling, too quickly. Better control of blood sugar and insulin can keep 
hunger at bay and may prevent the development of type 2 diabetes.&quot; <b>What 
is the Healthy Eating Pyramid?</b> <br>
 The Healthy Eating Pyramid is an 
alternative food guide created by the Nutrition Department at the Harvard 
School of Public Health. The pyramid can be found atThe Nutrition Source, a 
Harvard web site. The pyramid &quot;is based on the best available scientific 
evidence about the links between diet and health. This new pyramid fixes 
fundamental flaws in the USDA pyramid and offers sound information to help 
people make better choices about what to eat.&quot;<br>
 The Healthy Eating 
Pyramid strongly advises eating whole grain foods. &quot;The body needs 
carbohydrates mainly for energy. The best sources of carbohydrates are whole 
grains such as oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, and brown rice. They deliver the 
outer (bran) and inner (germ) layers along with energy-rich starch. The body 
can't digest whole grains as quickly as it can highly processed carbohydrates 
such as white flour. This keeps blood sugar and insulin levels from rising, 
then falling, too quickly. Better control of blood sugar and insulin can keep 
hunger at bay...&quot; <b>Can whole grain help me lose weight?</b>  There are 
many credible sources you can draw on to decide what type of food and exercise 
are appropriate for you if your goal is to lose weight. If you are on a diet 
and would like to order from Beauty's, we do suggest ordering our whole wheat 
pizza and salads rather than our regular pizza. In addition to the many 
nutritional benefits of whole wheat described on this page, our whole wheat 
pizzas have a thinner crust than our regular pizza.  You may also find the 
following guidance from the MIT e-Well Tips newsletter interesting. <br>
 
&quot;If you're trying to find a healthy way to lose weight, increasing the 
amount of whole grains in your diet might be your answer! Whole grains fall 
under the category of &quot;complex carbohydrates.&quot; Complex carborhydrates 
take the body a longer amount of time to digest and absorb than refined grains 
(such as pasta, white bread and white rice). Because of this, there is only a 
moderate rise in blood sugar and insulin in the body. The end result is not 
only a &quot;full&quot; feeling, but a more consistent level of energy (unlike 
the drastic highs and lows that refined grains produce). Feeling fuller longer 
often leads to eating less total calories each day, and having a more steady 
energy level may help bring you success in reaching your weekly fitness plan 
goals!&quot; <b>Why is whole grain healthy?</b>  Grains are and have always 
been a critical part of our diet. Whole grain provides significantly more 
nutrients and health benefits than refined grain.  See &quot; Why is it 
important to eat grains, especially whole grains?&quot; on the MyPyramid.gov 
web site for basic overview of the importance of eating whole grain.<br>
 For a 
more scientific explanation, see theCarbohydrates and Fiber sections of The 
Nutrition Source from the Harvard School of Public Health. <br>
 Some snippets 
from The Nutrition Source:  &quot;Although the fine points of the glycemic 
index and glycemic load may seem complicated, the basic message is simple:<b>
Whenever possible, replace highly processed grains, cereals, and sugars with 
minimally processed whole-grain products.</b>&quot;  &quot;Some tips for 
increasing fiber intake...Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice 
and whole-grain products.&quot; <b>How did Beauty's get interested in whole 
wheat?</b>  In April 2005 we called one our first time customers to make sure 
she enjoyed her salad and had a good experience with our delivery service. 
Melanie was very pleased with both but didn't seem too interested in trying our 
gourmet pizza! She said that she was avoiding pizza for nutritional reasons but 
would love to try a whole wheat pizza.  That sounded interesting so we emailed 
some of our customers to gauge interest in whole wheat. The response was 
overwhelmingly positive. We started experimenting and made dozens of small 
batches of dough using different types and amounts of flour and other 
ingredients. From the moment our first &quot;experiment&quot; came out of the 
oven we fell in love with the taste and texture. When our staff came to the 
shop at 5 PM that Sunday we had them sample the pizza and they were also 
incredibly enthusiastic.  Over the next few weeks we involved our customers in 
taste testing and tweaking our recipe. You can read some of the feedback we 
received above. By Memorial Day weekend we felt ready and added our whole wheat 
pizza to the menu. We hope you enjoy our whole wheat pizza as much as we do!<br>
