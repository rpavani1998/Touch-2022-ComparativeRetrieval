<p><b>International Collection Tapenade Tips<br>
</b></p> 
<p><b>Tapenade Pinwheels</b><br>
 Take one sheet of ready roll puff pastry, 
spread with your choice tapenade. Roll the pastry up and bake until crisp, once 
cool slice into bite sized pinwheels.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>Super Sandwiches</b>
<br> Replace mayonnaise or salad cream in sandwiches or wraps with a tasty 
tapenade for a healthier option. Try red pepper tapenade, goat&#146;s cheese 
and rocket for a delicious tapenade sandwich.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>More&#146;ish 
Mushrooms</b><br>
 Snap the stalks off mushrooms and fill the inside with your 
choice of tapenade. Stick two mushrooms together, dip in egg and breadcrumbs 
then deep fry for a more&#146;ish mushroom snack or starter.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>
Simply Pasta</b><br>
 For a quick healthy supper, mix any flavoured tapenades 
with a little olive oil to make a paste. Simply stir into hot pasta for a 
delicious meal.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>Creamy Pasta</b><br>
 Mix equal quantities 
of your choice of tapenade with mascarpone cheese. Stir into hot pasta for a 
scrumptious pasta sauce.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>Swirly Soups</b><br>
 Finish soups 
with a swirl of tapenade. Try tomato soup with kalamata olive tapenade for a 
taste sensation.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>Pizza Time</b><br>
 Use tapenade instead of 
tomato sauce as a base for tasty homemade pizzas.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>Chip 
&#145;n&#146; Dips</b><br>
 Tip a bag of nachos into an ovenproof dish; pour 
your favourite tapenade over the top and sprinkle with grated cheese. Grill 
until the cheese has melted and serve as a delicious snack to share.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> <b>Absolute Avocado</b><br>
 If you love avocados then why not remove the 
stone and replace with your tapenade for a tasty treat.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<b>
Vegetarian Options</b><br>
 Take a few slices of eggplant, mozzarella and beef 
tomato. Stick together using the tapenade between each layer. Cover with grated 
cheese and bake in pre heated oven, until the cheese melts and is golden brown.
