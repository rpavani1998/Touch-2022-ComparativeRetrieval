<h1>Healthier Without Wheat Book Giveaway</h1> <br>

<p><strong>Now you have a chance to win a copy of <em>Healthier Without Wheat
</em>!<br>
</strong><br>
 One winner will win a copy of <i>Healthier Without 
Wheat: A New Understanding of Wheat Allergies, Celiac Disease and Non-Celiac 
Gluten Intolerance</i> by Dr. Stephen Wangen.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Do you have health problems you haven't been able to solve? For millions of 
people, bread, pasta, and many other foods are bad for their health. But it can 
be difficult to figure out if this is what is causing your problem. And because 
most doctors simply aren't knowledgeable about celiac and non-celiac gluten 
intolerance, it is that much harder to get good information.<br>
<br>
<em>
Healthier Without Wheat</em> teaches you how to find out if wheat or gluten is 
making you sick, why this can be more difficult than it may appear, how 
hundreds of health problems are connected to wheat and gluten reactions, how 
you can be gluten intolerant even if you don't have celiac disease and why 
non-celiac gluten intolerance can make you just as sick as celiac disease.</p> 
<p><br>

Without Wheat</em>.</p>
