<p>We&rsquo;ve recently tagged a few items &ldquo;a story that won&rsquo;t 
die.&rdquo;Here is another one, the continuing analysis of the Pratt &amp;<br>
 
Whitney GTF for the Boeing 737 MAX.</p> 
<p>Although Boeing&rsquo;s Lauren Penning told The Puget Sound Business 
Journal there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;team&rdquo; at Boeing working on this 
prospect, reports out of Aspire Aviation (now Orient Insight), Aeroturbopower, 
Airline Economics and last month&rsquo;s ISTAT meeting continue to create buzz 
on this topic. The AirInsight piece was published in limited circulation two 
weeks ago.</p>

<p>With an airframe older than the A320 (and with less groung clearance), 
Boeing will have to catch all 0.001&prime;s to compete. As long as the landing 
gear is not giving the clearance for a large diameter turbofan the engine will 
have to compensate it. I have been always in favor of a new design (read my 
articlehttp://www.engineerstoolkit.net/what-we-fly-what-we-will-fly). As the 
two manufacturers have no competition and years of backlog, why spend more?</p>

<p>As long as there are NO guarantees from SNECMA for their engine on the<br>
 
737MAX, there are NO real contracts for that airplane, only commitments<br>
 
subject to performance guarantees from Boeing AND SNECMA!</p> 
<p>In stark contrast, Airbus has firm commitments for 1,200+ A320NEOs, be-<br>

 cause both the P&amp;W and the GE engines on that airplane have defined<br>
 
performance guarantees on the A320NEO.</p> </li>

<p>So, what are we really talking about here for the B-737MAX? A new wing and 
wingbox will address the shorter MLG &lsquo;problem&rsquo; too. But a new 
taller MLG means additional weight. How much taller would Boeing be willing to 
go? Making the NLG taller is less of an engineering challange. A new wing could 
also address the question on wingtip devices, although you don&rsquo;t need a 
new wing to solve that.</p> 
<p>Are we now talking about a new Boeing composet wing and mostly composet 
wingbox? That will be an interesting concept, as some &lsquo;experts&rsquo; say 
composets don&rsquo;t scale down very well and on a scale, like the B-737, 
doesn&rsquo;t reduce that much weight. Boeing now has experience with 
designing, building, installing, and fielding composet wings and airplanes, via 
the B-787. They should take advantage of that painful learning process if it is 
at all possible with the B-737MAX, and B-777X, the next two major Boeing 
developement programs.</p> 
<p>The CFM LEAP-1B engine will be a good engine. No one knows, yet, if a 
scaled down GTF will be as good, or better, yet. We now know the LEAP-1B engine 
will have a 68.4&Prime; fan, but if Boeing has to make other changes to the 
airframe to fit a 71&Prime; or 72&Prime; fan GTF on the B-737, then CFM might 
just as well let the LEAP-1B grow a little.</p> 
<p>I am confident Boeing will meet, or exceed its goal for the MAX in 
comparison to the NG. Just look at the happily unexpected performance of the 
B-747-8F airframe if you like.</p> </li>

<p>If Boeing would be pushed to do a new wing, wingbox, landing gear on top of 
a new engine, tail, fly by wire.. I guess the next bottlenecks are the dated 
cockpit, cargo capability, heritage systems. Boeing knows what they want with 
the NSA. Investing too much in the 737 while giving this decade to Airbus and 
new entrants. I doubt it.</p> 
<p>You never know how good a new aircraft will be. Still you have order them, 
spend Billions, choose. Luckely airlines have smart, skilled engineers and 
fleet managers too, and lawyers. Better not overpromise.</p> </li>

<p>I think if Boeing decides to make the GTF a second engine option on the 
MAX, that may be a game changer for the NSA. The MAX is already going to have 
some kind of FBW, and the tail surface changes would depend heaverily on any 
wing changes, since the engines are about the same thrust family as the current 
NG&rsquo;s CFM-56-7B engines. Boeing has already redesigned the very tail of 
the airplane, aft of the rudder and elevators. They did that with something in 
mind, not just a simple reduction in drag (they could have done that at anytime 
in recent years). Boeing seems to be playing coy on most of the B-737MAX 
configueration, only talking about the obvious, and a few public announced wind 
tunnel tests here and there. As far as I know the upcoming high speed wind 
tunnel and low speed wind tunnel testing to be done in England and the US in a 
few months is the third round of both types of testing. That is a lot of 
testing for a design that is still a few years from being frozen. I am sure 
Boeing is also doing a lot of computer testing to refine the configueration 
before the wind tunnel tests are accomplished.</p> 
<p>The NSA will eventually come. But every new change Boeing puts into the MAX 
to compete, or beat the NEO just pushes the NSA further into the future. I know 
Airbus isn&rsquo;t sitting on their hands either. It has been a long time now 
since Airbus claimed the NEO developement only costs one billion Euros, and the 
engine OEMs are paying for it. Just like Boeing, Airbus doesn&rsquo;t want to 
come out with the second best product.</p> </li>

<p>KC, when you look at the to-do-list for respectively the neo and the MAX, 
it&rsquo;s not really that much of a surprise is it, that when compared to the 
R&amp;D costs for the MAX, the costs for the neo R&amp;D comes in at a bargain.

<p>If the engines share the same LEAP core technology the fan is the 
difference. Rule of thumb says a .5 % gain for every inch fan diameter. So if 
the NEO has a 12-14% sfc improvement, the engine for the MAX should deliver 5% 
less. If the GTF adds a few % extra for the NEO, Boeing has an issue. To be 
consistently denied until a solution is in place.</p>

<p>keesje, the -1B core will be different from the -1A and -1C core. But all 
three will be about the same technology level (the -1B core may be slightly 
advanced sin ce it is the latest version of the LEAP engine). CFMI has said 
NOTHING as to which version of the LEAP engines will have the lowest FSFC. The 
LEAP, and GTF are of such a next generation of engine, I&rsquo;m not convinced 
the old rule of thumb applies anymore.</p> 
<p>Boeing is under no oblagation to keep you updated on the developement of 
any of its products, just as EADS is under no obligation to keep me informed of 
their products (but I wish John would stoip calling asking me for advice, LOL).
</p> 
<p>Speaking of John, he is a salesman, you know that keesje. It is his job to 
push Airbus and talk down Boeing. Like all salesman, he lives by only one 
golden rule, &ldquo;if you cannot dazzle &lsquo;em with brillance, then baffle 
&lsquo;em with b^#$%!t&rdquo;.</p> </li> </ul>

<p>Maybe Boeing will put PW1524G on the 737-6 MAX with a cropped fan at 68,5 
inch diameter.</p> 
<p>I was kidding, of course.</p> </li>

<p>If we define &ldquo;team&rdquo; as two people, and &ldquo;study&rdquo; as 
billed at least one hour to in the calendar year, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised 
to learn that Boeing is studying a DC-3/C-47NEO, restarting the SST project, 
running off a few hundred more Stearman Model 75s for the collector market, 
etc. Doesn&rsquo;t mean they will ever do any of those things, doesn&rsquo;t 
mean they won&rsquo;t. But a rumored study isn&rsquo;t evidence of anything one 
way or another.</p>
