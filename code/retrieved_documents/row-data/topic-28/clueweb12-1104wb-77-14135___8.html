<h2>Understanding appraisers in aircraft&nbsp;values</h2> January 16, 2012 32 
comments <br>

<p>There has been an active discussion in the comment section on the &ldquo;
Rate 35&rdquo; post and the relative merits of appraisals and appraisers with 
respect to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737NG.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve been involved in the airline business since 1979 and from 1990, 
when we co-owned Commercial Aviation Report (CAR), have followed the appraisal 
business. Given the discussion in &ldquo;comments,&rdquo; we think a dedicated 
post is worthwhile.</p> 
<p>CAR created the industry&rsquo;s first commercial appraisal conference in 
1990. ISTAT&ndash;the International Society of Transport Aircraft 
Traders&ndash;at that time was still largely a small, professional 
organization, far difference than what it is today.</p> 
<p>CAR&rsquo;s first conference brought together nearly every appraisal 
company then in existence in the US to compare and discuss appraisals of what 
was called Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs) and appraisals 
published by the firms.</p>

<h2>A330 vs&nbsp;787</h2> May 31, 2009 1 comment <br>

<p>Another in the continuing reports from the Airbus Innovation Days&hellip;.
</p> 
<p>Airbus provided an A330/A340 market update during its Innovation Days 
presentations in Hamburg earlier in May.</p> 
<p>The A340 has become irrelevant to the new airplane market, with only a 
handful of new orders remaining and virtually none forthcoming in the last 
several years. Airbus is tweaking the A340 with some aerodymic improvements 
designed to reduce fuel burn by 1%. Along with maintenance procedure changes to 
the A330, the A340 increases the interval on the A Check to 800 flight hours 
from the current 600; C Check intervals go from 18 months to 21-24 months; 
Intermediate Checks increased from five years at EIS to the current six years 
and remains unchanged; and Structural Checks increase from 10 years to 12 years.
</p> 
<p>We resisted asking whether the A340&prime;s Product Improvement Package 
includes a large Parking Brake sign in the cockpit.</p>

<h2>2009: Recovery for Boeing, Challenges at&nbsp;Airbus</h2> January 6, 2009 
5 comments <br>

<p><strong>Update, January 10:</strong></p> 
<p>Bloomberg News reports EADS says it will be three years after the 
A400M&rsquo;s first test flight&ndash;which remains unscheduled&ndash;before 
Airbus will ship the airplane to customers. This is hardly good news.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Commercial Aviation enters 2009 with a high level of uncertainty. 
Boeing&rsquo;s headlining 787 program and the lower profile but increasingly 
costly 747-8 development face critical milestones this year. Airbus&rsquo; A350 
does, too. The global financial market meltdown last year hopes for recovery 
this year but the global economy is questionable.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>These are just a few of the issues facing Airbus and Boeing this year.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Boeing continues to dominate the headlines with its troubled 787 program, 
so we&rsquo;ll look at the US aerospace company first.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Year for Recovery</strong></p> 
<p>This has the makings for being a year of recovery in new airplane programs. 
No new joint BCA-IDS program is without significant issues and two of 
BCA&rsquo;s three new airplane projects have significant delays.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em>The 787 program</em> needs little review here; its issues are well 
known. The question is when the first flight and flight testing will begin.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Boeing says the first flight will be in the second quarter; <em>Air 
Transport Wor</em>ld first reported that April 20 is now the schedule for first 
flight and<em>Flightblogger</em> followed with its own reporting on a timeline 
leading to this date. Our own checks suggest that a new development and testing 
timeline for the critical software systems is aimed for a sooner-than-later 
second quarter first flight (the old timeline suggested a June-August timeline 
for first flight). Our checks also report, however, that April 20 is thought to 
be aggressive and our sources are unsure this date can be met.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>What is important to emphasize here is that this date is an internal 
timeline and Boeing is only saying first flight will be in the second quarter. 
This means it could take place on June 30 and still meet the publicly stated 
goal.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>At long last, we expect that the first flight and the flight testing will 
get underway this year. These are obviously critical milestones in the recovery 
of the 787 program and Boeing&rsquo;s operations.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Delta Air Lines may cancel the 787 ordered by Northwest Airlines now that 
NWA is a subsidiary of Delta. NWA ordered 18, but Delta&rsquo;s CEO Richard 
Anderson is unhappy with the delays and performance issues (the 787 is 
overweight and has a shorter range than originally advertised, though the 
extent of the latter is in dispute). Anderson likes the 777LR and it&rsquo;s 
possible there could be a deal for more 777LRs to replace the 787-8s ordered by 
NWA.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>A cancellation will be nothing but a minor embarrassment for 
Boeing&mdash;with 900 orders, losing 18 won&rsquo;t matter much and it&rsquo;s 
possible others will come forward to grab these in any event.Read more&hellip;

<h2>EADS profits on increased&nbsp;production</h2> May 14, 2008 1 comment <br>

<p>EADS, parent of Airbus, reported a stronger-than-expected profit on higher 
production at its principal subsidiary. The details may be found in thisAP 
story.</p> 
<p>A couple of take-aways:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>This better performance, despite the worries over the dollar-Euro exchange 
rate, slower-than-desired progress in Power8 cost-cutting and new issues with 
A380 production, may make it more difficult to get cuts from the already 
recalcitrant labor unions; and</li> 
<li>The A320 family, where higher production rates have kicked in (and going 
higher still) has proved to be a key to the Airbus recovery and cash flow. When 
Airbus announced plans to boost production of this family, Boeing criticized 
the move as unwarranted by market conditions. That was hardly the point; 
because of delays and cash flow shortfalls in the A380 program, Airbus really 
had little choice. (That Boeing is now considering boosting the 737 production 
seems to demonstrate Airbus was right about the market demand, too.)</li> </ul> 
<p>Airbus plans to take the A330/340 production to 12 a month by 2010 in 
response to demand for this airplane, higher and sooner than expected. This 
will further aid the cash flow shortfalls from the A380 program.</p> Categories:

<h2>Where does Boeing&nbsp;turn?</h2> March 26, 2008 1 comment <br>

<p>With delivery delays of around 15 months now expected for the Boeing 787 
program, where does Boeing turn to help its customers?</p> 
<p>One suggestion was upping the production of the 767, currently at one a 
month. This won&rsquo;t work&ndash;it takes about two years to do so, according 
to Boeing. By then the 787 program should be more or less back on track.</p> 
<p>A blogger suggested that the 777 could be the answer. Not likely, either, 
because the 777 has a four year backlog and is being produced at the rate of 
seven a month, its highest ever.</p> 
<p>The used airplane market is very tight. Boeing is looking for 777s, 767s 
and even Airbus A330s and A340s with little luck.</p> 
<p>Boeing and the airlines will have to cope as best they can.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the backlog chart for Boeing. The production rates are:</p> 
<p>737: ~30/mo</p> 
<p>747: 1/mo</p> 
<p>767: 1/mo</p> 
<p>777: 7/mo</p> 
<p>787: planned&ndash;initially 3/mo, increasing to 10/mo within 18 mo</p>
