<b>We regularly see these 737 fuselages on rail in Kansas City, Missouri early

<b>5 for originality. <br>
 I am sure the folks at Renton are more used to this 
sort of crossing than us. It must give the people there a sence of pride as so 
many of these birds all over the world are originating from their area! Great 
photo.</b>

<b>Really nice motive. Interesting to see although probably not what those

I really like it. Good work. :)</b>
