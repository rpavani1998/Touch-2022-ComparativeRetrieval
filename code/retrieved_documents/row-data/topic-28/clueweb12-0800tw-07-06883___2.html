<h1>Cockpit Chronicles: What's not to like about the 757? I'll show you. 
(Video)</h1> 
<p>by <strong>Kent Wien</strong> (RSS feed) on Mar 8th 2012 at 8:00AM</p> 
Powerful engines providing stellar performance and short field capabilities are 
just some of the features that set the Boeing 757 apart from the rest. But 
there has to be something that pilots dislike on the airplane, right?<br>
<br>
 
Well, there are two features in particular that I don't care for.<br>
<br>
 I 
dream that someday someone from Boeing or Airbus will call me for advice on 
cockpit ergonomics. Each company does their best to lay out a cockpit to please 
the end user &ndash; the pilot. But sometimes there are just a few quirks that 
slip through. An item, which an engineer may spend only a day or two thinking 
about, can have a lasting impact on the pilots that fly the airplane for 
thousands of hours.<br>
<br>
 Generally speaking, Boeing takes pilot input into 
account when designing the pointy-end of their airplanes. The following two 
items that pertain to the 757 and 767 may seem nit-picky, but I thought I'd 
share them here anyway, even including a video to highlight my second personal 
peeve.<br>
<br>
 To be fair, these airplanes were designed in the late '70s and 
went into service in the '80s. And Boeing has, to some extent, fixed these 
issues in the 777. But here are my minor gripes, with a video to demonstrate 
the second annoyance. <strong>Chimes</strong> <br>
<br>
 You know the chime 
that accompanies the seatbelt sign when it cycles on or off? It happens to be 
my text message alert tone right now-appropriate, I suppose. Well, there's a 
slightly more annoying sound in the cockpit that is supposed to represent 
various different alerts such as:<br>
<br>
 HF and VHF SELCAL - When air 
traffic control needs to get a hold of us, they have the option of sending a
SELCAL (selective calling) ding that alerts us. Upon hearing the ding, we need 
to look either on the forward EICAS screen where the engine information is 
displayed for a clue as to what the ding was, or overhead to see if the SELCAL 
light is on. Unfortunately, some earlier airplanes didn't have that EICAS 
notification feature, so we only have the overhead to differentiate the sounds.
<br> <br>
 Flight Attendant Call - We aren't immediately sure if it's ATC 
calling with a flight level change or if a flight attendant is checking to see 
if we need a bathroom break. The look around the cockpit for the various clues 
to the source can be amusing to someone riding in the jumpseat.<br>
<br>
 
During the preflight, it's a regular ding-fest. As we request the flight plan 
data to be uploaded to the airplane, dings come in rapidly (I've lost count at 
eight dings in less than a minute) for these items and more:<br>
<br>
 
Forecasted winds at altitude uplink<br>
 Route uplink <br>
 Takeoff performance 
data uplink<br>
<br>
 Unfortunately, this is a time when the crew-chief on the 
ground calls us through a headset plugged in at our nose wheel. We may easily 
think it's another nuisance ding and not answer him as these flight plan items 
are coming in.<br>
<br>
 As we taxi out, we could also miss a flight attendant 
call when the latest ATIS information is delivered or we get our load closeout 
information, which includes the number of people on board, the weight of the 
airplane and our stabilizer trim setting.<br>
<br>
 Inflight, these dings 
create a Pavlovian response. Around an hour after takeoff, flight attendants
usually call with meal choices for us. Just as your mouth starts to water after 
hearing the ding, it's always a letdown to discover that it was just the other 
guy updating the winds in the FMC.<br>
<br>
 Years ago, I met two Boeing 
engineers while I was riding in the back of an MD-80 to Dallas. On my left was 
an engineer who was the liaison for Boeing to the FAA as they made changes to 
the cockpit flight computer known as the FMC and to my right was an engineer 
who did the actual programing of any new features in the box.<br>
<br>
 They 
were excited to tell me about the new CPDLC orController Pilot Data Link 
Communication feature they were testing out on one of our 757s. The idea was 
that an Air Traffic Controller could send us a text message that would tell us 
to climb, descend, turn or change our speed. The test program would only be for 
Miami and a few of our 757s. Later this innovative concept expanded to other 
air traffic facilities for use primarily with the 777 and some newer Airbuses. 
After the test period, it was deactivated on the 757.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 I 
couldn't believe my luck. Finally I could give them some input about the ding 
issue.<br>
<br>
 &quot;When ATC contacts you via this CPDLC thing, I would 
imagine there would be a ding?&quot; I asked.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Yes!&quot; one of 
them said proudly.<br>
<br>
 I then prodded them on how we were supposed to 
differentiate the different dings for different functions, all sounding exactly 
the same, as they came in.<br>
<br>
 The engineer asked why we didn't just look 
at the EICAS screen as it would either say, CPDLC, FMC, Ground Call, or Flight 
Attendant.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 I explained that this was nice, but that more 
than half of our 757s didn't have this EICAS 'ding alert' feature.<br>
<br>
 
His partner jumped in, describing the studies Boeing had done that indicated 
that humans could only differentiate between five different sounds in a cockpit.
<br> <br>
 I sighed and pleaded for a simple telephone ring for the flight 
attendant call that comes in on the handset, and then for a few different tones 
for the rest. If I were to mistake the FMC alert for the HF radio call with 
these new sounds, how would that be different to what we have now?<br>
<br>
 I 
felt bad for them. Pilots<em>love</em> Boeing products so I think they were a 
bit taken aback. I dropped the subject and stretched out in the middle seat of 
the MD-80. I certainly wasn't going to mention my second peeve to them. That is:
<br> <br>
<strong>Dim and Dimmer</strong> <br>
<br>
 Depending on the airplane 
and configuration, there are between 32 and 34 different dimming switches and 
knobs to change the lighting intensity on the 757 and 767 cockpit lights. Of 
course, I knew you'd think I was exaggerating, so I made a quick video showing 
each light and dimming knob from a recent flight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Don't get 
me wrong. I've written earlier abouthow much I love the 757 and these 
annoyances are amusingly minor in the grand scheme of airplane design. Maybe 
flying the MD-80 for a while will give me a new level of appreciation for this 
grand airplane.<br>

<p>You know, I used to be impressed when I would glance into the cockpit as I 
was boarding a jet. All those fancy switches and knobs... wow. But now I know 
the truth... half of them are just DIMMER SWITCHES. ;)</p> Reply <br>

<h4>Kent Wien Mar 8th 2012 10:01AM</h4> 
<p>Yeah, and honestly, the rest are just turn signals.</p> <br>

<p>Q: What's the difference between an pilot and a jet engine?<br>
A: A jet 
engine stops whining when the planes shuts down</p> <br>

<h4>Scott Mar 8th 2012 2:54PM</h4> 
<p>Typical pilot.. Bitch, Bitch, Bitch. Be happy you have a job.<br>
And I am 
a retired B-767 Captain (check airman). I love the airplane.</p> Reply <br>
<br>
<h4>Kent Wien Mar 8th 2012 4:17PM</h4> 
<p>I see your point, Scott. But I suppose given the realities of the industry 
today, if that's the only thing I have to complain about, I'm not doing too bad.
<br><br>
Granted, dimming switches in an airplane is a true 'first world 
problem.' It was all done in fun.</p> <br>

<h4>AviatorLEO Mar 8th 2012 2:38PM</h4> 
<p>If it's not Boeing, I'm not going. <br>
Good article, and thank you for 
sharing your cool perspective with those of us who only fly G.A. ;-)<br>

<p>Kent, if your too busy/tired of trying to find all your sounds in the 
cockpit, I'll be glad to take your place with the same pay any day of the rest 
of your life. As a retired UAL Captain forced out of a GREAT career at age 60 
with 22000+ hours including 57s and 67s, I am a little appalled at your 
annoying comments that seem to be more important to you than feeling very lucky 
to be in a position to fly such great aircraft, PERIOD.<br>

<p>Hi Doug,<br>
<br>
I wasn't complaining about my job, just pointing out that 
there's some room for Boeing to make improvements (as they later did in the 
777).<br>
<br>
I would encourage you to go back and read my other posts. After 
five years of writing this column, I think you'd find this to be my first 
'complaint', and it wasn't really about the job. If this is all I have to 
complain about, that's not too bad. Because frankly, after 22 years at this, I 
love my job. And I'm quite sure I'll really miss it after I retire.<br>

<h4>Wayne Mar 8th 2012 10:11PM</h4> 
<p>Loved your article. As a business flyer for over 30 years, I've seen a lot 
of planes come and go, and I prefer Boeing. The airbuses make that weird 
screeching / crunching noise after you're at the gate waiting to get off the 
plane. That doesn't inspire confidence. Back in the day I flew to Buffalo but 
we stopped into Rochester first. Boeing 727. As we left the gate, the pilot 
said we had clearance for takeoff, so we went down the taxiway a lot faster 
than normal, then or now and made the turn onto the runway without slowing down 
and giving full speed coming out of the turn and off we went. The flight over 
to Buffalo was at about 9000'. Great view, I always wondered what the people on 
the ground thought about such a big plane that low just cruising along. Again 
Thanks.</p> Reply <br>

<h4>Harry Mar 8th 2012 4:50PM</h4> 
<p>I think it would have been more clever for the sound to be 
&quot;boing&quot; instead of &quot;ding&quot; - you know, just in case you guys 
forget what kind of equipment you're driving!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Kent, I know you love your job, and I enjoy you sharing parts of it with 
us. Thanks for a fun video.</p> Reply <br>

<h4>Kent Wien Mar 8th 2012 7:59PM</h4> 
<p>Thanks Dave,<br>
<br>
As someone who's been reading this from the 
beginning, I know you'd understand.</p> <br>

<h4>Joe Mar 8th 2012 6:58PM</h4> 
<p>I would be most glad to do your job and happy to boot. See I am a deaf 
pilot and am restricted from being an ATP because of it. Be glad that thats all 
you have to conplain about.</p> Reply <br>
<br>

<h4>Kent Wien Mar 8th 2012 7:59PM</h4> 
<p>And I am glad that this is all I have to complain about. <br>
<br>
As I 
said above:<br>
<br>
&quot;...if that's the only thing I have to complain 
about, I'm not doing too bad.&quot;</p> <br>

<h4>David C. Mar 8th 2012 9:00PM</h4> 
<p>Thanks Kent for posting....regardless of what the others say I think it was 
super interesting! Thanks for continuing to write these posts and making these 
videos - I always look forward to a new post from you! From one pilot to 
another - Fly safe!</p> Reply <br>

<h4>Rick Mar 8th 2012 9:03PM</h4> 
<p>I love being on 757s and love the way they climb but for us passengers the 
757 is pretty uncomfortable (and the overheads, well, suck).<br>
<br>
Thanks 
for the tour and for (trying) to tell Boeing how they can improve their product.
<br><br>
Looking forward to your first video with 4 bars and a real airplane 
that you have to actually fly (Mad Dogs!). Loved them when I was Plat (DTW-BOS 
about 300+ times) and riding in the front (retired and one of the sardines 
now). - nice and quiet.<br>
<br>
Thanks again Kent for all your efforts to 
explain to us how things work; you have a HUGE fan club.<br>

<p>Kent- I'd rather be playing with dimmer switches than sitting in coach with 
my knees shoved up under my chin, with some 300 pounder spilling over into my 
space, sucking in air that 150 others have been coughing into, with some 
screaming baby drooling over the back of the seat in front of me, dealing with 
some cranky flight attendant who takes great umbrage with me when I ask for an 
extra ice cube and maybe the whole can. At least you're getting paid to play 
with switches, I have to pay through the wazoo for my experience on the plane. 
Count yourself lucky.</p> Reply <br>
