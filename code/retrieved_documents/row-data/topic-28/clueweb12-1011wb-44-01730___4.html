<p><strong>Airbus, once the perfect example of European intransigence in 
business, has developed into a model European multinational<br>
</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Just how has this been achieved and what could others learn from 
the story of this market leader?</strong></p> 
<p>As the saga of the European sovereign debt crisis rumbled on last week, 
with Portuguese debt this time downgraded to &lsquo;junk&rsquo; status by the 
ratings agency Moody&rsquo;s, European leaders may now have given up hope of 
finding a short term solution for the continent&rsquo;s economic woes. Some may 
even have begun searching for things with which to distract themselves during 
the summer months, when leaders traditionally enjoy a long recess. EU 
politicians often escape their work by engaging in some of the more eccentric 
hobbies available to the continent&rsquo;s citizens; Nicolas Sarkozy is 
reported to be an avid stamp collector, whilst President of the European 
Council, Herman Van Rompuy, spends his spare time indulging his love of haiku, 
a form of Japanese poetry. Few politicians, however, are known to be keen plane 
spotters &ndash; the term used to describe those who spend their leisure time 
watching the comings and goings of the thousands of aircraft traversing 
Europe&rsquo;s skies on a daily basis. Yet, by occasionally looking upwards 
into the continent&rsquo;s airspace, EU leaders would be able to observe the 
most obvious results of a very European success story.</p> 
<p>Airbus, the European aircraft manufacturer with factories in four countries 
across Europe and clients from around the world, has enjoyed a fruitful few 
years. In the words of the Associated Press, the aeronautical firm 
&lsquo;trounced&rsquo; its main rival, the Seattle-based giant Boeing, in terms 
of orders made during the Paris Air Show in June. Airbus itself lauded the 
interest in its A380 as historic, even if the gloss was somewhat taken off its 
gloating by then technical glitches keeping its showpiece aircraft on the 
ground in Le Bourget. The fact the company is currently researching and 
developing other aircraft also indicates that there may yet be more to come; 
the &lsquo;Grizzly&rsquo; military transport aircraft, although not present in 
Paris due to gearbox trouble, is expected to garner multiple orders from 
governments both inside and outside the European Union, providing the company 
with a product line in an area of the market where it has not traditionally 
excelled. Even better for Airbus was the enthusiasm of companies based in 
emerging markets, particularly China and India, which provided the impetus for 
deals that will secure much needed jobs in the British, German, Spanish and 
French factories.</p> 
<p>This success, however, certainly has not happened by chance. To emerge from 
Boeing&rsquo;s shadow and take up the position of market-leader which it enjoys 
today, Airbus has had to make the most of the technological expertise available 
in Europe as well as pursue sound development and marketing strategies both at 
home and abroad. Government interference, so often a hindrance to European 
companies forced to consider political as well as economic factors, has been to 
the company&rsquo;s advantage, allowing it to avoid the industrial action which 
has hampered Boeing in recent years. The story of Airbus, however, is not just 
one of European business acumen, but rather contains useful lessons from which 
the continents other companies would do well to learn.</p> 
<p>The first of these is that European companies should focus on 
highly-skilled manufacturing, rather than attempting to compete with the more 
efficient production economies of Asia. The seemingly endless supply of cheap 
labour in China has, at least until workers there catch up with those in the 
West in wage terms, put an end to any hopes Europeans may still harbour of 
returning to a pre-eminent position in the world of mass production.&nbsp; 
However, the technical ability of their engineers means that the continent can 
still lead the world in specialist design. In Airbus&rsquo;s case, research, 
development and manufacturing take place in European countries (although some 
production does take place in Taiwan) with the added advantage of protecting 
the company&rsquo;s intellectual property rights &ndash; something which is not 
always possible for those with large factories in the Far East. Furthermore, 
keeping production in Europe has allowed to build a particular culture in 
Europe, in which design, innovation and manufacturing arms all work closely 
together. This environment will mean that it is well placed to compete with the 
prospective Chinese and Russian-designed airliners announced in Paris.</p> 
<p>The second lesson regards the importance of a well devised strategy giving 
Airbus the ability to convert technological brilliance into sales, something 
not always possible in the airline industry (just look at Concorde). The A380, 
for example, was billed as a great technological leap forward that would, in 
time, revolutionise air travel and reduce cost and per passenger fuel 
consumption for airlines. However, rather than making it available to all 
interested buyers on release, Airbus elected to enter into an exclusivity 
agreement with Singapore Airlines, thus gaining the aircraft a reputation for 
luxury and service quality. At the same time, this partnership has engendered a 
degree of loyalty from an airline which constantly scores highly in customer 
satisfaction ratings. Such strategy could prove useful in years to come and 
certainly helped Airbus in the first months after the A380 was completed when 
high-profile problems threatened to ruin the project. Moreover, whilst pursuing 
the grand scheme of building the biggest and most efficient aircraft in the 
world, Airbus has been careful not to neglect the rest of the market; much time 
and money was spent by the company revamping the single aisle A320, a policy 
vindicated when the A320 neo outsold the A380 in per unit terms in Le Bourget.
</p> 
<p>Finally, European manufacturers would do well to imitate the canny Airbus 
approach to government intervention by turning such meddling into a strength 
rather than a weakness. Airbus is now able to reap the rewards of the 
government meddling in its past, although such interference could only be 
described as endemic in its early history. Originally, a government-lead 
initiative, and more a loose conglomeration of different European aeronautical 
organisations rather than a fully-fledged multinational, any policy involving 
laying off workers or ending production in one country was simply not an option 
for early executives; political considerations meant that workers were 
protected whatever the economic necessity. By accepting this, the company has 
been able to make the most of it; when it was developing the A380, Airbus asked 
engineers in different locations to work independently of each other and then 
pooled the best ideas from each, creating an internal market and thus 
strengthening the final product.</p> 
<p>Such conditions will not necessarily be easy to replicate by other European 
manufacturers &ndash; Airbus is fortunate that the air travel industry involves 
innovative engineering and it interests European governments. Nonetheless, by 
applying the principles which have made Airbus successful, companies would be 
able to go some way to remaining competitive over coming years. It is, after 
all, a model for European business.</p>
