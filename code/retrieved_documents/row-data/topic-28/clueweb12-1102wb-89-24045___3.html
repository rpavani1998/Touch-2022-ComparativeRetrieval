<h2>Building Boeing&rsquo;s New Small&nbsp;Airplane</h2> June 30, 2011 1 
comment <br>

<p>An aside before getting into the heart of this post: the following was sent 
by a Wall Street analyst upon hearingthe news that Boeing will lose $300m on 
the first 18 KC-46A tankers.</p> 
<p><strong><em>KC-46A over-runs. </em></strong><em>In the movie Casablanca, 
the Police captain proclaims; &ldquo;This caf&eacute; is closed; I&rsquo;m 
shocked, shocked to find out there is gambling here.&rdquo; A waiter then hands 
him his Roulette winnings. We are equally shocked to read reports that BA 
likely underbid the KC-46 contract. BA&rsquo;s poor performance on the 767 
tanker program and aggressive KC-46A bid drove us to include a nearly $1bn EMD 
contract over-run in our estimates, which are unchanged. We maintain our Buy 
rating and $92 target.</em><em><br>
</em></p> 
<p>Now for the rest of the story, as they say.</p> 
<p>While there remains much uncertainty within Boeing and the industry over 
what Boeing will do about a new airplane&ndash;a 737 re-engine or an entirely 
New Small Airplane (NSA), and if an NSA, what will this look like&ndash;states 
interested in building the NSA also anxiously await Boeing&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>Washington State is the location for building the 737 and having lost the 
787 Line 2, it doesn&rsquo;t want to lose the NSA. The governor has already 
appointed a task force under the name Project Pegasus to plan the campaign and 
strategy to be sure the NSA is built here. Other states probably are already 
planning their strategies, though none has announced anything that we&rsquo;ve 
seen.</p>

<h2>Boeing&rsquo;s Shanahan talks about new programs, shifting 
development&nbsp;in-house</h2> June 29, 2011 5 comments <br>

<p>We sat down with Pat Shanahan, who heads up Boeing airplane programs, at 
the Paris Air Show for a short conversation.</p> 
<p>One of the messages top executives have repeatedly said in recent months is 
that they will not do two new airplane programs, following the challenging and 
unhappy experiences on the 787 and 747-8 developments. We asked about this and 
more.</p>

<h2>The GE Powerhouse and how it wins&nbsp;deals</h2> June 29, 2011 3 comments 
<br> 
<p>Those of us who are intimately familiar with commercial aviation will find 
this as no news. For those who don&rsquo;t deal in this business every day, 
this will provide a better understanding of how deals are won in aviation.</p> 
<p>This is the story of the GE Powerhouse and how family ties combine to 
enable GE Aviation and CFM International to win deals that might otherwise go 
to competing engines.</p> 
<p>None of what we&rsquo;re about to tell you is to suggest that the GE/CFM 
engines are inferior (though, obviously, some might dispute this), because they 
are superb engines. But a telling comment came from CFM&rsquo;s Sandrine 
Lacorre, product marketing director, who said at a UBM Aviation conference, 
&ldquo;What we can&rsquo;t do technically, we will do commercially.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Odds and Ends, Post-Paris Air Show&nbsp;2011</h2> June 27, 2011 34 comments
<br> 
<p>Here are our closing views of the PAS:</p> 
<p><strong>Boeing</strong></p> 
<p>Boeing did very well at the show. We know the headlines almost universally 
say Boeing had a bad show (which it didn&rsquo;t) and was trounced by Airbus 
(which it was), but people easily overlook comparing Boeing&rsquo;s performance 
vs. previous air shows.</p> 
<p>Boeing announced more than 140 orders worth some $22bn&ndash;about equal to 
the 2009 Paris Air Show. By anyone&rsquo;s standards, this ain&rsquo;t shabby. 
Boeing often announces low numbers at air shows, claiming it doesn&rsquo;t hold 
orders for the shows and Airbus does. We regard this as so much poppycock, 
because we know customers drive announcements and both Airbus and Boeing hold 
announcements for air shows at customer requests.</p>

<h2>Leahy to Boeing: you&rsquo;re &ldquo;whistling past 
the&nbsp;graveyard&rdquo;</h2> June 23, 2011 120 comments <br>

<p>This is a story we provided KIRO TV in Seattle, for which we provided 
reports during the air show.</p> 
<p><strong>Airbus A320neo success far exceeds expectations</strong></p> 
<p>Special to KIRO TV</p> 
<p>Airbus ended the primary portion of the Paris Air Show Thursday with 700 
new, firm orders for the A320neo (New Engine Option) and a total of 1,029 firm 
orders and commitments year-to-date. There possibly could be a few more orders 
before the show officially ends Sunday, but the trade show portion ended 
Thursday.</p> 
<p>The results surprised even Airbus super-salesman John Leahy, who said at 
the company&rsquo;s closing press briefing that some deals came together 
unexpectedly during the show.</p>

<h2>Odds and Ends at the Paris Air Show, Day&nbsp;4</h2> June 23, 2011 9 
comments <br>

<p>Our final Odds and Ends as we head back to Seattle Friday.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Marc Birtel, one of the corp-com guys at Boeing, asked us what we were 
impressed by at the Air Show (this was Tuesday, before the Airbus landslide of 
NEO orders). We must be getting too jaded or too familiar with Air Shows, 
because we said, &ldquo;nothing comes to mind.&rdquo; On reflection, these 
impressed us: Boeing&rsquo;s display of technology in the form of the two 
747-8s, a 787, a 737-700 with the Sky Interior; the ever-impressive A380 flying 
display; the Breitling Constellation; the Bombardier &ldquo;igloo&rdquo; 
Pavilion (well, its contents, actually) was way-cool; and of course the 
impressive number of NEO orders.</li> 
<li>We were also impressed by the laid-back, almost shoulder-shrugging at 
attitude of Airbus CEO Thomas Enders. We interviewed him shortly after the 
press conference summarizing the best Airbus Air Show ever and the historic 
AirAsia order, the largest ever in commercial aviation. He seemed suitably 
excited in the press conference but afterward he could have been ordering a cup 
of coffee. (He did consent to a glass of champagne). The orders were all well 
and good, he said, but now Airbus had to produce and deliver them. 
Today&rsquo;s news was already yesterday, for Enders; there were other things 
to be concerned about.</li> 
<li>We opined over at AirInsight about the increasing nasty battle shaping up 
between Airbus and Bombardier.</li> 
<li>See this story about John Leahy dancing to seal the AirAsia deal. CEO Tony 
Fernandes was very funny when telling it and words can&rsquo;t do it justice. 
But Leahy dancing is not a vision we want to have. But it&rsquo;s better than 
the story of his old boss, Jean Pierson, dropping his pants to seal a deal. Now
<em>that&rsquo;s</em> not a vision to go to bed with.</li> 
<li>The saying is &ldquo;Paris in the springtime.&rdquo; We can say, 
&ldquo;Paris in June sucks.&rdquo; It rained (sometimes heavily) for three of 
the four days at the air show. In 2009, it was two out of four.</li> </ul>

<h2>Odds and Ends at the Paris Air Show, Day&nbsp;3</h2> June 22, 2011 8 
comments <br>

<p><strong>Odds and Ends at the Paris Air Show, Day 3</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>John Leahy, COO-Customers for Airbus, says that after CFM re-jigged the 
LEAP engine with a larger fan and the seventh LPT stage, has brought the engine 
to parity with the Pratt &amp; Whitney GTF in fuel burn. The LEAP initially was 
up to 4% lower in fuel burn, leading to PW&rsquo;s early lead in sales.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t buy deals,&rdquo; CFM told our associate, Addison 
Schonland of AirInsight Wednesday during his visit with them at the Paris Air 
Show. He&rsquo;s going to have a special post about the War of Words between PW 
and CFM soon on AirInsight.Read more&hellip;</li> </ul> Categories: Airbus,

<h2>CSeries order intact, says Republic; CFM offered &ldquo;great 
incentives&rdquo; for engine&nbsp;deal</h2> June 22, 2011 6 comments <br>

<p>Bombardier&rsquo;s CSeries order with Republic Airways Holdings, announced 
today at the Paris Air Show, is intact, says the company spokesman.</p> 
<p>Peter Kowalchuk told us late Wednesday (Paris time) that there is no change 
in the CSeries order, despite the Airbus one announced today for 40 A320neos 
and 40 A319neos. First delivery, of the A319neo, is in 2016.</p> 
<p>The first CSeries is scheduled for delivery in 2015.</p>

<h2>U-Turn Al does it&nbsp;again</h2> June 22, 2011 3 comments <br>

<p>Airbus scheduled a 10am press conference to announce an order with Qatar 
for A320neos and the A380. The room was filling when an Airbus spokesman said 
the press conference would be delayed. The reason: CEO Akbar Al-Baker was stuck 
in traffic. Given the notorious traffic, confounded by rain, this was entirely 
plausible.</p>
