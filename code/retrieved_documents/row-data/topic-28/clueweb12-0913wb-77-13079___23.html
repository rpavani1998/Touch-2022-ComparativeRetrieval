<p>The new United Airlines livery on a Boeing 747. </p> 
<p>We have seen the new United livery on a Boeing 737, but now we can see it 
on the Boeing 747. &nbsp;You know what? The more I see this livery the more I 
get used to it and the more I like it. I especially like this photo since we 
are not use to seeing these old Continental colors on a Boeing 747. How about 
you? Are you liking this new combined livery more?</p> 
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This photo is in fact a photoshop. I apologize for 
posting it saying it was a real photo, I was fooled as well. But it still shows 
very closely what the new United livery will look like on the Boeing 747.</p>

<p>The Continental livery was long in the tooth way before the merger. Now 
it&rsquo;s just rediculous. And tell me: how exactly does a spinning globe logo 
relate to the name &lsquo;United&rsquo;?</p>

<p>Hit the nail on the head IMFerret! Continental worked with the globe 
because the globe is made up of continents, hence Continental, but what&rsquo;s 
the relationship to United? There isn&rsquo;t one. They should stick with the 
full United livery and name or the Continental livery and name. Both are nice 
looking. They&rsquo;ve thrown out two babies and kept the loads of bathwater.

<p>It relates because Smisek has an ego and he wants something from 
Continental in the new United, and even though he knows it is crap, he needs 
it. And is there any confirmation that this is real, it looks suspicious.</p>

nice but it lacks excitement. It feels to &rsquo;90&prime;s&hellip;just look at

<p>This scheme is make-do and will not last too long, fortunately. It is the 
most generic, dull and thoughtless compromise imaginable and just shows that 
this deal was done simply because of the usual misguided idea the bigger is 
better, which it rarely is. The airline industry, as I knew it, is gone. 
Uniformity and mediocrity are the way of the future in airline travel.</p> </li>

<p>The worst thing about the Continental scheme is you can&rsquo;t see the 
N-Number. It&rsquo;s always down low and not visible from the front. Needs to 
be right next to the flag.</p> </li>

<p>This livery looks absolutely terrible. The scheme United has right now is 
beautiful, modern, and way better than this crap which was never good to begin 
with. WHERE IS THE TULIP? That IS United Airlines. This is not United. 
United&rsquo;s REAL logo looks better than this crap. I cannot believe this is 
what they came up with.</p> </li>

<p>Something isn&rsquo;t correct about that photo. First, the 747&prime;s 
United flies are powered by Pratt and Whitney engines. It appears in this 
photo, these are General Electric engines. Further, there is a oily streak on 
the tail &ndash; hardly something you would find on a newly painted aircraft. 
Not saying I could be wrong, but wondering where the photo credit is as 
well&hellip;.</p> </li>

livery is simple, clean and classy. I like it a lot. Surprised to hear so<br>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just keep the &ldquo;U&rdquo; logo..it&rsquo;s more familiar

<p>Please, the further away from the bad taste United has left in many 
frequent fliers mouths, the better we are. I have flown on both airlines both 
domestic and international and I can truly say, the United flights were some of 
the most miserable experiences a very frequent flier has ever been forced to 
endure. OlLLLLLD planes, surly attendants, canceled flights. I only pray 
Continental can bring them up to there standards. p.s I would have rather seen 
the CO livery kept toatlly</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>This &lsquo;modification&rsquo; is mine. It was posted on the facebook 
page, The United / Continental Employees Solidarity &amp; Support Team. I never 
intended to fool anyone. It is a modification of an Air Canada Boeing 747-400 
(credit unknown). When United and Continental announced their new official 
livery and released that official shot of artist&rsquo;s rendition 777 flying 
away, I was bothered by both the poor perspective of the picture and by the 
less than quality work of wrapping the name on fuselage. I therefore decided I 
would try my own. It was easy to modify pics of CO jets, but harder to paint 
planes that CO has never flown, like the 747-400. I also have a 787 pic 
modified as well on that facebook page.</p> </li>

<p>And, yes, I could have modified a United 747, but I really liked this air 
to air photo and I didn&rsquo;t know about (and frankly still don&rsquo;t care 
about) the different engines. Interesting to hear experts dissect my 
modification talking about its validity or lack thereof.</p>

<p>And for the record, if the reflections are wrong, then they are wrong on 
the original photo, because I transfered them straight across with the 
exception of a little on the tail which didn&rsquo;t lend well the globe 
design. You should check out the night shot I did of an A380 in new UA colors 
as well. A rumor like that might bumb Airbus&rsquo;s stock up. (Again, NOT MY 
INTENTION)</p>

picture!! Great job Bjork! Thanks. I&rsquo;d like to see the current UA 
livery,blue/white, with CO globe on the tail. Change out the tulip with the 
globe.OH, And definitely NO battleship gray!!</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>By the way, I can tell this is the unfinished picture I shared with some 
friends at Continental. In my final version I had corrected mistakes like the 
tail paint bleeding over the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer.<br>
 
Thanks to everyone who liked the quality (if not the livery itself). 
Personally, I think CO&rsquo;s colors are clean and nice and I also like 
UA&rsquo;s current blue as well. All CEO&rsquo;s have ego, but I don&rsquo;t 
think this has anything to do with his. If they had of kept UA&rsquo;s current 
livery it would have signaled to everyone, consumer and employee alike, that 
this was business as usual&hellip;just another takeover like any other. 
Changing it sends a very powerful and unmistakable message that this United is 
&lsquo;new&rsquo;. A supremely confident and aggresively competitive airline as 
born out by it&rsquo;s many recent route announcements, including immediately 
countering AA&rsquo;s LAX &ndash; PVG (Shanghai) expansion. They are not about 
to let AA dilute their Shanghai business traffic unchallenged, which until now 
was routed thru SFO. Like it or not, this IS a NEW UNITED and it is coming out 
swinging. And sorry Dave. I always appreciate your insight.</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the compromised image, and would have liked to have

<p>C&rsquo;mon guys, this livery looks old and tired. I think United current 
color scheme is a illion times better. The CO livery looks like something from 
the 1980&prime;s. How can two companies not afford a graphic artist who can 
deliver something spectacular and agreeable?</p> </li>

<p>The truth&hellip;.If ya were pro CO before the merge you probably LIKE the 
20 year old &ldquo;NEW&rdquo; UA livery pictured here. Ironic&hellip;.IF CO had 
not turned down 1ST merge down when Houston based Bush was Pres. the NEW 
airline would be called Continental &amp; be BASED in Houston. Not in 
Chicago&hellip;NOW Pres.Obama&rsquo;s home town. DOH!!! &amp; DUH!!!!</p> </li>

<p>Ho hum&hellip;uninspired yet expedient decision to plow the merged carrier 
along. Something tells me this merger will be clumsy and poorly unified and 
branded. Just look at the miss match mess of (liveries) UA aircraft sitting on 
the ramp today. As a designer I have always felt the globe should have been 
reversed on the tail &ndash; with the No Pole flying forward with the direction 
of flight. But, since we&rsquo;re not the decision makers &ndash; let the 
public respond!</p> </li>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to have thoughts, likes, dislikes about the paint 
scheme it&rsquo;s quite another to disparage the Continental people and the 
service (our only reason to be in business). Those leaving negative comments 
must have short memories when 20 years ago Continentals service left much to be 
desired. A CEO named Gordon Bethune came along and gave the airline to the 
employees who took it from &ldquo;Worst to First&rdquo; where it remains today. 
The airline continues to win &ldquo;First&rdquo; awards all over the world. The 
New United marketing people know that the current Livery is connected to and 
reflects that winning attitude and service. It is critical to the success of 
the New United that the Continental service level becomes the norm everywhere 
the New United flies. If any of you are not onboard with that and the changes 
that are coming, now would be a good time to look for another place to work.</p>

<p>as long as everyone gets their $39 fare, who cares what the tail looks 
like&hellip;right?</p> 
<p>CAL was indeed the stronger carrier. Better fleet, better technology, 
better looking FAs (that didn&rsquo;t pose for the tail of Alaska&hellip;or 
Frontier), and they did it without liquidating pensions and laying off nearly 
18% of their pilots.</p> 
<p>UAL survives on legacy status, not performance. You get better service and 
smiles from the post-office.</p> 
<p>The livery says it all. Cheaper to paint united on the side than grind down 
that shit-grey-faded-oil-streaked mess of a fleet they maintained.</p> 
<p>dollars. just dollars.</p> 
<p>Glen&rsquo;s entire goal for the last decade was to dump the store. At 
least Jeff wants the appearance of making it work before he checks out a

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that the tulip is far more popular and reknowned 
then the weak Continental globe&hellip;I believe United is making a huge 
mistake&hellip;Hopefully, this is just a temporary scheme and Smisnek gets his 
ego out of his &lsquo;globe&rsquo; and creates a livery where all sides will be 
satisfied. The tulip is iconic and for years represented the great airline of 
United. The globe is Continental&rsquo;s pure a simple, how can anybody think 
otherwise..Can one imagine the CO globe logo on top of the Chicago United

<p>United should be happy the big banks and the Obama adminstration crammed 
this merger down CAL&rsquo;s throat. Continetal always planned to just wait 
until UAL went belly up (about 18 more months at the rate they were going) and 
then just buy the pieces that made sense. Now a truly winning team has got a 
giant sh*t sandwich that everyone&rsquo;s got to take a bite of&hellip;. United 
employees career expectation before the merger = ZERO,NULL,NADA,ZILCH.</p>
