<h2>Failed bail-out bad news for&nbsp;aviation</h2> September 29, 2008 5 
comments <br>

<p>The collapse of the $700 billion bailout of the US financial system is bad 
news for aviation.</p> 
<p>The capital markets were already driving up pricing on debt and driving out 
many lending institutions from the aviation market. Airbus and Boeing 
downplayed the declining credit markets (our conversations with them being 
about two weeks ago, before things really began to go south). Each believed 
that money to finance airplanes was available, albeit more expensive, and that 
neither would have to step up to provide backstop financing until the second 
half of next year. Part of this is the large segments of their respective order 
backlogs that are eligible for export credit financing backed by the European 
and US governments. In Boeing&rsquo;s case, the company has said on several 
occasions that about 83% of its backlog may be financed by the US Export-Import 
Bank. We don&rsquo;t have a figure for Airbus, but we believe that most of its 
backlog is similarly eligible for the European Credit Agency (ECA) financing.
</p> 
<p>Based on the information we had at the time, we generally agreed. But not 
now. ExIm or ECA or not, there still have to be viable banks and general market 
liquidity available for the credit agencies to provide guarantees for the 
funding.</p> 
<p>The situation has changed so dramatically in just the last seven days that 
we are now concerned there will quickly be a financing crisis for the airlines. 
In this respect, the airlines may just decide that the longer a Boeing strike 
the better.</p> 
<p>Our colleagues at <em>Commercial Aviation Online,</em> the finance-oriented 
publication of theFlight Global family, paints a dire picture emerging in 
aviation finance in our conversations with them. (We write for<em>CAO</em> as 
well.) But they are still constructing their stories, and we&rsquo;re obligated 
to me ambiguous at this stage. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a paid-subscription 
service, so while we&rsquo;ll be able to synopsize stories when the time comes, 
we won&rsquo;t&rsquo; be able to fully reproduce them here. But the bottom line 
is that things are going south faster than anyone believed in aviation finance.
</p> 
<p><strong>Update, September 30: Bloomberg News</strong> has this short item 
about customers for Embraer having difficulting financing the planes that were 
ordered. Brazil, like the US, Europe and Canada (for Bombardier), offers export 
financing support, too.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, 11:45 AM PDT</strong>: Commercial Aviation Online posted 
its story. (Paid subscription required.) Here are some excerpts:</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><em>With no US bailout package on the table, the aviation finance market 
remains frozen unable to make sound decisions in an uncertain climate.</em></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;Right now, there is no interbank lending and banks are hoarding 
cash. Most bankers are putting off any decisions because there are no good 
decisions right now,&rdquo; says a London-based banker.</em></p> 
<p><em>He adds: &ldquo;It is hard to say anything concrete right now except 
that if the current crisis continues, we are in big trouble. However, even with 
a US bailout don&rsquo;t expect a panacea. What we are seeing now is what 
happened to the Japanese banks. It will take five to ten years to get out of 
this mess.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><em>Due to uncertain market conditions, a number of aviation deals that are 
currently in the works are likely to be renegotiated.</em></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;No one wants a RFP right now. Everything is being delayed and 
many deals will have to be revisited,&rdquo; says another banker.</em></p>

<h2>Week 4: IAM-Boeing&nbsp;strike</h2> September 29, 2008 1 comment <br>

<p><strong>Update, October 2:</strong></p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a new twist. An Australian newspaper reports that Virgin Blue 
may seek damages from Boeing and the IAM over the strike-induced delays of the 
777s the airline wants. We think Boeing&rsquo;s customer contracts preclude 
strike-caused delays. The IAM liability, if any, is another matter.</p> 
<p><strong>September 29:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Seattle Times:</strong> Dominic Gates has this detailed analysis of 
the strike and its cost to both sides.</p> 
<p>One piece of math in the article that Dom didn&rsquo;t do is to present the 
daily cash drain for Boeing. Based on his information that the monthly cash 
cost is about $1.3 billion, this means the daily cash cost is about $43 
million. This compares with the widely reported figure of $100 million to $110 
million a day, which was actually deferred or &ldquo;lost&rdquo; revenue, but 
which is also quite a bit higher than it should be because these figures 
don&rsquo;t take into account the unaffected businesses within Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes that continue to produce revenue: Alteon (pilot training), 
Aviall (maintenance) and Jeppessen (maps and related stuff). We estimated that 
strike-related BCA revenue loss was more like $75 million to $83 million a day.
</p> 
<p>An IAM official predicted at the start of the strike that the IAM could 
bleed Boeing of its $10 billion in cash in a matter of a few months. Not 
hardly. Certainly $1.3 billion a month in cash loss is not chicken feed, but 
it&rsquo;s also only one-third of the widely quoted figures.</p> 
<p><strong>Everett Herald:</strong> The IAM&rsquo;s health benefits end Oct. 1
. Some inside Boeing told us they believe that this event will help trigger a 
settlement.</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: Boeing, IAM <br>

<h2>Politics continue on the&nbsp;tanker</h2> September 22, 2008 14 comments 
<br> 
<p>(Special projects precluded us from updating last week, so some of the 
links below backtrack into then.)</p> 
<p>Politics continue to plague the tanker program even though the Bush 
Administration has punted the decision to the next presidency. Today we play 
catch-up with selected stories of interest.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, September 26:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Inside Defense</strong> reports that US Rep. John Murtha (D-PA), 
chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee, says a split buy between 
Northrop and Boeing is the only way to recapitalize the USAF tanker program any 
time soon.</p> 
<p>Murtha generally has been supportive of Boeing&rsquo;s KC-767 tanker 
proposal.</p> 
<p>He&rsquo;s added language to the 2009 defense appropriations bill directing 
the DOD to study the feasibility of a split buy, Inside Defense reports. 
Murtha, according to the publication, acknowledged that Boeing and DOD 
don&rsquo;t like the idea and he didn&rsquo;t know if Northrop does, &ldquo;But 
let me tell you something, we&rsquo;re not going to have tankers if we 
don&rsquo;t do that, I&rsquo;m convinced,&rdquo; Inside Defense quotes Murtha 
as saying.</p> 
<p>Murtha predicted that in a re-compete, Northrop is likely to receive the 
order because its plane is ready to go.</p>

This article may be found here, with the registration process the first thing 
you will see.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, September 25:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Be careful what you ask for</strong>. US Rep. Norm Dicks 
(D-Boeing/Washington) announced that he&rsquo;s inserted language in a new 
House bill to require the USAF or DOD to review any adverse ruling from the 
World Trade Organization on the &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; subsidies complaints 
filed by the US Trade Representative and the European Union against Airbus and 
Boeing. He has said for years that Airbus received &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; 
subsidies and presumes the WTO will back up the USTR complaint. Most objective 
observers, including us, agree with his biased viewpoint on this one.</p> 
<p>But most objective observers, including us, also think the WTO will find 
Boeing received &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; subsidies as well&ndash;something Dicks 
and other Boeing supporters in Congress seem blind to.</p> 
<p>The full House has to approve Dicks&rsquo; language (likely) and then the 
Senate has to agree (unlikely).</p> 
<p>A decision by the WTO is overdue.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, September 24:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Mobile Press-Register</strong>: Gates against tanker split buy.</p> 
<p><strong>Aviation Week</strong>: DOD&rsquo;s Gates eyed changes to RFP 
before canceling contract.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>JD Crowe at The Mobile Press Register is at it again.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, September 23:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Associated Press</strong>: DOD Secretary Robert Gates says the next 
administration should buy the cheapest tanker.</p> 
<p><strong>Original post:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Washington Times</strong>: [Tanker] Rigged in Boeing&rsquo;s favor. 
US Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Northrop/Alabama) writes in an Op-Ed piece that 
DOD&rsquo;s decision punting the tanker to the next presidency was nothing more 
than a sop to Boeing.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>JD Crowe at Mobile Press-Register</p> 
<p><strong>Business Week</strong>: Boeing&rsquo;s CEO beat the Pentagon, but 
lost some, too. Boeing CEO Jim McNerney gambled in taking on the Pentagon over 
the tanker, and won.</p> 
<p><strong>Defense Industry Daily</strong>: A400M delays creating contract 
controversies. Airbus&rsquo; sole military program isn&rsquo;t going too well. 
(We count the KC-330 as a broader EADS program; the A400M is Airbus.)</p> 
<p><strong>Washington Post</strong>: Defense buyer says Northrop&rsquo;s bid 
was $3bn cheaper than Boeing. DOD&rsquo;s John Young said the smaller KC-767 
should have been cheaper to buy than Northrop&rsquo;s KC-30&ndash;but it 
wasn&rsquo;t. We say perhaps the US taxpayer was going to benefit after all 
from all those &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; subsidies alleged to be provided to Airbus.

<h2>Week 3, IAM-Boeing&nbsp;strike</h2> September 22, 2008 1 comment <br>

<p>Boeing and the IAM entered the third week of the strike last Saturday and 
there is no sign of any progress. As of last week, the two sides weren&rsquo;t 
even talking about talking.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, September 24:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</strong>: Columnist Bill Virgin has an 
interesting piece speculating what happens to Boeing in the Puget Sound 
(Seattle) region when the strike is over.</p> 
<p><strong>Reuters</strong>: Boeing CEO calls IAM strike a 
&ldquo;standstill.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Bloomberg</strong>: Boeing CEO cites economic downturn, sees risk 
to backlog and need for Boeing to finance customers. There is also some 
reporting on the IAM &ldquo;standstill.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Original Posting</strong>:</p> 
<p>We spoke with the IAM and Boeing and each side is waiting for the other to 
pick up the phone and ask to talk. The mediator is staying in touch with each 
side, but there&rsquo;s little for him to do as present.</p> 
<p>Boeing insists that the IAM narrow down its &ldquo;wants&rdquo; to two or 
three items from the three pages presented at the last-ditch Florida talks 
immediately preceding the walk-out. For the IAM, it&rsquo;s not that simple and 
without resolving the list of issues, these elements would become part of a 
contract.</p> 
<p>We remain pessemistic about any early settlement.</p> Categories: Boeing

<h2>Boeing stock down in ILFC&nbsp;issues</h2> September 17, 2008 Leave a 
comment <br>

<p>As any aviation advocate knows, the future of International Lease Finance 
Corp. is uncertain due to the problems at its parent, AIG. The US government 
has bailed out AIG for $85 billion (which would fund the acquisition of 360 
USAF tankers, BTW, but that&rsquo;s a different issue) and plans to have an 
orderly sale of AIG assets.</p> 
<p>ILFC&rsquo;s CEO and founder, Steven Udvar-Hazy, is trying to arrange 
financing to buy the company back from AIG, which bought it from Hazy and his 
co-founders in 1990.</p> 
<p>Today, Boeing stock is down on fears ILFC&rsquo;s troubles will lead ILFC 
to cancel orders for 74 787s and some 30 737s. (Disclosure: we have a long-term 
holding in Boeing stock.)</p> 
<p>We don&rsquo;t think that will happen and we believe the stock market is 
off base on this one.</p> 
<p>The orders, especially for the 787, are a great asset for ILFC and will be 
an important part of any sale of the company. Furthermore, even if ILFC were to 
cancel, other lessors and airlines will snap up these positions, resulting in 
no net loss in orders for Boeing.</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: 787, Boeing, ILFC

<h2>What now for the&nbsp;tanker?</h2> September 16, 2008 3 comments <br>

<p> </p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>In today&rsquo;s column we discuss the tanker, how much the IAM 
strike is costing Boeing every day and how long the strike may last.</strong>
</p> 
<p>Out of all the twists and turns in the seven year old effort to replace 
aging Boeing KC-135 aerial tankers, no one we spoke with predicted that the 
Department of Defense last week would dump the entire competition in the trash 
can. What happens next and what are the ramifications for Northrop, EADS, 
Boeing and the Air Force?</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>A full re-start by the Air Force/DOD on the competition will probably take 
anywhere from two-four years before a new contract is awarded. There would have 
to be a full reassessment by the Joint Requirement Oversight Council (JROC) and 
the Request for Information (RFI) process; the Defense Acquisition Board 
reviews and approval of the Request for Proposal; determination of the Source 
Selection Authority; and the actual evaluation process. Plus any additional 
appeals of the decision.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Could the new Administration, whether it is McCain or Obama, simply pick up 
more or less where the Bush Administration left off? We suppose that in theory 
it could but in practice it&rsquo;s unlikely. Boeing has been very clear that 
it views any changed to the specifications for a larger airplane as requiring a 
compete re-start, and having won its political point and getting DOD Secretary 
Robert Gates to cancel the Northrop Grumman award, Boeing and its supporters 
are hardly likely to support anything absent a full do-over.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In the meantime, in what is a reversal of rhetoric by Boeing and DOD, both 
now take the position that the aging KC-135 tankers are good enough to last 
while the competition is re-run. Throughout the competition both originally 
took the position that there was great urgency to proceed with the tanker 
replacement program because the KC-135s were essentially ready to fall out of 
the sky. (A separate government-funded study took a different view, arguing 
there was plenty of life left in the airplanes.) After Boeing protested the 
Northrop award, Boeing&rsquo;s spin shifted to &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the hurry? 
There&rsquo;s plenty of life left in the KC-135s.&rdquo; Boeing ought to know; 
it also has the maintenance contract on the KC-135 fleet.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Be that as it may, who are the winners and losers in the decision by 
Secretary Gates to punt this to the next Administration? Here&rsquo;s our take:
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Winners</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Boeing, its lobbying efforts, its Congressional supporters and 
Boeing&rsquo;s labor unions.</strong> Boeing&rsquo;s incredibly effective 
lobbying campaign certainly won the battle. But will it cost Boeing in the 
coming war? See Potential Losers.</li> 
<li><strong>Boeing</strong>, also because it gets a third shot at the tanker 
contract in what will be Round 4 of the process (including the abortive re-bid 
that was just ash-canned).</li> 
<li><strong>Boeing, </strong>because plans by Airbus to build the A330-200F in 
US-dollar based Alabama are put on hold. This will keep pressure on Airbus for 
the Euro-dollar exchange rate and complicates Airbus&rsquo; decisions over 
production for the A350.</li> 
<li><strong>Washington</strong><strong> State and Kansas. </strong>The KC-767, 
or if Boeing elects to offer a KC-777 and should it be selected, will be built 
in Washington and modified in Kansas. Gates&rsquo; decision keeps them in the 
game.</li> 
<li><strong>The Taxpayers</strong>, if you believe Boeing&rsquo;s assertions 
that Northrop&rsquo;s KC-30 is too big, too costly, and will (essentially) 
bankrupt the USAF in 40-year life-cycle operating costs. (OK, Boeing 
didn&rsquo;t actually make the bankruptcy claim but you get the drift.) Read

<h2>Week 2, IAM-Boeing&nbsp;strike</h2> September 13, 2008 1 comment <br>

<p>As the Boeing strike enters Week 2, we continue our &ldquo;media 
watch&rdquo; for continuing coverage.</p> 
<p><strong>September 14:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Seattle Post-Intelligencer:</strong> BCA President Scott Carson 
hopes talks will resume in a &ldquo;couple of weeks&rdquo; and a settlement 
will come shortly thereafter. The P-I&rsquo;s James Wallace also has a Q&amp;A 
with Carson.</p> 
<p><strong>Reuters</strong>: Boeing&rsquo;s CEO gambles on strike.</p> 
<p><strong>September 13:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Forbes</strong>: Analyst predicts additional 3-6 mo 787 delay 
before the strike. The headline of the story is about the strike lowering 
demand for titanium. Yeah, fine. What caught our eye is the additional delay in 
the program. Boeing CFO James Bell told a Morgan Stanley conference the program 
delay should be one day-for-one day. Which means either others are looking for 
a long strike (we only hear 4-6 weeks and Bell would be happy with only a 
month) or there are deeper issues in the 787 program.</p>

<h2>Boeing speaks to Morgan&nbsp;Stanley</h2> September 10, 2008 1 comment <br>
<p>The Boeing Chief Financial Officer spoke to the Morgan Stanley conference 
September 10. James Bell is the presenter. Highlights as the presentation 
proceeds:</p> 
<p>(Unless there are quotation marks indicating a direct quote, Bell&rsquo;s 
comments are paraphrased as we took notes in real time during the presentation.)
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bell reiterates Boeing&rsquo;s best offer to the IAM.</li> 
<li>He is concerned about the cancellation of the tanker competition but 
Boeing needs time to prepare proper bid.</li> 
<li>Outsourcing is major concern with the IAM strike. &ldquo;We are in sort of 
a cooling off period,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always had language in 
the contract that gives them the opportunity to bid for work. We need to make 
sure we have process in place&rdquo; to outsource work, support our marketing 
efforts. A lot of the backlog we have for orders is supported by the ability to 
share the work in other countries.</li> 
<li>Backlog remains solid because traffic remains essentially strong. 
&ldquo;We are really feeling comfortable&rdquo; due to diversity in backlog 
around the world. &ldquo;We have looked at it, we&rsquo;ve seen it,&rdquo; and 
have not had more than normal kind of deferrals and cancellations. &ldquo;That 
doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;re not concerned about it, or looking at it,&rdquo; 
but right now 80% of our backlog is ExIm financable.&rdquo; Only 3% of our 
backlog has been financed by Boeing.</li> 
<li>Question: What are the sticking points, are you at an impasse. Bell: We 
are not at a complete impasse. They want all the work done there, which 
isn&rsquo;t practical, and we want flexibility and we&rsquo;ll come in between. 
But that&rsquo;s not the only issue we&rsquo;re apart on. We are going to 
retain our ability to be competitive.</li> 
<li>How long for the strike before delivery of 787 slips to 2010? Bell: 
doesn&rsquo;t give a timeline. (Later says one-for-one for every day there is a 
strike.)</li> 
<li>Delay on the 787: Bell says we are not overly concerned about growth in 
costs vs escalation costs in contracts, but will have to negotiate with 
customers on payments that might cover the costs. Productivity efficiencies 
will be important to keep costs down. Initial deliveries (undefined) will be at 
zero profit (doesn&rsquo;t quantify what a loss per plane might be).</li> 
<li>We have a pretty good model for 1,000 planes about what the pricing ought 
to be and we have a pretty good idea what the costs will be for costs and 
we&rsquo;re getting a pretty good idea what the penalties will be, and [all-in] 
I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what that will be. There is significant profit 
to accommodate all the costs.</li> 
<li>My basic understanding on tanker is that the DOD has canceled the contract 
and there will be a new RFP issued. We may offer the same airplane or something 
new depending on what the requirements are.</li> 
<li>Right now there is a one-for-one (day-for-day) slip on the 787 and all 
other programs due to the strike.</li> 
<li>Boeing&rsquo;s IDS defense division is avoiding bidding on fixed price 
contracts going forward.</li> 
<li>We have been preparing for the possibility that we will have to help our 
(US) domestic customers (for financing) but the reality is we haven&rsquo;t had 
to. There is enough liquidity in the market. Customers are able to get better 
deals out of the market than Boeing&rsquo;s backstop financing.</li> 
<li>The A350-1000 challenge to the 777: We will respond when we know what it 
is. A350 looks good on paper and we have the resources to invest the R&amp;D 
necessary to respond [with a refresh or a new airplane]. We&rsquo;re not going 
to jump out in front of it until it gets finalized.</li> 
<li>737 replacement: We&rsquo;re looking at the end of the next decade, and 
the key is to have technology to get improvements. Composites don&rsquo;t scale 
down as well as they scale up. It could be a small twin-aisle. Engine 
technology needed. I don&rsquo;t think the CSeries will change dynamics that 
materially, engine technology could, but issue is reliability. We&rsquo;re all 
excited by the Geared Turbo Fan but question is whether it will have 
reliability to give advances required for a new airplane.</li> 
<li>DOD has actually canceled this procurement and this means an entirely new 
RFP. This is an important distinction from merely postponing the competition 
from the Bush Administration to the next Administration.</li> 
<li>Bell predicts the strike will last at least a month.<strong><br>

<p><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> reports the Department of Defense 
has canceled the competition for the KC-X tanker. The report:</p> 
<p><em>The Pentagon cancels tanker competition, saying it&rsquo;s impossible 
to pick a winner by January. The Department of Defense is expected to notify

<p>This is another stunning twist in the tanker saga. More news to come.</p> 
<p><strong>DOD Buzz</strong> has this piece.</p> 
<p><strong>Our take</strong>: We agreed with Boeing that six months was 
reasonable to do the re-bid, but we don&rsquo;t know why the analysis could not 
have transcended administrations. Although the top leadership at the Pentagon 
might change (even though there has been plenty of speculation that DOD 
Secretary could stay on, no matter whether McCain or Obama is elected), 
presumably the evaluators would not change&ndash;only the deciders. This 
development is not good news.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 10:45 AM PDT</strong>: Here is the statement by Defense 
Secretary Robert Gates:</p> <em>DoD Announces Termination of KC-X Tanker 
Solicitation</em> 
<p><em><br>
</em></p> <em> Today, the Department of Defense notified the 
Congress and the two competing contractors, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, that 
it is terminating the current competition for a U.S. Air Force airborne tanker 
replacement.</em> <em> </em> <em> Secretary Gates, in consultation with senior 
Defense and Air Force officials, has determined that the solicitation and award 
cannot be accomplished by January.&nbsp;Rather than hand the next 
Administration an incomplete and possibly contested process, Secretary Gates 
decided that the best course of action is to provide the next Administration 
with full flexibility regarding the requirements, evaluation criteria and the 
appropriate allocation of defense budget to this mission.</em> <em> </em> <em> 
Secretary Gates stated, &ldquo;Over the past seven years the process has become 
enormously complex and emotional &ndash; in no small part because of mistakes 
and missteps along the way by the Department of Defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my 
judgment that in the time remaining to us, we can no longer complete a 
competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged 
environment.&nbsp;The resulting &ldquo;cooling off&rdquo; period will allow the 
next Administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a 
new acquisition strategy for the KC-X.&rdquo;</em> <em> </em> <em> In making 
this decision, it was concluded that the current KC-135 fleet can be adequately 
maintained to satisfy Air Force missions for the near future.&nbsp;Sufficient 
funds will be recommended in the FY09 and follow-on budgets to maintain the 
KC-135 at high-mission capable rates.&nbsp;In addition, the Department will 
recommend to the Congress the disposition of the pending FY09 funding for the 
tanker program and plans to continue funding the KC-X program in the FY10 to 
FY15 budget presently under review.</em> <br>
