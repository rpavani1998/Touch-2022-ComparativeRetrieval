<h2>Boeing refreshes&nbsp;737</h2> April 30, 2009 Leave a comment <br>

<p>Here are our stories from Commercial Aviation Online about the Boeing 737 
refresh.</p> 
<p>The stories speak for themselves, and one of them gives the reaction of 
Southwest Airlines, Boeing&rsquo;s biggest 737 customer.</p> 
<p>Our personal observations: the new interior, with 787 features, is a major 
improvement over those in today&rsquo;s 737s (and Airbus A320s) from a 
passenger perspective. Boeing wasn&rsquo;t able to increase passenger shoulder 
width comfort because the fuselage width is what it is, but there is more 
headroom space with the redesigned bins and the lighting is much more pleasant.
</p> 
<p>The 737&prime;s aerodynamics were pretty clean to begin with, so getting a 
1% airframe gain in fuel burn was probably about as good as could be expected. 
CFM likewise has a pretty efficient CFM 56, so another 1% was probably as good 
as it gets, too.</p> 
<p>This illustrates the challenges Boeing has in tweaking the 737 without a 
re-engining before going to an all-new airplane. Airbus is hoping for up to 5% 
fuel burn improvements for the A320 Enhancements, but Boeing told us some time 
ago these would only at best match the 737 and not better it (Airbus probably 
would take a different view).</p> 
<p>Anyway, here are the stories we did for CAO.</p>

<h2>Tankers: to split or not to&nbsp;split</h2> April 30, 2009 2 comments <br>

<p><strong>Update, May 4</strong>: Veto threat over split tanker effort: read 
all about it.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, May 3:</strong></p> 
<p>US Rep. John Murtha (D-PA), chair of a House appropriations committee, has 
dropped (for the moment) his effort to insert into the FY2010 budget language 
requiring a split buy between Boeing and Northrop for the KC-X tanker.See this 
story.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Well, blow us down. Loren Thompson, the defense analyst, now favors a split 
buy.</p> 
<p>He&rsquo;s been all over the map on this procurement. A big defender of the 
Boeing KC-767 lease deal when that was on the table. For the KC-767 vs. the 
Northrop KC-30.&nbsp; Defending the KC-30 award after it was given. Supporting 
the Boeing protest. Now this.</p> 
<p>Followers (including this column) of Thompson, who is quoted frequently as 
a defense expert, respect his thinking but can&rsquo;t help be a little baffled 
on this program.</p> 
<p>Thompson&rsquo;s rationale is what we&rsquo;ve been advocating since we 
began following the competition several years ago: split the buy for 
operational reasons. The two tankers are differently sized: some missions are 
better suited for the KC-767 and some are better suited for the KC-30. Double 
the procurement, retire the old KC-135s more quickly.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, US Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Boeing/WA), claims he was quoted 
out of context by KIRO TV a while back, which reported Dicks could &ldquo;live 
with&rdquo; a split buy. NowDicks is back on his sole-source band wagon (for 
Boeing), even thoughBoeing now is fine with the idea.</p> 
<p>And now, a plug for our Eco-Aviation conference. More information may be 
found here.</p>

<h2>Replacing the A320,&nbsp;737</h2> April 28, 2009 3 comments <br>

<p>We attended the joint anouncement April 28 by Boeing and CFM International 
for the enhancements to the 737NG, something we had forecast in an article for 
Aviation and the Environment magazineway back in December. Except for the 
possibility of re-engining the 737 with the Pratt &amp; Whitney Geared Turbo 
Fan (a prospect that was only evaluated and not forecast in our AE piece), we 
were right on the money.</p>

<h2>Production assessment, Round&nbsp;3</h2> April 23, 2009 1 comment <br>

<p>Some interesting items came out of the Boeings 1Q09 earnings call yesterday 
(April 22) with regard to production and deferrals.</p> 
<p>Oversales of the 737 have been a key element in Boeing being able to 
maintain current production levels of 31/mo, despite the global recession. As 
was previously acknowledged by Boeing, 2009 737 oversales were about 100. On 
the year-end 2008 earnings call in January, CEO Jim McNerney acknowledged that 
oversales for 2009 had been reduced to about 15% over the production (which 
mathematically equated to about 55-56 737s).</p>

<h2>Boeing will leave Seattle:&nbsp;prediction</h2> April 22, 2009 14 comments 
<br> 
<p><strong>Update, April 27</strong>: It has been pointed out to us that The 
Everett Herald wrote that we advocated changing and cutting unemployment 
insurance and taxes during our speech to the Economic Development Council of 
Snohomish County. This is not correct. We took no position on the then-pending 
legislation in Washington State. What we did say is that we agreed with County 
Executive Aaron Reardon&rsquo;s characterization that a change by the 
Legislature in 2005 to the 2003 Boeing 787 incentive plan was 
&ldquo;bait-and-switch.&rdquo; This concurrence apparently led the paper to 
conclude we supported the change proposed this year.</p> 
<p>The Washington State Labor Council wrote us with this information about the 
2005 change:</p>  EHB 2255 was&nbsp;the bill in 2005 that restored UI benefits 
from four-quarter averaging (which it was changed to as part of the 2003 7E7 
incentive package, a significant cut of up to $200/week for some workers) back 
to two-quarter averaging where it was prior to 2003.&nbsp; There was only one 
business in Washington that testified in support of this restoration of 
benefits.&nbsp; It was BOEING.&nbsp; Bob Watt.&nbsp; Check it out (under 
&ldquo;pro&rdquo;) right here:

<br> 
<p><strong>Update, April 24:</strong> Bryan Corliss wrote a five page article 
for the May issue of Seattle Business Monthly that just hit the web. The 
article, entitled&ldquo;Boeing, Boeing&hellip;Gone,&rdquo; is an excellent 
analysis of the current state of affairs in the perennial controversy over the 
issues involved in Boeing staying in Puget Sound or moving elsewhere. We knew 
he was working on a piece&ndash;we&rsquo;re quoted extensively in it&ndash;but 
did not know who else he was talking to. We note that other observers touched 
on virtually the identical points and came to the identical conclusions we 
discussed in our EDC presentation below. Corliss knows Boeing as well as any 
local reporter. He covered the company for years for The Everett Herald, 
leaving when he obtained a fellowship at New York&rsquo;s Columbia University. 
Michelle Dunlop succeeded Corliss, who returned to the Seattle area after 
conclusion of his Columbia work to resume his coverage of Boeing for other 
publications.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, April 23:</strong> Michelle Dunlop of The Everett Herald, 
in her reporting of our EDC appearance, inserted this little reminder:</p> 
<p><em>Last fall, during the Machinists&rsquo; strike, analyst Richard 
Aboulafia, with the Teal Group, predicted a Boeing exodus over the next decade.
</em></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;Over the next 10 years, (Boeing Commercial Airplanes) will move 
to southern states with weaker unions and right-to-work laws that diminish 
union power,&rdquo; Aboulafia wrote in a briefing. &ldquo;This move will likely 
happen in phases, with new programs &hellip; established elsewhere and the 787 
line shifting locations.&rdquo;</em></p> 
<p><strong>Update, 3:00 PM:</strong> In response to an analyst question on the 
Boeing earnings call, CEO Jim McNerney said a decision on ramping up 787 
production beyond the goal of 10/mo (ie, this effectively means a second 
production line) will be made about a year from now.</p> 
<p><strong>Note: This is a 2,400 word report.</strong></p> 
<p>We were the speaker today (April 22) at a meeting of the Economic 
Development Council of Snohomish County, which is the county in Washington 
State where Boeing&rsquo;s Everett wide-body production facility is located.</p>
<p>The meeting was scheduled before a flurry of press activity following the 
unauthorized release ofa study by Deloitte Consulting about Washington&rsquo;s 
aerospace competitiveness anda second study about Boeing&rsquo;s impact on the 
Puget Sound (the greater Seattle area) economy. The second study was by the 
Washington Research Council (WRC).</p> 
<p>The Deloitte study concluded Washington is not competitive with Texas, 
Kansas and some other Southern states due to its business climate deficiencies, 
labor issues and other factors. The Washington State Labor Council and the 
national headquarters of the International Association of Machinists (IAM local 
751 represents thousands of Boeing workers in Puget Sound) dismissed the 
veracity of the Deloitte study because Deloitte has done work for Boeing in the 
past.</p> 
<p>The validity of the WRC study was discounted by a close observer of Boeing 
because WRC officials have previous connections to Boeing.</p> 
<p>Our view on the two studies is this: we don&rsquo;t really care whether 
Deloitte has done work for Boeing in the past or not, or if some Boeing talking 
points were included in the study (which, generally, seems to be true). The 
underlying thesis that Washington hasn&rsquo;t attracted significant new 
aerospace business is indisputably true and most if not all of the statistical 
data comparing states-to-states is publicly available. (How this is interpreted 
may be a different and legitimate issue of debate.)</p> 
<p>Bottom line: there is something wrong in Washington where new business 
avoids this state.</p> 
<p>As for the WRC study, the conclusions contained therein are probably sound. 
Whether this study, or the Deloitte report, are orchestrated efforts by Boeing 
to send a message to the Legislature is hardly the point. There is a problem (a 
challenging business climate), solutions need to be found or there could be 
ramifications (the prospect of Boeing leaving Puget Sound in whole or in part). 
The nature of the solutions are the proverbial devil in the details.</p>

<h2>Ahead of Boeing&nbsp;earnings</h2> April 21, 2009 1 comment <br>

<p><strong>Update, April 22:</strong></p> 
<p>Here is the link to Boeing&rsquo;s 1Q09 earnings. Here is the link to the 
1Q09 PDF slide show that goes with the earnings.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Tomorrow (April 22) is the release of Boeing&rsquo;s 1Q09 earnings. Here 
are some thoughts ahead of the release.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not look for any announcement on rate reductions of the 737. Boeing 
previously announced reductions of the 777 line and freezing rates of the 747 
and 767 lines. There continues to be a lot of speculation that the 737 rate 
will be reduced soon. Whether it is or isn&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t expect any 
announcement tomorrow. Someone will try to get guidance about 2010 rates.</li> 
<li>There continues to be speculation that Boeing Capital Corp. will have to 
do more customer financing ($1bn) than has previously been announced. As of 
this moment, we don&rsquo;t expect anything new on this front, either. There 
ought to be discussion about the 2009 funding gap and how funding is beginning 
to look in 2010.Read more&hellip;</li> </ul> Categories: Boeing Tags: Boeing,

<h2>More on the funding&nbsp;gap</h2> April 21, 2009 Leave a comment <br>

<p>A Calyon bank official said at the annual Airfinance Journal conference 
that Airbus and Boeing may have to increase funding more than the companies 
expected this year because the funding gap is larger than thought.This 
Bloomberg story has the details.</p> 
<p>Calyon has been one of the most active lenders worldwide.</p>

<h2>Gates on split tanker buy: over my dead&nbsp;body</h2> April 20, 2009 1 
comment <br>

<p>US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said there will be a split buy on the 
KC-X tanker program over his dead body.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m laying my body down across the tracks,&rdquo; Aviation 
Week quotes as saying inthis short article.</p>

<h2>American&rsquo;s 787&nbsp;deal</h2> April 16, 2009 4 comments <br>

<p>American Airlines revealed the following in its 10Q quarterly report about 
the provisional order with Boeing for the 787:</p> 
<p>In 2008, the Company entered into a new purchase agreement with Boeing for 
the acquisition of 42 Boeing 787-9 aircraft.&nbsp; Per the purchase agreement, 
and before delays due to the recent Boeing strike as discussed below, the first 
such aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2012, and the last is scheduled 
to be delivered in 2018. The agreement also includes purchase rights to acquire 
up to 58 additional Boeing 787 aircraft, with deliveries between 2015 and 
2020.&nbsp; Based on preliminary information received from Boeing on the impact 
of the overall Boeing 787 program delay to American&rsquo;s delivery positions 
due to the strike in 2008, the Company</p>
