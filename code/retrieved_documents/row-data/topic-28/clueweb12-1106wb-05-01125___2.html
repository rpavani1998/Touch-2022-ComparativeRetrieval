<h2>Boeing wide-open on 777 future:&nbsp;Albaugh</h2> July 27, 2010 73 comments
<br> 
<p><strong>Update, Aug. 1</strong>: Dominic Gates&nbsp; of <em>The Seattle 
Times</em> has a long article with the views on the 777 successor from Tim 
Clark, CEO of Emirates Airlines&ndash;which operates more 777s than any other 
airlines.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Boeing has a wide-open mind about how to meet the competition coming from 
the Airbus 350-1000 to its 777-300ER, says Jim Albaugh, president of Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes.</p> 
<p>The possibilities include and entirely new aircraft; re-winging the -300ER; 
putting new engines on; and putting a composite fuselage on the airplane.</p> 
<p>The latter point is a bit of an eyebrow-raiser. Reskinning the 777 would be 
a massive undertaking and essentially amount to an entirely new airplane.</p>

<h2>Farnborough: Odds and&nbsp;Ends</h2> July 22, 2010 6 comments <br>

<p><strong>Best One-Liner:</strong></p> 
<p>Airbus&rsquo; John Leahy is famous for his witty one-liners, but the best 
one at the show goes to Boeing&rsquo;s Randy Tinseth. As we were waiting for 
the Boeing press briefing to begin on Day 1, we remarked how dirty the Airbus 
A380 test plane was. A regular at air shows, the plane was parked right outside 
the media center. It clearly hadn&rsquo;t been scrubbed down for looks, with 
dirt streaks all over the fuselage. The logos of the A380 customers at the 
front of the airplane were equally covered in dirt. It stood in sharp contrast 
to the new Boeing 787 parked just yards away from the A380, in its shiney white 
paint.</p> 
<p>Said Tinseth, virtually giggling: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t wash it because 
they&rsquo;re afraid one of the logos will come off,&rdquo; suggesting a 
cancellation. &ldquo;And you can quote me on that.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>We told the story to one of Airbus&rsquo; top PR people, who grudgenly 
acknowleged it was a great line. No slouch himself, he retorted the 787 was so 
clean because it hasn&rsquo;t flown much.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Thursday</h2> July 22, 2010 3 comments <br>

<p>For all practical purposes for commercial aviation geeks, the air show is 
over. Even John Leahy left.</p> 
<p>There was one significant order today, from Virgin America for 40+20 Airbus 
A320s with options to convert to A321 and to use sharklets.</p> 
<p>Boeing announced a minor order swap involving three airplanes. Bombardier 
didn&rsquo;t announce any CSeries orders, but then, we knew by July 12 this was 
unlikely.</p> 
<p>Below are the orders through Day 4, minus a couple of minor ones due after 
we left the field to wrap up our reporting before going home. Over the course 
of the next week or so, we&rsquo;ll pick write some additional stuff.</p>

<h2>Tanker face off at&nbsp;Farnborough</h2> July 20, 2010 63 comments <br>

<p>Boeing and EADS held tanker briefings this week&ndash;Monday for Boeing, 
Tuesday for EADS.</p> 
<p>Boeing offered up top program officials while EADS offered up two American 
crewmen from its test flight program, a pilot and a boom operator. 
Boeing&rsquo;s briefing was a standard presentation followed by Q&amp;A; most 
of the briefing was taken up by the formal presentation.</p> 
<p>EADS was an interactive briefing with reporters after a few brief remarks, 
with nearly the entire session devoted to Q&amp;A.</p>

<p><strong>Updated, Wednesday 05:00 BST</strong></p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve updated this posting after all the text with orders completed 
through Day 2,</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Tuesday will be another day where orders are expected to be announced. See 
our Monday posting, updated at 4pm for this information.</p> 
<p><strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney</strong></p> 
<p>We will be attending a breakfast hosted by Pratt &amp; Whitney; perhaps we 
can get some information about the issues Qatar reports in connection with its 
potential CSeries order. Or perhaps not. OEMs are loath to talk about 
customers. But we shall see.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Monday</h2> July 18, 2010 12 comments <br>

<p><strong>Updates throughout the post, 415PM BST.</strong></p> 
<p>Here is a look ahead for Monday at the Farnborough Air Show and what might 
be expected for news and orders in the coming week. We&rsquo;ll update this 
post at the end of the day.</p> 
<p><strong>Airbus</strong></p> 
<p>John Leahy on Saturday predicted at least 130 orders will be announced this 
week. Boeing thinks that if Leahy is predicting 130, he&rsquo;s got a lot more 
up his sleeve. Leahy also predicted orders from leasing companies, signaling 
improving economies. See individual companies below.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Sunday-Boeing</h2> July 18, 2010 5 comments <br>

<p>The Boeing 787 arrived today at the Farnborough Air Show, a day before the 
event actually begins.</p> 
<p>The plane, #3&ndash;the so-called &ldquo;interior airplane&rdquo; equipped 
with an interior that is more suitable for testing operations than 
representative of the actual 787 customer interior&ndash;arrived at 9 am UK 
time, after a 9 hour flight from Paine Field at Everett (WA). At least 100 
people lined Farnborough Road adjacent the airport with binoculars and 
telephoto cameras to watch the landing.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Sunday-EADS</h2> July 17, 2010 Leave a comment <br>

<p>We&rsquo;re at the Farnborough Air Show and on Saturday attended the 
day-long EADS media briefings. We filed reports exclusively for KIRO TV (CBS) 
in Seattle. These stories are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Airbus predicts 130+ orders at the air show;</li> 
<li>Leahy says Airbus has to get current programs right before proceding with 
decision whether to re-engine the A320 family; decision due in 4th quarter;</li>
<li>Boeing Defense facing growing competition from EADS;</li> 
<li>EADS sees &ldquo;fair and open&rdquo; competition for KC-X;</li> 
<li>EADS chief raps &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; WTO.</li> </ul> 
<p>These stories are below the jump.</p> 
<p>Separately, word leaked from Farnborough that Boeing will get an order fo 
20 777s, but this is a swap from the failing DAE Capital of Dubai.Here is this 
story.</p>

<h2>Thursday&rsquo;s Farnborough&nbsp;impressions</h2> July 17, 2008 2 comments
<br> 
<p>Airbus had its press briefing, rescheduled from Monday, much to the 
puzzlement and speculation of observers and rivals (or, perhaps, that should be 
in the singular).</p> 
<p>The speculation was rife: Airbus&rsquo; super-salesman John Leahy had a big 
order up his sleeve for announcement. British Airways would announce an 
A350-1000 order. Cathay Pacific Airways would order the A380 and A350.</p> 
<p>Alas, it was none of these. CEO Thomas Enders started the briefing saying 
that he thought it be more productive for Airbus to recap the week, with orders 
to talk about, than to start the week with nothing to say. And that&rsquo;s 
what it was.</p> 
<p>Airbus ended the week with 247 firm orders plus commitments for nine 
airplanes. One hundred of the orders, however, are left over from the Dubai Air 
Show&ndash;the contract was signed at Farnborough, but these can&rsquo;t truly 
be considered a part of this air show.</p> 
<p>The breakdown is 128 A320s (70 from Dubai); 11 A330s; 98 A350s (30 from 
Dubai); and 10 A380s, though four of these were ordered instead of the carrier 
taking four test airplanes, so this is only a net gain of six.</p> 
<p>The A350 program has now sold 472 firm orders, a rate Leahy and the 
statistics say is faster than the Boeing 787.</p> 
<p>This tally is also Airbus&rsquo; second best Farnborough Air Show, 
following the one two years ago when 280 orders were announced.</p> 
<p>Other highlights from the Airbus conference:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Airbus is looking at developing a freighter for the A330-300, with a 
decision perhaps 6-12 months out;</li> 
<li>The company is spending about $160 million annually (at current Euro 
exchange rates) on research to enhance the A320 between now and a replacement 
airplane, involving weight savings, new interiors and a soon-to-be-tested 
blended winglet developed by Aviation Partners;</li> 
<li>Application of the new P&amp;W Geared Turbo Fan on the A320, once rejected 
by Leahy, may be a possibility after all, depending on customer demand and the 
outcome of test flights of the GTF on the A340 test bed;</li> 
<li>The A350 is essentially sold out through 2017, which parenthetically is 
also about the same time as the 787; and</li> 
<li>3,000 aircraft flying today are 20 or more years old; in five years, this 
number will double.</li> </ul> 
<p>Tom Williams, EVP-Head of Programs, called Bombardier&rsquo;s launch of the 
CSeries a &ldquo;brave thing.&rdquo; He believes the plane will be seen as an 
interim plane, bypassed by the next generation of single-aisle aircraft, 
serving a niche market that he believes is much smaller than Bombardier 
forecasts; that it will be an orphan aircraft, without a family to buy 
&ldquo;up&rdquo; to; and it will enter the low-end of the Boeing and Airbus 
markets.</p> 
<p>Airbus&rsquo; end-of-show brief was a very useful wrap; Boeing might want 
to follow suit at future shows. This timing by default gives Airbus the 
headlines as the show wraps.</p> 
<p><strong>Other stuff, mostly whimsical:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Every time a military jet fighter or bomber throttled up for take-off, car 
alarms up and down the nearby parking lot went off;</li> 
<li>&ldquo;Green&rdquo; aviation was a theme through the air show, right down 
to the notices on the waste bins to recycle. Maybe they do things differently 
in Europe than in the US, but there were no separate bins for plastic bottles, 
newspapers, and trash like back home;</li> 
<li>At a big 2 1/2 hour press conference on Green aviation where Boeing 
Commercial President Scott Carson and Airbus CEO Tom Enders were featured 
speakers, Boeing didn&rsquo;t have hand-outs of Carson&rsquo;s speech&ndash;not 
even on flash drive&ndash;while the Airbus flash drive was packaged in an 
oversized, non-recyclable box with non-recyclable plastic neatly holding the 
drive;</li> 
<li>At the same eco-conference, an engineer for Rolls-Royce engines 
couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to work his Power Point presentation;</li> 
<li>Boeing had a very classy eco-aviation center;</li> 
<li>BAE Systems had perhaps the most interesting aircraft display, an indoor 
retrospective of aviation pioneers with replicas of several wood-and-wire era 
bi-planes; and</li> 
<li>Reporters still rate the Airbus media chalet lunch menu the best-of-show, 
an important item considering most journalists are moochers; Boeing had a good 
cut fruit tray, though, something Airbus should do next time.</li> </ul>

<h2>Tuesday&rsquo;s Farnborough&nbsp;impressions</h2> July 15, 2008 2 comments

<p>It&rsquo;s a quiet show; few orders. One of the biggest, from Dubai 
Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), signed a contract with Airbus for 100 planes was 
merely confirming the order announced last November at the Dubai Air Show. Now 
these orders can finally be booked at Airbus and on its website.</p> 
<p>DAE&rsquo;s order for 100 Boeing airplanes, also announced at the Dubai 
show, was inked before the end of last year and booked in Boeing&rsquo;s 2007 
numbers.</p> 
<p>Reporters are largely bored this year. This item for MarketWatch pretty 
well sums it up.</p> 
<p>Jon Ostrower from Flightglobal gave this 15.40 minute podcast with IAG for 
Monday&rsquo;s events. We gave this11 minute podcast about Tuesday&rsquo;s 
events.</p> 
<p>This AP story sums up the day&rsquo;s orders.</p> 
<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> today had this interview with Boeing CEO 
James McNerney that indicate it is a remote possibility that Boeing will bid a 
tanker based on the 777 instead of rebidding its KC-767. A subscription may be 
required to read<em>The Journal&rsquo;s</em> piece. Boeing will hold a full 
tanker briefing Wednesday.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, Wednesday morning</strong>: This blog site keeps a running 
tally of orders. For the record, we don&rsquo;t consider the Dubai Aerospace 
Enterprise to be a &ldquo;Farnborough&rdquo; order. This was announced last 
year at the Dubai Air Show; it was merely &ldquo;inked&rdquo; at this one. 
Thus, all news sites keeping tallies should put an asterisk by this one.</p>
