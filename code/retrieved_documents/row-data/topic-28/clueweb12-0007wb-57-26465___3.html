<p>The &quot;Innovation Deficit in Germany&quot; reminded me of the 
difficulties that Airbus is having with the A380. Both Boeing and Airbus are 
using virtual construction software from the Dassault Systems of France. But 
Boeing is using this software solely on its current and future airframes while 
Airbus has been forced to make do with the French design team using Dassault 
and the German team using SIEMENS and SAP. The result being delays and cost 
overruns from incompatible design work. What I'm sure is stifling innovation is 
the rejection of the best solution, regardless of nationality, for local or 
rather intranational political needs. Why design a good product if it will not 
be used and thus will not reward the designers?</p>  Comments ()

<p>The more interesting question is whether Boeing and all it's suppliers are 
using the same software? I devoutly hope that is the case. Boeing has as many 
(or more) suppliers as Airbus does - but no co-equal prime contractor as Airbus 
had.<br>
<br>
 That may keep them out of A380 hell.</p>  Comments ()

<p>The way I understand it is that Boeing used the Dassault software to design 
and then construct all the plane and then put the various pieces out to bid or 
assignment. The suppliers will not design but rather construct. The software 
will &quot;design&quot; a door but then it will install the door on a virtual 
airframe that will show if there are any problems, ie. bulkheads, wiring,etc., 
even whether the installer can reach into smaller places and attach the door on 
to the proper tolerances. Then these schematics are constructed at Boeing and 
its various suppliers using the plans that the software vetted. So far I think 
only the 787 uses this method but Boeing has hired Dassault for all of its next 
generation of airframes.<br>
<br>
 The problem with Airbus was just as I 
stated. The French design team used Dassault and the German team used a much 
more limited and older system. Thus the extensive rewiring that was called for 
in the A380. And in the redesigned A350. My understanding is that the German 
Airbus design team and German politicians with board seats on Airbus and EADS 
are adamant that Dassault's software not be used except in France. Go figure.
<br> <br>
 I agree that Boeing's reliance on a multitude of suppliers could 
cause design and construction problems. But on the 787 the risk seems to have 
paid off. I would think that any problems that do come up would be due to 
economic or political instability in the suppliers host country.<br>
<br>
 As 
an aside I would like to point out that I do not wish Airbus ill will. Boeing 
can only remain competitive if it has a strong rivalry with Airbus. Else it 
will repeat all the problems it had in the previous two decades.</p>  Comments

<p>A very late update if anybody is still reaidng this thread. Boeing admitted 
today, 1/25/07, that the 787 might be delayed because of problems with the 
inflight wireless entertainment system. Added without Dassault's software and 
now 5 times heavier than planned and unreliable to boot. At least I hope to not 
read about any wing problems in the future.</p>  Comments ()
