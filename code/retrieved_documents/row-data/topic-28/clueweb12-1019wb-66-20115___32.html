<h2>Larger engine, longer range A350-1000 to be announced at Paris 
Air&nbsp;Show</h2> June 5, 2011 Leave a comment Go to comments <br>

<p>Airbus and Rolls-Royce have agreed to up-size the Trent XWB engine powering 
the A350-1000, which will add about 500nm of range, Leeham News has learned.</p>
<p>The formal announcements have been planned for the Paris Air Show. Airbus 
issued a &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; to our inquiry and Rolls-Royce did not return 
calls.</p> 
<p>Emirates Airlines CEO Tim Clark has been urging Airbus to add power to the 
airplane and enlarge it to 380 passengers in three-classes and add range to 
allow non-stop service from Dubai to Los Angeles. Qatar Airways and Korean 
Airlines have also encouraged Airbus to enlarge the airplane.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve learned that Airbus won&rsquo;t be enlarging the airframe but 
the OEM will up the gross takeoff weight. The Roll-Royce Trent XWB, envisioned 
to power all three A350 family members, is 92,000 lbs. thrust. The larger -1000 
engine will be another 5,000 lbs. But the increased range will still fall 
somewhat short of Clark&rsquo;s goal on non-stop to Los Angeles. Rather, the 
airplane will be able to do Dubai-Seattle non-stop.</p> 
<p>Entry-into-service, advertised as 20142015, will be rescheduled to late 
2016, according to our information. (Typo; sorry about that.)</p> 
<p>The moves are important not only to Airbus&rsquo; customers, but also to 
Boeing. It also proves Boeing&rsquo;s skepticism of the original A350-1000 
design and engine size had merit.</p> 
<p>Boeing has been holding off any decision on what to do in response to the 
A350-1000, a direct competitor to the popular and highly efficient 777-300ER, 
until the detailed design definition of the -1000 emerges. Boeing, for months, 
said that it doesn&rsquo;t know what the -1000 truly is and officials went much 
further, declaring the -1000 wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;real&rdquo; airplane; and 
that to meet the performance requirement Airbus advertised, a larger engine and 
perhaps a larger wing would be required.&nbsp; One Wall Street aerospace 
analyst believes the wing will have to be enlarged by 3% but we don&rsquo;t 
believe one is part of the enhancement.</p> 
<p>Boeing has been suggesting the A350-1000 will have a five year EIS delay 
from 2014 (to 2019) because of the need to rejig the airplane.</p> 
<p>As a result, Boeing concluded that it has plenty of time to decide what to 
do with the 777-300ER. Its choices are to do nothing except routine Performance 
Improvement Packages (PIP) until a new airplane is required, or undertake a 
major upgrade that might include significant changes to the wing and engines, 
and finally design an entirely new airplane in the 2020 decade.</p> 
<p>Whether the rejigged A350-1000 provides the &ldquo;clarity&rdquo; Boeing 
needs to make a decision is too soon to say.</p> 
<p>Boeing could not be reached during the weekend for comment.</p>

<p>I believe the maximum thrust rating of the A350-1000 started off at 95 Klbs 
then went down to 92 Klbs, up to 93 Klbs and now, presumably from this report, 
up to 97 Klbs. It&rsquo;s been yo-yo-ing around a bit. I assume the delay, in 
part, is related to the A320 Neo program being brought forward and effectively 
prioritized over the A350-1000. The extra time will of course be 
useful/necessary towards squeezing more performance out of the engine and 
airframe.</p> 
<p>Tricky decision for Boeing. They have no problem selling the 777-300ER 
based on current perceptions and availability of the A350-1000. Will that 
change as the latter model is better defined and the backlogs of both airplanes 
settle?</p> </li>

<p>93 klbs + 5 klbs = 98 klbs  I think Leeham must have used some outdated 
numbers. The sheet you linked has the thrust for the -1000 as 93 klbs.</p> 
<p>What are the technical challenges in getting thrust up to that level while 
maintaining weight and fuel burn specs?</p> </li> </ul>

<p>Yes, you are right about that. The new EIS of about 2019 tells me that 
Airbus will need more &lsquo;tweeking&rsquo; of the entire airplane to get just 
to this new level of design (+500 nm).</p>

<p>No, the 777-300ER has a MTOW 18 percent higher than the current spec 
A350-1000 (298 tonnes vs. 351.5 tonnes). Still, the considerably better engine 
sfc, larger wing-area, considerably lower wing-loading, smaller wetted area and 
state-of-the-art aerodynamics of the A350-1000, will unquestionably make it 
difficult to &ldquo;defang&rdquo;. </p> </li>

<p>OK. </p> 
<p>BTW, the 515.000 lbs figure is just about the MTOW of the A332/A333.</p> 
<p>As for a conceptual future A350-700 replacing the A332 possibly outfitted 
with an A330/787 sized wing (or smaller); I would guess that the MTOW for said 
plane would be around 450.000 lbs, or less.</p> </li> </ul> </ul>

<p>Well, being a much newer design, and made mostly from composits, it should 
be much lighter than the B-77W.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the A-350 started out as the A-330-200-LITE, and has 
been called the A-280 by Airbus. It then went through 5 more official designs 
before the airlines began ordering it (except for US, which is in 
Airbus&rsquo;s pocket because Airbus bailed them out of the last bankruptcy).
</p> 
<p>During that time the B-777-300ER was quietly raking up orders. As of 15 
April 2011, the B-777-300ER has close to 500 orders (since launch in 2004) by 
itself (not counting the 60 B-777-300 non-ERs sold and delivered). OTOH, the 
A-350-1000 has only (about) 75 orders (since its 2006 launch).</p> 
<p>Is this latest version of the A-350-1000 enough to ignite some more sales 
for this version? I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps we should be asking Tim Clark and 
Akbar al Baker?</p> </li>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggest that you come back in early Q2 2018. Then we can compare 
how many orders Airbus has garnered for the A350-1000 over a period of 11 years 
and four months (since the industrial launch of the A350 XWB series in December 
2006) with the current net order intake for the 777-300ER since the launch of 
that program in February 2000.</p>

<p>The 777-300ER is the first of two new Longer-Range 777 models. The 
777-300ER and the 777-200LR (Longer Range) were launched in<b>February 2000</b> 
at the request of airline customers seeking airplanes with additional 
flexibility to serve the non-stop routes that passengers demand.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this &ldquo;new&rdquo; A350-1000 will have the same range as 
that of the original A340-500 (pax + luggage only). Aircraft such as the 
777-300ER, A340-600 and A350-1000 having such a huge under floor cargo area 
will benefit tremendously with better payload capability if all that extra 
volume is to be utilised efficiently on routes greater than 6500 nm (still 
air). However, on all existing routes from Europe to North America, for 
example, you don&rsquo;t need an A350-1000 with a nominal 8500 nm range (pax 
and luggage only) in order to fill up the under floor area with standadised 
cargo.</p> 
<p>Now, enter a hypothetical shorter range A350-1000 with a MTOW of 268 
tonnes. Such an aircraft would essentially be a stretched dash 900. The 
aircraft would be using the -900&prime;s wing and MLG with 4- wheel bogies. 
Having done a crude a first order approximation, I believe such an aircraft 
should have a range of about 6900 nm (pax + luggage only), and should be able 
to fly such routes as FRA-LAX comfortably (great circle distance 5045 nm) 
carrying a full load on the lower deck. In comparison, the 777-300 has a range 
of 6005 nm (pax and luggage only). The original dash -300 was essentially a 
stretched -200 with almost the same MTOW. Looking at the ~900 nm difference in 
nominal range between the 773 and a hypothetical &ldquo;shorter&rdquo; ranged 
A350-1000 would seem to indicate that the latter aircraft would be considerably 
more capable one than the 773, and that consequently such an aircraft would not 
be relegated to intra-Asian routes as has befallen the 777-300.</p> 
<p>Finally, what I&rsquo;m suggesting as an additional new A350 derivative is 
exactly what Boeing now is proposing to do with the 787-9; namely stretching it 
into a dash -10 version by keeping the MTOW about the same as that of the dash 
-9. The range though for the dash 10 will be reduced significantly in 
comparison to the maximum range capability of the dash -9, but should similar 
performance capability as that of &ldquo;my&rdquo; hypothetical shorter ranged 
A350-1000.</p> </li>

<p>Airbus is currently offering 5 versions of the A-350 (-800, -900, -900R, 
-900F, and the -1000) with current EIS dates for all of these versions between 
2013 and about 2017.</p> 
<p>What you are proposing is essentially an A-350-950 (A-3595?), or an 
A-350-1000-LITE (A-3510L?), which would be almost a completely new airplane.</p>
<p>I doubt EADS has the engineering assets and engineers to work on another 
model airplane. IIRC their engineers are currently working on the A-400M, 
various A-330MRTT models, A-380-800, A-380-800IGW, the mentioned 5 models of 
the A-350, and 3 models of the A-32X-NEO. That is at least 13 models of their 
various currently offered, or near future offer airplane models. I&rsquo;m not 
even counting the improvements to the A-330 models, the proposed A-380-900, or 
A-380-800F.</p> 
<p>Of course Boeing has their hands full, too, with the improvements to the 
B-737NGs, a possible reengined B-737NG, the new airplane the B-7X7, 
improvements to the B-777-300ER (or a more extensive extensive update to 
compete with the A-3510), the B-787-800/-900 (and possible -1000), the KC-46A, 
B-747-8F/I, and various fighter aircraft and possible improvements to the C-17A.
</p> 
<p>For Boeing that is 15 + projects their engineers are tied into. </p> 
<p>The Boeing web site no longer shows a price for the B-777-300, but shows a 
list price for the B-777-300ER at $284.1M USD (much lower than the list price 
of the current A-350-1000 of $299.5M USD). I would think the B-773 would be in 
the $250M-$260M USD range at list pricing.</p> 
<p>The B-773 still carries the same 44 LD3s the B-77W does, the A-359 carries 
36 LD3s and the A-3510 carries 44 LD3s, so your A-3595 would be somewhere 
between them, at about 40 LD3s (I just split the difference, so it is a guess).
</p> 
<p>The B-773 did not burn any sales records, selling only 60 aircraft. The 
B-77W shows the airlines want capacity and range. I am also assuming your 
A-3595 would have a MTOW around 283 tonnes (again I split the difference**). I 
don&rsquo;t see your suggested airplane having much more appeal than the B-773, 
unless it has a range of about 7,200 nm to 7,500 nm.</p> 
<p>** in reply 4 I incorrectly listed the MTOW of the current A-3510 as 
&lsquo;only 515,000 lbs&rsquo; (I read the wrong line that is the Max Landing 
Weight), it is actually 657,000 lbs.</p> </li> </ul>

<p>I think Tim Clark of Emirates is asking for two different things from 
Airbus. He would ideally like to get a large sub-A380 aircraft to go from Dubai 
to West Coast USA. He&rsquo;s not going to get that. He also wants a plane that 
is bigger than the A350-900 with the same sort of performance. This MTOW 
increase on the 1000 would address that need, in which case Emirates will
upgrade its 900 order to 1000 and possibly order more.</p> </li>

<p>Actually, Emirates is now using the 777-300ER (range 7880 nm; pax and 
luggage only) on their second daily DXB-LAX flight in a mostly &ldquo;pax + 
luggage only mode&rdquo; due to increased passenger demand (other one being 
flown by a 77L). The current version of the A380-800 has a nominal range of 
8200 nm, so I can&rsquo;t see why the A388 can&rsquo;t fly this route with a 
similar &ldquo;light&rdquo; payload. Also, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the 
A388 has much less extra cargo space available in the under floor compartnments 
than that of the 77W. The increased gross weight version of the A388 coming 
online in a couple of years outfitted with better performing GP7000 engines, 
coupled with an ongoing airframe weight reduction programme, should increase 
the nominal range of the A388 towards the &ldquo;magical&rdquo; 8500 nm target. 
Now,this should indicate that Emirates is planning to use the A388 on the 
DXB-LAX route when the passenger demand is there for one daily A388 flight and 
one daily 77L/77W flight (might be sooner rather than later).</p>

<p>I think many of the &ldquo;new changes&rdquo; to the -1000 were 
incorporated more then a year ago and seem &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; here.</p> 
<p>

</p> 
<p>The chances of a A350 further stretch rise with this expected engine uprate.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;the popular and highly efficient 777-300ER&rdquo; has a backlog of a 
few years, now that the 777-200ER, LR, LRF backlogs have become marginal (a few 
dozen left ?). Boeing is reviving the 787-10 for a reason.</p> 
<p>Creating a profitable 777 backlog for after 2016 is the real challenge for 
Boeing.</p> 
<p>Th&rsquo;ll communicate the 777 is just fine .. until the day they announce 
something new.</p> </li>

<p>@Keesje, I think the B787-10 will be a more of a &ldquo;light B77E&rdquo; 
replacement and a better A333 replacement&hellip;I think this is a plane EK 
might look at to replace its A332 fleet..as EK is looking to have their 
smallest plane larger than an A332.</p> 
<p>Boeing is saying 2019 for the -1000, others say 2015-maybe it will be 2017 
for the -1000.</p> </li>

<p>KC, perhaps I didn&rsquo;t make my self clear that my proposed aircraft 
would have exactly the same fuselage length as that of the &ldquo;longer 
ranged&rdquo; A350-1000.</p> 
<p>In short, the aircraft would have basically the same wing and centre 
fuselage section S-15 and 4 wheel MLG as that of the A350-900 (no extra frame 
required for the Main Landing Gear Bay to accommodate the 6 wheel MLG 
arrangement). The fwd fuselage with sections S-13/14 (+ 6 frames) as well as 
the aft fuselage with sections S-16/18 (+ 5 frames), would be identical to the 
fuselage of the dash -1000.</p> 
<p>So, it should be obvious that &ldquo;my&rdquo; proposal would not entail a 
&ldquo;new airplane&rdquo;. It would rather use the Lego approach to LCA 
construction (A350-900 wing, MLG and S15 + A350-1000 
S11/S12/S13/S14/S16/S17/S18/S19 = A350-1000&Prime;SR&rdquo;). </p>

<p>No, &ldquo;my&rdquo; proposed &ldquo;shorter&rdquo; ranged A350-1000 would 
have basically the same MTOW as that of the A350-900. 268 (metric) tonnes is 
about as high you can go with a 4 wheel MLG assembly; and remember, this is one 
of the key points of my proposal. By eliminating 2*2 wheels + MLG structure + 
one 0.635 m MLGB frame which is required for the 6 wheel MLGB to fit in the 
MLGB of the &ldquo;long&rdquo; range A350-1000, the OEW will be reduced. Gear 
weight is about 4 percent of MTOW. If the MTOW of the A350-1000 is increased to 
around 310 tonnes, then the weight savings for the 4 wheel MLG assembly should 
be around 1.5 metric tonnes. Of course, Airbus could lighten the fuselage 
structure as well, but to maintain commonality in production and for cost 
reasons, the aircraft might as well use unmodified A350-1000 fuselage sections, 
except, of course, section S-15 which would come from the A359 and which will 
be lighter anyway than the equivalent S-15 section on the A350-1000.</p> 
<p>As I&rsquo;ve already indicated, 6900 nm nominal range will be more than 
enough for West-Coast USA to Europe.</p> </li>

<p>I might add that if an operator of this conceptual &ldquo;shorter&rdquo;** 
ranged A350-1000 would copy Lufthansa&rsquo;s aft lower deck Galley/WC 
configuration on their A340-600 fleet (minus crew rest), then you would have 
extra space for at least an additional couple of rows of Y-class seats. Also, 
on intercontinental routes that see a high number of daily flighs, operators 
may have difficulty in filling up the massive additional volume available on 
the lower decks of 77Ws, A346s and the future A350-1000. In such cases, 
additional pax capacity on the main deck is warranted.</p> 
<p>**Shorter range relatively speaking!</p> </li>

<p>Your short ranged and lighter A-3510L would not be able to carry much cargo 
weight, having a MTOW of some 30 tonnes lighter, and still having the pax 
capacity of the A-3510 with baggage. I just don&rsquo;t see it able to carry 
enough fuel for 6,900 nms at a full pax/baggage load, and a little bit of 
cargo. But, since it will have the 368 tonne MTOW of the A-359, on a heavier 
airframe (than the A-359), it could use the same engines of the A-359, the RR 
Trent-XWB-93. The A-359 will have an advertised empty weight of some 115.7 
tonnes. Although Airbus has not said what the A-3510 will weigh empty, it 
should be approaching 125 tonnes, with your A-3510L coming in around 120-122 
tonnes (with your weight reductions of the MLG, section S-15, and the RR 
Trent-XWB-93 engines (not using the newer proposed RR Trent-XWB-98 which Scott 
said could weigh another 5,000 lbs combined).</p> </li>

<p>KC, as an example of payload/range capability, please take a close look at 
the payload/range chart for the 777-series:</p> 
<p>http://www.boeing.com/commercial/startup/pdf/777_payload.pdf</p> 
<p>The OEM&rsquo;s advertised range is for passengers and luggage <b>only</b>! 
On the 777 payload/range chart the range capability for carrying pax + luggage 
only, is indicated by the dotted lines. What is more interesting, is to look at 
the maximum payload capability of the aircraft. It is limited structurally by 
maximum zero fuel weight (MZFW) which is represented by the top horisontal 
lines of the chart. The diagonal line after the range at the maximum payload 
point indicates how reducing payload allows for an increase fuel carried, and 
thus range, when taking off at MTOW. The second kink in the curve represents 
the point at which the maximum fuel capacity is reached.</p> 
<p>The 777-300ER, for example, can fly 7930 nm (still air) with 365 passengers 
+ luggage,<b>but with no extra cargo</b> at all at that range. Now, the 77W can 
fly up to 5650 nm (still air) at MZFW. I would expect the 310 tonnes MTOW 
capable A350-1000 to have the capability to fly at least 6100 nm (still air) at 
MZFW.</p> 
<p>Now, please note that the 777-300 was stretched by 19 frames, or 399 inches 
(21 inch frame spacing), from the 77E. The A350-1000 will be stretched by 11 
frames, or 275 inches (25 inch frame spacing), from the A359. This means that 
the A350-900 to A350-1000 stretch is a liitle bit more than two thirds the 
length of that of the 777-200ER to 777-300 stretch. The range for the 777-200ER 
at MZFW is about 5600 nm and the range for the 777-300 at MZFW is about 3800 
nm; difference in range at MZFW beween the two aircraft being roughly 1800 nm. 
Extrapolating this number into a first order approximation for the MZFW of 
&ldquo;my&rdquo; shorter ranged A350-1000, we multiply 1800 nm with (275/399) 
which is 1240 nm. The max range at MZFW for the lighter and shorter ranged 
A350-1000 would thus be around 4850 nm (still air). In comparison, the max 
range at MZFW for the A330-200 is around 4200 nm. Of course, this is a very 
crude analysis, and I&rsquo;ve been using the 777 data normatively and 
extrapolating the result into my &ldquo;A350 equation&rdquo;, but it 
nevertheless should indicate that my proposed A359 straight derivative should 
be more than capable of flying the 5000+ nm routes beween Europe and 
North/South America with a decent cargo payload in addition to the pax + 
luggage.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>it could use the same engines of the A-359, the RR Trent-XWB-93.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>You mean the Trent-XWB-84 with 84.000 ibf of static thrust, right?</p> </li>

<p>Addendum:</p> 
<p>I made a mistake. I used the estimated range for the &ldquo;new&rdquo; 
A350-1000 at MZFW. Instead, I should, of course, have used the A350-900 as a 
reference point. The A359 is projected to have a nominal range of 8100 nm. Max 
range at MZFW for the A359 should exceed 6800 nm (still air), hence the max 
range at MZFW for my proposed lighter and shorter ranged A350-1000 should thus 
be around 4550 nm (still air).</p> </li>

<p>Response from Boeing to the &ldquo;new&rdquo; more capable A350-1000:</p> 
<p><i>(Reuters) &ndash; Boeing (BA.N) vowed on Tuesday to defend its 
successful 777 wide-body aircraft but said it felt under no immediate pressure 
to respond to a reported challenge from European rival Airbus (EAD.PA).</i></p> 
<p>
http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/07/uk-airlines-boeing-idUSLNE75601720110607
</p> 
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s some truly bizarre quotes in the article from Albaugh 
regarding the NEO vs. 737NG-RE/737RS:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Airbus has mounted a separate challenge to Boeing in the most active part 
of the aircraft market by revamping its A320 narrowbody jet with new engines to 
offer 15 percent in fuel savings, when combined with performance-enhancing 
wingtips.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The A320 is a good plane and has got quite a number of orders but 
those were orders from carriers that buy Airbus products and were going to buy 
the A320 regardless,&rdquo; said Albaugh, who is chief executive of Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We are spending a lot of time making sure our customers know we are 
going to do one of two things. We are going to re-engine or build a new small 
airplane and regardless of which we do, our plane will be better and more 
capable.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Albaugh said the choices were a 737 with new engines capable of producing 8 
percent better performance than the A320neo, or a new airplane in 2019 or 2010 
with 20 percent better performance in fuel efficiency than where the Boeing 737 
is now.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So, Albaugh is saying that a re-engined (737NG-RE) will be better and more 
capable than the NEO, with up to 8 percent better performance? Yeah, right! In 
a best case scenario they might be able to increase the fan diameter from 61 
inches (CFM56-7B) to 66-67 inches (Leap-X) without too many costly changes to 
the basic frame. However, this won&rsquo;t be enough to completely counter the 
NEO (GTF fan diameter 81&Prime; inches; Leap-X fan diameter 75&Prime;).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say this, but it seems to me that he&rsquo;s just 
throwing out fantasy &ldquo;feel-good&rdquo; numbers not grounded in 
engineering realities.</p> </li>

<p>IMO he&rsquo;ll probably have to revise his statment sooner rather than 
later. Noting that it&rsquo;s only been 6 months since the launch of the 
programme we can relatively safely assume that surely, we havent&rsquo;s seen 
anything yet!</p> 
<p>Also, I would not be surprised if the A321NEO will turn out to be a

more concerned about the competitive threat from the NEO than they publicly let

<p>I am sure there is a range at which a 737NGNE would be 8% more efficient 
than a NEO. Probably quite short distances. Did a search on A-net for an old 
post by Mandala499, he did the comparison of the 737NG vs. A320CFM/IAE across a 
number of ranges for real missions, opposed to the marketing mumbo-jumbo by 
both OEMs. At shorter ranges the 737NG buries the A320 (&gt;8% advantage per 
seat at 400nm). At mid-range they are even, and at longer ranges the A320 wins. 
Or</p> 
<p>Here:

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s a very good analysis. Hopefully it can help put to rest 
the delusion that supoposedly the 737NG absolutely is more efficient than the 
A32X.</p> 
<p>The 8.13 percent figure for fuel burn differential per seat is for a 400 nm 
flight using the &ldquo;first-generation&rdquo; CFM56-5-A3 engine on the A320; 
it&rsquo;s reduced to 6,18 percent for the CFM56-5B6/P engine (with the tech 
insertion package) and further reduced to 4.63 percent for the V2527-A5 engine. 
At 1100 nm and upwards, the A320 powered with the IAE engine option will burn 
less per seat than the CFM powered 737-800, and at 1200 nm the CFM56-5B6/P 
powered A320 will only burn roughly 1 percent more fuel per seat than the 
737-800. At 2000 nm, the numbers are all red (except for the CFM56-5-A3 powered 
A320).</p> 
<p>According to Airbus the NEO will be at least 15 percent more efficient than 
the current A320 due to the new engine in addition to the sharklets. I 
can&rsquo;t see Boeing getting, at most, more than a high single digit gain in 
efficiency by re-engining the 737NG with a Leap-X engine, which btw, would be 
less &ldquo;compromised&rdquo; than a GTF engine option.</p> 
<p>Due to the fact that Boeing is extremely constrained on extending the fan 
diameter on a new engine option for the 737NG, although they are trying to let 
on that this isn&rsquo;t so; clearly. they will not be able to reap the harvest 
of<b>all</b> of the efficiency gains entailed by the new generation GTF and 
Leap-X engines when the fan must be reduced in size, to such an extent, from 
the engine design &ldquo;sweet-spot&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Therefore, I&rsquo;m quite sure that in a future comparison between the 
A320NEO and a re-engined 737NG, an updated fuel butn comparison would only have 
red figures; IOW a far cry from a situation where a re-engined 737-800, which 
according to Mr. Albaugh&rsquo;s seemingly absolute statment, will be 8 percent 
more efficient per seat than the NEO, presumably in &ldquo;all mission 
scenarios&rdquo;.</p> </li> </ul> </ul>

<p>Well, since none of us know what Boeing really has up its sleeve for 
responding to the NEO, your guess is also a fantasy.</p> 
<p>Somehow I think Boeing engineers have actually looked at the publicly 
released information (and possibly learned information from P&amp;W and/or CFM) 
on the A-32X-NEO and have run some numbers to show the response from Boeing, 
giving them some options, a new design, reengining, or both. The 8% improvement 
number of a reengined B-737NG over what is currently known about the A-32X-NEO 
is not an unbeliveable number. I don&rsquo;t have the real fuel burn numbers, 
so this is an example;</p> 
<p>If the current model A-320 burns 6,000 lbs of fuel per hour (cruise), an 
A-320NEO would burn about 5,100 lbs per hour (cruise), based on a 15% 
improvement.</p> 
<p>If the A-320NEO burns that 5,100 lbs per hour and a B-737-800RE has an 8% 
improvement over the A-320NEO, then the B-737-800RE would burn about 4,690 lbs 
per hour (cruise). These numbers are not unachievable.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Also, I would not be surprised if the A321NEO will turn out to be a 
formidable competitor on Boeing&rsquo;s own turf. In short, I believe Boeing is 
more concerned about the competitive threat from the NEO than they publicly let 
on.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>That could happen. You could be right about Boeing being worried about the 
NEO getting some Boeing customer orders. Even long time B-737 operator WN has 
threatened Boeing they could order the NEO.</p> 
<p>As for the A-321NEO itself, it does have good timing as older B-757-200s 
retire, and the only airplanes in this market that can fill about 90% of the 
B-757 missions is the A-321NEO (not the non-NEO version) and the B-737-900ER.

<p>KCTB I too would have preferred Airbus to keep the A350-1000 lean and mean 
with a slightly reduced range. However the business case obviously requires it. 
Maybe a stretch later on.</p>

</p> 
<p>The engine uprate probably has to do with payload range requirements of the 
growing Asian markets. From hot HKG, SIN or Ghangzou to Europe or the US is a 
long way. Cargo is important for Asia and the A350-1000 (and the other members 
of this sub-family, the A350-900R and A350-900RF).</p> 
<p>No doubt likely candidates like BA, Delta, CX, EK and QF convinced them.</p>

<p>Well to begin with every model of the B-737NG begins with a lighter empty 
weight than the corrosponding A-32X model*, and the NEO is going to add weight, 
then realizing the B-737NG has a more efficent, longer, and modern wing** (it 
is a different wing design from the B-737-Classics and the 
B-737-100/-200/-200ADV) than the A-32X, or A-32X-NEO, that means the NEO has a 
steeper hill to climb at the beginning. The slightly narrower fuselarge of the 
B-737NG also has less drag than the A-32X series fuselarge***.</p> 
<p> Don&rsquo;t forget all the current B-737NGs have more range than current 
the A-32X series.</p> 
<p>On some mission lenghts the NEO option will only bring the A-32X series up 
to even with the current B-737NG series.</p> 
<p>If the B-737NG 8% improvement over the A-32X-NEO is close to correct, then 
that is a 22% improvement over the current A-32X (it would not be 23%, a 
combined 15% + the 8%).</p> 
<p>The B-737NG already is selling for a lower list price compared to the A-32X.
</p> 
<p>But, this debate is all for not if Boeing does not reengine the B-737NG, 
and decides to build a completely new airplane.</p> 
<p>*the B-737-700 is almost 6,000 lbs lighter than the A-319, the B-737-800 is 
2,900 lbs lighter than the A-320, and the B-737-900ER is 7,500 lbs lighter than 
the A-321.</p> 
<p>** the B-737NG wing is 117&rsquo;5&Prime; without the blended winglets, the 
A-32X wing is only 111&rsquo;11&Prime; without sharklets.</p> 
<p>*** B-737NG fuselarge with is 12&rsquo;4&Prime;, the A-32X fuselarge with

<p>Going by the fact that the A320 family advantage gains with mission length
<br> the weight advantage of the 737 seems to be the most prominent lever.<br>
 
The potential wing advantage is nulled by the engine disadvantage.<br>
 
Otherwise the 737* would best their complementing a320*<br>
 consistently over 
_all_ mission length.</p> 
<p>Anyway I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;newer&rdquo; is a sufficient argument for

<p>The 737&prime;s are great machines. </p> 
<p>They are less capable then the A320s too, that&rsquo;s why they are 
lighter. Payload range is lower (look at pay load range, pls forget the 
passenger only ranges). The A320 cabin is wider, it doesn&rsquo;t have a 
fifties cramped &amp; noisy (=drag) cockpit design. The 737 has an 
oversized/dated tail, can&rsquo;t carry cargo containers/pallets and has 
cockpit commonality with other 737s only. It&rsquo;s wing/LG combi prevents the 
best new engines to be included (BPR).</p> 
<p>Some of the 737 systems/ assemblies are very modern. Others carry a strong 
sixties/seventies heritage.</p> 
<p>Boeing is looking at something new for a reason. Expect them to deny any 
737 disadvantages, contrary it&rsquo;s the best NB you can buy, until the last 
leaves the production line..</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Boeing has been suggesting the A350-1000 will have a five year EIS 
delay from 2014 (to 2019) because of the need to rejig the airplane.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Spreading disinformation is a proven tactic.</p> </li> </ol>
