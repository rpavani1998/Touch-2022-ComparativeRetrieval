<h2>Filling the gap until&nbsp;re-engine</h2> March 7, 2012 10 comments <br>

<p>Reuters has this interesting story from Airbus and a focus on selling the 
A320ceo (Current Engine Option) to fill in production slots in 2015-17 (2013-14 
slots are sold out) while waiting for the A320neo (New Engine Option) 
production to ramp up. The A320neo is slated to enter service in October 2015, 
followed in six month increments by the A319neo and A321neo.</p> 
<p>Concern about selling the current generation A320 (and the Boeing 737NG) at 
prices that won&rsquo;t depress residual values is rearing its head again, 
alluded to in the Reuters story. The impact of the re-engine programs on the 
current generation A320 and 737 was a major talking point in the months leading 
up to the RE decisions by Airbus and Boeing. These concerns were pooh-poohed by 
both companies. But if Airbus (and perhaps Boeing) have to deeply discount 
sales of current airplanes to fill production slots, then this will depress 
values of the installed base.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, UBS Securities just visited Boeing with more dismal news to 
values. UBS writes that Boeing acknowledged lease rates and values of second 
hand aircraft will likely weaken as production rates ramp up. Airbus and Boeing 
both have announced rates of 42/mo (Airbus by the end of this year and Boeing 
by 2014) for their single-aisle airplanes. Airbus is studying going to 44 and 
even 60 and Boeing has openly signaled its intent to go to 60 for the 737. This 
will put more pressure on lease rates and values.</p>

<h2>Norwegian Air splits order with Airbus,&nbsp;Boeing</h2> January 25, 2012 
39 comments <br>

<p>In a surprise, Norwegian Air Shuttle split a large order between Airbus and 
Boeing for A320 and 737 families. The Airbus order is only for the NEO and 737 
order is a mix of MAX and NGs.</p> 
<p>We expected only the 737 order; we had previously reported NAS was one of 
the &ldquo;commitments&rdquo; for the MAX.</p> 
<p>This represents the third all-Boeing customer Airbus has won for its NEO.
</p> 
<p>NEO deliveries will begin in 2016, equipped with the PW GTF. Engine 
selection for later deliveries remains open. The GTF enters service on NEO in 
2015 and the NEO CFM Leap engine enters service a year later.</p> Categories:

<h2>Understanding appraisers in aircraft&nbsp;values</h2> January 16, 2012 32 
comments <br>

<p>There has been an active discussion in the comment section on the &ldquo;
Rate 35&rdquo; post and the relative merits of appraisals and appraisers with 
respect to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737NG.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve been involved in the airline business since 1979 and from 1990, 
when we co-owned Commercial Aviation Report (CAR), have followed the appraisal 
business. Given the discussion in &ldquo;comments,&rdquo; we think a dedicated 
post is worthwhile.</p> 
<p>CAR created the industry&rsquo;s first commercial appraisal conference in 
1990. ISTAT&ndash;the International Society of Transport Aircraft 
Traders&ndash;at that time was still largely a small, professional 
organization, far difference than what it is today.</p> 
<p>CAR&rsquo;s first conference brought together nearly every appraisal 
company then in existence in the US to compare and discuss appraisals of what 
was called Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs) and appraisals 
published by the firms.</p>

<h2>Boeing envisions third parallel line for 737&nbsp;Max</h2> January 11, 2012
4 comments <br>

<p><strong>Here are the stories we did for FlightGlobal on Boeing&rsquo;s 
hitting Rate 35 for the 737.</strong></p> 
<p>Boeing may assemble the re-engined 737 Max in the same facility as it 
builds the 737 NG family of aircraft in Renton, Washington.</p> 
<p>Beverly Wyse, 737 programme vice-president and general manager, said a 
potential third line for the Max would be placed in Renton with the two 
existing lines by relocating engine, empennage and line work staging areas 
positioned between Line 1 and a mezzanine that runs the length of the building.
</p> 
<p>Commercial production at Renton is split between two lines in the 4-481 
building. Line 1, the wider of the two lines, would likely play host to Line 3 
for the 737 Max.</p>

<h2>Boeing celebrates going to &ldquo;Rate 35&Prime; on&nbsp;737</h2> January 
10, 2012 54 comments <br>

<p>Boeing celebrated the transition to producing 35 737s per month, from 31.5, 
at a huge employee pep rally today (Jan. 10) at its Renton (WA) plant, where 
the assembly is done.</p> 
<p>With the country-rock band Chance McKinney &amp; Crosswire blasting away, 
the event was festooned with blue-and-white balloons, cupcakes with blue or 
white frosting, green T-shirts embossed with &ldquo;Boeing 737 MAX&rdquo; and a 
sometimes cheesy, scripted cheer-leading effect from employees, the event 
marked not only a milestone for the 737 but for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. No 
aircraft has been produced in such numbers by Boeing.</p> 
<p>And more is to come. The production rate is to increase in 2013 to 38 per 
months and to 42 the following year.</p> 
<p>Beverly Wyse, VP and GM of the 737 Program, told the 10,000 Renton 
employees that the rate could climb to 60 per month someday.</p> 
<p>All this means more jobs for Renton and Puget Sound (the greater Seattle 
area). Renton will be adding 600-700 more jobs in the each of the next two 
years for the NG production rate increases, Wyse says. It is too early to know 
how many more jobs will come with a third line for MAX, which doesn&rsquo;t 
have a first-flight time until 2016 and an entry-into-service in 4Q13.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Boeing is processing through weekly orientation days 100-200 
every Friday for Puget Sound employment, says Tommy Wilson, Business 
Relationship guru for IAM 751 at Renton.</p> 
<p>We did two stories on the celebration for Flightglobal. Under our agreement 
with Flight, we have to wait 24 hours after Flight&rsquo;s publication before 
we can post those here.</p> 
<p>Separately, Aspire Aviation published this long piece, looking at the 787 
program and ramp up.</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: 737, 737MAX, 737NG, 787,

<h2>Southwest launches 737-8, bypasses 737-7 for&nbsp;now</h2> December 16, 
2011 15 comments <br>

<p><strong>Here is an article we did yesterday for Flightglobal Pro&rsquo;s 
subscription service.</strong></p> 
<p>The Southwest Airlines order on 13 December launching the 737 Max programme 
is a launch of the -8 version. The carrier, which has substitution rights 
between the -7 and the -8, has chosen to bypass the -7 for now.</p> 
<p>Brian Hirshman, SVP Technical Operations, told Flightglobal Pro on 15 
December that the carrier is up-gauging its fleet, which it began doing this 
year with acquisition of the 737-800 for the first time. Southwest, throughout 
its history since is 1971 birth, has relied on the 737-200/300/500/700, 
preferring smaller sized aircraft and high frequency as its business model.</p>

<h2>Boeing looks at improving 737 production rate&nbsp;efficiency</h2> 
November 30, 2011 12 comments <br>

<p>Boeing is considering how to make the already-lean 737 production line even 
more efficient with an eye toward increasing rates beyond 42 per month, the 
commercial airplane division CEO said today.</p> 
<p>Jim Albaugh, speaking at the annual Credit Suisse Aerospace conference, 
said the demand is here for a higher rate.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We went into this year wanting to reduce the backlog and we failed 
miserably,&rdquo; he said, referring to record orders and commitments for the 
737NG and 737 MAX.</p> 
<p>The challenge of going higher is that the Renton 737 plant is nearing 
capacity. A solution may be to further increase efficiency of the facility.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If you go back two years with the 777 program, the maximum rate we 
had was seven per month in the factory.&nbsp; With lean manufacturing and 
engineering, we were able to take that up to 8.3 per month with very 
insignificant investment. It is my hope that as we continue to lean-out the 737 
program, we could be in a similar position where we can go even higher than 42 
if we chose to,&rdquo; Albaugh said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to make a decision on going higher than 42 for a 
while. We&rsquo;re going to go to 42 in 2013. We&rsquo;ll look at the market, 
we&rsquo;ll look at the demand&hellip;and probably in late 2012, late 2013, if 
we can go higher we&rsquo;ll make that decision.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The other thing that we have to do is really think about how we 
transition from the 737NG to the 737 MAX. Regardless as to where we are going 
to build the 737 MAX, you don&rsquo;t want to get into a situation where we 
aren&rsquo;t delivering narrowbodies. We have to build a bridge to the 737 
MAX.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The 42 rate is sustainable, Albaugh said. &ldquo;As we look at the skyline, 
the demand is there. We&rsquo;re basically sold out through 2015. We can 
sustain them.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Where will MAX be built?</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We are looking at quite a number of things. We&rsquo;re taking a 
long-term view of what makes sense. How complicated can we be. The business 
climate. The environment. The assurity of delivery. We&rsquo;ll make a decision 
when we have the facts.&rdquo;</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: 737 MAX, 737NG, 777,

<h2>Airbus takes on MAX and says best Boeing can get is&nbsp;8%</h2> October 
5, 2011 65 comments <br>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Plane Talking has this detailed story about NEO v 
MAX.</p> 
<p>Over at AirInsight, we have published a long, long piece (some 3,500 words) 
stemming from a briefing we had at ISTAT Europe in Barcelona about the A320neo 
vs the 737NG and 737 MAX. The post ishere.</p> 
<p>Airbus believes Boeing cannot achieve the 10%-12% lower fuel burn it 
advertises with the smaller fan-diameter CFM LEAP engine. The best Boeing can 
do, in Airbus&rsquo; estimation, is 8%.</p> 
<p>Take a read. This is the most detailed product comparison in the public 
domain yet.</p> Categories: Airbus, Boeing Tags: 737MAX, 737NG, A320NEO, Airbus,

<h2>The X-Factor, this time at&nbsp;Boeing</h2> August 30, 2011 52 comments 
<br> 
<p>Boeing announced the name of its new 737 re-engined aircraft and like 
Airbus for the A350 XWB, there is now and X-Factor with Boeing: the 737 
MAX-7/8/9.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Precise details on the MAX remain uncertain; Jim Albaugh, CEO of Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes, said engineering is still deciding whether to go for a 
66-inch or 68-inch fan diameter for the CFM LEAP-1B. Although Albaugh said it 
is believe the larger fan still will not require a longer nose gear, with a 
ripple-effect of changes to the fuselage, he added that there is a contingency 
determined if a longer gear proves necessary with the larger fan.</p> 
<p>Albaugh said final design configuration is still some weeks away.</p>

<h2>737RE up at Boeing Board&nbsp;today</h2> August 29, 2011 23 comments <br>

<p><strong>Update, 930am:</strong> The Daily Express of L0ndon (of all places) 
reported yesterday BCA got the approval Friday for the 737RE and that the 
announcement is to come today. Thanks to Heidi Wood of Morgan Stanley for this 
one.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post</strong>:</p> 
<p>Approval for Authority to Offer the 737 re-engine is expected to come from 
the Boeing Board of Directors today, according to sources.</p> 
<p>Last Friday we published our story reporting this in Commercial Aviation 
Online in London and, per our arrangement with CAO, the following day on this 
site.</p> 
<p>Bloomberg News published this story later on Friday also confirming ATO was 
expected.</p> 
<p>Official launch of the airplane isn&rsquo;t expected until fall, likely 
after the October Board meeting, predicts Credit Suisse.</p> 
<p>Full design definition of the 737RE isn&rsquo;t expected until next month, 
we are told. While it is widely expected that the CFM LEAP engine will have a 
66-inch fan in order to avoid any changes to the landing gear that would 
complicate the work statement, as of today this isn&rsquo;t definitively 
settled. A 68 inch fan is still a possibility, though it&rsquo;s considered 
more remote.</p>
