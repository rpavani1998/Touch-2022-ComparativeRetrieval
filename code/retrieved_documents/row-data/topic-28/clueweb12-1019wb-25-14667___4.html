<h2>We&rsquo;re back, looking at the WTO&rsquo;s ruling on Airbus&nbsp;case
</h2> May 23, 2011 Leave a comment Go to comments <br>

<p>While we were gone, the WTO issued its ruling on the Airbus case, which was 
appealed by both sides.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s been plenty post-ruling analyses written already, and since 
we&rsquo;re nearly a week later, we&rsquo;re not going to add much to it except 
to point you toAspire Aviation&rsquo;s analysis and say this: Both sides won 
some and both sides lost some in this case. The USTR failed to achieve its top 
goal, and that is to have the WTO rule launch aid illegal, so blocking aid to 
Airbus to make the A350 XWB was a failure.</p> 
<p>Flightblogger has a very good take on how both sides &ldquo;spin&rdquo; the 
final appeal report. The Wall Street Journalhas a balanced view on who won and 
who didn&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>This is a major defeat for the US&ndash;and for Boeing.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Boeing and the US had three major goals: get launch aid declared illegal; 
get the A380 launch aid declared prohibited subsidies; and block A350 launch 
aid. The rest was icing on the cake.</p> 
<p>Well, the icing got made but the cake collapsed in the over.</p> 
<p>The WTO quickly ruled that A350 launch aid wasn&rsquo;t part of this case. 
Then the panel found that launch aid, per se, wasn&rsquo;t illegal, just the 
implementation of it had been. And finally, the WTO appeals board&nbsp; 
reversed the initial finding of the WTO panel that subsidies for the A380 were 
prohibited, also a defeat for the US.</p> 
<p>But the US did win on several &ldquo;actionable&rdquo; subsidy claims. And 
the US and Boeing did get a win in that while launch aid itself is not illegal, 
the preferential interest rates are and now Airbus has to draw any future aid 
on commercial terms, which is a defeat for the EU and for Airbus.</p> 
<p>This begs the question of why Airbus needs launch aid in the future if it 
doesn&rsquo;t get the money on preferential terms but is required to get it on 
commercial terms. The answer, to us, is that it doesn&rsquo;t, except that this 
is a &ldquo;capital market&rdquo; available to Airbus that is not available to 
Boeing. You can argue about the fairness of this (and, as our readers know, we 
don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;corporate welfare&rdquo; in any form), but at least the 
money is now supposed to be at market rates.</p> 
<p>Airbus crows that it won 90% of the WTO case against it. We remember 
Northrop Grumman and Airbus parent EADS crowing similarly that it won 100 of 
108 complaint items against the appeal of the tanker contract. It doesn&rsquo;t 
matter how many were won; in that case, eight were lost and look who has the 
tanker contract now.</p> 
<p>Airbus (the EU) won important points at the WTO, with launch aid being the 
big one, but the Airbus press release was hyperbolic at best. So was the 
US/Boeing side.</p> 
<p>The appeal of the case against Boeing is pending, and like this one, we 
expect both sides to win and lose. The case will, as Aspire Aviation notes, 
drag on.</p>

<p>In my view all those law suits and complaints to the WTO are pure and 
needless lawyer&rsquo;s fodder.<br>
 Regardless of who is placing them, Airbus 
as well as Boeing, it&rsquo;s always a loss, both of the contrahents are losing 
on it, as all those legal battles are only consuming mountains of money without 
contributing anything to construction/production of better aircraft.<br>
 My 
advice: Stop this nonsense and invest the saved money into aircraft innovation.

<p>The big question for me is where does Boeing go from here? We can assume 
that the final Boeing report will be at as least as critical of Boeing as the 
Airbus one was of Airbus. Will Boeing simply give up? Will it re-enter 
negotiations with EU/EADS, as it seems EADS wants to do? Will it do something 
about removing its own actionable, possibly prohibited, subsidies? Will it 
continue the fight in another form?</p> </li>

<p>It is really high time to shut down this costly legal battle between Boeing 
and Airbus, which<br>
 should NEVER have taken place to begin with!</p> 
<p>Yes, Airbus did get European Government subsidies in 1970, on a 
pay-back-if-you-can bases,<br>
 to unify and &ldquo;restart&rdquo; their 
devided and inefficient commercial aviation industries, to be able to compete 
with the totally dominating US commercial aviation industries.<br>
 Boeing, 
however, continued to ignore the Airbus threat, convinced that Airbus would 
&ldquo;never<br>
 make it,&rdquo; as they repeatedly stated publicly, until it 
was too late 1992, when the US signed a mutual agreement with Europe, to limit 
any subsidies to Airbus OR Boeing, to up to 33% of the development cost of a 
new aircraft, repayable on commercial turns, i.e. with interest.</p> 
<p>Boeing in 1992, therefore, also secured the right to get US Government 
&ldquo;subsidies&rdquo; to get US<br>
 Government financial support, if they 
needed it, to compete with Airbus!<br>
 Fortunately Boeing never had to do so, 
which by itself confirms, that Boeing was not &ldquo;suffering&rdquo;<br>
 as 
much as they claimed they did, up to 1992!<br>
 Boeing CEO T. Wilson was widely 
quoted in the late 1980s as having responded to MDD,<br>
 which did proposed to 
challenge the Europeans on their subsidies to Airbus, with the words:<br>
 
&ldquo;We will look absolutely stupid, if we complain about subsidies to 
Airbus, while we have a 6-7<br>
 year waiting list for every model of airplane 
we have in inventory!&rdquo;<br>
 That, of course, was before the financial 
crises of the early 1990s, which hit both Boeing and Airbus very hard, which 
probably contributed to the two getting together in 1992!</p> 
<p>However, Boeing also did received US Government financial support to 
develop the US SST<br>
 program, to be able to compete with the European 
Concorde program in the late 60&prime;s early 70&prime;s.<br>
 The conditions 
for that &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; to Boeing, were even more attractive compared to 
the ones provide to Airbus, i.e. a 10/90% split between Boeing and the US 
government.</p> 
<p>The US Government also provided a similar low-cost &ldquo;bailout 
program&rdquo; or &ldquo;subsidy&rdquo; to<br>
 Chrysler Motors in the early 
&rsquo;80s, to compete with the other giant US car manufacturers,<br>
 which 
CEO Lee Iacoca proudly proclaimed to have saved the company from going under,
<br> when he repaid the whole amount, before the designated time!</p> </li>

<p>As I had mentioned in the Flightblogger comments, I suspect the EU and 
Airbus will merely work out some sort rework on the launch aid, in the hopes it 
will somehow appease the WTO. Boeing would most likely protest and then we 
would see what the WTO would have to say. And so on&hellip;&hellip;</p> 
<p>i.e. Not only is it not yet settled, but I don&rsquo;t see the EU &amp; 
Airbus just throwing in the towel on launch aid for some time to come.</p> 
<p>Since you had not written anything about this last week, I had thought you 
did not want to cope with the firestorm of (mostly partisan) comments that 
would/could result.</p> </li> </ol>
