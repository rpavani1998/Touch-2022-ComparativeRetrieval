<p>Go behind the scenes as Boeing technicians fire up the advanced systems 
onboard the newest 747</p> 
<h2>1st 747-8 Intercontinental comes to life</h2>  By Bernard Choi <br>

<p>In a small room next to the lower cargo hold, beneath where first-class 
passengers would sit, Boeing technician Al Swenson checked the maze of wires, 
circuits and buttons that make up the nerve center of the new 747-8 
Intercontinental.</p> 
<p>Boeing/Bernard Choi</p> 
<p>Boeing technician Al Swenson checks the circuitry inside the electronics 
bay of the 1st 747-8 Intercontinental. The tests pave the way for the airplane 
to power up.<br>
</p> 
<p> &quot;It can get pretty complicated,&quot; said the veteran electrician 
inside the airplane's electronics bay. &quot;Everything is tripled and 
quadrupled redundant with a lot of systems backing up each other.&quot;</p> 
<p> Swenson and his team had to ensure the main circuits were wired properly 
in order to energize and activate the systems onboard the Intercontinental for 
the first time.</p> 
<p> &quot;We had to cover every base and make sure it was lined up 
perfectly,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p> While the 747-8 retains the familiar fa&ccedil;ade of the iconic 747, a 
suite of new technologies is embedded inside, all of which need power to 
function. For example, the Intercontinental features a more powerful flight 
management computer, the option of dual electronic flight bags, and a new wing 
with control services that are fly-by-wire.</p> 
<p>Boeing/Bernard Choi</p> 
<p>To power the advanced 747-8 Intercontinental, 133 miles (214 km) of wires 
snake through the airplane.<br>
</p> 
<p> Meanwhile, a new cabin services system, including LED lights, will make 
the 747-8 Intercontinental a more comfortable space for passengers.</p> 
<p> To power those and other systems, 133 miles (214 km) of wires snake 
through the airplane. If one these wires is not installed correctly, a system 
may not function properly.</p> 
<p> The many hours Swenson and his team spent pouring over the circuitry paid 
off when mechanics connected the 747-8 to an external power cart. The flight 
deck display and other systems sparkled to life.</p> 
<p> &quot;This is a critical step in the assembly process for the new 747-8 
Intercontinental,&quot; Elizabeth Lund, 747 deputy program manager. &quot;The 
airplane's systems are now live. This milestone is a reflection of the focus 
and hard work of our engineers, mechanics and suppliers.&quot;</p> 
<blockquote> &quot;We had to cover every base and make sure it was lined up 
perfectly.&quot; Al Swenson, Boeing technician</blockquote> 
<p> The mechanics also activated the airplane's hydraulic and pneumatic 
systems. Pressurized to 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi), the hydraulics 
power the flight control surfaces, landing gear, brakes and steering systems. 
The pneumatic system enables the airplane to operate the environmental control 
systems and the leading-edge flaps.</p>

Everett, Wash.<br>
</p> 
<p> &quot;We are very methodical in ensuring the integrity of the airplane's 
systems,&quot; said Todd Zarfos, vice president of 747 engineering. &quot;This 
accomplishment is a key milestone in validating the design, installation and 
functionality of the electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems.&quot;</p> 
<p> Many functional tests are head but passing the Power On sequence brings 
the 747-8 one step closer to entering service, which is scheduled for late 2011 
following the flight test program.</p> 
<p> For Al Swenson, who has brought many airplanes to life, the milestone 
brings relief more than anything else. He and his team will repeat the same 
process for the next 747-8 that comes down the production line.</p>

<h3>COMMENTS (2)</h3>  Mahi (USA):  I am exicted to see the Boeing 747-8 
aircraft. I think this aircraft will be an unique one in aerospace Industry.

 Erwin Stoessel: <br>
 Glad to 
know that the 747 has been reborn. I always thought the 747 was the best plane 
in the skies and will renew my desire to fly. The A380 Airbus will never be as 
good. Congratulations to Boeing. All that was needed for the original 747 was 
to be upgraded and updated. The best just got better.
