<h2>WTO ruling</h2> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve talked a <em>little</em> here in the past - but not a whole lot 
- aboutsubsidies and the World Trade Organization case. </p> 
<p>Well, today you may have seen or heard reports about the WTO&rsquo;s final 
ruling in the U.S. government&rsquo;s case against European government 
subsidies to Airbus.</p> 
<p>The ruling is confidential at this point, but it will most likely be made 
public in the next couple of months.</p> 
<p>However, the news reports we&rsquo;re seeing quote officials who say that 
the U.S. has prevailed on all of the major issues in the final decision, 
reaffirming the WTO&rsquo;s interim decision from last year.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve posted Boeing&rsquo;s comments on the WTO&rsquo;s landmark 
decision on Airbus subsidies. </p>

<h3>Comments (17)</h3>  william carter (everett, washington): 
<p>After this &quot;WTO&quot; ruling, I and many others here @ Boeing and 
outside of Boeing would like to know &quot;When&quot; is the U.S. Government 
going to realize that it is NOT about a level playing field when it comes to 
OUR National Security.</p> 
<p>But instead, it is about taking care of our Countries CORE industries. Our 
Shipyards, Airplane makers, Mom &amp; Pop Machine shops, textile mill, Steel 
mills are needed to achieve a functioning manufacturing base in this Country. I 
think that it is time for a change in the way our Politicians do business in 
this Country. We need to take care of our own first...EADS does this and makes 
US out to be the bad guy.<br>

<p>Did the A330 benefit from subsidies of this nature?<br>
 How would past 
subsidies for EADS effect competitive bids on military aircraft such as the 
A330 based tanker offering?</p> 
<p>I also remember Airbus saying that the 787 was not a viable model back in 
2003 when the A380 was the answer, now they are borrowing like crazy to build 
its competitor with the A350.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 23, 2010 22:43 </p>  Ross Hirsch (Ft.Worth, Texas): 
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t appear to me that the WTO ruling will have any affect on 
the business at hand. The ruling according to business week fell short of 
saying development loans to Airbus constitute a pattern of aid detrimental to 
Boeing and the US worker. Germany and France are providing development aid to 
Airbus now for the A350. It seems whatever the WTO ruling says, nothing will 
change. The main point I see is what will we, (Boeing) do about the A350. 
Airbus claims 530 orders already for it. My understanding this is the same size 
and range as the 777. Will we give up this market?</p>

<p>If EADS submits a bid on the USAF Tanker contract how can it be considered 
a level playing field? Does the Dept. of Defense consider Eupopean government 
subsidies in the bidding process?<br>
 I don't understand the complaints from 
EADS about US protectionism when they say the tanker RFP favors Boeing's 
smaller entry. They use &quot;protectionism&quot; on every product they build. 
Maybe they are finally realizing what it is like to be on the receiving end of 
their own policy.</p> 
<p>I agree with Mr. Carter's comments about protecting America's CORE 
industries, especially when it comes to our defense. In addition to protecting 
these industries we need the PROFITS to stay in the US. These monies go towards 
future research and development which sustains our ability to compete globally 
and helps keep and create jobs for our children.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 24, 2010 08:53 </p>  Joe Paden Mesa AZ: 
<p>It seems like common sense might be making a comeback. Government handouts 
for Airbus with minimal or no payback provisions are hardly the same as Boeing 
getting a tax break or winning a competitive military contract. The right side 
won this one.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 24, 2010 09:19 </p>  Barun Majumdar (Seattle, WA, USA): 
<p>WTO ruling is very timely. It'd help Boeing. I also understand that Boeing 
management has to walk a very fine line to help sustain and grow our business 
both nationally and internationally.</p> 
<p>In this era of global economy spearheaded by fierce competition, our 
essential key to success is innovation.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are embarked as pioneers upon a new science and industry in which 
our problems are so new and unusual that it behooves no one to dismiss any 
novel idea with the statement that 'it can't be done!'&quot;<br>

<p>William,</p> 
<p>there are three ways to handle things like that:</p> 
<p>1. do it on your own - completely and you are the boss</p> 
<p>2. do it with partners, while your try to be the boss</p> 
<p>3. do it with partners, always trying to find a common way.</p> 
<p>There is nothing wrong, that the US decided to build the F22 more or less 
on its's own.<br>
 The F35 will be made with critical parts made by partners 
and it will become the operational backbone of the US airforces...<br>
 
Different to the F22 or F35 projects the tanker project welcomed an US/Europe 
partner team.<br>
 (Why is the tanker project so often postponed or delayed? 
And the reasons...). It was an US decision to invite EADS... Boeing, Dem., or 
Rep. knew enough about EADS before the company was invited to offer a 
proposal!!! Now WTO......</p> 
<p><br>
 Back to commercial aircrafts - the 787:</p> 
<p>The ultimate load test(wing 150% test load) is in prepartion since February 
8. This test should/could be perfomed on March 28 2010!<br>

<p>Randy -- presuming that indications about the favorable (to Boeing) WTO 
rulings are true, what is their impact? Is Airbus fined? How would this help 
Boeing aside from perhaps some negative publicity for Airbus?<br>
</p> 
<p> Posted on March 24, 2010 09:52 </p>  John Madison (Seattle, WA): 
<p>I'm glad to see the WTO finally come out with a ruling that targets these 
direct government subsidies. Unfortunately, it doesn't change anything in 
regards to all of the existing airplane programs already developed and in 
production. What it can do is put what's left of the development of the A350 
and any other new programs, on a market based playing field.</p> 
<p>What I don't know is, will the WTO ruling be enforceable, and what happens 
if EADS and the European governments choose to ignore the ruling and continue 
with subsidies?</p> 
<p>This appears to be a step in the right direction, but the results are yet 
to be determined.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 24, 2010 10:22 </p>  Vahid Einifar (Everett, Washington, 
98028): 
<p>We all should be mindful of adverse effects of nationalist idealogies that 
are accentuated by local politicians and Boeing advocates. They accomplish 
nothing but assist in appearance of improprietory and protectionism.<br>
 First 
class organizations compete on the sound decisions by the leadership and 
dedication of their employees. So let us plan to win, not beg for hand-outs.</p>
<p> Posted on March 24, 2010 10:58 </p>  Ron D. Smith (Customer Engineering) 
(Everett, WA): 
<p>After many years of accusations and mistrust, it's great to finally get a 
clear and unbiased ruling from the WTO. Not to take anything away from Airbus' 
technical abilities, there's no doubt their current success in the marketplace 
is directly attributable to the continuous flow of subsidies they have received 
over the years. Boeing did it the right way, fair and square as a private 
company, and has every right to feel good about the success achieved. On the 
other hand, Airbus' satisfaction is diluted at best, knowing well their illegal 
governmental support was crucial to their success.</p> 
<p>We can only hope Airbus and their supporting governments will take notice 
and take a higher ethical road in the future. But we won't be holding our 
breath.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 24, 2010 13:31 </p>  Joel W. Funfar (Seattle, Wa.): 
<p>This ruling is long overdue. I will note that the article does not mention 
the Unions involvement in this issue. SPEEA for one was internally looking at 
this for years and ways that were open in the past under the Byrd ammendment, 
To file a Counter Vailing Duties (CVD) case against Airbus for example. That 
route is no longer available since congress change the rules on who could file.
</p> 
<p>I hope the company could admit that the company and the the unions raised 
this issue to elected leaders and got the US government to file the WTO case.
</p> 
<p>To answer some questions here. Now with a WTO ruling the US government can 
take action in a number of ways against AIRBUS/EADS and governments involved.
</p> 
<p> Posted on March 25, 2010 16:38 </p>  Norman (Long Beach, California, 
United States): 
<p>It is a hot potato of an issue Airbus is partially subsidized by European 
Governments but so is the F-22 and the F-35 by the US Government but so is 
every combat and most other military aircraft by the government of the 
countries they come from.</p> 
<p>I am not overly concerned about the government subsidization of Airbus as 
long as it is a safe aircraft for the public to fly in but I think Airbus 
should make an attempt perhaps with an A320 successor to begin a privately 
funded development of an aircraft, I like to see what will become of it and how 
it would be financially developed.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 25, 2010 16:57 </p>  Wyman Henckel (Seattle, WA ): 
<p>Consider also the effect the subsidies had in the demise of commercial 
airplane manufacturers Lockeed and McDonnell Douglas.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 26, 2010 06:49 </p>  Gary Hill (Saint Louis, MO): 
<p>I'm certainly no authority in this matter, but it seems as though the US 
government, in its determination to get the cheapest product possible, would 
welcome other-government subsidies on an Airbus tanker for the US. That way, 
they (we) effectively get other-government buy-in for our next US tanker. I 
hear some talk about whether &quot;past&quot; subsidies should be a 
consideration in the current tanker competition, but what about the potential 
for subsidies on the very tanker being competed? Is anyone restricting that? If 
subsidies are restricted in this competition, then the US government 
effectively gets less competition. I'll be watching.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 26, 2010 07:35 </p>  Raymond S. Lam (Seattle, Washington, 
U.S.A.): 
<p>There is nothing as level playing field as long as it is for our war 
fighters. It should only be our field. Beside, don't keep our military 
blindfolded when solicit RFP for the tankers. We now have 7A7 based 
configuration, Air Force can have their pick.</p> 
<p> Posted on March 29, 2010 13:19 </p>  Rossano Lamagna (Kalispell Montana): 
<p>I had been VERY worried about Boeing. I know that the A380 has REALLY bit 
the heals of the Iconic 747. I have thought that the 747 would be gone. I know 
that Airbus is a VERY vicious strong competator and would like to put Boeing 
out of business. What is unfair is that Airbus can sell planes cheaper than 
Boeing and airline buy them. Airbus doesn't make as good of a plane as what 
Boeing makes, but they sure are an agressive competitor. I hope that the WTO 
can weaken Airbus and that Airbus can play by the rules. I want to see more 
Boeings being sold, especially the 747-8I's 737's to continue and for triple 
seven's to continue without the threat of the A350 to bite the heals of the 777.
