<h2>Republic&rsquo;s Bryan Bedford emulates U-Turn&nbsp;Al</h2> March 15, 2012 
9 comments <br>

<p>The CEO of Republic Airways Holdings seems to be vying to be 
America&rsquo;s version of U-Turn Al, Akbar Al-Baker, the CEO of Qatar Airways.
</p> 
<p>Bedford appears to be engaged in a campaign to raise questions about the 
Bombardier CSeries, for which he has orders and options for 80 CS300s, much the 
same way U-Turn Al alternatively praises then complains about the Airbus A350, 
Boeing 747-8F (ordered by Cargolux, in which Qatar owns a third) and the Boeing 
787. U-Turn Al has also alternative praised, condemned then praised the Airbus 
A320neo, Bombardier CSeries and the Pratt &amp; Whitney GTF.</p> 
<p>Keeping up with U-Turn Al&rsquo;s about-faces has been a dizzying prospect.
</p> 
<p>Bedford praised the CSeries when ordering it but has become increasingly 
skeptical of the program once he ordered the A319neo (with CFM LEAP engines) in 
what was a financial bailout of his ailing company being dragged down by 
Frontier Airlines. The Airbus order raised questions whether Bedford would 
cancel the CSeries since the A319neo competes with the CS300. Bedford initially 
said the order would stand. More recently, he appears to be doing everything to 
cast a shadow over the program.</p>

<h2>PW GTF-CFM LEAP market&nbsp;share</h2> February 15, 2012 13 comments <br>

<p>AirInsight has an interesting analysis of the market share of the GTF vs 
the LEAP on the A320neo family. This was completed while the Singapore Air Show 
was underway and orders still being announced.</p> 
<p>The analysis only covers the neo family, where there is competition between 
CFM International and Pratt &amp; Whitney. CFM is exclusive on the Boeing 737 
and COMAC C919 and PW is exclusive on the Mitsubishi MRJ and the Bombardier 
CSeries. PW shares the engine supply position on the Irkut MS21 with a Russian 
powerplant.</p> 
<p>Thus, the neo family competition provides a better snapshot of how the two 
engines stack up in the view of customers.</p> 
<p>A couple of points of note for the AirInsight analysis: GECAS buys only GE 
engines, so PW had no chance in this exclusive-supplier scenario; and 
Republic&rsquo;s CFM selection was part of a financial rescue package involving 
GECAS (which leases A319s and A320s with CFM engines to Republic subsidiary 
Frontier Airlines) and CFM (which restructured CFM maintenance agreements).We 
detailed the Republic order at the time. We also wrote this piece about how the 
GE powerhouse combines to win deals. The family deal with GECAS and the rescue 
package for Republic account for 280 of the 533 LEAP engines ordered to-date.
</p> 
<p>Separately, we&rsquo;ve been provided some diagrams by CFM for publication 
about the LEAP and how its architecture and technology benefit from the GE90 
and GEnx. These illustrations are below the jump.</p>

<h2>Boeing MAX v Airbus NEO; Fan size and optimizing the LEAP for MAX, 
Part&nbsp;2</h2> February 10, 2012 44 comments <br>

<p>The war of words between Airbus and Boeing continued unabated at the 
Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance 11th Annual Conference this week in 
suburban Seattle.</p> 
<p>As fully expected, Airbus said its planes are better than Boeing and Boeing 
said its planes are better than Airbus. No news there.</p> 
<p>But Boeing revealed a little bit more detail on the 737 MAX vs the A320 neo 
that suggests their analysis gives another percentage point advantage than was 
originally announced last August.</p> 
<p>When MAX was announced, Boeing claimed, &ldquo;The airplane&rsquo;s fuel 
burn is expected to be 16 percent lower than our competitor&rsquo;s current 
offering and 4 percent lower than their future offering&rdquo; and &ldquo;It 
will have the lowest operating costs in the single-aisle segment with a 7 
percent advantage over the competition.&rdquo; The slide shows an additional 1% 
advantage for fuel burn over neo and 17% over A320CEO (Current Engine Option, 
as Airbus now calls it), of +5 (VS 4) and +17 (vs 16). We asked Boeing about 
this, and we&rsquo;re told the slide reflects rounding up the numbers and not 
an actual increase in the previously announced economic claims.</p> 
<p> Randy Tinseth, VP Market, showed this slide (<em>click on the slide to 
enlarge</em>), the first time we&rsquo;ve seen one like it. The slide shows the 
improved fuel burn minus the negative impact of additional weight and drag to 
come up with net figures.</p> 
<p>What is also useful is that Boeing includes in the illustration the 
existing and planned fan diameters for the 737-800, the A320 and their 
successor airplanes. The assumptions used in the analysis are also listed on 
the slide.</p> 
<p>Airbus disputes the underlying Boeing analysis as well as claiming the 
assumptions used favor Boeing instead of real-world operating conditions. We 
covered theAirbus detail following ISTAT&rsquo;s European Conference in 
Barcelona. We sought out Boeing at that time in order to include their detail 
in that posting; Boeing declined. Boeingheld a tele-conference November 4, but 
it could only be characterized as a high-level look at the program. We&rsquo;ve 
been trying for months (since last June, in fact) to follow up their briefing 
in advance of the Paris Air Show and Boeing has been declining all interview 
requests on MAX.</p> 
<p>CFM has likewise declined interview requests (three since August, when MAX 
was launched). Both companies have left the marketplace in a fog. But 
information obtained from customers, from Boeing and from within CFM has now 
painted a reasonable picture of how Boeing and CFM support their claims that 
the 737 MAX will be more economical than neo and how the LEAP is being 
optimized for MAX. In addition to the Airbus position, it should also be noted 
that at least one airline analysis of the MAX vs neo concludes that MAX will 
only be around 2% better than neo, not the 7%-8% lower operating costs claimed 
by Boeing.</p> 
<p>The purpose of this post is not to attempt an independent analysis, but 
rather to explain why Boeing and CFM make the claims they do. This report is 
the result of months of talking with customers and sources within Boeing and 
CFM; and from public appearances by Boeing and CFM.</p>

<h2>Optimizing LEAP for 737&nbsp;MAX</h2> February 8, 2012 40 comments <br>

<p>There has been a great deal of debate over whether Boeing can meet the SFC 
reduction targets for its 737 MAX. This debate revolves in part because neither 
Boeing or CFM have been forthcoming about details how the CFM LEAP engine is 
being optimized for MAX.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve obtained some details to explain how CFM is proceeding.</p> 
<p>Details are still sketchy and hard to come by. But our source has direct 
knowledge of the program.</p> 
<p>Our source compared the requirement to reduce the fan size of the 737 LEAP 
from 78 inches on the Airbus A320 neo to 68 1/2 inches on the MAX to the fan 
reduction on the GEnx from the 787 to the 747-8. The 747-8 engines are 
optimized for this aircraft despite the smaller fan size.</p> 
<p>Reducing the fan enables CFM to eliminate some LPT stages, our source 
explains, which also cuts other parts.</p> 
<p>This eliminations allow the LEAP to be shorter, which also allows the 
engine mounting to be shorter.</p> 
<p>CFM is also using ceramics to the MAX LEAP.</p> 
<p>These are some of the key ways CFM is optimizing LEAP for MAX.</p>

<h2>CFM aftermarket drives Safran revenues,&nbsp;profits</h2> January 27, 2012 
5 comments <br>

<p>A recent report by Bernstein Research takes an in-depth look at Safran, the 
French company that is the parent of Snecma, a joint venture partner with GE to 
form CFM International.</p> 
<p>CFM, of course, is the sole-source engine provider on the Boeing 737 and 
has about half the market share on the Airbus A320 family.</p> 
<p>In the January 17 note, Bernstein looks at the after-market engine business 
of Safran, which is dominated by the CFM56. There are nearly 17,000 CFM 56 
engines in service today, mostly what Bernstein calls the second generation.</p>
<p>Bernstein&rsquo;s report illustrates what we have occasionally written: the 
importance of after-market parts sales and MRO (maintenance, repair and 
overhaul) is to the engine market.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve noted previously that the after-market is more important than 
the sale price of the engine where there is competition for a power plant.</p> 
<p>As we&rsquo;ve previously noted, it is not unknown for engine makers to 
deeply discount engine prices even more than the airframers discount their 
airplanes. In the lawsuit between Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce over 
patent claims for the engines powering the Airbus A380, court documents 
revealed discounts as steep at 80% or more.</p>

<h2>Norwegian Air splits order with Airbus,&nbsp;Boeing</h2> January 25, 2012 
39 comments <br>

<p>In a surprise, Norwegian Air Shuttle split a large order between Airbus and 
Boeing for A320 and 737 families. The Airbus order is only for the NEO and 737 
order is a mix of MAX and NGs.</p> 
<p>We expected only the 737 order; we had previously reported NAS was one of 
the &ldquo;commitments&rdquo; for the MAX.</p> 
<p>This represents the third all-Boeing customer Airbus has won for its NEO.
</p> 
<p>NEO deliveries will begin in 2016, equipped with the PW GTF. Engine 
selection for later deliveries remains open. The GTF enters service on NEO in 
2015 and the NEO CFM Leap engine enters service a year later.</p> Categories:

<h2>PNAA conference in Seattle Feb.&nbsp;6-8</h2> January 3, 2012 Leave a 
comment <br>

<p>The Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance is hosting two conferences in the 
Seattle area in February and March.</p> 
<p>PNAA&rsquo;s 11th annual conference is Feb. 6-7-8 at the Lynnwood (WA) 
Convention Center, north of Seattle and south of Everett. Information may be 
foundhere. This 2 1/2 day conference is comprised of a Defense Focus Day on the 
afternoon of Feb. 6; a day-and-a-half of commercial aviation presentations and 
a Suppliers&rsquo; Fair on the afternoon of the 8th.</p> 
<p>Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, CFM, Pratt &amp; Whitney, the Teal 
Group&rsquo;s Richard Aboulafia, G2 Global Solutions&rsquo; Michel Merluzeau, 
Alcoa and Electroimpact are among the presenters on the commercial side.</p> 
<p>Tayloe Washburn of Project Pegasus and the Washington Aerospace Partnership 
will discuss the issues surrounding the assembly site of the 737 MAX.</p> 
<p>Boeing&rsquo;s Insitu&nbsp; EADS North America and Lockheed Martin are 
among the defense industry presenters.</p> 
<p>More than 300 people attended the 2011 conference, which is now the largest 
in the Pacific Northwest and one of the largest on the West Coast. PNAA serves 
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Alberta and British Columbia. It has 
arranged trade missions from Europe, Asia and Latin America visiting here to 
meet with Washington State suppliers. PNAA was also asked by the White House 
and the US Commerce Department to arrange a meeting of key CEOs in Seattle to 
discuss economic issues affecting aerospace.</p> 
<p>The March event PNAA is organizing is a Suppliers Forecasting Symposium. 
This one day event on March 12 precedes the first USA-basedAerospace &amp; 
Defense Supplier Summit organized by BCI Aerospace.</p> 
<p>The Symposium is the first of its kind: a day-long event focused on 
forecasting the requirements in the supply chain that services Boeing, other 
OEMs and the Tier 1 suppliers. Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, 
Space &amp; Security will be presenters as well as two noted aerospace analysts 
from Wall Street, David Strauss of UBS and Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. 
They follow Boeing and the supply chain and have their views on forecasting the 
needs of the suppliers.</p> 
<p>These are two important events sponsored by PNAA and the A&amp;DSS summit 
by BCI Aerospace is equally important to the Washington aerospace supply chain. 
PNAA members get a discount to the A&amp;DSS event.</p> Categories: Airbus,

<h2>Southwest launches 737-8, bypasses 737-7 for&nbsp;now</h2> December 16, 
2011 15 comments <br>

<p><strong>Here is an article we did yesterday for Flightglobal Pro&rsquo;s 
subscription service.</strong></p> 
<p>The Southwest Airlines order on 13 December launching the 737 Max programme 
is a launch of the -8 version. The carrier, which has substitution rights 
between the -7 and the -8, has chosen to bypass the -7 for now.</p> 
<p>Brian Hirshman, SVP Technical Operations, told Flightglobal Pro on 15 
December that the carrier is up-gauging its fleet, which it began doing this 
year with acquisition of the 737-800 for the first time. Southwest, throughout 
its history since is 1971 birth, has relied on the 737-200/300/500/700, 
preferring smaller sized aircraft and high frequency as its business model.</p>

<h2>Southwest press conference on 737 MAX&nbsp;order</h2> December 13, 2011 41 
comments <br>

<p>Southwest Airlines held a web press conference (with written question 
submissions the staff can screen in advance&ndash;bad idea) on its new 737 MAX 
order. Here are highlights:</p> 
<p>Gary Kelly, CEO</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Only four 737 MAX delivered in 2017. Just 15 the following year. (From 
press release.)</li> 
<li>Christmas came early to Southwest. [Last time Kelly said that was when he 
proposed moving from Sea-Tac to Boeing Field in Seattle. Got his head handed to 
him in the local opposition. Editor.]</li> 
<li>We have seen tremendous advances with technology.</li> 
<li>COO Mike Van der Ven led effort.</li> 
<li>This is coming at just the right time. One of the main challenges we face 
are high fuel costs. We are very much in need of new technology to reduce the 
fuel burn and reduce environmental impact.</li> 
<li>This supports our financial strategy.</li> 
<li>Commonality major point.</li> </ul> 
<p>Jim Albaugh, CEO of BCA.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>[Albaugh looks a lot happier at this press conference than he did at the 
American Airlines one.]</li> 
<li>Southwest is a special customer and we have a special relationship.</li> 
<li>This is the first definitive agreement we signed. Southwest will get 
airplane #1 when it rolls off the line in Renton.</li> 
<li>[With Southwest getting only 4 airplanes in 2017, this suggests a late 
2017 EIS.--Editor]</li> 
<li>948 commitments now, projects 1,400-1,500 by the end of next year.</li> 
<li>I don&rsquo;t have the real thing but I have a model for you and a video.
</li> 
<li>[Video shows MAX will winglets, not the oft-speculated raked wingtips.]
</li> 
<li>This is largest order in Boeing&rsquo;s history.</li> </ul> 
<p>Kevin McAllister, VP Sales and Marketing for GE, representing CFM.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Southwest formally launches the LEAP-1B.</li> </ul> 
<p>Mike Van der Ven, COO.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>This allows us to accelerate the retirement of older airplanes.</li> 
<li>Have 150 options to expand as well.</li> 
<li>Our choice guarantees WN a single fleet type well into the next decade.
</li> 
<li>16-18% fuel burn improvement over 737 Classics.</li> 
<li>We&rsquo;ve been in conversations with Boeing for several years.</li> 
<li>Efficiency improvements allow up to improve without complexity.</li> 
<li>Compared with A320neo and both did the job but 737 MAX was our choice.</li>
<li>Cost is $1.2bn for <strong>all</strong> outstanding orders (including 
those existing before today). Per year.</li> 
<li>Airplanes still being defined.</li> 
<li>717s in leases 2017-2020+ and will work to see what the alternatives are 
but will operate through lease terms if we have to.</li> 
<li>Primary factors of fleet commonality and gauge of 737-8 (more seats), 
lighter airplane vs A320.</li> 
<li>We like the GTF technology but this comes as a package and CFM has 
millions of flight hours behind it. GE and CFM have been very good in past in 
delivering products on time and meeting specifications.</li> </ul> 
<p>Brian Hirshman, SVP Technology, WN</p> 
<ul> 
<li>We did extensive analysis vs A320neo and felt 737 MAX better suited.</li> 
<li>Plane works better at Chicago Midway Airport, among other issues.</li> 
<li>MAX would have to fly the same mission as NG and are satisfied it would do 
that.</li> 
<li>We wanted as much commonality as we can.</li> </ul> 
<p>John Hamilton, Boeing 737 chief engineer.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The airplane is fairly well defined. Will reach final configuration in 
2013. It&rsquo;s well enough known that WN and Boeing had confidence to go 
forward at this time.</li> 
<li>MAX will have capability to have increased payload-range vs NG.</li> 
<li>Airport performance was important, especially at key airports.</li> 
<li>We will make sure we get Southwest what it wants.</li> 
<li>We both would have liked a new airplane, but when you look at lessons 
learned [from 787] it was more challenging to bring to market in the timeframe 
customers wanted.</li> </ul> 
<p>Chaker Chahrour, EVP CFM</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Core is optimized for MAX for best overall fuel burn.</li> 
<li>We believe we have much more credible technology than GTF. We have 
tremendous amount of confidence in our technology and at the end of the day it 
will be the most economical.</li> </ul> Categories: Airbus, Boeing, CFM Tags:

<h2>Odds and Ends: A380 cost, American&rsquo;s engine order, &lsquo;war 
on&nbsp;Boeing&rsquo;</h2> November 22, 2011 36 comments <br>

<p><strong>A380 cost</strong>: Flight Global reports that Air France&ndash;a 
launch customer of the Airbus A380&ndash;just concluded a lease deal for one of 
the giant airplanes for a rental of $1.8m per month.</p> 
<p>For an airline of Air France&rsquo;s credit, lease rates are typically on 
the 0.80% range and sometimes as low as 0.72%. This, then, infers a purchase 
price of $216m-$230.4m.</p> 
<p><strong>American Airlines</strong>: It was announced Monday AA split its 
engine order between CFM (for the Airbus A319) and IAE (for the A321). Given 
American&rsquo;s large CFM-powered Boeing 737 fleet, some might think CFM 
should have won the entire engine deal. But the IAE V2500 is viewed as the 
better engine for the larger A321&ndash;more thrust and lower fuel 
burn&ndash;and American follows Lufthansa Airlines in splitting the engines for 
the smaller and larger Airbus family.</p> 
<p>Aviation Week has an article that provides some other interesting 
information about the leases for the Airbuses.</p> 
<p><strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney</strong>: Does the American deal mean PW has a 
good change of placing the GTF on the A320neo order by American? PW&rsquo;s 
buyout of the Rolls-Royce share of IAE certainly gives PW the ability to do a 
&ldquo;global&rdquo; deal involving V2500 and GTF engines, something CFM has 
been able to do for CFM56 and LEAP engines from inception. While Rolls-Royce 
was involved in IAE, there was no incentive for RR to be flexible on V2500 
sales that might lead to GTF transactions. Now PW can wheel and deal all it 
wants.</p> 
<p><strong>War on Boeing?</strong> Aviation Week has a speculative piece that 
US airlines have declared &ldquo;war on Boeing.&rdquo; This think-piece relates 
to the Air Transport Association suing the US Export-Import Bank over plans to 
finance 787s ordered by Air India, a financial and management basket-case.</p> 
<p>While AvWeek raises some interesting points, we&rsquo;re told this has more 
to do with a dispute between Delta Air Lines&ndash;instigator of the ATA 
action&ndash;and India. We think Boeing is merely getting mugged in the process 
and that this is not a &ldquo;war on Boeing.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>Turboprops</strong>: Jets always draw the most attention but Aspire 
Aviationhas a long piece about turboprops, specifically the Q400 vs the ATR 
series, that merits reading. Turboprops are slowly regaining favor in some 
quarters.</p> 
<p><strong>The Beauty of it</strong>: From Randy Tinseth&rsquo;s blog, here is 
a photo that is just a beauty, from the Dubai Air Show:</p>
