<h2>Airbus affirms A350-800 future, but skeptics doubt&nbsp;it</h2> July 11, 
2011 Leave a comment Go to comments <br>

<p>Airbus confirmed at the Paris Air Show what we reported two weeks earlier, 
and that is the A350-1000 was going to be rescheduled to allow Rolls-Royce and 
Airbus to tweak the airplane for more power, longer range and higher payload.
</p> 
<p>At the same time, Airbus announced an 18 month rescheduling of the A350-800 
to divert resources to the A350-900, the first of the three models planned to 
enter service, now promised for late 2013&ndash;a slide of at least a half year 
already.</p> 
<p>In conjunction with the -800&prime;s rescheduling, Airbus announced that 42 
orders shifted from the -800 to the -900. While slightly more than 100 orders 
remain and Airbus denied market questions about whether the -800 will survive, 
one aerospace analyst would view cancellation of the -800 in a positive light.
</p> 
<p>Here is the story we did last week for Commercial Aviation Online.</p>

<br>

<p>Bernstein Research, in a 1 July report on EADS focusing on Airbus, sees a 
risk of cancellation of the A350-800 &ndash; a move that it views 
&ldquo;positively&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>The conclusion comes following the announcement at the Paris Air Show that 
the -800 will be delayed two years and the A350-1000 by 18 months. Airbus 
rescheduled the -1000 in order to allow Rolls-Royce to provide a slightly 
larger engine to enable the aircraft to go another 400nm with an increased 
payload. But, to Bernstein&rsquo;s disappointment, the passenger capacity 
remains the same at 350. Airbus delayed the -800, officials said, to 
concentrate resources on the A350-900. Forty-two orders for the -800 in the 
first two years of the original 2014 entry-into-service have switched to the 
larger -900, but more than 100 orders remain.</p> 
<p>Bernstein views the -800 &ldquo;as the least attractive of the family and 
believe it is ultimately at risk of cancellation&mdash;which we would view 
positively,&rdquo; the 1 July report says.</p> 
<p>Airbus denies is plans to cancel the -800, which competes with the Boeing 
787-9.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It appears that Airbus is willing to let Boeing have the lower end 
of the widebody market, while it concentrates on the high end. Boeing, however, 
is not willing to cede the high end to Airbus.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The Boeing 787-8 and the morbid moribund 767 compete with the A330-200 for 
the lower end. The A330-300 competes with the 777-200ER and the A350-900/1000 
compete with the 777-200ER and 777-300ER respectively.</p> 
<p>The 787-8 has sold more than 500 of the approximately 850 787s ordered to 
date. Airbus believes the 787 is generally sized too small and seems content to 
let the A330-200&mdash;which is slightly larger than the 787-8&mdash;defend 
this market segment. While the A330-200 will cost more to operate than the 
787-8, the larger passenger and cargo capacity will generate more revenue and 
make the aircraft more profitable, Airbus argues.</p> 
<p>Ironically, the same may be said for the 777-300ER vs. the slightly smaller 
A350-1000. EIS of the -1000 is now slated for 2017. EIS for the -900 has 
slipped to late 2013 and many&mdash;including Bernstein&mdash;expect it to 
slide to 2014, with a mere eight predicted for delivery.</p> 
<p>Bernstein projects Airbus and Boeing deliveries through 2015. Boeing 
dominates the upper middle-twin aisle deliveries with the 777 while Airbus 
holds a slight lead in the lower twin-aisle markets. The numbers are somewhat 
skewed because Bernstein doesn&rsquo;t separate the A330-300 out into the 777 
marketplace.</p> 
<p>Airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the Very Large 
Aircraft segment. Overall, Boeing regains the market leadership next year as 
787 and 747 deliveries finally kick in in earnest, retaining it through 2015, 
the last year of Bernstein&rsquo;s current projections.</p> 
<p>The A320neo is scheduled to begin delivery in October 2015.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the A350-800 on its own competes against <b>both</b> the 
787-8 and the 787-9, A350-800 sales aren&rsquo;t impressive. Airbus has no 
effective response to the 787 in its segment. I don&rsquo;t think the A330-200 
is long for this world. The A330-300 could go on for a bit longer &ndash; at 
least until the 787-10 comes on stream.</p> </li>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know that there will be a B-787-10, Boeing has been riding 
the fence of that model. I think you are right about the A-332 not being long 
for this world. I think it will end production (but still be offered) within 10 
years, or so. I also think Airbus will cancel the A-358, as Boeing did with the 
B-783. The B-77W will eventually kill off the A-333, too. But it may have to 
struggle against the A-3510 if Airbus improves that model to more of what the 
ME airlines want, not in its &ldquo;new&rdquo; current form.</p> </li>

<p>Aviation history confirms, that if an aircraft is not too big when it goes
<br> into service, within reason, it will soon be too small!<br>
 That already 
appears to be the case for both the 787-8 and the<br>
 A350-800, with the lack 
of orders for both a/p&rsquo;s.<br>
 Airbus, by delaying the A35-1000 to be 
powered with more powerful<br>
 and newly developed RR engines, appears to be 
in the stronger<br>
 position compared to the 787-10 and that well may be the 
reason why<br>
 Boeing is having a tough time getting commitments for it!<br>
 
If so, history may well repeat itself, because Airbus coming out with<br>
 the 
A350 after Boeing launched the 787, had the benefit of improving<br>
 on the 
existing 787 design, as Boeing did with the 777, three years<br>
 after the 
MD-11 and A340 had been launched, making the 777 the<br>
 record breaking 
wide-body airplane it still is today!</p> </li>

<p>Do you have any proof of that? In fact, to the contrary, Boeing has been 
&ldquo;telegraphing&rdquo; for quite some time that a B787-10 will come out..it 
would be an excellent A333 replacement.</p> </li>

<p>I believe the B-787-8 has about 450 to 500 orders, including the orders 
converted from the aborted B-787-3. The A-350-800 has just over 100 orders. So, 
something about the size of the B-788 must be right. The A-350-1000 only has 
about 75 orders, or so. None have been ordered since Airbus officially anounced 
the improvement package at last month&rsquo;s PAS, even though word was out 
before then (by Scott). I suspect Airbus has been peddling the 
&lsquo;improved&rsquo; A-3510 even before Scott released his story here.</p> 
<p>The B-787-10, if it ever becomes a reality will need a bigger wing, more 
powerful engines (maybe the RR Trent-XWB?), and stronger MLG. It cannot stay at 
the same weight as the B-787-9.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how the A-350 is an &lsquo;improved&rsquo; design over 
the B-787. Yes, both have composits as their fuselarge, but the B-787 also uses 
that for the wings, the A-350 does not, it uses a metal wing.</p> 
<p>I believe both the B-787 and A-350 will be successful airplanes, although 
for different reasons. Based on what each has already sold, the B-787 about 
800, and the A-350 about 550, each has proven to be what the customer airlines 
want. Some airlines bought both airplanes.</p> 
<p>The B-777&prime;s early success is partly because the MD-11 never did meet 
its promised performance goals, and the A-342/3 had poor hot runway 
performance. At DFW, the LH A-343 would, in the hot Texas summer, use up over 
12,000&prime; of our 14,300&prime; long runways as it departed at, or near its 
MTOW. A visiting member of the Royal Saudi Family, departed on one hot day from 
DFW to RUH in an A-342 also took up most of Rwy 17R. But sales wise, the A-343 
sold reasonable well, not so for A-342/5/6.</p> </li>

<p>Your argument lacks coroborating facts ( actually plain wrong).<br>
 The 
XWB gets a black wing. And you are still idling in the Boeing<br>
 marketing 
trap.<br>
 The question tends to be how well matched materials selection<br>
 
and design methodology are and how well they are composited in<br>
 a 
synergetic way. _and not_ the brilliance of creative excretions<br>
 of the 
marketing department. This is a Boeing first and that is a<br>
 Boeing first, 
blab bla.<br>
 Boeing floats the -10 on a regular basis without creating 
tangible<br>
 interest ( done for taking focus away from the -8 is my guess ).
<br> They have continuously lost customers for the -8(and -9)even<br>
 though 
those frames were ordered at prices significantly below<br>
 the competitions 
typical pricing (going through a max 910?<br>
 down to 827 as of June this 
year.).</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the Very 
Large Aircraft segment.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>intriguing, we know what&rsquo;s happening in the NB segment and Boeing 
hasn&rsquo;t delivered a single passenger VLA for the last 6 yrs &amp; has a 
backlog of a few dozen. Adding freighters to suggest some balance is non-sense 
and even those haven&rsquo;t sold well.</p> </li>

<p>Keesje, isn&rsquo;t that also true for the last several production years of 
the A-300-600R? No pax versions sold? It will probibly be true for the A-330, 
B-777, etc. when they enter their final sales years too. &ldquo;Adding 
freighters to suggest some balance is non-sense and even those haven&rsquo;t 
sold well.&rdquo; Why? Is it because Airbus has been less successful in the new 
build freighter market than Boeing has? So Airbus supporters just ignor that 
segment of new build airplanes entirely? I&rsquo;ll agree, the world freighter 
market (excluding military cargo and tanker aircraft) is not huge, a current 
backlog of less than 300 aircraft, spread among the A-332F, B-763ERF, B-772LRF, 
and B-747-8F. But they are still new builds for each OEM, and each one counts 
in the total sales record for that basic airplane (A-330, B-767, B-777, and 
B-747).</p> </li>

<p>I asked about the previous poster regarding the -10 and I&rsquo;ll ask 
you..do you have any proof of &ldquo;without creating tangible interest&rdquo;. 
Your comments are in contrast to what Boeing management is stating regarding 
the -10.</p> 
<p>Yes they have lost customers-but it certainly isn&rsquo;t due to the 
B787&prime;s capabilities-more to do with the fact many of the carriers simply 
cannot afford to purchase the plane or have had a change in business plans. 
Airbus has seen cancellations for the A350 as well&hellip;&hellip;</p> 
<p>Do you think Airbus didn&rsquo;t price its A350&prime;s at 
&ldquo;significantly below the competitions typical pricing&rdquo;? Many of the 
A350s which Airbus will deliver are at the discounted price of the ORIGINAL 
A350&hellip;talk about discounts.</p> </li>

<p>Well, ok, but be more carefull next time or I send my minions ( 
http://www.ironsky.com </p> 
<p>Boeings &ldquo;say so&rdquo; is in contrast to reality on a regular basis. 
Compare the -10 to the<br>
 A380-900 ( which certainly _has_ very interested 
customers to be. How often does<br>
 Airbus do the NumberGirl thing with that 
future subtype ?</p> 
<p>Best price for 787 seems to have been $67m ( for an average of $76m for 
about the<br>
 first 400 sales). Thats about 50% of an already floored 
listprice I think ( based on<br>
 realistically unachievable ( not only in 
hindsight ) production simplifications.</p> 
<p>Over the years I have come to the conclusion that Boeing wanted to bind 
potential Airbus customers at all costs and by all means thinkable but never 
planned beyond i.e. to be<br>
 actually able to fullfill that orderbook instead 
hoping for a major contraction during the<br>
 then looming US^H^HGFC which 
wasn&rsquo;t all that unexpected as most people seem to think.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Boeing management is dumb. But they certainly are 
insidious only their<br>
 scheme didn&rsquo;t work out as planned.</p> </li>

<p>Well the -10 isn&rsquo;t really being offered yet per se so its hard for

<p>What does &ldquo;Best price for 787 seems to have been $67m ( for an

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if you show us some proof links about it? </p> 
<p>Also, 6-7 years ago, the B787 list prices were much less then they are now..

<p>Of course, but for the 747-8, it&rsquo;s the starting sales years where 
freighters dominate, a first IMO.<br>
 Still I&rsquo;m curious how Bernstein 
concluded &ldquo;Airbus holds a slight lead ..in the VLA business&rdquo;</p> 
<p>On topic the A350-800 as a shrink from the -900 will no doubt be heavier 
then the 787-9 as a stretch of the 787-8. Given all other factors equal/less 
important (price, comfort, (engine) commonality, payload-range) the 787-9 would 
be a more efficient platform.</p> </li>

<p>Thanks for the links Uwe!</p> 
<p>&hellip;.$76 is low, but it doesn&rsquo;t include engines, etc. so that 
would be about $100 for &ldquo;full product&rdquo;..I think the comment 
regarding &ldquo;giving away the plane&rdquo; was in lieu of the fact had 
Boeing known in advance they would have sold so many frames, they 
wouldn&rsquo;t have as heavily discounted the launch frames.</p>

<p>Some of the numbers I&rsquo;ve read for both the A350 and A380 are 
inclusive&hellip;..and again, without being tautological, many of the A350 
orders are for the original &ldquo;Mark-I&rdquo; version of the A350&hellip;and 
AFAIK, carriers such as QR will be paying the &ldquo;Mark-I&rdquo; version..not 
the XWB version&hellip;</p> 
<p>Of interest:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Aspire Aviation has learned one important contributing factor to 
Boeing&rsquo;s optimism in the payload/range performance, as well as the 
superior fuel burn performance of the 787-10X is the weight reduction 
opportunities being realised on the 787-9, which Aspire Aviation&lsquo;s source 
says is &ldquo;moving ahead of the curve&rdquo; with little to no overweight 
issue.&rdquo;</p>
