<h2>Boeing wants AA to work it out alone</h2> April 26, 2012 on 1:00 am | In 
Airline News | No Comments 
<p>Boeing CEO James McNerney expressed his and Boeing&rsquo;s viewpoint that 
they support American Airlines having an opportunity to exit their bankruptcy 
as a stand alone company.&nbsp; McNerney acknowledges that US Airways 
hasn&rsquo;t bought Boeing in a some time and sees AA as a loyal Boeing 
customer as well.</p> 
<p>Is this support for AA an attempt to preserve the AA orders for Boeing 
737MAX aircraft?&nbsp; At least a little bit, yes.&nbsp; In addition, Boeing 
has and continues to support AA&rsquo;s purchases for aircraft in a variety of 
ways.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re a good customer.&nbsp; Is that support founded on 
sheer love for the airline?&nbsp; I suspect not.</p> 
<p>In fact, any worry about the 737MAX is kind of silly.&nbsp; The merged 
airline would, upon conclusion, have far more Boeing aircraft and far more 
resources to service and operate Boeing aircraft than Airbus aircraft.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, both airlines have orders for Airbus A320NEO aircraft 
already.&nbsp; Airlines of that size can no longer afford to be an exclusive 
customer of one manufacturer or another.&nbsp; Their size (and the size of 
several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can&rsquo;t be 
serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.</p> 
<p>I suspect that if Doug Parker is able to re-assure Boeing over its existing 
AA orders, Boeing will go neutral or even supportive of such a merger.&nbsp; At 
the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about having a customer and earning money.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, it even gives Boeing an &ldquo;in&rdquo; with the US Airways 
executive team that it has not had for some time.</p> <br>

<h2>737MAX is getting real</h2> April 11, 2012 on 9:02 pm | In Aircraft 
Development | No Comments 
<p>Boeing has revealed more details on its definition for the 737MAX now and 
one significant revelation is the decision to add 8 inches to the nose 
gear.&nbsp; This was the tough choice engineering wise.</p> 
<p>A new pylon and strut for engines will be used in the style of the 787 and 
the rear tail cone will be extended and the area above the elevator thickened 
to improve aerodynamics.&nbsp; Electronic bleed air will be added to improve 
cabin pressurization (which is much like how the A350 will use bleed air)and 
better means more efficient fuel burn.</p> 
<p>Airbus boxed Boeing into this aircraft by introducing the A320NEO.&nbsp; I 
firmly believe that Boeing was leaning towards a new aircraft but also needed 
time and space to get where it needed to be with that aircraft.&nbsp; 
Airbus&rsquo; introduction of the NEO made it much more imperative to deliver 
more efficiency now rather than a decade later.</p> 
<p>But with the decision made, I also have to credit Boeing for appearing to 
have decided to go all in.&nbsp; They are working very, very hard to bring as 
much advantage as possible to the single aisle wars with Airbus.</p> 
<p>Some perceive that Boeing has been slow to release details and I understand 
that perception but the truth is that American Airlines&rsquo; order last 
summer forced their hand into a premature announcement.&nbsp; Had they not had 
to make that announcement, these new details would seem very much on time.</p> 
<p>Most believe that the status quo between the two manufacturers will be 
maintained.&nbsp; It is thought that Boeing will have a slight advantage that, 
according to many, will remain about 2% better than Airbus.</p> 
<p>I have a feeling that Boeing might be aiming higher.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
think the decisions they are now announcing about this aircraft reflect a 
company that is struggling to maintain the status quo in the marketplace.&nbsp; 
They appear to be working very hard to make every gain possible against their 
competitors to bring even more to the table.</p> 
<p>Why do I think so?&nbsp; Because these changes add more risk to their 
ability to deliver this aircraft in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is one thing 
Boeing knows, it&rsquo;s that they cannot afford to damage their credibility 
with airlines further with a late arrival of the 737MAX.&nbsp; This is not an 
all new aircraft with all new materials and airlines will expect it on time or 
early.</p> 
<p>This won&rsquo;t be revealed a la One Big Announcement John Leahy 
Style.&nbsp; Boeing will simply add more and more substantiation to their 
claims as they continue discussions with airlines.&nbsp; At the end of the day, 
most airlines prefer to see results over having a grand announcement.</p> <br>

<h2>Airbus and Boeing need to sell</h2> March 8, 2012 on 4:40 pm | In Aircraft 
Development | No Comments 
<p>A number of analysts have noted that the real goal for Airbus this next 
year is to sell production slots that are open for current A320 aircraft up to 
and including EIS for the A320NEO aircraft.&nbsp; Both Boeing and Airbus need 
to find ways to preserve value on existing aircraft lines until their new 
generation aircraft enter into service as well.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a delicate line they each walk.&nbsp; You want to satisfy 
airlines with new aircraft but some of those who buy aircraft are lessors and 
you don&rsquo;t want to anger them by depreciating their assets they already 
hold.&nbsp; And a market glut of aircraft can result in depreciating demand for 
your new generation aircraft because the capital costs for current generation 
aircraft can become low enough to make sense for airlines to buy and use.</p> 
<p>A good example of that last part is Delta buying more and more MD-90 
aircraft.&nbsp; The capital costs are low compared to current Boeing aircraft 
and the airliner provides close to current Boeing efficiencies.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Both manufacturers know that their order books are soft.&nbsp; Both know 
that some who have ordered both current and next generation aircraft 
aren&rsquo;t necessarily going to be around to take delivery on those aircraft 
5 years from now.&nbsp; One great example is Lion Airways order from 
Boeing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dirty secret about that order is that Lion isn&rsquo;t 
an airline with significant risk both in operations and financially.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Airbus need to work hard getting their current production sold until their 
aircraft are in place but without depreciating values and without massive 
discounts to encourage orders.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a tall order and a difficult 
challenge for both manufacturers.</p> <br>

<h2>Michael O&rsquo;Leary, Ryanair and the 737</h2> February 1, 2012 on 12:20 
pm | InAirline News | 3 Comments 
<p>Ryanair&rsquo;s CEO Michael O&rsquo;Leary has decided to express his 
disappointment in what they&rsquo;ve seen of the 737MAX so far.&nbsp; He 
mentions that what they&rsquo;ve seen from the A320NEO so far, they&rsquo;re 
impressed but what they&rsquo;ve seen of the 737MAX so far does not.&nbsp; 
O&rsquo;Leary, not surprisingly offers that anybody buying aircraft right now 
is nuts given the prices.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But the world has changed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the late 1990&rsquo;s or 
early 2000&rsquo;s and manufacturers are not struggling to sell aircraft.&nbsp; 
To the contrary, they are struggling to meet demand based on orderbooks.&nbsp; 
Ryanair got stunning prices for their original massive orders.&nbsp; Enough so 
that they could buy them, operate them for a few years and sell them at a 
profit.&nbsp; Neither Boeing nor Airbus is interested in making such deals 
anymore and rightfully so.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Airlines put off buying large quantities of aircraft for quite a long time 
and now the legacy airlines not only want them, they need them.&nbsp; If 
O&rsquo;Leary and Company wish to continue to operate a successful ULCC, 
they&rsquo;ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind 
of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world&rsquo;s 
legacy airlines much more competitive with ULCC&rsquo;s like Ryanair.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The truth is, I think the Airbus A320NEO does fit Ryanair&rsquo;s needs a 
bit better these days.&nbsp; But that would require a fleet change that would 
take years to accomplish and with A320NEO delivery positions reaching 
&ldquo;unobtanium&rdquo; levels for the next decade, the 737MAX probably does 
offer the best option given their position.&nbsp; One thing is sure, the COMAC 
919 isn&rsquo;t going to deliver what Ryanair needs and certainly not on 
time.&nbsp; Airbus can&rsquo;t build more even faster to meet the demand on the 
A320NEO even with some airlines orders going away.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m not sure 
why O&rsquo;Leary wants to make an enemy of Boeing.</p> 
<p>The truth is, Boeing will be happy to sell to O&rsquo;Leary and take his 
abuse while they do it.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re just not going to give away 
aircraft anymore and it appears that it will take O&rsquo;Leary a while longer 
to realize the position he and his airline are in.</p> <br>

<h2>Welcome to the New Year &ndash; Part 3</h2> January 4, 2012 on 1:00 am | In
Airline News | No Comments 
<p>2011 wasn&rsquo;t the worst year for airlines and 2012 won&rsquo;t be 
either.&nbsp; Instead, I think we&rsquo;ll see more of the same in most 
respects.</p> 
<p>Airlines will continue to constrain their capacity and that will show more 
discipine than I thought they had 3 years ago.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve proven me 
wrong and I think the results are too good for them to not to continue over the 
next 12 months.</p> 
<p>Fuel costs will continue to be a difficult thing for airlines to 
manage.&nbsp; There will continue to be volatility but I don&rsquo;t think 
we&rsquo;ll see anything like 2008/2009.&nbsp; The financial crisis in Europe 
will reduce some demand on oil but I see no real economic growth in any part of 
the world that will drive demand either.&nbsp; The truth is that the emerging 
economies are largely dependent upon demand from both Europe and North America 
and neither of those economies will see high growth in 2012.</p> 
<p>Airlines will continue to make large orders for more fuel efficient narrow 
body aircraft.&nbsp; This only makes sense as the gains are more than enough to 
justify the purchases and now is the time to gain an advantage in bargaining 
with both Boeing and Airbus.&nbsp; Furthermore, airlines need to hedge against 
their labor costs which will only grow over time.</p> 
<p>Aircraft manufacturers have a much more sure path for the next 10 years 
now.&nbsp; Boeing will be biding its time on improvements to the 777 until it 
sees more definition of the A350-1000 and it will throw its resources into 
ramping up 787 production, 787-9 development and 737MAX development.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s possible that we&rsquo;ll see a real 787-10 announcement in 2012 
but, if so, probably not until the latter part of the year.</p> 
<p>Airbus has to get its act together on the A350 and try very, very hard to 
prevent too much schedule slip.&nbsp; Despite its efforts, I think we&rsquo;ll 
see more schedule slip and it won&rsquo;t reveal the entire picture as that 
unfolds.&nbsp; While I don&rsquo;t expect quite the same delay as the 787 saw, 
it will be a significant delay and it will impact Airbus.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll 
also try to flog the A380 as much as possible and may even succeed with small 
orders in parts of the world it hasn&rsquo;t penetrated much to date.&nbsp; I 
do not see any US based orders for the A380.&nbsp; Furthermore, Airbus made 
some big promises for the A320NEO and it&rsquo;s got to work hard to deliver on 
those.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve made it out like the A320NEO is a no-brainer for 
development and while it is an incremental improvement, the engineering to 
deliver is non-trivial.</p> 
<p>Bombardier will work its tail off to sell more of the CSeries and I think 
it may even succeed.&nbsp; The sweet spot its lineup offers will become more 
attractive to airlines once they see Bombardier actually perform in the 
development and test of this aircraft.&nbsp; The CS100 isn&rsquo;t the 
attractive aircraft but its the one that will fly and deliver first.&nbsp; Once 
the performance of that aircraft is established, I think we&rsquo;ll see orders 
from US and European airlines come in large numbers.</p> 
<p>Embraer has got a nice grip on the regional airliner business but it also 
has a problem in that, right now, there is no growth path into a larger plane 
for purchasers.&nbsp; It has plans to work on re-engining the E-Series but I 
think they&rsquo;ll concede the need to develop a larger airliner as 
well.&nbsp; The Bombardier CSeries presents just a touch too much threat in the 
future.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see much from the other regional airliners 
being developed.&nbsp; The Mitsubishi MRJ doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right for 
airlines to me and doesn&rsquo;t offer a growth path into a larger 
airliner.&nbsp; The orders its racked up so far are fairly paltry and at risk, 
in my opinion.</p> 
<p>The Sukhoi SuperJet, on the other hand, has a real chance, I think.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s Westernized, it&rsquo;s flying and it does feel like its the right 
size.&nbsp; The real challenge in this aircraft is ensuring support and with 
Boeing as a consultant, it may well have some help in that arena.&nbsp; If it 
does succeed, that success will begin in Europe as well as for airlines of 
lesser developed areas such as the Middle East, India and the Far 
East.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any orders come from the US, it will be years in the 
making.</p> 
<p>If anything stirs in the US airline industry, I think it will be in the LCC 
arena and I think it will be small(ish) if anything.&nbsp; I do not think 
we&rsquo;ll see any legacy consolidation despite wishful thinkers for a US 
Airways / AA merger.&nbsp; Something like that becomes much more likely in 2013.
</p> 
<p>I think American Airlines will plod through its bankruptcy in 2012 with a 
bit of scandal here and there.&nbsp; I think its labor force is about to take a 
beating on wages and benefits and I think the resulting bitterness will last 
for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also think that United and Delta will be growing a bit 
more concerned about AA late in 2012 once they have a picture of what 
AA&rsquo;s cost structures are likely to be.</p> 
<p>2011 was largely a &ldquo;rebuilding&rdquo; year for the airline 
industry.&nbsp; 2012 will be largely so as well.&nbsp; Until the world 
economies recover, the best the industry can hope to do is manage its problems 
and earn a bit of money.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s eminently possible for them to do.

<h2>United Airlines and the A380</h2> December 5, 2011 on 12:37 pm | In 
Airline Fleets | 1 Comment 
<p>Airbus COO John Leahy is opining that United Airlines will ultimately add 
the A380 to its fleet because, in his opinion, it is the only way to be 
competitive in the Asia Pacific markets United serves.</p> 
<p>I would suppose that anything is possible but I would also offer that I 
think this is highly unlikely for the near term.&nbsp; By that, I mean you 
shouldn&rsquo;t go looking for a United announcement about this over the next 5 
years.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>United already struggles to figure out what to do with its 747 aircraft (as 
do most US based airlines) and that&rsquo;s based on the fact that people here 
in the United States are looking for direct, non-stop flights rather than trips 
that require a flight to a &ldquo;hub&rdquo; city first.</p> 
<p>The A380 might ultimately fit into the Asia Pacific strategies for both 
United and Delta but I don&rsquo;t see it right now.&nbsp; Other than the 
ability to &ldquo;concentrate&rdquo; more passengers onto a single flight, the 
A380 doesn&rsquo;t offer these airlines anything more than what they already 
have in their current and planned fleets.&nbsp; The idea that people *want* an 
A380 because it is an A380 is a bit foolish at best.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What people want is market competitive inflight service and the best 
available travel time.&nbsp; That can be accomplished profitably with the 777 
and 787 fleets that these airlines will have.</p> <br>

<h2>Now it&rsquo;s United</h2> November 29, 2011 on 1:00 am | In Airline Fleets
 |No Comments 
<p>Now we see some rumour developing that United Airlines is in talks to make 
a 200 aircraft single aisle purchase.&nbsp; This has credence due to the fact 
that United has about 200 aircraft that are some of the oldest around (these 
are 757s and 737s mostly from the original United Airlines) and those aircraft 
are likely having a real impact on the bottom line as a result of fuel costs 
and maintenance.</p> 
<p>I think we&rsquo;ll see an order and I suspect that order may well go all 
to Boeing.&nbsp; It may be named United but it is run by Continental executives 
now and those executives have found ways to effectively use the 737 on their 
routes.&nbsp; Furthermore, I think Boeing may be able to offer earlier delivery 
positions than Airbus can.</p> 
<p>What might we see?&nbsp; I would look for a sizeable portion to be 
737-900ER aircraft with some 737-800s.&nbsp; In addition, I think we may well 
see a follow on order for the 737MAX aircraft again in the -800/-900 
configurations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The current fleet of Airbus A319s are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; and while 
some of the A320 aircraft are getting older now, they aren&rsquo;t quite old 
enought to start planning retirement of until those older 737-500 and 757-200 
aircraft are replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1/3 of the A320s were delivered in the 
mid 1990s with the balance showing up from around 2000 and 
on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all of the A319s arrived in the early 2000s.&nbsp; There 
is maneuvering room left with those fleets.</p> 
<p>Airbus will want to keep United but I think they&rsquo;ll struggle to 
offering the delivery positions that United will need.&nbsp; Those positions 
are needed now and over the next 7 to 10 years.&nbsp; Airbus has sold most of 
those positions.&nbsp; The only way to offer early positions is to increase 
production even more.</p> 
<p>And both Boeing and Airbus are struggling to figure out how to increase 
their production beyond their plans for production rates that will already be 
historic for commercial airliners.&nbsp; It would require another production 
line and even more suppliers for airliners that are now fairly obsolete in 
light of the A320NEO and 737MAX.</p> 
<p>Look for an order announcement in the next 1 to 3 months and my bet is on a 
200 to 250 aircraft order of 737s with about 100 of those coming from the 
737MAX line.</p> <br>

<h2>A319s and A321s chosen by American Airlines</h2> November 24, 2011 on 1:00 
am | InAirline Fleets | No Comments 
<p>American Airlines has chosen to receive Airbus A319 aircraft and A321 
aircraft in its first round of deliveries from Airbus as a result of this 
summer&rsquo;s order.&nbsp; So far, it isn&rsquo;t know how many of each will 
be received.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The A319 choice surprised me somewhat.&nbsp; Some speculated it would be 
ordered as a gap filler between AA&rsquo;s 160 seat 737-800 and its largest 
regional jet, the CRJ-700 which has about 65 seats.&nbsp; AA&rsquo;s MD-80 
aircraft are configured with 140 seats.&nbsp; The A319, in American Airlines 
configuration, should have about 126 seats based on my research into how other 
SuperLegacy airlines are using the aircraft.&nbsp; Delta has 126 seats on its 
A319s, United has 120 seats (but with Economy Plus in the mix) and US Airways 
has 124 seats.&nbsp; I expect American to meet or beat Delta&rsquo;s seat 
count.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I myself didn&rsquo;t expect the A319 to be selected because it is heavier 
aircraft and the costs to operate it are similar to the A320 much as what has 
developed between the 737-700 and the -800 on the Boeing side.&nbsp; I actually 
thought that something such as the CSeries might get considered as that gap 
filler.&nbsp; The A319 offers a bit more flexibility on payload and range but 
the CSeries would offer better trip costs most likely.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Unlike many, I don&rsquo;t regard the CSeries as a program that will fail.
</p> 
<p>The A321 was the no-brainer.&nbsp; It will fill the 757-200 role nicely on 
most domestic routes.&nbsp; I would expect these to be configured with about 
185 seats on anything but specially configured international aircraft.&nbsp; US 
Airways has 183 seats on its A321 aircraft but, again, I expect American 
Airlines to beat that number by a few seats.&nbsp;&nbsp; Current American 
Airlines 757-200 aircraft have 182 or 189 seats depending on the mission its 
configured for.&nbsp; I expect we&rsquo;ll see something close to 189 seats for 
AA&rsquo;s A321s with the remaining 757-200s to be reconfigured for those long, 
thin trans-continental and trans-Atlantic flights.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But here is the real surprise for me:&nbsp; The A319s will have CFM engines 
and the A321s will have IAE V2500 engines.&nbsp;&nbsp; While you can choose 
from either manufacturer on both airframes, American has decided that 
commonality is trumped by mission performance evidently.&nbsp; Again, I would 
have expected American to probably go with CFM on both airframes if only 
because they do have some experience with the engines as a function of owning 
the 737-800.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, the IAE is reportedly the better performer for longer duration 
flights and it would appear that the planners at American would prefer to 
optimize performance of the aircraft according to its expected mission as 
opposed to reduce costs by having a common engine family.&nbsp; Contrary to 
what some may think, I think that&rsquo;s the right decision.&nbsp; SuperLegacy 
airlines will own enough of an aircraft/engine family to enjoy economies of 
scale and it is no longer necessary to try to maximize cost benefits by 
sticking to one aircraft type and one engine.</p> 
<p>In other words, buy the aircraft and engine that best fits the expected 
mission should be the purchase strategy we&rsquo;ll see not only from American 
Airlines but other SuperLegacy airlines as well.</p> <br>

<h2>The A340</h2> November 15, 2011 on 1:00 am | In Aircraft Development, 
Airline Fleets, Airline History | 2 Comments 
<p>(Flickr)</p> 
<p>I got asked what I thought of the A340 last week by a reader of 
FlyingColors and decided to give some thought to that subject and write a post.
</p> 
<p>The truth is, the A340 was probably the first Airbus aircraft that I really 
liked visually.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked the slender appearance of the widebody 
fuselage and I liked the four engines and how they were hung on the wing in a 
proportion that just seemed a bit sexier than other 4 engine aircraft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked Airbus&rsquo; approach to the A340/A330, too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
always been fond of the parts bin approach to creating value for a customer and 
the A330/A340 development was certainly that.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A fuselage that got borrowed from its first twin-aisle aircraft and CFM 
engines that were derived from the A320 aircraft.&nbsp; Need a medium range 
hauler?&nbsp; Use our A330.&nbsp;&nbsp; Need a long range widebody?&nbsp; Try 
our A340.&nbsp;&nbsp; Going trans-Atlantic?&nbsp; Use our A330 and if 
you&rsquo;ve got trans-Pacific routes, we have this lovely 4 engine aircraft 
for you.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And you got to have pilots that could fly both.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It was a beautiful approach and a real answer to what was needed at the 
time.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was way better than McDonnell Douglas&rsquo;s offering in 
the MD-11 and Boeing really didn&rsquo;t have an aircraft that even fit the 
needs at all.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ETOPS was changing the game at the same time, however.&nbsp; So was engine 
development.</p> 
<p>The MD-11 was a bit flawed in that it really needed a truly new wing and 
better engines to achieve its mission.&nbsp; But the ever frugal derivative 
player, McDonnell Douglas, played things just a bit too frugal.</p> 
<p>The 747 was simply a different class of aircraft.&nbsp; The 767 was too 
small and too short ranged to fit the gap.</p> 
<p>Airbus did a great job with those aircraft in offering a sweet spot 
solution for both capacity and range and then made a strong business case for 
both of them by making them as common as possible.&nbsp; You cannot blame any 
airline who went that route.&nbsp; It was, in the context of the times, the 
perfect solution.</p> 
<p>What we didn&rsquo;t really count on was engine manufacturers being willing 
to truly make game changer engines and ETOPS going far past anything anyone 
could envision.&nbsp; The 777 was born and it was an even bigger game 
changer.&nbsp; First an aircraft that solved the A330 problem just a little bit 
better.&nbsp; Not fantastically better but it offered just a touch more 
capacity and bit more cargo capacity and it did it with engines that were more 
revolution than evolution.</p> 
<p>The A330 has survived because of its improved derivatives and any airline 
using them makes great money.</p> 
<p>The A340 got hampered by a few things.&nbsp; It needed a bit better 
wing&nbsp; and better engines (and finally got&nbsp;both in the 
A340-500/600).&nbsp; The CFM engines were a great choice going in but the Rolls 
Royce Trents were the answer to a question that got asked a bit too late.</p> 
<p>Airbus bet on 4 engines being preferred for long haul, trans-oceanic routes 
and given the dominance of the 747 in that market, it wasn&rsquo;t a bad 
bet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their mistake was in underestimating Boeing&rsquo;s ability to 
look forward.&nbsp; Boeing saw the possibilities in ETOPS and&nbsp;extra high 
by-pass engines that were more reliable than anyone could have conceived of a 
generation earlier.&nbsp; And it should have given its customer base at the 
time.</p> 
<p>Airbus was hampered by a bit of McD disease and by multi-government 
ownership at the time.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t have enough capital to go 
&ldquo;all in&rdquo; on designs and knew it had to make its business case on 
flexibility which meant derivatives.&nbsp; In fact, it often only got capital 
for new investment if that investment benefitted its owners in the form of jobs 
programs for their citizens.</p> 
<p>While thinking about this post, it occured to me that Airbus even produced 
a 747-SP.&nbsp; The A340-500 derivative.&nbsp; It could fly fantastic distances 
but without enough passengers to make it cost effective.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the 
777-200LR came along and was capable of doing *that* mission better and cheaper.
</p> 
<p>The 777-200ER and 777-300ER killed the A340 in all forms (And EADS CFO just 
admitted it in the press).&nbsp; It could haul more passengers and cargo for 
the same or longer distances for less money.&nbsp; It was that simple.&nbsp; 
Boeing made the business case on trip costs and won.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Even if hindsight is 20/20, you can&rsquo;t say that Airbus made a mistake 
with the A340.&nbsp; The A340 killed the MD-11 and exposed the weaknesses of 
owning 747s.&nbsp; It did its job very well but it arrived just a little bit 
too late to enjoy its success for very long.&nbsp; Timing is everything.</p> 
<p>I would criticize Airbus for the A380.&nbsp; Yes, it has made a few 
airlines some good money.&nbsp; It also ignores the model(s) for long haul 
travel over the broad spectrum in favor of trunk routes.&nbsp; It will never 
enjoy the numbers or prevalence of the 747.&nbsp; On the other hand, neither 
will the 747-8i.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the A350 is the answer either.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think 
it fits long, thin routes as well as the 787 and its planned derivatives.&nbsp; 
I don&rsquo;t think it fits the long, large capacity routes quite as well as 
the 777 either.&nbsp; Its smallest derivative is an A330 replacement at best 
and I question whether or not it will ever get built.&nbsp; Its largest 
derivative so far doesn&rsquo;t respond to the 777-300 as a game changer 
either.&nbsp; They are free to prove me wrong.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I think the A350 won&rsquo;t sell.&nbsp; It will.&nbsp; 
But I think it&rsquo;s destined to be a player among a fairly small core group 
of airlines.&nbsp; Much as the A380 is and will be.&nbsp; Boeing took a page 
from the Airbus playbook and built the 787 to fit a nice, broad piece of medium 
and long haul routes and positioned itself to answer the largest A350 with a 
next gen 777 or next gen new build large capacity, widebody aircraft.</p> 
<p>Boeing one ups Airbus over the next 20 years with its product line up and 
does it in a way that has the gaps covered in distance, capacity and 
service.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With all of that said, I still think the A340 is one hell of an elegant and 
pretty airliner.&nbsp; It lends itself to the great airliner liveries of the 
world.&nbsp; Just look at these:</p>

<h2>Ryanair and the COMAC C919</h2> November 9, 2011 on 1:00 am | In Airline 
News | 2 Comments 
<p>Ryanair says that it may buy or lease used aircraft to fill its gaps until 
the COMAC C919 arrives in 2018 with a 200 seat aircraft.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I say that that statement is Ryanair standing up and yelling &ldquo;Look at 
me!&nbsp; Look at me!&rdquo; to Boeing and Airbus.&nbsp; ]</p> 
<p>While Ryanair says its dead serious about this aircraft, they conveniently 
do not rule out striking a deal with Boeing or Airbus on their aircraft and I 
would point out that China has yet to produce a viable commercial aircraft . . 
. ever.&nbsp; They are getting closer and I do believe that China will one day 
manage to succeed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>However, their ARJ21 is a non-starter since it is heavy and, you know, no 
one has really ordered it except Chinese airlines who were told to order 
it.&nbsp; Building a first time, competitive single aisle mainline aircraft 
requirese a body of experience that China doesn&rsquo;t have.&nbsp; Brazil has 
it.&nbsp; Arguably Japan has it.&nbsp; Canada even has it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>China doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So why should Boeing or Airbus feel threatened by Ryanair&rsquo;s 
moves?&nbsp; They shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Sooner or later, Ryanair will have to 
make a move on a next generation 737MAX or A320NEO.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they will 
get a good deal but gone are the days of getting a deal where you can buy a 
737-800 and sell it in 3 years to *make* money on the sale.&nbsp; Neither 
manufacturer are, in the least, that desperate.</p> <br>

<h2>Seven Hundred Passengers</h2> November 3, 2011 on 1:00 am | In Airline 
Fleets | 1 Comment 
<p>Airbus has announced a provisional deal for Russian airline Transaero to 
buy its Airbus A380 aircraft.&nbsp; The order is for 4 airplanes at a list 
value of about $1.5 Billion.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s impressive is Transaero&rsquo;s plans to have these aircraft 
seat 700 people.&nbsp; The Boeing 747-400 Domestic is capable of seating about 
550 people in a high density layout.&nbsp; The Transaero aircraft will be the 
rough equivalent of adding another 737 to a 747.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Air Austral, another purchaser of the Airbus A380 has announced plans to 
fly its aircraft with seating for over 850 people.&nbsp; That would be the 
equivalent of adding a 777-200 to a 747-400.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Will it work for these airlines?&nbsp; Time will only tell but it&rsquo;s 
hard to find that many people who want to be crammed into that kind of airliner 
for a long haul flight at any price.&nbsp; Current A380 operators are making 
money with their aircraft but only on extremely high density, high profit long 
haul routes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are only so many routes in the world and, more importantly, there are 
only so many airports that can accomodate the A380.&nbsp; In Russia, the only 
one is Domodedevo.</p> 
<p>As much as I do not want to fly on such an aircraft, I have to admit that I 
would like to see what 800 seats on one aircraft looks like.</p> <br>

<h2>Airliner production.</h2> October 28, 2011 on 1:00 am | In Airline Fleets |
No Comments 
<p>Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group has criticized Boeing and Airbus plans 
to ramp up production on their single aisle airliners and the man has a strong 
point.&nbsp; Current demand isn&rsquo;t from growth, it&rsquo;s simply from the 
need to replace aging airliners and the thoughts of ramping up production to 
50+ per month does smack of hubris.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some airlines do desperately need newer, more economical airliners.&nbsp; 
American Airlines is a great example and they&rsquo;ve made their order.&nbsp; 
However, what makes sense for AA doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make sense for 
another airline.&nbsp; Take Delta, for instance.&nbsp; Delta has a fairly mixed 
fleet with both Boeing and Airbus products.&nbsp; What it doesn&rsquo;t really 
have anymore is that 70&rsquo;s/80&rsquo;s fleet of aircraft with really 
inefficient engines a la MD-80s and what it does have in that category, 
it&rsquo;s getting rid of fast.</p> 
<p>But what about the MD-90s, you ask?&nbsp; Check out what engine is on that 
aircraft.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an IAE V2500, the same that is sold today on the 
Airbus A320 series.&nbsp; What Delta is keeping isn&rsquo;t nearly as old and 
inefficient as you think and the aircraft are far less capital expensive than 
new aircraft are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put, Delta is replacing exactly what 
needs replacement and not buying one aircraft more than necessary.</p> 
<p>Other airlines are evaluating the options for what they need in the next 15 
to 20 years.&nbsp; Southwest has a fairly new, fairly efficient fleet of 737s 
and it will want to keep buying new aircraft, too.&nbsp; But what does it 
need?&nbsp; Right now, it needs the 737-800 and it needs it now rather than 
later.&nbsp; It needs replacement aircraft for the remaining 737-300/500 
aircraft in the fleet and that is being achieved with 737-800s (which&nbsp; 
replace 737-700s which then replace 737-300/500 aircraft.)&nbsp; But does it 
need the 737-MAX?</p> 
<p>Well, yes and no.&nbsp; It needs the MAX but the airline also is put into 
an odd position in that it is likely faced with the following scenario:&nbsp; 
It will maintain a large fleet of NextGen 737s for the next 10 years or 
more.&nbsp; If it buys the 737-MAX, it will need to hold onto those aircraft 
for about 20 years.&nbsp; Assuming it can take deliveries in 2017, that means 
the MAX stays in the fleet for as long as 2037 or longer.&nbsp; However, 
Southwest knows that a new single aisle airliner will be available around 
2025.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the airliner that it really needs to go deep on.&nbsp; 
So, at best, the MAX is an interim solution for airines like Southwest (and 
Ryanair and others) and you don&rsquo;t go deep on interim solutions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The same is true of the A320NEO.&nbsp; For most airlines, going deep on the 
A320NEO is the wrong decision.&nbsp; Well, for the committed Airbus customer, 
going deep on the A320NEO isn&rsquo;t quite as foolish because it is fairly 
obvious that Airbus *won&rsquo;t* have a replacement for the A320NEO as soon as 
2025.&nbsp; More likely, Airbus wouldn&rsquo;t roll such an aircraft out until 
2030.&nbsp; This is why you&rsquo;re seeing fairly strong orders for the NEO 
from existing Airbus customers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Right now, both manufacturers have deep, deep order lists.&nbsp; They want 
to extract as much value from those right now as possible because they know 
that as soon as they do introduce new airliners, those orders will change 
quickly.&nbsp; The market will become flooded with cheap, relatively new 
&ldquo;classic&rdquo; single aisle airliners with a new single aisle airliner 
introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the market is flooded with those aircraft, the 
manufacturers have a much harder time selling customers into their newest and 
best.&nbsp;&nbsp; So they want to slim those lists down as much as possible 
right now.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The folly is that ramping up production comes with fairly high costs and 
the only way to justify those costs is to be able to show that you&rsquo;ll 
have an order list that will sustain those high production rates.&nbsp; The 
manufacturers think the NEO and the MAX will garner enough orders to justify 
those production rates.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the part that is suspect.&nbsp; Yes, 
initial orders are high(ish) but consider this:&nbsp; Annual production of the 
737 and A320 already exceeds 800 aircraft a year.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a lot of 
aircraft and it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago when Boeing and Airbus could hardly 
find a buyer for the planes they were producing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m talking about 
2002/2003 time periods which were a result of September 11, 2001 attacks that 
reduced air traffic dramatically and killed the finances of airlines around the 
world.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So, is a growth to 40 aircraft plus or minus a month justified?&nbsp; 
Probably.&nbsp; Almost certainly.&nbsp; Is growth to 50 or more per month 
justified?&nbsp; No and I don&rsquo;t think the manufacturers are going to 
commit to that presently.&nbsp; Right now, Boeing can reach to the high 
40&rsquo;s without too much trouble.&nbsp; Airbus would struggle with that 
without making a much larger investment in a new line (such as in the United 
States.)</p> 
<p>The A320NEO and 737MAX aircraft are interim solutions.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s 
it.&nbsp; Initial orders will reflect some pent up demand to replace aircraft 
but it&rsquo;s unlikely that the pace will continue in a sustained 
manner.&nbsp; In fact, airlines are being much more prudent in their orders by 
ordering a few here and a few there to just keep pace with their conservative 
needs.&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t see a need for production rates at 50 or more per 
month until a manufacturer gets off its duff and builds a new single aisle 
aircraft.</p> <br>

<h2>Delta sticks.</h2> August 20, 2011 on 1:00 am | In Airline Fleets | 1 
Comment 
<p>Delta has decided to stick with its plans to order up to 200 aircraft in 
2011 says CEO Richard Anderson.&nbsp; This despite the sudden economic 
turbulence and it&rsquo;s the right move.</p> 
<p>Delta has some right old aircraft on its hands.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fleet 
average age is 12 years which isn&rsquo;t as bad as American Airlines but it 
doesn&rsquo;t tell quite the story either.&nbsp; Much of its mainstay narrow 
body aircraft is *old*.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ll only get older while Delta 
waits for deliveries to start.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>What comes in this order?&nbsp; My guess is that we won&rsquo;t see any 
game changer orders for any 2nd tier manufacturer such as Bombardier or 
Embraer.&nbsp; This will be about replacing older A320s, 757s and MD-88/90 
aircraft.&nbsp; Those are the aircraft with older, less modern and less 
powerful engines that are costing big dollars in fuel bills.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I do not see this being about 767s or regional jet aircraft.&nbsp; Nor do I 
see Boeing 737 replacements coming on line either.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s unlikely 
that we see 747s retired in favor of others in this round.</p> 
<p>So who are the players?&nbsp; Airbus and Boeing, of course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
not sure I see this as either company&rsquo;s advantage either.&nbsp; Airbus 
will be pitching the A320/A321 NEOs and Boeing will be pitching the 737s (new 
and old) and it will be tough to call this one.&nbsp; I think who comes out on 
top in this order will be determined by who has slots for earlier deliveries of 
the more re-engined aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Airbus has slots, it will get 
orders.&nbsp; We know that Boeing has slots but order delivery dates are 
somewhat murky, in my opinion.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I do not look for Bombardier CSeries or Embraer E190/195 aircraft to be 
ordered in this.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re smaller and Delta has that seat range 
covered right now.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My best guess?&nbsp; I tilt towards this being Boeing&rsquo;s order.&nbsp; 
I think it might be won on price and an opportunity to get re-engined aircraft 
just a tad earlier than Airbus.&nbsp; However, I do not think that means that 
Airbus is out of the game on future orders whatsoever.&nbsp; I just think that 
it may come in the form of a follow on order in the next year and may well 
include Airbus medium to long range twin aisle aircraft as well.</p> <br>

<h2>737RE definition might be firming up</h2> August 18, 2011 on 1:00 am | In 
Airline News | No Comments 
<p>Various media reports point to Boeing leaning heavily towards a 
&ldquo;minimum&rdquo; investment strategy in defining what the new Boeing 737 
Re Engine would look like.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>That means an aircraft that receives enough modifications to handle the 
heavier CFM Leap56 engine with a reduced fan diameter which should make the 737 
models roughly equivalent to the Airbus A320NEO with about 2% cost efficiency 
advantages over the A320NEO.</p> 
<p>My problem with this is that it simply confirms the Airbus A320NEO as the 
right move and offers Boeing little advantage over the next 10 to 15 years and 
possibly puts it at a disadvantage over that time frame since there are fewer 
areas to incrementally improve performance of that airframe over 
time.&nbsp;&nbsp; One example is that the 737 already has winglets (aka 
&ldquo;sharklets&rdquo; on the A320).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition, this is the creeping incrementalism that we saw at McDonnell 
Douglas over nearly a 2 decade time period that led to their ultimate 
demise.&nbsp; Aircraft manufacturers don&rsquo;t win over the long term with 
derivatives and I&rsquo;ll point out that there have been a total of 9 major 
derivatives of the 737 with several sub-derivatives of those as aircraft as 
well.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s an aircraft that has run its course without something 
game changing.</p> 
<p>If it were to be a Re Engine strategy, it would have been far more 
encouraging to see Boeing design a new wing or a modification to the wing to 
bring additional gains.&nbsp; It would have also been more encouraging to see a 
modification to the nose gear to permit a full on adoption of the CFM Leap56 
and, possibly, even the addition of a 2nd engine choice (Pratt &amp; Whitney 
GTF).&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that begins to look like a new airliner but it puts 
Boeing firmly ahead in the narrow body game.</p> 
<p>My own preference was to see Boeing make a move for an entirely new 
aircraft with introduction into service in 2018.&nbsp; It would have been a 
difficult challenge but it is one that Boeing is in position to achieve.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s learning curve with new materials and design approaches has 
peaked.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Offering that you couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to immediately ramp up 
production to 40 to 60 aircraft a month is a somewhat lame excuse for backing 
away.&nbsp; If you can build if efficiently at current production rates (in the 
mid 30&rsquo;s per month), you can figure out how to build it at a 60+ aircraft 
rate when that time comes.</p> 
<p>This, in some ways, smells like Boeing trying to maintain the older 
airliner to use as an replacement for aging military aircraft such as what 
they&rsquo;ve done with the 737 in creating the Boeing P-8A Poseidon 
(replacement for the venerable P-3).&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s notable that even 
that aircraft got a better wing in the form of having raked wingtips a la 
767-400ER for longer duration, efficient flying.</p> 
<p>My greater point is that you don&rsquo;t win and you don&rsquo;t grow as a 
company by playing &ldquo;keep up&rdquo; and playing it safe.&nbsp; Airbus 
managed a coup by forcing Boeing&rsquo;s hand and scaring them away from a new 
design.&nbsp; Somehow, I severely doubt that a Boeing led by someone such as 
Alan Mulally would have adopted such a strategy.</p> <br>

<h2>Order Numbers</h2> August 8, 2011 on 8:49 am | In Uncategorized | No 
Comments 
<p>Airbus has racked up over 780 firm orders for the A320NEO since announcing 
its availability and even I have to say that I&rsquo;m quite surprised at how 
fast that happened.&nbsp; It would appear that airlines vocalized a desire for 
a new aircraft and ordered the re-engine like it was the best thing to happen 
since the Concorde.</p> 
<p>There is absolutely, positively, no question that Boeing needs to get back 
in the game ASAP.&nbsp; Theoretically, they did with the American Airlines 
order but . . . both Boeing and all other airlines have largely been silent on 
the 737RE since that order.</p> 
<p>I was certain that we would hear other airlines grumble about being kept 
out of the loop or shout with joy that they, too, wanted to order the 
aircraft.&nbsp; Instead, we learn at Southwest Airlines&rsquo; earnings call 
that they were kept in the loop and . . .</p> 
<p>Nothing.&nbsp; They were kept in the loop and&nbsp; they endorse the 
aircraft but no other talk of an order.</p> 
<p>The 737RE doesn&rsquo;t have board approval to offer . . . yet&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
However, in this particular case this really is a formality.&nbsp; The lack of 
any other orders even getting mentioned as rumours tells us just how fast the 
AA deal was put together.&nbsp; No one else is any farther along.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I repeat, Boeing really needs to get back into the game.&nbsp; Numbers are 
perception and Boeing knows how well it did when it was running up the 787 
numbers in the early days.&nbsp; Perception is as important as facts when it 
comes to whether or not an airline views your aircraft as leading edge.</p> 
<p>Right now, we don&rsquo;t even know what the 737-RE will be called and 
that&rsquo;s kind of bad.</p> <br>

<h2>The A320NEO and 737RE does not kill the CSeries</h2> July 28, 2011 on 1:00 
am | InAirline Fleets | No Comments 
<p>As much as Boeing and Airbus would like to think so, they 
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If anything, I think they&rsquo;ll promote the CSeries and I 
think they&rsquo;ll encourage Embraer to go bigger.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Look at the seat numbers on these aircraft.&nbsp; The A319 and 737-700 seat 
roughly 135 or more passengers.&nbsp; The A318 is a very poor candidate for the 
NEO and the 737-600 really isn&rsquo;t offered anymore.&nbsp; Neither works for 
mainline service very well because they&rsquo;re heavy for the number of 
passengers they carry and their range just isn&rsquo;t needed for routes 
requiring those passenger numbers.</p> 
<p>Sub-130 seat routes aren&rsquo;t going to be long and thin transcontinental 
routes.&nbsp; To the contrary.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be the routes they are today 
and the routes we see developing even now.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be from Wichita, 
Kansas to St. Louis or Knoxville, TN to Chicago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And there is no airliner being offered that quite gets the airlines 
there.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Airlines such as Southwest realize that a smaller airliner is probably 
necessary for growth now that they have the nation&rsquo;s largest cities 
essentially covered.&nbsp; Boeing and Airbus don&rsquo;t make that airliner and 
they don&rsquo;t plan to make that airliner.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s needed.</p> 
<p>And Bombardier is making the aircraft.&nbsp; Embraer is considering what to 
do next when it comes to either re-engining its E series aircraft or building a 
new airliner (and I think they&rsquo;ll build a stretched E195 with new 
engines, frankly.</p> 
<p>An airliner series with practical passenger capacities ranging from 90 to 
130 seats is just what these airlines need.&nbsp; And legacy and SuperLegacy 
airlines will need them too if they don&rsquo;t get their pilots to agree to 
revised scope clauses.</p> 
<p>That leads us to another reason why that class of aircraft is needed.&nbsp; 
Even if the legacy and SuperLegacy airlines get pilots to agree to new scope 
clauses that permit them to engage regional airlines for that 90 to 130 seat 
flying, somebody has to buy the aircraft and fly them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>ERJ-140 and CRJ-200 aircraft are not going to be practical going 
forward.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll hang on for a bit longer but they are going away 
because they are fuel inefficient and they&rsquo;re getting old to boot.</p> 
<p>Now that airlines know what is going to happen with both the Airbus A320 
series and Boeing 737 series aircraft, they can start shopping for that next 
class of aircraft that permits entry into those smaller markets cost 
effectively.</p> <br>

<h2>American renews its fleet</h2> July 21, 2011 on 1:00 am | In Airline Fleets
,Airline News | No Comments 
<p>I wrote a long blog post early yesterday morning about American and the 
rumoured order it was about to make.&nbsp; Then, later in the day, the rumours 
started flying that it would announce the order today (Wednesday).&nbsp; And, 
boy, did they.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the details first:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>460 aircraft on firm order with both Boeing and Airbus</li> 
<li>Boeing sells AA an additional 100 current 737NG aircraft.</li> 
<li>Boeing sells AA 100 737RE aircraft with the CFM LEAP engine.</li> 
<li>AA takes another 40 options for the 737NG and another 60 options for teh 
737RE.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Airbus sells AA 260 A320 Family Aircraft</li> 
<li>130 are for current generation A320 family with the sharklets to be 
introduced in 2012.</li> 
<li>130 are for A320NEO aircraft (with arrival in 2017 and so much for talk 
that the A320NEO line was sold out.)</li> </ul> 
<p>The aircraft will begin arriving from both lines in 2013 and American 
Airlines thinks it will have one of the youngest fleets in about 5 years.</p> 
<p>So what does it mean?&nbsp; Well, for one, the cost to announce this order 
was tiny compared to a traditional order.&nbsp; These aircraft will be on 
operational leases and it appears AA didn&rsquo;t have to put much money down 
for these firms orders (if any.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This order will be of dramatic benefit for the airline when it comes to 
saving on fuel.&nbsp; If AA had a fully modern fleet now, it&rsquo;s likely it 
would not have lost money this past quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefit in fuel 
savings on this order will take a while to be realized.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is the first official mention of a 737 re-engine and I think 
we&rsquo;re going to see some gnashing of teeth on the part of some airlines 
over the idea that a fresh design is likely 10+ years away.&nbsp; This might be 
good for AA, it isn&rsquo;t good, necessarily for Southwest Airlines or Ryanair.
</p> 
<p>This is a big win for CFM and its LEAP56 engine and while the engine is 
only announced for the 737RE, it is almost certain that that engine will be 
chosen for the A320 family.</p> 
<p>What this isn&rsquo;t is a loss for Boeing.&nbsp; The post I composed and 
just deleted talked about how having a single source for your aircraft 
wasn&rsquo;t really practical for an airline of AA&rsquo;s size and all other 
SuperLegacy and Legacy airlines operate mixed fleets already as a function of a 
merger.&nbsp; What those airlines have learned is that neither Boeing nor 
Airbus has a supply chain that can meet all their needs all of the time and on 
time.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t irrational for AA to go to Airbus.</p> 
<p>However, this is a pretty big loss for Boeing in the psychological warfare 
arena of aircraft sales.&nbsp; This will be spun many ways but at the end of 
the day, Boeing got bruised and is not the aircraft manufacturer who gets to 
crow about success today.&nbsp; Expect other SuperLegacy airlines to take a 
long, hard look at this deal and begin to negotiate for their own SuperDeals on 
aircraft with both manufacturers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Why did Airbus win more orders?&nbsp; Because AA already has a large 737 
fleet.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t need quite as many 737s.&nbsp; This really is an 
order of equals practically speaking.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I do think the A321NEO will be the 757-ish replacement and I do not think 
that AA will upsize aircraft to the 737-900ER down the line.&nbsp; Therefore, I 
think the A320 family order will be either</p> 
<p>A) A full mix of A319/320/321 aircraft with multiple bases or</p> 
<p>B) A320/A321 aircraft with focused bases</p> 
<p>I rather doubt that the A319 or the B737-700 will be ordered at all.&nbsp; 
This order is about a marginal increase in capacity over time for most routes 
with the 757s leaving ever so slowly over time.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And that points out a glaring gap that I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone talk 
about yet.&nbsp; Through this order and previous small orders, American 
Airlines will have upguaged their entire fleet and particularly so in the next 
5 to 7 years.&nbsp; Presently, the smallest aircraft in its fleet will be the 
737-800 or A320 at roughly 160 seats.</p> 
<p>What serves the 120 to 150 seat range?&nbsp; The MD-80&rsquo;s are 
departing and rightfully so.&nbsp; American Eagle has CRJ-700s that are 
configured from 63 to 65 seats and AA is currently scope clause limited on how 
many of these aircraft it can fly.&nbsp; Now, AA has also announced that it 
will spin off American Eagle soon and we&rsquo;ll talk about that in a future 
post but that only means AA can (and will) access other regional airlines for 
its sub-100 seat flying.</p> 
<p>What fills the gap?&nbsp; If AA manages to get a new pilot agreement that 
allows AA to subcontract its sub 150 seat flying, I&rsquo;ll be rather 
shocked.&nbsp; I do not think the pilots are going to cede that territory under 
the current contract or whatever agreement is made for the near future.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>I realize that AA has been serving markets that might demand a 120 to 130 
seat aircraft with higher frequency using smaller jets but it can&rsquo;t do 
that forever.&nbsp; Is there another order for aircraft lurking in the 
background here?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; The Bombardier CSeries does fit that whole 
very nicely and does it in harmony with this announced order.&nbsp; In fact, it 
presently is the only airliner that does.&nbsp; Embraer gets close but it 
doesn&rsquo;t quite get there.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I were Bombardier, I would be 
knocking on American Airlines&rsquo; door with a most excellent finance package 
for its CSeries CS100 and CS300.</p> 
<p>There is one more question lingering as well . . .</p> 
<p>How will American Airlines paint its A320 family?&nbsp; The aircraft cannot 
be polished like its 737 counterparts.&nbsp; I strongly suspect we&rsquo;ll see 
a metallic silver used with the current paint scheme over that.</p> <br>
