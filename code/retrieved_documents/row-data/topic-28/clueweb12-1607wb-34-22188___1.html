 eLearning, Boeing 
and Airbus  Boeing, Airbus and eLearning - doesn't sound like a logical match 
at all! What on earth does computer based training (CBT) of pilots and airplane 
engineers have to do with what is going on in the Learning Technology 
standardisation? Read the interview with Aviation Industry CBT (computer based 
training) Commitee's chairman below to gain better understanding. The interview 
was made by the newsletter &quot;News and Views&quot; with Jack Hyde, Chairman 
AICC CMI (Computer Managed Instruction) Subcommittee (www.aicc.org). <strong>
News and Views</strong>: AICC stands for Aviation Industry CBT Committee. What 
is it?
<p><b>Jack Hyde</b>: In 1988, Airbus, Boeing, and McDonald-Douglas were 
providing DOS-based CBT (Computer Based Training), but the same hardware - 
graphics cards and the like - could not be used for training programs from 
different manufacturers. So the three companies, some airlines, and a couple of 
CBT vendors got together and formed the AICC. The point was to make aviation 
CBT run on a single standardized platform. It grew from there. When the 
Internet came along, we created a way to manage instruction over the Internet. 
We're still doing new stuff, for example defining ways for simulations to 
interoperate with CBT.</p> 
<p><b>News and Views</b>: Can you explain that? </p> 
<p><b>Jack Hyde</b>: Self-directed discovery learning takes too long and can 
reinforce bad habits, so when simulations are used in aviation training, there 
is usually an instructor with the learner. No one complains when that happens 
in a fifteen-million dollar flight simulator, but people wonder why you need an 
instructor sitting by every learner in front of a five-thousand dollar 
workstation. We want computers to deliver guidance, assess progress, and adapt 
the learning path to results, and we don't want a separate proprietary CBT 
system for simulations.</p> 
<p><b>News and Views</b>: What about plain old Web-based training? </p> 
<p><b>Jack Hyde</b>: Lots of people use our specifications to support 
Web-based training, what we call Computer Managed Instruction. Not just the 
aviation industry, but also the energy industry, the military, pharmaceutical 
companies - everyone, really. Lots of products are certified and we have had 
more downloads this year than in any previous year.</p> 
<p><b>News and Views</b>: Certified? </p> 
<p><b>Jack Hyde</b>: The AICC uses independent laboratories to certify that 
products and content conform to our specifications. Certified products have the 
right to display the AICC logo. Non-certified products may only claim they are 
'designed to AICC specifications'.</p> 
<p><b>News and Views</b>: Where does SCORM fit in with the AICC? </p> 
<p><b>Jack Hyde</b>: SCORM uses parts of our specifications, and the key 
communication piece was developed at a joint meeting that we sponsored. We have 
a way to define learning paths based on learning objectives and prerequisites. 
SCORM is looking at something different in that area, and we'll evaluate what 
they do. Right now, we are compatible with SCORM but our stuff goes further in 
some areas to meet aviation training needs. That's how we want to keep it.</p> 
<p><b>News and Views</b>: Thanks, Jack! </p>
