<h2>09AprBoeing continues to optimise 737 MAX</h2> <br>

<p>During the first-quarter, Chicago-based airframer Boeing continues to rack 
up orders and commitments for its re-engined 737 MAX aircraft, garnering 301 
firm orders, including 100 737 MAX 8s from Oslo-based low-cost carrier (LCC) 
Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS) and 201 737 MAX 9s from Indonesia-based LCC Lion 
Air in the three months ending 31st March. Its transatlantic arch-rival Airbus, 
in contrast,&nbsp;received 143 firm orders for the re-engined A320neo (new 
engine option) aircraft, including 35 from Kuwaiti aircraft lessor ALAFCO, 45 
from US ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines, 33 from Avianca-Taca and 30 
from Mexican low-cost carrier (LCC) Volaris, in addition to the 
Norwegian&rsquo;s memorandum of understanding (MOU) for 100 A320neos.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the world&rsquo;s second-largest aircraft manufacturer is edging 
closer to the conclusion of the final phase ofwind-tunnel testing on the 
re-engined 737 MAX, where&nbsp;QinetiQ in Farnborough, United Kingdom, will 
assess the re-engined narrowbody aircraft&rsquo;s low-speed performance along 
with the company&rsquo;s facility in Seattle to evaluate the aircraft&rsquo;s 
high-speed performance, laying the foundation for the aircraft&rsquo;s mid-2013 
firm configuration milestone.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Wind tunnel testing is on the critical design path of the programme. 
Based on previous work in the wind tunnel, we are confident this final phase of 
testing will substantiate our predictions of the aerodynamic performance of the 
airplane,&rdquo; Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) 737 MAX chief project 
engineer and deputy programme manager Michael Teal said.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This final phase of wind tunnel testing confirms that we are on 
track to complete our design goals and deliver the 737 MAX to customers 
beginning in 2017,&rdquo; Teal said.</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;Enginomics&rdquo;</strong><br>
 One of the primary 
objectives behind the final phase of the wind-tunnel testing is to 
&ldquo;update the model to incorporate the minor changes we&rsquo;re making for 
the MAX and the larger engine nacelles. These initial test runs will give our 
engineers a baseline of the current airplane&rsquo;s performance that they can 
compare with the MAX&rsquo;s optimised design,&rdquo; Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes (BCA) vice president (VP) of marketing Randy Tinseth said.</p> 
<p>And as the next-generation narrowbody engines featuring advanced engine 
core technologies form the centrepiece of the upgrade from the existing 
single-aisle airplanes, which delivers the bulk of the 737 MAX and 
A320neo&rsquo;s fuel-burn savings, the economics of engines, or 
&ldquo;enginomics&rdquo;, are likely to continue to be the prime focus of these 
aircraft programmes as they developments advance and progress.</p> 
<p>During the quarter, Boeing and General Electric (GE) settled on a 68.4 
inches (173.7 centimetres) engine fan size for the 737 MAX, from the previous 
fan sizes of 68 inches (172.7 cm) and the widely reported 68.75 inches (174.6 
cm).</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nailed down.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve finished all the 
installation studies, and for all practical purposes, it&rsquo;s 
done.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be a very unique installation for the 737 MAX. 
We&rsquo;re going to take full advantage of the integration we do with Boeing 
and with Spirit to make sure the overall engine-airplane combination is 
incredibly efficient from an integrated propulsion system and the engine is 
really optimised for this airplane.&rdquo;&nbsp;General Electric (GE) Aviation 
chief executive David Joyce told&nbsp;Bloomberg.</p> 
<p>As the final phase of the wind-tunnel testing is still ongoing at press 
time and the firm configuration is still a year away,&nbsp;<em>Aspire Aviation
</em>&lsquo;s sources at the Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer cautioned that 
the eventual engine fan size will remain fluid before settling on the most 
optimised one.</p> 
<p>Image Courtesy of Boeing</p> 
<p>Indeed, Boeing acknowledged to Aviation Week that future changes in engine 
fan size are possible and Aviation Week quoted 737 MAX programme official as 
saying that the company is studying a fan size as large as 69 inches (175 cm).
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;However, as detailed design work continues and we incorporate 
wind-tunnel testing results, we&rsquo;ll continue to work with CFM to refine 
the engine [including fan size] as we work towards final configuration in 
2013,&rdquo; the company was quoted as saying.</p> 
<p>Engine fan size matters since each inch increase in the fan size generally 
leads to a 0.5% reduction in engine specific fuel consumption (SFC), 
notwithstanding the penalty on the aircraft&rsquo;s overall block fuel burn due 
to increased drag and added weight.&nbsp;However, it is a delicate balance 
between engine fan size, drag and weight that is often a complicated trade-off, 
as a large engine fan size also inevitably leads to an increase in drag and 
weight, and Boeing said the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; is around 68 inches.</p> 
<p>For the 737 MAX, not only does the engine fan size affect the re-engined 
aircraft&rsquo;s overall fuel burn performance, it also has an implication on 
the modifications required to accommodate the bigger and heavier engine.</p> 
<p>For instance, the squash-bottomed 68.4-inch CFM Leap-1B engine that sits in 
a much forward position than the existing CFM56-7BE engine on the 
next-generation 737 will shift the centre of gravity (CG) of the re-engined 
aircraft forward, of which one possible solution is to adopt the 787-styled 
trailing edge variable camber (TEVC) that redistributes engineering load inward 
and also moves the centre of lift forward, thus alleviating the situation of a 
forward centre of gravity (CG). Though the adoption of a TEVC will nonetheless 
carry a drag penalty that negates the benefits of a weight saving and a forward 
centre of lift, thus making such an adoption complicated.</p> 
<p>Instead, the primary focus is reducing the weight of the engine. In doing 
so, not only could the block fuel burn penalty brought by a heavier engine be 
reduced, it could also minimise the extent to which the structural 
reinforcements need to take place, thus achieving a cumulative effect in 
reducing the overall weight, fuel burn of the 737 MAX.</p> 
<p>Given the fact that the CFM Leap-1B engine will incorporate a resin 
transfer moulding (RTM) composite blades and fan case, as well as the ceramic 
matrix composite (CMC) that will contribute 1% of saving in engine specific 
fuel consumption (SFC) but which may not mature in time for application for the 
737 MAX&rsquo;s late-2017 entry into service (EIS), achieving further 
significant weight saving on the already efficient CFM Leap-1B engine is 
difficult, albeit not impossible.</p> 
<p>According to Boeing, the 68.4 inches CFM Leap-1B engine will contribute 12% 
of the block fuel burn reduction and another 1% from aft-body aerodynamic 
improvement, which is negated by a 2% fuel burn penalty due to increased drag 
and weight, thus achieving an overall 11% block fuel burn reduction per seat 
than the 737-800 on a typical 500 nautical miles (nm) in a 2-class 162-seat 
configuration. In comparison, Boeing says the 150-seat A320neo will only be 12% 
more fuel efficient per seat than the existing A320 on a 500 nm sector, with 
13.5% and 3% reduction in block fuel burn contributed by a larger, more 
fuel-efficient engine and the adoption of blended winglets, respectively, which 
is offset by 3.5% and 1% fuel burn penalty owing to increased weight and the 
removal of wingtip fence, respectively.</p> 
<p>Airbus refutes these claims, saying the 150-seat A320neo (new engine 
option) will be 7% more fuel efficient per seat than a 157-seat 737 MAX 8 on a 
800 nautical miles (nm) mission, whereas Boeing says a 162-seat 737 MAX 8 is 5% 
more fuel efficient per seat than a 150-seat A320neo, in addition a 7% all-in 
operating cost advantage (&ldquo;Boeing 737 MAX sees a bright year ahead
&ldquo;, 20th Dec, 11).</p> 
<p>Another less likely, yet a feasible but more controversial solution, is to 
feature the Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) PurePower geared turbofan (GTF) 
engine on the 737 MAX, an industry talk that was rampant at 
the&nbsp;International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (ISTAT) conference 
in March.</p> 
<p>In doing so, not only are the structural reinforcement and modification 
required on the 737 MAX minimised, it will also further boost the market appeal 
of the 737 MAX to airlines around the world.</p> 
<p>First and foremost, adding an engine option of the Pratt &amp; Whitney 
(P&amp;W) PurePower engine provides a hedge to Boeing for these engines with 
decidedly and fundamentally different architectures. The Pratt &amp; Whitney 
(P&amp;W) PurePower geared turbofan (GTF) relies on a gearbox that allows the 
engine fan to run at a speed 3 times lower than the speed the low pressure 
turbine (LPT) spins and consists of 7 moving parts and no life-limited parts 
(LLPs).</p> 
<p>As a result, this maximises the engine&rsquo;s propulsive efficiency while 
eliminating 20%, or 7 stages of life-limited parts (LLPs) in the engine, 
leading to a 20% lower maintenance cost than the CFM56-5B engine.</p> 
<p>While Boeing and CFM have spent months refining the configuration of the 
Leap-1B engine since the 737 MAX&rsquo;s launch in August 2011, given Pratt 
&amp; Whitney&rsquo;s experience and work done on the similarly-sized PW1524G 
engine with a fan size of 73 inches powering the Bombardier CSeries, the 
world&rsquo;s third-largest engine-maker could easily design a downscaled 
PW1524G with a 71 inches (180.3 cm) fan sizes indicated by<em>Aspire Aviation
</em>&lsquo;s sources at Chicago-based airframer that fit the 737 MAX with 
minimal investment and programme risk. In addition, the downscaled PurePower 
engine could easily incorporate any lessons learned and improvements from the 
post-EIS (entry into service) flight hours amassed on the PW1524G under 
Bombardier CSeries&rsquo; wings that makes the downscaled PurePower engine on 
the 737 MAX more fuel efficient.</p> 
<p>From a performance standpoint, a 71 inches downscaled PW1524G engine could 
feasibly provide a 15% reduction in engine specific fuel consumption (SFC), 
which lost around 1% SFC saving due to a smaller engine fan from 73 inches to 
71 inches, not taking into account the reduced weight and drag that are 
compensated on the aircraft&rsquo;s block fuel burn separately. In comparison, 
the CFM Leap-1B will contribute a 12% lower engine SFC towards the 737 
MAX&rsquo;s 11% lower fuel burn per seat than the 737-800.</p> 
<p>This will increase the 11% fuel burn reduction per seat of the 737 MAX by 
an additional 2% with little extra modifications already required to 
accommodate the CFM Leap-1B engine, similar to the situation on the A320neo 
(new engine option), where the 81 inches PW1100G-JM engine will provide a 16% 
lower specific fuel consumption (SFC) than the CFM56-5B engine, while the 78 
inches CFM Leap-1A engine provides a 15% lower SFC, albeit both of them are 
being rated equal by Airbus.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, airlines will view the option of two engines favourably, 
primarily because of the lower price tag resulted from a fierce engine 
competition. What is more, some airlines have hedged their engine strategies by 
splitting the orders between the A320neo (new engine option) and 737 MAX which 
are also due to the inability of airframers delivering such a large quantity of 
fuel-efficient single-aisle jets within a short timeframe, such as American 
Airlines (AA), Norwegian Air Shuttle (NAS), etc, offering an option of 2 
engines will further improve the standing and widen the lead of the 737 MAX.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a team on the MAX considering otherwise,&rdquo; 
Boeing spokeswoman&nbsp;Lauren Penning emphasised to thePuget Sound Business 
Journal.</p> 
<p>Despite Boeing continues to downplay the addition of an extra engine option 
on the 737 MAX, it ultimately comes down to a cost and benefit analysis, with 
the improved standing in the marketplace from airlines&rsquo; and 
lessors&rsquo; perspectives against a fiercer engine competition between CFM 
and Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W), of which Boeing has a traditionally good 
relationship with CFM International&rsquo;s parent General Electric (GE).</p> 
<p>But given these engines&rsquo; vastly different architectures and upgrade 
paths, of which the CFM Leap engine is advancing materials technology and 
thermal efficiency while the Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) will utilise on an 
increase in the gear ratio possibly to 5-to-1 from 3-to-1, running the engine 
core hotter should ceramic matrix composite (CMC) mature over time and become 
cheaper to make the PurePower engine more fuel efficient (&ldquo;Special 
Report: The engine battle heats up&ldquo;, 10th May, 11), hedging between them 
with a choice of two engine options seems wise.</p> 
<p>After all, the CFM Leap-1B still holds the advantageous position of the 
installed base even after the addition of a Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) 
PurePower engine option, given the large number of CFM engines on today&rsquo;s 
industry workhorse 737 fleet, and if adding an engine option improves the 737 
MAX&rsquo;s market share and boosts its competitiveness, why not?</p> 
<p>Air Lease Corporation (ALC) chief executive Steven Udvar-Hazy concurred, 
but said&nbsp;&rdquo;I don&rsquo;t think Boeing&rsquo;s going to do it&rdquo;.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had long talks with [Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) 
chief executive Jim Albaugh] and guys over there, where I showed them the dual 
engine has helped Airbus gain market share with the A320neo family, because 
they had two choices and airlines were able to leverage that to get better 
deals.&nbsp;I just don&rsquo;t think Boeing is able to do that. I think 
they&rsquo;re kind of stuck in this situation because of the airframe,&rdquo; 
Udvar-Hazy wasquoted as saying.</p>

<p><strong>Improved payload/range performance</strong><br>
 Regardless of how 
the engine issue evolves on the Boeing 737 MAX, the 737 MAX family aircraft 
nevertheless hold an advantage over the A320neo (new engine option) on an 
all-in operating cost basis, albeit at a reduced level, and the CFM Leap-1B 
engine will be a highly-efficient engine, which<em>Aspire Aviation</em>&lsquo;s 
sources say have made progress in clawing back the rumoured 2%-3% shortfall in 
engine specific fuel consumption (SFC).</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Compared to Airbus A320neo, which is the European firm&rsquo;s 
latest single-aisle plane, the 737 MAX is 10% lighter and 5% more fuel 
efficient. Its maintenance costs 7% less.&nbsp;The 737 MAX will have the lowest 
operating costs in the single-aisle segment with a 7% advantage per seat over 
our future competition, the A320neo,&rdquo; Boeing vice president (VP) of 
marketing Randy Tinseth said.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the 737 MAX will have a slightly better payload/range performance 
than the A320neo (new engine option), if not equal.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make some minor structural enhancements to the 
737 MAX, so we can have a slightly higher maximum take-off weights so we can 
slightly increase the range of the airplane as well,&rdquo; Tinseth said on the 
Pacific Northwest Aerospace Alliance (PNAA) conference in early February.</p> 
<p>According to <em>Aspire Aviation</em>&lsquo;s multiple sources at Boeing, 
the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 will see a 3,175 kilogrammes (7,000 lbs) increase in 
maximum take-off weight (MTOW) from the winglet-equipped 737-800&prime;s 79 
tonnes (174,200 lbs) to MAX 8&prime;s 82.2 tonnes (181,200 lbs) and from 
winglet-equipped 737-900ER&rsquo;s 85.1 tonnes (187,700 lbs) to MAX 9&prime;s 
88.3 tonnes (194,700 lbs). The smaller MAX 7 sibling will see a 2,268 kg (5,000 
lbs) increase in its MTOW from winglet-equipped 737-700&prime;s 69.4 tonnes 
(153,000 lbs) to 71.7 tonnes (158,000 lbs).</p> 
<p>In comparison, Airbus said the maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of the 
A320neo (new engine option) will increase by 1 tonne (2,205 lbs) to 79 tonnes 
(174,165 lbs) from A320 weight variant WV015&prime;s 78 tonnes (171,961 lbs), 
the A320weight variant featuring the highest MTOW.</p> 
<p>In terms of range, the range of the 737 MAX 8 will be 6,426 km (3,470 nm), 
an increase of 405 nm with 162 passengers. The MAX 7 and MAX 9&prime;s ranges 
will be 3,800 nm with 126 passengers and 3,430 nm with 180 passengers, 
respectively.</p> 
<p>The existing CFM56-5B-powered A320 has a range of roughly 3,000 nm with 150 
passengers at a payload of around 13,800 kg and Airbus has said the new engine 
option will either add&nbsp;950&nbsp;km (510&nbsp;nm) to range, or 
2&nbsp;tonnes (4,400&nbsp;lbs) in additional payload. The CFM56-5B-powered A319 
has a range of roughly 3,200 nm with 124 passengers at a payload of around 
11,000 kg. The CFM56-5B-powered A321 has a range of roughly 3,000 nm with 185 
passengers at a payload of around 17,000 kg, according to payload/range 
graphics on Airbus&rsquo;aircraft characteristics documents.</p> 
<p>On an apple-to-apple basis with the same payload on both 737 MAX 8 and 
A320neo at 13,800 kg and all increase in payload is used to boost range, the 
737 MAX 8 will have the 737-800&prime;s range at a payload of 13,800 kg of 
approximately 3,240 nautical miles (nm), plus the addition of 405 nm due to the 
re-engining. Simply put, the 737 MAX 8 will have a range of approximately 3,645 
nm, more than the A320neo&rsquo;s approximately 3,510 nm.</p> 
<p>Similarly using the aforementioned Airbus document and Boeing&rsquo;s chart
, the A321neo will have a range of approximately 3,510 nm whereas the 737 MAX 9 
will have a range of 3,430 nm. The A319neo will have a range of approximately 
3,710 nm versus the 737 MAX 7&prime;s range of 3,800 nm.</p> 
<p>Therefore, the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 8 are slightly better in range than the 
A319neo and A320neo, respectively, whereas the 737 MAX 9 will be slightly 
inferior to the A321neo in range.</p> 
<p>In addition, Boeing is actively evaluating more weight-reduction and drag 
reduction initiatives in order to make the 737 MAX more aerodynamically and 
more fuel efficient, and it looks increasingly likely that this year&rsquo;s 
continuous lower energy emissions noise (CLEEN) programme, scheduled to take 
place this late third-quarter on board an American Airlines (AA) Boeing 737-800 
in collaboration with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), will be a 
springboard for testing these initiatives, especially the drag reduction ones.
</p> 
<p>For example, Aviation Week reported the 737 MAX will feature an improved 
trailing edge from the CLEEN programme, incorporating the &ldquo;mini-split 
flap&rdquo; technology, a&nbsp;re-rigged outboard flap and drooped aileron, 
whereas<em>Aspire Aviation</em>&lsquo;s sources at the Chicago-based airframer 
say the test results of the variable area fan nozzle (VAFN) will also be 
watched closely on whether it delivers the promised 2% fuel burn saving.</p> 
<p>The variable area fan nozzles (VAFN) system relies on a FADEC (Full 
Authority Digital Engine Control) to protect the fan against fluttering in the 
open position and could possibly cut 2% of fuel burn. The VAFN could also 
reduce noise in the intermediate position during climb.</p> 
<p>The 737 MAX will also feature a reshaped pressure-relief port cavity, a 
787-styled&nbsp;tail cone that incorporates a&nbsp;relofted design with the 
elimination of vortex generators, and a new design of the inlet door of the 737 
MAX&rsquo;s auxiliary power unit (APU) that features a &ldquo;retractable 
intake door&rdquo; found on other Boeing airplanes instead of the existing NACA 
APU inlet door design on the next-generation 737.</p> 
<p><strong>Re-engined airplanes not a long-term solution?</strong><br>
 The 
founder and chief executive of Air Lease Corporation (ALC), Steven Udvar Hazy, 
the godfather of the aircraft-leasing industry, suggested the notion that the 
737 MAX is &ldquo;not a long-term solution&rdquo; and while the 737 has 
&ldquo;been a great bus for the industry, but at some point Boeing&rsquo;s 
going to have to deal with it. Right now, I think the focus has been getting 
the [787-10X] launched and firming the competitive response to the A350 with 
its 777X&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Hazy also commented that the 737 MAX still holds &ldquo;a distinct 
advantage&rdquo; against the A320neo (new engine option) despite a 10,000 lbs 
weight growth in the 737 MAX&rsquo;s weight.</p> 
<p>First of all, <em>Aspire Aviation</em>&lsquo;s multiple sources at Boeing 
confirmed that the 10,000 lbs weight growth figure is &ldquo;inaccurate&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;way off mark&rdquo;, and that the increase in the 737 MAX&rsquo;s 
manufacturers&rsquo; empty weight (MEW) is currently between 2.0 tonnes (4,500 
lbs) and 2.5 tonnes (5,500 lbs), whereas the MEW of the A320neo (new engine 
option) has increased by 1.7 tonnes (3,748 lbs) on the CFM Leap-1A-powered 
A320neo and 1.8 tonnes (3,968 lbs) on the PW1100G-JM-powered version.</p> 
<p>Despite the weight growth, the 737 MAX variants nonetheless hold the weight 
advantage in being lighter than the A320neo (new engine option) variants. The 
737-900ER with winglet has an operating empty weight (OEW) of 44.7 tonnes 
(98,495 lbs) whereas the CFM-powered version and International Aero Engines 
(IAE) V2500-powered version of the A321 have an OEW of 46.9 tonnes (103,300 
lbs) and 47 tonnes (103,527 lbs), respectively.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the business case of re-engined aircraft such as the Boeing 737 
MAX, A320neo (new engine option) and the re-engined E-Jet remains sound, as 
airlines&rsquo; demand for fuel efficient aircraft ever grows in light of 
skyrocketing jet kerosene prices.</p> 
<p>Most importantly, the game-changing small twin-aisle that airlines and 
lessors are looking for, simply will not be available until 2025 or so. The key 
enabler of such a game-changing small twin-aisle aircraft that features 
containerised cargo system, fast turnaround times and significant reductions in 
cash operating costs (COC), the 2nd or 3rd-generation composites with 
out-of-autoclave (OoA) technology, such as Australia&rsquo;s&nbsp;Quickstep
&nbsp;that trims the curing time by a dramatic 43%, a higher delamination 
resistance and a higher fibre-matrix adhesion achieved through &ldquo;lower 
initial resin viscosity&rdquo;, is emerging and will require time to mature and 
find its way into wider aerospace applications, as are nanotechnologies such as 
the carbon nanotubes reinforced polymer (CNRP) on the Lockheed Martin F-35 
Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) that promise to be 17% stronger and yet 
30% lighter than the carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) found on 50% of the 
787 Dreamliner by weight.</p> 
<p>And as Boeing invests its financial and engineering resources into the 
double-stretched 787-10X and the potentially game-changing 777X late this year 
(&ldquo;Boeing develops 777X to challenge Airbus A350&ldquo;, 9th Feb, 12), an 
incremental upgrade of the single-aisle product, the 737 MAX, is the proper 
strategy going forward before the 3rd-generation composite technologies mature 
and enable the launch of a game-changing small twin-aisle aircraft that 
replaces the 757 and complements the existing 737 MAX aircraft family, not 
necessarily &ldquo;killing&rdquo; the 737 MAX or its Airbus counterparts 
altogether.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Our intention is that we will build the MAX until the market 
doesn&rsquo;t want to buy any more and we don&rsquo;t know when that&rsquo;s 
going to be.&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t predict 2025 or 2035, at some point, either 
something better will come along or the marketplace will decide they 
won&rsquo;t continue to take it. We&rsquo;ll make it until it runs out of gas 
and that could be a long, long time,&rdquo; Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) 
senior vice president (SVP) of marketing Mike Bair said.</p> 
<p>As for this decade, Boeing&rsquo;s priorities will be making the 737 MAX as 
best as possible, launch the 777X and 787-10X, while ramping up production by 
40% across its product lines within the next few years, that would pretty much 
make Boeing&rsquo;s plates full.</p> 
<p>In particular, Boeing simply cannot afford to repeat its past mistake of a 
unsatisfactory programme execution on the 737 MAX, along with the 777X and 
787-10X, and especially so when Boeing officials have indicated they want to 
advance the 737 MAX&rsquo;s entry into service (EIS) date.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a decent chance they can actually beat that 
target,&rdquo; 737 MAX launch customer Southwest Airlines chief executive Gary 
Kelly told theDow Jones Newswires.</p> 
<p>Last but not least, the sales prospect of the 737 MAX remains bullish and 
Boeingexpects to receive 200 737 MAX orders from China this year to satisfy the 
world&rsquo;s second-largest aviation market&rsquo;s burgeoning air travel 
demand, and the strong underlying demand for re-engined aircraft, combined with 
a strong backlog, should insulate or minimise any risks should this upward 
industry cycle be halted by any unforeseen events in this volatile global 
economy. Though one thing is sure against this backdrop of a volatile global 
economy and this especially cyclical aerospace sector: the contentious debate 
on each airplane&rsquo;s merits will continue unabated, both in good times and 
the bad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Engine fan size matters since each inch increase in the fan size 
generally leads to a 0.5% reduction in engine specific fuel consumption (SFC), 
notwithstanding the penalty on the aircraft&rsquo;s overall block fuel burn due 
to increased drag and added weight. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>- The NEO / MAX use the same engines, but NEO has s 10 inch bigger fan 
size, so a 5 % better sfc?<br>
 - The NEO&rsquo;s GTF option probably provides 
a few % extra better sfc.<br>
 - Same for the sharklets, the NEO will get a 2-3 
% better sfc, the MAX won&rsquo;t this improvement.<br>
 - SUH saying the OEW 
of the MAX will grow by 10.000lbs. Say he&rsquo;s 50% of the mark and 
it&rsquo;s 5.000lbs the (often quoted but rather small) OEW advantage of the 
737 is simply gone!</p> 
<p>We can quote Randy/Jim all we want, but I guess the writing is on the wall 
here. Please jump to conclusions!</p> 
<p>Furthermore it has become clear SW paid less then 40 million for their 737 
MAX aircraft (60% discount),
http://aviationblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/12/why-we-think-southwest-airline.html
 and Lionair (nobody knows what this small, poor, banned airline is gonna do 
with them) got the aircraft with full US government support / financing.</p> 
<p>Sole 737 operators AA and Norwegian &ldquo;split&rdquo; the deal with 
Airbus (AA took a telling 365(!) NEO options next to the 130CEO 130NEO order, 
&ldquo;625 orders and commitments&rdquo; anyone? ).</p> 
<p>&ldquo;offering an option of 2 engines will further improve the standing 
and widen the lead of the 737 MAX.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Looking at specs and orders I&rsquo;m not sure what lead the 737 MAX has. 
Looking back at the broken promises we have seen in recent yrs and the 180 
Boeing did on the 737 re-engining I guess consulting both parties on MAX vs NEO 
comparisons might be wise. The baselines Boeing invented to compare the 
aircraft (the NG is waaaay better, in hindsight..) have dramatically changed 
during the last 12 months and are not used by anyone but Boeing itself.</p> 
<p>I guess exiting times behind closed doors at Boeing HQ, were the real 
numbers are on the table. If not provided by Boeings own specialists, bluntly 
and un-supportive by visiting the airlines.<br>

<p>keesje,</p> 
<p>For keeping the record straight, the 4,500 lbs-5,500 lbs increase on the 
737 MAX&rsquo;s weight is MEW, manufacturer&rsquo;s empty weight, not 
airline-specific operating empty weight (OEW).</p> 
<p>They are very different and Airbus &amp; Boeing&rsquo;s calculation methods 
are different as well. Because Airbus excludes seats, interiors in calculating 
MEW whereas Boeing does include some seats &amp; interiors item in calculating 
MEW. It could distort the figures by as many as 2-4 tonnes, quite considerable 
for a 79-tonne MTOW A320neo &amp; 737 MAX 8&prime;s MTOW of 82.2 tonnes. 
Therefore on an apple-to-apple basis with the same rules, the 737 MAX&rsquo;s 
weight advantage in MEW should be bigger than it appears, should you want a 
comparison to this precise level.</p> 
<p>Airline-specific OEW includes some standard items, personnel such as 
crew&rsquo;s weight, equipment such as catering cart, and supplies such as 
water, excluding usable fuel &amp; payload.</p> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>VV,</p> 
<p>The CFM56-5B has an engine fan size of 68.3 inches and -7B 61 inches.</p> 
<p>The CFM56-5B4 on A320-214 producing 27,000 lbs has a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; (not 
cruise) SFC of 0.337 lb/lbf hr, the CFM56-5B3 powering A321-211 with 32,000 lbs 
of thrust is 0.356 lb/lbf hr, CFM56-5B6 powering A319-112 with 23,500 lbs of 
thrust is 0.327 lb/lbf hr.</p> 
<p>Figures already featured 2007&prime;s Tech Insertion on Airbus&rsquo; CFM 
engines. The &ldquo;Evolution&rdquo; upgrade package was not adopted by Airbus.
</p> 
<p>In comparison, the CFM56-7BE incorporating 1.5% reduction in SFC (which 
exceeded original 1% SFC saving target) and the 2007 Tech Insertion already 
shaving 1% is around 0.361 lb/lbr hr.</p> </li>

<p>You are using the &ldquo;Cruise SFC&rdquo;, which is a different measure of 
the &ldquo;Dry SFC&rdquo; I used. Both are correct, though.</p> 
<p>But your figures for -5B4 and -7B20 did not take into account the CFM Tech

<p>Daniel, </p> 
<p>I think the concept of CFM willing to do a better job for Boeing then for 
Airbus is just hope. For the CFM56 as well as the LEAP. They are the basically 
the same engines and enhancements are transferred to other members of the 
family if they are worthwhile. The operators/ owners demand it.<br>

<p>The A320 burns a few % little less fuel (also according to Boeing) but the 
737-800 can spread it out over more seats (of course Boeing says many, Airbus a 
few), if the load factor is close to 100%. What always made me wonder why 
Airbus specified the A320 and A321 as they did. The 737-700, -800 and -900 is a 
gradual build up. When Airbus specified the A321, it seems they went as long as 
they could get. The 737-800 and 737-900 are both in between the A320 and A321 
in terms of length. I always thought Airbus at some point would do a 200 seat 
version inbetween the A320 and A321, there&rsquo;s a gab of nearly 8 meters / 8 
seat rows.. Ryanair and Jetblue asked for it.</p>

<p>320.5 seems like the obvious move. Airbus could make a sweet machine by 
stretching the A320 three or four meters. No extra doors and no center tank 
mean less weight. Range will be less than the new A320, but with the new 
engines probably still better than the old A320.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>

<p>Keesje, your number for the -5B4 for cruise sfc is way way too low. If the 
-5B4 would be really 13.9% better than the -7B20, the A320 family would be way 
better in fuel burn than the B737 family. As a starting point take 0.6 for the 
V2500 and add something like 2-3% for the -5B.</p>

<p>We can discuss the exact numbers but the -5B is significantly more 
efficient then the -7 because of its higher BPR and uncompromised air inlet.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular believe the A320 burns a little less then the 737-800 
and the A320 NEO will most probably have a lower OEW then the 737-800. It has 
better payload-range capability, cargo container/pallet capability, a spacier, 
quieter cabin and was already outselling/ outproducing/ outbacklogging the 
737NG BEFORE the NEO/MAX. Specially if we look at new operators that had the 
option to go for A or B. I have yet to discover an airline willing to switch 
from the A320 family to the 737 MAX.</p> 
<p>I think Boeing has a problem. For us av geeks good news because they most 
probably will (have to) come up with innovation to re-balance the NB market 
earlier then they hoped.</p>

<p>Keesje, please don&rsquo;t trust the numbers from the second source &ndash; 
or do you really believe that the GE90-76B has the same SFC as the CFM56-5B4? 
Or that the Trent772 has an even higher SFC (0.565 in that table, seems 
reasonable though). The first source seems to be more realistic, but only 
takeoff sfc is given there. Relationship between two engines at cruise should 
be similar though.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li>

<p>Keesje,</p> 
<p>You are truly an Airbus sockpuppet! The day you say something nice about a 
Boeing, I&rsquo;ll start shorting EADs stock in large quantities. The truth of 
the matter is that every Boeing in service today has kicked the pants off its 
Airbus counterpart. The A330 might be the only exception, but the 767 is really 
just a smaller aircraft that continues to sell well nonetheless. The 777 
literally killed off the A340, and the 737NG still holds high single digit seat 
cost advantages over the A320 family. The only reason the 320 has sold so well 
is because of a massive 737 backlog and deep discounting made possible by 
massive and illegal EU subsidies.</p> 
<p>Based on history, I see no reason to doubt that the Max will be superior to 
the NEO. Boeing&rsquo;s wing technology is simply more advanced than 
Airbus&rsquo;. You can see that just by looking at them. The 747-8 is testimony 
to this as the aircraft continues to outperform expectations despite being 
overweight and hanging GEnx engines that have missed SFC by some margin. While 
the 787 program is looking like a train wreck, the composite technologies on 
the aircraft are at least 5 years ahead of Airbus and the A350, which looks 
likely to incur massive delays.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Airbus does not build good airplanes. They do. 
It&rsquo;s just that they lack the engineering horsepower that Boeing employs, 
despite the fancy cockpits which pilots seem to like. Time will tell, but my 
prediction is that Boeing will continue to enjoy superior pricing for superior 
products which explains why the company is more profitable than EADs by about 
100% in terms of return on investment (ROI).</p>

<p>While I can dismiss most of your post as baseless cheerleading, I agree on 
the 767/A330.</p> 
<p>Two different segments. A real good 767/A330/A310 replacement doesn&rsquo;t 
exist IMO. The A330/787/A350 are way heavier, bigger and more expensive to buy 
and operate. The longer 737s and A320s way smaller and less capable. I guess at 
some point Airbus will beef up the A321 (A322 ?
http://i191.photobucket.com/albums/z160/keesje_pics/A322NEOTATLwithLOPA.jpg ) 
and/or (hopefully) Boeing will bite the bullet and come up with a real 757/767 
replacement, unbeatable at 200-280 seats up to 5000NM for TATL, transcon, intra 
Asia, Leisure etc.</p>

<p>Keesje,</p> 
<p>With all due respect, the 787-8 (albeit these figures are for a/c after LN 
90) is a very good 767 replacement.</p> 
<p>It has lower trip costs at essentially every distance, 15-20% more range, 
and 5-9% more seats depending on configuration. More revenue potential at a 
lower absolute trip cost, and more capable to boot.</p>

<p>Vinay, the 787/A330 are empty 20-30 t heavier then the 767, don&rsquo;t fit 
the domestic ICAO Cat D gates and carry many more passengers in real world 
configurations. The A330 and 787 are optimized long haul machines as 
ANA/JAL/Boeing found out with the 787-3. If you need something larger the a 
A321/739, the 787/A330 is double size/costs..</p>

<p>Keesje,</p> 
<p>The 767 today operates very few domestic routes, even United is pulling 
them from domestic to more lucrative international routes. Outside of 1200 nm 
or so, the 787 is far more efficient than the 767, cost-side. And any short 
haul route that sees the 767 can likely handle the 787 as well</p> </li> </ul>

<p>The 737 MAX so far has not restored the balance. Not in terms of specs nor 
in terms of sales.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of hope, but as far as I can see (LionAir, SW, AA, 
Norwegian, all special deals), the jury is still out on the Boeing 737 MAX. 
Saying parity has been re-established 99 times doesn&rsquo;t help.</p> 
<p>As big 737 operator rather un-elegant Ryanair CEO said: </p> 
<p>O&rsquo;Leary said all evidence Ryanair has seen indicates that 
Boeing&rsquo;s MAX, &ldquo;as a product, is rubbish.&rdquo; The Airbus neo, 
announced before the Boeing model, &ldquo;does credibly deliver&rdquo; a 12 to 
14 percent saving on fuel burn, he said, while the C919 is a 
&ldquo;glorified&rdquo; version of the A320 and thus lacks development risk.</p>

<p>keesje,</p> 
<p>Please keep in mind that these are just &ldquo;best guesses&rdquo; from me, 
so to speak.</p> 
<p>But, that being said, </p> 
<p>my estimates have the 737 MAX 8 beating the A320neo on operating costs all 
in (keeping in mind that price is a component), as well as excluding price, by 
1-2% primarily because of larger size.</p> 
<p>The 321neo should have a tangible (3-5%) advantage over 737 MAX 9, and 
319neo v 737 MAX 7 is a wash because both are soundly beaten by the C-Series.
</p> 
<p>Michael O&rsquo;Leary is a master of playing the press; his words on the 
C919 are essentially a negotiating ploy to get lower prices from Boeing, but 
Boeing might not be willing to deal this time, as they don&rsquo;t have much 
margin on Ryanair NGs. Airbus and MOL aren&rsquo;t exactly the best of friends, 
and if MOL were truly serious about C919, then he&rsquo;d lose his very 
lucrative resale business.</p> 
<p>And remember, there is indication that Boeing might add a GTF option for 
the MAX, which would lower fuel burn potentially.</p> 
<p>The overarching point is that we tend to get caught up in the numbers put 
out by Boeing and Airbus without realizing that they are not comparing 
&ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; so to speak. Please see here for an overview of 
the jargon used by both OEMs to skew the figures.</p>

<p>As for the MAX 7 and 319NEO, there is the CSeries plus the MAX 8 and 320NEO 
are a better value. For most of the life of the 737-700, Boeing has produced 
about 20 in the first quarter of the year versus just one for the first quarter 
of this year.</p> 
<p>Why don&rsquo;t Boeing and Airbus redefine the lenths of the entire NEO and

aircraft anyway.</p> </li>

<p>Vinay, for both the MAX and NEO I have seen engines, BPR&rsquo;s, sharklets 
and modification weight gains. Without listening to anything Airbus or Boeing 
say, physics kick in &amp; the writing is on the wall. I simply have not seen 
any MAX numbers that make me believe the aircraft will outdo the A320 NEO.</p> 
<p>Boeing now claims the 737-800NG was far better anyway. Fact is the CFM56-5B 
engines had a 8-10% better sfc then the -7B (
http://www.togo84.com/spec05_gas_turbines.pdf ) and the OEW advantage for the 
737-800 was marginal / if any at all. Maybe the -800 has bigger fuel tanks and 
flies further. The seat count advantage for the -800 would be relevant only on 
flights that are sold out. How many are those?</p> 
<p>BTW, I don&rsquo;t think it is unlikely at one point Airbus will build the 
A320 Plus to close the 40 seat gab between the A320 and A321..

<p>Keesje,</p> 
<p>Independent estimates from various sources at airlines, as well as a few 
public ones (such as one from Lufthansa a proud A320 operator), give an average 
of around 2-4% operating cost advantage to 737-800 over A320 all in, varying 
based on network composition. This advantage largely evaporates when you add in 
things like commonality with the 319 and 321, and other factors, but

<p>I think we already knew the A320-200 is a few tons lighter then the 
737-800. Some try to mistify by introducing OEW, ZFW and MEW. It is confirmed 
by these customer configurations. The -5B engines also have a 8-10% lower sfc 
then the 737-800. The 737 flies further because it has bigger fuel tanks, also 
visible in your link. That doesn&rsquo;t change the endlessly stimulated 
perception that the 737 is lighter / more efficient though. I&rsquo;ve given 
up, many just do not want to know &amp; simply block/ ignore. Boeing is better 
and if not, you are biased. Its all speculation because Boeing did not confirm. 
Until Boeing admits themselves by changing course. Then its a smart move &amp; 
the new party line is quickly embraced &amp; endorsed.</p>

<p>Keesje,</p> 
<p>Is the implication of your statement that I am biased towards Boeing? 
Because I don&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s a fair characterization based on the 
work I do.</p> 
<p>Secondly, typical OEW for the A320 is larger than that of the 737-800, I 
don&rsquo;t even see how that&rsquo;s a question.</p> 
<p>Third, your figures for sfc are from 2005, sfc for engines isn&rsquo;t 
static, the delta is different today. Sfc is different than block fuel burn, 
which is the truly important measure in comparing aircraft. And the difference 
in fuel burn between the two aircraft is minimal enough that the 737-800 has an 
advantage in block fuel burn per seat by virtue of its 5-8% advantage in size.

<p>Looking at the 72&Prime; GTF for the CSeries and the 81&Prime; GTF for the 
NEO, the GTF seems to take advantage of a larger slower fan. Reducing that to 
68&Prime; for the MAX and speeding it up may negate some of the efficency

<p>Hi Tcook,</p> 
<p>All sources are indicating a 71&Prime; GTF for the 737 MAX &amp; 
Boeing&rsquo;s decision to lengthen the nose landing gear by 8&Prime; may help 
enable that to happen.</p> 
<p>Best,<br>

<p>Yes, the PW1524G would make a nice addition to the 737. With the head start 
on the CSeries, I wonder if it could be delivered in 2016 on the MAX? A 24Klb 
GTF on a lightweight MAX 7.5 could be the ultimate 149 seat aircraft.</p> </li>

<p>Vinay,</p> 
<p>Why do you feel that the CS300 will beat both the MAX-7 and the 319neo so 
easily? While I haven&rsquo;t seen a very good breakdown yet of which MAX/neo 
variants are being ordered, it certainly seems like airlines are vastly 
preferring the MAX/neo over the CSeries, which has only 158 orders despite 
being available for 4 years. I realize Bombardier is the new kid in this size 
class, and both B and A are targetting them heavily, but that&rsquo;s still a 
huge disparity given that the MAX and neo were only launched 4 and 15 months 
ago, respectively. Future article topic?</p> 
<p>Also, do you think it would be at all viable for Boeing or Airbus to look 
into Al-Li technology and/or composite re-winging a la the 777x for the 
MAX/neo? I remember we covered some of this ground in the article about the 
potential A330neo, and I&rsquo;d imagine the primary issue would be the 
timeline and resource committment, as you said it would be for the 330. 
Nonetheless, could we see one or both companies look into this as they continue 
desperately striving for the competitive edge?</p> </li>

<p>AVIAPONCHO,</p> 
<p>It is interesting to note that the 737-800 has one or more rows compared to 
the A320. I guess it make a kind of advantage in term of seat-mile cost. I 
think it also increase a better revenue potential. Did I get it wrong?</p>

<p>VV</p> 
<p>The 737-800 has typically a 7-12 seat advantage over the A320, (5-8%), 
which does create a &ldquo;seat&rdquo; advantage in CASM ( in the sense that 
737-800 can have higher trip cost than A320 and still have lower CASM.</p> 
<p>More seats = More revenue potential so yes</p>

<p>truth, however, it does imply that larger is per definition better. It 
helps when the flight is sold out. Not sure what percentage of flights that is. 
And take impacts total operating revenues. It seems the a320 uses a little less 
fuel on average (engine sfc, weight) specially on flights longer then 500nm. 
How that works out depends on operations and markets.</p> </li> </ul> </li>
