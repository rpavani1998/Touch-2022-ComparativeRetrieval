<p>Hi all, I just got in an argument with a friend of mine on whether or not 
Boeing is subsidized by the US government. I know Airbus is but I thought that 
Boeing was completely privately owned by shareholders and did not receive 
subsidies from the gov't. I understand they get military contracts and so forth 
but am I correct in saying they dont get any handouts to develop new planes?<br>
<br> Thanks,<br>

<p></p> I heard the argument! It was a brutal back and forth heated battle 
between two aviation enthusiasts, it was definitely something I'd pay money for 
to rewind on TiVo!<br>
<br>
 As for the topic, I am also very curious to know 
if Boeing is subsidized. I would think they would be for their military divison?

 Boeing 
gets tax cuts to set up shop in a particular area be it inWA or elsewhere , 
they get tax insentives just like any other aerospace or large production house 
gets for setting up a shop in a particular area and contributing to the 
economic development of that region through employment and buisness generation 
. Boeing gets defence contracts through its Integrated defence and Phantom 
works devision but has to compete for those contracts in one of the most cut 
throat defence industries anywhere in the world (BA-ID is second to LMA and in 
many ways have lost due to various reasons) . Those contracts might be for 
product development , technology development , procurment etc etc and FIXED 
profits are given to boeing as per US laws and dealings with the DOD . Boeing 
is not owned by the US govt (atleast i am not aware of it) and is a publically 
traded company with many share holders (some own more then others) . Boeing 
does not Get launch aids from the US govt to start a particular jet development 
, it hires sub contractors who compete amongst themselves for the lucrative 
contracts and get tax breaks etc to be more competitve so that they win over 
others .<br>

<p></p> Depends upon how you define subsidy but - they have both received some 
sort of direct and indirect subsidies in the past.<br>

<p></p> The US Government and Boeing have a deep financial relationship. 
Mostly, it goes like this: Boeing sells aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, 
logistics and service products. The US Government buys these products.<br>
<br>

 Given a 5% profit margin (in 2005), Boeing made about $1.5B profit from $30B 
in defense sales, mostly to the Pentagon and NASA.<br>
<br>
 Perfectly legal. 
Is it a subsidy, no. Is it a big financial connection, yes.<br>

 Yes, but when 
companies are required to sell things to the government at a loss, that usually 
happens in despotic nations. Give us discounted stuff or we'll shut you down is 
not the &quot;american way&quot; though of course it happens on a smaller scale 
on the local and county level (some cities and counties).<br>

<p></p> There is a foreign sales tax credit Boeing gets as an aircraft 
manufacturer - the tax they pay on exports is reduced below that of the norm.
<br> <br>
 Boeing has also received fairly significant bonds and grants from 
foreign countries wanting 787 construction - Italy, Japan et al.<br>
<br>
 This 
topic cannot go anywhere good, its been done to death - literally. I hope it 
gets locked before it gets ugly.<br>

<i> &quot;It's ironic that Boeing CEO Harry Stonecipher 
wants to step up complaints about Airbus 'subsidies,'<b>considering Boeing's 
7E7 will have up to $6 billion of 'subsidies' from Japan, Italy and the United 
States</b> (Washington State),&quot; says Pritchard, who studies the 
globalization of the commercial aircraft industry.<br>
<br>
 &quot;But there 
are two major differences between an Airbus A380 'subsidy' and Boeing 7E7 
'subsidy,'&quot; Pritchard points out.<br>
<br>
 The Airbus subsidy is in the 
form of repayable loans with interest for aircraft development, which is legal 
according to the World Trade Organization, Pritchard says. The Boeing subsidy, 
on the other hand, is for aircraft production, which is prohibited by the WTO 
and which never will be paid back, he says.</i> <br>

 Well said. Boeing gets indirect government

 How is it 
support ?? You can also claim that boeing gets indirect support from the 
airlines that it sells its aircrafts to aswell !! Boeing offers products to USAF
.USA,USN and USMC in addition to NASA and other foreign militaries and gets a % 
of profit for its products . I am sure EADS does the same thing when UK , 
Germany , Spain , Austria , France etc buy their military hardware from it !! 
They are both selling a product to a customer with the EADS's military devision 
and theID devision and that product has to compete with other manufacterers 
which in US are likes of Lockheed martin , Northrop Grumman , Bae ,GD etc etc .

<br> Ridiculous.<br>
 They have loans, not subsidies, and they use it because 
it is offered and allowed by treaty, and financially interesting for them, not 
because they are weak.<br>

<p></p> As I've said before, both of the OEMs sit in front of the governmental 
trough as much as possible in numerous ways, and neither comes to the 
&quot;subsidies&quot; debate with &quot;clean hands.&quot; IMO, any attempt to 
sort out or adjudicate which OEM has cleaner hands with regard to governmental 
aid/subsidies is truly a fool's errand; the ultimate case of chasing one's own 
tail. In short, a real circle jerk.<br>

<i>As I've said before, both of the

<p></p> The US governement (Im-Ex Bank) financed 777 &amp; 787 contracts to 
e.g. Air Canada, Air India and Emirates. They say that played a big role in 
getting the contracts.<br>
<br>
 IDS is a much bigger &amp; more profitable 
business for Boeing then commercial aviation. The relations with Dod are very 
close. An ethics program was launched to set clear bounderies.<br>
<br>
 Also 
putting high pressure on states with government owned Airlines in China, Israel 
and Japan can be qualified as strong government support I guess.<br>
<br>
 
&quot;Subsidy&quot; is a bad word in the US. Giving support, financing, 
creating / saving jobs, leveling the playing field, protecting US interest etc. 
however are generally accepted.<br>

 Ex-Im is simply a financal arm, and makes profit 
just like any other state bank (including the state banks in Germany that do 
the same for European products) do. It's not a subsidy in any way shape or form.
