<title>Boeing Delays</title>
<body>
NOT ACCEPTABLE !!!!! <br>
 &nbsp; I have to admit that when Airbus was 
struggling with their string of A380 delays, I found the reading quite 
enjoyable.&nbsp; As each of their promises evaporated and their top management 
got the boot and their credibility fell to zero, I thought how much better we 
were than they.&nbsp; <i><b> &quot;Then rejoice in your brother's progress and 
</b></i> <i>Judge not, lest ye be judged&quot;&nbsp; </i>would have been a more 
benevolent thought process.&nbsp; And, it turns out, I was thinking of the<i>old
</i>Boeing, not, apparently, the Boeing of today.&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<p> Boeing has lost &quot;the touch.&quot;&nbsp; To the group of people known 
as its retirees, (myself included), it's a source of pain and chagrin.&nbsp; 
For they remember 'back when.'&nbsp; Our alma mater's 75 year hard won 
reputation for excellence, honesty, credibility, and 'can-do', are being 
frittered away.&nbsp; Steadily. &nbsp;Quickly. &nbsp;Its management are 
demonstrably incompetent, people selected in a committee environment to meet 
goals unrelated to the business, and promoted without the required skill sets 
or experience.&nbsp; Its ethics problems are the meat of pundits, and have cost 
major contracts, bidding opportunities, and huge fines.&nbsp; And caused 
embarrassment - especially for us retirees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its programs are 
hopelessly delayed and over budget.&nbsp; Almost all of them.&nbsp; It excuses 
abject program performance with almost incoherent whining and drivel.&nbsp; 
It's employee relations, despite fancy talk and metrics, are perpetually 
strained.&nbsp; It's business model seems more a reflection of the 'fad of the 
month' club and in any event is poorly executed.&nbsp; Our Dean Thornton 
&quot;God-given&quot; market share has fallen below 50%.&nbsp; Its financials 
continue to be supported by legacy programs that have existing production lines 
and large backlogs.&nbsp; When those backlogs get worked off, or melt away in 
the current economic environment, the day of inevitable reckoning will be 
nigh.&nbsp; Like the car companies and mortgage brokers, the hand writing is on 
the wall, and has been for a long time, and the unraveling, it seems, always 
comes, and always occurs faster than expected.&nbsp; If not for an equally 
incompetent competitor in a duopoly, the end would have perhaps come already.
</p> Over and over and over again, the P.R. Dept cranks out statements like 
these <br>
<br>
&quot;While we have made some progress over the past several 
weeks completing work on our early production airplanes and improving parts 
availability across the production system, the pace of that progress has not 
been sufficient to support our previous plans for first delivery or first 
flight,&quot; said Scott Carson, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes.&quot;We deeply regret the impact these delays will have on our 
customers, and we are committed to working with them to minimize any disruption 
to their plans.&quot; <br>
<br>

<p>You've heard those tired old press conferences that sports coaches have 
with the media after yet another loss.&nbsp; Yeah, I'm talking the Mariners, 
the Huskies, the Seahawks.&nbsp; 100 season losses, or a winless season, and 
the Coach says how proud he is of his players, how hard they've worked under 
adversity, yadda yadda.&nbsp; Losers!&nbsp; This is the talk of losers.</p> 
<p> These days, it's 'Boeing talk.'&nbsp; Most of those coaches get the 
gate.&nbsp; Right in mid-season.&nbsp; Boeing needs to be giving some of their 
losers the gate too - before it's too late - and a lot of them are right at the 
top. &nbsp;And stop the Double Talk!<br>

The 787 &quot;Rolled Out&quot; &nbsp;on 8 July 2007 - (7/8/07 - get 
it?) - with Tom Brokaw and Jim McNerney presiding.<br>

It now appears that 
it will be TWO YEARS from Rollout to First Flight<br>
<br>
</p> Virtually ALL 
Boeing airplanes have made their First Flights within 3-4 months following 
Rollout. <br>
<br>
How many people would deem that &quot;a success&quot;? 
<p>Scott Carson would......</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> &quot;Pat's experience and proven record managing demanding and 
complex programs will allow him to build on the 787 team's success. &nbsp;He 
knows how to deliver results, ... and has the leadership skills to get the job 
done.&quot; <br>

<br>
I prefer to remember 
the winning coaches, and their teams in sports.&nbsp; Guys like Vince Lombardi, 
Tom Landry, Bill Parcels.&nbsp; They were leaders and they were managers.&nbsp;
&nbsp; 'Winning isn't Everything - it's the ONLY thing!'&nbsp;Boeing used to 
operate that way - we made schedule.&nbsp; We had our own star coaches.&nbsp; 
T. Wilson.&nbsp; Dean Thornton.&nbsp; Harold Haynes.&nbsp; Joe Sutter.&nbsp; Ed 
Wells.&nbsp; Jack Steiner. The list is long.&nbsp; We were a schedule driven 
company.&nbsp; We had the right engineering.&nbsp; The right 
manufacturing.&nbsp; The Right Stuff.&nbsp; Now, we clearly have none of the 
above.&nbsp; We're adrift, apparently without rudder or captain.&nbsp; 
Actually, as I'll show below, we're going backwards.&nbsp; Fast. <br>
<br>
<br>

NO!&nbsp; NOT ACCEPTABLE !!!<br>
<br>
Boeing announces program delay <br>
<br>

Yes, I know - you've seen this unending string of 787 delay announcements 
before.&nbsp; Embarrassing, aren't they?&nbsp; Oh! - this isn't the 787.&nbsp; 
Not even the 747-8. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
It's the 767 Freighter conversion program 
- the 767-200SF.&nbsp; Confirmed&nbsp; 1 Dec 2008, the program developed with 
Alenia of Italy &quot;has been hampered by a series of engineering hurdles and 
is running more than a year late.&quot;&nbsp; This exclusive licensing 
agreement was signed in October 2003 - yes, that's over 5 years ago, and is 
using Boeing Type Certificate data, engineering and tooling from new built 767 
Freighters.&nbsp;It's taking longer to convert a freighter than it took to 
build the whole damn airplane in the first place! <br>
<br>
The conversion, 
involving installing cargo doors and floors in 10 ex American Airlines 
passenger aircraft, was due to begin test flying from Boeing Field in 2007. 
Actually, in an announcement in the May 2000 magazine Flight International - 
&nbsp;- 8.5 years ago, &nbsp;it was noted that &nbsp;&quot;Boeing has completed 
80% of the engineering work for its <b>767SF</b>  (Special Freighter) 
conversion programme and is beginning an aggressive marketing campaign to 
secure a launch customer. &nbsp;&quot;We're deeply into the design,&quot; says 
Boeing Airplane Services (BAS) maintenance services director, Jerry Smith. 
&quot;It's available pending a launch customer.&quot; &nbsp;[Note: &nbsp;Launch 
customer Cargo Aircraft Management subsequently signed up, allowing the 
agreement with Alenia to be signed.]&nbsp; Eight and one half years later, we 
state the program is being &quot;hampered by a series of engineering 
hurdles.&quot;<br>
<br>
Interestingly, Israel Aircraft Industries has been 
converting 767-200s, and now -300s into freighters, using its own engineering 
data and designs, and generating their own STC.&nbsp; Like most after market 
conversion houses, they&nbsp; found &quot;The price of the Boeing data was too 
steep,&quot; as was said by Richard Gauvin, director of sales and marketing for 
Alcoa-SIE. - a 757 conversion consortium.&nbsp; IAI has converted more than 15 
airplanes for GECAS and Airborne Express, with first deliveries in 2004.&nbsp; 
Timco in North Carolina has also built conversions, using engineering developed 
by FSI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varig in Brazil has performed 767 Freighter 
conversions. &nbsp;And the Russians are also investigating performing freighter 
conversions.<br>
<br>
What's the result for Boeing?<br>
<br>
767-200SF delay 
prompts CHI to plan switch to IAI. &nbsp;(Flight International - January 2008.) 
<br> <br>
Ongoing delays in Boeing and partner Alenia Aeronavali's 767-200 
Special Freighter (SF) cargo conversion programme have prompted launch customer 
Cargo Holdings International (CHI) to turn to Israel Aerospace Industries' 
Bedek Aviation Group. &nbsp;The delays&nbsp; prompted CHI to transfer the four 
remaining 767-200s under its contract&nbsp; to the rival conversion specialist, 
(the first of which was delivered in March 2008.) <br>
<br>
&nbsp;Boeing, with 
the STC, engineering and tooling in hand, are unable to move forward on this 
project - and, interestingly, cite &quot;engineering hurdles&quot; as the 
reason. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
*********************** <br>
<br>
747-8 <br>
<br>
The 
747-8 Program was launched Nov 14, 2005.&nbsp; In an announcement EXACTLY 3 
years later, on Nov 14, 2008, Boeing announced &quot;Delivery of the first 
747-8 Freighter will move from late 2009 to the third quarter of 2010. The 
first 747-8 Intercontinental passenger jet delivery moves from late 2010 to the 
second quarter of 2011.&quot;&nbsp; That's about 58 months from launch to 
delivery. <br>
<br>
It's interesting to note that the first 747 was ordered 13 
April 1966, rolled out 30 Sept 1968, flew 9 Feb 1969, and was certified 30 Dec 
1969.&nbsp; First delivery was made 13 Dec 1969, exactly 44 months after the 
contract was signed.&nbsp; Along the way, Boeing built a whole new factory, and 
blazed an unknown trail in wide-body airplane / high bypass ratio engine 
construction. 
<p><br>
The mantra around Boeing when I retired was stuff like &quot;being 
nimble.&quot;&nbsp;So&nbsp; --&nbsp; after more than 40 years, with the 
technology, factory, most of the tooling, and 1400 completed production units 
in hand, Boeing has increased the time to develop an airplane - a derivative 
airplane - by about 14 months.&nbsp; Now, That's progress!<br>
<br>
</p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;747-8 <br>
<br>
Oh!&nbsp; By the way!&nbsp; At the same time 
the 747 was being designed and built, Boeing was also designing, building and 
certifying the 727-200, the 737 - another all-new airplane (including&nbsp; 
another all-new factory), and the SST (not built.)&nbsp; And followed that up 
with the truly revolutionary YC-14.&nbsp; In the 1978-82 time period, Boeing 
again designed and built two brand new airplanes in parallel - the 757 and 
767.&nbsp; The B-2 was also in works.&nbsp; That's talent!&nbsp; In baseball, 
they call that Bench Strength.&nbsp; If a star player goes down, there's 
another capable player to slip right in.&nbsp; In about 6 years, Boeing could 
design 5 different airplanes.&nbsp; Now, they can't design one. <br>
<br>

&quot;Our entire team has worked hard to mitigate growing schedule risk on this 
program but have been unable to overcome the collective impact of work 
statement increases to the original design, a tight supply of engineering 
resources, and the recent Machinists' strike,&quot; said Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes President and CEO Scott Carson. &quot;We are clearly disappointed in 
what this schedule change means for our customers, employees, suppliersand 
other stakeholders. However, it is the appropriate and prudent decision to 
ensure a successful program, and we are committed to working with our customers 
to mitigate any disruption it causes them.&quot;&nbsp; 747-8 delay announcement 
- Nov 2008 <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>[Note 1:&nbsp; According to Av Week - Dec 15 issue - besides Engineering 
woes, &quot;supplier problems also now envelope the 747-8 development.]</p> 
<p>[Note 2: Is Boeing contemplating canceling the program?&nbsp; See article 
in Reference section at the bottom.]<br>
</p> **********************************
<br> <br>
WedgeTail <br>
<br>
Interestingly, the same Dec 1/2008 issue of Av 
Week that reported the 767 Freighter conversion delays, reports further delays 
in the six 737 Wedgetail radar AEW aircraft for Australia.&nbsp; Originally due 
for delivery years ago, the program was slid one more time in July 2008 for 
another year until July 2009.&nbsp; Now Boeing is unable to say when the first 
aircraft will be received, saying in a statement&quot;we are reviewing the 
schedule with our customer to determine the best way forward....&quot;according 
to Maureen Dougherty, Boeing&rsquo;s vice president for 737 AEW&amp;C 
programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuse me - &quot;the best way forward....&quot;?&nbsp; 
What in the hell is that all about? 
<p> Maybe we ought to junk them and give them their money back?&nbsp; We'd 
probably save a ton of money.<br>
<br>
&quot;This latest slip in the program 
schedule has once again cost Boeing financially,&nbsp; taking an additional 
$274 million charge in its fourth-quarter (2007) results. An earlier delay 
announced in 2006 cost the manufacturer a $496 million charge against its 
second-quarter (2007) earnings.&quot;&nbsp;So far, Boeing has taken charges of 
over $1 Billion on this program - a firm fixed price contract involving 6 
airplanes.&nbsp; That's $166M per airplane!&nbsp; And who knows what 
compensation will be due the customer for late delivery.&nbsp; As my Dad used 
to joke, I guess we're gonna make it up in volume.</p> [Note: &nbsp;In 2nd 
Quarter 2008, Boeing took another charge against this program of $248M.] <br>

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 737 WedgeTail for RAAF <br>
<br>
Similar aircraft are 
being built for the Turkish Air Force.&nbsp; These are called &quot;Peace 
Eagle.&quot;&nbsp; (Who thinks these up?)&nbsp; In May, 2007,&quot;Boeing 
confirmed&nbsp; fresh delay to Turkey&rsquo;s 737 AEW&amp;C project.&quot;
&nbsp; Deliveries have been further delayed until 2010 due to software and 
equipment issues with the modified Boeing 737-700 aircraft.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Upgrading the sensors is going more slowly than expected,&rdquo; says 
Maureen Dougherty, Boeing&rsquo;s vice-president for the 737 AEW&amp;C project. 
&ldquo;To increase the performance, the software and the equipment will be 
modified,&rdquo; she said <br>
<br>
I don't know Maureen, and I'm not trying to 
single her out, but her P.R. provides an attractive target. Boeing's website 
does not provide a bio.&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I can gather, she's been in 
charge of this project for some years and is still on the job in late 
2008.&nbsp; A man named Patrick Gill preceded her.&nbsp; She talks a lot about
<i>Leadership.</i>&nbsp; This program is a great exhibition of &quot; 
Leadership.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe we need to re-evaluate our use of another term - 
Management.&nbsp; Or, how about Accountability. &nbsp; I wonder what her 
compensation package looks like?&nbsp; Is she getting lots of stock options and 
annual bonuses?&nbsp; Like the executives in the banks about to fail...... <br>

<br> Yes - I know - she'll say&nbsp; 'I just don't understand.'&nbsp; Airplanes 
and systems and avionics are more complex and didn't exist nor were they as 
challenging to build in &quot;the good old days.&quot;&nbsp; What a 
crock!&nbsp; Only 19 years elapsed from the first flight of the Model 40 fabric 
covered biplane to the sleek six-jet B-47.&nbsp; Talk about progress!&nbsp; In 
those 19 years, Boeing built and flew a lot of airplanes including the Model 
80, 247, XB-15., B-17, 307 Stratoliner, 314 Clipper, B-29, and the C-97.&nbsp; 
The next 20 years saw the 707, 727, 737, 747 and the B-52.&nbsp; And the 
Bomarc, and Minuteman, and Saturn V.............. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19 Years of Boeing Progress&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
Problems?&nbsp; That's what they pay you the big bucks for, 
Maureen.&nbsp; It's called Management!&nbsp; Where is your Master 
Schedule?&nbsp; Where are your tracking meetings?&nbsp; Weekly?&nbsp; Daily 
(like at 6 AM in the tunnels under the 747 factory?)&nbsp; Where is the 
accountability?&nbsp; What do you folks do? - (see the article at the bottom) - 
visit work areas to &quot;thank people for a job well done.&quot;&nbsp; 
Kumbaya.&nbsp;&quot;Well Done?&quot;&nbsp; Losing over a billion dollars and 
being years and years late on a program is a &quot;job well done?&quot;</p> 
<p>Clearly, I am in a time warp.&nbsp; An old fogey, over-the-hill.&nbsp; Yes, 
Boeing is in the new paradigm.&nbsp; Reflective of society, where there are no 
failing grades in the Seattle Public Schools, where everyone gets a diploma, 
where Little League games are played without scores so as not to upset the 
players, and with exams that have &quot;no wrong answers.&quot;&nbsp; A sure 
recipe for disaster.&nbsp; We're there.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
On 11 Feb 1960, the CIA signed a contract with Kelly Johnson and 
Lockheed's Skunk Works for 12 Mach 3.2 reconnaissance planes (known as A-12s, 
YF-12s, later SR-71s.)&nbsp; This airplane required --&nbsp; NEW -EVERYTHING 
new!&nbsp; New structural materials (titanium), new fuels, new engines, new 
engine oil, new hydraulic fluids, new aerodynamics, new computerized ram air 
inlet systems, new crew escape systems.&nbsp; Even new tires.&nbsp; The first 
airplane rolled out 26 Feb 1962 and flew two months later on 26 April.&nbsp; 
Time to roll out - 24 months; time to first flight - 26 months.&nbsp; 38 months 
after contract signing, it was flying at Mach 3 with an all new set of engines 
(J-58s.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Probably the most advanced airplane ever built.&nbsp; Just imagine the 
challenges to overcome!&nbsp;&nbsp; And done without&nbsp; a bunch of whining 
about &quot;software and equipment issues&quot; and drivel like&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Upgrading the sensors is going more slowly than expected,&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Huh?</p> 
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SR-71 Blackbird</p> 
<p>It is&nbsp; interesting to also note that half a dozen competing AEW 
projects have been proposed, produced, and introduced during this time period 
by other aerospace companies, using an assortment of mostly business jet and 
regional jet airframes.<br>
<br>
Although suppliers and union work stoppages 
are frequently referred to as &quot;the usual suspects&quot; in the press 
releases, it must be stated that the 737 Wedgetail, KC-767 Tanker, 767 
Freighter conversion, 747-8, and 787 have all been plagued with publicly 
acknowledged&quot;engineering problems.&quot;&nbsp; The Wedgetail had 
structural problems with the crown mounted antenna; the KC-767 with wing-tip 
hose and drogue supersonic flows, the 767 Freighter conversion with who knows 
what; likewise the 747-8; and the 787 engineering problems&nbsp; - I'm talking 
structural and aerodynamic - too numerous to mention. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
By way of 
additional comparison (these are&nbsp; getting ugly, aren't they?), the USAF 
E-3 Sentry, or AWACS radar airplane, was first flown in 1972, engineering test 
and evaluation began in Oct 1975 and the first airplane was delivered in March 
1977.&nbsp; About 60 months all up, and 18 months from the start of system 
wring-out.&nbsp; The Wedgetail - well - who knows.&nbsp; The airplanes were 
ordered way back in 2000, and rolled out in Oct 2002.&nbsp; They've been 
sitting on the Boeing Field ramp for six years.&nbsp; Getting flat spots on the 
tires.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; It looks like the program will be a whopping 108 months - or more - 
from order to delivery.&nbsp; Now that's progress!<br>
</p> <br>
Perhaps you 
remember this? <br>

<br>
KC-767 Tanker <br>

<br> The KC-767 Tanker Program for Italy and Japan is another program woefully 
behind schedule, and also running up red ink.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 2007, Boeing 
charged $152M against that program due to cost over-runs and schedule 
slides.&nbsp; It was one of the factors cited by USAF in awarding the Tanker 
program to Airbus.&nbsp; This program had/has major engineering problems - 
including bad aerodynamics, that have lead to a series of redesigns and 
mods.&nbsp; This is supposed to be the era of &quot;computational fluid 
dynamics&quot; simulation capabilities, using super computers and all the 
rest.&nbsp; Japan selected the 767 Tanker in 2001; the contract with Japan was 
signed 3 Apr 2003; the first airplane was delivered 19 Feb 2008 - 58 months 
later, with a delivery delay penalty payment being imposed on Boeing.<br>
<br>

[Note: In 2008, Boeing charged off another $85M against this program.]<br>
<br>

By way of comparison, the KC-135 was ordered by USAF in 5 August 1954; the 
first airplane flew in August 1956 (24 months later) and the first delivery 
occurred in June 1957. (33 months.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JSDF KC-767 <br>
<br> <br>
It took Boeing more than 2 years longer to modify an existing 767 
airframe and deliver an airplane off a functioning production line.&nbsp; Not a 
flattering comparison. &nbsp;But a necessary one. &nbsp; The change from the 
propeller KC-97 to the KC-135 was revolutionary. &nbsp;The 767? &nbsp;Hardly. 
<br> <br>
I haven't the time or energy to dissect the full Space and Defense 
side of the business, but from my knot hole, it's in a shambles.&nbsp; F-35 
Fighter contract lost (Hey, I thought that's why we bought McD in St. 
Louis).&nbsp; Lawsuits on satellite business and launch systems - lost.&nbsp; 
Ethical lapses that caused huge fines (the biggest everin U.S. history) and 
disbarment from bidding opportunities.&nbsp; And, there's the Connexion by 
Boeing debacle.<br>
<br>
What's carrying the company forward are the Legacy 
programs, like the 737, 767, and 777, with big backlogs and in-place production 
set-ups.&nbsp; A new project?&nbsp; Forgetaboutit!&nbsp; Boeing management 
deserves an F grade.&nbsp; Big time!&nbsp; For retirees like myself, it's an 
embarrassment. <br>
<br>
<br>
********************************* <br>
<br>
787 
Program <br>
<br>
The 787 continuing program delays are what triggered this 
little outburst. &nbsp;The Official Announcements, in their dreary sameness, 
are provided below in the reference section. <br>
<br>
When the 787 Program was 
launched, a group of a few hundred folks were sent down to the Bomarc site and 
told to come up with a &quot;new&quot; way to design and build airplanes.&nbsp; 
Sometimes, a clean sheet of paper is a good thing; other times, someone with 
grit under their fingernails is what is needed. Maybe you've noticed how 
&quot;smart&quot; some young people think they are compared to their 
&quot;elders&quot;, and how much a'learnin they have ahead of them - a lot of 
it the hard way. <br>
<br>
The main difference between this airplane and 
previous airplanes (other than the composite construction - which has not 
turned out to be the main problem) was the assignment of increased 
responsibilities to the supplier network, to enable us to create a &quot;snap 
together&quot; airplane that could be assembled in three days. &nbsp;Some&nbsp; 
design responsibility went to the suppliers, with the additional task of 
delivering &quot;stuffed&quot; sections to the final assembly line - something 
Airbus has, in fact, been doing for decades.&nbsp; Now, here's the big 
change.&nbsp; In the past, we had on-site teams at the supplier - to help and 
monitor their progress at making our stuff.&nbsp; I know, they were my 
responsibility for 10 years.&nbsp; Liaison and Industrial Engineers, 
Inspectors, Tooling and Manufacturing experts.&nbsp; They lived there at the 
supplier, day-in and day-out.&nbsp; When things got rocky, we sent in more 
people to ensure we'd get our stuff, -- on time.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the &quot;old 
days&quot;, if necessary,&nbsp; we would send in a big team and make the parts 
needed right in the supplier's own plant.&nbsp; Or make them ourselves down in 
Auburn.&nbsp; Or buy the supplier.&nbsp; To paraphrase Jimmy Cagney's line in<i>
Mr. Roberts</i>- &quot;there ain't nothing that was gonna stand between us, and 
those parts!&quot; <br>
<br>
This time around, we didn't have 
&quot;suppliers&quot; we had &quot;partners.&quot;&nbsp; All of which is 
B.S.&nbsp; - our partners are partners in name only - they basically sign 
contracts similar to those of the past, with the change being, Boeing expected 
them to &quot;participate&quot; in the up-front &quot;risk-sharing&quot; 
financials, without their ever participating in the down-stream profits.&nbsp; 
<br> <br>
Then, we took these work packages and threw them over the 
fence.&nbsp; Because these were now &quot;our partners&quot; and not just 
measly old suppliers, we expected them to design and build the hardware, and 
provided little in the way of on-site assistance and surveillance.&nbsp; What's 
worse, we allowed factories to be built in &quot;greenfield&quot; sites - to 
save money you know - staffed by people with virtually no aerospace 
experience.&nbsp; We believed our own line of B.S. - or to quote a famous 
Boeing phrase - &quot;we were drinking our own bath water.&quot;&nbsp; So we 
saved a nickel and spent a dollar. &nbsp; With the increased supplier 
responsibilities, we should have monitored them more - not less! <br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;787 <br>
<br>
Airplane Number One was a shell for many months 
after Rollout while armies of engineers climbed over it - there had been a 
complete loss of Configuration Control - meaning that the airplane was being 
designed on the factory floor, and the drawings were incomplete.&nbsp; Throw in 
the new supplier responsibilities, and you have a real witch's brew. <br>
<br>

Suppliers can be a lot like I was when I went to college - I was assigned a 
term-paper in September due in May, and started it the night before it was 
due.&nbsp; Continual on-site surveillance, coordination, and help, is what is 
necessary to make all this come to fruition.&nbsp; Without it, you get 
&quot;nasty surprises,&quot; which is what the 787 is getting now.&nbsp; It's 
incredible to me that a Boeing manager (Mike Bair) would stand up in public and 
say they were surprised by the state parts were arriving in.&nbsp; 
What!!!&nbsp; Where have you been??? <br>
<br>
There's a lot of finger pointing 
going on right now, and a lot of it at suppliers.&nbsp; The unions are 
certainly weighing in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem IS NOT with suppliers, the 
problem is with Boeing.&nbsp; Boeing views themselves as have &quot;large scale 
project integration&quot; as one of their core competencies. I happen to agree 
with that.&nbsp; However, to be a Project Integrator, you have to be a Project 
Manager.&nbsp; The problem is solely and entirely Boeing's fault.&nbsp; They 
needed to manage the program, and they have not. <br>
<br>
A reporter from one 
of the papers called me a couple of years ago, and asked me what I thought of 
the first 787 schedule delays. &nbsp;I recited the oft quoted six stages of an 
aerospace project. &nbsp;Having never heard of them before, he thought they 
were a kick. &nbsp;They are: <br>
<br>
Euphoria<br>
 Disillusionment<br>
Panic
<br><br>
Search for the Guilty<br>
Punishment of the Innocent<br>
Reward for 
the Uninvolved.<br>
<br>
<br>
I asked him to pick for himself which stage he 
thought Boeing was currently in. &nbsp;I &nbsp;invite the reader of this humble 
tome to do the same.<br>
<br>
**************************** <br>
<br>
Suppliers 
<br> <br>
I was asked - Do you still believe this global-supply setup was a 
good idea? <br>
<br>
My answer is &quot;You bet!&quot;&nbsp; Despite the IAM's 
posturing, Boeing cannot, and has never, built, complete airplanes.&nbsp; No 
manufacturer does.&nbsp; Boeing's percentage of &quot;Buy&quot; in the Make/Buy 
split, has always been way below the rest of American manufacturing.&nbsp; 
Parts always came from outside - sometimes more, sometimes less.&nbsp; 
Suppliers are necessary, and not a 'necessary evil' either.&nbsp; This time, we 
wanted them to do some design and stuffing work, without ever providing the 
needed support.&nbsp; Oh, and by the way, check out the 787 kick-off&nbsp; 
orders from airlines in Japan (ANA) - or the 767 or 777.&nbsp; The 787 might 
not exist at all, and the Boeing factories might not be near as busy without 
our relationships with that country's manufacturers.&nbsp; The unions ought to 
think about that before they go mouthing off about suppliers. <br>
<br>

Nevertheless, I wonder what Boeing's game planis with regard to suppliers - or 
even IF they have a game plan.&nbsp; On the one hand they have shut down or 
spun off portions of the company, like Spokane and Wichita.&nbsp; On the other, 
they have bought suppliers - like in Hawker de Havilland in Australia, Rockwell 
Tulsa, Vought (Global Partner share) - bringing once outside suppliers into the 
Boeing fold.&nbsp; Scott - What IS the plan??? <br>
<br>
So how did Boeing get 
in this pickle?&nbsp; Is there really a problem?&nbsp; We have this huge 
backlog...... <br>
<br>
Jim Blue once had a&nbsp;painting commissioned. 
&nbsp;It showed General Custer &nbsp;on his horse surrounded by members of his 
Cavalry. &nbsp;He's holding his index finger in the air, and proclaiming
&quot;We're Number One!&quot; &nbsp;Off in the wispy distance can be seen a 
line of Sioux warriors, coming over a distant ridge................. <br>
<br>

Does this quote from the Seattle Times in March 2007 sound like General Custer? 
<br> <br>
To hear Mike Bair tell it, the biggest problem with the new 787 
Dreamliner manufacturing schedule has been the olive trees.<br>
<br>
The trees, 
that is, that Italian partner Alenia had to move before it could build its 
factory in Grottaglie, a city in southeast Italy.<br>
<br>
&quot;They had to 
transplant all the olive trees,&quot; Bair said. &quot;<br>
<br>
In an apparent 
bid to convince skeptics Boeing will not falter as Airbus has done in the final 
stages of its new jet program, Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Scott Carson 
joined Bair on the call.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are doing what we do best at Boeing, 
and that is use all of our intelligence, skills and resources to make sure that 
we deliver,&quot; said Carson. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Boeing has a lot of problems 
- a lot.&nbsp; Despite their claims otherwise, they have clearly lost their 
management skills.&nbsp; The reason aerospace is such a high stakes game, with 
a high cost of entry, is because of the complexity and skill sets needed to be 
successful.&nbsp; Product definition, marketing, sales, design, tooling, 
manufacture, supplier management, testing, delivery, and service.&nbsp; A 
program must be MANAGED.&nbsp; When done successfully, it looks easy - but only 
dummies (or, perhaps, some in Boeing Top Management), think it's easy.&nbsp; 
Like watching Griffey shag fly balls, or Horowitz play the piano, or Peggy 
Fleming ice skate, pro's make it look easy.&nbsp; Only dummies THINK it is 
easy.&nbsp; What I'm trying to say&nbsp; is Boeing got stupid, and started to 
think our success happened because we were so good - like falling out of bed in 
the morning -- instead of due to the intelligence, skill, and hard work of 
a&nbsp; lot of experienced people. &nbsp;They MADE it look easy -- it wasn't 
easy. 
<p> And, this isn't one or two programs.&nbsp; That would be --&nbsp;&nbsp; if 
not acceptable -- at least somewhat understandable.&nbsp; This is permeating 
almost all of the current programs.&nbsp; Programs need to be Managed.&nbsp;  
They ALL have rough spots in the road that must be overcome.<br>
<br>
An 
airplane is built to a Master Schedule.&nbsp; And managed in War Rooms.&nbsp; 
With continual Progress Meetings.&nbsp; All the functions contribute to the 
building of the schedule, and all sign off.&nbsp; Engineering. &nbsp;Tooling. 
&nbsp;Manufacturing. &nbsp;Finance. &nbsp;Then they are expected to meet the 
schedule.&nbsp; To &quot;Make Their Bar&quot; in factory jargon.&nbsp; Progress 
against the schedule is tracked at all levels continuously. They each have 
their own War Rooms.&nbsp; When the inevitable problems arise, they are 
surfaced, elevated, worked.&nbsp; Additional resources are allocated.&nbsp; 
Here's the &quot;secret sauce&quot;&nbsp; -&nbsp; once you agree to your 
portion of the schedule - you're expected to meet it!&nbsp; 'The dog ate my 
homework' isNot Acceptable!</p> 
<p> People who try to &quot;hide the wienie&quot; are usually outed, and can 
get the gate.&nbsp; It's a true Team effort - from the days before they had 
Team Players (a Boeing euphemism for&quot;Yes-Man.&quot;)&nbsp; From the days 
before they bragged about &quot;Working Together,&quot; and painted that on the 
side of the airplanes. &nbsp;Boeing schedules were sacrosanct. &nbsp;You could 
put a Milestone on the chart for balloons, buttons, and &nbsp;hotdogs for the 
Roll-Out and the First Flight. &nbsp;And you could order the catering two years 
ahead of time without &nbsp;fear. &nbsp;Today?<br>
<br>
About 1990, I received 
a call from a man named Bob Bartz. &nbsp;He was, I think, the McD V.P. in Long 
Beach responsible for Douglas Purchasing. &nbsp;He asked if he could come and 
visit to discuss &quot;production &nbsp;problems&quot; being experienced in 
Long Beach. &nbsp;After clearing this unorthodox request with the head shed, I 
agreed to the meeting. &nbsp;Sitting in my office on a rare snowy day, he 
confessed that Douglas was envious of Boeing's scheduling prowess. &nbsp;Their 
troubles making production schedule had been going on for decades, and they 
wondered if there was some &quot;secret sauce&quot; that Boeing used. 
&nbsp;What I described to him was the above paragraph. &nbsp;Master Schedules 
and War Rooms were the secret method, and Management and Accountability were 
the secret sauce.&nbsp; And the discipline to drive towards a common 
goal.&nbsp; To make schedule.&nbsp; Engineering tracked their off-board drawing 
releases through the ESWR system.&nbsp; Purchasing (Materiel) had their 
Shortage Meetings.&nbsp; Buyers would appear weekly before management, and 
would do anything to ensure that they had their supplier's part situation under 
control.&nbsp; It was Management 101.</p> 
<p> Our meetings were called <i>STAND UP </i>meetings - they were intended to 
be short, concise and to-the-point.&nbsp; We didn't want anybody relaxing in 
their chairs, leisurely sipping their first cup of morning coffee.<br>
<br>

Fast forward a few years, and Douglas -&nbsp; Long Beach now had a Boeing sign 
on their big office building in Long Beach. &nbsp;Condit and Stonecipher made 
sure the company we bought for $16 Billion didn't feel they were playing second 
fiddle to a bunch of cocky know-it-alls in Seattle. &nbsp;We were too 
&quot;in-bred.&quot; &nbsp;So McD people were brought north and integrated into 
high positions while joint teams &nbsp;worked out merging the cultures. 
&nbsp;Here's a tip - &nbsp;don't integrate the Super Bowl champs with the last 
place team. &nbsp;Only bad things will result. Guess what? &nbsp;Both things 
did ! &nbsp; Now Seattle caught the Long Beach disease - declining market 
shares and bad schedule problems. &nbsp;And to think, we PAID for this.</p> 
<p></p> Maybe &quot;T&quot; had it right, Harry!<b><br>
<br>
Recalling the 
``old Boeing,&quot; Stonecipher shared a conversation he once had with former 
Boeing Chairman T. Wilson.<br>
<br>
``I told him Boeing is arrogant.&quot; 
&nbsp; He (Wilson) responded: `And rightly so!' &quot;</b> <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You know, Harry, the Green Bay Packers were 'arrogant' too, and so were the 
New York Yankees.&nbsp; Winners, some people would call them........&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Note:&nbsp; Someone took me to task for 'embracing' arrogance.&nbsp; He was 
right, of course.&nbsp; Boeing has been arrogant, and not in a good way 
either.&nbsp; Actually, it was a vice I preached against during my working 
years.&nbsp; In this case, I choose to use the word in a more benign way - 
meaning 'spark', 'spunk', 'winning attitude.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> Bill B., one of my many correspondents, put it succinctly:
<pre>When I came to Boeing 40 years ago,&nbsp;it was<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Kick 
ass, Take names, Build planes&quot;,<br>
<br>
now it is <br>
<br>
&quot;Sit 
down, Hold hands, Build plans&quot;</pre> <br>
<br>

<p>Boeing hasn't been tending to their knitting for a long time, and the 
chickens are coming home to roost.&nbsp; It used to be &quot;Over budget, and 
they yell at you - Bust a schedule and you get fired.&quot;&nbsp; Now, busting 
schedule is de rigueur.&nbsp; Accepted.&nbsp; Failure is accepted.&nbsp; It 
permeates their language and their mindset.&nbsp; Now, we don't even provide a 
schedule.&nbsp; We don't want to get nailed down by the media, and our 
customers.&nbsp; We talk in nebulosity's - in terms of &quot;assessments&quot;, 
and vague dates given in calendar quarters - even years!&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We 
deeply regret the impact these delays will have on our customers,.....&quot;
&nbsp; We are unable to manage our programs.<br>
<br>
And that doesn't mean 
that Boeing was a Devil's Island to work at.&nbsp; Actually, quite the 
opposite.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; People were smart, worked hard, - often off 
the clock.&nbsp; Dedicated.&nbsp; Excellence was our pedigree and our mantra - 
it was expected and it was delivered.&nbsp; It was the legacy handed down to us 
from those who went before - 50 years of greatness.&nbsp; The first 747 was 
built while the factory buildings were built around it.&nbsp; The people called 
themselvesThe Incredibles.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There's one more thing I find painful to say.&nbsp; Airbus built this big 
airplane - the A380.&nbsp; And they took a two year schedule slide.&nbsp; 
They're still not out of the woods.&nbsp; But their problems were in PRODUCING 
the customer's airplanes, not in designing, testing, and certifying the basic 
airplane.&nbsp; The first test airplanes came together pretty well.&nbsp; And 
the cert program seemed fairly straight-forward.&nbsp; They wound up in the 
unique predicament of having a certified airplane, but unable to deliver 
product.&nbsp; The problem seems to be in the complex wiring supporting each 
customer's huge variation in passenger amenities.&nbsp; Their engineering 
and&nbsp; supplier management and manufacturing seemed under control.</p> 
<p>Boeing only wishes it had those problems.&nbsp; Our first airplane is going 
to be almost two years from Rollout to First Flight!&nbsp; That's two 
years!&nbsp; Our problems are far more basic than worrying about the passenger 
entertainment system.<br>
<br>
</p> *************************** <br>

<p><br>
I like metrics - macro metrics.&nbsp; They tell you where you REALLY 
are, without the fluff.<br>
<br>
</p> In March 1944, Boeing delivered 365 B-17s 
from Plant 2 in just the one month.&nbsp; Parts from everywhere&nbsp; --&nbsp; 
in wartime.&nbsp; Engines, propellers, landing gear, windshields, aluminum 
sheet, tires.&nbsp; It didn't happen by accident and there were no computers, 
no emails and no employee surveys.<br>
<br>
The B-47 was designed, built and 
flown in 24 months from contract signing.&nbsp; The 707 Prototype - the Dash 80 
- in 26 months.&nbsp; The 727 in 26 months. The 737 in 26 months.&nbsp; 747 in 
34 months.&nbsp; 757 - 34 months.&nbsp; 767 - 38 months. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now, 
the 787 is looking at - what? - maybe 62 months.&nbsp;
<p>  &nbsp;This is NOT ACCEPTABLE, and some people need to be held accountable 
- maybe get fired!&nbsp; </p> <br>
<br>
<br>
Yet, what do we hear?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Yvonne Leach, a spokeswoman for the 787 program, said&quot;This is a huge, 
complex project, and that means the assessment is pretty complicated as 
well,&quot;&nbsp; adding that &quot;the assessment involved talking with 
suppliers and evaluating work to be done by Boeing. But we know how to do 
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Know how to do it&quot;? -- I don't think so 
Yvonne!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;We're laser focused on what needs to be done to 
prepare for first flight,&quot;said Pat Shanahan, 787 program vice president. 
&quot;We will overcome this set of circumstances as we have others in the past, 
and we understand clearly what needs to be done moving forward.&quot; (December 
11, 2008) <br>
<br>
&quot;...we understand clearly what needs to be done moving 
forward.&quot; &nbsp; Pat - I think you need to stop saying this. &nbsp;The 
evidence is quite to the contrary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I do think these people are 
in denial. 
<p><br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Check out the 777 program.&nbsp; Despite what is said 
about the 787, the 777 was a &quot;high-tech&quot; airplane.&nbsp; A great 
airplane and a great program.&nbsp; It was digitally designed and built.&nbsp; 
It had no engineering mockup.&nbsp; Drawings were released to suppliers as 
&quot;digital data sets&quot; - an all-new concept.&nbsp; Parts were built and 
inspected to those data sets.&nbsp; It didn't have &quot;shims&quot;, despite 
some comments elsewhere in the press.&nbsp; It had an advanced fly-by-wire 
flight control system and avionics architecture.&nbsp; Mulally insisted that 
the airplane not be designed &quot;on the shop floor&quot;, and it 
wasn't.&nbsp; Off-board drawing releases were made to the factory when they 
were complete. Actually, the 757 and 767 Programs, were likewise advanced for 
their time, and all three airplanes were managed to a Master Schedule, and were 
ON-TIME.&nbsp; These were basic Boeing skills, learned from the time you got 
your first badge.&nbsp; It was like learning to walk.&nbsp; Where are these 
skills now?&nbsp; Maybe on the floor of the Bomarc site. <br>
<br>
- Boeing has 
lost a good portion of its expertise, and finds itself with few people that 
have the knowledge and expertise to design and build a new airplane.&nbsp; The 
1995 &quot;early out&quot; was, in retrospect, a hemorrhage of enormous 
talent.&nbsp; Much of this was unappreciated at the time, and perhaps is still 
unappreciated.&nbsp; A lot of this loss was also the corporation's own 
doing.&nbsp; They have wallowed in political correctness for more than a 
decade.&nbsp; As I wrote to then president Ron Woodard in dismay in 1994, 
&quot;If all the good people leave, whose gonna be left - the duds?&quot;&nbsp; 
The answer is now plain to see as the emperor has no clothes.&nbsp; Maybe P.C. 
will work in Seattle politics or bridge and ferry repairs (or school 
achievement scores), but in the cold harsh world of building commercial 
airplanes, at some point the rubber is gonna meet the road. 
<p> &nbsp;As my friend Jim said:&nbsp; </p> <b>T<i>he whiz kids call it 
&quot;cross pollenization&quot;,&nbsp; I call it Skill dilution at&nbsp;a level 
where it can do the most harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;For years, these new directors were 
saved from themselves (sort of) because they had lieutenants who knew the ropes 
and counseled them.&nbsp; The brain drain of '95 plus natural attrition has 
pretty much taken care of that.</i></b> 
<p><b><i>Matrix management is a disaster in the making.&nbsp; It makes it easy 
for people to dodge responsibility.&nbsp; The way things worked successfully at 
Boeing, or anywhere else for that matter, is when for every job, there is just 
one ass to kick when it isn't done.&nbsp;</i></b></p> <i><b>&nbsp;Bob, its a 
very tough situation and as such, calls for tough measures.&nbsp; These times 
call for old &quot;Bull of the woods&quot; types like Sessions or Buckley who 
will just not tolerate late engineering, shortages, schedule slippage, 
etc.&nbsp; Alas, where does one find those guys now??&nbsp; Whether its too 
late or not, is hard to tell.&nbsp; I'm sure of this much; Its much, much, 
worse than you can read in the papers.</b></i> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>- This is not about personalities. &nbsp;I never met ex-Mariner managers 
John McLaren or Jim Riggleman.&nbsp; I believe they were nice guys who would 
make great friends and neighbors.&nbsp; But they got the gate for poor 
performance - and they deserved it. &nbsp;Some of the hardest things I did as a 
manager were relieving people who were 'nice guys', in fact some were good 
personal friends.&nbsp; I have never met McNerney, nor Carson, nor, for that 
matter, Ms. Dougherty.&nbsp; I believe they are genuinely nice people and 
obviously very smart.&nbsp; But performance counts.&nbsp; Clearly, they are not 
on-top of the situation.&nbsp; I hate to use the word 'lying', but they are not 
being told the truth, or they wouldn't stand up in front of a roomful of 
analysts and reporters, and solemnly declare that the &quot;new&quot; date was 
a firm date.&nbsp; My inside intelligence indicates there are more &quot;bad 
surprises&quot; lurking in the future, and there is a real question as to 
whether Carson and McNerney have been apprised of these.&nbsp; Just perhaps, 
the &quot;Team-Player / Yes-Man / Group-Think culture has arrived at its 
inevitable conclusion - people afraid to stand up and tell the boss something 
he doesn't want to hear.&nbsp; Pity.<br>
<br>
- It's NOT enough to be&nbsp; 
smart, sit in the meetings, and think you're &quot;learning the 
business.&quot;&nbsp; Watching Power Point presentations. &nbsp;(Used to be 
Vue-Foil presentations in the &quot;old days.&quot;) &nbsp;Yes, you can be 
really smart, but you need to know what questions to ask.&nbsp; You need to 
have that sixth sense that tells you that you are out on thin ice and getting 
ready to fall through. You don't absolutely have to be a techie (Bill Allen 
wasn't), but then you need some really good techies working for you, people you 
can trust.&nbsp; The current Boeing management doesn't have those people - 
Condit got rid of them - that's why they keep standing up in front of the press 
and the financial community swearing on a stack of bibles that the 
&quot;new&quot; schedule is the real McCoy and cast in concrete.&nbsp; The 
engineers have let them down repeatedly, and their credibility has been reduced 
to zero.&nbsp; P.R. flacks are putting out Press Releases that even to them, 
must be getting tiresome.&nbsp; Their language sounds more and more like a 
losing sports coach about to get fired.<br>
<br>
- Like a lot of American 
industry - the wrong people are at the top.&nbsp; Check the resumes and 
education of the top guys - the bios are on the Boeing web site.&nbsp; 
Historically, bean counters do poorly managing technological companies.&nbsp; 
Boeing has usually excelled when engineers were at the top -&nbsp; Claire 
Egvedt, Phillip Johnson, T. Wilson, Jim Johnson, Alan Mulally.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good 
bean counters - people like Harold Haynes - needed to be on the sidelines 
keeping the engineers honest.&nbsp; Look at companies that have thrived when 
the&nbsp; guy in charge was a tech nerd.&nbsp; They do well because the boss 
knows what's going on, or at least knows what questions to ask.&nbsp; Good ones 
can instinctively smell a rat in the woodpile. &nbsp;(And, yes, Bill Allen has 
always been one of my heroes - I know, he was a lawyer. &nbsp;There are no 
absolutes.)<br>
<br>
My opinion:&nbsp; If you want to run a tech company, you 
need to be a techie.&nbsp; Check out Bill Gates at Microsoft, Steve Jobs at 
Apple, Andy Grove at Intel,&nbsp; Bob Galvin - Motorola, T. Wilson and Claire 
Egvedt at Boeing, Art Collins of Collins Radio, or , say, my friend Gerry Block 
at Sandel in San Diego. LeRoy Grumman, Jack Northrop, Kelly Johnson - the list 
is long.&nbsp; What we've got (in the great American &quot;new 
tradition&quot;), are bean&nbsp; counters.&nbsp; MBA's and lawyers.&nbsp; As 
Bill Conway, the management guru I was good friends&nbsp;&nbsp; with, used to 
say - &quot;This business that being a good manager is&nbsp; all that's needed 
is nonsense.&nbsp; If you want to run a baking&nbsp; company, you better know a 
hell of a lot about baking!&quot;&nbsp; I note, parenthetically, that the last 
Steinway just died at 92 (of&nbsp; Steinway &amp; Sons piano fame.)&nbsp; His 
grandfather started him out working in the factory for two years to learn how 
to build pianos, before he ever let him in the office.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Old Chinese Proverb</p> 
<p>I HEAR, .....and I FORGET</p> 
<p>I SEE, .....and I REMEMBER</p> I DO, .....and I UNDERSTAND<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> 
<p>- And, just maybe, Boeing is reflective of our society as a whole.&nbsp; As 
Boeing has worried about everything but building airplanes - Affirmative Action 
goals, Diversity, United Way contribution levels, and Employee Surveys, 4 day 
work weeks, -- all the while - on the other hand - playing hardball with its 
unionized workforce - forcing strikes, and fostering shall we say - a lack of 
loyalty by employees - they have stopped tending to their knitting.&nbsp; 
Obviously, the work force, as our population in general, has changed.&nbsp; A 
bunch of mostly white guys with pocket protectors, argyle socks and wingtip 
shoes living in Bellevue, have been replaced by a more diverse workforce.&nbsp; 
But that workforce needs to be trained, mentored, nurtured - to squeeze the 
drops of wisdom from the previous generation.&nbsp; Instead, what has clearly 
happened - from my knothole - is for people to be promoted beyond their skills, 
experience, and abilities.&nbsp; Promoted for an EEO scorecard.&nbsp; Quite a 
few wind up in very high positions.</p> 
<p><b>Get enough of the wrong people in charge, and you pass V1 speed - 
there's no turning back.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Tipping Point.&quot;</b></p> 
<p>Here's a test - check out the bios of all the Boeing Directors.&nbsp; What 
you'll find is, going back 15 years, or more,&nbsp; - a lot of people began 
moving into high positions without much experience in the particular 
discipline.&nbsp; They move rapidly through the chairs, without staying long 
enough in a place to really learn something (or to get blamed when things start 
heading south.)&nbsp; But they do build a helluva fancy resume.</p> 
<p>This is a recipe for disaster, -- enough of these unskilled folks, and the 
train stops running.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; The result can be like tossing your kids in the middle of the 
lake.&nbsp; Some kids will&nbsp;learn to swimquickly, the others will drown.</p>
<p>**************************************</p> 
<p>Check out the article in the Reference section below from the company 
rag&nbsp; --&nbsp; it explains part of the problem.&nbsp; 
&quot;Touchy-feely&quot; garbage jargon&nbsp; and words like
&quot;leadership&quot; are thrown around with abandon. &quot;Representing the 
&quot;Leadership Team, Ms. Dougherty recognized employees for the good work and 
successes.&quot;&nbsp; What successes?&nbsp; The Program is going to be 10 
years old, $1 Billion dollars over budget (ALL Boeing money), and they talk 
about &quot;success.&quot;&nbsp; Sports teams at every level understand what 
performance is, and what success means.&nbsp; The UW football team just went 
winless for the entire season.&nbsp; The coach got fired.&nbsp; The Mariners 
fired their coach in mid-season.&nbsp; When the A380 program slipped for the 
second or third time, the top dogs got fired.&nbsp; Somebody needs to get 
fired.&nbsp; Starting with Maureen, perhaps, (nothing personal, Maureen), and 
working up from there.</p> 
<p>********************************</p> Before I quit this rant, I want to 
mention one last thing - a&nbsp; subject known as &quot;Chicago.&quot;  
&nbsp;Phil and Harry moved the HQ there, amid a lot of wailing by the locals. 
&nbsp;They were dismayed by the loss of prestige and all the rest. &nbsp;It was 
a big change for an 80 year old company. &nbsp;The stated reason was to avoid 
forcing the local operating units to constantly squirm under the direct glare 
of the head shed guys. &nbsp;At the time, it never made much of an impression 
on me, one way or the other. &nbsp;The number of people actually making the 
move was miniscule.&nbsp; I didn't think they'd start building 747s near the 
Loop. <br>

<p>I was wrong. &nbsp;Now, I'm reminded of another old Boeing phrase - 
&quot;You can't hoe the garden from the living room.&quot;&nbsp;Headquarters is 
too removed from the action, and what's worse, the Seattle operating units 
&nbsp;do their best (from what I'm told) to keep them in the dark. &nbsp;HQ 
definitely seems a little - shall we say &quot;thin&quot; - in technical depth, 
and that deficiency, along with the distance, is really starting to bite.<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Update - 23 Jun 2009:&nbsp; &nbsp;787 First Flight indefinitely delayed for 
sixth time - &nbsp;Details below.<br>
</p> 
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p> <br>

<p><b>It takes us longer to modify a 767 into a Freighter, than it took to 
design, build and certify the 767.</b></p> 
<p><b>It takes us longer to build a 'poor man's AWACS' on a 737 platform, than 
it took to build the original AWACS on a 707.</b></p> 
<p><b>It takes us longer to build a KC-135 Tanker replacement using an 
existing airframe, than it took to build the original KC-135.</b></p> 
<p><b>It takes us longer to build a 747 stretched derivative airplane, than it 
took to design, build and certify the 747.</b></p> 
<p><b>It is taking us longer to design and build a new model airplane than ANY 
previous airplane in the history of the company.</b></p> <br>
<br>

<p><b>These comparisons are NOT ACCEPTABLE !!!</b> &nbsp;*<br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Boeing has lost its touch.&nbsp; Boeing is going backwards.&nbsp; We 
are unable to manage large programs - our ultimate core competency. Not on one 
program, but on many. &nbsp;The metrics cited above show it clearly.&nbsp; We 
are going backwards. Engineering is messed up.&nbsp; The supplier base is 
messed up.&nbsp; Almost every new program winds up hugely over budget and 
enormously behind schedule.&nbsp; Our ethics are suspect, and our credibility 
is zero. Without a big backlog of producing legacy programs, we would be in a 
world of hurt.<br>
<br>
Suddenly falling gas prices negatively impact the 
urgency for airlines to acquire more fuel efficient airplanes - read that 
787.&nbsp; &nbsp;The falling economy reduces &nbsp;traffic and the cash flow 
needed to buy new equipment, and parking excess airplanes to reduce capacity 
certainly works against accepting new ones. The exchange rate of the Euro has 
plunged, creating a huge easing of the monetary burden that has been 
mercilessly pressuring Airbus financials. &nbsp;The brewing<i>Perfect Storm</i> 
demands more in the way of management skills at the very time when Boeing seems 
to have lost them completely. &nbsp;Getting caught in this storm, at this time, 
is entirely Boeing's doing - all of the above Programs should be producing 
product and revenue streams at this very time. &nbsp;Passengers should be 
riding on those 787s at this moment, and the flight line should be full of 
airplanes nearing delivery. &nbsp;They should be....but, they're not.<br>
<br>

I recall my boss once coming around to tell me of a new job - a new 
'opportunity' -&quot;Somewhere in the world is someone who can make this 
project happen, and,&nbsp; --&nbsp; with a pregnant pause --&nbsp; I hope it's 
you.&quot;, he said, as he turned and left my office. <i>&quot;Oh!, I thought - 
if you put it in those terms.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> Maybe those words need to 
be spoken again.&nbsp; Soon.<br>

computerized systems, embraced for their&nbsp; so-called &quot;newness&quot; 
and hi-tech &nbsp;hype. &nbsp;Total failure to even recognize the value of 
legacy systems.
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing to recognize the high value of experience 
present in the seasoned workforce, replacing that knowledge with promises from 
in-experienced&nbsp;&nbsp; people who have to learn on-the-fly, and reinvent 
the wheel. &nbsp;</p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A senior management without technical

seasoned technical people who, in the past,&nbsp; have acted as advisers to 
make up for that deficiency.<br>
<br>
7. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Embracing the 
corporate culture, and promoting people representing that culture, from a

&nbsp;<br>
<br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promoting people without skills, 
experience, or abilities to achieve some sort of politically correct 
&nbsp;employee 'face' for the business enterprise at the&nbsp; expense of 
complete loss of program execution capabilities.<br>

their execution; to monitor their progress in a timely manner; and to intervene

<h1>Boeing again delays initial 787 test flight</h1> 
<p>By Dominic Gates</p> 
<p>Seattle Times aerospace reporter</p> 
<p>Boeing disclosed a serious new setback to its 787 Dreamliner program just 
days before the airplane was to fly, announcing today that the first flight 
will be postponed for weeks because the plane needs structural reinforcement.
</p> 
<p>Engineers found a structural defect that dictates &quot;a need to reinforce 
an area within the side-of-body section of the aircraft,&quot; the company said.
</p> 
<p>Boeing chief executive Scott Carson said that &quot;structural 
modifications like these are not uncommon in the development of new 
airplanes,&quot; and called the fix &quot;a limited and localized structural 
reinforcement (that) is quite manageable.&quot;</p> 
<p>But investors reacted sharply, sending Boeing stock down $3.97, or 8.5 
percent, to $42.93 after two hours of trading Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Adding to the delay's impact is uncertainty: Boeing said it will be 
&quot;several weeks&quot; before it will even come up with a new schedule.</p> 
<p>&quot;First flight and first delivery will be rescheduled following the 
final determination of the required modification and testing plan,&quot; the 
Boeing statement said.</p> 
<p>In a conference call early Tuesday morning, Scott Fancher, the head of the 
Dreamliner program, said that late in May engineers, performing wing bend tests 
on the airplane that is set aside inside the factory specifically for ground 
testing, found that strain gauges showed higher stress than predicted by the 
computer models at multiple points along the upper part of the wing-to-body 
join.</p> 
<p>Fancher emphasized that the issue does not represent a fundamental problem 
with the new carbon-fiber composite plastic material from which the airplane is 
constructed.</p> 
<p>&quot;Composites are the right material,&quot; said Pat Shanahan, head of 
airplane programs, &quot;We will correct this situation and do it with both 
care and urgency.&quot;</p> 
<p>Fancher said the issue occurred at about 18 locations on each wing, in 
areas no bigger than one or two square inches each. The areas affected are 
where the wing made by Mitsubishi in Japan is joined to a part of the center 
fuselage body made by Fuji, also of Japan.</p> 
<p>When engineers checked the areas flagged by the instruments measuring the 
strain, they found evidence that the structure was indeed stressed. Asked if 
that meant delamination of the composite material, Fancher didn't specify 
exactly but hinted that visible damage was apparent.</p> 
<p>&quot;We saw a number of things indicative of what the strain gauges were 
saying,&quot; Fancher said.</p> 
<p>Boeing insists it can fix the problem with a modification to strengthen the 
structural areas in question. Fancher said that will involve &quot;a relatively 
small number of parts and a relatively simple modification.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We're talking about a couple of parts that can literally be held in 
your hand,&quot; at each of the 36 locations affected, Fancher said.</p> 
<p>However, given the two years of delays leading up to this last-minute 
showstopper, such assurances have a big credibility problem. The lack of a new 
schedule is also an issue.</p> 
<p>In the weeks ahead, Fancher said, engineers must assess several different 
possible modifications, select the best, then design and test it. In the 
meantime, he said, Dreamliner No. 1 will proceed with as far as the taxi tests 
on the ground. But it cannot fly.</p> 
<p>Once a modification is developed, all the airplanes &mdash; those already 
built and those in process of being built &mdash; will have to be modified.</p> 
<p>The news came just a week after Boeing executives at the Paris Air Show, 
including Carson, offered assurances that the plane would fly by month-end.</p> 
<p>Carson said on the conference call that initial analysis suggested first 
flight could go ahead even as Boeing tried to fix the problem. However, late 
last week, after the executives had returned from Paris, the decision was made 
to halt first flight.</p> 
<p>&quot;While difficult, this was the prudent step for us to take.,&quot; 
Carson said.</p> 
<p>Customers have also begun to react. Japanese airline All Nippon Airways 
(ANA) issued a brief statement all but pleading for information on when it can 
get its airplane.</p> &quot;We are disappointed that the first flight of the 
787 will be postponed, and urge Boeing to specify the schedule for the program 
as a whole as quickly as possible,&quot; the ANA statement said.<br>
<br>

*********************************************<br>

<p> CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Boeing Co.'s (BA) announcement Tuesday of another 
holdup on its new 787 Dreamliner didn't sit well with investors already wary of 
problems surrounding the company's defense programs and pension-cost headwind.
</p> 
<p> Shares of Boeing, which have sunk on worries about the 787 as well as the 
weak commercial aircraft market, traded recently at $43.46, down 7.5% for the 
day. That's well off the year-high of $76.48.</p> 
<p> JSA Research cut Boeing's stock rating to hold from buy, saying it needs 
more clarity from Boeing on 787 plans.</p> 
<p> &quot;At this point, Boeing has provided us with nothing but 
uncertainty,&quot; said Paul Nisbet, president of the independent research 
company.</p> 
<p> While the 787 is the focus of attention, Boeing has also suffered setbacks 
on the defense side of its business, which accounts for about half of its $60 
billion in annual revenue.</p> 
<p> Boeing said the long-awaited first flight of the 787, to have taken place 
this month, would be delayed because the plane failed a stress test.</p> 
<p> Boeing will need to reinforce a joint between the wings and body of the 
plane, Scott Carson, head of Boeing's commercial-airplanes unit, said Tuesday.
</p> 
<p> The company, which last week confirmed the flight schedule, said it may 
take several weeks to redo its schedule for the first 787 flight, and for first 
delivery of the aircraft, earlier planned for early 2010.</p> 
<p> Nisbet said that, in the worst case, customers could have to wait months 
longer for the new planes, which are already two years behind their original 
schedule.</p>  &quot;We also have to consider how this will affect suppliers 
like Spirit, Rockwell Collins and Goodrich,&quot; Nisbet said. Typically, 
manufacturers like Boeing and rival Airbus must compensate both customers and 
suppliers when aircraft production is delayed.<br>
<br>
Boeing also faces 
rising pension expenses. Analyst Brent Miller at Gradient Analytics said 
Boeing's pension fund this year is underfunded by $8.4 billion, which could 
hurt future earnings. While a recovery in world's financial markets may help to 
recoup some of that unrealized pension-fund loss, Boeing likely will be on the 
hook to increase pension contributions for the next several years, Miller said. 
<p></p> Update: &nbsp; On 11 Dec 2008, Boeing announced a(nother) major 
re-organization of the Commercial Airplane production organization. &nbsp;(See 
below.) &nbsp;Will it be enough? &nbsp;Time will tell. 
<p>Update: &nbsp;On 4 May 2009, Boeing announced another 787 Program 
re-organization. &nbsp;Details below.</p> 
<p>Some Reference Materials</p> 787 Delay Announcements <br>
<br>
Boeing 
[NYSE: BA] today announced an updated schedule for its all-new 787 Dreamliner 
program that moves the commercial jet's first flight into the second quarter of 
2009 and first delivery into the first quarter of 2010.<br>
<br>
Boeing is 
evaluating the specific impact of this delay on customer delivery dates and 
will provide customers with updated schedules once completed. The company is 
also determining any financial impact from this schedule change and will 
incorporate that into updated financial and overall airplane delivery guidance 
that will be released at a later date. &nbsp;787 delay announcement - Dec 2008
<br><br>
<i><b>[Note:&nbsp; According to Av Week Dec 15/2008 issue, this is the 
FIFTH delay to First Flight and the FOURTH major revision to deliveries.]</b>
</i><br>
<br>
------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
&quot;Over the 
past few months, we have taken strong actions to confront and overcome start-up 
issues on the program, and we have made solid progress,&quot; said Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Scott Carson. &quot;Nevertheless, the 
traveled work situation and some unanticipated rework have prevented us from 
hitting the milestones we laid out in January. Our revised schedule is built 
upon an achievable, high-confidence plan for getting us to our power-on and 
first-flight milestones. Also, while the fundamental technologies and design of 
the 787 remain sound, we have inserted some additional schedule margin for 
dealing with other issues we may uncover in testing prior to first flight and 
in the flight test program.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We deeply regret the 
disruption and disappointment these changes will cause for our customers, and 
we will work closely with each of them to minimize the impact,&quot; said 
Carson. &quot;We have taken significant action to improve supply chain and 
production system performance, such as our investment in Global Aeronautica, 
but based on our assessment, the prudent course is to proceed with a more 
gradual ramp up to full-rate production.&quot;&nbsp; 787 delay 
announcement&nbsp; - Apr 2008<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------- 
<br> <br>
&quot;While we have made some progress over the past several weeks 
completing work on our early production airplanes and improving parts 
availability across the production system, the pace of that progress has not 
been sufficient to support our previous plans for first delivery or first 
flight,&quot; said Scott Carson, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes.&quot;We deeply regret the impact these delays will have on our 
customers, and we are committed to working with them to minimize any disruption 
to their plans.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deliveries of the strong-selling Dreamliner are 
now slated to begin in late November or December 2008, versus an original 
target of May 2008. First flight is now anticipated around the end of first 
quarter 2008.&nbsp; 787 delay announcement - Oct 2007 <br>

<p>PARIS &ndash; The French co-CEO of Airbus parent EADS and the company's 
German chief of its civilian jet unit have been ousted in a dramatic shakeup, 
following devastating delays in the A380 superjumbo program.</p> 
<p>Parent company EADS vowed today to put Franco-German management tensions 
behind it and resolve the crisis at Boeing's chief competitor in the world 
commercial aviation market.</p> 
<p> &quot;We'll work hard and we'll work jointly to bring EADS back on 
course,&quot; former co-Chief Executive Noel Forgeard's replacement, Louis 
Gallois, said in a joint statement with German co-CEO Tom Enders, who survived 
the reshuffle.</p> 
<p> Politicians and trade unions welcomed the changes at EADS, announced 
Sunday, in which Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert was also forced to step down, and 
replaced by Frenchman Christian Streiff &mdash; a former executive with

<h1>Toyota's chief may be replaced</h1>
<p>Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe may be replaced next year by Akio 
Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder, after forecasting the first loss in 
70 years, people familiar with the matter said.</p> 
<p>Watanabe intends to take responsibility for Toyota's operating loss 
forecast of $1.7 billion for the year ending in March, said one of the people, 
who asked not to be identified because a decision hasn't been announced.</p>
<p>Toyota announces first loss since 1938. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>25 Dec 2008</p>  ----------------------------------------- <br>

<p>Toyota tapped Akio Toyoda, grandson of the Japanese automaker's founder, as 
president Tuesday, paying homage to its roots at a time when the company faces 
its first operating loss in 70 years.<br>
<br>
The U.S.-educated Toyoda, 52, is 
the first founding family member to take the helm at Japan's No. 1 automaker in 
14 years. He promised a reaffirmation of the company's core principles, such as 
valuing ideas from the ranks - a management approach called &quot;kaizen&quot; 
that has made Toyota Motor Corp.'s production methods famous in industry 
circles around the world.<br>
<br>
Analysts say Toyoda faces enormous 
challenges. Just hours before his appointment, Toyota announced that global 
sales last year fell for the first time in 10 years, falling 4 percent to 8.972 
million vehicles.<br>
<br>
&quot;Toyota is raising the flag,&quot; said Yasuaki 
Iwamoto, auto analyst at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. &quot;It sends a 
strong message that moves toward change will be sped up. And that's an 
important message.&quot;<br>

Aviation Week Year End Round-up<br>
<br>
&ldquo;There may be no 
better time to buy Boeing Co. stock.&rdquo;As I reflect on the 49 Market Focus 
columns we published this year, that&rsquo;s the one line I&rsquo;d like most 
to take back. It was written in March, after Boeing&rsquo;s shocking (and now 
overturned) loss of the U.S. Air Force tanker contract to an EADS NV-Northrop 
Grumman Corp. team. Boeing shares had declined from a peak of $107 five months 
earlier to less than $80.&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better believe this is not going to 
be an $80 stock,&rdquo; one bullish analyst was quoted as saying. He was 
technically correct: Shares were trading around $41 last week.<br>

Some Recent Program Quotes<br>

<br> Mar 2007 <br>
<br>
To hear Mike Bair tell it, the biggest problem with the 
new 787 Dreamliner manufacturing schedule has been the olive trees. <br>
<br>

The trees, that is, that Italian partner Alenia had to move before it could 
build its factory in Grottaglie, a city in southeast Italy. <br>
<br>

&quot;They had to transplant all the olive trees,&quot; Bair said. &quot; <br>

<br> In an apparent bid to convince skeptics Boeing will not falter as Airbus 
has done in the final stages of its new jet program, Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes CEO Scott Carson joined Bair on the call. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are 
doing what we do best at Boeing, and that is use all of our intelligence, 
skills and resources to make sure that we deliver,&quot; said Carson. <br>
<br>

------------------------------------ <br>
<br>
Sept 2007 <br>
<br>
A new delay 
of up to 12 weeks in the first 787 Dreamliner flight is fueling skepticism 
among aviation analysts that Boeing can deliver the pioneering all-composite 
airliner to its first customer next May as scheduled. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have a 
feeling May is not a reasonable date now,&quot; said Adam Pilarski, lead 
analyst with aviation consultancy Avitas. <br>
<br>
But Boeing executives 
insisted Wednesday they'll meet the timetable by having a large team of test 
pilots fly around the clock. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is this a fiasco in the making? I 
don't think so,&quot; said Howard Rubel, an analyst with Jefferies Group, 
&quot;There's nothing here that says they won't deliver a very flightworthy 
airplane.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We are moving forward,&quot; Bair said. 
&quot;We have an experienced team that understands the issues and knows how to 
bring home complex airplane programs like this.&quot; <br>
<br>

&quot;We are 
disappointed over the schedule changes that we are announcing today,&quot;said 
Boeing Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney. <br>
<br>

&quot;While we have made some progress over the past several weeks completing 
work on our early production airplanes and improving parts availability across 
the production system, the pace of that progress has not been sufficient to 
support our previous plans for first delivery or first flight,&quot; said Scott 
Carson, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.&quot;We deeply regret

<br>
We've just 
heard the last 787 delay call,&quot; said Joe Campbell, a Lehman Brothers 
analyst. &quot;I think they'll make this schedule from here in. They can do 
this.&quot; <br>
<br>
Boeing originally planned to deliver its first 787 next 
month. <br>
<br>
According to the new schedule laid out by Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes Chief Executive Scott Carson, the plane won't fly until October and 
won't be delivered until the third quarter of next year. <br>
<br>
Boeing also 
said it will build the planes more slowly, so its customers will get only 25 
Dreamliners next year, rather than the 109 proposed last fall. It will ramp up 
production to 10 per month by 2012. <br>
<br>
That small 2009 delivery total 
reassured observers because it seems more realistic than the previous forecast. 
<br> <br>
Boeing &quot;finally came up with a number that makes sense,&quot; 
said another prominent Wall Street analyst who asked not to be named because 
his investment bank doesn't permit him to be quoted in the media. <br>
<br>

Boeing's shares rose almost $4 on the news, closing at $78.60 &nbsp;($78 in 
April - $37 in December.) <br>
<br>
Lehman Brothers, in an analytical note 
published last week ahead of the announcement, estimated thata 14- to 16-month 
delay would add between $3 billion and $5 billion in extra manufacturing costs 
and customer contract penalties. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Over the past few months, 
we have taken strong actions to confront and overcome start-up issues on the 
program, and we have made solid progress,&quot; said Boeing Commercial 
Airplanes President and CEO Scott Carson. &quot;Nevertheless, thetraveled work 
situation and some unanticipated rework have prevented us from hitting the 
milestones we laid out in January. Our revised schedule is built upon an 
achievable, high-confidence plan for getting us to our power-on and 
first-flight milestones. Also, while the fundamental technologies and design of 
the 787 remain sound, we have inserted some additional schedule margin for 
dealing with other issues we may uncover in testing prior to first flight and 
in the flight test program.&quot; <br>
<br>
The company said in January it 
would be conducting a comprehensive assessment of its supply chain and 
production system capabilities to determine the details of the 787's flight 
test program and initial delivery profile. As a result of that assessment, the 
first-year delivery plan announced today will be followed by a more gradual 
ramp up to full-rate production than previously planned. <br>
<br>
&quot;We 
deeply regret the disruption and disappointment these changes will cause for 
our customers, and we will work closely with each of them to minimize the 
impact,&quot;said Carson. &quot;We have taken significant action to improve 
supply chain and production system performance, such as our investment in 
Global Aeronautica, but based on our assessment, the prudent course is to 
proceed with a more gradual ramp up to full-rate production.&quot; <br>

<p><strong>EVERETT, Wash., Dec. 11, 2008</strong> -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] today 
announced an updated schedule for its all-new 787 Dreamliner program that moves 
the commercial jet's first flight into the second quarter of 2009 and first 
delivery into the first quarter of 2010. The new schedule reflects the impact 
of disruption caused by the recent Machinists' strike along with the 
requirement to replace certain fasteners in early production airplanes.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our industry team has made progress with structural testing, systems 
hardware qualification, and production, but we must adjust our schedule for 
these two unexpected disruptions,&quot; said Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
President and CEO Scott Carson.</p> 
<p>Prior to the strike that halted much of the company's commercial airplane 
work from early September into November, the 787 was to make its first flight 
late in the fourth quarter of 2008. First delivery was slated for the third 
quarter of 2009.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're laser focused on what needs to be done to prepare for first 
flight,&quot; said Pat Shanahan, 787 program vice president. &quot;We will 
overcome this set of circumstances as we have others in the past, and we 
understand clearly what needs to be done moving forward.&quot;</p> 
<p>Included in the preparations for first flight, Shanahan said, are 
finalizing and incorporating remaining engineering changes and completing 
systems testing, qualifications and certification.</p> 
<p>Boeing is evaluating the specific impact of this delay on customer delivery 
dates and will provide customers with updated schedules once completed. The 
company is also determining any financial impact from this schedule change and 
will incorporate that into updated financial and overall airplane delivery 
guidance that will be released at a later date.</p>

Comment:<br>
<br>
No where is the word 
&quot;delayed&quot; or &quot;slide&quot; used - now the newspeak is 
&nbsp;simply &nbsp;&quot;updated schedule.&quot; &nbsp;Our recurring delays are 
&nbsp;now covered as just &nbsp;schedule 'updates.'<br>
<br>
Also, my math must 
be faulty, as I don't understand how a two month strike causes a six month 
schedule slide.<br>

Restructuring and leadership changes <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> As you know, we currently have a record jetliner backlog, while 
at the same time we have encountered challenges in our airplane development 
programs and within our supply chain. The current economic slump is further 
compounding difficulties for our customers, who urgently need the newest and 
most efficient jetliners to help them succeed in today&rsquo;s dynamic and 
competitive environment. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> Today we are announcing a series of leadership changes and a 
restructuring to better align resources across development programs and 
strengthen our oversight of the global supply chain. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Carolyn 
Corvi</b>, who previously led Airplane Programs, has decided to retire at the 
end of December after a 34-year Boeing career. Carolyn has been a driving force 
behind the company&rsquo;s successful implementation of lean production 
techniques. On behalf of everyone at Commercial Airplanes and the entire Boeing 
enterprise, I want to thank Carolyn for her outstanding vision and leadership 
in transforming our production system and dramatically improving our 
productivity throughout her career. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Ray Conner
</b> is named vice president and general manager of a new organization, Supply 
Chain Management and Operations. Ray reports directly to me, and his new 
organization combines Supplier Management, Fabrication, Propulsion Systems and 
the Manufacturing and Quality functional organization. Ray brings years of 
experience in sales, program management, manufacturing and supply chain 
management. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Pat 
Shanahan</b> is named vice president and general manager of a restructured 
Airplane Programs organization. Pat reports directly to me, and his 
organization is responsible for all current commercial airplane production and 
development programs, including the 787 and 747-8. Pat has an excellent track 
record as a program management executive in both Commercial Airplanes and 
Integrated Defense Systems. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> The new Airplane Programs and Supply Chain Management and 
Operations organizations will work together closely to drive lean initiatives, 
productivity and execution throughout the entire global value chain. The 
ultimate goal is to deliver value to our customers and protect our 
competitiveness in this challenging market environment. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> In addition, we&rsquo;re announcing the following leadership 
changes: <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Scott 
Fancher</b>, who previously was vice president and general manager of IDS 
Missile Defense Systems, is named vice president and general manager of the 787 
program, reporting directly to Pat Shanahan. Scott brings demonstrated 
leadership in program management, systems integration and technology 
development to the 787 program. <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Marlin 
Dailey</b> is named vice president of Sales for Commercial Airplanes, replacing 
Ray Conner. Marlin, who most recently led the Commercial Airplanes Sales 
efforts in Europe, Russia and Central Asia, reports directly to me.&nbsp; <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> All of these appointments reflect great depth and strength in 
our management team and position us for continued success. I look forward to 
the leadership of these individuals, and I&rsquo;m counting on your support as 
we face the challenges and opportunities in the year ahead.&nbsp; <br>

***The following message is being sent to all 787 employees from Scott<br>
 
Fancher, 787 vice president and general manager.***<br>
<br>
 787 announces 
realignment<br>
<br>
 Hello 787 Team,<br>
<br>
 We continue to make solid 
progress toward first flight. In the past two<br>
 weeks alone we have 
completed systems/structure integration testing,<br>
 factory gauntlet, first 
flight static test conditions, and ground<br>
 vibration tests. Last Monday, 
Airplane 1 left the factory for the last<br>
 time to complete inspections of 
the fuel tanks in preparation for<br>
 fueling. And yesterday Airplane 1 
transitioned to the flight line to<br>
 begin the final push to first flight. 
Your teamwork, commitment and<br>
 leadership have made this possible.<br>
<br>

 As we approach first flight, the Leadership Team has taken time to<br>
 
reflect on where the program is going. Managing a complex flight test<br>
 
program, ramping to rate and customer support, combined with the<br>
 
development of the 787-9, requires a flexible organizational structure<br>
 to 
ensure all of our commitments are met. As a team, we developed a set<br>
 of 
&quot;first principles&quot; to guide these discussions:<br>
<br>
 We have one 
program and one integrated work statement to deliver<br>
 Product integrity 
cannot be violated.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Clear Responsibility, Accountability and 
Authority (RAA) is essential<br>
 Commitments to our customers and shareholders 
must be met<br>
 Balanced focus on product, customer, and services must be 
maintained<br>
 After much discussion, we have come to the conclusion that a<br>
 product-team-focused organization is essential to meeting these<br>
 
imperatives. Today, we are announcing a re-alignment of the 787 program<br>
 to 
strengthen the Life Cycle Product Team (LCPT) that we have today.<br>
<br>
 
Product development efforts will be aligned under Mark Jenks for the<br>
 787-9 
and Dan Mooney for the 787-8. Mark and Dan will partner to lead<br>
 this 
organization which will consist of LCPTs that have total RAA for<br>
 the 
design, development, integration, test, build, delivery and support<br>
 for 
the systems and structures on the program. Existing engineering,<br>
 supplier 
management, services and support teams will be product aligned<br>
 and 
assigned to these LCPTs. We also are significantly expanding the<br>
 role of 
our Airplane Level Integration Team to include the systems<br>
 engineering 
activities which are critical to the ongoing development<br>
 efforts on the 
program.<br>
<br>
 We also are augmenting our Chief Project Engineering (CPE) 
organization<br>
 led by Mike Delaney. Chief Engineer roles are being added for 
systems<br>
 and structures, as well as adding program certification and 
safety. Mike<br>
 Sinnett is named Chief Engineer Systems, and Jim Ogonowski is 
named<br>
 Chief Engineer Structures. This expanded role of the CPE will ensure
<br> design integrity across the program.<br>
<br>
 Bob Noble will continue to 
lead our supply chain efforts in partnership<br>
 with Tim Coyle.&nbsp; Bob's 
focus will be to support the LCPTs on supplier<br>
 issues, integrate business 
and execution issues with our partners and<br>
 oversee our remote-site 
efforts. Tim will continue to provide direct<br>
 leadership for all of our 
Charleston, South Carolina activities.<br>
<br>
 Mike Fleming will continue to 
lead our Services efforts to prepare for<br>
 delivery and support of our 
products. Mike will provide integration of<br>
 all of these activities and 
work with the LCPTs to ensure services<br>
 products are delivered on-time and 
meet our customer's expectations.<br>
<br>
 Pat Kelley will continue to lead 
our Final Assembly efforts as we<br>
 complete our flight test airplanes and 
begin to ramp to rate for<br>
 production.<br>
<br>
 Barb O'Dell will continue 
to lead our Quality efforts as we complete the<br>
 alignment of factory and 
supplier quality under a single program quality<br>
 organization.<br>
<br>
We 
also are pleased to announce the selection of several new LCPT<br>
 leaders. 
Each of these leaders brings a wealth of technical knowledge<br>
 and team 
leadership experience to his assignment, consistent with our<br>
 new LCPT 
structure, and will report to Mark and Dan. Please join me in<br>
 welcoming 
them to these new roles and the team:<br>
<br>
 *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kevin Crowley is named the 787 director for the Systems LCPT.
<br> Kevin joined the 787 team in 2008 and successfully led the Hamilton<br>
 
Sundstrand team to flight qualification. Kevin was previously the<br>
 director 
of SBINET Program Management Office in Integrated Defense<br>
 Systems.<br>
<br>
 *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurt Kraft, currently the director of 
787 Airframe, is named<br>
 the 787 director of the Forward and Aft Body LCPT. 
Kurt has extensive<br>
 787 product knowledge and is a strong technical leader, 
which will be<br>
 key to this challenging work statement.<br>
<br>
 *&nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric Lindblad, currently the director of 747 
Manufacturing, is<br>
 named the 787 director of the Mid-body LCPT.. Eric's 
extensive<br>

addition<br>
 to the team.<br>
<br>
 *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cliff Hall joins the 787 team as leader for the Wing LCPT.<br>
 Cliff comes to us from the International Tankers program where he was<br>
 the 
program manager. His program management role and previous experience<br>
 in 
metal and composites structures design make him a great addition to<br>
 the 
team.<br>
<br>
 *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie Hix and Tom

Boeing Names Shanahan to Lead 
787 Program, Bair to Lead Business Strategy and Marketing <br>

<p> <strong>SEATTLE, Oct. 16, 2007</strong> -- Boeing Commercial Airplanes 
President and CEO Scott Carson today named Pat Shanahan vice president and 
general manager of the 787 program. Shanahan moves from vice president, Missile 
Defense Systems at Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, and succeeds Mike Bair, 
who will become vice president Business Strategy and Marketing for Commercial 
Airplanes, replacing Mike Cave, whose move to a position at Boeing Corporate 
Offices was announced earlier today.</p> 
<p>Both changes are effective immediately. </p> 
<p>&quot;Pat's experience and proven record managing demanding and complex 
programs will allow him to build on the 787 team's success as we tackle the 
challenges we face in bringing our new production system fully on line,&quot; 
Carson said. &quot;He knows how to deliver results, understands our customers 
and their requirements, and has the leadership skills to get the job done.</p> 
<p>&quot;Mike has taken the 787 program from a concept to a market-leading 
position,&quot; Carson added. &quot;The customer focus and knowledge he brings 
from that experience--as well as the insight and knowledge of our new business 
model and supplier base--will help us immeasurably as we take our next steps 
with future products, services and business strategy.&quot;</p> 
<p>The move marks a return to Commercial Airplanes for Shanahan, who has led 
both the 757 and 767-400ER programs. He moved to IDS in 2002, first to lead 
Boeing's Rotorcraft division, operated from the company's Philadelphia and Mesa 
sites, before taking over leadership of Boeing's missile defense 
programs--including the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System (GMD)--in 2004.
</p> 
<p>Boeing is the prime contractor on the GMD, leading a team of top aerospace 
companies that have successfully developed, tested and deployed a highly 
innovative and technically complex system for defending against ballistic 
missile attacks. The latest test of the system--the technical challenges of 
which are often described as &quot;hitting a bullet with a 
bullet&quot;--occurred Sept. 28 when the Boeing-led GMD system was able to 
track, intercept and destroy a ballistic missile target over the Pacific Ocean.
</p> 
<p>Bair has been responsible for all aspects of the 787 program since its 
launch in 2004. The 787--which will provide airlines with unmatched fuel 
efficiency, environmental performance and passenger comfort--has enjoyed the 
most successful launch of any airplane program in the history of commercial 
aviation, with 710 orders from 50 airlines from around the world.</p> 
<p>Previously, Bair served as vice president and general manager for 
Commercial Aviation Services, where he was credited with successfully 
restructuring the services business for improved competitiveness and 
performance.&nbsp;</p> Boeing 787 Program Ends Year with Celebration of Progress
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> <strong>EVERETT, Wash. , Dec. 06, 2006</strong> -- Customers, partners and 
employees gathered at the Boeing [NYSE: BA] Everett factory today to celebrate 
the virtual rollout of the Boeing787 Dreamliner and the program's progress over 
the last year.</p> 
<p>Mike Bair, vice president and general manager of the 787 program, hosted 
the event.</p> 
<p>&quot;Today's virtual rollout is the culmination of many months of effort 
by thousands of team members at Boeing and its 787 partners,&quot; said Bair. 
&quot;Through the use of our new digital toolset, provided by Dassault 
Systemes, the team has proven the ability to manufacture 787 designs.&quot;</p> 
<p>While the detailed analysis and demonstrations created by the team remain 
proprietary for competitive reasons, the program did share a number of 
engineering-based simulations ranging from part installations to the final 
assembly factory flow in Everett.</p> 
<p>&quot;The engineering data behind these simulations gives us confidence in 
our assembly processes and our ability to meet our commitments to our 
customers,&quot; Bair said. &quot;Our tools have enabled us to model the entire 
production process from our partners' factories to our own. We have found 
errors in simulation that would have been costly to find in production and have 
been able to design corrections quickly to keep the program on track.&quot;</p> 
<p>For many of the partners, the simulations were paired with footage of 
actual work on their first test and production parts.</p> 
<p>During the ceremony, Bair said that the first production wire bundle had 
been delivered from Labinal to Korean Air's Aerospace Division for installation 
in the wing tip being manufactured in Korea.</p> 
<p>In addition, the program unveiled the new paint scheme for its 747-400 
Large Cargo Freighters and announced that those airplanes will be named 
&quot;Dreamlifters.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The Dreamlifter is a vital tool that allows us to create a production 
flow around the world that is very efficient,&quot; said Bair. &quot;We look 
forward to receiving the second Dreamlifter from EGAT in Taiwan early next 
month. It will arrive in Seattle already painted and ready to participate in 
the ongoing flight test program.&quot;</p> 
<p>Additionally, the program unveiled the Dreamliner Gallery, a new facility 
in Everett, Wash., that provides 787 airline customers a more streamlined 
approach to airplane configuration.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Gallery provides a single location for airlines to configure 
their 787s,&quot; said Bair. &quot;All catalog selections will be physically 
present in the Gallery for customers to see, touch and evaluate prior to 
selection. Previously, this was done at various locations around the 
world.&quot;</p> 
<p>Also in preparation for the airplane's entry into service, Boeing is 
working with ANA and Northwest Airlines on a Service Ready Operational 
Validation program that will happen at the end of the flight test program and 
prior to first deliveries. A 787 will be used on actual airline routes, 
replicating the rigors and demands of commercial service.</p> 
<p>&quot;This is similar to the programs we have used with great success on 
other programs,&quot; said Bair. &quot;It is one of the last steps we take to 
ensure that the airplane, the airlines, and the infrastructure are ready for 
787 revenue service.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bair congratulated the team for a spectacular 2006 and reminded everyone 
that 2007 is when many of the program's major milestones must be completed.</p> 
<p>&quot;We open our Everett factory next year and start producing 
airplanes,&quot; Bair said. &quot;We will have our rollout and first flight and 
will begin the flight test program. Every year has been important as we move 
toward starting deliveries in 2008 but next year will be the most demanding 
experience for many of us.</p> 
<p>&quot;This is why we came to work for Boeing,&quot; he added, &quot;to 
create new airplanes that bring new levels of performance to our customers and 
new levels of comfort and convenience to the passengers of the world.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's a challenge, no doubt about it. This is the team, all of us 
together - our customers, our partners and each of us - who will bring this 
airplane to life. It's an amazing journey from where we started just four years 
ago. But the best part is yet to come.&quot;</p> <br>

How Boeing P.R. 
brags about a Program &nbsp;in a Train Wreck.<br>
<br>
BOEING FRONTIERS JUNE 
2008 <br>
<br>
&quot;Leadership champs&quot; <br>
<br>
How an IDS program 
thanks employees for exemplifying leadership <br>
<br>
<br>
Employees in 
Integrated Defense Systems&rsquo; Airborne Early Warning <br>
and Control 
program are receiving impromptu visits from program <br>
executives. But 
there&rsquo;s no reason for these teammates to panic. <br>
These visits are 
meant to thank people for a job well done. <br>
AEW&amp;C program executives 
spend time each week learning leader- <br>
ship lessons from their employees. 
Their staff meetings include time to <br>
recognize program teammates who 
recently have exemplified one or <br>
more of the Boeing Leadership Attributes. 
<br> <br>
&ldquo;After we&rsquo;ve identified someone and discussed how they 
specifi- <br>
cally demonstrated a leadership attribute, one of us volunteers 
to con- <br>
tact that employee in his or her work area,&rdquo; said Maureen 
Dougherty, <br>
vice president/program manager, AEW&amp;C. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 
nothing formal. We just <br>
want to say &lsquo;thanks,&rsquo; let them know 
that they&rsquo;ve been recognized, and <br>
reinforce the leadership qualities 
they demonstrate.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
Dougherty said recognizing leaders this way 
has been a practice in <br>
AEW&amp;C for about a year. It was, in part, a 
response to the Employee <br>
Survey, which showed that employees wanted better 
recognition for <br>
good work. It also challenged the leadership team to spend 
more time <br>
focusing on the leadership attributes.&quot; Many of these 
stories are inspir- <br>
ing and give us ideas on how we can improve our own 
leadership skills,&rdquo; <br>
Dougherty said. <br>
<br>
Response to the 
program has been good. Employees are taken by <br>
surprise when an executive 
shows up at their work stations to say&quot; thank <br>
 you&quot; for 
demonstrating strong leadership in a tough environment. It also <br>
gets a 
positive response from nearby co-workers.&nbsp; About half the people <br>

recognized are managers, and half are nonmanagers. <br>
<br>
In most cases, the 
executive contacting the employee is not part of <br>
that employee&rsquo;s 
chain of command; instead, the executive is there rep- <br>
resenting the 
leadership team. Dougherty noted that this strengthens <br>
integration and 
collaboration across the organization. <br>
<br>
Mike Harlan &ndash; When a new 
program plan was developed to meet delivery dates in <br>
Project Wedgetail, 
Mike Harlan, AEW&amp;C flight-test team leader, and his team were <br>
brought 
in to develop a flight-test plan. For his quick work, Harlan was contacted by 
the <br>
head of AEW&amp;C, Maureen Dougherty, who told him his contributions 
had been recognized <br>
by the leadership team. &ldquo;It was quite a surprise 
to be recognized,&rdquo; Harlan said. &ldquo;I was <br>
part of a team of 
really smart and innovative people who rolled up their sleeves and found <br>
a 
way forward through a challenging situation.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
Jeanne Simeona 
&ndash; Responding to an immediate need for a <br>
critical skill manager in 
Turkey, Human Resources representative <br>
Jeanne Simeona expeditiously worked 
through the procedures <br>
needed to find the right candidate for the job. 
Consequently, the <br>
position with the Peace Eagle program was filled 
quickly; and <br>
the program&rsquo;s leader, Mark Ellis, brought 
Simeona&rsquo;s good work <br>
to the attention of the AEW&amp;C leadership 
team. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve suggested <br>
to HR management that these leadership 
recognitions be made <br>
a best practice,&rdquo; Simeona said. <br>
<br>
The 
team recognizes three to five employees each week.The recognition is strictly 
verbal&mdash;no <br>
award, object or gift is presented&mdash;and Dougherty 
believes the simplicity of the approach makes <br>
it more meaningful. <br>
<br>
While there&rsquo;s no requirement that AEW&amp;C groups use this recognition 
strategy, Dougherty said <br>
some are taking a similar approach. Word about 
its success has been spreading across IDS. <br>
Dougherty emphasized that 
leadership must go beyond the management ranks for a program <br>
to be 
successful. &ldquo;The programs and systems we&rsquo;re working on are so 
complex and geographi- <br>
cally dispersed, it&rsquo;s critically important 
that we have strong leaders throughout the organization,&rdquo; <br>
she 
said.&quot; We need people who can use their skills and experience to step up 
and take on the big <br>
challenges.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
She added, however, that 
people must be thoughtful enough to understand when they should <br>
be leading 
and when they should be following. The best leaders know how to do both. <br>

<b>Book hails 
McNerney as 787 problems persist</b> 
<p><i>Last updated December 15, 2008 5:22 p.m. PT</i></p> 
<p><b>By BILL VIRGIN</b><br>
 P-I COLUMNIST</p> 
<p>WHAT IS IT about Boeing executives and the timing of books by and about 
them?</p> 
<p>Five years ago, a preview copy of Chief Financial Officer Mike Sears' book, 
&quot;Soaring Through Turbulence,&quot; arrived in our newsroom about the same 
time he was fired in a defense contracting scandal.</p> 
<p>Last week brought a review copy of a new book, to be published in early 
January, by management consultant Peter Cohan, &quot;You Can't Order Change: 
Lessons From Jim McNerney's Turnaround at Boeing.&quot;</p> 
<p>The book arrived on the same day that Boeing announced yet another delay in 
the 787, and yet another shake-up in the management team overseeing that 
project.</p> 
<p>Trying to keep pace with breaking news and current events is often a risky 
proposition for print media, none more so than book publishing, what with its 
long lead times for researching, writing and production.</p> 
<p>Still, recent history -- generally and specifically -- would suggest that a 
degree of caution might be in order before anointing a CEO as the latest 
management guru. Hero worship of corporate CEOs was out of favor even before 
the stock market and the economy took a header, and it won't be until well 
after the calamity has passed that we know who really could run a company and 
who just talked a good game.</p> 
<p>Today's genius can be tomorrow's bum. American Banker, after all, famously 
named Washington Mutual's Kerry Killinger its 2001 &quot;Banker of the 
Year,&quot; a recognition it is unlikely to repeat for 2008. And the story 
offered for public consumption is often far different from what's observed by 
those on the inside, when it comes to assessing credit and blame.</p> 
<p>(It should be noted that, unlike Sears' book, McNerney didn't write this 
one. Indeed, direct quotes from McNerney in &quot;You Can't Order Change&quot; 
come from press releases and speeches, the endnotes indicate no interviews with 
him, and a Boeing spokesman confirms that there were no interviews or contact 
with McNerney for the book.)</p> 
<p>In the specific case of Boeing, the dust-jacket blurb for Cohan's book 
calls McNerney &quot;a rising superstar among today's CEOs.&quot; Contrast the 
book's laudatory tone for McNerney's job at Boeing since joining the company in 
mid-2005 with the current score card of performance: continuing problems on 
getting the 787 to market, the hit to its credibility with investors and 
customers, lingering questions about Boeing's long-term production strategies, 
a bruising 57-day strike by Machinists in this state and contentious 
negotiations with SPEEA, and a stock price that is less than half of where it 
was earlier this year, and is below when McNerney took over.</p> 
<p>Some of those events, like the strike, likely occurred after the book's 
writing. But others, such as the 787 delays, were already well known and in 
fact are extensively discussed in the book.</p> 
<p>To the extent that Boeing's stock price slump is the result of the economic 
downturn, McNerney gets a mulligan. Boeing did not create the recession. 
Investors hate pretty much every stock at the moment, regardless of how well or 
poorly managed those companies are individually. Regardless of whether it had a 
hand in lighting the fire, every company is likely to get singed by the 
recession.</p> 
<p>But to the extent that the stock price reflects investor unhappiness over 
Boeing's inability to deliver on promises for the 787 -- that one clearly is 
his.</p> 
<p>There is little that is radical, or terribly new, about McNerney's 
management philosophy, at least as explained in &quot;You Can't Order 
Change.&quot; Among the highlights: an emphasis on developing leaders within 
the company. Tying compensation policy to long-term growth in value instead of 
short-term stock-price gains. Increasing intracompany teamwork. Depending more 
on internal growth than acquisitions for growth. Boosting productivity and 
building global product development. Taking the lead in ethics compliance and 
environmental change.</p> 
<p>But if bromides and bullet points were all there were to running a large 
corporation, anyone with a management textbook could do it. The tricky part is 
execution, as Boeing and McNerney have discovered, particularly on those items 
related to productivity and global product development.</p> 
<p>&quot;McNerney isn't satisfied just to look at Boeing abilities versus 
Airbus,&quot; Cohan writes. &quot;He looks up and down the chain of potential 
suppliers, and if he sees that someone else can do a job better than Boeing, he 
will outsource the job so that Boeing can focus on doing what it does best and 
deliver the best product to customers.&quot;</p> 
<p>But as the book notes later, McNerney's objectives of relying more on 
suppliers &quot;were ambitious, and in seeking to achieve them, he ran into 
problems.&quot; In some cases it has meant dispatching teams of Boeing 
employees to suppliers and subcontractors to unsnarl snags and correct 
production problems. In one instance, Boeing bought a partner out of a joint 
venture to do the job itself.</p> 
<p>Cohan's book assigns blame for the 787's delays on an unrealistic rollout 
timetable (the drive by marketing to have it occur on 7/08/07) and a lack of 
accurate information from subordinates. McNerney, he says, &quot;has shifted 
from a delegate-and-trust approach to a trust-but-verify one.&quot;</p> 
<p>Adds Cohan, &quot;Though the delay in delivering the 787 is disappointing 
to Boeing's customers and clearly demonstrates its need to improve, McNerney's 
efforts to confront and overcome Boeing's problems are likely to make Boeing a 
stronger competitor.&quot; The global product development supply model, he 
says, will &quot;pay off in the long run.&quot;</p> 
<p>Those are hopes and predictions, though, not assertions supported at the 
moment by the record. Would Boeing have run into the same problems with the 787 
had Harry Stonecipher not been caught canoodling via company e-mail with an 
underling and stayed on as CEO? We'll never know.</p> 
<p>Is McNerney the right guy to correct Boeing's problems? Maybe we'll know in 
a couple of years. (In a bit of unintentional and inadvertent brilliance, 
McNerney may get bailed out of some displeasure over the 787 delays if the 
recession -- in the form of reduced passenger traffic -- and lower fuel prices 
make airlines less impatient to get the planes they've ordered.)</p> 
<p>And does the global development and supply model really work, or does it 
generate more problems than it solves? There's a question upon which Boeing's 
future rests -- and which, whatever the answer, might even make for an 
instructive management-theory book for would-be CEOs.</p> <br>

<p>Aerospace and defense companies are beginning to disclose their executive 
compensation for 2008, andthough the industry&rsquo;s investors have lost a lot 
of money some of its top executives aren&rsquo;t faring too poorly.</p> Boeing 
Co. had a rough year, with more delays to its new 787 jet, a machinists strike, 
a downturn in demand for commercial aircraft and numerous challenges in its 
defense unit. The company&rsquo;s net income was down 34% from 2007 and its 
share price declined by more than 50%. Yet three of Boeing&rsquo;s top four 
executives received hefty raises, according to data from Equilar Inc., an 
executive compensation research firm. 
<p>Chairman, President and CEO James McNerney&rsquo;s total compensation was 
up 14% from 2007 to $14,765,410, including a 43% hike in his cash bonus to more 
than $6 million. CFO James Bell and James Albaugh, president of the Integrated 
Defense Systems unit, each received 23% increases, with Albaugh&rsquo;s 
compensation reaching $5,089,237. The exception was Scott Carson, president of 
the Commercial Airplanes unit. His compensation declined more than 18% to 
$3,213,486 and his bonus was cut 13% to $854,610.</p> 
<p>Lockheed Martin Corp. Chairman, President and CEO Robert Stevens took a 5% 
pay cut in 2008&mdash;but still made $22,863,062, including a $12.8-million 
cash bonus and $7.8 million in stock and option awards. The next-highest 
compensation went to Executive Vice President Christopher E. Kubasik, who runs 
Lockheed Martin&rsquo;s Electronic Systems business. He took home $5,523,153, a 
3% decline.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Note:<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lockheed's Revenues increased 2.1% 2007-2008; Net Income increased 6.1%;</p>
<p>LMT Stk price decline 1 year - 40%&nbsp; (BA -60%.)&nbsp; 2 year -30% (BA 
-60%)</p> 
<p>Over two years 2006-2008, LMT's Revenues increased 35.4%;&nbsp; Net Income 
increased 27.2%<br>
 &nbsp;</p> <br>
Here's what's important these days - 
skylights, upgraded restrooms, better signs and &nbsp;a new bus stop.<br>
<br>

Say, Ross, how many 787s rolled out or flew this year? &nbsp;747/767/777s? 
&nbsp;Didn't you deliver any airplanes - you know - AIRPLANES???<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br> 
<p><em>***This message is being sent to all Everett site employees on behalf 
of Ross R. Bogue, vice president and general manager of 747 Program and Everett 
Site.***</em></p> 
<p>Reflections on 2008</p> 
<p>Before we close the books on 2008 and depart for the holiday break I want 
to reflect on the past year. Clearly, 2008 has been another eventful year for 
Boeing Commercial Airplanes and for the Everett site. We witnessed many 
positive achievements and some unfortunate events as well, such as the strike 
by our Machinist co-workers amid the backdrop of national and international 
economic turmoil. Just last week, a reorganization of Airplane Programs and the 
establishment of the Supply Chain Management and Operations organization were 
announced. We may yet encounter other changes resulting from the transition to 
those reorganized groups in the New Year. But for now we should all remain 
focused on supporting our customers, implementing the Boeing Production System 
and producing the most exceptional airplanes in the world.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Each individual program and site organization made progress this year as 
well as faced a boatload of unexpected challenges. Many of you have seen a 
message from your respective program or organization leaders this week in that 
regard.&nbsp; The purpose of this message is to acknowledge the myriad other 
activities that have taken place on the Everett site to reduce the site&rsquo;s 
impact on the environment and improve office space and the flow of people and 
vehicles and material.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) performance:</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> &bull; Lowest lost work day case rate in site history<br>

&bull; Most successful EHS and Ergonomics Fair to date with 15,000 attendees<br>
&bull; Workplace basics implemented site wide<br>
&bull; Tobacco Free Workplace 
implemented site wide<br>
&bull; The Environmental Management system 
strengthened: ISO 14001 periodic audits passed successfully; zero notices of 
violation and zero fines levied.<br>
&bull; Outstanding performance on all 
environmental measures:&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;site energy 
consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous waste generation,and&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use of hazardous materials well under their reduction 
targets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;water conservation met the reduction 
target<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;solid waste recycling rates over the 
target<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;alternative commuting participation 
exceeded a new stretch target by 9 percent<br>
<br>
<strong>Future Factory 
progress:</strong> <br>
&bull; Twenty-five skylights installed (one previously 
installed in 2007)<br>
&bull; Ten factory restroom pairs upgraded with new 
fixtures, partitions, flooring, basins, wall coverings,&nbsp;and improved 
ventilation<br>
&bull; More than 2,500 people moved into eight renovated office 
towers that include up to 150 meeting spaces, or three times more than in the 
office areas they have replaced<br>
&bull; Two new multipurpose rooms provided 
&ndash; one near the 747 and one near the 767<br>
&bull; Directional and 
location signage &ndash; or wayfinding &ndash; installed to help people 
efficiently get where they are going.<strong><br>
<br>
</strong><strong>
Logistics and efficiency improvements:</strong> <br>
&bull; Clearly marked and 
reconfigured walkways, traffic lanes and fire lanes inside the factories 
improve the safety and efficiency of material handling and pedestrian and 
vehicle movement<br>
&bull; New walkways, channeling fencing, lighting and 
reconfigured parking stalls create a safer environment and improve the flow of 
pedestrians and vehicles on the south apron and west and north sides<br>
&bull; 
A new bus plaza, turnstiles and better gate access improve the flow of people 
and vehicles on the west and north sides<br>
&bull; Redrawn traffic lanes and 
staging areas boost material handling safety and efficiency and improve traffic 
flow on the south apron<br>
&bull; Inside and outside shuttles to help 
employees get to and from parking lots and move around the site efficiently and 
without their personal vehicles <br>
The December 2008/January 2009 issue of 
Frontiers magazine features many of these activities, which is a fitting 
tribute to the hard work by many on this site.&nbsp; Clickhere to view the 
feature article and photo spread on Future Factory andhere for the article on 
parking and sidewalks.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
During 2009 we will see additional 
changes and more safety and environmental improvements on the site. Future 
Factory will wind down with the installation of nine additional skylights and 
additional office tower construction projects. Future Factory will then 
transition to Future Office (which will we hear more about in the coming 
months). Safety and efficiency improvements will extend to the factory&rsquo;s 
east side and flight line. And, we will continue to focus on all environmental 
measures and maintain Everett as an environmental leader and innovator.&nbsp; 
<br> Finally, with the changing dynamics of the national and global economies, 
it is difficult to predict what the future may hold for our business. All I can 
say with certainty is that Boeing, and in particular the employees on the 
Everett site, will overcome any future challenges with creativity, 
resourcefulness and perseverance.&nbsp; <br>
Thank you for all you did this 
year for Boeing, the Everett site and for your program or organization. I also 
want to acknowledge and thank those individuals who will have to work during 
the holiday break. We fully appreciate your dedication.&nbsp; <br>
Have a 
wonderful and safe holiday season and break.<br>

<h1>Boeing delay hurt its credibility on Wall Street</h1> Wed Jan 16, 2008 
3:37pm EST <br>

<p>By Bill Rigby - Analysis</p> 
<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you want to know what's going on with Boeing Co's 
new 787 Dreamliner, ask anybody but Boeing.</p> 
<p>The U.S. aircraft maker has consistently been late acknowledging problems 
with its new high-tech plane, long after industry blogs and Wall Street 
analysts have blown the whistle.</p> 
<p>The company generally declines to answer specific questions about the 
project and the sheer inaccuracy of its projections are eroding its credibility.
</p> 
<p>Boeing's problems are starting to resemble the spiraling setbacks at rival 
Airbus, whose A380 superjumbo was two years late, throwing parent EADS into 
financial disarray and ending the careers of several executives.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday, the U.S. plane maker finally faced up to the second major 
delay on the revolutionary, carbon-fiber aircraft, putting it about nine months 
behind its original schedule.</p> 
<p>The announcement, only a month after Boeing executives assured investors 
everything was on track, was widely predicted by industry watchers.</p> 
<p>The delay forced Boeing to concede it will not build 109 787s by the end of 
2009, an ambitious promise that most analysts had already lost faith in.</p> 
<p>Wall Street is now asking why the latest assurances should be any more 
reliable than the last.</p> 
<p>&quot;Another delay, with no revised delivery schedule, and no guarantee 
that there will not be further push-outs,&quot; said Robert Stallard at Bank of 
America, in a research note. &quot;(That) leaves Boeing investors in a 
difficult position.&quot;</p> 
<p>UNRAVELING FAST</p> 
<p>The latest delay caps a remarkable six months of unraveling for Boeing's 
787 program.</p> 
<p>A gleaming shell of the first plane was triumphantly paraded in front of 
15,000 employees and customers in July 2007, amid confident forecasts the first 
test flight would be in August or September. Boeing now says it will not fly 
until at least June this year, as it grapples with unfinished work from 
suppliers and bolt shortages.</p> 
<p>Wall Street is now taking a &quot;show me&quot; stance on the company, 
whose shares have plummeted since last summer.</p> 
<p>&quot;Boeing is likely to remain under pressure until they can hit at least 
one of their public milestones on the program,&quot; said Myles Walton at 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p> 
<p>The company's stock performance reflects the loss of confidence. The shares 
are down 26 percent from their all-time high last July, before the 787 schedule 
started falling behind.</p> 
<p>Some analysts say the dip is a good time to buy shares, but more rate 
Boeing stock a &quot;hold&quot; until uncertainty clears.</p> 
<p>&quot;Investors are likely to require clear signs that this is the last of 
the delays, which will take some months to prove out,&quot; said Heidi Wood at 
Morgan Stanley.</p> 
<p>CREDIBILITY TEST</p> 
<p>Boeing is starting to feel the heat.</p> 
<p>&quot;We know our credibility is being tested on this program,&quot; said 
Scott Carson, the chief of Boeing's commercial plane unit, on a conference call 
on Wednesday. &quot;We will pass this test.&quot;</p> 
<p>But given the complexity and necessary secrecy of the program, Boeing is 
struggling to point to concrete achievements that are moving the plane along.
</p> 
<p>The head of the 787 program, Pat Shanahan, spoke of &quot;demonstrated 
performance&quot; on certain areas of the plane on Wednesday, but did not go 
into specifics, leaving the question of Boeing's credibility still largely a 
matter of trust.</p> 
<p>Boeing attempted to defuse the credibility issue by withdrawing delivery 
targets for any 787s beyond the first one, now scheduled for early 2009.</p> 
<p>Carson said the company needs to do more work before it establishes a new 
production schedule, based on &quot;hard, assessed facts,&quot; rather than 
&quot;shallower analysis,&quot; an acknowledgment that its previous projections 
were seriously flawed.</p> 
<p>It was a painful moment for Carson and Boeing generally. Delaying the 
schedule was &quot;a difficult call for us to make,&quot; he said, on the 
conference call to analysts and reporters. &quot;We don't want to be in a 
position where we do all this with you again.&quot;</p> BOEING'S ARROGANT IMAGE 
MUST GO, STONECIPHER SAYS<br>
<br>
BY KAREN WEST P-I Reporter<br>
Thursday, 
March 26, 1998<br>
<br>
In a blunt assessment of the new Boeing Co., its 
president said yesterday the company is still struggling to shed its longtime 
image as unwieldy and arrogant and has not yet reached the ``global 
status&quot; it is striving for.<br>
<br>
Harry Stonecipher also said he's 
embarrassed by the company's ``dismal&quot; 1997 financial performance and is 
determined to turn things around.<br>
<br>
``We at Boeing are struggling to 
shake off vestiges of parochialism and insularity in the way we think,&quot; 
Stonecipher said in a speech to the Rotary Club of Seattle yesterday. ``We've 
been a very inwardly looking company. People like to call us global - we sell 
lots of products globally - but we haven't yet achieved the global status that 
we seek.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since joining Boeing as the company's No. 2 executive 
last August, Stonecipher has been on a mission to improve Boeing's bottom line.
<br><br>
Known as a corporate ``turnaround king,&quot; the 60-year-old 
``Tennessee hillbilly&quot; has had lots of practice.<br>
<br>
Before becoming 
president and chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, Stonecipher spent seven 
years turning around Sundstrand Corp., a maker of aerospace products that had 
faced scandals and criminal charges related to military contracts.<br>
<br>
The 
key to profits, Stonecipher said, is to lower operating costs and be willing to 
change - areas Boeing still needs to work on.<br>
<br>
And to reach global 
status, Boeing has to ``embrace the world, engage the world&quot; and be open 
to new ideas.<br>
<br>
``The scariest thing that happened to me during a review 
one day was I had an engineering manager stand up to me and say, `let me tell 
you something: we have frozen a design and no one will change it!' I said, well 
. . .&quot;<br>
<br>
Stonecipher's message to that manager was ``you have no 
chance to get costs down unless you are really willing to change.&quot;<br>
<br>
``Trying to do the same thing better is the hardest way in the world to save 
money - you have to do it different.&quot;<br>
<br>
Recalling the ``old 
Boeing,&quot; Stonecipher shared a conversation he once had with former Boeing 
Chairman T. Wilson.<br>
<br>
``I told him Boeing is arrogant. He (Wilson) 
responded: `And rightly so!' &quot;<br>
<br>
``There's a great difference 
between pride and arrogance,&quot; Stonecipher told the business group. ``And 
we are working on it every day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stonecipher, who described 
himself as ``profitability driven,&quot; said that for years he has defended 
the widely viewed perception that he is only interested in making money.<br>

<br>``After a while I just said, you're right, I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
He said 
that while Boeing's name, reputation and market share matches such business 
giants as Coca-Cola and General Electric, the company's financial status 
doesn't stack up.<br>
<br>
``We have returns that can't even see the bottom of 
Coca-Cola - that is not acceptable,&quot; Stonecipher said.<br>
<br>
``The 
Boeing Co. is a great company with a tremendous future but it has a record of 
financial results that has ranged from a little better than average in recent 
years to absolutely dismal in 1997. That's something we can and we will 
fix.&quot;<br>
<br>
Boeing's lingering aircraft production problems have 
resulted in $2.6 billion in charges against earnings and contributed to a 1997 
loss of $178 million, the company's first annual loss in half a century.<br>

<br>``Quite frankly, I'm embarrassed that Boeing, which is the world's biggest 
and most respected aerospace company, and is loaded with extremely bright and 
talented people, that we have a market cap(italization - the total value of the 
company's stock) that's only about a quarter of that of Microsoft,&quot; he 
said, noting that the Redmond-based software maker is only a fraction of the 
size of Boeing and has only been a public company since 1986.<br>
<br>
He said 
he's ``further embarrassed&quot; that GE - a company closer to Boeing's size - 
``has a market capitalization that is five times that of The Boeing Co.&quot;
<br><br>
Stonecipher said the best companies today are not only growing but 
``exceeding the expectations of their customers and ratcheting up earnings at 
the same time. It can be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's the message he and Boeing 
Chairman Phil Condit are sending to the company's other high executives.<br>

<br>``We don't make excuses for where we are. We recognize where we are on a 
number of fronts and we intend to fix those.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stonecipher said 
the biggest threat to Boeing is the company itself.<br>
<br>
``We have lots of 
competitors, but Airbus is not our problem, Lockheed Martin is not our problem, 
Japan is not a threat, China is not a threat. . . . The biggest threat to The 
Boeing Co. is failure to execute inside. That's what we are working on.&quot;
<br><br>
Stonecipher, the same man who was described as the Gen. Dwight D. 
Eisenhower of McDonnell Douglas, says he is perfectly comfortable in his new 
role as Boeing's No. 2 officer. (Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas last year in 
a $16 billion stock deal.)<br>
<br>
``I can stop a lot of spears for Condit and 
I can also throw a lot for him.&quot; <br>

<p></p> 
<h1>Boeing posts loss, announces 10,000 job cuts </h1> 
<p>By DANIEL LOVERING</p> 
<p>AP Manufacturing Writer</p> 
<p>Boeing Co., the world's second-largest airplane maker, swung to a surprise 
fourth-quarter loss, hurt by a labor strike that disrupted deliveries. It also 
announced job cuts totaling 10,000 and forecast 2009 earnings that missed Wall 
Street expectations.</p> 
<p>The news comes on top of waning demand for the company's commercial jets. 
Airlines are cutting spending and air travel has declined amid the global 
economic slowdown. Boeing recently said it plans to cut about 4,500 positions 
from its commercial aircraft business as a result of the worsening market 
conditions.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday, Boeing executives said an additional 5,500 positions in other 
parts of the company, including its defense division, were to be eliminated 
through attrition and layoffs throughout the year.</p> 
<p>The Chicago-based company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $56 million, or 
8 cents per share, on Wednesday. That compared with profit of $1.03 billion, or 
$1.36 per share, a year earlier. Results were dragged down by charges totaling 
$1.79 per share, including the effects of a now-settled machinists strike and 
delayed deliveries of 747 jets.</p> 
<p><b>Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, expected earnings of 78 
cents in the fourth quarter. Those estimates typically exclude one-time items.
</b></p> 
<p><b>JSA Research analyst Paul Nisbet said the results were 
&quot;surprisingly poor,&quot; noting the unexpected charge for the new 747 
jumbo jet. &quot;I'll be interesting to hear the explanation for that.&quot;<br>
</b></p> 
<p><b>The FactSet-derived consensus forecast stood at a profit of 76 cents a 
share. Estimates typically exclude one-time charges, but analysts had factored 
the impact of the strike into their forecasts.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;We knew this was going to be a messy quarter given the impact of 
the strike...but it certainly missed [analysts' consensus ] number,&quot; said 
American Technology analyst Peter Arment.</b></p> 
<p>Fourth-quarter revenue fell 27 percent to $12.68 billion. Passenger and 
cargo jet deliveries fell by more than half as a strike by production workers 
paralyzed the company's Seattle-based commercial aircraft operations for 58 
days through early November. Analysts had expected revenue of $13.40 billion in 
the quarter.</p> 
<p>Looking ahead, Boeing expects per-share earnings of $5.05 to $5.35 for 
2009, short of the $5.68 forecast by analysts. Boeing's 2009 revenue outlook of 
$68 billion to $69 billion was in line with expectations.</p> 
<p>Shares of Boeing rose 99 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $44.21 in late morning 
trade.</p> 
<p>The company's 2009 financial forecast assumes stable deliveries over the 
next few years of commercial airplanes that are in production. Its commercial 
aircraft business expects to deliver between 480 and 485 airplanes this year.
</p> 
<p>Boeing delivered just 50 planes in the last three months of 2008, compared 
with 112 planes during the same period a year earlier.</p> 
<p>In November, Boeing further delayed the first test flight and delivery of 
its much-anticipated 787 jetliner, the world's first large commercial airplane 
made mostly from carbon-fiber composites, blaming the strike and lingering 
production problems.</p> 
<p>It also delayed deliveries of 747-8 cargo and passenger jets, partly due to 
the strike, and deliveries of 737s, 747s, 767s and 777s as it replaces 
defective fasteners used to attach wiring and other components inside the 
planes' fuselages.</p> 
<p>&quot;The progress we made in many areas of Boeing during 2008 was 
outweighed by the impact of the strike and our performance on some key 
development programs,&quot; Jim McNerney, Boeing's chairman, president and 
chief executive, said in a statement.</p> 
<p>To date, Boeing said 58 customers had placed 895 orders for 787s, excluding 
a recently canceled order from one customer for planes scheduled for delivery 
late in the next decade.</p> 
<p>Boeing, which ranks as the world's No. 2 airplane maker after France's 
Airbus SA, reported 2008 net income of $2.7 billion, or $3.71 per share, down 
34 percent from 2007.</p> Commercial jet orders declined by half in 2008, after 
three consecutive years of exceptionally strong growth. Still, the aerospace 
company has orders for a record 3,700 planes.<br>
<br>
28 Jan 2009 <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <b>Boeing hints at possible reassessment of 747-8</b></p> 
<p>  &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Boeing has hinted that it might have to rethink its slow-selling and 
delayed 747-8 programme, amid the continuing failure to land a second airline 
for the passenger model, combined with a slowdown in demand for cargo aircraft.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;The airframer took a $685 million charge last year stemming from cost 
overruns and schedule delays on the 747-8 programme.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;While Boeing executives have restated their support for the 
commercial viability of the aircraft, chief executive Jim McNerney warns that 
the continuation of the programme should not be seen as a foregone conclusion: 
&quot;We still see a viable business proposition here. Now obviously if we ever 
got to a point where we didn't, we'd have to work with our customers to come up 
with another answer.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Boeing has 106 orders for the 747-8F and a further 28 for the 747-8 
passenger model - 20 for Lufthansa and the remainder for VIP customers. But in 
November, deliveries of the first 747-8F were pushed back by at least six 
months to the third quarter of 2010, and of the 747-8 by at least four months 
to the second quarter of 2011.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Obviously, we have applied a judgement that says we have a very 
competitive airplane here that has already got a good start on orders,&quot; 
says McNerney. &quot;If we didn't believe the revenues would outweigh the costs 
we wouldn't go forward with it.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;ATI understands that Boeing has studied various options for the 
programme, including terminating the 747-8 and running the 747-8F as a 
stand-alone. This would require the renegotiation of Lufthansa's launch order 
and compensation. But with no active sales campaigns ongoing for the 747-8, 
other than a potential long-term deal to replace Air Force One, Lufthansa faces 
the serious prospect of being the only airline customer for the passenger 
version, and this in itself could have financial implications for Boeing such 
as residual value guarantees.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Despite its healthier order book, the 747-8F could also need re-examining. 
The cargo industry is in the middle of a slump because of the downturn, and 
industry sources say several 747-8F customers are seeking to delay 
deliveries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> What McNerney's &quot;other answer&quot; to the 747-8 could be 
is unclear. Cargo industry sources say that near-term capacity could be 
provided by readily-available 747-400 freighters combined with Boeing-supplied 
conversions of ex-passenger -400s.

Boeing denies Dreamliner delivery delay <br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>Boeing China issued a statement on International Finance News to deny the 
rumor that the Chicago-based company will delay its 787 planes delivery. The 
rumor swirled around the global market following Airbus' announcement of the 
delay of its A380 delivery. Boeing confirmed the punctual operation of the 787 
planes as scheduled.</p> 
<p>The statement says Boeing 787 is still under development and the 
contingencies so far in this period is in their expectation. It affirms that 
similar problem are unavoidable in the R&amp;D stage, as what has been shown by 
their experienced in other airplane project.</p> 
<p>The delay was first reported by Business Week. According to Business Week, 
the recent test on the nose of the plane found the overall weight of the 
aircraft is much heavier than expectation and there is flaw in the design of 
communication software. If these problems can not be solved timely and 
effectively, they will threaten the safety of the aircraft. So Boeing had to 
make technical improvement and carry out test again, which would result in the 
delay of 787 Dreamliners delivery originally scheduled in 2008.</p> 
<p>Mei Yuanmei, a manager of Boeing China said these problems are normal in 
the process of optimizing the production and the company has found out causes 
and effective solutions to solve them. </p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I guess it's true - the first six are basket cases......&nbsp; 
Hmmmmm,&nbsp; I wonder if we can get one for the Museum?</p> 
<p>787 flight test aircraft not allocated to customers</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Boeing has confirmed that the first six 787 test flight aircraft, once 
destined for customers ANA, Delta Airlines and Royal Air Maroc are no longer 
assigned to specific airlines.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&quot;As we made adjustments to the latest delivery schedule, our 
customers had the opportunity to take production airplanes that better suited 
their business needs for a variety of reasons, including schedule,&quot; said 
Boeing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;But the airframer remains confident of placing the six refurbished 
flight test aircraft with customers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Morocco's Royal Air Maroc has also moved into the early production 
stream assuming ownership of two delivery spots previously held by Air China 
and China Eastern, with JAL taking an additional Dreamliner from another spot 
held by China Eastern.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;In addition, this new information appears to confirm that Delta Air 
Lines, which excluded 18 787s from an order table listed in a recent US 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, does not intend to be an early 787 
customer, even though the airline confirms that it retains firm orders for the 
type.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;According to the schedule of the first 30 aircraft, Qantas and Air 
India have assumed control of spots previously held by Delta. The Australian 
airline, which will use the aircraft in its low-cost Jetstar subsidiary, 
previously expected to receive three 787s over three months, will now take 
delivery of its first five 787s over four months.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Boeing expects to fly the first 787 by the end of the 2nd quarter of 
2009.<br>

&lsquo;Humbled&rsquo; Boeing Prepares to Fly 787</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
 
Demonstrating a degree of public humility many feel has been all too absent 
among the bankers collectively responsible for the global financial crisis, 
Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Scott Carson offered no further excuses for the 
delays that have plagued the 787 and 747-8 this month during the J.P. Morgan 
Aviation and Transportation Conference in New York. &ldquo;The stumbles we have 
made have been embarrassing for us,&rdquo; Carson said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve 
been embarrassing for our customers, who were counting on us to have the right 
product in place at the right time.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 To avoid further 
embarrassment &ldquo;will require us to be humble,&rdquo; continued Carson.<b> 
&ldquo;This will require us to not be taken at our word, but to be [judged] by 
our actions.&rdquo;</b><br>
<br>
 Boeing continues to target the second quarter 
for first flight of the 787, on which the company has now cleared all the 
equipment for first flight, he said. Now fully assembled, according to the CEO, 
the first flying prototype next leaves the factory for washing and repainting, 
then returns to the factory for a series of gauntlet tests with ground power on 
all the airplane&rsquo;s systems. Finally, engineers will run all the systems 
under ship&rsquo;s power to, in Carson&rsquo;s words, make sure they play 
together and run reliably for first flight.<br>
<br>
 Meanwhile, said Carson, 
Boeing continues to make &ldquo;solid progress&rdquo; toward a third-quarter 
2010 first delivery of the 747-8, the first wing for which was ready to come 
out of its jig and be placed into the so-called lay-down position in 
preparation for attachment to the fuselage. <br>

<p></p> <b>Bernstein Research sees further 787 delays, bigger range shortfall
</b> <br>
<br>
 Boeing's 787 customers face delivery delays of up to an 
additional six<br>
 months, according to a report issued Friday by New 
York-based<br>
 Bernstein Research that also suggest a 10%-15% range shortfall 
for<br>
 early delivery aircraft.<br>
<br>
 The May 1 client report, a wrapup 
after Boeing's 787 certification<br>
 briefing on April 29, is Bernstein's 
sixth reassessment of 787<br>
 production and forecasts that the manufacturer 
will not reach its<br>
 target production rate of 10 aircraft per month until 
mid-2013, six<br>
 months later than the latest target.<br>
<br>
 Bernstein 
warned that it is &quot;not comfortable with assuming that<br>
 [Boeing] will 
achieve its goal of making first delivery in Q1 2010 to<br>
 All Nippon 
Airways, and even less comfortable assuming a production<br>
 rate of 10 per 
month by the end of 2012,&quot; and has thus &quot;stretched the<br>
 time from 
first flight to the target production rate by an additional<br>
 six months, 
with production rates reaching six per month at the end of<br>
 2012 and 
reaching 10 per month in mid-2013.&quot; At its April 29 briefing,<br>
 Boeing 
reiterated its plan to fly the 787 by June 30.<br>
<br>
 The report also 
expressed concern about the effect on production rates<br>
 of the redesign 
required to address weight issues. Bernstein said it<br>
 understands from 
customer and supplier discussions that the first<br>
 production 787s are 
likely to be roughly 8% overweight, with range<br>
 10%-15% less than promised. 
&quot;That will translate into a range near<br>
 6,900 nm., well below the 
promised 7,700-8,200 nm. range,&quot; it claimed.<br>
<br>
<br>
 &quot;These 
values are worse than for most development programs and suggest<br>
 that 
substantial redesign work will be necessary. . .but the Tier 1<br>
 suppliers 
have not yet validated their production capacities with the<br>
 new production 
technology, and if substantial redesign is needed to<br>
 reduce weight, it 
will further complicate a rapid increase in delivery<br>
 rates,&quot; the 
report added.<br>
<br>
 In more bad news Bernstein cast doubt on the ambitious 
certification<br>
 timeline for the 787, which it termed 
&quot;challenging.&quot; It warned that<br>
 the program involves substantial 
changes in materials, systems and<br>
 manufacturing technology, creating many 
opportunities for surprises to<br>
 emerge during the test program. &quot;There 
will also be the challenge of<br>
 getting all six aircraft ready for testing 
as planned,&quot; it said. <br>

Boeing Suffers Rating Cut &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <br>
<br>
 Boeing Ratings 
Outlook Cut by Fitch<br>
<br>
 Fitch Ratings lowered to negative its long-term 
credit ratings outlook<br>
 on The Boeing Company (BA) and its financial unit, 
Boeing Capital Corp.<br>
<br>
 Fitch said the long-term issuer default rating 
of A+ on Boeing and<br>
 Boeing Capital Corp., along with other ratings, were 
supported by<br>
 financial flexibility, large order backlog, and the company's 
balanced<br>
 portfolio approximately equally split between defense and 
commercial.<br>
<br>
 However, the rating agency cited several risks and 
uncertainties<br>
 prompting the lowered ratings:<br>
<br>
 1) Concerns about 
the recession's impact on the commercial aerospace<br>
 industry. Defense 
companies have been adversely impacted during the<br>
 recession by exposure to 
commercial aviation as consumers travel less<br>
 and airlines cut capacity.<br>
<br> 2) Downward pressure on U.S. Defense Department budgets.<br>
<br>
 3) 
Concerns about the health of the aircraft financing market, given<br>
 very 
tight credit markets, and Boeing's significant inventory stockpile<br>
 last 
year.<br>
<br>
 4) Fitch said its revised ratings reflect expectations of 
production<br>
 cuts later in 2009 and into 2010. The rating agency cited the 
potential<br>
 for further delays in Boeing's 787 Dreamliner program.<br>
<br>
 
Boeing has already delayed the 787 aircraft's launch by about two years;<br>
 
however, last week the company announced that it still plans the first<br>
 
test flight during the current 2nd quarter of 2009.<br>
<br>
 Fitch said it 
will review Boeing's ratings if there are additional<br>
 delays to the 787 
program. The rating agency believes keeping the plane<br>
 on schedule will 
help reduce inventories and likely decrease research<br>
 and development 
expenses.

<p> <b>A Little Reference - What sports teams do for 
&quot;Non-Performance&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Seattle Mariners firing of Manager John McLaren - It all 
sounds............ so familiar.</b></p> 
<h1>McLaren joins Bavasi on the Mariners' firing line</h1> 
<p>By DAVID ANDRIESEN<br>
 P-I REPORTER</p>  The players will apparently get 
one more chance.
<p>John McLaren will not.</p> 
<p>Three days after firing general manager Bill Bavasi, the Mariners on 
Thursday followed by giving McLaren the ax hours before the team left for a 
three-city interleague road trip.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;On a personal level, this was a very difficult decision to 
make,&quot; Pelekoudas said. &quot;John McLaren and I, and many of us in the 
organization, go back a long way. But from a strictly professional level, I 
felt this was the right thing to do for the ballclub and for the further 
advancement of the organization and for our efforts to try to get better this 
year.&quot;</p> 
<p>Pelekoudas emphasized that winning as many of this season's remaining 90 
games as possible is a high priority, though Armstrong acknowledged the odds of 
getting back into playoff contention were &quot;practically zilch.&quot;</p> 
<p>Unlike McLaren's replacement of Hargrove, when the Mariners gave McLaren 
the manager title with no strings attached, they consistently referred to 
Riggleman as being manager for the remainder of the season.</p> 
<p>That's in part because the person who will decide on next season's manager 
might not have been hired yet. Armstrong said the new general manager will be 
free to choose &quot;his or her&quot; (perhaps tipping his hand that Dodgers 
assistant GM Kim Ng is on the short list) field manager. Pelekoudas has an 
&quot;interim&quot; title, though he'll be a candidate for the job.</p> 
<p>Lee Elia, named hitting coach when Pentland was fired June 9, will now 
assume the title of bench coach. Pelekoudas said Elia would still retain a 
supervisory role over the hitting program, much as he did when he was on 
Piniella's coaching staff. Jose Castro, the Mariners' minor league hitting 
coordinator, will join the major league staff as hitting coach and report to 
Elia.</p> 
<p>McLaren was Piniella's right-hand man in Cincinnati, Seattle and Tampa Bay 
before going his own way to resume the job of Mariners bench coach under 
Hargrove in 2007. McLaren coached 11 seasons in Seattle, more than any coach in 
franchise history.</p> 
<p>McLaren always wanted to be a manager, interviewing for jobs throughout his 
coaching career, but got his chance under unusual circumstances when Hargrove 
simply walked away midway through a winning season. McLaren led the Mariners to 
a 43-41 record to end the 2007 season and was brought back without hesitation 
for 2008.</p> 
<p>The Mariners made bold moves in the offseason and fancied themselves 
contenders this spring. McLaren bragged about the team's &quot;five No. 1&quot; 
starters, guaranteed Richie Sexson would be named comeback player of the year 
and said unequivocally that anything short of a playoff berth would be a failed 
season.</p> 
<p>But the Mariners have been a disaster from the start and are on pace to go 
56-106 -- which would be the worst season for a franchise that has had plenty 
of lousy seasons. Nearly to a man, the players are well below their career 
averages.</p> 
<p>For most of the season, McLaren stoically stood by his underachieving 
players, though the strain of seeing his long-awaited chance at managing slip 
away began to show as time went on.</p> 
<p>On June 4, Bavasi locked the players out of their postgame spread and made 
them sit at their lockers, while McLaren stood before reporters and delivered a 
contrived, expletive-filled rant.</p> 
<p>It was the action of a man who knows he's running out of time, and McLaren 
probably did know. When a talented team underperforms that badly, firing the 
manager is Baseball 101.</p> 
<p>&quot;There wasn't one game, there wasn't one homestand, there wasn't one 
series that really led to this decision,&quot; Pelekoudas said. &quot;I think 
it was a culmination of really just watching the team's play for a period of 
time.</p> 
<p>&quot;We hadn't shown any improvement for the past couple of months. In 
fact, we were probably regressing. John worked extremely hard to make this club 
better. I don't think anybody worked harder than him.&quot;</p> 
<p>Does the fact that three people have been fired in recent weeks, while no 
player has lost his job, send a mixed message about accountability to the 
players?</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't think it does, because they know the other shoe could drop at 
any time,&quot; Pelekoudas said. &quot;I'm not saying it's going to drop 
tomorrow or going to drop at all. But I think they always know that that shoe 
is always there. They should know it's always there.&quot;</p> 
<p>Thursday, the shoe dropped on John McLaren.</p>

<b>Air NZ Says Boeing To Further Delay Delivery Of 787s </b> <br>

<p> WELLINGTON (Dow Jones)--Air New Zealand Ltd. (AIR.NZ) said Wednesday that 
aircraft maker Boeing Co. (BA) has confirmed further delays in the delivery of 
its first 787-9 aircraft.</p>
<p> The national carrier, which is 76% owned by the New Zealand government, 
said it is continuing to discuss compensation over the delays with Boeing.</p>
<p> &quot;Boeing confirmed yesterday a further 12-month delay could be 
expected with the first 787-9 aircraft to be delivered to Air New Zealand in 
the first quarter of 2013,&quot; the carrier said in a statement. The first 
delivery was originally scheduled for the end of 2010.</p>
<p> The fresh delay snags Air New Zealand's strategic drive to spruce up its 
fleet and long-haul operations, although the airline has said recently that 
there won't be any major disruptions to its network.</p>
