<p> AAT Global President <br>
 Dear Mr. Lazaruk, <br>
 Just a short note to 
let you know I really I appreciate all of your help and assistance with my 
A-330 transition type I received through AAT Global. I was treated very well 
and in a professional manner and enjoyed my training. I would also like to 
express my sincere gratitude to Instructor Capt. Gary Scott who is an excellent 
instructor who I would highly recommend to future candidates. A special note 
for Examiner Capt. St. Pierre, who brings a world of knowledge and experience 
on the Airbus A-330 and A-340 series for which I was very impressed. I thought 
he gave me a very straight forward yet challenging check ride and knows his 
stuff..!!</p> 
<p> Once again, I wanted to show my appreciation and would highly recommend 
AAT Global to my colleagues in the future for training on the Airbus.</p> 
<p> Sincerely, <br>
 Herbert Law Captain/Check Airman A-320 A-330 type </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  Attention: Walt Lazaruk<br>

 Re: B767 Type Rating </p> 
<p> Walt I just wanted to give you some feedback on the type rating I took 
through AAT Global. Overall I am happy I completed the type rating 
successfully. Coming from a turbo prop back ground and not having any jet time, 
it was a challenge. However with the help of you and your instructors I was 
able to complete it and was commended by Mike Dressler on a good job.</p> 
<p> Specifically Scott and Tim were an immense help. Both were willing to go 
the extra mile to answer any questions we had and offered their personal phone 
numbers in case we had questions. I think that we started off on a bad note 
with Kaz. I am sure Katz is a great guy. I have heard many good things about 
him from pilots here at Viva. I just think we got off on the wrong foot. I do 
thank you for the way you handled our concern. Anyway Thanks again for all your 
help I really appreciate it. It was a start to what I hope is a long career 
here at Viva. It's a great company with great management and I am really 
excited.</p> 
<p> Yours in flying, <br>
 Wes Gardner Edmonton, Alberta </p>

<p> Dear Walt,<br>
<br>
 My experience with AAT Global was throughout very 
positive.<br>
 AAT Global allowed me to obtain a Type Rating for the Airbus 320 
within the precalculated budget and infact less time than foreseen. I found the 
course well organized. The Instructors and simulator availabilities were to my 
full satisfaction.<br>
<br>
 The computer based ground school enabled me to 
pass the final written exam without too many problems. The on-line ground 
school and manuals were also very informative.<br>
 The Instructors Mr. Steve 
St. Pierre and Mr. Mike Maryowski were extremely knowledgable and patient and 
had the<br>
 ability to pass the knowledge on to me in a very professional and 
friendly manner. The Examiner Mr. Steve Cunningham also proved himself to be 
very professional and friendly. The whole work environment at AAT Global and 
with Mr. Walt Lazaruk was very professional and pleasant.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The 
course met with my expectations.<br>

<p>  AAT Global 767 Course Critique<br>
<br>
 Naturally, with any course or 
training programs their will be a mix of positive and negative opinions 
depending upon the candidate's background and experience. Therefore, I would 
like to highlight the type of training that I have received in the past as this 
is the only basis of comparison for me.<br>
 During my professional career to 
date I have only worked for 3 companies, Kenn Borek Air, Cargojet (for 3 months 
- ground school only no flight training) and Air Canada Jazz.<br>
 These 
companies have very thorough ground school and flight training programs and are 
the basis for my comparison. Cargojet and Air Canada Jazz provide approximately 
3 weeks of classroom, Instructor led ground school covering systems, SOP's and 
company ops for the B727 and Dash 8 respectively. Kenn Borek Air provides the 
same style of training, however, due to being 704 ops and a far simpler 
airplane ' DHC-6, the ground training can be completed in as little as 5 days.
<br> <br>
 Before I detail my thoughts; the summary: Starting the course I was 
optimistic and impressed by the setup, however, as the course progressed, I 
became disappointed and more concerned that there was a lack of training. 
Towards the later half of the course (the flight sim) I became happier as we 
came closer to attaining our goal.<br>
<br>
 Prior to starting the course, I 
was able to download a copy of the Boeing 767 CBT from the Internet and 
thoroughly worked through it before starting the Active course. I had also 
bought a copy of Level-D 767 for Flight Simulator 2004 and familiarized myself 
with it.<br>
 My expectations for the course were partly based upon the Active 
website but, primarily my own experience with prior training.<br>
<br>
 After 
providing the $3000 deposit, I was able to pick up the course material and it 
was very much what I was expecting with regards to the copies of the Boeing 
manuals, however, the photocopied cockpit wall posters were difficult to read 
and I was thinking that they might be temporary until I had made full payment, 
they were not. In the end I bought a set of cockpit posters from Aviation World 
for around $50. After spending $18,000, a set of colour, original cockpit 
posters might be a nice idea.<br>
 Course Material ' 7 out of 10<br>
<br>
 
Previously, when using CBT software, I had found that the CBT was for use at 
home prior to commencement of the course and daily review and then used as the 
basis for a structured taught ground school. Whereas, I was surprised to find 
no instructor lead technical ground school at Active, however, CBT's are 
supposed to negate the need for Instructor lead classrooms, and in no way 
affects my opinion of the course'just an observation.<br>
 On the whole, and 
bearing in mind that not everyone will have the ability to have their own CBT 
at home, Active's CBT was excellent and was offered in a learning conducive 
environment.<br>
 Technical Ground school /CBT ' 10 out of 10<br>
<br>
 Having 
the Level-D Sim for Flight Simulator available to students is a great idea. I 
already had a copy at home, as did Wes, and we used this a great deal for 
practicing cockpit flows and flight procedures.<br>
 Having never flown 
anything larger than a Dash 8, nor, having any Jet experience, 3 sessions with 
an Instructor for the ground school was quite weak for us. Prior to the course 
we were told that we would be using Viva SOP's, we were also given a set of 
school SOP's and there are also the Boeing SOP's in the manuals. This created 
some confusion for us and was not resolved until the end of the fixed base sim. 
The confusion and the one weak instructor left us a little dissatisfied; 
however, this has been discussed in length and was ultimately resolved to our 
satisfaction. In retrospect, If Scott is running the 767 side of the course 
then, day 1, it would be useful to have a sit down with the students to explain 
how the course will run. It is a great idea to be able to tailor make your 
course to work for any operator, however, everyone needs to be on the same 
page, Instructors and students. If we had simply used the school SOP's and had 
a stronger third instructor then 3 sessions may well have been enough'.. I also 
appreciate the fact that a this was the first time&nbsp; that Active had 
attempted to use another companies SOP's.<br>
 SOP's / Type Rating Ground&nbsp; 
school ' 6 out of 10<br>
<br>
 Once we were in the level C or D Simulator, our 
knowledge and abilities came together with the assistance of some excellent 
Instructor led sessions by both Tim and Scott. I cannot say enough positive 
things about their knowledge, training styles and demeanour making for a very 
conducive learning environment. The examiners claimed to be impressed with our 
final rides and assumed that we had experience far beyond that of our resumes. 
This in itself is testament to the level of flight training provided. Excellent.
<br> Flight Training ' Full Sim ' 10 out of 10<br>
<br>
 Overall the course 
offers, strong Instructors in Tim and Scott, great facilities, and an 
accommodating Director/owner. On the negative side, cheap looking cockpit 
posters and a weak type rating ground school with confusion which may very well 
be resolved on future courses, especially, as we were the first to attempt a 
course using non-school SOP's<br>
<br>
 The course is not spoon fed and may not 
be suitable for students with limited experience or are unable to work 
self-paced.<br>
<br>
 Missing from the course was Weight and Balance 
instruction.<br>
<br>
 I would not hesitate in recommending other students to 
attend type-rating training with AAT Global and would consider them a first 
choice for training in the future if required.<br>
<br>
 Thanks Walt, I now 
have the 767/757 on my licence. That was I what wanted, that was what was 
offered, and that is what I got.<br>

<p> Hi Walt, <br>
 I just wanted to say that my type rating course at AAT 
Global was a great experience. The instructors and check airmen are very 
helpful and interested in teaching you the proper techniques for flying the 
aircraft in different situations. The instructors and check airmen are all 
current Air Canada captains, or retired from Air Canada, so they have a wealth 
of knowledge and experience for you to draw on. Walt has been very helpful to 
me in the upkeep of my license. With a Canadian license, you have to renew your 
type rating every 2 years, and Walt has been very helpful in setting up an 
instrument renewal for me. I am very happy with my experience at AAT Global. I 
feel that I've learned a lot of great techniques for operating a B757/767 from 
the great instructors and check airmen provided for me, and I would highly 
recommend that you get your type rating from AAT Global. </p>

<p>  Well first the President of AAT Global played a huge part of the training 
conducted.I personally felt at home with the instructor I have known for a 
short time</p> 
<p>  &nbsp; Mr. Walt here at AAT Global made the course very 
understandable&nbsp; and gave us a wealth of information which he achieved from 
his past Airline experience.</p> 
<p>  Sometimes he was hard, but now I understand why. It was for my own good 
which really made me more self confident when I go on the line.</p> 
<p>  &nbsp;Overall the course was intensive, professional, I personally would 
think I learned from a professional environment.</p>

taken care of and received all what I&nbsp; need and more. In flying the 
B737-200 Plus after what I received, I felt more confident flying this plane, 
for I really saw and passed through all tlypes of situations that might occur 
with us on our line operation.

<p> <b>Dear Walt,</b><br>
<br>
 I would like to thank AAT Global for the A320

for all the support and the help you've given me. I would also like to thank my 
instructor Len who handled me with nothing but professionalism. For me this 
experienced will always act as a foundation towards building my career.<br>

<p><b>RE: TYPE RATING ON A DUTCH LICENSE</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;Dear Walt Lazaruk, <br>
 This is the message I received from the 
Dutch authorities and I can confirm to you that what you wrote is correct.<br>
 
&nbsp;I can add a foreign (Canadian) type rating on my JAR FCL with a 
restriction which be lifted after 500hours on the same type. After this 
500hours I will have to do a proficiency check in a JAR FCL simulator and then 
I will get the ATPL license.<br>
 The following documents needed from the type 
rating course:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp; 1.Course completion certificate of the 
TRTO.<br>
 &nbsp; 2.The exam forms. </p>

without him.<br>
As for Walt, a very nice person, good professionalism. Keep up

<p><i>The following email, is an answer to a request, from a prospective 
student, asking for information on the program. He requested the answers come 
from a graduate that recently completed the A320 course</i></p> 
<p><i> (1) What type rating did you complete and what was your prior flying 
experience?</i></p> 
<p>A320 ' ATPL - 7500 hours total with light business jet and medium transport 
turboprop.</p> 
<p><i>(2) How did you find the home study? Hard/Easy? How much time would you 
recommend spending on home study before heading to Canada?</i></p> 
<p>Home study is a great head start but not absolutely essential. It's easy. 
You can finish the home study in the matter of a week, but don't base your 
course commencement on that. Of course the more knowledge and familiarity you 
have with the airplane the more you will benefit from the course and 
instructor. (I will explain what I mean from 'instructor' more in details in 
your question about the instructor)</p> 
<p><i>(3) Did you complete the training at the advertised price that Walt 
quoted you? Where there any hidden extra's? How long did you spend in Canada?
</i></p> 
<p>The price was exactly to the cent that was quoted. I personally didn't 
spend anything more than the quoted $15,800. I truly believe when it comes to 
Walt nothing is hidden, the first day he sat down with all three of us and read 
and explained in real English the whole contract, clarified and answered any of 
our questions along the way. He is a loyal and honest person. You may find some 
negative comments about him and his organization on prune but I suggest you 
don't allow these rubbish cloud your vision and affect your judgment about him 
until you experience him yourself first hand like I did.<br>
<br>
Remember that 
there are extra costs if you 'DO' need extra help in the sim or briefing, ..etc 
but they are not hidden and this issue is well explained in that first day talk 
and review of the contract with Walt.<br>
<br>
The course can be done from in 
few weeks to few months, is all depend on your progress. If you walk they will 
have to slow down and walk with you but if you run they will run with you. 
Having said that, the course has its levels and steps that has to be down in 
sequence and each step is prerequisite to the next level, you have to 
understand that CBT, SIM cost lots of money and neither you nor they can afford 
to push you into the next level of the course while knowing that you are not 
ready. I started the course on the 3rd of May and told Walt that I would like 
to finish the course by the end of the month, well how can I say this..? Let's 
say the ink on my license with the new type rating was drying up on the 25th of 
May. Exactly 6 days earlier then promised. </p> 
<p><i>(4) How did you find the staff? Instructors?</i></p> 
<p>There are several instructors training but Walt runs the whole thing, which 
is nice. He has everything very organized and is always around when you need 
something or question.<br>
<br>
<b>Instructor:</b> We had Len for our course, 
he is a 767 Captain with Air Canada with almost every Boeing product in his 
logbook, and he also flew A320 as a Captain with Air Canada for few years. His 
level of knowledge and experience is not even an issue to be questioned. He is 
calm, thorough, clear, friendly and patient. To my opinion he gives a true 
meaning to the word professionalism m. He thought us how to walk before 
running, he started his lesson plan with the number rule of teaching, known to 
unknown, familiar to unfamiliar, easy to difficult.<br>
<br>
More from your Q2; 
Len (instructor) started teaching us way beyond the standard of the course and 
as our performance allowed we covered multiple emergencies, wired scenarios, 
challenging weather environments. We were so used to having lots of emergencies 
on our hand that on the actual flight test we were all yawning from boredom 
even with one engine failed and fire on go around. My point is, the more you 
get yourself ready for the course and the more input is from you the more 
result you will get from the instructor and the course in general. </p> 
<p><i>(5) Quality of simulator?</i></p> 
<p>Not even an issue, great CBT, and level C or D approved by Transport 
Canada. He uses the Air Canada's simulators. A320, 330,340,757,767,737-200 is 
available in Vancouver. We only cancelled one session and that was due to heavy 
thunderstorm activities outside that introduced power surges to the system.</p> 
<p>(<i>6) Free Play Trainer... Walt tries to sell this pretty hard, is it that 
helpful? Is it simply just a desktop simulator like Microsoft for example?</i>
</p> 
<p>Free play trainer is a great learning tool. It is a desktop simulator but 
is no way near a game like Microsoft simulator. You need to be master in 
programming the MCDU and doing it fast as you will do that every single time 
you get reset back at the threshold of the runway for another take off in the 
sim. Which again comes back down to the money, as every min of your sim time is 
valuable and trust me you don't want to spend more than a min of your time 
figuring out how to reprogram the MCDU. I don't know what type you are 
considering to get but A320 is a fully managed airplane that you need to fly 
via the computers. And the cheapest way to learn it is using the Free Play 
Trainer. It's well programmed software and allows you to program a whole flight 
and then fly it. I don't think Walt tries or needs to sell this as it sells 
itself once you use it.</p> 
<p><i>(7) Any other information that you feel beneficial, please pass on.</i>
</p> 
<p>Having a laptop with you would help as you can review the systems back in 
the comfort of your hotel room.<br>
<br>
If there are three guys in your course 
you will get more time in the sim. This is not cheating the system. Walt is the 
first one to offer this to you.<br>
<br>
I really enjoyed dealing with Walt. He 
is an extremely honest and professional person who delivered on all of his 
promises and more. There are lots of negative rumours out there and that's all 
they are'.rumours. If you are looking for the most efficient and cost effective 
program then this is for you, but then again you can go to other organizations 
and pay two or three times more for the same program which may end up being 
less in the end. The contract is written is favour of both parties.<br>
<br>
My 
only advice to people out there is; don't let someone's opinion be your reality.
<br><br>
Good Luck<br>
and give my warmest regards to Walt and Len<br>

<i>'A320 course comments, from our graduate student- Harald Summer, 
from Austria'</i><br>
<br>
About my critique: I did a lot of research about AAT 
Global on the internet and especially on prune<br>
Quite a number of people on 
prune did not talk very positive about AAT Global.<br>
Nevertheless I decided 
to start a course with you and as I said I have no regrets that I did so.<br>

The only critiques I still have are the manuals. I should have wrote that maybe 
in a different way on the piece of paper you gave us but maybe also my English 
writing is a bit no sensitive. Of course this is only a small aspect of the 
entire type rating but you must understand it was also the first impression I 
had.<br>
I was very pleased about your quick response about all my questions I 
had before starting the course. The internet-course was very helpful and I was 
surprised how quick I got your package.<br>
Summing up my experience with your 
course I must say that the negative rumours are wrong.<br>

of hard work, training, study, exams, flight tests, medical exams, and license 
conversions, I did it. I got my dream job. Actually much more than I ever 
thought of. From flying a piper Seminole to an A320. That is just one of the 
best and one of the most exciting things that ever happened to me in my life. I 
really worked hard for it and I earned it truly. I did very well in my 
interview today and I will be flying as an F/O starting April 1st with this 
company based out of (HECA) Cairo International. My first 3 flights will be 
from the jump seat as an observer and it will be to (HESH) which is a resort 
called Sharm El Sheik in Egypt. After that I will move right into the right 
seat with a supervising captain in the jump seat. They will place me only on 
the domestic flights and then as I progress they'll let me fly some 
international routes. They or let me say WE fly to Moscow, Paris, Madrid, 
Rome,etc.. Cool STUFF. I have one week to study their SOP's and Aircraft Specs. 
I have tons to do but hey no complains, after 4 years of hard work this is 
nothing.<br>
<br>
<b>I am so happy Walt and I want to thank you so very much 
for all your help and support that you showed me and the rest of us during our 
course at AAT Global. I also want you to thank Len and tell him the good news. 
You are the first to know by the way. I'm gonna send an e-mail to Fabien, 
Claude, and Sameer and let them know as well. I will keep you posted as to my 
progress. Wish me luck.</b><br>

 MY A320 TRAINING March 13th, 2005</b><br>
<br>
In order to get a 
A320 type rating, I had the required training with AAT Global. I had a very 
good flight instructor and excellent flight training. The only thing I didn't 
enjoy was the late simulator sessions.<br>

The simulator was very 
good and enjoyed all of the training. I would have liked to have more time to 
prepare for the ground school and the simulator. It would be nice to do the 
training in the simulator during the day.<br>

 A SUCCESS STORY FROM AMIR OF EGYPT</b><br>
<br>
Dear 
Walt,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>How are you and how is everything. I passed my Sim ride in Cairo at Egypt 
Air 2 days ago and received my license today with the endorsement. I got 2 hrs 
as PF. It went well. I scored 85%. Now I have 2 licenses with a valid EA32 type 
rating on both. I will start applying here and see what comes out of that. 
Hopefully I might be able to find something. I am optimistic. I am in contact 
with both Fabien and Claude and we are all optimistic. By the way the examiner 
was very pleased and he told me that your level of training is maybe a guy who 
has at least 300 hrs on the actual aircraft. He was really impressed. I was 
first confused because I was flying as a PF from the right seat and not the 
left as we used to do in Vancouver. Besides I had to study their SOP's which is 
a lot different than the ones we had even though they all lead to the same 
result. With the emergency procedures the sequence they have here is a lot 
different , so I had to do it their way. Believe it or not I had to do some 
stuff in the PPC ride which I never did in Vancouver.<br>
Here are some just 
for you to know and tell Len about so he can introduce to the future students. 
I did a normal T/O without autopilot involvement just to see how I handle the 
aircraft then a circuit and an ILS approach and landing hand flying it all the 
way. Then a normal T/O with an engine out at V1 just like we did then continue 
with a circuit and an approach then a go around with the failed engine after 
the ILS approach at minima. That was very interesting because as soon as you 
advance to TOGA the yaw is incredible and you have to apply full rudder bearing 
in mind that you are off the autopilot which had disconnected at minima. That 
was neat. Now I am at 35000 feet and I made an emergency descent once without 
structural damage like we were trained so I descended at 340 kits and then the 
second was with structural damage and that was new to me. I knew that I should 
use selected speed but then to increase the rate of descent lowering the gear 
below FL250 and below 250 kts then selecting speed to 270 and then at 10000 
retracting the gear but first selecting speed 220. Then 2 ELACs failing so 
you're in alternate law, then I was asked to do a 45 degree bank without FD's 
or Auto thrust. That was new too. Then gear down so now you're in direct law 
and he asks you to order your PNF to select gear and flaps plus to make things 
easy for you a 25 degree angle of bank ( Dirty Config ) and stall the damn 
thing. Now that was really tough. Not to stall it but the recovery in direct 
law. What else. Oh then he asked me to do an ILS approach with Nav accuracy low 
so I had to use raw data and Rose ILS and not Arc plus he gave me a 90 degree 
cross wind at 15 kts and I had to land the damn thing. That I did very very 
very well even though i never did it before. However, I used my good airman 
ship and made a nice smooth landing and he was very impressed. Now to make my 
day, on the roll out, he gave me an engine fire on the ground which was 
straight forward and that was followed by evacuation. And that was the end of 
it. Of course I did a lot of other stuff like engine vibration above 4.3 for N2 
and EGPWS and TCAS , and a lot of other stuff which was a piece of cake. So 
that was it and I hope you tell Len about the check ride so he can add those 
exercises for future students. In my opinion mainly , the alternate law direct 
law , stall , recovery , 45 degree bank and structural damage with emergency 
decent where you extend the landing gear were the toughest exercises. Oh 
another thing he gave me was dual Hyd G and B sys failure which is an emergency 
situation although it was mostly stuff done by my PNF except for the landing 
gear manual extension and slat and flap jamming which I order him to do 
depending on the ECAM call that he gave me. Anyway, I learned a lot and it was 
fun and I did very well Thanks again Walt for all your effort and help and send 
my regards to Len and wish me luck.<br>
<br>
I'll stay in touch and keep you 
posted and updated. Until then all the best.<br>

short and the simulator hours are not what an upgrade with an Airline gives

&nbsp;I would like to thank our instructors Scott and 
Peter as they were very helpful and very dedicated to our goal in achieving our 
type rating.&nbsp; Although one might think you could just sit back and coast 
to get a pass, you are wrong. It took a lot of effort (5 hours of computer

days in the cold Flight Training Device for procedure training to get ourselves 
ready for the simulator. Basically you will get out of the course what you put 
into it.<br>

 Hi Walt,<br>
</b>Just a quick note to express thanks for going the 
extra mile with us. Both Tariq and I would liked to have done better in Calgary 
than Vancouver, but it just didn't work that way. However, you can be pretty 
sure that both of us will build upon what you taught us, and work really hard 
to be a good average or better ... should we ever get to flying the real 
airplane!&nbsp; I congratulate you for getting me thru an extremely difficult 
course very quickly and efficiently!&nbsp; I can't think of any one else who 
could have done as well as you ... my sincere&nbsp; thanks for all your efforts!

 Hi Walt,</b><br>
<br>
I hope all is well. Looking back at the last 
5 years, I am very grateful to you for actually getting the ball rolling in my 
aviation career. I left the Suncor oil plant in Alberta to come to you for 737 
training, wrote the IATRA, did the instrument rating, wrote the 2 ATPL exams, 
came up to Cambridge Bay, got PPCs on the twin-otter, both the king air 100 and 
200, just went to Tucson, Arizona to Flight Safety and did the learjet 
training, and now already have 52 hours on the lear. Your 737 course really 
helped me with my lear training as well. Walt, I really want to apologize for 
my unprofessional behavior and sarcasm after the 737 training and as mentioned 
before thank you very much for paving the way in my new career. I still have 
all your 737 books and cockpit diagrams and am reading through them as my heart 
is really set on getting the 737 rating and hopefully being able to fly one 
soon. Do you still do the 737 training? I know the sim is still there as a 
Captain for First Air (Ian Blewett) just did his recurrent on that sim 2 weeks 
ago. That's all for today, have a good one, Peter.<br>

Dear Mr. Lazurk,<br>
</b><br>
I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank you for the all the help and support put 
forth by you in making me successful for the type rating for the Boeing 737. I 
have to start from the accommodation as the hotel was very nice and clean and 
the price was wonderful. After going back I would definitely miss the long 
morning walk in the Minuro Park. The Computer based ground school was very 
informative tool to learning and the best part about it was that it helps you 
learn at you own pace. The embedded questions help ones learning more enjoyable 
without losing interest. The test after the session was an innovative idea to 
test your threshold knowledge about the systems. The 737 plane in the BCIT 
hanger is big advantage as it helps with your cockpit flows and also gives you 
familiarization with the plane.<br>
The simulator was good experience with 
detail initial briefing and de-briefings. The day wise course plan helps you 
with the planning process a day ahead. You have been helpful improving comfort 
ability with the plane itself and thereby building my confidence.<br>
Once 
again I thank you for your help. Best regards<br>
Sincerely,<b><br>

 Dear Mr. Lazurk,</b></p> 
<p><br>
My experience on taking the Type rating Boeing 767/757 type rating 
course at AAT Global.<br>
I just completed the course and I found the Boeing 
767/757 course to be a very good course but I don't think that you just will 
pass because you have paid for a type rating. There is a lot of home study to 
do by yourself. But ones you know Your S.O.Ps and you IFR procedures, then I 
would say it is the right place to come. The standard is very high when you do 
the check ride. So remember if you know your procedures, then you will pass. It 
is all up to you. The instructor was very good. This A/C is an Autopilot 
aircraft so if you again know how to operate the A/P(MCP) and the FMS,SOPs. I 
would say if you don't pass the check ride then it is not because of the school 
it is because of you did study .I got the the instructors telephone number and 
I should just call and ask if I did not understand something. Well it is easy 
for me to say because I passed the check ride but one thing I know I did not 
get it for free.<br>
(study) Why did I take my rating here it because Mr. Walt 
said that he know people at Orient Thai and I know he is doing his best to get 
me a job there or some other plasce. As Mr. Walt said it is good bussines for 
him and my self if I get a job some where as a F/O on the B767/757 so help you 
after<br>
All in all, I was very satisfied with the whole course.</p>

 I would highly recommend AAT Global as a tool to prepare yourself for 
a career in aviation. I think, in the future, the world's airlines will seek 
out alternatives to the high cost of aircrew training. AAT Global is an obvious 
choice, not only for the airline, but also for those individuals looking to get 
a leg up on the competition. For those pilots who have yet to be exposed to 
high performance aircraft and/or the complex systems found in today's modern 
airliners, AAT Global provides a well designed ground school program which will 
guide the student along at his/her own pace.<br>
<br>
 By far the most 
enjoyable (and demanding) portion of the program was the 20 hours in the Full 
Motion Simulator. After enduring over a hundred hours of ground schooling and 
25 hours in a fixed base Flight Training Device, the full motion sim will seem 
a welcome relief. The reality, however, is that during this portion of the 
training, the demand on the understanding of the auto flight system and be able 
to have a working knowledge of Electrics, Hydraulics, the Fuel system and all 
the other systems found on the flight deck. Due to the high cost of full motion 
sims, it is essential that the student prepare him/herself with hour upon hour 
of home study so that the instructor is not forced to'freeze' the sim to take 
the time to explain what should have been learned during the ground school 
segment; maximize your tim in the sim by being FULLY prepared!!! Again, at 
times, the student may seem overwhelmed but by the fourth or fifth session, 
things will begin to take shape. But don't expect the instructor to ease off. 
In fact, the training will continue to become more and more demanding the 
further into the course and, when you've completed the flight test you will be 
amazed at how much you've accomplished.<br>
<br>
 The instructor for the Airbus 
course is one of the most experienced professionals in the airline industry and 
AAT Global is indeed fortunate to have him on staff. He will provide airline 
specific training at the highest level, far above and beyond the requirements 
for Transport Canada. His knowledge, background and familiarity with Airbus 
products are impressive to say the least and his ability to demonstrate 
procedures provides the student with an endless stream of information that is 
easily understood. Althoug at times the student may feel as though he/she is 
overwhelmed, it is clear that the insructor has a vested interest on an 
individul's progress; the instruction is the polar opposite to the typical 
flight-training environment where instructors are only mindful of themselves. 
It is obvious that the instructor wants the student to succeed and he is more 
than willing to help out when the student feels he/she is falling behind.</p>
