<h2>737&nbsp;Re-Generation</h2> December 22, 2008 4 comments <br>

<p><strong>Update, January 1:</strong></p> 
<p>We always get a sense of satisfaction when Boeing confirms our news.<strong>
</strong>Here&rsquo;s an excerpt of a Bloomberg story picking up on the 737 
&ldquo;re-generation&rdquo; piece we did for Aviation and the Environment 
magazine (see below).<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<h2>Boeing considers 737 enhancements</h2> 
<p>Bloomberg News</p> 
<p>January 1, 2009</p> 
<p><em>Boeing Co., whose 737 is the world&rsquo;s most widely flown plane, 
said it&rsquo;s studying new &ldquo;product enhancements&rdquo; as replacement 
plans for the aircraft have been delayed toward the end of the next decade.</em>
</p> 
<p><em>The Chicago-based company is considering rolling out more changes to 
the current version of the jet as it has done since 2000, with improvements to 
performance, comfort and navigation, Russell Young, a spokesman in Seattle, 
said Wednesday.</em></p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;We will share the details of future enhancements when we have 
decided to implement them,&rdquo; Young said.</em></p> 
<p><em>With environmentalists and the slumping economy putting pressure on the 
industry, Boeing is considering a bridge model that would provide a 10 percent 
improvement until a replacement is ready, according to the current edition of 
Aviation and the Environment magazine.</em></p> 
<p>The full story may be found here.<em><br>
</em></p> 
<p><strong>Original Post, December 22:</strong></p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a teaser for a story we&rsquo;ve written for the next issue of 
Aviation and the Environment magazine; the full magazine may be foundhere; the 
article referenced below begins on Page 18:</p> 
<p><em><strong><strong>Is Boeing planning a major 737 improvement programme?
</strong></strong> </em></p> 
<p><em>The current stated position of Boeing and Airbus is that the 
next-generation of single aisle aircraft will be available around the 2020 
mark. Would it make sense to delay this date if significant performance and 
environmental improvements could be made to the current generation relatively 
quickly?</em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>Boeing is quietly studying how to improve the 737 Next Generation, 
according to sources quizzed for a report in the December/ January issue of 
Aviation and the Environment, who all have knowledge on some level of the 
Boeing studies.</em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>Among the possibilities being explored is the placement of a scaled-up 
version of a Pratt &amp; Whitney geared turbofan engine on the aircraft. This 
would necessitate a massive structural change of the 737, with the introduction 
of a new wing, taller landing gear and a redesigned wingbox. Boeing is also 
looking at CFM&rsquo;s LEAP-X engine, although the engine maker says it is 
developing the engine for an entirely new platform. In addition, the 2016 
certification date would push the arrival of an entirely new aircraft out much 
further than 2020.</em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>Additionally, a new avionics system seems likely, in which RNP would 
come as standard. A range of internal systems improvements are being 
considered, which would make building and maintaining the aircraft easier.</em>
</p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>The combined fuel burn improvement of these measures could be as much 
as ten per cent &ndash; potentially making it very attractive to airlines as a 
&ldquo;bridge&rdquo; aircraft&hellip;</em></p>

<h2>Odds and&nbsp;ends</h2> December 17, 2008 Leave a comment <br>

<p>As the year trickles down to a close, we&rsquo;re going to post some news 
items in one post with any commentary we see fit to add. We don&rsquo;t expect 
to be posting at all (unless some huge happens) between Christmas and New 
Year&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p><strong>December 22:</strong></p> 
<p><em>Air Transport World</em> reports that Boeing has set the end of April 
for the first flight of the 787. We hope that works, but there is still risk of 
unknown-unknowns that could delay this until the third quarter. Boeing has 
previously announced first flight will be in the second quarter, which could be 
any time from April 1 to June 30.</p> 
<p><em>The Seattle Times</em> has this year-end story, looking at Airbus and 
Boeing.</p> 
<p>The tanker competition is back in the news, with this editorial and this 
news story, both from <em>The Mobile Press-Register</em>, and these items 
quoting Boeing IDS president James Albaugh and Northrop Grumman president Ron 
Sugar that kick off the latest controversy.</p> 
<p><strong>December 17:</strong></p> 
<p>From: Schaeffers Research comes this item:</p> 
<p><em><strong>The Boeing Company</strong></em></p> 
<p><em>Dow component The Boeing Company (BA: sentiment, chart, options) was 
slapped with a &ldquo;sell&rdquo; rating today by Societe Generale, as the 
French firm made its way through the aerospace-and-defense sector. Also in 
today&rsquo;s note, B/E Aerospace (BEAV) was initiated at &ldquo;hold,&rdquo; 
General Dynamics (GD) was started with a &ldquo;hold&rdquo; rating, and 
Lockheed Martin (LMT) was started at &ldquo;buy.&rdquo;</em> </p> 
<p><em>The downbeat initiation today comes on the heels of Boeing&rsquo;s 
warning last week that the launch of its 787 Dreamliner would be delayed by yet 
another 6 months, due to issues caused by a machinists&rsquo; strike and 
improperly installed fasteners.</em></p> 
<p><em>As its Dreamliner drama drags on, analysts have grown increasingly 
skeptical of BA.</em><em>Zacks reports 9 &ldquo;holds&rdquo; and 1 
&ldquo;strong sell,&rdquo; compared to 8 &ldquo;buy&rdquo; or better ratings. 
As today&rsquo;s note from Societe Generale reveals, there&rsquo;s still plenty 
of room for more negative brokerage notes to hit the shares. Any additional 
skeptical notes could extend the stock&rsquo;s year-to-date drop of 55%.</em>
</p> 
<p>Schaffers also has this related item:</p> 
<p><em>The Boeing Company (BA: sentiment, chart, options) was broadsided with 
another bearish brokerage note this morning, marking the second straight 
session of negative news from the analyst community. Yesterday, Societe Generale
initiated coverage on BA with a &ldquo;sell&rdquo; rating following yet another 
delay in the company&rsquo;s much anticipated 787 Dreamliner. This morning, 
Deutsche Bank cut its price target on the shares to $39 from $48. The brokerage 
firm also reiterated a &ldquo;hold&rdquo; rating on the equity.</em> </p> 
<p><em>There is room for the situation to deteriorate further on Wall Street, 
as 8 of the 17 analysts following BA rate the shares a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; or 
better, according to</em><em>Zacks.com. Meanwhile, </em><em>Thomson Financial 
reports that the stock&rsquo;s average 12-month price target rests at $57.11 
per share &ndash; a 47% premium to the stock&rsquo;s Monday close at $38.74.
</em></p> 
<p><strong>Our comment</strong>: Societe Generale, or SocGen to those of us in 
the business, is awfully late to the party. We agree (unfortunately, since we 
have a long position in Boeing stock) that there is more downside left in the 
price. Until Boeing clearly is positioned to achieve first flight with the 787, 
doubts remain and the company&rsquo;s credibility is shot. 
&ldquo;Performance&rdquo; is now the only thing that will count&ndash;not 
predictions and projections by Boeing.</p> 
<p>Many brokerage firms consider a &ldquo;Hold&rdquo; rating a negative 
recommendation.</p> 
<p><strong>Back to the Tanker</strong></p> 
<p>Reuters has this story about the debate between Northrop Grumman supporting 
a &ldquo;best value&rdquo; approach to the re-compete for the KC-X contract and 
Boeing supporting a &ldquo;low price&rdquo; selection.</p> 
<p>Northrop&rsquo;s &ldquo;best value&rdquo; combines the most-capable concept 
that won it the contract last year. Boeing&rsquo;s &ldquo;low price&rdquo; 
relies on the total life cycle analysis that favors its airplane. Northrop says 
the lowest price might not be the best product. (An interesting position to 
take since its price was $3bn less than Boeing, but Northrop fears that 
Boeing&ndash;knowing Northrop&rsquo;s price&ndash;can now low-ball the next 
round of bidding.)</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re reminded of the story when former astronaut Frank Borman became 
CEO of Eastern Airlines. Borman, commander of the first Apollo mission around 
the moon, was facing the notoriously militant IAM during one of his early 
meetings at the new chief of Eastern. A grizzled machinist finally asked 
Borman, &ldquo;Why should we follow the advice of someone dumb enough to sit on 
top of a rocket built by the lowest bidder?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Borman found the humor in the question as the entire crowd cracked up.</p>

<h2>Overwrought&nbsp;concerns</h2> December 16, 2008 2 comments <br>

<p>As the world economy and the airline industry seemingly implodes, there is 
an increasing amount of concern emerging among some aerospace analysts and 
Internet bloggers over what this means for Airbus and Boeing.</p> 
<p>The consensus is that Airbus and Boeing will begin seeing serious declines 
in aircraft deliveries as early as next year.</p> 
<p>These concerns have been exacerbated by the announcement from China&rsquo;s 
central government that it wants the airlines to defer deliveries next year. As 
we pointed out some weeks ago, this is highly unusual: China historically has 
been a stalwart through bad times for Airbus and Boeing, growing and ordering 
airplanes when other regions in the world were going through major downturns.
</p> 
<p>This has led some to particularly point to the new Airbus assembly facility 
in China as a risk factor for Airbus.</p> 
<p>There certainly is sound reason for concern, but so far this is overwrought.
</p> 
<p>We participated in a conference last week that included Airbus and Boeing 
officials. During our private conversations with them, we came away more 
comfortable that for 2009 at least, the two companies are not going to see 
major declines in deliveries, based on current market conditions.</p> 
<p>This is a different distinction than deferrals, and a this is an important 
distinction.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Excusable&nbsp;delay&rdquo;</h2> December 12, 2008 3 comments <br>

<p>If anyone had any doubts about Boeing paying penalities for delays as a 
result of the 58-day IAM strike, in which the conventional wisdom was that 
Boeing did not, doubt is removed with this contract language we found (while 
looking for something else) between Southwest Airlines and Boeing.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Customer acknowledges that (i) the obligations of 
Boeing&hellip;are premised upon Boeing&rsquo;s manufacturing capability prior 
to the IAM Action; and (ii) delay in the performance in any obligation of 
Boeing under this Purchase Agreement resulting from the IAM Action is an 
Excusable Delay&hellip;.&rdquo;</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: Boeing, Southwest

<h2>Boeing revises 787 schedule&nbsp;again</h2> December 11, 2008 4 comments 
<br> 
<p>As expected, Boeing revised its 787 schedule, now listing the first flight 
in the second quarter next year and first delivery into the first quarter of 
2010. These represent slips of about six months.</p> 
<p>The Boeing press release may be found here.</p> 
<p>The timetable infers a nine month flight test program. Most observers 
believe this is aggressive. Aerospace analysts are nearly unanimous that a full 
year is more likely.</p> 
<p>Boeing&rsquo;s statement is vague about when in the second quarter it now 
expects first flight. Based on information we have, we think the end of the 
second quarter is the most likely scenario, but the first flight could also 
slip to the third quarter. This is also based on information we have.</p> 
<p>Boeing wants to get the program moving, but insiders tell us that there 
remain risks and uncertainties that continue to cast doubts on any schedule 
announced.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, 10:15 AM PDT</strong>: Addison Schonland, Jon Ostrower and 
Scott Hamilton have a20 minute podcast discussing the 787 delay and new 
management changes announced by Boeing shortly after the 787 delay was 
announced.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, December 12:</strong></p> 
<p>Reaction is mixed about the delay and the management changes.</p> 
<p>First, on the delays: These had been widely expected, both as a result of 
the strike by the IAM, the discovery of fasteners incorrectly installed and of 
reports (including our own) that software integration continues to be an issue.
</p> 
<p>Aerospace analyst Howard Rubel of Jefferies Co. calls the newly announced 
schedule &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; and has a buy on the stock. Robert Stallard of 
Macquarie Capital (with an Outperform) is less kind. He writes in a note issued 
afterward:</p> 
<p><em>Given its 100% failure rate in forecasting the 787 timetable so far, we 
expect airlines, suppliers and investors to be suitably skeptical on to whether 
this latest revised schedule will actually be achieved.</em></p> 
<p>Goldman Sachs (Sell) believes Boeing will run over both new time estimates. 
Goldman projects a 3Q09 first flight instead of Boeing&rsquo;s projected 2Q09; 
and a 3Q10 delivery instead of Boeing&rsquo;s projected 1Q10, the major 
difference being a one year flight test program instead of a nine-month 
schedule put forth by Boeing.</p> 
<p>The market reacted benignly to the announcements Thursday, with the stock 
trading down less than 2%. But today is a different story. While the market is 
off (at 9AM PST) less than 1%, Boeing is off 4.75%.</p> 
<p>On the management changes:</p> 
<p>Surprisingly, some inside and close to Boeing don&rsquo;t know whether Pat 
Shanahan&rsquo;s appointment to oversee all new airplane programs is a 
promotion or a kick upstairs because of the continuing problems with the 787 
program, which he was brought in from Boeing&rsquo;s Integrated Defense Systems 
unit to oversee and fix. Shanahan still oversees the program, as well as the 
troubled 747-8 development, but a new person, also from IDS, has been appointed 
to directly manage the 787 program. This person reports to Shanahan.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s telling of Boeing&rsquo;s credibility problems that even some 
inside Boeing question just what the Shanahan moves means. The efforts to read 
between the lines is like reading The Kremlin at the height of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Analysts generally applaud the moves as an effort by Boeing to fix 
problems. One of Boeing&rsquo;s industrial partners believes Shanahan has done 
a good job and that he is on track to do greater things at Boeing.<em>The Wall 
Street Journal</em> reporting suggests Shanahan is now one of two candidates to 
succeed Boeing Commercial Airplanes president Scott Carson, who is on countdown 
to mandatory retirement in about four years. The other contender, announced in 
the management restructuring, according to<em>The Journal</em>, is Ray Conner. 
Conner comes from a top position in sales but has a solid background in supply 
management and this is his new position position within BCA&ndash;something 
that has been a key stumbling area for the 787. Conner doesn&rsquo;t report to 
Shanahan; he reports directly to Carson.</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: 787,

<h2>Airbus critique of&nbsp;787</h2> December 3, 2008 6 comments <br>

<h2>Profiles of Airbus Financial, Boeing&nbsp;Capital</h2> December 3, 2008 
Leave a comment <br>

<p>With the capital market crunch, Airbus and Boeing each said it is prepared 
to step up and help with customer financing. Below are two stories we did for 
Commercial Aviation Online, a subscription-only service, about Airbus and 
Boeing financial arms. Each is reprinted here with permission. The stories 
appeared on CAO&rsquo;s website November 3.</p> 
<p><strong>Profile: Boeing Capital Corp.</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Industry officials and observers fret that the capital market crunch will 
make it difficult for airlines to finance airplanes through the rest of this 
year and well into next. Accordingly, analysts predict that OEMs will have to 
step up next year with $5bn in financing support.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The Boeing Co. said its Boeing Capital Corp. (BCC) finance arm stands ready 
to provide $1bn in financing next year. Airbus, engine makers and regional 
airliner producers can be expected to pick up the rest of the OEM, based on 
history.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>BCC&rsquo;s federal 10Q filing with the US Securities and Exchange 
Commission shows that BCC has $1.9bn in financing commitments for 2009 out of 
$9.5bn in total on its books (see Table).</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Boeing officials are clear that they want BCC to be the lender of last 
resort for its customers, and BCC officials are pounding the pavement looking 
for financing for its customers so BCC doesn&rsquo;t have to step up.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>The pressure on BCC is building, however. BCC received &ldquo;a number of 
requests from both domestic and foreign airlines to reduce lease or rental 
payments or otherwise restructure obligations,&rdquo; the company said in its 
10Q filing. BCC did not provide any details, other than agreement to 
restructure the terms on 16 717s leased to Midwest Airlines. Midwest is hanging 
on by its flaps, returning these 16 airplanes to BCC and downsizing by 
contracting with regional airlines to operate the Embraer 170 jets. All 717s 
are to be returned by the end of this year.</p>

<h2>787 update due&nbsp;shortly</h2> December 2, 2008 6 comments <br>

<p><strong>In this week&rsquo;s column: </strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>787 Update Due Shortly</li> 
<li>Other program issues at Boeing</li> 
<li>The decline and fall of the Chinese aviation sector</li> 
<li>The impact of the Global economies on Airbus and Boeing</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>787 Update Due Shortly</strong></p> 
<p>Boeing plans an update of the 787 program by mid-December, with 
expectations that a new timeline for first flight and first delivery will be 
forthcoming. Aerospace analysts diverge on these predictions right now.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>JP Morgan forecasts first flight in the first quarter while Goldman Sachs 
predicts 2Q09 or 3Q09. Based on conversations we&rsquo;ve had with Boeing 
insiders, the unions and others, we believe the first flight is likely in the 
June-August 2009 period.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When, then, will be the first delivery? Cowen &amp; Co. predicts 2Q10; JP 
Morgan and Goldman predict delivery will be a year after the first flight. 
Boeing has consistently maintained that it can complete flight testing within 
6-9 months after first flight, but given the track record of its predictions so 
far, we&rsquo;re inclined to side with JP Morgan and Goldman and go with one 
year after first flight.</p>

<h2>SPEEA vote&nbsp;today</h2> December 1, 2008 Leave a comment <br>

<p><strong>Update, 10:30 PM PST</strong>:</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s official: 79% of the engineers and 69% of the technicians voted 
for the contract.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, 9:00 PM PST</strong>:</p> 
<p>Unofficial returns: it appears that both contracts passed. It may be 
another 30-60 minutes before the returns are official.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, 8:00 PM PST</strong>:</p> 
<p>SPEEA is still counting the votes. There was a record vote of more than 
14,000. Estimates are another 60-90 minutes for the tally to be completed.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post</strong>:</p> 
<p>SPEEA, the engineer&rsquo;s union at Boeing, will tally votes today on a 
new contract.</p> 
<p>Actually, there are two contracts&ndash;one for the technicians and one for 
the engineers.</p> 
<p>Up to now, technicians have been pretty vocal that they don&rsquo;t like 
the terms negotiated by the SPEEA leadership, responding with a vitriol that 
surprised the negotiating team, who thought they had a good contract deal. This 
raised fears that the technicians might reject the contract, while the 
engineers are expected to approve it.</p> 
<p>Final results aren&rsquo;t expected to be counted until late tonight 
(Seattle time), but we&rsquo;re geared up to post results as soon as we have 
them this evening.</p> 
<p>If, by chance, either contract is rejected and a strike is authorized, 
don&rsquo;t expect a walk-out. SPEEA historically goes back to the bargaining 
table to renegotiate if a contract is rejected. SPEEA has only struck twice in 
40-some years.</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: Boeing, SPEEA <br>
