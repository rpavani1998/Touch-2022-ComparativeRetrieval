<b>Remark</b> <b>
Photographer</b> <br>
JA8081 (cn 25064/851) I've seen the Space Shuttle 
take-off and I've seen plenty of topless women in SXM but nothing comes close 
to a 747 coming directly in your direction just a few hundred feet below you! 
This was really amazing. It's a real air-to-air picture, no discussions please!

<b>It is a great shot - how was it taken - where was the photographer - it 
almost makes you unsteady since it it hard to get used to a 747 coming straight 
up at you - again where was the photographer to get this fantastic perspective?

Seeing a photo of the front of a 747 taken from the air, with the runway in the 
background is spectacular, It's certainly not an easy shot to get, and not one 
you see everyday.</b>

Incredible photo. The wingtips are actually above the fuselage! Also, I love 
what long lenses can do. For the skeptics: I've used Google Earth to look at a 
2004 sat image of the runway and determined the amount of runway shown is 728 
feet. The photographer is actually a bit above the aircraft's heading as well. 
I *think* there might be enough data to determine the distance to the camera, 
exact angles, etc. But it'd take somebody with more time than me to figure that 
all out.</b>

Someone commented about a similar picture that this would be the last thing you

I'd have to change shorts faster than anyone could change planes.</b>

The most unique angle for a takeoff shot I've ever seen and a fabulous

air-to-air capture!</b>

<b>I've 
calculated the angle of climbing of the 747, by assuming that the crossed

3.1:4.3 so sin(-1) gives 45 degree !!! could it happen ?? WOW</b>

<b>For 
those wondering how this shot was captured...<br>
<br>
 There's a little VFR 
corridor along the coastline over LAX. Private planes fly through the corridor 
to avoid entering the class B airspace around the airport. The corridor passes 
over the runways allowing for shots like this. I've had a couple very similar 
shots, though not with the 747.</b>

While I love this photo for just about everything about it, it is not as 
amazing as some of the comments seem to suggest.<br>
<br>
 The plane is not 
going vertical -- it is simply a normal climb, captured with a really long 
lens. Consider what you are really seeing in the background. That is at least 
800 feet of runway in view (thank you Google Maps and satellite view). But yet 
the lines seem to be very close together. This was shot with a very long lens 
from out over the ocean -- probably close to 1.5 to 2 miles from the lift off 
point. Neither the plane nor the photog were in any danger or doing anything 
out of the ordinary -- the camera just shows what we all take for granted -- 
some serious forces at work to lift this beast off the ground.<br>

the 747 is an awesome sight), the graceful curve of the wings. The timing is 
remarkable, to be in that position at just the right time for the head-on shot 
as the gear is halfway up...great composition!</b>

International Airport</i></b> by member September11<br>
In 1928, the Los 
Angeles City Council selected 640 acres in the southern part of Westchester as 
the site of a new airport for the city. The fields of wheat, barley and lima 
beans were converted into dirt landing strips without any terminal buildings.
