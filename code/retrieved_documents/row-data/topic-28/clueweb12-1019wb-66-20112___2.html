<h2>Boeing considers 40/mo for 737 rate; Airbus ups A320 to&nbsp;40</h2> July 
28, 2010 28 comments <br>

<p><strong>Update, July 30</strong>: Airbus announced today it will increase 
the production rate on its A320 family to 40 per month.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Boeing is considering going to a production rate of 40 737s per month, with 
a decision to come in September.</p> 
<p>Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Jim Albaugh gave us this number during our 
interview with him at the Farnborough Air Show.</p> 
<p>The company is working with its supply chain to determine if and when this 
can be achieved.</p>

<h2>Boeing wide-open on 777 future:&nbsp;Albaugh</h2> July 27, 2010 73 comments
<br> 
<p><strong>Update, Aug. 1</strong>: Dominic Gates&nbsp; of <em>The Seattle 
Times</em> has a long article with the views on the 777 successor from Tim 
Clark, CEO of Emirates Airlines&ndash;which operates more 777s than any other 
airlines.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Boeing has a wide-open mind about how to meet the competition coming from 
the Airbus 350-1000 to its 777-300ER, says Jim Albaugh, president of Boeing 
Commercial Airplanes.</p> 
<p>The possibilities include and entirely new aircraft; re-winging the -300ER; 
putting new engines on; and putting a composite fuselage on the airplane.</p> 
<p>The latter point is a bit of an eyebrow-raiser. Reskinning the 777 would be 
a massive undertaking and essentially amount to an entirely new airplane.</p>

<h2>Farnborough: Odds and&nbsp;Ends</h2> July 22, 2010 6 comments <br>

<p><strong>Best One-Liner:</strong></p> 
<p>Airbus&rsquo; John Leahy is famous for his witty one-liners, but the best 
one at the show goes to Boeing&rsquo;s Randy Tinseth. As we were waiting for 
the Boeing press briefing to begin on Day 1, we remarked how dirty the Airbus 
A380 test plane was. A regular at air shows, the plane was parked right outside 
the media center. It clearly hadn&rsquo;t been scrubbed down for looks, with 
dirt streaks all over the fuselage. The logos of the A380 customers at the 
front of the airplane were equally covered in dirt. It stood in sharp contrast 
to the new Boeing 787 parked just yards away from the A380, in its shiney white 
paint.</p> 
<p>Said Tinseth, virtually giggling: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t wash it because 
they&rsquo;re afraid one of the logos will come off,&rdquo; suggesting a 
cancellation. &ldquo;And you can quote me on that.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>We told the story to one of Airbus&rsquo; top PR people, who grudgenly 
acknowleged it was a great line. No slouch himself, he retorted the 787 was so 
clean because it hasn&rsquo;t flown much.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Thursday</h2> July 22, 2010 3 comments <br>

<p>For all practical purposes for commercial aviation geeks, the air show is 
over. Even John Leahy left.</p> 
<p>There was one significant order today, from Virgin America for 40+20 Airbus 
A320s with options to convert to A321 and to use sharklets.</p> 
<p>Boeing announced a minor order swap involving three airplanes. Bombardier 
didn&rsquo;t announce any CSeries orders, but then, we knew by July 12 this was 
unlikely.</p> 
<p>Below are the orders through Day 4, minus a couple of minor ones due after 
we left the field to wrap up our reporting before going home. Over the course 
of the next week or so, we&rsquo;ll pick write some additional stuff.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Wednesday</h2> July 20, 2010 4 comments <br>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We have updated the Tuesday posting at the end of 
that column.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, 8:00 PM BST</strong>: Day 3 orders are now included toward 
the end of this post.</p> 
<p>Another day, another set of aircraft orders are expected. From the buzz, it 
sounds like this could a Boeing day.</p> 
<p>But the speculation continues hot-and-heavy about the failure of Bombardier 
to announce an order from Qatar. As many news stories report, Qatar&rsquo;s 
Abkar Al Baker said there is an issue with Pratt &amp; Whitney yet to be 
resolved and, from our discussions, we know there is and have a general idea 
what it&rsquo;s about.</p> 
<p>Alas, we were told off the record (damn!) and cannot share it here.</p>

<h2>Tanker face off at&nbsp;Farnborough</h2> July 20, 2010 63 comments <br>

<p>Boeing and EADS held tanker briefings this week&ndash;Monday for Boeing, 
Tuesday for EADS.</p> 
<p>Boeing offered up top program officials while EADS offered up two American 
crewmen from its test flight program, a pilot and a boom operator. 
Boeing&rsquo;s briefing was a standard presentation followed by Q&amp;A; most 
of the briefing was taken up by the formal presentation.</p> 
<p>EADS was an interactive briefing with reporters after a few brief remarks, 
with nearly the entire session devoted to Q&amp;A.</p>

<p><strong>Updated, Wednesday 05:00 BST</strong></p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve updated this posting after all the text with orders completed 
through Day 2,</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>Tuesday will be another day where orders are expected to be announced. See 
our Monday posting, updated at 4pm for this information.</p> 
<p><strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney</strong></p> 
<p>We will be attending a breakfast hosted by Pratt &amp; Whitney; perhaps we 
can get some information about the issues Qatar reports in connection with its 
potential CSeries order. Or perhaps not. OEMs are loath to talk about 
customers. But we shall see.</p>

<p><strong>Updates throughout the post, 415PM BST.</strong></p> 
<p>Here is a look ahead for Monday at the Farnborough Air Show and what might 
be expected for news and orders in the coming week. We&rsquo;ll update this 
post at the end of the day.</p> 
<p><strong>Airbus</strong></p> 
<p>John Leahy on Saturday predicted at least 130 orders will be announced this 
week. Boeing thinks that if Leahy is predicting 130, he&rsquo;s got a lot more 
up his sleeve. Leahy also predicted orders from leasing companies, signaling 
improving economies. See individual companies below.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Sunday-Boeing</h2> July 18, 2010 5 comments <br>

<p>The Boeing 787 arrived today at the Farnborough Air Show, a day before the 
event actually begins.</p> 
<p>The plane, #3&ndash;the so-called &ldquo;interior airplane&rdquo; equipped 
with an interior that is more suitable for testing operations than 
representative of the actual 787 customer interior&ndash;arrived at 9 am UK 
time, after a 9 hour flight from Paine Field at Everett (WA). At least 100 
people lined Farnborough Road adjacent the airport with binoculars and 
telephoto cameras to watch the landing.</p>

<h2>Farnborough/Sunday-EADS</h2> July 17, 2010 Leave a comment <br>

<p>We&rsquo;re at the Farnborough Air Show and on Saturday attended the 
day-long EADS media briefings. We filed reports exclusively for KIRO TV (CBS) 
in Seattle. These stories are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Airbus predicts 130+ orders at the air show;</li> 
<li>Leahy says Airbus has to get current programs right before proceding with 
decision whether to re-engine the A320 family; decision due in 4th quarter;</li>
<li>Boeing Defense facing growing competition from EADS;</li> 
<li>EADS sees &ldquo;fair and open&rdquo; competition for KC-X;</li> 
<li>EADS chief raps &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; WTO.</li> </ul> 
<p>These stories are below the jump.</p> 
<p>Separately, word leaked from Farnborough that Boeing will get an order fo 
20 777s, but this is a swap from the failing DAE Capital of Dubai.Here is this 
story.</p>
