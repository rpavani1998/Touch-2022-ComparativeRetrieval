 CEO of EADS, the parent company of Airbus, Louis 
Gallois gestures during a news conference in Hamburg, northern Germany, 
Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2012.  HAMBURG, Germany (AP) - Airbus took in a record number 
of orders for new commercial aircraft last year as strong demand for its 
revamped single-aisle plane helped it best U.S. rival Boeing Co. in the race 
for orders for the fourth year running.<br>
<br>
The European jet maker said 
Tuesday that it took in 1,419 net new orders in 2011, worth $140 billion, well 
above Boeing's total of 805 aircraft. That topped the previous record of 1,413 
net orders recorded by Boeing in 2007.<br>
<br>
Airbus also delivered 534 
aircraft last year, up from 510 a year earlier and keeping the title of world's 
biggest jet maker that it has held since 2003. Boeing delivered 477 aircraft in 
2011.<br>
<br>
For this year, Airbus targets around 570 jet deliveries, 
including about 30 of its A380 super jumbo, the world's largest commercial jet.
<br> <br>
Louis Gallois, the CEO of Airbus parent company EADS, said 2011 
revenue will be &quot;nicely above&quot; the euro45.8 billion recorded in 2010. 
EADS reports its 2011 earnings in early March.<br>
<br>
Gallois is due to 
retire in May but the EADS executive declined to comment on his succession 
plans. He spoke more freely about the ongoing European financial crisis, saying 
that the credit downgrades of nine European countries including France by 
rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's last week &quot;is only making things more 
complex.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We need stronger and faster European coordination 
to solve the crisis,&quot; Gallois said. He offered up Airbus and EADS as an 
example for European leaders to draw on. &quot;We are more than a symbol of 
European integration. We are the part of Europe that works,&quot; Gallois said.
<br> <br>
That comment will possibly strike some observers as ironic, given the 
group's history of Franco-German management tensions and the difficult 
development of its A380 super jumbo, which was delayed by years and massively 
over budget due to engineering problems between the group's French and German 
work forces.<br>
<br>
Airbus' recent success has been based on its revamped 
single aisle jet the A320neo.<br>
<br>
It's a modified version of the existing 
workhorse jet, the A320, with improved engines and modified wingtips to make it 
allegedly 15 percent more fuel-efficient than Boeing's 737.<br>
<br>
The plane 
will only start delivering in 2015 but Airbus is using it now to cash in on 
airlines' need to reduce sky-high fuel costs and cut carbon dioxide emissions.
<br> <br>
The jet maker took in 1,226 net orders for the A320neo in 2011, 
including a single order for 200 of the aircraft worth $18.5 billion from 
Malaysian budget airline AirAsia.<br>
<br>
Airbus' top salesman John Leahy said 
that the jet maker expects total orders to fall to between 600 and 650 aircraft 
this year, including the A320neo, after Boeing responded with a new version of 
its best-selling 737 model with a new engine, which it calls the 737 max.<br>

<br>Southwest Airlines Co. will be the first recipient of Boeing's new plane, 
representing the biggest firm order in the company's history by number of 
planes - 208 - and by list-price value, at nearly $19 billion.<br>
<br>
Leahy 
cautioned that competition from Boeing's revamped 737 could unseat Airbus from 
its leadership in the orders race this year. After a market share of new orders 
of 64 percent last year, &quot;in 2012 we will be down around 50 percent or 
probably lower than that,&quot; Leahy told reporters at the company's annual 
New Year's news conference.<br>
<br>
Airbus is by far the largest part of EADS, 
which also encompasses the Astrium satellite builder and Cassidian defence 
electronics contractor. Troubles in developing and launching new aircraft 
programs like the A350 wide-body long-range jet and the A400M military 
transporter have squeezed the group's profitability for years, but Gallois 
promised improving results starting this year.<br>
<br>
&quot;We will see 
significantly better profitability as soon as 2012,&quot; Gallois said, thanks 
to Airbus efforts to get its troubled programs back on track. Higher 
deliveries, stronger pricing and cost savings across all of EADS' divisions 
will also help lift the group's profitability, Gallois said.
