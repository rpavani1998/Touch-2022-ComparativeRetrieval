<h3> Leveling Demand at Boeing </h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>I was intrigued by an article in The New York Times this week describing 
how Boeing is actually turning away orders, even from some of its best 
customers.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boeing 
is hot right now, partly because of troubles at Airbus. Orders for 
Boeing&rsquo;s extremely popular 737 and the new 787 are pouring in.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But 
current Boeing executives remember how the company was hot not quite a decade 
ago. At that time, the company accepted every order coming in the door. 
Production couldn&rsquo;t keep up, and serious problems resulted. Many of 
today&rsquo;s executives used to work for people who lost their jobs because of 
what happened.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
today, Boeing is taking only the work it is sure it can handle. For example, 
Southwest Airlines, a very good customer, wanted to add two planes to an 
existing order for 737s, and Boeing said no (though it did make Southwest aware 
of two nearly-new planes that could be purchased elsewhere). Keep in mind that 
planes being ordered now won&rsquo;t be delivered for several years.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
effect, Boeing is seeking to level demand. And if I read the story correctly, 
it is trying to do so not in a high-handed or arbitrary way, but by 
communicating with customers so they will understand and accept what the 
company is doing.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leveling 
demand and building partnerships with customers are certainly elements of a 
lean strategy, and I&rsquo;m inclined to commend Boeing for its approach.</p> 
<br> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now 
I&rsquo;ve never heard of  Toyota  declining an order from a customer. But that 
doesn&rsquo;t mean Boeing has done anything wrong. True,  Toyota  is probably 
better at predicting demand than Boeing. However, selling planes is very 
different from selling cars, with longer lead times, hugely expensive products 
(and correspondingly huge orders), and a global marketplace that can suddenly 
change in a radical way (as it did after 9/11).</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps 
Boeing has learned more about lean than the  U.S.  automakers. Ford&rsquo;s 
hiring of Alan Mulally of Boeing to be Ford&rsquo;s CEO increasingly looks like 
the right move.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
Times article also noted that, in contrast to its practices years ago, Boeing 
now does little more than design and final assembly. Major assemblies, 
including parts of the fuselage and wings, are built by suppliers in a variety 
of countries and shipped (in 747s) to  Everett ,  Washington . That may not be 
lean, but it certainly spreads risk on to suppliers.</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One last 
note: Early this year I went on a public tour of the Boeing facility in  Everett
 (which, they boast, is the largest building in the world by volume, according 
to the Guinness book of records). It&rsquo;s quite a sight; if you&rsquo;re 
ever in that area, make it a point to go.</p> <br>

Re: Leveling Demand at Boeing<br>

Final assembly of the 737 went from 4 inventory turns 
in 1995 to 50 (!) by 2005, largely to the credit of Carolyn Corvi's leadership 
and Shingijutsu's consulting. Even more amazing, when Carolyn got promoted to 
owning all of Commercial continuing production (i.e., everything but the 787), 
she'd built an organization and culture that's since taken 737 FA to over 100 
turns.<br>
<br>
You don't get to 100 turns with badly leveled demand. McNerney 
grasps this. It's also possible that Ford might be better off with Carolyn 
instead of Alan.</p> </dd>
