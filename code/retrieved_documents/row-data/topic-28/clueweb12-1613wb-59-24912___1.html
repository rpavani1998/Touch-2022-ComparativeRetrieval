class seats won't make their way onto the 747 or A340 <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>UPDATE |&nbsp;</strong>Cathay Pacific has now revealed the first 
details of its new Premium Economy class as well as a replacement for the 
airline's much-criticised international economy seat, both of which will debut 
in March 2012 on flights between Hong Kong and Sydney &ndash;&nbsp;see our full 
report for details.</p> 
<p>And while the premium economy seats will appear on CX's Boeing 747s and 
Airbus A340s, those planes will keep the current fixed-shell economy seat along 
with the cubicle-style business class bunks, as detailed below.</p> 
<p><strong>PREVIOUS |&nbsp;</strong>Cathay Pacific's impressive new 
business-class seats won't be installed into the Hong Kong flag-carrier's 
current Boeing 747-400 or Airbus A340 fleet.</p> 
<p>The rollout of the new seats and cabin is underway on factory-fresh Airbus 
A330-300 and Boeing 777-300ER &ndash; due to enter service in March and April, 
respectively &ndash; before the airline begins an extensive refit of existing 
A330s and 777s.</p> 
<p>But the 747s and A340s, which together represent one-third of Cathay's 
total fleet and over three-quarters of the dedicated three-class long-haul CX 
fleet, will retain the existing and often-criticised 'business-class 'cubicle' 
seating.</p> 
<p>&quot;The new business class seats will not be installed in either the CX 
747s or the 340s&quot; a Cathay Pacific spokesperson confirmed to<em>Australian 
Business Traveller</em> today. &quot;The new seats are only going into the 
longhaul A330s and 777-300ERs.&quot;</p> 
<p>The 747s and A340s &quot;will be gradually phased out over some 
years&quot;, according to Cathay Pacific, with the 777-300ER and A330-300s 
taking their place.</p> 
<p>However, Cathay Pacific is keeping mum on rumours that the new A330-300 and 
777-300ER may include apremium economy section &ndash; which would be a first 
for the airline &ndash; along with a new design for the fixed-shell economy 
seats.</p> 
<p>Cathay Pacific is one of the world's largest customers for both aircraft, 
with 31 A330s currently in service (plus three more on order) and 14 777-300ERs 
(with 18 more on order).</p>
