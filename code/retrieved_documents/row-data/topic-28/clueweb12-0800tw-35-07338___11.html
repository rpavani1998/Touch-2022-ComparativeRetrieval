<p>Why Would Anyone be Against the Export-Import Bank? </p> By&nbsp; Veronique 
de Rugy <br>
March 8, 2012 4:06 P.M. <br>
Comments  4 <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s the question asked by&nbsp;the editors over at <em>Bloomberg 
View</em>.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>U.S. exports have been a rare bright spot in an otherwise sluggish economy, 
increasing by about 20 percent over the last two years and driving about half 
of all economic growth.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s curious, then, that some U.S. companies, conservative groups and 
lawmakers are arguing against reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank of theUnited 
States, whose sole purpose is to help strengthen the economy and create jobs by 
supporting the nation&rsquo;s exports.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I am more than happy to explain why we should get rid of the Export-Import 
Bank. First, the Ex-Im Bank is nothing more than corporate welfare. This is an 
agency that is in the business of subsidizing private companies with taxpayer 
dollars. It is unseemly and I will never understand why anyone would think that 
it is a role of the federal government to help private companies make money, 
pay their employees, get loans, or produce goods or services at home or abroad. 
If a company can&rsquo;t stay in business on its own, that is probably because 
it is trying to sell stuff that consumers don&rsquo;t want to buy. If 
that&rsquo;s the case, why should consumers then have to buy the goods or the 
service indirectly through their taxes?</p> 
<p>An excellent paper by Cato Institute&rsquo;s trade analyst Sallie James 
exposes&nbsp;just how unseemly, inefficient, and irrelevant the Export-Import 
Bank is.&nbsp; As James explains, the Bank not only picks winners and losers by 
guaranteeing the loans of private companies, but it also introduces unfair 
competition for all the U.S. firms that do not benefit from such special 
treatment. Also, while advocates for the programs claim that the bank takes 
risk that the private sector is unwilling to take (I wonder why the private 
sector will, year after year, pass up supposedly great opportunities), the 
bank&rsquo;s lending activity is almost certainly irrelevant, since so few U.S. 
exports are supported through Ex-Im Bank activities.</p> 
<p>With this paper, James is following in the steps of David Stockman who, 
over 20 years ago, called for the termination of the Ex-Im Bank. In the book,
<em>The Triumph of Politics</em>, Stockman does a great job at exposing the 
export subsidies as a mercantilism illusion based on the strange idea that a 
country &mdash; in this case the United States &mdash; can raise its employment 
and produce wealth by selling its goods for less than they cost to produce. In 
a way, we can think of the Bank as a charitable organization with an 
international bent. The truth, he explains, is that &ldquo;export subsidies 
subtract from GDP and jobs, not expand them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More importantly, the idea that export subsidies will create jobs and 
increase GDP is yet another example of the single-entry-bookkeeping mentality 
that has larded the federal budget with so many subsidies and payments to 
special interests.</p> 
<p>One of the biggest special interests, in this case, is Boeing. Yes, the 
giant manufacturer Boeing. According to the&nbsp;<em>Washington Examiner</em>
&rsquo;s Tim Carney, in 2009, 90 percent of the loan guarantees issued by the 
Bank went to subsidize Boeing. Not surprisingly, as a result, in 2011 Boeing 
&ldquo;accounted for 45.6%, or $40.7 billion, of ExIm&rsquo;s total exposure in 
fiscal 2011.&rdquo; With the help of the federal government guarantees, the 
company gained contracts from airlines like Air China and Air India.</p> 
<p>Good for Boeing. However, not good for Delta or other U.S. companies that 
have to compete with Air China and its new discounted Boeing planes. The<em>
Wall Street Journal</em>, for instance, reported on Saturday that &ldquo;In a 
letter to Congress last month, Delta estimated that Ex-Im cost the U.S. airline 
industry up to 7,500 jobs and $684 million a year.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Moreover, what does it tell you about Boeing and its ability to fly on its 
own without the help of taxpayers that the Bank has been providing for decades? 
Enough, already.</p> 
<p>I will leave the conclusion to David Stockman, because of his points&rsquo; 
incredible relevance in today&rsquo;s politics. It is an important message to 
Republicans in particular and it applies to all forms of subsidies (oil, gas, 
wind, small businesses, manufacturers, automobiles, banks, and others). He 
writes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I had long insisted, to any liberals who would listen, that the supply-side 
revolution would be different from the corrupted opportunism of the organized 
business groups; that it would go after weak claims like Boeing&rsquo;s, not 
just weak clients such as food stamp recipients. Given the heave-ho to the 
well-heeled lobbyists of the big corporations who keep the whole scam alive 
would be dramatic proof that we meant business, not business-as-usual.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Washington, listen up.</p> <br>

<p>Veronique, the problem with all of your arguments against the Ex-Im is that 
they presuppose a fair global playing field for Boeing. Very few Americans are 
supportive of corporate welfare (liberal term) or crony capitalism 
(conservative term), but unfortunately many instances of US government support 
are in direct response to anticompetitive behavior by other governments.</p> 
<p>You write about the ExIm bank but not about the French and German support 
for Airbus. Conservatives love to scream about Solyndra but say almost nothing 
about the Chinese subsidies are are killing the Western PV solar companies. 
Don't get me started on the Chinese policy of technology transfer or the EU ag 
policy...</p> 
<p>I think we can all agree that a free market without government distortion 
is more efficient, but what is the best move when other countries decide to 
take advantage of your naivet&eacute;?</p>

<p>Let me discuss the following point:</p> 
<p>&quot;Moreover, what does it tell you about Boeing and its ability to fly 
on its own without the help of taxpayers that the Bank has been providing for 
decades?&quot;</p> 
<p>This question is worded wrong. The right question is &quot;What does it 
tell you about the industry for the manufacture of major commercial aircraft 
(say about 100 to 600 passengers) that no company in the world can fly on its 
own without government involvement?&quot;</p> 
<p>Why, when Boeing's ability to manufacture wings is infinitely superior to 
Mitsubishi's previously non-existent capabilities did Boeing farm out the wing 
manufacture to Japan? And Korea Aerospace for the stabilizers? Did Boeing just 
decide they no longer knew how to make airplane doors, and that's why they had 
to subcontract those out to France? Did the world's #1 manufacturer of landing 
gear just forget how to do it, and then miraculously it turns out the Brits are 
the best place to go if you want landing gear for a type of plane they 
themselves never even built?</p> 
<p>No.</p> 
<p>Boeing is the best manufacturer of this type of aircraft in the world. But 
along came a government consortium called Airbus who could offer financing on 
their planes that no private company could match because the financing came 
from European governments who could just print the money they needed.</p> 
<p>Boeing, in turn, figured out that the only way airlines around the world 
would buy their planes over Airbus is if they handed over the manufacture of 
the plane to the countries where these government-financed airlines were based. 
And so on.</p> 
<p>But to answer your original question, what I know is that Boeing has the 
best technology, and the best manufacturing know-how to build the 787, and they 
had to farm all of that work out to substandard companies around the world if 
they hoped to sell the airlines in those countries any of the their planes.</p> 
<p>This really isn't a rant against what you wrote. But here is one thing we 
know: Boeing or any other aircraft manufacturer isn't going to survive just 
because they make the best product at the best price that the world has ever 
known. These days, you can't sell major commercial aircraft that way.</p>

<p>But, Stockman was wrong. That's not what happened. Given that it's not what 
happened, maybe we shouldn't spend so much intellectual and financial resources 
on the GOP. Let them lose in November and perhaps there will be enough despair 
to produce a new party in which a few of the representatives know something 
about economics.</p>
