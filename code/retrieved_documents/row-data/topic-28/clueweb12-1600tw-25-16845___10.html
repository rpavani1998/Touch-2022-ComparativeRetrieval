<b>Remark</b> <b>Photographer</b> <br>
VH-OQA (cn 
014) On 4th November 2010, the 1st QANTAS A380 &quot;Nancy Bird Walton&quot; as 
QF32 had an uncontained engine failure in 1 of its RR Trent 900 engines over 
Indonesia. It limped back to Singapore, landing safely with significant damage. 
After nearly 1 1/2 years, the aircraft has been repaired and it is seen on it's 
first test flight out of Singapore. From the early and steep climb angle, the 
pilots were obviously very confident! [Nikon D3] <br>
