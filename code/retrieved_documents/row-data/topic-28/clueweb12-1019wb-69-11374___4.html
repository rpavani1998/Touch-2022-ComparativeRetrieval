<h2>Hazy has deal to buy&nbsp;ILFC</h2> November 22, 2008 Leave a comment <br>

<p>Bloomberg News has a story quoting the head of mega-lessor saying he has a 
deal to buy International Lease Finance Corp. from insurance giant AIG.</p> 
<p>ILFC is the largest customer of Airbus and Boeing. It owns and manages a 
fleet of slight more than 1,000 planes with a value of $55 billion.</p> 
<p>This is a highly positive development for the airline industry. But as is 
often the case, the devil is in the details. The deal has to close (next year) 
and it remains to be seen how it is structured and what flexibility the company 
has in the future.</p> Categories: Airbus, Boeing Tags: Airbus, Boeing, ILFC

<h2>Boeing and the Southern&nbsp;strategy?</h2> November 21, 2008 1 comment 
<br> 
<p>Steve Wilhelm of the Puget Sound Business Journal (Seattle) has a long story
about Southern states &ldquo;eyeing&rdquo; Boeing in the wake of the IAM 
strike. Speculation has been rampant (in peaks and valleys) that Boeing might 
be fed up with its unions in heavily unionized Washington State and be looking 
South when it comes time to build its next airplane (or two).</p> 
<p>One quote from the story that is filled with irony is:</p> 
<p><em>&ldquo;If I was a Boeing executive, I&rsquo;d look at the state of 
Alabama and see there&rsquo;s a qualified work force &hellip; I&rsquo;d take a 
look at the assets we have,&rdquo; said Stephen Nodine, president of the Mobile 
County Commission, whose offices are in Mobile, Ala.</em></p> 
<p>Alabama, of course, is the proposed site for the Northrop Grumman/Airbus 
KC-30 tanker proposed in competition with Boeing&rsquo;s KC-767, which will be 
assembled in the Seattle area if Boeing ultimately wins the contract. But what 
is more ironic is that Boeing&rsquo;s Integrated Defense Systems denigrated the 
skills of the Alabama workers during the tanker competition, suggesting they 
might have trouble building a tricycle if Northrop got the tanker contract. (It 
apparently mattered not that IDS has a large facility in Huntsville, AL.) 
Boeing&rsquo;s Commercial unit cringed at the IDS statement because the 
Northrop/Airbus production model isn&rsquo;t that different from BCA&rsquo;s 
assembly model, including the high-profile 787 program (in which case IDS may 
have a point) but to a lesser degree with the 767 itself.</p> 
<p>And speaking of tankers, Northrop didn&rsquo;t even wait for the new 
Congress and the new president to take office before resuming the tanker wars 
with an advertisement that got the Pentagon&rsquo;s chief purchaser up in arms 
(so to speak). Read about this onehere and here.</p> 
<p>We criticized Northrop for being slow off the PR and advertising mark in 
2007, letting Boeing&rsquo;s well-oiled machine set the agenda and frame the 
debate. (Once Northrop got running, it did make up for lost ground and scored 
some great PR/advertising hits.) But this advertisement, and more so it&rsquo;s 
timing, strikes us as very premature. Nobody knows who the decision-makers in 
the Pentagon will be (and in any event, they shouldn&rsquo;t be influenced by 
ads) and we doubt Members of Congress are paying much attention to the tanker 
debate right now anyway. With four million people expected for the inauguration 
of Barak Obama and the organization of the power structure in Congress, we 
suspect the Members of Congress might just be focused on something else right 
now.</p>

<h2>Is Boeing fundamentally&nbsp;sound?</h2> November 20, 2008 Leave a comment 
<br> 
<p>Addison Schonland and Richard Aboulafia join us in a 19 minute podcast 
discussing whether Boeing is fundamentally and structurally sound. This follows 
comments by Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Scott Carson at a Credit 
Suisse conference saying so.</p> 
<p>Do we agree or disagree? Listen and find out.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, November 21:</strong></p> 
<p>We inadvertently linked the podcast reference to a nice environmental 
story-we fixed it. Sorry about that.</p> Categories: Boeing Tags: Boeing, Scott

<h2>Delta to buy from Boeing&ndash;and&nbsp;Airbus</h2> November 17, 2008 2

<p>James Wallace today confirmed what we predicted from the get-go when Delta 
Air Lines and Northwest Airlines announced its merger months ago: that Delta, 
long a solid Boeing customer, will buy from Airbus.</p>

<h2>747-8 delayed by 9&nbsp;months</h2> November 14, 2008 Leave a comment <br>

<p>Boeing just announced what we were the first to predict nearly a year ago: 
flight testing and delivery of the 747-8 will be delayed. The press release is
here.</p> 
<p>Boeing announced a nine month-long delay, in part due to engineering 
resource issues. We&rsquo;ve been reporting a creeping delay in the program, 
initially six months, then nine and most recently one year. Customers tell us 
they expect a year&rsquo;s delay.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the French news service AFP reports Airbus may not deliver 
all&nbsp; A380s next year originally planned. This short item ishere.</p>

<h2>SPEEA strike authorization vote&nbsp;set</h2> November 13, 2008 Leave a 
comment <br>

<p>Negotiations between Boeing and SPEEA appear to have taken a discouraging 
turn. SPEEA scheduled a strike authorization vote by the Council (SPEEA&rsquo;s 
parliament) to authorize a strike vote by the membership.</p>  The strike vote 
of the general membership will proceed soon thereafter (next week or so), says 
Ray Goforth, the executive director of the engineers&rsquo; union. Economic 
issues and Boeing&rsquo;s desire to severe the Utah engineers from the main 
SPEEA contract remain unsettled. <strong>Update, 9:30 PM PST</strong>: SPEEA 
issued this statement: 
<p><strong>Boeing stalls negotiations &ndash; Council issues strike 
authorization vote &ndash; Managers improperly poll members</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>With The Boeing Company stalling on responding to SPEEA 
counterproposals, the Northwest Council on Thursday authorized a member vote 
seeking strike authorization power for the Professional and Technical 
negotiating teams.</strong><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>The bargaining unit councils each voted unanimously to hold a 
member vote on strike authorization. A simple majority &ldquo;YES&rdquo; vote 
gives the negotiation teams authority to call a strike if necessary. The action 
comes after two days of non-productive and discouraging dialog with Boeing over 
key economic issues, including wages, pensions, medical benefits and the 
company&rsquo;s ongoing attempts to strip Utah engineers from the Professional 
contract.</strong><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;A great deal of progress has been made,&rdquo;</strong> 
<strong>said </strong>SPEEA Executive Director and Chief Spokesperson Ray 
Goforth.<strong> &ldquo;It would be unfortunate for customers, shareholders and 
employees of Boeing if we can&rsquo;t reach a deal at the bargaining 
table.&rdquo;</strong><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Main Table talks started Oct. 29 after eight months of negotiations 
in committees. Early this week, SPEEA negotiation teams made some major moves 
in an attempt to bring negotiations to a successful close. Despite the efforts, 
Boeing negotiators remain convinced they can force SPEEA members to accept a 
contract that keeps wages below market, removes pensions for new hires and 
opens the door to fragmenting bargaining units into smaller and smaller groups 
of employees.</strong><strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>By mutual agreement, specific details of the responses and 
counterproposals will not be available until negotiations conclude.</strong>
<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>Managers improperly poll members</strong></p> 
<p> SPEEA has heard that some managers are polling employees in the workplace 
about their views on terms and conditions of employment. This improper 
communications is being used by Boeing negotiators to gauge what is an 
acceptable contract offer for SPEEA members.</p> 
<p> For legal reasons, we are interested in your experience if contacted by 
management. This type of employee polling is not acceptable as part of the 
collective bargaining process and is affecting our ability to successfully 
conclude our contract negotiations with the company.</p> Categories: Boeing

<h2>Capital market&nbsp;meltdown</h2> November 11, 2008 Leave a comment <br>

<h2>SPEEA negotiations&nbsp;update</h2> November 10, 2008 Leave a comment <br>

<p><strong>Update, November 11</strong>: We&rsquo;re cautiously optimistic a 
settlement will be reached without a strike.</p> 
<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p> 
<p>A strike authorization vote by SPEEA members is scheduled for tomorrow in 
the contract negotiations with Boeing, but it&rsquo;s likely to be postponed 
until a final offer comes in from Boeing.</p> 
<p>If this is like the IAM process, a strike authorization is different from 
an actual strike vote. It&rsquo;s sort of a sense of the membership. The IAM 
had a vote in July that long preceded the actual strike vote&nbsp; September 3.
</p> 
<p>Right now things don&rsquo;t look encouraging but they also don&rsquo;t 
seem quite as bleak at the situation preceding the IAM contract votes.</p> 
<p>The best description is that the situation is highly fluid and uncertain.

<h2>767 sales keep line alive for&nbsp;tanker</h2> November 10, 2008 Leave a 
comment <br>

<p>Boeing last week announced an order for four more 767s (in this case, 
-300ERs) that help keep the line alive pending a new competition for the USAF 
aerial tanker.</p> 
<p>Boeing previously booked an order for nine 767s for All Nippon Airways, a 
customer affected by delays with the 787. Japan Air Lines is expected to take 
nine 767s as well; there are nine listed on Boeing&rsquo;s website as 
unidentified&ndash;these are believed to be JAL&rsquo;s. Another airline 
ordered two 767s.</p> 
<p>All four carriers are 787 customers affected by the delays.</p> 
<p>There are now 68 unfilled orders listed on Boeing&rsquo;s web site for the 
767. Boeing&rsquo;s production rate is currently one a month but it likely will 
go to two a month as early as 2010.</p> 
<p>This is good news for Boeing in keeping the 767 line active while Boeing 
competes for the KC-X contract. (Good news, that is, which originates from the 
bad-news 787 delays, of course.)</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how the Department of Defense and the Air Force will 
handle the new round of KC-X competition. DOD hasn&rsquo;t said if it will 
simply restart the competition suspended from the GAO decision upholding the 
Boeing protest or completely restart the competition. If the former, a decision 
could be rendered within a year and the 767 production rate is moot. If the 
competition is completely restarted, worse-case, it could take up to four 
years. Before the 767 orders were placed to take care of 787 customer delays, 
the backlog was about four years at one a month. The current backlog and 
production rate gives Boeing four years to keep the line open.</p> 
<p><strong>Update, November 11</strong>: Lan Chile just announced the 
acquisition of four 767-300ERs for delivery starting in 2012 to accommodate 
delays in its 787 order.</p> Categories: air force tanker, Boeing, Northrop

<h2>Were they at the same&nbsp;meetings?</h2> November 6, 2008 1 comment <br>

<p>Boeing and SPEEA have two very different views of the progress of the 
bargaining to date and contract offer that was presented by Boeing to the 
engineers&rsquo; union Thursday.</p> 
<p>The SPEEA contract expires December 1. Many of the contract provisions 
proposed by Boeing are similar to those offered to the IAM, which rejected the 
Boeing contract and struck for 58 days. SPEEA said that if it strikes, one will 
come in January or February, just about the time Boeing returns to pre-IAM 
strike production levels.</p> 
<p><strong>Below is the Boeing communique</strong> issued by chief negotiation 
Doug Kight; the SPEEA response follows. (We can&rsquo;t do anything about the 
type size differences&ndash;there is no hidden meaning in the different sizes 
in the following messages.)</p>
