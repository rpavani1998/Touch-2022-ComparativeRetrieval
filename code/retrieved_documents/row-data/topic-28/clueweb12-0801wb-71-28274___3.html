<h1>And now let's hear from the Senator for Boeing...</h1> 
<h2>  Posted By David Bosco Tuesday, February 1, 2011 - 3:32 PM  Share </h2> 
<p> Earlier this week, the World Trade Organization issued a sealed decision 
on the long-running dispute between Airbus and Boeing over which of them 
receives impermissible government subsidies and how much they've received. The 
fact that the decision has not been released publicly means that the sparring 
over its content has a surreal quality.</p> 
<p> The dispute has also acquired an unusual political flavor. In the past, 
Boeing-Airbus disputes were good, old-fashioned America versus Europe affairs, 
which at least had the virtue of clarity.&nbsp; Now, both companies operate 
facilities around the world and engage in all sorts of complex partnering 
arrangements. Airbus's parent company, for example, is competing with Boeing to 
build a huge tanker plane for the U.S. Air Force. Quite shrewdly, it has 
determined that those planes will be assembled at a plant in Alabama. And that 
in turn means the WTO ruling has pitted U.S. senator against U.S. senator. 
Here's thestatement from Alabama's Richard Shelby: </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> The WTO&rsquo;s ruling unquestionably states that Boeing received 
significant government subsides prohibited by the WTO.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s 
decision should end Boeing supporters&rsquo; attempt to derail the tanker 
competition by arguing that the trade dispute is one-sided.&nbsp; In fact, the 
ruling shows that Boeing received at least $5 billion in illegal aid and has 
never repaid these funds to the US taxpayer.&nbsp; &nbsp;As I have said many 
times before, we must not allow the WTO rulings or political motivation delay 
the tanker award.&nbsp; Moving forward, the competition to replace our aging 
tanker fleet should continue, unimpeded.</p> </blockquote> 
<p> And here's the reaction from Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas: </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> The final ruling by the WTO merely confirms the interim report findings, 
which found in Boeing&rsquo;s favor on the majority of the challenges. Attempts 
to skew this ruling in the European Union&rsquo;s (EU) favor is a exercise in 
distraction. Once this ruling is made public in the near future, the sunshine 
will refute much of the claims in support of the EU position and truly indicate 
where the market distorting benefits flowed.</p> </blockquote> 
<p> Sigh. Has it come to this, gentlemen? Where are we as Americans if we 
cannot at least join forces against Airbus, the European Union, and its 
socialistic system of subsidies?</p> <br>

<p>I live in the general area of</p> 
<p>I live in the general area of where the Airbus tanker would be built, and 
my congressman Jeff Miller is a big supporter of the plan and military 
industrial complex in general.</p> 
<p>It's ridiculous that this can come down to a jobs debate. Congressmen are 
more worried about there re-elections than they are who would build the better 
airplane.</p> 
<p>I think that with the new Republican majority you could see my area winning 
on this issue which is a shame if Boeing can make a better airplane. If 
Democrats in Washington state can't turn this debate on Republicans the way you 
did in your closing statement, I'm going to be upset.</p>  &nbsp; <br>
