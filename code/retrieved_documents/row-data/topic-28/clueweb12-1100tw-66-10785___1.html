 B/E Aerospace Inc. heads into 2012 flush with optimism. The 
Wellington, Fla.-based manufacturer of aircraft-cabin products is coming off a 
record 2011, in which the company landed an $800 million order from Boeing Co. 
to supply its modular lavatory system for the Next-Generation 737 and the 737 
MAX.
<p></p> 
<p></p> In February, B/E Aerospace Chairman and CEO Amin Khoury declared that 
the Boeing order could be &quot;our most important award ever.&quot; Khoury 
pointed out that the $800 million order not only positions B/E Aerospace as a 
Tier 1 supplier to Boeing but also opens the door for &quot;substantial&quot; 
opportunities to retrofit existing jets with the modular lavatories.
<p></p> 
<p></p> Despite soaring to all-time highs in sales, earnings, cash flow and 
bookings in 2011, the sky could be the limit for B/E Aerospace. The company is 
forecasting a 23% jump in 2012 earnings per diluted share, thanks to a record 
backlog of $7.9 billion and &quot;our expectation for continued growth in 
global passenger travel and attendant increases in capacity,&quot; Khoury said 
in February.
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>

<p></p> Citing strong demand, Airbus in February 2011 announced plans to ramp 
up production of its A330 wide-body to 10 airplanes per month by second-quarter 
2013. Final assembly of the A330 and A340 takes place at a hangar at 
Toulouse/Blagnac Airport (pictured here) in southwestern France. <br>

Indeed, these are boom 
times for some aerospace suppliers. With Boeing and Airbus SAS projecting a 
worldwide demand for some 30,000 new commercial jets over the next two decades, 
suppliers such as B/E Aerospace could be poised for a good run.
<p></p> 
<p></p> However, as Boeing and Airbus push toward aggressive production-rate 
ramp-ups on a number of major programs, there are murmurs that some 
manufacturers in an already stretched supply chain might struggle to keep pace.
<p></p> 
<p></p> When aviation-industry consultant Scott Hamilton attended the Pacific 
Northwest Aerospace Alliance's annual conference in early February, the 
production crunch was a hot topic.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;The suppliers are very concerned about their ability to meet the 
ramp-ups that Airbus and Boeing are talking about, as well as continuing to 
service Bombardier, Embraer and the new entrants that are coming along,&quot; 
says Hamilton, who is managing director of Leeham Co. LLC, an Issaquah, 
Wash.-based commercial-aviation consulting and research firm.
<p></p> 
<p></p> The larger suppliers, Hamilton adds, aren't the only ones biting their 
nails.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;The concern is coming from up and down the line, because the 
supply chain is only as good as its weakest link,&quot; Hamilton says.
<p></p> 
<p></p> The numbers certainly point to a gargantuan task ahead for the OEMs 
and suppliers, asserts Scott Thompson, U.S. aerospace and defense leader for 
PwC.
<p></p> 
<p></p> While 2011 marked the first year that Boeing and Airbus combined to 
deliver more than 1,000 commercial airplanes (477 for Boeing and 534 for 
Airbus), the aerospace titans also ended 2011 with a record combined backlog of 
more than 8,000 jets (3,771 for Boeing and 4,437 for Airbus).
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;So they have eight years of backlog at current production 
rates,&quot; Thompson says. &quot;And they've been taking up the production 
steadily in recent years.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> In its most recent market forecast, Boeing predicted that surging 
demand in the Asia Pacific region will propel a $4 trillion market for new 
commercial aircraft over the next 20 years. Boeing foresees a global need for 
33,500 new commercial jets over the next two decades, while Airbus forecasts a 
need for 27,800 new jets over the same time period.
<p></p> 
<p></p> If the long-term demand comes in at, say, 30,000 airplanes, that means 
Airbus and Boeing will need to crank out 1,500 commercial airplanes per year -- 
after producing 1,000 planes for the first time ever in 2011.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;Simple math is they need to raise production 50% to 60% over the 
long term to meet the demand,&quot; Thompson says. &quot;For this industry, 
that's very, very challenging.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> <b>Risky Business</b> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> The industry's operating model is moving into uncharted territory. A 
recent PwC report assessing the operational readiness of the aerospace supply 
chain notes that the aircraft OEMs have &quot;pushed much of the design and 
manufacturing work to suppliers, often in the form of risk-sharing 
partnerships.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> The much-publicized shortage of fasteners for the 787 Dreamliner -- 
one of a number of supply chain glitches that pushed the program three years 
behind schedule -- illustrates how, in this new dynamic, one supplier's risk is 
everyone's risk, asserts Doug Gates, a partner in KPMG's Global Aerospace &amp; 
Defense practice.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;It could be the smallest component that could really come back 
and get you,&quot; Gates says.
<p></p> 
<p></p> In the case of the Dreamliner, transferring more risk to Boeing's 
far-flung global supply chain added &quot;a lot of complexity&quot; and &quot;a 
lot of failure points&quot; to the program, Gates says.<br>
&quot;Granted, that 
[risk sharing] was just at the Tier 1 level. But we're seeing more 
responsibility rolling down the supply chain, and more assumption that they'll 
step up and assume a broader role,&quot; Gates adds.
<p></p> 
<p></p> Unfortunately, there could be more ugly failure points lurking around 
the corner. When PwC recently analyzed the readiness of suppliers to deliver 
the ramp-ups projected for the Boeing 737 and 777, the Airbus A320 and A380, 
and other major programs, the firm concluded that 21% of suppliers face a high 
risk of falling behind on the demand.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;The bottom line,&quot; says PwC's Thompson, &quot;is our 
recommendation that all companies really scrutinize the supply base, and really 
talk to their suppliers about what their plans are. But also they need to 
independently assess what their realistic capabilities are to increase 
throughput and, if necessary, to have the capital expenditures to keep up.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> More and more, Thompson is seeing companies &quot;all the way up and 
down the supply chain&quot; assessing the operational and financial readiness 
of their suppliers.
<p></p> 
<p></p> They're also recognizing the &quot;growing interdependence&quot; 
between themselves and their suppliers, says Bruce King, senior vice president, 
operations, for Rockwell Collins Inc.
<p></p> 
<p></p> Given the dizzying complexity of the components and assemblies 
involved in aircraft production, King believes it's time to jettison &quot;that 
old model of buyer and supplier.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;We're going to have to form more what I'll characterize as 
relationships down the supply chain,&quot; King says. &quot;We will expect more 
from our suppliers in their performance, and we're also going to have to hold 
ourselves -- as a customer to our supply base -- more accountable for how we 
interact with them as well.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> Rockwell Collins keeps the lines of communication open with its supply 
chain through a number of mechanisms, including an annual supplier conference 
and an advisory council comprised of representatives from key suppliers.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;It really gives us an opportunity to hear from our suppliers 
about what we can do to be more effective in how we engage with them,&quot; 
King says.
<p></p> 
<p></p> <strong>A Perfect Storm?</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> Like B/E Aerospace, Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins is in a 
prime position to profit from the global boom in commercial-aircraft sales.
<p></p> 
<p></p> The company's electronics and communications systems have a major 
presence on the 787 Dreamliner -- which features more Rockwell Collins content 
than any other commercial jet in the company's history -- as well as the Boeing 
747-8 and the Airbus A350. And in recent months, there's been a steady stream 
of new commitments, including an Emirates Airlines order in November for 
Rockwell Collins's threat-detection and navigation-sensor technology on 32 new 
Airbus A380s and 30 new Boeing 777s.
<p></p> 
<p></p> The company's robust commercial-aircraft business helped Rockwell 
Collins post a 15% increase in fiscal 2011 earnings per share and boost overall 
revenue from $4.6 billion in fiscal 2010 to $4.8 billion in 2011 -- despite a 
decline in its government business. &nbsp;
<p></p> 
<p></p> As production ramps up on the commercial-aircraft side, continuing 
weakness in Rockwell Collins's government business could play to the company's 
advantage. King notes that the company employs an &quot;integrated business 
model,&quot; in which its government and commercial divisions share 
manufacturing, quality-control, purchasing and R&amp;D resources and facilities.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;This allows us to flex our capability to accommodate those peak 
demands in a very efficient manner by leveraging those resources from across 
the entire Rockwell Collins enterprise, not just those from within a single 
business area,&quot; King says.
<p></p> 
<p></p> Flexibility, though, is not a luxury that some smaller suppliers enjoy 
-- especially in the wake of the Great Recession. While some suppliers are 
licking their chops over the opportunities in commercial-aircraft 
manufacturing, others are still licking their wounds.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;The supply chain really took a hit back in late 2008, early 
2009,&quot; says Chuck Gumbert, founder of the Tomcat Group, a Wichita, 
Kan.-based aerospace and aviation consulting firm. &quot;A lot of companies cut 
way back. And as part of that cutting back, they let go of experienced, key 
talent because it cost too much, and they tried to backfill that with 
lower-caliber individuals.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> At the same time, Gumbert has watched the aerospace supply chain 
shrink through consolidation and acquisitions. The most recent data from PwC 
show that the number of mergers and acquisitions in the aerospace and defense 
industry has surged steadily from 173 in 2002 to a record 341 in 2011.
<p></p> 
<p></p> When the dust settles on the smaller deals, aerospace suppliers often 
find themselves owned by private-equity firms, Gumbert notes. The new owners 
usually push the companies to grow their business and cut costs -- without 
investing in manufacturing capacity.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;So you have people in place, who are under the gun with the new 
owners, who've already cut everything to the bone, and now we're going to have 
the ramp-up take place with the Boeings and the Airbuses and hopefully business 
aviation,&quot; Gumbert says. &quot;Now [the suppliers are] going to try to 
produce, and they're not going to be able to -- which is going to put more 
angst on the individuals running these organizations. It's going to be a 
painful event.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> Gumbert, a former fighter pilot who named his consulting group after 
the F-14 Tomcat that he flew in the Navy, says he saw this production crunch 
coming. That's why he formed the Tomcat Group, which specializes in turnaround 
consulting services for distressed aerospace and aviation suppliers.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;I had a good discussion with a large OEM this morning, and they 
said, 'Yeah, we're already starting to see it,'&quot; Gumbert said in February. 
&quot;[The suppliers] can't keep up. They haven't maintained their investment. 
They're trying to do more with less, and they seem to think, 'That's OK, let's 
just take an organization that has 250 people and double our output by adding 
25 people.' That isn't going to happen.&quot;
<p></p> 
<p></p> Richard Aboulafia, however, is a bit more sanguine about the prospects 
of the industry meeting its production targets.
<p></p> 
<p></p> &quot;They're really going to be flexing their industrial muscles over 
the next year or two,&quot; says Aboulafia, who is vice president, analysis, 
for the Teal Group. &quot;I think they'll probably get most of the way there. 
But there are going to be some pitfalls.&quot;
