<br>  With a huge backlog of orders for commercial aircraft makers Boeing and 
Airbus, and the demand for regional air transport, the future looks very rosy 
indeed. <b>By C. Kenna Amos, Contributing Editor</b>  &ldquo;The emergence of 
strong&nbsp; economies in the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India and China] countries, 
along with the rapidly growing demand for air transport in these regions, will 
drive a regional jet market for the next two decades.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was 
last October&rsquo;s opinion of Dick Slansky, senior analyst withARC Advisory 
Group (ARC, www.arcweb.com), Dedham, Mass., about use of the 100-150 passenger 
jets used in domestic routes worldwide. &nbsp;

<br>
 In the 
October 2010 ARC Insights &ldquo;Global Aerospace and Defense Trends for 2011 
and Beyond,&rdquo; Slansky also said, &ldquo;With a huge backlog of orders for 
commercial aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus, and the demand for regional air 
transport, the future looks very rosy indeed.&rdquo;
<p></p> A year later, the 28-year veteran of Chicago-based Boeing Co.  ( 
www.boeing.com) stands by his assessment. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s right on 
schedule. That&rsquo;s because the timeframe in aerospace manufacturing is a 
lot longer.&rdquo;
<p></p> For example, Boeing has more than 850 orders for its two-engine 787 
Dreamliner, Slansky states. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re almost three years late but, 
even so, they&rsquo;ve only had about four cancellations. What this says is 
that air carriers really want this plane.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s primarily because 
the 787 is a carbon-fiber composite. &ldquo;Couple that with more 
fuel-efficient engines, and you have an airplane that can go very long 
distances,&rdquo; he remarks. Boeing indicates its 787-8 will carry 210-250 
passengers for approximately 8,800-9,400 statute miles, while its 787-9 will 
carry 250-290 passengers for approximately 9,200-9,800 nautical miles.
<p></p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving to an era of &lsquo;plastic&rsquo; 
airplanes, made of composites,&rdquo; Slansky says as he talks about the 787. 
Strength and fuel efficiency drive the shift. &ldquo;They have a 33 percent 
better strength-to-weight ratio, which means you can make an airplane that 
weighs considerably less. And less weight translates to less fuel.&rdquo;
<p></p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Besides the 787, Slanky&rsquo;s former 
employer sees other roses in its future.&nbsp; In mid-June 2011, Boeing 
announced increased production rates for its next-generation two-engine 737 jet 
to 42 planes per month. Once that rate is implemented in the first half of 
2014, Boeing expects to build on average two 737s each workday and nearly 500 
airplanes each year.
<p></p> 
<p>Paris brought debuts, sales </p> 
<p>This year&rsquo;s Paris Air Show, in late June, also brought good news for 
Boeing as well as its commercial competitorAirbus ( www.airbus.com), Blagnac, 
France. Boeing debuted its 747-8 Intercontinental and Freighter models. And CIT 
Aerospace, a unit of Livingston, N.J.-headquarteredCIT Group Inc.  ( www.cit.com
), committed to 50 of Airbus&rsquo; A320neo (new engine option) aircraft. 
Overall, Airbus won approximately $72.2 billion worth of business for 730 
aircraft: 312 memoranda of understanding worth $28.2 billion, and 418 firm 
purchase orders for approximately $44 billion.<br>
More roses bloomed in July 
2011. Boeing forecast a $150 billion market for 1,320 new passenger airplanes 
in India over the next 20 years. Then Airbus and American Airlines, a 
wholly-owned subsidiary ofAMR Corporation  ( www.amr.com), Forth Worth, Tex., 
signed a firm contract for American to acquire 260 Airbus-A320-family aircraft, 
including 130 which will feature Airbus&rsquo; new engine option. Also, all 
Airbus&rsquo; aircraft will feature sharklets, which are large fuel-saving 
wingtip devices.</p> 
<p>At the end of July 2011, Montreal-headquartered regional-jet manufacturer 
Bombardier Inc. ( www.bombardier.com) announced a net income of $211 million, 
an increase of $73 million over the company&rsquo;s last fiscal year. Currently 
the world&rsquo;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, Bombardier 
also reported a strong backlog of $56.9 billion, compared to $52.7 billion last 
fiscal year. The company also noted 43 firm orders totaling $2.8 billion for 
its C-Series aircraft.</p> 
<p>Rival regional-jet manufacturer Embraer&rsquo;s order book shows more 
robustness. On March 31, 2011, the S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; dos Campos, 
Brazil-based company (www.embraer.com) had 261 firm orders on backlog, all in 
Embraer&rsquo;s 170/190 commercial jets having seating capacity of 70-120 
passengers. Then, on Aug. 11, 2011, the company delivered the first E-190 
aircraft to China&rsquo;s CDB Leasing Co., Ltd. (CLC). CLC has ordered 30 
Embraer 190s, of which 20 are firm orders and 10 are options. China Southern 
Airlines will operate the aircraft.</p> 
<p>With such actual and projected growth, though, Boeing and maybe Airbus face 
at least two pests in their respective rose gardens. &ldquo;Boeing is 
reexamining its global supply chain, which may be overextended now,&rdquo; 
Slansky says. Workforce management also demands attention. &ldquo;It takes time 
to attain certain skill levels, so in moving that workforce around to establish 
new production lines, issues will arise,&rdquo; he forecasts.</p> 
<p>Pests also include other regional jets. Slansky mentions the Suhkoi 
Superjet 100, Mitsubishi MRJ, and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, ...
