<b>Remark</b> <b>Photographer</b> 
<br> ZS-SAU (cn 22971/578) WOW !!!!!!!! What more can I say. Only SAA can do it 
this big and outstanding. Today our President was inaugurated and SAA was asked 
to do a display. So SAA did it 3 times bigger and better by flying in formation 
using 2 x B747-300's and 1 x A340-600. Very ironic as well as the leading A340 
is replacing the older B747's in the fleet. This Saturday SAA's classics will 
also fly its final revenue flight. So indeed appropiate for the classics to 
take part in this great display. Well done SAA !!!!!!!!!!! <br>
