<p>Scary New-Generation Aircraft </p>
<p>In the wake of the recent China Airbus crash there has developed a major, 
ongoing argument regarding the relative safety of Airbus vrs. Boeing aircraft. 
It is ironic that, facts notwithstanding, the China crash has many 
&quot;earmarks&quot; of pilot error, although that is yet to be determined. 
This argument is a matter of symptoms only, since the aircraft involved merely 
represent a small factor in a larger problem. The debate has quickly turned 
into an international bickering contest with accusations flying across the 
Atlantic Ocean at the speed of light. It is my opinion that no matter what a 
pilot's culture (the aircraft should not care!), when he/she straps into the 
seat of any airplane, she/he should not have to worry if he/she is going to fly 
it or if some competent or otherwise non- pilot software writer's work is going 
to jump in from time totime to have the AIRPLANE make a critical decision.</p>
<p>Are we moving into an era wherein pilots are going to become only 
guardians, when occasionally permitted, over computers otherwise totally flying 
the aircraft? Are we almost there now? We know the next set of steps, coming 
too soon perhaps, will bring pilotless aircraft from gate to gate. But for now, 
are pilots to be incapable of having the aircraft &quot;feel&quot; even when 
they are pseudo - flying new - generation aircraft? (c.f., the Delta Airbus 
&quot;drivers&quot; who sat and chatted while the auto-throttles backed off 
until the aircraft surprised them and their passengers with a full - blown 
stall and the loss of some 3,000ft. over Florida? Don't bother to yell that 
this particlar craft was not a newer, FBW version. The point is the same either 
way. BTW, Why does Delta no longer fly the Airbus?)</p>
<p>Somewhere a compromise has to be reached in the new - generation aircraft 
whereby a pilot, for now at least, knows he/she will have direct, total and 
undisputable control CAPABILITY of the aircraft in all phases of flight. I am 
not a Luddite and I am not opposed to progress. Progress, however, must include 
SAFETY as a mainstay, and not reduced it to a &quot;necessary and, ergo, 
acceptable&quot; human loss level.I am fully aware that many military aircraft 
have computer control devices that would otherwise make the aircraft unflyable 
(i.e., by hand) under certain mission flight conditions. I am not opposed to 
that. Nor do I expect airline pilots to hand - fly their craft at high altitude 
enroute (while wearing their caps crooked and sweating), because that is 
neither feasible nor desirable. I am not asking for a step backward, just a 
closer look at current and future options of a trend already well - 
established. I am talking about zero system/autopilot surprises of a lethal 
nature, and a pilot's having direct control capability. Aircraft designers, 
manufacturers and computer programmers must not be allowed to usurp this 
capability for now. Otherwise, crew and passenger deaths will continue to mount 
as they are doing currently while aircraft and aircraft system bugs slam 
aircraft into the ground, without regard for human life or culture.</p>
<p>As for the Airbus aircraft, it seems that the newer - generation &quot;Baby 
Buses&quot; are the ones being flown by video games. They need to find a 
parking space until the bugs/systems are corrected! Airlines flying Boeing 
products also should consider if they wish to park a particular model based on 
its &quot;mystery&quot; crash history. It will not happen, of course. There is 
no doubt pilots, as we know them today, will become obsolete in the future. But 
why should lives be lost in this transition? Is there no other way available? 
Should we set a level of human loss as aircraft systems and designs change? I 
have great difficulty with this line of thought --- much less its 
implementation.</p>
