 London <br>
 London just isn't what it used to be. 
It's better! A blend of old and new, pace and buzz alongside peace and 
tranquility, and an amazingly diverse cultural scene. The sounds of Brit-pop 
and techno pour out of Victorian pubs; experimental theater is popping up on 
stages built for Shakespeare's plays; and Brits are even running the couture 
houses of Dior and Givenchy. In food, fashion, film, music, the visual arts, 
and just about everything else, London stands at the cutting edge again, just 
as it did in the 1960s. But rest assured that traditional London survives.

 Paris <br>
 Paris assaults the 
senses, demanding to be seen, heard, touched, tasted and smelled. Gaze 
impressive monuments and savor its gourmet pastiche of cheese, chocolate, wine 
and seafood. Paris is a city of vast perspectives and intimate streets, of 
formal espaces verts (green open spaces) and of quiet squares. Paris is 
relatively small as capitals go, with distances between many of its major 
sights and museums invariably walkable. Unforgettable walks exhibiting the best 
of Paris: stroll down the Champs-Elysees for the chic grand boulevard 
experience and Rue Cler for a more intimate snapshot of Parisian living.  Paris

 Barcelona <br>
 Barcelona - Spain's second city - is always on 
the biting edge of fashion, architecture, food, style, music and good times. 
Barcelona is one of the most dynamic and exciting cities on the western 
Mediterranean seaboard. Walk its narrow streets and wonderful plazas and 
discover its magic: stalls full of books, birds and flowers. Explore its new 
modern squares, designed by leading artists such as Mir&oacute; and 
Barcel&oacute; and every visitor will understand how Barcelona has been 
transformed into one of the most moderns and active cities in Europe.  Barcelona
