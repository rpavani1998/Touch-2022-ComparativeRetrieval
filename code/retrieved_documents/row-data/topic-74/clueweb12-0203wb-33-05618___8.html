<h6>DOT Advisory:</h6> 
<p>The Department of Transportation requires us to inform you of the following 
conditions. The package price is subject to change as a result of increases in 
fuel surcharges and/or government taxes until it has been paid in full. You 
must consent to the possibility that, until you pay for your package in full, 
your price could go up. Once you have paid in full we would only pass along 
increases in government taxes if applicable at that time. You have 7 days from 
receipt of the first invoice to revoke your consent and request a refund, at 
which time we would cancel your booking.</p> 
<h6>Passports and Visas:</h6> 
<p>A valid U.S passport is required for traveling outside of the U.S.; 
including to Canada &amp; Mexico. Passport application forms may be obtained 
from your local post office. All passports must contain at least 3 blank visa 
pages and must be valid for 6 months after the completion of your tour. Entry 
visa application forms will be sent prior to your departure for U.S. passport 
holders visiting the following countries: Russia ($218*), China ($193*), Brazil 
($220*) and Vietnam &amp; Cambodia ($283*). An entry fee is required upon 
arrival at the airport in Egypt ($15*), Turkey ($20*) and Zimbabwe ($30*),

per person Departure Tax is required at Costa Rica ($26*) and Peru ($31*) paid 
at the airport. A onetime Reciprocity Tax is required upon entry at the airport 
in Buenos Aires, Argentina ($140*) and Santiago, Chile ($131*); the fee can be

at any time. Please visit travel.state.gov for current information. Individuals 
who do not hold a U.S. passport should contact CIBT/ZVS at 1-866-788-1100 to 
see if visas are required.</p> 
<h6>Travel Documents:</h6> 
<p>Approximately 15 days prior to the departure date you will receive a travel 
information package that will include your airline itinerary, travel tips, 
hotel list, baggage tag, travel wallet, etc. Visas, when required, will be 
distributed as soon as they are issued by the countries involved. Please note 
that your airline tickets and other tour documentation must bear your FULL name 
as it appears on your passport.</p> 
<h6>Tour Membership:</h6> 
<p>These tours require a blend of adventuresome spirit, physical fitness, 
walking ability, mental alertness, and a capacity for accepting situations as 
they exist and not, necessarily, as we would find them in America. If you have 
health concerns, we suggest that you contact your physician to help determine 
the suitability of one of these tours for you. We regret that we are unable to 
accept requests for special diets or itinerary variations. Disabled travelers 
requiring special attention or treatment on any tour must be reported when 
reservations are made. A companion who is able to provide the required 
assistance must accompany any person who is unable to travel independently or 
who needs any type of assistance.</p> 
<h6>Baggage:</h6> 
<p>Due to limited motorcoach storage capacity, each tour member is permitted 
one large suitcase not to exceed 50 pounds in weight nor 
30&rdquo;x22&rdquo;x10&rdquo; in dimension on European tours. Handling of this 
bag by hotel porters is included in the tour price. In addition, each person is 
allowed one small piece of carry-on size luggage that does not exceed the 
dimensions of 12&rdquo;x11&rdquo;x6&rdquo; and is the complete responsibility 
of the tour member and must be taken on the motorcoach with you. Carryons with 
telescopic handles and wheels will not fit in the overhead compartments and 
therefore cannot be accepted as carry-on luggage for safety reasons. Please 
note, North America, Mexico and Egypt tours have smaller baggage dimensions 
which are noted in your pre-tour documentation. Grand European Tours (2003) 
Inc. does not assume any responsibility for loss or damage to baggage or 
passengers&rsquo; belongings. Please note: It is your responsibility to verify 
the baggage weight restrictions for the individual airlines that you will be 
traveling on as in some instances baggage is restricted. Airline baggage 
charges collected at check-in are not included and are at passengers own 
expense.</p> 
<h6>VIP Door-to-Door Transfer Service:</h6> 
<p>The VIP Door-to-Door Transfer service is available for all customers 
departing from the 41 airports highlighted on page 12 and living within a 25 
mile radius from point of departure to your chosen airport. It is an outbound 
service only. Maximum passengers in one car can not exceed four. For bookings 
with more than four people, further vehicles may be necessary and further 
supplementary charges will apply. For any journeys greater than 25 miles a 
supplementary cost for additional mileage will apply and will be advised within 
48 hours of booking if necessary. Mileage is based on journey information from 
www.mapquest. com. Should you not use the VIP Door-to-Door Transfer we will 
deduct $50 per person from your tour price (this must be advised at time of 
booking). Cancellation of service or changes must be made 72 hours before 
scheduled pick-up.</p> 
<h6>Early Departure or Extended Stay:</h6> 
<p>If you wish to depart early or extend your stay in Europe, flight and hotel 
arrangements can be made by contacting our Oregon office. Airport transfers are 
not included but may be purchased through GET. On most tours you can reserve up 
to 3 additional nights at the hotel where your tour starts and ends, however 
space may be limited and is subject to availability. Please call for our low 
cost rates and availability. Luggage handling and breakfast is not included on 
North American tour extensions.</p> 
<h6>Land Tour Only:</h6> 
<p>If you wish to make independent flight arrangements, you may still reserve 
the land portion of a tour. Hotel-airport transfers are subject to availability 
and flight details must be provided in writing at least 45 days prior to 
departure. See tour page for specific transfer times.</p> 
<h6>Airport Transfers:</h6> 
<p>Complimentary airport arrival and departure transfers are included in the 
tour price when you purchase our land/air package and operate at  xed times on 
the  rst and last day of your tour. See the individual tour pages for details. 
For those making their own flight arrangements or extending at GET hotels, 
transfers can be purchased; please call for details. London Heathrow Airport 
Arrivals: For tours commencing in London, we have included a free group shuttle 
to/from LHR for clients that have booked our combined land/air packages. For 
clients that have made their own flight arrangements GET has negotiated special 
rates for shuttle transfers from LHR to your London hotel (which must be booked 
through GET) at a price of $40 per person per single trip to/from LHR. London 
Gatwick Airport Arrivals: Clients arriving at LGW who have booked our combined 
land/air packages are provided with a Gatwick Express train voucher to Victoria 
Station, and will need to make their own way from Victoria Station to the tour 
hotel. For clients that have made their own flight arrangements we suggest you 
visit www.gatwickexpress. com for transfer information.</p> 
<h6>Smoking:</h6> 
<p>Please note that we do not permit smoking on our motorcoaches, however, 
frequent stops are made while touring.</p> 
<h6>Surface Travel &amp; Sightseeing:</h6> 
<p>Ground arrangements are provided by Grand European Operations Ltd., a 
separate company, and include inter-city travel by private motorcoach with 
air-conditioning and an emergency restroom*, ferry, train, and ship as per the 
itinerary. Activities on days indicated in the itinerary as being &ldquo;at 
leisure or optional&rdquo; are left to your discretion. *Some exceptions apply.
</p> 
<h6>Holidays:</h6> 
<p>During local or national holidays some museums, restaurants or sightseeing 
may be limited or not available. Alternatives will be o&Acirc;&#152; ered 
wherever possible. At times, some itineraries may be operated in reverse; you 
will be advised at the time of booking. Nile River Cruises: due to the 
unreliability of domestic air scheduling, religious festivals and other 
unforeseen circumstances, the order of some itineraries may need to change at 
short notice; on occasion an alternative cruise boat of equal standing may be 
used.</p> 
<h6>Hotels:</h6> 
<p>The hotels reserved for our tours are rated as European Standard First 
Class. All hotel rooms provide a private bath (and/or shower) and toilet. These 
hotels are clean, comfortable and located so as to best facilitate guided 
sightseeing of the area. Hotels reserved for each tour are indicated in the 
Day-By-Day Itinerary. If, for any reason, it becomes necessary to use other 
hotels, they will be of a similar standard, where possible. We only contract 
non-smoking rooms. All accommodations, meals and services have been designated 
as first class in Russia, Eastern Europe and provincial areas though some 
tourism facilities are less developed than what might normally be expected in 
this category. Tours in North and South America use Standard First Class hotels.
</p> 
<h6>Single Rooms:</h6>
