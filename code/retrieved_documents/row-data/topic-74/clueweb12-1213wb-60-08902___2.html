<p>The UK government is currently working on plans for a new rail line, called 
HS2, intended to connect London to Birmingham, Edinburgh, Liverpool and 
Glasgow. The overall cost for the lines and rolling stock is estimated at a 
staggering &pound;20.5 bn &ndash; &pound;34 bn. This is a huge sum considering 
the UK&rsquo;s current financial situation.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating to look at the case that&rsquo;s been put forward by 
Network Rail (see here) &ndash; you&rsquo;d expect a carefully researched, well 
argued case containing a clear investigation of many possible alternatives. In 
fact, it reads far more like a sales pitch by the people who want to build the 
line. This is rather disturbing.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s a interesting quote from page 5 (emphasis added):<br>
<br>
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>New routes would need to connect the major economic centres and provide 
journey times<strong>to rival air travel</strong> to make it viable.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>So, they&rsquo;re arguing that in order to compete with air travel, train 
travel has to compete on speed, and that this is the main defining factor. 
Let&rsquo;s be honest, a train is never going to beat a passenger jet in a 
race. Speed is only one factor. This reminds me ofRory Sutherland&rsquo;s TED 
presentation, in which he talks about the vast cost of improving the rail line 
that linked London to the Channel Tunnel:<br>
<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;The question was given to a bunch of engineers, about 15 years ago, 
&lsquo;How do we make the journey to Paris better?&rsquo; and they came up with 
a very good engineering solution, which was to spend six billion pounds 
building completely new tracks from London to the coast, and knocking about 40 
minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.<strong>Now, call me Mister 
Picky. I&rsquo;m just an ad man&hellip; But it strikes me as a slightly 
unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter.
</strong> Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion 
pounds on those railway tracks? Here is my naive advertising man&rsquo;s 
suggestion. What you should in fact do is employ all of the world&rsquo;s top 
male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing 
out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey. [...] Now, 
you&rsquo;ll still have about three billion pounds left in change, and people 
will ask for the trains to be slowed down!&rdquo; &ndash; Rory Sutherland</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Of course Rory&rsquo;s joking, but his main point is dead on. We&rsquo;d 
all love to rebuild the UK&rsquo;s aging rail network, but if we can&rsquo;t 
afford it right now, what else can we do to? We need to think more obliquely 
about ways to understand and solve the problem. Here&rsquo;s another quote from 
the Network Rail report (page 6):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;The analysis in the new lines study uses the latest government 
guidelines and modelling for calculating the benefits.<strong>It includes 
things like the value of the time saved by users</strong> [...]&raquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>It fascinates me that they think it&rsquo;s OK to assign a monetary value 
to time saved by travellers &ndash; but then provide no explanation, reference 
or link to their model. Besides, instead of trying to reduce<em>total travel 
time,</em> we should start thinking about how to reduce <em>dead time</em> 
(i.e. time when you are unable to do anything useful). Free, reliable, 
high-speed Wi-Fi, power points and table space would help a lot in this 
respect. And in terms of over-crowding &ndash; this is usually only a problem 
during peak hours. Why not incentivize travellers to use unpopular travel 
times? Airlines have aggressively used variable ticket prices to their 
advantage for years &ndash; why haven&rsquo;t UK train companies?</p> 
<p>To top it off, let&rsquo;s consider what kind of time-saving HS2 will give 
a journey from London to Birmingham. It currently takes 1 hour, 42 minutes to 
get to Birmingham. After HS2 is built, travellers will save just 35 minutes. Is 
it really worth it?</p> <br>

<p>The model that they would be using is called Generalised cost which does 
take into account the quality of time. One reason why buses score so badly is 
that waiting time at bus stops is penalized under the model.</p>

<p>Hi Harry,</p>
<p>I mostly agree an your point of view. It hardly makes sense to spend that 
much money (and let&rsquo;s be honest: the real costs will probably be much 
higher) just to shave of a few minutes. It is more the overall train experience 
that needs to be improved. Models and champaign&hellip; ok, that would 
definitly get me on a train</p>
<p>In Germany we had similar discussions about fast track trains connecting 
cities or cities with their airports. So far, it didn&rsquo;t go well for the 
trains&hellip; I assume it will be the same in the UK this time.</p>
<p>To make trains more competitive compared to airplanes, pricing and service 
are much likely a more effective way to tackle the declining passenger numbers. 
Free WIFI in stations and on trains, better seating organization in rush hours, 
less delays etc&hellip; All that would help a lot I believe.</p>
<p>Bye<br>

<p>You might have a point if speed was the justification, but its not &ndash; 
there is a need for capacity, and building a new line as a HSL makes the most 
economic sense. Expensive, yes, but the cost will be spread over more than a 
decade. By the time any great expenditure is needed the UK will be long out of 
recession.</p></li>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting problem that surfaces more often than one would 
like to admit. The problem should have been studied as a full policy analysis 
taking into account all other viable options, but in the HS2 case (as is this 
presentation), it was more done as a thing to tick off the list in order to 
justify the staggering expense.</p>
<p>Yes, the UK needs new investment into the rail lines, but putting in two 
new slow speed lines will give far higher capacity at a lower cost. As you say, 
speed isn&rsquo;t everything.</p>
<p>In fact when I travel to the UK from Holland, I choose the train whenever 
the tickets are exorbitant (biggest issue with trains) because I can do work on 
the journey. Does an hour here or there make a big difference to that decision? 
Not for me. I care that my time is useful on the train and pretty much wasted 
in air travel.</p></li>
