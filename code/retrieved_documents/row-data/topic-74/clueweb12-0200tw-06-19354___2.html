<h1>London 'second to Paris in best student cities'</h1> By Judith Burns

<p>London has come second, beaten only by Paris, in a ranking of the world's 
50 best cities for students.</p> 
<p>Researchers considered cities with populations of more than 250,000 and 
home to two or more top universities.</p> 
<p>They looked at affordability and quality of life as well as the number and 
reputation of universities.</p> 
<p>Ben Sowter, lead researcher on QS Best Student Cities, said that though 
London had more world class universities than Paris it was more expensive.</p> 
<p>London scored well on the quality and reputation of its universities, 
including Imperial College, University College London and King's College London.
</p> 
<p>The two cities did similarly well on quality of life, student mix and how 
well employers rated their universities as a source of good recruits.</p> 
<p>But fees - calculated in this survey as &pound;20,000 a year for 
international students from outside the European Union - meant that London lost 
out against Paris, where they are just &pound;1,000 a year.</p> 
<p>Mr Sowter said: &quot;While high tuition fees make London a far more 
expensive proposition than Paris, London's array of world-class universities 
means it is worth the investment for many student.&quot;</p> Burger prices 
<p>The ranking is primarily aimed at international students who are 
considering where to study.</p> 
<p>The research team considered nearly 500 cities, shortlisted just under 100 
and are publishing the top 50.</p> Continue reading the main story 
<h2>Top Ten Best Student Cities</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> 1. Paris, France</li> 
<li> 2. London, UK</li> 
<li> 3. Boston, US</li> 
<li> 4. Melbourne, Australia</li> 
<li> 5. Vienna, Austria</li> 
<li> 6. Sydney, Australia</li> 
<li> 7. Zurich, Switzerland</li> 
<li> 8. Berlin, Germany</li> 
<li> 9. Dublin, Ireland</li> 
<li> 10. Montreal, Canada</li> </ul> <br>

<p>They looked at indicators such as &quot;quality of life&quot;, which 
included measures of crime and the cost of living.</p> 
<p>They also looked at student mix which includes both the overall number of 
students and proportion from overseas.</p> 
<p>Measures of affordability included the cost of a burger and the amount 
charged for tuition.</p> 
<p>Mr Sowter explained; &quot;Neither Paris nor London are cheap cities but it 
was the cost of tuition fees in London that pushed London's rating down by 13 
points.&quot;</p> 
<p>Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students, said the ranking 
was a testament to the hard work of London's universities and students' unions 
to attract students from around the globe.</p> 
<p>But he warned: &quot;If London is to continue to be such an attractive 
place to study we need to see urgent action to address the spiralling cost of 
student living.</p> 
<p>&quot;It poses a real threat to the affordability of studying in the 
capital and therefore to the future sustainability of this world renowned 
status.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We should remember that studying in a big city is the right choice 
for some, but it's not for everyone.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are proud of our campuses across the UK in offering a range of 
learning and living environments for those not lured in by the bright 
lights.&quot;</p> 
<p>The fact that the ranking only looked at large centres of population meant 
that some of the UK's best known university cities were left out.</p> 
<p>But other UK cities scored well, with Manchester coming 35th, Birmingham 
47th and Glasgow 50th.</p>
