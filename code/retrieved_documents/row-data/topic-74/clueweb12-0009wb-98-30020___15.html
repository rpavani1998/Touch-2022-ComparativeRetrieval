 Customers' opinions  Finding the &quot;bare necessities&quot; like 
tea, sugar, coffee, soap and dish washing soap was great, especially for short 
stays - didn't have to go to look for the store to buy those. Great policy! 
Very cozy place, warm, clean and well-situated.  07/02/2012  Tatjana, Italy <br>

 L'appartamento &egrave; molto pulito, ben arredato e facile di 
accesso. L'arredamento provviene da Ikea quindi moderno.  27/01/2012  ROMAIN,

 stayed in&nbsp; Gladiator <br>
 Friendly staff at the office gave 
us a lot of useful instructions, we especially liked the location of the 
apartment which is in a nice and quiet italian quarter, still few minutes walk 
from Colosseum and Ancient Rome, and also downtown Rome is reachable in 15 
minutes walk so this apartment is a great choice. Well equipped and a good 
price for what you get. Definately recommend.  27/01/2012  Dalibor, Croatia <br>
 stayed in&nbsp;Colosseo I <br>
 Large size apartment, very spacious and clean. 
Good heating, and quiet building. Beds were comfortable and the fully equiped 
kitchen, including dishwasher and oven was great. Location was excellent, we 
could walk to most sights.  26/01/2012  Wendy, Australia <br>

Michelangelo Comfort <br>
 I liked the position of apt and the big size of 
bedrooms, really comfortable. We were 6 and I feared to have a bad surprise 
beeing first time renting an apt. But it was really ok!  25/01/2012  clotilde,

 stayed in&nbsp; Park View <br>
 Size of apartment was good, and 
ideal to have a washing machine.  24/01/2012  Steven, Australia <br>

 La posizione dell'appartamento &egrave; molto 
favorevole: davvero a due passi da San Pietro e dunque anche dalla 
metropolitana. Inoltre c'&egrave; un garage proprio sotto l'appartamento, dove 
abbiamo potuto lasciare l'auto per 2 giorni al prezzo di 30 euro. 
L'appartamento si presenta molto bene, con pareti e porte bianche: ha un'aria 
molto luminosa e pulita. E' anche pi&ugrave; grande di quanto immaginassi con 
stanze ampie e confortevoli. Gli arredamenti sono economici ma funzionali. 
L'abbiamo inoltre trovato pulito e ordinato al nostro arrivo. Non manca nulla: 
troverete lavatrice, frigo, cucina con forno, piatti, posate e pentole. Ci sono 
anche i detersivi per la pulizia. Insomma, andate sul sicuro.  12/01/2012

 L'appartement est bien plac&eacute;, le restaurant en

l'appartement est bruyant surtout cot&eacute; rue pour le lit du salon. Le

congelo.sinon nous avons passe un bon s&eacute;jour et utiliserons certainement 
de nouveau vos services une prochaine fois  05/01/2012  Pascal, France <br>

 Ninfeo is a pleasant apartment in a fantastic 
location making it very easy for a first time visitor to Rome to explore the 
delights of this amazing city. The check-in process was easy with friendly and 
very helpful service. The apartment was clean and everything worked, although 
to be honest, it could use some newer decoration, a few more pieces of 
furniture and an updated shower/bathroom. Nonetheless, we had a super time - 
thanks!  02/01/2012  Peter, United Kingdom <br>
 stayed in&nbsp; Ninfeo <br>
 
We were very much satisfied with the apartment and not to forget that it was in 
the center of Rome with the adress at Campo di Fiori.  01/01/2012  Flemming, 
Denmark<br>
 stayed in&nbsp; Campo di Fiori II <br>
 This apartment was 
spacious and nicely arranged. Six persons can leave there, considering that 2 
will be in the dining room. The location is very convenient to visit the 
historical part of the city.  28/12/2011  Severine, France <br>
 stayed in&nbsp;
Piazza Navona <br>
 The layout of the apartment was great. It was the first 
time I have been with my parents and siblings since I moved to Naples over a 
year ago, and it was great to all be in one place with a living room to relax 
in vice being spit up between separate hotel rooms. Cost of the room was great 
for the value The kitchen was also great to have. Overall a wonderful stay!

 Our ApartmentsApart stay was really great - a 
great mixture of value for the money, comfort, and convenience. We really 
appreciated having a warm and cozy place to return to after walking around 
chilly Rome!  26/12/2011  Christine, Egypt <br>

 Hello, we enjoyed very much our stay in Rome, largely thanks to 
our small apartment in Campo de' Fiori. The apartment's location was simply 
ideal. The apartment was quiet and cozy. I think we'll miss it. We hope to use 
it again in the future.  16/12/2011  Levi, Israel <br>
