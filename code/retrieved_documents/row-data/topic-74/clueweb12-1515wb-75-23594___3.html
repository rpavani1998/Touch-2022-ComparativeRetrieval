of life around her. A natural communicator, Sophie takes great pleasure in 
sharing her knowledge, experience, and love of photography with others. She

<h3>Hermione McCosh, Photographer</h3> 
<p>As a natural people person, Hermione thrives in interacting with 
photography enthusiasts on photo tours and in capturing the personality of 
visitors through portraiture. She studied photography at Leeds University and 
London College of Communication, and worked for a time with photographers John 
Swannell (in London) and Yves Gellie (in Paris). Originally from the Lake 
District of England, Hermione fell in love with Paris -- as many people do -- 
on her first visit and has lived here pretty much ever since. Hermione 
currently leads private and small group photo tours and delivers &lsquo;You in 
Paris&rsquo; portrait sessions.</p>

<h3>Elena Usacheva, Photographer</h3> 
<p>Elena can often be found wandering the streets of Paris with her favourite 
Leica camera capturing this city&rsquo;s magical scenery. She studied 
journalism in St. Petersburg University in Russia, and spent her early career 
as a journalist for a photography magazine and a photographer for an 
architecture magazine. In her portrait photography, Elena captures the 
relationship between individuals and their urban environment, and loves in 
particular to record the astonishment and pleasure of visitors as they discover 
the beauty of Paris. Her appetite for life and beauty makes her learning 
sessions unique moments that combine technical instruction with guidance on 
artistic vision. Elena conducts &lsquo;You in Paris&rsquo; portrait sessions

and has exhibited her work in art galleries in Canada. She enjoys passionate 
talks about photography and likes to help people discover new surroundings.

<h3>Louise Picard, Client Support</h3> 
<p>Canadian by birth, Louise has lived in Paris for several years. Working 
initially as the Community Coordinator at the Canadian Embassy allowed her to 
discover the many facets of life in Paris. When she is not indulging her 
passion for fashion by visiting the city&rsquo;s many vintage boutiques, she is 
out exploring its many parks and gardens to discover new places to practice 
&lsquo;walking meditation&rsquo;. At Better Paris Photos, Louise applies her 
zen like focus and resourcefulness in taking care of all our clients&rsquo; non 
photography-related needs, from registration through to post-activity follow up.
