<p>After a recent trip to two of the most historically influential cities, 
London and Paris, I thought it might be interesting to discuss the best of each.
</p> 
<p>Every trip is marked by what you experience, where you stay and who you are 
with on your journey. In our case, each of these elements were amazing. And 
thus, it was easy to fairly judge London and Paris, respectively.</p> 
<p><strong>Historical Influence: London or Paris</strong><br>
 When you think 
of the histories of both cities it is easy to argue that each of them have 
equal significance over the course of time. Each city has played a vital role 
in our world. However, London has been central command of one of the largest 
empires in the history of our world. Therefore, I would claim that London is 
much stronger in historical significance than Paris.</p> 
<p><strong>Current Influence: London or Paris</strong><br>
 When you think of 
current influence you must also think of the governments of each country, 
England and France, as well as the leaders of each country. While England 
continues to have a global influence, the current president of France, Sarkozy, 
is embarking on a new strategy of influence for the French. Thus, I would claim 
that it might be a wash between the two, with London being slightly ahead.</p> 
<p><strong>Best City to Visit: London or Paris</strong><br>
 When you consider 
food, people, sights and ambience, Paris wins hands down. While London boasts 
great theater and charming buildings amongst its history, Paris is much easier 
to visit and much more laid back.</p> 
<p><strong>Best Business City: London or Paris</strong><br>
 London is by far 
the better city for business. Not speaking English, nor tolerating it, truly 
hurts Paris&rsquo; impact on the business world. London is a prime city for 
global business.</p> 
<p><strong>Which one would I go back to next weekend?</strong><br>
 Hands down 
&ndash; Paris. While London wins most of the above topics, I would go back to 
Paris for its charm, food (crepes and pastries), and sights. It is an amazing 
city for rest and relaxation.</p> 
<p>Both cities are amazing. I recommend them both. It will be interesting to 
see the role each plays over the next 25 years.</p> <b>Share this post with
