<p>&ldquo;great location ideal for sight seeing&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel was directly in front of the 
Gare St Lazare and metro which made it easy to zip around paris. Can walk to 
many of the famous sights and shopping precincts from here. only thing to be 
wary of is the price of drinks at the hotel bar, but think that is going to be 
high anywhere in central paris. Definitely recommend!!</p> Christine from 
Southampton<br>

<p>&ldquo;Looking foward to going back&rdquo;</p> 
<p>My first time in Paris which was great can't wait to go back, the hotel was 
better than we expected it. Found a cafe opposite where we had breakfast as the 
hotel was too expensive.</p> Creagh from London <br>

<p>&ldquo;As Advertised&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The hotel was essentially 'as advertised'. The reception area is as lovely 
as the pictures indicate, the booking was all in order, the staff were friendly 
and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable. The only negative was that 
it was supposed to be a double room but the bed was infact two (large) single 
beds pushed together but were, nonetheless, quite comfortable. The hotel is 
also in quite a central location with sites easily walkable in all directions 
and a metro station right outside and RER (train) station just up the road for 
easy connection to the airport and other RER/metro stations.</p> helen from

<p>&ldquo;Very Impressed&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I took my nephew who was visiting me from Auz just after Christmas for 4 
days, found an amazing deal on Expedia. As soon as we walked into the foyer my 
nephew was amazed at how luxurious it was and I was very pleased that it met my 
expectations. The reception staff were excellent and very helpful, the hotel 
was clean and the rooms were spotless and beds very comfy. I paid extra and had 
a superior room and felt it was very well worth the extra money, we only had 
breakfast on the last day as we found it a bit pricey, but the choice was again 
excellent. Would recommend this hotel, and would definitely use it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All was as expected&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The hotel was ideal for travelling on the Metro and RER, and was central 
for shopping and restaurants. We would certainly use this hotel again.</p> Costa

<p>&ldquo;A warm, welcoming, and friendly hotel.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>We stayed at this hotel early November 2008 on the recommendation of a 
friend. I'm pleased we took his advice. Conveniently located close to a Metro 
and mainline station - but without the noise and hassle this sometimes brings - 
it was an ideal location to base ourselves for four days sightseeing. The 
Roissy airport bus terminal is six minutes walk, or two short stops on the 
Metro away. Whilst the hotel restaurant and bar are excellent, there are 
numerous bars/brasseries/restaurants close by serving a variety of food types. 
Accomodation was clean if cosy, sevice excellent, with a very helpful 
Concierge. We will stay here again on our next visit.</p> Paul from Cardiff <br>

<p>&ldquo;Good choice&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The hotel St Lazare is in an excellent, central location. The standard room 
(called superior) was a reasonable size for central Paris, and the staff 
friendly and helpful.</p> Morag from Cheshire, UK <br>
 4.0  out of 5 
<p>&ldquo;Fitted the bill perfectly!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>My daughter and I wanted a central hotel in Paris, close to the department 
stores and the main galleries. The Concorde St. Lazare was ideally placed and 
easy to find. I took the Roissybus from CDG airport staight to Opera and could 
easily walk from the stop to the hotel. We were given a room at the back 
deliberately as the man at reception said it would be quieter due to building 
works near the hotel. It was a quiet room, a decent size, with a modern and 
bright bathroom. Only complaint was the lack of tea, coffee and milk items - 
even when requesting them from the service staff they didn't materialise. Apart 
from this, the front staff were helpful and friendly. Didn't eat breakfast in 
the hotel - it was far too expensive, we just found somewhere nearby.</p> <br>
