<h2>Paris, My Sweet: Amy Thomas&rsquo;s Drool-Inducing New Book On Paris and 
New York&rsquo;s Best Desserts</h2> 
<p>February 16, 2012 &nbsp;by Tory Hoen</p> 
<h6><em>Lindsey Tramuta</em></h6> 
<p>Here at HiP, we&rsquo;re always up for a good expat adventure tale, 
particularly one in which desserts play a starring role. In her new book,<em>
Paris, My Sweet,</em> food writer (and regular HiP Paris contributor!) Amy 
Thomas regales us with stories from her two-year stint in Paris, where she 
wrote advertising copy for Louis Vuitton by day and scoured the city for sweets 
in her spare time.</p> 
<p>All in all, it sounds like a pretty ideal existence, but like all expats in 
Paris, Amy faced a typical series of ups and downs. It&rsquo;s no surprise that 
she fell hard for the city upon arrival; and it&rsquo;s also no surprise that, 
once the initial Parisian shine wore off, Amy ultimately came to see the 
city&rsquo;s not-quite-so-sweet side. It&rsquo;s at this point that the story 
really starts to ring true for those of us who have been expats in Paris: 
you&rsquo;re simultaneously charmed and alienated, comforted and challenged, 
energized and exhausted.</p> 
<h6><em> </em><em>Paris, My Sweet; Takashi</em></h6> 
<p>As Amy weathered the highs and lows of expat life, she also covered serious 
ground in the dessert department, hitting all of Paris&rsquo; confectionary 
hotspots and sampling the city&rsquo;s most decadent delights. This book is not 
only an account of her time in Paris, but also a goldmine of<em>bonnes addresses
</em> (in both Paris and New York) for dessert lovers. This woman knows her way 
around a<em>p&acirc;tisserie</em>, and serious sugar-high seekers would do well 
to heed Amy&rsquo;s recommendations.</p> 
<p><em>Paris, My Sweet </em>is a guidebook of sorts, but it&rsquo;s also just 
a fun and decadent read&mdash;I devoured it in less than 48 hours, pausing only 
to scrounge up some chocolate now and again. In addition to making me hungry, 
Amy&rsquo;s writing transported me back to Paris, a trip I am ever-eager to 
make, if only vicariously.</p> 
<h6><em>Evocateur</em><em> </em></h6> 
<p>Below, I caught up with the author to talk Paris, pastries, and ultimately 
picking her favorite city.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>

<h2>Kid-Friendly Travel: An American Family Visits the City of Lights</h2> 
<p>February 13, 2012 &nbsp;by Michelle Lehnardt</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>After half a day in the airport, a canceled flight and a sleepless passage 
over the ocean, I expected my children to nap away our first day in the City of 
Lights. But the magic of Paris revived us and it was 11 p.m., admiring the fire 
dancers at Le Sacre Coeur when my son said, &ldquo;Mom, can I get an &lsquo;I 
love Paris&rsquo; t-shirt? &lsquo;Cause I really love Paris.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A dream destination for every traveler, Paris is rarely considered a haven 
for families. I&rsquo;d like to challenge that assumption. The first concern is 
usually cost. While not cheap, Parisian retreats are about the same price as a 
trip to Disney World. Most people think Disney World is a reasonable goal, but 
why visit Epcot when you can indulge in the real locale?</p> 
<p>Deals on flights are everywhere; all museums in France are free for those 
18 and under; public transportation is inexpensive and most importantly, an 
apartment rental saves a fortune over hotel accommodations.</p> 
<p>Ahem, this is the moment I need to make a disclaimer that Haven in Paris 
isn&rsquo;t compensating me in any way. I begged them to let me write about our 
incredible experience with HIP.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My family spent a marvelous week in HIP&rsquo;s gorgeous Champs 
Elys&eacute;es; everything from the darling girl who met us at the apartment to 
the plush bedding, was perfect. We gazed at the Arc de Triomphe from our window 
and the Metro stop was literally right outside the front door. The location 
made transportation easy and delightful. Adults might find subways tedious, but 
for kids riding the Metro is part of the adventure. My boys loved navigating 
the family throughout the city and the 5-day Visite pass is a steal.Continue

<h2>Planning A Wedding in France: Saying &ldquo;I Do&rdquo; In A French Chateau
</h2> 
<p>February 10, 2012 &nbsp;by Paige Bradley Frost</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been offered a job in Paris,&rdquo; my boyfriend of 
one year announced. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even consider it if you&rsquo;re going 
to rule out coming with me&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Huh? Definitely an invitation, not quite a proposal. So what&rsquo;s a 
young, gainfully employed, woman-in-love to do?</p> 
<p>Quit her job, pack her bags and move to Paris, of course!</p> 
<p>Fast forward six months. Newly engaged and living in the Marais, we spend 
weekends scouring flea markets for second-hand furniture and sipping cheap red 
wine on our sixth-floor terrace. It&rsquo;s great. But with Greg off at work 
and a scant hour of French per week on my calendar, it quickly becomes clear: I 
need a project.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I decide to get serious about planning our wedding.</p> 
<p><em>Le chateau</em>: I spot the photo in the back of a French bridal 
magazine;<em>Chateau des Conde</em>, in the village of Vallery about 90 minutes 
south of Paris. We call ahead and arrange to visit. The village is French 
country perfection: a sleepy town center with a church,<em>boulangerie</em>, 
one restaurant, a bar/tabac and a post office. Summer vines climb stone walls 
and window boxes spill with blooms. We haven&rsquo;t even laid eyes on the 
chateau yet but I&rsquo;m already falling hard.</p> 
<p>Chateau owner, architect Patrice Vansteenberghe, welcomes us with champagne 
that we sip as we tour the grounds. The chateau dates back to the 12th century, 
boasts 22 rooms to host our future guests and a reception salon designed by the 
architect responsible for the<em>Cour Carree</em> at the Louvre. By the time we 
see the room where Lenny Kravitz and Vanessa Paradis holed up for a month 
scribbling lyrics, we&rsquo;re more than ready to let love rule (and hand over 
the hefty deposit). After several more glasses of champagne, dinner with 
Patrice&rsquo;s chic weekend guests, and an impromptu overnight in the Kravitz 
suite, visions of a wedding bash are dancing in my head.Continue

<h2>Expat Special: What To Do With One Month in Paris</h2> 
<p>January 30, 2012 &nbsp;by Nicole Gustin</p> 
<h6><em>Piyapat Ch</em></h6> 
<p>You&rsquo;re about to realize your dream: living in Paris for a month. You 
found an apartment, booked your flight, and learned how to ask for<em>les 
toilettes.</em></p> 
<p>You imagine strolling through the city, taking in the sights, hanging out 
at caf&eacute;s, and being&hellip;Parisian.&nbsp; Of course, part of the fun of 
travel is making new friends. As much as we love French hospitality, local 
Parisians and expats aren&rsquo;t always hanging out in caf&eacute;s looking 
for tourists to befriend. If your plan was to strike up conversation with the 
local artists over espresso at your neighborhood bistrot, you might want to 
think up a slightly more elaborate back-up plan. Just in case.</p> 
<h6><em>Michel NGUYEN; Yuwen Teo</em></h6> 
<p>Plus, maybe your idea of Paris includes escaping the tourist traps and 
discovering truly local haunts &ndash; great live music at an otherwise 
unassuming dive bar, or a fantastic meal at your neighborhood restaurant. With 
a dash of creativity, there are plenty of original ways to meet people and 
experience a little of the true Paris. Here are a few ideas:Continue

<h2>Christmas in the City of Lights: Seeking Out Paris&rsquo; Holiday Cheer
</h2> 
<p>December 15, 2011 &nbsp;by Victoria Wall</p> 
<h6><em>Mic Mac</em></h6> 
<p>When I popped home to the UK in November, London was already in full 
festive swing with Christmas trees, festive songs and neon lights galore. Sent 
back with a Cadbury&rsquo;s chocolate advent calendar adorned with an oversized 
Santa, I was ready to start the Christmas season with a bang.</p> 
<h6><em>Making Magique</em></h6> 
<p>Yet once back home across the pond, I realized Paris hadn&rsquo;t joined in 
on the fun yet. I was ready to start in on my advent calendar and temperatures 
were plunging, but where were all those tell tale signs that our favorite 
mid-winter festival was fast approaching?</p> 
<p>This set me thinking. What exactly is a Parisian Christmas? What happens in 
the cold windy days leading up to the big event? I set out on a mission to 
discover the seasonal delights that France&rsquo;s most romantic city had to 
offer.</p> 
<h6><em>Little Brown Pen</em></h6> 
<p><strong>Shopping</strong></p> 
<p>Although the Christmas shopping frenzy begins relatively late in Paris 
(thankfully, shops only step into gear at the end of November), once it gets 
going, it really gets going. Stores go all out with light shows and 
designer-crafted window displays &ndash; always tasteful,<em>bien sur</em>. 
First stop? Paris&rsquo;s iconic department stores. Whilst London has 
toy-filled Hamleys and elegant Harrods, Paris showcases its trademark 
sophistication with Les Galleries Lafayette and the neighbouring Printemps, 
where Karl Lagerfeld&rsquo;s touch marks this year&rsquo;s displays: think 
Chanel-clad rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll dolls strumming their electric guitars 
and 20m Christmas trees.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>

<h2>A Day in London: Amy&rsquo;s Perfect One-Day Itinerary</h2> 
<p>December 9, 2011 &nbsp;by Amy Thomas</p> 
<p><em> Amy Thomas loves London, and so do we. &nbsp;In fact, we adore it so 
much we just launched our very first London vacation apartment, a gorgeous 
2-bedroom rental in the heart of Chelsea. &nbsp;</em><em>If you&rsquo;d like to 
do London in more than a day, and enjoy afternoon tea or cocktails in your very 
own central London flat, let us help you&nbsp;plan your trip. </em>Thanks Amy 
for this wonderfully ambitious London itinerary.</p> 
<p><em>The daily menu at&nbsp;Lantana</em></p> 
<p>From Gare du Nord to St Pancras in just over two hours? Do you really need 
another reason to hop on the 8:13 Eurostar and spend the day in London?<em>
Vite, mes amis!&nbsp;Allez &agrave; Londres!</em></p> 
<h6><em>Where the delicious flat whites at&nbsp;Lantana are made</em></h6> 
<p>The key to tackling the jolly old British capital in just a day is to focus 
on a select few neighborhoods&mdash;and fuel up on caffeine immediately after 
arriving. Both can be accomplished atLantana in Fitzrovia, a relatively quick 
walk west of the San Pancras train station. The toasted banana bread with 
blueberry butter is divine and a &ldquo;flat white,&rdquo; more delicious than 
the best<em>caf&eacute; cr&egrave;me</em>, will put a spring in your step all 
day.</p> 
<h6><em>Gorgeous furniture by&nbsp;Designer&rsquo;s Guild</em></h6> 
<p>Once caf&rsquo;ed up, head to nearby Marylebone, where the shopping is as 
spectacular as the architecture. A stroll down Marylebone High Street will 
reveal everything from colorful home accessories at Designers Guild&nbsp;and 
Emma Bridgewater to beauty supplies at Space NK and Boots.Continue

<h2>Photographing Paris: Tips from a Travel Photographer</h2> 
<p>November 18, 2011 &nbsp;by Marisa Williams</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>You&rsquo;d think that as a travel photographer who&rsquo;s endlessly 
enamored of Paris, finding infinite inspiration for things to shoot in the City 
of Light would be proverbial cake. Well, you&rsquo;d be wrong. At least where 
this Francophile photog is concerned!</p> 
<p>My problem with Paris (and what a wonderful challenge to have) is that 
after so many visits, what was once a mysterious new wonderland to discover and 
dissect through the lens is now a favorite, intimately familiar old haunt. So 
when I found myself &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in Paris for two weeks last spring per 
that little volcanic kerfuffle in Iceland instead of down south in new-to-me 
Nice, I was actually un peu perturbed.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>After settling into the reality that I&rsquo;d be in Paris awhile &mdash; 
and potentially a really long while if that blasted Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull 
didn&rsquo;t pipe down already, I finally began to relax and reflect on how 
best to start a fresh relationship with this city I had captured through my 
lens so many times before. In the end, I don&rsquo;t know what I was so worried 
about! With a few simple adjustments to my habitual Paris routines, seeing the 
city anew was easy.</p> 
<p><strong>Even though you&rsquo;re not in Venice, go ahead and get lost.
</strong></p> 
<p>Armed with my trusty copy of Michelin&rsquo;s Paris par Arrondissement, I 
wandered sans worry. One of the most important things I learned was to take the 
time to explore and absorb at a leisurely clip &ndash; day or night. Rather 
than defaulting to the subway, the bus became my primary mode of public 
transportation. Better to survey large, unfamiliar chunks of the city that way, 
and scout new nooks and crannies to tackle &agrave; pied. Similarly, if I did 
ride the metro, I used it to reach pockets of Paris that I&rsquo;d never seen 
or strolled before. It was fantastique.</p> 
<p><strong>Get up early, or stay out late.</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As on any trip, I set my alarm to rise and shine before the sun and the 
city. I love doing this and particularly in a place like Paris, both for the 
dreamy photo opps and for the priceless experience of watching timeless 
cityscapes come to life. Plus it&rsquo;s just about the only way you&rsquo;re 
going to score some private time with landmarks like La Tour Eiffel. Unless 
you&rsquo;re willing to stay out way after dark, which isn&rsquo;t really my 
thing, but man &mdash; talk about interesting photo opportunities.Continue

<h2>Buying In Nice: Negotiating Real Estate A La Ni&ccedil;oise</h2> 
<p>October 12, 2011 &nbsp;by Adrian Leeds</p> 
<p><em>Navigating the real estate scene in France can be tricky &mdash; even 
more so when you are unfamiliar with the labyrinthine bureaucracy and unusual 
quirks the French can be known for.&nbsp;Adrian Leeds, who specializes in 
helping Americans negotiate the market to secure their dream 
pied-&agrave;-terres in France,&nbsp; just recently ventured into the market in 
Nice. She shares a few anecdotes&nbsp; from her colorful experiences here. 
-Genevi&egrave;ve</em></p> 
<h6><em>The beach in Nice:&nbsp;Marisa Williams</em></h6> 
<p>Years ago I set my eye on the goal of purchasing a 
&ldquo;pied-&agrave;-terre&rdquo; in Nice for a long list of reasons:</p> 
<p>1. Nice is nice. Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;s the Riviera, the 
C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Azur, the land of the rich and famous with the blue 
Mediterranean Sea, balmy weather, palm trees and Italian flavor. What could be 
so bad?</p> 
<p>2. Property in Nice and its environs is increasing in value on a steady 
basis. With an international airport and an active port, the blue coast is 
France&rsquo;s second hotspot after Paris. This makes Nice, and just about all 
of the coast, an excellent real estate investment.</p> 
<h6><em>Nice -&nbsp;Marisa Williams</em></h6> 
<p>3. R and R&hellip;the moment one lands at Nice&rsquo;s contemporary and 
easy airport, and you head toward Nice down the Promenade des Anglais under the 
swaying palms with the sea at your side, the stress just melts away. Traveling 
to Nice from Paris is fast and inexpensive, making weekend getaways about as 
easy as it gets &mdash; a perfect antidote to the cold, gray, rainy winters in 
Paris.</p> 
<p>4. Rental potential of vacation apartments, particularly for the North 
American market, is ripe for business. While the British and Italians are well 
served by their own compatriots, Americans have been overlooked. Americans want 
and expect a higher standard of luxury and service than their European 
counterparts know how to provide. From a business perspective, Nice was looking 
awfully nice.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>

<h2>Ladur&eacute;e: Parisian Macarons Land In New York</h2> 
<p>October 6, 2011 &nbsp;by Amy Thomas</p> 
<h6><em>Ladur&eacute;e macarons in their sleek box (Louis Beche)</em></h6> 
<p>For years, everyone&mdash;especially New Yorkers&mdash;has been clamoring 
for the death of the cupcakes. Let those pastel-colored, frosting-slathered, 
sprinkled-adorned, oh-so-cute sugar bombs be over! Can we puh-leeze move on?? 
And it would appear, with Ladur&eacute;e&rsquo;s arrival on Madison Avenue, New 
Yorkers may finally get their wish: the macaron could soon trump the cupcake as 
the sweet<em>du jour</em>.</p> 
<h6><em>Ladur&eacute;e&rsquo;s new NYC store, and its line of fans (Amy Thomas)
</em></h6> 
<p>Of course Parisians are well acquainted with Ladur&eacute;e, the 
149-year-old<em>salon de th&eacute;</em> that purportedly invented the macaron. 
But with the exception of savvy New Yorkers who used to raid the 
Champs-Elys&eacute;es store for a box of Technicolor two-bite treats, and then 
proudly parade their pale green shopping bags around the Upper East Side, the 
French brand has remained an exotic import to New Yorkers. Which explains the 
two-hour queues.</p> 
<h6><em>Ladur&eacute;e macarons (Yuichi Sakuraba)</em></h6> 
<p>To be fair, by the time I made it to Ladur&eacute;e, three weeks after it 
opened, the line was down to a 15-minute wait. As if I were a macaron virgin, 
the dauntless teenager in front of me who had previously waited hours for a 
Ladur&eacute;e hit, told me the sweets &ldquo;were totally worth the 
wait.&rdquo;Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>
