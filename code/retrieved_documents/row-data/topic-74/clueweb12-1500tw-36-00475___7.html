<p>My publisher tells us that our new Pocket Guides to London, Paris, and Rome 
are doing great -- not cannibalizing sales of our full-size guidebooks to those 
cities but getting in on the thriving market for smaller, more colorful, and 
more portable &quot;best of&quot; and &quot;top ten&quot; guidebooks. To 
celebrate their success, here's a fun Q&amp;A for people anticipating trips to 
my three favorite big cities in Europe:<br>
<br>
<strong>Best photo op in each 
city?</strong><br>
<strong>Rome:</strong> The old ladies on their folding 
chairs as they hang out in the Jewish Quarter; rays of sunlight cutting through 
St. Peter's Basilica; the scene on Via del Corso in the early evening when it's 
closed to traffic, and the community is out for the passeggiata.<br>
<strong>
Paris:</strong> The city from top of Montparnasse Tower (you don't have to look 
at the Montparnasse Tower); the neighborhood action on a street like rue 
Montorgueil; the honey-colored tones of freshly baked bread and pastries at 
just about any corner bakery.<br>
<strong>London:</strong> Different angles on 
the Millennium Bridge; the pageantry during the Changing of the Guard at 
Buckingham Palace; Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament from the top of the 
London Eye.</p> 
<p><strong>Best free yet enriching experience in each town?</strong><br>

<strong>Rome:</strong> Going to a late Mass at St. Peter's Basilica (most days 
at 5 p.m.); being all alone in the Pantheon very early or very late; exploring 
the back streets of Trastevere.<br>
<strong>Paris:</strong> Being in the organ 
loft at St. Sulpice Church as Daniel Roth plays a short concert between Masses 
on Sunday; sitting on the steps of Sacr&eacute;-C&oelig;ur in Montmartre as 
darkness settles on the City of Light.<br>
<strong>London:</strong> Enjoying 
the many wonderful and free galleries and museums -- especially the British 
Museum and the British Library; taking in Speakers' Corner at Hyde Park on 
Sunday; viewing the legal action in the Old Bailey courtrooms.</p> 
<p><strong>Favorite single museum and why in each town?</strong><br>
<strong>
Rome:</strong> The Borghese Gallery -- It must be the most sumptuous palace in 
Italy even without its many Bernini masterpieces, including my favorite statue 
anywhere, Apollo and Daphne.<br>
<strong>Paris: </strong>The Louvre -- It shows 
off the greatest collection of art in Europe in what was its biggest palace.<br>
<strong>London:</strong> The British Museum -- It's the chronicle of our 
Western civilization.</p> 
<p><strong>What guilty pleasure do you indulge in each city?</strong><br>

<strong>Rome:</strong> Staying in the decadent Hotel Nazionale and dining at my 
favorite restaurant, Il Gabriello.<br>
<strong>Paris:</strong> Pigging out on 
macarons at Ladur&eacute;e on the Champs-Elysees.<br>
<strong>London:</strong> 
Riding in the big black taxis just to talk with the cabbies; wandering through 
the parks, browsing from obscure monument to obscure monument, while people 
watching.</p> 
<p><strong>Biggest mistake time-strapped travelers make in each city, and how 
to avoid it?</strong><br>
<strong>Rome:</strong> Going to sights like St. 
Peter's and the Colosseum when there is a long line. Rather than waiting an 
hour to get in, you can be all alone at the greatest church in Christendom if 
you simply go early or late. And the line for the Colosseum is actually a line 
to buy a ticket, which is a combo-ticket that includes the neighboring Palatine 
Hill. Simply pick up your ticket at the Palatine Hill entrance a short walk 
away, and stroll right past the long line waiting for tickets at the Colosseum.
<br> <strong>Paris:</strong> Waiting in long lines for the Louvre, Orsay 
Museum, Sainte-Chapelle, and Versailles. All can be avoided simply by 
purchasing the Paris Museum Pass (sold at any city museum).<br>
<strong>London:
</strong> Going to a play when you're suffering from jet lag--that's one 
expensive nap. That's why, if I'm touring England, I go from the airport 
directly to Bath (a relaxing, smaller town) to get over jet lag. I finish my 
tour in London when I'm fully adjusted to local time. And that way, nothing 
will be anticlimactic since I end up in exciting London. It's the best finale 
for a trip around Britain.</p>

<br>
 
simply going early to St Peter's, as Steves blithely implies, will not exempt 
you from the long lines. We were there at least an hour before they started 
admitting people and the line was already a couple of hours wait. We managed to 
jump it by signing on with a private tour, which made us a little nervous about 
getting scammed, but turned out to be a very good idea. The guide was great and 
the price was reasonable.  cenourinha: &quot;Going to sights like St. Peter's

09:27 PM on 04/11/2012 Rick: love your stuff. In Paris, as you had warned, a 
scam played out in tourist areas involves a &quot;native&quot; finding a gold 
ring and asking if it is yours or if you wish to buy it at a bargain price; we 
encountered a young good looking blond trying this on us twice. We 
congratulated her on her luck and encouraged her to enjoy her find. Barcelona, 
you warned, is the pickpocket capital of the world. Lo and Behold, just as we 
were about to enter the metro train, grandma jumped in front of me and suddenly 
stopped while her two assistants tried to open my rear pockets. Sensing the 
purpose of grandma's sudden stop, I gave her a shove and stepped up into the 
car. Barcelonians already seated were familiar with the action and asked if 
&quot;they&quot; got anything. Nada, but if they had, it would have been a 
wallet full of used plastic library and telephone cards. Next AM at breakfast, 
the couple seated next to us from Vancouver, BC., have Rick's Spain Guidebook 
on the table. Watch out for pickpockets, I suggest. Oh, they got us in Madrid 
as we were getting into the metro car, the man said. I carry a wallet full of 
worthless stuff, I said. He:so do I, and as grandma walked away with mine in 
hand, she recognized that she had been fooled, and turned and tapped me on the 
shoulder and handed me back my decoy wallet.  viewfromsnohomish: Rick: love 
your stuff. In Paris, as you had warned,<br>

PM on 04/11/2012 We used your travel books to tour Italy and France. Thanks, 
they were a great help. However, please stress more about what appear to be 
ticket traps for the tourists driving in Italy and especially those restricted 
zones. I had read that they were in Rome but was totally surprised to find them 
in other cities such as Siena, Pisa, etc. This is a serious matter for any new 
traveler who plans on driving in Italy.  thinkermom: We used your travel books

 You're missing some important tips.<br>
(1) In Paris and Rome (well, France, 
Spain and Italy) bathrooms are RARE, and they generally cost money to use 
(about 1/2 euro). In Italy they often lack toilet seats. Plan accordingly.<br>

(2) Everything is much more expensive near a tourist site. Especially water. 
It's easy to get dehydrated on a trip. Look for small grocers to spend 1/6 the 
amount on bottled water. France, Spain and Italy are bereft of drinking 
fountains. There is no free water.<br>
(3) If you like coffee as soon as you 
get up, bring your own. Many places will NOT serve you coffee until they feel 
like it (especially when you are jet lagged and wake up at 5:00 AM)<br>
(4) 
When you buy trinkets, never offer a street vendor more than 50% of what he's 
asking, always walk away, they will cut the price. Their mark up on junk is 
around 500%  MarcEdward: You're missing some important tips.&lt;br&gt;(1) In

12:42 PM on 04/11/2012 You're totally wrong about free water in Rome. They have 
those spouts dating back to ancient days where you can dip your bottle and fill 
up. That's what I did. They're called nasoni and the water comes from mountain 
streams.  LouC: You're totally wrong about free water in Rome. They have <br>

<br>  01:29 PM on 04/11/2012  Rick Steves isn't going to give out all his tips 
as he has books to sell. Many tips can be found online without guide, but then 
yuo have to compile them yourself. Not that I hate the guy or anything, used a 
couple of his books when I went backpacking across Europe, gosh, over 10 years 
ago. Good stuff.  WishfulThinkingRulesAll: Rick Steves isn't going to give out 
all his tips<br>

AM on 04/11/2012 I've only been to Rome and London so far. So many of the sites 
you spoke about bring back wonderful visions dancing in my head. The British 
Museum is, by far, the best place to wander around for hours.  manelady: I've

 10:26 AM on 04/11/2012  Having just been to Paris, he 
is wrong about the Museum Pass, as it relates to Sainte Chapelle, and 
Versailles.<br>
<br>
 For Ste. Chapelle the longest line is the security 
checkpoint into the Palais de Justice, and there is no priority.<br>
<br>
 For 
Versailles, there is no priority at all. What one needs to do, for speedy 
entrance to Versailles is leave the train with haste, and beat the people who 
are getting in the line.<br>
<br>
 I would also recommend, esp. as the high 
season has started, getting there early, to enjoy the gardens, and then going 
to the palace, latter in the day, when the crowds have died down. One can enter 
the gardens from the back, which will also allow one to see the Trianon.
