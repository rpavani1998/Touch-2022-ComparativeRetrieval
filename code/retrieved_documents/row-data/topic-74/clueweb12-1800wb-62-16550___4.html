<p>Went to cafe de paris with my boyfriend on our first night in london, at 
first I was a bit apprehensive because Id never been out in london before, but 
a very good looking bouncer approached us outside the club and actually invited 
us in. So on the way in he ushered us past the queue of people ( who looked 
angry because they had to queue) and went inside. Loved the decor and the 
atmosphere, drinks a bit expensive but had a good night. Men that work there 
were full of compliments towards me ( which made my bf jealous lol) and rest of 
staff were fine!</p> <br>

<p>Went here last night with 2 male friends had a great night. Had no problem 
getting in as we had put ourself on the guest list prior to going. Lots of very 
good looking females and the bar staff were great. Highly recommend this club 
for a great time and no attitude night!</p> <br>

<p>I really enjoyed Cafe de Paris, it had all of the right ingredients. 
Proffessional staff, and not too many protentious people. I thought the prices 
were about average for a West End club, however I did find the V.I.P area a 
little crowded.</p> <br>

<p>Still a great venue. With so much choice in central London now, we thought 
we'd try Cafe de Paris after not going for sometime. The crowd is a better mix 
now and the atmosphere was excellent. Musically , along with big tunes at the 
moment, there was quality funky and electro house with a sprinkle of RnB so 
fantastic. We won't leave it so long next time!!!</p> <br>

<p>I had a very exciting evening in Cafe de Paris! My friend was performing 
his football tricks (Daniel Magnus) and the crowd loved him and there was such 
a good atmosphere! We were treated to our own table and the staff were very 
friendly! Hope he gets to perform there again soon! Great Music too!</p> <br>

<p>I really enjoy cafe de paris, i've been a few times and love the place, it 
gets a little over crowded sometimes with rude looking guys. Drinks are as 
expected of this area. Lighting is brilliant, sound is cool but would love to 
hear a little more funkier house tunes, was not too keen on the oldies!! Door 
man great and on a whole the night was a brillaint nightx</p> <br>

<p>Cafe de Paris is a great cheap thrill; it's not worth the entrance fee but 
it's an okkk place to go to if it's your second choice and your first hasn't 
let you in (yess it happened), i was told it would be the next best place down 
from CC - i strongly disagree but that's what you get for listening to a 
promoter! Fun times all in all!</p> <br>

<p>Not a bad place, but as mentioned, if you get there too early then expect 
to hear the same songs a couple of times. The podium dancers are great and the 
lighting is quite cool. The major let downs are the drinks prices (normal for 
leicester sq though) and some of the people that get in- too many 
&quot;gangsters&quot; for somewhere that wants to appear classy; who lets 
people wearing white trainers into a club? &pound;15 entry cost on Saturday 
nights- its probably only worth &pound;10.</p> <br>

<p>I went to Cafe de Paris for the third time last night, and my mates and i 
ended up going there because we always get VIP and it is only &pound;10 to get 
in. But the first 2 times were a lot better. There were too many people, and it 
was completly crowded, the DJ must have played every song more than two times, 
VIP had far too many people in there, an it is only small so it was sooo hot. i 
ended up not going in VIP at all as it was rubbish. also, my friend bought two 
doubles and coke, and it came to &pound;18. What a bump. and the men there were 
horrible.</p> <br>

<p>It&#146;s such a shame with the history of this place that it attracts such 
an awful clientele (but then it is just a stone's throw from Leicester Square). 
The Cafe suffers from having a clientele that has probably got a minibus from 
Southend for 'Tracey&#146;s Hen Night&#146;. My lasting memory will be when I 
asked for a drink and the barman replied &quot;You get F all unless you say 
please&quot;. I think that comment sums the establishment up. You get a feeling 
that you should be honoured to be there; but you&#146;re surrounded by 21 year 
old students! The food is actually really good, but again spoilt by such awful 
staff that seem to have an over inflated opinion of their own self importance. 
You just want to whisper in their ear: 'You just work in a nightclub darling, 
cut the attitude'.</p> <br>
