<p>Curious about travel with ACIS? Find out answers to your burning questions 
below.</p> 
<h3>For Group Leaders and Teachers:</h3> see all FAQs Can I bring my family 
members or colleagues along? 
<p>Certainly. You have three different options:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assistants<br>
 Family members or 
colleagues may travel as assistants (even if minors, though children must be 
five years or older to travel in an ACIS group), according to the terms of the 
Group Leader Stipend Chart.* Assistants must be 21 years old and have at least 
five participants to their name to be eligible for the Experience Bonus.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Family/Colleague Discount<br>
 Family 
members or colleagues may take a 20% discount from the program fee. These 
participants will not count toward your free trip, stipend or other group 
leader benefits. Like all paying participants, they are subject to mandatory 
fees (registration, tax, etc.) as well as full payment deadlines.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $150 Child Discount<br>
 For children 
under the age of 12, you may take a flat $150 Child Discount (plus the 20% 
Family/Colleague Discount) off their program fee, but they will still be 
subject to mandatory fees. The child's registration will not count toward your 
free trip, stipend or other group leader benefits. The minimum age to travel 
with an ACIS group is five years old.</p> 
<p>*Anyone can become an assistant to the group, provided they have at least 
one full-paying participant to their credit.</p> <br>
Can a paying participant 
become an assistant? 
<p>Yes. This must be done no later than 65 days before departure and an ACIS 
Assistant Registration Form must be submitted. Assistants added or canceled 
within 90 days of departure will be charged a $100 late fee payable either by 
the applicable assistant or the group leader. Please inform us immediately of 
these changes in writing.</p> <br>
What if my assistant must cancel? 
<p>Please inform ACIS immediately. We regret that if the cancellation occurs 
within 65 days of departure, we will charge the canceling assistant a $150 late 
cancellation fee and may not be able to accommodate a substitute assistant. If 
the cancellation is within 45 days of departure, the assistant must pay a $250 
late cancellation fee (see ACIS Assistant Registration Form for policy) and 
their stipend credits are not transferable. Please always alert us in writing 
as soon as possible when an assistant cancels.</p> <br>
Do I receive travel 
insurance as a group leader? 
<p>Every ACIS Group Leader receives coverage under our most enhanced 
protection plan, theUltimate Protection Plan complimentary for any tour they 
lead.</p> <br>
What if the group leader must cancel? 
<p>A mutual effort is made to find a qualified substitute teacher or other 
adult who will assume full group leader responsibilities. Participants who 
choose not to travel with the replacement group leader are subject to the 
standard cancellation/refund policy</p> <br>
Can I stay on after my group 
returns home? 
<p>Yes. An Alternate Return Request Form must be completed and returned to 
ACIS no later than 90 days before departure. You will be responsible for any 
additional flight costs, and must arrange for a responsible adult (preferably 
an assistant) to take charge of your group on the flight home. You must obtain 
written permission from a parent/guardian of each participant, naming the adult 
in charge. There will be a $150 charge for any change made within 90 days of 
departure, and no changes are possible within 65 days.</p> <br>
Can I stay in a 
single room? 
<p>Single accommodations are provided free of charge for group leaders who 
have eight or more paying participants counted to their credit AND who do not 
travel with a spouse or an assistant of the same sex. For those traveling in 
2010/2011, see ourService Guarantee. In the unlikely event that a single room 
is not available, ACIS will reimburse you $20 per hotel night. Eligibility for 
the single room is based on the standard 1:6 prorate and is non-transferable. 
If the above does not apply, you may also elect to pay a surcharge of $40 per

Tell us more about the tour manager. 
<p>&quot;Tour manager&quot; is an important term in educational travel. It 
refers to your bus group leader, who is rigorously trained and specially 
selected to assist your group while overseas. ACIS Tour Managers are famous for 
their multifaceted roles, both educational and logistical. An ACIS Tour Manager 
is part commentator, counselor, troubleshooter, advocate, and stopwatch! He or 
she supervises hotel check-ins, directs the bus driver and leads educational 
activities.</p> 
<p>Most importantly, ACIS Tour Managers are travel gurus. They thrive on 
sharing their passion and love for the cultures of the world, giving you the 
opportunity to see the world through the eyes of those who live and work there. 
Over the years, we've employed university professors, film directors, 
journalists, musicians, business professionals, and other creative achievers. 
Our tour managers are consistently recognized as top in the industry. You'll 
receive more information about your tour manager as your departure date 
approaches.</p> 
<p>Your ACIS Tour Manager maintains a professional relationship with the group 
but is not directly responsible for enforcing discipline or the ACIS behavior 
guidelines. That is the responsibility of the your group leader. It is your 
tour manager's responsibility, however, to report to your group leader any 
infractions and to be sure that ACIS behavior guidelines are adhered to.</p> 
<br> Where do we stay? 
<p>ACIS groups stay in three- and four-star conveniently located hotels. We 
place a priority on booking hotels in good locations and safe areas, with 
convenient access to both local attractions and public transportation.</p> 
<p>Students generally stay in rooms with two or three beds. During peak travel 
periods, hotels sometimes add an extra bed to accommodate heavy bookings. ACIS 
attempts to prevent this but cannot guarantee that it will never happen. Some 
hotel rooms in France have a Grand Lit (an oversize double bed for two) instead 
of twin beds. Those who have paid the adult surcharge stay in double rooms in 
hotels but not on overnight ferries or trains.</p> 
<p>An ACIS bus group is typically made up of two, three, or four groups from 
around the U.S. who quickly get to know each other and feel part of one overall 
group. Depending on the mix of male and female students in the bus group, 
students may be rooming with participants from other groups. Don't worry, this 
is a great way to meet new people and make some new friends!</p> 
<p>The group leader will create a variety of rooming combinations before you 
leave, in order to make it easier for your tour manager to work out the rooming 
when you check in to your hotel.</p> 
<p>Check-in time at most hotels is early to mid-afternoon. If you arrive 
overseas early in the morning, you likely have time to change money and do some 
exploring before you check in.</p> <br>
What will we have to eat? 
<p>You will enjoy a variety of meals en route, mixing both native and familiar 
cuisines depending on your area of travel. Keep an open mind and be willing to 
sample everything&mdash;that's what travel is all about!</p> 
<p>Most days you will be served a continental breakfast that includes a 
variety of fresh rolls, cereal, pastry, butter and jam, coffee, tea or hot 
chocolate. In Australia and China, you will be served an American-style hot 
buffet breakfast. On trips to the Americas you may be served the traditional 
rice and beans. In some hotels in Britain, eggs or other items may be included. 
In Europe, the larger hotels sometimes serve eggs and other American-style 
breakfast items for an extra charge.</p> 
<p>On most ACIS trips, you will enjoy lunch on your own. Be adventurous and 
experiment. Many travelers do what the locals do; instead of having an 
expensive restaurant meal, they buy fresh ingredients at a local market, then 
put together a sandwich and have a picnic lunch in a city park.</p> 
<p>On most tours, beverages at dinner are not included. The are included on 
tours to China, Costa Rica, Peru, and occasionally other destinations. 
Sometimes your waiter may put soda or mineral water down on the table without 
being asked. Be aware that you will be charged for any beverages you consume.
</p> 
<p>Although ACIS will try to accommodate special-needs meals including kosher, 
vegetarian and low salt, we cannot guarantee all requests.</p> <br>
How much 
spending money will I need? 
<p>Spending needs vary depending on personal habits, but a typical allowance 
is $50 per day. This allows for lunch, snacks, soft drinks, postage, souvenirs, 
local transportation during free time, free-time activities, and optional 
excursions not already included in your itinerary. Most ACIS participants carry 
ATM cards, travelers checks and credit cards. ACIS has compiled all the 
information you need to know inMoney Matters.</p> <br>
What should I pack? 
<p>Our advice is to pack light&mdash;you won't regret it! You will be 
responsible for carrying your own luggage on and off the bus, in and out of 
your hotel, and onto trains. Bring comfortable, practical clothes that you can 
wear more than once, with a few nice pieces thrown in.</p> 
<p>Remember to pack clothes that you can layer as the weather can be 
unpredictable. Lastly, try to avoid bringing new shoes. New shoes can be tough 
to break in and you&rsquo;ll want to make sure your shoes are comfortable and 
reliable. For more information specific to your trip, log intoMy Account for a 
detailed packing list.</p> <br>
What about calling home? 
<p>Calling home from overseas can be expensive and obtaining local phone cards 
can be complicated and time consuming. The best way to call is with anACIS eKit 
Global Phonecard or Global Mobile Phone. Using the eKit card can save you up to 
70% on international and U.S. long distance calls compared to pay phones and 
hotel phones. Simply charge up your eKit card with the credit card of your 
choice and it will be ready for use. In addition to cheap calls home, the ACIS 
eKit Global Phonecard offers you email, Voicemail, the ability to listen to 
email over the phone and much more!</p> 
<p>Another option is the ACIS eKit Global Mobile phone. With a variety of 
pre-paid plans available, this mobile phone can save you up to 70% on global 
roaming rates.</p> <br>
Do I have travel insurance? 
<p>Yes. Your ACIS Registration Fee includes coverage under our Basic 
Protection Plan. ACIS recommends you upgrade your insurance coverage by 
purchasing theUltimate Protection Plan designed specifically for you travel 
needs. With the Ultimate Protection Plan, you may cancel for any reason up to 
the day of departure and receive a cash refund. You will also receive expanded 
travel protection while on tour.</p> <br>
