<h3>Recommend a Movie</h3> 
<h2> Posted on: 01/27/2012 22:54</h2> 
<p> Yet another Pop Culture question! I've had this on my mind for a while...
</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> So this one goes: you&nbsp;pick one movie you really like, and you tell 
the group why we should watch that film, in a medium length post (not 
humungous).&nbsp;It's a writting exersize. Tell the audience what we will get 
out of watching this movie. I'm sure we can all come up with different ones.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> This may get us all running off to our local&nbsp;video rental stores!</p>

<h1>Great idea Elanorgold! It's</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 01/28/2012 01:50</h2> 
<p> Great idea Elanorgold! It's hard to limit myself to just one, but here I 
go!</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I'm picking one that I recently re-watched that I love. To me, &quot;Music 
of the Heart,&quot; is a beautiful movie - a real triumph of the human spirit. 
It's a true story that takes place in an elementary school in East Harlem, New 
York. Meryl Streep stars as Roberta Guaspari, a single mother of two and a 
violin teacher. She sets up a program for these inner city kids, teaching them 
how to play the violin. Ten years later, the program is threatened when funding 
is pulled. The way that Roberta, her students, their families and others react 
is what makes the movie worth watching. To find out why - you'll have to watch!

<h1>One movie I often toss out in</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 01/28/2012 15:01</h2> 
<p> One movie I often toss out in threads like this is <em>The Quiet Earth 
</em>(1985, New Zealand). It's post-apocalyptic, but not your typical battle 
for survival variety of post-apoc. A scientist awakens after a suicide attempt 
to find all but himself and a couple other humans have apparently vanished. He 
and the others try to figure out what happened and why they were spared. A 
research project that&nbsp;he was involved with seems to be part of it.&nbsp;It 
gets mystical towards the end (and the meaning of the ending is open for 
discussion) so may not be particularly &quot;hard&quot; s-f, but is certainly 
one of the more thoughtful s-f movies from my lifetime.&nbsp; Well-written, 
well acted, good storytelling, if a bit slow and quiet (but that's a virtue 
here). It's a wonderful antidote to the over-wrought fx gimmickery of tentpole 
s-f movies like those of James Cameron.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Alas,&nbsp;it is also&nbsp;not the easiest movie to find at times. 
&nbsp;Netflix doesn't have it, nor does Youtube Movies. Maybe hit your favorite 
pirate site?? Perhaps some of the smaller, more specialized video stores??</p>

<p> I'll think about what movie to add here.</p> 
<p> Do you guys actually have movie rental places nearby? &nbsp;There used to 
be a Roger's which closed, and my husband and I drove around looking for the 
Blockbuster, arguing a bit about where we thought it was (this was before they 
went bankrupt), we never found it. &nbsp;When we got home we found out why, it 
had closed! &nbsp;Now we use a vending machine in the closest grocery store, 
but it only has new releases. &nbsp;The apartment's convience store used to 
have a few movies for rent, and they don't even offer that service anymore.</p>

<p> Yeah, our nearest was a Blockbuster (RIP) and I haven't really found 
anything else nearby that has decent selection other than London Public Library 
(but they are weak on new releases). Netflix Canada seems to be better for TV 
shows than for movies. Youtube Movies is getting better all the time but still 
doesn't always have what I'm after (you pay per movie rather than a monthly 
subscription like Netflix so it's more like video store). A couple of the 
younger folks at work are going the &quot;free&quot; download route, but I'm 
not totally sold on it. It's piracy, strictly speaking, and the quality and 
security of the sites and downloads, is dicey in some cases.</p>

<p> Weeeelll, I am tempted by the films so far. Trish, brief, to the point, 
compelling,&nbsp;I'm not sure I can give you an A for descriptive 
writting&nbsp;though! ; ) lol.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> We are lucky to still have two video rental places, 20 mins away. One is 
fairly new and doesn't have many older films, the other has been there a while 
and while it isn't as big as a Blockbuster, it suffices. The library system is 
sadly lacking, I often have to buy a film I'm desperate to see. For example one 
called Farinelli: Il Castrati, about a Rococo castralto singer I found out 
about on Youtube. I'll have to buy it on Ebay.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I used to have a 24 hr video across the street (early 90's), and would 
rent at least two a week, sometimes 4.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Somegal, That reminds me of the one with Michelle Pfeiffer in it, set in a 
rough urban center. That was realy good. But that's not the movie I'll pick to

<h1>I'm going to recommend</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 01/28/2012 22:00</h2> 
<p> I'm going to recommend &quot;Alive&quot; starring Ethan Hawke. 1993. It 
should be fairly easy to find.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> This movie changed my life. It is one of 18 movies that have done this in 
a major way. I saw it some 17 years ago and it still lives on in my mind.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> It is the true story of a group of young&nbsp;rugby players&nbsp;whose 
plane crashes in the Andes in the 70's, and how they die&nbsp;and survive. It 
is a realistic and gritty portrayal that used testimonies from the survivors to 
put together the scenes. We see life turn from normal and comfortable, as we 
all know it, to harsh and raw and primal, in a few seconds. We learn about 
human nature, and how our traits fare when put to the ultimate test, and also 
the cruel harshness of chance. We learn about ourselves in this film. It is at 
times hard to watch, but does not glorify gore, and therefore I was able to see 
it through. We go with the survivors through their arduous experience, share in 
their guilt, fear, resignation, strengths and weaknesses, ingenuity and 
triumphs,&nbsp;and leave the film changed, quiet, thoughtfull, appreciative. I 
have sour tears in my eyes just&nbsp;remembering it.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I listened to the book on tape telling of this story by the main character 
in the film: Nando Parrado a few months ago, and was once again moved and 
changed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I think anyone who wants to know more about humanity, themselves, how it 
all works, and how we all fit in should see this film. Definately ***** 5 stars.

repelled and compelled, and all together educated. Plus, Michelle was awesome

<p> Our local store still rents movies. The owner and the folks at the library

<p> Not easily. Netflix tends to create themed lists for you to browse based 
on movies and TV shows that you've either watched or rated. Some of them 
actually come up with interesting stuff. &quot;Acclaimed 1980s Dramas Based on 
Books&quot; or&nbsp;&quot;Cult TV Series with Female Leads&quot; (offered based 
on my giving Buffy four stars)&nbsp;and that sort of thing. You can also go 
into genres and browse lists specific to those genres (Cult Horror, Witty 
Fantasy, and such like).</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Still not quite like browsing a store, though, any more than looking 
through Kobo or Amazon is like browsing through a good bookstore.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> On the other hand, if you're looking for&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific 
title&nbsp;or person (e.g. you crave a Woody Allen movie), then they have a 
search engine that makes the job quite easy compared to to trying to find a 
specific item in some stores.</p>

description on the back. Lethbridge library used to be really good. Got out The 
Sorceress there, starring Christine Boisson, which was really educational

one, as per my one movie rule! ; )</p>

<p> </p> 
<p></p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> When you're browsing, you can assign ratings from 1-5 stars to movies and 
shows&nbsp;you've already seen and then they assume that similarly rated movies 
of a similar type will also interest you. They also take account of what you've 
already watched on Netflix and how you rated that content.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> So, if you rate the new Star Trek at 5 stars, they will likely steer you 
to the other Trek movies (they don't have any of the Trek TV shows on Netflix 
Canada, but all of the movies).</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> They do show you the cover (if they have a cover image available) and a 
summary based on the back blurb. But, you still only see the ones that they are 
feeding you unless you go into a genre and click the all titles option. So, it 
doesn't help with browsing by cover (something I do, as well), though, does 
it?&nbsp; I've picked a few winners over the years just by looking at the cover 
and reading the back blurb.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> In the end, I'd rather go to a video store or library for browsing, but 
like online source like Netflix when I'm zero'ing in on&nbsp;something specific.

<h2>Posted on: 01/31/2012 23:01</h2> 
<p> Yes, it would be useful, if you have high speed. DO you watch on your 
computer or burn to dvd and watch on your tv screen? Or&nbsp;maybe your 
computer hooked up to your tv. It would be a drag to watch movies on our 
computer! You hae to have all the technology for all that to work. Good thing 
we still do have some video stores. You find things you wouldn't expect to 
like, or wuldn't otherwise notice. True, I do often like a film that is similar 
to something else, but part of the fun is finding stuff you never knew about 
and isn't like anything else. But that said, I find a lot of stuff I like on 
Youtube through the sidebar, and on Amazon through the related items there. I 
just hope people will allways have access to the movie gems of yesteryear.</p>

<p> Yes, it would be useful, if you have high speed. DO you watch on your

<p> You can't burn Netflix content to disc (well, I suspect there are ways, 
but I'm not doing it). It's a streamed service (i.e. it plays from the website 
to your computer). Kind of like a big, fee-based Youtube in that regard. 
There's a Netflix client for the Nintendo Wii (for all of the big game 
consoles, actually), so we have our Wii connected to our home network and can 
then stream Netflix to the TV through it. Only downside is that the Wii isn't 
High-Definition so we can't access the HD content (Xbox 360 and PS3 are better 
Netflix clients in this regard).</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> For stuff that we do download, I copy it to an external hard drive and 
connect that to a Patriot Box Office media player. The Patriot basically lets 
you take digital media content and play it on a TV without having to have a 
computer or network connection on the TV itself. Plays full 1080p and can be 
networked using Wi-fi. No Netflix or Youtube client as of yet, though.</p>

<h1>I loved one called &quot;Antonia's</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 02/01/2012 11:09</h2> 
<p> I loved one called &quot;Antonia's Line&quot;. There are a lot of movies I 
really enjoy, but I'd be hard-pressed to remember them afterwards or a couple 
of years later.</p> 
<p> This one really stayed with me and I've seen it a few times.</p> 
<p> So where do I start? Directed by Dutch filmmaker Marleen Gorris, it is a 
retrospective of a very strong, caring woman who drew around her the vulnerable 
and disenfranchised&nbsp; ones in her small, rural Dutch community post WW2. 
It's very progressive and inclusive. Everyone is valued and accepted for who 
they are.</p> 
<p> Together they all pull together and work hard to survive.</p> 
<p> The characters are extremely well-drawn. There is the young teen with Down 
Syndrome from a neighbouring farm, who she saves from a horrible life. This is 
the most difficult part of the movie to watch as it is a rape scene. It's 
handled well. And justice prevails.</p> 
<p> Her own daughter (who she raises alone) has a child out of wedlock, but 
falls in love with another woman and they are accepted as a couple raising 
their child together.</p> 
<p> The widower next door becomes her &quot;special friend&quot; but she 
eschews marriage.</p> 
<p> Conversation:</p> 
<p> Him&nbsp; &quot;My sons need a mother&quot;</p> 
<p> Her&nbsp; &quot;I don't need your sons&quot;</p> 
<p> Him&nbsp; &quot;You don't need a husband?&quot;</p> 
<p> Her&nbsp; &quot;What for?&quot;</p> 
<p> They spend time together away from everyone in a little bunkie when things 
get romantic.</p> 
<p> There are also some quirky villagers who the director treats with real 
compassion.</p> 
<p> Remember this all takes place at a time when social norms were very 
conservative and repressive.</p> 
<p> This movie is amazing. Well worth your time.</p>

<p> SOunds like a great film Ninj. It's going on my list. All the films 
recommended are. I like films about human nature, and how we make things work, 
how we survive and adapt and relate.</p>

<h1>I recoomend &quot;One Week&quot; It is</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 02/02/2012 22:32</h2> 
<p> I recoomend &quot;One Week&quot; It is the best movie I have ever seen.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> It is a road trip story, about a young recently engaged man who is 
diagnosed with terminal cancer at the begining of the movie, and then takes a 
motorcycle trip accross Canada to find the meaning of life, and what his 
purpose is. &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The movie makes you think, laugh, cry and feel joy. &nbsp; The film 
explores human relationships, spirituality and our connectness to nature. 
&nbsp;The film is also a celebration of being Canadian, with great scenes shot 
in the most beautiful places, and it is also filled with great Canadian music, 
written and recored by independant and up and coming Canadian artists.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> It also has one of the most inspiring and brillant endings of any movie.

<p> Definately gonna see that one Alex. The description reminds me of Into the 
Wild, though I expect they are quite different. But Into the Wild reeeeealy 
moved me, and is also about one man's journey to find meaning and fulfillment.

<p> Another movie I put on sometimes just for fun, it's like visiting old 
friends, is &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. &nbsp;It's funny and cute and has 
some great one-liners and just timeless appeal. Oh and Billy Chrystal makes a 
cameo appearance. Can't top THAT.</p>

<h1>Partially based on a</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 02/03/2012 18:54</h2> 
<p> Partially based on a recommendation here by Elanorgold, last night I 
watched Alive. I learned something about myself - that I should not 
watch&nbsp;movies about plane crashes at night! I live a couple of blocks away 
from a hospital that frequently has helicoptors landing on its' roof and I can 
usually see them through my bedroom window. Last night I heard them a couple of 
times and, each time, horrific scenes from the movie floated into my mind.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> That said, I did find the movie to be very moving - and I found it 
interesting how things that I found to be grotesque, at first, became bearable 
(and watchable) by the end. I was quite emotional by the end.</p>

<h1>Awww, I'm touched. ANd</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 02/03/2012 21:04</h2> 
<p> Awww, I'm touched. ANd touched that you're touched. The visions while 
copters arrive will fade. That's natural. It's a responce to the new thoughts, 
and to the expantion of your mind through the movie. I'm sure you'll never 
forget it. Nando talks about the unbearable becoming common by the end in his 
own book too. How humanity adapts.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I just watched a student made trailer for the film.&nbsp;It's good.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Ah yes, Princess Bride is always good. I now have two copies. Billy 
Crystal is great, and Carol Cane is so funny! &quot;I'm not a witch I'm yer 
wife! But after what you just said, I'm not sure I wanna be that anymore!!&quot;

<h1>Actually watched a couple</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 02/05/2012 21:31</h2> 
<p> Actually watched a couple movies this weekend. One I'm a bit iffy on 
(Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris) but the other is an unqualified 
recommendation.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The recommendation is&nbsp;<em>An Education </em>(2007). It's about a 17 
year-old girl (Carey Mulligan,&nbsp;who deservedly picked up a raft of awards 
for the role)&nbsp;who gets involved&nbsp;with a high-flying older man (Peter 
Sarsgaard) during the swinging sixties and how it affects her life both 
positively and negatively. Smart script by Nick Hornby based on a memoir 
(forget the author) and a very well-made film overall. While Mulligan got a lot 
of the attention for it, the rest of the cast is also excellent, esp. her 
parents. Also looks gorgeous as it takes us through the London hip scene of the 
period as well as a visit to Paris.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> As for <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, I'm a big Woody Allen&nbsp;fan and this 
movie should, on paper, be the sort of Allen film that I eat up. However, when 
we watched it yesterday, it just didn't click with me until near the end. I'll 
probably give it another view. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it. 
Basically, a writer visits Paris with his fiancee and her parents. He's always 
wanted to go there and is particularly enamoured of the 1920s Paris inhabited 
by Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and other writers and artists that he idolizes. One 
night, he finds himself taken back to that time where he starts hanging out 
with his idols, even getting Gertrude Stein to critique his novel and having a 
rather chaste&nbsp;fling with Picasso's mistress. It's getting the most praise 
(and the best box office&nbsp;returns) that Woody's had since his heyday in the 
seventies and eighties so I just feel I should have liked it more than I did.

<h1>Hmm, it's weird feeling when</h1> 
<h2>Posted on: 02/07/2012 23:13</h2> 
<p> Hmm, it's weird feeling when you feel you should like a film better. It 
might be a mood thing, or else it wasn't as good as others, or 
you're&nbsp;evolving away from Woody films... I've had that feeling before too 
about films and albums.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> An Education sounds really interesting. I was in town today but only 
briefly, so sending hubby with a movie list tomorrow...</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I just thought of another unofficial recommendation, &quot;I'm Not 
There&quot; about Bob Dylan. It was a funky off beat partly b&amp;w&nbsp;film, 
and Kate Blanchett was awesome in it. She played Bob fantastically, her and Ben 
Whishaw were my favorite Bobs. Having some Bob in my past, the film had 
relevance to me. Anyone who isn't familiar with any Bob lore though, would be 
rather lost.</p>

<p> I watched One Week a couple days ago. Thanks Alex. It reminded me of my 
male chauvanist friend. He looks a lot like him too. Love the ending, 
re-inforces the importance of being true to one's self, and doing as we need. 
Made me feel proud of my own accomplishments and choices. : ) And I'm sure 
encouraged my husband to keep submitting his novel in to publishers. And 
enjoyed the Canadian settings. I've been to some of them, Tofino, Banff, Hells 
Gate... Sask was very much like southern ALberta.</p>

<p> So many movies, but one from a while ago, &quot;Beaches&quot; with bette 
middler (tearjerker) or&nbsp; The Colour Purple.</p> 
<p> I guess I liked them because they both emphasize the bond women have with 
each other. They're not the greatest movies I've ever seen, but still they

<p> City Island</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> I pulled this off wiki...it summarizes the movie perfectly and better than 
I ever could have.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> --</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p>  Living on City Island, in the Bronx, Vince Rizzo (Andy 
Garc&iacute;a), a prison guard, is the father of a dysfunctional family whose 
members all have secrets. Vince discovers that his secret illegitimate son is 
now the 24-year-old prison inmate Tony Nardella (Steven Strait) who is being 
held in the same prison where he works. Without revealing this truth to his 
family, Vince consequently gets Tony out of prison and employs him as hired 
help at his own home in order to become closer with his unknowing son. Vince 
has also been secretly taking acting lessons, taught by Michael Malakov (Alan 
Arkin), and begins to form a platonic bond with Molly (Emily Mortimer), another 
aspiring actor.  &nbsp;  Meanwhile, Vince's 20-year-old daughter, Vivian 
(Dominik Garcia-Lorido, the real life daughter of Andy Garc&iacute;a, her 
onscreen father), has not told her family that she has been suspended from 
college, lost her scholarship, gotten breast implants, and has become a 
stripper to try and pay for her next semester; their youngest teenage child, 
Vinnie (Ezra Miller), has a secret sexual fetish for feeding women, feederism, 
and fantasizes about their fat next-door neighbor; and Vince's wife, Joyce 
(Julianna Margulies), thinking she has lost all marital intimacy, sexually 
pursues Tony without realizing that he is her stepson.  &nbsp;  --  &nbsp;  All 
in all, if you think your family is dysfunctional, take a break and watch this 
family in action... you may feel downright normal

<h2>Posted on: 02/15/2012 12:43</h2> 
<p> I saw Beaches when it was new, ad cried through just about the whole 
thing. My Dad even cried too! My best friend at the time watched it with us and 
started laughing part way through, and I looked over to her, I mean,<em>the 
insult!</em>She had removed herself from the whole scene and found it quite 
funny that all three of us, mom, dad and me were all boo-hoo'ing. lol! But 
yeah, great female bond film. That was a log time ago though, so I might be due 
to see it again.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> The flip side of that thought might be Heavenly Creatures, about two girls 
who become bosom buddies and it gets carried away and twisted. Really made me 
feel gross. The two girls plot to murder the mother who tries to keep them 
apart, and thereafter have to spend the rest of their lives apart for their own 
good, one of them in a mental hospital. A warning not to let friendships go too 
far.</p>

<p> Did you realize that Heavenly Creatures was a Peter Jackson movie (i.e. 
Lord of the Rings, King Kong, The Hobbit)? Quite a different movie 
from&nbsp;the tentpole epics&nbsp;we're used to seeing from him these days. He 
also did some rather screwball horror-comedy films in his early years before 
getting all Hollywood on us.</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> It was also Kate Winslet's first feature film (she'd mainly done TV 
before).</p>
