<h2>Historical notes about Greater London</h2> 
<h3>GREATER LONDON</h3> 
<p>London is the most higgledy-piggledy of all the world's great cities. 
Thomas Burke says it is &quot;as unknowable as a man on the bus.&quot; The 
truth is that London is as knowable as the man on the bus. There is little that 
is secretive about either.</p> 
<p>The difficulty is to decide exactly what is meant by London, for there are 
in fact several &lsquo;Londons' for different purposes, and none is exactly the 
same as the other.</p> 
<p>First in order of size there is the great, sprawling mass of bricks and 
mortar known as Greater London. As such it has no official status. It is the 
vast collection of streets, factories and houses along both banks of the 
Thames, with a centre at Charing Cross, and reaching out in every direction 
over a radius of at least fifteen miles. Greater London covers an area of about 
seven hundred square miles and (although no census has been taken since 1931) 
has a population of over eight million souls.</p> 
<p>This vast area is coincident with the Metropolitan Police District, and the 
writ of the Metropolitan Police runs throughout it. But, and here is one of the 
many London oddities, there is an exception, for that writ does not run within 
the bounds of theCity of London, which is a law unto itself. Nor is there any 
common authority for the administration of Greater London, for the area 
includes not only the whole of Middlesex, but also a large part ofSurrey, 
Hertfordshire, Essex and Kent. In fact, it embraces not only London as a 
working centre, but also the dormitories of its workers. Even this statement is 
not quite true, for, with the development of fast electric trains over a 
growing network of suburban lines, of the motor-car and the Green Line coach, 
London's dormitories now reach to the south coast, from Eastbourne to Worthing.
</p> 
<p>Apart from these suburban lines, London has its own vast transport system, 
operated by the London Passenger Transport Board. The system includes all the 
Undergound lines (and these, run fromSouthend to Uxbridge and from Morden to 
remoteWendover and Aylesbury), trams, now rapidly giving way to trolley buses, 
and the red monster of London's streets, the bus proper.</p> 
<p>Inside this Greater London is the administrative County of London, the area 
with which I am concerned in this article. There is considerable ignorance 
(even in the minds of London Policemen) as to where this administrative County 
begins and ends.</p> 
<p>It covers an area of 74,850 acres, stretching from Poplar in the east to 
Hammersmith in the west - from the northern heights of Hampstead to the 
southern heights of Sydenham, topped by the ghost of the Crystal Palace. It 
houses a population of nearly four and half million people and embraces 
twenty-nine separate administrative entities, consisting of two cities - London 
andWestminster - and twenty seven boroughs - namely: Hammersmith, Fulham, 
Kensington, Chelsea, Paddington, Marylebone, Hampstead, St Pancras, Holborn, 
Finsbury, Islington, Stoke Newington, Shoreditch, Stepney, Bethnal Green, 
Hackney, Poplar, Woolwich, Greenwich, Lewisham, Deptford, Bermondsey, 
Southwark, Camberwell, Lambeth, Battersea, and Wandsworth.</p> 
<p>Each of these boroughs, as well as the two cities, has its own mayor (a 
Lord Mayor in the case of theCity of London) and municipal council, and each of 
them is represented on London's governing body - the London County Council - 
the offices of which are situated in Lambeth and almost face the Houses of 
Parliament across the Thames atWestminster Bridge.</p> 
<p>The historic square mile of the City of London stands on the north bank of 
the Thames. It was originally a walled city, and traces of the Old Roman wall 
can still be seen, particularly at the Tower. The memory of its ancient gates 
is perpetuated in the names of such streets as Moorgate, Ludgate and 
Bishopsgate.</p> 
<p>The City is the capital of commerce and finance. Here is the Bank of 
England; here are the City Guilds, the Livery Companies, whose members are 
freemen of the City, have complete self-government and appoint their ruler in 
the person of the Lord Mayor. Even the King may not enter the City without the 
Lord Mayor's permission, and when he does cross the boundary fromWestminster at 
Temple Bar, he is to this day handed the keys of the City, although the old 
gates no longer remain, and is received as the City's honoured guest.</p> 
<p>Looking down on the City of London from the top of Ludgate Hill is St 
Paul's Cathedral, Christopher Wren's masterpiece. Go up to the Stone Gallery 
and look out across the ancient city! Below is the winding ribbon of the 
Thames, crossed by Blackfriars, Southwark, London and the Tower Bridges, and 
the railway bridges from Cannon Street and Blackfriars stations. Between London 
and Tower Bridges is the Pool of London, with its docks and cranes. This is the 
highest point up river that can be reached by large ocean-going steamers. Down 
the river, as far s the eye can see, stretch mile after mile of docks; for 
London, as well as being the world's greatest city, is also the world's 
greatest port.</p> 
<p>Just where Tower Bridge crosses the river is the Tower of London, a grim 
grey sentinel, embodying almost nine hundred years of London's history, while 
scattered throughout the City you can see graceful spires of Wren's churches, 
many of them, alas, now irreparably damaged by the bombing of the Second World 
War.</p> 
<p>Almost below St Paul's is a great open space, now cleared of its war-time 
dust and rubble, where stood Ave Maria Lane, Paternoster Row and Paternoster 
Square, the haunts of booklovers, which perished in the second Great Fire of 
London started on the night of December 29, 1940, by the enemy incendiary 
bombs. The streets all around bear evidence of this and other raids that 
destroyed or severely damaged the Guildhall, the Temple, and many of the quiet 
old inns and courts.</p> 
<p>Adjoining the City to the west is part of Westminster, the richest of the 
London boroughs, created a city by Royal Charter as recently as 1900. Within it 
are the Houses of Parliament, the Abbey, the Law Courts, Buckingham Palace, and 
most of the older finest buildings in London. Whitehall houses the departments 
of state.</p> 
<p>The boundaries of the County of London have been arbitrarily settled 
without apparent rhyme or reason. Why, for example, should semi-countrified
Hampstead be in London and grim, squalid entirely, and often hideously, urban 
Tottenham and Willesden be outside? But London is a plan-less city, every 
growing, without sense or reason, an octopus of bricks and mortar, steel and 
concrete.</p> 
<p>The centre of an Empire, the character of which is dramatically changing, 
and of a Commonwealth that still retains a tremendous influence in the shaping 
of human destinies, and for a century the financial hub of the world, London 
has accepted its high destiny with little more than amused indifference. Its 
historical possessions are for the most part unappreciated. It permits 
&quot;improvers&quot; to destroy its beauties with a ruthlessness almost equal 
to that of the German bombers. Londoners made no effective protests when the 
Adam's Adelphi and Nash's Regent Street became the victims of the 
housebreakers' picks, and during the war Londoners regretted the destruction of 
some of its finest buildings - and these were sadly numerous - far less than 
they mourned the loss of the cramped little houses in the mean little streets.
</p> 
<p>London lacks imagination and the historic sense. Its people admire Bush 
House because it is large, but leave American tourists to admire St James's 
Palace.Westminster Abbey, a supremely beautiful possession and the burial-place 
of the nation's heroes, is to London not a monument of loveliness bequeathed to 
us by the ages of faith, but a sort of Madame Tussaud's. It is not the West 
front that interests Londoners, but what William Morris called, &quot;the 
beastly monuments to fools and knaves.&quot; To the poet Henley on an October 
day;</p>  Trafalgar Square<br>
 (The fountains volleying golden glaze)<br>
 
Gleams like an angel-market. 
<p>To the Londoner, Trafalgar Square is the place where the children feed the 
pigeons and trade unionists demonstrate on Sunday afternoons. Wordsworth, 
standing onWestminster Bridge in the morning exclaimed:</p>  Earth has not 
anything to show more fair:<br>
 Dull would he be of soul who could pass by<br>

 A sight so touching in its majesty. 
<p>But the Londoner who crosses the bridge twice every day on his way to and 
from work is wholly unaware of the beauty that Wordsworth felt so keenly.</p> 
<p>The City and Westminster were the cradles of political liberty. But London 
has little pride in the fact. It is possible that more great men have walked in 
its streets than in the streets of any other city except Paris. Paris names its 
streets after its great men, but there is no Shakespeare Street in the City, no 
Chaucer Street, no Milton Street, no Dickens Street, though there are a 
Goldsmith Building in the Temple and a Johnson Court off Fleet Street. There is 
a Browning road outside the City area.</p> 
<p>The Thames is the repository of London's history. It is, too, in a 
diminishing degree, its playground. King Edward the Confessor dedicated the 
Abbey Church ofWestminster to St Peter because of the legend that the saint 
appeared on the river bank atWestminster and there, as a reward for the 
fishermen who ferried him across, he ordained that the man should catch &quot; 
a plentiful supply of fish of which the greater part should be salmon.&quot;</p>
<p>It is pleasant also to remember that the great hospital at Lambeth just 
across the river preserves the name of St Thomas of London who was murdered in 
Canterbury Cathedral and who was loved and trusted by the poor. So was 
Archbishop Laud, who centuries after St Thomas died, was taken down the river 
from Lambeth to die in the Tower, and, as he passed, the people lined the 
river-bank and wept. Kings have passed up and down the river in picturesque 
pageantry, cheerful pleasure-seekers like Mr Pepys have gone by river to 
boisterous evenings at Vauxhall. For centuries ships have passed up and down 
our oldest road, carrying, in H. M. Tomlinson's words, &quot;those unknown folk 
whose mind created London out of reeds and mere.&quot; The Thames, he adds, is 
&quot;the main thoroughfare fromKensington to Valparaiso.&quot;</p> 
<p>As a man has many moods, so has London. It can be dignified and 
undignified. It can be kind and cruel. It can be tragically foolish and acutely 
wise.</p> 
<p>In his book A Texan in England, Frank Dobie calls London &quot;the supreme 
world receiver.&quot; This suggests that London is cosmopolitan, but this is 
only partially true. London is less of a world city than Paris, and is much 
less cosmopolitan than New York. True there are many foreigners within its 
gates, but they are in it, not of it. The colony of German Jews inHampstead, 
for example remains definitely, often uncomfortably, German, spiritually as the 
poles asunder from the assimilated English Jews. The Italians in Soho and 
Saffron Hill were never Londoners. Unlike their compatriots in New York, few of 
them sought naturalization.</p> 
<p>It is said, I do not know whether accurately or not, that it is rare to 
discover a Londoner of more than the forth generation. The suggestion is that 
the population is constantly being recruited by immigrants from villages and 
other British towns and cities. But the newcomers soon lose all the distinctive 
qualities of the places from which they came. When they arrive, they nearly 
always hate London. It is strange and uncomfortable to the man form a back 
street in Lancashire town, as it is to a man from a Wiltshire village. But 
London is a melting-pot for the folk whom it receives. It remoulds them in its 
own likeness: in less than a generation they become Cockney's, and a Cockney is 
far more unlike the rest of the people of this island than the Parisian is 
unlike the rest of the people of France. London is, indeed, the Londoner's own 
city, and it is impossible to determine whether the Londoner has made London or 
London has made the Londoner.</p> 
<p>Thomas Burke, whose writings have proved his deep love for London, a 
Charles Lamb-like love, has written: &quot;When you can perceive the spiritual 
difference between the squares of Bloomsbury and the squares of Bayswater, 
between the sadness of the Caledonian Road and the melancholy of the Ball's 
Pond road you are beginning to know London.&quot; But, it seems to me these 
alleged differences are either superficial or imaginary. The Bloomsbury and 
Bayswater squares have much the same history, and no one can explain why 
Bayswater now houses the working respectable middle class in its 
boarding-houses, while Bloomsbury has become the home of the student and the 
intelligentsia, as no one can explain why London's few painters moved first 
from St John's Wood toChelsea, and now from Chelsea to Camden Town and Hampstead
, as the Paris Bohemians have moved from the heights of Montmartre across the 
river to Montparnasse. Incidentally, is it safe to say that Dickens would no 
find the Caledonian Road wholly sad or the Ball's Pond Road entirely 
melancholy? He would have heard laughter in them both.</p> 
<h4>The Londoner's Character</h4> 
<p>Frank Dobie notes that there are more birds in London than in any other 
great city, and he suggests that this is indicative of the character of its 
people. Possibly, possibly not. Londoners must be kindly folk, Dobie thinks, or 
they would snare the pigeons for food. But, I am told, frugal Italian 
restaurant-keepers have proved by experiment that even the deftest cooking 
cannot make London pigeon edible.</p> 
<p>However, it is true that the Londoner is as essentially kindly as he is 
cosy, and the kindness is most apparent in the districts where the streets are 
mean and the means scanty. The most valuable communal qualities seem to be most 
highly developed amongst those whose lives are limited gy economic 
circumstances. The poor are affected by their environment because they rarely 
escape from that environment. To discover the real Londoner, therefore, it is 
necessary to avoid the Dorchester Hotel and turn into the Pig and Whistle, and 
to journey from the West End toIslington and Pentonville, striking south to 
Bethnal Green, then, carefully skirting the City, making one's way to what the 
Germans have left of Stepney andPoplar (more genuinely London than their 
cosmopolitan neighbour Whitechapel), then across the Tower Bridge to 
Rotherhithe and Bermondsey and westward to Southwark and Lambeth. Or another 
journey of discovery might be from the West End to the streets between Lisson 
Grove and the Edgware Road, going westward to the slums ofPaddington - some of 
the worst slums left in London - and so to the mean streets of RoyalKensington, 
that are little better.</p> 
<p>There are, again superficially, many Londons - rich London and poor London, 
literary London and artistic London, virtuous London and raffish London and 
suburban London. Most of them are real London, though some of them are 
practically foreign colonies, the people of which would be happier elsewhere. 
But it is in struggling London that the genuine Londonner is to be found, and, 
when he is found and understood, he will be recognized as a kindly easy-going, 
indifferent man. The majority of the folk who sleep as well as work within the 
County borders belong to the working class. The rich, who are nowadays selling 
their mansions to commercial firms, have been for generations only sojourners 
in London, and rarely there from Fridays to Mondays. The middle classes, from 
the poorly paid clerks to the head of businesses, are constantly trekking 
farther and farther from the City's centre to its outskirts and over its 
borders, and the greater their resources the longer is the trek.</p> 
<p>The Londoner is the purposeless amateur of life, and his City has been 
thrown together by purposeless amateurs. &quot;Here is a church . . . .,&quot; 
said Mr Wemmick, &quot;let's have a wedding.&quot; &quot;Here is an open 
space,&quot; says the Londoner, &quot;let's build a house.&quot; It does not 
matter what sort of a house, or in what style it is built. Indeed, the Londoner 
prefers that it shall have no style. The result ought to be, and almost always 
is, repellent ugliness and heartbreaking discomfort. But - and this is the 
marvel of London - with all the misuse and lazy indifference, even with the 
horror of the new suburbs built after the First World War, London like myself 
an appealing and attractive cosiness, hardly to be found anywhere else.</p> 
<h4>Helping Hands</h4> 
<p>There are pessimists who declare that the London kindliness that Dickens 
dramatically describes over and over again has been destroyed by the hard 
trials of the war. I do not agree. It was magnificently apparent in every 
blitz, but the kindliness of the Londoner does not need unusual peril to bring 
it into existence. It is evident, again I add at least to me, in the ordinary 
traffic of everyday life. &quot;It's the pore that &lsquo;elps' the pore&quot; 
is a London truism. No hard-luck story ever fails to find a helping hand. There 
is no kindlier place on earth than the London of the mean street, even if there 
are few noisier places than Oxford Street in the rush hours. &quot;What I miss 
&lsquo;ere,' said a Bermondsey woman, a war village evacuee, &quot;is my 
neighbours.&quot; I suggested that she have found many new neighbours. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;but they're not the same: they're not so 
matey.&quot;</p> 
<p>The familiar little knots of women, gossiping outside the little houses or 
on the balconies of the tenements, are regarded by the censorious as examples 
of slatternly laziness. Yet they stand for London's mateyness - little knots of 
sympathetic and understanding friends sharing their troubles and laughing at 
their misfortunes. That is the Londoner's distinguishing quality. He can laugh 
at almost everything. He finds occasion for laughter when other men would weep. 
He agrees with Dibdin, &quot;What agrifies snivelling and piping your 
eye?&quot; In the mean streets is commonly heard the remark, &quot;I didn't arf 
laugh,&quot; when some unforeseen misfortune has occurred. London enjoys the 
incongruous and half welcomes the unexpected, even when it is misfortune. It is 
a &quot;bit of a change.&quot; The Londoner is the laughing stoic. &quot;It 
might have been worse,&quot; is the summary of his philosophy. Experience has 
taught him to expect very little. He is not surprised when he receives nothing.
</p> 
<p>The essential kindness of the Londoner is accompanied with fickleness and 
lack of firmness of purpose. He can never be interested for very long in the 
things that matter. He will kick hard against economic grievances, but Derby 
Day or a football tie will drive serious concerns from his mind. Consequently 
none of the popular social movements that led to the Labour Party triumph in 
1945 began in London, though London has always been sympathetic.</p> 
<h4>Playing the Fool</h4> 
<p>The Londoner is apt to be frivolous-minded. Unlike St Paul, he never puts 
away childish things. He is never really happy except when he is playing the 
fool. Frank Dobie says that &quot;the English belong to the realm of 
naturalness.&quot; The Londoner is natural only when he is free to give himself 
to the frivolous - darts and football pools and the cultivation of a back 
garden.</p> 
<p>The tiny suburban gardens and the flower-pots on the tenement window-sills 
suggest the Londoners love of flowers. His parks, too, are beautiful, or were 
until the military had their way with them in the war. This seems to contradict 
my assertion that the Londoner has small care for beauty. But the parks have 
been imposed on the City by authority in a past age, and the Londoner's 
interest in the often gorgeous flower-beds is perfunctory and in the trees 
disastrous. His own patch or his own flower-pots supply the means of growing 
something under difficulties; for they are a gamble, and appeal to the 
Londoner's sporting instinct.</p> 
<p>The Londoner is tolerant, not given to harsh judgements of his neighbours. 
If one of them is arrested by the police he is commonly described as 
&quot;being in trouble.&quot; The miserable sinner is a &quot;pore feller&quot; 
to be pitied. Max Beerbhom once said that he always pitied the wrong-doer, 
since he generally has a bad time. The public bar agrees with him. The respect 
for the law with which the Londoner is often credited is, in fact, vastly 
exaggerated. He detests being &quot;ordered about,&quot; and, in so far as he 
obeys the laws and regulations without more than humorous protest, he does so 
from that consideration for others that is the Londoner's virtue - from, that 
is, his mateyness. On the whole, the Londoner is more courteous than the 
Parisian, the New Yorker or the man of Manchester and Leeds.</p> 
<p>The Londoner, says Thomas Burke, is &quot;vital and gusty,&quot; he is also 
knowing and kindly. But one thing he cannot abide; he agrees with the 
theologians in regarding pride as the first of the deadly sins. He has no use 
for the man who &quot;chucks his weight about.&quot; This human and, I would 
venture to add, Christian dislike was expressed by the late Gus Elen in his 
song:<br>
 Since Jack Jones come into a little bit</p>  O'splosh<br>
 &lsquo;E 
dunno where &lsquo;e are. 
<p>The Londoner is naturally lazy. How comparatively lazy he is I discovered 
when I took to living among the industrious people of a small agricultural 
village. He is the born loafer forced by hand necessity to labour, and there 
has never been a song more certain of the Londoner's applause than the ditty of 
which the chorus ran:</p>  Standing at the corner watching other fellers work.
<br> That'll never upset me. 
<p>The Londoner works to live; to live to work would seem to him sheer idiocy. 
That is why Scotsmen and Irishmen and migrants from the outer English marches 
have most of the good London jobs. No true Londoner was ever a disciple of Dr 
Smiles.</p> 
<p>This instinctive revolt against &quot;the daily round,&quot; the weary 
task, derives from the fact that the Londoner is sufficiently interested in the 
trivial to resent being compelled to spend his time with the serious.</p> 
<p>Yet - so contrary a creature is man - the Londoner hates change. Where he 
is, there he wants to remain. Novelty has no attraction for him. Most of the 
people who were removed from overcrowded Stepney to the model streets of 
Dagenham sadly missed the familiar &quot;local,&quot; the old neighbours, even 
the unsanitary home. The village after a time settles more or less happily in 
London. The Londoner is miserable in the country after a few days. I met scores 
of evacuees during the war; I did not meet one (except perhaps the very young 
children) who was not aching for the trams and the shops, the cinemas and the 
noise of his London.</p> 
<p>Superficially, London has changed immensely since Dickens described the 
striking slums, where Oliver Twist was caught in Fagin's web, and the 
humorously endured poverty of the Cratchits and the Kenwigs. It is cleaner, 
healthier and more comely. It has changed, indeed, in my lifetime. Many good 
new things have been added to the City's life, some good things have been lost.
</p> 
<p>One of the most grievous losses is the music-hall, the shrine and the 
preserver of genuine Cockney humour. Dan Leno, pathetically puzzled because his 
audience didn't &quot;know Mrs Kelly,&quot; the &quot;vital and gusty&quot; 
Marie Lloyd, that genius of friendly, high-spirited naughtiness, the stout, 
genial Herbert Campbell, the philosophic Alec Hurley advising.</p>  Never 
introduce your donah to a pal<br>
 For the odds is ten to one he'll sneak your 
gal 
<p>- these and their comrades were the authentic voices of the London of 
thirty years ago. Their songs were banal, their humour was robustly coarse, 
they were natural. &quot;All, all are gone the old familiar faces,&quot; and 
their places have been taken by insufferable crooners, babbling fake plantation 
ditties about &quot;Kentucky babbies.&quot;</p> 
<p>The coming of the cinema and the Hollywood film has revolutionized London's 
language. The obedient Cockney child now replies &quot;O.K., chief,&quot; to 
every instruction. The Cockney now says, &quot;yeah&quot; and not the old-time 
&quot;yuss.&quot; The accent not only of the Wellers, but also of the Londoner 
of forty years ago, has almost disappeared. This is due to better schools, the 
radio and the cinema. But, in spite of all these changes the Londoner is as he 
has always been. His soul is more stubborn than his streets.</p> 
<p>London is at the beginning of another, and this time, may be, the most 
fundamental, of its many changes. The London that successfully resisted 
Christopher Wren's efforts to make it symmetrical and comely is now to be 
planned by Sir Patrick Abercormbie. Beauty, order and seemliness are to take 
the place of the traditional higgledy-piggledy. It is possible that the 
Londoner's devotion to disorder will, to some extent, foil the architects and 
the planners. But, however that may be, I do not doubt that the Londoner of 
tomorrow will be the close kin of the Londoner of yesterday. With, alas, small
