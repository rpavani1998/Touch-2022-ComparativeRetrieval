<h2>Paris Fashion Week: How to Dress the Part</h2> 
<p>March 1, 2012 &nbsp;by Erin Dahl</p> 
<h6><em>Posing in the Tuileries in between shows, Paris Fashion Week 2012 (
Boswell)</em></h6> 
<p>When early March hits, something in the air changes. Models come out of the 
woodwork and women in New York, London, Paris and elsewhere put a bit more 
effort into their attire. If you&rsquo;re not in the fashion industry, 
it&rsquo;s easy to be bewildered by the overnight switch from simple booties to 
stilettos. Fashion week is both daunting and exciting; add a locale like Paris 
to the mix and both sensations are heightened. Fear not, mes amis &ndash; 
dressing like a chic insider for Paris Fashion Week is possible.</p> 
<p>Think of this week as an opportunity. March also (hopefully) marks the end 
of winter, a season when dreary days have the masses stuck in a style rut. 
Fashion choices are understandably made based on the practicality of pieces 
rather than how they actually look. After all, freezing temperatures make it 
near impossible to trade your puffy coat (the one that doubles as a sleeping 
bag) in for a cropped leather jacket, right?</p> 
<h6><em>Comings and goings in the Tuileries, Paris Fashion Week 2012 (Boswell)
</em></h6> 
<p>Now that the weather&rsquo;s turning around, ditch the bulk and grab your 
most daring pieces. Remember that quirky vintage hat you just had to have? 
Here&rsquo;s your chance to wear it and not hear &ldquo;mon dieu&rdquo; 
whispered more times than you can count. Or those wonderfully whimsical printed 
tights that you feel just a little bit funny wearing around on any old day? 
Pull &lsquo;em up. Parisians embrace Fashion Week, but that&rsquo;s not to say 
you&rsquo;ll get away with what you could in, say, New York. Here are a few 
guidelines to aid in your PFW sartorial adventures:Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;

<h2>Three Weeks in Paris: Maggie&rsquo;s Top Food &amp; Shopping Picks</h2> 
<p>February 21, 2012 &nbsp;by Maggie Battista</p> 
<h6><em>Alecska</em></h6> 
<p>In a few days, I&rsquo;ll be sipping wine at <em>un petit caf&eacute;</em> 
in the Marais, just in time, we all hope, for the weather to finally swing 
toward Spring. There&rsquo;s too much to squeeze into this 3-week trip.</p> 
<p>Besides visiting Verjus and Au Passage <em>bien sur</em>, I hope to dine at 
Septime and Bistro Volnay. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll splurge on a meal at 
L&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel Thoumieux. Though, the best part of being in my own Paris 
pied-a-terre is stocking up at theMarche des Enfants Rouge for home-cooked 
dishes that always seem to taste better in Paris.</p> 
<h6><em>Merci concept store (Liquidx)</em></h6> 
<p>While I hope to buy something special at Merci (a girl can dream), 
I&rsquo;ll definitely pop intoLes Mauvaises Graines, an urban garden concept 
store in Montmartre, and will likely fall in love with a handcrafted souvenir at
Le Petite Atelier de Paris.</p> 
<p>On one of my weekends abroad, I&rsquo;m jetting to Copenhagen. Being a New 
England girl, I suppose I&rsquo;m a sucker for the cold weather. I&rsquo;m also 
eager to visit what&rsquo;s hailed as the best restaurant in the world and 
after several odd-hour phone calls to Denmark, lucked out with a reservation at
Noma. We&rsquo;ll see if Copenhagen food stacks up to Paris culinaria.</p> 
<h6><em>Septime (Lindsey Tramuta)</em></h6> 
<p>More than anything though, I simply want to find my favorite spots near my 
Marais flat. I hope to take my daily espresso atMerce and the Muse, lunch at 
Glou and unwind with an evening wine at La Perle. I promise to only visit 
Jacques Genin&rsquo;s fabulous boutique once or twice if, and only if, I take a 
few strolls around the Square du Temple.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>

<h2>Paris Winter Fashion: Les Hommes Parisiens Are Seductive, Sexy, Cool</h2> 
<p>January 16, 2012 &nbsp;by Paige Bradley Frost</p> 
<h6><em>Christopher Hue</em></h6> 
<p>Paris is known for many things: its light, its bistros and, of course, its 
fashionably chic women. But what about its men? Do<em>les hommes parisiens</em> 
share that certain<em>je ne sais quoi</em> for which their female counterparts 
are so admired?</p> 
<p>Alas, in a word, <em>non</em>.</p> 
<p>Parisian men do, however, have distinctive style that manages to marry the 
rakish allure of Vincent Cassel or Olivier Martinez with the more bourgeois 
appeal of, say, Francois Cluzet. In short, his cool charm derives from an 
unstudied, imperfect look that works without looking overworked. Matchy-matchy, 
perfectly pressed and impeccably coordinated is just un-Parisian.</p> 
<h6><em>Annelie Willemijn</em></h6> 
<p>Here are some hallmarks of Parisian style <em>pour homme</em>, as seen on 
the city&rsquo;s streets this chilly season.</p> 
<p><em>Le foulard</em>: There may be no look more &ldquo;French&rdquo; than an 
artfully tied scarf. Men are rarely seen in Paris without stylish neck wear 
&mdash; rain or shine. From the classic Burberry check to sumptuous cashmere or 
printed cotton, a casually wrapped neck is simply a must.</p> 
<p><em>Les chaussures</em>: Men&rsquo;s shoes have gone narrow and pointy; 
classics like leather oxfords and sporty suede bucks have seemingly been 
stretched. A gently pointed toe is the only shoe shape that looks<em>right</em> 
right now. For weekends<em>en ville</em>, swap out the dress shoes for a 
well-worn pair of<em> tennis</em> &mdash; Puma or Adidas, please.</p> 
<h6><em></em><em>Annelie Willemijn</em></h6> 
<p><em></em><em></em><em>Les pantalons</em>: Athletes with ample quads, 
beware: Modern Parisian trousers are<em>tr&egrave;s</em> slim cut. Like those 
spotted on fashionable Parisiennes, slim-cut dark wash jeans for men can go 
almost anywhere in Paris these days. Worn with a tailored blazer or fine-knit 
sweater (think body-hugging),<em>un jean</em> works just as well for<em> </em>a 
stroll through the Centre Pompidou as it does for a dinner at a swank bistro. 
Whether it&rsquo;s jeans, chinos or wool trousers, keep the cut close; a flared 
leg or tailored cuff is a definite style don&rsquo;t.Continue

<h2>HiP Paris Holiday Gift Guide: La Tartine Gourmande B&eacute;atrice Peltre
</h2> 
<p>December 22, 2011 &nbsp;by Beatrice Peltre</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><em>L&rsquo;Art de la Table</em> (literally translating as &ldquo;The Art 
of the Table&rdquo;) is probably as much about food as it is about having 
beautiful table linens and dinnerware, tasteful flowers, and colorful table 
accessories to enhance the dining experience. No wonder the French love to 
gather around tables to eat. No wonder that, after growing up in a 
food-obsessed family, I, too, love to give gifts that focus attention around 
the celebration of a meal.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In France, gorgeous-looking kitchen stores filled with beautiful dinnerware 
and designer linens can be found everywhere. During the holidays, they are 
favorite spots to find precious gifts to celebrate our love for beautifully 
presented foods. Brand names likeLe Jacquard Fran&ccedil;ais specialize in the 
art of dressing up a dining table with beautiful and colorful patterned 
tablecloths and napkins&mdash;I am a fan. What&rsquo;s not to love about a 
gorgeous-looking table setting with scrumptious food at its center?</p>

<h2>Foodie Christmas Gifts: Five French-Inspired Cookbooks</h2> 
<p>December 21, 2011 &nbsp;by Maggie Battista</p> 
<p><em>French Feasts, Dutch Oven (Ames Lai)</em></p> 
<p>Christmas is four days away <em>et bien s&ucirc;r</em>, I am quite tardy in 
purchasing some very special gifts for the very special people in my life.</p> 
<p>Since I work for a company that rents boutique Parisian flats, I do tend to 
gift friends and family with French-inspired goodies, items that will inject 
the everyday life with a bit of<em>la vie fran&ccedil;aise</em>. Better yet, if 
those goodies can be French food-inspired, I&rsquo;m practically guaranteed<em>
une note de gratitude</em> before the ball drops on New Year&rsquo;s.</p> 
<p>Alas, time is of the essence and a quick trip to Paris is not in the cards 
before Christmas. But I can still be the belle of their hearts and kitchens by 
gifting an old standby: a favorite French cookbook, with all the most delicious 
recipes well-marked, and a quickly-assembled glass jar of<em>sel de mer</em>, 
glistening and studded with herbs de Provence.</p> 
<p><em>Drying Herbs (Porter Palmer), Salt (Little Brown Pen)</em></p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re also delayed in holiday shopping, I don&rsquo;t mind if you 
take my idea and make it your own. In fact, I&rsquo;ve got your back with my 
favorite French-inspired cookbooks of 2011. Just don&rsquo;t say I never gave
<em>you</em> anything&hellip;</p> 
<p>1. &nbsp;Based on the sweet boutiques in San Francisco, <strong>Miette: 
Recipes from San Francisco&rsquo;s Most Charming Pastry Shop</strong> is a 
darling cookbook filled with scalloped pages of classic tart, cake and cookie 
recipes. I can imagine gifting this girly book with everything needed to make 
owner, chef and author Meg Ray&rsquo;s famous Tomboy Cake, pictured on the 
book&rsquo;s cover.</p> 
<p><em>Miette (Yuichi Sakuraba, A Baked Creation)</em></p> 
<p><em>Miette (Violet Blue)</em></p> 
<p>2. I was at a gala celebrating Jacque Pepin&rsquo;s contribution to 
culinaria recently and while he had a last minute hiccup that prevented his 
appearance, his new cookbook<strong>Essential Pepin: More Than 700 All-Time 
Favorites from My Life in Food</strong> stood in for him proudly. Delivered 
with some very good chocolate to make his version of Chocolate Mousse, this 
cookbook would be a prized possession.</p>

<h2>HiP Paris Holiday Gift Guide: Alexia Hollinger&rsquo;s Pia Bag</h2> 
<p>December 20, 2011 &nbsp;by Pia Jane Bijkerk</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Not only are Alexia Hollinger&lsquo;s handbags&nbsp;<em>tr&egrave;s chic,
</em> and<em> tr&egrave;s Parisien</em>, but they are made right in the heart 
of the city by Alexia herself, in her gorgeous studio boutique on quiet rue 
Therese in the 1st&nbsp;arrondissement. I discovered her boutique about 4 years 
ago when I was researching for my first bookParis: Made by Hand. When I walked 
into the beautifully decorated store and saw Alexia working away on her sewing 
machine in the back room, it felt like I&rsquo;d struck gold &ndash; this was 
exactly what I&rsquo;d hoped to find in the heart of Paris, and all it took was 
a wander off the main thoroughfare and into a leafy avenue.</p> 
<h6> <em>Rue Therese Paris</em></h6> 
<p>Alexia&rsquo;s designs are sophisticated but practical &ndash; every time I 
visit Paris, I stop into Alexia&rsquo;s boutique and buy a bag for myself and 
another as a gift. I have quite the collection of Alexia bags now, almost one 
for each day of the week. Her bags make the ideal gift and if you can&rsquo;t 
make it into the boutique yourself, then you can easily buy a bag from her 
latest collectiononline as Alexia ships all over the world.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I was&nbsp;honored&nbsp;a few months back to find out Alexia had named one 
of her new designs after me &ndash; featured here in this post is one of her 
gold linen &ldquo;pia&rdquo; bags. Inside there is a pocket for your phone, a 
key clip, and zip pocket for personal items. It&rsquo;s the perfect size and I 
love that the handles fit over the shoulder.</p>

<h2>HiP Paris Holiday Gift Guide: Amy Thomas Shops at Monoprix</h2> 
<p>December 19, 2011 &nbsp;by Amy Thomas</p> 
<h6><em>Evil Genius Society</em></h6> 
<p>Paris is one of the most dangerous cities to go gift-shopping. I mean, when 
you&rsquo;re looking for the perfect piece of the City of Light to share with 
your family and friends, how can you resist the soaps at Fragonard, the pottery 
and notebooks at Astier de Villatte, the cool kid CDs at Colette or the<em>
boites</em> of macarons and chocolates all over town&mdash;for yourself?</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to be greedy around such lovely loot. For better or worse, 
the price tags keep some of the madness in check. But there&rsquo;s another way 
to work around this fair city that&rsquo;s<em>tr&egrave;s cher:</em> Monoprix.
</p> 
<h6><em>Cbertel</em></h6> 
<p>Seriously! If you think about the delicacies and delights we all savor in 
Paris, you can find some real steals right at your neighborhood grocer. Take, 
for example, the pajama aisle. They may not be as&nbsp;<em>raffin&eacute;</em> 
as what you&rsquo;d find at Le Bon March&eacute;, but the options are pretty 
darn cute, nonetheless. (Don&rsquo;t forget the matching slippers.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h6><em>Risastla</em></h6> 
<p>For the men in your life, grab some jars of mustard and tins of sardines. 
They&rsquo;re compact, come in infinite varieties, and pack a delicious punch 
per centime. Or, in the &ldquo;personal goods&rdquo; section, you can find 
lovely big blocks of olive oil soap, which are great &ldquo;man gifts.&rdquo;

<h2>HiP Paris Holiday Gift Guide by Yvette Van Boven: Le Petit Atelier de Paris
</h2> 
<p>December 16, 2011 &nbsp;by Yvette Van Boven</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As soon as our timetable lets us go, my husband and I move from our base in 
Amsterdam to our tiny apartment in Paris.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve lived here in Paris part time for more than 4 years now, but I 
still discover new places, neighborhoods, and restaurants every single time we 
go on a stroll. Paris is inexhaustible when it comes to surprising me in any 
unexpected ways.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My dear friend, stylist, photographer and author Pia Jane Bijkerk, used to 
live here too, and she wrote a wonderful guide that everyone should have when 
they go to Paris. It&rsquo;s a little book that takes you on a tour of 
Paris&rsquo; best shops and ateliers for handmade goods. So that&rsquo;s right 
up my alley, of course.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One of the places she lists is <em>Le Petit Atelier de Paris</em>, so of 
course I went.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>

<h2>Christmas in the City of Lights: Seeking Out Paris&rsquo; Holiday Cheer
</h2> 
<p>December 15, 2011 &nbsp;by Victoria Wall</p> 
<h6><em>Mic Mac</em></h6> 
<p>When I popped home to the UK in November, London was already in full 
festive swing with Christmas trees, festive songs and neon lights galore. Sent 
back with a Cadbury&rsquo;s chocolate advent calendar adorned with an oversized 
Santa, I was ready to start the Christmas season with a bang.</p> 
<h6><em>Making Magique</em></h6> 
<p>Yet once back home across the pond, I realized Paris hadn&rsquo;t joined in 
on the fun yet. I was ready to start in on my advent calendar and temperatures 
were plunging, but where were all those tell tale signs that our favorite 
mid-winter festival was fast approaching?</p> 
<p>This set me thinking. What exactly is a Parisian Christmas? What happens in 
the cold windy days leading up to the big event? I set out on a mission to 
discover the seasonal delights that France&rsquo;s most romantic city had to 
offer.</p> 
<h6><em>Little Brown Pen</em></h6> 
<p><strong>Shopping</strong></p> 
<p>Although the Christmas shopping frenzy begins relatively late in Paris 
(thankfully, shops only step into gear at the end of November), once it gets 
going, it really gets going. Stores go all out with light shows and 
designer-crafted window displays &ndash; always tasteful,<em>bien sur</em>. 
First stop? Paris&rsquo;s iconic department stores. Whilst London has 
toy-filled Hamleys and elegant Harrods, Paris showcases its trademark 
sophistication with Les Galleries Lafayette and the neighbouring Printemps, 
where Karl Lagerfeld&rsquo;s touch marks this year&rsquo;s displays: think 
Chanel-clad rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll dolls strumming their electric guitars 
and 20m Christmas trees.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>

<h2>HiP Paris Holiday Gift Guide: Clotilde Dusoulier Loves Opinel Knives</h2> 
<p>December 14, 2011 &nbsp;by Clotilde Dusoulier</p> 
<h6><em>Tiago Pereira</em></h6> 
<p>I got my first Opinel pocket knife at age seven&mdash;the age of reason, my 
parents must have thought&mdash;during a summer vacation in the French Alps. 
Each member of my family had one, and they got plenty of use during mountain 
hikes: my father&rsquo;s to carve intricate pattern on his walking stick, my 
mother&rsquo;s to butter the baguette sandwiches when we stopped for the midday 
picnic.</p> 
<p>I was thrilled to get my own, a tiny, child-size replica of the classic 
Savoyard pocket knife, with its glossy wood handle, its pointy steel blade, and 
the rotating ring that locked it all into place.</p> 
<p>Twenty-five years later, this miniature Opinel is much too small for me to 
use, but I have a grownup&rsquo;s version now, which I&rsquo;m sure to take 
with me on any walk in the wild, and especially on mushroom foraging trips: not 
to brag, but that Opinel has seen its share of porcini.</p> 
<h6><em>Kaspar Metz</em></h6> 
<p>Opinel pocket knives make for wonderful gifts, too: they&rsquo;re not at 
all expensive, they&rsquo;ll last a lifetime, and they&rsquo;ll accompany the 
recipient on their outdoor adventures&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s just an 
improvised picnic in the park. Just be sure to have them give you a coin (any 
small piece of change will do) in exchange for the knife: French superstition 
states that if you give away a knife without getting anything in return, you 
risk severing the friendship.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>
