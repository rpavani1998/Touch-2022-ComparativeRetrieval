<h1> London ranked number one shopping city in Europe</h1> <br>

<h2>Economist Intelligence Unit reveals London is the best city for tourists 
who like to shop, scoring top marks for variety of goods, cultural attractions 
and accessibility</h2> 
<p>November 2011 &ndash; London took the crown in the Globe Shopper City Index 
&ndash; Europe, a new Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) research program, 
sponsored by Global Blue, the experts in international shopping and spending 
around the world. Overtaking strong competition from cities including Madrid, 
Barcelona, Berlin, Paris and Rome, London scored top marks for variety of 
shopping districts and goods, accessibility and cultural attractions. The 
EIU&rsquo;s Globe Shopper City Index &ndash; Europe measures the attractiveness 
of 33 major European cities for international travel shopping. Each city was 
ranked according to 38 criteria grouped into five categories: shops, 
affordability, convenience, hotels and transport, and culture and climate.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Globe Shopper City Index &ndash; Europe is a significant step in 
Global Blue&rsquo;s strategy to become the go-to brand for everything to do 
with international shopping and spending around the world,&quot; said Per 
Setterberg, CEO of Global Blue. &quot;This Index will help retailers and 
shopping brands make better business decisions, while the online Globe Shopper 
City Index will enable travellers to discover their ideal shopping city based 
on their personal priorities.&quot;</p> 
<p>Commenting on the research, Robin Bew, Editorial Director and Chief 
Economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit said, &quot;The Globe Shopper City 
Index &ndash; Europe sheds light on which European cities are best placed to 
take advantage of the continent&rsquo;s reputation among international 
consumers. The findings show that the right balance between convenience, 
availability and price is essential for international travel shopping.&quot;</p>
<h2>London, a globe shopper&rsquo;s paradise </h2> 
<p>London&rsquo;s sheer variety of shopping districts and availability of 
goods earned it the best category score of 80.6 points out of 100. Famously, 
each London shopping district has its own distinct character, from Oxford 
Street and Regent Street to Knightsbridge, Saville Row, and Carnaby Street. 
Added to which famous markets such as, Covent Garden, Portobello Market and 
Camden Market offer a wealth of goods through small traders. London scored 
highest on the availability of international and local brands, 24 points ahead 
of second-placed Paris and almost 40 points ahead of third-placed Moscow.</p> 
<h2>Plenty to see and do&hellip; and easy to get to</h2> 
<p>The Index recognised London&rsquo;s excellent selection of cultural 
attractions available to tourists when taking a break from their shopping. The 
city came first or tied for first, for sights, events and even the variety of 
cuisine on offer, demonstrating how much the city has changed in recent 
decades. Finally, London is accessible. In 2010, the city had the most annual 
passenger flights of any Index city, at 950,000, which is nearly four times the 
Index average of 240,000, and 200,000 more than the next city on the list, 
Paris.</p> 
<p>Visitors to London at the newly opened Westfield Stratford City explained 
why they had been drawn to the centre&rsquo;s 1.9 million sq ft of retail 
space. Sarah Jareovich, 25, from Lithuania, who had spent &pound;1,000 on her 
&quot;retail holiday&quot;, said: &quot;We are here because we heard it&rsquo;s 
the biggest in Europe.&quot; Also shopping in Westfield was Gemma Roig, a 
regular visitor to London, and her friend Blanca de Gispert &quot;In Spain 
it&rsquo;s cheaper but here there are more different kinds of shops and 
clothes,&quot; Ms Roig said. &quot;[But] Usually we go to Oxford Street because 
it is closer to the centre.&quot;</p>
