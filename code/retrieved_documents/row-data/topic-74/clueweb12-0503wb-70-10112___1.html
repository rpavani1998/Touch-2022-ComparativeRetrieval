<h1>London, Paris &amp; Rome</h1> 
<h2>11 Days from $2,659* USD</h2> 
<p>Now includes ALL government taxes &amp; fees!</p> <br>

<h3>Shopping</h3> <strong>London:</strong> <br>
For just about anyone 
traveling to London, shopping has been relegated to souvenir or special item 
shopping due to the rising currency exchange. Though you aren't likely to find 
a bargain when shopping in London, you will find some interesting souvenirs, 
and there are some great markets for that are worth checking out whether you 
plan to buy something or not.<br>
<br>
London is on par with New York and Paris 
as a major fashion capital in the world, and there are overwhelming amounts of 
shopping options. Regent Street is one of the vital veins of this shopping 
network. Many of the most popular brand stores and bargain outlets can be found 
here. Nearby, department store enthusiasts will enjoy a stroll along either 
Oxford Street or Knightsbridge. These streets are home to the ever-popular 
Harrods and Harvey Nichols, both of which are insanely appealing for local and 
foreign shoppers. Some English goods to look for include Wedgewood and Royal 
Doulton porcelain, teas, jams, teddy bears, and just about anything else from 
Harrod's.<br>
<br>
<strong>Paris: <br>
</strong>If you like to shop Paris, 
France is the capital of the shopping world. The variety and style of the 
stores makes a Paris shopping trip a must for any fashion-conscious traveler. 
In Paris shopping is an art. Parisians take fashion very seriously, so shopping 
in Paris can be savored and enjoyed as much as a meal in one of the 
city&rsquo;s many excellent restaurants or a visit to one of its world-class 
museums.<br>
<br>
Shopping in Paris can be done on any budget. All the best 
designers have boutiques in Paris, and many are worth a visit just to breathe 
in the elegance or to get an idea of the latest styles before heading to a more 
affordable department store or flea market. Shopping in Paris is a serious 
affair, though. Don&rsquo;t expect a friendly welcome if you are wearing 
shorts, sneakers, or a printed t-shirt, don&rsquo;t touch displays, and be sure 
to ask for assistance with a polite &ldquo;s&rsquo;il vous plait.&rdquo; Most 
stores in Paris are closed on a Sunday, so you may want to take that day to 
explore one of the city&rsquo;s flea markets. These offer the best shopping in 
Paris for those on a shoestring budget.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rome: </strong> <br>

Like the city, shopping in Rome is varied. For the most part though, Rome's 
shops seem to cater to a more egalitarian crowd than the other major cities. 
The city&rsquo;s most exclusive and high-end boutiques reside within a stone's 
throw of the famous Spanish Steps. These shops, like the high percentage of 
those found in the famous shopping districts of Italy, are designed for the 
obscenely wealthy.<br>
<br>
Rome is full of remnants of the past - from the 
ruins to the art to the ancient cathedrals and town squares &ndash; and the 
shopping is no different, with a vast accumulation of antiques awaiting your 
perusal. The interminable street of Via del Corso is a focal point of any Italy 
shopping tour, and contains a number of chic boutiques (and plenty of less-chic 
ones for the budget conscious) that cater mostly to the vibrant Roman youth. 
Rome also has the widest selection of neighborhood markets, where you can 
casually peruse everything from fresh fruit to hand-crafted goods.<br>
