<h1>London &amp; Paris City Stay (13 days)</h1> 
<h2>13 Days from $3,007* USD</h2> 
<p>Now includes ALL government taxes &amp; fees!</p> <br>

<h3>Transportation / Walking on tour</h3> Round-trip flights arrive in London 
and depart from Paris. Your transfer upon arrival in London is provided by 
SkyShuttle transfer service, and you can find them at a desk when you make your 
way through customs and baggage. There is an included transfer on the 
high-speed Eurostar train from London to Paris. All other transportation on 
&ldquo;London &amp; Paris City Stay&rdquo; is by private motorcoach.<br>
<br>

In your free time, you may wish to explore the two cities by public 
transportation. London&rsquo;s tube system, consisting of 12 lines, needs no 
introduction. Tickets and passes can be purchased in singles or in bulk. London 
also has an extensive bus system. Paris&rsquo; massive M&eacute;tro is 
world-class, easy to navigate and efficient. Make sure to take time and look 
for the best deal on travel passes. Ask your tour director which one might work 
best. Often the daily passes are not actually the best deal. <br>
