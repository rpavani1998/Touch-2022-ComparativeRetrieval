<h2>Paris, New York or Rome: set your sights on a big city</h2>  Overseas 
cities are becoming a favourite with London second-home buyers who want to 
enjoy another vibrant lifestyle and a great rental return, says Cathy Hawker<br>
 &copy; Eric Nathan/Alamy<br>
Paris from the summit of the Arc de Triomphe <br>

Ever since Dick Whittington fell for the story that the streets of London were 
paved with gold, cities have exerted a strong gravitational pull. Gold may not 
be in abundance but culture is on tap, the populations are often cosmopolitan 
and youthful, and opportunity can often be found around every corner.<br>
<br>

Cities occupy two per cent of the earth yet are home to 53 per cent of the 
world's population, a figure predicted to reach 75 per cent by 2050.<br>
<br>

For discerning overseas home buyers, too, cities have become more attractive. 
While sun, sea and sand were once the overwhelming reasons to buy abroad, 
figures from Knight Frank show that 37 per cent of second homes are now in 
cities. At the same time, buyers are more concerned than ever about rental 
returns, eager to find property to enjoy that will also provide some income. So 
where are the cities that combine alluring lifestyle with a potential rental 
jackpot?<br>
<br>

<h4>Top-performing cities</h4> <br>
Recent research from rental website 
holidaylettings.co.uk on the best-performing overseas cities for rental 
occupancy show<strong>New York</strong>, <strong>Paris</strong> and <strong>Rome
</strong> are the winners, achieving up to 45 weeks a year. That compares with 
prime summer sun destinations, such as Ibiza, where the occupancy norm is 
closer to 12 weeks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Both Paris and St Tropez have good renting 
seasons but while the season in southern France is April to October, Paris will 
perform better year-round,&quot; says Kate Stinchcombe-Gilles from Holiday 
Lettings. &quot;Good quality, well-located city apartments attract weekenders 
in any month.&quot;<br>
<br>
&pound;622,430: a two bedroom, high-ceiling flat 
in New York's Upper East Side (+1 212 606 7769<br>
Savills latest global 
research also demonstrates the strength of rental returns in the world's 
most-visited cities. New York and Paris are not seeing the stellar capital 
growth of New World cities such as Hong Kong or Singapore, yet they out perform 
those cities for rental yields. &quot;Our research shows average yields in New 
York and Paris are 6.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively,&quot; says 
Yolande Barnes of Savills Residential Research.<br>
<br>
&quot;Comparable 
property prices in Hong Kong are almost twice as expensive but rental yields 
are 3.1 per cent. New York property in particular looks good value at present 
with capital values still 15 per cent below their 2007 highs.&quot;<br>
<br>

<h4>New York - it's up to you</h4> <br>
The housing market in the US is bad, 
acknowledges Elizabeth Stribling of Savills Stribling, with New York prices 
back to levels last seen in 2005 - but the Big Apple has ridden out the storm 
better than elsewhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;New York has had few foreclosures and 
most buyers are cash purchasers,&quot; she adds. &quot;The cheaper dollar, 
coupled with more affordable prices than London or Paris, help the market.&quot;
<br> <br>
&pound;612,755: a renovated two-bedroom flat on the East Side, near 
Central Park (+1 212 606 7769)<br>
Today, a third of all new condo developments 
in New York are purchased by non-US buyers. They include Chinese who buy near 
universities for their children, Russians who choose large trophy properties, 
and hip Europeans spending &pound;640,000 in Brooklyn.<br>
<br>
Stribling has a 
two-bedroom apartment in Midtown Manhattan for &pound;800,000, while across the 
East River in Brooklyn an airy three-bedroom apartment is &pound;587,265. A 
handsome two-bedroom apartment close to the green expanse of Central Park is 
&pound;612,755 through Sotheby's.<br>
<br>

<h4>Weak Euro boosts Paris</h4> <br>
International demand is also driving the 
market in Paris where the weak euro is encouraging South Americans and Russians 
to snap up property. The city's compact historic centre and a lack of new 
developments conspire to keep the supply of accommodation low and prices high.
<br> <br>
&quot;Look at the edge of the Marais in the 4th arrondissement, the 
southern end of the 6th towards Luxembourg Gardens and the borders of the 1st 
and 2nd to find value,&quot; suggests Mark Harvey of Knight Frank. &quot;But 
keep in mind that property in the more edgy spots may have shabby communal 
areas. Ask who manages the building, and whether there is a sinking fund for 
renovation to avoid facing a large bill for repairs.&quot;<br>
<br>

&pound;511,300: a two-bedroom duplex flat in Parc Monceau, central Paris (020 
3040 8210)<br>
Chesterton Humberts has a two-bedroom apartment in the 
prestigious 8th arrondissement reduced from &pound;546,000 to &pound;511,300. A 
one-bedroom penthouse close to the Louvre is &pound;563,000 with Knight Frank. 
Rental yields are strong but owners should remember, properties let for less 
than a year require a permit.<br>
<br>

<h4>Homes in vibrant Rome</h4> <br>
A well-located Rome apartment rents for 40 
weeks each year according to Holiday Lettings figures, with Trastevere and the 
Centro Storico particularly popular. Average square-foot prices are &pound;950 
to &pound;1,210 with an elegant two-bedroom apartment in atmospheric Campo 
de'Fiori priced &pound;1.17 million, through Knight Frank.<br>
<br>
&quot;The 
Centro Storico is vibrant but noisy,&quot; says Cristina Casacci of Knight 
Frank. &quot;Parioli Pinciano, an upmarket residential area north-west of the 
centre with early 1900 buildings is more peaceful.&quot; Expect to pay from 
&pound;433,400 for a compact 540 sq ft flat in this hilly part of Rome close to 
the shady pine trees of Villa Borghese.<br>
<br>
A high-ceiling, two-bedroom 
apartment there is &pound;953,480 through Knight Frank. Near the Tiber in a 
period building on the grand Via Banchi Nuovi, Casa Travella has a 740sq ft 
second-floor apartment in a period building for &pound;736,780.<br>
