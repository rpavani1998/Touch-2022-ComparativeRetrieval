<h2>23 January 2012</h2> 
<h3>Obama taps young French talent to compose official 2012 campaign song 
What's More</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Who's got talent? French guys!!</strong></p> 
<p>According to Le Figaro, United States President Barak Obama has chosen two 
French composers from Bordeaux (yes, France!) to write his campaign theme song. 
The ditty, entitled What's More, was written byTony Jazz and Mathieu Billon, 
who, in addition to being young, very young, are immensely talented and 
energetic.</p> 
<p>Raised in the infamous 9-3, Jazz at 26 had already racked up credits at 
Universal and Sony and founded his own communications company specializing in 
musical design. Billon, also ridiculously young, is a case study in finding 
one's talents. After a DUT he entered a work-study (alternance) program at 
INSEEC Bordeaux with the hope of founding a restaurant. An internship in 
marketing at Kaizen Marketing Group opened up a whole new world for him, an 
&quot;American vision of entrepreneurship&quot; with bosses barely older than 
himself.</p> 
<p>One thing led to another and the two young French entrepreneurs met. In 
January last year Jazz and Billon created &quot;On Air Agency&quot;.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How did these two Frenchmen with no connections seduce the president of the 
United States?</p> 
<p>&quot;Talent,&quot; says le Figaro, &quot;Simplement du talent&quot;.</p> 
<p>A clip (see above) that Jazz made in honor of Obama's 2008 election caught 
the eye of Obama's campaign, which led to a meeting with Charles Rifkin, the US 
ambassador to France.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And the rest was history.</p> 
<p>A stunning acknowledgement of young French talent! &nbsp;</p>

<h2>07 December 2011</h2> 
<h3>Blogging in a time of great sorrow</h3> 
<p><br>
Politics, humor, literature, environment, and, in general the crazy 
goings on in France--these are the topics I relish writing about. Not my 
personal life.&nbsp;But, as some of you know, my mother passed away recently, 
less than four months after being diagnosed with metastatic melanoma, and my 
normal fields of inquiry seem small and uninspiring. The world--my world at 
least--is upside down, and it seems wrong not to acknowledge this.</p> 
<p>How wonderful my mother was I will write one day, when I have the skill and 
art to bring her unlikely and most extraordinary virtues to life.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For now my thoughts turn to the notion of the &quot;good&quot; death and 
the choices one must be ready to make to obtain it; to the Medicare divide in 
America (where 65+ are covered while 64- risk losing their home in case of 
illness);&nbsp;to the insane--and lucrative--war against medical marijuana; to 
the kindness of strangers;&nbsp;and to the difficult necessity of conducting 
normal life, even if one doesn't feel like it.</p> 
<p><em>What, </em>I asked fellow caregivers and friends,<em>&nbsp;is a good 
death?</em>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Well</em>, my brother said, <em>I think I'd like it to be a surprise
</em>.*&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An old friend and student of shamans said that when her time comes, she 
would like her children to take her to a beautiful place, prop her up against a 
tree and leave her to die alone in nature.</p> 
<p><em>I told my children that's what I wanted</em>, she said. &nbsp;<em>They 
were horrified and refused.</em>&nbsp;<em>But I was serious. That's how I want 
to die.</em></p> 
<p>Other people told me: <em>no pain. Just get it over with.</em> Or:<em> I 
want to talk to all my loved ones.</em>&nbsp;One person even told me that she 
<em>found death interesting and wanted to experience it fully. Lucidity,&nbsp;
</em>she said,<em> is crucial for me.</em></p> 
<p><em>How, </em>I asked a kind nurse who was helping us,<em> can you bear to 
do this,</em>meaning to get close to people as they are dying.</p> 
<p><em>Well</em>, she said, <em>you have to flip it. I don't see my job as 
working with death but as bringing people together. &nbsp;</em>And I thought of 
the subtle ways in which she had smoothed our path and realized this was true.
</p> 
<p>IN THE END there were many kind people, and my mother died in her home 
surrounded by family. But this did not spare us deep and violent disagreements 
about how best to proceed in the choice between serenity and lucidity.</p> 
<p>***</p> 
<p>How does the good death differ from person to person, from one place to 
another, from one age to another? These have become for me urgent questions, 
but ones I don't want to bore my friends with. So I am taking a little break.
</p> 
<p>Paris Writers News, Best Paris Stories and other ongoing projects will 
resume in January, 2012.</p>

<h3>Interview with Karen Fawcett, founder of Bonjour Paris</h3> 
<p>Journalist, editor, blogger, publisher, businesswoman, talent scout, 
Parisian and world traveler, Karen Fawcett is the president and founder of&nbsp;
Bonjourparis.com <em>The Definitive Guide to Paris</em>. I first had the 
pleasure of meeting Karen nearly 25 years ago, in one of her previous 
incarnations (and mine).</p> 
<p>Attention writers: the lady knows her business.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; <em><strong>Karen Fawcett</strong></em><br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Laurel Zuckerman : How did you get into journalism?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Karen Fawcett :</strong> I fell into it though the back door. When 
I was an interior designer in Washington, DC, the editor of the Sunday magazine
<em>Home-Life</em> of the <em>Washington Star</em> asked me to do some 
scouting. Fast forward: I became an ongoing features/cover story contributor 
who produced stories and entire editions for over three years.</p> 
<p>The articles focused on profiles of people in their homes, and designers 
and architects who realized their clients&rsquo; dreams. I loved it. When the
<em>Washington Star</em> folded in August 1981, I'd made more money as an 
ongoing contributor that year than I've seen since in all of my years of being 
a journalist.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After moving to France in 1988, I didn&rsquo;t have working papers, so I 
wrote for numerous print publications. My favorite was the (now defunct) 
&ldquo;Expat Abroad&rdquo; column for the international edition of<em>USA Today
</em>. While my husband was sitting in meetings in different parts of the 
world, I was out meeting and doing and asking so many &ldquo;none of my 
business&rdquo; questions. The articles were 600-2000 words in length. My (now 
deceased) husband earned considerably more money, but I had a far better time.
</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : What writers have influenced/inspired you the most?</strong>
</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;KF </strong>:&nbsp;I could say Paul Theroux and so many other 
great writers. The reality is the writers who've influenced me most were 
journalists who took an interest in my writing and who became mentors. Garry 
and George Clifford were friends and journalists who encouraged me when I was 
learning the craft. Bud Korengold was another generous mentor who opened doors 
in Paris and beyond in his role as the head of information for the US Embassy 
in Paris. Charlie Leocha, publisher of<em>Consumer Traveler</em> and director 
of the Consumer Travel Alliance, has taught me to be a more linear writer. 
Odile Hellier of the Village Voice bookstore in Paris has had a strong 
influence on my reading selections for the past 23 years, and reading a wide 
range of style and authors I hope has made me a better writer. I&rsquo;ve also 
been inspired by attending many authors&rsquo; readings.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : How do you apply your journalism skills to publishing <em>
BonjourParis</em>?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF </strong>: Today <em>BonjourParis</em> has an executive editor 
who oversees publication. She manages editors and writers who provide content 
that meets professional journalistic standards. I continue to write my column, 
news from France and occasional articles. I&rsquo;m focused on the bigger 
picture these days, such as expanding our readership, business and of course 
maintaining my professional network built over &ldquo;a few decades.&rdquo;</p> 
<p> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;LZ :&nbsp;How have you built a subscriber base?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;KF </strong>:&nbsp;Our subscriber base has gown over the 
years and is constantly expanding. Clearly, people come and go based on their 
interest in or travel to France. New website readers are asked to subscribe to 
the free newsletter, which is a double opt-in process. Others receive<em>
BonjourParis</em> stories as they are posted at the site via RRS feed or via 
our FACEBOOK page.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;LZ:&nbsp;What is your business model?</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;<em>BonjourParis </em>has always been part of what&rsquo;s new, which 
has required that we be very proactive and flexible to new developments in 
technology. In the beginning<em>BonjourParis</em> was part of the Internet from 
the day when AOL first allowed everyday users, not just techhies using code, to 
communicate. There were no templates for content management, which required us 
to hire professional code programmers. A paid staff provided content.</p> 
<p><em>BonjourParis</em> had very little online competition. AOL was the 
leader, the French were not at all engaged in the Internet (other than Minitel) 
and anyone who searched AOL Travel for information about France found<em>
BonjourParis</em> at AOL keyword: Bonjour on the Travel channel of AOL and 
Compuserve. We were heavily promoted by both. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>I hold journalist credentials issued by the French Government Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and am a foreign press member. Not only did the French ignore 
the Internet in those early days, they did not recognize online news providers 
and sites that provided original content as legitimate news sources. I fought 
for<em>BonjourParis</em> to be recognized as a serious news organization, and 
subsequently<em>BonjourParis</em> was the first Internet site officially 
recognized by the French government.</p> 
<p>Changes over the last five years alone have taught us to adapt quickly to 
change and be proactive when possible. For example, when organizations we work 
with&mdash;such as google&mdash;change rules and policies we must respond in 
kind. When technological advances such as apps, Smartphones and digital readers 
became increasingly popular in the past 5 years or so, we were forced to look 
at functionality as well as site design because such innovations affect how 
readers view our content.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Every business has what they define as limited resources and BP isn&rsquo;t 
Fodor&rsquo;s nor is it a blog. When family emergencies forced me to take a 
break several years ago, I was unable to make<em>BonjourParis</em> my top 
priority. I returned to find competition in blogs, true, but also a huge 
community of people so passionate about writing about France that they 
&ldquo;published&rdquo; their blogs even when their audience was a handful. 
And, surprisingly, many of our print &ldquo;competitors&rdquo;&mdash;some very 
fine publications&mdash;had folded because they didn&rsquo;t keep up with the 
times.</p> 
<p>We have some advertising and are grateful for it; we like providing info 
(even in advertising) that helps our readers find the best answers to their 
specific wants and needs. Our premium members pay $34.95 a year for their 
subscriptions and some perks.<em>BonjourParis</em> has affiliate relations that 
generate a modicum of income. Google ads (pitiful but something is better than 
nothing) and unless you&rsquo;re a sex site, forget about making real money. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : How do you recruit and keep talent?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF</strong> : Our writers come and go; and over the years, over 
than 14 contributors have ended up publishing books because they were 
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo; on<em>BonjourParis</em>. Because <em>BonjourParis</em> 
is a well-known content site, many published authors and up-and-coming writers 
have asked to be showcased on it. We&rsquo;ve found some very good writers in 
the blogosphere and twitterverse. But, we&rsquo;re always happy to be 
approached by more.</p> 
<p> <br>
<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : What do you look for in a writer?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF</strong> : &nbsp;Writers really need to know their subject, 
their readers&rsquo; needs and interests and have an original voice. The best 
travel writers possess curiosity, intelligence and the ability to anticipate 
what a reader wants to know before they even know they need to know it. Each 
and every writer needs an editor and they must accept that our editors will 
change a story to enhance Search Engine Optimization (SEO) that increases the 
likelihood a story will draw readers&mdash;vitally important for both the 
writer and<em>BonjourParis</em>. At times our editor invests significant time 
in coaching writers on Internet writing techniques, which are different than 
writing for static print. It&rsquo;s a definite art that involves strategic 
placement of optimized keywords and the like. We consider all of this in 
choosing writers and proposed story topics.</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : Can a writer learn style?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF</strong> :&nbsp;A writer can learn style and technique but it 
isn&rsquo;t accomplished in a day.&nbsp; They must be willing to work on their 
writing as a craft and it&rsquo;s not easy.</p> 
<p><strong>LZ</strong> : You are a political person, very abreast of current 
affairs, and yet you keep politics out of<em>BonjourParis</em>. Why?</p> 
<p><strong>KF</strong> : I am giggling here. You&rsquo;re right, I am 
extremely political but I learned (the hard way) not to express my personal 
beliefs. When the US invaded Iraq, I expressed my opinion and we lost half of 
our subscribers in one fell swoop. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Today we focus more on presenting the news from France without 
editorializing. And these stories get picked up and repeated, according to our 
site analytical reports.</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : What changes do you see in the business? Advice for writers 
starting out today?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF </strong>: Enormous changes are unfolding now.&nbsp; As we go to 
the digital age, there will be fewer books printed. On the positive side, 
writers who might not have been published before will have a chance to have 
their work read because it can be downloaded on demand.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Writers (and most especially freelancers) will earn substantially 
less than they would have earned 20 years ago. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;If you want to be a writer and have to live on what you earn, 
don&rsquo;t give up your day job until you are certain you can generate 
sufficient income.</p> 
<p><strong>LZ :&nbsp;You were a member of the Editorial Committee for the 
Paris Short Story Contest.&nbsp; What did you learn from the experience? Advice 
for future contributors?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF </strong>: Laurel, being on the editorial committee taught me a 
lot. First, people would not have submitted entries had they not perceived 
themselves as writers, so it was a self-selecting group. A few stories were 
immediate toss-outs. But, others had a lot of merit and could have been 
excellent with editing. Advice for writers: Say what is essential, do not use 
complex words when simple ones will convey the point and don&rsquo;t stray from 
your subject. Put the story away and return later to tighten what you&rsquo;ve 
written.</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : How important is it to you to follow your own instincts?&nbsp;
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF :</strong> I&rsquo;ve been doing it for a lot of years, which is 
one of the reasons<em>BonjourParis</em> has a real sense of community. But, no 
one&rsquo;s instincts are infallible and it&rsquo;s essential to listen to 
others&mdash; most especially as the industry is changing with such incredible 
rapidity.</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : Do you have a special work regimen? (Special schedule, special 
foods&hellip;)</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF </strong>: No, I wish I did.&nbsp; ;-)</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : What do you hope to achieve as a writer and a publisher?
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>KF</strong> : My hope is that <em>BonjourParis</em> will be 
recognized as the foremost online magazine about France. I am increasingly 
proud of each and every article published, but this wasn&rsquo;t always so. We 
are in the process of deleting those that don&rsquo;t make the grade and 
rewriting many that need improvement.</p> 
<p><strong>LZ : Of all your achievements, of what are you most proud?</strong>
</p> 
<p><strong>KF </strong>: That&rsquo;s a hard question. I am proud of so many. 
When it comes to<em>BonjourParis</em> however, it gives me great satisfaction 
that I still feel so passionate about living in and writing about France. And 
after all of these years,<em>BonjourParis</em> remains a site that continues to 
provide information to our many longtime readers with the help of many others.

<h3>FLASH : Hortense on Tuesday Night by Marie Houzelle honored by Narrative

<strong><strong>(extract) &quot;THIS 
YEAR&rsquo;S FAVORITE&nbsp;STORIES OF THE WEEK</strong></strong>
&nbsp;demonstrate that literary excellence and intense emotional experiences 
don&rsquo;t depend on length. In one short short story, two children look on as 
their mother faces a sudden life-threatening circumstance; and in another short 
short, love, politics, and desperation intertwine in a brief love affair. These 
pieces stand side by side with longer stories. In one<strong>a young French 
mother navigates the world of Paris intellectuals, with their complex ideas and 
casually passionate relationships</strong>; in another, a Soviet Jew competes 
in a chess tournament in Buenos Aires against Israelis, and the thought of 
defection tempts him. Together, these five stories represent vibrant work by 
emerging and established writers. We hope you enjoy them. &quot;

<h2>09 September 2011</h2> 
<h3>Rosa Rankin Gee and Jethro Turner talk about A Tale of Three Cities and 
the Bookclub at Le Carmen</h3> 
<p>A couple months ago I had the pleasure of meeting&nbsp;Rosa Rankin Gee
&nbsp;at the awards ceremony for the&nbsp;Paris Literary Prize Novella Contest
&nbsp;graciously organized by&nbsp;Shakespeare and Company&nbsp;and the De 
Groot Foundation.</p> 
<p><strong>  &nbsp;<br>
<em>Rosa Rankin Gee&nbsp;</em></strong></p> 
<p>Only 24 years old, Rosa had already been named one of Esquire magazine's 75 
Brilliant Young&nbsp;Brits&nbsp;2010 and had just won the<strong>Novella Contest
</strong>. She told me about two new projects she was launching with 
photographer-writer&nbsp;<strong>Jethro Turner</strong>: a literary magazine 
calledA Tale of Three Cities and a &ldquo;bookclub&rdquo; in a Paris bar called 
Le Carmen, where erstwhile strangers exchange books.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;<em><strong>Jethro Turner</strong></em></p> 
<p>The bookclub sounded like so much fun that I sent two young 
collaborators,&nbsp;Eve Zuckerman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nisha Somwang, to investigate. 
The scene, they said, was terrific. (See &ldquo;Paris Nightlife Goes Literary
&rdquo;)</p> 
<p>Somehow, amidst all the excitement, Rosa, Jethro and Eve found a quiet 
place to talk.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<em><strong>Eve Zuckerman</strong></em></p> 
<p><em><strong>INTERVIEW </strong>: Rosa Rankin Gee, winner of&nbsp;
Shakespeare and Company's Paris Literary Prize for Best Novella, and Jethro 
Turner, co-founder ofA Tale of Three Cities literary journal and the Bookclub 
at Le Carmen, &nbsp;talk with Eve Zuckerman, forParis Writers News.</em></p> 
<p><strong>Paris Writers News: Why the book club?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rosa Rankin Gee: </strong>We came out with this very simple idea 
together and it's been a way of bringing like-minded people together, meeting 
really interesting bookish, creative, intelligent young people, so it's 
perfect. Why it's been a success it that it's been a marriage of events that 
are normally far more stilted. A conventional book club in the English sense is 
eight people in a living room talking about one book. And this is a lot looser, 
more relaxed. There's alcohol involved, there's a far bigger crowd, there's 
music, there's DJs. I think it has been a happy marriage of giving weight to a 
normal night out.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;PWN : Are there more French or English people who attend?
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Jethro Turner:</strong> We find it's about 50-50 French and English 
speakers but then there are Italians, Germans, Portuguese people, so we have a 
nice mix. Some people do ask, &quot;do we have to bring a book in 
English?&quot; We say no, we want to encourage people to bring as many 
different books as possible.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>PWN : How did you get the word out about the Book Club?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rosa : </strong>&nbsp;We've been really lucky with PR. It's a 
lovely, warm, kind of wholesome idea. You can get a lot of mileage out of it. 
We've been in the New York Times, we've been in all of the Paris blogs. We 
cultivate very good relationships with them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>PWN : You invented a concept called solidism. What is it?</strong>
</p> 
<p><strong>Rosa : </strong>That goes hand in hand with the magazine and it 
works on two levels: the fact that we really value printed press and we're not 
going to have any of the content of the magazine online because we think that 
really affects the way we read and digest something. And also we believe in 
really specific things, you know?<strong>If you go on our website and click the 
triangle, you can read more about it.</strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong></p> 
<p><strong>PWN : &nbsp;I'm sorry but I own a Kindle.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rosa : &nbsp;</strong>Get out!</p> 
<p><strong>PWN : &nbsp;Is solidism also a reproach to younger people who are 
moving away from the book's physical form?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Jethro : </strong>I don't thing it's a reproach to young people in 
any way, it's just the idea of suggesting that there are already positive 
qualities to print and that it is the beauty of having physical objects and 
beautiful printed books. It's still a good useful thing to have. And I 
personally read on a Kindle and I go down on the record saying that. It's 
really really good for certain things. But for exchanging ideas between friends 
and swapping books, I don't think that it's going to take over. It's a great 
way of accessing content but the printed book still has its place.</p> 
<p><em>Le Carmen</em><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Rosa : </strong>The least we can do is fight back. Rather than 
sliding directly into everything being online and Kindles, some young people 
should at least stand up and say, there is value.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<em>Rosa jumps up all of a sudden.</em> &quot;Sassy!&quot; <em>She 
greets her friend and immediately turns back to apologize and continue the 
interview. Many of those coming tonight have heard of the Book Club through 
Jethro or Rosa, who greet their friends but also people they didn't know. Very 
quickly, it becomes difficult to find people who have not been welcomed by one 
or the other.</em></p> 
<p><strong>PWN : Back to the magazine, A Tale of Three Cities. How do you 
intend to select content? What are the characteristics you are looking for?
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rosa : </strong>To be perfectly honest, I'm editor in chief 
and...well, what we have in common, the reason why our magazine worked at 
university [research] is that we have similar aesthetic depths. And of course, 
these things come down to a matter of taste. We said what our taste is clearly 
in our manifesto and for us it's whether something is compatible with what we 
think is good. And I don't think we want to be prescriptive at all. We want to 
publish good work.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <br>
<strong>PWN : </strong>Rosa, in addition to co-founding A Tale of 
Three Cities, has also just won first prize for her novella, the ..... of Sark. 
What do you have planned next?</p> 
<p><strong>Rosa :</strong> We have lots of projects on the go, me and this 
boy, which are not all necessarily literary, some of them are to be kept 
secret. But my plan now is to finish the novella, make it as good as I can and 
then write a novel, probably set in Paris, but not one with Paris in the 
title.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>PWN : What language will a Tale of Three Cities be published in?
</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rosa :</strong> Because it's set in three cities of which the 
common language would be English and our editors are English, the magazine will 
be in English, but we want there to be a flavor of each city. For example, 
Ralph, who's the Berlin editor, writes short stories. Most of the stories are 
Berlin-based and they'll be a reference to the Tour de...., they'll be flashes 
of each language. I think you'll find we want to capture the essence of the 
city.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Jethro : </strong>Poems will be published with side by side 
translations and the original in English but longer fiction will tend to be in 
English.</p> 
<p> <br>
&nbsp;<strong>PWN : What kind of readership are you expecting? What 
are your objectives with the magazine?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Jethro and Rosa: </strong>Global domination.</p> 
<p><strong>Jethro :</strong> To engage with interesting, creative, young 
people in the three cities. To continue the links between what we think are the 
most interesting three cities in Europe at the moment for culture.</p> 
<p><strong>Rosa :</strong> I think it's really important to give young artists 
a platform. I've been lucky in that I've been published in mainstream 
publications but the reason we started the magazine is that there are so many 
young people, young writers, artists who just haven't had that first step. Once 
they've had that, they can go to other places.</p> 
<p><strong>Jethro : </strong>Print has a new value now as well because plenty 
of people are writing for blogs but people are really struggling to get 
printed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Rosa :</strong> And we all want to see our names in print.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PWN : Do you have any advice for young writers and artists?</strong>
</p> 
<p><strong>Rosa : </strong>If you're good, send your work to us!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
