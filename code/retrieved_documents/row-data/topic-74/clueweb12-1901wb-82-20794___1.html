<h3> Survey Says London is Better than Paris </h3> Do you believe that London 
is better than Paris? Following in the wake of London garnering the prestigious 
&quot;World's Best Destination&quot; award at the 17th annual World Travel 
Awards gala held November 7, 2010, comes that official finding from a survey 
commissioned by the French themselves.<br>
<br>
As chronicled by 
BreakingTravelNews.com on November 19, French officials have conceded that 
London offers a better tourism experience than Paris. The report, titled 
&ldquo;Twenty Four Hours in a Tourist Capital,&quot; was authorized by the 
Paris-Ile de France Regional Tourism Committee (CRT). It placed London first 
ahead of the five other European cities of Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, and Berlin.
<br> <br>
In the French report, London is accepted as the more impressive city 
in every aspect, from its restaurants and taxis to its landmarks such as 
Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, and the famous Tower of London. 
The findings come despite Parisians boasting that nowhere beats their 
restaurants and tourist attractions, such as the Eiffel Tower.<br>
<br>
In the 
survey London scored 82% for its welcome to visitors from abroad. This was 
followed by Paris and Amsterdam in joint second place on 79%. Madrid and Rome 
were tied at third, both with 76%, while Berlin was last with 74%.<br>
<br>

Undercover French investigators concluded that public transport inParis was 
poor, with tickets difficult to buy and the Metro old and dirty. Hotels scored 
74% compared with 89% for those in London.<br>
<br>
Committee head Jean-Pierre 
Blat said: &ldquo;The survey reflects reality. Paris knows how to welcome 
visitors but there are definite improvements to make.&rdquo; He also suggested 
the French were often the most critical of their own capital, which may explain 
the result.<br>
<br>
The main fault found in London was the lack of foreign 
languages. Mr Blat said: &ldquo;In Paris, besides French we speak English, 
Italian, and Spanish, while in London they only speak English.&rdquo;<br>
<br>

The BTN article also announced a new way to have access to travel information 
about London, with the launch of a new mobile site: London.mobi. The site is 
the latest in the line up of city guides from World Mobi, with over 800 cities 
in 200 countries listed, including Brussels.Mobi, Sanfrancisco.Mobi and 
Sydney.Mobi.<br>
<br>
World Mobi guides include user reviews and traveler 
utilities such as a translation guide, currency converter, news and local 
weather guide. Other key features include information on accommodation, 
restaurants, attractions, entertainment, nightlife, shopping, and transport.<br>

<h2>Timeshare Resort vs. Hotel</h2> <br>
Many travelers are unaware that 
renting timeshare units are far superior to hotel rooms in comfort and price, 
especially for families and large groups.<br>
<br>
A typical hotel gets you one 
room with a bed and a bathroom. Most timeshare resorts, however, feature 
multiple bedrooms and bathrooms, living room, kitchen, dining area, and many 
have resort activities and amenities not found at hotels.<br>
