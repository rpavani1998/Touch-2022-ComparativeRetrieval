 London <br>
 London just isn't what it used to be. 
It's better! A blend of old and new, pace and buzz alongside peace and 
tranquility, and an amazingly diverse cultural scene. The sounds of Brit-pop 
and techno pour out of Victorian pubs; experimental theater is popping up on 
stages built for Shakespeare's plays; and Brits are even running the couture 
houses of Dior and Givenchy. In food, fashion, film, music, the visual arts, 
and just about everything else, London stands at the cutting edge again, just 
as it did in the 1960s. But rest assured that traditional London survives.

 Paris <br>
 Paris assaults the senses, 
demanding to be seen, heard, touched, tasted and smelled. Gaze impressive 
monuments and savor its gourmet pastiche of cheese, chocolate, wine and 
seafood. Paris is a city of vast perspectives and intimate streets, of formal 
espaces verts (green open spaces) and of quiet squares. Paris is relatively 
small as capitals go, with distances between many of its major sights and 
museums invariably walkable. Unforgettable walks exhibiting the best of Paris: 
stroll down the Champs-Elysees for the chic grand boulevard experience and Rue 
Cler for a more intimate snapshot of Parisian living.  Paris <br>

Barcelona<br>
 Barcelona - Spain's second city - is always on the biting edge 
of fashion, architecture, food, style, music and good times. Barcelona is one 
of the most dynamic and exciting cities on the western Mediterranean seaboard. 
Walk its narrow streets and wonderful plazas and discover its magic: stalls 
full of books, birds and flowers. Explore its new modern squares, designed by 
leading artists such as Mir&oacute; and Barcel&oacute; and every visitor will 
understand how Barcelona has been transformed into one of the most moderns and 
active cities in Europe.  Barcelona <br>

 Customer Feedback  Our third great trip with European 
Destinations. This time we visited London, Paris, and Barcelona. Luckily we had 
great weather for late November. The hotels in Paris (Manufacture) and 
Barcelona (Silken) definitely exceeded expectations. Both had terrific staff, 
rooms and service. The hotel in London (Garden View) was fine. The hotel 
provided breakfast but I would recommend skipping it. Still it was pretty and 
it a nice location. - The flights to and from New York were comfortable. We 
loved (and definitely recommend) the night train from Paris to Barcelona. We 
upgraded to a private room which came with a wonderful breakfast at sunrise. It 
was a perfect way to reach Barcelona and the upgrade didn`t add a lot to the 
cost of the trip. We`re already researching our next trip with you!  MARY JANE
