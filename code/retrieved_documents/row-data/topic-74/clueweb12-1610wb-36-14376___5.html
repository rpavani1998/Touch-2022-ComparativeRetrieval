<br>
 Edinburgh <br>
 Edinburgh has an 
almost fairy-tale setting and every step is a revelation. Its magnificent 
architecture shifts from the proud tenements of its medieval Old Town, to the 
grace and geometric precision of the Georgian New Town. Above it all stands 
Edinburgh Castle perched high on its volcanic rock looking down on a city where 
medieval lanes and elegant, sweeping terraces hold over ten centuries of 
history, mystery and tradition.  Edinburgh <br>

 London <br>
 London just isn't what it used to be. It's better! A 
blend of old and new, pace and buzz alongside peace and tranquility, and an 
amazingly diverse cultural scene. The sounds of Brit-pop and techno pour out of 
Victorian pubs; experimental theater is popping up on stages built for 
Shakespeare's plays; and Brits are even running the couture houses of Dior and 
Givenchy. In food, fashion, film, music, the visual arts, and just about 
everything else, London stands at the cutting edge again, just as it did in the 
1960s. But rest assured that traditional London survives.  London <br>

 Paris<br>
 Paris assaults the senses, demanding to be seen, heard, touched, 
tasted and smelled. Gaze impressive monuments and savor its gourmet pastiche of 
cheese, chocolate, wine and seafood. Paris is a city of vast perspectives and 
intimate streets, of formal espaces verts (green open spaces) and of quiet 
squares. Paris is relatively small as capitals go, with distances between many 
of its major sights and museums invariably walkable. Unforgettable walks 
exhibiting the best of Paris: stroll down the Champs-Elysees for the chic grand 
boulevard experience and Rue Cler for a more intimate snapshot of Parisian 
living.  Paris <br>

 Customer Feedback  Overall, 
the vacation was fantastic. All airfare arrangements were as promised and were 
on time as well as the arranged train travel. We had five people in our party 
and were traveling with two rooms reserved... on with three people including a 
10yo... We requested a separate bed and a larger room and all hotels delivered 
on this sometimes tricky request.  Scot Andrew Drake  Read 2 other feedbacks
