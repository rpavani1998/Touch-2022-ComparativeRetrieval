<h2>Expat Special: What To Do With One Month in Paris</h2> 
<p>January 30, 2012 &nbsp;by Nicole Gustin</p> 
<h6><em>Piyapat Ch</em></h6> 
<p>You&rsquo;re about to realize your dream: living in Paris for a month. You 
found an apartment, booked your flight, and learned how to ask for<em>les 
toilettes.</em></p> 
<p>You imagine strolling through the city, taking in the sights, hanging out 
at caf&eacute;s, and being&hellip;Parisian.&nbsp; Of course, part of the fun of 
travel is making new friends. As much as we love French hospitality, local 
Parisians and expats aren&rsquo;t always hanging out in caf&eacute;s looking 
for tourists to befriend. If your plan was to strike up conversation with the 
local artists over espresso at your neighborhood bistrot, you might want to 
think up a slightly more elaborate back-up plan. Just in case.</p> 
<h6><em>Michel NGUYEN; Yuwen Teo</em></h6> 
<p>Plus, maybe your idea of Paris includes escaping the tourist traps and 
discovering truly local haunts &ndash; great live music at an otherwise 
unassuming dive bar, or a fantastic meal at your neighborhood restaurant. With 
a dash of creativity, there are plenty of original ways to meet people and 
experience a little of the true Paris. Here are a few ideas:Continue

<h2>Decoding The French Menu: The Truth About Steak &agrave; Cheval</h2> 
<p>January 24, 2012 &nbsp;by Tory Hoen</p> 
<h6><em>A Paris chalkboard menu &ndash; appearances can be deceiving! (Daxis)
</em></h6> 
<p>Years into my love affair with Paris, I&rsquo;m still making ridiculous 
rookie mistakes. I suppose it&rsquo;s time to accept that France will always 
have the upper hand, but it still stings.</p> 
<p>My most recent humiliation is horse-related. Or at least, I thought it was.
</p> 
<p>Please note that I was a horse-obsessed child, so equine-related topics are 
particularly touchy for me. As a child, I would sometimes dress in riding garb 
for no reason at all. And while I was waiting for my parents to break down and 
buy me a real horse (never happened), I would drag garbage cans into the 
backyard and ride them, periodically switching from one member of the 
&ldquo;herd&rdquo; to the next. On any given afternoon, people in the house 
could gaze out and see me whipping a particularly stubborn garbage can with my 
riding crop.</p> 
<h6><em>Steak &agrave; Cheval (L. Richarz)</em></h6> 
<p>So when I first moved to Paris and started noticing &ldquo;<em>steak 
&agrave; cheval</em>&rdquo; on menus around town, I was wary. I knew there was 
a historical precedent of eating horse meat in France, but it seemed quite 
inhumane in this day and age. Nonetheless,&nbsp; I assumed it was some kind of 
trendy gastronomic revival, and who was I to question the local gourmands? So I 
kept my mouth shut and simply avoided the dreaded horse steak when confronted 
with it.</p> 
<p>Recently, I was visiting my boyfriend&rsquo;s family in Brazil. One night, 
we sat down to dinner and I was presented with a traditional dish called<em>
bife a cavalo</em> (in Portuguese), which translates to &ldquo;horse-riding 
steak&rdquo; or &ldquo;steak &agrave; la horse.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Horse?&rdquo; I asked, panic rapidly setting in.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s like <em>steak &agrave; cheval </em>in France,&rdquo; 
G explained.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Sooo&hellip;.. horse?&rdquo; I wondered again.</p> 
<p>It was at this point that I realized I&rsquo;d been operating under a 
serious misapprehension, and it took the collision of three cultures for the 
truth to surface.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p> <br>

<h2>Paris Winter Fashion: Les Hommes Parisiens Are Seductive, Sexy, Cool</h2> 
<p>January 16, 2012 &nbsp;by Paige Bradley Frost</p> 
<h6><em>Christopher Hue</em></h6> 
<p>Paris is known for many things: its light, its bistros and, of course, its 
fashionably chic women. But what about its men? Do<em>les hommes parisiens</em> 
share that certain<em>je ne sais quoi</em> for which their female counterparts 
are so admired?</p> 
<p>Alas, in a word, <em>non</em>.</p> 
<p>Parisian men do, however, have distinctive style that manages to marry the 
rakish allure of Vincent Cassel or Olivier Martinez with the more bourgeois 
appeal of, say, Francois Cluzet. In short, his cool charm derives from an 
unstudied, imperfect look that works without looking overworked. Matchy-matchy, 
perfectly pressed and impeccably coordinated is just un-Parisian.</p> 
<h6><em>Annelie Willemijn</em></h6> 
<p>Here are some hallmarks of Parisian style <em>pour homme</em>, as seen on 
the city&rsquo;s streets this chilly season.</p> 
<p><em>Le foulard</em>: There may be no look more &ldquo;French&rdquo; than an 
artfully tied scarf. Men are rarely seen in Paris without stylish neck wear 
&mdash; rain or shine. From the classic Burberry check to sumptuous cashmere or 
printed cotton, a casually wrapped neck is simply a must.</p> 
<p><em>Les chaussures</em>: Men&rsquo;s shoes have gone narrow and pointy; 
classics like leather oxfords and sporty suede bucks have seemingly been 
stretched. A gently pointed toe is the only shoe shape that looks<em>right</em> 
right now. For weekends<em>en ville</em>, swap out the dress shoes for a 
well-worn pair of<em> tennis</em> &mdash; Puma or Adidas, please.</p> 
<h6><em></em><em>Annelie Willemijn</em></h6> 
<p><em></em><em></em><em>Les pantalons</em>: Athletes with ample quads, 
beware: Modern Parisian trousers are<em>tr&egrave;s</em> slim cut. Like those 
spotted on fashionable Parisiennes, slim-cut dark wash jeans for men can go 
almost anywhere in Paris these days. Worn with a tailored blazer or fine-knit 
sweater (think body-hugging),<em>un jean</em> works just as well for<em> </em>a 
stroll through the Centre Pompidou as it does for a dinner at a swank bistro. 
Whether it&rsquo;s jeans, chinos or wool trousers, keep the cut close; a flared 
leg or tailored cuff is a definite style don&rsquo;t.Continue

<h2>A Leap of Faith: Finding the Perfect Paris Apartment</h2> 
<p>January 10, 2012 &nbsp;by Kelly Page</p> 
<h6><em>Chris Waits; David L. </em></h6> 
<p>After having made the huge, scary, glorious decision to quit my plum 
entertainment job of 14 years to move to Paris, all I could picture was 
drinking ros&eacute; in fabulous cafes in St. Germain and strolling with my 
soon-to-be-named French lover along the Seine.&nbsp; It was going to be all 
storybook romance and Parisian perfection, right?&nbsp; What could possibly go 
wrong?</p> 
<p><strong>Finding an Apartment</strong></p> 
<p>The first big task on moving to Paris was finding an apartment.&nbsp; I 
felt like a Parisian kid in a<em>confiserie</em> as I set out to look through 
all the online listings.&nbsp; I was picturing my new, highbrow, literary 
friends meeting in my salon and debating whether Anna Karenina was due 
society&rsquo;s scorn or the victim of a double standard.&nbsp; And then there 
would be the lavish, multi-course creations that would appear out of my kitchen 
and people would say, are you sure she&rsquo;s not French-trained or a 
descendant of Julia Child?</p> 
<h6><em>Mollie C.; Chris Waits</em></h6> 
<p>As I dug into the apartment search further and started to learn the meter 
to square feet conversion, a ros&eacute; hangover started to kick in.&nbsp; How 
was I supposed to entertain the French literati in a space the size of a 
parking spot? Would my culinary creations have to come from a hot plate in my 
Betty Crocker play kitchen?&nbsp; Oh, no, this wouldn&rsquo;t do. &nbsp;I 
decided an in-person visit would be best because I was sure there were some 
things that weren&rsquo;t translating on the web page.Continue

<h2>The Art of the Parisian Soiree</h2> 
<p>January 5, 2012 &nbsp;by Victoria Wall</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>To do <em>une soir&eacute;e</em> or not to do<em> une soir&eacute;e
</em>? </strong></p> 
<p>What exactly is this rather elegant and mysterious sounding <em>
soir&eacute;e</em>? And, how should it be approached&nbsp;by mere Anglophone 
mortals?</p> 
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Noun: soir&eacute;e: </strong>party or gathering, with a 
sophisticated name to impress &nbsp;the uninitiated, taking place in apartments 
across the glimmering city of lights (usually accompanied by<em>beaucoup de</em>
 alcohol, &nbsp;yummy food and much merriment).</p> 
<p>Still all rather vague? I&rsquo;ve tried to break down the process into 
nice easy steps and here&rsquo;s what I came up with&hellip;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Step 1: Getting there</strong></p> 
<p>There are several key points to bear in mind. Under no circumstances should 
you arrive on time &ndash; keep it carefree by arriving fashionably late.</p> 
<p>Watch out for complex digicode systems designed to keep guests out and 
lift-less 6th floor apartments in distant Parisian destinations.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 2: <em>La Bise</em></strong></p> 
<p>Remember the essentials:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Smile (not too much in order to remain mysterious)</li> 
<li>Perch two dainty kisses one on each cheek</li> 
<li>Compliment the host (it always goes down a treat)</li> </ul> 
<p>I recommend arriving bearing wine. Don&rsquo;t worry about breaking the 
bank &ndash; surprisingly, even inexpensive supermarket plonk is still very 
drinkable.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Step 3: &nbsp;Chit Chat </strong></p> 
<p>Eek! Now that the introductions are out of the way, it&rsquo;s time to 
mingle!Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p> <br>

<h2>Paris Winter Fashion: The Girls of Montmartre</h2>

<h2>Les Enfants Terribles? Kid-Friendly Dining in Paris</h2> 
<p>December 27, 2011 &nbsp;by Paige Bradley Frost</p> 
<p><em>Mark and Allegra Karoski-Biava</em></p> 
<p>Fresh off the plane and bleary-eyed with two kids in tow, we set out for 
our first family meal in Paris. Surely in this city of more than 8,000 
restaurants, finding a suitable spot would be simple enough,<em>non</em>?</p> 
<p>After passing snug bistros and lively brasseries, we spotted a red neon 
sign that seemed to scream, &ldquo;Kids Welcome Here!&rdquo; We made a beeline 
for Hippopotamus, the kid-friendly chain with outposts all over the city. 
Without dwelling on the gastronomic disappointment (and pricey menu) of that 
evening, we learned some early lessons about eating out with kids in Paris. 
Number one? Don&rsquo;t eat at Hippopotamus.</p> 
<p><em>Ready for a fancy French meal (Juliet)</em></p> 
<p>In the months since, we&rsquo;ve tried many restaurants with our children 
(ages four and six). Here are some tips and sure-fire hits when you venture out 
to eat<em>en famille</em>.</p> 
<p><strong>Not where but when</strong>: Successful family dining is about 
knowing when to go. Many wonderful restaurants will welcome kids if you go at 
off-peak times. Sunday<em>d&eacute;jeuner </em>is a big one for family meals in 
Paris. Friday and Saturday nights? Not so much. For mid-week lunches, go 
earlier or later than the business crowd and you&rsquo;ll likely be met with a 
smile. Bustling brasseries and<em>service continu</em> restos will suit you 
better than dinner at 9:00 at the cozy corner bistro.</p> 
<p><em>Picnic-ing and playing on the Champs de Mars (Markus Bollingmo)</em></p>
<p><strong>Know your kids. Know the French</strong>: French children are 
trained to sit quietly and eat like little adults. French parents are strict 
and never more so than around the table. Crying, screaming and crawling under 
the table are not tolerated and will prompt vocal disapproval and the 
not-so-subtle &ldquo;<em>oh la la</em>.&rdquo; Adjust your restaurant choices 
accordingly to avoid a miserable meal for all.Continue Reading&nbsp;&raquo;</p>
