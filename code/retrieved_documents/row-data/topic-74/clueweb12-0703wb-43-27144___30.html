<p> <strong>Tour begins: 3:00 PM, The Royal Horseguards.</strong>&nbsp; 
Welcome to &quot;merrie olde&quot; England for the start of Tauck Bridges' 
enriching London and Paris tour! A transfer is included from London's Heathrow 
Airport to The Royal Horseguards. Climb aboard one of London's signature 
double-decker buses for a private guided tour of this grand capital city, which 
you'll learn about on a four-night stay in the heart of it all at The Royal 
Horseguards, the former WWI-era headquarters of the British Secret Service. Get 
to know your fellow travelers at our welcome reception and dinner tonight.</p> 
<h4>Lodging</h4> 
<p>The Royal Horseguards</p> <b>Day</b> <strong>2</strong> 
<p> The Tower, the Thames &ndash; and the London Eye </p> <b>Meals</b> 
<p>B, L, D</p> <br>

<p>The Tower of London is steeped in history and intrigue, having served as 
both a castle and a prison over the past thousand or so years. Meet the 
Beefeaters who watch over it and the famous ravens that live within its walls; 
see the Bloody Tower and the British Empire's priceless Crown Jewels. But 
you'll explore more than history today, as you embark on a speedboat adventure 
along the River Thames... then ride 450 feet above the city in a glass pod 
&ndash; a private one, thanks to Tauck Bridges &ndash; on the celebrated London 
Eye, the world's highest observation wheel! Dinner tonight is in a real London 
pub.<br>
</p>

<p> A castle fit for a queen, a bike ride &amp; a West End show </p> <b>Meals
</b> 
<p>B</p> <br>

<p>The home of English kings and queens for over 900 years, stately Windsor 
Castle is still a residence of the British Royal Family &ndash; and you'll tour 
this castle &quot;fit for a queen&quot; (or a king) today; seeing the 
exquisitely detailed Queen Mary's Dolls' House is a treat for children of all 
ages. As your exciting London and Paris tour continues this afternoon, join us 
on a bike ride through the Royal Parks of London, followed by a special treat 
tonight on Drury Lane in London&rsquo;s West End Theatre District... a 
performance of<em>The Wizard of Oz</em>! <br>
</p> 
<h4>Lodging</h4> 
<p>The Royal Horseguards</p> <b>Day</b> <strong>4</strong> 
<p> Mummies at the British Museum &amp; a spy walk </p> <b>Meals</b> 
<p>B, L</p> <br>

<p>Although two million years' worth of history and culture might be a little 
tough to see in one day, you'll get a taste of what the fascinating British 
Museum has to offer on a guided tour of this amazing place &ndash; housing the 
world's most comprehensive collection of art and artifacts, from maps to 
mummies and more, in nearly two-and-a-half miles' worth of galleries. Later, 
it&rsquo;s spy versus spy on an afternoon &quot;spy walk,&quot; where you'll 
become a secret agent and try to save the world... will you rescue the damsel 
in distress... and what about the white cat? A very fitting event for your last 
evening in your London hotel... where real spies of the British Secret Service 
roamed the halls back during World War I!<br>
</p>

<p>The Royal Horseguards</p> <b>Day</b> <strong>5</strong>

Eurostar</em> train to Paris. You'll travel under the English Channel through 
the engineering marvel known as the Channel Tunnel (unofficially called the 
&quot;Chunnel&quot;) &ndash; arriving in Paris before you know it. Upon 
arrival, a Paris tour introduces you to landmark city sights including the 
Eiffel Tower and the Champs-Elys&eacute;es.&nbsp; Check into your hotel, right 
next to the Tuileries Garden, then join us for dinner at an authentic Parisian 
brasserie where you will experience a real taste of life in Paris!</p>

<p> A ch&acirc;teau fit for a king &amp; a Louvre treasure hunt </p> <b>Meals
</b> 
<p>B, L</p> <br>

<p>Today's Paris tour takes you on a visit to Ch&acirc;teau de Versailles, 
built by King Louis XIV and the largest palace in Europe, revealing a realm of 
grandeur and riches beyond the imagination of the Montmartre artists of his 
time; it would cost more than $2 billion to build this sprawling palace complex 
today! Explore the opulent palace with a local guide and view the exquisite 
gardens, among the most extraordinary and famous in the world. Back in Paris 
after lunch at a caf&eacute;, discover the treasures of the Mus&eacute;e du 
Louvre on a fun-filled guided scavenger hunt tour with your family and new 
Tauck Bridges friends.<br>
</p>

<p>The Westin Paris</p> <b>Day</b> <strong>7</strong> 
<p> Notre Dame's gargoyles and Montmartre's artists </p> <b>Meals</b> 
<p>B, D</p> <br>

<p>Since the 12th century, the fabled Cathedral of Notre Dame &ndash; built on 
the site of a Roman temple &ndash; has witnessed, and often been a part of, 
some of Parisian history's most momentous events. Look for gargoyles and imagine
<em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> high up in his bell tower, as you visit 
the majestic cathedral with a local expert on your Paris tour today. Savor the 
special<em>joie de vivre</em> atmosphere of hilltop Montmartre, where poets, 
writers and artists have practiced their crafts for centuries; a guided walking 
tour may reveal them at work. Spend free time exploring on your own before 
joining us for our private, festive farewell dinner &ndash; a perfect way to 
end your family's extraordinary London and Paris tour!</p>

<h3> Nights 1 - 4 : The Royal Horseguards -  London, England </h3> <br>

dining, is a peaceful oasis in the midst of the busy city while the Equus Bar, 
which has a wide array on interesting non-alcoholic refreshments such as Equus 
Cola made from a top-secret recipe, as well as traditional and contemporary 
cocktails, is reminiscent of the kind of&nbsp; &ldquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s

<h3>Tauck Travel Protection Product / If You Have To Cancel</h3> 
<p> <strong>Tauck&rsquo;s Guest Protection and Cancellation Fee Waiver</strong>
</p> 
<p>Guests booking a Tauck journey have the option of purchasing cancellation 
protection from Tauck in the event they need to cancel their trip after making 
their reservations.</p> 
<p>Tauck's Travel Protection is available to all travelers, with the exception 
of residents of Puerto Rico. Residents of Puerto Rico are eligible for some 
cancellation protection by purchasing Tauck's Cancellation Fee Waiver (see 
below).</p> 
<p> <strong>Tauck&rsquo;s Guest Protection</strong> </p> 
<p>Under Tauck&rsquo;s all-inclusive Guest Protection, you can cancel your 
tour for any reason up to the day before departure and receive a money-back 
refund (except in Extreme Circumstances*) on the land tour cost. The Guest 
Protection plan waives cancellation fees outlined, provided we are notified of 
cancellation before your tour departs. Tour cancellation fees are waived 
regardless of reason, without written notice, and Tauck will refund land tour 
cost. The cost is<strong>$240 per person</strong>.</p> 
<p>In addition, Tauck&rsquo;s Guest Protection provides comprehensive 
travelers&rsquo; insurance and 24-hour emergency assistance. Coverage for the 
following elements is provided by BerkelyCare, Ltd. and is subject to the 
terms, conditions and exclusions of the policy:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Airfare Protection</strong> &ndash; Should you need to cancel or 
interrupt your tour for covered reasons, airfares and air penalties will be 
covered up to the original airfare cost.</li> 
<li> <strong>Medical Protection</strong> &ndash; You are reimbursed for 
covered medical expenses incurred in the event you become injured or ill during 
your trip (including pre-existing conditions if purchased at time of deposit).
</li> 
<li> <strong>Luggage Protection</strong> &ndash; You are reimbursed for lost, 
stolen, delayed or damaged luggage.</li> </ul> 
<p>This optional Guest Protection must be requested at time of booking and fee 
must be included with initial payment. Details will be provided with written

of any refund shall be reduced by any recoveries obtained by you from any third 
parties.</p> 
<p> <strong>Tauck&rsquo;s Cancellation Fee Waiver</strong> </p> 
<p>Should you have to cancel your tour for any reason, Tauck&rsquo;s 
non-refundable Cancellation Fee Waiver waives all cancellation fees outlined 
(except in Extreme Circumstances*), provided we are notified of cancellation 
before your tour departs. The cost is<strong>$185 per person</strong>.</p> 
<p>This Waiver is not insurance; it does not cover airline penalties, luggage 
damage, personal injury, or does not protect travel agent commissions. The 
advantage of this waiver is that you may cancel regardless of reason, without 
written notice. Should you wish protection beyond our Cancellation Fee Waiver, 
your travel agent will recommend insurance companies.</p> 
<p>This optional Cancellation Fee Waiver must be requested at time of booking 
and fee must be included with initial payment. It assures a full refund of land 
tour costs received by Tauck, except for the cost of the Cancellation Fee 
Waiver and any extra fees resulting from partial room cancellation.</p> 
<p> <strong>*Extreme Circumstances:</strong> In the event of an act of God, 
war (whether declared or undeclared), terrorism, accident, natural disaster, 
outbreak of disease, or other event or circumstance beyond our control that 
contributes to or results in cancellation rates above our historical 
cancellation rates in the absence of such event or occurrence, Tauck reserves 
the right to issue a credit to you in lieu of a money-back refund, applicable 
to a future Tauck journey.</p> 
<p> <strong>If You Have to Cancel</strong> </p> 
<p> <strong>Cancellations Fees &ndash; </strong>Regardless of reason, 
cancellations result in costly charges from our travel and hotel providers 
covering penalties and fees incurred by canceling confirmed bookings. 
Therefore, the following fees apply.</p> 
<p>Guests choosing to purchase Tauck&rsquo;s Guest Protection will incur 
cancellation penalties of<strong>$240 per person </strong>regardless of

number of overnights missed less $40 per day for unused transportation and 
other fixed expenses.</p>

<em>If you 
are traveling from the U.S.,</em>the U.S. Transportation Security 
Administration&rsquo;s (TSA) Secure Flight program requires that your name, as 
it appears on your domestic or international airline ticket, must match your 
name as it appears on the government-issued photo ID (i.e., passport or 
driver&rsquo;s license) that you present during security screening. The ID name 
must also match any additional airline data, such as frequent-flyer 
information. Your date-of-birth and gender information provided to the airline 
must also match your passport.<br>
<br>
If you make your air travel 
arrangements through us, please ensure that the name you provide us matches 
your name as shown on the identification you will use while traveling. If you 
make your own airline reservations, please ensure that the airline has the 
correct information.<br>

Due to heightened security regulations, certain 
items such as a metal nail file, pocketknife, cigarette lighter, or tweezers, 
and some liquid, gel, or aerosol items may not be permitted in your carry-on 
luggage. Please call your airline prior to departure to obtain current 
information on non-permissible carry-on items and recommended airport check-in

</p> </li> 
<li> 
<h3>Preparing to Go</h3> 
<p> <strong>Travel Document Requirements </strong>- <br>
<br>
<em>If you are a 
U.S. citizen traveling internationally,</em> you will need a passport valid for 
six months beyond the completion of your Tauck journey for entry into the 
United Kingdom&nbsp;and France; however, you do not need a visa for either 
country for the short duration of this tour.<br>
<br>
<em>If you are a citizen 
of another country traveling internationally,</em>you should contact an embassy 
or consulate of the United Kingdom and of France to determine what travel 
documentation is required.<br>
<br>
Please note that longer stays abroad for 
any purpose may require additional travel documentation.<br>
<br>
We recommend 
that you make at least two photocopies of all the travel documents that you 
bring with you. Include copies of the photo page of your passport that contains 
the date of issuance, the date of expiration and your citizenship. Secure one 
set of copies in the safe in your room while traveling and leave one set behind 
with someone at home who will assist you in the event your documents are 
misplaced, lost or stolen.<br>
<br>
<strong>Travel with Children </strong>- <br>
<br><em>Age Recommendations</em>&ndash; Children 3 years of age or older at the 
time of travel are welcome on this Tauck Bridges journey. Based upon our 
experience with family travelers, for each itinerary we have a minimum 
recommended age to encourage comfort and enjoyment for all of our guests. We 
recommend that children be 8 years of age or older to fully participate in all 
activities planned for this tour. All children must be accompanied on 
activities by a parent or guardian. At least one guest in the traveling party 
must be 21 years of age or older in order to make a reservation.</p> 
<p> <em>Babysitting</em> &#8213; Our journeys are designed for adults and 
children to share the wonder of discovery together. If you require babysitting 
services, your Tauck Director will put you in contact with the appropriate 
hotel staff with whom you may make babysitting arrangements. There is usually 
an additional fee for these services. Many hotels do offer on-site babysitting 
services; however, babysitting services may not be available at all of our 
hotels. Please note that our Tauck Directors are not responsible for providing 
babysitting services.<br>
<br>
<em>Safety and Welfare Responsibility </em>
&#8213; We welcome the participation of child travelers on our exciting 
excursions. If you are traveling with a child on a Tauck journey, you have the 
sole responsibility for ensuring that that the child with whom you are 
traveling follows all rules of safety throughout the tour. By traveling with 
us, you release Tauck, Inc. and our partners of all liability for any risks 
and/or injuries to the child with whom you are traveling.<br>
<br>
<em>Special 
Travel Documentation for Children<br>
Authorization for Travel <br>
</em><br>

If you travel into or out of the U.S. with children under the age of 18, you 
should be aware of the following: because of increasing incidents of child 
abductions in disputed custody cases and because children are at risk as 
possible victims of child pornography, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
strongly recommends that unless the child is accompanied by both parents, you 
should have a notarized note from the child's other parent (or, in the case of 
a child traveling with grandparents, uncles or aunts, sisters or brothers, or 
friends, a note signed by both parents) stating that the parent(s) not 
traveling acknowledge that the parent(s), family members, etc. who are 
traveling into or out of the U.S. with the child have permission to do 
so.&nbsp;While CBP may not ask to see this documentation, if they do ask, and 
you do not have it, you may be detained until the circumstances of the child 
traveling without both parents can be fully assessed.<br>
<br>
If there is no 
second parent with legal claims to the child (parent deceased, sole custody, 
etc.), other relevant paperwork, such as a court decision, birth certificate 
naming only one parent, or a death certificate, will be useful.<br>
<br>
Many 
other countries also share this concern for children who travel without both 
parents. To ensure smooth travel, we require you to comply with the travel 
regulations of each country visited. This information may be obtained from a 
country&rsquo;s consulate or embassy.<br>
<br>
<em>Authorization for Emergency 
Medical Treatment<br>
</em><br>
In the unlikely event of a medical emergency, a 
medical facility will require permission from the child&rsquo;s parents to 
provide treatment. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you bring along a letter 
from both parents (including other pertinent documents as cited above) 
authorizing emergency medical treatment for their child.</p> 
<p>Children who are U.S. citizens must have a passport valid for at least six 
months beyond the completion of the journey.</p> 
<p>We are not responsible for the disruption of travel caused by the improper 
documentation of any guest, including children traveling without both parents. 
While there is no definitive format or standard, click&nbsp;here to view a 
sample letter for guardians or one parent traveling with a child.<br>
<br>

<strong>Air Conditioning </strong>&ndash; Both hotels and the motor coaches are 
air-conditioned for your comfort.<br>
<br>
<strong>ATM and Credit Cards 
</strong>&ndash; We recommend that you contact your bank in advance of 
departing on this tour to determine whether you will be able to use your ATM 
and credit cards while traveling. When contacting your bank, notify them of 
your travel dates so that they will anticipate charges being made outside of 
your hometown and do not suspend your cards for what may appear to them to be 
&quot;suspicious&quot; charges. We also recommend that you make a photocopy of 
the front and back sides of your ATM and credit cards to leave behind with 
someone at home who will assist you in the event your cards are misplaced, lost 
or stolen.<br>
<br>
<strong>Clothing and Packing </strong>&ndash; The weather 
in London and Paris is changeable and unpredictable. We suggest that you dress 
for comfort and convenience with a wardrobe that is flexible and allows for 
layering. Casual, cotton clothing is recommended. A light sweater or jacket 
will provide warmth on a chilly early morning walk or a late night stroll. Rain 
falls evenly throughout the year in both cities; however, the relative humidity 
in Paris is 10% higher than in London. In summer, the heat and humidity in 
Paris causes some moderate discomfort.<br>
<br>
For the welcome and farewell 
receptions, casual resort wear is appropriate; formal wear is never required 
for dining with your fellow guests at a Tauck provided dinner. When dining on 
your own, you may have the opportunity to dine at an upscale restaurant, which 
may require men to dress in coat and tie, and women in more elegant 
eveningwear. It is advisable to avoid wearing jeans, sneakers or shorts for 
dinner.<br>
<br>
You will find a hair dryer and bathrobes located in your hotel 
guest room. Irons and ironing boards are available upon request. Valet laundry 
and dry cleaning services are also available for a fee.<br>
<br>
We recommend 
that you pack an adequate supply of your prescription medication in its 
original container to last through your entire journey, together with a copy of 
your doctor&rsquo;s prescription (or a letter from your health-care provider on 
office stationery explaining that the medication has been prescribed for you), 
a list of the generic names of your medication, your travel documents and a 
change of clothing in your carry-on bag to avoid any inconvenience in the event 
that your flight or luggage is delayed.<br>
<br>
Following is a list of 
recommended items to pack for your trip to London and Paris:</p> 
<p>&bull;Casual daytime wear &ndash; shorts, slacks, long and short-sleeved 
shirts<br>
&bull;An optional jacket and tie for men <br>
&bull;Casually elegant 
evening wear for ladies<br>
&bull;Sunglasses, sunscreen, hat <br>
&bull;Swimwear
<br>&bull;Gym wear <br>
&bull;A light sweater or jacket for higher elevations 
or a breezy night<br>
&bull;Binoculars (7x50 preferably) <br>
&bull;Insect 
repellent<br>
&bull;Camera, lenses, batteries, memory cards and/or plenty of 
film<br>
&bull;Lightweight, comfortable, sturdy walking shoes that have already 
been broken-in<br>
&bull;Battery-operated travel alarm clock <br>
&bull;Rain 
poncho and collapsible umbrella<br>
&bull;Zipper-lock bags <br>
&bull;Daypack 
for camera equipment<br>
&bull;Sundries and toiletries that may be difficult to 
find en route<br>
&bull;Copies of your travel documents that should be secured 
in the safe in your hotel room while traveling</p> 
<p>Children may want to consider bringing along pocket toys and games with a 
&ldquo;sound off&rdquo; button or portable radio/CD players with headphones for 
use on longer coach rides. Journals, binoculars and cameras are also great 
things for children to have with them to make the most of their adventure.<br>

<br>Each child 17 and under will be sent a complimentary backpack from Tauck 
Bridges! If the child resides in the continental United States, the backpack 
will be sent to his or her home approximately two weeks prior to the tour 
departure date. If the child resides outside of the continental U.S., including 
Hawaii and Alaska, the backpack will be waiting on arrival at the first hotel 
on your itinerary.<br>
<br>
<strong>Elevation </strong>- The maximum elevation 
on this tour is approximately 1,000 feet (305 meters).<br>
<br>
<strong>Health
</strong> &ndash; <em>The Castles &amp; Kings</em> tour is relaxed and the pace 
is leisurely. You should be in good health and able to walk reasonable 
distances over uneven terrain, as some of the most memorable sightseeing can 
only be accomplished on foot. London and Paris are home to innumerable historic 
buildings and sites, some dating from antiquity. Therefore, roads, walkways and 
architecture may present difficulties for you if you have physical limitations. 
You will encounter cobblestone streets, narrow passageways, and some steep and 
winding staircases. For the most part, however, the amount of walking you do at 
the various sites and towns is at your discretion.<br>
<br>
We regret that we 
cannot provide you with individual assistance for walking, dining or other 
personal needs. If you need such assistance, you must be accompanied by an able 
companion who will help you.<br>
<br>
Please advise your Tauck Director on tour 
if you or the children traveling with you have any serious allergies. Also, 
adults may want to bring along children's aspirin or medicines as a precaution, 
as access to these may be limited.<br>
<br>
Please check with your health 
insurance provider to determine whether you are covered while traveling. If you 
will not be covered under your current policy, we strongly suggest that you 
arrange for adequate coverage while on tour.<br>
<br>
If you have a medical 
condition which might limit your participation in activities, please consult 
your physician for pre-departure health advice and notify us as soon as 
possible, if you have not already done so. We will advise your Tauck Director 
accordingly.<br>
<br>
<em>If you are a resident of the U.S. traveling 
internationally,</em> no vaccinations are currently required for travel to the 
United Kingdom or France. For complete vaccination and inoculation information, 
contact your physician, the public health service in your area, or the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. The Travelers' 
Health Section of the CDC operates a 24-hour &quot;Travelers' Health 
Hotline&quot; at 800-232-4636 (toll-free in the U.S.). You may also log on to 
the CDC website by clickinghere. <br>
<br>
<em>If you are a resident of another 
country traveling internationally,</em> please contact an embassy or consulate 
of the United Kingdom and of France to determine what vaccination(s) may be 
required for your travel.<br>
<br>
<strong>Luggage Restrictions </strong>- <br>

<br><em>Checked Luggage &ndash; General <br>
</em><br>
While it is common for 
airlines to allow passengers to check more than one piece of luggage per 
person, space constraints during your Tauck journey make it difficult to 
accommodate extra luggage. We ask that you limit your checked luggage to one 
average size suitcase per person.<br>
<br>
Recently, airlines have adopted 
policies enforcing strict number, size and weight limits. Luggage exceeding 
maximum restrictions may require expensive overage fees, frustrating and 
hurried re-packing at the ticket counter, or even risk being left behind.<br>

<br>Many carriers require that checked luggage not exceed a weight of 50 lbs 
(22.7 kg) per piece. Airlines revise luggage policies frequently and often 
without notice; therefore, we cannot be held liable for the accuracy of the 
weight limit listed above. We urge you to check with your airline before 
traveling to determine current number, weight and size restrictions. It is also 
important to note that restrictions for luggage number, weight and size may 
vary with the same airline based on the class of service you select. First and 
Business Class ticket holders may have different restrictions than Coach Class 
travelers. You may wish to consult the website,<em>luggagelimits.com</em>, by 
clickinghere. <br>
<br>
We cannot be held liable for additional fees or 
inconveniences imposed by the airline due to luggage number, weight and size 
policies.<br>
<br>
<em>Please be sure to attach your Tauck luggage tag to your 
suitcase before leaving home!</em> <br>
<br>
<em>Carry-on Luggage - General <br>
</em><br>
Although oversize bags and wheeled, carry-on luggage are popular for 
airline travel, they are often not convenient or appropriate for motor coach 
travel or for many on-tour flights. Most modern sightseeing motor coaches offer 
limited space for numerous or larger items. Space under seats or in the 
overhead rack is typically small, and designed to accommodate items like coats, 
hats, purses, and small camera bags, etc.<br>
<br>
For your day-to-day travel 
while on tour, we recommend that you limit your hand luggage to a small, 
soft-sided carry-on piece, and that you bring only those items you need handy 
during the day such as make-up, medications, cameras, film, etc. Items too 
large to fit under the motor coach seat or on the overhead rack must be stored 
in the luggage bays beneath the motor coach, and may be inaccessible during 
daytime travel.<br>
<br>

<h3>Destination Information</h3> 
<p> <strong>Cell Phones </strong>- We understand and appreciate the value of 
instant communication when we travel; it keeps us in touch with friends and 
family, and it's a reassurance in the event of an emergency. However, the use 
of cell phones can be disruptive to a tour and to other guests who are enjoying 
their vacation. As a courtesy to others, we ask that guests refrain from cell 
phone usage during motor coach travel, group functions, sightseeing and when 
the Tauck Director is addressing the group as a whole. There are usually many 
opportunities to make or receive calls at times when it does not affect others.
<br><br>
Please contact your cell phone carrier to determine if your service 
extends to&nbsp;England and France.<br>
<br>
<strong>Currency and Exchange Rates
</strong>- The currency in the United Kingdom is the British Pound and in 
France, it is the Euro.In London, ATMs are available and Visa, MasterCard and 
American Express are widely accepted; visitors with other cards should check 
with their credit card companies in advance. Foreign currency can be exchanged 
at exchange bureaus and large hotels, however better exchange rates are likely 
to be found at banks. Travelers&rsquo; checks are generally not accepted; 
however if you do use them, they are best taken in British Pounds to avoid 
additional charges. In Paris, currency can be exchanged at banks, bureaux de 
change and some large hotels, though you will get a better exchange rate at the 
ATMs. Major credit cards are widely accepted, as are travelers&rsquo; checks. 
Foreign currency is not accepted. Currency can be exchanged at The Royal 
Horseguards, London and The Westin Paris, but hotels may not provide a 
competitive rate.<br>

should familiarize yourself with England and France&rsquo;s specific required 
declarations before you travel. In general, you are not permitted to bring live 
plants, fresh fruits and other produce items into most countries.You may find 
additional information by visiting<em>VisaHQ.com </em>by clicking here. <br>

<br><em>If you are a U.S. resident traveling internationally who will be 
returning to the U.S. at the end of the tour,</em> you are entitled to a 
duty-free exemption based on the total value of merchandise purchase abroad, as 
long as you physically bring them with you. There are limits to the amount of 
alcohol that can be a part of this exemption. Certain restrictions apply to 
unaccompanied goods mailed from abroad to the U.S. Please call your local 
customs office or consult the U.S. government's customs regulations as 
contained in their publication entitledKnow Before You Go. <br>
<br>
<em>If you 
are a resident of another country traveling internationally,</em> please refer 
to your own country&rsquo;s rules and regulations regarding customs and 
duty-free shopping to ensure compliance upon your return.<br>
<br>
Many 
countries levy Value Added Taxes (VAT) on consumer goods and services. (The tax 
rate may be higher for luxury items and lower for basic goods.) As a rule, if 
you are not a resident of the country (or of the country&rsquo;s 
intergovernmental economic community, e.g., the European Union) in which the 
purchase is made, you may be entitled to a VAT refund and should inquire about 
the refund policy where you shop.<br>
<br>
<strong>Electrical Current </strong>
&ndash; The electrical current in both the United Kingdom and France is 230 V, 
50 Hz, AC. In the United Kingdom, the plug type is &ldquo;G&rdquo; and uses 
three rectangular blades, in France the plug type is &ldquo;E&rdquo; and uses 
two round pins and a receptacle for a round male grounding pin. Guests whose 
appliances do not conform to these standards&nbsp;may need to bring the 
appropriate converters and adapters. These items can be purchased in a store 
that specializes in travel products.<br>
