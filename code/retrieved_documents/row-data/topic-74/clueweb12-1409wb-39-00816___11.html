<h2>Friday Fun! (Happy&nbsp;Thanksgiving!)</h2> November 23, 2011 wolfshowl 12 
comments <br>

<p>Hello my lovely readers!&nbsp; For once I&rsquo;m actually writing this a 
couple of days ahead of time, because it is American Thanksgiving this weekend, 
and I&rsquo;m going to be one busy lady.&nbsp; My dad is coming down from 
Vermont to spend a few days with me in my lovely city of Boston.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m looking forward to the quality time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s something 
that&rsquo;s hard to come by when you live in a different state from your 
parent.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m also excited for him to see me looking far healthier 
than the last time he was here, which was almost a year ago!</p> 
<p>There will probably not be anything particularly traditional about our 
Thanksgiving, since I&rsquo;m a vegetarian, and there&rsquo;s only two of 
us.&nbsp; We may go out. We may order in. We may make tacos.&nbsp; Who 
knows.&nbsp; We will, however, definitely be drinking beer and watching the 
game.&nbsp; We are traditional Americans in THAT regard. </p> 
<p>Once he heads back for home I&rsquo;ll be doing the laundry, getting in 
some quality gym time, and finally getting started on editing zombies.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m aiming for a release date toward the end of January and am excited 
about this book.&nbsp; Whereas the Tova Gallagher series is a just for fun 
romance novella lite, zombies is all about the feminist scifi and horror writer 
inside me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a different kind of excitement.&nbsp; A more 
serious one.</p> 
<p>I do want to take a moment to ask you all to seriously consider avoiding 
the crass consumerism that is Black Friday sales this weekend if at all 
possible.&nbsp; I understand money is tight, trust me, I do, but all you have 
to do is youtube some videos of the types of mobs that happen to see how 
disgusting this obsession with stuff can be.&nbsp; Spend your long weekend with 
loved ones, whether related by blood or by choice.&nbsp; Get outside.&nbsp; Go 
for a hike. Read a book. Go to the library!&nbsp; Just don&rsquo;t spend your 
precious hours off obsessed with stuff.&nbsp; As Tyler Durden says, you 
don&rsquo;t own your stuff.&nbsp; Your stuff owns you.</p> 
<p>Happy weekend all!</p> Categories: Friday Fun! Tags: black friday, boston,

<h2>Friday Fun! (I&rsquo;m Being Boring Lately So Here&rsquo;s Some 
Wishlist&nbsp;Highlights)</h2> March 11, 2011 wolfshowl 8 comments <br>

<p>Hello my lovely readers!&nbsp; I hope your weeks went well.&nbsp; Last 
weekend I went to a collegiate hockey game with a friend.&nbsp; It was crazy 
fun and full of adorable 10 year old boys in Bruins jerseys rooting for 
BC.&nbsp; It also was surprisingly warm for a building housing an ice skating 
rink.&nbsp; That could be the Vermonter in me talking though.&nbsp; I also hung 
out with one of my friends and watched trashy horror movies.</p> 
<p>Other than that, my week has been quite normal.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Aside 
from having finally done my taxes and seeing I get moneys back for having been 
in graduate school last year and also being poor.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; I suddenly 
feel totally justified in getting my Xbox Kinect.&nbsp; So.&nbsp; Since 
I&rsquo;m being an epically boring vegetarian librarian alternating between 
reading a shit-ton, weight lifting and doing chin-ups at the gym, and watching 
mini-marathons of Teen Mom 2 (for the schadenfreude aspect), I think today 
I&rsquo;ll give you all a glance at some books on my wishlist.&nbsp; (Ok, some 
of them have yet to make it onto my LibraryThing wishlist, but they&rsquo;re on 
my wishlist in my head, ok?!)&nbsp; I will probably not be able to afford them 
anytime soon or justify buying them since I currently have a pile of 79 
physical books to read in my tiny apartment.&nbsp; *shuffles feet*&nbsp; 
Anywho.&nbsp; Here we go.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Meat is for Pussies by John Joseph<br>
 This is marketed as a going vegan 
book for men written by a vegan male martial arts fighter.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
supposed to blow the myth of being a male vegan equating being weak and/or not 
masculine out of the water.&nbsp; Since it&rsquo;s a perpetual problem that 
veg*nism has a hard time appealing to the men of humanity, I&rsquo;m very 
curious to check this out.</li> 
<li>Supermarket Vegan: 225 Meat-Free, Egg-Free, Dairy-Free Recipes for Real 
People in the Real World by Donna Klein<br>
 Fact: I am poor. Further Fact: I 
don&rsquo;t have a car. Even Further Fact: The nearest grocery store to me is 
crazy cheap and mainstream so it&rsquo;s not always easy for me to find obscure 
ingredients often listed in vegan recipes.&nbsp; (I do take the time to order 
vital wheat gluten and nutritional yeast in bulk from Amazon though.&nbsp; That 
shit is awesome).&nbsp; Anyway, I&rsquo;m very intrigued by the concept of this 
book.&nbsp; I hope the recipes are creative and not just like &ldquo;pasta, 
veggies, rice, have fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see!</li> 
<li>Canning for a New Generation: Bold, Fresh Flavors for the Modern Pantry by 
Liana Krissoff<br>
 This comes across to me as the <em>Stitch n Bitch</em> for 
canning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very intrigued by canning but am put-off by how 
old-fashioned most of the recipes and methods in the cookbooks are.&nbsp; Why 
am I into canning you ask?&nbsp; Hey.&nbsp; Ya&rsquo;ll know how into local 
food and preparing for the zombie apocalypse I am.</li> 
<li>Dead in the Family by Charlaine Harris<br>
 Ok, so I could own this 
already, but I own the previous books in the Sookie Stackhouse series in mass 
market paperback, and the SERIES MUST MATCH.&nbsp; Also, I can&rsquo;t suddenly 
switch to ebooks for the series at this point in the game, but I would if I 
could.</li> 
<li>Handling the Undead by John Ajvide Lindqvist<br>
 Besides having the most 
difficult to spell name of any author on this list, Lindqvist also wrote Let 
the Right One In, which I think is a wonderful twist on/addition to vampire 
lore.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t wait to see what he does to zombies.</li> 
<li>The Loving Dead by Amelia Beamer<br>
 All you need to know about this book 
is that the zombie plague is an STD in it.&nbsp; AN STD. MUST READ.</li> 
<li>Can You Survive the Zombie Apocalypse? by Max Brallier<br>
 I was 
completely obsessed with Choose Your Own Adventure (CYA) stories when I was a 
kid, even the craptastic fundy Christian ones my parental units made me 
read.&nbsp; This is a CYA set in the ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a 
zombie videogame.&nbsp; Only it&rsquo;s a book. COVET</li> 
<li>The Secret Feminist Cabal: A Cultural History of Science Fiction Feminisms 
by Helen Merrick<br>
 I&rsquo;m just obsessed with feminist scifi and any study 
of or collection of feminist scifi I&rsquo;ve read in the past has been 
motherfucking awesome.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t wait to see what new authors and 
stories I&rsquo;ll discover through this book.</li> </ul> 
<p>There&rsquo;s your glimpse at my wishlist!&nbsp; Hope you enjoyed!&nbsp; 
Hopefully I&rsquo;ll have more real life stories for you next week.&nbsp; Also 
I&rsquo;m just noticing that this is an interesting mix of zombies, sex, 
feminism, and veg*ism.&nbsp; Huh.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m *coughs* a unique one, eh?</p>

<h2>Book Review: Lunch in Paris: A Love Story, With Recipes by 
Elizabeth&nbsp;Bard</h2> December 28, 2010 wolfshowl Leave a comment <br>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
 Elizabeth has always been drawn to museums 
and the Old World, so when she&rsquo;s doing her graduate work in London and 
meets Gwendal, a Frenchman, she jumps right into dating him.&nbsp; Gradually 
she falls for not just Gwendal, but Paris in general, especially the 
food.&nbsp; This memoir tells about her falling in love and the process of 
becoming an expat in France through the lens of food.</p> 
<p><strong>Review:</strong><br>
 This memoir starts out strong.&nbsp; Who 
doesn&rsquo;t enjoy a good real life love story?&nbsp; Paris sounds incredibly 
romantic and appealing to anyone who enjoys open food markets, museums, and the 
big city charm of small spaces.&nbsp; Two things held me back from really 
enjoying the book though.</p> 
<p>First, as a vegetarian, I really didn&rsquo;t appreciate the incredibly 
long and frequent sections describing eating meat, cooking meat, how awesome 
meat is, etc&hellip;&nbsp; Where Elizabeth describes her future husband, 
Gwendal, telling her &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; for the first time over a piece 
of bloody meat, I was thoroughly distracted by the poor, dead, bleeding 
animal.&nbsp; I could not identify with Elizabeth at all in these frequent 
sections.&nbsp; How can she claim to be a romantic at heart yet have so much of 
her life revolve around eating innocent creatures?&nbsp; I wound up skimming a 
lot.</p> 
<p>Granted, I know readers who enjoy eating meat themselves won&rsquo;t be 
bothered by these passages, but I am fairly certain they&rsquo;ll be irritated 
by the change of tone of voice partway through the narrative.&nbsp; From 
telling us about how lucky she is to be living this life in Paris, Elizabeth 
suddenly changes into a bit of a pity party.&nbsp; Poor Elizabeth, living in 
Paris with a man who loves her, cooking food for him every day, giving tours of 
the Louvre.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t how she imagined her life would work 
out.&nbsp; Um&hellip;.ok.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d suggest Elizabeth try reading some 
memoirs of true struggles such as<em>The Glass Castle</em> and get back to us.
</p> 
<p>Overall, the scenes of real Paris life are interesting and enjoyable, but 
the frequent scenes featuring bloody meat and Elizabeth&rsquo;s pity party 
really detract from the book.&nbsp; If you are a meat eater yourself and a 
foodie, you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy this memoir anyway.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d advise 
others to stay away.</p> 
<p><strong>3 out of 5 stars</strong></p>

<h2>Friday&nbsp;Fun!&nbsp;(On&nbsp;Thursday!)</h2> July 1, 2010 wolfshowl 8 
comments <br>

<p>Hello my lovely readers!&nbsp; You are getting this week&rsquo;s Friday Fun 
a day early because tomorrow&rsquo;s my birthday, and I took the day off work 
and will be staying far away from the computer all day!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m turning 
24!&nbsp; I have to say, ever since I turned 20, I just feel like I&rsquo;m 
improving with age. Like wine.&nbsp; Only with a lot more work than it takes 
for wine to get better with age, because let&rsquo;s face it, they just stick 
that shit in a cellar somewhere and abandon it, whereas I work damn hard to get 
better.&nbsp; Anywho.</p> 
<p>By some awesomeness two of my best gal pals and my boyfriend also have 
tomorrow off, so I&rsquo;ll be spending the day with them, getting bubble tea, 
going to a farmer&rsquo;s market, and probably hitting up a bookstore 
too.&nbsp; Of course one of my favorite veg restaurants will also be 
visited.&nbsp; Because of the fact that my birthday falls on a holiday weekend 
I tend to get my presents early or late or get informed of what I will be 
getting.&nbsp; My wonderful boyfriend gave me a brand-new camera last weekend, 
something I&rsquo;ve been wanting but unable to afford for FOREVER.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; My dad contributed money so I could get my a/c unit, and my brother 
informed me he&rsquo;ll be giving me homemade goat cheese he made himself from 
his own goats.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a whole bunch of awesomeness.&nbsp; Also, 
tonight I&rsquo;ll be going out to dinner with my third best gal pal (there are 
three of them), so the celebration is nicely spread out.</p> 
<p>I know, you guys do not care this much about my birthday, but I get four 
days off for it and am EXCITED!! Plus, I freaking love the 4th of July.&nbsp; I 
mean, one of my majors in uni was US History.&nbsp; Plus! The fireworks! The 
drinking! The bbq&rsquo;s! The music! Did I mention the fireworks? The 
fireworks!!</p> 
<p>Ok, that was a ridiculously excited post, but I think that&rsquo;s 
warranted if only for the fact that I have a four day weekend. Four. Days. 
Wheeeeee!</p> 
<p>Happy weekends, everyone! What will you be reading? What will you be doing 
for the 4th? *waves*</p> Categories: Friday Fun! Tags: 24, 4th of july, birthday

<h2>Meatfree Recipe: Sweet Curry Chickpea&nbsp;Casserole</h2> June 9, 2010 
wolfshowl Leave a comment <br>

<p><strong>The Result:</strong><br>
 A slightly spicy but simultaneously sweet 
curry that fills and warms your belly.&nbsp; Be sure to serve with rice and 
maybe naan.&nbsp; Once you have the spices in stock, it&rsquo;s also quite 
cheap!</p> 
<p><strong>The Recipe:</strong><br>
<em>Makes 4 servings</em><br>
 1 can 
<strong>or</strong> 2 1/2 to 3 cups cooked chickpeas<br>
 1 13.5 oz can light 
coconut milk (double this if you&rsquo;re leaving it in a crockpot all day)<br>

 3/4 cup red onion, chopped<br>
 1 1/2 cups celery, chopped<br>
 1 to 1 1/2 
cups sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped (approximately 1 medium-sized sweet 
potato)<br>
 1 to 1 1/2 cups Granny Smith apple, chopped (approximately 1 
medium-sized apple)<br>
 3 medium cloves garlic, minced<br>
 1 1/2 Tablespoon 
freshly grated ginger<strong>or</strong> 1 1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger<br>
 1 
1/2 Tablespoon mild red curry paste<br>
 2 teaspoon mustard seed <strong>or
</strong> 1/2 teaspoon ground mustard <strong>or</strong> 1/2 teaspoon mustard 
(the condiment)<br>
 1 teaspoon cumin seeds <strong>or</strong> 1/2 teaspoon 
ground cumin<br>
 1/2 teaspoon turmeric<br>
 3/4 teaspoon sea salt<br>
 1/8 
teaspoon allspice</p> 
<p>If you will be baking in the oven, preheat oven to 375 degrees.</p> 
<p>In a large, deep casserole dish, combine all the ingredients and stir until 
well-combined.&nbsp; Cover and bake for 30 minutes.&nbsp; Stir through, cover, 
and bake for another 30-40 minutes, until the veggies are tender.</p> 
<p>If you will be using a slow cooker, combine all ingredients in the 
crockpot.&nbsp; Set to low.&nbsp; It will be ready in around 5 hours.&nbsp; If 
you want to leave it all day, double the amount of coconut milk to 2 cans or 
put in one can and fill the can with water and add that to the crockpot as well.

<h2>Meatfree Recipe: Perfect Pizza&nbsp;Crust</h2> June 3, 2010 wolfshowl 2 
comments <br>

<p>People tend to not realize pizza&rsquo;s versatility.&nbsp; When it&rsquo;s 
home-made, you can actually make sure it is quite healthy, including being 
low-fat and low-calorie.&nbsp; It all comes down to what you put on it and what 
type of crust you make.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s red pizza (using marinara for 
sauce) white pizza (using olive oil and garlic for sauce) and pesto pizza 
(obviously using pesto for sauce).&nbsp; You can put pretty much any veggie on 
top of pizza.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s something that takes longer to cook, like 
broccoli, just quickly boil it for a couple of minutes to prep before slicing 
it up and putting it on the pizza.&nbsp; Even carrots and potatoes can go on 
the pizza.&nbsp; Just grate them up and put them on right after the 
sauce.&nbsp; The super-thin slices couples with the sauce makes them cook by 
the time you take the pizza out of the oven.&nbsp; Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid 
to put beans on your pizza for extra protein!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve put everything 
from chickpeas to black beans on mine.</p> 
<p>It took much experimenting with many pizza crust recipes and a bit of 
tweaking on the one I finally found that was close to what I wanted.&nbsp; The 
crust is the core of the pizza, so I present to you&ndash;the perfect pizza 
crust.</p> 
<p><strong>The Result:</strong><br>
 A wonderful warm, slightly crunchy, 
slighty bready, tinged with rosemary crust that perfectly holds its own to 
however many or few toppings you want.&nbsp; It works for thin or thick 
crust.&nbsp; If you want thin crust, either roll it out super thin and use a 
large pizza pan or divide it into two and make two regular-sized pizzas.&nbsp; 
For thicker crust, just roll it out to a regular pizza-size.</p> 
<p><strong>The Recipe:</strong><br>
 1 cup warm water<br>
 1 packet yeast<br>
 
1 Tablespoon sugar<br>
 1 Tablespoon dried rosemary<br>
 2 Tablespoons olive oil
<br> pinch of sea salt<br>
 1 1/8 cup whole wheat flour<br>
 1 1/8 cup white 
flour<br>
 More flour for rolling out the dough</p> 
<p>Put the water in a large bowl.&nbsp; Add the yeast and the sugar.&nbsp; 
Allow the yeast to work for about a minute.</p> 
<p>Add in olive oil, rosemary, whole wheat flour, and white flour.</p> 
<p>Mix.&nbsp; I use a hand-held electric dough hook, but it works by hand or 
with a real electric mixer too.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re using a dough hook, the 
dough is ready when it starts to climb up the hook.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re doing 
it by hand, it&rsquo;s when the dough is no longer watery but still kind of 
sticky.</p> 
<p>Put the dough in an oiled bowl in a warm location.&nbsp; I use my 
microwave, personally.&nbsp; Allow to rise for 30 to 45 minutes.&nbsp; 45 
minutes is better, but if you&rsquo;re pressed for time, 30 minutes is ok.</p> 
<p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.&nbsp; Prep your toppings.</p> 
<p>Spread out flour on a surface.&nbsp; Flour your rolling pin.&nbsp; Plop the 
dough on the surface.&nbsp; Flip it a few times to spread out the flour.&nbsp; 
Roll to your desired size.</p> 
<p>Top with whatever toppings you want.</p> 
<p>Cook for 15 to 25 minutes.&nbsp; How long depends on how many toppings you 
put on/what your oven is like/what mood the dough is in.</p> 
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Meatfree Recipe: Sweet Potato Salad with Apple and&nbsp;Avocado</h2> May 
26, 2010 wolfshowl 4 comments <br>

<p><strong>The Result:</strong><br>
 A slightly tangy, genuinely refreshing, 
cold, cooked veg salad that is full of nutrients and very filling!&nbsp; It 
tastes better when it&rsquo;s allowed to sit a while in the fridge.&nbsp; You 
do need to cut up the avocado and add it just before serving to prevent the 
avocado from browning, however.&nbsp; Perfect food to make ahead of time to eat 
later.</p> 
<p><strong>The Recipe:</strong><em><br>
 Approximately 4 servings</em><br>
 1 
ear of corn (approximately 1/4 of a cup)<br>
 1lb sweet potatoes peeled and cut 
into 1/2 inch cubes<br>
 1/4 cup unsalted, hulled pumpkin seeds or pepitas (You 
can toast them or not, whatever floats your boat)<strong>or</strong> chopped 
walnuts<br>
 1 medium apple (any variety)<br>
 1/2 cup onion, finely chopped<br>
 1/4 cup chopped cilantro (It&rsquo;ll be fine without it if you don&rsquo;t 
have some handy)<br>
 1/4 cup lime juice (approximately 2 limes)<br>
 2 Tbs 
olive oil<br>
 avocado, finely diced</p> 
<p>Bring a pot of water to boil.&nbsp; Place the ear of corn in and cook until 
a fork can easily stick into the kernels, approximately 7 to 10 minutes.&nbsp; 
Drain and set aside to cool.</p> 
<p>Place sweet potatoes in a sauce pan, cover with water, bring to a boil and 
boil until tender, about 3 minutes.&nbsp; Drain in colander and rinse 
immediately under cold water to cool.&nbsp; Drain well.</p> 
<p>Cut corn kernels from the cob.</p> 
<p>Combine apple, onion, cilantro, corn, and lime juice in a large bowl. Stir 
in sweet potatoes and oil.&nbsp; Stir in avocado and seeds/nuts just before 
serving.</p>

<h2>Meatfree Recipe: Whole Wheat Zucchini&nbsp;Muffins</h2> May 20, 2010 
wolfshowl 2 comments <br>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
 I am very supportive of the Meatless 
Mondays movement, which is indicative of the movement in general to get 
Americans to eat less meat.&nbsp; Although I believe in vegetarianism, I 
whole-heartedly support any movement in that direction.&nbsp; Even if a person 
goes from eating meat at two meals a day to eating meat at one meal a day, 
that&rsquo;s fewer animals being killed for food a year.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a 
step in the right direction.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been wondering what I can do to 
support this, so I&rsquo;ve decided to periodically blog meatfree recipes that 
I&rsquo;ve made at least once and have enjoyed.&nbsp; Although I will offer 
sources, I generally tweak recipes a wee bit when I make them, so if you would 
like to see the original recipe, definitely check out the source.&nbsp; First 
up, zucchini muffins!</p> 
<p><strong>The Result:</strong><br>
 This recipe yields 12 regular-sized 
delicious, low-fat, low-calorie muffins chock full of nutty protein.&nbsp; They 
make a great breakfast or snack on the go, and are yummy warm or cold.</p> 
<p><strong>The Recipe:</strong><br>
 1 egg<br>
 2/3 cup sugar<br>
 1 1/2 cups 
grated zucchini (squeezed to remove excess liquid then stuffed into measuring 
cup)<br>
 1/3 cup melted butter<br>
 1 1/4 tsp baking soda<br>
 pinch of salt
<br> 3/4 cup white flour<br>
 3/4 cup whole wheat flour<br>
 1 tsp cinnamon<br>

 1/4 tsp nutmeg<br>
 1 cup chopped almonds (you can use walnuts or pecans, 
pretty much any nut you have on-hand)</p>  Preheat oven to 350F. Grate zucchini 
by hand or using a food processor, then gently squeeze grated zucchini to 
remove some of the water. Measure 1 1/2 cups (packed) zucchini for this recipe, 
and if you have extra, freeze it for another time. 
<p>In a medium-sized bowl, beat egg, then add vanilla and sugar and mix to 
combine. Stir in the grated zucchini, then the butter. Sprinkle baking soda and 
salt over the top of this and mix in.</p> 
<p>In a smaller bowl, combine white whole wheat flour, cinnamon and nutmeg. 
Stir dry ingredients into the zucchini mixture, then fold in chopped almonds .
</p> 
<p>Spray muffin pan or individual muffin cups with non-stick spray or 
vegetable oil, then divide batter evenly among cups to make 12 muffins. Bake 
for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out 
clean.</p> <strong>5 out of 5 stars</strong> <strong><br>

<h2>Wolf Bite Wednesday (Hypocrisy of Humane Animal&nbsp;Farming)</h2> 
February 24, 2010 wolfshowl 9 comments <br>

<p>As a libertarian, I believe that adults should be able to do whatever they 
want to do as long as it doesn&rsquo;t harm other living creatures.&nbsp; This 
means that in what society sees as gray areas, I go with whatever side allows 
for more choice.&nbsp; It also means I try to avoid being 
&ldquo;militant&rdquo; about anything and just hope that with the evidence I 
calmly present, people will change their minds.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no matter 
how many times you present the evidence that evolution is real, some people 
still choose to teach their children that god made woman out of Adam&rsquo;s 
rib.</p> 
<p>One thing that I cannot stand and won&rsquo;t stay quiet about, though, is 
hypocrisy, and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been seeing cropping up more and 
more in the green movement.&nbsp; You guys all know that I&rsquo;m a 
vegetarian.&nbsp; I wholeheartedly believe this is the right choice, and 
it&rsquo;s one I want more people to make.&nbsp; However, I respect whatever 
choice people make, because what you eat is your own business.&nbsp; I have no 
problem with omnivores who say they enjoy being at the top of the food chain, 
that we&rsquo;re naturally predators so we may as well enjoy it, 
etc&hellip;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve decided what matters to them while 
acknowledging that this choice causes pain.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t agree with the 
choice, but it&rsquo;s not hypocritical.&nbsp; I also have no problem with 
people who want organic animal farming due to a concern about chemicals in 
meat.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s kind of a silly thing to be concerned about, but 
again it&rsquo; s not hypocritical.</p> 
<p>However, I have a serious problem with you people who purport to support 
organic &ldquo;humane&rdquo; animal farming out of a concern for the well-being 
of the animals and not yourself..&nbsp; You are not concerned about the 
well-being of the animals.&nbsp; If you were, you wouldn&rsquo;t ask for them 
to die so you can enjoy a hamburger when you live in a nation with plenty of 
other ways to healthily feed yourself.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re claiming that you 
want the animals to be happy?&nbsp; Take any animal from an organic farm and 
compare it being slaughtered to one being slaughtered at a factory farm.&nbsp; 
Neither of them wants to die.&nbsp; They both cry.&nbsp; They both struggle to 
get away.&nbsp; In a sense, it&rsquo;s more humane for the factory farm to 
slaughter their animals, because they are in pain and suffering 
constantly.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re advocating to give an animal a paradise type of 
environment and then rip them out of it to kill them.&nbsp; That does not make 
you a good person!!! DOES NOT.&nbsp; It makes you a hypocrite.&nbsp; If you 
actually cared about the animals, you wouldn&rsquo;t eat them.&nbsp; It really 
is that simple.</p> Categories: Causes, Vegetarianism, Wolf Bite Wednesday Tags:

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a vegetarian for three years.&nbsp; A diet choice that is 
not particularly popular in the United States but is at least gaining 
recognition in the general public.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not the proselytizing type 
of vegetarian.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t confront people about it unless they bring 
it up (or they willingly read my blog, hah).&nbsp; The most I do unprovoked is 
to say that I&rsquo;m a vegetarian and sometimes further explain what my 
dietary restrictions are if the person doesn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I choose to be 
this way, because I&rsquo;m a libertarian, and I believe that what a person 
eats is her choice, even if I disagree with it and wish she wouldn&rsquo;t eat 
that way.&nbsp; So I keep my mouth shut about all the reasons to be vegetarian 
unless they ask me, which happens a surprising amount.</p> 
<p>Anyway, for the most part my lack of militance is met with a similar lack 
of confrontation in return.&nbsp; They may get a confused look on their face, 
but that&rsquo;s generally about it.&nbsp; In fact, I&rsquo;m pleased that for 
the most part, people are genuinely nice about it and express concern in the 
restaurant or in their house that what I eat isn&rsquo;t against my 
morals.&nbsp; I greatly appreciate this.&nbsp; Sometimes though, I have a much 
more negative experience.</p> 
<p>An example of such a situation happened last night.&nbsp; I was out at a 
pub with four other gals, one of whom is vegetarian like me.&nbsp; A couple of 
the omni girls were discussing ordering a pizza, when one of them asked if we 
liked steak, to which the other one responded, &ldquo;Oh they&rsquo;re both 
vegetarian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Myself and the other veg nodded to which the 
Questioner responded, &ldquo;Hahahaha, oh really? I ate a baby cow earlier 
today, hahahaha.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Even though this pissed me off, I ignored it.&nbsp; Myself and the other 
veg turned down pizza, getting fries instead, and the omnis got a steak and 
potato pizza.&nbsp; After it arrived the Questioner again started gleefully 
shoving in our faces the fact that she was eating an animal, had earlier that 
day, and would continue to, repeatedly mentioning baby animals in particular.
</p> 
<p>It is hard enough for me to smell and see meat.&nbsp; Seriously, it grosses 
me out, and normally I only am able to maintain my appetite when eating with 
omnis by just making myself &ldquo;forget&rdquo; that they&rsquo;re eating 
meat.&nbsp; Like I said earlier.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s their choice, and I 
don&rsquo;t want diet differences to come between me and my friendships.</p> 
<p>However, it is just not cool to gleefully wave in a known 
vegetarian&rsquo;s face that you&rsquo;re eating an animal.&nbsp; Imagine if 
you were eating dinner out with a cannibal who started to gleefully tell you 
how they&rsquo;d just eaten a baby&rsquo;s brains that morning.&nbsp; Would you 
be able to stomach your own food?&nbsp; Would you be comfortable or happy at 
all?</p> 
<p>And this sort of thing isn&rsquo;t a random occurrence.&nbsp; It happens 
with relative regularity.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been taunted by small time farmers 
who tell me all about how they&rsquo;re going to slaughter the chickens that 
day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had omnis regale me with the sheer animalistic pleasure 
they feel in ripping meat apart with their teeth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve also been 
taunted that I look ghostly or gaunt and clearly I must be vitamin 
deficient.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve also been told that I&rsquo;m slowly starving 
myself to death.</p> 
<p>Well, you know what?&nbsp; Vegetarians get it that you like to eat 
meat.&nbsp; If you didn&rsquo;t want to eat meat, you wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; 
Ranting to us about how much you love to eat meat reeks either of immaturity or 
insecurity.&nbsp; Either you enjoy an easy way to make someone uncomfortable in 
a social situation or our choice makes you feel insecure for whatever 
reason.&nbsp; Maybe you really do feel guilty for eating meat so you lash 
out.&nbsp; Maybe you&rsquo;re worried that suddenly the US will become 
predominantly vegetarian instead of omnivore.&nbsp; All I know is, you&rsquo;re 
not being respectful of other human beings when you act this way.</p> 
<p>I know some vegetarians can be militant, but if the vegetarian you&rsquo;re 
around right that instant isn&rsquo;t being militant and all that happened is 
she stated she&rsquo;s vegetarian, just nod and say &ldquo;ok,&rdquo; and leave 
it at that.&nbsp; I respect your right to your food choices.&nbsp; You should 
respect mine.</p> Categories: Causes, Vegetarianism Tags: baby animal, how to,

<h3>Quote of the Week</h3>  &ldquo;Being happy or not is up to you. A man 
can&rsquo;t make a woman happy. It&rsquo;s like asking a cat to grow wings. 
It&rsquo;s not in their nature. Happiness is in here.&rdquo;<br>
