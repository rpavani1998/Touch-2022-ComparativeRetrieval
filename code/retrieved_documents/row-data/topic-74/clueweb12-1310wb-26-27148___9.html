<h1>News release</h1> 
<p>16 May 2008</p> 
<h2>Paris EUROPLACE meets high level delegation from the City of London</h2> 
<p><strong>Paris, May 16, 2008</strong>. In the context of the French 
Presidency of the European Union beginning of July 2008, Paris EUROPLACE and 
the City of London have met to discuss and define their common vision and 
priorities. A joint committee was co-chaired by Michel P&eacute;bereau, 
Chairman of BNP Paribas and Andr&eacute; Villeneuve, Chairman of City of London 
EU Advisory Group, and was joined by City of London Lord Mayor David Lewis and 
the City of London Corporation&rsquo;s Policy Chairman Stuart Fraser, during 
their official visit to France prior to the EU Presidency.</p> 
<p>A consensus was reached on the way ahead for European financial integration 
and on the framework of priorities to be delivered in order to lead the global 
competition. Overall it was deemed necessary to improve the conditions of the 
European integration whilst respecting global best practices and avoiding 
overregulation and bureaucratic processes: there are a number of important 
areas (insurance, asset management, post-market activities, enhancement of the 
Lamfalussy process&hellip;) that require both new measures combined with the 
need of a convergent implementation of texts and practices born from the 
completion of the 2000-2005 program (FSAP).</p> 
<p>Lord Mayor David Lewis, who is the global ambassador for the UK-based 
financial services industry, said &ldquo;Despite current world turmoil, 
financial markets are still the key to economic growth and there is no way to 
avoid the fact that in a globalised world our financial services must be 
competitive on a global basis&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Policy chairman Stuart Fraser, whose elected role to the City centres on 
issues such as working with Europe, said: &ldquo;the key priority is: 
furthering Europe&rsquo;s integration, in order to take advantage as soon as 
possible of the domestic market of 500 millions citizens and in turn 
strengthening the global efficiency&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, Michel P&eacute;bereau adds that &ldquo;in order to increase 
European financial services&rsquo; global competitiveness, targeted 
harmonisation initiatives should be launched on following topics: asset 
management, insurance, retail banking and post trade&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Two important areas of concerns highlighted under the French Presidency:</p>
<p>First, in order to ensure financial stability, the EU regulatory framework 
must secure closer supervisory coordination. The Lamfalussy process must be 
improved following the &quot;better regulation&quot; principle. Member States 
should urge their national regulators to integrate the EU dimension in their 
mandate and increase their convergence of practices and their level of 
information sharing, including the &quot;comply or explain&quot; principle. 
Even if the implementation of this process is globally a success, the three 
Level Three committees, should be gradually reinforced with regards to 
resources, decision making rules and visibility. Especially in the view of a 
more efficient prudential supervision of pan European groups, the priority 
shall be given to the functioning of the college of supervisors and to a lead 
home supervisor concept. CEBS should be given the task to monitor coherence 
between those colleges.</p> 
<p>As far as the global dimension is concerned, mutual recognition is a good 
approach. It should be pragmatically applied, on selected topics and on 
condition that common principles maintain a level playing field between defined 
areas. This process should be driven according to a European framework and on 
the basis of compatible local regulatory practices. In any case, Paris 
EUROPLACE and the City of London support the multilateral dialog approach, 
which involves a step toward the mutual recognition.</p> 
<p>Secondly Paris EUROPLACE and the City of London have identified five 
business priorities for 2008:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Asset management: UCITS IV Directive is a major priority in order to 
finalise the global competitiveness of the European fund industry. Three areas 
should be improved: enhancement of the &ldquo;product&rdquo; passport (faster 
and simplified procedures), including cross-border master-feeders and 
transnational UCITS mergers, a coherent and simplified prospectus, and most 
importantly the implementation of a full passport for fund management 
companies. It&rsquo;s essential to ensure that the UCITs framework fosters 
financial innovation.</li> 
<li>Insurance: The reform of the prudential framework with the Solvency II 
Directive is a major step forward and a top priority. It will modernize the 
measurement of insurance risks in order to ensure highly harmonized protection 
of consumers and the competitiveness of European financial actors. It should be 
based on economic prudential requirements, allowing better capital allocation, 
including at group level, and it should bring improvements of risk assessment 
and management by insurance companies. It should be based on economic 
prudential requirements, allowing better capital allocation, including at group 
level, and it should bring improvements of risk assessment and management by 
insurance companies.</li> </ul> 
<p>In this respect, crucial choices will have to be done to ensure that the 
new reform will effectively really modernize the insurance supervision and take 
into account risks appropriately:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The minimum capital requirements (MCR) calculation must use a risk 
sensitive methodology in line with the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).</li> 
<li>The economic assessment of the risks and requirements concerning groups 
must be carried out at the consolidated level. The respective powers of the 
supervisor of the parent company and the supervisors of local subsidiaries will 
have to be organized consequently in a rational manner.</li> 
<li>The principle of risk assessment on a one-year view proposed by the 
European Commission must be implemented appropriately to companies over long 
term risks in order to avoid detrimental effects for the consumers</li> 
<li>Accounting standards: The convergence of global standards is a common 
objective. Nevertheless, the recent crisis showed the weaknesses of the full 
fair market value approach. The evolution of such global standard should 
respond to the users&rsquo; needs. In particular the industry is opposed to the 
extension of fair valuation to the banking book. Consequently, the governance 
of the IASB board should be adjusted to take on board such needs and be 
articulated with national or regional processes integrating those standards. 
Furthermore, the IASB board should enter into a constructive dialogue with the 
industry.</li> 
<li>Pensions: it is suitable to develop pan European pension products, with a 
harmonized and economic based prudential framework. This is a key issue for 
answering the needs of European citizens and for the European economic growth.
</li> 
<li>Retail banking: harmonisation of consumer protection rules is key to 
provide more choice and to reduce prices for retail financial products. 
Therefore a targeted harmonization process should be a prerequisite to trigger 
more progress in the European retail banking market.</li> 
<li>Post-trade: In this area Europe is still too fragmented and not 
competitive enough. There is a view that the Code of Conduct will fail to 
deliver all initial expectations. Recent initiatives and evaluation process 
will come to a conclusion in a few months, but it appears that the 
interoperability and the segregation between general interest and commercial 
functions, which are the main issues addressed by the Code, may not be reached. 
On this basis major orientations should be decided before the end of 2008, such 
as the Legal Certainty Group&rsquo;s proposals on securities Law. This is 
expected to solve some Giovannini barriers and improve interoperability 
conditions for market infrastructures. Those proposals should be driven by 
effective cost reductions, precise governance principles to manage the relevant 
projects in the interest of all parties concerned and assuring its ability to 
evolve at the right speed to respond to users&rsquo; needs.</li> </ul> 
<p>To enlarge this level of consensus, Paris EUROPLACE and the City of London 
agreed to set up few task forces to identify and document specific issues on 
critical and important areas. Those task forces will address the following 
topics:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>alter UCITs</li> 
<li>transatlantic dialogue</li> 
<li>pension funds</li> 
<li>post-trade</li> 
<li>accountancy standards</li> </ul>
