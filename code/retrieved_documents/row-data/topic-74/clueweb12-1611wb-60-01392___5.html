 Paris <br>
 Paris assaults the senses, demanding to 
be seen, heard, touched, tasted and smelled. Gaze impressive monuments and 
savor its gourmet pastiche of cheese, chocolate, wine and seafood. Paris is a 
city of vast perspectives and intimate streets, of formal espaces verts (green 
open spaces) and of quiet squares. Paris is relatively small as capitals go, 
with distances between many of its major sights and museums invariably 
walkable. Unforgettable walks exhibiting the best of Paris: stroll down the 
Champs-Elysees for the chic grand boulevard experience and Rue Cler for a more 
intimate snapshot of Parisian living.  Paris <br>

London<br>
 London just isn't what it used to be. It's better! A blend of old 
and new, pace and buzz alongside peace and tranquility, and an amazingly 
diverse cultural scene. The sounds of Brit-pop and techno pour out of Victorian 
pubs; experimental theater is popping up on stages built for Shakespeare's 
plays; and Brits are even running the couture houses of Dior and Givenchy. In 
food, fashion, film, music, the visual arts, and just about everything else, 
London stands at the cutting edge again, just as it did in the 1960s. But rest 
assured that traditional London survives.  London <br>
