 The intellectual, gastronomical, fashion 
and cultural capital of the world. City of light. City of love. City of life! 
From the Eiffel Tower, the Arrondissements of Paris radiate before you like 
spokes on a wheel. Notre Dame's delicate buttresses almost take flight beside 
the River Seine. The indescribable, uncountable glories of the Louvre begin 
with the Mona Lisa and never end. The Arc de Triumphe and the Champs-Elysees, 
Montemartre and the Left Bank. And of course there's the food, in cafes, 
bistros, and Michelin-starred restaurants. <br>
