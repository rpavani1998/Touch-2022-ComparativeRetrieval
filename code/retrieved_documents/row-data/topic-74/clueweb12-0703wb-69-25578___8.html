<h1>Top 10 Things to do in Paris</h1> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Wheel Deals&nbsp;</b><br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The Segway was meant to 
revolutionise the way we lived, reduce the need for walking and reclaim the 
streets for car-less citizens. These emission-less transporters didn't quite 
take the world by storm but they have become quite popular among tourists on 
the streets of Paris. It'll take you a little while to get your centre of 
balance accustomed to this pressure sensitive propulsion, but when you get 
going there's nothing like it. The tours kick off from rue Edgar Faure and a 
major Segway selling point is the elevated, celebrity spotting, vantage point 
that these clever little devices offer. I managed to pick Groundhog Day's Andie 
MacDowell out from the crowd on the bridge between the Louvre and the 
Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay!<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Bike Tours</b>&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
 If 
you've seen the infamous online video of Paris Hilton falling off a Segway and 
you don't fancy doing the same in her namesake city, then fear not because 
there are bike tours on offer too. The Fat Bike Tours set off from the same 
location and take in the sites at a slightly more leisurely and less 
technologically advanced pace. The bikes also have that unbeatable Amelie 
&ndash;esk quality with wicker baskets and silver bells, and they're also a 
cheaper alternative to the flash-packing Segway. Add to that an eternally 
cheerful and enthusiastic head office and you're laughing.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;
</li> 
<li><b>The Louvre</b>&nbsp;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
 The Louvre is 
possibly the world's most well known museum and definitely the most visited 
historical repository on the planet. It is impressive but like most 
internationally infamous exhibits, it's crowded, over-protected by over-eager 
security staff and ruined by the erratic and unpredictable walking patterns of 
pedestrian tourists. The top attraction is the eyebrow-less beauty &ndash; Mona 
Lisa, but it's hard to appreciate this masterpiece when you have to stand in 
line for ten minutes, squint through the glass screen and compensate for the 
never-ending flash photography.<br>
 &nbsp;</li> 
<li><b>Musee d'Orsay&nbsp;<br>
</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
 
A far superior option is the Musee d'Orsay. The architecture of this former 
train station is equally grand to that of the Louvre and the collection 
includes an eye opening line up of Impressionist masterpieces. Degas is a 
favourite front runner and if you're a fan of the Belle &Eacute;poque then this 
is a true treat. Monet and Manet go head to head with Toulouse Lautrec in the 
visually impressive leagues and Ferdinand Hodler holds his own in a slightly 
more adult and disturbing insight, into turn of the century art. On top of that 
the clock tower caf&eacute; upstairs serves up delicious, affordable, fresh and 
filling soups. This is good stuff.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>The Rest For Less<br>
</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;<br>
 If you're a museum junkie and want to enjoy the Louvre, the Musee 
d'Orsay and then some &ndash; then it's certainly worth investing in a Paris 
Museum Pass. These two, four and six day passes were put together by the Paris 
Tourism Office and they get you into more than sixty museums and monuments in 
the French capital. I'd recommend a two day pass for &euro;30. In context you 
can visit and appreciate approximately ten attractions in two days. The average 
price of these attractions works out at about &euro;9 each - so ten multiplied 
by nine gives you the travel budget draining total of &euro;90. The two day, 
&euro;30 Museum Pass therefore saves you two thirds of this and in certain 
situations, you get to queue jump too!<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Skate Paris<br>
</b> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 If you're a - 
cram it all into a couple of hours - kind of backpacker then you might want to 
check out The French equivalent to the popular Wednesday night skates around 
London. Every week you have a great skating tour which traverses the avenues of 
Paris. I accidentally encountered several thousand skaters on their Sunday 
jaunt &ndash; complete with a police escort. Being a pedestrian spectator in 
this city centre closing situation wasn't much fun, so it's best to be a part 
of it or avoid the skates completely - on Fridays and Sundays.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Bateaux Mouche&nbsp;<br>
</b> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 
Boat trips along city centre rivers are usually accompanied by a sky high price 
tag but refreshingly - that's not the case in Paris. Yes it's an automated 
commentary in several million languages and yes, this cuts down the historical 
narrative to the bare minimum, but for &euro;9 (&euro;6 with concessions) you 
can't really complain. The big boats of the Bateaux-Mouches company depart and 
drop off at the Port de la Conference &ndash; not far from the Eiffel Tower. 
The tour takes you up stream as far as Quai D'Austerlitz , circles back around 
Notre Dame, down to the mini Statue of Liberty on the Pont de Grenelle and then 
back to base &ndash; past the Eiffel Tower. If you're on a super tight budget 
then skip it, but if you're after some Sex and the City-esk nostalgia, then 
give it a go.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>The Eiffel Tower&nbsp;<br>
</b> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
 It's an icon, it was never meant to be a permanent feature and the 
hourly evening light shows are a very pretty sight to behold, but this aside, 
the Eiffel Tower is a complete waste of money and the views aren't that great. 
On a good day you're looking at a one and a half hour queue, a fifteen minute 
ascent and a crowded viewing platform - which gets a bit steamed up in the 
winter months. A cheaper alternative with a better view is the Tour 
Montparnasse. This is the only sky scraper in Paris and photos taken from its 
viewing deck include the tower. The nearest Metro station for this sky high 
wonder is Montparnasse Bienvenue and it's generally open between 10.30am and 
11pm - all year round.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Public Transport in Paris&nbsp;<br>
</b> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
 The underground rail network in Paris is cheap, safe and covers the 
entire city without forking into an unmanageable mess. It's not as clean as the 
London Underground but at &euro;1.60 for a single ticket to anywhere in the 
city, who wouldn't get a little bit dirty? You also save even more money when 
you buy a book of tickets from the electronic vending machines. Conveniently 
these dish out instructions in a variety of languages! The wisest thing to do 
is fill your pockets with cheap, single fare tickets when you arrive at the 
Eurostar terminus or the airport, and also grab a map of the colourful 
underground lines.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Pere Lachaise&nbsp;<br>
</b> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
 Going out of your way to make a cemetery part of your tourist trip 
might seem a little morose but the Pere Lachaise is worth breaking the mould 
for. This peaceful plot in the east of the city is the final resting place of 
Mr Oscar Wilde, Jim Morrison, Delacroix and a stunning mix of historically 
significant figures. It's a big place and therefore easy to get lost in. Add to 
that the army of Citroens driven by the legions of cemetery attendants and you 
have a recipe for stress. To avoid this, buy a &euro;2 map from the newspaper 
stall when you exit the Pere Lachaise Metro station. Not only does this allow 
you to cut through the pedestrianised tomb divisions, but it's also a nice 
little memento of something a little bit different in Paris.</li> </ol> <b>-
