<p>Now includes ALL government taxes &amp; fees!</p> <br>

<h3>Transportation / Walking on tour</h3> Round-trip flights arrive in London 
and depart from Amsterdam. Your transfer upon arrival in London is provided by 
Hotel by Bus transfer service, and you can find them at a desk when you make 
your way through customs and baggage. Included transportation on &ldquo;London, 
Paris and Amsterdam&rdquo; is by private motorcoach, the Eurostar high-speed 
train from London to Paris and the Thayls train from Paris to Amsterdam. In 
your free time, you may wish to explore the cities by public transportation. 
London&rsquo;s tube system, consisting of 12 lines, needs no introduction. 
Tickets and passes can be purchased in singles or in bulk. London also has an 
extensive (and perhaps more fun to ride) bus system. Paris&rsquo; massive 
M&eacute;tro is world-class, easy to navigate and efficient. Make sure to take 
time and look for the best deal on travel passes. Ask your tour director which 
one might work best. Often the daily passes are not actually the best deal. The 
best way to get around Amsterdam is on foot, although for a lovely tour, 
consider taking a cruise along the canals.<br>
