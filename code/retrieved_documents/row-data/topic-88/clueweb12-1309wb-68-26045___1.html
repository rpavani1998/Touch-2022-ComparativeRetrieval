<h2>Product Description</h2>  Author: Edith Stein (St. Teresa Benedicta of the 
Cross). Editor: Marianne Sawicki. Translated by Mary Catherine Baseheart and 
Marianne Sawicki. 324 pg. PB.<br>
<br>
Presents the saint's analysis of the 
interplay between the philosophy of psychology and cultural studies, 
particularly psychoanalytic theory and behaviorism. In this volume, her most 
profound and carefully argued phenomenology of human creativity, Edith Stein 
explores the interplay of causal constraints and motivated choices. She 
demonstrates that physical events and physiological processes do not entirely 
determine behavior; the energy deployed for living and creativity exceeds what 
comes to us through physical means. The human body is a complex interface 
between the material world and an equally real world of personal value.<br>
<br>
The body opens as well to community. Stein shows that, strictly speaking, there 
is no such thing as a solitary human being. Communities are reservoirs of the 
meaning and value that fuel both our everyday choices and our 
once-in-a-lifetime accomplishments. This basic fact, she argues, is the 
starting point for any viable political or social theory.<br>
<br>
The two 
treatises in this book comprise her post-doctoral dissertation that Stein wrote 
to qualify for a teaching job at a German university just after the First World 
War. They ring with the joy, hope, and confidence of a brilliant young scholar. 
Today they continue to challenge the major schools of twentieth-century 
psychology and cultural studies, particularly psychoanalytic theory and 
behaviorism. Here, too, is the intellectual manifesto of a woman who would go 
on to become a Christian and a Carmelite nun, only to be killed at Auschwitz 
like so many others of Jewish ancestry. <br>
