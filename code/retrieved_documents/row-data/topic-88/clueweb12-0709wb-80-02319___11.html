<h2>  PHILOSOPHY PROGRAMS </h2> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are many interesting possibilities of combining philosophy with 
courses in other departments; for instance one can study the philosophy of a 
period and also its history or its literature; one can study art or science and 
also the philosophy of art (aesthetics) or the philosophy of science. A double 
major or combined honours program permits a more thorough interdisciplinary 
exploration of appropriate themes.</p> 
<p>Programs and courses should be chosen carefully, in consultation with the 
department. For the grades required in major and in honours programs, seeSocial 
Sciences and Humanities Regulations<b>page 202</b>.</p> 
<p>Students are also advised of the interdisciplinary minor concentrations in 
Gerontology,<b>page 217</b>, and Women's Studies, <b>page 254</b>.<br>
