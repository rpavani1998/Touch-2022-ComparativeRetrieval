<h2>Philosophy of Psychology</h2> 
<p>  The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Psychology by John Symons and 
Paco Calvo (Routledge Philosophy Companions) is an invaluable guide and major 
reference source to the major topics, problems, concepts and debates in 
philosophy of psychology and is the first companion of its kind. A team of 
renowned international contributors provide forty-two chapters organised 
into&nbsp;six clear parts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>I. Historical background to the philosophy of psychology</li> 
<li>II. Psychological explanation</li> 
<li>III. Cognition and representation</li> 
<li>IV. The biological basis of psychology</li> 
<li>V. Perceptual experience</li> 
<li>VI. Personhood</li> </ul> 
<p>The <em>Companion</em> covers key topics such as the origins of 
experimental psychology; folk psychology; behaviorism and functionalism; 
philosophy, psychology and neuroscience; the language of thought, modularity, 
nativism and representational theories of mind; consciousness and the senses; 
personal identity; the philosophy of psychopathology and dreams, emotion and 
temporality.</p> 
<p>Essential reading for all students of philosophy of mind, science and 
psychology,<em>The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Psychology</em> will 
also be of interest to anyone studying psychology and its related disciplines.

<p>Excerpt:  The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Psychology follows Ned 
Block's classic anthology, Readings in Philosophy of Psychology (1980/1) by 
nearly thirty years. The differences between these two books signal the changed 
character, as well as the dramatic expansion, of the field. In this 
introduction, we describe some of the prominent characteristics of the 
Companion and explain how it reflects the current state of the field.</p> 
<p>In recent decades and across almost all domains in the brain and behavioral 
sciences, there has been a steady push towards multidisciplinary collaboration 
and cooperation. This development means that it has become increasingly 
difficult to draw nonarbitrary disciplinary boundaries between research 
programs. Philosophers of psychology have been influenced by and have responded 
to the growing interdisciplinarity of the psychological enterprise. As 
psychological research has become an increasingly inclusive endeavor, 
encompassing a broad range of inquiries &acirc;&#128;&#148; from 
molecular-level investigations to social and organizational psychology 
&acirc;&#128;&#148; philosophy of psychology has grown well beyond its original 
set of core concerns. Today, the philosophy of psychology has its own agendas 
and is motivated by concerns which can be distinguished from those problems and 
questions that informed its roots in philosophy of mind. No longer is 
philosophy of psychology directed solely towards questions of rationality, 
modularity, nativism and intentionality. This is probably the most obvious 
change in the thirty years since the publication of Block's anthology.</p> 
<p>Contemporary philosophers of psychology are engaged with one of the most 
intense and diverse projects in the history of science. Given the scale of 
psychological research today, it is useful to maintain some sensitivity to the 
broader intellectual context which informs our investigation into mental life. 
We believe that appreciation of the major positions which frame current debates 
is improved by attending to the historical development of the relevant concepts 
and methods. In this spirit, the purpose of Part One is to present the 
necessary historical background for the discussions which follow. It provides a 
selective tour of the relevant history of psychology and philosophy, moving 
from the origins of psychology in early-modern philosophy to twentieth-century 
debates between behaviorists and cognitivists. These essays should counteract
</p> 
<p>the tendency to see contemporary debates, especially those concerning 
representation and computation, as straightforward products of the cognitive 
revolution, allowing students to recognize that the issues at stake have their 
roots in discussions that date back well before the heyday of cognitivism in 
the 1960s and 1970s.</p> 
<p>Part Two explores the nature of psychological explanation and its 
relationship to various models of mental life. In the early 1980s, philosophers 
of psychology had settled into a consensus with respect to the demise of 
behaviorism and the centrality of cognitivist architectures. This model assumed 
a functionalist metaphysical framework, a computationalist approach to 
explanation, and a central role for representation. Part Two reflects 
developments in the intervening years, by presenting the more critical 
contemporary approach to psychological explanation, folk psychology and 
functionalism. Alternative explanatory frameworks to cognitivism are explained 
and defended in detail. Connectionism and the embodied/embedded framework not 
only represent novel approaches to cognitive architecture but also present 
fundamental challenges to the cognitivist views of psychological explanation. 
This plurality of explanatory frameworks is one of the hallmarks of 
contemporary philosophy of psychology. Furthermore, philosophers disagree as to 
precisely how we ought to characterize the target of psychological explanation. 
The elusiveness of the target of psychological explanation has direct 
methodological consequences regardless of one's favored model of mind. These 
challenges are discussed in detail in Part Two.</p> 
<p>Part Three reviews the well-known cluster of questions related to the 
nature of cognition and representation. The problems addressed here relate to 
both the architecture within which representational states are couched and to 
the possibility of naturalizing content. For the most part, these essays fall 
close to the subject matter of mainstream debates in the philosophy of mind. 
However, as described in Part Three, philosophers of psychology have also 
challenged the foundational assumptions which govern these debates.</p> 
<p>One of the central concerns in the recent philosophy has been the 
difficulty of accounting for intentionality. Despite a variety of new metaphors 
and scientific developments, many of the traditional problems continue to be 
relevant. So, for example, whether psychological inquiry converges on a theory 
where minds are understood as symbol-manipulating machines, as statistically 
driven networks or as embodied-embedded systems, it still faces the 
philosophical problem of accounting for the role of representation in 
psychology. Whether one denies the reality of representation along behaviorist 
lines or rests one's account on some variant of cognitivism or its 
alternatives, the difficulty of explaining (or explaining away) the role of 
representation remains.</p> 
<p>Part Four reviews the principal problems which emerge from consideration of 
the relationship between psychology and its biological basis. The early days of 
computational functionalism encouraged philosophers to consider the choice of 
theories independently of the details of implementation. For philosophers of 
psychology the biological facts of cognition were more difficult to ignore. In 
recent decades, philosophy of psychology has moved away from a view which 
downplayed the significance of biological structures and constraints in the 
development of psychological theories.</p> 
<p>Techniques and insights from neuroscience have moved to the heart of 
psychological investigation. Philosophers have taken note of the import of the 
neurosciences. So, for example, modern theories concerning cognitive 
architecture and the nature of representation generally take a stand with 
respect to the relevance of constraints that result from the properties of the 
neural substrate.</p> 
<p>While neuroscience has loomed large in recent psychology, biology has 
figured in a range of other important ways in psychological inquiry. For 
decades, ontogenetic and evolutionary biological considerations have influenced 
psychological theorizing. These factors continue to shape discussions in 
philosophy of psychology. Thus, developmental and evolutionary considerations 
feature prominently in many of the chapters in this Companion. The 
contributions to Part Four reinforce the view that if one is seriously engaged 
with working psychology, it is no longer the case that one can safely ignore 
evidence from the biological sciences.</p> 
<p>While contemporary philosophy of psychology encompasses results from 
biology and the other sciences, purely philosophical considerations continue to 
figure centrally. As philosophers have shown, perceptual experience remains one 
of the most intractable problems for a theory of the mind. However, philosophy 
of psychology has access to resources which potentially hold the possibility of 
moving beyond the kind of impasses that plague unaided philosophy of mind. 
Unlike the metaphysically oriented literature of the 1990s, the strategy for 
addressing the problem of consciousness in philosophy of psychology involves 
direct engagement with empirical investigation into the nature of attention and 
perception. Philosophy of psychology supplements and constrains a purely 
metaphysical or phenomenological approach to the problem of consciousness. 
Rather than taking our intuitions as the sole data for a discussion of the 
nature of conscious experience, philosophers of psychology have a substantial 
inventory of scientific evidence to draw upon.</p> 
<p>A productive approach to consciousness involves breaking the problem into 
its components. Part Five surveys some of the ways that philosophers of 
psychology have pursued the divide-and-conquer approach to consciousness. 
Attention, introspection and the temporal components of experience are 
distinguished from the emotions. These, in turn are distinguished from 
perceptual experience in the sensory modalities and in dream states. By taking 
an incremental approach to the problem of consciousness, philosophers of 
psychology can attend more carefully to distinctions obscured by blanket terms 
like &quot;consciousness.&quot;</p> 
<p>Philosophical curiosity extends well beyond the confines of debates over 
the nature of cognition, representation and consciousness. The kinds of concern 
that continue to bring philosophers to the study of psychology, often involve 
problems concerning personhood, moral agency and the nature of the good life. 
As the field matures, philosophers of psychology are connecting in substantial 
ways to moral philosophy. The contributions to Part Six demonstrate the 
relevance of philosophy of psychology to vital normative questions. Here, these 
questions are tackled directly and without apology.</p> 
<p>The present volume reflects what we believe are some of the most fruitful 
lines of investigation in contemporary philosophy of psychology. Given the 
selection of topics and emphases, some words of justification may be in order. 
As we indicated above, this Companion is organized in a way which departs, to 
some extent, from more traditional accounts of philosophy of psychology. In the 
past, the field was thought to focus on four central notions: intentionality, 
rationality, nativism and modularity. While these topics are crucial and are 
covered in detail here, they do not exhaust the range of topics which now fall 
within the scope of the field. It is easy to understand why philosophers of 
mind emphasized these four topics. However, by including a selection of 
subjects which is more representative of the contemporary state of play, we are 
hoping that the broader philosophical community will be encouraged to recognize 
the rich diversity of contemporary philosophy of psychology. However, this 
volume is not intended solely for philosophers with an interest in matters of 
mind, but also for philosophically inclined psychologists. We hope that this 
volume provokes and stimulates psychologists and that they will find a great 
deal here that is directly relevant to their research.</p> 
<p>To understand what philosophy of psychology has become and where it is 
headed, it is useful, once again, to orient ourselves by reference to Block's 
classic anthology. That anthology was divided into a volume of classic papers 
in philosophy of mind, followed by a sampling of important papers in philosophy 
of psychology. Much of the most important work in philosophy of psychology had 
been oriented towards the concerns of traditional philosophy of mind. So, for 
example, in his introductory essay Block emphasizes what he sees as the central 
conceptual innovation: the Turing machine. From the perspective of the late 
1970s, the development of the digital computer held the promise of 
fundamentally reshaping our view of mental life. The prospect of a new approach 
to fundamental questions concerning rationality and intentionality drew many 
philosophers of mind to examine conceptual problems in psychology.</p> 
<p>Over the past three decades of philosophy of psychology, one of the most 
important developments has been the expansion in the range of themes and 
topics. Increasing interdisciplinarity in philosophy of psychology in the 
intervening years has meant that Block's characterization of the field as 
&quot;the study of conceptual issues in psychology&quot; is no longer 
satisfactory (p. 1). Today, the philosophy of psychology is more than simply 
the analysis of the concepts employed by psychologists. It has become a 
collaborative effort involving the contributions of psychology, linguistics, 
neuroscience, engineering and other disciplines. As this volume shows, the 
collaborative turn has not subordinated philosophical investigation to the 
natural sciences; philosophers have not become the &quot;underlabourers of the 
sciences&quot; in Locke's sense. Instead, while retaining a focus on the 
problems that bring us to philosophy of psychology in the first place, the 
collaborative turn has meant an increasing sensitivity to the actual results, 
methodologies and practices of scientific investigation. Our choice of topics 
in this Companion reflects this collaborative approach.</p>
