<h1>Defeating Disorganization in One Session</h1>  By Gordon Shippey | 17 
August 2011 <br>
<br>

<p>Here is the guidance I give my clients when they complain of confusion and 
disorganization in their lives.</p> 
<h1>Walking the Line: The Joy of Zigzag</h1>  By Libby Webber | 20 July 2011 
<br> <br>

<p>Watch some children out for a walk and you&rsquo;ll see a lot of meandering 
to and fro as they make fascinating discoveries on all sides. So why do adults 
seem to prefer to walk in straight lines instead? What do our kids know that 
we&rsquo;ve forgotten?</p> 
<h1>Techniques for Truth-Telling</h1>  By Gordon Shippey | 29 June 2011 <br>

<br> 
<p>In my work as a therapist, I find that lying &mdash; to oneself and to 
loved ones &mdash; is a major obstacle to change. For many, the advice 
&ldquo;just tell the truth&rdquo; misses the myriad causes of lying and the 
skill set necessary to tell the truth even when the stakes are high.</p> 
<h1>The Vision Thing: Seeing is Believing</h1>  By Libby Webber | 20 June 2011 
<br> <br>

<p>I started writing a few months ago about our five senses, and I&rsquo;m 
ending with the sense of sight; it may be last but it&rsquo;s very far from 
least. In fact, the sense of sight is so powerful and all-encompassing that it 
can actually detract from the subtle messages of our other senses. It permeates 
our language and has a particular hold on our imagination.</p> 
<h1>Meeting Valentino: A Cautionary Tale</h1>  By Libby Webber | 8 June 2011 
<br> <br>

<p>In therapy, we talk a lot about the importance of &lsquo;meeting the client 
where they are&rsquo;; in other words, seeing them for who they are and what 
they&rsquo;re dealing with at that time, rather than who or where we think they 
&lsquo;should&rsquo; be. Little did I know I&rsquo;d be using the same lesson 
in my relationship with the newest member of the family.</p> 
<h1>Devil on My Shoulder</h1>  By Gordon Shippey | 31 May 2011 <br>
<br>

<p>Remember those cartoons where a character is exhorted towards good by an 
angel on one shoulder while a tiny devil on the other shoulder tempts him or 
her towards evil? It turns out there are real motivational analogues to 
shoulder-angels and shoulder-devils, and knowing the difference between the two 
is not always so easy.</p> 
<h1>The Many Joys of Java</h1>  By Dr George Simon, PhD | 25 May 2011 <br>
<br>
<p>The scientific picture is still pretty murky with respect to whether and 
how much coffee is really good for you, but simply nothing that can help 
rectify a discombobulated mood like a fresh cup of Java.</p>
