<h1>5 Secrets for a Happy Retirement</h1>  By Dr George Simon, PhD | 31 August 
2011 <br>
<br>

<p>Available science and my own personal experience agree that there are five 
secrets to living a happy life in retirement. Here&rsquo;s my take on how to 
make the most of retirement with good health, good company, and more.</p> 
<h1>Everyday Chaos: The Butterfly Effect</h1>  By Libby Webber | 14 July 2011 
<br> <br>

<p>Life certainly isn&rsquo;t as predictable as we&rsquo;d sometimes like it 
to be. Sudden or unexpected changes of plan &mdash; even small ones &mdash; can 
have unforeseen knock-on effects.</p> 
<h1>The Trouble with Too Much</h1>  By Gordon Shippey | 12 July 2011 <br>
<br>

<p>For hundreds of thousands of years, human beings have become brilliant at 
dealing with scarcity. Suddenly we&rsquo;re confronted with the opposite 
problem: overabundance.</p> 
<h1>Psychopathy 101</h1>  By Dr George Simon, PhD | 6 July 2011 <br>
<br>

<p>True psychopaths are neither as common nor as easy to identify as the 
popular media would have you believe. But many do go unnoticed or are totally 
misperceived. Avoid victimization by those devoid of empathy, remorse, and 
conscience by understanding more about this personality type.</p> 
<h1>Working to the Rule of Law: It&rsquo;s Society&rsquo;s Problem</h1>  By 
Libby Webber |5 July 2011 <br>
<br>

<p>Philip Davies, a British Member of Parliament, caused a stir recently when 
he suggested that in order to improve their chances of finding a job, disabled 
people should be entitled to offer to work for less than the statutory minimum 
wage &mdash; theoretically making them more attractive as potential employees. 
An interesting idea or shockingly ill-advised?</p> 
<h1>Techniques for Truth-Telling</h1>  By Gordon Shippey | 29 June 2011 <br>

<br> 
<p>In my work as a therapist, I find that lying &mdash; to oneself and to 
loved ones &mdash; is a major obstacle to change. For many, the advice 
&ldquo;just tell the truth&rdquo; misses the myriad causes of lying and the 
skill set necessary to tell the truth even when the stakes are high.</p> 
<h1>When Knowledge Makes Family of Strangers</h1>  By Dr George Simon, PhD | 
22 June 2011 <br>
<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to fear, misunderstand, or dislike those people, places, 
and things about which you are truly ignorant. But sometimes getting know to 
them does more than take away the fear or the potential for misunderstanding; 
sometimes it turns strangers into family.</p> Page&nbsp;4&nbsp;of&nbsp;30
