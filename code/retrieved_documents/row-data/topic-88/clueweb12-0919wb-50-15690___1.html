<h2>Prizes</h2> 
<p>Each year the SPP awards three prizes at its annual meeting. 
Congratulations to the recent winners.</p> 
<p>The 2012 Stanton Award, for a young scholar in philosophy or psychology who 
has begun making significant contributions to interdisciplinary research and 
has been active in SPP, will go to Joshua Greene (Psychology, Harvard).</p> 
<p>The 2011 William James Prize, for the best contributed paper by a graduate 
student was awarded to Victor Kumar (Philosophy,  University of Arizona). And 
the 2011 prize for best poster went to Brian Edwards and Lance Rips 
(Psychology, Northwestern University).</p> 
<p>The Stanton award is presented in honor Harry and Betty Stanton of Bradford 
Books/The MIT Press. The executive committee selects the winner of the Stanton 
Prize. SPP members are invited to send nominations for the 2013 prize to the 
chair of the Stanton Prize committee atstantonprize@gmail.com.</p> 
<p>William James and Poster Prize winners are chosen by an ad hoc committee 
appointed by the president in consultation with the executive committee. The 
process for selecting Stanton Prize winners is described below.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Stanton Prize Procedures </p> 
<p><em>A 'prize coordinator' will be appointed by the executive committee, who 
may or may not be a member of the executive committee, and who will have 
primary responsibility for implementing the following procedures:<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>1) The prize coordinator will send out a call for nominations to the 
entire SPP membership by email, and further calls as they judge appropriate. 
The call for nominations will provide information about the prize and 
procedures for nomination, and will specify a closing date, which should be at 
least two weeks from the time of the first call for nominations. If, either at 
the time of closing or during the week prior to closing, it is felt that 
insufficient nominations have been received or that the nominations received to 
date are not of adequate quality, then the coordinator should seek the approval 
of the executive committee to send out a revised call with a later closing 
date. The revised closing date should be no later than one week after the 
sending out of the revised call.</em></p> 
<p><em>2) A nominations will consist of the following, to be sent by email to 
stantonprize@gmail.com no later than midnight EST on the closing date: 
&nbsp;(a) A brief statement of no more than 300 words describing: (i) the 
contributions of the candidate to interdisciplinary research in psychology and 
philosophy, or related disciplines (ii) the career stage of the candidate, and 
(iii) the candidates past participation in the SPP. This statement may be 
supplied by a nominator or by the candidate themselves. &nbsp;(b) The candidate 
should provide a full and current CV attached as a separate file (.doc or 
.pdf). &nbsp;(c) A single sentence sent by email from an SPP member in good 
standing stating that they nominate the candidate and giving their full name. 
(d) A separate email from the candidate which must (i) state that they wish to 
be considered a candidate for the prize, (ii) endorse the accuracy of the 
nominating statement, and (iii) provide a clear and unqualified commitment to 
attend that year's meeting and give a talk if they are awarded the prize.<br>

</em></p> 
<p><em>3) If a nomination is received that is incomplete or does not otherwise 
meet the guidelines specified in (2), then the prize coordinator may, at their 
discretion, either reject the nomination outright, or they may inform the 
nominator and the candidate of the situation and invite them to correct the 
problem by a given deadline.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>4) The prize coordinator will then send an email to the executive 
committee containing the names and statements of all properly nominated 
candidates, and offer to supply the full CVs of candidates on request, or 
supply a link to a website where they are posted. This should be done one week 
prior to the vote to allow time for discussion.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>5) The 'executive committee', each of whom have a right to vote for the 
prize, is understood to consist of: the regular members of the executive 
committee, the past president, the current president, the president elect and 
the treasurer.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>6) The prize coordinator will then send an email reminding the 
executive committee of the voting procedure and soliciting their votes. The 
committee members should be given at least two days to return their vote by 
email. The deadline for votes should be stated in the email, and may be 
extended by the voting coordinator at their discretion. The winner will be 
determined by a scoring system as follows: If the number of nominees is n then 
each member of the executive committee should produce an ordered list of 
candidates with a minimum length of one and a maximum length of (n-2). In other 
words, if there are just two or three nominees, then everyone would simply have 
a single vote. If there are four nominees then each member of the committee 
would list their preferred two candidates in order of preference. The first 
would receive 2 points, the second 1 point. If a member lists only one, then 
that person would receive 2 points. If there are five nominees, each committee 
member can provide an ordered list of up to three candidates, the first 
receiving 3 points, the second 2 points, the last 1 point. It should be clear 
how this would scale up.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>7) In the event of a draw, a second vote will be held in which only the 
top drawing candidates will be considered, and in which each voting member will 
have a single vote. If this procedure yields a second draw, the president will 
have the right to select a winner from amongst the candidates who drew in the 
second election.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>8) The prize coordinator will contact the nominated winner and have a 
conversation with them about their availability to attend the meeting to give a 
talk. The prize coordinator will then email a summary of the votes to the 
committee and provide them with a summary of this conversation. If any 
difficulties, logistic, expense related, or otherwise, have surfaced then the 
executive committee will have an opportunity to air their views on how best to 
proceed.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>9) If the nominated winner withdraws then it will usually be understood 
that the next highest scoring candidate will be considered the winner. However, 
any member of the committee and/or the prize coordinator may propose that 
second election be held, with or without a further round of nominations. This 
will proceed only if a majority of the executive committee assents. At any time 
during this process any member of the executive committee and/or the prize 
coordinator may call for a vote to withhold the prize for that year. If a 
majority of the executive committee assents, then the prize will be held over 
until the next year.</em></p>
