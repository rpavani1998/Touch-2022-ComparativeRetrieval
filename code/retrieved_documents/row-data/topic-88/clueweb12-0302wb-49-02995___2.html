<h1>Psychology and Philosophy</h1> 
<p> </p> <strong>What is Psychology and Philosophy?</strong> <br>
<br>

<p>Psychology includes subjects as diverse as social interaction, learning, 
child development, schizophrenia and information processing. Philosophy is 
concerned with a wide range of questions including ethics, knowledge and the 
nature of mind.<br>
</p> <strong>Psychology and Philosophy at Oxford</strong> 
<br> <br>

<p>Psychology at Oxford is essentially a scientific discipline, involving the 
rigorous formulation and testing of ideas. It works through experiments and 
systematic observation rather than introspection.&nbsp; The Oxford Experimental 
Psychology Department is widely regarded as one of the leading psychology 
departments in the UK. At present, there are particularly strong groups in the 
fields of human cognitive processes, neuroscience, vision, developmental and 
social psychology.</p> 
<p>The Oxford Philosophy Faculty is the largest philosophy department in the 
UK, and one of the largest in the world. Many faculty members have a worldwide 
reputation, and library and other facilities are acknowledged as among the best 
in the country.&nbsp; Philosophy at Oxford has active interests in the 
philosophy of mind and the philosophy of science, and has very close links with 
those working in neuroscience and psychology.</p> <strong>Careers</strong> <br>

<br> 
<p>Psychology and Philosophy students enter careers in fields including 
professional psychology, education, research, medicine, the health services, 
finance, commerce, industry, the media and information technology. Some careers 
will require further study and/or training after your degree. The degree is 
accredited as conferring eligibility for the Graduate Basis for Chartered 
Membership of the British Psychological Society, provided you study sufficient 
psychology and the minimum standard of a Second Class Honours is achieved. This 
is the first step towards becoming a Chartered Psychologist.</p> 
<p>Recent Psychology and Philosophy graduates include a trainee teacher and a 
clinical psychologist. Lily, who graduated in 2003, says: &lsquo;After an MA in 
Gallery Studies, I worked at the Jewish Museum. I then moved to the V&amp;A as 
an Assistant Curator. I am now the researcher on a major exhibition.&rsquo;</p>
