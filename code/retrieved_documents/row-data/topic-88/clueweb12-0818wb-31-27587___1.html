<p>Robert Pippin's goal in <i>Nietzsche, Psychology, and First Philosophy</i> 
is</p> 
<p>to present a comprehensive interpretation of what Nietzsche means by 
'psychology,' what the relationship is, as he understands it, between such a 
psychology and traditional philosophy, and why he thinks such a psychology is 
(indeed is, as he says, 'now') so important, why it is 'the path to the 
fundamental problems' (xi-xii).</p> 
<p>One might expect to find an account of this psychology in the first 
chapter, titled &quot;Psychology as the 'Queen of the Sciences.'&quot; Here 
Pippin characterizes Nietzsche's psychology as standing outside the tradition 
of philosophical psychology from Plato to Hume to Davidson, with philosophers 
defending positions on such issues as the roles of reason and passion in 
directing action:</p> 
<p>Nietzsche does not appear to want simply to add another position to this 
list. Indeed, his main point seems to be that there is no general<i>
philosophical</i> psychology. His view, which I will be exploring in these 
chapters, is that views of the soul and its capacities vary with beliefs about 
and commitments to norms; normative commitments are subject to radical 
historical change; and so what counts as soul or psyche or mind and thus 
psychology also changes. The &quot;soul&quot; is merely the name for a 
collective historical achievement, a mode of self-understanding, of one sort or 
another, what we have made ourselves into at one point or another in the 
service of some ideal or other. When we describe to one another what the soul 
is, we mean thereby to propose an ideal, usually something like psychic health. 
Hence also the deep interconnection or inseparability between psychology and 
genealogy (3).</p> 
<p>The view seems to be that psychological claims are in some way grounded in 
normative claims. Here we might ask Pippin how exactly normative commitments 
are connected to psychological claims, how historical changes play into this 
relationship, and how the resulting psychology will explain our thoughts, 
feelings, and actions. (If Pippin leaves us with a psychology that cannot 
accomplish this explanatory task, we might ask what makes it psychology at 
all.) Given satisfactory answers to these questions, we might ask for textual 
evidence that Nietzsche held such a view and for independent reasons to accept 
it.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, Pippin's scattered remarks developing this view do not add 
up to any clear picture of how the normative and the psychological are supposed 
to relate. He gives us little reason to think Nietzsche held a view along the 
lines described above or to think such a view is independently plausible. While 
the book's meandering from topic to topic leaves its argumentative structure 
unclear, it seems that Pippin wants to assemble a set of Nietzschean insights 
that cannot be accommodated within traditional philosophical psychology, 
motivating the idea that Nietzsche's psychological views must involve a radical 
departure from the tradition. But many of the things he points to as evidence 
fall within traditional philosophical psychology, and sometimes only a strained 
reading of the text has Nietzsche endorsing extraordinary psychological claims.
</p> 
<p>Pippin characterizes Nietzsche as following the French <i>moralists</i>: 
Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, and especially Montaigne. Nietzsche certainly was 
interested in these figures, but Pippin leaves it unclear how they take us 
beyond traditional philosophical psychology or suggest that we should ground 
psychological claims in normative claims. (La Rochefoucauld often reveals 
putatively moral behavior to be a banal activity tractable within even the most 
flatfooted psychological theories -- the pursuit of self-interest.) Pippin 
writes that Nietzsche's interest in these figures is in their &quot;'stance 
towards life,' an orientation such that things in a life matter or they 
don't&quot; (12). For example, Nietzsche is interested in how Montaigne 
maintained &quot;such a thoroughgoing skepticism and clarity about human 
frailty and failings without Pascal's despair and eventual surrender or La 
Rochefoucauld's icy contempt for the 'human all too human'&quot;, and how he 
became &quot;a thoughtful, ferociously honest, cheerful free spirit, someone 
who had succeeded at the task of 'making [himself] at home in the world'&quot; 
(10-11).</p> 
<p>This seems right. But why it forces us to reject traditional philosophical 
psychology is unclear. Why couldn't we build a philosophical psychology that 
would allow us to describe and understand the mental states involved in 
Montaigne's stance towards life? This question comes up repeatedly in Chapter 
2, when Pippin spends much time discussing the &quot;primordiality&quot; of 
psychology for Nietzsche. He defines this as the question of how we can project 
value onto things without actively deciding to do so (29). While this is 
certainly an issue that interests Nietzsche, it is an ordinary question for 
traditional moral psychology, addressed by philosophers from David Hume to 
Simon Blackburn, as well as recent empirical psychologists. The question of how 
it is that we can form &quot;depth commitments&quot; that bind us to important 
life projects, discussed at length by Pippin, is similarly tractable (27). The 
relation between psychology and the normative here merely concerns what 
psychological states are involved when we judge things to have value or commit 
ourselves. This is part of the subject matter of traditional moral psychology. 
Pippin seems to have conflated his thesis, that psychology is grounded in the 
normative judgments of a time, with the obvious fact that normative judgments 
(which change over time) are realized by particular psychological states.</p> 
<p>Pippin's third chapter, &quot;Modernity as a Psychological Problem,&quot; 
discusses the condition of society after the death of God. He characterizes the 
nihilism that Nietzsche is concerned with as a &quot;<i>failure of desire</i>, 
the flickering out of some erotic flame&quot; (54). Pippin is right to focus on 
the affective component of nihilism, which seems to be what concerns Nietzsche 
about it. Much of the rest of the chapter hints at the view of psychology that 
will be laid out in the subsequent chapters.</p> 
<p>Early on, Pippin identifies an interpretation he disagrees with: a 
naturalist position on which</p> 
<p>when trying to account for the human capacities required when persons 
direct their actions on the basis of norms, we should appeal to capacities also 
discovered in nonmoral or nonethical contexts, and those capacities must be 
consistent with our being organic material bodies located in space and time (3).
</p> 
<p>The major engagement with the naturalist comes in chapter 4, where Pippin 
discusses Nietzsche's famous image of the lightning and its flash:</p> 
<p>And just as the common people separate lightning from its flash, and take 
the latter to be a<i>deed</i>, something performed by a subject, which is 
called lightning, popular morality separates strength from the manifestation of 
strength, as though there were an indifferent substratum behind the strong 
person which had the<i>freedom</i> to manifest strength or not. But there is no 
'being' behind the deed, its effect and what becomes of it; 'the doer' is 
invented as an afterthought, -- the deed is everything. (Pippin 71-72, citing 
the Diethe translation of<i>Genealogy</i> I:13) </p> 
<p>Pippin rejects naturalistic readings of Nietzsche which view this passage 
merely as denying some variety of free will. These readings draw support from 
the mention of freedom in the quoted passage and the context as well as the 
discussion of how the weak use this view to hold the strong responsible for 
their actions. According to Pippin, &quot;Nietzsche does not seem interested in 
merely naturalizing all talk of motives, goals, intentions, and aversions; he 
denies that whole model of behavior, 'root and branch.'&quot; (74). Pippin 
argues that this passage from the<i>Genealogy</i> is incompatible with 
naturalism, because naturalistic pictures of the mind involve &quot;some 
determinate causal factor 'behind' and 'before' the deed&quot; (74). He solves 
this problem by making the doer &quot;not<i>separate</i>, distinctive from the 
activity itself; it is in the deed&quot; (75). He admits that 
&quot;philosophically, a great deal more needs to be said before this 
understanding of 'the doer<i>in</i> the deed' could be defended,&quot; (79) and 
lists several difficulties with it, for example &quot;If whatever it is that is 
expressed in such deeds is not a stable core or substantial self &hellip; what 
could form the basis of the temporal story that would link these manifestations 
and transformations?&quot; (84).</p> 
<p>It is unclear why naturalists (as Pippin defines their view) are barred 
from simply mimicking Pippin's move and conceiving of the doer-deed relation as 
a part-whole relation rather than a causal relation. They probably would not 
want to do this, just because it would leave them with all the difficulties 
Pippin's own view faces, but at any rate there is no special problem for 
naturalism here. The problem is for views that use mental states in causal 
explanations, which cross-cuts the naturalist/non-naturalist distinction. What 
Pippin really wants to do here is independent of the naturalism debate. He 
wants to use the strangeness of making doers part of deeds to fuel his general 
argument that Nietzsche rejects traditional philosophical psychology. To do 
this, he needs a much better argument against the free will interpretation 
discussed above, which will otherwise displace his own. Later in the section, 
Nietzsche talks about how the weak person &quot;<i>needs</i> the belief in a 
neutral 'subject' with free choice,&quot; suggesting that the rejection of 
&quot;the doer&quot; is only a rejection of a subject with free will. Even 
setting charity aside, fidelity to the text supports the free will reading far 
better than Pippin's interpretation that Nietzsche is rejecting the whole model 
of behavior that posits real motives, goals, intentions, and aversions.</p> 
<p>Pippin's arguments against naturalistic interpretations usually do not cite 
naturalistic interpreters. (I assume that he has Brian Leiter in mind, but 
Leiter is never mentioned.) This is a strange way to conduct an interpretive 
dispute. To criticize an interpretation one disagrees with, one should cite 
something incorrect an interpreter said and present textual evidence that 
demonstrates its falsity. Instead, Pippin fails to defeat the nameless 
naturalist he defines.</p> 
<p>After spending many pages of chapter 5 laying out a model of the mind that 
makes self-deception an interesting phenomenon, Pippin announces that 
&quot;Nietzsche is rejecting this whole model: the account of mindedness, 
self-knowledge, and action-explanation that it involves. Everything, that is, 
depends on the proper attention to the way he treats the subject-deed 
relation&quot; laid out previously (100). Instead,</p> 
<p>self-knowledge is not observational but interpretive and, let us say, 
always promissory, futural, as complexly interpretive as the interpretive 
question of just what it is that is being done; action-explanation is not 
causal, and motives cannot be understood as fixed, datable mental items. 
Rather, self-ascribing a motive is more like provisionally trying out an 
interpretation (101).</p> 
<p>This is probably the clearest and most direct statement of the 
psychological view that Pippin attributes to Nietzsche.</p> 
<p>Readers impressed by Nietzsche's psychological observations may be 
intrigued by an interpretation that presents psychology as &quot;first 
philosophy,&quot; and read Pippin's book for this reason. Perhaps they admire 
passages such as<i>Daybreak</i> 109, where reasoning about how to combat a 
vehement drive is revealed to be produced by an even stronger drive controlling 
the intellect. Such readers will be surprised at how Pippin's interpretation 
robs these explanations of their value by denying the fixed and real existence 
of the desires and drives which they involve. Nietzsche's psychological 
explanations -- or any others that we regard as the hard truth of the matter -- 
lose the advantage that correct psychological explanations have over fanciful 
self-explanations that smug people might use to feel good about themselves. 
Pippin seems to embrace this consequence of his view:</p> 
<p>On such a picture, it is not so paradoxical to suggest that the content of 
some avowal and the right act description are so pregnant with plausible 
possibilities that the prospect of self-serving or self-aggrandizing 
interpretations might not look so counterintuitive (101).</p> 
<p>The first philosophy of Pippin's interpretation is not psychology, but the 
impossibility of doing real psychology.</p> 
<p>The final chapter discusses freedom. According to Pippin, the only kinds of 
freedom Nietzsche cares about are &quot;self-overcoming&quot; (106) which he 
seems to sometimes call &quot;self-mastery&quot; (109). He rejects an 
interpretation on which self-mastery is achieved if one &quot;'gives style' to 
one's character&quot; (109). (This sounds like Alexander Nehamas' view, but 
Pippin does not cite him by name. Similarly, an actual psychological experiment 
he describes in chapter 5 (93-94) is not cited.) His clearest account of 
Nietzsche's view of freedom runs as follows:</p> 
<p>achieved freedom involves achieving a capacity both to sustain a 
wholehearted commitment to an ideal (an ideal that is worth sacrificing for, 
that provides the basis for a certain hierarchical unity among one's interests 
and passions) and what appears at first glance to be a capacity in some tension 
with such wholeheartedness -- a willingness to overcome or abandon such a 
commitment in altered circumstances or as a result of some development. 
(112-113)</p> Setting aside the issue of whether Nietzsche had this account of 
freedom, one wonders how Pippin can talk about a hierarchical unity among one's 
passions after objecting to the sort of psychology that explains things by 
positing real passions. (It is hard to see how the view from his third chapter 
that nihilism involves a failure of erotic attachments will avoid the same 
problem.) If Pippin had presented a detailed picture of how normative 
commitments during various historical periods genuinely license some 
psychological claims but not others, perhaps he would be able to give useful 
psychological explanations. But the only such picture that has been offered 
allows people to interpret themselves however they please, leaving his 
psychological stories no better or worse than anything else. So he backs off, 
saying &quot;<i>nothing</i>  really counts in some probative way as ' <i>the</i>
' establishment of mastery&quot; (118). Rejecting any general philosophical 
psychology can be fun, until you want to discuss how people think and feel, and 
then there is nothing useful you can say. <br>
