<h1>Texas Psychology Programs<br>
(found 94 schools)</h1> 
<h4>State Association: <strong>Texas Psychological Association</strong></h4> 
<h4>State Board: <strong>Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists 
</strong></h4> <br>
<br>

<p>Listed below are all of the accredited schools in Texas that offer 
Psychology degree programs.</p> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<p>Texas is the only state to enter the Union through treaty rather than 
annexation, and Texans are fiercely proud of their home. One of the things they 
like to boast about is the sheer size of Texas. It&rsquo;s second only to 
Alaska in land mass and has three of the nation&rsquo;s most populous cities, 
Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio. For psychologists and those wanting to study 
in the field, the state has a Texas-sized number of choices and options for 
both school and employment.</p> 
<h2>Psychology Education in Texas</h2> 
<p>Texas is a big state and it offers aspiring psychology students on all 
levels a huge number of choices. You can pick from over 95 schools and a wealth 
of programs from associate degrees to PhD and PsyD programs. Students at all 
levels are welcome to join the Texas Psychological Association. Scholarships 
are plentiful for psychology students, so you should check with your 
school&rsquo;s psychology department.</p> 
<h2>Outlook for Psychology in Texas</h2> 
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2010 data), the mean annual 
wage for practicing psychologists in Texas ranges from around $64,510 to 
$84,250. How much you can expect to earn as well as demand for services depends 
greatly on your specialization. In Texas, clinical, counseling, and school 
psychologists can expect to find the most work, but at lower pay than other 
specialists. The Texas Psychological Association offers a number of services to 
its members, including a psychologist-to-psychologist mentoring program.</p>

popular distance learning psychology programs - they accept students from
