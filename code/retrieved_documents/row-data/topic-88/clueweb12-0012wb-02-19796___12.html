<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 
<p>Psychology is a highly relevant discipline to theological and religious 
studies yet it is only given a minor role in most academic programmes and often 
it is not included at all. When psychology is a component of the theology 
curriculum, its content is typically psychoanalysis and pastoral psychology, 
both of which are associated with mental health and emotional problems in adult 
life. The Oxford course in the Psychology of Religion, offered to Theology 
(single honours) and Philosophy and Theology (joint honours) students, is 
distinct in that its content is broader, addressing religious development 
across life span and stressing the importance of empirical research and 
evidence in the study of human behaviour. The rationale of the course is to 
approach religion as a psychological rather than just cultural and social 
phenomenon, by providing an overview of the key religious topics (see below) in 
light of modern psychological methods and theories. In short, the aim of the 
course is to enable students to differentiate between psychology and the other 
disciplines of religious studies notably anthropology, sociology, history and 
philosophy of religion.</p> 
<p>The Psychology of Religion course consists of one term of lectures (eight) 
and one term of tutorials (eight) per student. The lectures cover topics such 
as origin of religious concepts in human development, different aspects of 
religious experience (e.g., prayer, conversion), moral development, and 
religious cognition across life span as well as psychology of religion applied 
to health and education. In connection with each topic, students receive 
guidance for further reading that includes modern empirical studies of 
different aspects of religious behaviour and experience, in addition to some of 
the classical titles from the history of psychology (James, Freud, Jung). In 
tutorials, students have a greater choice of topics which to research for their 
weekly essays on a specific question and subsequently discuss its content and 
style of argument. They attend tutorials either singly or in pairs and are free 
to schedule them at any point between their prelims and finals.</p> 
<p>Psychology of Religion is a popular option for theology students1 but it is 
not clear why, that is, what exactly motivates the students to select a paper 
that is outside their main discipline. For instance, is it a genuine interest 
in human religious nature, a pleasant diversion from their main discipline, or 
a strategic choice in order to broaden their educational skills and thereby 
secure better employability prospects? Furthermore, once they have chosen the 
paper, it is not clear whether the students perceive it as relevant to their 
study of theology and what its conceptual challenges are. Such queries are 
relevant especially in view of the empirically based content of the Oxford 
course.</p> 
<p>Students&rsquo; understanding of psychology as a science of human religious 
experience in the broadest sense is a question of interest for at least two 
reasons. First, the current science-religion debate leaves out psychology as a 
science of mental life and behaviour. Instead, the most commonly involved 
sciences are physical and biological, including neuroscience and 
neuro-physiology. Second, investigating students&rsquo; understanding of how 
modern psychology works may provide hints for helping students interpret and 
apply research findings obtained by psychological methods in a more informed 
and critical manner to their work in theology. Finally, finding out about 
students&rsquo; experiences with the current Psychology of Religion paper is 
relevant to any further integration between psychology and theology or 
religious studies. Given the popularity of psychology as such, on the one hand, 
and the potential relevance of scientific psychology to the science-religion 
debate, on the other, it is both desirable and likely that further links should 
be forged between psychology and theology at degree level.</p> 
<p>In short, the current project was designed to examine the impact of 
teaching a predominantly science-based psychological content to humanities 
students, most of whom have no prior familiarity either with psychology or with 
scientific approaches as part of their degree studies. By virtue of choosing 
Psychology of Religion as one of their papers, Theology students place 
themselves in an interdisciplinary context; consequently, their experiences of 
studying psychology of religion may have wider implications for 
interdisciplinary issues in higher education.3 As we shall see from the 
experiences conveyed by the students, the question of integration across 
different disciplines is highly pertinent from the viewpoint of both teachers 
and students who are engaged in interdisciplinary education (e.g., Gasper, 
2001; Klein, 1990; Squires et al., 1975). In order to interpret Theology2
students&rsquo; views of psychology correctly, they will be compared directly 
with a group of PPP4 students who likewise study on an interdisciplinary degree 
programme that includes philosophy.</p> 
<h2>2. Fieldwork</h2> 
<h3>2.1. Participants</h3> 
<p>Forty students from the University of Oxford (20 students from the Faculty 
of Theology and 20 students from the Department of Experimental Psychology) 
participated in the project. Among the Theology group, 10 students were male 
and 10 female. The majority of students were in their early 20s, with the 
exception of two mature students. At the time of interviewing, nine students 
were studying for the joint Final Honours School (FHS) in Philosophy &amp; 
Theology and 11 single FHS in Theology. Fourteen participants were finalists; 
four were in their second year, and two in their first year. Thirteen of the 
students had attended tutorials with me as their tutor (mostly singly), three 
students were tutored by a theologian with a background in psychology, three 
were due to take the paper the following term, and one student who had intended 
to take the paper had subsequently changed her mind. Only one of the 20 
Theology students had attended the core lectures one term prior to having 
tutorials, as I recommend. Nine students had attended at least several lectures 
one year after they had completed the tutorials, whilst six students did not 
attend any lectures but relied on their tutorials only. The information about 
students&rsquo; attendance at the core lectures in Psychology of Religion will 
become relevant when we look at the challenges that they encounter in studying 
psychology.</p> 
<p>Of the 20 PPP students, 12 were male and eight female, with a similar age 
distribution to that of their Theology counterparts, including one mature 
student. Nineteen were finalists and one student had just completed year two of 
her course. Seventeen students were studying psychology with philosophy and 
three with physiology..5 As for their familiarity with religion as an academic 
study, four PPP students were doing the Philosophy of Religion paper as one of 
their philosophy options (two of whom also did religious studies at A-level) 
and one studied religion as part of her first degree abroad.6</p> 
<p>Participants were recruited for the project via their college e-mail 
addresses, by receiving a brief message that explained the purpose of the 
project and appealed to their good will for taking part before leaving Oxford 
in return for a small financial reward.</p> 
<h3>2.2. Design</h3> 
<p>The questions asked in each interview can be grouped according to their 
potential to elicit students&rsquo; (a) reasons for choosing psychology and any 
prior familiarity with the subject, (b) perceptions of its relevance to 
theology, (c) conceptual challenges of empirical psychology for theology 
students, and (d) conceptions of psychology as a science and its usefulness in 
the study of religion as a human phenomenon. Whenever appropriate, Theology and 
PPP students&rsquo; responses will be compared directly. The main interest of 
such a comparison is that PPP students do not have the option of studying 
psychology of religion, however, based on their choices of Philosophy of 
Religion as a paper, a number of them seem to be interested in religion as a 
subject of study.</p> 
<h3>2.3. Method</h3> 
<p>Data pertaining to each issue above were obtained by interviewing each 
participant. Although a questionnaire would have been a more economical 
procedure to use, the limitations of questionnaire as a method were judged to 
be a major constraint on the aims of the project. More specifically, 
questionnaires may yield ambiguous responses, which, unless followed up with 
further questions, would have to be eliminated from data analysis.</p> 
<p>The interviews were conducted in a semi-structured format, that is, the 
same set of pre-planned questions was asked of all the participants albeit in a 
somewhat different sequence, deliberately allowing for flexibility and 
spontaneous flow in response to each question. The interviews were taped as 
well as recorded by pen and were subsequently fully transcribed. Each interview 
lasted approximately 60 minutes, as planned, and included some additional 
questions to those reported here. All the participants received a small fee for 
taking part in the project, which was paid from a grant awarded to me by the 
LTSN Subject Centre for Philosophical and Religious Studies Subject (PRS-LTSN) 
Mini-Project Fund.</p> 
<p>Because of the relatively small size of the samples, interview data were 
analysed mainly qualitatively according to the category of response, 
restricting numerical analysis to only a few summaries in terms of frequencies 
or percentages and presented in tables (see below). Data pertaining to each 
section of the project will be reported separately for Theology and PPP 
students, followed by direct comparisons where relevant.</p> 
<h2>3. Results</h2> 
<h3>3.1. Motives for studying psychology and prior familiarity with the subject
</h3> 
<p>Students&rsquo; responses to the question why they chose Psychology of 
Religion indicate that the majority of Theology students select the paper out 
of a general interest in people or in religious behaviour more specifically 
(Table 1). In addition, five students said that psychology was a good choice 
because its approach to religion was different from that found in their 
theological papers and as such brought &ldquo;a breath of fresh air&rdquo; to 
their overall study.</p> 
<p>Two students cited their scientific interests as a reason for including 
psychology in their degree programme whilst one elected to do psychology 
because it was going to be useful in his future pastoral work. Table 1: Motives

<p></p> 
<p>Surprisingly, only four PPP students said that they had a specific interest 
in psychology; nine stated that their main interest was actually philosophy 
(Other) but, because there was no possibility of studying single honours 
philosophy at Oxford, they chose psychology as a good combination with 
philosophy. Four PPP students were interested in psychology as a science 
subject whilst two chose it almost accidentally, having discovered psychology 
as a degree discipline at the point of applying. Similar to the Theology group, 
one PPP student chose psychology with a view to his future employment 
prospects. Listed below are some of the typical examples of each group&rsquo;s 
reasons for choosing psychology (Theology examples: 6, 14; PPP examples: 15, 
18).8</p> 
<blockquote> 6 I guess it was just for a bit of variety, really, and because 
quite a lot of papers in theology are historical and biblical studies which I 
didn&rsquo;t find that interesting&hellip; As an option paper I wanted 
something that was a bit more thoughtful and, perhaps, related to questions 
that I have myself. So, I guess, the psychology of religion was&hellip; sort of 
answered questions about religion and its place in other people&rsquo;s lives. 
It answers quite a lot of questions that I have in theology. Like why people 
are religious and that applies to the question why people believe in different 
religions.
<p>14 Because I wanted a change from the Biblical papers and, also, I wanted a 
more practical paper.</p> 
<p>15 PPP caught my attention because I thought it was really a great 
combination. I was very interested in doing philosophy, anyway&hellip;.</p> 
<p>18 I&rsquo;ve always been interested in science, especially biology, but 
also very interested in philosophy. The combination of biology and philosophy 
is obviously psychology.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The two groups are also similar with regard to their prior familiarity with 
psychology as a discipline. As Table 2 indicates, 12 Theology and 16 PPP 
students had no prior familiarity with the discipline of psychology (i.e., had 
not studied it before) whilst eight Theology and four PPP students have done 
some psychology before coming to Oxford. This includes A-level courses, a major 
in psychology completed abroad or, simply, having read some mainstream 
psychological texts.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>For the majority of students in both groups, Freud and Jung were the most 
representative names of the discipline before studying psychology at degree 
level. If we take into account that many Theology students also study 
philosophy as part of their degree, the difference between the two groups 
regarding their motives for studying psychology is even smaller.</p> 
<h3>3.2. Relevance of psychology to theology</h3> 
<p>Data reported in this section pertain to Theology students only.9 
Participants were asked for their views on (a) how the two disciplines fitted 
together, and (b) whether psychology was relevant to their study of theology. 
The two questions elicited consistent responses per student and can be reported 
jointly. The majority (17) saw the two disciplines as directly related and 
dealing with common questions and concerns albeit in a different way. Moreover, 
in the opinion of five (out of 17) students cited below, psychology and 
theology are in need of further and deeper integration.</p> 
<blockquote> 1 I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s where it belongs, but I think 
it&rsquo;s where it has to be at present, given the nature of Philosophy &amp; 
Theology. Where do you think it belongs?&mdash;Honestly, I think it belongs as 
a compulsory paper and it should be in there as well as the others. I find it 
absolutely essential, almost practical, and&hellip; a practical and scientific 
balance almost to the rest of my studies. I think that anyone who goes into the 
church should do Psychology of Religion paper. And I think it is brilliant for 
every theology student because it takes a very different look at what we are 
studying.
<p>2 There should be a course called PPT (Psychology, Philosophy &amp; 
Theology). It would be fantastic to have that kind of course. Psychology is 
about human behaviour and religious belief is a form of behaviour, so 
that&rsquo;s why they are related. But you need the philosophical component 
also.</p> 
<p>10 Psychology ought to make a big difference to theology but the present 
structures don&rsquo;t allow it. There are many people who think that theology 
is quite different and should not be mixed with the social sciences. John 
Millbank (author of Theology and Social Theory) is against looking at theology 
from other disciplines.</p> 
<p>11 I think it&rsquo;s an area that needs to be expanded. There isn&rsquo;t 
a great deal of overlap between psychology of religion and theology papers. 
There is more scope for overlap. Can you give me some 
examples?&mdash;Psychology of morality and the ethics of Bonhoeffer, it would 
be interesting to see what psychology has to say about that. It does seem that 
both psychology and theology are approaching the same thing but from different 
angles, and it&rsquo;s difficult to think of them as two separate entities but 
it&rsquo;s also difficult to give specific examples of how they can interact. I 
know that you can&rsquo;t apply psychology to two thousand years ago but the 
conversion topic derives from Christianity and the NT.</p> 
<p>12 I think they are both necessary. For example, if there is a definite 
trend for everyone to personify sacred things, then you need the psychological 
tests, the data, which just the scientific aspects of psychology can provide. 
And perhaps the theological school isn&rsquo;t as rigorous in collecting that 
data &hellip; if it does it at all.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In contrast to the views endorsing direct and meaningful links between 
psychology and theology, two students perceive them as independent and in no 
need of a closer dialogue, whilst one stated that psychology was fundamentally 
opposed to religion:</p> 
<blockquote> 9 I always put psychology more with sceptics &hellip; the people 
who want to prove something is not true or show that prayer isn&rsquo;t really 
talking to God. That always seems to be if you watch something on TV or read 
about psychologists &hellip; it&rsquo;s always a philosopher or a theologian 
(who) said that prayer is really talking to God but a psychologist came along 
and said, No, it&rsquo;s not that. I always see psychologists interfering were 
they really shouldn&rsquo;t be. With certain aspects of faith, like prayer, I 
almost think it&rsquo;s not an issue that can be tested. Because even if you do 
show that something happens to people when they pray or could be conditioned by 
society or something, it still means &hellip; . Religiously, it still means a 
lot to that person.</blockquote> 
<p>Overall, students&rsquo; responses to the relevance question ranged from 
highly relevant in specific ways (e.g., for pastors) to marginally and 
generally relevant, no more than any other discipline that educates one&rsquo;s 
thinking. Amidst clear views regarding the possible relationship between 
psychology and theology, there were sporadic instances of a confounded 
understanding concerning the role of each discipline in the study of religion. 
For example, psychological issues (e.g., differentiating religious belief and 
emotion) are sometimes seen as a subject of theological and philosophical 
enquiry rather than of empirical research, as the following two examples show.
</p> 
<blockquote> 6 I guess you don&rsquo;t really have any empirical evidence 
about religion but only about people. Religion is so subjective.
<p>4 I think with theology you quickly come to the conclusion that you 
can&rsquo;t reach God through reason, so it has to be faith, and that&rsquo;s 
quite interesting from a psychological point of view. You see that there is a 
connection with philosophy of religion but it&rsquo;s not made for you.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The simplest explanation of any such misconceptions among the Theology 
students is their non-attendance at the introductory lectures where 
methodological points are repeatedly addressed and the nature of empirical 
psychology highlighted as distinct from the non-empirical disciplines studying 
religion. It is a common trend among Theology students not to attend lectures 
on the grounds that they can cover the syllabus by reading. In other words, 
they transfer their attitude to lectures in the arts subjects to psychology, 
without realising that accessing information in psychology presupposes some 
familiarity with its research methods. A few of the typical explanations for 
not attending lectures are cited below.</p> 
<blockquote> 3 No &hellip; To be honest, I don&rsquo;t find that they are 
helpful. Lots of time they cover the stuff that you can read about. I prefer to 
hear about people&rsquo;s own work &hellip;
<p>No. That was mainly my fault. It&rsquo;s an awful excuse, but it&rsquo;s 
quite far away.</p> 
<p>13 I always put my non-lecture commitments first because &hellip; generally 
&hellip; I am happy in the library reading.</p> 
<p>By contrast, PPP students regard lectures as an important source of 
information and learning in psychology, as the following example illustrates.
</p> 
<p>15 Psychology lectures are essentially compulsory &hellip; absolutely 
necessary, but philosophy not at all.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>It is of interest to mention that PPP students were equally prone to hold 
confounded notions about the roles of psychology and theology, which became 
obvious at different points during the interviews. In the case of PPP students, 
however, the more likely explanation of their misconceptions is the lack of any 
educational input about religion.</p> 
<h3>3.3. Conceptual challenges of psychology for theology students</h3> 
<p>Three questions tapped the challenges of studying psychology as part of a 
theology curriculum. First, Theology students were asked to say what they found 
to be difficult in psychology. Next, and as an indirect way of approaching the 
same issue, they were also asked what, if anything, was easy in psychology. 
Finally, in order to determine whether their views of psychology have changed 
as a result of the course, i.e., whether and how the challenges were overcome, 
the students were asked what they thought of psychology now, after the course. 
These questions were put to the 16 Theology students who had completed the 
course.</p> 
<h3>3.3.1. Difficult aspects of studying psychology</h3> 
<p>Not surprisingly, the most common difficulties for Theology students 
consisted of the understanding of tables, statistics, technical terms, and the 
lack of background knowledge of science in general.</p> 
<blockquote> 2 I avoided them (tables); I read only the theory. 
<p>16 Trying to think from the viewpoint of a scientist &hellip; Data, 
evidence &hellip; Very different from the other papers &hellip; Lots of 
technical terms to get to grips &hellip;</p> 
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t so much difficult, it was new, and you&hellip; you sort of 
start from a different position so you have to kind of think before you start. 
You are just not used to things like methods and evidence and that kind of 
stuff. You don&rsquo;t really talk much about that in your normal theological 
papers. It&rsquo;s more ideas than facts and evidence. So it took a bit of 
getting used to.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>On the whole, Theology students do not find psychology to be conceptually 
difficult; rather, they appear to be frustrated by the lack of experience with 
research methods.</p> 
<blockquote> 2 The core paper has been beneficial to me in that it has given 
me an insight into how psychology tackles religion. But I have a gap on the 
research side.
<p>5 We should do some tiny research&hellip; (There is) not enough feel that 
it is a science, just reading about it. Would this not increase the amount of 
technical detail that theology students would have to learn?&mdash;But 
it&rsquo;s the same in theology. In order to study certain papers I have to 
learn Greek or Hebrew or Latin, if I want to do Patristics.</p> 
<p>12 There wasn&rsquo;t that much that was too hard &hellip; Conceptually, I 
think, it was a bit easier than something like Buddhism or the Nature of 
Religion, which were a couple of papers I did recently. But in terms of 
workload, it&rsquo;s roughly the same.</p> 
<p>15 I&rsquo;ve never done psychology &hellip; having to learn all the 
language &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s not like reading a book 
&hellip; but it&rsquo;s not abstract, it&rsquo;s very certain. I found that 
difficult. Also, no practical experience in psychology&hellip; How would that 
help?&mdash;Perhaps being involved in some research.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Reading articles from psychological journals was frequently mentioned as 
being comparatively difficult albeit, in many cases, an enjoyable challenge, as 
the example below suggests.</p> 
<blockquote> 13 At first, a daunting range &hellip; when I look at my first 
essay. But the best thing about psychology is the short chunk given to read, 
not a whole book like in theology. It&rsquo;s a really good way of getting a 
broad perspective in a short time.</blockquote> 
<p>An important source of frustration for a number of students has been the 
perceived lack of connection between psychology and theology when such 
connections appear obvious. The following two students make the point rather 
eloquently.</p> 
<blockquote> 1 Through the whole paper, most of the psychologists I read, they 
seem almost quite&hellip; pleasantly baffled about theology. I got the feeling 
that perhaps a module on theology for the psychologists would be helpful in 
their studies. Because there were some conclusions that were drawn and some 
discussions, which, I didn&rsquo;t feel, were quite subtle. Although they had 
valuable insights, their research was only ever scratching the surface of 
theology and I felt there was a lot more (?) but to do that, you need a better 
understanding of what theology is.
<p>10 (There is) no connection between psychology and theology; psychology 
never cites theology, a discipline of several centuries (standing). Theology 
also has explanations but psychology pays no attention. In psychology, it may 
not be accepted that one can study something that has no conclusion. Perhaps it 
was just my limited reading, but I often felt that theological terms were being 
taken for granted, but on second examination the terms were being taken in 
out-dated ways.</p> </blockquote> 
<h3>3.3.2. Easy aspects of studying psychology</h3> 
<p>What Theology students find easy about studying psychology are the 
relatively compact readings (journal articles), a focused approach, its 
familiar subject matter (people), Freud and Jung literature and, for two 
students, its methodological clarity.</p> 
<blockquote> 1 I found that the reading was more focused and condensed than in 
theology&hellip; Like once having to read a 4-page article! That never happens 
in theology, never less than 20-30 pages. I felt I made a lot of progress 
through my reading&hellip; And, in some ways, it was also quite easy because I 
chose to do it; it was my option out of interest. So, in that respect, there 
was always something about it which was more enjoyable than the others, the 
compulsory papers.
<p>6 I guess the fact that it is studying people so you can always relate to 
something. The subject matter is not alien, basically.</p> 
<p>10 Freud and Jung, the language is familiar. Cognitive psychology is also 
easy; it&rsquo;s about using models. Theology also uses models.</p> 
<p>5 That&rsquo;s a difficult question. I really enjoy science and wanted 
initially to study science but then became very interested in philosophy. So, 
when I enjoy something, it&rsquo;s easy. The choice of topics within psychology 
made it even easier.</p> 
<p>13 Oh, it&rsquo;s a very interesting contrast to the rest. It gave me a 
chance to find out about the scientific approaches&hellip; wonderfully, much 
more rigorous, a real breath of fresh air.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Whilst PPP students were not asked this question in the same context, they 
repeatedly conveyed that psychology was conceptually a great deal easier for 
them than philosophy.</p> 
<h3>3.3.3. Perceptions of psychology after studying it</h3> 
<p>As an additional way of finding out about the challenging aspects of 
psychology for Theology students, they were asked what they thought of the 
subject after the course as opposed to before starting it. Students&rsquo; 
changing conceptions of a subject indicate whether or not learning and 
understanding has taken place (e.g., Biggs, 1999; Ramsden, 1992). One of the 
main course aims appears to have been achieved, namely, all the interviewed 
students did become aware of the empirical character of psychology and its 
different way of thinking about certain familiar phenomena (examples 1, 4, 16). 
Another significant change in the understanding of psychology among the 
majority of students is the perception of it as distinct from psychoanalysis 
(examples 10, 12). As pointed out earlier, the majority of both Theology and 
PPP students anticipate studying Freud and psychoanalysis, as part of their 
course and, Theology students in particular, are little prepared what to expect 
in the paper.</p> 
<blockquote> 1 The biggest thing I found was the research and the studies. Not 
just asking what these statistics tell us but can we trust these statistics. 
There is so much that I found quite surprising, its scope&hellip; religious 
experience, prayer, conversion, mysticism&hellip; It studied a lot more and a 
lot more widely than I thought it would and, as a Christian, I don&rsquo;t want 
to believe in something that is all in my head, as it were. I accepted that 
psychological explanations are very different. Coming from a charismatic 
background and to find, for example, that worship services are one of (?) 
triggers, enabled me to understand the possible influence of music on the 
brain&hellip; I mean to understand the effect of religious stimuli; it gave me 
a better ground to ask whether what I experience was the effect of God or just 
me.
<p>4 I think it shows you a different approach. And it reminds you that there 
is a different, more scientific way of looking at things than one does in 
philosophy and theology.</p> 
<p>16 Much more scientific than I had expected.</p> 
<p>10 I would avoid PA, which is too laden with assumptions&hellip; Freud and 
Jung are kind of theologies in their own right. Big gain for me is to see how 
people think using models, as in cognitive psychology. People interpret the 
world by using a mental schema and how religion can be thought about&hellip;. 
Social psychology is very reductionist. It gives you lots of statistics and 
figures and no meaningful interpretation.</p> 
<p>12 I was surprised at how empirical it was. I thought it would be less 
so&hellip; when you are combining the two topics, psychology and theology, so 
that surprised me. And, also, I was kind of expecting more of 
psychoanalysis&hellip; I was expecting that to play a large part of the course. 
Is it a disappointment that it didn&rsquo;t?&mdash;Not really&hellip; We did 
two topics&hellip; two major essays on it&hellip; In fact, now I am surprised 
that it did take up such a large part of the course (laughs).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Although the material presented so far sufficiently indicates that Theology 
students do perceive psychology as a science, the next stage of the report 
looks at this question more specifically by comparing directly the views of 
Theology and PPP students.</p> 
<h3>3.4. Scientific psychology and religion</h3> 
<p>This part of the project was designed to investigate students&rsquo; 
conceptions of psychology as a science, on the one hand, and the applicability 
of psychological research methods to the study of religion, on the other. The 
comparison between Theology and PPP students is appropriate for the following 
reasons. First, whilst the two groups have a similar level of prior familiarity 
with psychology as a discipline, they differ markedly with regard to their 
prior background in science in general. To illustrate, Theology students do not 
typically take science subjects at A-level (although a few in the current 
sample have done), whereas PPP students typically take at least two, but 
usually more, sciences. Secondly, the pattern of prior familiarity with 
religion as a discipline among the students within each of the two groups is 
almost a reverse of that for science. For example, the majority of Theology 
students have studied religion at A-level whilst significantly fewer PPP 
students took A-level religious studies. Finally, Theology students have all 
chosen Psychology of Religion as one of their optional papers whereas none of 
the PPP students has studied psychology of religion either formally or 
informally. Accordingly, the question of interest in this comparison is whether 
the two groups arrive at a different conception of psychology as a science and 
to what extent they think that religion as a human phenomenon can be studied by 
scientific psychology.</p> 
<h3>3.4.1. Psychology as a science</h3> 
<p>Theology students. Of the 19 respondents11, eight seem to view psychology 
as sufficiently scientific on account of its methodological rigour (examples 1, 
7, 11, 12) whilst the remaining 11 are aware of its constraints as a science 
(example 6). Three of those 11 had attended seminars in philosophical 
psychology and concluded that psychology was still closer to philosophy than to 
science (example 5).</p> 
<blockquote> 1 I would say that psychology is a science. And I&rsquo;d say 
that, especially in contrast with philosophy and theology, partly because it 
has so much interest in the situations in the world&hellip; it takes its 
evidence from how people behave and what they do&hellip; And there is a lot of 
discussion about proper methodology and whether the criteria for reaching a 
conclusion are valid. And the studies&hellip; studies are a big thing. Because 
in philosophy and theology you get a bit of armchair psychology&hellip; 
that&rsquo;s as far as it goes, whereas psychology is much more concerned about 
how people actually (?) and also the consequences of the changes on them. I 
think those are the hallmarks of a science.
<p>7 I suppose, if you take a science to be an approach, or a kind of 
methodological way of looking at things, may be to that extent &hellip;. Yeah, 
it is &hellip; Empirical data.</p> 
<p>11 Well &hellip; Scientific to me in terms of the methods that are 
undertaken; otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t present its results in a table or give 
you a statistic that psychology would. It&rsquo;s a different approach because 
it&rsquo;s using experiments, whereas theology isn&rsquo;t. Psychology is 
purely scientific.</p> 
<p>12 I think it&rsquo;s totally science.</p> 
<p>6 It is, if you look at its methods, backed up by evidence. (But) 
Limitations are that you are always&hellip; you always rely on people&rsquo;s 
testimony. It all depends how honest the individual can be.</p> 
<p>5 It depends on who teaches psychology... how close they are to philosophy.
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>PPP students. Of the 19 respondents, all have agreed that the Oxford course 
is either very scientific or quite scientific but that in many other 
universities psychology can be rather different because it would often include 
Freud and psychoanalysis (examples 1, 5, 20). Most of the students also agree 
that certain areas of psychology are at present more scientific than others but 
progress continues to be made and all areas of psychology should eventually 
become fully scientific (example 12). Interestingly, PPP students seem to 
differ in their judgement whether psychology can ever become a hard science, 
even when it uses well-designed research methods (example 19).</p> 
<blockquote> 1 In this university, very, in the sense that it is 
experimentally orientated. It has a solid methodological background, not Freud 
and Jung&hellip; It is disproving or supporting various theories with 
experimental evidence&hellip; Also, the biological aspects, and those are 
scientific. In other psychology courses&hellip; in other universities, they 
focus on the less experimental aspects such as Freud or Jung or folk theories.
<p>5 Oh, definitely. The main thing about sciences is the approach to drawing 
conclusions, and the psychological approach is experimental and in that it is 
experimental, it is scientific. I suppose other people say that with psychology 
you have to make too many inferences and the (?) too complicated to understand 
with experiments but, I think, you can use those exact same arguments on 
something like the structure of the universe, which is a science as well.</p> 
<p>20 The approach here in Oxford is very scientific. It is very 
methodological, it is very data oriented&hellip; I feel that my education 
beforehand was like a philosophical approach, there was much more theory, not 
so much about scientific experiments.</p> 
<p>12 It can be very scientific; that&rsquo;s a good thing. I don&rsquo;t 
think (that) anything is beyond the reach of being studied scientifically, 
absolutely, but some things are very difficult to get at, at the moment, but 
will eventually&hellip; Like very abstract things are quite hard to analyse. 
But it will change in the future, by and by.</p> 
<p>19 Yes, but not a hard-core science, which I consider physics and chemistry 
to be. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not hard, just that it&rsquo;s not 
so&hellip;(?).</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So, the conceptions of psychology as a science do not seem to be vastly 
different between PPP students and those studying Theology but who have 
completed the core paper in Psychology of Religion. Whilst there is a wide 
range of views within each group, PPP students tend to use stricter criteria 
when judging the scientific status of psychology than their Theology 
counterparts, which is even more clearly stated in their responses to the next 
question.</p> 
<h3>3.4.2. Religion as a topic for scientific psychology</h3> 
<p>Theology students. Whether or not religion can be studied by scientific 
methods, depends not only on the students&rsquo; conceptions of psychology as a 
science but also on their implicit definitions of religion. Exploratory rather 
than systematic questions about the latter revealed that many students adopt a 
definition of religion that reflects the diversity of views in the literature.
</p> 
<p>Nine students answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when asked if religion could be 
studied by psychology (example 2), one answered &ldquo;No&rdquo; (example 4), 
whilst the remaining ten said that psychological methods could be applied to 
religion &ldquo;up to a point&rdquo; (examples 8, 9, 14, 19, 20).12</p> 
<blockquote> 2 I think that psychology helps to enlighten the implications of 
religious belief. It definitely can. Philosophy can&rsquo;t answer religious 
questions.
<p>I think religion does fall apart under science and reason but I think 
that&rsquo;s&hellip;a lot of Christians probably accept that you cannot reach 
that conclusion through reason and scientifically but you have to&hellip;</p> 
<p>8 Up to a point&hellip; there are certain things that, I think, science 
can&rsquo;t ever prove or show, and are just matters of faith. It&rsquo;s the 
same in philosophy: you can reason up to a point and eventually&hellip; I think 
it&rsquo;s Kant, isn&rsquo;t it, who made a difference between faith and 
reason; there is a gulf between them and you have to choose what to go for.</p> 
<p>9 I think religion can, because religion is man-made. I don&rsquo;t think 
that faith can. People try to do experiments to see if&hellip; experiments like 
Buddhist monks going into meditation if their brain waves change. I don&rsquo;t 
think that&rsquo;s faith. I think faith is a belief in something that even if 
all the doctrines are taken away, and there is no Bible and no place to 
worship, there would still be a belief that there is something higher than 
you.... that after death you don&rsquo;t just die and rot away. It is given to 
you by God rather than by someone telling you to believe.</p> 
<p>14 The more human aspects of it can, but religion is also of a very 
particular type, and as such, science cannot throw much light on it. And, also, 
religion is a very personal thing and as such stands outside science. I think 
that religious belief is different from most other emotions and understandings 
of the human mind. They kind of correlate with something that is beyond 
studying&hellip;</p> 
<p>19 Certain aspects of it can&hellip; the more historical or sociological, 
but if you are talking about God, by definition it&rsquo;s impossible. In order 
to study things scientifically, we must observe them. But when we are talking 
about God, God is up there and we are down here, and there is no reason that, 
because we talk to Him today and He talks to us or answers us, why that will 
happen tomorrow. Like with human relationships but even more difficult. 
It&rsquo;s not repeated to order&hellip; you cannot study it scientifically.</p>
<p>20 I think up to a point, yes. I think it can be studied scientifically, 
objectively, in that you can make observations&hellip; you can look at patterns 
of behaviour, look at history, but I think it is very difficult to quantify 
people&rsquo;s behaviour, and I think that&rsquo;s the problem with psychology 
and sociology as well and why they think what they think. You might find clues 
so you can see some things that may have led them to think of behaviour in a 
certain way but you just can&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s inside a person&rsquo;s 
head.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The last category of response (&ldquo;up to a point&rdquo;) is of interest 
because it demonstrates both the subtleties of understanding among the students 
(e.g., genuine methodological concerns) and, also, their misconceptions about 
the nature of the psychological approach. Among the misconceptions is the 
notion that psychology may be in a position to say something about God; that 
personal aspects of religion are beyond the reach of psychology; and that 
psychology can tackle only the historical and sociological aspects of religion. 
Such responses undoubtedly reflect confusion between psychological and 
theological aspects of religion.</p> 
<p>PPP students. The question whether religion can be studied by scientific 
psychology yielded extremely interesting, and often extensive, responses among 
PPP students. All twenty students agreed at some point in the interview that 
religion could and should be studied by psychology, however, the majority of 
them thought that psychology of religion was a branch of social psychology and 
that only the social aspects of religious behaviour and experience could be 
studied by psychological methods (examples 1, 7). Only upon being shown the 
topics included in the Psychology of Religion syllabus, did PPP students admit 
that religion had cognitive aspects also. But they were still of the view that 
philosophy was the best framework within which to study mental representations 
(thoughts), including religious, whereas psychology was concerned with 
biological bases of behaviour. Several were manifestly aware of the possible 
links between the brain and certain religious experiences (example 17), 
including a student who suggested that it would be interesting for psychology 
to study the &ldquo;God-spots&rdquo; in the brain. Not surprisingly, religion 
was also seen as an aspect of Psychological Disorders.</p> 
<p>Although the PPP students&rsquo; understanding of psychology as capable of 
studying religious thought is disappointingly limited, a number of them readily 
saw that psychological methods were entirely appropriate in the study of 
religion as an aspect of human thought (examples 3, 12, 19).</p> 
<blockquote> 1 There are aspects of religion which can be studied 
scientifically&hellip; cultural aspects, or seeing how religion develops within 
the individual but there is something that cannot be studied empirically, that 
is beyond the rational domain.
<p>7 You can study the experiences that religion invokes and try to reduce 
that to a physiological level, for example, brainwaves. But for how religion 
changes behaviour, I think that a sociological approach is far more fitting.</p>
<p>17 It seems as plausible to think that it would be possible to approach it 
empirically, but I wonder whether we are in a position to do so yet, given that 
we have absolutely no idea about how reasoning or complex representations, 
beliefs, are represented in the brain. We just don&rsquo;t know how that stuff 
works. So&hellip; we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to form interesting models, I 
wouldn&rsquo;t have thought.</p> 
<p>3 I think it could be; it would provide a nice twang with philosophy of 
religion. Religion suffers because people don&rsquo;t give it enough thought. 
It would be fascinating to understand the psychology of it. It&rsquo;s really 
interesting. I&rsquo;d love to read some papers on it.</p> 
<p>12 Moral development without religion has been studied, so why not with 
religion&hellip; religion is a major part of great many people&rsquo;s lives.
</p> 
<p>19 Definitely&hellip; why people believe, and how people can believe so 
much to devote their whole lives to religion. I think that that is extremely 
relevant.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>What is paradoxical about PPP students&rsquo; conception of scientific 
psychology is that it appears to be fundamentally unaware of the ongoing 
science-religion debate, where different sciences grapple to understand a 
number of, essentially psychological, questions (e.g., origin and the nature of 
religious mental states).</p> 
<h2>4. Discussion</h2> 
<p>The investigation reported here deals with a topic that involves a 
relatively small group of Theology students (20); nevertheless, its findings 
are of interest to all degree programmes involving theology or religious 
studies that include some teaching of psychology. The findings of this 
investigation are equally relevant to psychology degree programmes, although 
those implications will be considered in a separate report.</p> 
<p>Contrary to the general trend of teaching the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; 
psychology of religion topics in theology departments, namely, psychoanalysis, 
pastoral, and social psychology, the data obtained in the current project 
provide clear evidence that theology students perceive scientific psychology as 
both relevant to their studies and interesting. From the viewpoint of the 
perceived relevance of psychology to theology, it is understandable that many 
students would like to see a greater component of psychology as part of their 
theology degree and would prefer a more integrated interdisciplinary input from 
the two disciplines. Integration does not only mean establishing the links 
between two disciplines but also understanding what the unbridgeable 
differences are (Gasper, 2001). In this regard, teaching of scientific 
psychology to theology students makes a greater interdisciplinary contribution 
to their education than the more literary psychological approaches.</p> 
<p>There are two reasons why mainly scientific psychology rather than just 
psychoanalysis and pastoral psychology should be taught in introductory courses 
for theology students. First, psychoanalysis, pastoral and health psychology 
generally are applied areas and, to be useful, they require a prior grasp of 
psychological research method and theory in order to appreciate realistically 
their findings. Secondly, the science-religion debate would be broadened by 
increasing students&rsquo; awareness of psychology as a science of mental life. 
Put simply, psychology could be seen as the most relevant of the sciences to 
theology students.</p> 
<p>Although Theology students appear to have a more correct understanding than 
their PPP counterparts regarding the contribution that psychology can make to 
the study of religion, both groups of students often confound religion as a 
psychological topic with religion as a theological topic. Put differently, the 
comparison with PPP students shows that misconceptions about religion as a 
psychological variable are not limited to humanities students. Consequently, 
opportunities should be provided for psychology students to acquire a basic 
understanding of religion as a human phenomenon in order to broaden their 
research interests. The fact that seven out of 32 PPP students (22%) choose the 
Philosophy of Religion paper suggests an interest in religion, contrary to the 
stereotypes about an incompatibility between scientific and religious interests.
</p> 
<p>The main benefit of teaching psychology of religion to psychology students 
would be filling a gap in their understanding of the history of psychology. It 
could be argued that, as far as their understanding of religion goes, PPP 
students&rsquo; conception of psychology is closer to that of Wundt, who 
defined of psychology as a study of sensory processes, than of William James, 
who saw psychology as the science of mental life. In other words, James had a 
clear vision of psychology of religion as a branch of natural science and a 
methodologically demanding subject.</p> 
<p>The main practical problem in teaching mainstream psychology to theology 
students would be the lack of psychology staff with sufficient interests in 
theology so as to make relevant links between the two disciplines. This 
problem, however, is not insurmountable. Introducing the option of some 
theological education to psychology courses would soon rectify the deficit. 
Furthermore, even the teaching of general introductory psychology, rather than 
psychology of religion, could be useful to theology students as it might 
stimulate their own insights and creative links between the two disciplines.</p>
<p>In summary, although psychology is perceived as a very different paper from 
their theological papers, most students do not find it conceptually difficult 
and would prefer to study it in greater depth as part of their theology degree.
