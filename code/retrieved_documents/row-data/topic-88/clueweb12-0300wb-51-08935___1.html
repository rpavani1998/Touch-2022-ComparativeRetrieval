<h3>Reviews</h3> 
<p>'This work should serve as the standard reference for those interested in 
gaining a reliable overview of the burgeoning field of philosophical 
psychology. Summing Up: Essential.'<em> &ndash; Choice</em></p> 
<p>&lsquo;If someone were to ask me to select a book to be placed in a 
cornerstone or time capsule to be opened 100 years hence, this book would be on 
my short list, for it will offer the intellectual historian working in 2110 a 
clear view of how the mind of our time is understood.&rsquo; &ndash;<em>- 
Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books</em></p> 
<p>'The essays here, by outstanding scholars in philosophy of psychology, are 
exemplary for their theoretical sophistication, informative explanations of 
empirical work, and balanced overviews of relevant research areas. Nobody 
interested in philosophy of psychology will want to be without this excellent 
volume.' &ndash;<em> David Rosenthal, City University, New York, USA</em></p> 
<p><em>'</em>This collection provides an exceptionally wide-ranging review of 
recent advances and theoretical disputes in psychology, and closely related 
issues in evolutionary biology and neuroscience. It reflects philosophical 
sophistication, scientific expertise, and historical sensitivity.&rsquo;<em>
&ndash; Margaret Boden, University of Sussex, UK</em></p> 
<p>&lsquo;This is a highly useful and timely collection of essays by 
philosophers who consider advances in cognitive neuroscience and their 
relevance for the philosophy of mind. This is a compendium that will help 
connect the two cultures and I enthusiastically endorse this volume to both 
communities.&rsquo; &ndash;<em> Howard Eichenbaum, Boston University, USA</em>
</p> 
<p>&lsquo;An excellent collection of new essays, many by major contributors to 
the literature. No library or individual interested in current work in the 
philosophy of psychology should wish to be without it.&rsquo; &ndash;<em> 
George Graham, Georgia State University, USA</em></p>
