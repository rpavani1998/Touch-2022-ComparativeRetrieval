<i> Staff </i> </p>
<p> <b> 106. Ethics and Public Policy (3) </b> <br>
 This class will look 
carefully at two theories of morality and at the political theories they 
inform. The aim will be to see what sorts of public standards of conduct can be 
legislated defensibly in a truly fair state. Rather than assuming that public 
policy is responsive to concerns in the moral domain, the course will examine 
the ways in which morality should, ideally, shape public policy issues with 
particular attention to the demands of justice with regard to equality and 
liberty. Satisfies the ethics core requirement. Fall and Spring.<br>
<i> Staff 
</i> </p>
<p> <b> 141. Biomedical Ethics (3) </b> <br>
 In this course ethical theory is 
critically examined and applied to moral problems in health care, occasionally 
through the medium of case studies. Moral problems in contemporary medical 
practice and public policy such as informed consent, euthanasia, 
confidentiality, the allocation of scarce resources, and paternalism are 
analyzed and discussed. Much of the course is organized around the principles 
of autonomy, justice, nonmaleficence, and beneficence. Satisfies the ethics 
core requirement. Fall and Spring.<br>
<i> Staff </i> </p>
<p> <b> 149. Ethics of Non-Violence (3) </b> </p>
<p> <i> Professor Lance </i> </p>
<p> <b> 165. Four Ethical Traditions (3) </b> <br>
 An examination of theories 
of moral obligation which attempt to set out, in a systematic way, what we 
should and should not do, studying Plato, Aristotle, Mill, Hume, Hobbes, and 
contemporary authors representing these traditions. Satisfies the ethics core 
requirement. Fall.<br>
<i> Professor Kuhn </i> </p>
<p> <b> 202. Introduction to Logic (3) </b> <br>
 A general study of 
arguments, and of their conditions of soundness, covering inductive and 
deductive logic, traditional Aristotelian and modern symbolic logic.<i> This 
course satisfies the major's requirement in logic.</i> Spring. <br>
<i>
Professor Davis</i> </p>
<p> <b> 203. Early Greek Thought (3) </b> <br>
 An examination of the 
development of Greek values from Homer to Socrates. This development is marked 
by an early phase during which the poetic tradition tries to go beyond popular 
religion and seeks to ground justice upon a refined view of the divine. This 
view culminates with Herodotus and Sophocles. The next stage is characterized 
by the deep skepticism best represented in the work of Thucydides and the 
sophists. We finally study Socrates as the philosopher who attempts to find a 
new foundation for moral values. (Not offered 1996-97.)<br>
<i> Professor 
Gomez-Lobo</i> </p>
<p> <b> 204. Philosophy of History (3) </b> <br>
 A consideration of the main 
themes in a critical philosophy of history: explanation, objectivity, 
causality, and truth in history. Also a treatment of representative speculative 
philosophies of history, notably that of Hegel. (Not offered 1996-97.)<br>
<i> 
Professor McTighe</i> </p>
<p> <b> 219. Greek Ethics (3) </b> <br>
 A study of Greek ethical thought at 
the turn of the fourth century B.C. The central topics are the nature of power, 
the ethics of self-interest, the claims of justice, and the search for the good.

(Not offered 1996-97.)<br>
<i> Professor Gomez-Lobo </i> </p>
<p> <b> 229. Aristotle's Social Science (3) </b> <br>
 This course will focus 
on close reading of Aristotle's two major works of social science, the<i> 
Nichomachean Ethics</i> and the <i> Politics</i> . Among the major topics to be 
discussed are: the form of Aristotle's social science and its relation to more 
contemporary models, the relation between political philosophy and moral 
philosophy and the usefulness of the Aristotelian framework for engaging moral 
and political questions within a democratic culture. Permission needed from 
instructor.<i> This course satisfies the major's requirement in ancient 
philosophy.</i> Fall. <br>
<i> Professor Mara </i> </p>
<p> <b> 230. Human Rights (3) </b> <br>
 This course will present some of the 
major philosophical and theological ways of understanding the scope and 
significance of human rights, focusing particularly on the liberal, Marxist, 
and Catholic traditions. (Not offered 1996-97.)<br>
<i> Professor Langan </i> 
</p>
<p> <b> 235. The Family (3) </b> <br>
 An examination of the family from 
various perspectives. The first part will be an exercise in philosophical 
anthropology making use of the psychoanalytic approach to the family. The 
second will study Hegel's understanding of the family as a commitment as 
opposed to Kant's view which relies on the concept of contract. The third part 
will address some public policy questions, in particular some implications for 
policies treating mental illness. The final part will turn to the contributions 
that a theological perspective on sexuality and marriage can introduce.<br>
<i> 
Professor Ver Eecke</i> </p>
<p> <b> 236. Catholic Social Thought (3) </b> <br>
 The course will provide an 
overview of the Catholic social tradition in areas such as war and peace, 
economics, health care, capital punishment, and other issues of social justice. 
The Course will involve not only a development and debate about the theoretical 
framework of this tradition, but it will also examine practical applications of 
the tradition of social thought. To facilitate the practical applications there 
will be guest lecturers, as part of the course, who are involved in direct 
social service and action. Spring.<br>
<i> Professors Lance and Wildes </i> </p>
<p> <b> 240. The Consequences of Pragmatism (3) </b> <br>
 William James wrote 
that pragmatism is an attitude or orientation: &quot;The attitude of looking 
away from first things, principles, 'categories,' supposed necessities; and of 
looking towards last things, fruits, consequences, facts.&quot; In this course 
we shall evaluate pragmatism by looking at its consequences, by examining how 
it applies to the fields of law (Legal Realism), education (Progressive), 
politics (Participatory Democracy). In so doing, we shall study John Dewey, 
William James, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and other pragmatists, as 
well as critics of the application of the pragmatic method to American life and 
thought, such as Walter Lippman. (Not offered 1996-97.)<br>
<i> Professor 
Blattner</i> </p>
<p> <b> 245. Philosophy of Law (3) </b> <br>
 This course consists of 
philosophical reflection on issues that arise when one considers that most 
pervasive of social institutions, the law. Topics to be considered may include: 
the nature of law, legal interpretation, the obligation to obey the law, 
constitutional rights, due process, legal responsibility, and punishment. 
Readings will be drawn both from relatively abstract scholarly work on 
jurisprudence and from relatively concrete judicial opinions. Spring.<br>
<i> 
Professor Murphy</i> </p>
<p> <b> 250. Biomedical Ethics (3) </b> <br>
 The course is designed to 
introduce students to the discipline of bioethics. The course will examine the 
different approaches to bioethical thought (e.g. theories, principles, cases, 
virtues). The philosophical issues will be examined by looking at the different 
areas of moral controversy in bioethics (e.g. research ethics, euthanasia, 
termination of the treatment, abortion, AIDS, the allocation of health care 
resources). (Not offered 1996-97.)<br>
<i> Professor Wildes </i> </p>
<p> <b> 253. Philosophical Foundations of Psychology and Cognitive Science (3) 
</b> <br>
 This course examines the metaphysical foundations of Psychology with 
special attention to various reductionistic strategies and to resulting 
problems of explanation. Principal topics include nomological-deductive 
explanation, &quot;hermeneutical&quot; alternatives, the rise and (apparent) 
fall of Behaviorism and the emergence of cognitive science. Such enduring 
issues as the mind/body problem, personal identity, and (dread) 
&quot;Cartesianism&quot; are examined as these bear upon the assets and 
liabilities of &quot;Folk&quot; psychology. Prerequisites: Psychology 001 and 
Philosophy 001. (This course can be taken for credit in Philosophy or 
Psychology). Spring.<br>
<i> Professor Robinson </i> </p>
<p> <b> 254. Aristotle (3) </b> <br>
 A study of Aristotle's philosophy, 
explaining basic concepts, methods, and issues.<i> This course satisfies the 
major's requirement in ancient philosophy</i> . (Not offered 1996-97.) <br>
<i> 
Professors Richardson or Sherman</i> </p>
<p> <b> 260. Philosophy of Religion (3) </b> <br>
 Speaking about contemporary 
English language philosophers,<i> Time </i> Magazine grandly proclaimed that <i>
 &quot;God is making a comeback!&quot;</i> Whether or not God needs or can make 
a &quot;comeback,&quot; there has been, to be sure, an important resurgence of 
philosophical interest and attention to the main issues in the philosophy of 
religion. The course lectures will attempt to introduce the student to this 
contemporary discussion. We will look at such perennial puzzles as (1) the 
relationship between faith and reason; (2) the epistemic value of religious 
experience; (3) classical proofs for God's existence; (4) the meaning and 
function of &quot;religious language;&quot; (5) the problem of evil as a 
disproof for the existence of God; (6) miracles; (7) the significance of 
religious pluralism. Fall.<br>
<i> Professor Bradley </i> </p>
<p> <b> 264. Gnosticism and the Modern Imagination (3) </b> <br>
 A 
theoretical consideration of the relation of literature to philosophy and how 
the two disciplines can profitably be studied together, focusing on the 
frequently advanced hypothesis that the modern imagination is shot through with 
gnosticism. (Not offered 1996-97.)<br>
<i> Professors McTighe and Fort </i> </p>
<p> <b> 268. The Politics of Equality (3) </b> <br>
 This course explores the 
liberal commitment to equality, examining different (and often conflicting) 
accounts of how this commitment is best realized through social institutions 
and political arrangements, particularly given our differences of gender, race, 
culture, vulnerability, and need. Readings will be drawn from moral and 
political theory, legal theory, and feminist theory. Spring.<br>
<i> Professor 
Carse</i> </p>
<p> <b> 276. Dante and the Christian Imagination(3) </b> The goal of this 
course is to consider the explicitly Christian and uniquely contemporary 
intellectual relevance of Dante's<i> La Divina Comedia</i> in the context of 
the question of human freedom and the role of the imagination in the relation 
of the human to the divine. Fall.<br>
<i> Professor Ambrosio </i> </p>
<p> <b> 285. Medieval Thinkers, Modern Problems (3) </b> The years between 
about 1100 and 1350 were a period of intensive intellectual activity in the 
Western world. Many of the issues tackled by medieval thinkers, especially 
those of a moral or social and political nature, remain with us today. In this 
course we shall discuss medieval approaches to a number of such modern 
problems, including many of the following: abortion, capital punishment, the 
relations between law and morality and between religion and government, and 
ethical issues involved in business. Among the medieval authors to be read (in 
English translation) are: St. Thomas Aquinas, William of Ockham, and John Duns 
Scotus.<i> This course satisfies the major's requirement in medieval philosophy.

<p> <b> 307. The Construction of Woman (3) </b> <br>
 Starting from a 
theoretical examination of the concepts of gender and oppression, we will 
explore the ways in which social practices and representations of women impact 
our lived experiences. Through social contexts such as advertising, popular 
media, and pornography, we will identify ways that our culture constructs our 
understanding of gender and, more specifically, femininity. In so doing, we 
will see how these constructions limit the development of self-identify and 
self-esteem. We will critically examine the effects these practices have on 
women as individuals and as a group, and consider some alternatives for a 
positive response. Fall and Spring.<br>
<i> Professor Deichman </i> </p>
<p> <b> 309. Human Agency (3) </b> <br>
 In this course, we will investigate 
human freedom, what it is, how we have it, and how having it makes us agents. 
We will take a look at traditional &quot;internalist&quot; accounts of human 
freedom (like Kant's), which explain free agency as given by natural human 
features such as rationality. We will also examined &quot;externalist&quot; 
critiques (like Foucault's) which suggest that people are made free by being 
treated that way, that agency is, in an important sense, socially constructed. 
Finally, we will examine the way in which externalist accounts can allow us to 
reconceptualize current world problems, such as discrimination and the 
difficult transition to democracy in Russia, as problems of agency. Fall and 
Spring.<br>

philosophical texts. One or a small handful of texts will be the focus of 
discussion. Students will write a significant number of short, analytical 
papers.<i> Enrollment is restricted to philosophy majors and minors. One of 
these seminars is required of all philosophy majors, and must be completed by 
the end of the junior year.</i> Texts vary from semester to semester, and a 
student may take more than one text seminar. Fall and Spring.<br>

 These courses are small, 
intensive seminars that aim to teach students how to write an extended piece of 
philosophy. Topical seminars require students to write a lengthy final paper 
(25+ pp.) as well as (typically) a first draft and considerable revision. Each 
seminar will focus on a set topic, but students will develop their own research 
project within the scope of that topic.<i> Enrollment is restricted to

<p> <b> 348. Person in the Catholic Tradition (3) </b> <br>
 An examination of 
Catholic thought about what it means to be human. We shall trace some strands 
of this, and consider them in the light of contemporary experience.<br>
<i> 
Professor Wildes</i> </p>
<p> <b> 351. American Pragmatism (3) </b> <br>
 An examination of the 
epistemological, ethical, and political thought of American pragmatists, both 
in the movement's &quot;classical&quot; phase, represented by Peirce, James, 
and Dewey, and in its contemporary embodiment, in the persons (probably) of 
Rorty, Putnam, Nelson (a feminist pragmatist), and perhaps others. Special 
attention will be paid to three basic themes of pragmatism: &quot;the pragmatic 
maxim,&quot; which holds that the meaning of a belief is spelled out by its 
practical implications; epistemological, moral, and political consequentialism, 
which asserts that consequences are more important than principles and premises 
in assessing the truth of beliefs; and holism, which claims that all of a 
person's (or maybe even a society's) beliefs and actions have their meaning and 
must be assessed as a single unit. Along the way we will ask whether pragmatism 
is inherently relativistic, and whether it is a viable philosophy (by 
confronting some examples of the best criticisms of pragmatism). Spring.<br>

 Professor Blattner</i> </p>
<p> <b> 354. Plato (3) </b> <br>
 A study of some of the central themes of 
Plato's philosophy, involving a close reading of texts. Precise themes and

between the individual and the state, the theory of ideas, and the nature of 
knowledge.<i> This course satisfies the major's requirement in ancient 
philosophy.</i> Fall. <br>
<i> Professor Gomez-Lobo </i> </p>
<p> <b> 355. Philosophy and Anti-Philosophy (3) </b> <br>

<i> Professor Kuhn </i> </p>
<p> <b> 373. Moral Pluralism and Politican Consensus (3) </b> <br>
 Most 
philosophers since the Enlightenment have assumed that the task of moral 
philosophy is to define an impartial point of view from which universal 
agreement on moral questions is possible. Although those influenced by Hume, 
Kant, and the utilitarians have pursued the aim of universal agreement in 
vastly different ways, critics argue that no version of the Enlightenment 
philosophical project can yield conclusions which command rational agreement on 
deeply controversial moral issues. Many philosophers, of course, defend the 
ideals of the Enlightenment against post-modernist and other critics. Other 
philosophers reply that, even though a plurality of deeply conflicting moral 
views may be inevitable, there is hope for a more limited form of impartiality 
through which political consensus can be achieved. Their claim is that 
reasonable persons have sufficient grounds for setting aside controversial 
aspects of their comprehensive moral views for the sake of political consensus. 
However, some critics also reject arguments made on behalf of a purely 
political conception of impartiality. In this course, we examine arguments for 
and against the prospects for an impartial basis for resolving moral 
disagreement, as well as arguments for an against an impartial framework for 
achieving political consensus in a pluralist society. Spring.<br>

<p> <b> 383. Descartes (3) </b> <br>
 This course will be a close examination 
of Descartes' metaphysics. The focus will be on three themes: the theory of 
simple natures, the theory of the creation of eternal truths, and Descartes' 
doctrine of ideas (especially the role of the objective being of ideas). These 
themes provide the background for a consideration of Descartes'<i> cogito</i>

<p> <b> 396. Plato/Aristotle: Political Philosophy (3) </b> <br>
 A seminar 
examining the political philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, who believed the 
task of the political philosopher was to determine which of all the conflicting 
beliefs about what is morally good or bad is true, and in the light of the 
truth so determined, to propound the right order for the polis or city-state. 
The seminar will involve a close exegesis of the texts in order to discern what 
is the contemporary relevance of the philosophical issues therein. We will 
concentrate on the question that dominated classical political philosophy, the 
question of the best political order and how to initiate it.<i> This course

<p> <b> 397. Plato's Dialogues: Myth, Drama, Philosophy (3 ) </b> <br>
 A 
course covering a representative sample of Plato's major dialogues from each 
period in the development of his thought. The course will attempt to situate 
the development of Plato's thought against the broader horizon of the evolution 
of the Greek cultural imagination as a whole, emphasizing the rootedness of his 
philosophical thought in the Greek mytho-poetic tradition. The thesis will be 
argued that Greek philosophy sprang from the same roots as the myths, epics, 
tragedies and speculation regarding the cosmos, and that not only Plato's 
thought but the philosophical tradition as a whole is best understood as one of 
the creative voices with which the human imagination speaks in its manifold 
dialogue concerning the meaning of human existence in the world.<i> This course
