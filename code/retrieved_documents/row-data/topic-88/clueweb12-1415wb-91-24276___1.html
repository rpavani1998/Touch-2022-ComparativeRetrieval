 Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology 
(PNP)&nbsp; 
<p><strong>What is Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP)?</strong></p> 
<p>Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology (PNP) is a unique interdisciplinary 
program dedicated to the conviction that answers to the deep questions about 
minds and their nature depend on the adoption of a variety of perspectives.</p> 
<p>In addition to philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, PNP draws upon a 
number of allied disciplines that contribute to our understanding of the mind. 
These include biology, linguistics, education, and cultural anthropology. Each 
of the disciplines investigates facets of the mind using distinctive modes of 
inquiry. Neuroscience investigates mental &lsquo;hardware&rsquo; by 
scrutinizing the brain; psychology is concerned with the 
&lsquo;software&rsquo;; linguistics affords insights into the mind by exploring 
language, one of its most complex products; cultural anthropology approaches 
the mind by looking at the workings of society; and philosophy provides 
conceptual tools needed for understanding the nature of the mind and its 
standing in the physical world.</p> 
<p>The PNP major is ideal for students hoping to develop an understanding of 
relationships among the approaches used by these disciplines, and an 
appreciation of how they can provide converging perspectives on the mind.</p> 
<p><strong>The Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology Major</strong></p> 
<p>The PNP major is available both as a stand-alone major and as a second 
major. Majors elect to pursue one of two tracks:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>  The Cognitive Neuroscience (CN) track integrates the study of higher 
brain functioning with behavioral research directed at understanding activities 
such as perceiving, attending, remembering, and acting.</li> 
<li>The Language, Cognition, and Culture (LCC) track addresses the importance 
of language in human cognition, and the integration of cognition with the 
broader cultural milieu.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Why study Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology?</strong></p> 
<p>PNP students begin with a rigorous grounding in philosophy and psychology, 
then develop a multi-faceted perspective on the mind by merging the 
contributions of other disciplines. In the CN track, PNP majors learn how 
biological and behavioral research are consolidated in neuroscience. In the LCC 
track, students draw on courses in anthropology, education, English, 
linguistics, philosophy, and psychology.</p> 
<p>PNP students have the advantage of gaining a multi-faceted perspective on 
their area of interest before pursuing more specialized study after graduation. 
PNP can help prepare students for many professional and academic fields 
including medicine, psychology, cognitive science, biology, linguistics, 
philosophy, and education. PNP students develop their skills as critical 
thinkers and problem solvers in mastering the art of expressing their ideas 
clearly and defending them cogently. Majors are encouraged to incorporate 
empirical research projects into their program of study, and most do.</p> 
<p><strong>Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology Faculty</strong></p> 
<p>PNP students have the opportunity to study with distinguished faculty in 
the allied disciplines. Research interests of PNP faculty include</p> 
<ul> 
<li>the psychology and neurobiology of false memories</li> 
<li>cognitive and language deficits in schizophrenia</li> 
<li>neuroimaging studies of vision, attention, language, and memory</li> 
<li>concepts and conceptual representation</li> 
<li>philosophy of neuroscience, cognitive science, and science in general</li> 
<li>African American language and education</li> 
<li>consciousness and the nature of the self</li> 
<li>the relation between thought and language</li> 
<li>the neurobiology of motor control</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Special Opportunities Related to PNP at Washington University
</strong></p> 
<p>Washington University affords an ideal setting for the kind of 
interdisciplinary research that is a hallmark of PNP. Special opportunities 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Mind-Brain-Behavior Program, a two-year sequence open to a limited 
number of incoming students, regardless of major. The centerpiece of the first 
year is a team-taught course focusing on topics in psychology, neuroscience and 
philosophy. In the sophomore year, students conduct a significant research 
project.</li> 
<li>PNP supports a popular study abroad program at the University of Edinburgh 
in Scotland.</li> 
<li>PNP majors are invited to join faculty, graduate students and postdocs at 
a monthly lecture series that convenes on the Medical School campus.</li> 
<li>PNP majors can pursue honors in PNP during their senior year. 
Opportunities for senior honors research are available throughout the 
University. PNP advisors can help students identify appropriate research 
mentors.</li> </ul>
