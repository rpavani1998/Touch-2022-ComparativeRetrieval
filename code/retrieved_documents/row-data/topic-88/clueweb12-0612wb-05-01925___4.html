<p><strong>Why IHM Seminary philosophy?</strong><br>
 The Immaculate Heart of 
Mary (IHM) Seminary Philosophy major recognizes that some students majoring in 
philosophy do so intending to pursue the study of theology at the graduate 
level. This major is specifically designed to prepare the student for the 
requirements of such study.</p>

<p><br>
The following courses are required for graduation</p>  + More <br>

<p>(From the 2011-13 Catalog)</p> 
<p>A. &nbsp;All of the following:</p> 
<p>PH102&nbsp;-&nbsp;Logic (3 credits)</p> 
<p>This course presents an introduction to contemporary symbolic logic as well 
as to traditional deductive and inductive logic.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>PH253&nbsp;-&nbsp;History of Ancient Philosophy: Thales-Aristotle (4 
credits)</p> 
<p>This course, the first of four sequential courses in the history of 
philosophy, is a survey of Greek philosophy from its origins in the thought of 
Presocratic poets and philosophers to its later development in the dialogues of 
Plato and writings of Aristotle. Through the close reading of primary sources 
in their historical context and through a wide variety of other exercises, 
students gain an appreciation for the major texts, themes and problems that 
have shaped the Western philosophical tradition. Students also begin to develop 
a facility with the various tools and terms with which philosophers in the 
Western tradition have worked.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>PH254&nbsp;-&nbsp;History of Medieval Philosophy: Augustine-Ockham (4 
credits)</p> 
<p>In this course, the second of four history of philosophy courses, students 
study the development of philosophy in the Middle Ages through its contact with 
Christianity. The goals of this course are to examine the following themes and 
philosophical problems: the relation of faith and reason, spirituality and 
philosophy; human knowledge and human freedom; and philosophy as a principle of 
integration within Medieval culture.</p> 
<p>Prerequisite: PH253.</p> 
<p>PH300&nbsp;-&nbsp;Moral Theory (3 credits)</p> 
<p>The course begins with a thorough examination of the foundations of natural 
law ethics and consequentialist ethics. The instructor links those theories of 
morality with explicit assumptions regarding human nature. Central texts in the 
course are Saint Thomas Aquinas&rsquo; Prima Secundae and John Stewart 
Mill&rsquo;s Utilitarianism.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>PH345&nbsp;-&nbsp;Philosophy of the Person (3 credits)</p> 
<p>This course critically examines some of the most influential conceptions of 
the human person (e.g., the Platonic, the Aristotelian-Thomistic, the 
Judeo-Christian, the Hobbesian and that of other modern thinkers). It considers 
such fundamental issues as the existence and nature of the human soul; whether 
human beings are innately good, innately evil, both or neither; in what sense, 
if any, human beings are rational; and the nature and basis of human freedom.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>PH355&nbsp;-&nbsp;History of Modern Philosophy: Bacon-Kant (4 credits)</p> 
<p>In this course, the third of four history of philosophy courses students 
study the major philosophical movements of the early modern period beginning 
with the rise of inductive natural science. Students then examine rationalism, 
empiricism and conclude with Kant&rsquo;s critical philosophy. The central 
epistemological theme of the course reflects the modern conviction that before 
other sciences may be studied with profit, the possibility and modes of human 
knowledge must be determined.</p> 
<p>Prerequisites: PH253 and PH254.</p> 
<p>PH358&nbsp;-&nbsp;History of 19th and 20th Century Philosophy: 
Hegel-Wittgenstein (4 credits)</p> 
<p>This course, the fourth of four history of philosophy courses, is an 
examination of the post-Kantian philosophy focusing on selected major movements 
of the 19th and 20th centuries, such as idealism, phenomenology, 
existentialism, and British analytic and ordinary language philosophy. Readings 
may include Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, James, Foucault, 
Wittgenstein, Ryle, and John Paul II, among others.</p> 
<p>Prerequisite: PH355.</p> 
<p>PH360&nbsp;-&nbsp;Epistemology (3 credits)</p> 
<p>Epistemology is the study of how it is that humans come to know themselves 
and the world we inhabit. This course is a survey of theories of knowledge that 
span the western tradition from the Greeks to the present day. Issues raised 
include the definitions of certainty and truth, the reliability of sense 
knowledge, the way in which we know ourselves and others, as well as other 
related issues raised by our authors.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>PH400&nbsp;-&nbsp;Metaphysics (3 credits)</p> 
<p>This course examines critically the classic and contemporary concepts of 
being-in-the-world, its causes, its effects, and its modalities and relations.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>PH402&nbsp;-&nbsp;Senior Thesis (3 credits)</p> 
<p>This course is taken in the second semester of the Senior year and is an 
opportunity to work closely with a faculty member in the philosophy department 
on a written thesis.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>PH410&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas (3 credits)</p> 
<p>Saint Thomas Aquinas is one of the central figures in the history of 
Western philosophy. This course is designed to provide the student the 
opportunity to discover, reflect upon and react critically to Aquinas&rsquo;s 
life, thought and writings. The themes covered include an investigation of what 
we can know of God by the use of human reason, the role of human beings and 
their nature in the order of creation, the manner in which human action, in 
cooperation with grace, can bring humans to their final end, as well as other 
issues of metaphysics, psychology and methodology. While this course is 
designed as an in-depth study of Aquinas, it also serves as a preparation for 
the future study of Aquinas&rsquo;s theology; accordingly, there is a decided 
focus on developing a Thomistic vocabulary.</p> 
<p>This course is designed to be taken in the spring semester of the senior 
year.</p>
