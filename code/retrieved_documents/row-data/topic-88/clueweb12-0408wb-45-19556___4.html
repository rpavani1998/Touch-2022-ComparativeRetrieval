will be subject to the availability of Law tutors and will normally take place 
in either Hilary or Trinity Term.</p> 
<p>198. <em>Special Subjects</em> </p> 
<p>From time to time special subjects may be approved by the Faculty of 
Philosophy by regulations published in the<em>University Gazette</em> and 
communicated to college tutors by the end of the fifth week of Trinity Term two 
years before examination. Candidates may not be permitted to offer certain 
special subjects in combination with certain other subjects, or may be 
permitted to do so only on condition that in the papers on the other subjects 
they will not be permitted to answer certain questions. No candidate may offer 
more than one special subject. Subject to these qualifications, any candidate 
may offer any special subject.</p> 
<p>199. <em>Thesis</em>:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> 1. <em>Subject</em> The subject of every thesis should fall within the 
scope of philosophy. The subject may but need not overlap any subject on which 
the candidate offers papers. Candidates are warned that they should avoid 
repetition in papers of material used in their theses and that substantial 
repetition may be penalised. Every candidate shall submit for approval by the 
Director of Undergraduate Studies of the Faculty of Philosophy, c/o the 
Undergraduate Studies Administrator at 10 Merton Street, Oxford, OX1 4JJ, the 
title he or she proposes, together with (<em>a</em>) an explanation of the 
subject in about 100 words; and (<em>b</em>) a letter of approval from his or 
her tutor, not earlier than the first day of the Trinity Full Term of the year 
before that in which he or she is to be examined and not later than Friday of 
the fourth week of the Michaelmas Full Term preceding his or her examination. 
(The date before which a proposal cannot be submitted is different in certain 
circumstances in the case of the Honour School of Philosophy and Modern 
Languages. See the regulations below for that honour school.) The Director of 
Undergraduate Studies of the Faculty of Philosophy shall decide as soon as 
possible whether or not to approve the title and shall advise the candidate 
immediately. No decision shall be deferred beyond the end of the fifth week of 
Michaelmas Full Term. If a candidate wishes to change the title, subject or 
focus of his or her thesis after his or her thesis proposal has already been 
approved by the body responsible: he or she should write to the Director of 
Undergraduate Studies of the Faculty of Philosophy, c/o the Undergraduate 
Studies Administrator, to seek approval. The Undergraduate Studies 
Administrator will inform the candidate whether the change to the thesis has 
been approved, and communicate any change, where approved, to the appropriate 
chair of examiners. </li> 
<li> 2. <em>Authorship and origin</em> Every thesis shall be the candidate's 
own work. A candidate's tutor may, however, discuss with the candidate the 
field of study, the sources available, and the method of presentation; the 
tutor may also read and comment on drafts. The amount of assistance the tutor 
may give is equivalent to the teaching of a normal paper. Every candidate shall 
sign a certificate to the effect that the thesis is his or her own work and the 
tutor shall countersign the certificate confirming, to the best of his or her 
knowledge and belief, that this is so. This certificate shall be placed in a 
sealed envelope bearing the candidate's examination number presented together 
with the thesis. No thesis shall be accepted which has already been submitted 
for a degree of this or any other university, and the certificate shall also 
state that the thesis has not been so submitted. No thesis shall, however, be 
ineligible because it has been or is being submitted for any prize of this 
university. </li> 
<li> 3. <em>Length and format</em> No thesis shall exceed 15,000 words, the 
limit to include all notes and appendices but not including the bibliography; 
no person or body shall have authority to permit any excess, except that in 
Literae Humaniores, in a thesis consisting in commentary on a text, quotation 
from the text will not be counted towards the word limit. The word count should 
be indicated at the front of the thesis. There shall be a select bibliography 
or a list of sources. All theses must be typed in double spacing on one side of 
quarto or A4 paper with any notes and references at the foot of each page.<em>
Two</em> copies of the thesis shall be submitted to the examiners. </li> 
<li> 4. <em>Submission of thesis</em> Every candidate shall submit the thesis, 
identified by the candidate's examination number only, not later than noon on 
Friday of the week before the Trinity Full Term of the examination to the 
Examination Schools, Oxford, addressed to the Chairman of the Examiners in the 
candidate's honour school. </li> </ol>
