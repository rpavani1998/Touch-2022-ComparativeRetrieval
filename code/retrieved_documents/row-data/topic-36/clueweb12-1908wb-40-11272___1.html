<h2>This article was originally published in print on December 3, 2003</h2> 
<h2>&quot;Eclipse represents the worst of Java&quot;</h2> 
<p>Lately, there's been a lot of guff spouted about how Sun isn't joining 
Eclipse. While I understand the bitterness aimed at Sun somewhat, I think that 
this particular brand of talk is counterproductive and, dare I say it,<em>wrong
</em>. The talk tends to center around the concept of NetBeans and Eclipse 
using common technology, and I think this is misguided, and here's why.</p> 
<p>I really dislike Netbeans. I think it blows goats from here to Sussex, and 
considering that I live in the middle of the US, that's a<strong>lot</strong> 
of goats. Given the choice between NetBeans and... Notepad, I usually spend a 
minute pondering whether I can keep remembering to check extensions on 
filenames before realizing that I can, and I end up with sucky ol' Notepad 
instead of bothering with NetBeans.</p> 
<p>That said... I use Eclipse fairly often. I have a client who's standardized 
on WSAD, and I<em>really</em> think Eclipse' project management is a model to 
be copied. The CVS integration, last time I used it, wasn't bad at all (if a 
touch kludgey), and...</p> 
<p>And I'd rather use NetBeans than Eclipse, given a <strong>single</strong> 
project to work with. In fact, the only OS I'll use Eclipse on is Windows. 
Everywhere else... not a chance. Eclipse represents the worst of Java: an IDE, a
<strong>popular</strong> one, that isn't actually as much Java as I'd like. </p>
<p>Look: NetBeans sucks. I said that already, right? But I <em>can</em> run it 
on all of my OSes and have a reasonable expectation of what it looks like and 
how it works. It's<strong>NETBEANS</strong>. Not NetBeans/XP, not 
NetBeans/Linux, not NetBeans/Solaris. It's just NetBeans. IDEA (my editor of 
choice) is the same way: I install it, and the user experience is the same 
regardless of OS.<strong>That's</strong> where Swing rocks. It (IDEA and/or 
NetBeans) is one program, that I don't have to re-learn to use everywhere I use 
it.</p> 
<p>Eclipse... oh man, the first time I opened it up on another OS... ... I 
don't think I can describe my gut reaction in a public forum. It's<em>amazingly 
ugly</em>. It's awesome on some OSes... and when I pointed out how ugly it was 
on MY platform, here's a smattering of the responses I got:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>&quot;Why are you running THAT OS?&quot; </li> 
<li>&quot;Why don't you port SWT (to a different toolkit)?&quot; </li> 
<li>&quot;It's free!&quot; </li> </ul> 
<p>Um... right. I should choose my OS based on a specific program I want to 
run, regardless of whether that program fits the machine's overall goal.</p> 
<p>It's free, so I should just suffer in silence. </p> 
<p>Worse: I should port SWT to my chosen operating system and UI toolkit. 
While I realise that's the best gift economy move I could make, I'm a busy man. 
I have too much on my plate as it is, and too many good alternatives to take up 
porting SWT.</p> 
<p>This is what annoys me about Eclipse: the free moniker is misleading, the 
toolkit is ideal for a limited set of platforms, and the Eclipse people - 
sorry, guys - carry around this annoying flag of &quot;We're the underdog, HEAR 
US ROAR.&quot;</p>

<p>According to my experiences, Eclipse provides good look and feel in Linux 
environments compared to the other IDEs even though Eclipse looks quite pretty 
under Windows. And even the performance is good under Linux.</p> 
<p>With the huge set of plug-ins available, Eclipse is becoming the most 
useful IDE that I have used.</p> <br>

While NetBeans ain't perfect, far from it, SWT and Eclipse aren't right for 
Java, says Joseph Ottinger; a position with which Henry Roswell disagrees. Read 
the first of a new series of 'Point/Counterpoint' discussions...and join the 
80+ readers who have already weighed in on one side or other of the debate.</p>

<p>I would say, eclipse sucks on linux as much as linux sucks in itself. I 
have seen eclipse in action on Linux, and the look and feel and performance is 
not much worse than look and feel and performance of linux or any other IDE in 
linux itself. Besides, the bitter truth is that most of the biggies use 
primarily, the windows platform for application development, where eclipse is 
the nxtbest thing to JAVA itself. As far as open source goes, netbeans is a 
good IDE, however they have to make better effort to involve the community in 
development, like explaining the architecture through articles etc.</p> <br>

<br> Bharath 03/07/05 01:11:39 AM EST <br>

<p>Eclipse sucks on linux (that's what matters). NetBeans 4.0 continues to be 
the beauty that it is on Windoze and Linux. SWT throws platform independent 
rendering out of the window. I'm afraid, that's antithetical to java itself. 
Or, has IBM come up with SWT to bring in incompatibility, thereby kill Java 
&amp; hence Sun's lead in this area of technology? You never know. Anyways, 
eclipse &amp; swt are for windoze zombies. Netbeans is slick and superfast 
compared to the slow,bulky, memory-hogger that eclipse is. Just use ND 4.0 once 
and you'll never look elsewhere.</p> <br>

<p>Build it on the mac ... and it won't run</p> 
<p>Our company has been developing applications for Mac for many years.</p> 
<p>We recently found a troubling problem.</p> 
<p>We have Java application that has a native component tied to OS X.<br>

http://serialio.com/products/SerialMagic/index.htm</p> 
<p>In the past we built this app (except for the native component) on<br>
 a 
Windows PC and packaged it on OS X using JAR Bundler.</p> 
<p>It was a bit of extra trouble, but everthing worked reliably.<br>
 In an 
effort to streamline development we installed<br>
 netBeans IDE 4.0 for OS X.
</p> 
<p>After considerable effort we found that the JAR file produced<br>
 by 
netBeans IDE 4.0 for OS X, will not run on OS X.</p> 
<p>We can move the identical Java sources to a PC and compile<br>
 the JAR 
there, move that JAR back to the Mac, and use<br>
 the JAR Bundler to create 
the application, and it works.</p> 
<p>So in short<br>
 Build it on the mac ... and it won't run</p> <br>

<p>I'm not an experienced developer, but I used Eclipse for some plug-in 
development. I used it on both Windows and (mostly) Linux. Personally I think 
that gtk version of Eclipse looks cool (maybe the author used motif version, 
which is really ugly :)) The ui is responsive, and the same I cannot say about 
NetBeans, but I used it a year ago, version 3.x, so maybe now it's much better. 
I only remember, that even scrolling text in editor was a nightmare (512 megs 
of RAM). I like in Eclipse also VisualEditor - I remember, that in NetBeans, if 
you accidentally deleted some config file, you couldn't edit visually any more. 
Visual Editor is different - you can work with code, you can work visually, it 
is synchronized. Cool! I like also GEF and EMF, and many different cool things 
(I don't want to begin some IDE war again, please :))</p> <br>

<p>I read this article a few months ago, before NetBeans 3.6 was released and 
agreed with almost all the appreciations in it, specially that Eclipse was 
slightly better than NetBeans in overall (even that it sucks when running in 
Linux, my preferred OS). But TODAY (Aug 24/04) after NetBeans 3.6 and 4.0b have 
been released the story is completely different. NetBeans's group have made an 
excellent work in these last releases, 3.6 have a lot of improvements and 4.0 
is just going to be great (not yet finished). Don't really know what is going 
to happen with Eclipse project in the near future, maybe they are going to work 
for a better support on Linux and other OS's, but NetBeans is now a good 
competitor for them and hope that some day they (NB) will reach &quot;the 
top&quot; of this fight.</p> <br>

<p>Having used both Eclipse and Netbeans, my preference leans solidly towards 
Netbeans. SWT use and code refactoring are about all that Eclipse has to offer 
me that Netbeans doesn''t and in my experience and SWT is near useless for 
doing the kind of graphics manipulation that is possible with Swing like 
setting arbitrary clipping regions or using different affine transformations or 
customized pixel blending methods. Refactoring I will admit is sort of nice to 
have, but the Netbeans dev team is already on top of that, with refactoring 
listed at the very top of the new features list in Netbeans 4.0 (currently in 
alpha testing and slated for release before the fall of this year). I could 
theoretically use Eclipse right now and have refactoring today, but there are 
several other little features in Netbeans I like which _combined_ just aren''t 
worth giving up just for that one thing, IMO.</p> <br>

<p>I use Eclipse (gtk) on linux and don''t see big differences to eclipse on 
win2k.<br>
 What's looking so different, or are the diffences to the 
motif-Version or XP/ME/98/NT/95/3.11/3.1/2.0 :)</p> <br>

<p>Eclipse if great. There are lots of plugins that do a variety of things. 
Great CVS, Ant, Junit integration, good refactoring. I can also use it for 
other languages. Even the PHPEclipse plugin works well when I have a client for 
PHP. Eclipse was the firm IDE that made me finally leave vi behind for most of 
my devlopment.</p> 
<p>Sure drag and drop doesn't work on linux eclipse, but it's very usable on 
windows and linux.</p> 
<p>BTW for the Vikram, if the problem you descibe in WSAD is the one I've 
encountered, occasionaly the .project file can get corrupted. Remove .project, 
close and reopen the project and then rebuild all.</p> <br>

<p>Recently I came across few unexpected problems with WSAD 5.0.1.</p> 
<p>Converting EJB local to EJB remote messes up with Application.xml. No way 
to cure, tried many. Atlast ended up deleting and creating new project. Found 
little strange behaviour for settings related to compile when save the file, 
between two different machine. Too slow.<br>
 Cannot dare to use for large 
project. I think IDEA I liked.<br>
 One thing good about WSAD/Eclips, is its 
model.</p> 
<p>WSAD donot provide correct jndi name for local ejb, which is local:ejb/.... 
in case of WAS 5.0 , its annoying.<br>
 And it seems to me IBM one or other way 
wants to harrash java community by one or other way, why they cannot stick to
<br> java:comp/env or ejb/ for jndi naming for ejb, what they want to prove? We 
know they are stupid, do not have guts to innovate something like java, Its 
becos of my client I''m using WSAD.......</p> <br>

<p>Okay I use Eclipse so I''m biased.<br>
 And I don''t want to seem 
provocative, but Joseph Ottinger''s article and criticism are just totally 
wrong. The logic is flawed, the conclusion wrong.</p> 
<p>I say this because his main criticism is that Eclipse looks different on 
different platforms, whereas NetBeans looks the same.</p> 
<p>Yes it does, and well it should.</p> 
<p>Applications should look different on different platforms. Different 
platforms look different. The applications that run on them should strive be 
consistent with one another at the expense of being self-consistent across 
platforms.<br>
 If the other platform is an ugly platform with ugly-looking 
applications, then Eclipse should be ugly.</p> 
<p>Ottinger claims that this represents the &quot;worst of Java&quot;. But the 
promise of Java is &quot;write once run anywhere&quot;, not &quot;write once 
look the same everywhere&quot;. (Granted when it comes to GUI applications 
neither of these promises is kept, but you get the point)</p> 
<p>The one argument you could make in favor of Swing based applications here, 
is that if they offer a Look and Feel choice to the user, then the user gets to 
choose whether they are part of the 99.999% that want the platform default LnF 
or the Ottinger minority that wants the cross-platform LnF. The pluggable LnFs, 
however, are not nearly as truly &quot;native&quot; as the native components 
wrapped by SWT. And the many Swing applications that automatically select the 
platform LnF end up in the same situation as Eclipse on the &quot;ugly 
plafform&quot; - they are only as good as that version of the LnF (compared to 
only as good as that port of SWT).</p> 
<p>So if you''re one of the 0.0001% that needs to use Eclipse on many 
platforms regularly then heed well his sage advice. But if you''re one of the 
overwhelming majority who just wants a decent IDE on your platform of choice, 
ignore him completely.</p> <br>

<p>Swing vs SWT has nothing to do with Eclipse vs Netbeans vs 
YourFavoriteIDEHere.</p> 
<p>The most important reason to use an IDE is productivity.<br>
 And there 
every other IDE should keep an eye on eclipse.<br>
 At the moment Eclipse 
itself lacks strong support for J2EE development (you can buy some good plugins 
likewww.myeclipseide.com ).</p> 
<p>Very strange for me are the VS.net supporter in the comments. While VS is 
good in supporting a wide range of developer activities (html, xml, sql aso.), 
it lacks even the basic features while coding.<br>
 Ever tried to rename a 
class with VS.net-C++? A thing of seconds in Eclipse.<br>
 Ever tried to create 
getter&amp;setter? This does not even exist is VS.<br>
 Userdefined macros 
(called templates in Eclipse)? Do not exist.<br>
 Not to name all the more 
sophisticated things.<br>
 Like searching for all read &amp;| write accesses to 
a member.<br>
 A local history keeping an eye of all your changes.<br>
 
Refactorings like automatically generating a method from selected source code.

<p>As pointed earlier we have a discussion on two levels: 1. Eclipse vs 
Netbeans and consequently 2. SWT vs Swing.</p> 
<p>1. I used both IDEs. I wasn''t satisfied with Netbeans because it''s big 
and slow. However, since version 3.5 it became faster (and more to come). 
Eclipse is OK, but it runs slow on Linux. Actually on Linux I cannot really 
tell the difference between them (I use Mandrake 9.2 with the 2D hardware 
accelerated Sis driver). The JDK is the latest (1.4.2_02).</p> 
<p>However, memory consumption at startup is lower for Eclipse (57 megs) 
compared to Netbeans (97 megs).</p> 
<p>Now, I have to tell you that I dislike both Netbeans and Eclipse. I used a 
lot jEdit (www.jedit.org) and is the ideal open source Java editor/IDE. It 
isn''t backed by &quot;hairy chested&quot; companies but only developers. 
Actually it resembles to IDEA. Or IDEA resembles to jEdit :-D Hint: IDEA is on 
the market since 3 years and jEdit is around since 5 years.</p> 
<p>And you get a lot of plugins with jEdit. It performs better than Netbeans 
and it has a very powerful code editor (isn''t this one of the most important 
things?). Needless to say that the GUI is Swing based.</p> 
<p>2. Regarding SWT vs. Swing<br>
 We get three main threads:<br>
 - 
performance<br>
 For now SWT is faster on Windows than Swing. But not 
considerably faster (warning: do not compare Eclipse with Netbeans. Compare it 
with IDEA or jEdit). On Linux, it''s hard to see a winner. I haven''t seen it 
on MacOsX but I''d say it''s about the same situation the least (Swing has 
powerful hardware acceleration on that platform).</p> 
<p>- API<br>
 Swing''s API is truly object-oriented (or at least this is the 
tendency) and it the MVC pattern heavily used. Programming SWT reminds me of 
MFC and Win32 API which both suck (my recent programming experiences tell me 
that).</p> 
<p>- look&amp;feel (LAF)<br>
 Myth: Eclipse integrates better into the OS''s 
LAF. Right? WRONG!</p> 
<p>On Linux it certainly doesn''t look like a native application - the better 
look is GTK2 like. On Windows XP, hmm... I just put up Eclipse 2.1.2 on a WinXP 
machine. The scrollbars are XP like. So are the menus, and fonts. And the rest 
are custom controls anyway. Oh, wait. The bloody push buttons!!! They have a 
Win 9x/2k look regardless of the used OS theme (mine is XP Silver). So do combo 
boxes. But lists are OK. That''s hell of a LAF integration.</p> 
<p>Now, I start a Swing application (jEdit) and I set the Windows LAF. True, 
it requires a restart (I never understood why - it''s something from jEdit''s 
kitchen). And, what a suprise? We have a Java Swing application that look just 
like a native one: scrollbars, menus, fonts, _buttons_, _combos_, lists etc. 
Oh, and if you change the theme while running Swing applications with Windows 
LAF, the LAF changes dynamically.</p> 
<p>Now about that LAF integration. Let''s not strech this, shall we? Try it 
yourselves (Win XP sp1, J2sdk 1.4.2_03).</p> 
<p>My conclusions:<br>
 Eclipse is OK (let''s see how 3.0 raises the stake). 
Netbeans is OK (probably 3.6 will rock). jEdit is my choice :-) Try it and see 
why.</p> 
<p>SWT is inferior to Swing in almost every aspects. Personally, I prefer less 
performant but easily maintainable applications (that is Swing) over better 
performant and hardly maintainable ones (yes, SWT).</p> 
<p>One more thing regarding the performance of SWT and Swing. Swing''s 
performance will let''s say change in new j2sdk versions. Especially under 
Linux. Don''t ask me, I know nothing.</p> 
<p>Do you think SWT can get any more performant? Think about one or two years 
from now. Will you prefer an API that is poorly architected, less performant 
and has signs of LAF illness? And that isn''t 100% java?</p> 
<p>Think again.</p> <br>
<br>
sstrenn 12/29/03 07:38:27 PM EST <br>

<p>Folks, let''s just admit a few things about Swing. It is STILL SLOW after 
all of these years. There is virtually no getting around it. I recently loaded 
JBuilder v9 on my 3GHz, 1GB RAM Pentium 4 machine and I still notice delays 
when I click on menus. Did I mention it was version 9? And that it was written 
by the folks at Borland, who certainly know more about Swing than I do. The 
same delays hold for nearly every other significant Swing app I have used. You 
rarerly or never seen such delays in non-Swing apps.</p> 
<p>Swing''s LAF''s are cartoonish and their fonts are laughable. And having 
GUI controls based on native widgets is a significant advantage. When I deploy 
an SWT app in a corporate environment that is a mix of Win2000 and WinXP, the 
file dialogs, for example, all look exactly the way the USERS EXPECT, exactly 
the way it looks in all of their other apps.</p> 
<p>And Henry Roswell''s point about ease of developing responsive apps should 
be heeded. Take a number of ordinary, equally-trained programmers and have them 
write significant GUI-based apps in Swing and SWT respectively. The SWT apps 
are very likely to be fast and responsive. The Swing apps are not likely to be 
fast and responsive. As a teacher whose students use Swing, I wish that were 
not the case, but it is.</p>

<p>Charlie, you can view editors side by side by dragging an editor tab to the 
top, bottom, left or right of its current position. You can have as many rows 
and columns as you like. I also use Eclipse on OS X so I know it works on that 
too.</p> 
<p>Chang</p> <br>

Charlie 12/27/03 10:44:00 AM EST <br>

<p>I have been using v. 3 of eclipse on Mac OS X and the widgets look and act 
like the widgets on all the other Mac OS X programs the menu items appear where 
you would expect them to appear, context menus look and act like the other mac 
context menus scroll-bars, input boxes, dropdowns all with the the nice aqua 
interface which presumably take advantage of quartz extreme as does the latest 
release of awt and swing for OS X.</p> 
<p>I do have one complaint, I often want to look at editors side by side, how 
to achieve this in eclipse is not readily apparent to me, if it is indeed 
possible.</p> 
<p>I do not expect eclipse should look like a browser or photoshop or anything 
in particular, it certainly seemed intuitive to me, though. You have the basic 
framework most applications would require laid out in a straightforward manner 
... navigation pane on the left, menus on the top, with a toolbar directly 
beneath and a content area to the right of the navigation pane where views and 
editors appear as well as context menus where you would expect them. All basic 
stuff you see in many GUI applications on most GUI centric OS''s. It seems 
rather elegant in it''s simplicity, and certainly not ugly</p> <br>
<br>

Barnum 12/27/03 09:57:33 AM EST <br>

<p>This article exactly echoes my complaints of Eclipse. As a Mac OS X user, 
I''m used to an OS and applications that are intuitive, fast, decent-looking, 
and which don''t make me feel like I''m getting a chewed-up, hacked windows 
port.</p> 
<p>Maybe Eclipse is decent on Windows - never tried it. But the reason that I 
selected Java in the first place is because it makes the Mac into a first-class 
citizen, and levels the OS playing field. SWT goes against this level playing 
field concept. On the Mac, it is *ugly*, counter-intuitive, and has its own 
peculiar UI that inherits none of the behavior that I''m used to from other 
applications.</p> 
<p>My development tool of choice is IDE by a long shot, for the same reasons 
that many posters have already listed. You may complain about the price, and 
perhaps for those who program as a hobby or as a labor of love (ie. free), this 
is a valid complaint. However, I ama professional software developer, and I get 
paid alot of money for the software that I create. A $500 investment for a core 
tool that makes me more productive is such a clear cost-benefit winner that the 
cost is a non-issue.</p> <br>

<p>Hi T.</p> 
<p>You are right that Eclipse plug-ins could be handled better (e.g. made 
dynamically loadable/unloadable without restart). Thankfully, the Eclipse 
developers/developer community agree: check out the specs. for Eclipse 3 
(milestone 6 just released; final release Q2, 2004), there''s a slew of great 
stuff there.</p> 
<p>The Eclipse Visual Editor provides GUI builder support for Swing (now) and 
SWT (Q2, 2004).</p> <br>
<br>
T. Gibson 12/22/03 10:44:27 AM EST <br>

<p>One IDE to rule them all: IDEA IntelliJ </p> 
<p>IntelliJ is hands down the best of breed. It offers just about everything a 
true developer would want without all of the fluff. The refactoring tool is 
simply unmatched and I have used but NetBeans and Eclipse. ANT and CVS 
integration is nice, not a single hippcup. Other than the fact that it is not 
free I really don''t have a problem with it.</p> 
<p>Believe me I am not trying to shill for IntelliJ but sometimes you get what 
you pay for.</p> 
<p>I would have to give a slight nod to NetBeans for their Swing GUI Builder.
</p> 
<p>The primary problem with Eclipse is that is tries (sometimes unsucessfully) 
to be everything to everybody. For example the way that plug-ins are handled I 
think could be a lot cleaner.</p> 
<p>JDeveloper is cool if you are working with other Oracle products(such as 
database, BC4J, ect). It is so tightly integrated with other Oracle''s products 
it reminds of Microsoft.</p> 
<p>With all of that said Visual Studio simply destroys all of these IDEs 
including my favorite IntelliJ. Hopefully Project RAVE can raise the bar in the 
Java world.</p>

<p>Henry,</p> 
<p>That is the problem with these web posts, irony and tongue in cheek humor 
is not always obvious.</p> 
<p>Perhaps I was just a bit too subtle, and I am really not trying to start a 
flame war, only to point out what you have already said, Henry &amp; broad 
generalizations benefit no one. Specific and directed criticisms benefit us all 
even if we rebel against them initially.</p> 
<p>Perhaps as developers we have become so used to being defensive about our 
code that that attitude seeps into other aspects of our professional and 
non-professional lives.<br>
 Anyway, if I have offended anyone, I apologize, my 
intent was to interject some gentle humor and nothing else.</p>

<p>I used SWT for an international text widget to display Thai, Cambodian and 
Laotion. It was a failure. SWT''s I18N support sucks. I happily returned to 
SWING and have not regreted it. If SWT wants to be taken serioulsy it must be 
properly internationalized!!</p> <br>

<p>Joseph, I hate to point out the obvious retort, but if you RTFM then you 
will know that eclipse.exe is inadequate. You will need something like:</p> 
<p>C:\eclipse\eclipse.exe -vm C:\j2sdk1.4.2\bin\javaw.exe -vmargs 
-Djava.ext.dirs= -Xms128m -Xmx128m</p> 
<p>or something similar on non-Windows systems, of course.</p> <br>

Joseph Ottinger 12/16/03 11:55:30 AM EST <br>

<p>I hate to point out the obvious retort, but &quot;eclipse.exe&quot; on at 
least two of my platforms yields a &quot;command not found&quot; error... and 
that''s not because it''s not in my path. :)</p> <br>

<p>I''ve used Eclipse since 1.0 and love it... (I also loved VisualAge for 
Java). For those with memory problems using Eclipse, try the following: 
eclipse.exe -vmargs -Xms128m -Xmx128m. Also download the memory monitor view 
and install it. After a long time of editing/compiling you''ll notice that 
eclipse is a bit slower; switch to the memory monitor view and collect 
garbage.. Eclipse will once again be snappy..</p> <br>

<p>I am working on a probject and we decided to use Eclipse. Eclipse worked 
very well at first. However as the number of files has grown Eclipse has become 
more unstable. Eclipse runs out of memory every few hours.</p> 
<p>Also with medium sized files the editor slows down until it is almost 
unsuable. Our experience has become so bad that members of my team have started 
to check out other IDEs.</p> 
<p>BTW you really have to check out the latest NetBeans Development build. 
They have significally changed there UI and it is MUCH better. Finally Sun has 
got a clue about UI.</p> <br>
<br>
David L. Smith 12/14/03 03:56:22 PM EST <br>

<p>Bingo, Mr. Lawson. You described what being a developer is all about: 
building software that fits the users needs. It isn''t about promoting our 
beliefs or philosophies.</p> 
<p>Bottom line is that Eclipse works in some cases; but not all. I''m 
considering using Eclipse to build a client interface for many of the same 
reasons you have chosen  for example, an updatable framework, speed, and third 
party plug-ins.</p> <br>
<br>
Jeff Lawson 12/14/03 02:14:53 PM EST <br>

<p>I wrote a successful COTS product using Swing. Customers thought it was 
great because it enabled them to easily achieve XML/Database interoperability 
for very sophisticated DTDs and XML Schemas (CSDGM, GML, etc.).</p> 
<p>What my customers didn''t like too much was the requirement that they build 
Java projects and manage things like the Java class path. I didn''t like the 
fact that Swing was slow.</p> 
<p>In version 2, I migrated entirely to Eclipse. Now my code generates a Java 
project and Java issues like the class path are taken care of by Eclipse (it''s 
an Eclipse plug-in).</p> 
<p>Customers loved the fact that they can now achieve XML/Database 
interoperability without needing to be Java experts BUT they were blown away by 
the performance and the professional look of the version 2 product.</p> 
<p>I was able to leverage an enormous amount by moving to Eclipse and now 
customers want SWT-based thick-client GUIs from their DTDs and XML Schemas 
(they will be getting that in 2004, Q2).</p> 
<p>There has been much talk of wanting Java to succeed. For me, Java has 
succeeded but I can understand the worry that it may not continue to do so. The 
technical excellence of Java suggests that it ''deserves'' to succeed but the 
history of computing is littered with good-looking corpses while mediocre 
products have grown on the back of marketing.</p> 
<p>There is a danger that well-intentioned folks miss the point in some of 
these discussions and in efforts to find the best path forward. Talk of ''pure 
Java'', for instance, is in principle fine but often misses the mark. My 
Eclipse-based product was developed under Windows and ran first time without a 
problem on GTK Linux. I used ''pure Java'' even though the platform was not 
pure Java but who cares about the implementation of the platform provided that 
the end result works well? It''s irrelevant. My customers see a great product 
that they can run on a variety of operating systems and they don''t even care 
that it''s Java.</p> 
<p>Although much good work is being done to improve J2SE 1.5, some of the 
language changes are a joke: boxing of primitives and simpler for-loops, etc. 
add very little (declarative attributes for web services etc. will be good).</p>
<p>The one change that would make the largest difference in moving Java 
forward is the elimination of class path problems. Obviously, the class path is 
needed but it presents too many problems in far too many systems (having to use 
the correct class loader in some environments, for instance; lack of good 
diagnostics for novices; etc.). The class path needs a fundamental design 
change. I''ve been developing COTS software for twenty years (MC68000, C++, 
Java) so if the class path impedes my progress, and it does, then it''s broken.
</p> 
<p>Another great change would be for Java compliers to generate native code. 
We are so used to downloading platform-specific software (e.g. J2SE!!!), it''s 
a short step to ditching bytecode altogether (actually, keep it around for the 
nut-cases while those of us with a requirement to be commercial can go with the 
performance improvement).</p> 
<p>Those folks who see Java/JCP as a terrific development language and a 
sensational platform should not allow those who see Java as some sort of 
religion to set the agenda for ''purism'' when it''s pragmatism that is 
required.</p> 
<p>Software development is holy only to a few feeble-minded developers: for 
the everyone else its stuff that makes computers work and we want the sort of 
stuff that delivers the best results. When I see something better than Java, 
I''ll use it but I''d prefer that not to happen for a long time yet!</p> <br>

<br> Jon Allen 12/13/03 10:02:37 AM EST <br>

<p>To Maciek Wegorkiewicz:<br>
 Code locking is the resaon why I did not use 
Net Beans. Try JBuilder - It does it right. I won''t use Visual C++ editor 
because strange comments are added into the code, this is wrong also. The 
developer should be able to cut and paste code and see the changes in the 
designer as it happens. Visual Caffe also did it right, but had a strange event 
editor that I never figured out. All designers must be two way with no limits 
in my book.</p> <br>
<br>
Charlie Fulnecky 12/13/03 08:45:12 AM EST <br>

<p>First I must confess I have little experience with NetBeans, I have tried 
it but it never offered me enough to switch from JDeveloper with which I was 
comfortable. Eclipse is a horse of a completely different color. The 
architecture of the framework is ideal for implementing what is referred to as 
composable architectures in the DOD community. The ability to develop, deploy, 
download, install, update and use interoperable tools all from within the same 
environment appeals to me on so many levels.</p> 
<p>As for SWT vs Swing, they both have pro''s and cons, but for tool and 
application development I have found that a common look and feel is key to 
integration of various tools used in mission critical applications, and the 
unfortunate truth is that most DOD sites have standardized on windows, the 
advantage to SWT is that widgets behave as the user expects them to behave, 
wether it is 98,NT,2000,XP, OSX or Linux making cross tool/application training 
(read java and non-java) more intuitive.<br>
 I have been using eclipse for 
about 3 months now, on Redhat 9, Mac OSX, Win98, NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 and 
love the interface on all of them.</p> 
<p>If I can''t find an open source or free plugin, I have been able to write 
my own after purchasing a few of the 5 or 6 available books on eclipse (really 
interested in the Eclipse Modeling Framework)</p> 
<p>I am willing to admit the possibility that NetBeans may be a superior Java 
IDE, however, the shear number and diversity of plugins available for eclipse 
makes it obvious to me that as an application/tools framework eclipse is the 
obvious choice. And the JDT (eclipse Java Development Tools) is a wonderful 
source of code and concepts for my own plugins and features.</p> <br>
<br>

Thomas Hallgren 12/13/03 05:40:32 AM EST <br>

<p>A somewhat filosofical reflection...</p> 
<p>We have at least two main contenders in both the Open Source IDE and the 
Java GUI market. This is extremely good news. Why? Simply because competition 
is what drives improvement.</p> 
<p>So to all you Netbeans fans, rejoice over Eclipse! It forces Netbeans to 
improve. And vice versa. Same goes for Swing and SWT. And while all users 
should be happy about this, let the implementors sharpen their swords and keep 
on fighting.</p> 
<p>And may Borland tremble at the though of it all (and lower their prices 
significantly ;-) ).</p> <br>

<p>I am using WSAD which I believe based on Eclipse, there are few annoying 
things with this IDE, it bothers me pretty much. I also used sun one IDE which 
I found more easy, intutive, industry standard expectation in editor like I can 
match my opening and closing brackets by keys and can navigate using that as a 
technique such a small long time feature of editor is not there in WSAD,<br>
 
WSAD locks files on Windows OS, Needs to restart WSAD or some times even 
windows, suddenly shows some files has errors, but in reality there is no 
errors found, Once I have those errors my project will not be built, there is 
no way I can compile a single file (Damn stupid). gives falls warning on JSP 
scripts with no proper explanation, the worst integration with cvs, I check out 
the project from CVS, WSAD creates that project on file system but does not 
show up on any perspective even after refresh, restart etc..<br>
 It also 
creates some runtime error which I have not seen so far, using any IDE and sun 
jdk x.x, just does not make sense to me.</p> 
<p>Overall frustrating experience, Its not robust, would use any other IDE 
over WSAD like IDEA or sun one.</p> 
<p>About me using Java/J2ee for around six year, believeing in<br>
 
innovative, creative environment.</p> 
<p>Good to know that sun has not joined eclipse.org for good or bad, Expecting 
healthy and serious competition from sun.<br>
 For sun its time to start your 
show.</p> <br>

<p>I like Eclipse, no surprise: I liked VisualAge.</p> 
<p>Eclipse isn''t as pretty on linux, it''s true. The motif version is 
butt-ugly, and (for me) the GTK version is crashy.</p> 
<p>This doesn''t bother me because I like it enough to watch it improve. I 
like that it is similar to VisualAge. I like that it is OpenSource. I like that 
I can write the &quot;Hello World&quot; plugin and add it in. I like that other 
people have written very powerful plugins some of which I''ve downloaded. 
Eclipse isn''t just &quot;a&quot; tool: my combination of plugins makes Eclipse 
&quot;my&quot; tool. I like that it gets better with every 
&quot;milestone&quot; release. All of this makes Eclipse so fun to work with, 
that I don''t mind its warts: they seem temporary.</p> 
<p>If it stops being fun, I''ll switch tools. Until then, I''ll be coding with 
a silly grin on my face.</p> 
<p>Cheers!</p> <br>

Jess Holle 12/12/03 03:11:37 PM EST <br>

<p>I''ve used NetBeans for almost between 1 and 2 years now.</p> 
<p>It took me a few couple of hours to figure out how to get started with -- 
an issue purely of poor presentation of a few critical starting concepts -- all 
of which should be (finally) addressed in 3.6 as I understand it. After that 
most everything has been fairly straightforward.</p> 
<p>The first several versions were slow -- especially with JVM''s prior to 
1.4.2. By NetBeans 3.5.1 and Java 1.4.2 (why would you bother with any JVM 
prior to that to run a Java IDE?), NetBeans runs quite quickly. [Tuning the JVM 
heap and gc parameters helps too -- NetBeans should do better at this 
out-of-the-box for &quot;known&quot; VMs, e.g. Sun''s.]</p> 
<p>I tried Eclipse hoping to get a good feel for its capabilities and 
advantages. I figured this should take no more than the few hours I wasted 
getting up to speed with NetBeans -- given all the hype about it being easier 
to use. I ended up giving up -- perhaps because I was never a Visual Age user.
</p> 
<p>I tend to agree with the pro-Swing side of the SWT and Swing comments thus 
far. Especially telling is the notion that IBM made the Swing vs. SWT decision 
while they were on a 1.2.2 JVM. IBM lags Sun''s JVM releases by *way* too far - 
at least in the versions they use in their products and they have themselves to 
blame for this. SWT is a neat native component integration technology when it 
comes to ActiveX components. As with any other part of the application, 
however, one should code to all platforms except in narrow cases where one 
truly needs to write platform-specific code.</p> 
<p>Coding apps (vs. very carefully targeted pieces thereof) in SWT is an 
over-reaction and a design decision that is already obsolete. In Java 2 v1.4.2 
Swing can be plenty fast -- as shown by IDEA. NetBeans'' does not make such a 
compelling argument for Swing, but in recent versions it does not make a case 
against Swing either. The nature and timing of this improvement points to both 
improvements in each Java version and improvements in NetBeans'' application 
code.</p> 
<p>In any event some of us have to support a half-dozen or more disparate 
platforms with every GUI we write and there is not enough time in the world to 
adequately sweat the platform specific quality differences and deployment 
details (applets, anyone?) of all of this with SWT. I don''t really care that 
SWT looks 5% better or even 30% better on Windows if it does not behave 
consistently well on all platforms and deploy without requiring native code 
beyond that in the JRE!</p> <br>
<br>
Scott Shaffer 12/12/03 12:59:04 PM EST 
<br> 
<p>Dear Mr. Blanton,</p> 
<p>If the greatest criticism of IBM''s ability to create a user interface is 
to refer to it''s OS/2 operating system, I feel quite comfortable in my choice 
to use Eclipse. Somehow I doubt whether you have ever used OS/2. I have, and I 
am still waiting for the other OS''s to catch up to the user capabilities I had 
with OS/2 years ago.</p> 
<p>regards</p> <br>
<br>
Jeff Blanton 12/12/03 12:20:27 PM EST <br>

<p>Well after using both Netbeans and Eclipse extensively for well over a year 
now I can say without hesitation that Netbeans is far superior in every way. 
Netbeans is just pure Java and produces pure Java Swing with no extra crap 
thrown in. Netbeans has a far more intuitive interface and is just dang 
powerful. It does everything you could possibly want to do in an IDE. When I 
fired up Eclipse on the other hand it took quite a bit of time just to figure 
out how the dang tool worked. Eclipse''s use of those dang views for different 
behaviors is counter intuitive and a kluge. Eclipse feels like twenty different 
apps smashed together with glue and paper clips while Netbeans is clean and 
intuitive. Netbeans is far closer to Microsoft''s Visual Basic environment 
which is by far one of the best development environments ever made. Eclipse on 
the other hand feels like a glorified form of Wordpad. IBM just can''t make a 
good user interface to save their lives, need I remind anyone of OS/2 and Lotus 
Notes! So if you want a good IDE that is free, is Java standard, and runs on 
just about anything, there is only one choice and that is NetBeans.</p> <br>

<br> David Whiteman 12/12/03 11:53:18 AM EST <br>

<p>Denis, Eclipse has all of those except the VCE out of the box. And work is 
underway on an open source VCE for Eclipse (see an earlier post in this thread 
for a reference).</p> <br>
<br>
Denis Baranov 12/12/03 11:42:48 AM EST <br>

<p>Dan Bartel, your generalization does not stand. I loved VisualAge (for its 
VCE, debugger, bytecode hot-swap, code-assisting...) but Eclipse means nothing 
to me.</p> <br>
<br>
Patrick Schriner 12/12/03 11:32:38 AM EST <br>

<p>@Darren: You might make a SWING application that looks native, but thats 
not the same as being native (in most aspects).</p> 
<p>(I just tock a look at 
http://www.netbeans.org/kb/articles/win_sys_quick.html, or 
http://www.jgoodies.com/)</p> 
<p>I do not see a good reason why I would want my Linux app that is by 
coincidence written in Java make look like Windows. That is even more true for 
MacOS X or Windows CE. Maybe for Linux the battle for the best GUI Toolkit has 
not been fought to the end (which might explain bad performance (missing 
cooperation)), but that is not an Eclipse problem. As anyone registered on the 
Eclipse Developer Mailing List (something I recommend for anyone developing for 
Eclipse) might have noticed, there is some thinking into contributing to GTK 
(for instance), something Microsoft has done for MacOS X as well (for better 
Office X integration).</p> 
<p>@Josh: Eclipse might be hyped against VS, but is battling on a different 
field. Eclipse is Code-Centric, VS is not.</p> <br>
<br>
Josh Vas 12/12/03

<p>It''s great to have opinions, even if you work for the company that makes 
the IDE you''re stumping for here. It''s clear to me that this visceral 
reaction to SWT fully reflects the pressure Eclipse is putting on the Borlands 
and Suns of the world. It seems to me like these companies had the chance to 
serve their respective communities by not exploiting them, but decided to try 
to lock them in anyway. SWT is a great idea and will probably be the ''last man 
standing'' in the battle vs. .NET, but IMO Sun et. al. have themselves to blame 
for continuing to dish out their self-serving ideologies.</p> <br>
<br>
Brad 
O''Hearne 12/12/03 10:53:23 AM EST <br>

<p>The funny thing about these articles was that the title was all wrong. This 
wasn''t point/counterpoint between Netbeans and Eclipse. Neither guy 
particularly cared for Netbeans -- and the real debate was SWT. Ironically, 
that seems to be the same debate Sun and IBM are having.</p> 
<p>I wrote a Netbeans module last year and used it intensively. While the 
framework is interesting, the actual performance was prohibitively miserable. 
Its what I call PatheticWare -- not exactly a virus, but performs so poorly it 
is nearly impossible to use. Eclipse on windows rocks. I will be trying it on 
my Powerbook soon. And having programmed in SWT, I really like it. However, 
while both SWT and Swing are impressive, both API''s have missed the boat with 
some design aspects, and something better will come along eventually.</p> <br>

<br> Steve Harris 12/12/03 10:43:18 AM EST <br>

<p>Why do you want to develop on Linux, if eclipse runs better on Windows?</p> 
<br> <br>
Dana Kaufman 12/12/03 10:42:23 AM EST <br>

<p>To Maciek Wegorkiewicz:</p> 
<p>JBuilder Swing Designer has no code locking. It is a true two-way tool.</p> 
<br> <br>
Maciek Wegorkiewicz 12/12/03 10:39:05 AM EST <br>

<p>To Jon Allen:<br>
 Code locking is one of the greatest NetBeans advantages.
<br> It provides you with real two-way process between form editor and source 
editor. If you have no code locking, you have no form editor but form wizard 
for real. Think of it.<br>
 If you put any changes into code generated by GUI 
editor how can you apply changes in that GUI editor? You risk that your code is 
overwritten or made functioning wrong. In NetBeans you are not afraid of it.</p>
<br> <br>
Jon Allen 12/12/03 10:30:26 AM EST <br>

<p>I tried Net Beans and hated the code locking, where you could only edit 
where it let you. I am doing embedded Java now and that group says that Eclipse 
is so much better. I tried to like Eclipse. Its kind of nice but it made a mess 
out of my project. Added too many directories. Its also strange to work with! I 
downloaded JBuilder 9 personal. And that is what I am sticking with. JBuilder 9 
personal has 90% of the features I need in an interface I like by far the best. 
I have been using JBuilder for 6 years and still have not seen a replacement 
from the Open Source world. (And for those who say that Java has no IDE like C# 
has from MS Visual Studio... I hate Visual Studio!)</p> <br>
