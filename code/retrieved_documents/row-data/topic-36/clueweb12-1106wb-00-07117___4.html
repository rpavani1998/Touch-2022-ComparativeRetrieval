<h1>NetBeans 7.1 Review</h1> Posted on January 21, 2012 by daleV <br>

<p>One of outcomes of switching jobs is you lose some of your favorite 
tools.&nbsp; For me that was Zend Studio.&nbsp; Having done PHP development 
full time for many years, Zend Studio had become my IDE of choice.</p> 
<p>Since Zend Studio costs money, as a newbie to my new company, I didn't see 
a lot of Zend Studio's installed.&nbsp; In fact, I saw few IDE's.&nbsp; Most of 
the edits were done on a Linux server running Vim. This seemed a little archaic 
to me.&nbsp; I wanted to set up my beloved work environment, back to 
open-source.</p> 
<p>Naturally, I downloaded Eclipse PDT based on the Helios release, on which 
Zend Studio is built.&nbsp; I had used Eclipse before Zend Studio, and so this 
was pretty close to home.&nbsp; All the menus and functionality, except for 
some of the Zend Studio features, are the same.</p> 
<p>In the process of configuring Eclipse, I, of course, started messing with 
preferences.&nbsp; Anyone who has used Eclipse understands what a nightmare the 
Eclipse preferences are.&nbsp; It takes you quite a bit of time to initially 
configure preferences.&nbsp; So you don't have to reconfigure then again, you 
export your preferences and import them to the new Eclipse environments.</p> 
<p>I did an import of my Zend Studio preferences and then started changing 
some setting, and I had a hiccup.&nbsp; The hiccup was Eclipse balked at some 
setting I set, and blew away my entire workspace.&nbsp; I'm guessing Zend 
Studio preferences have problems with importing to Eclipse.&nbsp; I had to 
reload everything including re-configuring my preferences.&nbsp; What a 
nightmare.</p> 
<p>When things like this happen, I get pissed, and go looking for new 
tools.&nbsp; After a preliminary search showed that Netbeans had good reviews, 
I decided to give it a try.&nbsp; I had tried Netbeans before, and found it 
wanting for PHP development, but that was four years ago.&nbsp; It deserved 
another look.</p> 
<p>NetBeans Initial Start Up Screen</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Netbeans is a Java application and requires Java to run, which is probably 
already loaded on your computer.&nbsp; The Netbeans license is owned by Oracle 
from its acquisition of Sun, but it is a free and open source IDE.</p> 
<p>Since PHP is now an object-oriented language, like Java, NetBeans has 
incorporated PHP into its editor.&nbsp; You have a choice to install NetBeans 
with just the PHP bundle, which is what I did, since I do not do a lot of Java 
work.</p> 
<p>The Netbeans 7.1 download and install was seamless. The installer downloads 
46.6 Mb, which grows to 152.5 Mb on install.&nbsp; By the way, my Eclipse 
Helios folder checks in at 390 Mb. The installation took about 5 minutes and 
NetBeans came up quickly and easily.</p> 
<p>NetBeans with various Windows open</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you do a feature by feature analysis of Eclipse and Netbeans, you'll 
find that both IDE's pretty much have the same features and 
functionality.&nbsp; You'll find several good articles on the web about this, 
so I won't go into individual features here.</p> 
<p>NetBeans main editor window with other windows closed</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your doing Java development, Netbeans should be your IDE of choice, 
since it was built with Java development in mind.&nbsp; What surprised me was 
how far Netbeans has come as a PHP development environment.&nbsp; If your a PHP 
Developer, NetBeans has integrated support for Git, Debugging, PHPUnit testing, 
PHPDoc, Smarty templates, Symfony Framework, and the Zend framework. Need I say 
more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If both IDE's pretty much have the same functionality, what is the 
difference between the two?&nbsp; Well, it comes down to the feel of the IDE as 
your using them.</p> 
<p>I thought about good analogies and similes for the two editors.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Here's my take.&nbsp; Eclipse is like an old car that you keep fixing up, it's 
serviceable and runs good, but every once in a while, you get irritated, 
because something doesn't work right.&nbsp; Netbeans seems like a new BMW 
sports car.&nbsp; If Eclipse is a house built with a series of additions, 
Netbeans is a house built from the ground up by an architect.&nbsp; Eclipse 
feels bloated.&nbsp; Netbeans feels integrated, not like your bringing up a 
separate application every time you go to a new area of the IDE.</p> 
<p>One major weakness in Eclipse is setting preferences on how you want the 
editor to work.&nbsp; Each plugin added to Eclipse has its own preferences, 
every section of Eclipse has it own preferences.&nbsp; What that means is 
setting preferences is a nightmare.&nbsp; Not only that, if you set a 
preference in one area, it might not be set in another, and may collide with 
another preference, sometime throwing errors, or shutting down the 
editor.&nbsp; I've had all of this happen.</p> 
<p>In contrast, NetBeans preferences are a pleasure.&nbsp; Colors and fonts 
are configured in one tab, PHP in another tab.&nbsp; You can set all colors and 
fonts for all languages at once, not like Eclipse.</p> 
<p>NetBeans Fonts and Colors Preference Screen</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In all fairness to Eclipse, I'm comparing this to Eclipse Helios PDT.&nbsp; 
I downloaded the Eclipse Indigo 64bit and added the PDT plugin, and I find this 
version quicker,&nbsp; and much more stable.&nbsp; I would recommend Eclipse 
PDT users uninstall Helios, download Indigo, and add PDT.&nbsp; I think you'll 
like it&nbsp; better, if you stay with Eclipse.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, because of problems I've had configuring colors with 
Eclipse, even using theEclipse Color Theme Plugin I wrote about in another 
post, I find myself using NetBeans to write my code.</p> 
<p>I highly recommend you download and try NetBeans.&nbsp; You can have both 
IDE's running at the same time without conflicts.&nbsp; If you don't like 
NetBeans, you can stay with Eclipse, but in the process of using both, I think 
you'll find yourself gradually moving to NetBeans as your IDE of choice.</p>

<p>why would we gradually move? because setting preferences is difficult in 
eclipse?<br>
 or because netbeans was created with java in mind? AFAIK eclipse 
was also designed with java development in mind.<br>
 I am a long time user of 
Eclipse and ex netbeans user and I have to disagree with your arguments. 
setting preferences is straightforward and java development support is great. 
the feel you get while developing is also not as bloated and &ldquo;old 
car&rdquo; as you say</p> </li>

<p>from my perspective &ndash; Eclipse is slow, too bloated, and clumsy. 
Netbeans is better. But both of these are far from &ldquo;the best IDE&rdquo;. 
I love open source, and my current choice is Netbeans, but I&rsquo;m constantly 
searching for better and faster &nbsp;native aps (for linux or windows), which 
are not slow and clumsy as these two </p> </li>

<p>No&hellip; I will certainly not go back to Netbeans. For simple things it 
is ok, but Eclipse outperforms it in nearly everything advanced. Netbeans is 
like an editor with a little bit of sophisticated tool calling where Eclipse 
really is an IDE.</p> </li> 
<ul> 
<li> Anders <br>

<p>No.. i will certainly not go back to Eclipse!&nbsp;<br>
 I have been using 
both eclipse and netbeans professionally (java), and when i can choose myself 
its a nobrainer: Netbeans!Netbeans do the same things as eclipse &ndash; but 
smoother and with all the stuff you need build in out of the box.Not saying 
that netbeans can do things that eclipse can&rsquo;t &ndash; the same is true 
the other way around, but in my experience netbeans just is more intuitive to 
use.</p> </li>

<li> Deliasmes <br>

<p>that is if you can download it</p> </li> </ul> </ul> 
<li> Vojtech Krasa <br>

<p>IntelliJ 11 is so awesome, that I have even bought it.<br>
 BTW Netbeans 
settings preferences compared to IntelliJ is not so good&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>I agree only that netbeans is more newbie friendly and you don&rsquo;t have 
to know much about classpath and compiling/building to produce a working 
application.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But when you want more control and more advanced stuff I&rsquo;m pretty 
sure eclipse is the way to go.</p> 
<p>By the way&hellip; I was netbeans fanatic for a long time then I tried 
eclipse again and I&rsquo;m certain now I won&rsquo;t switch back to netbeans. 
Maybe intellij is next step but certanly not netbeans.</p> 
<p>Anyways netbeans is a great tool after all. I give you that&hellip;</p>

<p>for me Netbeans is wisely written IDE, very intuitive, effective, &hellip;

<p>I use Netbeans for PHP and the support is awesome. Netbeans is the best.</p>

<p>Pingback: NetBeans 7.1 Review: &quot;Eclipse is like an old... | Eclipse | 
Syngu</p> </li>

<p>I just started developing in PHP (coming form Microsoft/Visual Studio) and 
spent quite a bit of time looking for a PHP IDE.&nbsp; I trialed all the 
commercial IDE&rsquo;s/editors and so money really wasn&rsquo;t an issue.&nbsp; 
Netbeans won out.</p> </li> 
<li> Anton <br>

<p>Hi I use both:<br>
 1. eclipse + pydev for python (since the python support 
in netbeans has more ore less been dropped)<br>
 2. netbeans for php 
development.<br>
 One main argument for netbeans against eclipse+pdt:<br>
 In 
netbeans you can format the sourcecode (and adapting your coding styles).<br>
 
In eclipse+pdt I can only change the tab-space (at least I did not find 
anything else).</p> 
<p>&hellip; and pdt seems to have lost the development momentum (I tested it 3 
months ago the last time).</p> 
<p>Actually there is a funny alternative: aptana studio whicht is based on 
eclipse.<br>
 Here you can for &ldquo;format source code&rdquo; and adapt a lot 
of stuff BUT: they do *not*<br>
 use pdt, they use another plugin (phpedit or 
so..)<br>

<li> Deliasmes <br>

<p>i can not download netbean&rsquo;s latest version it says &ldquo;The 
requested URL /netbeans/7.1/final/bundles/netbeans-7.1-ml-linux.sh was not 
found on this server.&rdquo; when i try to download.</p> </li> 
<li> Lucho Pintado <br>

<p>netbeans rocks, it has all of php developer needs&hellip; and very 
configurable</p> </li> 
<li>  http://twitter.com/bbeniston Beniston <br>

<p>I feel very much comfortable with Netbeans. As far as the Php-oops oriented 
coding is concern I would recommend Netbeans as the IDE.</p> </li> 
<li> Guest <br>

<p>using vi is not archaic, once you know vi. if you don&rsquo;t want to use 
vi, use phpstorm.</p> </li> 
<li>  http://twitter.com/lorenzosjb lorenzosjb <br>

<p>It is possible to configure Netbeans 7.1.1 with Zend Server CE? It is my 
prefered php server. Thanks.</p> </li> </ul> <br>
