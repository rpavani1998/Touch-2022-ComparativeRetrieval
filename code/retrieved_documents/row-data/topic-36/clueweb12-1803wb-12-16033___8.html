<h2>Basic Project Concepts</h2> 
<p>This section provides an overview of some background information on the 
IDE's project system.</p> 
<h3>Projects</h3> 
<p> In the IDE, you always work inside of a project. In addition to source 
files, an IDE project contains metadata about what belongs on the classpath, 
how to build and run the project, and so on. The IDE stores project information 
in a project folder which includes an Ant build script and properties file that 
control the build and run settings, and a<code>project.xml</code> file that 
maps Ant targets to IDE commands.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> Though the IDE puts source directories within the project 
folder by default, your source directories do not necessarily need to be 
located in the project folder.</p> 
<h3>Ant</h3> 
<p>Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool used to standardize and automate 
build and run environments for development. The IDE's project system is based 
directly on Ant. All of the project commands, like Clean and Build Project and 
Debug, call targets in the project's Ant script. You can therefore build and 
run your project outside the IDE exactly as it is built and run inside the IDE.
</p> 
<p>It is not necessary to know Ant to work with the IDE. You can set all the 
basic compilation and runtime options in the project's Project Properties 
dialog box and the IDE automatically updates your project's Ant script. If you 
are familiar with Ant, you can customize a standard project's Ant script or 
write your own Ant script for a project.</p> 
<h2>Creating a Project</h2> 
<p><b>To create a new project:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N on Windows/Cmd-Shift-N on Mac 
OS X).</li> </ul> 
<p>When the New Project wizard appears, select the right template for your 
project and complete the remaining wizard steps. The project template icon can 
be displayed in gray, which means that this project type has not been 
activated. Proceed with creating the project and this functionality will be 
activated in the IDE.</p> 
<p>The IDE contains the following standard project templates for Java and Java 
Web applications:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Java Application.</b> Creates a skeleton Java SE project with a main 
class. SeeDeveloping and Deploying General Java Applications for a brief 
tutorial that uses this template.</li> 
<li><b>Java Class Library.</b> Creates a skeleton Java class library without a 
main class. SeeDeveloping and Deploying General Java Applications for a brief 
tutorial that uses this template.</li> 
<li><b>Java Project with Existing Sources.</b> Creates a Java SE project based 
on your own Java sources. SeeSetting Up a Java Project Based on Existing Sources
 below.</li> 
<li><b>Web Application.</b> Creates a skeleton web application, including 
options to add various web frameworks. SeeIntroduction to Developing Web 
Applications for an example that uses this template.</li> 
<li><b>Web Application with Existing Sources.</b> Creates a web project based 
on your own web and Java sources. SeeSetting Up a Web Project Based on Existing 
Sources below.</li> </ul> 
<p>In addition, the IDE also contains templates for EJB modules, enterprise 
applications, Java ME applications, and more.</p> 
<p>The Java and Web project categories also have free-form project templates. 
The free-form templates enable you to use an existing Ant script for a project 
but require manual configuration. SeeFree-Form Projects below.</p> 
<p>When you finish creating a project, it opens in the IDE with its logical 
structure displayed in the Projects window and its file structure displayed in 
the Files window:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> The Projects window is the main entry point to your project sources. It 
shows a logical view of important project contents such as Java packages and 
Web pages. You can right-click any project node to access a popup menu of 
commands for building, running, and debugging the project, as well as opening 
the Project Properties dialog box. The Projects window can be opened by 
choosing Window &gt; Projects (Ctrl-1 on Windows/Cmd-1 on Mac OS X).</li> 
<li> The Files window shows a directory-based view of your projects, including 
files and folders that are not displayed in the Projects window. From the Files 
window, you can open and edit your project configuration files, such as the 
project's build script and properties file. You can also view build output like 
compiled classes, JAR files, WAR files, and generated Javadoc documentation. 
The Files window can be opened by choosing Window &gt; Files (Ctrl-2 on 
Windows/Cmd-2 on Mac OS X).</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> If you need to access files and directories that are outside 
of your project directories, you can use the Favorites window. You open the 
Favorites window by choosingWindow &gt; Favorites (Ctrl-3 on Windows/Cmd-3 on 
Mac OS X). You add a folder or file to the Favorites window by right-clicking 
in the Favorites window and choosing Add to Favorites.</p> 
<h2>Importing a Project</h2> 
<p>This section shows you how to handle the initial importing of projects into 
the IDE.</p> 
<h3>Importing an Eclipse Workspace</h3> 
<p>For Eclipse projects, you can use the Import Eclipse Project wizard to help 
you create NetBeans projects from projects in an Eclipse workspace and import 
the project classpaths and other settings. When you use the Import Eclipse 
Project wizard, you do not need to use create and configure the NetBeans 
project manually. Open the wizard by choosingFile &gt; Import Project &gt; 
Eclipse Project. See Importing Eclipse Projects into NetBeans IDE for 
information on how the wizard works and how you can work simultaneously in 
Eclipse and NetBeans projects.</p> 
<h3>Setting Up a Java Project Based on Existing Sources</h3> 
<p>For other Java projects developed outside of NetBeans, you use an 
&quot;Existing Sources&quot; template in the New Project wizard to make a 
NetBeans project. In the wizard, you identify the location of the sources and 
specify a location for the NetBeans project metadata. You then use the Project 
Properties dialog box toconfigure the project.</p> 
<p><b>To set up a NetBeans project for an existing Java application:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N on Windows/Cmd-Shift-N on Mac 
OS X). </li> 
<li>Choose Java &gt; Java Project with Existing Sources. Click Next. </li> 
<li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, follow these steps: 
<ul> 
<li>Type a project name.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Change the location of the project folder.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Change the name of the build script used by the IDE. This might 
be desirable if there is already a build script called<code>build.xml</code> 
that is used to build the sources.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Select the Use Dedicated Folder for Storing Libraries checkbox 
and specify the location for the libraries folder. SeeSharing Project Libraries 
for more information on this option.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Select the Set as Main Project checkbox. When you select this 
option, keyboard shortcuts for commands such as Clean and Build Main Project 
(Shift-F11) apply to this project.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Click Next to advance to the Existing Sources page of the wizard.</li> 
<li>In the Source Packages Folder pane, click Add Folder. Then navigate to 
your sources and select the source roots, click Open.
<p>When you add a folder containing source code, you must add the folder that 
contains the highest folder in your package tree. For example, for the<code>
com.mycompany.myapp.ui</code> package, you add the folder that contains the 
<code>com</code> folder. </p></li> 
<li>(Optional) In the Test Package Folders pane, click Add Folder to select 
the folder containing the JUnit package folders.</li> 
<li>Click Next to advance to the Includes &amp; Excludes page of the wizard.
</li> 
<li>(Optional) In the Includes &amp; Excludes page of the wizard, enter file 
name patterns for any files that should be included or excluded from the 
project. By default, all files in your source roots are included.</li> 
<li> Click Finish. </li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Setting Up a Web Project Based on Existing Sources</h3> 
<p>For web projects developed outside of NetBeans, you use an &quot;Existing 
Sources&quot; template in the New Project wizard to make a NetBeans project. In 
the wizard, you identify the location of the sources and specify a location for 
the NetBeans project metadata. You then use the Project Properties dialog box to
configure the project.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> If the project was originally developed in Eclipse, you might 
be able to save time by using the Import Eclipse Project wizard instead of the 
New Project wizard. The Import Eclipse Project wizard enables you to import 
multiple projects simultaneously, including their configurations. SeeImporting 
Eclipse Projects Into NetBeans IDE.</p> 
<p><b>To set up a NetBeans project for an existing web application:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N on Windows/Cmd-Shift-N on Mac 
OS X). </li> 
<li>Choose Java Web &gt; Web Application with Existing Sources. Click Next. 
</li> 
<li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, follow these steps: 
<ul> 
<li>In the Location field, enter the folder that contains the web 
application's source root folders and web page folders.</li> 
<li>Type a project name.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Change the location of the project folder.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>(Optional) Select the Use Dedicated Folder for Storing Libraries checkbox 
and specify the location for the libraries folder. SeeSharing Project Libraries 
in NetBeans IDE for more information on this option.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Select the Set as Main Project checkbox. When you select this 
option, keyboard shortcuts for commands such as Clean and Build Main Project 
(Shift-F11) apply to this project.</li> 
<li>Click Next to advance to the Server and Settings page of the wizard.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Add the project to an existing enterprise application.</li> 
<li>Select a server to which to deploy. If the server that you want does not 
appear, click Add to register the server in the IDE.</li> 
<li>Set the source level to the Java version on which you want the application 
to run.</li> 
<li>(Optional) Adjust the context path. By default, the context path is based 
on the project name.</li> 
<li>Click Next to advance to the Existing Sources and Libraries page of the 
wizard.</li> 
<li>Verify all of the fields on the page, such as the values for the Web Pages 
Folder and Source Package Folders.</li> 
<li> Click Finish. </li> </ol> 
<h3>Free-Form Projects</h3> 
<p>There are also project templates available for free-form projects. In 
free-form projects, the IDE uses targets in an existing Ant script to build, 
run, clean, test, and debug your application. If the Ant script does not 
contain targets for some of these functions, the functions are unavailable for 
the project. To implement these functions you write targets either in your Ant 
script or in a secondary Ant script.</p> 
<p>In general, it is better to use standard &quot;With Existing Sources&quot; 
project templates for importing projects. For Eclipse projects, it is best to 
use the Import Project feature, which creates and configures a standard project 
for you. Standard projects are easier to maintain in the long term. However, 
the free-form project templates can be useful if you have an existing Ant-based 
project with a complex or idiosyncratic configuration that can not be 
replicated within a standard project. For example, if you are importing a 
project with multiple source roots, each of which has a different classpath, 
and you can not split the source roots into different projects, it might be 
necessary to use a free-form project template.</p> 
<p>This guide focuses on standard projects. For more information on setting up 
free-form projects, seeAdvanced Free-Form Project Configuration. </p> 
<h2>Configuring the Classpath and Other Project Settings</h2> 
<p>This section covers the most common tasks in setting up a project, such as 
setting the project's target JDK, setting the classpath, creating dependencies 
between projects, and sharing libraries between projects and users.</p> 
<h3>Setting the Main Project</h3> 
<p>When you develop a large application consisting of numerous source folders, 
it is common to split up your code into separate projects. Typically, one of 
these projects serves as the entry point for your application. To tell the IDE 
which of your projects is the main entry point for your application, you set 
one project to be the main project. The IDE provides commands that act on the 
main project. For example, running the Clean and Build Main Project command 
builds both the main project and all of its required projects.</p> 
<p><b>To set a project as the main project:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Right-click the project node in the Projects window, and choose Set as 
Main Project.</li> </ul> 
<p>Only one project can be the main project at a time.</p> 
<h3>Setting the Target JDK in a Project</h3> 
<p>In the IDE, you can register multiple Java platforms and attach Javadoc and 
source code to each platform. Switching the target JDK for a standard project 
does the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Offers the new target JDK's classes for code completion.</li> 
<li>If available, displays the target JDK's source code and Javadoc 
documentation.</li> 
<li>Uses the target JDK's executables (<code>javac</code> and <code>java</code>
) to compile and execute your application.</li> 
<li>Compiles your source code against the target JDK's libraries.</li> </ul> 
<p>By default, the IDE uses the version of the Java SE platform (JDK) on which 
the IDE runs as the default Java platform for IDE projects. You can view your 
IDE's JDK version by choosingHelp &gt; About. The JDK version is listed in the 
Java field.</p> 
<p><b>To run the IDE with a different JDK version:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Start the IDE with the following switch from the command line. 
<pre>--jdkhome jdk-home-dir</pre> 
<p>Alternatively, set the JDK in the <code>/etc/netbeans.conf</code> file that 
is located in the IDE's installation folder.</p> </li> </ul> 
<p><b>To register a new Java platform:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose Tools &gt; Java Platforms from the main menu.</li> 
<li>Specify the folder that contains the Java platform as well as the sources 
and Javadoc needed for debugging.</li> </ol> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>To switch the target JDK of a standard project:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li> 
<li>Select the Libraries panel.</li> 
<li>Change the Java Platform property.</li> </ol> 
<h3>Managing a Project's Classpath</h3> 
<p> Adding a group of class files to a project's classpath tells the IDE which 
classes the project should have access to during compilation and execution. The 
IDE also uses classpath settings to enable code completion, automatic 
highlighting of compilation errors, and refactoring. You can edit the classpath 
declarations for an existing project in the Project Properties dialog box.</p> 
<p> In standard Java projects, the IDE maintains separate classpaths for 
compiling and running your project, as well as compiling and running JUnit 
tests (for Java SE applications). The IDE automatically adds everything on your 
project's compilation classpath to the project's runtime classpath.</p> 
<p><b>You can modify your project's classpath in either of the following ways:
</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Right-click the project's node, choose Properties, select the Libraries 
category, and modify the listed classpath entries.</li> 
<li>Right-click the Libraries node in the Projects window and choose Add 
Project, Add Library, or Add JAR/Folder.</li> </ul> 
<p> If you have attached Javadoc and source files to a JAR file in the Library 
Manager, the IDE automatically adds the Javadoc and source files to the project 
when you register the JAR file on a project's classpath. You can step into 
classes and look up Javadoc pages for the classes without configuring anything 
else.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Managing Dependencies Between Projects</h3> 
<p> If your application consists of multiple projects, you have to set up the 
classpath dependencies between the projects. Typically you set up one main 
project containing the project main class (in Java SE projects), and several 
required projects. A required project is a project that has been added to 
another project's classpath. When you clean and build a project, the IDE also 
cleans and builds its required projects. The required project's Javadoc and 
sources are also made available to the receiving project.</p> 
<p> You can add any required projects to your project by right-clicking the 
Libraries node in the Projects window, or you can add them by specifying them 
in the Libraries tab in the Project Properties dialog box. When you want to add 
a required project, select the project folder whose JAR files you want to add 
to the classpath (the file chooser displays the icon for IDE project folders ( 
). When adding projects in the Project Properties dialog box, make sure that 
the Build Projects on Classpath checkbox is selected.</p> 
<p> If you want to add a free-form project to the classpath of a standard 
project, you have to add the free-form project's JAR file to the standard 
project's classpath. To do this, you must first declare all of the free-form 
project's output files in the Output panel of the free-form project's Project 
Properties dialog box.</p> 
<h3>Sharing Project Libraries</h3> 
<p>As the NetBeans IDE project system is Ant-based, NetBeans projects are 
already generally portable between different users, whether or not they use the 
IDE. However, by default, the project build script's way of referring to 
libraries is dependent on factors specific to each user, particularly in the 
case of libraries defined in the Library Manager dialog box.</p> 
<p>For example, normally you can put a project in a zip file and give it to 
another user to unpack and run. But if the project depends on a custom library 
that you have specified in the Libraries Manager dialog box, others might 
initially have problems building the project because of unresolved references 
to the custom library.</p> 
<p>Another potential inconvenience is that libraries are stored in a variety 
of locations, based on where they originate. Libraries that come with the IDE 
are stored in various different folders within the IDE's installation. Examples 
of these include the libraries for the Swing Layout Extensions, beans binding, 
and database drivers.</p> 
<p>To solve these problems, you can specify a dedicated folder for project 
libraries. Furthermore, you have control over whether to use an relative path 
or an absolute path when referring to these libraries.</p> 
<p>This flexibility makes it easier for you to handle the following situations:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You create a project and need to make it available and buildable to other 
users, whether they use the IDE or not. They should be able to access the 
project through a version control checkout or by unpacking a zip file that you 
have provided them. Then they should be able build the application without 
extra configuration.</li> 
<li>You must start working on an existing project and adhere to a strict set 
of conventions concerning where project libraries are stored (and whether your 
build script accesses them with a relative reference or absolute reference).
</li> </ul> 
<p>You can set a dedicated libraries folder for standard Java SE, Web, and 
Enterprise projects. You can set the libraries folder when you create the 
project (in the New Project wizard) or afterwards in the Libraries tab of the 
Project Properties dialog box.</p> 
<p><b>To make a general Java project's libraries sharable upon project 
creation:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose File &gt; New Project.</li> 
<li>In the Java category of the wizard, select one of the standard templates. 
Then click Next.</li> 
<li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, select the Use Dedicated 
Folder for Sharing Libraries checkbox.</li> 
<li>In the Libraries Folder field, select the location for the libraries to be 
stored.
<p>If the libraries are already included in the IDE, those libraries will be 
copied to the folder that you have designated.</p> </li> </ol> 
<p><b>To make a web or Java EE project's libraries sharable upon project 
creation:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose File &gt; New Project.</li> 
<li>In the Web category of the wizard, select one of the standard templates. 
Then click Next.</li> 
<li>In the Name and Location page of the wizard, select the Use Dedicated 
Folder for Sharing Libraries checkbox.</li> 
<li>In the Libraries Folder field, select the location for the libraries to be 
stored.
<p>If the libraries are already included in the IDE, those libraries will be 
copied to the folder that you have designated.</p></li> </ol> 
<p><b>To make an existing project's libraries sharable:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li> 
<li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Libraries node.</li> 
<li>In the Libraries panel, click Browse to open the New Libraries Folder 
wizard.</li> 
<li>In the Library Folder page of the wizard, enter a location for the 
libraries and click Next.<br>
You can enter the location as a relative 
reference or an absolute reference.</li> 
<li>In the Actions panel of the wizard, verify the selected action for each 
listed library. In most cases, the IDE detects the most appropriate action for 
that library.
<p>The following actions are available:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Copy Library JAR Files to New Libraries Folder.</b> Use this option if 
the library is not in the folder that you have selected and you want to have 
the library JAR files placed there.</li> 
<li><b>Use Relative Path to Library JAR Files.</b> Use this option if the 
library is not in the libraries folder and you need to access the library in 
its existing location using a relative path. An entry with a relative reference 
is added for the library in the libraries folder'snblibraries.properties file.
</li> 
<li><b>Use Absolute Path to Library JAR Files.</b> Use this option if the 
library is not in the libraries folder and you need to access the library in 
its existing location using an absolute path. An entry with an absolute 
reference is added for the library in the libraries folder's
nblibraries.properties file.</li> 
<li><b>Use Existing Library in Libraries Folder.</b> Use this option if there 
is already a copy of the library in the libraries folder and you want to use 
that copy of the library.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Click Finish to exit the Make Project Sharable wizard.</li> 
<li>Click OK to exit the Project Properties dialog box.</li> </ol> 
<p><b>Note:</b> You can also use the Libraries node of the Project Properties 
dialog box to change the location of the libraries folder. If you have already 
specified a libraries folder, clicking Browse opens a file chooser instead of 
the New Libraries Folder wizard.</p> 
<h3>Making the Javadoc Available in the IDE </h3> 
<p>To view the JavaSE API documentation in the NetBeans IDE, use the Source 
&gt;Show Documentation command or choose Window &gt; Other &gt; Javadoc from 
the main menu to view API documentation in a separate window.</p> 
<p>However, for some third-party libraries, API documentation is not 
available. In these cases, the Javadoc resources must be manually associated 
with the IDE.</p> 
<p><b>To make the Javadoc API documentation available for the Show Javadoc 
command:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Download the Javadoc API documentation source.</li> 
<li>Choose Tools &gt; Libraries.</li> 
<li>In the Libraries list, select the library that your project is using.</li> 
<li>Click the Javadoc tab.</li> 
<li>Click the Add ZIP/Folder button and navigate to the zip file or the folder 
that contains the Javadoc API documentation on your system. Select the zip file 
or the folder and click the Add ZIP/Folder button.</li> 
<li>Click OK.</li> </ol> 
<h3>Enabling Java Web Start for the Application </h3> 
<p>You can configure your application to run through Java Web Start in the 
IDE. For this, use the Java Web Start category in the Project Properties 
window. For detailed information on how to enable Java Web Start, refer to the 
tutorialEnabling Java Web Start in the NetBeans IDE.</p> 
<p><b>To configure Java Web Start for the application:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li> 
<li>In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Application &gt; Web Start
 node.</li> 
<li>Select the Enable Web Start checkbox and configure Java Web Start settings 
as explained inEnabling Java Web Start in the NetBeans IDE.</li> </ol> 
<h2>Building Applications</h2> 
<p> This section explains how to build standard projects in the IDE, how to do 
basic customizations to the build process, and how to handle compilation errors.
</p> 
<h3>Building Projects, Packages, and Files</h3> 
<p>Compilation in the IDE is simple. Assuming that your project's compilation 
classpath is set correctly, you need only select the project, package, or file 
that you want to compile and choose the appropriate Build or Compile command 
from the Run menu. The IDE then compiles the files.</p> 
<p>If the Compile on Save feature is enabled for a Java project (or the Deploy 
on Save feature is enabled for a Java web or enterprise project), the IDE 
compiles your files automatically when you save them. SeeCompile on Save below 
for more information.</p> 
<p><b>To build your application for deployment:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Choose Run &gt; Clean and Build Project. 
<p>Any previously compiled files and distributable outputs such as JAR files 
are deleted. Then the files are recompiled and new outputs are produced. A<code>
build</code> folder is created to hold the compiled classes. A <code>dist</code>
 is generated to contain distributable outputs such as JAR files and Javadoc 
documentation. You can see the build outputs by opening the Files window.</p>
</li> </ul> 
<p>Whenever you invoke compile commands, the IDE displays the output including 
any compilation errors encountered in the Output window, as described inFixing 
Compilation Errors below.</p> 
<h3>Compile on Save</h3> 
<p>The IDE's Compile on Save feature enables you to save time when you are 
running and debugging projects in the IDE. When the Compile on Save feature is 
enabled for a project, files are compiled when you save them. The compiled 
files are stored in a cache that the IDE uses when you run, test, debug, and 
profile the project in the IDE. This enables you to test and debug your 
application without having to wait for the application to be built first.</p> 
<p>When enabled, the Compile on Save feature has the following effects:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The IDE compiles your files as you save them so that your project is 
always ready to run or debug in the IDE.</li> 
<li>The Build command is disabled. If you want to rebuild the JAR file without 
having to use the Clean and Build command, you need to disable the Save on 
Compile feature.</li> 
<li>The project's Ant script is not used when you use Run, Debug, Profile, or 
Test commands. If you have customized your build script for any of these 
commands, those customizations will be disregarded.</li> 
<li>The JAR file that is built from the project is <i>not</i> kept up to date 
when you save changes to your files. If you want to build or rebuild the JAR 
file, you need to use the Clean and Build command. The Clean and Build command 
always uses your project's Ant script, whether or not Compile on Save is 
enabled.</li> </ul> 
<p>By default, Compile on Save is enabled for new projects that you create. 
For existing projects, Compile on Save is turned off.</p> 
<p><b>To enable or disable Compile on Save for a Java project:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li> 
<li>Select the Compiling node and set the Compile on Save property.</li> </ol> 
<p>Similarly, the IDE has a Deploy on Save feature for Java web and enterprise 
applications. When the Deploy on Save feature is enabled for a project and a 
project has been deployed to a server through the IDE, changed files are 
redeployed to the server immediately. For Deploy on Save to work on GlassFish 
V2, the Glassfish instance must have the Directory Deployment Enabled option 
selected.</p> 
<p><b>To enable or disable Deploy on Save for a Java web or enterprise project:
</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Right-click the project's node and choose Properties.</li> 
<li>Select the Run node and set the Deploy on Save property.</li> </ol> 
<p><b>To enable directory deployment Glassfish V2:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose Tools &gt; Servers.</li> 
<li>Select the server.</li> 
<li>Select the Options tab.</li> 
<li>Select the Directory Deployment Enabled option.</li> </ol> 
<h3>Fixing Compilation Errors</h3> 
<p> The IDE displays output messages and any compilation errors in the Output 
Window. This multi-tabbed window is displayed automatically whenever you 
generate compilation errors, debug your program, generate Javadoc 
documentation, and so on. You can also open this window manually by choosing 
Window &gt; Output (Ctrl-4 on Windows/Cmd-4 on Mac OS X).</p> 
<p>In addition, compilation errors are shown in the Tasks window and marked in 
the Source Editor.</p> 
<p> One important function of the Output window is to notify you of errors 
found while compiling your program. The error message is displayed in blue 
underlined text and is linked to the line in the source code that caused the 
error, as illustrated in the image below. The Output window also provides links 
to errors found when running Ant build scripts. Whenever you click an error 
link in the Output window, the Source Editor jumps to the line containing the 
error automatically.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Every action that is run by an Ant script, such as compiling, running, and 
debugging files, sends its output to the same Output window tab. If you need to 
save the messages displayed in the Output window, you can copy and paste it to 
a separate file. You can also set Ant to print the command output for each new 
target to a new Output window tab by choosing Tools &gt; Options, selecting the 
Miscellaneous category, clicking the Ant tab, and deselecting the checkbox for 
the Reuse Output Tabs from Finished Processes property.</p> 
<h3>Filtering Output Files</h3> 
<p> When you create a JAR file or a WAR file, you usually want to include just 
the compiled<code>.class</code> files and any other resource files located in 
your source directory, such as resource bundles or XML documents. The default 
filter does this for you by excluding all<code>.java</code>, <code>.nbattrs
</code>, and <code>.form</code> files from your output file.</p> 
<p> You can create additional filters using regular expressions to control the 
Output files. To specify which files to exclude, right-click your project in 
the Projects window and choose Properties to open the Project Properties dialog 
box. In the left pane, click on Packaging. In the right pane, enter regular 
expressions in the text box to specify the files to exclude when packaging the 
JAR or WAR files. In addition to the default expressions, here are some 
additional regular expressions you can use:</p> Regular Expression Description 
<br> <code>\.html$ </code> Exclude all HTML files <br>
<code>\.java$ </code> 
Exclude all Java files <br>
<code>(\.html$)|(\.java$) </code> Exclude all HTML 
and Java files <br>
<code>(Key)|(\.gif$) </code> Exclude all GIF files and any 
files with<code>Key</code> in their name <br>
<br>

<p> For a guide to regular expression syntax, see jakarta.apache.org.</p> 
<h2>Running Applications</h2> 
<p>This section shows you how to run projects in the IDE and how to configure 
the project's main class, runtime arguments, VM arguments, and the working 
directory.</p> 
<h3>Running Projects and Files</h3> 
<p>For Java projects, you typically set the project that contains the 
program's main class as the main project. For web projects, the main project is 
the project that is first deployed. To run a project, package, or file, choose 
one of the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In the main menu, choose Run &gt; Run Main Project (F6) to run the main 
project. Alternatively, you can use the Run Main Project button in the toolbar.
</li> 
<li>In the Projects window, right-click the project and choose Run to run a 
project. Note that for Java projects, the project must have a main class.</li> 
<li>In the Projects window, right-click the file and choose Run File 
(Shift+F6) to run a file. Alternatively, chooseRun &gt; Run File &gt; Run 
filename (Shift+F6) in the main menu to run a runnable class. </li> </ul> 
<p>When you run the project the IDE displays any compilation errors and output 
in the Output window. For more, seeFixing Compilation Errors.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> If Compile on Save is enabled for a project, the Run Project 
command operates on class files that have been created when you have saved 
those files. The Ant build script is not used. If you have defined custom steps 
in the build script, those steps are not followed. If you would like the full 
build process to occur when you use Run Project, Debug Project, and Profile 
Project, disableCompile on Save. </p> 
<h3>Customizing Runtime Options</h3> 
<p>By default, the IDE does not specify a main class, runtime arguments, or 
JVM arguments. The runtime classpath of each standard project contains the 
project's compiled classes and everything in the project's compilation 
classpath. You can view the project's compilation classpath by opening the 
Project Properties dialog box and selecting the Libraries node in the 
Categories pane and then clicking the Compile tab in the right pane.</p> 
<p>To change project runtime options, open the Project Properties dialog box 
by right-clicking the project node in the Projects window and choosing 
Properties. Next, select the Libraries node in the Categories pane and click 
the Run tab in the right pane of the dialog box. Note that to access settings 
for the main class, program arguments, the working directory for program 
execution and VM options, you have to select the Run node. In the next section 
we'll take a closer look at how to configure the runtime classpath.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Setting the Runtime Classpath</h3> 
<p>To add projects, libraries, JAR files, and folders to the project's runtime 
classpath, use the buttons on the right side of the Run-time Libraries list in 
the Project Properties dialog box.</p> 
<p>If your project uses special libraries dynamically at runtime through an 
indirect interface or reflection (like JDBC drivers or JAXP implementations), 
you have to add these libraries to the runtime classpath. You also have to 
adjust your runtime classpath if the runtime dependencies between your projects 
do not match the compilation dependencies between the projects. For example, 
imagine that project A compiles against project B, and project B compiles 
against project C, but project A does not compile against project C. This means 
that project A only has project B on its runtime classpath. If project A 
requires both project B and project C during execution, you have to add project 
C to project A's runtime classpath.</p> 
<h3>Setting the Main Class and Runtime Arguments</h3> 
<p>To set the project's main class, select the Run node in the Categories pane 
of the Project Properties dialog box and type the fully-qualified name in the 
Main Class field (for example,<code>org.myCompany.myLib.MyLibClass</code>). The 
main class must exist in the project or in one of the JAR files or libraries in 
the project's runtime classpath. Afterwards, type any necessary runtime 
arguments in the Arguments field.</p> 
<p>If you use the Browse button to choose the project main class, the file 
chooser only shows classes in your project source directory. If you want to 
specify a class in one the libraries on the classpath, you have to type the 
fully-qualified name of the class in the Main Class field.</p> 
<h3>Setting JVM Arguments</h3> 
<p>You can specify JVM arguments for the project in the Project Properties 
dialog box. Open the Project Properties dialog box and click Run in the 
Categories pane and then type a space-separated list of JVM arguments in the VM 
Options field.</p> 
<p>You can set system properties by typing the following in the VM Options 
field:</p> 
<pre>-Dname=value</pre> 
<h2>Customizing the Build Script</h2> 
<p>In standard projects the IDE generates the build script based on the 
options you enter in the New Project wizard and the project's Project 
Properties dialog box. You can set all the basic compilation and runtime 
options in the project's Project Properties dialog box and the IDE 
automatically updates your project's Ant script. If you have additional 
requirements for the build process that can not be handled in the Project 
Properties dialog box, you can modify the build script directly.</p> 
<p>The main Ant script for a standard project is <code>build.xml</code>. The 
IDE calls targets in<code>build.xml</code> whenever you run IDE commands. This 
file contains an import statement that imports<code>nbproject/build-impl.xml
</code>, which contains build targets that are generated by the IDE. In <code>
build.xml</code>, you can override any of the targets from <code>
nbproject/build-impl.xml</code> or write new targets. Do <i>not</i> edit <code>
nbproject/build-impl.xml</code> directly, because that file is regenerated 
based on changes that you make in the Project Properties dialog box.</p> 
<p>In addition, the build script uses the <code>nbproject/project.properties
</code> which you can edit manually.</p> 
<p>With standard projects, you can customize the build process by doing any of 
the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Entering basic options, like classpath settings and JAR filters, in the 
New Project wizard when you create a project, or afterwards in the Project 
Properties dialog box.</li> 
<li>Editing properties in <code>nbproject/project.properties</code>. This file 
stores Ant properties with important information about your project, such as 
the location of your source and output folders. You can override the properties 
in this file. Be careful when editing this file. For example, the output folder 
is deleted every time you clean your project. You should therefore never set 
the output folder to the same location as your source folder without first 
configuring the clean target to not delete the output folder.</li> 
<li>Customizing existing or creating new Ant targets by doing any of the 
following:
<ul> 
<li>Add instructions to be processed before or after an Ant target is run. 
Each of the main targets in<code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code> also has a 
<code>-pre</code> and <code>-post</code> target that you can override in <code>
build.xml</code>. For example, to get RMI working with regular projects, type 
the following in<code>build.xml</code>: 
<pre>&lt;target name=&quot;-post-compile&quot;&gt; &lt;rmic 
base=&quot;${build.classes.dir}&quot; 
includes=&quot;**/Remote*.class&quot;/&gt; &lt;/target&gt;</pre></li> 
<li>Change the instructions in an Ant target. Copy the target from <code>
nbproject/build-impl.xml</code> to <code>build.xml</code> and make any changes 
to the target.</li> 
<li>Create new targets in <code>build.xml</code>. You can also add the new 
target to the dependencies of any of the IDE's existing targets. Override the 
existing target in<code>build.xml</code> and then add the new target to the 
existing target's<code>depends</code> property. For example, the following adds 
the<code>new-target</code> target to the run target's dependencies: 
<pre>&lt;target name=&quot;new-target&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- target body... --&gt; 
&lt;/new-target&gt; &nbsp; &lt;target name=&quot;run&quot; 
depends=&quot;new-target,myprojname-impl.run&quot;/&gt;</pre> 
<p>You do not need to copy the body of the run target into <code>build.xml
</code>.</p> </li> </ul></li> </ul> 
<p>The following table lists some common tasks for redefining a JAR file that 
you may find useful:</p> To perform this task Follow these steps <br>
Specify 
which files are added to a JAR file. Right-click the project node in the 
Projects window and choose Properties. Click the Packaging subnode (under 
Build) and configure the filter and compression settings using the Exclude from 
JAR File field. For more, seeFiltering Output Files <br>
Change a JAR file's 
name and location. In the Files window, double-click the project's <code>
nbproject/project.properties</code> file to open it in the Source Editor. Enter 
the full path to the JAR file in the<code>dist.jar</code> property. <br>

Specify the manifest file for a JAR file. In <code>project.properties</code>, 
type the name of the manifest file in the<code>manifest.file</code> property. 
The file name must be specified relative to the project's<code>build.xml</code> 
file. Note that if you are using the Java Application template, the IDE creates 
a manifest file for you. <br>
Disable the generation of a JAR file for a 
project. In the Files window, open your project folder and open <code>build.xml
</code>. Override the <code>jar</code> target to have no contents and no 
dependencies. For example, add the following to<code>build.xml</code>: 
<pre>&lt;target name=&quot;jar&quot; /&gt;</pre> <br>
<br>

<p>If you are looking for resources on learning Ant, see 
http://ant.apache.org/resources.html. You can also install the Ant manual into 
the IDE help system by using the Plugins Manager. Choose Tools &gt; Plugins and 
install the Ant Documentation module.</p> 
<h3>Editing and Running Ant Scripts</h3> 
<p>The IDE automatically recognizes Ant scripts and displays them as Ant 
script nodes ( ) rather than as normal XML files. You can right-click Ant 
scripts in the Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window to access a 
pop-up menu of commands. You can also expand the Ant script node to see an 
alphabetical list of subnodes representing the Ant script's targets. Each of 
these subnodes also has a popup menu of commands.</p> 
<p>In the Projects, Files, and Favorites windows, an Ant script's subnodes are 
flagged in the following ways:</p> Icon Meaning <br>

<p><b>Emphasized Ant target.</b> These targets include a description 
attribute, which is displayed as a tooltip. You define the target's description 
attribute in the Source Editor.</p> <br>
<b>Normal Ant target.</b> A target 
without a description attribute. <br>
<br>

<p>Double-click any of the Ant script's subnodes to jump to that target's 
location in the Source Editor. All of the normal XML search tools, selection 
tools, and keyboard shortcuts are available for editing Ant scripts, and the 
IDE provides code completion for all standard Ant tasks.</p> 
<p> When you create a target that you want to run from the command line, give 
the target a description attribute. Then, if you forget the names of the 
targets or what they do, you can run the ant<code>-projecthelp &lt;script&gt;
</code> command from the command line. With this command, Ant lists only those 
targets that have a description attribute, together with their descriptions. 
Especially when there are many targets in your Ant build script, emphasizing 
some and de-emphasizing others can be a useful way to distinguish between those 
that you use a lot and those that you use less often.</p> 
<p>The font style of a subnode's label in the Projects, Files, and Favorites 
windows indicates the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Normal.</b> A target that is defined within the current Ant script.</li>
<li><b>Italics.</b> A target that is imported from another Ant script.</li> 
<li><b>Greyed out.</b> An internal target that cannot be run directly. 
Internal targets have names beginning with '-'.</li> 
<li><b>Bold.</b> The default target for the script, if there is one. The 
default target is declared as an attribute of the project, together with other 
project attributes, such as its name. You define the project's default 
attribute in the Source Editor.</li> </ul> 
<p>Targets that are imported from another script but are overridden in the 
importing script are not listed. Only the overriding target is listed.</p> 
<p>You can run targets in an Ant script from the Ant script's node in the 
Projects window, Files window, or Favorites window. To do so, right-click the 
Ant script node and choose a target from the Run Target submenu. Targets are 
sorted alphabetically. Only emphasized targets are listed. Choose Other Targets 
to run a target that has not been emphasized with a description attribute. 
Internal targets are excluded from these lists because they cannot be run 
independently.</p> 
<p>Instead of running a target by using the Ant script node's popup menu, you 
can simply right-click the target's node and choose Run Target.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Writing Custom Ant Tasks</h3> 
<p>You can use custom Ant tasks to expand on the functionality provided by 
Ant's built-in tasks. Custom tasks are often used to define properties, create 
nested elements, or write text directly between tags using the<code>addText
</code> method.</p> 
<p><b>To create a custom Ant task in the IDE:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Right-click the package where you would like to place the task and choose 
New &gt; Other.</li> 
<li>Select the Other category and the Custom Ant Task file type.</li> 
<li>Complete the wizard.</li> </ol> 
<p>When you create the custom Ant task file, the template opens in the Source 
Editor. The template contains sample code for many of the common operations 
performed by Ant tasks. After each section of code, the template also shows you 
how to use the task in an Ant script.</p> <br>
