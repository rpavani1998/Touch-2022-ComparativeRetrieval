<p> My name is Jean-Baptiste Jung and I&rsquo;m a 29 years old web developer 
and professional blogger. I was born and raised in Paris, France and I now live 
in Belgium with my wife and our adorable cat. I first used the internet in 
1998, built my first website in 2001 and finally started to work as a 
professional web developer in 2005. In 2010, I left my job and created my own 
web development studio. jb is a DZone MVB and is not an employee of DZone and

<p>Nowadays, most websites and web applications are database driven, which 
means that you, the developer, have to query the database to get the requested 
information. Let&rsquo;s take a look at a very useful tool to handle SQL 
queries easily and efficiently on small to medium projects.</p> 
<h2>What&rsquo;s ezSQL, and why it is useful</h2> 
<p>On big projects, the usual good practice is to use a CMS or a framework 
such as Symfony or CodeIgniter to build your site on. But on smaller projects, 
many developers are still using PHP functions such as mysql_query() to do SQL 
queries to the database.</p> 
<p>While it&rsquo;s functional, I do not recommend to use all those mysql_XXX 
functions: Most websites are using MySQL, that&rsquo;s right, but if one day 
you have to deal with another DB like PostGres or Oracle&hellip; Your code will 
not work at all, and you&rsquo;ll have to rewrite it. Scary, isn&rsquo;t it? 
This is why is it recommended to use a<em>database abstraction layer</em>, an 
API which unifies the communication between your application/website and 
databases such as MySQL, Oracle or PostgreSQL.</p> 
<p>As you can guess, ezSQL allows you to work with various databases very 
easily. Though, please note that it does not support differences in SQL syntax 
implementations among different databases.</p> 
<p>Also, ezSQL provide a few methods which simplify queries to the database, 
and help producing a cleaner code.</p> 
<h2>ezSQL and WordPress</h2> 
<p>As most of you are familiar with WordPress, you probably know the wpdb 
class, which allows you to send queries to the database. As&nbsp;wpdb is based 
on ezSQL, and you&rsquo;re already familiar with the WordPress class, you 
won&rsquo;t have any trouble to learn using ezSQL. And don&rsquo;t worry if you 
never heard of WordPress or the wpdb class. ezSQL is extremely easy to learn 
and to use.</p> 
<h2>Downloading and installing ezSQL</h2> 
<p>Right, I have talked too much. How about some coding now? Let start by 
grabbing your copy of ezSQL. Once you have it, unzip on your server (or hard 
drive).</p> 
<p>In order to be able to use ezSQL in your projects, you have to include two 
files: The first is ez_sql_core.php, which is ezSQL core file. The second 
depends on the database you&rsquo;re going to use. In order to use ezSQL with a 
MySQL database, you have to include ez_sql_mysql.php.</p> 
<p>Once done, you have to create a ezSQL object. This is done easily using 
your database username, password, name and host. The following example 
demonstrates the inclusion of the required files and the creation of a ezSQL 
object:</p> 
<pre>include_once &quot;../shared/ez_sql_core.php&quot;; include_once 
&quot;ez_sql_mysql.php&quot;; $db = new 
ezSQL_mysql('db_user','db_password','db_name','db_host');</pre> 
<p>Now, you have an object called $db. We&rsquo;ll use it run any types of 
queries to our database.</p> 
<h2>Queries examples</h2> 
<p>ezSQL has a few methods to make SQL queries extremely simple. Let&rsquo;s 
see what you can do with it:</p> 
<h3>Execute any query</h3> 
<p>In order to insert, delete or most generally, run any kind of query to the 
database, we have to use the query method. In case of a data insertion, the 
method will return the insert id.</p> 
<pre>$db-&gt;query(&quot;INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (NULL,'The 
Cat','cat@google.com')&quot;);</pre> 
<p>Example of an update query:</p> 
<pre>$db-&gt;query(&quot;UPDATE users SET name = 'Patrick' WHERE id = 4&quot;);
</pre> 
<h3>Select a row</h3> 
<p>The get_row method is great if you just need to select a row from your 
database. The example below executes a simple select query and displays the 
results.</p> 
<pre>$user = $db-&gt;get_row(&quot;SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id = 
4&quot;); echo $user-&gt;name; echo $user-&gt;email;</pre> 
<h3>Select a single variable</h3> 
<p>If you only need a variable, the get_var method is here to help. Using it 
is extremely simple as shown below.</p> 
<pre>$var = $db-&gt;get_var(&quot;SELECT count(*) FROM users&quot;); echo $var;
</pre> 
<h3>Select multiple results</h3> 
<p>Although the methods documented above are quite useful, most of the time 
you&rsquo;ll need to get various rows of data from your database. The method 
called get_results will get various data from your database. To output the 
data, a simple foreach() loop is all you need.</p> 
<pre>$results = $db-&gt;get_results(&quot;SELECT name, email FROM 
users&quot;); foreach ( $results as $user ) { echo $user-&gt;name; echo 
$user-&gt;email; }</pre> 
<h3>Select a column</h3> 
<p>If you need to get a column, you can use the get_col method. The second 
parameter is the column offset.</p> 
<pre>foreach ( $db-&gt;get_col(&quot;SELECT name,email FROM users&quot;,0) as 
$name ) { echo $name; }</pre> 
<h3>Debug</h3> 
<p>When something doesn&rsquo;t work as expected, ezSQL has a great method to 
perform some debugging. Not surprising, the method is called debug. When 
called, the method will display the last query performed and its associated 
results.</p> 
<pre>$db-&gt;debug();</pre> 
<p>I hope you enjoyed this article and that you&rsquo;ll use ezSQL in your 
future projects. It&rsquo;s a great tool which was very helpful for me many 
times!<br>

<p>Fast and easy? Retarded is more like it.</p> 
<p>This class is the reason WP had so many SQL exploits over the years. It 
follows the very dated manual escaping methodology. Why anyone would use a 
library without placeholder or bound parameter support is beyond me. That's not 
exactly easier to use.</p>

<p>Everyone wants SQL to be easy, and indeed this script does seem like an 
easy way to avoid having to change your SQL function calls if you change 
databases. But that&rsquo;s it.</p> 
<p>ezSQL does not offer any way to parameterize your queries &ndash; or indeed 
to protect your queries from SQL injection at all &mdash; least of all in a 
system-portable fashion.</p>
