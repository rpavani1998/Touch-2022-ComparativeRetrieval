<h1>Eclipse -- more than just an IDE</h1> 
<p> Jul 3rd, 2005 </p> 2005, eclipse <br>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to give a talk on the Eclipse Framework and 
how it hangs together. I&rsquo;m also writing a book on the subject; and 
although O&rsquo;Reilly originally expressed an idea in the book, it&rsquo;s 
still awaiting a publisher to take the title. It will probably be released 
under the Creative Commons license in the future.</p> 
<p>What is amusing about the Eclipse versus NetBeans debate is that most 
people still think of Eclipse as a Java Development Environment, and compare it 
to NetBeans on that footing. Well, Eclipse as a framework is much larger than 
Eclipse as a developer environment, although the latter is more well-known. 
Just reading posts on some of theEclipse websites and plugin directories, you 
get the feeling that there is a large community working within the platform, 
not just the Java IDE.</p> 
<p>I think this post sums up the point nicely: &ldquo;Eclipse is not just an 
IDE that competes with NetBeans &hellip; Eclipse is a complete development 
platform that makes large parts of Java irrelevant.&rdquo; Sun have never 
really quite &lsquo;got&rsquo; Java as an application development language; 
although it is a very powerful programming language. Frameworks are what made 
Smalltalk popular; what makes coding in Mac OS X easy; and are the holy grail 
of reuse and patterns books around. Java just provides a low-level layer to 
provide simplistic access; for example, theURL class provides basic access, 
whilst Jakarta&rsquo;sHttpClient provides a framework for building HTTP 
applications andHttpServlet provides basic web interaction, whilst Struts 
provides a framework for building web-based applications.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s probably better that Sun don&rsquo;t control frameworks though, 
because there&rsquo;s not a lot of evidence that up-front thought that happens. 
Consider theDate class, which returns years since 1900, or the fact that 
we&rsquo;ve got basically two of the same interfaces inIterator and Enumeration 
(and the ability to remove an object whilst traversing it is a bastardisation 
of the interface anyway; we could have equally had a sub-interface called 
&lsquo;RemovableEnumeration&rsquo; that added that specific functionality if 
required). Or the fact that since 1.1, Java has a buggered threading model that 
processes theEventQueue resulting in all GUIs having to be killed with 
System.exit(). (Interesting note; they actually have apologetic documentation 
that describes this broken behaviour, and bug4030718 that I was vehement about 
when 1.1 was broken; even to the extent that I wrote a patcher class that 
patched the classes.zip to show that this behaviour could be unbroken in time 
for the 1.2 release; in 1.4, they&rsquo;ve finally marked it as closed.) By the 
way, another reason why SWT rocks is that they allow you to write your own 
threading for event handling; it&rsquo;s why moststandalone SWT apps have:</p> 
SWT Event loop <br>

<pre>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 </pre> 
<pre><code>public static void main (String [] args) { Display display = new 
Display (); Shell shell = new Shell (display); shell.open (); // start the 
event loop. We stop when the user has done // something to dispose our window. 
while (!shell.isDisposed ()) { if (!display.readAndDispatch ()) display.sleep 
(); } display.dispose (); } </code></pre> <br>
<br>

<p>This allows the programmer to have fine-grain control over the thread, and 
whilst this is single-threaded, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. They even 
acknowledge this:</p> 
<blockquote> <em> Note: The most common threading model for an SWT application 
is to run a single UI thread and perform long operations in computational 
threads. However, SWT does not restrict developers to this model. An 
application could run multiple UI-threads with a separate event loop in each 
thread.</em> </blockquote> 
<p>In any case, the reason why people are excited about the Eclipse framework 
is that they are interested in what you can do with theplatform, not just how 
good the IDE is. You only need to see the growing list ofrich client 
applications to see that the momentum is gaining speed. And the best news of 
all is that the guidance of the platform and RCPs is a meritorium controlled by 
the open Eclipse organisation, so anyone can participate and guide the future; 
not just by JSRs.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve started  www.rcpapps.org  to provide a set of examples on how to 
write RCP applications, and how you can design and build applications that take 
advantage of all that the Eclipse frameworks have to offer.</p>
