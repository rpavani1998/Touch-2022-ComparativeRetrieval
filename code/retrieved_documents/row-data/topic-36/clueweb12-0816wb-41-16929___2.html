<h4>The Java Evolution Mismatch: Why You Need a Better JVM</h4> 
<h4>Migrating to FUSE Mediation Router</h4> 
<h4>Configuring and Running FUSE ESB</h4> 
<h4>Implementing Enterprise Integration Patterns</h4> More revealing 
statements have finally surfaced about Oracle's future plans for popular Java 
tools.&nbsp; Oracle recently updated itsFAQ on the future of Sun 
technologies.&nbsp; Glassfish, OpenOffice, NetBeans and VirtualBox were just 
some of the items mentioned.&nbsp; Here are some specifics on each project:<br>

<strong><br>
NetBeans</strong> <br>
Oracle intends to provide NetBeans as an 
&quot;additional open source option&quot; to complement JDeveloper and Oracle 
Enterprise Pack for Eclipse.&nbsp; Oracle makes it clear however, that 
JDeveloper is still &quot;Oracle's strategic development tool&quot; for Oracle 
Fusion and future enterprise applications.&nbsp; Oracle says that JDeveloper, 
Enterprise Pack, and NetBeans will all be options &quot;for pure Java and Java 
EE development.&quot;<br>
<br>
<strong>GlassFish</strong> <br>
Oracle says it 
will &quot;invest in aligning common infrastructure components and 
innovations&quot; between Oracle WebLogic server and GlassFish.&nbsp; They plan 
to continue the development of GlassFish Enterprise Server as the open source 
RI of Java EE specifications.&nbsp; Oracle says it will actively support the 
GlassFish community.<br>
<br>
<strong>Virtualization Products</strong> <br>

Oracle &quot;expects&quot; to continue Sun's desktop virtualization 
products.&nbsp; They include VDI, Secure Global Desktop, Sun Ray, and 
VirtualBox.<br>
<br>
<strong>Open Office</strong> <br>
Oracle will 
&quot;continue developing and supporting OpenOffice as open source.&quot;&nbsp; 
A commercial license for OpenOffice will also be available to customers that 
require enterprise level support and tools.<br>
<br>
The plans for SPARC, 
Solaris, and MySQL are justreiterations of announcements made at Oracle 
OpenWorld.&nbsp; Oracle puts a disclaimer in the FAQ saying that this document 
is not a binding statement however, it is the first news we've heard on the 
fate of several popular Sun technologies.<br>

OtengiM</h3> From the cited document: &quot;Delivering increased investment and 
innovation in Java
<p> Oracle plans to accelerate investment in the Java platform for the benefit 
of customers and the Java community. Java is one of the computer 
industry&rsquo;s best-known brands and the Java platform is one of the 
industry&rsquo;s most widely deployed technologies. Oracle has been a leader in 
the Java community since the inception of the Java programming language and 
already has the world&rsquo;s largest investment in the Java platform, which 
provides the foundation for its Oracle Fusion Middleware products and its 
next-generation enterprise applications. Oracle plans to not only broaden and 
accelerate its own investment in the Java platform, but also plans to increase 
the commitment to the community that helps make Java an ubiquitous, innovative 
platform unified around open standards.&quot;</p>

<p>I hope I'm wrong, but I am afraid this will only last (most likely) till 
the first quarter when Oracle fails to meet financial expectations. Cuts wil 
have to follow and guess who will be up first. That's just how it works. Oracle 
can't maintain 2 or 3 competing product lines (and I can only imagine the 
amount of internal politics between JDeveloper and NetBeans teams, Glassfish vs 
Weblogic teams, etc).</p> 
<p>That's why I've been wary of relying on Sun's open source product lines 
(afraid all the funding for them would dry up sooner or later), preferring 
instead OSS competitors that have proven to be successful on their own (Jetty, 
Spring, Eclipse, etc.).</p>

<p>I see this aquisition as highly anticompetitive if allowed to take place. 
</p> 
<p>As a Netbeans user, tell me how I stand to benefit from my development tool 
being owned by a strategic member of the Eclipse foundation (the primary 
platform and IDE competitor to Netbeans) and a company that also produces its 
own IDE (JDeveloper) which is a secondary platform and IDE competitor to 
Netbeans? Conversely, how do JDeveloper and Eclipse users benefit from this 
aquisition? Nobody benefits.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;As a MySQL user, tell me how I stand to benefit from my data storage 
tool being owned by a company that views MySQL as something that eats millions 
of dollars per year in potential Oracle database licensing? Conversely, how do 
Oracle users benefit from Oracle owning MySQL? Nobody benefits here either.</p> 
<p>I have no requirement for Glassfish right now but it is at the top of my 
short list should I need a full blown EE server that does not cost $25,000 per 
CPU. How do Glassfish or Weblogic users benefit from the aquisition? (tumble 
weed rolls by)</p> 
<p>In each case, the wolf is not only watching the hen house, the wolf is 
trying to buy the whole farm. I'm sorry Larry, your PR speak does nothing to 
convince me that there is anything even remotely altruistic in your intentions. 
I just don't see an upside for developers or consumers, but possibly for Oracle 
shareholders. It just smells anticompetitive in every respect.</p> 
<p>By the way, I also use VirtualBox and Open Office, awsome tools. </p>

<blockquote> 
<p>I see this aquisition as highly anticompetitive if allowed to take place. 
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>From a perspective, every acquisition is partially anticompetitive. In any 
case, the alternative was IBM (the &quot;owner&quot; of the Eclipse Foundation) 
or the failure - well, failure is anticompetitive by its very nature, as things 
mostly vanish in thin air. So, if the acquisition doesn't take place, it will 
be much worse.</p> 
<p>For the rest, I think we're discussing on weak basis. Basically the 
document published today doesn't say anything or just a few things. I believe 
that Glassfish is here to stay, because JEE is open sourced and needs a 
Reference Implementation, thus justifying the existence of two separate 
products. For NetBeans, Oracle didn't say anything, as &quot;is expected to 
provide...&quot; doesn't make clear who will fund this &quot;expectation&quot;. 
I believe that for NetBeans and other products there is still no decision.</p>

Java ME?

<h3>Nick Apperley replied on Wed, 2009/10/28 - 8:26pm</h3> 
<p>We all know what Larry's plans are for JavaFX so it is likely to be 
supported by Oracle. As for NetBeans it is most likely that Oracle will 
continue its support and funding but will likely cut back on Java EE support 
for the IDE, and increase its JavaFX/Java SE/Java ME support. I can easily see 
NetBeans being recommended by Oracle for developing consumer applications 
(desktop, mobile, embedded) on the Java platform, with JDeveloper being 
recommended for developing enterprise applications (web, SOA, mobile web). It 
would be very foolish for Oracle to drop support for VirtualBox considering 
that it is rapidly becoming a major contender for consumer virtualisation 
alongside VMWare Workstation and Virtual PC. I don't think Oracle has any good 
product(s) for covering consumer virtualisation.</p> 
<p>As for Oracle's plans on supporting Java ME and Java Embedded it is likely 
that they will support it, despite that fact that Oracle haven't mentioned 
anything about it. It is interesting to note that Oracle is no longer a company 
that is just involved on the enterprise side. Recently in the last few years 
Oracle have started to get involved in the consumer side.</p>

<p>Would you rather simply see the corporate backer of NetBeans, MySQL, and 
Glassfish go under?</p> 
<p>Sun had to be acquired at this point, unfortunately -- as much as I'd have 
loved to see them succeed on their own.&nbsp; They were natually going to be 
acquired by someone in the industry.</p> 
<p>I think all of these products have a much better future than if IBM had 
bought Sun.&nbsp; They may not all have perfectly rosy futures, but better than 
Sun just going belly up.</p>

<h3>Chris Arthur replied on Thu, 2009/10/29 - 8:21am</h3> 
<p>Personally I always hated JDeveloper. Not disliked or wasn't fond of, I 
hated it. I haven't tried to use it in quite some time so it could be better 
now, but it was garbage before so it could only go up in my opinion. I find 
Netbeans to be the best Java IDE there is. Eclipse is broken up and 
scatterbrained. It was intended to be a workbench that housed many 
interoperable tools, but that strength has become its weakness in my mind. 
Netbeans is integrated and looks and feels like one toolset instead of the 
smattering of tools that it actually is. The more Larry and his team talk about 
their plans for Sun's products, the more I find myself opposing the purchase. I 
am not interested in becoming the step-children hidden in the back room of 
Oracle.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;I find it interesting to note that while Oracle is touting the 
greatness of all its own junk while purchasing Sun for pity it seems since 
Oracle has vastly superior stuff, Microsoft is announcing their embracing of 
Eclipse developers in the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 operating systems. 
I am hearing the hammering of Netbeans coffin nails if this doesn't cease soon. 
No matter how hard I've tried in the past to stay angry at Microsoft and 
embrace Java and open source, all this with Oracle may be the final staw for 
me. Microsoft has major flaws but at least I won't have to worry about losing 
good tools to someone whose ego is larger than their world headquarters complex.

<h3>Loren Kratzke replied on Thu, 2009/10/29 - 3:15pm</h3> The hardware, 
virtualization, and office products are the good part of the acquisition 
because they expand the Oracle portfolio. The interesting upside is the the 
potential internal competition at Oracle that the remaining products will 
cause. As I recall, MySQL was profitable before Sun aquired them. They offered 
consulting. I wonder if Netbeans can do something similar. Oracle is pretty 
good at turning a shiny penny in the consulting business.

<h3>Gauthier Willia... replied on Thu, 2011/07/07 - 3:35am</h3> 
<p>If these succeed then oracle will surely have a great portfolio. The nice 
thing about his plan is that netbeans, glassfish and virtualbox are all what 
some programmers need to fasten and improve the uses of these products.&nbsp; 
The plans are really something and I hope oracle will get all the support.
