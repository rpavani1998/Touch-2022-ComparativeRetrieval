<h2> NetBeans wants Eclipse developers to switch </h2> <br>
<br>

<p>NetBeans is aggressively trying to get Eclipse developers to migrate to the 
NetBeans IDE.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>NetBeans introduced an Eclipse project import module some time back and it 
has now put up a section on netbeans.org about how and why you should switch. 
All themigration stories are from users who migrated from Eclipse to NetBeans 
and are happy with their decision. One comment says &ldquo;I was using a group 
of plug-ins in Eclipse to give me what NetBeans gives me out of the box&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>Unlike in the past when NetBeans seemed mostly on the defensive, NetBeans 
is now trying to show how it&rsquo;s superior to Eclipse.</p> 
<p>The top 10 reasons to switch to NetBeans, that are listed on the site are:
</p> 
<p>1. First to Support Java 5.0<br>
 2. Mobility Pack<br>
 3. Projects Based 
on Ant<br>
 4. The Profiler<br>
 5. J2EE Development<br>
 6. It&rsquo;s Fast<br>
 7. Best out of box experience<br>
 8. It&rsquo;s Cool<br>
 9. More 
International Language Support<br>
 10. 100% Java, Product of the Year 2005 </p>
<p>One wonders if these switch efforts will work their magic on any diehard 
Eclipse developers.</p>
