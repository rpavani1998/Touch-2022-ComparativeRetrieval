<h2> Ask DZ: What Features Would an Ideal IDE Have? </h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>You may love your IDE, but even the best IDE can get better. Or you may be

the functionality gaps with plugins that may or may not integrate perfectly. 
So, DZonistas: what features would an ideal IDE have?</p> Rob Williams01/16/12

<h2> An Eclipse Template for Parameterized JUnit Tests </h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>After refusing much of any changes, especially the ugly TestDecorator 
fixture, after TestNG showed up, JUnit went bonkers with a spasm of matching

<h2> Making Eclipse Fly </h2> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When compared to NetBeans, I find that Eclipse is a lot slower, 
particularly when doing enterprise development. To try and speed Eclipse up,
