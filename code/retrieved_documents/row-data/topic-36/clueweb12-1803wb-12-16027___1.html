<h2>The Import Eclipse Project Wizard</h2> 
<p>An enhanced support for importing Eclipse projects is available in the 
NetBeans IDE. The Import Eclipse Project wizard enables you to use NetBeans to 
work on Java desktop and web application projects that were created in Eclipse 
and MyEclipse.</p> 
<p>After creating a NetBeans project from an Eclipse project, you can work in 
the following ways:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use NetBeans on a team project where other developers are using Eclipse. 
</li> 
<li>Use NetBeans and Eclipse interchangeably on a project. </li> 
<li>Try out NetBeans on an existing project that was set up in Eclipse. </li> 
</ul> 
<p>top</p> 
<h2>How the Import Wizard Works</h2> 
<p>When you import a project, the IDE analyzes the Eclipse project metadata 
and then creates a NetBeans project based on that metadata. The project import 
does not impose changes on the Eclipse project structure, so it does not 
interfere with the way the project works in Eclipse.</p> 
<p>Once you have the project imported, you can use either or both the NetBeans 
and Eclipse IDEs to edit, build, run, debug, and profile the project. If you 
make a configuration change in the Eclipse project, you can resynchronize the 
NetBeans project. This enables you to work on projects in NetBeans even if 
everybody else on your team is working with Eclipse. The build path that you 
set in Eclipse remains the master build path for the project.</p> 
<p>top</p> 
<h2>Importing and Configuring Projects</h2> 
<p><b>To import an Eclipse project into NetBeans:</b></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Make sure that you have copy of the project that you want to import on 
your system.
<p>Typically, this project would already be in an Eclipse workspace on your 
system.</p></li> 
<li>Choose File &gt; Import Project &gt; Eclipse Project.</li> 
<li>In the Workspace Location page of the wizard, select the Import Projects 
from Workspace radio button and then specify the workspace location.</li> 
<li>In the Projects to Import page, select the projects that you want to 
import. Then select one of these two options for storing the NetBeans project 
files:
<ul> 
<li><b>Store NetBeans project data inside Eclipse project folders.</b> 
NetBeans adds folders and files within the top-level folder of the original 
project.</li> 
<li><b>Create imported NetBeans projects in a separate location.</b> NetBeans 
uses the sources and libraries in the original Eclipse project folder but 
creates a separate folder to hold NetBeans project metadata and build outputs.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Typically, it is better to store NetBeans project data inside Eclipse 
project folders. In most cases, this means that the NetBeans project metadata 
will refer to sources and libraries with the same paths that are used by the 
Eclipse metadata. Therefore, checking out the project from a version control 
system on different machines should result in similar behavior both in NetBeans 
and Eclipse.</p> 
<p>See NetBeans Project Files below for a list of files and folders that 
NetBeans creates.</p></li> 
<li>In the Servers page, register any servers that your projects need with 
NetBeans IDE. (This page does not appear if you are not importing an web 
applications.)</li> </ol> 
<p>After you have completed the wizard, the following dialog boxes might 
appear:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Import Issues.</b> This dialog provides information about discrepancies 
between the project structure in Eclipse and in NetBeans and points out actions 
that you might need to take to correct the discrepancies.
<p>You can copy the information from this dialog and paste it elsewhere for 
future reference.</p> 
<p>In most cases, you use the project's Project Properties dialog box to 
resolve those issues. SeeResolving Import Problems for a guide to resolving the 
most common problems.</p> </li> 
<li><b>Resolve Reference Problems.</b> This dialog box alerts you to a 
specific reference problem with one of your project libraries. You can solve 
this problem after dismissing this dialog box by right-clicking the project's 
node and choosing Resolve Reference Problems.</li> 
<li><b>Resolve Missing Server.</b> This dialog box alerts you that the project 
can not find a necessary server. You can solve this problem after dismissing 
this dialog box by right-clicking the project's node and choosing Resolve 
Missing Server.</li> </ul> 
<p>After you have completed the wizard and have closed any of the above 
informational dialog boxes, nodes for the projects will appear in the Projects 
window.</p> 
<p>If there are references in your project metadata to servers or other 
resources that NetBeans can not resolve, the node for the project will appear 
in red. You can resolve these references immediately by right-clicking the 
project node and choosing Resolve Reference Problems or Resolve Missing Server.
</p> 
<p>For other types of project configuration adjustments, you use the Project 
Properties dialog box. You open the Project Properties dialog box by 
right-clicking the project's node and choosing Properties.</p> 
<p>For more information on configuring your project, see Configuring the 
Classpath and Other Project Settings in the Creating, Importing, and 
Configuring Java Projects guide.</p> 
<p>top</p> 
<h2>Building and Running a Project</h2> 
<p>Once you have the project imported into NetBeans, you can build and run the 
project. All artifacts created from NetBeans build and run commands are created 
in the<code>build</code> and <code>dist</code> folders. NetBeans does not 
over-write output created from Eclipe build actions. If the Eclipse project 
already has<code>build</code> and <code>dist</code> folders, the NetBeans 
project creates folders called<code>nbbuild</code> and <code>nbdist</code> and 
uses those for the build outputs.</p> 
<p>The following are some of the build and run commands are available from the 
Run menu:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Run Project.</b> Test runs the application in the IDE.</li> 
<li><b>Clean and Build Project.</b> Deletes the contents of the <code>build
</code> (or <code>nbbuild</code>) and <code>dist</code> (or <code>nbdist</code>
) folders and rebuilds all of the project's outputs. Uses the NetBeans build 
script. Similar to the Clean command in Eclipse.</li> 
<li><b>Clean.</b> Deletes the contents of the <code>nbbuild</code> and <code>
nbdist</code> folders.</li> 
<li><b>Build.</b> Rebuilds the project's outputs. If the Compile on Save 
feature is enabled, the Build command is disabled. See theCompile on Save 
section of the Creating, Importing, and Configuring Java Projects guide.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For more information on building and running your application as well as 
customizing the build process, seeCreating, Importing, and Configuring Java 
Projects. </p> 
<p>top</p> 
<h2>NetBeans Project Files</h2> 
<p>After you have imported the project, you will find the following folder and 
files on your system:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><code>build.xml</code> file or <code>nb-build.xml</code> file. The main 
NetBeans build script for the project. You can customize this script according 
to the needs of your project. By default, this file is called<code>build.xml
</code>. If such a file already exists in the project folder, the script is 
called<code>nb-build.xml</code>.</li> 
<li><code>nbproject</code> folder. Contains most of the NetBeans project 
metadata, including resources that are called by the main NetBeans build 
script. If you check this folder and the<code>build.xml</code> file or <code>
nb-build.xml</code> into your version control system, other users will be able 
to open the project in NetBeans. This folder also contains the<code>private
</code> folder, which contains data specific to your system. This folder should 
not be checked in to the version control system since its contents will vary 
between users. SeeVersion Control Considerations below.</li> 
<li><code>nbbuild</code> folder. When you build or run your project in 
NetBeans, the project's sources are compiled into this folder.</li> 
<li><code>nbdist</code> folder. When you build your project in NetBeans, the 
project's distributable outputs are created and placed in this folder. Such 
outputs might be JAR files and WAR files.</li> </ul> 
<p>top</p> 
<h2>Version Control Considerations</h2> 
<p>If the project is checked out of a version control system, the <code>build
</code> (or <code>nbbuild</code>), <code>dist</code> (or <code>nbdist</code>), 
and the<code>nbproject/private</code> folders should not be checked into that 
version control system.</p> 
<p>If the project is under the CVS, Subversion, or Mercurial version control 
systems, the appropriate &quot;ignore&quot; files are created or updated for 
these directories when the project is imported.</p> 
<p>Though <code>nbproject/private</code> should be ignored, <code>nbproject
</code> should be checked into the version control system. <code>nbproject
</code> contains project metadata that enables others users to open the project 
in NetBeans without having to import the project first.</p> 
<p>top</p> 
<h2>Resynchronizing a Project</h2> 
<p>The project importer features synchronization capabilities. If the 
classpath in the Eclipse has changed since you initially imported it, you can 
use the Resynchronize Eclipse Projects feature to update the classpath in the 
corresponding NetBeans project.</p> 
<p>Project resynchronization is one-way from Eclipse projects to NetBeans 
projects. If you make changes to the project structure in NetBeans, those 
changes are not propagated to the Eclipse project with the resynchronization 
feature. If you intend to keep both Eclipse and NetBeans projects, use the 
Eclipse project as the &quot;master&quot; project.</p> 
<p>The IDE also resynchronizes the projects automatically if the changes to 
the Eclipse configuration are unambiguous and do not require your input. This 
automatic resynchronization occurs shortly after you open the project. If the 
resynchronization requires your input, you need to manually resynchronize the 
project.</p> 
<p><b>To manually resynchronize NetBeans projects with Eclipse projects:</b>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Choose File &gt; Import Project &gt; Resynchronize Eclipse Projects.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>Notes:</b> When you resynchronize a project, the resynchronization is 
performed on all projects that you have imported from the workspace.</p> 
<p>top</p> 
<h2>Resolving Import Problems</h2> 
<p>When you import a project into NetBeans, there might be some things that 
can not be automatically resolved in NetBeans IDE. For some of these problems, 
a menu item, such as Resolve Missing Server Problem, appears in the contextual 
menu for the project. Other problems can be resolved in the Project Properties 
dialog box for the imported project in NetBeans IDE.</p> 
<p>Here is a list of common import problems and their solutions.</p> Problem 
Message Solution <br>
Resolve Missing Server Problem Right-click the project 
node and choose Resolve Missing Server Problem. Then navigate to the file or 
folder that contains the server. <br>
Resolve Reference Problem Right-click the 
project's node and choose Resolve Reference Problem. Then navigate to the file 
or folder that contains the resource that is referred to from the project. <br>

Eclipse platform for project<i>ProjectName</i> cannot be used. It is a JRE and 
the NetBeans project requires a JDK. NetBeans will use the default platform. If 
you would like to change the platform that NetBeans uses for the project, 
choose Tools &gt; Platforms and specify a different platform. <br>
Eclipse 
project<i>ProjectName</i> claims to use JDK from the &quot;{1}&quot; directory. 
But this directory does not exist. NetBeans will use the default platform. If 
you would like to change the platform that NetBeans uses for the project, 
choose Tools &gt; Platforms and specify a different platform. <br>
NetBeans 
does not support source includes/excludes per source root as Eclipse does. They 
were merged and it is recommended that you double check them in project's 
properties in Source panel. In NetBeans, includes and excludes are declared in 
one place for the whole project. To check the includes and excludes in the 
NetBeans project, right-click the project's node and the Projects window and 
choose Properties. In the Project Properties dialog box, select the Sources tab 
and then click the Includes/Excludes button. <br>
Import failed due to <i>...
</i>. More details can be found in IDE's log file. You can open the IDE's log 
file by choosing View &gt; IDE Log. <br>
Unknown project type - it cannot be 
imported. You can only import the following Eclipse project types: Java 
Project, Java Project from Existing Ant File, Static Web, Dynamic Web, and JPA 
Project. <br>
