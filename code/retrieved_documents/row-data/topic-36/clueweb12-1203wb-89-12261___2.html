<h2>How to use an IDE with this book</h2> 
<p><i>Murach's Java SE 6</i> shows how to develop Java applications with 
TextPad, a text editor that's designed for Java. And it shows how to develop 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) by writing the Swing code needed to define a 
GUI.</p> 
<p>But we realize that you may prefer working with an IDE (integrated 
development environment) for everyday development tasks. And you may prefer 
using a graphical tool known as a GUI builder to automatically generate most of 
your Swing code.</p> 
<p>That's why we have created several downloadable tutorials that show how to 
use<i>Murach's Java SE 6</i> with some of the most popular IDEs for Java 
development:Eclipse, NetBeans, and BlueJ. For more details, please read on.

<h4>How to use Eclipse with <i>Murach's Java SE 6</i></h4> 
<p>By most accounts, Eclipse is the most widely-used IDE for developing Java 
applications. It is free, open-source, cross-platform, and provides plug-ins 
for a wide range of tasks. Although it can be a little tricky to get started 
with this IDE, it's a powerful tool that's used by many professional 
programmers.</p> 
<p>To make it easy for you to use our book with Eclipse, you can download our 
Eclipse tutorial. Although this tutorial only scratches the surface of the 
functionality that's available from Eclipse, it teaches you all the skills that 
you need to get started with Eclipse and to complete the applications presented 
in our book.</p> 
<p>You can also download Eclipse versions of the source code for this book. 
This includes all of the applications presented in the book, as well as all of 
the starting points for the exercises. Downloading and using these files will 
save you a lot of time that would otherwise be spent creating and configuring 
Eclipse projects.</p> 
<p>If you want to use Eclipse to build graphical user interfaces, the bad news 
is that the core distribution of Eclipse doesn't include a GUI builder that's 
easy to use. As a result, we recommend using the Matisse4MyEclipse plug-in that 
comes as part of the MyEclipse plug-in (Matisse is an easy-to-use GUI builder 
that's available in various IDEs). Although this plug-in isn't free, the 
pricing is reasonable (about $53 per year), and you can download a trial 
version for free from the MyEclipse web site.</p> 
<p>Our Eclipse GUI tutorial shows how to install and configure MyEclipse. 
Then, it shows how to use MyEclipse to develop the Future Value application 
presented in chapter 15 of this book. You can also downloadMatisse versions of 
the applications in chapters 15-18, so you can experiment with them without 
building them yourself.</p> 
<h4>How to use NetBeans with <i>Murach's Java SE 6</i></h4> 
<p>NetBeans is a user-friendly alternative to Eclipse that's appropriate for 
programmers who are getting started with Java. Like Eclipse, NetBeans is free, 
open-source, and cross-platform. </p> 
<p>To make it easy for you to use our book with NetBeans, you can download our 
NetBeans tutorial. Although it only scratches the surface of the functionality 
that's available from NetBeans, it teaches you all the skills that you need to 
complete the applications presented in our book.</p>
<p>You can also download NetBeans versions of the source code for this book. 
This includes all of the applications presented in the book as well as all of 
the starting points for the exercises. Downloading and using these files will 
save you a lot of time that would otherwise be spent creating and configuring 
NetBeans projects.</p>
<p> If you want to use NetBeans to build graphical user interfaces, you can 
use the Matisse GUI builder that's a part of NetBeans (there's no need for a 
separate plug-in as there is with Eclipse). OurNetBeans GUI tutorial shows you 
how, by taking you through the development of the Future Value application 
that's presented in chapter 15 of this book. You can also downloadMatisse 
versions of the applications in chapters 15-18, so you can experiment with them 
without building them yourself.</p> 
<h4>How to use BlueJ with <i>Murach's Java SE 6</i></h4> 
<p>BlueJ is a free IDE for developing Java applications that can be downloaded 
from the BlueJ web site. It's designed to make it easier for students to 
understand object-oriented programming, so it's used most often in college 
programs.</p> 
<p>To learn how to use this software in conjunction with our book, please 
download theBlueJ tutorial that we've prepared. As you'll soon discover, the 
applications in our book all work with BlueJ as is. So if you haven't already 
downloaded the book applications, you can do so by going to theDownloads page 
for the book.</p> <br>
