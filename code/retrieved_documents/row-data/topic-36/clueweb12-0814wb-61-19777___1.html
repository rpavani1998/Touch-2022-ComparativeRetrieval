<p><em>DZone recently met up with IBM's Ian Robinson to discuss Apache Aries, 
a project which aims to deliver a set of pluggable Java components enabling an 
enterprise OSGi application programming model. In this interview, recorded at 
IBM Impact 2010, Ian talks about how Apache Aries relates to the OSGi 
framework, and its support for numerous Java EE specs, including theJava 
Persistence API (JPA), the Java Transaction API (JTA), and Java Management 
Extensions (JMX). He also provides a roadmap for the project, which is 
currently in the Apache incubator. Ian is a Distinguished Engineer at IBM 
working out of the Hursley Lab in the UK.&nbsp;</em></p> <br>

<p><strong>DZone:</strong><strong> &nbsp;Can you tell us a little about your 
role at IBM?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Ian: </strong>My primary interest at the moment is around OSGI 
technologies and how they can be used in the application programming module in 
the WebSphere application Server and indeed, beyond the WebSphere application 
Server as well.</p> 
<p>How we can encourage the use of OSGI more globally, across the Java 
platform and in particular, in the Enterprise Java Space, in the OSGI 
Enterprise Expert Group and latterly to help set up the Apache Aries Project 
which focuses on building enterprise OSGI technologies and in particular 
enterprise OSGI technologies that affect application components.</p> 
<p>Aries is about components that can be integrated into enterprise runtime 
environments but components that are primarily application component facing, 
like theBlueprint Container.</p> 
<p><strong>DZone:</strong><strong> &nbsp;How does Aries differ from the OSGI 
framework?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Ian</strong>:&nbsp; OSGI is described across a number of different 
specifications: There is an OSGI core specification and then there are 
implementations of the OSGI core such as Eclipse Equinox, Apache Felix, 
Knopflerfish and others.</p> 
<p>There's an OSGI compendium specification and generally speaking, most of 
the compendium services that are defined in the compendium spec are also 
implemented by Felix and Equinox.</p> 
<p>Then there is an enterprise OSGI specification and that's where Apache 
Aries comes in. So that talks about how Java Enterprise technologies are, if 
you like, married with OSGI. So technologies like JTA, JNDI, JPA, JMX and so on.
</p> 
<p><strong>DZone:</strong><strong>&nbsp; What provisions does Aries provide 
for the JPA spec?<br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Ian</strong>:&nbsp; In an enterprise JAR and certainly in the 
enterprise OSGI specification, there is a definition of how persistence should 
be managed in an enterprise JAR environment. And that definition is to 
integrate JPA into an enterprise JAR .</p> 
<p>So there are essentially, three different aspects of JPA provision in OSGI. 
</p> 
<p>One aspect is the JPA provider.</p> 
<p>The second aspect is the application and it's definition of it's access to 
the database through a JPA persistence XML and the entities that it provides to 
interact with&#8209;&#8209;to actually represent the data in object form.</p> 
<p>Then there is the container integration which can optionally manage how JPA 
artifacts like entity managers and entity manager factories are provided, are 
injected into an application.</p> 
<p>So JPA has two different usage modules. There is an application usage model 
where the application essentially finds a JPA provider, interacts with it to 
create an entity manager factory and then uses the entity manager factory.</p> 
<p>In that model, the application is managing the use of the entity manager 
and it's association with any transaction context, for example.</p> 
<p>In a container managed environment, the container that the application 
component runs it, for example, a Blueprint Container can work with and 
discover JPA providers and inject entity managers from those JPA providers into 
an application, in order to process it's persistence units.</p> 
<p>And in that model, in the managed model, the container not only manages the 
life cycle of the entity manager, but it also manages the relationship of the 
entity manager's persistence context with any transaction that the application 
happens to be running under.</p> 
<p>So from an open source and Aries perspective, there are actually two open 
source projects that are relevant here. There's Apache OpenJPA, which is the 
JPA provider. Then within Apache Aries, we have a JPA container component which 
is part of our Blueprint Container.</p> 
<p>So the Blueprint Container is extended with the JPA container so that the 
Blueprint Components that run inside the Blueprint Container can have their JPA 
context managed for them by the Blueprint Container. Which is actually, quite 
an advanced extension to the Blueprint specification that we add as value in 
the Aries Blueprint implementation.</p> 
<p><strong>DZone:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>How does Aries'&nbsp; JTA and JMX 
integration work?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Ian</strong>:&nbsp; Arie's JTA integration uses the transaction 
manager in Geronimo. So Geronimo has an implementation of JTA. What we have for 
the Aries JTA integration is the registration of JTA services in the OSGI 
service registry.</p> 
<p>Aries interacts with Geronimo, gets the transaction manager, puts it into 
the OSGI service registry, and makes it available for applications. And like 
JPA, that we were talking about earlier on, we also have an integration of 
transactions into the Blueprint container as well.</p> 
<p>So that the Blueprint Container can understand transaction configuration 
for Blueprint components, just like the EJB container can, in fact. And can run 
Blueprint components under JTA global transactions as well.</p> 
<p>So that's the transaction side of things. We have JMX integration as well. 
There are about eight services defined in the OSGI JMX specification.</p> 
<p>In the JMX implementation in Apache Aries, we implement MBeans services so 
that you can use JMX to query aspects of a running OSGI framework. &quot;What 
is the framework? What applications are running inside that framework? What 
services do they provide?&quot; All from a remote JMX client. So that's JMX 
integration.</p> 
<p>We have JNDI integration as well. For example, an OSGI service registered 
in the service registry can also be made available for discovery through JNDI 
by a JNDI client. Which eases the integration in an enterprise application 
between components that have been derived from the Java EE side of the 
universe. Which doesn't know anything about the OSGI, on the one hand. And 
services which are registered by OSGI&#8209;aware components on the other hand.
</p> 
<p>So there's a nice integration between essentially loosely coupled 
components. That's essentially the summary of some of the core aspects.</p> 
<p>One of the other things that I think Apache Aries has a very 
forward&#8209;looking approach to is the assembly and deployment of 
multi&#8209;bundled applications. So, in that respect, Apache Aries is 
innovating because we're ahead of any standardization effort in the OSGI 
alliance at the moment.</p> 
<p>But, our objective with doing that is to gain experience and ensure that we 
have developed an efficient and usable and practical model for deploying 
multi&#8209;bundled applications in order to inform our work in the OSGI 
alliance.</p> 
<p><strong>DZone:&nbsp; Can you give us a preview of what we can expect to see 
in the next three to six months with the Aries project?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Ian</strong>:&nbsp; We're just in the process at the moment of 
voting on our first release, so that will be about seven months after creating 
the beta project. I'm hoping, by the end of this week or next week, we'll have 
our first release out there. And our first release covers things like the 
application assembly model, JMX, J2EE Blueprint Container, the things I've 
spoken about already. Beyond that, we've had interest expressed by members of 
the community to extend the work of the Enterprise Expert Group at the moment 
with development of some more forward&#8209;looking things, and indeed some 
things that we are interested in standardizing through the Enterprise Expert 
Group. Things like provision of asynchronous services, perhaps 
message&#8209;driven BluePrint endpoints, for example.</p> 
<p>But I think, in terms of the work that we set out to do, to build initial 
implementations of the Enterprise Expert Group specifications, once we've got 
our first release out there and we've demonstrated that we have a vibrant 
community, then I think, within the next three or four months, I hope and 
expect to see Apache Aries actually graduate from incubation.</p> 
<p><strong>DZone: Having worked really closely with the OSGi Enterprise Expert 
Group, and now on Aries, in your opinion, what direction does Java need to 
evolve to become a truly modular platform?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Ian</strong>: &nbsp;Where does Java need to evolve? It's 
interesting, looking at the different ways that Java could evolve. I would like 
to see Java evolve so that it recognizes the 10 years of experience, probably 
11 years of experience, that we have in the OSGi Alliance of building modular 
systems and actually adopt OSGi as THE module system for Java.</p> Attachment
