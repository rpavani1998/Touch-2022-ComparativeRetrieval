2007, Entwickler-Press, Germany<br>
 Language: German 
<p>The EJB 3 spec has drastically simplified the Java EE development. But on 
the other hand, additional concepts like interceptors, inheritance in the 
persistence layer, detaching/attaching of transient objects introduce not only 
additional possibilities and shortcuts, but also pitfalls.</p> 
<p>This book explains the most important EJB 3, architectures, patterns, 
hacks, approaches and discusses which concepts from the &quot;legacy&quot; EJB 
2 world are still useful. The domain driven design is covered as well as 
service-oriented architectures.</p>

<p> </p>  Learning Java, Third Edition  Published: May 2005 <br>
 Language: 
English  Version 5.0 of the Java 2 Standard Edition SDK is the most important 
upgrade since Java first appeared a decade ago. With Java 5.0, you'll not only 
find substantial changes in the platform, but to the language itself-something 
that developers of Java took five years to complete. The main goal of Java 5.0 
is to make it easier for you to develop safe, powerful code, but none of these 
improvements makes Java any easier to learn, even if you've programmed with 
Java for years. And that means our bestselling hands-on tutorial takes on even 
greater significance. Learning Java, 3rd Edition addresses all of the important 
uses of Java, such as web applications, servlets, and XML that are increasingly 
driving enterprise applications. The accompanying CD includes the Java 5.0 SDK 
for Windows, Linux and Solaris, plus the NetBeans IDE, and the many example 
programs from the book.<br>

<p> </p>  Simply Java: An Introduction To Java Programming (Programming Series)
 Published: September 2005<br>
 Language: English  Simply Java: An Introduction 
to Java Programming is an easy-to-follow textbook that guides beginning 
programmers step-by-step through the process of learning Java. The main 
obstacle to learning object-oriented programming is the volume of detail that 
needs to be learned before even the simplest program can be created. This text 
eliminates extraneous details early on and stresses only concepts students need 
to know. It teaches classes and objects from the outset, and presents 
programming as extended problem solving, making it easier to understand. Class 
design and graphical user interfaces are introduced early, but most of the 
detail is postponed until after students have a better grasp of objects, 
classes, and inheritance. Simply Java: An Introduction to Java Programming is 
the perfect text for anyone new to Java, looking for a comprehensive, 
easy-to-comprehend guide.<br>
