<p>My mailbox aggregates several Java User Groups and other specialized 
sources of information about the Java universe, with special guests like CEJUG 
and the Java EE community. Many of these Java sources are used by consultant 
companies to hire smart people, and since last year I am reading a desperate  
growing interest about skilled Java developers. More: few days ago I was having 
a coffee with some colleagues and a manager confessed he is worried where to 
hire all resources he needs to allocate in the signed contracts for 2010.</p> 
<p>Listening such conversation and watching the raising offerings in the 
mailing lists I have only one conclusion: Java market is dry, skilled Java 
developers are becoming scarce. Reasons for that? No idea, but there are some 
obvious observations about our times:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Hype languages and technologies didn't conquered the market as we expected, 
languages like Scala, Ruby, Grails, etc. Android? You know, perhaps next year. 
These languages advertised revolutions during the last two or three year, sold 
out a lot of books and conference speeches but nowadays it is not easy to find 
good jobs (salaries) for such technologies. Certainly there are good jobs 
somewhere, but it is nothing compared to the<em>Java is dead</em> speech of 
three years ago. Simple fact is: Java is stillranking high in the IT market, 
while all that hype revolutions are still hype promises. And the young 
developers that followed the hype? Well, they will need to accept that Java job 
now, frustrated people mostly unable to delivery a quality service anyway.</p> 
</li> 
<li> 
<p>People are becoming lazy and dumb, everyday a bit more. Watch idiocracy and 
you will get the point. If not convinced, watch MTV for half an hour and you 
get a live demo :). The iPhone users cannot handle more than one button in any 
GUI and unsafe-typed languages say that &quot;anything that requires a type 
declaration is just too complicated to be useful&quot;. Nice speech, but what 
to do with developers convinced that math and domain models are obsolete 
technologies?</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>What about the salaries and Java carriers? Java platform produces a large 
chunk of all software running in the Global IT market, supporting business at a 
scale of billions of dollars every year. Nothing more natural than expect the 
guys behind this technology monster to have a good life - or at least a 
profitable life. Well, the reality is a boring overestimation of the management 
models, leaving to the developers just the extra hours,tendinitis and more 
learning curves.</p> </li> </ul> 
<h3>How to hire good Java developers?</h3> 
<p>Just in case you are seriously looking for good Java developers, some hints:
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Raise the salary (no excuses).</li> 
<li>Offer learning as part of the job benefits (conferences, books, courses, 
etc).</li> 
<li>Allow your developers to take project decisions.</li> 
<li>Use modern Java technologies (Still using Java 1.4?)</li> 
<li>Give the developers some stability and carrier perspective, and don't try 
that in a bureaucratic way.</li> 
<li>Flexible working time and remote office should be available.</li> 
<li>Give the developers more than water and coffee.. how about fruits? cokes 
and other beverages? How much it costs for you to buy 1 coke per developer a 
day? If you think it is too much, please leave the market :)</li> 
<li>Don't try poor copies of Google and IBM ideas, these companies are just 
richer than yours. Be creative and honest with your developers.</li> </ol> 
<p>Good luck :) Java market is dry, good developers are scarce.. it is time 
for smart managers to raise the salaries and catch the good ones, the rest can 
be shared by people reading Scrum and Kanban manuals.</p>

<h3>Frank Silbermann replied on Wed, 2010/01/06 - 10:08am</h3> Hire the Java 
developers who lost their jobs during the recession.&nbsp; If necessary, hire 
the ones who lost their jobs during the dot-com crash or due to 
out-sourcing.&nbsp; And for the sake of the future, stop firing Java 
developers, and you won't have this problem.

<h3>Eric Rich replied on Wed, 2010/01/06 - 11:59am</h3> I'm surprised that 
profit sharing or bonuses were not mentioned. Our team got bonuses last week 
and raises this week. We get a paid vacation (with paid time off for a week) 
this year too (comes up every two years). I'm glad that the owner of the 
company knows how to hire and keep Java developers. :-) Eric Rich Flux - Java

<h3>Wal Rus replied on Wed, 2010/01/06 - 1:14pm</h3> it's funny to see 
complaints about dumbing down population and requests for coke, coffee and 
&quot;other beverages&quot; &ndash;&nbsp;what exactly do you mean here anyways 
:) Surely the link between what you eat and a psychological as well as chemical 
state of mind/brain exists and so the only 'valid' recommendation there was 
fruit. The rest will definitely dumb down: shorten attention span, reduce brain 
power.

<p>@wal_rus: you are right, but coke was just a reference for something the 
developers like ... no recommendations at all :)</p>

shooted: &quot;you see, it is not only me.. &quot; :) eheh</p>

<p>Felipe,</p> 
<p>the &quot;hunt for developers&quot; is only happening down here in Brazil 
and few other emerging markets. Up there, they're still recovering from 
recession.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, I agree finding average developers is difficult, really good 
ones are close to impossible. But I can say that's the case for every 
profession in high demand.</p> 
<p>People in general tends to accomodate and in tech that means not being able 
to use the productivity tools and concepts developed in recent years. They're 
productivity goes down and the company tries to solve it by hiring consultants, 
architects and layers of managers. You get into the situation that salaries are 
low, yet the company spends a lot of money on IT.</p> 
<p>Eventually managers learn that 1 really good professional are worth tens of 
the mediocre kind...</p>

<p>Felipe,</p> 
<p>No matter how good you are or how hard you have worked on a project, if the 
project is not making money don't expect bonus or a raise, the management won't 
event think about it, since the success rate of a project does not depend on 
developers alone. This is one example where performance appraisal is nothing 
but formality.</p> 
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

<h3>Frank Silbermann replied on Thu, 2010/01/07 - 1:04pm</h3> The hiring 
market for Java developers cannot be all that tight if employers can be picky 
enough to specify a dozen different APIs, tools and frameworks with which a 
candidate must also have significant experience.

<p>&nbsp;Both of those companies are no paradises to work at. IBM only 
qualifies for 2 out of 7 points, though nothing beats IBM's stability. Google 
does get 5 out of 7.</p>
