4mobile s.r.o. <br>
4mobile has been formed by veterans from 
the areas of mobile application development, PC &amp; console game development 
and IP licensing. Our goal is to make mobile handset application usage a 
practice as common to the masses as sending SMSs. We fight this battle by 
creating innovative communication-enabled products under the 4M brand (the 4M 
Crosswords service will be released in March 2010) and by helping other 
companies stretch their business to mobile devices. Our chief weapons are 8+ 
years' experience in mobile applications and content, 10+ years of 
client-server development, 10+ years in AAA game development, 10+ years of 
experience handling top-notch licensed movie properties, support of 1000+ 
handsets, Android, iPhone, Windows Mobile and J2ME porting tools (and 
experience), cooperation with Sun Microsystems' NetBeans team on J2ME features 
of their IDE, iPhone development licence, a Sony PSP development license and a 
professional, yet very human attitude. We built our J2ME and porting pipelines 
around NetBeans and its integration with Ant. NetBeans simply has the best J2ME 
support out there, period. We were able to throw away our proprietary 
preprocessors and other stuff, replacing those with the ever improving features 
of the NetBeans IDE. We save big time by using NetBeans. <br>

Digital 
Steps Limited <br>
As a leading developer of enterprise Java software Digital 
Steps needs and demands an integrated development environment that delivers 
high levels of individual and team productivity. NetBeans does that. Over the 
years we've tried, and in some cases paid for, many of the leading tool sets 
and have ultimately found them lacking. NetBeans is robust, reliable, fast and 
feature rich, and the pace of innovation is staggering. For us, the Java EE 5 
support, ANT integration, and SOA tools are particularly compelling aspects of 
the product, but the more we use it the more we find to like. As we begin to 
integrate more JSF and AJAX in our applications we're enjoying the benefits of 
the Visual Web Pack and Matisse really delivers for rich client development. 
Ultimately, we're always looking for ways to do it better. Ways to deliver more 
value to our clients. Ways to deliver higher quality software more quickly and 
with more functionality. Ways to build software that makes us and our customers 
proud. NetBeans is a key part of that drive, and we rely on it to help us 
deliver on our promises. But NetBeans is more than simply about an IDE. It's 
about being part of a community. As a Sun Partner Advantage partner we are 
engaged with Sun's ISV-Engineering organisation, led in EMEA and APAC by Senior 
Director Yousef Yacoub. With the benefit of this two-way engineering 
relationship we have the support necessary to fully leverage the features of 
the NetBeans IDE in our development activities. <br>
