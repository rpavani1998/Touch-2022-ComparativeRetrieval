<h2> NetBeans was the early bird but has Eclipse caught the worm? </h2> <br>

<br> 
<p>Rich Unger is currently on the NetBeans Governance Board and has been a 
contributor to NetBeans for several years. He was honored at this year&rsquo;s 
NetBeans Software Day for his valuable contribution to the NetBeans platform.
</p> 
<p>In this interview Rich talks about NetBeans 5.0, NetBeans Profiler and the 
changing Java IDE market. He shares his views on plugin development for the 
NetBeans platform and on Eclipse. He also elaborates on why he thinks the field 
is wide open for client frameworks for desktop java apps and how it could come 
down to Swing vs SWT.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; Hi Rich. Could you please introduce yourself?
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>Hi there! I&rsquo;m a developer on the 
V-Builder team at Nuance Communications. Nuance is in the business of 
network-based speech recognition. For example, when you call American Airlines, 
and the machine on the other end says What is your destination city? and you 
can speak the name of any city they fly to, you&rsquo;re talking to our 
technology.</p> 
<p>V-Builder is our development tool for creating these types of speech 
applications. It allows you to model graphically conversations between humans 
and computers, and generate VoiceXML to implement the call flow. It is 
implemented on top of the NetBeans platform, and you can see a screenshot at
http://platform.netbeans.org</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; NetBeans IDE recently jumped from version 4.1 
to 5.0. So what&rsquo;s special about 5.0 that warranted the jump?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>Well, from my perspective, the 
completely revamped support for module development alone is worthy of a major 
version number increment. I&rsquo;ve been writing modules on top of the 
platform since NetBeans 3.3, and it&rsquo;s never been particularly easy until 
now. It was always a lot of hacked up build scripts, difficult to test, 
difficult to debug, and difficult to deploy.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The completely revamped support for NetBeans module development, 
alone is worthy of a major version number increment&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <strong>

<br>

<p>Up until 4.0, I actually preferred Eclipse for developing NetBeans modules. 
In 4.0, the NetBeans IDE finally became better for developing NetBeans platform 
modules. But, even then, it was not nearly as easy as it should have been. I 
packaged up a modified version of the netbeans.org build files (which are quite 
complex), and called it the &lsquo;cluster build harness&rsquo;. This allowed 
folks to build applications on the platform (like V-Builder), but it was not 
officially supported.</p> 
<p>In 5.0, Jesse Glick et. al. took the idea of the cluster build harness, and 
reworked it so it could have first-class support in the IDE. Then they just 
kept adding features and wizards until creating, debugging, testing, branding, 
and shipping modules could all be done in a ridiculously simple fashion.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Matisse GUI builder works the way you always thought GUI builders 
should&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Other than the module development support, major new features in 5.0 
include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Matisse</strong>: The dead-simple GUI builder that really works 
the way you always thought GUI builders should.</li> 
<li> <strong>New CVS Support</strong>: A completely revamped approach to the 
source control UI. I&rsquo;m told that a subversion version of this will be 
alpha or beta when 5.0 is released. I&rsquo;m hoping for ClearCase, myself, 
though no word on that yet. For now, I&rsquo;m stuck with the old source 
control module.</li> 
<li> <strong>JSF and Struts Support</strong></li> 
<li><strong> Developer collaboration modules</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t tried 
these out yet, but the demos I&rsquo;ve seen are very encouraging. 
There&rsquo;s a guy on my team who lives in Hawaii, and this ought to make 
codewalks much easier.</li> 
<li><strong> JFluid Profiler</strong>: I&rsquo;d have to put this as a close 
second to module development support in my personal list. A long time ago, 
debuggers were things that were hard to configure, and so there was this hurdle 
you had to overcome in the severity of a bug before you went through the effort 
of using a debugger. I think that&rsquo;s where profiling is now, and I think 
the JFluid profiler will knock down such barriers. We won&rsquo;t think twice 
about profiling our applications. It will be as natural as debugging, and a 
whole new class of software errors will become a whole lot easier to address.
</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; Do you think that NetBeans&rsquo; J2EE 
development capabilities can today match the features of any other IDE in the 
market?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>There&rsquo;s really two camps in the 
J2EE world these days. If you&rsquo;re the type of developer who uses 
EJB&rsquo;s, and must use JSR-blessed libraries (JSF over Tapestry, for 
example), then you&rsquo;ll be a lot happier with NetBeans. Also, their web 
services support is second to none. They&rsquo;ve got a built-in Tomcat and 
Derby DB that let you get up and running extremely quickly. The HTTP Monitor 
window helps you figure out exactly what&rsquo;s going on in your app.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If you must use JSR blessed libraries, you&rsquo;ll be a lot happier 
with NetBeans&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>NetBeans is less strong when it comes to supporting some of the more 
popular OSS libraries out there. It&rsquo;s got nothing like Spindle (an 
Eclipse plugin) for Tapestry. I think the Hibernate support is currently a bit 
better with the appropriate Eclipse plugins. Spring is so simple that I think 
it doesn&rsquo;t matter which IDE you use. Just having decent XML syntax 
completion should be adequate.</p>

popular OSS libraries&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <strong></strong> <br>

<br>

<p>This is certainly something they&rsquo;re addressing in NetBeans, though. 
They&rsquo;ve finally added nice Struts support. Also, the module-writing 
support includes some fantastic wizards that make writing something like a 
Hibernate plugin pretty simple, so I think we&rsquo;ll be seeing those kinds of 
modules in the near future.</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; </strong>NetBeans Profiler is a recent 
development that NetBeans seems to be pushing in a big way. In what state is 
the Profiler today and will the Profiler stay an independent product or will it 
become a part of NetBeans at a later state?</p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>I think the main reason it&rsquo;s a 
separate product right now is that it requires JDK 5.0, and the core NetBeans 
project must remain 1.4-compliant. I&rsquo;ve asked on the mailing list why the 
profiler isn&rsquo;t just a module on the Update Center, and the answer was 
something like, I don&rsquo;t know. Probably it will be soon.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;NetBeans Profiler is fantastic technology&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong> </strong>The profiler is fantastic technology. You can profile 
pieces of your application, thereby reducing the performance impact. For 
example, if you&rsquo;re working on a J2EE app, you don&rsquo;t have to profile 
the whole app server, just your own code. They&rsquo;re finally hitting the 
point where it&rsquo;s no longer a question of should I profile my app? 
It&rsquo;s just too easy not to.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer a question of should I profile my app? 
It&rsquo;s just too easy not to&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The one downside is that it required changes to the JRE. Most of those 
changes made it into JDK 5.0 update 4. However, we have to wait for Mustang 
before we can attach to a running application (the way we already can with the 
debugger).</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; BEA, Borland, Nokia and to some extend Oracle 
have all got involved in Eclipse. However Sun Java Studio Creator is perhaps 
the only major product built over NetBeans. Why isn&rsquo;t the NetBeans 
platform more popular?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>I guess it depends on your 
perspective, but I&rsquo;d consider V-Builder a major product </p> 
<p><strong></strong>It&rsquo;s important to notice that BEA, Borland, and 
Nokia are all working on features to help IDE catch up to NetBeans in the web 
and mobile space. Now, I&rsquo;m not knocking Eclipse. NetBeans certainly has 
been playing their own share of catch-up. They just tend to do it themselves, 
rather than enlisting partners to work with them.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Most desktop java apps are still built without using a client-side 
framework at all. The field is still wide open&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this has much to do with the platform, however. To me, 
the success of the Eclipse RCP and the NetBeans Platform can be measured by how 
many apps are written on top of them that are not IDEs. It looks to me like 
most desktop java apps are still built without using a client-side framework at 
all. The field is still wide open.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I think it will come down to Swing vs. SWT&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In the end, assuming people buy into the argument that such a platform is 
indeed helpful, then I think it will come down to Swing vs. SWT, and the 
libraries that are available for doing things like data binding, graphing, 
visualization, charting, etc.</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; Despite NetBeans being the early bird, 
Eclipse today seems to have got the worm. Do you see things changing in the 
near future?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>The worm that I think Eclipse does 
have is the community of IDE plugin developers, which, as I said, is distinct 
from the platform market. Eclipse has a wide lead in IDE plugins because their 
IDE was better (let&rsquo;s face it, it was), and because their tools for 
writing plugins were better. I think NetBeans has caught up on both counts. 
More and more I hear people interested in writing IDE plugins that will work on 
both Eclipse and NetBeans. That&rsquo;s a good indication that NetBeans has 
finally found a broader audience. IDE market share will drive the plugin 
community, not the other way around.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Eclipse has a wide lead in IDE plugins because their IDE and their 
tools for writing plugins were better&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <strong></strong> <br>

<br>

<p>As an aside, I think the goal of writing a plugin once for both platforms 
is a laudable goal, but for all kinds of technical and architectural reasons, 
won&rsquo;t be fully realized.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Writing a plugin once for both platforms (NetBeans and Eclipse) is a 
laudable goal that won&rsquo;t be fully realized&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; You perhaps would be pretty fed up of 
providing aNetBeans vs Eclipse comparison. So instead of giving a comparison 
could you tell us when one should go with NetBeans and when Eclipse might be a 
better choice?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>That sounds an awful lot like asking 
me to provide a comparison<br>
 The great thing about both is that 
they&rsquo;re free! And, they&rsquo;re both pretty easy to get up and running 
with your current codebase. So, try them both out. Maybe you&rsquo;ll end up 
keeping them both and using them for different tasks. I did that for a while. 
These days, I&rsquo;m totally on NetBeans (and gvim), but that&rsquo;s not true 
of everyone on my team. The Hawaiian guy is an Eclipse aficionado, and he 
continues developing NetBeans modules with it. Personally, I think when he 
tries out the new collaboration modules, he&rsquo;ll use NetBeans more.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;People will always be asking for Eclipse vs NetBeans comparisons 
because both keep leapfrogging each other&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>People will always be asking for such comparisons, because Eclipse and 
NetBeans keep leapfrogging each other. Eclipse is working on a Visual Editor to 
compete with Matisse, and the Nokia guys are working on matching the feature 
set of the Mobility Pack. The NetBeans guys are continually adding new 
refactorings and tweaking the usability of the editor, both areas where Eclipse 
has historically had higher marks.</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; Considering the wide range of features of 
NetBeans and Eclipse and also that JDeveloper recently became free, do you 
think the days of the commercial Java IDE are over / numbered?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>I think Borland&rsquo;s days in the 
IDE space are numbered. I don&rsquo;t think enough people are going to see the 
value in their Eclipse plugins. I feel the same way about Sun&rsquo;s Enterpise 
Java Studio. It&rsquo;s basically NetBeans with a UML modeler. Ho hum.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Borland&rsquo;s days in the IDE space are numbered&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun&rsquo;s Enterpise Java Studio is basically NetBeans with a UML 
modeler&hellip;&rdquo;</p> <strong></strong> <br>
<strong>On stage in front of 
thousands of DBAs</strong> <br>
<br>

<p>The IDEA folks, though, have got it together. They&rsquo;re not targeting 
the whole Java developer community. They&rsquo;re creating a product 
that&rsquo;s extremely compelling to a much smaller slice of the market, and 
creating a lot of loyalty around that. That&rsquo;s something you can charge 
for. So long as they can stay ahead of Eclipse and NetBeans in the few areas 
where they really shine, and thereby capture a consistent (if small) market 
share, I think they can still have a profitable concern.</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; NetBeans is integrated with Sun&rsquo;s 
Application Server however which other servers can one easily work with through 
NetBeans?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Rich Unger &gt;&gt; </strong>Well, Tomcat is built in. JBoss and 
WebLogic integrations are finished now, and supposedly Websphere is on the way.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;NetBeans is integrated with Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic and Sun&rsquo;s 
Application Server. WebSphere is on the way&hellip; &ldquo;</p> 
<p><strong>IndicThreads &gt;&gt; Thanks Rich for your time and all the info 
about NetBeans and the Java IDE market.</strong></p> 
<p>My pleasure. Good luck with IndicThreads.</p>

<p>Had a really bas experience when we were outsourcing. I don\&rsquo;t 
recommend it. And as for cheaper? I don\&rsquo;t think so, on the impression it 
might seem cheaper. But it essence it cost the company more. They are quick, 
but the communication is poor which caused delays. They never really understood 
requirements. Plus they struggled with cultural barrier when developing a site. 
All the back and forth made outsourcing unreliable. Nice guys, just 
couldn\&rsquo;t get the job done.</p> </li>

<p>I feel the reason why Netbeans is not as popular as Eclipse is that Sun has 
tried to do everything on it&rsquo;s own. No doubt it has done a very good job 
but this approach means that NetBeans doesn&rsquo;t get get free publicity like 
Eclipse does.</p> 
<p>IBM does not have to market Eclipse because Nokia, BEA, etc are doing the 
marketing on IBM&rsquo;s behalf. With NetBeans, nobody is helping Sun.</p> 
<p>NetBeans is obviously easier to use and has more features out of the box. 
</p> 
<p>Just the Eclipse website is so confusing that you are never sure if you 
have downloaded what you were really looking for.</p> </li> </ul>
