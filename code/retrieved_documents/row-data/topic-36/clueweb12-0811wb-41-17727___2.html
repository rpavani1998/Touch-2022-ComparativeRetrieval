<h4>The Java Evolution Mismatch: Why You Need a Better JVM</h4> 
<h4>Apache Lucene 3.0: Download the LucidWorks Certified Distribution</h4> 
<p>When compared to NetBeans, I find that Eclipse is a lot slower, 
particularly when doing enterprise development. To try and speed Eclipse up, 
I&rsquo;ve taken the JVM settings that NetBeans uses and applied them to 
Eclipse. The result is a vast improvement in performance. The default JVM 
settings in Eclipse aren&rsquo;t optimal.<br>
<br>
 On a Mac, the following 
procedure allows the JVM settings to be changed:<br>
<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Find Eclipse in the Finder. Right click on Eclipse and choose &quot;Show 
Package Contents&quot;</li> 
<li>Browse to the Contents | MacOS directory and edit the eclipse.ini file</li>
<li>In this file add JVM options, one per line.</li> </ul> <br>
 The JVM 
options that make the biggest difference are the ones that specify how much 
memory Eclipse can use.
<pre>-Xms512m -Xmx512m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m</pre> 
<p> I also tell the JVM not to verify bytecode using the -Xverify switch </p> 
<pre>-Xverify:none</pre> 
<p> According to the NetBeans performance tuning tips, changing the garbage 
collection policies can also make a difference. I&rsquo;m not sure that these 
make much of a difference, but I&rsquo;m running with them at the moment to see 
if there is any difference.</p> 
<pre>-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled 
-XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled</pre> 
<p>Applying these switches has made Eclipse much more comfortable to use, but 
I guess other peoples milage may differ depending on what they are doing or 
what machine they are using.<br>
<br>
 Do you have any other JVM switches that 
you apply to IDEs to make them more responsive?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also append the -server option, letting the JIT/Hotspot do more 
aggressive optimizations, but it requires an installed JDK.</p>

<h3>Michael Remijan replied on Fri, 2011/12/02 - 9:03am</h3> How do you have 
Netbeans configured?&nbsp; In my experience Netbeans has always been and still 
is a lot slower than Eclipse.&nbsp; I think Netbeans is great but I get 
frustrated waiting all the time for it to finish doing whatever it's trying to 
do.&nbsp;

<h3>John J. Franey replied on Fri, 2011/12/02 - 12:26pm</h3> Half a Gig for 
eclipse for an enterprise development project? That is tight. GC configuration 
makes a difference because your CPU is spending more time with GC than doing 
work for you. Half a Gig is stingy, too, considering the cost of memory. Are 
you one of those who think a tool is great only if it runs on a few 100M of ram?

<h3>Stephane Vaucher replied on Sat, 2011/12/03 - 10:33am</h3> @John - Take a 
look at the date he posted the article (April 2009). Two and a half years ago, 
running eclipse with 512m was possible.

<p> The submit date to javalobby is just yesterday. The blog is quoted 
entirely, but without the original blog's date. Unless a reader visits the 
blog, they would be misled as I was. Indeed, almost all the facts here are 2.5 
years old and made obsolete by new software releases including a JIT 
performance update to java 6 in May 2009 (update 14; last update: 29), eclipse 
(galileo, helios, indigo) and netbeans (6.7, 6.8, 7.0). Whatever was true 2.5 
years ago should not have been posted on javalobby as a new submission. Is 
there anyone minding the store?</p>

Hi Mladen, I usually run Eclipse with a JDK so will give this a try. Thanks!

</h3> Hi John, I certainly don't think a tool is great if it only runs on a few 
100M of ram. What the article is trying to point out is that if you use the 
default settings from NetBeans in Eclipse, they work a lot better than the 
Eclipse default settings.

<h3>Extreme Java replied on Fri, 2011/12/09 - 4:56am</h3> 
<p>I think you need that much of RAM in order to those memory options. If 
there is no memory available fo example you specify the startup size with xms 
option and if that much memory can not be allocated then eclipse won't start.

<p>Hi Davi,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I tried the same settings with my eclipse and did not see any performance. 
I am building a web application that is using following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>JSF at front end</li> 
<li>EJB and Hibernate at its backend</li> </ul>I think Eclipse start building 
complete project every time you make a change in code and it is effecting its 
performance. If you want to speed up the things you can even uncheck 
automatically build option.<br>

<p>Today I was running an application in Eclipse. I also tried the same 
application in netbeans.&nbsp; found that without tuning Eclipse is much faster 
than than the netbeans.</p> 
<p>I was using myeclipse 10 and netbeans 6.8 for the same application. </p>
