<h2>Netbeans 6.1 released today</h2>  April 30, 2008 &ndash; 7:01 am 
<p>It&rsquo;s official NetBeans 6.1 is now in full release and available for 
download fromNetBeans.org. I have not been keeping up so well with this version 
and so I&rsquo;m a little out of the loop on all the changes but I understand 
that they have been working hard on improving the JavaScript capabilities, from 
what I can tell this is mostly in the intellisense. Looks like the same 
guy&rsquo;s that worked on the awesome Ruby editor functionality have been 
working on improving the JavaScript editor this time around.</p> 
<p>This release did remind me that I was going to take a look and see if I 
could get NetBeans to play nice with some of the JavaScript libraries out there 
and I never did, apologies to those who were waiting for me to pull my finger 
out.</p> 
<p>Since 6.1 is supposed to improve JavaScript in NetBeans I shall have to 
take a look. The detailed feature list can be foundhere.</p> 
<p>The official announcement from the NetBeans announcement email is:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>NetBeans&trade; IDE 6.1 supports a wide range of open source scripting 
technologies and offers improved performance. This release extends language 
support beyond Java&trade; technology by providing a rich set of features for 
C/C++, JavaScript&trade; and the Ruby language, including Ruby on Rails.</p> 
<p>NetBeans IDE 6.1 also contains all of the improvements made in 6.0 
including: the new smarter editor, next generation of the ground-breaking GUI 
builder (formerly known as Project Matisse), visual mobile designer, integrated 
profiler, and Java&trade; EE 5 support.</p> 
<p>One of the downloads available is an Early Access preview of support for 
PHP. Advance versions of new modules, such as a JavaScript debugger, support of 
ClearCase, AXIS, and Hibernate are available as separate plugins.</p> 
<p></p> </blockquote>  &nbsp; <br>

<h2>Balancing the view.</h2>  December 13, 2007 &ndash; 8:54 am 
<p>While I like Netbeans 6 and personally I am really happy with it having 
moved from Eclipse, there is, as always, a flip side to every coin so in the 
interests of balancing things,this post on the Java tutorials weblog is asking 
for votes to bring back the Beans Module that is missing from Netbeans 6.</p> 
<p>There are some interesting comments made as people place their vote and 
I&rsquo;d say the vote is overwhelming and we should be seeing the bean module 
in the upcoming update to NB6.</p>

<h2>NetBeans 6 goes live</h2>  December 5, 2007 &ndash; 10:36 am 
<p>NetBeans 6 has finally reached the full release version and is available for
download today.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that NetBeans 6 is an important release for the 
NetBeans team and I believe it is one of (if not the) best IDE&rsquo;s 
available for Java, Ruby and Ruby on Rails amongst others like the upcoming 
JavaFX.</p> 
<p>Reasons why I like NetBeans 6:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The UI is polished and extremely useable.</li> 
<li>The plugin interface is much better than the one in Eclipse.</li> 
<li>Getting the latest version is a very simple excercise and there are not 50 
different versions to have to decide from. (try looking for the WTP edition of 
Eclipse for example).</li> 
<li>It has a much better way of managing application settings &ndash; more 
like a normal app not one set per workspace.</li> 
<li>The files you work on are much easier to organise.</li> 
<li>Java, JavaFX, Ruby and Ruby on Rails apps can be developed in this IDE out 
of the box and the IDE does a very very impressive job of making your life easy.
</li> 
<li>The IDE is really customizable and the settings menu is easy to navigate.
</li> </ul> 
<p>As you may have guessed I have been using Eclipse and I have found NetBeans 
so much better. There&rsquo;s a handy plugin that will convert Eclipse apps 
over to netbeans &ndash; just in case you are worried about switching ;0)</p>

<h2>Netbeans 6 RC1 available.</h2>  November 15, 2007 &ndash; 1:59 pm 
<p>Netbeans 6 is getting closer to full release, RC1 is available to download 
fromnetbeans.org today.<br>
 I like NetBeans 6, as a ruby development IDE it is 
quite simply amazing and though I am an Aptana advocate even I have to admit 
that NetBeans does it better.</p> 
<p>Code completion is second to none and the features included are making 
NetBeans the IDE of choice for many people and I&rsquo;m fast becoming one of 
them. I still like Aptana&rsquo;s Javascript CSS and HTML handling so 
won&rsquo;t be giving it up just yet but for Ruby, Rails and Java, NetBeans 6 
is my tool of choice.</p> 
<p>NetBeans 6 is not NetBeans 5 with some new bits and bug fixes, this is a 
whole new development and it shows.</p>

<h2>Java administration tips for Ubuntu</h2>  August 30, 2007 &ndash; 8:09 am 
<p>If you are an Ubuntu user and you use Java you would benefit from some cool 
tips I&rsquo;ve found while browsing the Ubuntu forums of late.</p> 
<p>By default Ubuntu comes with a version of Java (jgc) that isn&rsquo;t 
Sun&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t a problem unless you are perhaps developing 
Java applications, in that case you might want to install the Sun JDK.&nbsp; 
This is done easily via the package manager, just search for sun jdk ad pick 
your version.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately despite installing Sun&rsquo;s jdk the Java system may not be 
fully utilising it.</p> 
<p><i><b>java -version</b></i> in a terminal session will show you the current 
version in use, and this should be the one you installed from the package 
manager.</p> 
<p>Now try <i><b>sudo update-alternatives &ndash;config java</b></i> in the 
terminal.<br>
This should produce a list of installed Java versions and there 
will be a * by the default one in use.&nbsp; Pick the number that corresponds 
to the version you want to use (or accept the current default and that will now 
become the default Java version for Ubuntu.</p> 
<p>This can be handy if you want to check your app in different versions of 
Java or develop to a specific version, or even switch to a different version to 
troubleshoot environment issues you suspect are Java related.</p>
