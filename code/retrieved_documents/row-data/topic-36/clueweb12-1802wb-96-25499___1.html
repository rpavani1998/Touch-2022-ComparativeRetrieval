<h1>Eclipse versus NetBeans -- Mac OS X runs both</h1> 
<p> Apr 29th, 2005 </p> 2005, eclipse, mac <br>

<p>Charles Ditzel (e-mail, blog), infamous Sun employee and vociferous critic 
ofEclipse on Mac OS X wrote recently that <i>&ldquo;The result is that many 
Eclipse developers have switched to NetBeans and others are beginning the 
migration to NetBeans by using both IDEs.&rdquo;</i>.</p> 
<p>Firstly, it&rsquo;s clear to see that Charles&rsquo; viewpoint is heavily 
biased towards NetBeans. The guy works for Sun Microsystems, he blogs about 
NetBeans as if it&rsquo;s the best project in the world, and clearly 
isn&rsquo;t interested in an impartial view. So take what he says with a pinch 
of salt at best.</p> 
<p>In reality, there are a number of Java IDEs out there, and each tends to 
have its own loyal following of developers. But in the bigger world, there are 
a number of developers who just use it to write code. There&rsquo;s several 
different development environments:Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, JBuilder and of 
courseNetBeans. What&rsquo;s more interesting is that there a number of 
commercial spin-offs, and of those,Rational Software Architect (formerly 
WebSphere Studio Application Developer) are both built on top of Eclipse, 
Borland has become an Eclipse srategic partner, and the BEA Weblogic Studio are 
Eclipse-based (or Eclipse-aligned) as well. It&rsquo;s not hard to wonder why 
that in areview of the four top IDEs (though, surprisingly, IntelliJ/IDEA 
wasn&rsquo;t reviewed), that Sun&rsquo;s Enterprise Studio came bottom of the 
four.</p> 
<p>But the main reason for eschewing Charles&rsquo; review of Eclipse vs 
NetBeans is his comments onEclipse on Mac OS X broken. I&rsquo;m sorry 
Charles&rsquo;, but that just isn&rsquo;t true. I&rsquo;ve been using Eclipse 
on Mac OS X since it came out, and I was spending my spare time as a tester for 
the Eclipse Mac OS X release before it became 2.1. I raised 280 bugs towards 
improving the quality of the application as a whole, and whilst I agree 
it&rsquo;s not quite there (it&rsquo;s not quite as &lsquo;polished&rsquo; as a 
normal Eclipse App), it&rsquo;s still perfectly usable. In fact, you seem to 
have surfed the bug reports for anything involving &lsquo;SWT&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Mac OS X&rsquo; and then linked them in your blog, rather than having an 
understanding about them; I don&rsquo;t see your name cropping up in any bug 
reports or comments.</p> 
<p>His main gripe is that Eclipse is bad because you can&rsquo;t create/run 
Swing apps in Eclipse on Mac OS X. This has actually been traced to a bug in 
the AWT implementation of the JVM, and the radar bug filed with Apple. (Radar 
is the name of Apple&rsquo;s bug-tracking system, in case you&rsquo;re 
interested.) It&rsquo;s also related to the fact that Suns JVM implementation 
(which Apple licenses) isn&rsquo;t sufficiently flexible to allow other GUI 
threads to interact with Swing, so if there&rsquo;s a bad boy in the crowd, 
it&rsquo;s still Swing, not Eclipse. Saying that X doesn&rsquo;t work with Y 
when Y just plain refuses to work with anything else is not a great way to win 
an argument.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s also a mistake in his blog about the fact that &lsquo;I can 
run the same code on any platform&rsquo;. Well, actually Charles, that 
isn&rsquo;t quite true. The Mac OS X download takes the form of a Mac OS X 
application; the Windows has a windows launcher. Granted, 99% of the code 
behind-the-covers is portable, but the bit at the front (the launcher) is 
different in both places. Guess what? That&rsquo;s exactly the same principle 
behind Eclipse. It too has the same set of plugins for the code base, of which 
99% is common; the 1% in Eclipse&rsquo;s case includes both the OS-specific 
launcher and also the SWT DLLs. In fact, the plugin architecture allows for 
multiple window providers and operating systems in the<i>same</i> install; so I 
have a shared Plugins directory which I actually share for both Windows and Mac 
environments. The only difference is that where a vanilla install of Eclipse 
for Windows will have a plugin for the Windows SWT, and the Mac has one for the 
Aqua SWT, I actually have both in the plugin directory.</p> 
<p>(On a side node, if we want to complain about installers; how about 
configuring your download process to get rid of the .gz extension? All browsers 
know about GZip decompression on the fly, with the result that when the file 
gets down, it&rsquo;s saved as NetBeans_4-1.dmg.gz, but it&rsquo;s been 
decompressed by my browser; so the OS refuses to open it. The Eclipse install 
takes the right &lsquo;Mac OS X&rsquo; approach, and provides it as a DMG, 
which can be dragged and dropped into the right place.)</p> 
<p>A less blinkered viewpoint about where Eclipse and NetBeans are heading in 
the community is fairly obvious; all you have to do is look to which companies 
are aligned with which environment:</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> NetBeans </dt> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>Sun</li> </ul> </dd> 
<dt> Eclipse </dt> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>Borland</li> 
<li>BEA and Sybase</li> 
<li>Scapa</li> 
<li>Actuate</li> 
<li>Wind River</li> 
<li>Computer Associates</li> 
<li>IBM</li> </ul> </dd> </dl> 
<p>If you also read between the lines, Oracle are leaning towards Eclipse; 
don&rsquo;t be surprised to see that they join in the not too distant future.
