<h2>Netbeans vs Eclipse &ndash; which one is better?</h2> 
<p>14<br>
April</p> 
<p>Netbeans and Eclipse are the two most popular Java IDEs. I've been learning 
Java for little over a year now and I would like to share my opinions about 
them. I use both Eclipse and Netbeans, for two different purposes. Tried 
IntelliJ and Oracle JDeveloper once, but JDeveloper is slow even in my PC (C2Q 
Q9550 2.83GHz, 4GB, Intel G45). IntelliJ looks shitty, but i has the best 
auto-compile and refactoring feature available out the. Unfortunately it wasn't 
free and the trial expired so i didn't get to test it that well. So I'm gonna 
post some opinions about Eclipse and Netbeans focusing on some specific 
criteria.</p> 
<p><strong>Speed</strong></p> 
<p>Well, many of us are under the impression that Eclipse is faster. That 
however, is arguable. In slower machines Eclipse works much better. I did some 
test on my own with both of them. The basic Netbeans Java package is slower 
than the basic eclipse J2EE package. But the reason for this is probably 
because Netbeans loads a lot more plugins than Eclipse does. The full Netbeans 
package is 380MB with all the bells and whistle, which supports pretty much 
anything out of the box, but the full Eclipse package (Eclipse doesn't have an 
official full package, so created a package with similar functionalities as 
Netbeans full package), well, about 1.3 GB. And if you try to load Eclipse with 
that many plugins, It'll eat up about 1 GB of memory instantly, and the loading 
time is, well, I've never managed to load Eclipse, because it crashes. On the 
other hand, Netbeans loads all of them pretty effortlessly.</p> 
<p><strong>Stabilty</strong></p> 
<p>There's no question about the stability of Eclipse. Of-course, sometimes 
the third-party plugins may cause it to crash. But the official packages are 
extremely stable. Although Eclipse did have a bug in the Helios release 
involving auto-complete, it was fixed in SR1. Netbeans however, isn't as rock 
solid as Eclipse. The previous releases frequently crashed, though the newer 
ones (after 6) almost never crash. So they're pretty stable right now.</p> 
<p><strong>Code Assistance</strong></p> 
<p>This is where Eclipse really triumphs. The autofix isn't present in 
Netbeans. Eclipse has a better refactoring support. So if you try to rename 
something, it won't mess up your whole code. Another thing is the auto-compile 
feature, which on the fly compiles your code as you type and gives you instant 
feedback on errors. Netbeans did try to implement something like this, but 
Eclipse is much better.</p> 
<p><strong>Usability</strong></p> 
<p>The usability of Eclipse is a hell. You'll have to spend more time 
configuring Eclipse, than working with your project. There are so many plugins 
for one task that the programmer is left confused. And the most ironic thing 
is, you're left on your own to choose the best plugin. Netbeans however, 
requires much less configuring, and in most of the cases, it configures itself, 
and configures itself correctly. Netbeans provides everything out-of-the-box, 
and integrates seamlessly with anything you throw at it.</p> 
<p><strong>User-view</strong></p> 
<p>Eclipse is more tool oriented, where Netbeans is more programmer oriented. 
It's easier to code using Netbeans. For example, if you want to create a JSF 
project, you can't do it using J2EE Project. You'll have to open a Dynamic Web 
Project to do this. These tool oriented view is sometimes very confusing. 
Netbeans however, is much more programmer oriented, and let's the IDE to shape 
itself how you think, instead of shaping your thoughts to match the IDE.</p> 
<p><strong>Plug-in Support</strong></p> 
<p>This is a trivial question. Eclipse is by far the best IDE in terms of 
plug-in support. It's essentially built on a plug-in oriented architecture. I'd 
say its second only to Firefox, which is not a IDE at all. So if you're doing a 
highly customized job, Eclipse will be your only choice. It has millions of 
plugins, though not all of them work well. Netbeans does have a plugin support, 
but the plug-in base is nothing compared to Netbeans. For example, if you want 
to develop Android applications, Eclipse may be your only choice.</p> 
<p><strong>Misc</strong><br>
 Eclipse requires you to write your Ant script by 
yourself. So if you need a custom build-file, but don't know Ant scripting, 
you're in trouble.</p> 
<p>Netbeans has an excellent Swing GUI designer (Matisse). Eclipse have some 
tools for GUI designing, but they're nothing compared to Matisse.</p> 
<p>The best Eclipse plugins may not always be free (for example Zend).</p> 
<p>Netbeans doesn't have any file import feature. It's very annoying sometimes.
</p> 
<p>Finally, which one do i prefer? Netbeans. Why? Because it's easier to use 
for me. Eclipse is somewhat too flexible for me. I'm new in Java and i really 
don't need that many features. Netbeans seem to provide everything i use 
out-of-the-box.</p> 
<p>Which one is better? Excellent question. But there's no answer. There's no 
clear winner here. Give both of them a try, and use the one you like the most. 
Although i prefer Netbeans, i use both of them, to harvest the strengths of 
both.</p> <br>

<p>Interesting comparison. Some of the criticisms aimed at eclipse could be 
mitigated by the environment that you develop in. If you&rsquo;re working in a 
company, there is likely to be someone to do all of that configuration stuff. 
The setup of eclipse will have specific instructions from the IT support 
people. Really, the issues with eclipse are more IT-oriented than 
development-oriented.</p> </li>

<p>If you trying to develop a web application in netbeans 6.8 and build and 
rebuild it so many times. It will soon give an error not on compile but on some 
other stuff like junit.</p> </li> </ul> <br>
