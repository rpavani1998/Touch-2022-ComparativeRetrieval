<b>Posts:</b> 186  Hi, <br>
<br>
The MPIDE provides an 
out-of-the-box, ready-to-use, instant-rewarding, stable and easy IDE to build 
projects on both chipKIT and Arduino platforms.<br>
<br>
But because chipKIT 
boards offer much more power in MHz, I/Os, memory,<em>IMHO</em> they deserve a 
more powerful IDE with all the modern niceties.<br>
<br>
I've been looking 
around; here's what I've found so far:<br>

<ul> 
<li>full <strong>plug-ins</strong> like Visual Micro for Visual Studio or AVR 
tool for Eclipse</li> 
<li><strong>Makefile</strong>, here, here and there but with many stability 
issues hard to solve because of<em>that</em> specific cryptic language,</li> 
<li><strong>Command-line</strong> Arduino IDE like the Ino project, which 
simulates the Arduino IDE pre-process and avoid the horrendous makefile.</li> 
</ul> <br>
The last two solutions could address a larger number of IDEs, 
although they require customisation.<br>
<br>
As all Mac users, Xcode is 
installed and ready to run on my MacBook. Before that, Xcode requires some 
settings, either astandard project or a template &mdash;or even minimal template
. Templates from Xcode 3 are not upward compatible with Xcode 4. <br>
<br>
What 
do you think? What features to consider? <br>
<br>
<br>

Currently we use a combination of the QT Creator IDE with MPIDE as a download 
tool. There has been some talk around here to customize the QT Creator IDE with 
the ability to talk to avrdude so that we can do 100% of our development in QT 
Creator.<br>
<br>
By around here, I mean pontech.com <br>

I don't understand this question. MPIDE is setup for 
chipKIT.<br>

<b>Posts:</b> 186  Here 
is a very interestingArduino plug-in for Eclipse. <br>
<br>
Since MPIDE goes 
closer to Arduino 1.0 and Eclipse is available on Windows / OS X / Linux, I 
hope the plug-in is going to address chipKIT also. <br>

<br><b>Posts:</b> 114  Oops. Should be &quot;Is there a chipKit setup for MPLAB 
X ?&quot;<br>
MPLAB is Microchip's IDE for PICs. Version 10 (&quot;X&quot;) is 
multiplatform and based on NetBeans. <br>

 MPLAB X is based on Netbeans. If it would be possible to do a really minimal 
implementation in netbeans, I would interested in making that happen.<br>

<br>That sounds great news <br>
<br>
I tried to install the Arduino plug-in but 
didn't mange to get it work properly.<br>
<br>
I'm considering now Ino, which 
simulates the hidden dirty work done by the standard Arduino IDE of 
pre-processing libraries, building, linking, and uploading.<br>
<br>
Although 
the standard IDE is fine and provides out-of-the-box, ready-to-use, 
instant-rewarding experience, I'm missing features for serious more 
development, such as: parameters tips, jump to definition, object hierarchy 
browser, refactoring among others. Also needed: a glimpse of debugging.<br>
<br>
I can tell<em><strong>how painful</strong></em> developing the Serial_LCD 
library has been. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, I don't want to deal with many 
different IDEs, each one with its own idiosyncrasies.<br>
<br>
Actually, I 
don't understand why each micro-controller board manufacturer supplies its own 
IDE. Wouldn't it be easier and cheaper to supply a plug-in for a standard IDE 
<br> <br>
So let's go for a NetBeans implementation. <br>

Yes, this is 
a great idea, but IMHO, java IDE suck (explicitive deleted). Don't get me 
wrong, netbeans or eclipse are both far superior to MPIDE. I think QT provides 
a better solution to the problem java tries to solve and QT Creator is an 
awesome IDE. So you see the dilemma, not one shoe fits all.<br>

You should go 
for it. But if ever have time to work on it I'll be using QT.<br>

I've been using 
the eclipse IDE for years as well as other java and non-java IDEs like Visual 
Studio, Netbeans, IntelliJ, etc. I don't think any of them &quot;suck&quot;. I 
can imagine that for an IDE to be as flexible as eclipse is across 
languages/platforms is quite a challenge. AFAIK, QT Designer has the luxury of 
only providing support for C++, whereas, eclipse/netbeans support multiple 
languages. Granted, that C++ is the primary concern for Arduino, it's still 
convenient for some of us that use multiple languages to have that kind of 
support within the same IDE <br>
