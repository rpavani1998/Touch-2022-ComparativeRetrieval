<h2>Enterprise Source Code &ndash; A Multi-Million Dollar Under-Utilized Asset
</h2>When most people think about a company&rsquo;s assets, source code 
doesn&rsquo;t show up on the list. Yet millions of dollars are spent every year 
to create and maintain code, often with little focus on leveraging existing 
code assets that are hiding somewhere in your organization. This is the reality 
for most large companies managing hundreds of millions of lines of code -- the 
majority of which was purpose-built to solve specific application problems. And 
most of that code is locked up in a source control management system (SCM) 
specific to an app or to an organization. &#8232;&#8232;<br>
<br>

<h2>APIs &ndash; Looking Around For Reference Info</h2>Today&rsquo;s 
applications frequently leverage API calls to other internal or external 
components. While some APIs are easy to understand, most are not. The typical 
API has little documentation and few good examples, so it can be frustrating 
and time consuming for people to figure out how to use them successfully.<br>

The easy answer to this problem would be to either enable people to see 
examples of how other people have already used an API or to provide visibility 
into the code behind the API. To accomplish this, developers would need an easy 
way to search for and view an API call within existing code stored in 
enterprise code repositories.&#8232;&#8232;Your<br>
<br>

<h2>IDE Won&rsquo;t Solve the Problem</h2>So you&rsquo;re probably thinking 
&ldquo;Gee, I thought that developers could already easily do this, 
right?&rdquo; While developers can leverage code search from within their local 
IDE, they are limited to seeing what&rsquo;s in their workspace. And getting 
visibility to code in other SCMs can even be more difficult. Further, because 
up to 80% of the code in apps today can come from open source projects, being 
able to extend the search capability to include open source projects that live 
outside the organization also becomes important.&#8232;&#8232;<br>
<br>

<h2>Code Search&nbsp; -&nbsp; Yes, They Do Make Tools For That</h2>There is 
one type of tool that could help you take better advantage of internal and 
external code: Enterprise Code Search. Enterprise Code Search (ECS) tools can 
index massive amounts of internal code from many different SCMs, providing 
developers with easy-to-use search tools that can display formatted code. ECS 
tools can search both internally-indexed code bases and external open source 
software repositories. These tools have pre-built adapters to connect to and 
index code from leading SCM products, and because they provide read-only 
access, can be implemented without impact to the actual SCM systems. And ECS 
tools can provide plug-ins for developer IDEs, further integrating code search 
into a developer&rsquo;s every day experience.<br>
<br>
ECS tools can help 
organizations leverage years of development investments to lower the cost of 
today&rsquo;s software development.&nbsp; So while some organizations may have 
already figured out how to wholesale reuse some of their code, every 
organization has the opportunity to help their development teams develop new 
applications faster by providing them greater visibility into existing 
enterprise code bases.  Tags:
