<h3> Thawing relationship between eclipse and&nbsp;netbean </h3>  Filed under: 
Uncategorized &mdash; ctrambler @ 12:24 pm <br>

<p>Java IDE camp used to be splited into two, and the ultimate sign of this 
split is conferences:EclipseCon for Eclipse camp, and JavaOne for the NetBeans 
camp. The line is very clearly drawn. Relation seems to take heading for the 
worse whenSun sent Eclipse a Dear John letter (Unfortunately I cannot find any 
link to Eclipse&rsquo;s reply). Underneath the diplomatic language is an 
undercurrent of disagreement. The talks that time seems to be to merge both 
Eclipse and NetBeans, &hellip; like pigs can fly!</p> 
<p>As the years passed and everyone grow older and mature, we all mellow. The 
invisible Berlin Wall between the two is showing signs of cracking. First sign:
Mattisse was ported to Eclipse. When that happens, I was watching for any signs 
from the NetBean (a.k.a. SUN) camp that it is not happy. That work was and is 
legal, but has the potential to irk NetBean. There was no negative noise of 
disapproval and I tell myself that is a good sign. It is clear that both might 
be moving towards coexistances, rather than merging. Personally, I prefer 
coexistance. There is nothing better than competition to deliver value to 
consumer, i.e. me.</p> 
<p>Now, we have more evidence that relationship had improved: We have a 
presentation on the upcoming JavaOne conference oncomparing Eclipse RCP 
platform and NetBeans platform. This is great news indeed. I know people had 
been quietly comparing the two. However, an open discussion is better.</p> 
<p>Of course, when the two camps talk, we can built on both experience 
for&nbsp; better platforms. The benefit from this is huge, since we are talking 
about the two most popular Java IDEs.</p>
