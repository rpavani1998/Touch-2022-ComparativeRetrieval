 From the Blogosphere  &quot;Java Is Dead, Long Live Java!&quot; 
&ndash; The Future of Java<br>
 Lightweight Frameworks Like Hibernate, Spring, 
and HiveMind are the Future of Java 
<p></p>  By: Bryan W. Taylor <br>
 Jan. 10, 2006 03:45 AM <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>It seems that lately lots of writers have been bashing Java. Some people 
seem to think that Java has stagnated, and that the 
&quot;hyper-enthusiasts&quot; have left. Well, the rest of us are just quietly 
coding on a platform that is more exciting than ever. Other technologies like 
Ruby, PHP, .NET, or AJAX might get more hype and acclaim lately, but hype 
aside, Java still produces the majority of innovation in the software 
profession.</p> 
<p>You can get a sense of Java's health by simply looking at how many projects 
are out there using Java. Pop on over to Sourceforge and look at the number of 
projects by language:
http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=160.</p> 
<p>Certainly Sourceforge is not the final measure, but it's a reasonable 
reality check. Anyway, you'll find 17300+ Java projects, the most of any 
language. That's more than PHP (12675), Ruby (425), and .NET (3094 C#, 347 
VB.Net) combined.</p> 
<p>Because of its prominence, Java gets a lot of attention and with 
it&nbsp;much criticism, some of it valid. What many may not realize is that 
some big breakthroughs have arrived and that the Java development landscape is 
solving important problems. Let's take a view of where Java is going to go in 
the next year or two as these ideas gain traction.</p> 
<p>The first big arena of innovation is the addition of scripting support. 
Some people rightly claim Ruby or Python is better the Java for some tasks. 
Groovy and Beanshell solve these same problems and will become a standard (in 
the JSR sense) part of the Java stack. Each offers something better than 
standalone scripting. Both integrate into a truly mixed environment with 
compiled bytecode and interpreted scripts interoperating smoothly. Beanshell's 
syntax offers as little surprise as possible for the Java developer and Groovy 
gives a Ruby-like syntactic efficiency, but can also be compiled to pure 
bytecode and reused seamlessly, a big improvement over JRuby or Jython.</p> 
<p>Second, the days of heavyweight frameworks are gone. J2EE-style EJBs are 
out. Now, the lightweight frameworks like Hibernate, Spring, and HiveMind are 
the future of Java. The heavy Struts of the past is being replaced with two new 
directions: Struts Shale based on JSF and Struts Ti is a wholesale merge with 
Webwork. These projects share a common idea that the framework should stay out 
of the way of your object model. EJB3 takes the same view.</p> 
<p>A third major innovation where Java leads is aspect-oriented programming 
(AOP). AOP will unclutter your code by moving &quot;cross-cutting&quot; 
concerns like logging and security to transparent method interceptors. AspectJ 
is the Rolls Royce for AOP, but Spring has lightweight AOP themes as does the 
new JBoss.</p> 
<p>Fourth, the PHP crowd had a legitimate gripe that banging out a simple web 
page took too much work if you were using JSP and Struts. But our templating 
solutions like Velocity, Freemarker, and now Groovy don't make you choose 
between ultralight text generation and powerful mid-tier solutions. Groovlets 
should make for some rapid servlet solutions. For those people who really like 
PHP, keep it: Java 1.6 makes it the reference implementation for the new web 
scripting language bindings, so you can do your web views in PHP and use Java 
for model and controller.</p> 
<p>Finally, Java's traditional strength in the tools arena just keeps 
increasing. Eclipse is the best IDE on the planet, and it appears that Eclipse 
has reached critical mass like Ant and JUnit did, in that people simply expect 
solutions that extend it. Eclipse's team coding capabilities for CVS and 
Subversion (via the Subclipse plugin) are first-rate. The refactoring and 
debugging support are top notch. Integration of standard tools like ant, 
compilers, JUnit, and javadocs are about as good as you can imagine.</p> 
<p>So perhaps the hyper-enthusiasts have left and the buzzword mongers will 
proclaim that Java is dead. If Java is &quot;dead,&quot; it's only because it 
was laid to rest so that a better, lighter, more agile, form of Java could 
replace it, so Long Live Java!</p>

 hey maciej, i faced the very same problem that you had 
faced(even i had a athlon1700 +512 mb ram). but after upgraded my ram to 1 gb, 
eclipse runs smoothly. eclipse is a ram guzzler for sure, but its necessity 
undermines everything else.</p>

<p>Hmm, Eclipse is the best. I`d say s/best/beast/ . Ever tried to run it ? 
For me its the sloooowest software i`ve used. And I have an athlon1700 + 512 
MB. I have yet to see a fast and slick java application which has nice features 
and doesn`t eat my whole ram.</p>

<p>Nice article; but one niggling point: your assertion that Eclipse &quot;is 
the best IDE on the planet&quot;. Those of us that use Idea would beg to differ.

<p>Classic JDJ article: a misinformed pile of google scrapings that appears to 
have been stitched together at the last minute. The future of Java is EJB 3.0 
and Java 5.0 with Facelets and JSF. EJB 3.0 embodies Hibernate. Java 5.0 
supports aspect-oriented features. JSF replaces Struts and Facelets replace 
Tapestry and other frameworks with a standard. What these technologies have in 
common is the mind-boggling simplicity of using them. If you want to write 
about the future of Java you should look at the new features and where they are 
going with it.</p>

<p>Several people take issue with my point that &quot;Eclipse is the best IDE 
on the planet&quot;. No one who objected had any rebutal to the reason I gave 
why Eclipse is the best: it has reached critical mass as an open source 
extensible platform whose community is assuring that all important tools work 
with it.</p> 
<p>Anonymous Kuhirt threw us a barb: &quot;afraid of .NET, are we?&quot; Yes, 
very much so. For two primary reasons: (a) vendor lock-in and (b) security. The 
java community has embraced open standards and open source, and Microsoft 
simply doesn't offer that. I don't see much traffic crossing that divide in 
either direction.</p> 
<p>Finally, some people seem to think that because I'm pro-Java, I advocate it 
as the one-size fits all language. Of course, I never said that. In fact, my 
first point about groovy and beanshell filling a gap pretty much guarantees 
that I don't think programming is a one size fits all task. The same goes when 
I touted PHP interoperability. It would be hard for me to argue against C being 
the right tool for some tasks, since java and my OS are all written in it. C is 
great for performance critical tasks, and Java plays along with C via JNI as 
Eclipse's SWT proves. Sometimes you do need to control memory use more than 
Java allows. But choosing C without specific evidence that you need the extra 
performance is simply a form of premature optimization. In most enterprise 
settings, where time to market and long term maintainability drive the 
economics, it is an very wrong choice.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with the article except that it has no stuff just fluff. 
Everything is old news and provide no meaty support for personal opinions. I 
think its recieving so much flake not because people disagree generally to the 
stand points, but because we really so seldom see such a unprofessional article 
being written.</p>

<p>Eclipse the best IDE on the Planet??? Its great, but I wouldn't say best. 
Personally I prefer IDEA, even thought I use eclipse on a day to day basis 
(More than Idea) because its the company standard. Some people think Visual 
Studio is King, which is also justifiable. I don't wanna get into a fanatic 
religious war on IDEs, but I'm just annoyed by unsupported claims. It totally 
takes away the credibility of the whole article (even though the article is not 
related).</p>

<p>&quot;Java remains at the top today and for at least then next few 
years&quot;</p> 
<p>This is exacly the self-reassurance I was talking about. The &quot;rejoice 
- we're at the top&quot; feeling (afraid of .NET, are we?). However, being at 
the &quot;top&quot; does lead only one way: down<br>
 (BTW: there are areas 
where COBOL is still at the &quot;top&quot;, too. Not because of technological 
merits and active development, but because of huge amounts of code written in 
the times where people thought about COBOL like you think about Java nowadays).
</p> 
<p>As someone else said once (I forgot the name): &quot;If your only tool is a 
hammer, every problem looks like a nail.&quot;<br>
 Likewise if everything you 
know and care about is Java, you have to treat every task within the limits of 
Java. However, I can easily name you tasks where Java would be far from a good 
choice - especially if you step out of this year's hype word collection (AJAX, 
Spring, etc.): You'll find that Java is by no means the end of all and that far 
from all shortcomings has been addressed successfully.</p> 
<p>Development like Java 1.5 (mostly syntactic sugar) and popular add-ons to 
Java (techniques / librarie) like AOP, Hibernate are in fact band-aids, 
covering shortcoming of Java which add up over time, giving Java that 
&quot;crufty&quot; feeling it has.</p> 
<p>And last but not least - if you only know and care about Java (with that 
elitistic feeling of &quot;oh, but we are at the top&quot;), you'll be 
condemned to re-invent solutions / techniques which have been here long before 
..</p>

<p>As the author... I'd like to respond to some of the comments.</p> 
<p>Anonymous Kuhirt wrote &quot;Only people admitting that there are 
shortcomings and who are willing to look over the (Java) fence are able to keep 
Java from becoming the next Cobol).&quot; It appears he didn't understand that 
this is the theme of the article. Java remains at the top today and for at 
least then next few years precisely because the Java community has seen and 
successfully addressed shortcomings.</p> 
<p>Mr. Frustrated with the Writer wrote &quot;The entire article focused 
primarily on web development and minor advances in the development 
experience.&quot; Only my fourth point and arguably half of part of my second 
point concern web development. My discussion of Groovy, Beanshell, Hibernate, 
Spring, Hivemind, AspectJ, and Eclipse do not concern web development.</p> 
<p>He also wrote &quot;AJAX is *not* a technology, it's a technique, and one, 
at that, which works very nicely with Java as the server element.&quot; Setting 
aside semantic bickering over the difference between a technology and a 
technique, I agree and said nothing to the contrary. The only reference to AJAX 
my the article concerns other commentators who over-hype AJAX in java bashing 
articles. Specifically, there was a widely circulated article in Business Week 
recently called something like &quot;Java? It's so Nineties&quot; that casts 
AJAX as one of the reasons for Java's supposed decline. This point is 
completely nonsense, to be sure, but the nonsense didn't originate from me.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 #8  Anonymous Kuhirt commented on 14 Jan 2006 <br>

<p></p>
<p>Sorry, this article is just stupid. E. g. the</p> 
<p>&quot;Eclipse is the best IDE&quot;<br>
 opinion.</p> 
<p>No matter how great something is, there is no &quot;best IDE&quot; the same 
way as there is no &quot;best language&quot;. Anybody who is seriously thinking 
that there is only one true way for every problem on the planet can't be taken 
serious and should stop littering websites with his wishfull thinking ..</p> 
<p>(I am a software engineer and use Java most of the time. I see such 
non-sense &quot;XY is the best&quot; comments as the self-reassurance of blind 
followers of XY<br>
 and most of the time it is a sure sign that XY's best days 
lay in the past. Only people admitting that there are shortcomings and who are 
willing to look over the (Java) fence are able to keep Java from becoming the 
next Cobol).</p> 
<p></p> <br>
 #7  Mr. Frustrated with the Writer commented on 13 Jan 2006 <br>

<p></p>
<p>The entire article focused primarily on web development and minor advances 
in the development experience. If nothing else, this would suggest that 
critic's complaint that innovation has left the language is true! All of the 
big development technologies and techniques that have become part of the Java 
world (Hibernate, Spring) have been ported quickly to other languages, leveling 
the court as far as language-supporting technologies are concerned. I was happy 
to see the changes that 1.5 brought along, especially generics since that's 
been a problem that had been solved far too long ago to leave out of Java. But 
as far as breakthroughs are concerned, I'm with the critics on this one. If I 
had to pose one challenge to the Java world, it would be to free us developers 
of some of the limitations of Java that don't exist with other languages; i.e. 
running in a JVM, we get access to such a limited memory space that anyone 
writing a memory-intensive server application is forced to work in another 
language - something I've met several times in my work.</p> 
<p>In all, though, what bothered me the most was the actual words of the 
article. I've unsubscribed from the JDJ for a reason (since they aparently 
fired all of their proofreaders)! AJAX is *not* a technology, it's a technique, 
and one, at that, which works very nicely with Java as the server element. 
&quot;Some people rightly claim Ruby or Python is better the Java for some 
tasks.&quot; - indeed.</p> 
<p>To the commenters, don't call &quot;long live Java&quot; as if you could 
predict the new languages and technologies on the horizon. Those who will hold 
strongly to their Java in good days and bad, as other stronger more innovative 
software paradigms come to life, will be left in the dust. Maintain your job 
security and adapt. Long live the next best platform.</p>

along, especially generics since that's been a problem that had been solved far 
too long ago to leave out of Java. But as far as breakthroughs are concerned, 
I'm with the critics on this one. If I had to pose one challenge to the Java

 Donald Fraser wrote: I 
am a Java advocate, but I have many gripes with the Java language. The sort of 
gripes I have are similar reasons why Java evolved out of C/C++ in the first 
place. For example memory not being released from objects after they have gone 
out of scope. The Java solution was to remove the responsibility of memory 
management from the programmer and place it in the JVM. There are many other 
things that Java improved on in the C/C++ language but there are many more 
things that the language still lacks. For example why can I still get null 
pointer exceptions? Bad programming! This problem can actually be solved by the 
language. Just take a look at the Eiffel programming language - it pioneered 
the concept of &quot;design by contract&quot; which solves boundary conditions 
and assignments to all parameters thus eliminating the null pointer exception 
problem along with a number of other problems. How abo... read more &amp;

of memory and all that it is because of the virtual machine, not because of the 
language. A language is just a BNF diagram specification which describes the 
syntax of the program, and all of its reserved words. What Java needs is a 
better (less memory and faster) implementation of the libraries it has and the 
virtual machine to run the programs. As an example, almost everyone who has
