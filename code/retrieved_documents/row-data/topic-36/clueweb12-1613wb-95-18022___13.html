<p>It&rsquo;s weird that bubble sort is the most famous sorting algorithm in 
practice since it is one of the worst approaches for data sorting. Why is 
bubble sort so famous? Perhaps because of its exotic name or because it is so 
easy to implement. First let&rsquo;s take a look on its nature.</p> 
<p>Bubble sort consists of comparing each pair of adjacent items. Then one of 
those two items is considered smaller (lighter) and if the lighter element is 
on the right side of its neighbour, they swap places. Thus the lightest element 
bubbles to the surface and at the end of each iteration it appears on the top. 
I&rsquo;ll try to explain this simple principle with some pictures.<br>
</p> 
<h3>1. Each two adjacent elements are compared</h3> 
<p><br>
In bubble sort we've to compare each two adjacent elements</p> 
<p>Here &ldquo;2&Prime; appears to be less than &ldquo;4&Prime;, so it is 
considered lighter and it continues to bubble to the surface (the front of the 
array).<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h3>2. Swap with heavier elements<br>
<br>
</h3> 
<p><br>
If heavier elements appear on the way we should swap them</p> 
<p>On his way to the surface the currently lightest item meets a heavier 
element. Then they swap places.<br>
</p> 
<h3>3. Move forward and swap with each heavier item<br>
<br>
</h3> 
<p><br>
Swapping is slow and that is the main reason not to use bubble sort</p>
<p>The problem with bubble sort is that you may have to swap a lot of elements.
<br></p> 
<h3>4. If there is a lighter element, then this item begins to bubble to the 
surface<br>
<br>
</h3> 
<p><br>
We can be sure that on each step the algorithm bubbles the lightest 
element so far</p> 
<p>If the currently lightest element meets another item that is lighter, then 
the newest currently lightest element starts to bubble to the top.<br>
</p> 
<h3>5. Finally the lightest element is on its place<br>
<br>
</h3> 
<p><br>
Finally the list begins to look sorted</p> 
<p>At the end of each iteration we can be sure that the lightest element is on 
the right place &ndash; at the beginning of the list.</p> 
<p>The problem is that this algorithm needs a tremendous number of comaprisons 
and as we know already this can be slow.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We can 
easily see how ineffective bubble sort is. Now the question remains &ndash; why 
is it so famous? Maybe indeed the answer lies in the simplicity of its 
implementation. Let&rsquo;s see how to implement bubble sort.<br>
</p> 
<h2>Implementation</h2> 
<p>Implementing bubble sort is easy. The question is how easy? Well, obviously 
after understanding the principles of this algorithm every developer, even a 
beginner, can implement it. Here&rsquo;s a PHP implementation of bubble sort.
<br></p> 
<pre>$input = array(6, 5, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4); function bubble_sort($arr) { 
$length = count($arr); for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $length; $i++) { for ($j = 
$length-1; $j &gt; $i; $j--) { if ($arr[$j] &lt; $arr[$j-1]) { $t = $arr[$j]; 
$arr[$j] = $arr[$j-1]; $arr[$j-1] = $t; } } } return $arr; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8 $output = bubble_sort($input);</pre> 
<p><br>
Clearly the implementation consists of few lines of code and two 
nested loops.<br>
</p> 
<h2>Complexity: Where&rsquo;s Bubble Sort Compared to Other Sorting Algorithms
<br></h2> 
<p>Compared to other sorting algorithm, bubble sort is really slow. Indeed the 
complexity of this algoritm is O(n2) which can&rsquo;t be worse. It&rsquo;s 
weird that the most well known sorting algorithm is the slowest one.</p> 
<p><br>
Bubble sort compared to quicksort, merge sort and heapsort in the 
average case</p> 
<p>Even for small values of n, the number of comparisons and swaps can be 
tremendous.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
Bubble sort is three times slower than quicksort even for n = 100, but 
it's easier to impelemnt</p> 
<p>Another problem is that most of the languages (libraries) have built-in 
sorting functions, that they don&rsquo;t make use of bubble sort and are faster 
for sure. So why a developer should implement bubble sort at all?<br>
</p> 
<h2>Application: 3 Cool Reasons To Use Bubble Sort</h2> 
<p>We saw that bubble sort is slow and ineffective, yet it is used in 
practice. Why? Is there any reason to use this slow, ineffective algorithm with 
weird name? Yes and here are some of them that might be helpful for any 
developer.<br>
</p> 
<h3>1. It is easy to implement</h3> 
<p>Definitely bubble sort is easier to implement than other 
&ldquo;complex&rdquo; sorting algorithms as quicksort. Bubble sort is easy to 
remember and easy to code and that&rsquo;s great instead of learning and 
remembering tons of code.<br>
</p> 
<h3>2. Because the library can&rsquo;t help</h3> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you work with JavaScript. Great, there you get array.sort() 
which can help for this: [3, 1, 2].sort(). But what would happen if you&rsquo;d 
rather like to sort more &ldquo;complex&rdquo; structures like &hellip; some 
DOM nodes. Here we have three LI nodes and we want to sort them in some order. 
Obviously you can&rsquo;t compare them with the &ldquo;&lt;&quot; operator, so 
we've to come up with some custom solution.<br>
</p> 
<pre>&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Click here to sort the list&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;node 3&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;node 1&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;node 
2&lt;/li&gt;</pre> 
<p><br>
Here sort() can&rsquo;t help us and we&rsquo;ve to code our own 
function. However we have only few elements (three in our case). Why not using 
bubble sort?<br>
</p> 
<h3>3. The list is almost sorted</h3> 
<p>One of the problems with bubble sort is that it consists of too much 
swapping, but what if we know that the list is almost sorted?<br>
</p> 
<pre>// almost sorted [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]</pre> 
<p><br>
We have to swap only 3 with 4. </p> 
<p>Note that in the best case bubble sort&rsquo;s complexity is O(n) &ndash; 
faster than quicksort&rsquo;s best case!<br>

<h3>Oliver Weiler replied on Wed, 2012/02/22 - 5:52am</h3> Really, stop 
teaching BubbleSort. Instead, focus on InsertionSort, which performs better in 
almost all situations, is faster than any sort for very small datasets and can 
be used e.g. in MergeSort to optimize it for small datasets. And, on top of 
that, I'd say it's as easy (if not easier) to grasp than BubbleSort.

<h3>Stoimen Popov replied on Wed, 2012/02/22 - 7:15am</h3> Actually both 
bubble sort and insertion sort have the same complexity - O(n*n) in the average 
case and O(n) in the best case. Which of them both are easier to implement, 
well it depends on the developer, but for sure both are quite easy.
