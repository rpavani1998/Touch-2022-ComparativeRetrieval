<h1><b>IntelliJ IDEA vs. Eclipse vs. NetBeans: my personal experience, Part II
</b></h1> 
<p>JavaFAQ Home <b>&raquo;&nbsp;Java Tools</b> </p> <br>

<h1>In the Part 1 of this article I summarized my personal experience with <i>
<b>Eclipse</b></i>, <b><i> NetBeans</i></b> and <b><i>JIdea</i></b> Java IDEs. 
In this, Part II, I will describe in details most important changes in JIdea 
since 4.x version.</h1> 
<p> IntelliJ IDEA become for me the number one tool not only in Java 
programming, but also HTML code writing and validation. JSP code mostly 
produces different kind of HTML pages and it is important to have all HTML code 
clean.</p> 
<p>We used that HTML code can be bad, not properly formatted, tags can be 
opened and never closed - modern browsers will swallow any HTML code and do the 
best...</p> 
<p>I although thought like this until I realized that many problems with my 
pages not due to errors in my Java code. No, it was bad HTML code. Strange 
looking pages, different layout in different browsers. You probably say - yes, 
yes I know, it is from browsers war. Not always really...</p> 
<p>It has much to do with bad habits on HTML code writing . A la FrontPage 
style...</p> 
<p>Things changed when I started to use JIDEA! Not only layout, even speed of 
page rendering increased dramatically when browsers switched from 
&quot;quirks&quot; to&nbsp; &quot;standards compliance&quot; mode.</p> 
<p>What is that - the &quot;quirks&quot; mode? And how it affects your JSP 
generated pages? I will not give the answer right now, you will find it in one 
of my next articles, because today we will look at IntelliJ IDEA new features.
</p> 
<p>The descriptions below is mostly from Idea's site. The list is not full, 
mostly listed below is what I thought important for Java, especially JSP 
developers.</p> 
<h2><b>JSP support </b><b><i>New</i></b></h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 has introduced an unprecedented level of support for JSP, 
including JSP-specific refactorings and support for JSP 2.0. Additionally, 
IntelliJ IDEA combines all of the support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into 
one seamless package, and provides full support for Java code inside JSP 
scriptlets. It is truly the best JSP editor in the world.</p> 
<p>All of IntelliJ IDEA's smart Java features, like refactorings, intentions, 
inspections, etc., work in scriptlet and declarations code:</p> 
<p>JSP 2.0 support </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Expression language (EL) support</li> 
<li>TagDir and TagFile support</li> 
<li>Support for JSP Document format (JSPX)</li> </ul> 
<p>JSP source-level debugging under WebSphere Application Server<br>
 JSP code 
formatting<br>
 Optimize Imports in JSP<br>
 Structure view for JSP files</p> 
<h2><b>HTML and XHTML support </b><b><i>New</i></b></h2> 
<p>The support for coding HTML and XHTML in IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 rivals, and in 
many cases surpasses, dedicated HTML tools. IntelliJ IDEA's intelligence really 
shines, helping developers quickly navigate and code HTML and XHTML in ways 
that are simply not possible with other tools.</p> 
<p>Code completion for tags (including auto-insertion of closing tags), 
attributes, styles, file references in hyperlinks, etc.<br>
 Find/highlight 
usages of tags, IDs, files, images, styles, etc.<br>
 Completion and validation 
for<em>width</em> and <em>height</em> attribute values in <em>img</em> tags<br>

 Code formatting according to HTML-specific Code Style (defined via a dedicated 
Code Style settings panel)<br>
 Matching brace highlighting + quick navigation 
to paired tag in HTML (Ctrl + ] / Ctrl + [)</p> 
<h3>HTML validation + several quick-fixes: </h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Wrong closing tag</li> 
<li>Missing closing tag</li> 
<li>Missing required attributes</li> 
<li>Invalid attributes or illegal attribute values</li> 
<li>Invalid local anchor</li> 
<li>Wrong references to files in hyperlinks (e.g., values of attributes href 
and src)</li> 
<li>Duplicate attributes</li> </ul> 
<h3>Syntax and error highlighting.</h3> 
<h3>Refactoring: </h3> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Rename file, anchor, etc.</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Move/Copy file</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Safe Delete file</p></li> </ul> 
<p>Show Applied Styles for Tag: Opens a tree-view of all styles that are 
applied to the tag by CSS<br>
 Quick doc (Ctrl + Q and Shift + F1) opens 
descriptions of HTML tags, attributes (with available values if defined), etc., 
from the official W3C standard:</p> 
<li> 
<p>HTML Colors and Fonts settings</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>HTML Structure View</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>HTML and XHTML on-demand validation</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Convert HTML into XHTML</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Surround with tag</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Show Content (Ctrl + Shift + I): </p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>on a tag - shows schema</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>on a file - shows file content</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>on an image - shows image</p></li> </ul> </li> 
<h2><b>CSS support</b></h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA 5.0's support for CSS enables developers to quickly and 
easily edit HTML styles with code-completion, error highlighting, finding 
references, and more. IntelliJ IDEA shows the power of an IDE once again, 
eliminating the need for developers to wade through CSS references all day, or 
to waste time debugging conflicting styles.</p> 
<h3>Code completion of CSS keywords, values, properties, classes, HTML IDs, 
syntax and error highlighting, on-the-fly validation and intention actions.</h3>
<li> 
<p>Missing or invalid closing braces</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Invalid selector format</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Invalid CSS properties</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Unused CSS class definitions</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Find/highlight usages</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Quick doc (Ctrl + Q and Shift + F1) opens description from the official W3C 
standard</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Unused CSS tags highlighting</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Code Folding</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Code formatting</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>CSS Structure view</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Refactoring: </p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Rename (including the opportunity to rename CSS file, class or ID 
attribute, etc., directly from within HTML)</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Move/Copy file</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Safe Delete file</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Extract inlined style block from HTML into a CSS file</p></li> </ul> </li> 
<h2>I18N support <b><i>New</i></b></h2> 
<p>The new <em>I18N</em> support provides multiple important features that 
make working on internationalization issues simple and convenient. With 
enhancements introduced in version 5.1, IntelliJ IDEA can be justly named the 
best<em>Java I18N / L10N</em> tool. </p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Auto-detection of resource bundles</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Convenient multi-language resource-bundle editor</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>I18N intention actions for smart internationalization of hard-coded <code>
String</code> literals, both simple and concateneted </p></li> 
<li> 
<p>@NonNls annotation &amp; intention action for excluding particular 
hard-coded strings from localization</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>I18N support for tag text in JSP files</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Resource properties completion in Java references</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Smart editing of <em>.properties</em> files</p></li> </ul> 
<h2>Debugger&nbsp; <b><i>New</i></b></h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 has several new debugging features, including some great 
breakpoint improvements to make debugging smarter, so developers can find bugs 
faster with less manual effort.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><em>Custom object display in debugger:</em> Most programmers write 
toString() methods so that objects are easier to browse and inspect during 
debugging. IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 makes it even easier and more powerful to 
customize any object display in the debugger, similar to the Alternate 
Collections View feature. It's especially useful to help inspect complex nested 
object structures.</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>JSP source-level debugging under WebSphere Application Server (5.1 &amp; 
6.0)</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Shortcut to setting up a logging breakpoint: Select the expression to log, 
thenShift + Click in the gutter</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Dependent breakpoints: The second breakpoint won't trigger unless the first 
breakpoint triggered</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Muting breakpoints with one button</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Smart step-into: Skip simple getters/setters</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Force step-over, ignoring breakpoints</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Drag and drop support for breakpoints</p></li> </ul> 
<h2>JavaScript Support <b><i>New</i></b></h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 is the first IDE to provide serious support for 
JavaScript, introducing many of the useful features Java developers have become 
accustomed to.</p> 
<p>Code completion for JavaScript keywords, variables, parameters and 
functions, including completion in HTML event handlers, etc.</p> 
<p>Syntax and error highlighting, including on-the-fly validation</p> 
<p>Highlighting for escape sequences in <code>String</code> literals</p> 
<h2>Enhancements in J2EE support <b><i>New</i></b></h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA 5.1 enhances its support for J2EE development with several 
new features:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Detection of unbound namespace prefix in JSP and XML</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Auto-import of tag libraries and XML schemas in JSP and XML</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Completion/renaming for references to Java methods from <em>
Hibernate/Spring/JSF</em> configuration files</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>JSP source-level debugging under WebSphere Application Server (5.1 &amp; 
6.0)</p></li> </ul> 
<h2>J2ME support</h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 supports developers for the increasingly popular J2ME 
platform with features to simplify configuring, compiling, running, and 
debugging J2ME modules with third-party toolkits and device emulators.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Support for mobile SDK MIDP1.0/MIDP2.0/NTT DoCoMo i-mode</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Dedicated J2ME module type added</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Building mobile applications (MIDlet suites)</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>J2ME Run/Debug configurations panel</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Run/Debug mobile phone emulators</p></li> </ul> 
<h2>Refactorings and Search</h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA is currently the undisputed leader in smart Java coding 
features. IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 sprints ahead even further with several additions 
and enhancements to its refactoring arsenal.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p><em>New Refactorings:</em> IntelliJ IDEA has more and better quality 
refactoring features than any other IDE, and IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 adds even more.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Move Method: A separate refactoring from Move Static Method, this new 
refactoring safely moves non-static methods from one class to another. It 
correctly handles inner classes and honors method overriding</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Inline Superclass</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Move Field to Local Scope: Converts a field to a local variable, reducing 
the complexity of the class</p></li> </ul> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Inline Constructor: When only this(...) is used</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Safe Delete: Removes class from class hierarchy</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Change Method Signature: This is one of IntelliJ IDEA's most powerful and 
useful refactorings, which saves a lot of time and tedious work. IntelliJ IDEA 
5.0 allows added parameters and exceptions to be propagated throughout the 
method call hierarchy, as well as the ability to add/remove the throws clause
</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Introduce... refactorings are smarter at guessing types (e.g. when there 
are unresolved references in an expression)</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Convert to Instance Method: Visibility options added</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Rename Class: Suggests to rename a GUI form if one is bound to it</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Find catch()es for thrown exceptions</p></li> </ul> 
<h2>Code Analysis</h2> 
<p>IntelliJ IDEA is currently the best tool available for static and 
on-the-fly code inspections. To get the same level of support from other tools 
would cost much more than IntelliJ IDEA itself! IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 brings code 
analysis to a whole new level, helping developers not only to understand code, 
but to find problems early, keep the design clean, and also to aid iterative 
design when used in combination with refactoring.</p> 
<p>That are all most important improvements and features. You can find more 
details on the feature you interested in if you go toJIdea home page or do 
further research on the Web.</p> 
<p>As I mentioned above I am going to write soon an article on importance of 
clean HTML code writing. I will do an overview on current situation with HTML 
standards and latest design trends (how to write most efficient HTML code). I 
thing it is important for those who works withJSP, servlets, web services and 
so on.</p> 
<p>You probably want that your customers see your application as a modern 
tool, not ugly formatted page from beginning of 90s of past century.</p>
