<h2>New e(fx)clipse Project</h2> 
<h3>Eclipse Tooling for JavaFX Project </h3> 
<p></p> 
<h3> Tom Schindl </h3> 
<h3> </h3> 
<p>Tom is cofounder and CEO of a software company named BestSolution.at 
located in Tyrol, Austria, Europe which provides consulting as well as contract 
services on Eclipse Technologies. Tom is committer on various Eclipse.org 
projects including central ones like Platform UI and e4. Tom was one of the 
people who wrote the first Prototype of what today became the &quot;Eclipse 4.x 
Application Platform&quot; the next generation of the Eclipse SDK is built on. 
He's a regular speaker at Eclipse and Java related conferences and events.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, Tom Schindl blogged about the  first release of a new 
project that provides Eclipse Tooling for JavaFX projects, 'e(fx)clipse.' 
JAXenter spoke to Tom Schindl about what niche he's aiming to fill with 
e(fx)clipse, and what the future might hold for this new project.</p> 
<p><strong>JAXenter:</strong> You recently announced a new project: 
e(fx)clipse. Can you give us an introduction to e(fx)clipse?</p> 
<p><strong>Tom Schindl:</strong> Before talking a bit about e(fx)clipse I 
think it is important to understand how e(fx)clipse came into existence. Some 
people might know that I'm part of the Eclipse 4 development team which is 
working on the next generation of the Eclipse SDK.</p> 
<p>At first I didn't start with what I later called e(fx)clipse but with the 
target to teach myself how I can create a DSL using theXtext 2.0 framework 
released as part of Eclipse Indigo, and was searching for a medium complex 
problem with a practical relevance.</p> 
<p>At the same time I was working on a proof of concept to make the Eclipse 4 
Application Platform using JavaFX as a UI-Library instead ofSWT, and so I had 
to edit JavaFX specific CSS-Files and missed an editor for the vendor 
extensions. It was a fortunate coincidence because now I had a practical use 
case for teaching myself a DSL.</p> 
<p>I think this bit of history is important when proceeding to talk about 
e(fx)clipse and what the future holds for it, because there's currently no 
commercial, or whatever, hidden agenda.</p> 
<p>I naturally welcome if a company thinks that a free and open source Eclipse 
Tooling for JavaFX 2.0 is needed to make it a success - leaving a big community 
like the one using Eclipse is probably not ideal! - but I don't have problems 
proceeding with it in my spare time because it provides enough technical fun 
that I'll keep going.</p> 
<p>Anyways, what do I think e(fx)clipse is, and what could it provide:</p> 
<p>e(fx)clipse's main target is to provide tooling to author JavaFX 2.0 
applications using the Eclipse IDE, so that developers currently using Eclipse 
as their primary IDE do not have to switch to e.g. NetBeans to get tooling 
support when they want to develop applications using this new UI-Toolkit.</p> 
<p>Because JavaFX 2.0 applications can be authored with a mixture of Java (or 
any other JVM-Language) and CSS, and Eclipse provides excellent Java-Tooling 
out of the box, the most important missing feature is a CSS-Editor who 
understands the CSS-Extension used by JavaFX 2.0.</p> 
<p>Another interesting fact is that I don't want e(fx)clipse to stop on the 
tooling front but also provide a runtime framework which supports developers 
writing medium to big modular JavaFX applications.</p> 
<p>The idea is to leverage the runtime platform used by Eclipse 4.1 named 
&quot;Eclipse 4 Application Platform&quot; to provide such a runtime layer. 
I've already shown in proof of concept implementations that the runtime 
platform used by Eclipse 4.1 can be used by none SWT-UI applications, so 
technically it is possible.</p> 
<p><strong>JAXenter:</strong> Can you give us some potential use cases for an 
Eclipse Tooling for JavaFX?</p> 
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> The target audience of the tooling part are naturally 
all developers who use Eclipse today to develop all kinds of Java-Applications 
(e.g. WTP, Virgo-Tooling, ...) and don't want to switch to another IDE to 
author their JavaFX-UIs, which would contradict the idea of an IDE a bit.</p> 
<p>The target audience of the runtime framework are developers who want to 
write modular JavaFX applications using a modern software architecture 
including OSGi, Dependency Injection and central application model. As far as I 
know there's no such framework available as of now, and it simply makes sense 
to leverage this solid application framework outside the Eclipse SDK project, 
instead of reinventing and reintegrating those technologies.</p> 
<p><strong>JAXenter:</strong> What functionality is already available in the 
0.0.1 release?</p> 
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> The only real feature the 0.0.1 release provides is 
an CSS-Editor which currently provides, besides the default CSS 2.1 attributes, 
those defined by JavaFX. There is some preliminary support for attribute values 
but it's not really sophisticated as of now.</p> 
<p><strong>JAXenter:</strong> What's the next step for the e(fx)clipse project?
</p> 
<p><strong>Tom:</strong> From a feature point of view:</p> 
<p>0.0.2: Will bring better attribute value proposal support</p> 
<p>0.0.3: Will bring validation support, improved outline view</p> 
<p>0.0.4: Will focus on e(fx)clipse runtime on top of the &quot;Eclipse 4 
Application Platform&quot; (the current biggest problem here is JavaFX itself 
because it is not designed with strong modularity, as defined by OSGi, in mind)
</p> 
<p>Out of scope for now is e.g. a WYSIWYG-Editor, which could be built in 
theory on top of WindowBuilder. It would require a big investment because - at 
least I - would have to make myself familiar with the WindowBuilder codebase.
</p> 
<p>Another interesting idea would be to develop a DSL using Xtext to author 
JavaFX applications, together with the XBase and Xtend2 introduced with Xtext 
2.0, this could lead to slick DSL integrated tightly into Eclipse and Java.</p> 
<p>From a project organization point of view:</p> 
<p>I currently plan to move the Core CSS-Editor codebase to the e4 project 
because Eclipse 4.x application developers currently face the same problem 
JavaFX devs do in Eclipse: They'll have to author CSS-Files with vendor 
specific extensions but have no tooling.</p> 
<p>Because I'm currently the one responsible for the Eclipse 4.x Tooling it 
makes sense to move the core over to Eclipse.org and proceed with the 
development of the core there.</p> 
<p>The e(fx)clipse code will be developed outside Eclipse.org on my personal 
github repository.</p>  Jessica Thornsby
