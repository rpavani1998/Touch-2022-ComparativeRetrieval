<h1> COP 2805 (Java II Project) Project #1 <br>
 Install and Practice Using 
Eclipse and NetBeans</h1> 
<h2>&nbsp;</h2> 
<h3> Due: <strong> by the <em>start</em> of class </strong> on the date shown 
on thesyllabus </h3> 
<h2> Description: </h2> 
<p> For this project you will install and then explore Eclipse and NetBeans 
JavaIDEs.&nbsp; In either case you will need to have installed the JDK too, 
which in turn includes aJRE. </p> 
<h2> Part I &mdash; Eclipse </h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Download and install he current release of Eclipse from eclipse.org
.&nbsp; Once you hit the download button you will see a choice of package 
bundles to download.&nbsp; For our class, choose either the Java or Java EE 
packages.
<p> Eclipse is easy to install on a Windows platform.&nbsp; You download the 
zip file for Eclipse and extract the contents into <code>C:\Program&nbsp;Files
</code>.&nbsp; This creates a new sub-directory <code>eclipse</code>.&nbsp; 
Open that folder and right-click on the file<code>eclipse.exe</code>.&nbsp; 
Choose<code>Copy</code>.&nbsp; Next, right-click on the <code>Start</code> 
button and click on<code>Open</code>.&nbsp; Next open <code>Programs</code>
.&nbsp; Finally right-click in this window and chose<code>Paste&nbsp;Shortcut
</code>.&nbsp; (You can add additional short-cuts to your desktop or the quick 
launch bar, if desired.)</p> 
<p> Eclipse is now installed and ready to use.&nbsp; Before getting started, 
it is a good idea to go to theHelp menu and select Check for Updates. </p> </li>
<li> Now launch Eclipse.&nbsp; It may ask a few questions such as where it 
should keep its files (the Eclipse<em>workspace</em>).&nbsp; You can put this 
anywhere you like.&nbsp; Personally I prefer to use either<code>
My&nbsp;Documents\Eclipse-workspace</code> or <code>C:\Temp\Eclipse-workspace
</code>, depending on if the computer is single user or multi-user.&nbsp; (You 
can click the button to make Eclipse remember your choice.)</li> 
<li> On the Welcome page go to Overview &rarr; Workbench Basics &rarr; 
Workbench User Guide &rarr; Getting Started.&nbsp; (This will give you an 
overview on how to Use and configure Eclipse.)
<p> After this go back to the Welcome page and chose Tutorials &rarr; Create 
Hello World Application.&nbsp; (This will provide a step by step instruction on 
how to create a Hello World application.)</p> 
<p> As of Eclipse Galileo (v3.5) the tutorials and samples are missing and the 
links on the welcome page don't work!&nbsp; Until that gets fixed, try this 
alternative tutorial: www.vogella.de/articles/Eclipse/article.html. </p> 
<p> If you lose the Welcome window, you can bring it back from the 
Help&rarr;Welcome menu.&nbsp; There are many other tutorials and guides you can 
read.&nbsp; Consider reading theCVS and ant tutorials.&nbsp; You can find these 
in the Workbench User Guide.</p> 
<p> You can  read the Eclipse Documentation online, especially the <em>
Workbench User Guide</em> and the <em>Java Development User Guide</em>. </p>
</li> 
<li> Eclipse supports <em>plug-ins</em>, many of which are freely 
available.&nbsp; This are in reality<code>jar</code> files placed into the 
Eclipse install directory.&nbsp; There are hundreds available to extend Eclipse 
with additional functionality, such asXML editors, <code>Junit</code> test case 
editors,UML GUI drawing tools (that generate Java code for you), and Java EE 
tools.
<p> A collection of these projects useful for Java and Java&nbsp;EE 
development has been bundled together under the nameGalileo, which is what you 
have installed.&nbsp; To install other Eclipse plug-ins:</p> 
<ol> 
<li> Under the Help menu, click on <code>Install New Software...</code>.&nbsp; 
Now tell Eclipse where to look for the new plug-ins.&nbsp; You should selectThe 
Eclipse Project Updates -<em>URL</em>, but to add some third party plug-in you 
need to add their site to the list, bu clicking on theAdd... button.&nbsp; Then 
you can select that site.&nbsp; You can also pickGalileo (the current Eclipse 
release name at the time of this writing) to install additional projects not 
included with your installer bundle.</li> 
<li> On the bottom of the window are a bunch of check boxes, for things such as
Only show the latest versions and hide items that are already installed.&nbsp; 
I would check all these items to limit the list of available software to only 
the plug-ins you are actually interested in seeing.</li> 
<li> Check the check-box next to the items you want (and don't already have 
installed), and then click on the<code>Install...</code> button.&nbsp; For 
example, try adding the twoUML2 projects (under modeling in the Galileo release 
site), and clickNext.&nbsp; This shows a summary of all the items that will be 
installed based on your choices.&nbsp; ClickNext show the license screen; be 
sure to select theI agree ... button, then click on the Finish button to start 
the install.</li> </ol> 
<p> Feel free to explore other available plug-ins.&nbsp; Even more plug-ins 
can be found at www.EclipsePluginCentral.com.&nbsp; (Warning: You should learn 
the basic Eclipse platform first, because adding plug-ins complicates the user 
interface.)</p> </li> 
<li> Once plug-ins are installed, you will want to keep them up to date.&nbsp; 
Just selectCheck for Updates from the Help menu. </li> 
<li> You can explore the preferences and make a few changes, but don't make 
too many changes until you have learned Eclipse better (or the tutorials won't 
match what you see!).</li> 
<li> Explore the other features of Eclipse.&nbsp; this is the whole point of 
this project, so spend some time trying stuff out.</li> 
<li> Start a new Java project, add a new class <code>Hello</code>.&nbsp; You 
should see a new file<code>Hello.java</code> in the Package Explorer 
window.&nbsp; Right-click on it and chose open, and create another hello world 
(or other simple) application.&nbsp; Your application should not be identical 
with the tutorial; make yours say something such asHello from the world of 
Eclipse!.&nbsp; Don't forget to add appropriate comments (and to delete 
pointless comments that Eclipse may insert automatically for you).</li> </ol> 
<h2> Part II &mdash; NetBeans </h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Download and install NetBeans.&nbsp; (Note: There is a Java JDK+NetBeans 
bundle you can download when you install the JavaJDK.)&nbsp; As with eclipse 
there are bundles of plug-ins you can use.&nbsp; For our purposes you should 
download either theJava bundle or the All bundle.&nbsp; Note this includes a 
JavaEE server <em>glassfish</em>, version 2.&nbsp; It also includes a 
pre-release of version 3; you need not install that.</li> 
<li> After the install is complete, you will want to update your 
software.&nbsp; Use theHelp&rarr;Check for Update to do this. </li> 
<li> You can read on-line tutorials and documentation from www.netbeans.org/kb/
.&nbsp; Feel free to read those but at least read theNetBeans IDE Java Quick 
Start Tutorial; and the Developing and Deploying General Java Applications 
guides.&nbsp; You may also find some of the video tutorials useful, such as 
Java Editing in NetBeans IDE 6.8. </li> 
<li> Explore the features of NetBeans.&nbsp; You should spend some time doing 
this, since learning to use theIDE is the whole point of this project.&nbsp; 
Feel free to explore and change the preferences, but don't change too much at 
first; you want the settings to match the tutorials!</li> 
<li> Create a simple Hello World type of Java application using 
NetBeans.&nbsp; Your application should say something such asHello from the 
world of NetBeans!.&nbsp; Be sure to add appropriate comments (and delete any 
empty or pointless comments that NetBeans may automatically add).</li> 
<li> To create a new Java application using NetBeans, Use the file menu and 
click onNew Project....&nbsp; Next select Java Application from the Java 
category, and clickNext. 
<p> Give your project a useful name (e.g., <code>hello</code>), and pick a 
name for the class that will be generated (e.g.,<code>hello.Hello</code>
).&nbsp; Note the NetBeans automatically puts your classes in a package named 
after the project.&nbsp; That is fine, or you could name the main class simply
<code>Hello</code> to put it in the default, nameless package.&nbsp; Leave Set 
as Main Project selected, and click Finish. </p> </li> </ol> 
<h2> To be turned in: </h2> 
<p> A copy of your Java source code from the Hello World programs you created 
in steps I.8 and II.6.&nbsp; You can send as email to (preferred).&nbsp; If 
email is a problem for some reason, you may turn in a hard-copy.&nbsp; In this 
case the pages should be readable, dated, and stapled together.&nbsp; Your name 
should appear on the first page.</p> 
<p> Please see your syllabus for more information about projects, about 
submitting projects. </p>
