<h2> Eclipse vs NetBeans </h2> <br>
<br>

<p>Eclipse vs NetBeans &hellip;On which side are you on? Let us know which IDE 
you think is better and why.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Think of Java IDEs and two names that will come up are Eclipse and 
NetBeans. I have been using NetBeans for many years now and Eclipse has been a 
more recent addition to my Java armory. I have enjoyed working with both tools 
and as such don&rsquo;t have a clear favorite. I prefer NetBeans a little more 
than Eclipse as I have been using it longer and am more comfortable with it.</p>
<p>The thing I am most surprised about is how rapidly Eclipse has grown and 
how it has well and truly eclipsed NetBeans over the past year or so.</p> 
<p>In the article: <strong>Migrating to Eclipse: A developer&rsquo;s guide to 
evaluating Eclipse vs. Netbeans</strong>, the author shows the differences 
between the two IDEs.</p> 
<p>Just Eclipse or Eclipse in its WSAD avatar or MyEclipseIDE avatar is 
definitely good but hey..is it so good that nobody wants to be talk of NetBeans 
these days??? I haven&rsquo;t as yet tried out the new NetBeans 4 Beta 2 but I 
do hope it is very good. So that the competition between Eclipse and NetBeans 
stays fierce and there is no clear winner.</p> 
<p>The end user gets two very good IDEs.</p> 
<p>* Apr08 Update &ndash; Do have a look at this new comparison of JDeveloper, 
Eclipse and NetBeans</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big NetBeans geek, and ever since 6.* it&rsquo;s easily been my 
IDE of choice. I prefer programming in Java when I have my druthers, and the 
GUI builder makes it a breeze to make graphical Java applications (I 
can&rsquo;t stress how useful the GUI builder is). NetBeans is easier to learn 
and very simple to create a new project in, either from existing sources or 
from scratch. On other IDE&rsquo;s I might need an hour to figure out how to 
get &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; to compile if I haven&rsquo;t run it in a while. 
NetBeans is set up to work with multiple programming languages, and the 
learning curve is shallow, so I can do just about anything I need to (except 
for Perl or Matlab, which probably should be avoided anyway). Oh, and SVN 
support built in is pretty sweet, too (though I seem to have trouble getting my 
Windows Vista machine to connect to anything with remote ssh, I don&rsquo;t 
think that&rsquo;s a NetBeans issue).<br>
 I realize it&rsquo;s not as modular 
as Eclipse, but I have not yet run into the problem that I can&rsquo;t solve 
with it. Eclipse is more popular so I expect more people to sing its praises 
just because they have more experience with it and know how to do the snazzy 
things with it that NetBeans hasn&rsquo;t caught up to yet. But NetBeans is 
continuing to grow rapidly, and I expect it will bridge the gap when 7 comes 
around. </p> </li>
