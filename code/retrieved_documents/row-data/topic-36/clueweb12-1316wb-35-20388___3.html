<h1><b>Java: IDEs</b></h1> 
<p>JavaFAQ Home <b>&raquo;&nbsp;Java Installation, tunning, options...</b> </p>
<br><br>

<p>One of the most efficient ways to produce programs is to use an <b>IDE 
(Integrated Development Environment)</b>. Why aren't they used more in an 
educational setting? Probably the main reason is that it takes time to learn 
the tool, time that instructors feel is not central to learning programming. 
They also hide details that may be important to learn about. Once you know how 
to do everything on your own, it's easier to understand and use these systems.
</p> 
<h4>Full-strength IDEs</h4> 
<p>These provide extensive programming support for editing, building GUI 
interfaces, project management, debugging, etc. These offer far more than is 
required by the student Java programmer, and may be a barrier to learning Java 
because there is a lot to learn about how to use them.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> NetBeans </dt> 
<dd> A free, open-source, IDE is available from Sun at www.netbeans.org. This 
is a good choice for students because of the good GUI form editor and the 
editing and debugging facilities.. SeeNetBeans IDE for more information. 
java.sun.com has a nice bundle of NetBeans with the JDK. If you don't install 
the bundle, you must install the JDK first.
<p>Version 4.0 (Java 5 (1.5)) is better than  version 3.6 (Java 1.4), BUT it 
has a bug that prevents it from reading console input. If your programs are GUI 
based, and/or need Java 5 features, use NetBeans 4.0.</p> </dd> 
<dt> Eclipse </dt> 
<dd> IBM's free Eclipse IDE,  www.eclipse.org, is popular, and is the first 
choice of many professionals. It supports the non-standard SWT GUI library.</dd>
<dt> JBuilder </dt> 
<dd> Borland's JBuilder ( www.borland.com) is good and the JBuilder 2005 
Foundation Edition seems to be free. See free download. </dd> 
<dt> Others </dt> 
<dd> There are other IDEs, but most of these aren't suitable for student 
programs.
<ul> 
<li>IntelliJ IDEA is reportedly excellent, but expensive. It gets more 
favorable reviews by everyone who has used it than any other IDE. There is a 
$99 academic price.</li> 
<li>Don't use Microsoft's Visual J++. Other parts of their Visual .NET Studio 
may be good, but they have never provided good Java support. Also, steer clear 
of Symantec's Visual Cafe for Java, which is generally given poor reviews.</li> 
</ul> </dd> </dl> 
<h4>Half-strength IDEs</h4> 
<p>These are simpler to use for small projects, but typically don't have 
nearly as many features, eg, no graphical user interface editor. Not all have 
been updated to Java 5 the last time I looked, so check before downloading.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> jGRASP </dt> 
<dd> Many like it. The Control Structure Diagramming is nice. Easy to install. 
Free.
<p>To enable <b>Java 5 features</b>, start with the Compiler menu: <br>
 
Compiler &gt; Compiler Settings &gt; Workspace &gt; Compiler (Tab) &gt; 
Environment (Tab)<br>
 then choose &quot;j2sdk(1.5) (prefer JDK 
compiler)&quot;, and click the<i>Use</i> button, then <i>OK</i>. </p> URL: 
www.jgrasp.org. </dd> 
<dt> DrJava </dt> 
<dd> A popular, simple, free development system. It enforces indentation and 
allows immediate evaluation of expressions. Java 5 seems to be suported in 
recent beta versions.drjava.org. </dd> 
<dt> Others </dt> 
<dd> 
<ul> 
<li>JCreator (www.jcreator.com) - Free and &quot;Pro&quot; versions. A number 
of students have used this. Not updated to Java 5 as of 2004-12-12.</li> 
<li>Gel, free from  www.gexperts.com is another possible student-level IDE. 
I've never used it. Not updated to Java 5 as of 2005-01-20.</li> 
<li>JavaBeginner from  www.javatoolsoft.com. I haven't taken a look at this 
relatively new offering, and at $50, I probably will wait to hear what others 
say first. Not updated to Java 5 as of 2004-12-12.</li> 
<li>CodeGuide (www.omnicore.com - $49 student price, free trial, Java 5. </li> 
<li>BlueJ (www.bluej.org) - Used in some intro courses, but programs use a 
non-standard interface and it doesn't produce real java programs.</li> 
<li>And many more... </li> </ul> </dd> </dl> 
<h4>Editors that run javac</h4> 
<p>Some programming editors will compile Java by linking to Sun's JDK.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> jEdit </dt> 
<dd> Free, open-source, and good. This is my favorite editor. Has full set of 
plugins, eg to indent the source and compile.www.jedit.org. </dd> 
<dt> TextPad </dt> 
<dd> Good, but doesn't indent program. Has brace matching feature. Pay, but 
can continue to use trial version with nags. If the Java SDK is installed 
first, TextPad will allow compilation of Java programs from the editor.
