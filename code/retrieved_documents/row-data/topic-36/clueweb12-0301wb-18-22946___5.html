<h2>RubyMine: A New &ldquo;Intelligent&rdquo; Ruby IDE Built on IntellJ</h2> 
<p>By Peter Cooper / November 4, 2008</p> 
<p>RubyMine is an all new IDE for Ruby and Rails developers, developed by 
JetBrains (best known for Java IDE IntelliJ IDEA). RubyMine is built upon the 
IntelliJ IDEA platform and brings together all of the essentialfeatures you'd 
expect of an IDE (editor, debugging tools, source control integration, code 
completion, and so forth) along with lots of extra goodies specific to Ruby, 
such as GUI-based support for RSpec and Test::Unit.</p> 
<p>The current release of RubyMine is billed as a &quot;Public Preview&quot; 
with a full release set for Q1 2009. This public preview is free to use for 30 
days and JetBrains are keen to elicit feedback ontheir RubyMine forum in that 
time. As a commercial developer tools vendor, I suspect JetBrains will most be 
charging for RubyMine when it's finalized. The pricing for IntelliJ IDEA is 
&pound;450 ($599 - oddly) for a &quot;commercial license&quot; and &pound;187 
(or $249) for a &quot;personal license&quot; - just to give you an idea of the 
level JetBrains operates at.</p> 
<p>On a casual tryout of RubyMine, I found it to be a little smoother than 
Eclipse based IDEs, and although it's clearly not a fully native OS X 
application (in terms of widgets) it looks pretty good. It took several minutes 
for my first Ruby project to be created as it was busy parsing all the Ruby 
files on my system for some reason, but once this was done, further projects 
were created instantly. Up and running, the IDE seemed to do the trick, but I 
didn't go too far as I'm not a big fan of IDE-based development. This was on OS 
X only, so your mileage may vary.</p> 
<p>In any case, it's interesting to see another &quot;everything but the 
kitchen sink&quot; cross-platform Ruby IDE to compete withRadRails and NetBeans
, but if RubyMine becomes a commercial application priced similarly to IntelliJ 
IDEA, I can't see it becoming popular except with devoted IDEA users migrating 
to Ruby, but hopefully JetBrains will pull something interesting out of the bag 
to make it a more interesting proposition.</p>

<p>The latest version of Netbeans is very, very good when it comes to Ruby 
support. I think it will be tough for a commercial product to get significant 
market share.</p> </li>

<p>The pricing of RubyMine wasn't officially announced yet, but I can say that 
the price of RubyMine will be much closer to the price of TextMate rather than 
IntelliJ IDEA.</p> </li>

<p>I use Netbeans for my latest Ruby project. It's better then Textmate but 
usability (code completion) is a complete failure. It just get's in the way.</p>
<p>All the Eclipse based IDEs are IMHO not stable enough (at least when using 
a Mac).</p> 
<p>I have been using IntelliJ IDEA for 6 years now and it's clearly the best 
IDE for Java development.</p> </li>

<p>This is worth watching. IntelliJ IDEA is the best Java IDE around, period. 
Strike that, IDEA is one of the best editors for any supported languages. $249 
may sound steep, but it's worth every cent.</p> 
<p>If you're paid for your coding time there's no reason not to invest some of 
it back into professional tools.</p> 
<p>What to expect: a decent, consistent editor. One thing about Eclipse that 
bothers me to madness is how inconsistent editors can be. Every plugin 
implement a new editor, with new and completely inconsistent behaviours. Tabs 
to spaces? Indenting? Each editor behaves differently. In IDEA this isn't a 
problem, the editor behaves consistently in all supported languages.</p> 
<p>Also, code inspections. IDEA has over 900 inspections for Java, and while 
Ruby support is nowhere near that, I expect it to grow with time. With JRuby 
built in, I expect to soon be able to write Ruby inspections in Ruby itself.</p>

<p>At first I thought this had something to do with RedMine. I actually 
thought the latest tracking system they were using for Ruby itself was called 
RubyMine, but I guess it's Ruby-RedMine.</p> </li>

<p>&quot;Because not all those products will include all the functionality of 
IntelliJ IDEA, they can be much less expensive, and we can choose the price 
based on the target market. And developers don't get the stuff they don't care 
about. The new products can be much slimmer, lighter, and easier to get started 
with.&quot;<br>

<p>I just wish they'd develop RubyMine using Cocoa. I'd really like to see 
Textmate to evolve into a generic IDE for various languages with debugger and 
code hinting support. Hurry the @#$% up! Enough already with this hold up for 
TM 2.</p> </li>

<p>Just gave RubyMine a spin in both Linux and Windows...</p> 
<p>I am a huge Netbeans fan but cannot help be very impressed by RubyMine. My 
congratulations to the developers!</p> 
<p>Lets hope the price is attractive enough to warrant an impulse purchase 
(hint hint).</p> </li>

<p>RubyMine sounds interesting. If it's not a native Cocoa application, what's 
it based on then? I really like NetBeans and its Ruby features are really 
great, but being a Java application makes it painfully slow sometimes, so that 
I went back to TextMate some time ago.</p> </li>

<p>This is exciting news. IntelliJ IDEA beats the other editors hands-down in 
terms of speed, refactoring, ease of use and functionality (IMO). (Same goes 
for ReSharper for .NET development).</p> 
<p>Building it on Java (instead of Cocoa) allows them to leverage Java 
components from their IDEA platform and the fantastic development skills they 
already have in the company. I don't see a good reason to change that.</p> 
<p>One to watch out for!</p> </li>

<p>Does it support Linux 64 bits ?<br>
 What is the price of TextMate ? </p> 
<p>Besides that if the support of git is really good I will definitely 
consider using it.</p> </li>

<p>I have been using IntelliJ IDEA for years, since I switched from a Borland 
IDE, and then tried NetBeans and Eclipse and hated them both. As I moved to 
Rails 16 months ago, I tried the IDEA Rails plugin, but found it just ok. I 
also have used Apatana (fka RadRails) and while it has gotten better, it's 
clunky Eclipse baggage is very apparent.</p> 
<p>IDEA is simply a different product than most IDEs. It works with you, not 
against you. I hear a lot of people who use TextMate for Rails, and it reminds 
me of a guy I worked with in 1990 who used vi to develop the visual text editor 
for the development environment my company sold. I had nothing but respect for 
his aptitude and supreme vi skills, but at some level it just seemed wrong. (He 
told me later that in addition to normal shortcuts for exiting the editor, you 
could also do :q! like in vi :-).</p> 
<p>Java was best done in emacs for the first four or 5 of its years. But as 
projects get bigger, and the language supported more libraries, and more 
complicated features and so on, an IDE was pretty much essential. I think an 
IDE represents a step of maturation and stability of a language and environment 
that makes it feasible to create a useful and complete IDE.</p> 
<p>That IntelliJ has pursued their new IDE is a great thing, not just because 
there are better options for those of us who need more than a fancy text 
editor, but also because it means Rails is getting more real.</p> 
<p>(What will be really cool, of course, will be when the first IDE for Rails 
is written in Ruby ... and it is fast and stable).</p> </li> </ol>
