<h2>Finally, Scala IDE is enterprise ready</h2> 
<h3>Scala IDE V2.0 for Eclipse released</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>After nine months of hard grafting, the Scala IDE team are proud to 
announce that their second major release of the Scala plugin for the Eclipse 
environment is now complete and readily available.</p> 
<p>Back in April, Scala Solutions'  Iulian Dragos hinted that there would be 
widesale changes this time round and it appears that lessons have been learnt 
from the initial release, which courted some vigourous criticism. Through 
intensive work and contributions from the Scala community and users, we're 
finally at a stage to see a fully functioning set of Scala tools for the 
Eclipse IDE - which can only be a good thing for both parties.</p> 
<p>What is interesting about this release is that Typesafe have actively 
pursued a stake in development, with Martin Odersky leading the redesign&nbsp;
of the Scala presentation compiler, the engine behind the IDE semantic actions. 
Since March's first beta, there have been 12 more (showing how dedicated the 
community are to getting it right this time) before this production ready 
version.</p> 
<p>The team listened avidly to user feedback; most demanding <strong>faster 
compilation, better debugging and better integration with established Java 
tools like Maven</strong> and the team have made tough decision in hope of 
appeasing most.</p> 
<p>So what is new within Scala IDE V2.0 for Eclipse? At a glance the following 
features certainly increase productivity:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Errors reported as you type</strong> thus reducing the number of 
times needed to build.</li> 
<li><strong>Project builder with dependency tracking -</strong> the Sbt engine 
tracks dependencies between source files therefore only builds the sources that 
need to be built, leaving irrelevant builds behind.</li> 
<li><strong>Definition hyperlinking</strong> - Simply&nbsp;Ctrl-click on an 
identifier to navigate to its definition, meaning you don't have to remember in 
what source file a definition lies in. Quite nifty.</li> 
<li><strong>Code Completion -&nbsp;</strong>Hit Ctrl-space to see a list of 
all members you could invoke at a certain point in your program</li> 
<li><strong>Inferred type hovers -&nbsp;</strong>Hover with the mouse over an 
identifier to see its type. This comes in handy when the compiler infers a 
different type than what you expect.</li> </ul> 
<p>There's far more features profiled on the redesigned&nbsp;Scala IDE website
&nbsp;but the team are already looking to the future - seeing this as the start 
of a new beginning and promising important bug fixes soon.&nbsp;This is the 
last version that will support the 2.8 compiler, as the team look forward to 
developing 2.1.</p> 
<p>You can find Scala IDE for Eclipse at Github too, which already houses some 
interesting forks. As you can already imagine, the Eclipse environment is 
thriving with this latest revamped Scala plugin.</p>  Chris Mayer
