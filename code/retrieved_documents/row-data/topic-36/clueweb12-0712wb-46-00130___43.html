 It's what I started my 
programming history with and I still have fond memories of it. Easy enough 
language that got me interested in programming and provided me instant fun. 
There never really was any other such comprehensive language with quick-to-see 
results. Drawing on screen was easy, syntax was easy and reading from input was 
easy. You got fun things done quickly. As much as some &quot;I'm better than 
you&quot; geeks like to take a stand about it, BASIC was important part of 
history. Share twitter facebook <br>

 That's a

you want files to be primitive objects, while in most other languages you 
wouldn't. And in a spreadsheet you are going to want cells to be primitives. 
That's a good way to say it, you want to use a BASIC because you are going to 
need create a derivative language which means you can't just pull in a library 
from a preexisting language.</p>

<p>I don't understand why people think Eclipse is so awesome. I use it at work 
currently and when I get time, I'm going to switch away from it.</p> 
<p>1. Eclipse is too modular. It can't do anything on it's own and the 
hundreds of plugins aren't tested with each other. This causes bugs, 
incompatibilities and UI integration problems.<br>
2. Eclipse has gotten 
better, but it still suffers from the refresh problem. It doesn't poll for 
changes in source files frequently enough and if you dare add a file outside 
the IDE, you have to manually refresh the view to see it.<br>
3. Eclipse wasn't 
written with swing and requires SWT which means that you can only run it on 
platforms that SWT has been ported on.<br>
4. Eclipse is not intuitive. Things 
like wizards don't behave properly. When writing Java code, one would assume 
that Apache Axis 2 projects would be supported with the latest web project 
type. They're not. You can't switch without recreating your whole project. You 
also can't generate a client only from an axis 2 project.<br>
5. Eclipse is 
ugly. It still looks like an IBM product. Intellij, Netbeans, hell even visual 
studio are more appealing.<br>
6. Every &quot;killer&quot; feature I've seen an 
Eclipse developer mention is also available in Netbeans. The few things I can't 
do in Netbeans are third party add-ons that haven't been tested well and don't 
integrate. It turns into multiple eclipse installs.. one for Java, one for C++, 
one for PHP, etc. This is wrong. Netbeans got this right.<br>
7. Source 
formatting in eclipse is terrible. It breaks things up into little tiny lines 
and wraps things way too much. Java is verbose.. i need more than 80 characters 
unfortunately to be legible. It's also a hassle to configure this compared to 
other IDEs I've seen. It's so bad, some people have made plugins just to do 
that.<br>
8. Eclipse warnings are useless. People get so used to having yellow 
lines on the side, they don't take any warnings seriously. It causes one to do 
bad things.</p> 
<p>I realize that this is going to start a flamewar, but before anyone tries 
to say I'm wrong please try some recent versions of other IDEs. Most complaints 
I hear about Netbeans, Visual Studio, etc. are for very old versions. If 
eclipse is the gold standard, our standards are too low.</p> Parent Share
