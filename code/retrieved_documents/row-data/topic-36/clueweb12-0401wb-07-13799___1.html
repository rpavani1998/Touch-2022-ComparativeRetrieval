<p>Oracle's newly released NetBeans 7.0 features support for Java 7 
features.&nbsp; The JDK 7 component of NetBeans 7.0 is technically an early 
access snapshot.&nbsp; A NetBeans 7.0.1 release in October will feature the 
final version of JDK 7. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Even developers who aren't currently 
using Java 7 will benefit from the NetBeans update.&nbsp; Other improvements 
include support for Oracle Database, the inclusion of Glassfish 3.1, and 
enhanced integration with Oracle WebLogic.<br>
<br>
It should also be noted 
that Oracle removed NetBeans 7's Ruby on Rails support in January, 2011. &nbsp;
</p> 
<h2>RightScale and Zend Team Up With New PaaS</h2>The new RightScale Zend PHP 
High Availability Solution Pack, a platform created by the Zend/RightScale, 
will allow enterprise-level PHP applications to be deployed in the cloud.&nbsp; 
A standardized environment allows users to easily acclimate to the new 
system.&nbsp; Support is included for Java, PHP, Ruby and .NET.<br>
<br>

<h2>Support Ending for Ubuntu Server 6.06</h2>As of this June 2011, support 
will no longer be offered for Ubuntu Server 6.06. Desktop support for 6.06 was 
discontinued two years ago.&nbsp; Kate Stewart, Ubuntu's release manager, 
suggests that that currentUbuntu 6.06 users upgrade to 'Hardy Heron' or Ubuntu 
8.04 LTS.&nbsp; Although this version of the Ubuntu Server will be discontinued 
in May, support will continue for two more years.<br>
<br>

<h2>Shh&hellip; Apple Might be Watching </h2> 
<p>Apple knows where you've been. Or, it might be more accurate to say that 
Apple knows where your iPad or iPhone has been.&nbsp; For those who haven't 
heard, writer Peter Warden and hacker Alasdair Allan sharedevidence that Apple 
is tracking all iOS 4 users.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
While the news that Apple is 
tracking your every move might not come as a surprise to jaded technocrats, the 
idea that this information isn't even encrypted is somewhat unsettling.<br>

<p>Oracle rushed Netbeans 7 out the door. I'm speaking as a long-time Netbeans 
user, releasing it at this time was a mistake. There are way too many bugs for 
it to be usable (yes, I've been filing bug reports).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They should have waited at least another month.</p>
