<h2><b>Cambridge CAE, FCE, IELTS, TOEFL, TOEIC Courses</b></h2> 
<p>The English language is prevalent in academic and business environments 
throughout the world.</p> 
<p>As a result, many English language learners wish to attend institutions of 
higher learning in English speaking countries and to attain employment in 
positions that require proficiency in the English language.</p> 
<p>To achieve these aims, specific examinations and tests of student ability 
in the English language have been in place for a number of years.</p>  &nbsp; 
<h2><b>IELTS, TOEFL, TOEIC Courses</b></h2> 
<p>To meet academic and professional needs, several internationally recognized 
standard tests, such as the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), 
IELTS (International English Language Testing System), and TOEIC (Test of 
English for International Communication) are available to establish benchmarks 
of proficiency in the English language.</p> 
<p>Passing the TOEFL or IELTS is essential for gaining entrance to University 
in an English speaking country.</p> 
<p>The TOEIC examination focuses on English for business purposes. Holding a 
TOEIC certificate demonstrates a good command on the English language for such 
purposes and thus enhances the employment prospects of certificate holders.</p> 
<p>To gain a high test score in any of the above exams, many students enroll 
on courses specifically designed to meet the needs of the examination. The 
materials and course books used on these courses is created and/or endorsed by 
the organizations that developed these tests.</p>  &nbsp; 
<h2><b>Cambridge FCE, CAE, CPE Courses</b></h2> 
<p>More focused on functional English than academic or professional English, 
are the highly regarded and widely recognised range of Cambridge Certificates.
</p> 
<p>To earn a Cambridge Certificate, student&rsquo;s must sit and pass a 
Cambridge test of English. These tests range in ability levels from the first 
level KET (Key English Test) to the fifth level CPE (Cambridge Proficiency 
Exam).</p> 
<p>To achieve success on one of the Cambridge tests, many students enroll on 
courses specifically designed to cover the language elements on which you will 
be assessed. The materials and course books used on these courses is often 
designed and/or endorsed by the Cambridge organization that prepares and grades 
the tests.</p>  &nbsp; 
<h2><b>English Exam Preparation Courses</b></h2>

in Australia, Canada, England, Ireland, Scotland and the USA.</p>

particular English test that you plan to take.</p> 
<p>Some courses are combined with general English language courses and include 
sections that focus on test preparation.</p> 
<p>Other courses focus on preparing you for study at college or university, 
which also includes preparation for the English exam that you will have to take 
for admission to your chosen university or college.&nbsp;</p>
