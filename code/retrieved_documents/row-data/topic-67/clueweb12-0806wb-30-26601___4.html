<h3>English Language Testing With TOEFL and IELTS</h3> <br>
<br>

<p>by CollegeXpress</p> 
<p><strong>What's this &quot;toe-full&quot; test people keep talking about in 
college admission? It's the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), and 
along with the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), it tests 
international students' English language abilities.</strong></p> 
<p>Here's an introduction to the basics of this two common English language 
testing systems. For more info, visit theInternational Students section of 
CollegeXpress.<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<h2><strong>TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)</strong></h2> 
<p>Nearly every college/university requires that students whose first language 
is not English demonstrate their English proficiency. The most commonly 
accepted test is the TOEFL, and the TOEFL Internet-based test (iBT) is 
administered in most countries, though the paper-based test (PBT) is available 
on a limited basis. Check the TOEFL website to find out which versions are 
offered in your country.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Evaluation: English language proficiency in reading, listening, speaking, 
and writing</li> 
<li>Duration: About four and a half hours for the iBT and three and half hours 
for the PBT</li> 
<li>Score validity: Two years</li> 
<li>Maximum score: 120 for iBT and 677 for PBT</li> 
<li>Test fee: Varies by county; check the TOEFL website for the test fee in 
your country.</li> 
<li>Mode of payment: Credit card, money order, or check; please visit the 
TOEFL website for additional information about acceptable forms of payment, as 
not all testing locations accept the same forms of payment.</li>

</strong></li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>IELTS (International English Language Testing System)&nbsp; 
</strong></h2> 
<p>An increasing number of institutions accept the IELTS (International 
English Language Testing System), offered by the British Council. Like the 
TOEFL, the IELTS measures students&rsquo; English proficiency. Many schools 
accept an IELTS score from their international applicants, but not all, so you 
should check the admission requirements of the college/university before 
applying. Students pursuing an education abroad take the Academic Reading and 
Writing Module, and they may choose from almost 50 test dates throughout the 
year. The speaking portion of the test can be taken a week before or after the 
written test.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Evaluation: Listening, reading, writing, and speaking in English</li> 
<li>Duration: About two hours and 45 minutes</li> 
<li>Score validity: Two years</li> 
<li>Maximum score: A Band Scale score of nine</li> 
<li>Test fee: &euro;175 or about $220 U.S. dollars (subject to changes in 
conversion rates)</li> 
<li>Mode of payment: Credit card, check, or bank transfer</li> 
<li>More information or to register: IELTS Inc., 100 East Corson Street, Suite 
200, Pasadena, CA 91103 USA; phone: +1-626-564-2954;<strong>www.ielts.org
