<h1>Preparatory Course for IELTS / TOEFL</h1> <br>
As the demand for pursuing 
higher education in foreign countries is on the rise, so is the need for 
proving one's proficiency in English. One has to demonstrate not only one's 
linguistic skills (reading writing and speaking) but also the familiarity with 
computers. This course prepares a student in all aspects of the IELTS / TOEFL 
test to enable him to pursue higher education in English-medium universities.
<br> <br>

<h2>Course Aim:</h2> This course aims to sharpen the students' linguistic 
skills, which helps them to give their IELTS / TOEFL exams with more 
confidence, resulting in better scores. This course enhances the ability of 
non-native English speakers to use and understand English as it is spoken, 
written, and heard in college and university settings. The IELTS / TOEFL 
examination formats are explained and it is ensured that the students 
understand the requirements of these Exams. Furthermore, the students develop 
their overall language ability in the four skills of listening, reading, 
writing and speaking. The strengths and weaknesses for further development are 
also identified.<br>
<br>
 This course utilizes a variety of media and texts 
that permit students to recognize and monitor their short comings that are 
hindering clear speech. We focus on improving the vocabulary of the students, 
by making them listen to new words, checking their meaning, keeping track of 
them in a vocabulary notebook and then trying to use them in conversation or 
writing. To attain high scores, constant guidance, advice and tips on skills 
and strategies that are required by students to answer the questions, are 
administered.<br>
