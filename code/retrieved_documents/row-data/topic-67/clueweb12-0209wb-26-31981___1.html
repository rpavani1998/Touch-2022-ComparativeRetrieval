<strong>
Graduate Health Professional Associations</strong></p> 
<p>Universities and other institutions that use TOEFL&reg; scores have begun 
to set their TOEFL iBT score recommendations or requirements. These initial

<h2>SKILL BUILDING ACTIVITIES</h2> 
<p>May 29th, 2007 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS</p> 
<p>Taking and analyzing practice TOEFL tests is only a part of comprehensive 
plan for TOEFL preparation. In addition, you should continue to work on 
improving your global level of English fluency, keep in good physical shape,

<h2>Eligibility and Fees</h2> 
<p>May 29th, 2007 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS</p> 
<p>Anyone and everyone is eligible for taking the TOEFL test - there are no 
restrictions based on age or qualifications. The test scores are valid for two 
years.</p> 
<p>i.e., most universities accept scores up to two years old.<br>
</p> 
<p>Fees are subject to change without notice. In India, this fee is US $130, 
payable at the time of registration. You cannot pay in Indian Rupees.</p> 
<p>The fees has to be paid through a US Dollar denominated draft, made out in 
favour of &ldquo;ETS - TOEFL&rdquo; payable in the U.S. Such a draft is usually 
available with the Main Branches of most banks (which have a foreign exchange 
counter) in most of the big cities for a nominal charge (around Rs. 200).</p> 
<p>Alternately, the payment can also be made through a credit card which has 
global acceptance. The credit card need not necessarily be yours - you can get 
your father to sign for you!</p> 
<p>Important: The name on the registration form should be exactly the same as 
in your passport or you may not be allowed to test. It is advisable to attach 
the photocopy of the Passport with the application form to avoid any faulty 
registration.</p>

<h2>Content and Format of the TOEFL test</h2> 
<p>May 29th, 2007 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS</p> 
<p>A general idea of the content &amp; format of TOEFL.</p> 
<p>The test has four sections : <strong>Listening, Structure, Reading and 
Writing</strong>.</p> 
<p>The number of questions and the time allocated to each question may vary. 
Therefore, one student may get 35 questions in Listening section while another

<p>But, the additional questions are for research purposes only and the scores 
of all test takers are based on the same number of questions.The following

<h2>5 Easy Steps For Writing Essay For TOEFL</h2> 
<p>May 29th, 2007 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p>Importance of Essay Writing in TOEFL and a few Tips &lsquo;n&rsquo; Tricks 
to handle it !!<br>
<strong>Writing Section</strong><br>
 The Writing section 
measures the ability to write in English, including the ability to generate, 
organize, and develop ideas, to support those ideas with examples or evidence, 
and to compose a response to one assigned topic in standard written English.</p>
<p><strong>Choice of Style</strong><br>
 You have a 30-minute time limit to 
write your essay.<br>
<strong><br>
 Essay Ratings</strong><br>
 Each essay is 
assigned one of the ratings listed at the end of this page by two independent 
readers. The average of the two ratings is reported on a raw score scale of 1 
to 6. A rating between two points on the scale (5.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.5) can 
also be reported. If there is a discrepancy of more than one point, a third 
reader independently reads the essay. The essay rating comprises one half of 
the Structure/Writing score (1/6 of the total score); it is also<br>
 reported 
separately on the score report, for informational purposes.</p> 
<p>Writing Strategies<br>
 Below are some specific strategies for the Writing 
section:</p> 
<p>A. You should look over the essay topics published in the Bulletin, and 
practice writing several 30-minute essays using the topics there or on this 
site.</p> 
<p>B. You will be given scratch paper to organize their thoughts; however, 
only the essays written on the official answer sheet are scored.<strong>You 
should practice handwriting an essay, using a two sided sheet of lined paper. 
(You will be provided with a twosided sheet on the day of the test.)</strong>
<br> You should start writing the essay on the first line of the sheet and use 
the other side if necessary. You should not use large handwriting, skip lines, 
or leave large margins to make your essays appear longer; readers look at the 
development of the essay and how the ideas are expressed and elaborated on, not 
at how many words are written or appear to be written.</p> 
<p>You should also write<em> neatly and legibly</em>. You will not be graded 
on the neatness of your handwriting, but the readers who evaluate the essays 
must be able to read the handwriting.</p> 
<p>C. You should become familiar with the scoring guide. It can be useful to 
understand in more detail how the essay readers evaluate the essay. Readers 
judge essays on how the ideas are presented and developed as well as on the use 
of language.</p> 
<p>The essay question should be answered carefully. You should do your best to 
write about what the essay question asks for. An essay that is not about the 
topic presented will receive a score of &ldquo;0,&rdquo; and this will have a 
serious effect on the Structure/Writing score.</p> 
<p>Essays are also judged on organization. If an essay is well organized, a 
reader will be able to read from the beginning to the end without becoming 
confused.</p> 
<p>A term used in the scoring guide is &ldquo;development.&rdquo; Development 
is the gradual expansion of an idea throughout an essay, not simply the number 
of words written. The same ideas can be communicated in various ways, depending 
on skill with vocabulary and sentence structure. You should try to cover the 
topics as well as you can within your own abilities.</p> 
<p>Essay readers judge how well details, examples, and reasons support or 
illustrate the points being made.</p> 
<p>The essay will also be judged on the use of language.Naturally the readers 
will notice grammatical errors and thenumber of errors in a paper. They judge 
whether the errors make the meaning of the essay difficult to understand. They 
also judge the variety, effectiveness, and appropriateness of the sentence 
structures and vocabulary used in an essay.</p> 
<p>D. You should plan and organize before beginning to write.<br>
 Immediately 
after reading the essay question, you should take some time to think about the 
topic before you start to write. Making a brief outline or some notes on 
scratch paper<br>
 may help organize the essay.</p> 
<p>E. Time management is the key.<br>
 You should keep track of time and allow 
a few minutes before the 30 minutes have ended to read over your essays and 
make any changes.</p>

<h2>TOEFL - FAQs</h2> 
<p>May 29th, 2007 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS</p> 
<p>Review of the various Questions asked frequently by TOEFL aspirants.</p> 
<p><strong>What is TOEFL?</strong><br>
 Test Of English As Foreign Language is 
a Standardized test that evaluates the English Proficiency of people whose 
native language is not English. Nearly 2400 education institutes in the United 
States and Canada require TOEFL scores from each applicant. The test is also 
used by institutions in other countries where English is the language of 
Instruction. The TOEFL tests the ability to understand North American English.
</p> 
<p><strong>Why Take the TOEFL Test?<br>
</strong>Most people take the TOEFL 
test as a prerequisite for admission into colleges and universities where 
English is used or required. In addition, many government, licensing, and 
certification agencies and exchange and scholarship programs use TOEFL scores 
to evaluate the English proficiency of people for whom English is not their 
native language.</p> 
<p><strong>Who makes the TOEFL Test? </strong><br>
 The TOEFL Test is created 
and produced by the Educational Testing Service.</p> 
<p><strong>Who Should Take the TOEFL Test?</strong><br>
 Non-native English 
speakers at the 11th-grade level or above should take the TOEFL test to provide 
evidence of their English proficiency before beginning academic work. The test 
content is considered too difficult for students below 11th grade.</p> 
<p><strong>How many kinds of TOEFL Tests are there?</strong><br>
 There are 
currently 3 kinds of TOEFL tests being used around the world:<br>
<strong>The 
IBT:</strong> the Internet Based TOEFL Test (IBT) is currently being used in 
the U.S., France, Italy, Germany, and Canada&hellip;and will soon appear in 
many other countries. Selected cities in North Africa, the Middle East, 
Eurasia, Europe and the Americas will offer the IBT for the first time on March 
25, 2006. Check: ets.org/toefl for details. In May, 2006, selected test centers 
in Japan and Korea will begin to offer the IBT. In August, 2006, the IBT will 
be given in China.<br>
<strong><br>
 The CBT:</strong> the Computer-Based TOEFL 
(CBT) is still being used in some countries such as Japan and Korea&ndash;and 
will still be used even after the IBT is administered in selected cities. 
However, this test will be completely phased out by the end of 2006 according 
to ETS.<br>
<strong><br>
 The PBT:</strong> the Paper and Pencil TOEFL, also 
called the Institutional TOEFL. This test is still being used by English 
language institutions around the world. However, universities and colleges 
normally do not accept this test for admission unless it is used in a local 
context (in other words, if the English language institution is located in 
close proximity to a university or college, then the university or college 
might accept it for admission). There are no plans to phase out this test.</p> 
<p><strong>Which kind of TOEFL Test do I need to take? </strong><br>
 The 
student must ask the educational institution which type of TOEFL Test it 
accepts. Different universities accept different TOEFL tests.</p> 
<p><strong>Which TOEFL Test is the easier: the IBT, the CBT, or the PBT? 
</strong><br>
 ETS has tried very hard to make the tests equally difficult. 
Some students feel that the IBT is more difficult because it contains more 
difficult reading and listening tasks&ndash;and it contains a Speaking Section. 
Some students feel that the PBT is easier because it does not always contain a 
writing section&ndash;and it contains a grammar section. Different students 
will have different reactions to the different tests.</p> 
<p><strong>What are the Topics covered under TOEFL?</strong><br>
 Grammar, 
Reading, Vocabulary, Listening comp, Writing and targeted TOEFL test taking 
skills and strategies.</p> 
<p>- English Language training through American films.<br>
 - University 
Admission Guidance, Exercises and information.<br>
 - Review of idiomatic 
expressions and responses that they are likely to encounter in American 
campuses and in professional settings.<br>
 - From the start, students focus on 
all the important components of the TOEFL test: Grammar, Reading, Vocab, 
Listening comp, Writing an essay and targeted. TOEFL test skills and strategies.
<br> - Practice test sessions are given monthly under &ldquo;real test&rdquo; 
conditions (Virtual Reality)<br>
 Individualized profile for learning style.<br>
 - Developing a personalized structured self-study plan.</p> 
<p><strong>Who administers the TOEFL test? </strong><br>
 The TOEFL test is 
developed and administered by the US-based &ldquo;Educational Testing 
Service&rdquo; (ETS). This implies that ETS sets the questions, conducts the 
test, and sends each examinee the score report. For the conduct of the test, 
ETS has appointed Testing Agencies in various countries, which act as 
franchisee for ETS. In India, this agency is the &ldquo;Prometric Testing 
Services Pvt. Ltd&rdquo; which administers the test at 9 centers in the 
country: Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, 
New Delhi, and Trivandrum.</p> 
<p><strong>How to Apply? </strong><br>
 Obtain the &ldquo;TOEFL Information 
Bulletin&rdquo; available free with Prometric Testing Services and USEFI. The 
Test Scheduling Form comes with the bulletin. There are three ways to register:
<br> <strong>Registering by Phone:</strong> You may call up Prometric office 
until 12:00 noon to register. Make sure to call at least THREE BUSINESS DAYS 
before the test date.<br>
<strong>Registering by Fax:</strong> If registering 
by fax, you must send your fax at lest SEVEN DAYS prior to your first choice of 
a test day.<br>
<strong>Registering by Mail/Courier:</strong> Fill in the form, 
get the draft made (if you are not paying by credit card), and submit these to 
the Prometric Centre either by hand or by registered post/courier. You must 
send the documents at least THREE WEEKS before your choice of a test day.</p> 
<p><strong>Where Can People Take the Test?</strong><br>
 The TOEFL test is 
offered in 180 countries around the world at institutional locations, such as 
colleges and universities testing centers operated by Prometric, a division of 
Thomson Learning. In areas where access to computer-based testing or 
Internet-based testing is limited, a paper-based version of the test is 
administered on specific dates. The paper-based TOEFL test is generally offered 
at institutional locations such as colleges and universities.</p> 
<p><strong>What are the materials Required on the Test Day? </strong><br>
 You 
are required to bring your valid passport on the day of your exam. This is 
mandatory. Some signature bearing identification, i.e., Driving License, 
Notarized identification. Confirmation letter or Number</p> 
<p><strong>Who Accepts TOEFL Scores?</strong><br>
 More than 6,000 colleges, 
universities, and licensing agencies in 110 countries accept TOEFL scores.</p> 
<p><strong>How can I get a copy of the TOEFL Bulletin?</strong><br>
 Check the 
Bulletin section of our website or you can download it or order it from the 
Official TOEFL Web Site: You can download a free copy of the information 
bulletin at the official TOEFL web site.</p> 
<p><strong>For how long is my TOEFL score valid?</strong><br>
 Your TOEFL 
score is valid for only two years. In other words, two years after you take 
your TOEFL, your score will be deleted from the official TOEFL database, and 
TOEFL will not send you another report of your score. If you still have a copy 
of your original score, you can ask the university whether they will accept it, 
but most universities will not accept a copy from you; they require a score 
sent directly from TOEFL.</p> 
<p><strong>What is a good score on the TOEFL? </strong><br>
 The highest score 
on the paper TOEFL is 677. The highest score on the computer TOEFL is 300. Most 
people now still use the paper TOEFL scores, even though most students take the 
computer TOEFL. The score that you need depends on the university that you want 
to go to; you will need to contact the university to find out. In general, 
however, the score requirements range from 133 to 250 (CBT scoring) or 450 to 
600 (PBT scoring). Some universities will tell you that they don&rsquo;t have a 
minimum requirement;<strong> </strong>usually these<strong> universities are 
the best ones, such as Stanford or Harvard</strong>. However, even though they 
don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;requirement,&rdquo; most of the people who go to 
these universities have TOEFL scores from 267 to 300.</p> 
<p><strong>What score do I need on the TOEFL?</strong><br>
 The highest TOEFL 
score that you will need is probably about 630. The lowest TOEFL score that you 
will need is probably about 450. In general, better universities require higher 
TOEFL scores and worse schools require lower TOEFL scores. Some schools require 
no TOEFL score, but, be careful! These schools are usually not good schools!</p>
<p><strong>How can I raise my score on the TOEFL?</strong><br>
 Some people 
can raise their scores by speaking and watching television and American movies, 
other people can raise their scores by studying the TOEFL. The answer really 
depends on the student.</p> 
<p><strong>What is the best way to raise my TOEFL score quickly? </strong><br>

 In general, grammar scores go up faster than the scores on any other section.
</p> 
<p><strong>Do I have to take the computer TOEFL or the paper TOEFL?</strong>
<br> In every country except China, you will probably have to take the computer 
test. However, TOEFL has closed many CBT test centers in the last few years and 
is giving the paper-based TOEFL instead. Again, check the Official TOEFL web 
site to be sure.</p> 
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between the computer TOEFL and the 
paper TOEFL?</strong><br>
 There are many differences between the CBT TOEFL and 
the paper TOEFL. The biggest difference between the CBT TOEFL and the paper 
TOEFL is that the<strong>CBT TOEFL requires an essay. </strong>Also, the CBT 
TOEFL has some new question types that we have not seen before on the paper 
TOEFL.</p> 
<p><strong>Which TOEFL is easier? The computer TOEFL or the paper TOEFL?
</strong><br>
 Most people agree: the paper TOEFL is much easier than the CBT 
TOEFL. For example, the listening on the CBT TOEFL is much harder than the 
listening on the paper TOEFL and the CBT TOEFL has an essay that you have to 
write. However, everybody is different, and you may find the CBT TOEFL easier.
</p> 
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between the Institutional TOEFL and the 
International TOEFL?</strong><br>
 Some people have heard about the 
&ldquo;institutional TOEFL.&rdquo; The Institutional TOEFL is the TOEFL that is 
given by an &ldquo;institution&rdquo; (such as a company or a language school) 
so that they can measure the English level of the people who take the test. The 
score you receive from this test is NOT accepted by every university in the 
world. However, many colleges will accept a TOEFL score from the Institutional 
TOEFL. If you want your TOEFL score to be accepted at every university in the 
world, then you need to take the International TOEFL.<br>
<strong><br>
 Can I 
still take the paper TOEFL instead of the computer TOEFL?</strong><br>
 For 
most schools, the answer is &ldquo;NO.&rdquo; However, some schools think that 
the price of the nternational TOEFL is too high (about US $130) and will still 
accept scores from the Institutional TOEFL, which is given on paper. You will 
have to ask the school that you want to attend to find out whether they will 
accept the institutional TOEFL or not. If schools accept the institutional 
TOEFL, you will have to find a place to take it. However, remember, these 
scores are NOT accepted by most schools and are not considered official scores.
</p> 
<p><strong>Should I type or handwrite the essay for the computer TOEFL?
</strong><br>
 The easy answer is this: you should type your TOEFL essay if you 
can! However, if you cannot type very fast, you should handwrite your TOEFL 
essay. If you type your TOEFL essay, you should receive your TOEFL score within 
two weeks. If you handwrite your TOEFL essay, it might take up to five weeks to 
receive your TOEFL score.</p>
