<h5> Questions about TOEFL (IELTS)? </h5>  &laquo; <strong>Reply #2 on:
</strong> June 10, 2007, 06:39 AM &raquo;  Hello! I&rsquo;m new here. Hope to 
get some pointers on my TOEFL iBT scores.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m from Malaysia and 
interested to apply for ED for Fall Term 2008. Recently, I&rsquo;ve got my 
TOEFL results and unfortunately my Listening and Speaking sections appear to 
lack a few scores from the minimum requirements stated in the admission website 
(http://www.jhu.edu/admis/apply/testreqs.html). I scored only 24 for Listening 
and 23 for Speaking, which are each 2 marks short from the required scores for 
admission (I scored 29 for both my Reading and Writing though).<br>
<br>
Will 
these results affect my admission chances for ED? Although it is 2 scores short 
for both sections, still it does not meet the stated requirements. This really 
bothers me&hellip; I&rsquo;m having a dilemma whether to retake my TOEFL test 
or not. It&rsquo;s quite expensive for me to retake the test, but if these 
scores are not sufficient for me to stand a chance for admission, I&rsquo;m 
more than willing to retake my test&hellip; Please advise!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks! 
Have a nice day!<br>
<br>
Cheers. <br>

</strong> June 11, 2007, 08:23 AM &raquo;  As our web site ( 
http://apply.jhu.edu/faqs/international.html) states, during the early stages 
of the Internet-based TOEFL we will be flexible with scores, especially from 
the Speaking section. In addition, we state that a student SHOULD have the 
stated scores, and that we PREFER the following minimum sub-scores:<br>
<br>
26 
in Reading<br>
26 in Listening <br>
25 in Speaking <br>
22 in Writing <br>
<br>

By using the words &quot;SHOULD&quot; and &quot;PREFER&quot; we are avoiding 
stating specific requirements. Students are not automatically denied if they do 
not obtain these levels. However, we are stressing the fact that these are the 
scores that one should obtain to be considered competitive in the admissions 
process.<br>
<br>
The decision as to whether or not to take the TOEFL again is 
one you will need to make on your own. However, based on our suggested scores, 
if you want your application to be strongly considered for admission you should 
consider trying to raise your TOEFL scores to meet or minimum sub-scores.<br>

several times.<br>
I want to know that if I send all the scores to JHU, would 
you add up each highest subscores and take this score into consideration?<br>

Or you would view the total score of each time?<br>
<br>
Thank you sincerely.

</strong> August 10, 2007, 01:57 PM &raquo;  Just like we do with all of our 
standardized tests, if you take the TOEFL multiple times and submit all your 
scores we will take the highest sub-score for each section, even if they are 
obtained during different exams. <br>

</strong> February 01, 2008, 04:13 PM &raquo;  I used to live in India and my 
first language is English. However, it is not the native language of India. I 
immigrated to Canada in 2005 and I will be graduating from my high school in 
2009. I really want to get into Johns Hopkins University for undergrad. I 
thought that SAT Reasoning Test and the SAT subject tests were the only 
standardized tests required to apply at JHU. However, I just found out today 
from a friend that TOEFL is required even for applicants who are attending 
secondary school in English-speaking countries but have only been there for 
less than five years. I have been in Canada for more than three years now and I 
will be a Canadian citizen before September 2008. So, do I need to take the 
TOEFL in order to apply for JHU? <br>

</strong> February 01, 2008, 05:44 PM &raquo;  The TOEFL is required of 
applicants whose native language is not English and who attend a 
non-English-speaking secondary school. If you attend an English-language school 
but do not speak English at home, you should take the TOEFL. If your native 
language is not English and you attend an English-language secondary school., 
you must take the TOEFL if you have been at that school for fewer than five 
years.<br>

Yes - you NOT are 
required to take the TOEFL examination if<br>
<br>
1) &nbsp;You have been in an 
English speaking school system for more than 5 years<br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
2) 
&nbsp;You have attained a 670 on the Critical Reading section of the SAT I 
examination. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Every other student is required to take the 
examination even if they hold a US Passport. <strong>Mark E. Butt<br>

officer on the phone and she said it is okay to take TOEFL on January and send 
score.<br>
I am wondering if it will be safer to send my original TOEFL score 
from October now and send ToEFL score from January later.<br>
<br>
Thank you so 
much for reading my question :)<br>

<blockquote> I am wondering if it will be safer to send my original TOEFL

You are required to request from the College Board/ETS that your October TOEFL 
scores are sent directly to Johns Hopkins prior to the Jan. 1 application 
deadline. The scores can arrive after the deadline but they must be requested 
prior to it.<br>
<br>
You will then need to request that your January TOEFL 
scores also be sent. There is no guarantee that your January scores will arrive 
in time, but if they do then they will be factored in. <br>

application cycle the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for Johns Hopkins 
University still does not accept IELTS exam scores. Applicants whose first 
language is not English need to show English proficiency with their application 
and the way to do that is by one of the following three things:<br>
<br>
- 
TOEFL score<br>
- attended an English-language school for the last five 
consecutive years<br>
- a score of 670 or higher on the Critical Reading 
section of the SAT <br>

earlier in this discussion forum:<br>
<br>
As our web site ( 
http://apply.jhu.edu/faqs/international.html) states, a student should have the 
following minimum sub-scores:<br>
<br>
26 in Reading <br>
26 in Listening <br>

25 in Speaking<br>
22 in Writing <br>
<br>
These are not specific requirements 
but it is highly advisable a student obtains these scores or higher on each 
sub-section. Students are not automatically denied if they do not obtain these 
levels. However, we are stressing the fact that these are the scores that one 
should obtain to be considered competitive in the admissions process.<br>
<br>

The decision as to whether or not to take the TOEFL again is one you will need 
to make on your own. However, based on our suggested scores, if you want your 
application to be strongly considered for admission you should consider trying 
to raise your TOEFL scores to meet or minimum sub-scores. <br>

</blockquote> SAT scores and TOEFL 
scores are separate admissions factors and are looked at differently by the 
Admissions Committee. TOEFL scores do not replace SAT Critical Reading or 
Writing scores. The Admissions Committee will review your TOEFL scores as we 
review TOEFL scores, as a test of English proficiency, and the Committee will 
review your SAT scores as we review standardized exam scores that all 
applicants must submit. <br>

Yes, you should list your 
highest score for each subsection. Do note though that self-reported scores on 
your application are not considered official, and you are required to have the 
College Board submit all your TOEFL scores to Johns Hopkins University directly.
