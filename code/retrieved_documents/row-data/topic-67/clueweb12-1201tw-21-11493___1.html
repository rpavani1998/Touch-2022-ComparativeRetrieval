<h2> TOEFL or IELTS &ndash; Which is Better? </h2> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Because universities want to make sure you have the English language skills 
necessary to study at their school, almost all institutes of higher learning 
require you to take a test of English. AndTOEFL and IELTS are the two biggest 
standardized tests of the English language. One of the most frequent questions 
I hear is which test is easier or which test is better. The answer depends on 
what kinds of tests you excel at, as well as where you plan to apply. This 
article breaks down the differences between the two tests so that you can make 
your own decision.</p> 
<p><strong>Admissions</strong></p> 
<p>The IELTS test is administrated by the British Councils, the University of 
Cambridge, and IELTSAustralia. That is to say, it is associated with the 
British government and traditionally was used by Britishuniversities, as well 
as New Zealand and Australianuniversities to determine the language capability 
of foreign students.TOEFL is administered by ETS, a US-based non-profit and is 
used widely by American and Canadianuniversities. However, these days, in order 
to make it easy on international students,universities all over the world take 
bothTOEFL and IELTS. While you should check with the specific university you 
want to apply to, in general any school in the US, the UK,Australia or New 
Zealand will take either test score. So that&rsquo;s one worry off your mind. 
Pick the test you think will be easier for you to complete. To do that, you 
probably need to know the structure of each exam.</p> 
<p><strong>Structure of the TOEFL</strong></p> 
<p>As of last year, official TOEFL is almost universally given in the iBT 
(Internet Based Testing) format. It consists of four sections:</p> 
<p><em>Reading</em></p> 
<p>The TOEFL Reading section asks you to read 4-6 passages of university level 
and to answer multiple-choice questions about them (multiple-choice means you 
choose the answer from provided options). Questions test you on comprehension 
of the text, main ideas, important details, vocabulary, inferring, rhetorical 
devices and style.</p> 
<p><em>Listening</em></p> 
<p>The Listening Section presents long 2-3 conversations and 4-6 lectures. The 
situations are always related to university life i.e. a conversation between a 
student and a librarian about finding research materials or a lecture from a 
history class. The questions are multiple choice and ask you about important 
details, inferences, tone, and vocabulary. The conversations and lectures are 
very natural and include informal English, interruptions, filler noises like 
&ldquo;uh&rdquo; or &ldquo;Uhm.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><em>Speaking</em></p> 
<p>The Speaking section is recorded. You will speak into a microphone and a 
grader will listen to your answers at a later date and grade you. Two questions 
will be on familiar topics and ask you to give your opinion and/or describe 
something familiar to you, like your town or your favorite teacher. Two 
questions will ask you to summarize information from a text and a 
conversation&ndash;and may ask your opinion as well. Two questions will ask you 
to summarize information from a short conversation. Again, the topics of the 
conversations are always university-related.</p> 
<p><em>Writing</em></p> 
<p>Finally, there are two short essays on the TOEFL. One will ask you to write 
your opinion on a broad topic, such as whether it is better to live in the 
country or the city. One will ask you to summarize information from a text and 
a lecture&ndash;often the two will disagree with each other and you will need 
to either compare and contrast, or synthesize conflicting information.</p> 
<p><strong>IELTS Structure</strong></p> 
<p>The IELTS contains the same 4 sections, Reading, Listening, Speaking and 
Writing, but the format is very different.</p> 
<p><em>Reading</em></p> 
<p>The reading section of the IELTS gives you 3 texts, which may be from 
academic textbooks or from a newspaper or magazine&ndash;but all at the level 
of a university student. One will always be an opinion piece&ndash;i.e. a text 
arguing for one point of view. The variety of questions on the IELTS is quite 
broad, and not every text will have every question type. One question type asks 
you to match headings to paragraphs in the text. You may be asked to complete a 
summary of the passage using words from the text. Or you may have to fill in a 
table or chart or picture with words from the text. There may be 
multiple-choice questions that ask you about key details. One of the hardest 
question types presents statements and asks you whether these statements are 
true, false or not included in the text. You may also be asked to match words 
and ideas. Finally, some questions are short-answer but the answers will be 
taken directly from the text itself.</p> 
<p>Some questions come before the text and may not require careful reading to 
answer. Others come after the text and may expect you to have read the text 
thoroughly.</p> 
<p><em>Listening</em></p> 
<p>The IELTS has four listening sections. The first is a &ldquo;transactional 
conversation&rdquo; in which someone may be applying for something (a 
driver&rsquo;s license, a library card) or asking for information (say calling 
for more details about an advertisement or a hotel). The second section is an 
informational lecture of some kind, possibly a dean explaining the rules of the 
university. Third is a conversation in an academic context and the final 
section will be an academic lecture. For all sections you may be asked to fill 
out a summary, fill in a table, answer multiple-choice questions, label a 
diagram or picture, or classify information into different categories. You will 
be expected to fill out answers as you listen.</p> 
<p><em>Writing</em></p> 
<p>There are two writing tasks on the academic IELTS. The first asks you to 
summarize a table or chart in about 300 words. You will have to identify 
important information, compare and contrast different figures or maybe describe 
a process. The second task asks you to present your opinion on a statement 
about a fairly open topic such as: &ldquo;Women should look after children and 
not work&rdquo; or &ldquo;Too many people are moving to cities and rural areas 
are suffering.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><em>Speaking</em></p> 
<p>Finally, the speaking section will be held on a different day from the rest 
of the test and in the presence of a trained interviewer. The questions are the 
same for all examinees but some parts may be more in the form of a conversation 
than a monologue. The first part of the test will be a brief introductory 
conversation followed by some short questions about familiar topics. The 
interviewer may ask your name, your job, what kinds of sports you like, what 
your daily routine is, and so on. In the second part, you will be given a card 
with a topic and a few specific questions to address. You will have to speak 
for two minutes on this topic, which may be about your daily routine, the last 
time you went to the movies, your favorite part of the world or a similar 
familiar topic. In the last section, the interviewer will ask you to discuss a 
more abstract side of the topic in part 2&ndash;why do people prefer daily 
routines? Why do people like the movies? How does travel affect local life?</p> 
<p><strong>Which is Better for Me?</strong></p> 
<p>So now you have some understanding of what each test involves, but you 
might be wondering which is better for you. Maybe in reading about the 
structure, you thought, &ldquo;WowTOEFL sounds so easy,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Oh 
the IELTS sounds like it&rsquo;s kind of fun!&rdquo; That might be a good sign 
that one test will be easier for you than the other. More concretely, there are 
a couple of key differences between the tests.</p> 
<p><em>British versus American English</em></p> 
<p>While both the UK and the US accept both tests, and while British English 
and American English are not as different as some think, the fact of the matter 
is the IELTS tends to use British English and theTOEFL uses exclusively 
American English. On the IELTS, this difference will have a larger effect 
because spelling counts, and that is one area where Britain and the US do not 
always see eye-to-eye. Obviously if you have problems with the British accent 
(and the test may include a wide variety of accents, including Australian, New 
Zealand, Irish and Scottish). On the other hand, American accents may throw you 
off. Certain terms are also different and you don&rsquo;t want to waste time in 
your speaking test asking what a flat or a lorry is. So whether you are used to 
British or American English is certainly a factor. If you are more comfortable 
with US English, theTOEFL is a good bet but if you are used to British English 
and accents, you&rsquo;ll do better on the IELTS.</p> 
<p><em>Multiple choice versus Copying Down</em></p> 
<p>For the reading and listening sections, TOEFL gives you multiple-choice 
questions, whereas IELTS generally expects you to copy down words from the text 
or the conversation word-for-word. Multiple-choice questions will tend to be 
require slightly better abstract thinking, but the IELTS favors people who have 
good memories and think more concretely. The good thing about multiple-choice 
is that it is easy to pick out wrong answers, whereas the good thing about 
copying down is that the answer is sitting there in the text. You just have to 
find it and repeat it. So, concrete thinkers will tend to do better on the 
IELTS and abstract thinkers will tend to excel on theTOEFL.</p> 
<p><em>Predictable or Different Every Time</em></p> 
<p>Of course, the TOEFL is also more predictable than the IELTS. The IELTS 
throws lots of different question types at you, and the instructions are often 
slightly different every time. That makes it harder to prepare for. TheTOEFL, 
on the other hand, is pretty much the same test every time&ndash;pick A, B, C, 
D, or E. On the other hand, the IELTS certainly keeps you on your toes and that 
can keep you more alert.</p> 
<p><em>Speaking to a Person or a Computer?</em></p> 
<p>Another large difference is in how the speaking section is carried out. For 
some people, it&rsquo;s very relaxing to just record your answers into a 
computer because it feels like no one is listening. You just try your best and 
forget about it until you get your grades. Because the IELTS test is done in an 
interview format with a native speaker present, you might get nervous or feel 
you are being judged. And they take notes: Oh God, did he write down something 
good or something bad? On the other hand, you might feel more relaxed in a 
conversation, with a person there to explain if you don&rsquo;t understand a 
question, or simply having a face to look at, instead of a computer screen. 
Getting feedback from a native speaker can be helpful too, in order to correct 
mistakes and improve during the test. So it depends on what you are more 
comfortable with. If you like talking to people, the IELTS is a better bet. If 
you just want to be alone and not feel judged, theTOEFL will be more 
comfortable for you.</p> 
<p><em>Holistic versus Criteria</em></p> 
<p>Finally, the speaking and writing sections of the TOEFL are graded 
holistically. The grader gives you a score based on the overall quality of the 
essay, including vocabulary, logic, style, and grammar. The IELTS by contrast 
is marked by individual criteria and you are scored individually for grammar, 
word choice, fluency, logic, cohesion, and a dozen other criteria. In other 
words, if you write well but have a lot of small grammar mistakes, yourTOEFL 
score might be quite good because graders will ignore small mistakes if the 
overall essay is logical and detailed. The IELTS will not overlook bad grammar. 
On the other hand, if your grammar and vocabulary are strong but you have 
trouble expressing your opinion or organizing an essay, you could end up with a 
lowTOEFL score but the IELTS will give you good marks for language use. So 
while it may sound like the IELTS is much tougher since it grades you on 
everything, in fact you can get quite a good score if you are strong in a 
number of areas. TheTOEFL emphasizes the ability to put together a logical and 
detailed argument (or summary) and looks at clarity, word choice, and style 
above all. If you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable writing essays but you think you 
have excellent grammar and vocabulary and overall are a decent writer, the 
IELTS will probably be easier for you.</p> 
<p>I hope this essay was helpful in making your choice. In any case, I 
recommend you go to the websites ofIELTS and TOEFL and get some more detail on 
each test, and also try out some practice problems on your own.<br>
