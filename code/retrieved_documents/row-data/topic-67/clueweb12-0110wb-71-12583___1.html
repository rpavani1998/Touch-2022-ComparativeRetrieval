<p>The IELTS and TOEFL exams are known and feared by English language students 
worldwide. Both exams are used by universities to assess the English language 
ability of applicants. IELTS is widely used in the UK and Australia and also 
recognised by most American and Canadian universities, including Harvard 
Business School; TOEFL is used mainly by American universities, though also 
accepted in the UK and Australia. Next month we will examine the TOEFL exam; 
this month we will focus on IELTS.<br>
<br>
 IELTS stands for the International 
English Language Testing system. It operates on a nine point band, where a nine 
indicates that the student has a level of English equivalent to a highly 
educated native speaker, and it tests all four skills ( reading, writing, 
listening and speaking) in an academic context. Generally speaking, 
undergraduate students need to obtain a score of 5.5 overall to gain university 
admission and postgraduate students need a score of 6.5 overall. Some 
universities will ask for higher grades for all courses, or for specific 
programmes. The IELTS exam can be taken at centres worldwide and at frequent 
intervals throughout the year. Candidates pay a fee to take the exam.<br>
<br>
 
For language school owners the preparation courses for the IELTS exam are 
frequently a major source of income. IELTS is becoming increasingly popular 
throughout Asia and students usually need to attend a year long preparation 
course to do well enough in the exam to apply to an overseas university. There 
is a wealth of preparation material to use on these courses, including plenty 
of mock exam material. Teachers who are asked to teach IELTS should be given a 
thorough briefing on the demands of the exam and a brief training course. 
Details can be found on the IELTS website (www.ielts.org).</p>  By Carl Newbauer
