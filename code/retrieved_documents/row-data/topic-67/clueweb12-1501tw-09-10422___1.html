<h2> Learning English for IELTS or TOEFL </h2> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>TOEFL and IELTS are the two biggest standardized tests of the English 
language. These tests assess your reading, listening, speaking and writing 
skills. This article is a brief introduction about learning English forIELTS or 
TOEFL.</p> 
<p>The eye (physical eye and mind&rsquo;s eye) plays a major role in your 
English language learning process. Eye contact processes ideas unit by unit, 
helps to break sentences in correct places and to use stress on words which we 
wish to focus on before we begin to write or speak. When learning English for
IELTS or TOEFL, your reading, listening and understanding skills should be 
brought to perfection.</p> 
<p>As you read a sentence, the picture drawn by its words should appear to 
your mental eye. A complete sentence is a perfect picture. If you are unable to 
see this mental picture or get an unclear picture, you won&rsquo;t be able to 
give the correct answer to the question set to test you English language 
skills. To have a perfect picture, you must be able to break a sentence into 
component units. This is highly important in speaking.</p> 
<p>If you break the part of a sentence in wrong places, the examiner will 
grade your performance very poor. Moststudents preparing for IELTS and TOEFL 
never pay any attention to this. Isn&rsquo;t it absurd to break sentences in 
the manner of &lsquo; This is my&hellip;..book and&hellip;.. that is 
my&hellip;..pen..&rsquo; &lsquo; Then I&hellip;.. went to the&hellip;. railway 
station to&hellip; see my&hellip; friend off.&rsquo; They should be read or 
spoken as,&rsquo;This is&hellip;.my book&hellip;and&hellip;. that is&hellip;. 
my pen. &lsquo; Then&hellip;. I went&hellip;. to the railway station.. to 
see&hellip; my friend off.&rsquo; It is not correct to use a preposition and 
article together without a noun. But we commonly hear sound units like 
&lsquo;in the&rsquo;, &lsquo;on the&rsquo;, &lsquo; at the&rsquo;, &lsquo;under 
the&rsquo;, &lsquo;over the&rsquo; etc. So don&rsquo;t use this kind of English 
forIELTS or TOEFL.<br>
