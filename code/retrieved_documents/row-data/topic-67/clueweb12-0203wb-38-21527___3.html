<h2>YES, You Need To Take IELTS To Study In UK!</h2> 
<p>September 18th, 2009 &mdash; IELTS Preparation, TOEFL &amp; IELTS</p> 
<p>The English language requirements to study in the UK remain the same, 
despite the UK recently introducing new immigration rules for foreign students 
under Tier 4 of the Points Based System. International students still need to 
prove that they have adequate English skills. The IELTS remains the preferred 
test accepted by almost all higher education institutions in the UK.</p> 
<p>Indian students should first check with their chosen university or college 
the minimum English language ability required for admission. If the university 
or college has asked for proof of English language as part of their admission 
requirements, the applicant needs to provide the same documentary evidence to 
the visa officer when they lodge their visa application. The documents they 
send to the UK University for admission will also be seen by the visa officer 
and if the visa office isn&rsquo;t convinced with the documents the case may 
get rejected.</p> 
<p>The recent reports of fraudulent documentation have caused the testing 
process of IELTS to lose credibility. All IELTS test centers follow a detailed 
Code of Practice ensuring the highest standards of security throughout the 
testing process. Candidates are required to provide their passport as identity 
proof during registration. They are also required to carry the same on the day 
of the test. In addition, IELTS test centre administrators are extensively 
trained to detect imposters and fraudulent documents.</p> 
<p>Both, IELTS and TOEFL determine English language ability for admission to 
international institutions. Students are at loggerhead over which is the better 
test to take. Most candidates prefer IELTS because it is a written test and 
they can interact in person for their speaking module. The TOEFL test however, 
is internet-based and oral proficiency is tested by speaking to a computer.</p> 
<p>IELTS is recognized in over 2,000 UK universities and professional bodies 
whereas TOEFL is more popular in the US. Many institutions and recognizing 
authorities prefer IELTS and feel that the test gives a more accurate 
indication of a candidate&rsquo;s English language proficiency. Not 
surprisingly then, more Indians take IELTS than TOEFL.</p> 
<p>IELTS training institutes have been burgeoning all over the country. The 
IELTS partners are not responsible for controlling the quality standards of 
these training institutes. However, there are many training institutes in India 
that do a commendable job in preparing candidates for the test. Candidates 
usually hear of the notorious institutes through the grapevine and avoid the 
same.</p> 
<p>The IELTS score requirement is established by the universities or colleges, 
not the IELTS partners. Some universities or colleges accept slightly lower 
band scores, but follow it up with English language training for students 
before they start their formal studies abroad.</p> 
<p>Several popular exams are receiving the computer facelift. Although work 
continues on creating a computer-based IELTS test, the pen and paper version 
will continue due to its popularity with the teast takers.<br>
 Students 
applying for further studies in an English speaking country must have the 
required English language ability for success their objectives. Of late, there 
has been an increase in the number of UK visa application rejections. Hence, 
students must thoroughly check the educational qualification requirements 
listed by the college or university they wish to apply to.</p>

<h2>TOEFL iBT - Getting Started</h2> 
<p>September 18th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) evaluates a student&rsquo;s 
ability to understand and use English in a college and university environment 
&mdash; particularly in USA and Canada. The TOEFL score is a yardstick to 
measure adequate English skills necessary for admission to over 5000 colleges 
and accredited educational institutions across 90 countries. The UK, other 
European countries, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and 
Singapore all accept TOEFL scores.</p> 
<p>The TOEFL is now Internet based (TOEFL iBT). TOEFL iBT is not computer 
adaptive as was the case with TOEFL CBT (computer based test). Here, all the 
test takers receive the same set of questions. The computer tutorial is absent. 
It has been newly designed to churn out students capable of a better academic 
performance than before in the same English-speaking environment.</p> 
<p>TOEFL iBT tests students for English language communication skills such as 
Reading, Listening (receptive skills) and Speaking and Writing (expressive 
skills). The TOEFL score is equally divided between all four skills, and 
therefore, a student must do well in all sections.</p> 
<p>The exam has no grammar or sentence structure section. The student&rsquo;s 
knowledge of English grammar is tested through actual usage in speaking and 
writing sections. For the Speaking section, students are provided with 
headphones and must speak into a microphone. The digital recording is then 
transmitted to ETS Online Scoring Network to be rated by human scorers.</p> 
<p>A new development is that students are allowed to take notes. They can 
write down points while they listen and/or read before they start to speak or 
write. These notes come in handy during responses. These notes cannot be 
carried outside the examination center.</p> 
<p>The Writing section has been expanded to include one integrated writing 
task in addition to the independent writing task. The Reading section usually 
consists of three to five passages each of around 700 words. This section 
includes classifying information and/or filling in a chart or completion of a 
summary.</p> 
<p>Lectures and conversations that appear in the listening section maybe 
longer than before, but speech is more natural. Although the focus of the 
listening tasks remains American, expect at least one lecture in British 
/Australian accent. There is a possibility of questions that measure 
understanding of a speaker&rsquo;s attitude, degree of certainty and purpose.
</p> 
<p>TOEFL iBT has fixed test dates. Depending upon the number of test takers 
and the capacity, a test center will normally have 30 to 40 test dates in a 
year.</p> 
<p>TOEFL iBT scores are reported online. Students can view their scores within 
15 working days of the test. Score sheets will be delivered to the test-takers 
by mail.</p>

<h2>What To Expect In The TOEFL?</h2> 
<p>September 18th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The TOEFL iBt (Internet Based Test) evaluates test-takers on the basis of 
four sections of English language skills. These are reading, listening, 
speaking and writing. The TOEFL is for a duration of four hours with maximum 
time spent in the Reading and Listening sections.</p> 
<p><strong>Structure of Reading Test<br>
</strong>This section has the maximum 
number of questions with about 36-70. The Reading test includes three to five 
academic reading passages followed by comprehension questions. The 
student&rsquo;s ability to understand and analyse the meaning of the passages 
is tested. The question types are similar to those that appeared in the 
computer based TOEFL. Students are expected to demonstrate that they have 
learned what they have read, either by filling out a table or completing a 
narrative summary. Choose a correct paraphrase of a reading. The new features 
that make the testing experience easier and even include a glossary and review 
feature.</p> 
<p><strong>Structure of Listening Test<br>
</strong>The listening section has 
anything from 34-51 questions. The test involves the student listening to two 
to three conversations on their headphones. The conversations may include two 
or more speakers in each. Apart from this, there are four to six lectures, 
which include classroom dialogue. A positive development is that test-takers 
can now write down notes while listening. Again, the questions are similar to 
those that appeared in the TOEFL CBT. There will be a few new question types 
that measure ability to understand a speaker&rsquo;s attitude or meaning.</p> 
<p><strong>Structure of Speaking Test<br>
</strong> The speaking test consists 
of a total of six tasks. Two of the tasks are independent tasks about familiar 
topics. The test taker is required to state, explain and support their response 
using personal knowledge and experience.</p> 
<p>Two tasks are based on Reading and Listening material. These tasks include 
a short reading passage and a short talk. The questions require test takers to 
answer using the information provided in the reading and the listening 
material. One question is based on a campus-related situation, and the other is 
based on academic classroom material. Again, test takers can take notes and use 
the information to shape their responses.<br>
 The remaining two tasks are 
based on Listening material, including a short lecture or conversation. The 
questions require test takers to summarise key ideas from the talks in the 
responses.</p> 
<p>Test-takers are judged on the basis of the following criteria:<br>
<strong>
1. Topic development:</strong> The student&rsquo;s ability to understand the 
matter and draw connections between topics as well as their capability to 
convey relevant information.<br>
<strong>2. Delivery:</strong> The ability to 
use clear, smooth, sustained speech.<br>
<strong>3. Language use:</strong> 
Trained evaluators pay attention to the use of correct grammar and vocabulary. 
Close notice is paid to the response of logical answers.</p> 
<p>The six tasks in the Speaking section are rated by at least two human 
scorers on a scale of 0-4. The six individual scores are averaged to arrive at 
an aggregate value. This aggregate is converted to the scale of 0 to 30.</p> 
<p><strong>Structure of Writing Test<br>
</strong>The Writing test consists of 
a total of two tasks to be completed by the test taker. The first task could be 
a reading, listening or writing one &mdash; an academic reading followed by a 
lecture. Test takers must answer a question discussing the key points in the 
lecture and explain how they relate to those in the reading passage. The 
reading passage appears first, and then it is removed from the screen during 
the lecture. Test takers can view the passage again while responding to the 
question. The second task is an independent task about a familiar topic. Test 
takers must state their response and support it with information from personal 
knowledge and experience.</p> 
<p>Trained evaluators measure the ability to understand the material, as well 
as write clearly, accurately and in an organized manner. The two tasks are 
scored by at least two human scorers from 0 to 5 and then the raw scores are 
totaled/averaged before scaling them to the range of 0 to 30.</p> 
<p><strong>TOEFL score<br>
</strong> Each of the four sections of TOEFL iBT is 
scored on a scale of 0 to 30. The sectional scores are then added to arrive at 
a total score of 0 to 120. Each score corresponds to a percentile ranking. This 
displays how an individual&rsquo;s score compares with that of other students 
answering the test.</p> 
<p>The maximum score of 120 has a percentile of 100. Students will also 
receive information of what the numeric scores mean in terms of language skills 
and proficiency (high/medium/low), along with performance feedback including 
suggestions for improvement.</p>

<h2>8 Ways To Prepare For TOEFL iBT</h2> 
<p>September 18th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Research:</strong> Do your homework to find out the TOEFL 
score requirements of the college/ university you are interested in applying 
to. The average minimum score required is approximately 70. However, 
prestigious universities may demand higher scores.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Learn academic English:</strong> Campus and classroom 
conversation in the US is a little different that colloquial English spoken in 
India. Concentrate on the English used in these environments. Textbooks, 
encyclopedias, journals and research articles will get you acquainted with this 
kind of language.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Practice, Practice, Practice:</strong> Several textbooks 
with exercises, vocabulary, practice tests, CDs and explanatory answers are 
freely available in the market. The internet too, has copious amounts of free 
samples and information that you can have access to, in addition to your 
textbooks.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Develop Greater Concentration Skills:</strong> TOEFL iBT 
requires the student to sit at the computer for atleast four hours at a 
stretch. Most classes in colleges are for a span of two hours. Beyond this 
period, the student&rsquo;s concentration ability starts to dwindle. Organizing 
personal test sessions at home will help build performance and concentration 
and also help you time yourself. Remember to pack in a good night&rsquo;s sleep 
before the test to kill fatigue before the big day.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Listen Carefully:</strong> In the TOEFL iBT you are allowed 
to take notes in the listening section. When practicing at home, don&rsquo;t 
replay the CD more than once. The TOEFL iBT allows the test-taker to hear 
everything only once, without the option of replaying the passage. Train your 
ears to take in all the information in the first listen itself.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Read, Answer and Revise:</strong> Skim through the passage 
given and read the questions that follow. Then, return to the passage for 
details to answer those questions. The questions usually come in the order the 
information appears in the passage. Solving several practice tests helps gain a 
picture of the kind of questions that could be asked in the exam. Engrain the 
habit of revising your answer before you proceed to the next section.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Keep writing simple:</strong> Language used must be simple 
and clear. Don&rsquo;t be ambiguous. Stay away from unsure vocabulary and 
over-punctuating your sentences. Using examples to support your essay adds 
credibility. Transitional words and phrases makes the essay breezy. As a rule, 
revise what you have written.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Practice One-Minute Responses:</strong> Think up a list of 
familiar topics and practice speaking about them. Describe a familiar place or 
recount a personal experience and see how spontaneously you can come up with 
interesting points. Practice giving one-minute responses to topics.</p>

<p>In this series of posts we will cover the types of questions you will 
encounter on the<strong>Reading section</strong> of the TOEFL iBT test, as well 
as strategies you can use to improve your score in this section.</p> 
<p>The Reading section of the TOEFL present you with 3-5 passage of 
approximately 700 words. While the passages are all basically the same length, 
they become increasingly difficult as you progress, so while 20 minutes is 
allotted for reading and answering questions on the first passage, 40 minutes 
is given for reading and answering questions of the second, third, fourth and 
fifth passages. Each passage you are given will have between 12-14 questions, 
and we&rsquo;ll cover what types of questions you can except.</p> 
<p>1) Fact/Detail Questions<br>
 2) Not/Except Questions<br>
 3) Referent 
Questions<br>

</p> 
<p><strong>Quick tips:<br>
</strong><strong>* Familiarize yourself with the 
basic structure of the passages.</strong> These are short essays, expect and 
Introduction, some body paragraphs in which the details of the thesis will be 
expanded upon, and a concluding paragraph.<br>
<strong>* Read Actively.</strong>
 While completing your initial reading of the passage make brief notes on each 
paragraph (the key ideas or details given) to refer to later. This notes will 
come in handy when you answering the questions.<br>
<strong>* Get ready to 
infer meaning.</strong> Details will not always be presently openly to you. Be 
prepared to use the present details, combined with your own logic to figure out 
what the author is inferring/implying, even when they don&rsquo;t directly say 
it.</p> 
<p>There are a few things you can do to improve your overall score on this 
section. Can you guess the number one tip?<strong></strong></p> <strong> 
</strong> 
<p><strong>READ!</strong><br>
 Read English magazines, newspapers, blogs, 
books - anything that is interesting to you and will expose you to more of the 
English language. When you come across words you don&rsquo;t recognize, use 
your English language dictionary to translate the word and make a record of it 
in a journal you can refer to later.</p>

<h2>TOEFL Reading Section - Prose Summary Questions</h2> 
<p>August 20th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p><strong>Prose Summary Questions</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>These questions are also &lsquo;drag and drop&rsquo; style 
questions that will ask provide you with a main idea from the presented 
passage, and asks you to pick 3 sentences (out of a given 6) that express the 
most important ideas in the passage. You must choose at least 2 of the 3 
correct sentences to be awarded any points for this question.</p> 
<p><strong>How to deal:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>1. Treat the thesis provided as your guide. Choose answers 
that support this thesis.<br>
 2. Prepare for paraphrasing - the key ideas are 
important in these questions, not the specific vocabulary used.<br>
 3. 
Eliminate the overly specific options, or points that offer minor details. 
Remember, the focus of these questions is to test your ability to recognize a 
summary, which usually means a collection of important, but general points.<br>

 4. Make note of the key idea of each paragraph, and look for a combination of 
one paragraph or more in the offered summary sentence.</p> 
<p><strong>Watch out for:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>* Choices offering information that was never mentioned in 
the passage<br>
 * Choices offering information similar to what was in the 
passage, but that has been altered or distorted in some day.</p>

<h2>TOEFL Reading Section - Paraphrasing Questions</h2> 
<p>August 20th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p><strong>Paraphrasing Questions</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>These questions are about taking what you&rsquo;ve just 
read, and figuring out a new way to say it. These questions will provide you 
with a highlighted passage in the text and ask you which of the follow options 
best paraphrase the highlighted words. Remember, what&rsquo;s important here is 
keeping the meaning the same, not structure. Watch out from wrong answers that 
leave out important information, or add information that was not covered. There 
will be no more then 1 question of this type per reading passage.</p> 
<p><strong>How to deal:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>1. Locate the most important words within the highlighted 
passage and focus on them.<br>
 2. Watch for answers with synonyms, change of 
tense, or change in sentence structure yet still contain the key ideas of the 
highlighted passage.<br>
 3. Try rephrases the highlighted passage in your own 
words, the comparing your notes to the presented options.<br>
 4. Test your 
answer by reading it into the passage; check to ensure the same information is 
still being conveyed.</p> 
<p><strong>Watch out for:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>* Answers that have added or subtracted key points of 
information from the highlighted passage.<br>
 * Answers that use similar words 
but change the meaning. Ex: the highlighted passage specifically mentions a 
Tsunami, but one of the answers merely mentioned &lsquo;waves&rsquo;. A tsunami 
is not simply a regular wave, it significantly larger and causes much more 
destruction!</p>

<h2>TOEFL Reading Section - Coherence Questions</h2> 
<p>August 20th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p><strong>Coherence Questions</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>These questions, also called &lsquo;insert the text&rsquo; 
provide you with sample sentences that can be inserted into your reading 
passage at various points. Your job is to find where the given sentence fits in 
with the passage. You&rsquo;ll easily recognize these questions as the passage 
will be marked with black squares showing you where the sentences may be 
inserted. There will be no more then 1 question of this type per reading 
passage.</p> 
<p><strong>How to deal:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>1. Be familiar with paragraph structure. Recognize what 
types of sentences belong in which area of paragraph, for example, if 
you&rsquo;re given a description sentence, you&rsquo;ll know it belong near the 
beginning of the paragraph somewhere after the opening sentence.<br>
 2. Find 
the overall sequence of ideas in the passage. What are the key ideas of your 
given sentence? Do they match some existing key ideas already in the paragraph?
<br> 3. Look for matching vocabulary. This can be another clue as to wear to 
put the new sentence.<br>
 4. Compare the Rhetoric structure of the given 
sentence and the existing passages. If the given sentence is a description of 
the physical characteristics of a specific bird, look for the sentence that 
names, or provides an example of a unique bird.<br>
 5. Ask yourself if the 
sentences can be separated to narrow your choices. Ex: An example of such a 
bird is the peacock. [black square] The peacock&rsquo;s tail features have an 
eye pattern on them which serve as a defense mechanism, frightening away 
potential predators. Since the second sentence is a direct explanation of the 
first, they should not be separated. You would be able to rule this option out 
as a potential place to insert your new sentence.<br>
 6. Put the given 
sentence in the remaining options and reread them. Which makes the most logical 
sense?</p> 
<p><strong>Watch out for:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>* Assume that because two sentences share the same 
vocabulary, they must belong together. As mentioned above, they can be used as 
clues, but do not necessarily indicate a correct answer.<br>
 * Inserting the 
answer next to the correct sentence, but on the wrong side. Remember the square 
indicates exactly where the new sentence will be inserted, so pay close 
attention.</p>

<h2>TOEFL Reading Section - Rhetorical Structure Questions</h2> 
<p>August 20th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p><strong>Rhetorical Structure Questions</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>These questions will be about how the author of the 
passage supports key points of the passage through the use of details, 
specifically, description, examples, definitions and explanation. Before you 
can answer these questions you will have to know what details are being used 
and why they are being used. So take a moment to ask yourself, am I reading a 
description or an explanation? Why is the author presenting this description?
</p> 
<p>You will be faced with two types of Rhetorical Structure Questions. The 
first asks you to identify a particular idea, or ideas and questions you on the 
purpose. Ex: Why does the writer mention X? To emphasis Y. The second type of 
question presents a type of rhetorical structure and asks you how the writer 
accomplishes it. Ex: How does the author explain A? By comparing B and C. There 
will be no more then 2 question of this type per reading passage.</p> 
<p><strong>How to deal:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>1. Recognize types of details and other Rhetorical 
Structure. Are you looking at a description, a definition, an example, or an 
explanation? Is the author attempting to demonstrate, clarify, distinguish, 
expand, emphasize prove or refute something?<br>
 2. Identify the key ideas of 
the questions, locate them in the passage and reread the surround area 
carefully.<br>
 3. Get ready to infer meaning. You may be require to connect 
multiple phrases to form the complete answer.</p> 
<p><strong>Watch out for:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>* Answers that refer to another part of the passage<br>
 * 
Answers that provide similar, but unmentioned or altered ideas.</p>

<h2>TOEFL Reading Section - Inference Questions</h2> 
<p>August 20th, 2009 &mdash; TOEFL &amp; IELTS, TOEFL Preparation</p> 
<p><strong>Inference Questions</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>These questions will be asking you to find the implicit, 
inferred, or implied meaning of a passage - to understand ideas that have not 
be directly stated by the author. Answering these questions will require you to 
pay attention to the details that are mentioned and use logic to fid the 
implied meaning. These questions can be recognized relatively easily as they 
most often include the words infer, suggest, or imply. There will be no more 
then 2 question of this type per reading passage, and there may not be any at 
all.</p> 
<p><strong>How to deal:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>1. Identify the key idea(s) or theme in question. Make 
sure you&rsquo;re looking for the idea and not the word since you&rsquo;re 
attempting to infer something you won&rsquo;t find in the text. Ex: If the 
questions is asking &lsquo;Which of the following can be inferred about 
Jim&rsquo;s time as a student&rsquo; look for the paragraph that discusses 
Jim&rsquo;s time at school.<br>
 2. Once you locate the key idea/theme, read 
the relevant sentences carefully to make sure you completely understand the 
information<br>
 3. Look for cohesive devices (which may be adverbs, 
adjectives, transitions, repetition, etc) that connect various ideas in the 
text.<br>
 4. Check your final choice against the given passage and ask 
yourself, does this make logical sense?</p> 
<p><strong>Watch out for:</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong></strong>* Wrong answers that list information that isn&rsquo;t 
correct. Inferred information must still be correct.<br>
 * Facts/details 
choices. The question is asking you to infer something, meaning the answer 
won&rsquo;t be stated in the passage.</p>
