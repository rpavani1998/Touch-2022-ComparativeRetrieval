<h1> Which is Better, the IELTS or the TOEFL Test? </h1> <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>For many years, the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) was the 
exam most U.S. colleges and universities relied on to measure and test English 
language skills exhibited by applicants from non-English speaking countries. 
Worldwide, that was not the case. Another test, the International English 
Language Testing System (IELTS), was the exam required by most other 
English-speaking countries, including Britain and Australia, to test English 
language skills. The IELTS is often considered to be the only test that can 
compete with the TOEFL test in the United States.</p> 
<h2>The TOEFL test did not match the IELTS in all areas</h2> 
<p>With its live, one-on-one component, the IELTS has been viewed by many as a 
superior exam for evaluating the spoken English skills of potential students. 
Until recently, the TOEFL had no such component and many of the countries 
requiring the IELTS felt that a speech component to an English proficiency exam 
was crucial.</p> 
<p>Whether or not the IELTS is a better exam really seems to be a matter of 
opinion. However, its acceptance as an assessment tool has grown in the United 
States in recent years. In addition to the TOEFL, more than&nbsp;3,000 
U.S.&nbsp;institutions and programs&nbsp;now accept the IELTS as well. You can 
see a list of these&nbsp;institutions and programs, the IELTS Recognition List, 
athttp://ielts.org/usa.aspx.&nbsp;For the most part, the choice of which test 
to take is up to you.</p> 
<h2>The TOEFL iBT is playing catch up</h2> 
<p>So, which test is better? It depends on who you ask! Some schools remain 
firmly devoted to the IELTS and its interactive, personalized-speech format. On 
the other hand, the TOEFL gained some ground globally when it introduced its 
Internet-based test (TOEFL iBT) format with its new recorded-speech portion. 
With both tests now offering the ability to test spoken language, and the TOEFL 
spreading its Internet-based testing ability across the globe, the TOEFL has 
seen upward spikes in number of users in various parts of the world.</p> 
<h2>Do you need to prepare for the IELTS or the TOEFL test?</h2> 
<p>Internet-based testing is just getting started for the IELTS. The current 
IELTS format is expected to stay around for at least a few more years and, 
worldwide, many test-prep and coaching companies prepare students for the 
IELTS. On the other hand, test-prep companies are still a bit stumped by the 
TOEFL iBT, and preparation lessons and techniques for the iBT are still being 
developed. Certainly, both tests offer sample materials to potential 
test-takers, but if you have the choice of preparing for one test or the other 
with a professional test coach, you may prefer the IELTS, as long as the 
schools you're applying to will accept it.</p> 
<h2>Both the TOEFL iBT and the IELTS now evaluate speech</h2> 
<p>As far as speech evaluation goes, there is no definitive rule on which test 
is better. Some say the individualized IELTS format is great, while others 
think there's a potential for bias and an even greater chance of inconsistency 
in scoring due to individual nuances of the examiners. Critics of the IELTS 
believe that the panel review of recorded speech for the TOEFL test is a more 
accurate, less biased mechanism for evaluation.</p> 
<h2>Which will you take, the IELTS or the TOEFL test?</h2> 
<p>Ultimately, the test you take will probably be guided by which test is 
required by the school(s) to which you are applying. If both are acceptable, 
the availability of testing locations and cost will probably play a significant 
role in your decision. Both tests have Web sites that can answer many of your 
questions and that maintain up-to-date news on the progression of their 
Internet-based test expansions. For most testing dates and locations, you can 
register online for most testing dates and locations. The Web is also a good 
access point for sample test materials and testing tips. It is a great place to 
begin planning your IELTS or TOEFL preparation so that in the end, you earn the 
best IELTS or TOEFL score you can.</p>
