<p>There is a wide choice of English tests available, but often English 
students are asked to choose between the IELTS or TOEFL exam. Often it is the 
students' choice as both exams are accepted as meeting the entry requirements 
for academic settings. However, in some cases the IELTS is requested for visa 
purposes to Canadian or Australian immigration. If this is not the case, you 
have even more to choose from and may want to review this guide to choosing an 
Engish test before you decide on the IELTS or TOEFL.</p> 
<p>As it is often up to the English test taker to decide which of these two 
(or three as IELTS has two versions) exams, here is a guide to making the 
decision. To begin with, here are some points to take into consideration before 
you decide whether to take the IELTS or the TOEFL exam. Take note of your 
answers:</p> 
<p></p> 
<ul> <br>

<li>Do you need the IELTS or the TOEFL for academic English?</li> 
<li>Are you more comfortable with North American or British / UK accents?</li> 
<li>Do you feel more comfortable with a wide range of North American 
vocabulary and idiomatic expressions or British English vocabulary and 
idiomatic expressions?</li> 
<li>Can you type relatively fast?</li> 
<li>Do you want to finish the test as quickly as possible?</li> 
<li>Do you feel comfortable with a wide range of question types?</li> 
<li>Are you proficient at taking notes?</li> </ul> 
<p></p> 
<p>These questions are very important because the IELTS exam is maintained by 
the University of Cambridge, whereas the TOEFL exam is provided by ETS, a US 
company based in New Jersey. Both tests are also different in how the test is 
administered. Here are considerations for each question when deciding between 
the IELTS or the TOEFL.</p> 
<p><b>Do you need the IELTS or the TOEFL for academic English?</b></p> 
<p>If you need the IELTS or TOEFL for academic English, then keep answering 
these questions. If you don't need the IELTS or TOEFL for academic English, for 
example for immigration, take the general version of the IELTS. It is much 
easier than either the IELTS academic version or the TOEFL!</p> 
<p><b>Are you more comfortable with North American or British / UK accents?</b>
</p> 
<p>If you have more experience with British English (or Australian English), 
take the IELTS as vocabulary and accents tend more towards British English. If 
you watch a lot of Hollywood movies and like US idiomatic language, choose the 
TOEFL as it reflects American English.</p> 
<p><b>Do you feel more comfortable with a wide range of North American 
vocabulary and idiomatic expressions or British English vocabulary and 
idiomatic expressions?</b></p> 
<p>Same answer as above! IELTS for British English TOEFL for American English.
</p> 
<p><b>Can you type relatively fast?</b></p> 
<p>As you will read below in the section on key differences between the IELTS 
or TOEFL, the TOEFL requires that you type your essays in the written section 
of the test. If you type very slowly, I would strongly recommend taking the 
IELTS as you handwrite your essay responses.</p> 
<p><b>Do you want to finish the test as quickly as possible?</b></p> 
<p>If you become extremely nervous during a test and want the experience to 
end as quickly as posable, the choice between IELTS or TOEFL is easier. The 
TOEFL lasts approximately four hours, whereas the IELTS is significantly 
shorter - about 2 hours 45 minutes. Remember, however, that shorter does not 
necessarily mean easier!</p> 
<p><b>Do you feel comfortable with a wide range of question types?</b></p> 
<p>The TOEFL exam is made up of almost entirely multiple choice questions. The 
IELTS, on the other hand, has a much wider range of question types including 
multiple choice, gap fill, matching exercises, etc. If you do NOT feel 
comfortable with multiple choice questions, the TOEFL is not the test for you.
</p> 
<p><b>Are you proficient at taking notes?</b></p> 
<p>Note taking is important on both the IELTS and the TOEFL. However, it is 
much more critical on the TOEFL exam. As you will read below, the listening 
section in particular depends on note taking skills in the TOEFL as you answer 
questions after you have listened to a longer selection. The IELTS asks you to 
answer questions as you listen to the exam.</p> 
<p><b>Major Differences between the IELTS and the TOEFL</b></p> 
<p><b>Reading</b></p> 
<p><b><i>TOEFL</i></b> - You will have 3 - 5 reading selections of twenty 
minutes each. Reading materials are academic in nature. Questions are multiple 
choice.</p> 
<p> <b><i>IELTS</i></b> - 3 reading selections of twenty minutes each. 
Materials are, as in the case of the TOEFL, related to an academic setting. 
There are multiple type questions (gap fill, matching, etc.)</p> 
<p><b>Listening</b></p> 
<p><b><i>TOEFL</i></b> - The listening selection very different from the 
IELTS. In the TOEFL, you will have 40 - 60 minutes worth of listening 
selections from lectures or campus conversations. Take notes and respond to 
multiple choice questions.</p> 
<p><b><i>IELTS</i></b> - The largest difference between the two exams is in 
listening. In the IELTS exam there are a wider variety of question types, as 
well as exercises of differing lengths. You will answer questions as you move 
through the listening selection of the test.</p> 
<p><b>Writing</b></p> 
<p><b><i>TOEFL</i></b> - Two written tasks are required on the TOEFL and all 
writing is done on the computer. Task one involves writing a five paragraph 
essay of 300 to 350 words. Note taking is important as the second task asks you 
to take notes from a reading selection in a text book and then a lecture on the 
same topic. You are then asked to respond using notes by writing a 150 - 225 
word selection integrating both the reading and listening selection.</p> 
<p><b><i>IELTS</i></b> - The IELTS also has two tasks: the first a short essay 
of 200 - 250 words. The second IELTS writing task asks you to look at an 
infograhic such as a graph or chart and summarize the information presented.</p>
<p><b>Speaking</b></p> 
<p><b><i>TOEFL</i></b> - Once again the speaking section differs greatly 
between the TOEFL and the IELTS exams. On the TOEFL you are asked to record 
responses on the computer of 45 - 60 seconds to six different questions based 
on short descriptions / conversations. The speaking section of the test lasts 
20 minutes.</p> 
<p><b><i>IELTS</i></b> - The IELTS speaking section lasts from 12 to 14 
minutes and takes place with an examiner, rather than a computer as on the 
TOEFL. There is a short warm up exercise consisting mainly of small talk, 
followed by a response to some sort of visual stimulus and, finally, a more 
extended discussion on a related topic.</p>
