<h1>IELTS vs TOEFL: WHICH IS BETTER?</h1> 
<h3>August 20th, 2010 posted by Paul McWilliams</h3> 
<p><strong>If you are applying to university in an English speaking country 
and English is not your first language, you may need to meet certain language 
requirements dictated by the institution. In the majority of cases this 
involves taking a standardised test. There are two main English language tests 
accepted by universities around the world,IELTS (International English Language 
Testing Service) andTOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). But the big 
question that faces students is; which one is better?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>The similarities</strong></p> 
<p>Both are English language tests aimed at pre-university students planning 
to make the step to higher education. Both evaluate how well you can combine 
your listening, reading, writing and speaking skills. You have to pay a fee to 
take both tests, for both it can vary depending on where exactly you take the 
test but expect to pay between $150 to $250.</p> 
<p><strong>The differences</strong></p> 
<p>Although both tests ostensibly focus on the same thing, they do so in 
different ways, which is why so many students want to know which is better (and 
even more commonly, which is easier). One of the main differences is the 
speaking part of the test. For IELTS you are required to take this with an 
IELTS examiner face to face. For TOEFL the speaking test consists of six 
questions which you answer into a microphone. These are recorded and sent to an 
examiner to mark.</p> 
<p>The scoring system is also different, with IELTS rating between 0 and 9, 
with halfway points in between. TOEFL gives a more numerical SAT-type grade, 
totalling your scores from all the areas. This gives an insight into another 
key difference. TOEFL is administered by theEducational Testing Service, a 
non-profit US based organisation, and conducts its test according to US 
English. IELTS is administered jointly by theBritish Council, the University of 
Cambridge ESOL Examinations and IDP Education Australia, and conducts its test 
in UK English. While the differences are not as great as some assume, accents 
and spelling variations can cause a problem for some students.</p> 
<p><strong>So which is better?</strong></p> 
<p>The answer really depends on you; what kind of learner you are and where 
you want to study. The question of which is easier is largely irrelevant as 
both tests will grade you accurately according to your level of English. TOEFL 
may tend to favour more abstract learners as many of the questions are multiple 
choice whereas IELTS may be more suited to concrete learners as it involves 
memory recall. The face to face speaking section of the IELTS may be daunting 
to some candidates who would be more comfortable speaking into a microphone</p> 
<p>Finally, it may be necessary to check that your chosen institution accepts 
the test. Although both are accepted at more than 6,000 institutions and 
organisations worldwide, so there is a fairly good chance you will be able to 
use either, it is always necessary to check beforehand.</p> 
<p>Have you taken either or perhaps both of these tests? Let us know your 
impressions, what you thought was good and bad about each test and most 
importantly which you would recommend. Your experiences can help fellow 
learners.</p>

<p>Dear Kapulito,</p> 
<p>Thank you for your comment. That isn&rsquo;t necessarily correct; the 
language tests accepted will vary from institution to institution &ndash; you 
should contact the institutions you are interested in to ask about their 
English language requirements and what tests they will accept as proof of your 
ability. We can&rsquo;t recommend one over the other, as which one is best will 
depend on your individual circumstances. If you would like more information 
about studying in the USA or the UK, see ourUSA magazines (click here), and our 
UK magazine (click here). You could also fill out an enquiry form at 
i-studentenquiry- our free matching service that can help match you with 
institutions according to your preferences.</p> 
<p>Hopefully this information will help, best of luck with your research</p> 
<p>Best wishes from the i-studentgroup team</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;IELTS is administered jointly by the British Council, the University 
of Cambridge ESOL Examinations and IDP Education Australia, and conducts its 
test in UK English.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is actually not true. The IELTS listening section features dialog from 
English speakers all around the world; British, North American, Australian etc. 
Moreover, the examiners are from numerous English speaking countries as well. 
This is in my opinion one advantage the IELTS has over the TOEFL.</p> </li>

<p>I think a student having better toefl score is much more qualified than 
having better IELTS scores.Many more students who make better score in IELTS 
fail to make 80 in toefl ibt. IELTS is actually a much easier test than toefl 
ibt.</p> </li>

<p>Hello everybody. I took both IELTS and TOEFL(IELTS: listening-7.5, 
writing-7.0, speaking-7.5 nad reading:7.0. In total:7.0 I havent recieved TOEFL 
score yet) so here are my impressions( i would like to describe each section of 
one test and compare it to respective one in another and give my honest 
opinion):</p> 
<p>Let me start with listening:<br>
 As you know in IELTS it consisitsof 4 
sections and 10 questions inn each. You have time to read questions before you 
listen. This structure is quite simple, and you can spend less energy on each 
question. However, in TOEFL, you are given slightly more questions but more 
situations. So i thought in this section TOEFL was more difficult.</p> 
<p> Speaking. Speaking to microphone(conversation with computer) in TOEFL, for 
me was more complicated for several reasons:<br>
 1. Microphone itself was not 
of good qualiti and i had to halfy close it with hands.<br>
 2. Some other 
students were talking when i was trying to do the same.<br>
 In IELST test you 
are given separete room with examiner(HUMAN). They are trained to make you feel 
as if you are talking to one of your friends.</p> 
<p>By now :IELTS :2 TOEFL: 0</p> 
<p>Reading: Here i&rsquo;d prefer TOEFL to IELTS also for some reasons:<br>
 
1. Reading passages are not so long<br>
 2. Question types.</p> 
<p>Writing:<br>
 Absolute winner, in my opinion, is TOEFL IBT. let me explain 
why:<br>
 First of all you type essays instead of writing it by hand. As a 
result you can easily correct it or reorgonize without changing the visiual 
impression.<br>
 secondly, you are given plenty of time(so if you can type 
quickly it is big plus)</p> 
<p>Conclusion: Everything i have written is only my opinion of both tests and 
i hope that my &rdquo; review will be helpful for some of you in future.</p>

<p>i have taken IELTS 2 years before, my score not so good, 5.5 
(6.5-listening, 5.5 reading, 4.5-writing, 5.5-speaking). i plan to have another 
test this year, but i&rsquo;m not either IELTS or TOEFL.</p> 
<p>it seems for IELTS i have very much weaknesses in </p> 
<p>Reading- the passage was too long, i cant concerntrate and nervous, plus 
worried for not having much time. again i spend to much time to understand the 
long passage, and i missed to answer correctly the last part of reading which 
is much easier.</p> 
<p>Writing-my hand writing was too bad. truly messy. also not having much 
time. i&rsquo;m prefer writing using computer.</p> 
<p>Speaking-the person who carry out my test her face to irritate. especially 
when i express something wrong her face suddenly change. its really pyscho me.
</p> 
<p>Speaking-this is ok for me..more relax. may be my score due to spelling 
error. i also saw a lot of english movie. may be i can improve this part.</p> 
<p>so, according to my overall experience, i really dont know which is more 
suitable fro me.<br>
 please anybody advice accordingly.</p> </li>

<p>Hi Supertramp,</p> 
<p>As the article mentions, it depends on how you best learn. If you are good 
at memorising things and repeating them, IELTS will be better, and TOEFL is 
better for people who are more abstract learners.</p> 
<p>Either way, you should do everything you can to improve your English before 
taking the test &ndash; read English websites and watch TV and movies that are 
in English. Find someone to practice with, and write each other letters in 
English and have conversations with English speakers.</p> 
<p>Good luck!</p> </li> </ol>
