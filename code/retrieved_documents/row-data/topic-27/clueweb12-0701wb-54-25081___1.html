<h3>Certified Fireplace Barriers Approved for Gas Fireplace Fronts</h3> 
<p>The CSA America Vented Gasfired Warm Air Heaters Technical Advisory Group 
met in Cleveland, Ohio, on December 13, 2011, and approved language mandating 
certified barriers to protect children and other at-risk people from the glass 
fronts of gas fireplaces. This recommendation for a revised standard now goes 
to the CSA Z21.50 and Z21.88 committees for their review.</p>

would mean that a gas fireplace or gas heater must include a certified barrier

educating homeowners on safety precautions to be taken when using their

<h3>Take the New Food Pyramid to the Grill</h3> 
<p>The USDA over-hauled the Food Pyramid in 2011 using a plate to show 
portions of protein, vegetables, fruits, grains and dairy. For many of us 
adding more fruits and vegetables to our daily diets is difficult. For picky 
eaters it&rsquo;s really a challenge to choke down all those vegetables that 
are so good for us!&nbsp; The outdoor grill is the perfect place to bring more 
fruit and vegetables to the plate- and it&rsquo;s a fun and healthy way to 
expand our grill repertoire- not our waistline.</p> 
<p>Lets face it - we need to grill less beef but that does not have to mean 
grilling less. The challenge is to get out of the beef mindset by mixing up the 
protein choices. There are many healthy and tasty alternatives to beef such as 
ground turkey, poultry and fish. Fill the remaining grill space with vegetables

Pellet Heat</h3> 
<p>At an event in Colville, Washington, in September 2011, legislators 
(including U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R&ndash;WA) affirmed 
their support for bringing pellet heat into the forefront of 
government-supported renewable energies, in the state of Washington and beyond.

power, have been classified as renewable and receive government support, 
including tax incentives.</p>
