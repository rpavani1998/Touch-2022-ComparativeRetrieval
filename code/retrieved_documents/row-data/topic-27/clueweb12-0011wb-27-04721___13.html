reprint manuals. </li> 
<li>Q: Can the grates and burner heads on my stove be refinished/reporcelained?
</li> 
<li>A: Yes! If they are not broken or burned through, if the parts are broken 
or burned through. If your parts are broken or burned through we can repair 
most grates and burner heads at an additional cost. Toreporcelain the grates 
(what you set the pots &amp; pans on) and burner heads (what the fire comes out 
of). It generally takes 10 working days from the time we receive the parts and 
payment to have your parts ready to reship. You can send them one side at a 
time if you cannot do without them for that long. Another option would be to 
ship them to us right before you go on vacation. We can also sometimesexchange 
your good, but ugly, parts for parts that have already been reporcelained. It 
would depend upon whether or not we have them in stock. </li> 
<li>Q: Why should I have the grates and burner heads on my stove refinished? 
</li> 
<li>A: There are several reasons you should consider having the grates and 
burner heads reporcelained here are a few:</li> 
<li>Porcelain is a protective coating against the constant heat from the flame 
at the burner head and to the grate.</li> 
<li>Once the porcelain coating has burnt away it can cause damage to the cast 
iron parts. Such as holes to burner heads and cracks to grates.</li> 
<li>New porcelain coatings can add many more years of care free use to the 
stove.</li> 
<li>Cleaning is much easier once the parts have been reporcelained. </li> 
<li>It adds a fresh new look to the stove top making the stove look new and 
well cared for.</li> 
<li>For more information and photos click this link reporcelain </li> 
<li>Q: The chrome parts on my old stove are scratched up or rusted. Can they 
be rechromed?</li> 
<li>A: Yes! If they are not pitted badly they can usually be rechromed. Most 
scratches and light surface rust can be removed prior to being rechromed. 
Occasionally a piece is so badly pitted that the pits cannot be completely 
removed. It generally takes 2-4 weeks from time we receive the parts and 
payment to have your parts ready to reship. </li> 
<li>Q: Can I take my chrome pieces to a local chrome shop and have the work 
done instead of sending the parts to you?</li> 
<li>A: Yes! But please click the link to view one of many email's that we 
receive, about why you should use our service instead of using your local 
chrome shop that is not familiar with the old stoves.chrome services </li> 
<li>Q: I have chips in the porcelain on parts of my old stove. Can they be 
restored?</li> 
<li>A: Most parts can be reporcelained to like new condition. We can quote you 
prices to reporcelain the pieces that you need to have reporcelained. Some 
parts cannot be reporcelained to look exactly like the original part. An 
example would be a front control panel with lettering that is made into the 
porcelain. The part can be reporcelained, but it will no longer have the 
lettering.</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Sometimes the metal is too thin to be reporcelained. The old porcelain has 
to be sandblasted off before new porcelain can be fired on. If the metal is too 
thin because of rust or too much exposure to flame, it will pinhole or blow 
through during the sandblasting.Click here for reporcelain information</p> 
<p></p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Q: The temperature control on my oven doesn't seem to work. The 
temperature in the oven is not what it says on the control. Can this be 
corrected?</li> 
<li>A: The thermostat (temperature control) is no longer working properly and 
it needs to be rebuilt. We can usually rebuild your original thermostat, 
assuming no one else has taken it apart and the pieces are all there. 
Replacement thermostats are available, but they are expensive, and will not 
match the style of your stove.Replacement Thermostat You MUST HAVE a 
rebuildable ORIGINAL thermostat, or we will have to provide you with one. If 
you do not have the original, or if pieces are missing from your original, the 
price will be considerably higher. Contact us for a quote and instructions on 
how to arrange a rebuild.More rebuild information is here. </li> 
<li>Q: The adjustment valves on my stove top burners are difficult to turn, 
don't turn at all, or they don't work right. Can you fix them?</li> 
<li>A: Yes! The burner valves can be rebuilt to turn and function properly. 
Again, you must have original valves for us to rebuild (no replacement valves). 
If you don't have the originals, the price will be considerably higher. Contact 
us for a quote and instructions on how to arrange a rebuild.Burner valve 
rebuild information is here. </li> 
<li>Q: Can I have my chipped porcelain pieces powder coated, or should they be 
reporcelained?</li> 
<li>A: You should have the pieces reporcelained. Powder coating will not 
withstand the temperatures reached during the cooking process, it will 
discolor. Porcelain will remain beautiful for years.Click here for reporcelain 
information </li> 
<li>Q: I don't know how or I don't want to remove the parts that I want to 
have restored what can I do?</li> 
<li>A: You can call an appliance repair company or a handyman to remove &amp; 
reinstall the parts that you want to send to us for restoration. If they have 
any questions they can call us for help. </li> 
<li>Q: Can you assess the value of my stove? </li> 
<li>A: Yes we need at least 4 quality photos of your stove we charge $25.00 
per stove ( no jpeg or gif photos) See our assessment pageMore assessment 
information here </li> 
<li>Q: Can you reporcelain my bathtub or sink? </li> 
<li>A: No! It is a different process than we use. </li> 
<li>Q: Can you restore my wood burning or electric stove? </li> 
<li>A: No! We only restore antique gas stoves. </li> 
<li>Q: Can you install modern electronic igniters in my antique gas stove? 
</li> 
<li>A: No! It is against California state law to change or modify any system, 
along with the fact that you would ruin the best cooking features of the stove.
