 'Kay, I found a beautiful old gas 
stove/oven for FREEE!!!! Some apartment owner was remodeling, I guess.<br>
<br>

Anyway, one of the ones they were throwing out is in terrific shape -- only a 
couple of chips. However, there's a sticker on it that says that it has no 
pilot. So, I guess you have to light it with a match every time you use it?<br>

<br>My question is, an older gas stove like this (with no pilot) be 
&quot;upgraded&quot; with an electronic igniter? I've searched on the internet, 
but haven't exactly been able to figure out what to use in the search. I did 
find one antique gas stove refurbisher who said that it's illegal in the state 
of California to modify this sort of thing. But, hey, I live in Arizona! :D<br>

<br>The flip side of this is: maybe it's actually better to have NO electronic 
ignition and NO pilot???? Maybe there are some hard-core people who love fewer 
gadgets (I'm kinda in that camp) who could offer me some advice??? Maybe there 
really aren't more dangers to using a non-piloted gas stove???<br>
<br>
Thanks 
so much!<br>

 It is more 
dangerous to not have a pilot, if you bump a handel and turn on the gas even 
slightly, you have a very bad situation. If you have kids, I would never risk 
it, being the little handle bumpers that they are !<br>
There are conversion 
kits, but they should be instaled by a pro . All told it adds up to $$$$ Some 
of the old stoves are worth it though. Most building codes reguire safty 
devices on all gas appliances, requiring the modifacation for your stove, to be 
sold or used. join to post <br>

 Those older 
gas stoves are usually way better than the new ones.<br>
<br>
Reason: <br>
New 
ones have to comply with the newer code regs for consumer stoves. Apparantly 
the idiot lawmakers think we can't have a reasonably hot burner so they have 
down grades the BTU speccs for stoves. The old stoves were mmanufactured with 
fewer or no regulations.<br>
 They cook your food gaster at higher tempratures. 
<br> <br>
Most residential gas cook tops cwill not produce more than 16 to 20 
thousand BTUs<br>
That is entirely too little heat. <br>
<br>
A decent 
commercial burner will produce 26 - 36 thousand BTUs<br>
<br>
The older stoves 
are the shizzille.<br>
<br>
The pioot light issue is a non issue. You just 
light the thing.<br>

 I used to 
have a vintage 40's Maytag stove and I loved it. Lots of room on top to put 
things while you were cooking, and it had an oven you could turn off half way 
through and it retained the heat. Unfortunately, the oven pilot light kept 
going out, and the idiot who came to fix it ended up irreparably breaking 
it...banged things with a hammer that shouldn't have been banged, and broke a 
piece off. Unfortunately, after an extensive local and internet search, I 
couldn't find the replacement part.<br>
<br>
I ended up buying a new GE stove 
which I had for a few years and hated it. No room on the top of the stove to 
put anything. Badly insulated oven...compared with the old Maytag. And the 
burners were wimpy...didn't get hot enough. The electronic ignition was 
touchy...wouldn't work if you got the littlest bit of grease on the burner. 
Most of the time I had to light it by hand.<br>
<br>
Now I have my Mom's 
vintage 50's Magic Chef. Had to get used to the hotter burners again, but I 
wouldn't trade it for the world. The oven doesn't have a pilot light so it has 
to be lit by hand. The burners do have a pilot. If I remember right, you can 
cap off the pilots to the top burners, but depending on the state you live in 
it may not be legal.<br>
<br>
At any rate...if you have someone come in to fix 
the stove, make sure you ask ahead of time if they can repair vintage stoves. 
The idiot that broke my Maytag wanted to charge me for the service call. Sorry, 
but I don't pay people for breaking things.<br>

 lowes sells 
piezo electric starter conversion kits for $30 for a two burner model. $15 for

 Thanks for 
all the replies! I now have great info, should that same opportunity appear 
again! (It was just me with my two boys, in a vehicle too small to pick it up. 
:( )<br>
<br>
I don't remember what brand the stove was -- it definitely wasn't 
a major brand. I would guess it was a 40s - 50s stove. White enamel, four 
burners with a big empty (enameled) spot on top for setting pans and spoon 
rests, and the bottom part was sorta divided in half -- two big doors with the 
oven on the right, and two drawers below -- again the broiler on the right. 
Really basic, but in pretty awesome shape!<br>
<br>
I think I'm going to hold 
out for an older Magic Chef when we do our big kitchen remodel!<br>
<br>
<br>

Thanks, again!<br>

P.S. I DO 
have two small boys (almost 6 and 4 yrs old), so the point about the knobs 
being bumped and turning on the gas is a concern. However, do you think that 
they make knobs for it that have a &quot;catch&quot; or &quot;lock&quot; or 
something to help prevent that? (Kinda like the regular gas stove knobs, where 
you have to push IN, then turn them.)<br>
<br>
Another option is to possibly 
consider something like this for that outdoor kitchen that I posted about a 
couple of weeks ago! I should be able to just disconnect the gas when I'm not 
expecting to use it, shouldn't I? (What would be the procedure for that, 
anyway?) join to post <br>

 My stove is a 
1950 Wedgewood. To turn the knobs, you have to push them all the way in, then 
turn. HIghly unlikely you could turn them on by accident. It's not easy to do 
it on purpose! join to post <br>

 Oh, Wedgewood 
is one of my dream stoves! I'd love one of those! But, I'm not expecting to be 
able to afford a nice refurbished one of those. But, who know? :D<br>

<br>
if safety is a 
concern, you should be able to do this either inside or out, the only reason 
the keep gas running to a stove is to feed the pilot.<br>
<br>
most homes that 
have a gas line to the kitchen will have a valve to cut the line right before 
it hits the stove. if you sont have one, you should. its a simple, in-line 
valve, and depending on where it is installed, you could easily turn off gas to 
the whole stove when not in use.<br>
<br>
this makes lighting the stove a three 
step process (1. gas to stove, 2. light a match, 3. gas to burner) but if you 
can hang with that, its unlikely your boys will ever turn on the gas by mistake.

 Thanks,

That question was regarding using this kind of stove in an 
outdoor kitchen. It likely wouldn't be used every day, and we'd be either doing 
the connection ourselves, or hiring a plumber, so we could put an in-line valve 
in if we want to. In other words, we wouldn't be stuck with whatever is there. 
I can't believe I didn't even think that gas lines would have the same kind of 
mechanism as water plumbing! Of COURSE you can put in a shut-off valve! D'oh! 
{slaps forehead}<br>
<br>
Overall, it sounds like a really good option! <br>

 most of my 
experience with outdoor gas lines is on gas grills, and yes, typically you turn 
off the gas on the pipe between uses. as i said, i think this is pretty much 
code for any gas line in most states. join to post <br>

<br> <br>
The dials for turning/adjusting the heat on/off fell of my brothers 
outdoor-buiilt-in BBQ and he adjusts with pliers.... reading this section of 
your post - a mental image of him adjusting the BBQ flashed into my mind...... 
removing the knobs would make them kid proof join to post <br>
