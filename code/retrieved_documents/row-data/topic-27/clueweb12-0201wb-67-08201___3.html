Hi, Just to let you know that our fire is in, working and could not be better. 
Your advice and superb customer service is the best I have ever received both 
before and after the sale. To find a company who take the time and trouble to 
give such service to their customers as yours is hard to find. It has been a 
pleasure to have dealt with you. I will certainly be recommending your company 
to all my friends and relatives.</em> <br>
<strong>Mr J Sharples</strong> <br>

<br> <em></em><em>Thank you for all your support on my query. I am very 
impressed at the high level of customer service offered post sale by HotPrice. 
You dealt with my query promptly and professionally and demonstrated your
