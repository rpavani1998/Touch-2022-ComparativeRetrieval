<p>Broseley Thurcroft Flueless Portable Gas Stove</p> 
<p>The Broseley Thurcroft Mobile Gas Stove has a realistic living flame that 
gives the warmth, appearance and atmosphere of a traditional stove</p> 
<p>If you feel a chill anywhere around the house, just wheel your mobile 
heater to wherever you need it. Mobile heaters are highly efficient, providing 
instant heat and better control over your fuel costs</p> 
<p>Self contained gas cylinder housed within body of stove</p> 
<p>No installation or chimney required</p> 
<p>100% efficient with a maximum heat output of 2.4kW</p> 
<p>Up to 60 hours burning time from one 7 kg Butane bottle (not supplied)</p> 
<p>Peace of mind from an atmosphere sensing device which turns off the gas if 
the flame goes out or if the level of oxygen in the room falls below a 
recognised safe level</p> 
<p>High level user friendly control</p> 
<p><strong>Ventilation Requirements</strong>&nbsp;<br>
 Use only in a well 
ventilated room.<br>
 The room in which the heater is to be used must be 
provided with adequate ventilation at all times to ensure the proper removal of 
products of combustion and to reduce the possibility of condensation. The 
smallest sized room in which the appliance should be operated is 48m&sup3; for 
a living room and 24m&sup3; for other rooms except for basements, bathrooms and 
bedrooms where the appliance should not be used. A permanent vent with an 
effective area of 62cm2 is required together with a window that can be opened.

<em><br>
 Just to let you know our

<em>
Hi, Just to let you know that our fire is in, working and could not be better. 
Your advice and superb customer service is the best I have ever received both 
before and after the sale. To find a company who take the time and trouble to 
give such service to their customers as yours is hard to find. It has been a 
pleasure to have dealt with you. I will certainly be recommending your company 
to all my friends and relatives.</em> <br>
<strong>Mr J Sharples</strong> <br>

<br> <em></em><em>Thank you for all your support on my query. I am very 
impressed at the high level of customer service offered post sale by HotPrice. 
You dealt with my query promptly and professionally and demonstrated your 
knowledge of the products you sell and your concern that customers are happy 
with their order. Thanks again for your assistance.</em> <br>
