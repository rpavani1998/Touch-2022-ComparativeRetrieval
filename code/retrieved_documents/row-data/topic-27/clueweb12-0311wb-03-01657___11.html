Does 
anyone out there own or tired the G-MICRO PSL wax fueled stove? I'm heading up 
north for a week on the ice with a couple of buds and thinking of getting one 
to lighten my load. The web page say's Its a lantern also almost looks and 
sounds too good to be true but who knows. I hate liquid fuel its a pain so one 
time I tried a pressurized iso butane stove and it hardly worked on the ice so 
never again. I'm a low environmental impact guy so no stinky spilled fuel or 
canisters sounds good me.<br>
<br>
This is where I found it www.gattgen.com 
&nbsp;please let me know if anyone has used one. <br>

I used what they called 
a Paraffin stove in Europe but it burned liquid Kerosene. Also as a kid we 
wrapped cardboard in in a cat food can and filled it with wax but that was a 
toy. This one apparently turns wax into a gas. The clip on the web page shows 
the guy lighting a stream of gas it looks pretty neat when it lights off. I 
will probably order one and give it whirl as if I don't have enough stoves 
already. <br>

It looks kinda cheesie, more like a candle than a 
stove. As mentioned, I also made a tuna can with cardboard rolled up n waxed 
but that was a toy n never really worked very well. It was sooty n not very 
easy to light in the wind. I also doubt you'll get that thing going in the wind.
<br><br>
Perhaps ask the comany to do a demo to light it on the mountain 
instead of his kitchen? Ask him to melt about a quart of snow?.. how long does 
it take to boil a cup of water? &nbsp;<br>
<br>
You'd do better with a 
Whisperlite or any preasurised liquid fuel stove for winter use.<br>
<br>
I 
hope you'll follow up on this?<br>

I have a Dragonfly and the darn 
plastic &nbsp;pressure pump cracked on me and sprayed the fuel out. Good thing 
it was not lit or I might have a different story to tell. Your right it's 
probably not going to be the best in the wind (there is a plan for homemade 
wind breaker on the page) and won't have the BTU of the much bigger stoves. But 
it looks real small with solid wax for fuel and a lantern light too at under 4 
oz it's tempting. It seems new to me I am just hoping that someone who has one 
or tried one will post. <br>

If you are into experimenting, 
try making the tuna can wax stove? All you need to do is cut a strip of 
couragated carboard the height of the can, roll it up till it fills the can. OH 
the channels of the couragation are up n down in the can. Now drip hot wax over 
the top till it won't eat anymore. Put a whick in the center to light it.<br>

<br>We did this with the boy scouts n they thought it was great. Just be 
careful it gets very hot.<br>
<br>
Unusual the pump of the dragongly cracked. 
Sounds like maybe something got tightened too much when servicing it? My 
Whisperlite cracked but I did tighten the valve nut too much (first time 
servicing it in 15 years), slight ooze but no spray.<br>

According to the site info he's not refering wax 
as kerosine...<br>
<br>
<i>Wax is inert, nontoxic, and lightweight &nbsp;yet as 
powerful as kerosene!<br>
Powerful: &nbsp; Our 1350 F. wax gas flame is 
adjustable from 3 to 8 inches. &nbsp;The tiny G-MICRO PSL&#153;boils &nbsp;16 
oz water &lt; minute per oz.</i><br>
<br>
1350&deg; flame Boils a minute per 
oz? Says candle to me. <br>

Thanks for the input Camper and Franco. Camper I 
was always careful to not overt tighten the plastic pump but I think it was the 
cold temps that finally did it in. Before that time the O Ring in the clippy 
thing broke needless to say any stove that has plastic in it makes me nervous. 
Don't get me wrong the Dragonfly is a nice stove for camping and such but not 
so &nbsp;for hardcore light ski packing like we do. After a couple of days 
every oz feels like a pound and spilled gas smell on my gloves drives me nuts. 
By weeks end I smell like an OPEC refinery lol! If I don't get someone on that 
used the G-MICRO PSL by this Thursday I'm going to add one to my collection and 
find out. <br>

I couldn't tell you how well that particular 
stove works. &nbsp;The idea (a wax-powered stove) seems sound anyway. &nbsp;If 
you like the idea, might give it a shot. &nbsp;Obviously, try it out at home 
first.<br>
<br>
Don't be too impressed by their claims of &quot;turning the wax 
into gas&quot; stuff. &nbsp;Candles do that. &nbsp;Wax melts, then evaporates 
due to the flame heat, and it's the gas that burns. &nbsp;That's why a candle 
burns only at the wick and above (where the &quot;gas&quot; is). &nbsp;If the 
liquid or solid burned, the whole candle would light up at once. &nbsp;The<i>
&quot;our stove burns wax gas!&quot;</i> line is just a gimmick to make it 
sound fancy. &nbsp;They seem to have helped the flame a bit (kinda like an 
alchy stove helps project and intensify the flames), but burning candle wax in 
gas form is hardly new.<br>
<br>
That said, we all know wax burns, and enough 
of it burning at once burns plenty hot, so I don't see why it couldn't be a 
stove. &nbsp;Again, try it out in advance to see how long it takes, how much 
fuel it consumes for a meal, etc... and best of luck. <br>

Here's the demo of it. &nbsp;I'm kinda undecided 
if it's truly worth it (seems kinda complicated for basically being a candle 
stove), and whether it'd get hot enough to do the primary job in cold winter: 
melt copious amounts of snow into water (I'm not sure it would, but I'm in no 
place to say it definitely wouldn't).<br>
<br>
Anyhoo, for anyone interested:

I like gagets and am willing to try new gear. 
&nbsp;But at $120.00 and with minimum weight savings I'll pass on this 
&quot;new&quot; technology. <br>

I knew 
that some would be confused.<br>
The G Micro does indeed burn wax, Can be 
paraffin or bees wax,<br>
<br>
Separate issue... <br>
In England the stuff you 
(and us in Aussie) call kerosine (or kerosene) &nbsp;they call paraffin.<br>

That is why Snofox was burning kerosene in his English paraffin stove...<br>

I 
looked at the Specs page the burner and stand came out to be 3.8 oz. Since the 
wax fuel sits right inside it that means no annoying separate pump up tank. It 
say's the burner is only 1.5&quot; in dia X 2.25&quot; high at 1,100. btu and 
it also uses alcohol!! The clip shows the guy lighting a bunch of gas coming 
out of the top like the bigger gas stoves that I have. That does not look like 
a normal candle my friends maybe one on steroids. But then it's dual fuel 
alcohol or wax sweet. I will be happy if it can make my coffee, porridge and 
that pot of rice in the picture out on the ice without breaking down. I guess 
the reason no user has posted is because it's new in 2011 (look at the 
copyright) and there probably are not many out there yet <br>

I watched the lighting of the stove on their website, same as the one GBH 
posted.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem seems to be it takes over 2 minutes to 
light the stove, longer to get it fully going, and the all the adjustments 
might be hard to do with gloves on in cold weather (or your hands might freeze 
with them off).<br>
<br>
Still it is interesting , let us know how it works.

If you get it see if you can try some 
bees wax with it.<br>
Supposedly odourless and (I think) burns hotter (?)<br>
I 
have burnt bees wax candles but cannot remember anything about them,( and I 
mede them from a kit !)<br>
( yes the flame is rather large ...)<br>
The other 
point I had in mind is the stability with a 1.3 to 2L pot (for melting snow)<br>

Those were some of my concerns too. &nbsp;For 
what basically amounts to a beefed-up wax candle, it seemed to take a lot of 
finnicking and adjustments to get it going. &nbsp;If they can't do it quickly 
in a demo video, I'm a little worried how it'd perform in the field. &nbsp;One 
of the OP's concerns was that liquid fuel is a &quot;pain&quot;, but honestly 
my white-gas Whisperlite would be going full-bore by the time that thing was 
getting warmed up.<br>
<br>
As for the melting snow, I'm still unconvinced it 
gets hot enough to do that very well, but then again, I've been wrong before. 
&nbsp;An impartial outdoor review would help. <br>

Snowfox - I actually 
saw one of those G-Micro wax gas stoves a few months ago in San Diego. &nbsp;We 
are a military family, and my brother and his SEAL buddies were playing with 
one. &nbsp;It was pretty cool - surprising small and light but very solid and 
felt durable (shiny stainless steel). &nbsp;It ws not like a candle - it made a 
big plume of gas that lighted - like the video link that other dude here 
embedded. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have not seen anything like it since, and 
it sounds like the other guys here haven't either. &nbsp; I plan to buy one for 
brother's next birthday. &nbsp;the price is less than the knife I got him last 
year. &nbsp; &nbsp;Hope this helps somehow! <br>

It would be 
interesting to see an actual field test n review with a comparrison to other 
stoves in that price range.<br>
<br>
$129 is not very cheap, I see much better 
options at that price, all have better heat ratings, wind ressitance n proven 
track records. That will make a hard sell for a new company to take a foot hold 
in this market. Perhaps as a DIY introduction project, it may have a better 
chance of survival as it gets some user testimonials.<br>
<br>
Did you ask 
anyone on WhiteBlaze in the Homemade section where many stovers lurk?<br>
<br>

edit... I posted a question on Whiteblaze to see what they have to say about 
it....<br>

Looks like an interesting toy, to complex of a setup to me, I think I would 
actually end up burning myself trying to setup the toy, also would have to 
think about how long it stays burning. But hey, a toy is a toy. <br>

So I joined this blog to 
share ideas with true outdoorsmen. &nbsp;But it looks like we have a few 
populations weighing in here... a few obviously accomplished men who know what 
&quot;minimalist&quot; &quot;survival&quot; and &quot;roughing it&quot; means - 
a bit of hard work, and at times a craft - stuff that would make your 
grandfather proud. &nbsp;And we also have a few weenies blogging in now. 
&nbsp;(No insult intended - my kids joke about a Spongebob episode with 
&quot;WEENIE HUT JR.&quot; that spells out the same contrast - hilarious, but 
true stuff). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Anyway, weenies cling to convenience and camp 20 
feet from a hiking trail with a huge Coleman lantern and a big carbon-spitting 
isobutane or white gas stove. &nbsp;Why would a weenie need a survival stove? 
&nbsp;Especially one that looks like it might get his fingers warm or dirty or 
take more than 5 seconds to light? &nbsp;<br>
<br>
CITYMAN calls that wax gas 
stove a &quot;TOY&quot;. &nbsp;Plenty of gas lines and electricity in the city, 
so maybe survival stoves are just TOYS to you... until the power goes out. 
&nbsp;And the stores with isobutane cylnders are closed. &nbsp; When that 
happens (or if 10 miles off a trail in a non-weenie environment) I'd rather 
have something like that wax stove. &nbsp;Anyway, that Navy SEAL liked it - and 
they certainly aren't weenies... &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Snowfox - I'll check in with 
my brother to see if his SEAL buddies have any more helpful advice. &nbsp;<br>

*snort* &nbsp;Guys like this crack me 
up. &nbsp;  Guess I'm just a weenie.  &nbsp;Mr. Surviving2011 obviously has 
pegged what this thread is about.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a note surviving2011, you 
having a brother who has friends who happen to be SEALs doesn't actually make 
you tough, nor does it provide any credentials for being a &quot;true&quot; 
outdoorsman. &nbsp;It just makes you another... how'd you say it?... a 
&quot;weenie blogger,&quot; as it were. <br>

I saw some seals 
on the rocks in the Long Island Sound last week while kayaking. They didn't 
look very tough, none of em had any stoves, all were wearing fur coats and 
infact they stunk n have rotten fish bereath.<br>
<br>
Do you think this wax 
stove is survial2011's company? Makes you wonder if Snowfox is the same guy 
with only 6 posts... AND all are in this one thread? ummmmm.....<br>
<br>
I 
smell fish breath!<br>

Wow a stove fight .... Lol! I only 
logged on to get some advice. I have been busy working off site sorry for not 
keeping in touch. Last night I sent the contact form to the wax stove people 
with some questions. I will post the reply here if and when I get one. I'm 
still intrigued with the notion of no liquid fuel. Maybe I'm the only untamed 
idiot willing to explore new frontiers, cut the first trail ... dive in head 
first and hit a rock Ouch! &nbsp;Stay tuned<br>
<br>
P.S. Im trying to get a 
picture up like you all have but it's not working *&amp;%$ &nbsp;Will try again 
when I have more time later. <br>

I just read camper10469 
and surviving2011 last post. If you people are going to be nasty to me or any 
of the nice people on this tread please find another thread. This is only about 
the 3rd maybe 4th time I logged on to a blog in my life and it's amazing to see 
how people wholesale trash each other. It's no wonder why I love being in 
solitude. For crying out loud say something nice or move on sheeesh! <br>

woooooowwwwwww... slow down kid, chill. <br>
<br>

We weren't saying nasty things, only retaliating to what seems like a spam 
attack. Good cop bad cop routine going on here between you n survivalman?... 
see the realationship? &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Hey BP2GO are these 2 guys the same IP? 
<br><br>
GBH n everyone posting here have been members of this site for many 
years with too many years experiance. I'd say you're getting the elite of the 
elite commenting on this stove... including the accomplished AT through hikers 
over on Whiteblaze pretty much saying the same things we are. Seals don't use 
candle wax stoves, they use C4!<br>
<br>
Read the posts again? <br>
Do you 
speak english or are you from another country?<br>
<br>
BTW, did you get the 
stove manufacturer's mailing address, phone number, e-mail address? Is this a 
lagit seller or a thief? &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Yes the stove has some interesting 
concepts but......<br>
<br>
Just an observation.. both Snowfox n Survival2011 
call this a blog... maybe one in the same person?<br>
<br>

Snowfox, if you're wanting to hang around on 
internet forums, I'd personally suggest not taking much of anything personally. 
 &nbsp;It's just the way things are on the 'net. &nbsp;Don't sweat it. 
&nbsp;THAT said, it really is a valuable place to get feedback, especially 
about gear.<br>
<br>
As you can tell so far, not many folks have used this 
stove in particular, myself included, so all the opinions are hypothetical. 
&nbsp;If you're convinced it'd work for you, try it out... if you use it and 
write an impartial field review, it'd obviously be valuable! &nbsp;I'd read it.
<br><br>
Until then, consider each of the concerns people have about the stove 
and ask yourself how valid they may (or may not) be. &nbsp;For instance, the 
concerns on Whiteblaze about it not burning cleanly (and leaving a bit of soot 
on the pot) would not bother me one bit. &nbsp;I use a wood stove on long 
trips--multiple weeks at a time in SE Alaska--and the soot is of little concern 
to me. &nbsp;In my opinion how well this wax stove will work in the dead of 
winter depends what you want to use it for. &nbsp;If you'll always have access 
to liquid water and plan to just cook a small meal a couple times a day, 
honestly it'd probably do ya' just fine. &nbsp;However, if you need to melt 
snow for all your water (1-2 gallons a day), you really need something that can 
put out a ton of BTU's, and I'm not sure that stove would do the job. &nbsp;The 
little yellow flame just doesn't seem that strong. &nbsp;You wouldn't want to 
spend multiple hours each morning waiting for that thing to warm up a gallon 
pot of snow, especially if you need to get moving. &nbsp;In my experience it 
takes a long time to melt that much snow even with the maximum blast of a 
white-gas stove on a roaring full blue flame.<br>
<br>
Again, it depends on 
your needs, so consider peoples' input with that in mind. &nbsp;Best of luck,
<br><br>
- Mike <br>

GoBlueHiker thank you for bringing some sanity to 
this world the Camper person is stressing me out already!! Find another thread 
to post will ya please some of us just want chat. Anyway I did get a reply from 
the wax stove company inventor, which is cool and here it is below.<br>
<br>

Dear Brad,<br>
<br>
Thank you for the inquiry,<br>
<br>
 I will reply to your 
questions personally.<br>
<br>
1) There was a time when we at GATT-GEN, LLC 
were offended when the word candle was used to describe the G-MICRO PSL. But 
over time we became aware that in most peoples mind Wax = Candle period. And 
that was true for many years until now when our US and Intl Patent Pending Wax 
Gas Generating System (WGGS) became a reality. Then comes the hard work of 
teaching people that Wax can be much more then a Candle and is a very potent 
high density, safe alternative fuel source. To answer your question the G-MICRO 
PSL is not a Candle and is different in many ways the most obvious is it that 
it does not have a consumable wick like a wax candle and it has a metallic 
burner element (watch our video) that burns paraffin wax gas. Yes the WGGS 
produces volumes of highly volatile combustible gas from solid wax. As a matter 
of fact, because of the G-MICRO PSL's small size, one of our greatest 
engineering challenges was to throttle back gas production enough to produce a 
clean soot free flame.<br>
<br>
2) &nbsp;If the flame is set too high yes you 
will get some soot on the pot but this is normal for any high molecular weight 
fuel. However, &nbsp;if the flame height is adjusted correctly the mostly white 
/ blue flame will not deposit soot. When fitted with a glass lantern globe and 
the flame is not covered with a pot there is absolutely zero soot.<br>
<br>
3) 
&nbsp;My favorite question reliable cold weather operation ..... awesome! Blows 
every other stove away especially if it's used with the DYI wind breaker on our 
Tips n Tricks page. There is no equal you will love it hands down!<br>
<br>

Like any stove device a wind screen is a good tool to have outside if there is 
wind. Especially on a non pressurized stove. But, having said that once warmed 
up to full operating temperature the G-MICRO will take a surprisingly stiff 
cross wind especially if a pot is on top. If its windy I have lit the capillary 
wick under my parka before exposing to wind. This is only possible because, 
unlike any other small stove, the wax fuel is hardened and will not spill or 
flair up. Great feature to have and only available on the PSL.<br>
<br>

Inventors note; The G-MICRO PSL is not intended to replace the present crop of 
turbocharged pressurized gas stoves when used under normal circumstances. They 
are excellent stoves having a much higher BTU mostly due to their much larger 
physical size. However, for the uncompromising minimalist who wants to toss a 
G-MICRO and fuel in his / her pocket and is content with waiting a few more 
minutes for 2 cups of water to boil then later use it for illumination / 
lantern there is no equal. For an Explorer like Todd Carmichael 
&nbsp;www.subzerosolo.com &nbsp;(check out his photo page) who carries two 
G-MICRO PSL's in his kit it's an enabler. Or just someone who wants the 
security of having a fire making device that can be fueled with candle wax 
chips in calamity, disaster or vehicle break down it's a life saver.<br>
<br>

With Kind Regards<br>
<br>

<br>
Hi Wax Stove Store,
<br><br>
Before I buy one I have a couple of questions on the G-MICRO PSL stove 
you are selling.<br>
<br>
How is it any different then a candle?<br>
<br>
Does 
it leave soot on the pot?<br>
<br>
Will it work in sub zero temperatures like 
out on a frozen lake.<br>
<br>
Thanks Brad <br>
