 I'm Julie, and I live with my 
husband and three young daughters in New South Wales suburbia, Australia. This 
is the online journal I kept until recently, of how we are trying to live more 
simply &amp; sustainably in suburbia.<br>
<br>
This blog is on indefinite 
hiatus but please feel free to look around my archives for some inspiration in 
your own journey to living more lightly and sustainably.<br>

<h3> Planned obsolescence... </h3>  ...makes me want to shout rude words. <br>

<br>This week the switch on the electric kettle broke and the four-year-old 
microwave stopped working. We duly ring the closest electrical repair centre (a 
half-hour drive away), to be told &quot;Nah mate, we don't touch kettles, you 
need an electrician&quot;, and &quot;Sounds like your magnetron has gone. Cost 
ya more to fix it than to buy a new one.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think we've all been 
there before.<br>
<br>
Doesn't get any less frustrating each time it happens. 
<br> <br>
Having said that, we only use the microwave for re-heating leftovers, 
melting butter for baking and heating milk for our daily coffee, plus it takes 
up a lot of bench space... and I think I have convinced hubby that we really 
don't need a new one. As for the kettle, I've been looking for an affordable 
vintage stove-top kettle for ages, so it sounds like it's time to get more 
intense about that search! It's a pity that they tend to be collectible and 
therefore expensive though.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, does anyone remember 
Birko food warmers? I was given an old one when I was a Uni student (possibly 
it was my grandmother's), and I still have it. Eminently useful little gadget 
and still going strong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are trying to find where to 
get rid of your broken microwave too, Novacastrians can checkhere for local 
recycling information, and Aussies can checkhere for more information. <br>
<br>
<br>Cheers, <br>
<br>

<p> Good morning Julie, Good idea to go without a microwave oven. I gave mine 
away years ago and have never regretted it. Surely radiated food can not be 
good for one's health (to my way of thinking)<br>
I saw some very heavy stove 
top kettles online at Kitchenware direct.When my kettle &quot;gives up the 
ghost&quot; I shall buy one from them. The type I like look extremely sturdy, 
brand name Staub. With a name like that how could it not be sturdy LOL.<br>

Hope this is for you.</p> </dd>

<p> Good Luck,<br>
<br>
Hope your research goes well. Planned obsolescence has 
to be the most destructive part of the current company/product/profits system.
<br><br>
I buy a product to do a job.. and when I spend good money I expect it 
to stay bought, sadly my experience is similar to yours.<br>
<br>
Kind Regards

<p> Hi Julie, you will be fine without a microwave, we have never owned one 
though my Mum lent us hers when our stove was out of action and to be honest I 
could figure how to make it part of my meal preparation routine. The kids just 
used it for pop corn.<br>
<br>
I had a Birko when I first left home, loved it. 
Though it was destroyed eventually by being left on and allowed to boil dry - 
for a very long time.</p> </dd>

<p> What is the food warmer and how does it work? I've never heard of one so 
it's not making any sense at the moment - is it like a double boiler?</p> </dd>

<p> Surely a pot of water on the stove can work as a kettle? Unless your stove 
top range costs more than a plug in kettle. We use a stove top kettle but after 
reading your post I think even that we could just use a pot. I have convinced 
my hubby that the microwave should go, and the clothes dryer is not coming with 
us when we move. :)<br>
<br>
I loath the standard mechanism of planned 
obsolescense that keeps industry moving. I am glad I am not alone.</p> </dd>

<p> Hi Julie. I've been following your blog for a short time now and enjoy it 
very much! Especially the pictures from your garden :)<br>
We are living abroad 
for a temporary period of time so we didn't want to put a lot of money into 
appliances we wouldn't be taking back with us. The microwave has only been 
missed when I want to make a &quot;baked&quot; potato at the last minute! But 
I've found that if I boil the potato for 8-10 minutes and then pop it in the 
oven for a bit it turns out really nice! Oh, and for some reason I keep buying 
microwave popcorn, even though we really like it made on the stove top. Go 
figure.<br>
<br>
Keep up the wonderful posts! </p> </dd>

<p> Gah! Planned obsolence drives me insane! When my husband and I got married 
he had a 20 year old microwave and tv - hand me downs from his parents. We gave 
them away when we went overseas for two years.<br>
<br>
When we came back to 
Australaia we bought a microwave, because my husband thought there was no way 
we could get by without one. Despite the fact that I do all the cooking, and 
managed to live just fine without a microwave (or an electric kettle) when I 
first left home (after uni).<br>
<br>
From about three seconds after we came 
home with it I realised we had indeed made a mistake because we have NOWHERE TO 
PUT IT. It takes up so much bench space for... me to reheat food once or twice 
a week (could do that on the stove), and cook vegetables once or twice a week, 
or less because I like them better steamed.<br>
<br>
I'd be very surprised if 
it lasts for 20 years though. Not much lasts 20 years anymore. Such a waste.</p>

<p> Our electric kettle started to fail about a year ago, leaking around the 
base. We nursed it along for quite a while by keeping it on a big plastic lid 
to catch the run off. My engineer husband then took it apart and tried to fix 
it, including speaking with a stunned service rep at the manufacturer, and 
tracking down a particular o-ring, all to no avail. We got a stove top kettle. 
I'd been keeping my eye out for a good one over the year, but never found one. 
I don't think they're used too much anymore. We caved and bought a brand new 
Oxo. It's working for us, and it should hold up for 10 years at least. The weak 
spot is going to be the fancy handle, I can tell. But that looks like something 
DH will be able to fix when it gives out. Then it'll be good for another 10 
years.</p> </dd>

<p> Hi Julie<br>
I love your articles.<br>
I had a birko when I was living in 
a hostel in Canberra. I boiled eggs, boiled veggies and reheated other foods in 
it to save having to eat in the costly dining room!<br>
Microwave ovens, I 
agree with Olive so do not own one.<br>
Have a great day. </p> </dd>

<p> We have been without a microwave since we moved to a new house 6 months 
ago. I was useful for reheating leftovers, but now I use the oven efficiently: 
putting a few things in at a time or just heat stuff quickly in a pan. Or eat 
it cold of course. I'm not missing it at all.</p> </dd>

<p> Hi Olive,<br>
Yes, I had decided some time ago I didn't want to replace 
this one when it blew up, I'm a not thrilled about irradiating food either, 
particularly if you've gone to the trouble of growing it! Wow, that Staub 
kettle is awesome, I didn't know you could still buy cast iron ones! Thanks for 
the link :-)<br>
<br>
Hi Belinda,<br>
Yes exactly, neither product was cheap 
and nasty when we bought them, and yet they've lasted not much longer - grrrr.
<br><br>
Hi Jenny,<br>
Thanks, I'm sure I'll only miss it about once a month 
when I'm in a rush lol.<br>
<br>
Hi Cheli,<br>
It's like a kettle but with an 
enclosed element at the bottom - sort of like an electric saucepan? - so you 
can heat foods up in it, boil water etc.<br>
<br>
Hi Tracy,<br>
Yes, if I 
didn't have the Birko we'd be using a saucepan! I'd like a whistling kettle 
though, otherwise I'd boil the saucepan dry lol.<br>
<br>
Hi Megs,<br>
Yup!<br>

<br>Hi la Tempete,<br>
I would give away of Freecycle if it was working, but 
nobody wants a broken one, even for parts. I tried to give away our last one 
four years ago but no one touched it for the same reason.<br>
<br>
Hi Lorna,<br>
Thank you :-) It's amazing how many &quot;essential&quot; appliances we can 
live without when we want to, isn't it?<br>
<br>
Hi Queen Stuss,<br>
Argh, yes. 
I had an old microwave when we first got married too, it sounded like a nuclear 
power plant starting up when we operated it lol, but it was still going strong 
when we replaced it with a smaller one - which blew up about 12 months later... 
I'm very much looking forward to reclaiming some bench space too!<br>
<br>
Hi 
Kate,<br>
Mmmm, I spent a few minutes looking at some *very* schmick new 
kettles on the 'net last night! Some lovely solid-looking ones, with lifetime 
guarantees too, so that will be our fall-back.<br>
<br>
Hi Maggie,<br>
Thanks 
:-) Isn't the Birko cool? I don't think I'm going to miss the microwave either.
<br><br>
Hi Andrea,<br>
Yes, I'm looking forward to not having to stop the kids 
peering inside while it's operating!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

<dd> 
<p> yep! been there, hate to see that fixing costs more than buying a new 
one...most things break down after the garantee expires...just within days 
after! sigh!</p> </dd>

<p> i may be wrong but i thought heating water on the stove top is a more 
inefficient use of electricity (on an electric cooker obviously!) than an 
electric kettle. just something to consider</p> </dd>

<p> Hi Shandora,<br>
Oh yes, how many things break just days after the 
warranty expires!<br>
<br>
Hi Paula,<br>
Yes, it is normally more efficient to 
use an electric kettle, but we have a gas stovetop which works out about the 
same because it's more efficient (it doesn't have to heat up the element 
first)...<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

Kate said... </dt> 
<dd> 
<p> Re: the relative efficiencies of electric vs. stove top kettles...If the 
stove top kettle lasts for 40 years and is still functional, you ought to 
compare that to the monetary and environmental costs of making and buying 5-8 
electric kettles in that time period. In my experience, electric kettles come 
with guaranteed obsolescence. So even if there's a slightly higher energy cost 
to boiling on the stove top, you may still come out ahead or at least break 
even.<br>
<br>
The doomers among us could argue that the electric kettle will 
be useless after the crash, while the stove top kettle will eventually be used 
on a wood stove.<br>
<br>
And yes, I've heard that boiling with a gas cooktop 
(which is what we have) is more efficient than boiling with an electric kettle 
anyway. There's no line loss of electricity between your home and the point of 
generation when using gas, though gas certainly has its issues as well.</p>

<p> Hi Kate :-)<br>
<br>
Yes, part of the reason I want to get a stovetop 
kettle is so that I can have something to use on our outdoor oven (if we ever 
get around to building it!) or at the very least a rocket stove such as yours, 
in case of power outages. I also like your reasoning re: the longevity. I've 
looked at a couple of good quality ones now and they both have lifetime 
warranties on them - nothing to break!<br>
<br>
