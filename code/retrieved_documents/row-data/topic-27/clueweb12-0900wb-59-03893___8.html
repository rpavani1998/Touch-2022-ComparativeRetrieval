<p> I would like to add somthing to the below Repair Tip:<br>
<br>
 Reset your 
GFCI electrical outlets<br>
 Some outlets are protected by upstream GFCIs or 
GFCI circuit breakers. Look in the circuit box for a GFCI circuit breaker and 
in bathrooms, kitchens and laundry rooms for GFCI outlets. Test and reset them. 
This may solve your problem.<br>
<br>
 I am a handyman and here in Florida 
there also may be a GFCI which BTW stands for Ground Fault Circuit Interupter 
in the of all places the GARAGE. Yes and they are usually tied to the same 
circuit as the bathrooms in the home. You do not know how many calls I have had 
to come out and push a button. $50.00 dollars please.</p>

<p>There are some household repairs that are so simple that even the pros feel 
bad about charging for them (really!). Many of these plumbing, heating, 
electrical, air conditioning, and appliance repairs are simple things that 
homeowners overlook. Other solutions in this collection are less obvious, but 
all of these repairs can save you a big chunk of change the next time something 
goes wrong.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Low water pressure at the faucet?</li> 
<li>Your toilet's not a garbage can</li> 
<li>Got a leak?</li> 
<li>No hot water? </li> 
<li>Refrigerator not cooling?</li> 
<li>No flame at the gas burners?</li> 
<li>Electric stove burner not heating?</li> 
<li>An electrical outlet doesn't work</li> 
<li>Not getting enough heat?</li> 
<ul></ul> </ul> <br>

<h2>Low water pressure at the faucet?</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Clean or replace the aerator</h4> 
<p>Over time, aerators get clogged with minerals or other bits of stuff that 
break loose from the inside of the pipes. Remove the aerator by turning it 
clockwise when you're looking down on it. You may have to grip it with pliers 
to unscrew it. Once it's off, you can take the parts out of the aerator and 
clean them, but it's usually better to simply replace it. Take it along to the 
hardware store to find an exact thread match.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>Your toilet's not a garbage can</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Put trash in the wastebasket instead</h4> 
<p>Our pro plumber got a call to unplug a toilet he had recently installed. He 
was surprised because he had put in a toilet that he knew was almost impossible 
to clog. After repeated attempts with a plunger and a toilet auger, he gave up 
and removed the toilet to look in from the bottom. The outlet was completely 
clogged with a tangled web of plastic dental floss holders, which had to be 
removed one at a time with needle-nose pliers. Save yourself a service call. 
Use the wastebasket for garbage.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>Got a leak?</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Try tightening the valve stem packing nut</h4> 
<p>The next time you see a suspicious puddle of water, look for a leaky valve 
before you call the plumber. Look at the valve to see if water is leaking out 
around the valve stem. If it is, try turning the packing nut about an eighth 
turn with a wrench. If tightening the nut doesn't stop the leak, you'll have to 
shut off the main water valve, remove the handle and nut, and add to or replace 
the packing material&mdash;still a pretty easy fix.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>No hot water? </h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Check the water heater pilot light</h4> 
<p>Before you call the plumber, remove the metal cover located at the bottom 
of the water heater or simply look through the glass door to see if the pilot 
is lit. If you don't see a small pilot light flame, follow the instructions for 
relighting the pilot on the label pasted to the tank. Some high-efficiency 
water heaters don't have a pilot light that stays lit all the time. If you have 
one of these, check your owner's manual before you reach for the phone.</p> <br>
<br> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Refrigerator not cooling?</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Check the temperature dial and cooling coils</h4> 
<p>It could be as simple as turning the dial to a cooler setting. Check the 
controls. Our pro plumber says it's not uncommon to find that the refrigerator 
controls are set wrong. Someone may have bumped the dial while putting away the 
milk or an inquisitive toddler may have twisted the knob. Cooling coils 
completely caked with pet hair and dust are also incredibly common. Remove the 
front grille and vacuum the coils.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>No flame at the gas burners?</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Check stove power source</h4> 
<p>If you don't hear gas coming out when the burner is turned on, gas isn't 
getting to the stove. Check to make sure the gas is turned on. If you hear gas 
coming out but the burner won't light, make sure the stove is plugged in. Even 
gas stoves need power. If the stove is getting gas and has power, clean the 
igniter near the burner or clean out the pilot light hole.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>Electric stove burner not heating?</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>A recent cleaning might be the reason</h4> 
<p>The first thing our pro plumber asks is, &ldquo;Did you clean the stove 
recently?&rdquo; Usually the answer is yes, and the fix is easy. When you slid 
the burner back into the top, the terminal didn't engage with the receptacle 
under the stove top or the plastic terminal block got knocked out of its 
holder. Lift the stove-top to see what the problem is. The fix usually involves 
reinstalling the terminal block. Also try spreading the terminals slightly to 
create a tighter connection.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>An electrical outlet doesn't work</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Reset your GFCI electrical outlets</h4> 
<p>Some outlets are protected by upstream GFCIs or GFCI circuit breakers. Look 
in the circuit box for a GFCI circuit breaker and in bathrooms, kitchens and 
laundry rooms for GFCI outlets. Test and reset them. This may solve your 
problem.</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2>Not getting enough heat?</h2> <br>
 1 of 1 
<h4>Check the furnace filter and air vents</h4> 
<p>One of the most common causes of insufficient heat or cooled air is a 
plugged furnace filter. Change inexpensive woven fiberglass filters once a 
month or buy a better-quality pleated filter and change it every three months 
to avoid heating and cooling problems. Another common cause of cold rooms 
during heating season is a blocked cold air return. Be sure your couch or an 
area rug isn't covering a cold air return vent because this can slow the entry 
of heated air into the room.</p> <br>
