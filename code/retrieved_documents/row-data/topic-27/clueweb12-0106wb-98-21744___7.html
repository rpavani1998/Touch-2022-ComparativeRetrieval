STOVES, RANGES AND OVENS 
<p> If you are considering buying a new range and oven, you can expect to live 
with your purchase for the next 20 years. The choice you make in the store can 
save you a little or a lot of money over the next two decades.</p> 
<p> </p> First, look beyond the initial price tag. All appliances have two 
costs - the purchase price, and the operating cost, or the money that you pay 
out month after month, year after year, in the form of your utility bills. That 
on-going expense is important to consider, for it may be as much or more than 
the purchase price.
<p></p> 
<p> Today, about 58 percent of American households cook with electricity, but 
gas cooking is making a steady comeback, for good reason. A gas stove costs 
less than half as much to operate as an electric one, provided it is equipped 
with electronic ignition instead of a pilot light. The electronic pilotless 
ignitions reduce gas usage by about 30 percent over a constantly burning pilot 
light. These are also more convenient, eliminating the need to restart a 
standing pilot light.</p> 
<p> Consider the new Convection ovens. These are new designs that continually 
circulate heated air around the food being cooked. (Think of an oven with a 
built-in fan.) Convection ovens distribute heat more evenly than ordinary 
ovens, so cooking time and cooking temperatures can be reduced, cutting energy 
use by about a third, on average.</p>

<p> Cost of Cooking </p> </b> 
<p> This table from the Consumer Guide to Home Energy Savings compares the 
cost of cooking a casserole in several ways. It assumes the cost of gas is $.60 
a therm, and electricity is $.08 a kWh.</p> <b>Appliance</b> <b>Temperature</b> 
<b>Time</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Cost</b> <br>
Electric Oven 350 1 hour 2.0 kWh $.16

<p>Buying Smart</p> </b> 
<ul> 
<li>Newer ovens have additional insulation and tighter-fitting oven door 
gaskets and hinges to save energy. These include self-cleaning models which use 
less energy for normal cooking because of higher insulation levels. (However, 
if you use the self-cleaning option more than once a month, you will end up 
using more energy than you will save from the extra insulation.)</li> <br>
<br>

<li>With electric cook tops, there are a number of new types of burners on the 
market: solid disk elements, radiant elements under glass, halogen elements, 
and induction elements.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Solid disk elements and radiant elements under glass are easier to clean, 
but they take longer to heat up and use more electricity.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Halogen elements and induction elements are more efficient than 
conventional electric coil elements. But remember that induction elements 
require that you use only iron or steel pots and pans. Aluminum cookware will 
not work with induction elements.</li> <br>

<p> It's Your Money </p> </b> 
<p> First things first. Install your range away from your refrigerator. The 
range's heat make the refrigerator work harder. If you have to put them next to 
each other, place a sheet of foam insulation between them.</p> 
<p><b>How To Use Your Oven Efficiently:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Preheat it only when necessary, and then keep the preheating time to a 
minimum. Unless you're baking breads or pastries, you may not need to preheat 
your oven at all.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Do not open the oven door often to check your food. Each time you open the 
door the oven temperature drops by 25 degrees. Watch the clock or use a timer 
instead.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>It seems obvious, but don't cook with the oven door open. This common 
practice does nothing but waste energy and cost you money.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Bake several items at the same time.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Don't cover your oven racks with foil - it blocks the flow of hot air. 
Food cooks more quickly and efficiently when the heated air can circulate 
freely. That's why it's also a good idea to stagger pans on upper and lower 
racks to improve airflow.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Use glass or ceramic pans in your oven. You can turn down the temperature 
about 25 degrees and foods will cook just as quickly.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Clean a self-cleaning oven right after you've used it, to take advantage 
of residual heat.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Occasionally check the seal on your oven door for cracks or tears. Even a 
small tear or gap can allow heat to escape. In addition, a clean seal will 
provide better heat retention.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Full-size ovens are not very efficient for cooking small- to medium-sized 
meals. It generally pays to use toaster ovens or microwave ovens.</li> <br>
<br>
</ul> 
<p> <b>How To Get The Most Out Of Your Electric Range:</b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Turn off your electric burners several minutes before the allotted cooking 
time is up. The heating element will stay hot long enough to finish the cooking 
without using more electricity. (The same principle works with oven cooking, 
too.)</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Make sure your stovetop electric coils work properly. A worn-out element 
is a real power drain.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Keep stovetop burners and reflectors clean - they will reflect the heat 
better and save energy. If you need new ones, buy quality. The best on the 
market can save as much as 1/3 of the energy used when cooking on top of the 
stove!</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Match the size of the pan to the heating element; more heat will get to 
the pan and less will be lost to the surrounding air. A 6-inch pan on an 8-inch 
burner will waste over 40 percent of the energy.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>On electric stovetops, use only flat-bottomed pans that make full contact 
with the element. A warped or rounded pan will waste most of the heat.</li> <br>
<br> 
<p>Do you have a gas range? Consider these tips: </p> 
<li>When cooking on a gas burner, use a moderate flame setting to conserve gas.
</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Remember that a blue flame means your gas stove is operating efficiently. 
A yellowish flame indicates an adjustment is needed.</li> <br>
<br>

<li>Whenever possible, use a pressure cooker. By cooking food at a higher 
temperature and pressure, cooking time is reduced dramatically and energy use 
is cut by 50 to 75 percent.</li> <br>
<br>
</ul> 
<p>And here's a final safety note - your range hood should ventilate to the 
outside of the house and not simply recirculate and filter the cooking fumes. 
This is especially important with gas ranges.</p> 
<p>Be careful about the sizes of fans as well - too large a fan can waste 
energy and cause combustion gases to back-draft into the house. This can be a 
major problem with large downdraft ventilation fans used with some cook-tops 
and ranges. Ask about make-up air ducts available for these models.</p>

<p> <b>Cooking Tips</b> </p> 
<p> With conventional ovens, minimize the preheating time. Unless you're 
baking breads or pastries, you may not even need to preheat.</p> 
<p> Don't open the oven door too often when checking your food, especially if 
it's your prize recipe for a baking contest. Each time you open the door the 
oven temperature drops by 25. Watch the clock or use a timer instead.</p> 
<p> Turn off electric burners several minutes before the allotted cooking 
time. The heating element will stay hot long enough to finish cooking those 
eggs or favorite side dish without using more electricity. The same principle 
works with your oven cooking.</p> 
<p> Check the seal on your oven door for wear. Even a small tear or gap can 
allow heat to wander away from your meal. A clean seal also provides better 
heat retention.</p> 
<p> Cook with the oven door closed. A partially open door wastes energy, costs 
you money, and warms you instead of the food.</p> 
<p> Make sure stovetop electric coils work properly. A worn-out element is a 
real power drain.</p> 
<p> If you don't have one, consider buying a self-cleaning oven. They use less 
energy for normal cooking because of higher insulation levels. They also save 
on your rubber glove and cleanser purchases! However, if you use the 
self-cleaning feature more than once a month, you'll end up using more energy 
than you saved. When you clean the oven, do it right after cooking to take 
advantage of residual heat.</p> 
<p> Stagger pans and baking sheets on upper and lower racks to improve 
airflow, and don't cover racks with foil. Food cooks more quickly and 
efficiently when heat circulates freely.</p> 
<p> Use glass or ceramic pans in ovens. You can turn down the temperature 
about 25&deg; and foods will cook just as quickly.</p> 
<p> Even though they are like magnets for spills, keep stovetop reflectors 
clean. They will reflect heat better and save energy. If you need new ones, buy 
quality. The best on the market can save as much as 1/3 of the energy used with 
inferior reflectors.</p> 
<p> Match the size of the pan to the heating element; more heat will get to 
the pan and less will be lost to the surrounding air or found by the pan 
handle! A 6-inch pan on an 8-inch burner will waste over 40 percent of the 
energy.</p> 
<p> On electric stovetops, use flat-bottomed pans that make full contact with 
the element. A warped or rounded pan may be a conversation piece, but will 
waste most of the heat.</p> 
<p> When cooking on a gas burner, use moderate flame settings to conserve 
natural gas.</p> 
<p> Remember that a blue flame means your gas stove is operating efficiently. 
A yellowish flame is sick and needs an adjustment.</p> 
<p> Solid disk elements and radiant elements under glass stove tops are easier 
to clean than conventional electric coil elements, but they take longer to heat 
up and use more electricity.</p> 
<p> Halogen elements and induction elements are more efficient than 
conventional electric coil elements, but you must use the proper cookware. 
Induction elements require that you use only iron or steel pots and 
pans-aluminum cookware will not work.</p> 
<p> Use toaster ovens or microwave ovens to cook small- to medium-sized meals.
