<p>Oil is an expensive way to heat your house, and those who heat with oil 
should consider some other options for replacing this system. If you heat with 
oil, you are probably spending between $1000 and $2000 annually on oil to heat 
your home, and possibly more based on fluctuating crude prices.<br>
To upgrade 
this system, three options generally include: a) keep maintaining the old 
furnace and replace it with a new oil furnace when it breaks; b) installing gas 
or c) install an inverter driven heat pump.</p> 
<p>Option B could mean installing a high efficiency gas furnace that costs 
about $5k or a standard gas furnace that is 15% less efficient and costs about 
$3k.</p> 
<p>Option C could mean installing a forced air or ductless heat pump. A forced 
air unit will be more expensive option ($8k) compared to $4k for the ductless 
unit. The forced air, however, will heat a larger area of the house than a 
ductless model. The ductless units are good for heating large open spaces like 
your living room/kitchen/entry area. Additional indoor units add $1.5k each to 
the initial $4k.</p> 
<p>At current energy prices, a high efficiency gas furnace would cost half as 
much as an oil furnace and an inverter driven heat pump would cost about a 
third as much as an oil furnace.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here are some other things to consider if you are on the fence about 
switching from oil:</p> 
<p><strong>Upfront v. Operating Costs.</strong> While the upfront costs of 
some of these options are significantly higher than others, the added 
efficiency of these more expensive heaters will pay for themselves over time.
</p> 
<p><strong>Environment.</strong> The gas and oil furnace is a fossil fuel and 
the heat pump could run on renewable energy sources.</p> 
<p><strong>Price Security.</strong> Natural gas and oil furnaces would lock 
you into one fuel type; a heat pump could be powered by many different fuel 
types depending on what the utility chooses to generate.</p> 
<p><strong>Base Service Charges.</strong> Seattle City Light&rsquo;s monthly 
base service charge is $3.30 and Puget Sound Energy&rsquo;s is $10. Going with 
gas would cost you an additional $120/yr.</p> 
<p><strong>Contract.</strong> PSE&rsquo;s deal to help cover the cost of 
bringing gas to your house may require you to change over your water heater and 
stove to gas. You may not be planning on replacing these other two appliances 
and doing so may cost a lot of money. Cooking does not account for a large 
amount of energy use, and an electric stove is about twice as efficient as a 
gas stove. If you want a gas stove for the better cooking experience, consider 
an induction stove top which is the not only the most efficient but also the 
top performing cooking appliance (yep, even better than gas). An induction 
stove top is, however, very expensive ~$2k. Cooking with gas releases more 
pollutants in the house and it would be best to have a better functioning 
kitchen exhaust fan in that scenario. A gas water heater is also less efficient 
than a heat pump water heater but may be less costly to operate than an 
existing electric water heater.</p> 
<p><strong>Safety &amp; Liability.</strong> Bringing gas into the home or 
keeping oil presents risks for carbon monoxide poisoning and gas/oil leaks.</p> 
<p><strong>Air Conditioning.</strong> The heat pump can operate in reverse and 
provide cooling in the summer time.</p> 
<p><strong>Maintenance.</strong> Both the gas/oil furnace and heat pump will 
require a similar level of regular maintenance. A ductless heat pump requires 
the least amount of maintenance.</p> 
<p><strong>Noise.</strong> The heat pump&rsquo;s outdoor unit, while quieter 
than traditional air conditioners, will be noisier than a gas furnace.</p> 
<p><strong>Comfort.</strong> Inverter driven heat pumps can modulate their 
fans and heaters to perfectly match the heating demands of the house. This is 
in contrast to your oil furnace that is either on or off, which results in wide 
temperature swings in the house. High efficiency gas furnaces can modulate too 
but they are more expensive than standard models.</p> 
<p><strong>Ducts.</strong> Gas and oil require you to keep your ductwork. A 
ductless heat pump would allow you to remove all the ductwork in the basement 
and reclaim some headroom and space including the closet the furnace is 
currently in.</p> 
<p><strong>Local Heating.</strong> One benefit to the ductless system is that 
you can locally heat one part of the house instead of heating the entire house 
with a forced air system. Locally heating is more efficient than heating the 
entire house.</p> 
<p><strong>Resale Value.</strong> Many homeowners do not want to buy homes 
that have oil heat.</p> 
<p><strong>Rebates.</strong> Gas and electric utilities, such as Puget Sound 
Energy and Seattle City Light, often offer rebates for insulation to help keep 
the heat inside your home. If you convert to electricity or gas, you may become 
eligible for additional incentives to weatherize your home.</p> 
<p><strong>Insulate &amp; Air Seal.</strong> Oftentimes it makes more 
financial sense to improve the insulation and air seal your home so that your 
costly oil furnace runs less often. A house that needs less heat also requires 
a smaller furnace so you can save money by buying a smaller heater if you have 
already done work to keep heat inside the house.</p> 
<p>A switch from oil provides tremendous positive opportunities for 
homeowners. Saving money is just one of them.</p>
