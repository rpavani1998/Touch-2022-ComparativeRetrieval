<h3>A Thanksgiving Story</h3> By Annette Jones &middot; Comments (0) <br>

<p></p> 
<p>A few years ago I asked my 96 year old grandmother what she thought the 
greatest technological advancement was in her lifetime and without any 
hesitation, she replied hot and cold indoor running water.</p> 
<p>I was rather surprised by this reply; after all, she was born in 1913 and 
raised with 10 other brothers and sisters on a farm in Nebraska.&nbsp; Her idea 
of a family car was a wagon pulled by a team of &nbsp;horses; surely there were 
much better advancements than hot and cold running water, that&rsquo;s just 
something we take for granted.&nbsp; She explained to me how all the years she 
was growing up it was one of her many chores to carry water in from the well 
that would be used throughout the day for cooking, cleaning, doing the dishes, 
washing up, etc.&nbsp; If you wanted it hot, you had to heat it on the wood or 
coal burning stove.&nbsp; Try bathing 11 kids and heating all that water.&nbsp; 
Needless to say, bath water was shared.&nbsp; Winters in Nebraska can be harsh, 
try carrying water in from the well when it&rsquo;s freezing outside.&nbsp; 
When she was in her 20&prime;s, she finally moved into a home that had indoor 
plumbing.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t too many more years before they had electricity 
and a party telephone line.&nbsp; She said none of those innovations improved 
the quality of life and health&nbsp; for her family as hot and cold running 
water.</p> 
<p>Now I understood why she never minded doing all those dishes or bathing the 
grandbabies and great grandbabies in the kitchen sink.&nbsp; She said it never 
stopped amazing her how all you had to do was just turn a handle and water was 
at your fingertips.&nbsp; She used to say that whoever thought the cell phone 
was a great invention never had to use the outhouse in the middle of the night.
</p> 
<p>My grandmother is no longer with me to stand at the kitchen sink this 
Thanksgiving and help with the dishes and tell stories about growing up in the 
early 1900&prime;s; but I think about her often when I turn on the faucet and 
just like her, I&rsquo;m thankful for something that I take for granted 
everyday.&nbsp;&nbsp; To her it was magic.</p> 
<p>We at Qualtire Plumbing and Construction hope you have a wonderful 
Thanksgiving and have time to pause and reflect on the little things that make 
our lives better and for the family and loved ones that make life worthwhile.

<h3>Go Green with Hybrid Water Heaters</h3> By Dennis Qualtire &middot; 
Comments(0) <br>

<p>Did you know that in the Phoenix area your water heater is the second 
largest user of electricity?&nbsp;Hybrid electric heat pump&nbsp;water heaters 
can save you about $320 in your electric bill per year. That&rsquo;s $3,200 
over a ten-year period! And don&rsquo;t forget, they qualify for a federal tax 
rebate of up to 30%.</p> 
<p>Qualtire Plumbing &amp; Construction is offering $500 off a new GE Hybrid 
water heater and installation. It saves electricity by using a heat pump on top 
of the water heater that takes warmth out of the ambient air and pumps it into 
the water tank. It draws cold water from the bottom of the tank and circulates 
it through the heater pump and back into the tank. The process will also cool 
the outside air which can be an advantage in your laundry room or garage.</p> 
<p>Some other advantages are that it comes with a ten year warranty, has the 
Trusted Energy Star rating, fits in the same location as your old water heater 
using existing water and electrical connections, and has multiple settings for 
vacation and high demand for when you have guests.</p> 
<p>Call Qualtire today at 602-246-0656 for more information or to schedule a 
technician to come to your home and see if this water heater is right for you. 
Remember Qualtire Plumbing &amp; Construction has been your Phoenix plumber and 
remodeler since 1964. We do our own warranty work, too, so you always know who 
to call!</p> 
<p>If anyone has any specific issues you would like us to discuss, by all 
means, please let us know. We&rsquo;re always here to answer your questions and 
give you the best advice we can. You can call us at 602-246-0656 or email us at

<h3>What About Kitchen Countertops?</h3> By Dennis Qualtire &middot; Comments 
(1) <br>

<p>Today let&rsquo;s discuss countertops and backsplashes and how they can 
make that tired old kitchen look new. I used to think that when you updated 
your kitchen you had to do cabinets, countertops, sinks, the whole ball of wax. 
I have since leaned that is not altogether true.</p> 
<p>A couple of years ago, my wife decided we needed to spruce up the kitchen, 
The cabinets were not quite ten years old, so she suggested that we install new 
granite kitchen countertops and backsplashes. Viva la difference!! Almost 
instantly, a new look but not at a huge cost.</p> 
<p>We suggest when installing backsplashes, you can use matching granite or a 
complimentary tile splash with your solid countertop.&nbsp;Accent tiles come in 
myriad colors and styles, so&nbsp;you can get very creative with your 
backsplashes to give your kitchen a custom and unique appearance.</p> 
<p>There are a number of products out there to fit any budget. From the new 
formicas to custom soapstone, you can get any look you like. Call Qualtire 
Plumbing &amp; Construction at 602-246-0656 and schedule your free&nbsp;kitchen 
consultation. As I have said before, we have extended our kitchen remodel 
specials into September so take advantage of the savings and update that 
kitchen before the holidays.</p> 
<p>If anyone has any specific issues you would like us to discuss, by all 
means, please let us know. We&rsquo;re always here to answer your questions and 
give you the best advice we can. You can call us at 602-246-0656 or email us at

<h3>Gas or Electric Stoves?</h3> By Dennis Qualtire &middot; Comments (0) <br>

<p>Sometimes your stove can just be an unused appliance since we all rely on 
those microwaves so much these days. But the right stove can make a big 
difference in meal preparation. Here are some basic differences.</p> 
<p>1. Cleaning</p> 
<p>Traditional stoves were hard to clean. Generally, you had to take them all 
apart just to get at the mess. Newer electric&nbsp;stoves come with&nbsp;easy 
clean glass solid tops, eliminating this problem. Gas stoves require a little 
extra effort as you must clean the burner grate and the area underneath.</p> 
<p>2. Cost</p> 
<p>Electric stoves either traditionally or the new easy clean are generally 
less expensive to purchase&nbsp;than gas units. If your house has only an 
electric outlet for the stove and you would like to purchase a gas stove, you 
would have an additional cost to install a gas line to the unit (if you have a 
gas provider in your area). This cost will depend on how far from the gas meter 
the stove is located. Qualtire Plumbing &amp; Construction does provide free 
estimates for gas lines and services such as these. Operational costs are 
fairly comparable.</p> 
<p>3. Convenience</p> 
<p>Gas will get hotter faster and also cool down faster. Electric sometimes 
takes a little more getting used to as it heats slower and cools slower. When 
you are cooking with electric and are through, you need to remove the pan from 
the burner as it stays hot. Gas stoves will cool as soon as you shut the gas 
off so pans don&rsquo;t have to be removed immediately. Professional cooks, as 
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve noticed if you watch the cooking shows, often 
prefer the gas stove.</p> 
<p>4. Preference</p> 
<p>Since there are pros and cons to each, it really just boils down to what 
you like and are comfortable with. Appliances are an important part of updating 
that kitchen, and stainless steel is still quite popular whether you choose a 
gas or electric stove.</p> 
<p>Being out of town some this past month, I haven&rsquo;t written as many 
kitchen remodel blogs as I had intended so I&rsquo;m going to continue with 
kitchen remodeling ideas into September. If anyone has any specific&nbsp;topics 
you would like to discuss or have me address, please let me know. We&rsquo;re 
always here to answer your questions and give you the best advice we can. You 
can call us at 602-246-0656 or email us atinfo@qualtire.com. Qualtire Plumbing 
&amp; Construction has been your Phoenix plumbing and remodeling company since 
1964.</p> <br>

<h3>What Can We Say About Kitchens?</h3> By Dennis Qualtire &middot; Comments 
(0) <br>

<p>What can we say about kitchens that has not already been covered a 
multitude of times? That&rsquo;s the hard part.</p> 
<p>Maybe something as simple as a new kitchen faucet to replace that old, 
crusty dripping one; or maybe a complete kitchen remodel with new modern 
cabinets, counter tops and lighting. Whatever your project, we can handle it 
from design to completion.</p> 
<p>As Karen said previously, this month we will be discussing individual items 
that will make your kitchen look like new.</p> 
<p>You might want to start with new plumbing fixtures, i.e. faucets, sinks, 
garbage disposals. These items are readily available and can be installed for a 
nominal cost. Just make sure you install all new piping, valves, and those 
non-burst faucet supplies under that new, maybe stainless steel,&nbsp;sink. The 
reason for starting with the sink is to eliminate any existing leaks which 
could cause future problems &ndash; mold or mildew. We want to make sure our 
&ldquo;new kitchen&rdquo; is leak free before we proceed.</p> 
<p>Qualtire Plumbing &amp; Construction has been serving Phoenix and the 
greater valley as your trustworthy plumber and remodeler since 1964. One of the 
unique aspects of our company is that we are licensed plumbers, general 
contractors, and electrical contractors and can consequently handle your 
kitchen remodel from start to finish. We don&rsquo;t outsource!</p> 
<p>If anyone has any specific issues you would like us to discuss, by all 
means, please let us know. We&rsquo;re always here to answer your questions and 
give you the best advice we can. You can call us at 602-246-0656 or email us at
info@qualtire.com.</p> <br>
