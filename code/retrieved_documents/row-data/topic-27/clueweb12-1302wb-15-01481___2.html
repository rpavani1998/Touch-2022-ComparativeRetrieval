<h1>Sauna Stoves<br>
 Wood Burning, Electric or Gas? - 904 </h1> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Which type of sauna heater or sauna stove is best is truly a matter of 
opinion. One type may be better than another in certain conditions and 
circumstances, but the bottom line seems to be that electric sauna heaters, gas 
sauna heaters, and wood burning sauna heaters each have unique appeal.</p> 
<p>According to sauna authority Mikkel Aaland, who wrote Sweat, a 1978 history 
of international bathing customs, &ldquo;Whether to use an electric, gas, or 
wood burning stove is the first decision in sauna building.&rdquo; And the 
author asserts that it&rsquo;s a decision that may be influenced by geographic 
location.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If you live in the country where firewood is plentiful and fires 
have minimum environmental impact,&rdquo; Aaland contends, &ldquo;the wood 
burning stove is the best performer and must be considered the first 
choice.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Few people would refute the claim that wood burning sauna stoves help to 
create an almost seductive ambience for the sauna bather &ndash; one of soft 
heat, an agreeable outdoorsy aroma, and the calming sound of a crackling fire. 
The use of a wood burning heater can also help foster a more intimate 
relationship with nature &ndash; one in which the sauna bather may hew and 
carry his or her own wood and tend to the fire.</p> 
<p>In some areas, however, local building codes, insurance costs, and 
regulations about wood burning stoves may strongly discourage you from owning 
or using this type of sauna heater. If that&rsquo;s so, you may have to choose 
between an electric and gas sauna heater. The resulting ambience will likely be 
less enticing for some people, but others will appreciate the added 
convenience, particularly when it comes time to clean the heater. Unlike wood 
burning stoves, electric and gas sauna heaters create no ashes.</p> 
<p>You may automatically want a gas sauna heater if you live in a gas-heated 
home or an electric sauna stove if electricity provides the heat in your home. 
Afford some thought, however, to the argument that gas sauna stoves may offer 
some economic advantages over their electric counterparts. One advantage is 
that the heat in a gas sauna has a tendency to be more consistent and easier to 
regulate, making the gas sauna stove more user-friendly. Also, there may be 
areas where it&rsquo;s difficult to access electricity, so a gas heater would 
then be the more practical choice.</p> 
<p>While gas sauna heaters and wood burning sauna stoves each have their own 
following, the electric sauna heater is the most popular type of sauna stove 
available, particularly in and around urban centers where electricity is 
universally utilized. Marketed on their efficiency, sleekness, safety features 
and wide assortment of sizes, electric sauna heaters also attract attention 
because, unlike the wood burning and gas varieties, electric stoves don&rsquo;t 
give off any odor when they&rsquo;re operating.</p> 
<p>Electric sauna heaters, wood burning sauna stoves, and gas sauna heaters 
each contribute in their own unique way to make bathing in the soothing setting 
of a personal sauna an almost addictive experience. To find out which type 
would best suit your needs, seek out a qualified sauna manufacturer or dealer. 
But be warned: if they can&rsquo;t answers your questions about sauna stoves, 
the odds are they don&rsquo;t know much about saunas either. &nbsp;</p> <br>
