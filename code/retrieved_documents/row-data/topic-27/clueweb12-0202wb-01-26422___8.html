<p>&nbsp;<strong>Pellet Stove FAQs</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <b>What is a pellet stove?</b> </p> 
<p>Similar in appearance to a wood-burning stove, a pellet stove is a heating 
appliance that burns biomass fuels to create heat. Pellet stoves operate by 
slowly feeding fuel from a storage container called a hopper into the burn-pot, 
creating a steady flame.</p> 
<p><b>How are pellet stoves fueled?</b></p> 
<p>Pellet stoves are fueled by small, tube-shaped pellets that generally 
measure 1/4&rdquo; in diameter and 3/4&rdquo; in length. Pellets are a biomass 
product made of renewable substances including recycled wood waste and plant 
derivatives. When burned in a high efficiency pellet stove, a 40-lb bag of 
pellets can provide about 24 hours of steady heat for 1500 square feet of 
living space.</p> 
<p><b>Where can I buy pellets?</b></p> 
<p>Wood pellets are typically sold in 40-pound bags for between $4 and $7 
depending on the type of wood used and availability. They can be purchased at 
hardware stores, farm and fleet stores, and in big box outlet stores. In some 
areas of the country, bulk delivery is also an option.</p> 
<p><b>How many pellets will I need?</b></p> 
<p>When burned in a high efficiency pellet stove, a 40-lb bag of pellets can 
provide about 24 hours of steady heat for 1500 square feet of living space.</p> 
<p><b>What are the green benefits of heating with pellets?</b></p> 
<p>Pellet stoves burn very clean and are considered carbon-neutral, with low 
outside air particulate emissions of between just 0.6 and 1.2 grams per hour. 
And, because pellet stoves produce less greenhouse gases than fossil fuel 
systems they are good are a good choice for those committed to protecting the 
environment. They also help homeowners get closer to &ldquo;living off the 
grid&rdquo; and produce less greenhouse gases than fossil fuel systems.</p> 
<p><b>Are there any other benefits of heating with a pellet stove?</b></p> 
<p>Yes! Pellet stoves can also help your family save on heating bills. 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the cost of heating by 
pellet is well below oil, propane or electric. Interested in how much you could 
save? Check out the pellet fuel cost calculator here! Heating with pellets also 
offers the ability for your family to better to control heating costs since 
prices for pellets are much more predictable than that of propane, oil and 
natural gas.</p> 
<p><b>How do I control the heat, does it take a lot of work?</b></p> 
<p>Today&rsquo;s stove technology is advanced. Many feature programmable 
thermostats that adjust heat output and control room temperature automatically 
&ndash;a few simple adjustments by the homeowner and the stove does the rest!
</p> 
<p><b>How do I know which pellet stove is right for my home?</b></p> 
<p>When considering a pellet stove for your home, it&rsquo;s important to 
remember one size does not fit all. A stove too large for the heat demand of 
your house may operate with slow, smoldering fires much of the time to avoid 
overheating the room, and an undersized stove can be damaged by frequent 
over-firing to keep up with heat demand. To find the stove that best suits your 
particular home and heating needs, it&rsquo;s best to consult with a pellet 
stove dealer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Fireplace Safety Tips</strong></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When enjoying your fireplace, stove or insert, it&rsquo;s important to 
remember these basic safety precautions:</p> 
<p>&bull; Fireplaces, stoves and inserts become hot during operation. This is 
a characteristic associated with their function of providing heat in the home.
<br></p> <br>

<p>&bull; Parents are advised to keep small children away from fireplaces, 
stoves and inserts. These appliances should be treated with the same caution as 
hot range tops, ovens and clothing irons. Physical barriers, such as adjustable 
safety gates in doorways, can be used to keep children, as well as pets, a safe 
distance away.<br>
</p> <br>

<p>&bull; Factory screens that are provided with the product and secondary 
barriers such as free-standing screens help to reduce the risk of serious 
burns, as they can prevent skin from coming into direct contact with the glass 
or fire. However, screens also retain heat so touching them is not advised.<br>

</p> <br>

<p>&bull; As with all heat generating appliances, fireplaces, stoves and 
inserts (and their surrounding material) will remain hot for a period of time 
after being turned off, so caution should be used at all times.<br>
</p> <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>Above is a photographs of a fireplace screen. Screens that are provided 
with your fireplace, stove or insert help to prevent skin from coming into 
contact with the glass and should never be removed.</p> <br>
