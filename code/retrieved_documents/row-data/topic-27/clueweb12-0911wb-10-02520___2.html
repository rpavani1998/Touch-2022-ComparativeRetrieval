 I don't know how much time 
I've wasted--uncomfortably doubled over with my eye at flame level--trying to 
coax the stove to burn at the lowest possible temperature. <br>

<h1>Redesigning Stoves</h1> 
<p> Redesign  UI Design Fundamentals </p> 
<p>The kitchen is a great place to go bad interface diving. Who can resist 
taking potshots at undecipherable microwave controls? Do you know how to set 
its clock? Its power level? I don&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;m not about to dig out 
the manual with buttered fingers. But today&rsquo;s dive isn&rsquo;t about the 
technological gizmos that we all know complicate our cooking lives. Instead, 
its about re-evaluating an interface that we all take for granted; an interface 
that is so ingrained in us that we don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s possible 
to even think about making it better. Today&rsquo;s bad interface is The Stove.
<br> <br>
<strong>Showing the Heat</strong></p> 
<p>There are two main stove varieties: gas and electric. Cooks generally agree 
that gas is preferable. Why? Because with the gas stove, the size of the flame 
gives immediate feedback: the larger the flame, the more quickly the food will 
cook. The coils of an electric stone do turn red&ndash;after a long 
wait&ndash;but it&rsquo;s hard to gauge the relative temperature from the 
color. Staring at a red coil tells you much less about the cooking temperature 
than does a quick glance at the size of the flame: the red only tells you that 
the stove is hot, not<em>how</em> hot. In interface terms, an electric stove 
doesn&rsquo;t give a good indication  of its temperature. Because of this, 
you&rsquo;re forced to stand with your hand over the stove, just to know that 
turning the knob actually did something .</p> 
<p>This leads to a general rule: interfaces should always give indication that 
lets the user know exactly what they&rsquo;ve just done: turning the knob makes 
the flame grow. And it should always give that indication<em>immediately</em>. 
It is because this rule is consistantly violated that many web sites disclaim 
&ldquo;Click the &lsquo;Order&rsquo; button only once&rdquo; and the 
technically savvy wait until self-doubt sets in: &ldquo;Did I actually click 
the button?&rdquo;. Nobody&rsquo;s sanity would be called into question if only 
websites provided some immediate feedback.</p> 
<p><strong>What Goes Where?</strong></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Take a good look at the picture of the stove above. It looks nice and 
innocuous, doesn&rsquo;t it? But which knob would you turn to start the left 
back burner? Knob 1, 2, 3, or 4? Is that your final answer? Did you pick knob 
1? So do I every time I go to use the stove, but that&rsquo;s wrong. Knob 1 
starts the front left burner. The answer is knob 2.</p> 
<p>Okay, how about if you want to start the right back burner? Knob 3 or 4? 
You&rsquo;ve got the pattern now: it&rsquo;s knob 4. Sorry, wrong. It&rsquo;s 
knob 3.</p> 
<p>Frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which knob the controls which 
burner&ndash;none of the possible mappings are good. None of them arenatural. 
You just cannot map four object arranged in a square in a unique way to four 
objects arranged in a line. If you pick one way, someone else will pick 
another. Instead, a good knob layout should mirror the burner layout:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Simple. You&rsquo;d think that it would be standard&ndash;a simple change 
effortlessly removes the everyday mistakes of stove use: I&rsquo;d never again 
burn the kitchen mitt I always leave on the front burner. And all because of 
the natural mapping between the knobs and the burners. The general interface 
rule we can derive is thus: controls should retain the spatial or conceptual 
relationship of the things they control.</p> 
<p>Now go take a look at your stove. I&rsquo;ll go out on a very thick limb 
and guess it has the bad co-linear knob configuration. This is bad-design 
inertia at work.</p> 
<p><strong>Help Me Simmer</strong></p> 
<p>Stove designers cleverly used the same knob that controls the temperature 
of the stove to also control whether the burner is on or off. This is a lesson 
that I wishradio designers would learn. Unfortunately, this knob design this 
means that &ldquo;off&rdquo; and &ldquo;simmer&rdquo; are only separated by a 
few degrees. I don&rsquo;t know how much time I&rsquo;ve 
wasted&ndash;uncomfortably doubled over with my eye at flame level&ndash;trying 
to coax the stove to burn at the lowest possible temperature. Because I never 
quite know where the lowest setting is, I invariably turn the burner off at 
least three times before getting it right. If only the stove designer&rsquo;s 
had thought to put a little detent at the minimum gas flow position, then I 
could feel instantly&ndash;without looking&ndash;exactly where simmer is. Given 
that tactile feedback, I might even be able to pull off rice pudding while 
cooking an egg. Doubtful, but I can keep dreaming.</p> 
<p>If rethinking an interface as simple as your stove can make your life 
better, imagine what rethinking the fundamental interface tools of computers 
can do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to find a techno-savy youngster who can see the world from 
a non-technical perspective. There aren&rsquo;t many - I guess the compulsion 
to get immersed in technology is just too great for most:</p> 
<p>I like particularly the appreciation of the subtle benefits of manual 
systems which are so often overlooked. A old-style volume control provides an 
instant volume change facility, instant volume recognition facility, ability to 
adjust quickly or slowly etc.</p> 
<p>I hope you boys finish your simplicity interface soon so I don&rsquo;t have 
to finish mine. Then I can focus my energy on something less difficult.</p> 
<p>All the best.</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip; So what do you think of the &ldquo;Quick Minute&rdquo; button 
common to many microwaves? I think it&rsquo;s the most useful button, but then 
you get problems when you don&rsquo;t want your food to explode after just 40 
seconds&hellip;</p> 
<p>About the stoves, you said &ldquo;a simple change effortlessly removes the 
everyday mistakes of stove use&rdquo;&hellip; but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it 
effortless&hellip; The control panel on the stove design you suggested would 
have to be twice as tall as a normal, and would look sort of funny being so 
oblong with the two stacked dials. (Maybe if they had linear controls instead 
of knobs it would work?) I guess I&rsquo;m picking at straws here, but I think 
it&rsquo;s just the fact that making a panel that&rsquo;s twice as tall (or 
coming up with a design to acommodate your arrangement in the same size of 
control panel) is the initial barrier that designers haven&rsquo;t been able to 
overcome yet.</p> <br>

<p>My home stove has four knobs in one row, and a picture next to each knob 
shows which burner it controls. That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p> <br>

<p>The &ldquo;Quick Minute&rdquo; button on microwaves forces the user to make 
a choice, andfewer choices mean fewer worries. It may sound kind of nitpicky 
here, but every little extra choice the user needs to make can add up to one 
confusing interface.</p> 
<p>The best microwaves are the ones with knobs: as long as they&rsquo;re 
properly marked, you can use the same simple, quick mechanism to heat your food 
for 1 minute, 40 seconds, or however long you want.</p> <br>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to say the best microwaves <b>in theory</b> are the ones 
with knobs. I&rsquo;ve never actually come across a knob-contolled microwaves 
that didn&rsquo;t have some give in the mechanism that limited my control of 
the microwave time to a range of plus or minus 30 seconds.</p> 
<p>Maybe a knob with a digital readout would work&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>Atul<br>
April 13th, 2006 11:46 am</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s true, Mike, although I believe that knob Microwaves with 
digital readouts do exist. A search on Amazon.com yieldedthis Sanyo microwave, 
which features a &ldquo;60-minute digital rotary timer&rdquo;&hellip; It seems 
to be getting decent user reviews, too.</p> <br>

<p><i>The best microwaves are the ones with knobs</i></p> 
<p>Yes! My microwave has a knob&hellip; unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not 
because I was being mindful of its usability or anything, but just because it 
was $5 on ebay (plus $20 shipping&hellip;). But since owning it, I&rsquo;ve 
realized how much easier and simpler it is to use, and I find it annoying to 
have to use the button microwaves at Uncle Joe&rsquo;s and Cobb coffee shop. Ex 
libris has a knob microwave similar to the Sanyo one Atul linked to, and It is 
awesome, and nicer than mine. (Although mine also has a knob for choosing the 
power level! which is cool.) Itlooks like this but older and less snazzy. </p> 
<p>Actually I think this is the microwave in ex-libris. It has pretty good 
timing precision. But unfortunately, whenever I use it, my food explodes within 
45 seconds. I know how long it&rsquo;s going to cook for, but I don&rsquo;t 
know if that duration is right for my food or not. This is something that 
can&rsquo;t be remedied by a digital readout. This is just a problem with how 
powerful the user expects the microwave to be. It&rsquo;s rare to find two 
microwaves that take the same amount of time to heat the same amount of food to 
the same temperature. How do you help the user decide how long to cook it for? 
Perhaps have little markers alongside the numbers around the dial that say 
&ldquo;reheat 6 oz coffee&rdquo; or &ldquo;reheat refrigerated plate of 
food&rdquo;&hellip;? The ex-libris microwave has a bunch of text that may be 
such suggestions, but I&rsquo;ve definitely never bothered to read it.</p> <br>

<p>On my stove (http://www.amica.com.pl/) there is a simply mapping of the 
heat controller&hellip; [off&hellip;min&hellip;max&hellip;min]<br>
 So setting 
the heat to the minimum level is very simple (as well as maximum and turning 
off) and you can&rsquo;t make mistake here.<br>
 See this picture of full heat 
controller:<br>
http://sphere.pl/~tomkh/amica.png<br>
 (you can see a big and a 
small flame icon).<br>
 Also more advanced models has push-pull lighted knobs 
(I imagine if it is pulled it is not turning off when lowered to max).</p> <br>

<p>My stove goes off-&gt;starter-&gt;high-&gt;medium-&gt;low. I always found 
it startling that just turning the burner on resulted in a huge flame, but it 
makes sense from the &ldquo;give me simmer&rdquo; point of view. But they added 
a detente too (necessary at an off-&gt;high boundary), which probably would 
have sufficed.</p> <br>

<p>Hmmm, sounds nice but you are doubling the vertical size&hellip; that means 
increase manufactoring cost. Also imagine cooking on two burners. You reach 
down and bump the top knob as you try to adjust the bottom knob?</p> 
<p>How is that an improvement? I actually guessed right on your questions, 
perhaps I do more cooking?</p> 
<p>Putting the knobs at differing vertical heights seems unwise. </p> 
<p>I think a far simpler solution would be to provide large number identifying 
the burners. Though that might kill the look ;-)</p> 
<p>In other words, I think there are usability issues with the redesign.</p> 
<p>Perhaps we force cooks to learn a bit of an unnatural interface so they can 
cook quicker in the future?</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to do focus group studies on which would be 
preferred.</p> 
<p>As far as the heating temperature, the feedback issues, and &lsquo;close to 
off&rsquo; positioning, I am in full agreement.</p> <br>

<p>how about a trapezoidal layout on the cooktop and a flattened trapezoidal 
control layout.</p> <br>

<p>Aza<br>
June 5th, 2006 11:08 am</p> 
<p>Chandler, a trapezoidal layout is clever, simple, and effective. Now, if 
only we could get a stove manufacturer to make such a stove&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>Tom BEYER<br>
July 11th, 2006 12:25 pm</p> 
<p>On page 77 of his &ldquo;The Psychology/Design of Everyday Things&rdquo;, 
Donald Norman has two examples of effective mapping of Controls and Burners. 
The first is a trapezoidal layout of the burners and in the second, the burners 
are in a rhomboid pattern. But even Mr. Norman does not go far enough. The 
Controls themselves need to match the same pattern. One could even have a 
matching of size (larger controls for larger burners and small for small). No 
need for maps, numbers, or diagrams.</p> 
<p>Yes, knobs controlling both temperature, on/off, and with digital-like 
settings that have both tactile feedback and that little click sound are the 
way to design for both electric and gas ovens. And the lowest flame or power 
should be at the beginning of the knob turn, never the reverse.</p> 
<p>My family&rsquo;s Sharp Microwave could benefit from knobs - one for the 
timer and one for the power setting. It is confusing, because one must first 
input with buttons, the time, then press the power setting. The display then 
reads &ldquo;P - &rdquo; and then the user must press one of the numbers. 1 
comes up as 10, which means 10% of full power (and 2 is 20%&hellip;). 
It&rsquo;s confusing to set and when the microwave starts, there is no way to 
tell what the power setting is. One tactile knob for a digital timer and one 
knob for a digital power setting would be great for this long running and 
reliable microwave.</p> <br>

<p>Great post. Yeah, the people at Viking should actually have to use their 
own stove tops at home. So not intuitive&hellip;maybe they&rsquo;d see 
improvement is needed. And I hope they get stuck with a Viking downdraft whose 
on/off switch stops working. It costs more than $500 to replace the on/off 
switch. For the fan. Really.</p> <br>

<p>I recently bought (largely thanks to my wife&rsquo;s insistence) the 
cheapest of a couple dozen microwaves I&rsquo;d looked at, not because it was 
inexpensive but because it had the fewest useless/confusing 
&ldquo;features.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>With stoves I&rsquo;m accustomed to the convention of having the back 
burner knobs toward the center, but I have been frustrated by the impossibility 
of finding the lowest possible simmer on some units. Our new (well, new to us) 
range solves the problem like Richard&rsquo;s, with knobs that go 
off&ndash;light/high&ndash;med&ndash;low, so finding the minimum flame setting 
is just a matter of turning the knob as far as it will go. The back of each 
knob is round, but the flattish area you actually grip is thinner at one end, 
so it acts as a big, obvious arrow. Off is at 12 o&rsquo;clock, light/high is 
at 9 o&rsquo;clock and simmer is at 3 o&rsquo;clock. Since these fundamental 
settings are all located right on the horizontal and vertical axes of each 
knob, it&rsquo;s easy to see at a glance how each burner is set, even if there 
are big pots blocking your view of the actual flame, and you can do it without 
bending over to see and decipher text or icons.</p> <br>

<p>Coming very late to the party, but my (unfortunately ex-) microwave is too 
good not to mention, with a combination of discrete and analogue control on a 
single, quasi-modal knob, and a digital display.</p> 
<p>Turning the knob changed minutes in one-minute increments, and you could 
<em>feel</em> the knob click at each increment. In order to change seconds, you 
pushed (and held) in the knob and turned it. In this quasi-mode, the seconds 
increased in an analogue fashion&hellip; no clicking.</p> 
<p>This was awesome because it is incredibly rare that I put something in the 
microwave for 2 minutes and 15 seconds &mdash; it&rsquo;s usually 4, 8, 10 
&mdash; so the discrete minutes worked. And the analogue seconds were 
fantastic, because you quickly established a reflex action to push in the knob 
and twist it a little to (for example) reheat coffee for &ldquo;a little 
bit&rdquo;.</p> <br>

<p>Aza Raskin<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s a great interface, Kai. Absolutely wonderful. Now, if only <em>
all</em> microwaves could be so humane&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>I actually prefer the knobs to be either on or above the cooktop, because 
then my kids can&rsquo;t reach them. Such an obvious thing, in my opinion, but 
lost on product designers. (- from a former product designer turned 
stay-at-home-mom.)</p> <br>
