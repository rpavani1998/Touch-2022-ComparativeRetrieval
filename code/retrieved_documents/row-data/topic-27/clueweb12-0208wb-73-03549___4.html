<dd>  It's Your Oregon: Maggie Collins  Little did I know what was in store in 
January, 1973, when I walked into OEC&rsquo;s SW Water Street office. Judie 
(Neilson) Hansen was efficiently managing in a small area full of mis-matched 
furniture. I explained that Oregon Environmental Council sounded like a good 
place to volunteer because &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; was part of its name. I 
went away from that first encounter with a copy of Senate Bill 100, which I 
read that night in a toy-cluttered NE Portland living room after my 
preschoolers were tucked in.<br>

<p>We received this inquiry a couple weeks back asking a common question about 
the environmental comparison between electric and gas heat for cooking. Colin 
Price, our research director, did the math.Got a question for OEC? Drop a line 
and we'll do our best to find an answer!</p> 
<p>We need a new stove. We had electric and were thinking of going to natural 
gas because we like to cook on that better, but then I thought...hydrocarbon, 
pipelines...etc. So which is best for the environment in the long run? Should 
we stay electric or go gas?</p> 
<p>Cinda, Corvallis</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hello Cinda,</p> 
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s a great question. As with most choices, there are trade 
offs involved. Instead if purchasing a new stove that has the embedded 
environmental impacts associated with its production (energy, virgin material 
extraction, manufacturing, etc.), would it be possible to repair the existing 
stove? If repair is not possible, then perhaps purchasing a quality used one is 
an option? If either of these options is a possibility, then perhaps the issue 
is moot because the stove will remain electric.</p> 
<p>However, if a new stove purchase is inevitable, then purchasing the most 
energy efficient one you can afford would be optimal. There are some 
interesting induction and solar-hybrid options that available if you are 
feeling adventuresome. Some tips for energy efficient cooking are included in 
this site. That way you&rsquo;re using the least amount of energy you can 
whether it&rsquo;s electricity ornatural gas.</p> 
<p>Regarding electric vs. natural gas stoves, there appear to be at least two 
main environmental issues associated with energy type that merit consideration: 
air quality and habitat destruction.</p> 
<p>With an electric stove, the main environmental issue may be emissions of 
greenhouse gases and other harmful air pollutants associated with coal-fired 
electricity generation. There are numerous other environmental impacts 
associated with coal. Most residential customers in Oregon receive 
approximately 40% of their electricity from coal sources. You can avoid those 
emissions by purchasingrenewable power from your utility, if available.</p> 
<p>For natural gas stoves, the main environmental impact associated with the 
extraction and transmission of natural gas. When natural gas fields are 
developed, they can destroy natural habitat and harm ecosystems. Pipelines can 
have a similar effect. Burning natural gas also produces air pollution, but in 
smaller quantities than coal.There was recently an article in the Daily Green 
that may be of interest related to natural gas and energy policy.</p> 
<p>So bottom line, it&rsquo;s a tough call on which is better. I&rsquo;m with 
you; I prefer the cooking quality that gas stoves provide. However, I also 
believe that supporting renewable energy sources is important for our long term 
security, public health, and overall environmental well-being. If it were me, I 
would try and fix the existing stove and purchase renewable energy.</p> 
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re considering the environmental impact of your 
choices is a great step in the right direction. If you continue to apply that 
same scrutiny to all your consumer choices, I believe in the long run 
you&rsquo;ll make the best decisions for the environment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Thanks,</p> 
<p>Colin Price, research director</p> <br>
