<h2>Quick &amp; Easy Himalayan Salt Block Seared Flank Steak</h2> 
<p>Flank steak has to be pretty much the best thing short of a foot rub while 
drinking a root beer float.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s tough.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
ornery.&nbsp; There is a common strategy to making the flank steak supple 
enough to eat without popping your jaw out of joint: marinating.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve made coffee and ginger marinades, lime and tequila marinades, smoked 
salt and chili pepper marinades, vinegar and sugar marinades&hellip; you name 
it.&nbsp; Every time, great steak.&nbsp; But think of the poor steak.&nbsp; A 
wonderful, flavor-packed piece of meat forced to suffer quietly the insult of 
subjugation to intense acids and sugars and salts.&nbsp; When we see a flank 
steak, we see a quandary.&nbsp; How do we get that elemental flavor out of a 
meat that resists the teeth?&nbsp; There is a solution, a way honor the humble 
yet noble flank steak in its naked beauty, a way that takes virtually no 
preparation ahead of time, a way results in a fun, incredibly juicy and savory 
dish.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve covered this dish before here and elsewhere, including at the 
Himalayan salt block cooking classes at The Meadow, but I don&rsquo;t think it 
has ever actually been hammered into a simple recipe.</p> 
<p>There are two simple tricks to this dish (if you can call steak seared on a 
giant block of salt a dish): cutting the meat against the grain, and cooking it 
at a high temperature.&nbsp; Oh, and cooking it NOT on steel, but on a block of 
ancient, super dense, mineral richHimalayan rock salt.</p> 
<p>Ingredients:<br>
 1 2lb piece of flank steak<br>
 1 8x8x2 inch Himalayan 
Salt Block or Plate</p> 
<p>Place the block of Himalayan rock salt on the stove and set to low heat, 
gradually, over the course of 30 minutes, bringing it to high heat, until the 
block reaches a cooking temperature of 475 to 500 degrees F.&nbsp; Cut the 
piece of flank steak length wise along the grain of the meat, creating two long 
strips.&nbsp; Then, turning the piece perpendicular to the blade of your knife 
cut the strips across the fiber of the meat into 1/4 inch thick strips, each 
about 2 to 3 inches long.</p> 
<p>When the Himalayan pink salt plate is hot, which you can tell by when a 
sample piece of meat sizzles vigorously (or however it is that a piece of meat 
sizzles when it is REALLY sizzling), or by moving your hand closer and closer 
to the hot Himalayan salt block until your hand definitely doesn&rsquo;t want 
to get any closer at about 2 or 3 inches away, or by gunning it with one of 
those very cool infra-red thermometers and noting that it is 475 to 500 degrees 
F, you are ready to cook.</p> 
<p>Place about 12 pieces of steak onto the block.&nbsp; After 15 to 20 
seconds, flip and cook for another 15 to 20 seconds.&nbsp; Serve immediately.
</p> 
<p>The major drawback to this dish is that no matter how fast you cook, you 
can generally eat faster.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve noticed that when diners are hungry 
enough, it is possible to actually eat the entire pieces without 
chewing&ndash;sort of iguana style.&nbsp; To avoid giving the impression that 
we are savages, we have conferred upon this dish a sophisticated name that 
distracts those we are trying to impress.&nbsp; We call it bifsteak &agrave; 
l&rsquo;iguanne.</p> 
<p>Hence the name, steak a l&rsquo;iguana.&nbsp; A good way avoid just 
hovering over the stove wolfing down the hot, juicy, rare-on-the-inside, 
seared-golden-on-the-outside pieces of steak, is to bring the cooking to the 
table, where children can be controlled and adults are obligated to be civil.
</p> 
<p>Place the hot brick on a trivet and place the piping hot Himalayan salt 
brick on the table.&nbsp; The block of Himalayan salt stores enough heat to 
allow for 3 to 5 courses.&nbsp; (As the block cools, subsequent batches of 
steak will be saltier.)&nbsp; And voil&agrave;, all the civility of a good 
fondue Bourguignonne with even better, more indubitably seasoned cooking.</p> 
<p>A variety of sizes are available, and the cost-conscious, or restaurants 
looking to serve many, can useCookware 4 x 8 x 2 bricks as well.&nbsp; A 
selection available here&gt;&gt;</p> <br>

<p>wow, we just got the salt blocks at IlBelCarrello in Lexington, mo. I was 
out to Portland last Nov and visited your store, and told Charolette about it, 
and they visited this summer and bought your blocks. I am buying one, just want 
them all, and need to read about the cooking and serving. They are coming to 
dinner tonight, and I want to do something, so we can learn-I think I will 
start with the salt round with cheese and fruit to start. Then will buy one for 
the stove. What about the grill? I thought we could also use the oven, but, 
after reading your flyer, I see we cant. So, wondering about the grill-let me 
know. I love the new adventure in eating and cooking. Talking about it to 
customers at the store is fun, I just need to get more versed at it. any tips? 
Let us know. Thanks, Carol</p> </li>

<p>Carol, You can absolutely throw your salt block on the grill to heat it, 
and then cook whatever you like on it. I just did shrimp and steak myself. It 
is a good idea to place the salt stone on the grill before you light the grill, 
so that the two heat up together, making it a more gradual process. Let me know 
if you have any questions! -Mark</p> </li>

<p>Can i use my slat block on a glass top stove, gas stove or both?</p> </li>

<p>Stacy &ndash; You can use your salt block on both electric and gas stoves. 
With a gas stove, you just put it right on top, even with the flame touching 
the block. As far as electric stoves, I recommend using a metal spacer between 
the block and the heating element. Something like a grill tin or wok ring works 
very well. It&rsquo;s best to have the block somewhere around 1/4 inch above 
the element. Otherwise, heating should be the same for both stoves: heat over 
45 minutes, 15 minutes on low, then medium, then high. Happy cooking!</p> </li>

<p>I have an induction stove top so how do I use the salt block in my oven? 
Specifically, how do I cook rib eye steaks? or is it just better to use the 
plate for serving, not cooking?</p> </li> 
<li> <em>on 17 Jan 2012 at 1:18 pm</em> 6 Mark Bitterman <br>

<p>Hi Krista &ndash; A salt block will not work on an induction stove, but you 
also don&rsquo;t necessarily use it in the oven. As an enclosed space, it can 
trap moisture that is harmful to the block. It certainly can and has been done, 
but your block will not last as long. Works like a charm on the barbecue grill, 
though!</p> </li> </ol>
