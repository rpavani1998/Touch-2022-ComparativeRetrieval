 I have always been curious about how this camp stove drip 
coffeemaker would work, so I borrowed one from a friend just to try it out - to 
see if I should buy one for my next camping trip.

<h3>How the Coleman Drip Coffeemaker Performed</h3>  June 4, 2010 <br>
 It 
looks similar to a regular drip coffeemaker and has some of my must-have 
features, like drip brewing, a non-dripping carafe and you can pause it to 
serve. The carafe also pours well and the whole coffeemaker looks nice. As for 
coffee - it tastes good - like it was brewed at home with a regular drip model.
<br> <br>
 But here's where this camp stove drip coffeemaker is different from 
your regular drip pot at home. You have to regulate the heat and I found using 
less than medium heat on the gas stove was better - just brews best on the 
lower heat. But it takes about 20 minutes to brew a pot, not bad really, 
considering that without it - the alternative is a regular (non-drip) camping 
pot. So the wait is worth it if you're a drip brew coffee lover.<br>
<br>
 The 
base fits better on the smallest stove element and to reduce the risk of 
melting any plastic on this brewer, I wouldn't use the other burners while the 
brewer is sitting on the camp stove. Better to remove the pot when the coffee 
has finished brewing. And there's really no way to keep the coffee warm, except 
for a few minutes on low, or pouring the coffee into a thermal carafe after it 
finishes brewing. 
<h3>Overall Impression</h3>  I like the brewed coffee it makes and being able 
to have drip coffee while camping or when there's no electricity available - 
that's very nice. It does perform as advertised, but you do need to take care 
since making coffee with this drip coffeemaker is a little different than using 
an electric brewer.<br>
<br>
 This coffeemaker is definitely unique - there are 
no other gas-stove drip models around, so there's nothing else to really 
compare it to. But it does brew good coffee, though it takes a little longer 
and it does give the coffee lover a drip brewer that works well for camping. 
And yes, I would now feel very comfortable purchasing the Coleman Drip 
Coffeemaker for my next camping trip.
