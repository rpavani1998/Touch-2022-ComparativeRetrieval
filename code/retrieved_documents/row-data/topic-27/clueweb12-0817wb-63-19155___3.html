<h6>By Tom on October 17, 2011</h6>  I currently have a chimney that was 
previously used to vent a ng stove that we had. We tried a ventless stove, but 
we were unhappy with it. I am interested in the stove listed above, but I'm 
curious what I would need for vent pipe or adapters. The chimney is actually 
hidden in the wall and has a 6&quot; hole into it. Thanks for any help that you 
can provide.<br>

<h5>By Customer Service on October 17, 2011</h5> <br>

<h5>Answer:</h5>This particular stove can be used as a direct vent model or 
modified to work as a B-vent unit. Because of your space limitations for 
venting, I would definitely go with the B-vent setup for this unit. I'm 
assuming the 6&quot; whole you have in the chimney is a standard clay thimble? 
If this is the case, you would simply need the B-vent adaptor, along with 
enough B-vent piping to go up and over to the thimble. The only disadvantage to 
using the stove in this way is that it is not as efficient. The stove would be 
using air from inside the home, rather than outside. <br>

<h6>By Paula from Wash, DC on October 31, 2011</h6>  My house is about 1000 sq 
ft total, upstairs and basement. I want to put a gas stove in the basement for 
heat, backup during electrical outages, and beauty. How many btus do I need? Do 
I need it to be vented? Is this model a good one?<br>
<br>

<h5>By Kevin E. on November 2, 2011</h5> <br>

<h5>Answer:</h5>This is a great option - as direct vent units generally are. 
Direct vent run efficiently without ever pulling combustion air from a room. 
Our general rule is 35 BTUs per square foot of desired heated space. For your 
application, the below option may be a better choice.<br>

<h6>By Tom from Williamstown, NJ. 08094 on November 2, 2011</h6>  Can I hang a 
LCD TV over this fireplace?<br>

<h5>By Collin C. on November 2, 2011</h5> <br>

<h5>Answer:</h5>There will be no issue with installing an LCD TV above this 
stove, as long as the projection requirements that are outlined in the owner's 
manual (which can be downloaded on this item page) are observed. The unit will 
only allow a mantel or TV to project so far out from the wall. For most stoves 
and fireplaces, the amount of projection that is allowed gradually increases 
the higher the TV or mantel is mounted. <br>
