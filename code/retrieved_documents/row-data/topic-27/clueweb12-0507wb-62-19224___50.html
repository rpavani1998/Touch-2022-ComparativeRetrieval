<p><i><b>This post is from GRS staff writer April Dykman.</b></i></p> 
<p>My husband and I are in the process of building a home on 4.5 acres in the 
Texas hill country. At the moment, we&rsquo;re still in the planning phase 
&mdash; not quite ready for blueprints.</p> 
<p>Last month,&nbsp;our architect asked us to start thinking about the make 
and model of the kitchen appliances we want for our home. Visions of sleek, 
Thermador cooktops and double ovens danced in my head. Even when I saw the 
hefty price tag, I thought maybe we could find other ways to cut back so that 
we could afford the dream oven. After all, we&rsquo;re both avid cooks. To us, 
eating well is one of the best ways to enjoy life. There&rsquo;s no doubt 
we&rsquo;d use it, so the purchase makes sense. Right?</p> 
<p><em><strong>Reality check from a minimalist</strong></em><br>
 Then I 
happened upon an article by Mark Bittman, who writes The Minimalist column in
<em>The New York Times</em>. In &ldquo;So Your Kitchen is Tiny. So What?&rdquo; 
he describes how he makes do with<i>42 square feet of kitchen space</i>, 
precious little counter space, and a stove that sometimes doubles as storage 
for pots and pans. It is in this space that he develops most of the recipes for 
his cookbooks.</p> 
<p>But when he posted a photo of his kitchen on his blog, readers were 
shocked. Bittman writes:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> [Chefs and food writers] know that when it comes to kitchens, size and 
equipment don&rsquo;t count nearly as much as devotion, passion, common sense 
and, of course, experience.</p> 
<p>To pretend otherwise &mdash; to spend tens of thousands of dollars or more 
on a kitchen before learning how to cook, as is sadly common &mdash; is to fall 
into<b>the same kind of silly consumerism</b> that leads people to believe that 
an expensive gym membership will get them into shape or the right bed will 
improve their sex life. As runners run and writers write, cooks cook, under 
pretty much any circumstance.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>With my feet firmly back on the ground, the fancy cooktop and double oven 
were erased from our kitchen plans. We don&rsquo;t need top-of-the-line 
appliances to do what we love. Sure, I&rsquo;ll have to cope with the quirky 
nuances of our oven, which loves to cook my cupcakes unevenly just to spite me, 
but I&rsquo;ve learned its ways and I work around it.&nbsp;We know where the 
hot spots are on the stovetop, and we&rsquo;ve learned how to position the 
racks just so for even browning. Surely if we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;managed with a 
slightly cantankerous oven for this long, we&rsquo;d be just fine with 
a&nbsp;new, moderately-priced range.</p> 
<p>We do love to cook &mdash; and we like to think we&rsquo;re pretty good at 
it &mdash; but we don&rsquo;t&nbsp;need a 36&Prime; Thermador to let the world 
know that, hey, in case you weren&rsquo;t aware, we&rsquo;re serious about 
food. That wasn&rsquo;t my conscious thought as I was drooling over appliances 
at Lowe&rsquo;s, but Bittman&rsquo;s article made me question my motives (and 
probably saved me&nbsp;a couple thousand&nbsp;dollars). Anything that could be 
cooked on a fancier stove can be cooked on a standard one.</p> 
<p><em><strong>Curbing wants, focusing on needs</strong></em><br>
 Because 
we&rsquo;re building a house, it dawned on me that this is just the beginning 
of a<i>long</i> list of decisions we&rsquo;ll have to make &mdash; each one 
with a price tag. Our goal is to keep expenses down as much as possible so that 
we don&rsquo;t feel owned by our mortgage payment. We want to pay off the house 
early. We want to travel. We want the flexibility that a lower house payment 
affords us.<b>My fear is that we&rsquo;ll be faced with so many decisions 
that&nbsp;we might lose sight of our goals.</b></p> 
<p>To help us stay on track, I started thinking about questions to ask 
ourselves as we&rsquo;re faced with more and more building decisions. 
I&nbsp;organized the set of questions&nbsp;into a flowchart, which we&rsquo;ll 
use&nbsp;as a tool to help ignore emotions and evaluate need.</p> <br>
My 
&ldquo;Should I Buy It?&rdquo; Flowchart 
<p></p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how this would work using my cooktop example:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First, we&rsquo;d ask ourselves whether we can afford it. Technically, 
yes, we could.</li> 
<li>Is it something we need? Yes, our house will need a cooktop of some sort.
</li> 
<li>Is there a less expensive option? Yes, a standard range is much less 
expensive.</li> 
<li>Is the alternative durable? Yes, there are durable ranges. (We researched 
Consumer Reports articles on ranges for their top picks.)</li> </ul> 
<p>Our result? The flowchart suggests we should purchase the less expensive 
option.</p> 
<p>This chart could be used for small, personal&nbsp;purchases, as well. For 
example, I&rsquo;ve been coveting a blue YogiToes towel for my yoga practice. 
Can I afford it? Yes. Is it something I need or lack? No. I have one in red. 
Flowchart says don&rsquo;t buy it.</p> 
<p>I know we&rsquo;ll want a few nicer features in our home, but <b>it&rsquo;s 
important that our spending decisions&nbsp;are made&nbsp;consciously</b>. 
Little upgrades here and there could easily add up to a sizable mortgage in the 
end. If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned from being in credit card 
debt, it&rsquo;s that the seemingly small things accumulate quickly. The only 
way to combat this is to be conscious of what we buy &mdash; and why we are 
buying it by constantly keeping a check on ourcredit report.</p>

<p>Fantastic concept, April.</p> 
<p>This simple flowchart is a great technique to help you minimize that effect 
that emotions will have on the buying process. It&rsquo;s especially important 
for those big ticket items like kitchens!</p> 
<p>Tangible tools that help lead to conscious spending. It doesn&rsquo;t get 
any better than this .</p>

<p>We lived in a house with the fancy Thermador stove and oven. It looked 
good, but it absolutely failed as a cooking appliance. The gas burners were 
constantly in need of adjustment and put out too much heat, even on the lowest 
setting. Need to gently simmer something? Forget about it. The oven 
couldn&rsquo;t hold temperature and cookies inevitably burned on some racks, 
undercooked on others. Cleaning the thing was a major hassle, as well.</p> 
<p>We now live in a house with a GE Profile smoothtop stove. The stovetop 
heats and allows a wide range of cooking, the oven heats evenly throughout. I 
bet it cost about 1/10th of the Thermador&rsquo;s price but it does a MUCH 
better job.</p> 
<p>Consumer Reports has consistently reported similar results over the years, 
too &mdash; the &ldquo;boring&rdquo; brands like GE, Kenmore, Whirlpool, 
Maytag, etc deliver far greater value and less hassle than the 
&ldquo;premium&rdquo; brands like Thermador, Viking and Sub-Zero. They are even 
available with the stainless steel look if that&rsquo;s what you want, too.</p> 
<p>Also, there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t put a double oven in your new 
home &mdash; just get two &ldquo;regular&rdquo; ovens &mdash; IIRC they are 
something like $500 each. Or, if you don&rsquo;t want to spend the money right 
now, you can always set up the cabinetry with the right connections for a 
second oven so you can add it easily, later on.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re also big Bittman fans in our house. We really like his simple 
approaches to cooking that usually turn out fantastic. &ldquo;How To Cook 
Everything&rdquo; is definitely the go-to cookbook for many of the meals we eat!

<p>Great post.<br>
 I think that if I kept Bittman&rsquo;s words in mind, 
I&rsquo;d save even more than a few thousand dollars&hellip; if I made it a 
lifestyle, I&rsquo;d save potentially a hundred thousand or more over my 
lifetime!<br>
 One of my favorite books, ten years ago: The Tightwad Gazette. 
The author and her hubby wanted the proverbial Big House in the Country and a 
Passle of Kids on one salary. This was their holy mission and keeping that in 
mind allowed them to accomplish it, even though it seemed impossible at first. 
The success of her (2) Tightwad book(s) helped!<br>
 Bittman appeared in this 
month&rsquo;s edition of Runner&rsquo;s World, and another pic of him in his 
kitchen is in it. Great article in Runner&rsquo;s World too&hellip; topic: 
Healthy eating, less meat.<br>
 P.S. We have a tiny kitchen too! 13 ft by 7 ft, 
and some of that taken up by a jog! But we plan to make it a little jewel. On 
the cheap!</p>

<p>This is a very interesting post to me, and I&rsquo;d like to see more of 
this flavor. I&rsquo;m not interested in &ldquo;How I got into/out of 
debt&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fortunate to have alot of extra room in 
my budget now, I&rsquo;m working to become independently wealthy, but I also 
enjoy certain material things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are in the process of looking for a new place for the first time 
together and think that this post is PERFECT for us as we start shopping for 
furniture, down to new curtain ties. What&rsquo;s really important is what we 
should be looking at&hellip; we have a year/year and a half before the actual 
move so this will help immensely. Thanks so much for the advice!</p>

<p>My wife and I just finished redoing the kitchen of the house we recently 
moved into.</p> 
<p>The previous kitchen was old, badly designed, and ugly. We would not have 
enjoyed cooking in that space.</p> 
<p>The new kitchen, which is nice but not top-of-the-line, gives us 
significantly more space (both cupboard and countertop), and is a joy to work 
in.</p> 
<p>Strictly speaking, we could have functioned in the old kitchen. However, we 
would have been frustrated with it, and would probably have eaten out more as a 
result. I&rsquo;m not going to claim the new kitchen will save us money over 
the long haul, but if it means we spend even $50/month less eating out, 
it&rsquo;s certainly something to consider.</p> 
<p>We also identified the new kitchen (or at least certain aspects of it) as a 
&ldquo;want&rdquo; that we were willing to give up other &ldquo;wants&rdquo; 
for. For example, it&rsquo;s likely delayed our purchase of a new (or new to 
us) car. When we talked about it, we both agreed we&rsquo;d rather wait another 
year or two for a new car and get the new kitchen.</p> 
<p>Overall point: yes, this is a worthy exercise. However, not everything 
should be measured solely against the &ldquo;need&rdquo; category. It&rsquo;s 
OK to get &ldquo;wants&rdquo; if you can afford them and if you have properly 
identified them.</p>

<p>What a great flow map. It makes me think of the &lsquo;thinking maps&rsquo; 
I use in class to help kids organize their thoughts before writing.</p> 
<p>This flow map could be useful in so many situations where you have to make 
a decision to spend money or not. Having a visual aid is definitely useful.</p> 
<p>Good luck on your new house!<br>

<p>We&rsquo;re rehabbing a house and I really identified with this. There are 
so many decisions to make it starts making your head spin, and even though we 
have a budget, there are tons of times when I say, but I really WANT that.</p> 
<p>In addition to the flow chart, a chart of expenses, expected and actual, is 
helpful. It makes me happy to save a few bucks here and there, and if I&rsquo;m 
under, sometimes I&rsquo;ll splurge on something (like tile) because I love it 
and because I can. Overall, though, some unexpected expenses from rehabbing 
(mostly electrical/water issues) have kept that from happening!</p>

<p>I love this post.</p> 
<p>A friend got an expensive new kitchen a while back and although he said 
they were happy with the kitchen &ndash; &ldquo;the food still tastes the 
same&rdquo;. </p> 
<p>As for the flowchart &ndash; I would suggest putting your brand new house 
purchase to the test. New custom built houses are VERY expensive.</p>

<p>Another factor to consider is timing. Some things can be added later, some 
can&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been considering a kitchen remodel, but I decided replacing the 
roof (which needed replacement anyway, badly) with a metal one and adding 
gutters and a rainwater collection system was a higher priority for me. I did 
replace the range vent hood at the same time, since it vents through the roof, 
and I&rsquo;m very happy with that upgrade (old one didn&rsquo;t really do much 
except make noise).</p>

<p>My mom has a double stove like this one, the Maytag MER6741BAW &ndash; 
White 30 Inch Freestanding Electric Range. It&rsquo;s got two ovens in the 
space of one. (No under-stove storage area.)I&rsquo;s around $800, so 
it&rsquo;s a bit more than a single stove, but I know she finds it really 
useful. She can bake a casserole in the top while cooking a meat dish in the 
bottom.</p>

purchase I want to make and got stopped at the first box (&ldquo;Can you afford 
it?&rdquo;)</p> 
<p>I know I need to ask myself that, but it&rsquo;s a helpful reminder to see 
that I should ask myself that FIRST &mdash; before picking out the perfect 
model.</p>

<p>I love the flowchart! Our house currently has a tiny kitchen, so this 
article really hit &ldquo;home&rdquo; with me. We have struggled with 
&ldquo;stuffitis&rdquo; and resisted the move up to a bigger house that would 
stretch us financially. Instead, we&rsquo;ve chosen to simply enjoy life in our 
current little house&hellip;at least for a few more years!</p>

<p>Great flowchart that could apply to any purchase, really.</p> 
<p>We always hear the mantra, &ldquo;buy the very best you can afford and 
you&rsquo;ll never regret it,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t know if that applies to 
every situation. I think a better principle would be &ldquo;buy the very best 
you can afford and you&rsquo;ll never regret it&hellip;as long as it&rsquo;s 
something you actually care about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just in a bad mood this morning, but I think that designing 
a flow chart is a bit much, and probably unnecessary. It seems like a fairly 
standard thought process for people who have a brain (like you seem to).</p> 
<p>I love to cook and I have a small kitchen in a one-bedroom apartment 
(I&rsquo;m a recent university grad). I hate the small space. I don&rsquo;t 
like making things work. If you can afford a better kitchen, do it. I totally 
disagree with you being frugal in an area that you really don&rsquo;t have to 
be. I think life is about balance and if you both love to cook, get what you 
really want. Don&rsquo;t settle. Get the good kitchen, but skip the hot tub, 
giant deck, 2 SUVs, etc.</p>

<p>Maybe due to the fact that I create decision matrices for work, the actual 
layout and design of the flowchart itself is so flawed and hard to read that it 
bothers me.</p> 
<p>And I also have to agree with # 16 &ndash; does a purchasing decision 
actually warrant digging this flowchart out and checking it? These are just 
logical thinking processes that should happen without any need for a flowchart.
</p> 
<p>This should just be a conscious checklist. Do I really need it? Can I 
afford it? Are there other options I should look into?</p> 
<p>It seems like something pretty simple has been turned into something quite 
complex for little added benefit.</p>

Investing&ndash;&rdquo;I would suggest putting your brand new house purchase to 
the test. New custom built houses are VERY expensive.&rdquo; We are not 
building a large home, just a right-sized one with room to expand later, and 
we&rsquo;ve paid off a great percentage of our land already. We&rsquo;re also 
in a unique position because my dad is in construction. Our goal is to be able 
to pay all bills on one salary.
<p></p>

collection, too!</p> 
<p>@ebyt&ndash;We definitely plan to budget for some wants, but we don&rsquo;t 
need the Rolls-Royce of ovens when an Accord gets the job done. And yes, the 
flow chart is a fairly standard process, but so is &ldquo;spend less than you 
earn&rdquo; and &ldquo;burn more calories than you consume.&rdquo; With such an 
overwhelming number of decisions to make about the tiniest details, I think it 
would be easy to &ldquo;treat&rdquo; ourselves to too many upgrades. It&rsquo;s 
just a way to ground ourselves before deciding what to buy.</p>

<p>Some of my most enjoyable times in my life have been on trips staying in 
modest cabins and beach houses. What I liked about them was that they were 
simple, on the small size but extremely functional, with durable and long 
wearing but not high end materials and furnishings.</p> 
<p>Everything was easy to clean and maintain, and there wasn&rsquo;t so much 
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; so you could spend more time doing stuff you wanted and 
relaxing than being owned by the house.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s my ideal for housing, and we keep that in mind while in the 
process of remodeling our house. Surprisingly the most functional (and to me 
attractive) solutions are NOT the most expensive.</p>

<p>I think your flow chart could be a big help in a long project like your 
house. After you&rsquo;ve made so many choices and seen the giant numbers 
you&rsquo;ve spent it&rsquo;s easy to think what&rsquo;s another $200 for this 
and $500 for that. I also quite like Erika&rsquo;s (#9) suggestion to keep your 
actual and budgeted expenses so you know as you progress if you&rsquo;re saving 
or overspending, as that will help inform your final decisions on some items.
</p> 
<p>I empathize with your oven situation. We&rsquo;ve got an oven that only we 
can use because the temperature control knob temps don&rsquo;t correspond to 
the actual oven temps. Burner supports on the stove slip and the pots tilt (not 
dangerously). Every year or so we look at new ovens and get dismayed by the 
lack of quality at the low end but don&rsquo;t want to spend thousands on a 
better one. Our latest idea is that we&rsquo;ll find an old, used, 
non-functional Aga (or equivalent) and my guy will repair and install. His 
skills make this a safe and sane endeavor for us, obviously this isn&rsquo;t a 
solution for everyone. In the meantime we just keep cooking with the crappy one 
that works just fine, once you understand it. Best of luck in your new house.

<p>I kinda like this, it makes sense especially with the added step of 
&ldquo;is the lower cost option high quality&rdquo; However, the point of being 
frugal, the point of managing money well, the point of doing all the the things 
we do to build wealth is to enjoy some of the fruits of our efforts. I think at 
some point we need to include the evaluation of &ldquo;Will I enjoy it&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;Which will I enjoy more&rdquo;. If cooking is an important hobby 
there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with making a purchase to upgrade for a more 
ejoyable experience as long as it does not compromise other more important 
fiancial goals. Few of us buy cars strictly for economy. There are also the 
enjoyability and comfort factors and we spend a few extra dollars to be 
comfortable and feel good when we drive.</p>

<p>First of all, the 42 square foot kitchen makes me laugh. Our Times Square 
apartment had a kitchen that was MAYBE 18 sq ft. It was literally a small 
closet, with french doors to hide it from the living room. We didn&rsquo;t even 
have a full-size fridge, just a large dorm room style mini fridge under the 
counter. Still, we cooked many extravagant meals there&ndash;the stove and oven 
worked same as any other kitchen. </p> 
<p>Secondly, as someone who&rsquo;s looking forward to building a new house 
down the line, I&rsquo;m curious about the overall budgeting process for such 
an enormous undertaking. Did you start with an overall number, and are now in 
the midst of allocating it towards specific parts of the build? Or are you 
starting with what you&rsquo;d like, and then seeing if that&rsquo;s 
affordable? Having spent a little too much time in the kitchen section at Home 
Depot while my husband was comparing fridges, I totally can see how quickly one 
could wipe out a budget doing a kitchen remodel. It almost seems overwhelming 
to make so many decisions all at once.</p>

<p>Layout is more important than appliances. I remodeled the kitchen in my 
last house, and although I loved my new ovens and induction cooktop, the change 
that made the biggest difference was moving the island one foot further away 
from the fridge. If possible, mock up your kitchen plan and make sure you can 
move around comfortably.<br>
 In the book &ldquo;Creating the Not So Big 
House&rdquo; they show several houses that were designed to be upgraded later, 
one to be enlarged, the other to have nicer finishes. There&rsquo;s some ideas 
about which things you are better off investing in right away and which things 
you can add later. I thought this sounded like a great way to watch your budget 
while still considering your dreams.</p>

<p>A flow chart can be helpful (at the very least as a demonstration method 
for making logical decisions), as long as you fully define the goal and know 
what the constraints really are. While it might seem that &lsquo;buy a 
stove&rsquo; is the goal, it&rsquo;s really more &lsquo;make our kithen an 
efficient, non-frustrating and enjoyable workspace for us to work in at the 
same time, on a budget of $##,000, so that we can eat healthy at home and have 
fun cooking together&rsquo;. Then you can look at each of the options and 
determine how each choice fits the goals and affects the other choices.</p> 
<p>We have a small kitchen &ndash; the floor space is just 4 x 7, but one of 
the things it has that makes the tiny kitchen work is that the cooktop (a cheap 
glass top one from the Sears scratch &amp; dent) is separate from the double 
wall oven (a non-cheap one). The double wall oven has been so worth it! I can 
be cooking at the stove, and even though the kitchen is tiny, my partner can 
get things out of the fridge, get the silverware, and tend to both the 
microwave and oven without even walking behind me. The sink &amp; cooktop are 
one work area, and the oven &amp; fridge are another. Yes, the wall oven cost 
more compared to a standard stove, but the microwave doesn&rsquo;t take up 
counter space, of which we have precious little, and all the pots and pans are 
right under the stove, and my partner and I have a less frustrating time 
cooking together, and subsequently we eat at home much more often than we did 
before.</p>

<p>There is a reason why the AVERAGE cost overrun for building a custom home 
is 30-50%. For most people, they only build one custom home, we&rsquo;re in the 
very early stages of planning a custom home &ndash; to be build in probably 10 
years, and it is so easy to upgrade appliances, upgrade windows, add green 
technology (expensive but saves money), custom build-ins (again expensive, but 
can reduce size of home if building smart), fancy closets, upgraded design 
elements, etc.</p>

<p>One important consideration that seemed overlooked with the oven as well as 
the flowchart is resale value.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m no real estate expert, but a consistent message I hear from the 
real estate agents I&rsquo;ve spoken with and from almost every HGTV show 
I&rsquo;ve watched, are that kitchens with modern appliances help sell a home.
</p> 
<p>So, yeah, I suppose you could go with a lower end oven and get more bang 
for your initial buck, but when you sell the home, that oven may take away from 
the lustre your kitchen has for potential buyers.</p> 
<p>So I would propose an amendment to this flowchart to consider &lsquo;resale 
value&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I think the flowchart is useful for people who are new to the world of 
frugality. Anyone who is fighting a daily battle with spending/debt should 
consider this a tool before making a new purchase. However if you are a long 
time and experienced saver the flowchart is already part of your lifestyle.<br>

 As far as purchasing stuff goes, my personal philosophy is the more frivolous 
and expensive the purchase (jacuzzi, guitar, game console) the more waiting 
time required to decide if the purchase is worthy. The only ways I can justify 
spending extra money on any given item is by considering how long the item will 
be used (therefore invest extra for longer endurance/timeless look) and if we 
can notice a difference in the higher quality. My husband has had a passing 
interesting in the guitar for years, however we only just bought him a starter 
pack ($100) two weeks ago. There were several other guitars at the store for 
hundreds or thousands of dollars, however since he has little experience with 
an actual guitar, he would have a harder time hearing and feeling the 
difference between a more expensive guitar, and a generic one. This same 
concept applies to not only to stoves but every other purchase that you can 
consider.</p>

<p>Tell us more about buying land and planning for the house! Like @24, 
I&rsquo;m curious about the whole process by which you decided to do it, looked 
for and acquired the land, and settled on home site/design. Really hope to here 
more about this in the future.</p> 
<p>As to the flowchart, I think it works well for one-off decisions like 
buying a new jacket. But how would one put in in perspective with the bigger 
picture of &ldquo;given that we previously bought a suit and new khakis, but 
found used shoes&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;we kept the home to 1500 sq ft, but 
went with the expensive jacuzzi tub, but used low-end washer and only a 
clothesline&hellip;&rdquo;? Seems like there needs to be a tie to the main goal 
somewhere.</p>

<p>Great post!</p> 
<p>I really like the flowchart. I have an additional way of evaluating a 
future purchase: I ask myself whether the purchase will solve a problem I have, 
or allow me to do something that I couldn&rsquo;t do before. Keeping in mind 
the problems you are trying to solve is a great way to make the right decisions 
when remodeling, and I imagine it could be applied to building new, too.</p> 
<p>As far as kitchen appliances go, we just remodeled our kitchen, and like 
Jason, we bought GE Profile and I&rsquo;m really happy with them (I bought a 
gas cooktop and convection oven, a great combo if you love to cook.) 
Reliability and ergonomics were at the top of the list for me.</p>

<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s my thing: I see the concept. I relate to the ideas. I 
like the flowchart idea. And I still can&rsquo;t apply it to my life 
right&hellip;. Here&rsquo;s my issue, though: I&rsquo;m not overspending at 
all. I just can&rsquo;t bring myself to spend my money in large chunks. Period. 
(Unless it&rsquo;s on a car. If it&rsquo;s for just me, I feel insanely guilty.)
</p> 
<p>My current dilemma: I found a beautiful fall/winter (it&rsquo;s cotton, so 
maybe winters where I live it&rsquo;d make due) coat that I&rsquo;m coveting. 
Horribly. It&rsquo;s white, with big black buttons and in a classic cut, 
something that won&rsquo;t go out of style&hellip;. Probably ever. And 
it&rsquo;s only $150, compared to similar wool coats on sale. (Wool is nice, 
but probably overkill for where I call home at the moment.) My issue? I have no 
coat like it, I could definitely use a coat like it, it&rsquo;s more dressy 
than the heavy hoodies that I normally don in the fall/winter. Can I bring 
myself to buy it?</p> 
<p>For some reason, I just can&rsquo;t. :/ It sounds so weird, and it is. I 
have the money for it. I could definitely use it. I have no other coat like it, 
nor am I prone to purchasing coats. It&rsquo;s a good deal and typical for 
it&rsquo;s price range, and a higher quality than just going to the mall and 
picking one out without thinking. I still can&rsquo;t seem to justify it, 
though&hellip;&hellip;. (And I&rsquo;m not even spending the money on my cars 
or anything, it&rsquo;s just sitting in the bank, waiting for a job, waiting 
for a purpose or to be used. So weird.)</p>

<p>I disagree&ndash;I think kitchen remodels can be a great investment that 
yields an enormous value in ease and delight of use!</p> 
<p>Take away anything in my house and sure, I probably won&rsquo;t miss it 
that much. But I spend hours every single day in my kitchen feeding my family 
(even though I work full time).</p> 
<p>After spending 12 years cooking (a lot) for my family in a kitchen that was 
barely functional when we first moved into the house, I am *totally* enjoying 
every single thing about my renovated kitchen. Which I paid for without 
problem, in cash.</p> 
<p>And it&rsquo;s awful advice to say that you should buy cheap appliances 
because you won&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference. Good quality appliances 
add a huge amount to the resale value of a kitchen, plus they last longer and 
actually work well while you are using them. I got top of the line stainless 
Kenmore dual-fuel range &amp; hood, a Kenmore french door fridge, and a super 
quiet stainless Bosch dishwasher. They are total bliss to use!</p> 
<p>I am thinking that whoever wrote this doesn&rsquo;t cook of use a kitchen 
very much/at all. Of course in that case, who cares if your kitchen is 
functional or not?</p>

<p>@Sam&ndash;So true! And then people blame the contractor or the architect 
when the home costs more than originally quoted, even though the owners were 
the ones adding the &ldquo;extras.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>@Karen&ndash;I would never suggest buying cheap applicances. I think (and 
Consumer Reports agrees), that there are quality, mid-priced options. Also, 
what I&rsquo;ve found from reading Consumer Reports and Cook&rsquo;s 
Illustrated is that the most expensive appliance or gadget isn&rsquo;t 
necessarily the best performing.</p>

<p>@Karen &mdash; the problem with kitchen (and bathroom) remodels, as well as 
other consumer goods (like wine) is that people forget a couple of things:</p> 
<p>1) The value/money equation is not linear &mdash; it&rsquo;s asymptotic. 
For a kitchen remodel, is it worth it to spend $2-300 more for the model with 
the high ranking in Consumer Reports versus an entry level model? Probably. Is 
it worth it to spend $2-3000 more? Probably not.</p> 
<p>2) The relation between expensive appliances and quality is tenuous at 
best, an outright lie at worst.</p> 
<p>3) I&rsquo;m sorry to inform you, but by buying Kenmore, you bought 
&ldquo;cheap&rdquo; appliances in the eyes of people looking at Thermador, Wolf 
or Viking kitchen equipment. The good news is that you likely got a good value 
for your money, with a quality appliance for a good price.</p> 
<p>4) With respect to resale value, people forget what their home will be 
compared to by the next buyer. If other homes that are comparable to yours have 
Thermador stoves and built-in Sub-Zero fridges, you might be justified in 
saying it&rsquo;s an investment. If comparable homes are all arrayed with 
Kenmore appliances, the money you dump into high-end stuff likely isn&rsquo;t 
going to come back to you, since people will shop for things like number of 
bedrooms, price range, proximity to work, school districts and price first. 
When they actually show up, they&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;wow there&rsquo;s a Viking 
range here&rdquo;, but the offer they make will likely be more in line with the 
houses with Kenmore equipment.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a similar story with bathroom remodels and other home 
renovations &mdash; don&rsquo;t improve the house so much that you end up 
pricing yourself out of your own neighborhood. It&rsquo;s highly doubtful you 
will recover the cost.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with April &mdash; don&rsquo;t buy the cheapest thing 
because it&rsquo;s the cheapest thing &mdash; buy things that deliver the best 
value, which is an entirely different thing &mdash; and not determined by 
sticker price.</p>

<p>Having built a custom home, complete with cost overruns, I don&rsquo;t 
think the chart is that helpful. When making decisions on home construction, 
ask yourself these questions:</p> 
<p>-can I upgrade it later? If not, seriously consider spending the money. We 
spent big bucks on the foundation, upgraded insulation, soundproofing in the 
floors and walls, high end radiant heating system, etc.</p> 
<p>-is this a flaw that really needs to be corrected?<br>
 designing something 
on paper is so different than reality. You may discover that you really 
don&rsquo;t like something on your floor plan. Change it.</p> 
<p>-will this ultimately save me money? good windows, insulation, heating 
systems&hellip;they can all have big payoff in money and comfort</p> 
<p>-this one might be suspect, but&hellip;.will this increase the value of the 
home? We used this to justify the large lodge-style fireplace. It is a 
zero-clearance fireplace that is more like a furnace, so it also saves us 
heating costs&hellip;.but ultimately, we figured it would add more value to the 
home than it cost.</p> 
<p>So, that means that we have a home with outstanding &ldquo;bones&rdquo;, 
excellent insulation, efficient heating systems, excellent windows, and a large 
kitchen that actually cost less than that fireplace.</p> 
<p>We only spent about $10K on the kitchen including cabinets, counters, and 
appliances because we can easily upgrade it later. I should mention that I cook 
more than anyone I know and the kitchen works just fine with Kenmore and GE 
Profile.</p>

<p>My only feedback on this is that my boyfriend really pushed &ldquo;gas 
stove&rdquo; hard. When we found a bigger house to rent in our new location, 
his main criterion was &ldquo;GAS STOVE!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And, using it every day, I totally see why. We had a Ceran stove previously 
and I do like the gas one better. I&rsquo;m a convert. So go cheaper on the 
stove if you want, but DO run the gas line.</p> 
<p>Also, a gas dryer will save you a bundle on your electric bill. Our current 
place has the laundry room just steps away from the master bedroom &mdash; 
another layout choice I&rsquo;m really grateful for.</p>

<p>I think its a fantastic idea. While I was digging myself out of debt, I 
went thru a similar process for anything over $50. I was amazed at how many 
&ldquo;little&rdquo; purchases I ended up not getting.</p> 
<p>Great concept and great post</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely if we&rsquo;ve managed with a slightly cantankerous oven for 
this long, we&rsquo;d be just fine with a new, moderately-priced range.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>The problem with this logic being that a moderately-priced range from 
somewhere like Lowes will probably last you less than half the time a more 
high-end stove, like a Viking, would. There&rsquo;s being frugal, and then 
there&rsquo;s being so frugal that all the products you buy need to be replaced 
in five years (or less). Spend more money on quality and you&rsquo;ll spend 
less money in the long run.</p>

<p>Wow, what a concept! I guess once it&rsquo;s done, just print it out and 
stick it on the fridge and resort.</p> 
<p>I just buy things, and sit on it for 2 weeks, or whatever the return policy 
is and return it, if i think it&rsquo;s not worth it. Generally it&rsquo;s not.

<p>I definitely like this flowchart. What I think is helpful about this chart 
is that all these same thoughts float through my head when I make a purchase. 
However, they tend to swirl around like buzzing bees in annoying random order. 
This chart corrals them sequentially which greatly increases their 
effectiveness.</p>

<p>this thing looks like that thingamajig that programmers use to make 
software. that stuff just used to pass over my head and its nice to see that 
there are other applications other that geeky computing but be that as it may i 
think to some extent that it is unrealistic as one has to follow such a set 
pattern like a robot of a piece of software. While i advocate frugality and 
wise money management, it is not bad to splurge on a &ldquo;sinful&rdquo; 
extravagance</p>

<p>The lesson my mother and grandmother pounded into my head (refugees in 
WWII) was to always buy the best quality you can afford and then keep it 
forever. So my Viking range is 8 years old and has moved house with me 3 times. 
(Houses will sell without the high end appliances thrown in.) My knives are 10 
years old (from when I set up housekeeping on my own.) My pots and pans were 
purchased one at a time &mdash; usually on sale or from a Marshalls or TJMaxx. 
And the non-stick frying pans come from the restaurant supply section at 
Sam&rsquo;s Club.<br>
 So if you want that Thermador cooktop &mdash; go ahead. 
Based on your article, you&rsquo;ve been pretty prudent with your finances.</p>

<p>I can definitely relate to the flow chart.<br>
 Personally, I have been 
using it a lot lately but with a slight twist.</p> 
<p>Normally, I will consider only whether I can afford it and whether I need 
it/can live without it.<br>
 For the second questions, normally a cooling 
period works wonder!</p> 
<p>After passing this 2 questions, I will normally buy the item that I wanted 
and not look for cheaper alternatives.</p> 
<p>Not sure whether is it just me but from experience, I realise that I always 
spent more money buying the brand/item I wanted in the first place after 
compromising for a cheaper alternative.<br>
 On a positive side, I find that 
the joy of using something I wanted and not a compromise saves me money in the 
long run as I will continue to use it until the item breaks down.</p> 
<p>Good example of this for me will be iPod. I was using my second gen iPod 
(15GB) until it broke down and was extremely happy with it.</p> 
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>@Jason, I am very aware that Kenmore isn&rsquo;t considered 
&ldquo;luxury&rdquo;!</p> 
<p>However, the stainless Kenmore line and the dual fuel Kenmore range are 
significantly more expensive than many others available from Sears. I could 
have easily paid $2500-3000 less total for the appliances by going with the 
lower-quality models with the white fronts, etc.</p> 
<p>But they&rsquo;d be ugly, less functional (&amp; for me, ugly also 
translates into less functional&ndash;asthetics matter!), and less likely to 
wow&rdquo; a later buyer.</p> 
<p>My home is a modest one in a lower-middle class neighborhood that I 
purchased for $140K several years ago. A Viking range would just be stupid. But 
any potential buyer looking at my house would still prefer the higher-end 
stainless appliances from Sears over the cheap-looking and non-stylish (&amp; 
cheaper) models. Everyone watches HGTV, not just people who can afford the 
houses they feature!</p> 
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that it&rsquo;s a much better idea to go with the 
top of the line models in the types of things are that appropriate to the 
size/value of your home, than to pinch pennies by buying the cheaper models.</p>
