</ul> 
<p> <strong>Full Description</strong>:  Not everyone these days are as 
conventional and want something deviating from the typical gas log set. If that 
is what you are looking for, then Fire Balls are right up your alley. Sleek, 
simple and stylish these Fire Balls will provide you and your family with an 
unforgettable arrangement. The Custom Pan Burners disperse the gas across the 
main burner tube creating a remarkable ribbon of flame. All seams are welded 
for maximum performance and durability. You are able to install this burner on 
legs or flush to the floor, whichever application suits your needs best. Using 
the volcanic ash (propane) or sand (natural gas) included around the burner to 
create a pit look, makes this burner a front-runner in the vented category. 
This vented application burner is only for use in fully functioning 
wood-burning fireplaces. This set has the most basic form of ignition methods. 
The match light method of lighting this set will consist of turning your key 
valve that has been or will be installed in your wall and holding a long match 
or long lighter close to a burner port. There is no valve included with this 
ignition method, therefore if you would like to regulate the gas at your log 
set instead of through the key valve installed in your wall, simply make your 
selection in the above option (on/off valve). </p>  Warranty:  Rasmussen 
accredits themselves for a well constructed product and they back it up with a 
warranty that says so. All Rasmussen object castings and Alterna burner 
assemblies are warranted for 2 years. All of the safety controls, as well as 
other components, are warranted for 1 year from the date of purchase.

<strong>About Rasmussen Gas Logs </strong> <br>
 Rasmussen is a four-generation 
family business that manufactures a superior selection of brilliant fireplace 
attire. Rasmussen consistently provides products with unparalleled 
craftsmanship, admirable value and supreme domination within this cultivating 
industry. Rasmussen offersVented and  Ventless Gas Log Sets along with a line of
 Alterna&reg; Contemporary gas fireplace systems. To ensure the most suitable 
product for their customers, Rasmussen developed their own molding technique by 
using real wood logs as patterns and have been capable of replicating even the 
smallest of detail in the finest materials available.<br>
<br>
<strong>C Burner:
</strong><br>
The Rasmussen C Burner is the original pan style burner. It can 
be used with legs for a clean look or without legs for a fire pit appearance. 
No grate is needed or included with this burner. Instead, the logs sit directly 
in the burner pan on top of the ember bed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Match 
Light:</strong><br>
 The Match Light lighting method is the basic method 
featuring no pilot valve assembly at all. All you have to do is place your 
match or lighter in the fireplace near the log burner and turn on the gas with 
your key valve already installed near your fireplace. Control the flame height 
by adjusting your key valve. <br>
