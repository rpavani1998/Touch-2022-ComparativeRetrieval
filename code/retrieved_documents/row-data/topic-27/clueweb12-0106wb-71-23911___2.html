<h1>Kitchen Showdown: Gas Ranges vs. Electric Stoves</h1> 
<p>Have you ever noticed that talking about gas stoves vs. their electric 
counterparts can get a little, er, heated? (No pun intended!) It seems people 
have some pretty adamant opinions as to which is best when it comes to 
performance and cost.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here at C&amp;H headquarters, we'd like to consider ourselves impartial 
judges, and have compiled a pros and cons list for each to help you decide. 
There are, of course, some considerations you'll have to take into account if 
you want to switch the type of stove you use. If you want a gas stove, for 
instance, you'll need to make sure your home has access to natural gas. If not, 
you can install a propane tank and the appropriate piping, but be prepared to 
spend at least $1,000 for the process.</p> 
<p><strong>Gas Stoves: The Good</strong><br>
 *Superior performance. Those who 
have used gas and electric stoves overwhelmingly agree that gas stoves are much 
better when it comes to cooking. They heat rapidly, turn off instantly and you 
can use the flame for tasks like charring peppers and roasting marshmallows.</p>
<p>*Reliability. In the event of an electrical outage, your gas stove will 
still work, which can be a huge benefit if you experience an extended outage 
during a natural disaster like a hurricane or ice storm.</p>

<h1>Quick And Affordable Kitchen Fixes</h1> 
<p>If you can't afford a kitchen remodel but want to change the look of it, 
you have a few options in updating your space. The best part about these 
projects? Not only are they affordable, but they're quick, so you can implement 
a budget-friendly makeover in a few hours or a weekend.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Quick Kitchen Projects:</strong></p> 
<p><strong>1. Write On The Refrigerator.</strong> If you have a dated 
refrigerator and can't afford to replace it yet, jump on the trend to paint 
your appliance with chalkboard paint. This hides how old the refrigerator is 
while giving it a practical, fresh look. You can pick up a quart of chalkboard 
paint at your local hardware store. Two to three coats create the best chalk 
writing surface.</p> 
<p><strong>2. New Knobs.</strong> Hardware is like the jewelry of cabinets. By 
changing old knobs and pulls with new, stylish ones, you can really impact the 
look of your space. New hardware can get pricey if you are looking for extra 
details so if you're on a budget, look for something shiny and sleek.</p>

<h1>Daltile Introduces SlimLite Surfacing Products</h1> 
<p>At this year's Kitchen and Bath Industry Show, Daltile unveiled several new 
products, including SlimLite Slate and Quartzite, &quot;a line of innovative, 
thin and lightweight surfacing products,&quot; according to the company.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Available later this spring, SlimLite is designed to be installed on 
various surfaces, including in the kitchen and bathroom, to provide a fresh, 
new look without the burden of heavy resurfacing materials and expensive 
alternatives. The natural slate and quartzite material ranges in thickness from 
.04&quot; to .12&quot;, and &quot;brings the beauty of stone applications in a 
thin, lightweight stone facade surface,&quot; according to Daltile.</p> 
<p>And in the ultimate test of the material's DIY-friendly application, 
SlimLite can be cut with scissors, paper cutters or tin snips, the company said.

<h1>DuPont Unveils New Zodiaq, Corian Countertop Colors</h1> 
<p>When you're creating colors for kitchen surfaces, what better inspiration 
is there than food? DuPont's new color collections in Zodiaq quartz surfaces 
and Corian solid surfaces are inspired by spices and ingredients, respectively. 
Think of a kitchen infused with the warmth of chicory, or a fresh burst of 
cilantro.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Zodiaq Quartz Surfaces</strong><br>
 Five new colors are available 
in the quartz surface, a versatile material that DuPont says &quot;can be used 
in a variety of residential applications, including kitchen and bathroom 
countertops, backsplashes, wet bars, fireplace surrounds, tub decks and tub and 
shower surrounds.&quot;</p> 
<p>This year's collection, inspired by spices, includes Coarse Pepper, 
Caraway, Poppy Seed, Chicory and Sage.</p> 
<p>&quot;We wanted to capture the spirit of crafting a well-seasoned meal in a 
finely appointed kitchen, including the anticipation, creativity and 
satisfaction that naturally emerge,&quot; says Lori Alzamora, North American 
marketing manager for DuPont Building Innovations.</p> 
<p>And in response to increased consumer demand for quartz surfaces, three of 
the collection's most popular colors--Antique Pearl, Vela Brown and Abyss 
Black--are now available in the lowest Zodiaq price point, making the material 
an affordable yet stylish option for all.<br>
