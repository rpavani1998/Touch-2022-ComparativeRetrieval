<h4>Concrete Insulations...</h4>

<br>

What a lifetime of experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Ideally I would like to 
test a few recipes for insulating concrete or the<br>
&quot;refractory 
mortar&quot; you mention. Maybe Gretchen Larson can help. &nbsp;She &nbsp;<br>

operates a pottery kiln and made some vermiculite and perlite bricks for me a
<br>while back. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
We could all use a better high temperature 
(refractory), high insulation,<br>
convenient, cheap material. <br>

<blockquote> Wow, the papercrete sounds great and I too will make some this 
weekend.<br>
... <br>
The Asian Institute of technology (AIT) and Bob Reines 
have been pushing<br>
&quot;ferrocement&quot; as a construction material for 
gasifiers (and could be<br>
stoves). <br>
 &quot;Ferrocement&quot; seems to be 
wire mesh with cement around it. &nbsp;No good stuff<br>
yet on refractory 
properties.</blockquote> <br>
Ferro-cement : <br>
My domestic heating consists 
of cheap, cylindrical, thin-walled<br>
steel stoves burning oak logs, the usual 
fuel in country areas round<br>
here (the foothills of the Pyrenees). &nbsp;I 
have lined these stoves using<br>
refractory mortar, 'ready-mixed' and 
doubtless containing high<br>
alumina cement, of the type sold by builders' 
merchants for<br>
barbecues etc. &nbsp;This is built up on the inside of the 
stove walls on<br>
expanded metal lath, which is self-supporting and provides a 
better<br>
key than multiple layers of chicken-wire mesh. &nbsp;The smallest of 
<br>these stoves has seen twelve years' service, and last summer I <br>

hastily, and probably unnecessarily, patched up some minor cracks<br>
in the 
refractory lining.<br>
Advantages of refractory lining in stoves :- <br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stove does not glow red hot. &nbsp;The 
smallest stove is in my<br>
caravan and is within 8 inches of the bed. 
&nbsp;(Incidentally, the<br>
caravan is strictly non-mobile, being encapsulated 
in ferro-cement.<br>
The motive for this : &nbsp;it was falling apart ; but it 
has also greatly<br>
improved the comfort. &nbsp;The very fine steel mesh off 
old beds was<br>
used for this and is ideal ; and free) <br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. &nbsp;&nbsp;Gives a much more constant heat output
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Damp wood 'takes' better <br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. &nbsp;&nbsp;More economical, since better control 
over rate of burning.<br>
If wood is dry, stove well heated, and red embers are 
present, one<br>
can burn a single log at a time. &nbsp;It glows away like a 
cigar.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. &nbsp;&nbsp;Steel walls of stove do not 
burn through<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. &nbsp;&nbsp;Continues to give out 
heat long after the stove has gone<br>
out. &nbsp;With the one in the caravan 
this is especially so, since the flue<br>
pipe at the rear is packed round with 
the very dense bricks from an<br>
old electric night-storage heater, picked up 
at a scrap yard..<br>
Gas-producers : <br>
One of my neighbours, a retired old 
peasant farmer, who as a<br>
young man, in November 1943, took to the maquis to 
escape<br>
forced labour in Germany, tells me the much sought-after fuel for 
<br>gazog&egrave;nes (gas producers) fitted to vehicles in those days was <br>

'green' - i.e. unseasoned - beech logs. &nbsp;As mentioned, the main<br>

domestic fuel here is oak logs, preferably seasoned. &nbsp;He insists this<br>

was much the most suitable fuel : &nbsp;beech, and 'green'. &nbsp;Could this<br>
be because beech is more combustible than oak ? Beech is too<br>
combustible to 
be much good on an open hearth &nbsp;while oak beams<br>
commonly survive a 
house that burns down. ; they are more fire<br>
resistant than steel girders, 
which twist and collapse. &nbsp;But why<br>
unseasoned ? &nbsp;Adds steam, to 
make more gas ?<br>
One of the wine 'caves' in Limoux, the nearest town, was 
still<br>
running a gazog&egrave;ne lorry as recently as the early '80s. <br>

Insulation : <br>
Some years ago, after insulating a cavity wall with 
lightweight<br>
'concrete', at great expense owing to the cost of the expanded 
<br>mineral, I turned to using a sawdust-cement mortar to insulate <br>
under a 
floor. &nbsp;The sawdust was donated free by a local sawmill.<br>
Not having 
time to experiment, I probably used far more cement<br>
than was necessary. 
&nbsp;Some of the mix left over was left outside in<br>
all weathers and showed 
scant sign of deterioration over years of<br>
exposure. &nbsp;While many 
commercial insulating materials may have<br>
desirably low lambda values while 
they last, if my experience is<br>
anything to go by, they do not last long if 
there are vermin around.<br>
However I have no idea of the resistance to high 
temperatures of<br>
cement-sawdust 'concrete'. <br>
