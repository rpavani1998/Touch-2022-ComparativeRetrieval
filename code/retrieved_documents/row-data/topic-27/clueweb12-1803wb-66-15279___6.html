<h2>Broccoli Salad</h2>  June 29, 2009 &nbsp;|&nbsp; By Nick &nbsp;|&nbsp; 5 
Comments <br>

<p>A few weeks ago Jeff (my roommate while Betsy is in Atlanta) introduced me 
to one of his favorite salads. While broccoli salad may not sound too amazing, 
there are some really interesting flavors going on this salad. Roasted red 
peppers, olives, and feta give it kind of a Mediterranean feel. It also happens 
that the recipe makes enough to feed a small village.</p> 
<p>It would be solid for a picnic or just to use as a side dish. It always 
keeps really well and I ate it throughout the week. The night we made it though 
we just ate with some toastedhomemade bread.</p> 
<p>Turns out broccoli makes a good salad.</p> 
<p>Before I dive into the recipe, I have to admit something. I was kind of a 
bad food blogger for this recipe. I took photos, but I wasn&rsquo;t exactly<em>
measuring</em> all the ingredients. Luckily, I don&rsquo;t think this is a 
recipe that calls for exact proportions. In any event, the recipe below is just 
an approximation, but I&rsquo;m very certain that it will produce good results 
and also that you could add a bit more or less of any one ingredient and it 
should be fine.</p>

<h2>Broccoli Salad</h2> 
<p><strong>Yield:</strong> Serves 4.</p> 
<p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 45 minutes</p> 
<p><strong>Total Time:</strong> 45 minutes</p> 
<h3>Ingredients:</h3> 
<p>1-1.5 pounds of broccoli, floret and stems<br>
 1 medium red onion, chopped
<br> 2 tomatoes, chopped<br>
 3 red peppers, roasted, or maybe 1.5 Cups of 
jarred red peppers<br>
 1 Cup Kalamata olives<br>
 1 Cup Feta cheese<br>
 1/4 
Cup red wine vinegar<br>
 1/2 Cup extra virgin olive oil<br>
 Salt and pepper
</p> 
<h3>Directions:</h3> 
<p>1) Prep the broccoli by cutting off all the florets and then peel the stems 
and chop them into half inch cubes.</p> 
<p>2) Dunk all the broccoli into a large pot of boiling salted water. (I 
usually use about 1 Tablespoon of salt per gallon of water and I always just 
approximate it.)</p> 
<p>3) After about 3 or 4 minutes, drain your broccoli using a colander and 
then dunk the colander into ice water.</p> 
<p>4) Roast peppers in the oven (450 degrees for about 30-40 minutes turning 
every 10 minutes or so) or on top of your gas stove (set the peppers right on 
the stove top, turn on the heat and using tongs, turn the peppers every few 
minutes until they are almost black all over for about 10 &ndash; 15 minutes).
</p> 
<p>5) Set the roasted peppers on a plate and wrap them up well with plastic 
for 10-15 minutes.</p> 
<p>6) Chop up your other ingredients like the onion, tomato, olives (in halves 
or quarters), and feta.</p> 
<p>7) Peel and dice the peppers and add to mixture.</p> 
<p>8) Add broccoli to the mix.</p> 
<p>9) In a separate bowl, whisk the olive oil into the vinegar to make a 
simple vinaigrette.</p> 
<p>10) Add the vinaigrette to the veggies and add some salt and pepper to 
taste. Chill in the fridge for a few hours.</p> </blockquote> <strong><br>

<h2><strong>The Broccoli</strong></h2> 
<p><strong></strong>Prepping the broccoli is pretty easy. Cut off all the 
florets and then peel the stems and chop them into half inch cubes. The stems 
and florets work great in this recipe.</p> 
<p>Blanching ain't no thing.</p> 
<p>Once you get your broccoli chopped, we need to blanch it which 
couldn&rsquo;t be easier. Just dunk all your broccoli into a large pot of 
boiling salted water. (I usually use about 1 Tablespoon of salt per gallon of 
water and I always just approximate it.) After about 3 or 4 minutes, drain your 
broccoli using a colander and then dunk the colander into ice water. This will 
stop the broccoli from cooking. The broc should still have a bit of a crunch to 
it. It shouldn&rsquo;t be soggy at all.</p> 
<h2><strong>The Peppers</strong></h2> 
<p><strong></strong>Now you can always buy peppers that are already roasted, 
but I like to roast my own if I have the time. That way they are really fresh 
and flavorful. Now you can definitely roast these guys in the oven (450 degrees 
for about 30-40 minutes turning every 10 minutes or so), but I like to roast 
them right on my gas top stove.</p> 
<p>Literally, just set the peppers right on the stove top. Then crank up the 
heat!</p> 
<p>No grill = get creative.</p> 
<p>Using tongs, turn the peppers every few minutes until they are almost black 
all over. It&rsquo;ll probably take 10-15 minutes to get the peppers totally 
roasted. Oh and you definitely<em>cannot</em> do this if you have an electric 
stove. Only gas here people. If you have an electric stove then you will have 
to use the oven or a grill if you have one.</p> 
<p>Once your peppers are roasted, set them on a plate and wrap them up well 
with plastic. This will basically steam the peppers and make them super-easy to 
peel. They need to steam for 10-15 minutes.</p> 
<p>Steaming is the secret.</p> 
<p>While you are waiting for your peppers to steam, you can chop up your other 
ingredients like the onion and tomato.</p> 
<p>Lots of chopping.</p> 
<p>Then add in your olives and feta. I like to chop the olives in half, but 
you could quarter them if you wanted. Also, be sure that your olives are 
pitted. The last thing you want is a lawsuit because someone choked on an olive 
pit at your picnic. Ok. Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t worry about a lawsuit, but ya 
never know.</p> 
<p>Adding the good stuff.</p> 
<p>Once you get everything chopped, the peppers are probably cool and ready to 
peel and chop. When peeling the peppers you can run them under a little water 
if you want, but the skin on the peppers should basically slide off. If there 
are a few black specks that is okay. You won&rsquo;t be able to taste it in the 
final product and it kind of gives it a rustic feel.</p> 
<p>Dice these guys to be the same size as you tomatoes and onions.</p> 
<p>These guys are good.</p> 
<p>Then finally add your broccoli to the mix.</p> 
<h2><strong>The dressing</strong></h2> 
<p><strong></strong>In a separate bowl, whisk the olive oil into your vinegar 
to make a simple vinaigrette. It&rsquo;s pretty important to do it in a 
separate bowl so you can make sure the dressing is mixed well and also so you 
can taste it and adjust it if you need to.</p> 
<p>Then add it to your veggies and add some salt and pepper to taste. I liked 
it with a lot of pepper. We probably added 1 Tablespoon of fresh ground pepper 
and that was a lot. You probably won&rsquo;t need that much salt. The feta is 
pretty salty as is.</p> 
<p>All mixed up!</p> 
<p>This salad will be best if you let it chill in the fridge for a few hours. 
It is perfect on a hot summer day though. Not to mention it&rsquo;s reasonably 
healthy!</p> 
<p>Give this a shot if you are looking for an interesting salad on these hot 
days.</p> &laquo; Review: Food, Inc.  | Brussel Sprouts with Red Wine Reduction

<p>&ldquo;I was kind of a bad food blogger for this recipe&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I hope Jeff spanked you appropriately for this (in Betsy&rsquo;s absence, 
of course).</p> 
<p>That pepper blackening/roasting is THE ONLY thing I miss about not having 
the option to cook w/gas in my APT. I had been all gas, my whole life until we 
moved in there ~3 years ago. Now I actually prefer the electric range (easier, 
though slower to control temp., much better to clean/no chance of actually 
setting self on fire when cooking intoxicated).</p>

<p>If stuck with an electric stove, a gas grill will roast all your vegtables 
to pefection. An addition of a smoke packet (foil wrapped wood chips) adds that 
smokey flavor if you like.</p>

<p>Yum! This looks tasty. I wish I had a gas stove so I could do cool thinks 
like roast my peppers DIRECTLY on the range. I just moved into an apartment, so 
I had to let go of my grill. ::Insert sad face::<br>
 I think I&rsquo;ll make 
this dish at my 4th of July lunch!</p>

<p>I kick myself all the time for not documenting my process better. Its just 
so easy to get caught up in the cooking and throw in a little of this and that. 
I actually have all the ingredients for this dish in my kitchen so this might 
be coming with me to a party this Saturday.</p>
