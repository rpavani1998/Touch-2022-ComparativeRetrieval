<h3> making peace with an enemy. </h3> I hate my cooktop. <br>
Scratch that. 
<br> I don't prefer it. <br>
(Love how Lindsey teaches her kids to say that!) 
<br> <br>
<br>
I do not prefer my electric cooktop for many reasons. <br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
1. It is from the 80's. <br>
Lets be honest. Not much good came 
from the 80's, besidesThe Smiths and... I've got nothing. Pretty much only The 
Smiths. <br>
<br>
<br>
2. It takes 30 minutes to boil a pot of water. <br>

Thirty stinking minutes. For someone who is a major fail at time management and 
planning, this is oftendisastrous to normal meal times. <br>
<br>
<br>
3. It 
randomly will be a billion degrees and then ice cold for no reason. <br>
Not 
good for toffee crack making. Unless my goal is to ruin every single batch of 
toffee crack and break my addiction to it. Then it is awesome. <br>
<br>
<br>

4. It is electric. I know there are those out there that heart themselves some 
electric. I am not one of you. I learned on gas. It is all I know. I am trying 
to adjust to electric, but two months in I still dread cooking on it. Any tips? 
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But at the end of every <br>
&quot;I don't prefer my 
80'scooktop&quot; <br>
rainbow there is a pot of... <br>
<br>
<br>
AQUA!!! <br>

<br> <br>
Which makes watching water boil so much more fun. <br>
Even if it 
doesn't solve mycooktop issues, I now like it <br>
2575 <br>
times as much. <br>
<br> <br>
Besides, one of the burners is broken <br>
and now has an actual 
purpose in life. <br>
To be the resting place of my new aqua gorgeousness. <br>

<br> <br>
Thanks 320 girls! <br>
you made my birthday the. best. ever.!!! <br>

<br> <br>
p.s. what's in the pot? <br>
shells. <br>
that you simply must make. 
<br> electric success. <br>

<p>Well I would say that aqua pot would make the electric burner 
&quot;situation&quot; better too... What a BEAUTY... Looks like the perfect pot 
for making The Pioneer Woman's cinnamon rolls... I'm just sayin'...</p> Reply

<p>That awesomely colored pot would make having to live with that cooktop 
worth it...but i must point out that i see your cooktop is a MagicChef and my 
MIL currently has a NEW MC microwave which comes on and runs all by itself even 
when the door is open...and no one will own up to taking it back or 
replacing...so she's stuck with unplugging it after every use!! good luck and i 
hope you get a new one soon...but until then the aqua pot will still look great 
sitting there!!! love it...what kind is it?</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>The only good part of that cooktop is the gorgeous pot. I simply cannot 
cook on electric. I had mine ripped out and ran a gas line to my island just so 
I could have gas.</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>This is going to sound like a dumb question, but do you put a lid on the 
pot when you boil water? If not, you will lose 75% of the energy out of the top 
of the pot. You can also put warm water from the tap into the pot to make it 
faster, and of course, turn the heat as high as it will go.<br>
<br>
I miss 
cooking with gas but I've grown used to cooking with electric again since 
buying our house.</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>We currently have an electric from the mid 90s and we are getting ready to 
move to a house with a gas stove. I am actually looking forward to it. I know 
that I will especially love it when those ice storms come through and kill our 
electricity. Ugh!<br>

BTW...I make Megan's stuffed shells all the time. So 
yummy!</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>I've had to adjust to cooking on electric as well. I wanted a gas line and 
a new stove but that line would have cost $1000 and natural gas out here is 
like, $100 a month. CRAZY. Anyway, if you can, get rid of that Magic Chef asap. 
They usually put that brand in apartments. It's known for being a crappy brand. 
Good luck!!</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>Oh how I love it. How very fun! Those 320 girls are fabulous :) (And just 
so you know I never sent the package. I have just had some issues over at my 
house. And I had my cry over it, told my husband how upset I was, and now am 
making peace. So please forgive. But I just tear up everytime I see all the 
good things other people seemed to be able to send and do for Project 320. I 
hope you will still be my friend. I instead will try to find another good cause 
for my handmade items to go to.) But, oh happy day to that new pot. And I hear 
ya on electic. We had one growing up. My Mom used to use different burners for 
just one pot of carmels. Start on one that is high and then have another that 
is on a low setting and move the pot midway through. Good luck. Glad you had a 
nice little birthday party :)</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>um, I came from the 80's! But I agree, both with the bad stuff from the 
80's and how much I don't prefer my electric cooktop. Pancakes, which we make 
every week, are a major point of contention between me and my electric. argh!

<p>I have an electric cook top. I always boil my water in an electric kettle 
and then pour it into a pot on the stove top. It goes a million times faster!

<p>That recipe just found itself on a card in my recipe box! Sounds yummy! 
Should you also maybe dislike how awful the stove tops are to clean when your 
meal boils over? Maybe you don't ever do that.... I do! But if one burner is 
dead, maybe one day you'll find yourself with an actual need for a new stove. 
Until then, that pot is a beauty!</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>I really really really do not prefer electric either. Can I say loathe 
instead of hate, because that is how strongly I feel. It annoys me that if you 
have the heat up a little to high you have to wait 10 minutes for the burner to 
cool down to where you want it. Meaning you either scorch your food or have to 
slow cook it to prevent burning. I have had to deal with electric for the past 
3 years because having gas appliances is a rarity in FL. We are moving to Ohio 
now and gas stove was on my must list for buying a new house. Seriously! 
Anyhow, our last house in Ohio was originally electric stove and my husband 
(who I should note is not at all mechanically inclined or handy) ran a gas line 
to it. It was pretty expensive to run the line, of course you will need a new 
stove. So, just a thought. It may be possible to have gas back eventually.<br>

Good luck!</p> ReplyDelete <br>

Carrie Dec 18, 2009 04:26 AM <br>

<p>One more thing...<br>
It could just be the stove. We rent right now so the 
stove isn't exactly the best quality because why would the owners invest in a 
fancy stove for renters. And I haven't heard the greatest things about Magic 
Chef.<br>
So, if you are stuck with electric forever, perhaps a nice electric 
range would do the trick.</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>I am SO with you on the electric cook top. I most definitely do NOT prefer 
it! We've been in our house six months and I still have not gotten used to it 
and mess things up all the time on it. We are moving again (long sad story) and 
the thing I keep saying to myself to make things seem a little better is, at 
least I'll have a gas cook top back! :)<br>
<br>
Love your aqua pot though. Way 
cool!</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>Wow that is one cool pot! You are making me love aqua all the more! Even 
though purple is my favorite color, I know your nemesis!! But that is how I 
used to feel about aqua, turquoise, and the like because they reminded me of 
the &lsquo;80&rsquo;s, but you do aqua right and Jennifer: 
http://jennifersjunkylife.typepad.com/whimsical_junk/ has helped too. Now I 
love the color, especially along side red! And I have kind of started to love 
&lsquo;80&rsquo;s stuff more lately, does that make me old!?<br>
<br>
I was 
raised around an electric stove, but we have had gas for awhile now. I&rsquo;d 
like to go back to electric for safety reasons, but I know it will be hard to 
do, for the reasons you mentioned.<br>
<br>
We have a pretty large microwave 
and now I boil so many things in the microwave because I read an article that 
said microwaves are more energy efficient. I don&rsquo;t know if it is for sure 
true for everyone but it is for us because our stove is soooo ancient. I can do 
a large amount of noodles in the microwave and have it done in 12-15 minutes!
<br><br>
I&rsquo;ve been writing down all the recipes from yours and 
Meg&rsquo;s blog! I can&rsquo;t wait to try them all! And I will be trying some 
of these recipes next week. And speaking of&hellip;about how much cocoa or 
coffee do you put in the frosting for the Mason Jar Cupcakes? Baking more gifts 
this year!! ;)<br>
<br>
Thanks and have a great weekend! :)</p> ReplyDelete <br>

<p>advice? ;) look on craigslist for a new/used stove. those kinds of things 
make me so crazy it is worth the expenditure even if you feel that if &quot;it 
aint broke, dont fix it&quot; it's not exactly working for you either though? 
;) i have a 3 year old electric stove and i LOVE it. Yes, I know lots of people 
with gas that prefer gas, but if you found something newer, you'd be much 
happier. It's a Kenmore. Maybe even scratch and dent? Good luck!</p> ReplyDelete

<p>We have had an electric burner situation as well. Would love to have a gas 
one instead. But at least we have one. Is there any way you could repost your 
toffee crack recipe or let me know which post it is on. I am not having any 
luck finding it and it sounds so good this time of year. Thanks and by the way, 
the blue pot is awesome!!!!</p> ReplyDelete <br>
