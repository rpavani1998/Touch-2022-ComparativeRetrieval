<h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b></p> 
<p>Unless you are choosing an electric or flue-less stove then the 
installation of your stove is extremely important and you need to be thinking 
about it in advance...</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The days when you could simply stick a pipe horizontally through a wall and 
leave it at that never existed (much to some people&rsquo;s surprise) and gone 
are the days when you could put a pipe straight into an existing chimney and 
call it job done (sadly).&nbsp; Nowadays this is all covered by Document J of 
the building regulations and most people need a chimney liner.&nbsp; The 
reasons for this are simple, and for your safety and the safety of others (as 
Fireman Sam would tell you!).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> </h3> 
<h1><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><b><br>
</b></h1> 
<h3><b>Why is it any different for a stove than for an open fire?</b></h3> 
<p>The main reason is efficiency.&nbsp; Most people choose to buy a stove 
because they know they will get much more heat from much less fuel than with 
their open fire. This is true (it&rsquo;s one of the many reasons we love 
stoves) but it has consequences.&nbsp; The more you control and turn down the 
burn of your fuel the more creosote you start to create.&nbsp; Creosote is the 
black tar-like substance you sometimes find in chimneys &ndash; open fires can 
cause it, fire-boxes often do, but stoves are the real culprit!&nbsp; Creosote 
is acidic and over time it eats through brick and stone work causing leaky 
chimneys.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s flammable and it causes chimney fires.&nbsp; And it 
can melt to liquid and drip down into fireplaces and on top of stoves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>How do I stop creosote from causing a problem?</b></h3> 
<p>Well, first of all, by trying not to create too much of it!&nbsp; It is 
important to buy the right sized stove (a large stove in a small room always 
ends up being turned down low and creates much more creosote) and burning the 
right kind of fuel at the right temperature (smokeless fuel or dry hard wood 
burned hot is best).&nbsp; But, secondly, and still more importantly, you need 
to install the stove well so that any creosote you do create is safely 
contained.</p> 
<p>We think the best way to do this is by discharging the gases into a metal 
flue.&nbsp; This is either done through a Twin-wall system (when there is no 
existing chimney at all) or through the use of a metal liner dropped down an 
existing masonry chimney.&nbsp; The benefits of a metal liner are that it keeps 
the flue gases warm and moving quickly at a fixed (small) diameter so they are 
less likely to condense into creosote in the first place.&nbsp; The liner also 
creates a smooth run for creosote so that it can drip back down into the inside 
of a stove rather than on top of it.&nbsp; Liners can be swept successfully and 
closely by a small brush head which can normally be pushed up through the 
appliance or through a flue access door.&nbsp; And, finally, it can be removed 
should you ever wish to return to an open fire or should it need replacement.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Are there other alternatives to a metal liner?</b></h3> 
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Some people use clay or concrete linings (modern houses will 
usually already have a lining of this kind inside the chimney).&nbsp; The 
building regulations require that (in most circumstances) a chimney lining is 
no smaller than 6&rdquo; diameter and no larger than 2&rdquo; greater than the 
outlet size of the appliance that is installed.&nbsp; As most stoves have 
5&rdquo; or 6&rdquo; size outlets, what this means for most of us is that the 
liner must be either 6&rdquo;, 7&rdquo; or 8&rdquo; diameter.&nbsp; Should this 
be the case with an existing clay or concrete lining it should be properly 
smoke-spillage and core-ball tested and, provided it passes, it can normally be
<i>legally</i> connected to, whether it can be done <i>practically</i> however 
is another question...</p> 
<p>The difficulty with this kind of an installation is the connection at the 
bottom of the liner into the metal stove pipe and the stove.&nbsp; It is 
clearly unsatisfactory to simply slot a smaller stove pipe inside a larger clay 
or concrete liner (even with a register plate below) as the tar will not run 
down the inside of the pipe into the stove to re-burn but down the outside of 
the pipe onto the plate or appliance.&nbsp; Over time this can cause smells, 
fires and other serious problems.&nbsp; Instead, an adaptor must be installed 
around the outside of the clay flue which feeds into the inside of the stove 
pipe.&nbsp; Since the ends of clay and concrete liners are not standardised, 
neither are adaptors.&nbsp; Such a connection may prove simple, complex or even 
impossible; it will need to be considered carefully by an experienced person 
before you commit to doing it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Which kind of metal liner should I use?</b></h3> 
<p>There are countless different types of flue liner and each has their own 
pros and cons.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t cover all the details here but please 
don&rsquo;t simply assume one kind is right for you based on price or a sales 
description (or the fact your fitter happens to have some in their garage); 
give us a call so we can talk you through the strengths and limitations of the 
liner choice you are making.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Who should be installing my stove?</b></h3> 
<p>Once the stove is installed British building regulations require that a 
HETAS certificate is issued to show that the appliance was installed safely and 
legally.&nbsp; It will provide information of the installer, the materials used 
and the date of the installation so that a person working on the stove or 
chimney later has access to all the details they need. This certificate should 
be kept with the deeds of the property and included in the &lsquo;sellers 
pack&rsquo;.&nbsp; You can get this certificate in one of two ways &ndash; if a 
HETAS registered engineer installs the stove they will issue one themselves; if 
a non-registered person installs it (for example you or your builder) then it 
must be done through your local council and a building inspector will need to 
inspect the installation and issue the certification.&nbsp; You need to speak 
to the inspector in advance to ensure that the installation you have planned 
will comply with their wishes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Where do I find a HETAS engineer; can you recommend one?</b>&nbsp;</h3> 
<p>If you live locally to any of our showrooms then we will be glad to 
recommend a HETAS registered installer and even to liaise with them and 
organise your installation for you.&nbsp; Broadly speaking we work closely with 
installers who operate across Dorset, Hampshire, Somerset and Sussex and in 
some areas of Berkshire, Devon, Gloucestershire, Surrey and Wiltshire.&nbsp; If 
you wish to discuss this further then please contact us.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t live in any of the above areas then please refer to the 
HETAS website where a list of qualified installers can be found, or contact 
your local chimney sweep who will usually know a good person!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Will the installers you recommend install to my existing liner?</b></h3>
<p>Probably not.&nbsp; If a fitting component has been sourced and provided by 
us then we are confident of its quality and have direct channels of 
communication with the manufacturer.&nbsp; In the unlikely event of any 
problems arising with it we are able to examine similar items and installations 
and pursue claims through the correct channels.&nbsp; This should ensure our 
customers are treated fairly.&nbsp; We are therefore unable to organise 
installations using others&rsquo; components.&nbsp; (If the existing liner you 
refer to was purchased from us then that is another matter entirely and we will 
do our best to help you.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Will you organise the installation of my existing stove or of a stove I 
have bought elsewhere?</b></h3> 
<p>As long as we are confident that the stove complies with British 
regulations and is compatible with our flue components we are normally happy to 
organise its installation within our local area.&nbsp; Customers purchasing 
both the stove and the fitting components from us will of course be given 
priority especially during the busy season.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Will you site-visit my property before organising an installation?</b>
&nbsp;</h3> 
<p>As a discount supplier we are unfortunately unable to offer general 
site-visits free of charge.&nbsp; The price of a visit depends on the distance 
for an engineer (please telephone us for more information) but in most cases it 
will not prove necessary.&nbsp; Most of the installation work we organise 
proceeds without a site-visit; costs are estimated to within &pound;50 through 
a conversation with our sales team either in one of our showrooms or by 
telephone. Any surprises on the day (should the chimney turn out to be much 
taller than was indicated for example) are always dealt with fairly and should 
an installation prove to be impossible within the allotted budget then the work 
and stove purchase (if applicable) would be cancelled at no cost to the 
customer.&nbsp; We are so experienced with the organisation of this kind of 
work that these instances are rare.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Will you organise the installation of a stove where there is no 
existing chimney?</b>&nbsp;</h3> 
<p>We are able to recommend installers in our locality who are qualified to 
complete Twin-wall installations.&nbsp; Twin-wall is insulated flue which can 
be used instead of a masonry chimney. These components are more expensive than 
ordinary chimney lining work and the location of the stove needs to be thought 
about carefully in order to ensure the chimney is able to function well.&nbsp; 
If you do not have prior experience with these kinds of installations then 
please speak to us before making any decisions or purchases.&nbsp; The 
placement of a chimney is more science than art (whatever the architect 
envisions!) and work like this is very costly if you get it wrong.&nbsp; A 
beautiful stove with an attractively placed chimney is no good whatsoever if it 
fills the room with smoke!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>I am interested in a Gas stove &ndash; can you help with the 
installation?</b></h3> 
<p>Gas stoves must be fitted in accordance with Document J of the building 
regulations and the work should be signed off by a Gas-Safe engineer.&nbsp; 
Harridge Stoves is HETAS registered but not Gas Safe.&nbsp; We recommend using 
theGas-Safe website to locate a suitable person for the work. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>I am interested in an oil appliance &ndash; can you help with the 
installation?</b>&nbsp;</h3> 
<p>Oil stoves must be fitted in accordance with Document J of the building 
regulations and the work should be signed off by an OFTEC engineer.&nbsp; 
Harridge Stoves is HETAS registered but not OFTEC.&nbsp; We recommend using the 
OFTEC website to locate a suitable person for the work. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>I am interested in an electric stove &ndash; do I need to be concerned 
about installation?</b>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All of the electric stoves on our website have ordinary British plugs and 
plug straight in to the wall.&nbsp; The flame effects use ordinary coloured 
light-bulbs.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nice and easy!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h3> 
<p>The information offered above is intended simply as a guide and represents 
our experience and opinions only.&nbsp; There are many who have reached 
different conclusions and choose to install differently.&nbsp; At the end of 
the day, the person who signs off the installation is the one who takes 
responsibility for it so the work must be completed to their standards and in 
accordance with their opinions; andDocument J of the building regulations 
stands as the guide for us all.&nbsp; Please therefore look closely at that 
document before making any decisions about how your stove is installed</p>
