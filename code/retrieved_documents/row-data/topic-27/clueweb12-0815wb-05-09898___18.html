<h3>Off grid system in Alaska</h3> Thursday, June 18th, 2009 
<p><em>Hi Jeff.</em></p> <em> 
<p>We&rsquo;re from Alaska and thinking about buying 20 acres where 
electricity is nowhere to be seen.</p> 
<p>And since the sun is scarce in the winter, we&rsquo;re wondering what kind 
of a generator-battery-inverter system would be advisable and what&rsquo;s the 
approximate cost of setting it all up?</p> 
<p>Wind power is not an option either, as the data shows less than 5 mph, year 
round.</p> 
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p> </em> 
<p><em>SharLynn </em></p> 
<p>Sharlynn,</p> 
<p>You guys are in a tough place.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have talked with many folks 
from there and your choices are limited.</p> 
<p>The first thing you need to do is really limit your electrical usage.&nbsp; 
I assume you will be using a wood, oil, or propane cook stove, space heater, 
and water heater.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not have any heating system that requires 
operating a central fan or air handing unit as these require lots of power.</p> 
<p>I would use only a few low wattage compact fluorescent and mostly LED 
lights for lighting, and buy only very energy efficient short wave radio, flat 
screen TV, computer, and video equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must lower your 
energy needs first, and it&rsquo;s worth paying extra for the higher efficiency 
devices.</p> 
<p>Batteries do not like the cold, so they need to be above freezing.&nbsp; 
Diesel generators do not start when it drops below freezing unless you use 
crankcase and carburetor heaters, and you cannot run these high energy loads 
24/7 on battery power.&nbsp; This means you need to find ways to keep the 
generator area above freezing.</p> 
<p>Solar systems can work that far north for the periods of the year when the 
sun shines, but a generator-battery system will be needed the rest of the year.
</p> 
<p>I would check with neighbors to see how they deal with this.</p> 
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<h3>Choosing a solar panel for maximum efficiency</h3> Monday, March 2nd, 2009 
<p><em>Hello Jeff,</em></p> <em> 
<p>Putting together an off-grid system, I am inquiring as to how best 
choose/purchase the solar panels for optimal efficiency in relation to their 
voltage output. There are panels that put out similar wattage, however the 
vp/imp can vary greatly.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine for example the system objective is approximately 2kw 
using a 24v to 110v inverter with battery back-up.</p> 
<p>Which would be the best solar panels to use for maximum efficiency?</p> 
<p>* 12 &ndash; 160w panels @ 24vp/6.80imp<br>
 * 10 &ndash; 190w panels @ 
26.7vp/7.12imp<br>
 * 10 &ndash; 190w panels @ 17.8vp/10.96imp<br>
 * 10 
&ndash; 200w panels @ 53.8vp/3.16imp</p> 
<p>Thanks!</p> </em> 
<p><em>Jon</em></p> 
<p>Jon,</p> 
<p>As we say on the web site, we cannot answer specific design questions 
because there are too many variables we would not know about your specific 
application, and we are trying to keep this a free service. However, I can 
provide some general answers that should help you narrow down your choices.</p> 
<p>First, there are many things that go into the design process and the first 
is inverter input limits if grid tie, and solar charge controller input limits 
if battery based. In other words, if your solar charge controller has a limit 
of 75 volts DC input, this will require the number of solar modules wired in 
series to be well below this high limit. The NEC Article 690 provides more 
specific design guidelines related to safety multipliers that you must use.</p> 
<p>The maximum input amp rating of the solar charge controller (or inverter if 
grid tie) will determine the maximum number of parallel strings and total amps 
from the array after the required NEC design multipliers are added.</p> 
<p>Once you know the maximum voltage and maximum current your system can 
safely handle, this will define the solar array that your system can handle. 
Once you know this maximum total array wattage, you want to select the highest 
quality module you can buy that has the lowest cost per watt.</p> 
<p>Take the total delivered price of a specific module and divide by nameplate 
wattage to get the $cost/watt.</p> 
<p>If this process does not give you the solar array you want, then you will 
need to make changes to the inverter if grid tied, or the solar charge 
controller if a battery based system. Normally I first select the exact solar 
array wattage and physical size I want for a specific budget, then I select the 
inverter if grid tie, or the solar charge controller if battery based, but it 
sounds like you are working backwards and trying to base you design on 
comparing output voltages and amp ratings of the modules to fit a specific 
requirement.</p> 
<p>In other words, its like taking a car and trying to replace the engine with 
a bigger engine to get more power. However, if you do not also upgrade the 
transmission, tires, drive shaft, fuel system, exhaust system, and brake 
system, then the vehicle cannot take advantage of the higher horsepower.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<h3>Solar water pump</h3> Monday, January 19th, 2009 
<p><em>Hi Jeff,</em></p> 
<p><em>I need to power a 12 volt DC pump with solar power and I&rsquo;m not 
sure how to do it.</em></p> 
<p><em>I need to feed water into an irrigation system in a remote location 
where there is no water or electricity on-site (it&rsquo;s for a native habitat 
restoration project).&nbsp; The water was trucked in and put into a water 
pillow.&nbsp; I need to place a timer on the system, but the water pressure is 
too low for the valve to work.&nbsp; So I&rsquo;m going to install a surface 
pump to push water through the valve and I need to power it with solar 
power.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m on a very limited budget.</em></p> 
<p><em>I have spent a good deal of time searching the Internet, but I 
can&rsquo;t figure out if I can hook the solar panel directly into the pump (I 
don&rsquo;t need to water at night).&nbsp; I would like to avoid using 
batteries, if possible.&nbsp; It seems that I need a pump controller, but the 
ones I have found cost several hundred dollars and don&rsquo;t look anything 
like the one inyour article on solar water pumps.</em></p> 
<p><em>Thanks!</em></p> 
<p><em>Carie Wingert</em></p> 
<p>Carie:</p> 
<p>I guess you already considered the obvious, move the water pillow to higher 
ground and you won&rsquo;t need the pump!&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming that has been 
considered, it&rsquo;s not a problem to install a solar panel, DC pump, DC 
timer, and DC valve.&nbsp; However, it is a problem to do this &ldquo;on a 
limited budget&rdquo;.&nbsp; Like they say, you can have any 2 of 3 order 
choices -&nbsp; fast delivery, quality construction, cheap price, pick two!</p> 
<p>You did not mention if this is a drip system not requiring very much water 
pressure, or some type of spray heads that require higher pressure.&nbsp; The 
water pressure and flow rate will determine the size of the pump.&nbsp; Once 
that has been determined you can select the solar array size that will provide 
this amount of power per day.&nbsp; You must have a solar controller wired 
between the solar array and pump, and several safety devices like a low water 
cut off to protect the pump if the water bladder runs out of water.</p> 
<p>All this equipment is off-the shelf, but is not cheap.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
know your pump size, but most small DC pressure pumps will cost over $1,000, 
plus about $2,000 for the solar array and another $600 for the controls, plus 
some type of pole support for the solar array.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t spend 
the money to do this right, you will most likely have some dead plants when the 
lower cost system fails.</p> 
<p>Good luck,</p>

<h3>Grid-tie vs. Off-Grid</h3> Sunday, January 18th, 2009 
<p><em>Jeff,</em></p> <em> 
<p>Interested in knowing the economics comparison between a grid-tie v. 
off-grid system.</p> 
<p>For simplicity, let&rsquo;s imagine a 2Kw grid-tie system can be installed 
complete for $12,000, with no battery back-up.&nbsp; Also an off-grid system 
can be installed complete for the same price of $12,000 inclusive of battery 
bank.</p> 
<p>In the course of 10 years, in comparison, which system will normally 
provide higher dividends?</p> 
<p>If more details are needed for the overall scenario, please ask.</p> 
<p>Thanks,</p> </em> 
<p><em>Jon</em></p> 
<p>Jon:</p> 
<p>You are comparing apples and oranges so this choice makes no sense. If your 
goal for installing a solar system is to provide the most utility cost savings 
for the lowest initial cost, then any grid-tie system without batteries will 
have the lowest cost and will provide the shortest payback. For comparison 
purposes, inverters designed for grid-tie sell-back without batteries are 
usually a little more efficient than inverters designed to charge a battery 
bank, but this is not the real reason you would choose one over the other.</p> 
<p>Any solar system with batteries cost more for the inverter and switchgear, 
costs more for the batteries, requires battery maintenance, takes up valuable 
heated interior space that could be used for other purposes, the costly 
batteries must be replaced every few years, and as stated above, the inverters 
are less efficient in sell-back mode. Yet, there are lots of battery based 
solar systems sold each year and the reason is very simple. People buy a more 
expensive battery-based solar system because it provides peace of mind. If you 
are in an area without grid power, it provides peace of mind of having reliable 
power without running a generator 24 hours per day. If you on the utility grid 
but in an area where there are lots of power outages, it provides the peace of 
mind that your freezer, lights, and other appliances will continue to operate 
during brief power interruptions. If you live in an area that has gone weeks at 
a time without power due to yearly storm damage, you have the peace of mind 
that any future storm will have only a minor impact on your lifestyle or 
perhaps your home-based business.</p> 
<p>People place a high value for this peace of mind and do not calculate this 
in terms of payback or return on investment, just like you would not purchase a 
fire extinguisher or security system based on a cash flow analysis.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<h3>Biodiesel for generator</h3> Monday, December 15th, 2008 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>Hi Jeff,</em></p> 
<p><em>My weekend cottage is powerless at moment, but running the lines to 
attach it to &lsquo;the grid&rsquo; is estimated to cost $16,000 ! I am approx. 
300 yards away from nearest power box. So instead of doing grid tie solar, I am 
now contemplating off grid solar and looking at generators for backup.</em></p> 
<p><em>Sounds like diesel is the way to go for reliability and low 
maintenance, which is my biggest goal. I am willing to pay a little more for 
this.</em></p> 
<p><em>My question is, what do you think of running Biodiesel in most modern 
diesel generators? Is this feasible? Is this for summer time only? (I live in 
northern Wisconsin, and wonder if Biodiesel mixes would freeze!).</em></p> 
<p><em>I&rsquo;m trying to be as &lsquo;earth friendly&rsquo; as possible. 
</em></p> 
<p><em>Thanks! </em></p> 
<p><em>Mark </em></p> 
<p>Mark:</p> 
<p>Being totally off-grid is not as easy as you think unless you have lots of 
solar modules and batteries, and really limit the use or quantity of larger 
appliances. Having said that, depending on your solar exposure and location, 
the more solar you have the less generator run time so fuel type may not be a 
big issue.</p> 
<p>Some diesel engine manufacturers will void their warranty if you use 
bio-diesel, although this is changing as manufacturers get more experience with 
bio and the quality of the fuel processing improves. However, not only 
bio-diesel, but regular diesel fuels can be a real problem during the winter 
unless you use crank case heaters, fuel pre-heaters, and other heating devices 
to prevent the fuel from turning into gel. If you think solar is expensive just 
to run a few appliances and lights in an off-grid home, wait and see what it 
will cost you in batteries and solar modules just to power a crank case heater 
on a diesel generator all winter !</p> 
<p>This is why many backup generators are propane. The fuel does not go stale, 
it does not freeze, and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it turning into a 
semi-solid in the fuel lines. A fill up once a year to a 500 gallon underground 
tank should not only give you many months of backup power, but can also be used 
in a gas stove since you will not be able to have an electric stove in an 
off-grid home.</p>

<h3>Spark igniter</h3> Tuesday, November 18th, 2008 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>Hi Jeff! </em></p> <em> 
<p>We own a home which is &ldquo;off grid&rdquo;. Rather than use a wood 
burning stove, I want to install propane and get a propane range. Problem is, 
we don&rsquo;t want the pilot light burning all the time, and the existing 
spark igniters are all electric! The easy solution is to light a match every 
time I want to light a burner, but I&rsquo;m wondering if there isn&rsquo;t a 
way to modify (or build) a non-electric spark igniter that sparks when I turn 
the burner on (or that is powered by a couple of AA batteries). Got any ideas?
</p> 
<p>Jessica Laube</p> </em> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p>Jessica: </p> 
<p>The answer depends on the brand and model of your stove. Most very basic 
stoves with no electronic displays or timers, will have a spark ignition system 
that uses little or no electricity except for the brief period the valve 
triggers the spark. However, we designed an off-grid solar-powered home several 
years ago that based on our calculations would only need the generator to run 
about 3 hours once a week. After completion, the generator had to run several 
hours every day to avoid a drained battery each night. We said this was not 
possible, and returned to the site with full metering equipment.</p> 
<p>After checking every circuit, we discovered their General Electric propane 
gas stove used more electricity than the entire house! Since GE loves 
electricity, they designed their gas stove with a &ldquo;glow plate&rdquo; down 
next to the oven burner which glows cherry red the ENTIRE time the oven is 
operating! Needless to say, we sent this stove back and had the homeowner 
purchase a non-electric model.</p> 
<p>I would not try and modify your gas stove. Check to see how much electric 
ignition and controls draw when off, and then when energizing the spark 
ignition. If this is too much, then dis-connect and light with a match. This 
way there is no pilot light wasting gas.</p> 
<p>Good luck! </p>

<h3>Solar problem &ndash; parallel or series</h3> Wednesday, October 29th, 2008
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>We have a 1 kw off grid system. The actual electrical use is very low, 
but the system constantly fails- that is, it gets so low we have to shut 
everything down and run the generator. I think it may be the design. The house 
is in Kauai. There are 8 L16 6 volt batteries, all wired in series. I do not 
know how the panels are wired, but we are told that they total 1050 watts- I 
suspect they are also all in series. We use fluorescent lights- 4 in all, plus 
propane refrigerator and stove and solar hot water.</em></p> <em> 
<p>Other than lights, all that is powered off the system are a cd player, 
charging cellphones, a hairdryer in the morning for about 3-5 minutes, and a 
shop vac during the day occasionally for about 15-20 minutes. We cannot run the 
washer w/o the generator.</p> 
<p>Surely there has to be a better way to live. We have called in two solar 
guys. We have replaced batteries. We have added panels.</p> 
<p>I have done a great deal of reading and it seems that there should be some 
batteries in parallel, plus the panels need to be wired some in parallel. 
Before I challenge the solar guy, I wanted some advice. Unfortunately, I do not 
think that the experts on Kauai really analyze load, etc. No one has asked us 
what we need; they simply tell us what the system will be.</p> 
<p>Thank you for any advice or direction you can give me. We are desperate. 
</p> 
<p>Gail Stebbins</p> </em> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p>Gail: </p> 
<p>There is no difference in total battery capacity regardless of wiring in 
series, parallel, or series-parallel. Now before all those other 
&ldquo;experts&rdquo; out there read this and start sending nasty email back 
(yes, it happens all the time even knowing this is a free site!), I need to 
explain.</p> 
<p>Batteries absorb energy measured in amp-hours, and they supply your loads 
by sending these amp-hours back out. A 6-volt deep cycle battery will have the 
same storage capacity regardless of how it is wired. It makes no difference. 
Lets use an example, a typical L-16 battery will have 350 to 425 amp-hours 
depending on weight (lead) and manufacturer. Lets say 400 amp-hrs to keep it 
simple.</p> 
<p>If we wire 8 batteries in series, we will have a 48 volt battery with a 
total amp-hour capacity of &mdash; 400 amp-hours! In series, the amp-hours do 
not change. This will have a total capacity to power ( watts = amps X volts) = 
19,200 watt-hours ( 48 X 400).</p> 
<p>Now lets take the same batteries and re-wire as a 24 volt battery. This 
will be two separate strings of 4 batteries to make 24 volts each, then wired 
in parallel. Again, watts = amps X volts = 24 X 400 = 9600 watts capacity per 
EACH parallel string, so in this case the amp-hrs are added, or 2 X 9600 = 
19,200 watt-hrs.</p> 
<p>The same would be true if we re-wired them for 12 volts, you will still 
have the same total power capacity. Having proven that fact this does not mean 
they are not real differences with each layout. We always try to use the 
highest voltage battery as possible, as this results in the lowest amp current 
flow, which allows using the smallest wire size, and inverters designed for 
higher voltage can use smaller components as the currents will be lower.</p> 
<p>Another problem in wiring batteries for smaller voltages is you need 
multiple series strings. Like our example above, it would take 4 separate 
&ldquo;strings&rdquo; to wire your 8 batteries if you wanted a 12 volt battery 
bank. The problem is, the more strings you have, the more risk there is of 
un-equal charging between each parallel string. For example, if one battery in 
one string is starting to fail, or just does not charge as well as the others, 
this will cause that entire string to receive less than its share of the 
charging current. It is also possible for a single battery to fail, then all 
the other strings will &ldquo;see&rdquo; this as a load and start moving 
massive currents into that string, just like they were chargers. This can even 
cause the failed battery to get so hot it will melt down, so less strings is 
better.</p> 
<p>Again, things are never simple as you think, because our desire to have 
only one battery string and a higher voltage may not match your loads. Maybe 
your inverter can only operate on 24 volts, or you have a bunch of 12 volt 
lights. Several manufactures for DC refrigerators only offer a 12 volt or 24 
volt model, not 48 volts, so this is usually why some systems must have lower 
voltage batteries.</p> 
<p>They say if you ask an engineer what time it is, they will tell you how to 
build a watch. I hope I have not done that with your question, but we need to 
first dispel this battle you are in about battery voltage. If your inverter and 
other DC loads are 24 volts DC, then your battery must be wired for 24 volts 
DC. If you have a few 12 volt DC loads like lights, you can still use a 24 volt 
battery and install a DC to DC converter. These are low cost and will allow an 
equal loading across all individual batteries that would not be the case if you 
wired them to only part of the large voltage battery bank. Due to high cost, 
your inverter voltage will determine the battery voltage.</p> 
<p>Solar Array &ndash; Most solar modules under 100 watts are 17 volts output 
(ideal voltage for charging a 12 volt battery plus some efficiency loss). This 
means the they are wired just like the batteries in the battery bank, you wire 
them to give the output voltage to match the battery voltage, and this may 
require several separate strings. The recent introduction of MPPT solar charge 
controllers now allow using a higher voltage solar array than the battery bank 
as it will adjust the voltage and current as required for the best charging 
output. However, this advantage was not intended to allow using a high voltage 
solar array to charge a 24 volt battery. Most people use a 
&ldquo;slightly&rdquo; higher voltage solar array when there is a very long 
wire run between the solar array and the batteries to off-set the voltage loss 
of the long wire.</p> 
<p>Again, there are many technical reasons for using different voltage arrays, 
different voltage battery banks, and different voltage loads, but you 
can&rsquo;t say one way will have much less capacity than another as long as 
you are comparing the same components and just wiring them differently.</p> 
<p>Your Case &ndash; You said your batteries were replaced, but If I were 
there, I would first check each battery to make sure they are all good. If you 
have 7 new batteries and 1 dead battery, the battery bank will never charge 
right. You can use a digital volt meter for this, but these readings need to be 
taken when the battery is under a modest load. A much better way is to use a 
hydrometer. If you are adding water to your batteries more than once every 3 or 
4 months, either your charger is programmed to high or your batteries are 
getting old. Frequent watering indicates failing batteries if the charger is 
working correctly.</p> 
<p>I would next dis-connect the solar array from the batteries and check their 
output voltage, then check again after they are connected to the charger. Not 
connected, most 12 volt nominal solar modules will have an open circuit voltage 
around 21 volts. If this array is wired for a 24 volt battery, you should see 
42 volts, and for a 48 volt battery you should read 84 volts. After 
re-connecting to the battery, it will be more like 27 to 29 volts into a 24 
volt battery, and 54 to 59 volts into a 48 volt battery. Your solar charge 
controller may have a meter to provide this information.</p> 
<p>I would next check charging set-points. You appear to be in a warm climate, 
and this requires &ldquo;lower&rdquo; charging set-points for both your solar 
charge controller and your inverter charger set-points when using the generator.
</p> 
<p>The last thing I would check is the charging current when using the 
generator. I have found that most &ldquo;contractor&rdquo; type portable 
generators do not work well with inverters when charging batteries, its just 
they way they are designed to control their output voltage. If there is even a 
slight drop in generator output voltage your inverter will not just have a 
lower charging output, it may not charge at all. I have watched low cost 
generators run for hours and not do any charging at all. Assuming you have the 
worlds greatest generator, if your inverter is not programmed wrong it will 
take for ever to re-charge.Assuming you have the worlds greatest generator, if 
your inverter is programmed wrong it will take for ever to re-charge. When 
using an inverter that has programmed charging set-points, I try to increase 
the charging current amps up to the point I almost stall the generator, then 
back off a few amps. Generators use almost the same fuel at half load as almost 
idle, so loading them up provides the best fuel economy, fastest re-charge 
time, and less run hours.</p> 
<p>If all this checks out just fine, then you may have the classic solar home 
problem I see every day &ndash; the small system was designed to run a few 
lights and appliances, then each year you add more load or use them longer 
hours each day and pretty soon you start complaining the system just does not 
provide the power it did when first installed. If this is the case adding more 
batteries may not help if your solar array is too small for your loads.</p> 
<p>Sorry you are having so many problems, it should not be that way, </p> 
<p>I hope this helps. </p>

<h3>Back-up power for off-grid</h3> Saturday, September 6th, 2008 
<p><em> </em></p> 
<p><em>Dear Jeff, </em></p> <em> 
<p>Having recently bought some land in Missouri that is located out the the 
sticks and very much at the end of the power grid. I have pretty well deduced 
that I will need some back up power.</p> 
<p>Recently I have discovered the backwoodshome.com website and a number of 
your articles. As one who is not totally familiar with alternative power like 
wind and solar, everything I read seems only to confuse me more.</p> 
<p>With interest I have read about l-16 industrial batteries for a battery 
bank in some articles. In an article about adding a solar cell to a truck 
camper a RV/marine battery is recommended. Since RV/marine batteries are easy 
to find and will take to repeated charging wouldn&rsquo;t they be logical 
choice for a battery bank vice the harder to find L-16?</p> 
<p>I have noticed too that with wind power most often suggested is a dc wind 
generator that requires upwards of 6 or 7 knots of wind to operate. In 
searching around I have found a source for a AC wind generator that begins 
operation in the sub 7knot range. AC generators have to best of my knowledge a 
big advantage over DC generators and that is in size of the cable between the 
transmission line from the tower to the battery bank. An ac generator can use a 
standard ac power cord and suffers no loss in current between the tower and 
batteries.</p> 
<p>I have to admit that my understanding of the way a ac generator works is 
taken from the following website: http://www.tlgwindpower.com/default.htm On 
the opening page there is a photo of a customer using 9 ac wind generators on 
his farm in Wisconsin. Although wind power as such is confusing to me I believe 
that this ac system must be quite good or the farmer who had added to it and 
bought these generators would not be doing so if they weren&rsquo;t efficient.
</p> 
<p>Perhaps you can give some insight into battery banks and DC versus AC 
generators in a future story. Also the battery bank issue of l-16 versus marine 
batteries is very confusing to a novice seeking information like myself.</p> 
<p>Any information you can provide along these lines would be greatly 
appreciated.</p> 
<p>Thank You </p> 
<p>Keith McElroy</p> </em> 
<p><em></em></p> 
<p>Keith: </p> 
<p>Lots of questions! Actually you are talking about &ldquo;L-16&Prime; 
batteries, not &ldquo;I-16&Prime;. When I suggest using an RV/Marine battery, 
you will find that it is for a small 12-volt DC system that does not have a 
large load that would fully discharge it each day. These batteries are much 
heavier duty than a typical car battery, and most have re-combiner caps and do 
not need to add water. However, they will NOT hold up to a daily deep 
charge/discharge cycling like a solar powered home or cabin. For these larger 
loads and system sizes, the lowest cost battery designed for a heavy 
charge/discharge cycling each day is a 6-volt golf cart battery ( T-105 size). 
These are less than $100, and can be found at most big box stores during the 
summer months. They are about the same size as a car battery, but because they 
are 6-volt, the plates are very thick and very heavy.</p> 
<p>For a 12-volt system you will need two 6-volt batteries wired in series, 
and for larger systems you will need 4, 8, or 12. When you start getting above 
8 batteries of any size, its better to switch to a larger amp-hr battery and 
stay less than 16, as this can cause problems with un-even charging and 
dis-charging when you have multiple strings of parallel batteries.</p> 
<p>I think you are caught up in the AC or DC debate as a marketing ploy. There 
is no engineering difference in the amount of wind it takes to turn a wind 
turbine based on AC or DC output voltage. Wind energy is a &ldquo;cubic&rdquo; 
function of the area of the blades, and below around 7 MPH I think you will 
find most small-scale generators will not provide any real power, although the 
blades might turn. There are now both AC and DC wind turbines and each has its 
advantages, but only in wiring and additional equipment that will be required.
</p> 
<p>A 24 or 48 volt DC output wind turbine is very easy to add to an existing 
solar-power system, and some models have built-in charge controllers and can be 
hooked directly to the batteries. Yes, this will require a larger wire size 
since the voltage is lower, but the ease of wiring is its real advantage. Also, 
unless you are talking about some huge wind machine on a 150-foot tower, the 
difference in wire costs would most likely be less than 50 cents per foot for 
the larger wire caused by using a lower voltage DC model. An AC wind turbine 
can use a smaller wire size since the voltage is higher, and these are usually 
designed for grid-connect systems without batteries. There are a few other 
issues, but you cannot say an AC unit works better than a DC unit having the 
same size and blade design, and the reverse is also true.</p> 
<p>Good luck! </p>
