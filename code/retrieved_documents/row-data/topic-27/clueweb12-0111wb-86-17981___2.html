<h1>Chinese Kitchenware</h1> 
<p>How much do you know about Chinese cooking?</p> 
<p>If you know a lot, you're probably beyond what I'm teaching here. If all 
you know is that it involves a wok, here's the full picture:</p> 
<p>Chinese cooking involves many techniques. Stir-frying is the use most 
people know for the marvelous pan called a &quot;wok,&quot; but other common 
cooking techniques used in Chinese cuisine include boiling, steaming, 
deep-frying, and more. And many, even most of these techniques can be done in a 
wok!</p> 
<p>Let's look at the most important tools you'll need:</p> 
<p><b>Wok</b></p> 
<p>The wok is a semi-spherical pan useful for tossing and cooking a lot of 
food easily and quickly. The high heat at the center/bottom cooks the food 
quickly, and stirring or tossing moves the cooked food to the cooler sides. The 
plain uncoated steel wok is the most popular, and it will serve you well if you 
keep it seasoned as you would cast iron. In China, the wok fits into a hole in 
the top of a wood stove. Its shape makes it decidedly unstable on the flat 
burner of a western electric or gas stove. Manufacturers supply a metal ring to 
fit underneath the round wok, allowing it to sit over a gas burner, but that 
same ring keeps it away from an electric heating element, and the round bottom 
would contact the electric heat poorly anyway. Flat-bottomed wok designs solved 
the problem in a way, but the heat is no longer concentrated as well right at 
the center, so more oil is required, and it's harder to toss ingredients. I 
found a heavy cast-iron wok with a round-bottomed interior AND a flat bottom! 
It absorbs the great pre-heating that makes<b></b>good wok cookery possible on 
a Western stove, and it is the model I recommend.Mine, illustrated, has two 
short handles, but I'd find it easier to use with a single long handle. Choose 
the style that works best for you, or make do with a good heavy cast-iron 
skillet and learn to work around its limitations &#151; you can make good 
Chinese food without a wok if you cook carefully! A 14&quot; size is a good 
choice for the home. I do not find any need for Teflon or other nonstick 
coatings, especially in view of the need for very hot pre-heating,which is very 
harmful to nonstick coatings. There are &quot;electric woks,&quot; which plug 
into the wall and look like a neat gift idea. If you receive one, take it back 
to the store! I have never seen any model of &quot;electric wok&quot; that can 
develop the serious heat needed to cook Chinese food properly, and it is too 
wide and flat to make a good electric deep-fryer. (If you wonder what I mean 
about serious heat, get a peek behind the scenes in a Chinese restaurant and 
you'll see the equivalent of a blast furnace under the wok! The Chinese 
restaurant range delivers 160,000 BTU/hr while the best home gas ranges max out 
at 16,000 BTU/hr.)</p> 
<p><b>Cleaver</b></p> 
<p>Chinese cleavers come in 3 sizes. All have square, thick blades of 
easily-sharpened carbon steel. The medium size, which is best for most general 
use, is about 4&quot; high with a blade about 6&quot; long. You can use it for 
slicing, shredding, chopping and mincing, and one great summer use: shucking 
corn! (<i>WHAM!</i> Off goes the tip! <i>WHAM!</i> Off goes the stalk, and the 
shucks and inner silk almost fall off by themselves!) You will also either need 
to sharpen it frequently. A dull knife is frustratingly ineffective. Although I 
am a &quot;purist&quot; about some things, I am no good with a sharpening stone 
and steel &#133; I am perfectly happy with the zippy little $10 knife sharpener 
I got at a restaurant supply store. </p> 
<p><b>Wire Strainer</b></p> 
<p>Used for deep-frying foods, the frying strainer is made from wire mesh with 
a flat bamboo handle. A very handy item indeed. &quot;Screen&quot; strainers 
are shaped wrong for use in the wok, and perforated metal ones don't drain 
quickly enough.</p> 
<p><b>Wide-Blade Spatula</b> </p> 
<p>A very helpful tool for stir-frying and scooping up food. I find that a 
wooden spoon works well enough, but this works better. Buy one appropriately 
sized to the size of your wok.</p> 
<p><b>Stacking Bamboo<br>
 Steamers with Lid</b></p> 
<p>This wonderful and picturesque item fits right inside the wok over some 
boiling water. You can stack several steamers, with items that need more 
vigorous steaming places in the lower rack. Also, you can even serve food right 
in them (VERY atmospheric!) Water must be replaced in the wok as it evaporates 
during cooking. Avoid detergent when washing bamboo steamers, as the bamboo 
will absorb the flavor of the soap. Simply rinse with water instead.</p> 
<p><b>Metal Steamer</b></p> 
<p>You may see simple flat perforated plates offered for steaming things in 
your wok, but they just don't have the charm of bamboo and they are harder to 
handle and keep level. If you are steaming large quantities of food, like a lot 
of dumplings, you may want a large metal steamer dedicated to that task alone. 
It will hold plenty of water (no more running dry) and it has all the capacity 
you want! It cleans in the dishwasher and will serve you in many other cuisines 
as well.</p> 
<p><b>Electric Rice Cooker</b></p> 
<p><b>Yes, it's an essential &#133; you really, really need it, I assure you! 
You can do without it, yes, and you can also do without indoor plumbing, a car, 
air conditioning and a phone. As discussed in the chapter on &quot;Rice,&quot; 
you can get one for a few dollars; certainly don't spend over $50.</b></p> 
<p><b>The electric rice cooker is a &quot;switch it on and forget it&quot; 
device. Just add a measured amount of dry rice plus 1&frac12; that amount of 
water (no salt, butter or anything else, please!) and it will switch itself off 
when the rice is perfectly cooked, and keep the cooked rice warm for several 
hours.</b></p> 
<p><b>Yes, that's me. A rice cooker and his electric rice cooker. My kids say 
to remind you that in addition to teaching cooking and staying up till 2am 
writing e-books, you might benefit from exercise.</b></p>
