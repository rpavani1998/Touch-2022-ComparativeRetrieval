<p>ETHOS 2012, Seattle, Washington January, 2012</p> 
<p>The annual lighting of the fires was well represented by various forms of 
TLUD and T-CHAR units. Christa Roth and Amanda are in the top picture with the 
prototype of the new Hot Cube. It's a flat pack design that can be assembled by 
local artisans. The top cube is a biomass burning t-char design, and the bottom 
cube is an improved charcoal cooker.</p> 
<p>In the second photo, Paul Anderson is showing off a brand new T-CHAR 
protype. The T-CHAR is very much like a TLUD but it has an open bottom. Biomass 
can be burned to make char over a can or pot to reserve it later, or it can be 
used over a conventional charcoal stove.</p> 
<p>Jet City Stoveworks brought their metal Jatropha Seed Gasifier. It was a 
windy, wet day, and the stove burned jatropha seeds pretty well. The metal 
between the gasifier top and the chimney is a warming area that was requested 
by the community that they are developing the stove for. It gets pretty warm. I 
may still have the burn on my finger from touching it when it was hot. (I work 
with hot stoves all the time, and it amazes me how often I forget that metal 
that's been near fire is frequently hot).</p> 
<p>The blue 'tank' is a beautiful looking insulated charcoal stove that Burn 
Design Lab (Peter Scott and co) has been designing. Burn has is responding to 
consumer pressure and offering a more effecient, and beautifully designed 
charcoal stove. They are also planning to sell the latest versions of their 
biomass cooking stoves this year.</p> 
<p>The final two pictures highlight Karsten and the metal TLUD stove that he 
is building in Uganda. It is well manufactured, sturdy, was my favorite for 
cooking marshmallows and it sells for just under US$20.</p>

 Kirkland, Washington, USA January 
28th ~ 30th, 2011</p> 
<p>The ETHOS Stoves Conference was last weekend, and it included 
demonstrations by some of the stove makers and manufactures, with the 
opportunity to talk to the people using and inventing the stoves.</p> 
<p><strong>Here are some of the stand-outs from the demonstrations area, click 
on an image to view it in a larger size.</strong></p>  The Shark Stove 
presented by John and Flip Anderson. Notice the even cooking on the pancakes, 
that even heat is partially due the ceramic shark teeth construction just under 
the cooking surface. This is primarily a stick burning stove with both a 
plancha (even cooking surface) and pot rests. <br>

<p>Report on TLUD Discussions at the 2010 ETHOS conference<br>
 By Christa 
Roth and Kelpie Wilson<br>
 Submitted 8 March 2010</p> 
<p>There was a good showing of TLUD technology at the annual ETHOS Stoves 
conference in Kirkland, WA, USA on January 29-31, 2010. This report covers some 
of the discussions about TLUDs that took place at conference sessions.</p> 
<p>Dr. Paul Anderson, a.k.a., &ldquo;Dr. TLUD&rdquo;, made the pitch for TLUDs 
and biochar throughout the conference. He brought a large collection of 20 
different TLUDs. Most were simple homemade devices made from 
&ldquo;tincanium&rdquo; (Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s Friday evening presentation on 
the wonders of &ldquo;tincanium&rdquo; was delightfully humorous). TLUD 
designers Art Donnelly, Christa Roth, and Hugh McLaughlin all had stoves on 
display. Anderson had one example of a mass produced TLUD that is manufactured 
in India.</p> 
<p>About 30 people attended the TLUD community discussion session. To get an 
overview and discover who had which type of specific interest, the participants 
were asked to raise hands on which aspects of application of the TLUD 
principles they were interested in. The following aspects were identified:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Applications: is the main focus on cooking, biochar, or a combination of 
both?</li> 
<li>What are appropriate sizes? TLUDs exist for 2 cups, 2 liters, 5 l, 20 l up 
to 5 gallon, 20 gallon, 55 gallon. The interest in producing biochar is driving 
design of larger TLUDs.</li> 
<li>Natural draft or forced air. If using forced air, what are the 
implications of different power sources: grid, Thermo Electric Generator (TEG), 
battery based electricity</li> 
<li>Emissions (indoor, outdoor, any)</li> 
<li>Fuels (types of fuels, sizes and densities)</li> 
<li>Locations (which continent, urban, peri-urban, rural environments)</li> 
<li>Materials for TLUDs (ceramics, metal)</li> 
<li>What price range is acceptable? (developed country, developing countries)
</li> 
<li>What can we as individuals and organizations do to advance TLUD technology?
</li> 
<li>What are the future prospects of TLUD technology?</li> </ul> 
<p>Participants at the TLUD session participants made a list of TLUD features 
as compared to other stove types such as the rocket stove:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Makes biochar</li> 
<li>Starts fast, boils water very quickly, and burns a long time on one load 
of fuel</li> 
<li>Less attention required for fuel input (no continuous stoking of the fuel 
needed), increasing freedom for the operator/cook</li> 
<li>Fuel flexible &ndash; uses small size waste that cannot be burned in other 
stoves</li> 
<li>Cleaner than other kinds of stoves, with low Black Carbon (BC), Organic 
Carbon (OC) and CO</li> 
<li>Variety of scales and applications from cooking to metal forging, 
including barbecue, grilling, frying, heating, lighting</li> 
<li>Lightweight, portable and modular; can use multiple units to control heat 
output</li> 
<li>Easy and cheap to build from tin cans or sheet steel. Dimensional 
tolerances are not stringent</li> 
<li>Low temperature operation. Pyrolysis temperatures are below 500 degrees C, 
resulting in less combustion chamber burnout</li> 
<li>Suitable for fireplaces that are not allowed to burn open fires any longer 
</li> 
<li>Safe for indoor space heating with flue exhaust </li> 
<li>Can be an inexpensive add-on to existing stoves for specialized 
applications (e.g. water kettle in addition to a plancha stove) and to take 
advantage of small sized fuels not suitable for a rocket stove</li> </ul> 
<p>A few TLUD problems/challenges were also identified:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Lack of turndown ratio</li> 
<li>Lack of emissions robustness. More emissions on startup and sometimes on 
shut down.</li> 
<li>Changing fuel form factor when adding new fuel can cause stalling. </li> 
</ul> 
<p>The group discussed in detail the following ideas for advancing TLUD 
development:</p> 
<p><strong>Materials:</strong> light-weight ceramics are not necessarily 
needed for insulation of the combustion chamber, unlike in a rocket stove, as 
for TLUDs the temperature in the fuel bed stays at ambient temperature until 
the pyrolysis front passes through. Then temperatures get higher. The open 
flames are not within the combustion chamber but above the fuel bed. The 
hottest parts of a TLUD stove are the concentrator disk and the bottom of the 
fire chamber, where the remaining charcoal might be burnt creating high 
temperatures (if the char is not dumped out and conserved for other use e.g. as 
biochar). Ceramics are cheap to fabricate, e.g. consumable stove components 
like the concentrator disk or the bottom plate of the fire chamber. Options for 
modular stove designs containing ceramic parts to be explored further. A huge 
gap between standard pottery and industrial ceramics was noted.</p> 
<p><strong>Production and Dissemination:</strong> Stoves should come as a kit: 
combustion chamber + pot stand/application + snuffer box for the char to be 
saved.</p> 
<p><strong>Economics of charcoal:</strong> The saving of char could become 
more popular if the produced charcoal were attributed more value (carbon 
offsets for biochar used in the soil, charcoal fines to be processed into 
charcoal briquettes, water filters etc.)</p> 
<p><strong>Modular advantages:</strong> TLUDs excel on high power output, e.g. 
boiling water, but don&rsquo;t turn down the power so well. The concept of 
having a different and/or smaller combustion unit for the simmering stage or 
replacing the continuous heat addition with a retained heat cooker should be 
explored further. Modular systems could use a number of TLUD burners under a 
large pot or grill. If cooking lasts a long time, such as firing a grill at a 
restaurant, you could replace spent TLUDs with new ones to keep the heat going 
while you recharge spent TLUD&rsquo;s with new fuel.</p> 
<p>Despite the advantages of the TLUD there are very few stove programs using 
TLUDs. Here are the ones we know about:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The BP Oorja stove, now called FirstEnergy, distributed 400,000 units in 
India, but there exists little feedback on the campaign.</li> 
<li>Phillips had a TLUD stove and planned a major roll-out in India to start 
late 2009, but no up-to-date info is available.</li> 
<li>Nathaniel Mulcahy of World Stove is manufacturing institutional and 
household size stoves in Haiti (uses a pyrolytic gasifier technology similar to 
TLUD); allegedly building over 100 units per day with plans to upscale and add 
a fuel production unit for grass pellets. This is a very interesting project in 
the limelight, with high potential to create worldwide awareness. To be 
observed.</li> </ul> 
<p>Other than those listed above, there are no projects yet at a major scale. 
Participants observed that this was a &lsquo;chicken-and-egg&rsquo; scenario: 
Donors only want to roll out &lsquo;already proven technologies&rsquo; but 
nobody apart from major companies like BP or Phillips has the money to do the 
research needed to prove the technologies. Funding is needed for research to 
get the combustion chamber to the application stage and to collect user 
feedback on a major scale.</p> 
<p>The group felt there was a strong need to get more experience on the ground 
building and cooking on TLUDs. In Uganda this year a TLUD-project with World 
Bank funding will start. Funding has been secured for 2 years. More projects 
are needed.</p> 
<p>What participants committed to do:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cook on a TLUD. Several people have been making TLUDs, but very few have 
been cooking on them. Some people volunteered to use a TLUD for cooking for a 
given time, like a month, and blog about the experience. More volunteers are 
needed to do this.</li> 
<li>Create awareness and knowledge about TLUDS.</li> 
<li>Paul Anderson committed to put a TLUD handbook on the web.</li> </ul> 
<p>Upcoming TLUD events include a Combined Heat and Biochar event in 
Massachusetts on 9-13 August (contact Paul Anderson for more details) and the 
annual Stove Camp at Aprovecho, 26 to 30 July. Dean Still, organizer of the 
Aprovecho Stove Camp has said the camp will focus on the TLUD this year.</p>

 Dean Still and Nordica 
MacCarty</p> 
<p>Forty three folks attended Stove Camp this year coming from as far away as 
Norway, Germany, Honduras, and Mexico. Some people were too busy making stoves 
to be in the official photo. Paal Wendelbo, winner of the $250 prize for most 
interesting development, is the white haired gentleman two spaces to 
Dean&rsquo;s left. The theme this year constellated around health issues. You 
can see the presentations and results from Stove Camp by visiting
http://www.aprovecho.org/lab/index.php.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Stoves Camp 2009 Group Photo</strong></p> 
<p>Stove Camp featured many experiments. We set up a Test Kitchen, in which 
stoves were tested, making posho (African corn meal mush). Particulate Matter 
and Carbon monoxide were recorded in both the room air and at the nose/mouth of 
the cook. We also used a RAD 57 from Masimo to non-invasively measure levels of 
CO in the cook&rsquo;s blood before and after cooking. Stoves were also tested 
under the emissions hood, and practice WBTs were run without emissions 
measurements. Peter Scott and Dr. Andreatta were successful in creating an 
aluminum mitad with even temperatures for making injira.</p>

<h2>Finned Pots as a Means of Increasing Efficiency</h2>

<p>Finned Pots as a Means of Increasing Efficiency Dale Andreatta, Ph.D., P.E.,
dandreatta@sealimited.com, February 13, 2009</p> <strong>Finned Pot</strong> 
<br> 
<p>Executive Summary A pot with heat transfer fins has much greater surface 
area than pots with no fins. In theory, this could lead to greatly increased 
heat transfer to the pot for a given stove, and the pot would theoretically 
improve the performance of the stove under all conditions. While we often 
concentrate on the stove as the primary element of a cooking system, the 
efficiency of a stove is mainly determined by the heat transfer to the pot, and 
designing a better pot would be an easy way to make a more efficient stove. A 
variety of types of finned pots were built and tested. The best designs were 
separated out in the lab, using natural gas to simulate a wood flame. Several 
types of fins can be retrofit to existing pots. The better designs of finned 
pots performed well over a range of conditions using simulated stoves, and 
sometimes also with an actual wood burning stove modified to use natural gas to 
simulate a wood flame. With fins on or near the bottom of the pot the finned 
pots typically gave around a 1.76-fold improvement in heat transfer. If the 
fins were on the sides of the pot a greater than 2-fold improvement was 
achieved. Tests on actual stoves using wood as the fuel generally gave smaller 
improvements in performance, generally 1.33 or less, corresponding to a 25% or 
smaller reduction in fuel usage. These tests were done under a variety of 
conditions with a variety of stoves, including the open fire (3-stone fire). On 
industrial fuel stoves using kerosene or alcohol, improvements were even less, 
with the finned pots giving 1.2 fold improvements or smaller. In some tests the 
finned pot used more fuel than an unfinned pot. The reasons for this wide range 
of results is not known. It is not recommended that finned pots be pursued as a 
means of increasing the efficiency of stoves. Better results can probably be 
achieved with less effort by using skirts around the pot. These skirts could be 
attached to the pots with optimum dimensions. See attached report presented to 
ETHOS 2009</p>

 Charlie Sellers, 
February 11,2009</p> <strong>Charlie Sellers and GEK</strong> <br>

<p>This was my third ETHOS (Engineers in Technical and Humanitarian 
Opportunities of Service &ndash; a long name for people who often just call 
themselves &ldquo;stovers&rdquo;), and the Seattle suburbs are as cold as usual 
at this time of year. ~100 researchers came from around the world to compare 
notes on stove projects, stove designs, standards and testing procedures, 
health impacts, other associated appropriate technologies, and so on. More 
apparent this year was interest in carbon credit funding and biochar (terra 
preta) applications, and all year long there has been an increased emphasis on 
refugee camp stoves (and more testing of stoves in the field, versus in the 
laboratory) so this was more apparent at the conference.</p> <strong>Nat Mulcahy
</strong> <br>

<p>There was a raft of new stoves introduced this year, including the new 
BioLight thermoelectric-powered-fan one for camping and more, the likewise fan 
powered Lucia Stove fromwww.worldstove.com (shown with developer Nate Mulcahy), 
</p> <strong>Crispin Pemberton-Piggott</strong> <br>

<p>and the souped up Peko Pe natural draft gasifier presented by Paul Anderson 
(pictured with Crispin Pemberton-Pigott, wielding his ever present combustion 
analyzer).</p> <strong>Rocketeers Larry Winiarski and Dean Still</strong> <br>

<p>The venerable Dr. Larry Winiarski and Dean Still are also shown here with 
the upcoming finned pot atop StoveTec&rsquo;s (www.stovetec.net) rocket stove - 
now 36,000 strong in the field just since last year.</p> 
<p>The trend toward stove models like all these, designed for mass 
manufacturing, continues, and this trend was recently discussed here:
coming-of-corporate-biomass-stoves-mass.html). And yours truly demonstrated in 
light snow the new biomass gasifier (the red one) from All Power Labs here in 
Berkeley (www.allpowerlabs.org). Look soon for Peter Scott&rsquo;s new rocket 
stove design and application website atrocketstove.org.<br>

<p>Notes from the ETHOS Conference of 2009,<br>
 by Paul S. Anderson, 4 
February 2009</p> 
<pre><code>I enjoyed (and benefited from) the 2009 ETHOS Conference more than 
in most previous years. ETHOS is growing and evolving, and so are our stoves. 
This year we seemed to have had more discussions of issues than in the past. 
There were topical &ldquo;panels&rdquo; of usually three or four qualified 
people. The topics of these plenary sessions were: Carbon Credits; Stove 
Testing Issues (not results of specific stoves); Safety; and Stove Standards. 
Those sessions still tended to be presentations, but there was somewhat more 
interaction and some effort to get to the underlying difficulties that need 
more discussion. Attendees still need to read-between-the-lines and/or have 
some more private discussions to see some of the differences of position.</code>
</pre> 
<p>The session Crispin and I led about controversial issues that need to be 
discussed was only moderately successful (in my opinion) because we spent our 
time identifying the issues and did not have time for discussions of those 
issues. Next year, we hope to have some of those topics PRE-identified and to 
have discussion time about those issues. I have volunteered to work on that, 
and Mark B. has accepted my offer. (More about this in some future messages.)
</p> 
<p>There were still about 30 somewhat standard (academic style) presentations, 
usually with PowerPoint slides. But they were in three concurrent sessions with 
30 minutes (too much in my opinion) allocated to each presenter (who usually 
did make sure to fill all of the minutes, often with background info that could 
have been omitted, in my opinion). So each attendee could only hear about 10 of 
them. I will comment on four of the nine that I was able to attend. There were 
certainly other excellent presentations, but I am not trying to summarize the 
entire conference.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> 
<p>Alan Berick did a masterful job of calling attention to simmering by the 
use of only charcoal, available from the fire that was used to bring the pot to 
boil. There were questions about the heat retained in a ceramic stove body, 
etc., and certainly he will do more work on this. But really he called 
attention to the need to have &ldquo;different&rdquo; heat sources for boiling 
and simmering. This is akin to the advocacy of retained heat cookers (RHC or 
&ldquo;hayboxes&rdquo;) for integrated cooking. We should all think more about 
having two or more modes or devices for different cooking (as in 
bringing-to-boiling vs. simmering vs. tea-for-two in the morning).</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>Jonathan Cedar and Alex Drummond discussed (and later showed) their 
&ldquo;BioLight&rdquo; cookstove that includes an attractive device attached to 
the side of the stove to use the heat of the fire to create the electricity 
(via a TEG = thermoelectric generator) to drive the blower to make the fire 
burn well. The theory and practice have been known for a long time, but they 
impressively accomplished it in their attractive prototype, a variation of a 
Reed-style Woodgas Campstove. Neither the stove body nor the TEG power units 
are available for purchase, but they should be encouraged to continue their 
work. [Side note: The TEG in the bottom of the innovative Philips cookstove 
(seen in previous years) has been removed and that stove is moving to the 
marketplace with battery or plug-in for the required electric power.]</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>I liked my own presentation about the low emissions of TLUD gasifiers, 
especially if the charcoal is NOT burned in the TLUD. This favorably relates 
both to Alan Berick&rsquo;s findings (above) and to the carbon credit and 
biochar sequestration topics. (Enough said. My paper is at the Stoves Internet 
site:http://www.bioenergylists.org/andersontludcopm I think that in future 
years we should have many papers placed there in advance of the conference.)</p>
</li> 
<li> 
<p>Nathaniel &ldquo;Nat&rdquo; Mulcahy attended ETHOS for the first time and 
(in my opinion) presented the most dramatic stove innovation I have seen since 
the day I met Tom Reed and his TLUD prototype. Nat presented about the Lucia 
Stove (and some info about the larger WorldStove). True science and engineering 
in action. His website is underdeveloped, but he has 13 YouTube items that will 
partially bring you up to speed. Visit:www.youtube.com/worldstove I will be 
writing more in another message about his &ldquo;coaxial gasification&rdquo; 
(vs. stratified gasification in TLUDs and most other small gasifiers). I spent 
some extra time with Nat and can say that he has deep understanding of the 
issues, and he has solutions already in place.</p> </li> </ol> 
<p>The &ldquo;Lighting of the Stoves&rdquo; was Sunday afternoon, with a light 
snowfall!! Five stoves were fired up.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> 
<p>The Rocket stove produced in China. Reliable, economical, and this one had 
a very nice pot-skirt that attached to the pot and let the emissions/draft out 
through (20 mm??) holes near the top of the skirt. Many people (including me) 
purchased one of those stoves (and would like to get the skirt). Contact 
Aprovecho to get your stove (under US$30, plus shipping).</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>The &ldquo;PP-Plus&rdquo; natural draft TLUD from Servals in Chennai, 
India. It uses the natural draft techniques combined by Paul Anderson and Paal 
Wendelbo. I will be posting within a few days a document on how to make a 
PP-Plus gasifier. (Wendelbo&rsquo;s extremely interesting life as a TLUD 
pioneer was highlighted at the Friday night slide-show and is at the Stoves 
Website:http://www.bioenergylists.org/wendelbopekope ).</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>The GEK downdraft gasifier. This is not a cookstove. It is a gasifier 
intended as a start-up kit for aspiring gasifier enthusiasts, including 
cleaning and cooling of the gases. This is for sale as a kit or as a set of 
plans for construction. About forty units are around the world.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>The Lucia Stove by Nat Mulcahy. Mentioned previously. The live-fire demo 
was impressive. The turbulence of the gases/flame and the air control provided 
a very clean combustion, measured by Crispin and his furnace-emissions analyzer.
</p> </li> 
<li> 
<p>The BioLight by Drummond and Cedar. Discussed previously. It performed very 
well, and was measured by Crispin to have very clean combustion slightly better 
than the other four stoves shown this year.</p> </li> </ol> 
<p>As someone mentioned, in previous years usually only one gasifier was among 
the stoves ignited. But this year four of the five were gasifiers, each 
distinctly different from the others.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;Crispin Awards&rdquo; were inaugurated this year. Crispin gave 
out three little bottles of &ldquo;Gold Medal&rdquo; Canadian pure maple syrup 
to stoves 3, 4, and 5 in the above list. The criteria were the emissions 
readings from his furnace emissions analysis equipment. The three winners did 
share one thing in common. All three were with force air, and even used true 
blowers, not just small fans.</p> 
<p>In summary, it was a beneficial conference. Another report on the meeting 
has been posted by Kelpie Wilson, with insights especially for the issues of 
biochar:<br>
