Refrigerators, Chambers Episode, Serelco Stoves</b> <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Volume X, &#145;HOT-Cha&#146; Issue 3 Highlights</strong></p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p>If you are a new or soon to be new member of The Old Appliance Club,<strong>
 Red Hot</strong> Issue #3 of our <i>Hot Cha Series</i> for 2004 will cement 
the fact that 2004 was a huge year for antique appliance interest, but by all 
measure 2005 has swamped everything! Since these last 10 years that TOAC was 
first founded, movie and sitcom set designers, producers of cooking shows and 
interior designers all are calling along with private owners for resources and 
experts and guidance.</p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>COCA-COLA Refrigerators</strong> </p> 
<p><b>Double Feature</b> </p> 
<p><b>Works Great</b>! &nbsp;plus&#133; </p> 
<p><b>Uncovering a New Species! </b></p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>CHAMBERS, &quot;A Work of Art&quot;</strong> </p> 
<p>  &nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>SERELCO</strong> Stoves</p> 
<p><strong>FLORENCE EMBASSY RANGES - </strong>For the first time we are 
carrying a full page ad from 1951 of the Florence Embassy range. Florence made 
gas, LP and electric ranges in quite a few configurations. It was just as large 
as the Wedgewoods, O'Keefe and Merrits and other good ranges of the day. If you 
own a Florence and have never seen any advertising on them here is a rare piece 
of stove history.</p> <br>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Mike Arnold's 'I Remember' - &quot;Number Please&quot; -</strong> 
Everyone loves going down memory lane and when you have Mike Arnold at the 
helm, you will always enjoy a great piece of history about old appliances. This 
time around Mike shares his memories about post war telephone service, party 
lines and when the operator personally vocalized the phrase - &quot;Number 
Please&quot;. Check out the old switch board and phone pictures too. It's a 
blast to the past you won't want to miss.</p> 
<p><strong>STILL ALIVE AND WELL -</strong> See a wonderful 1921 Gurney 
Electric Range. This is a very handsome and artfully crafted stove that any old 
stove lover will want to see. You will rarely see one like this anywhere. Next 
up is a gorgeously restored 1930s Universal with six burners, two ovens, 
broilers and upper warming oven from Colorado. This is the kind of eye candy 
that any old stove lover cannot resist drooling over. Crosley Electric stove 
owners usually feel left out as Crosley's are hard to find in good shape. Check 
out this early 50s Crosley in this issue. It really has survived in spectacular 
original condition.</p> 
<p><strong>COCA-COLA Inspiration Strikes Twice!</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&quot;WORKS GREAT!&quot; </strong></p> 
<p>That's the title of Shane Weissman's feature article. Shane is the proud 
owner of a sharp late 30s SPARK stove and a 40s Frigidaire refrigerator. The 
restoration and repair make a great story we are sure you will find very 
enjoyable. The equipment really came out like new.</p> 
<p><strong>&quot;UNCOVERING A NEW SPECIES&quot; </strong></p> 
<p>An exciting feature article on old refrigerators arrives in this issue from 
Ray Folsom and Don Simoneau. This time around they show and tell</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> &nbsp;
<p>a very rare Col-Temp refrigerator. These California Cooler men love their 
fridges. They restore them so well and so accurately you will think they just 
rolled off the assembly line.</p> 
<p><strong>CHAMBERS - &quot;A Work of ART&quot;</strong> &nbsp; - We love 
getting stories from the gals who have rescued antique stoves and we truly love 
getting feature articles that have a great<em><strong>twist </strong></em>to 
them. Here you have the best of both and even more. If you like Chambers 
stoves, you will want to see the complete kitchen design layout this lass did. 
Lydia Robertson tells her story in this issue of TORH and it is unlike any 
other we have ever carried. There is a great personal loss involved, but there 
is a great triumph as well. If you need to feel<em><strong>inspired</strong>
</em>, this is the story to read. </p> 
<p><strong>THE OLD, ODD AND UNUSUAL </strong></p> 
<p>New York City TOAC member Peter Mintun shares 2 wonderful old toaster 
articles and pictures we have never seen before. First the 1931 Toastermaster 
eight slice toaster and them the big Kahuna SAVORY RADIANT GAS TOASTER that can 
brown 1,440 slices an hour!<br>
 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt full size stove from the 
50s without a griddle? We've got it. Here is a picture of a stock factory 
O'K&amp;M without and grease tray or griddle!</p> 
<p><strong>A GROWING CROP </strong></p> 
<p><em><strong>Appliance detective </strong></em>Jim Apthorpe from Florida 
stops by with even more great finds he has just uncovered. Merit-Made Toaster 
model A, Westinghouse cat.No. TO-71 toaster, a canary yellow Sunbeam Model 12 
Mixmaster, the Vita-Mix 3600 blender and the very collectible Sunkist 
Commercial Juicer Type 6. This is just a small part of the ever increasing 
collection of Jim Apthorpe's antique appliances.</p> 
<p><strong>WHO DOESN'T LOVE CAKE AND A PRETTY COOK!</strong> One of the most 
mouth-watering cakes we have ever tasted to date was presented to us from one
</p> &nbsp;
<p>of our own models - Alana E'Dahlia. It's her Pastel Cuatro Leches (or, Four 
Milks Cake). It looks great and tastes even better. If you love cake as much as 
we do, you will surely want to make this for your next party. Sorry&#133;.Alana 
won't be able to deliver her cake personally except in this issue of The Old 
Road Home.</p>

<p>If you are a new or soon to be new member of The Old Appliance Club, Issue 
#2 of our Hot Cha Series for 2004 will 'clue you in' to all the fascinating 
fifties facts relating to the vintage appliance field.</p> 
<p><strong>Since &#147;Still Embracing the 50s &#150; Fifty Years Later&#148; 
was released,</strong>editors from newspapers and home magazines have contacted 
us to do more old appliance interviews this year. Their readers are thirsting 
to understand what is being collected, what can be restored, and the amount of 
antique appliances that are being bought and sold throughout the world. Yes, my 
dear friends, 2004 was a huge year for antique appliance interest, but by all 
measure 2005 has swamped everything these last 10 years since the TOAC was 
first founded and movie and sitcom set designers, producers of cooking shows 
and interior designers all are calling along with private owners for resources 
and experts and guidance.</p> <br>

SUNBEAM Retrofit and THE MOTHERLODE of Stoves and Refrigerators</b> <br>

<p><b>10th Anniversary Year Begins</b></p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;Volume X, Issue 1 </b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>SUNBEAM 1920&#146;s Gas/Electric Stove Retrofit &#150; </b>By far this 
is an article that will finally tell the tale of how to get the best of both 
fuels ~ gas and electric. Rick Sharpe, TOAC member from Alabama, will walk you 
through how he actually turned his 1920s Sunbeam gas stove into a combination 
stove. Now he has gas burners and an electric oven. If you have an oven with a 
thermostat that cannot be rebuilt, or if your older range never had a 
thermostat at all, you must see this range to see how Rick pulled off a 
perfectly clean restoration and retrofit that proves it can be done!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <b>NEW PRODUCTS AND BOOKS &#150;</b> The first release of the San Marin 
TS-7 Safety Valve; the first improvement in 50 years, the Western-Holly 1948

heavy-duty Chambers replacement legs. </p>

Pennsylvania. The panoramic centerfold showing hordes of great antique stoves 
and refrigerators resemble a very long train;<i><b>all of which</b></i> <i><b>
Chip personally saved from the crusher.</b></i> This was a monster of a job, 
but Chip reels out his story with<b><i> wit, fun and adventure</i></b> that

<p>&quot;A Tale of Panic, Excitement and Discovery!&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>A HOT NEW BEGINNING &#150; </b>Mike Arnold&#146;s <b><i>'I Remember' </i>
</b>feature is truly a story that few people today have any knowledge of. 
Directly after World War II there was a big push to complete the natural 
gas&nbsp;pipeline bringing a standardized vaporous fuel to the entire country. 
Also included in the article are wonderful pictures from a variety of sources 
featuring trucks delivering coal and coke as well cartoons showing how 
imconvenient it was to have ashes hauled away to the dump or into the ocean. A 
rare look into how we heated homes many decades ago.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>IRON FUN ON THE RUN &#150;</b> From <i><b>'The Apthorpe Files'</b></i>, 
Jim Apthorpe found something that we have never seen in 33 years in the old 
appliance business. A full suitcase that has a portable iron built right into 
the handle. Yes, it is electric, well made and positively unique. The asking 
price Jim later found out from the seller was $900.00!</p>

<b>&nbsp; Summer 2003 - The 'SIXTIES' - An Appliance R(E)volution
</b> <br>

<p><b></b></p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;Appliance Revolution Feature</b></p> 
<p>How the 'Sixties' refined appliances developments to</p> 
<p>ease our lives.</p> 
<p><b><i>A Sixties Issue for </i></b></p> 
<p><b>People in Love and at Peace with their 60s Stoves.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Volume IX, Issue 3</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The 60s</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>First Feature &#150;</b> <b>SIXTIES Appliance Field Trip &#150; </b>If 
you have never had the chance to see some of the advance design appliances from 
the 1960s, we have some of the first and best you can ever see. Brands like 
Revco, Marvel and even Gaffers Sattler with built in double wall ovens and 
in&nbsp; the counter appliances. ALL are original to the home and covered in 
chic stainless steel still in exceptional condition. The 1960s appliances 
started a significant change and now you can see where the evolution began.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Second Feature &#150;</b> <b>Mike Arnold&#146;s &#147;I Remember&#148;
</b> series brings back vivid memories of the 60s appliances when refrigerators 
&nbsp;and stoves started appearing with square corners, magnetic door closures 
and totally frost free systems.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There&#146;s a nice vintage cover shot of Admiral built-in appliances for 
the home as well as the Philco Frostless double door refrigerator/freezer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Third Feature &#150;</b> <b>PHILCO STOVES FOR 1964</b> &#150; See the 
Philco 1964 stove models with every sort of feature and color available. The 
famous Tilt-Top, the Quick-Chef and Galaxie electric range line with double 
ovens are fully displayed in this piece. A must see for all 60s Philco stove 
fans.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>HOTPOINT HALLMARK RANGE</b> &#150; 1963 &#150; Here is a full page ad of 
the then &#147;state of the art&#148; Hotpoint Hallmark Range. This is one heck 
of a stove with all the bells and whistles of the day. This was a significant 
design breakthrough that was truly a sight to behold.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>THE HOOVER SPIN DRYING WASHER</b> &#150; For small homes or apartments 
this washer/spin dryer was all the rage in the 1960s. Both light and efficient 
many people today are still big fans of this washer similar which can be 
likened to the little Crosley cars from many days gone by.</p> 
<p>We have all the info for you in this article including the color charts as 
well.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>STILL ALIVE AND WELL</b> &#150; What a line up of wonderful treats in 
this bi-fold bevy of vintage appliances. See an ancient GE Monitor Top clock, a 
50s O&#146;Keefe &amp; Merritt gas range with left side heater (northwestern 
edition), a 1930s Buck Rogers style Premier Vac-Kit with Anaconda type hose, a 
built in stainless steel G.E. drop in electric stove with built-in &nbsp;wall 
controls plus two slick chrome and white small appliances that look almost 
identical except the one is a hand mixer and the other an iron!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>GENERAL ELECTRIC TABLE TOP ROTISSERIE OVEN</b> &#150; Before the 
Showtime cooker, wonderful table top roasters like the Roto-Broil and the G.E. 
Rotisserie were available. It&#146;s a wild but sturdy looking unit that 
perhaps is still around in some kitchens today.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>KITCHEN-AID mixer COLLECTION</b> &#150; Part of the great collection of 
small older appliances from Jim Apthorpe of Leesburg, Florida. Displayed here 
is a lineage of the wonderful old time Kitchen-Aid mixers from the 3-A up to 
and including the 4-C models.</p> 
<p>Few people have ever seen the domestic style Kitchen-Aid from decades ago. 
They were both good looking and extremely rugged.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>STILL AMAZED BY EUREKA</b> &#150; Jack &#147;White Sox&#148; Corwin 
presents his 1922 Eureka sweeper that is still working today at his home in 
Orlando, Florida. Jack has been a long time fan of old appliances and this is 
one piece he has had for many years. There&#146;s a great picture of the 
original ad featuring old &#147;White Sox&#148; in a magazine ad too all from 
many, many years ago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Exciting ROPER Edition</b></p> 
<p><b>Covering 1948 and 1955 Models.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The last installment of our yearbook is just about crammed into the 
suitcase.</p> 
<p>Yes, it is another extended 40 page issue. </p> 
<p>Yes, it is filled with sensational old appliances, news, fun, services and 
pictures.</p> 
<p>And, yes this is the issue &nbsp;that all mid-century Roper owners will 
want to keep for years to come.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;ROPER RANGES -</p> 
<p>&nbsp;If you are a Roper fan that owns a range from the 40s or 50s this 
&nbsp;feature article is bigger and longer, and filled to the brim with 
information than any other stove piece to date. There &nbsp;are plenty of 
pictures of Ropers, details, history, specs, parts and even the 
&nbsp;advertising used way back 50-60 years ago. Ropers are coming back strong 
and are&nbsp;still a terrific investment. It is time to discover the 
magnificent Roper.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;IS A TREND ABOUT TO HAPPEN? &nbsp;Our core stove business that sells 
rebuilt operating &nbsp;systems (safety valves, thermostats, pilot assemblies, 
etc.) has witnessed a&nbsp;sharp rise on older Roper equipment. Is a trend 
about to happen??? Watch out for &nbsp;the<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp; big Town and Country Roper in the article too. You know the one. It 
has &nbsp;eight burners and multiple ovens and sort of looks like 3 &#150; 
20&#148; stoves welded &nbsp;together. Yes, it is definitely time to rub your 
chin Finn and take another look &nbsp;at Roper &#150; a company that started 
all the way back in the 1800s.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>BELT DRIVEN Refrigeration &#150;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Here is another fine article penned by none other &nbsp;than old 
appliance guru Mike Arnold of Twentieth Century of Troy, New York. Mike 
&nbsp;not only has wonderful facts on the belt drives (once the most popular of 
all units) but archive photo&#146;s of the 1935 GE belt drive, theNorge 
Rollarator unit &nbsp;and the model AW used in belt driven Frigidaire&nbsp; 
refrigerator models AP-18, AP12 &nbsp;and Multi-Cold Frigidaire&#146;s. A must 
see for all antique refrigeration buffs.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;LOTS OF NEW PICTURES OF OLD APPLIANCES &#150; </p> 
<p>Fresh from our members&#146; homes around &nbsp;the country we have 
pictures of the following for you: a fully restored late 1920&#146;s Hotpoint 
electric range, Universal Coffee Urn (1924), a HOOVER&nbsp; Iron &#150; model 
4001, fully chrome plated Sunbeam model 12C, 1949 Youngstown double sink 
&nbsp;cab/combo in perfect condition (remember them?), a strange steam iron set 
up &nbsp;with a huge plastic water tank and direct patch H20 line to the side 
of the iron for steam and last but not least, a most unusual one burner Nestle 
Hot Chocolate &nbsp;cooker for the winter time. Even Frosty the Snowman is on 
it. Sure makes me feel &nbsp;like having hot cocoa again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;You want one too? &nbsp;I think this contraption is from the early 
50s. It&#146;s so cute you'll want to &nbsp;pinch the page when you see it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>FROM NIGHTMARE TO DREAM STOVE &#150; Do we have any Oriole stove fans out 
there? If &nbsp;you want to see one of the finest restorations on an early 
range this is it. &nbsp;From a crumbling hunk of rusting metal, see this 
transformed 6 burner, double oven with warming closet reborn into a fully 
functional safe piece of kitchen art. This is truly a knock out!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;A MAJESTIC REFRIGERATOR - Model 150 was saved from the junkyard many 
years ago and<br>
 &nbsp;sat quietly waiting on a porch in Florida for someone 
to find it and restore it. This is the first leg of a journey that old 
appliance sleuth Jim Apthorpe conducted. This is one fine and absolutely unique 
looking 5 cu. ft. fridge. The &nbsp;second leg of the story was getting the 
fridge ready for a trip across the USA &nbsp;to California for restoration. The 
third leg upcoming in 2004 is the finished product from Paso Robles, CA. 
Revivals like this bring hope to all old appliance &nbsp;lovers. It can be 
done! Time and patience is the key.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;TOAST CATCHING CONTEST WINNER FROM NAPLES &#150; The Oldy-Coffee Shop 
from Switzerland sent in photo&#146;s of Carole, the blonde Toast-Catcher 
winner from Naples. &nbsp;Oldy-Coffee uses all older appliances for cooking in 
their shop and sponsors the Toast Catching Contest for fun. Their 1952 toaster 
shoots toast out like a &nbsp;cannon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you catch the toast, it&#146;s free. Pictures of the toasters, owners

<p>&nbsp;BRINGING THE OLD STOVE HOME &#150; A very sweet gal by the name of 
Reatha Thran from &nbsp;Nevada shares one of the nicest old stove stories you 
could ever read, pardners. &nbsp;When I received Reatha&#146;s letter, the 
first thing I thought was, &#147;The kitchen rangers have to know about 
this.&#148; After reluctantly giving up a one of a kind Wedgewood gas range, 
Reatha finally decided that this was one item she could not &nbsp;do without. 
She also has other old appliances and Grandma&#146;s Wedgewood all of which you 
will see in her article. The way she blends older equipment in a newer home is 
something that works like dew on morning grass. Check it out! I will not 
&nbsp;spoil the tale by snitching here, but this is the first time I have ever 
heard a stove story like this. You&#146;ll love it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>WHAT&#146;S WANTED? Did you know that an old appliance or part that you 
have sitting in your garage, house or shed could not only save someone 
else&#146;s unit but bring you money as well? To restore old appliances, parts 
or sometime entire units are desperately needed. Quite a few people pour over 
the classifieds in TORH for goods that are needed by others. If you are seeking 
to reduce the tonnage on your plot, check out the wanted column. Much is needed 
and hopefully you can supply it, make a few bucks and maybe even make a new old 
appliance friend!</p>

Oven Styles of 1955</b> <br>

<h1>The Old Road Home Quarterly </h1> 
<p><b>Spring 2003 </b>&#150; Ninth Year Anniversary Issue </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<h1>First Main Feature - <b>BUILT-INS AND OVEN STYLES OF 1955 </b>&#150; This 
is a true blast from the past. Normally you will see freestanding stoves in The 
Old Road Home. That goes without saying. However, a lot of our pals across the 
miles have built-in units. Classic built-ins are coming back and big! In this 
issue, you will see the newest and coolest features stoves had to show off 
nearly 50 years ago. Quite a few people have fond memories of these units. They 
were such a radical departure from the freestanding units. As time went on, 
some of the designs got pretty &#147;out there&#148;, but you have to remember 
that&#146;s part of the process of progress.<br>
 Features like rotisseries, 
swing out French style broiler doors, &quot;see-in&quot; glass oven doors, 
&#147;grilling clamps&#148;, lift-away oven doors, disposable oven liners, 
roast-meter ovens, double side by side built-ins with ovens up to 24&#148; wide 
were<i>text book</i> built-in features. </h1> 
<p>Colors offered in enamel were rainbow-like. There&#146;s even an antique 
copper Chambers displayed, which although was a freestanding stove, still adds 
to the sassy blend of equipment and finishes available. Again, many of these 
units are still around today with the demand definitely increasing. In the past 
15 months we have&nbsp; noticed that orders for supplies, rebuilt original 
thermostats, elements and safety systems for classic built-ins&nbsp; have 
greatly increased. TIP: If you think you are in the market for a older 
built-in, make sure all the parts are there and check for damage. Some models 
could have very low original parts availability.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Second Feature &#150; HOW TO MAKE A WATER HEATER LAST OVER 60 YEARS !</b>
<br> For almost a decade The Old Road Home has displayed just about every type 
of&nbsp; antique appliance one can imagine. Let&#146;s face it pardners, we all 
have our favorites, but one thing everyone would like to know is how to</p> 
<p>make the appliance&nbsp;last as long as it can!</p> 
<p>This year we have had more people than ever before joining The Old 
Appliance Club; everyone wants to see, learn about or share their old appliance 
experience. And thanks to wonderful members like&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Handywoman</b> Laura Wolf in Michigan, we became aware of one heck of a 
<i>brilliant</i> guy &#150; Dr. Bruce Graves. Bruce is a PHD Consultant in 
Physical Electro-Chemistry. Like the rest of us, Bruce likes to save money! If 
you have ever had water heater problems, you will not want to miss this 
article. You won&#146;t believe how he cured his tired out, leaky water heater 
so it can last, last, last. Dr. Bruce has paved the way for you to outsmart the 
old water heater and be able to say to it &#147;Ah HA&#148; once and for all. 
This should keep your heater going for decades.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>THE OLD, THE ODD AND THE UNUSUAL &#150; &#147;Calling all Monitor Top 
refrigerator fans!&#148; The summer can be hot, but years ago without air 
conditioning it was downright brutal. Way back&nbsp;</p> 
<p>in 1928, a New York doctor utilized an experimental water chiller designed 
by Frank Faust of General Electric.<b>You will see an incredibly rare picture 
of 6 Monitor Top household refrigeration units suspended in a basement water 
tank with all sorts of gizmo&#146;s, blowers etc. to cool the offices above, 
way down.</b> <br>
 Bernard Nagengast, TOAC member and expert refrigeration 
historian shares this one of a kind photo with our tribe. Bern never ceases to 
amaze us when it comes to the history of refrigeration. He shares so many rare 
pictures and stories with TOAC, and this picture is a blockbuster!</p> 
<p><b>I REMEMBER THE GRUNOW, Part II</b> &#150; In the last issue of The Old 
Road Home, there were 2 feature articles on the Grunow refrigerator. Not having 
enough room for all the Grunow goodies, this time around more photos were 
shared by TOAC members Bernie Nagengast and Mike Arnold.</p> 
<p>Carrene was the refrigerant used in the Grunow refrigerator and it was 
thought to be absolutely SAFE! That was until the EPA found what it could 
really do to humans! The publicity photos showing a &#147;taste test&#148; (God 
forbid) and more. Mike Arnold via Jim Stulga sent in the photo of the huge 
William C. Grunow Mausoleum nestled just above the Des Plaines River. So much 
of the background on old companies and inventors disappears over the years. 
Thanks to people like Mike and Bern we are able to show you what it was like 
when the products were new!<br>
<b>THE GENERAL ELECTRIC PRODUCT HIT PARADE FOR 
1932</b>&#150; Thanks once again to Mike Arnold for sending a potpourri of G.E. 
appliance pictures for your eyes to behold. Here you will see 1930s products 
like genuine General Electric Mazda light bulbs, the G.E. sewing machine, the 
semi automatic single slice side dispensing toaster, the &#147;dog-bone&#148; 
handle iron, G.E. Washing machine, and the fabulous General Electric</p> 
<p>cooking range for 1932. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>STILL ALIVE AND WELL &#150; A brace of pages loaded with more pictures sent 
to us from all of you old appliance lovers across America. Early single slice 
Toastmaster Toaster trio, the all copper Universal &#147;coffeematic&#148; 
coffee maker, 1950s Westinghouse Frost-Free fridge, a suit-sharpe 30s electric 
range and a ancient Quick Meal gas range still cooking up a storm in the town 
of St. Louie where it was born.</p>

<p>can see what is going on coast to coast so hopefully it will inspire you to 
do the same. We were thrilled to get a lovely pack of pictures and a terrific 
story from TOAC members Tammy Scitar and Joe Gentile on what they have been up 
to. Some of the appliances they own are a<b>Ritz Black Angus Electric Barbecue
</b> from the 50s, a Chambers B&nbsp;</p> 
<p>model, a 1948 Dixie gas range, 2 G.E. refrig&#146;s from the 40s and 50s, 
toasters, classic metal kitchen cabinets and more!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Find out their secret on&nbsp; how they get their kitchen goodies. The

<b>&nbsp;Winter 2003 - The GRUNOW 
REFRIGERATOR</b> <br>

<h1><b>Double Feature of &#133; The GRUNOW REFRIGERATOR </b></h1> 
<p><b>&nbsp; </b></p> 
<p><b>I Remember the Grunow &#150; Part I&nbsp; <i>by Mike Arnold</i></b><i> 
</i></p> 
<p>Ace vintage refrigeration expert Mike Arnold steps into the spotlight to 
deliver a super-tight history on the Grunow refrigerator. </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>The rare Grunow fridge, which used the unusual refrigerant 
&#147;Carrene&#148; was in production from 1933-1937. Mike shares history, 
pictures, a chart full of technical information and his point of view on why 
this elder cooler should not be scrapped.<i>The good news</i> is that it can be 
revamped for modern use. </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>If the name Grunow sounds familiar, it may be because the company was well 
known for the finely engineered radios manufactured within quality furniture 
cabinets. </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>THERE&#146;S A GRUNOW IN THEM THAR HILLS</b> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;If you like search, salvage and restoration adventures, wait until 
you read about the antique Grunow refrigerator Ray and Don from Paso Robles, 
California saved! The fridge was found sinking in mud inside a dilapidated 
shed. Their restoration pictures and tale are amazing. Included is a full page 
vintage ad on the Grunow entitled, &#147;What&#146;s Inside The Coils&#148;.

inch Philco gas range, a handsome 1939 Frigidaire electric fridge and a stout 
G.E. Monitor Top that are in need of a new home. Maybe it could be sitting in 
your kitchen soon? </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>THE APTHORPE FILES</b> <b>&#150;</b> Old appliance sleuth Jim Apthorpe 
from Florida uncovers an AMAZING TOASTMASTER TOASTER. This 1930 model is an all 
cast aluminum 4-slice model with mica windows. It slurps down a whopping 2,750 
watts of power too! Original advertising on this model and other Toastmaster 
Toasters (including the 3, 4 and 8 slice models) are featured. </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>POSTWAR APPLIANCE ASSEMBLY LINE</b> &#150; Mike Arnold sent us this 1945

<b>&nbsp; Winter 2002 - The 
Phabulous PHILCO Refrigerator</b> <br>

<p><i>Extended Issue</i></p> 
<p>THE OLD ROAD HOME </p> 
<p><b>Winter 2002</b></p> 
<h1>This Quarters Super-Feature&nbsp;</h1> 
<h1><b>PHILCO Advanced Design Refrigerators</b></h1> 
<p>&nbsp;If you own a classic range, usually the next major appliance you will 
be in the market for is a vintage refrigerator.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>See one of the sharpest looking refrigerators ever to be constructed, the 
Philco Advanced Design refrigerator.</p> 
<p>The Philco had the wonderful cathedral-style corners and highly plated 
hardware that gave it a look all of its own. Perhaps you may even be lucky 
enough to find one today for your mid-century retro-kitchen!&nbsp; </p> 
<p>The space-saving construction, super-power and unique automatic defrost 
system were just a few of the reasons this classic cooler became so popular. 
You will enjoy this article without a doubt.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As we put this article together several members of The Old Appliance Club 
sent in items which we just had to include into the mix including a vintage 
Philco radio, a matching Philco electric range in&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>white porcelain and chrome and even a can of Philco polish from the 50s 
that was available from dealers to keep all Philco products sparkling and 
shining! &nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>SECOND PHILCO FEATURE &#150; &#147;Phabulous Philco&#148;</b></p> 
<p>Many of our old appliance friends across the miles contact us to display 
some of the classics they use in their kitchens. Todd Miller from San Luis 
Obispo, California sent in some wonderful pictures of his kitchen -&nbsp; 
loaded to the teeth with terrific looking vintage appliances. Besides his 50s 
Sunbeam toaster and Westinghouse &#147;Twin&#148; washer and dryer, the pride 
and joy refrigerator in his kitchen is a Philco. Todd started with a $150.00 
&#147;second-hand&#148; store refrigerator. When he finished disassembling, 
painting and even changing the door opening rotation you will see a 
masterpiece! He even located the ice cube trays and as mentioned previously, the
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Philco radio to perch on top of the fine fridge. If you want to be 
inspired, this is the refrigerator you should see. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>VINTAGE VACUUMS &#150;</b> More and more these days we are seeing folks 
collecting and using vintage vacuums. Our old friend from Leesburg, Florida, 
Jim Apthorpe, recently came across a stunning example. It&#146;s a 1956 
Kenmore; coral in color with aluminum trim. It almost looks like something you 
would pull around the golf course and yet it&#146;s a vacuum! In the article we 
were lucky enough to include a full blowup</p> 
<p>diagram of the parts too. Vac lovers, this one is in super condition and 
you are sure to enjoy the nice tight design of the unit. Jim says it works 
great too!</p> 
<p><b>QUICK MEAL RANGES - </b>We have featured hundreds of stoves in The Old 
Road Home over the years. Many of which have belonged to the American Stove 
Dynasty. In winter 2002 you will see the brand name that kicked it all off 
&#150;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>the Quick Meal.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We have selected over one dozen Quick Meals stove so you can see a complete 
cross-section from the smallest to the LARGEST units ever constructed in 1928. 
All factory numbers, weights, measurements and model names are included. You 
cannot help but wonder why no company today can make such an outstanding and 
attractive range. Wait until you see the 2,040-pound Quick Meal model #983-3!
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<b>VENTING A STOVE &#150;</b> If you have questions on how to vent a 
classic range in your kitchen we have reproduced a feature on the topic that 
will show you step by step exactly how to do so. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>STILL ALIVE AND WELL &#150;</b> A TRIPLE-DOOR 1950s REFRIGERATOR WITH 
ELLIPTICAL GLASS DOOR INSERTS? Yes, we have it and don&#146;t you dare miss it!

<p><b>MAGIC CHEF 1000 Series&nbsp;</b>The 1930s Magic Chef 1000 series was 
originally developed and targeted for use in larger homes and mansions across 
America. Boasting a fully enameled surface, 6 burners, warming closet and 
double ovens, this stove has gone on to take its rightful place as one all time 
favorites in the gas range hall of fame.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you ever take a tour of the Magic Chef House in St. Louis, this is the 
very range you will find in the kitchen today.&nbsp; Join us to enjoy all the 
models, dimensions, color combinations and features. This is the first time the 
style-sheets have been published in 65 years!</p> 
<p><b>Toast-O-Lator toaster</b> lovers! If you are fascinated by old time 
toasters, this time around we are presenting how the famous<b><i>Toast-O-Lator 
toaster</i></b> works. See a complete cut-a-way of this novel conveyor-belt 
type toaster. Find out exactly what cooking process goes on as bread enters on 
one side of the toaster tunnel, then a short time later arrives fully browned 
and crisp on the other end. If you have ever wondered what goes on inside this 
slab-sided chrome toaster you will definitely enjoy this feature.</p> 
<p><b>Coffee COOKERS</b>, <b><i>Coffee, Coffee, Coffee &#150;</i></b> 
&nbsp;Everyone that enjoys coffee normally has their own favorite brewing pot. 
California television producer, Brad Harlan, has<i>many</i> of them. Since the 
time he was just a tyke, Brad&#146;s parents,<i>true lovers&nbsp;</i> </p> 
<p><i>of a great cuppa</i>, must have inspired him to start his coffee-maker 
collection that he admits he is so afflicted with today. Brad shows many 
terrific styles and a wonderful story about coffee we guarantee you won&#146;t 
soon forget. You'd better have<i>your </i>cuppa&#146; sitting close by to sip 
along as you enjoy.</p> 
<p><b>Magic Chef Feature </b>Double Bonus<b> &#150;</b> &nbsp;The Magic Chef 
6300. One of the most inspiring stories that we have received to date is from 
Geoff Williamson. Geoff searched for and eventually found the stove of his 
dreams - a<b>Magic Chef 6300 eight-burner gas stove.</b> (This range is 
considered by many to be the Hope Diamond of the vintage stove group from the 
1930s.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Follow Geoff on his own personal quest half way across America in locating, 
transporting and beautifully restoring the elusive 6300. (<i>The 6300 is the 
big eight burner with multiple ovens, broiler, warming closet and full chrome 
trim</i>.) Every old stove lover hunting for their own dream range should not 
miss this inspiring article. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Vintage Vacuums -</b> Do you marvel over vintage vacuums? We have a real 
treat for you.<b>The Rexair Cleaner </b>developed all the way back in the 1930s 
used no dust bag at all, yet it trapped dirt and dust like no other cleaner 
using just water! Read all about it in the fall issue of The Old Road Home.

<p><b>STILL ALIVE AND WELL</b> <b>&#150;</b> Wait until you see the <b>
Hardwick Challenger gas stove</b> that was rescued from a Memphis junkyard and 
refurbished! Looks like a &#147;paired-down&#148; version of an O&#146;Keefe 
&amp; Merritt Aristocrat. We even have the original magazine ad that introduced 
it to the public way back in the 1940s! Notice the oven door glass. It 
mysteriously doubled as a mirror too.&nbsp;Look for other goodies too like the 
unusual Stewart Warner refrigerator. Yes, this was the company that made 
gauges&#133;but, appliances too. See a rare Hotpoint RA-57 electric range with

<b>&nbsp; Summer 2001 Issue 
Featuring - The Crosley ICY BALL</b> <br>

<p></p> 
<p><i>Extended Issue</i></p> 
<p><b>The Crosley ICY BALL&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>THE OLD ROAD HOME, Summer 2001 </b>issue also features the most popular 
models of vintage&nbsp;<b>1950s</b> <b>O'Keefe &amp; Merritt </b>ranges along 
with their correct factory model numbers. Included in the article are the 
original prices of several of their biggest selling models. O'Keefe &amp; 
Merritt fans are in for a fabulous fifties treat.<br>
<b>Crosley ICY BALL - </b>
Here is one of the most delightful stories on vintage refrigerators. People who 
lived in the country sorely missed having refrigeration due to lack of 
electricity and gas service. No need to worry - you'll read how Powell Crosley 
brought his famous ICY BALL to rural homes and solved the dilemma. As Bernard 
Nagengast, refrigeration historian, wrote, &#147;People who lived in the 
country may not have had electric refrigerators, but they sure did have Icy 
Balls.&#148; </p> 
<p><b>STILL ALIVE AND WELL</b> PHOTO GALLERY - We never seem to run out of 
grin-making old appliance pictures and this&nbsp;<i><br>
</i></p> 
<p>issue certainly proves it. Look for Norm&nbsp;Howe's beautiful ca.1935 
Wards &quot;GLORY&quot; coal and wood range with upper warming ovens, a lovely 
large Chicago Metallic Electric Coffee Urn ca.1940 that is said to make a 
wonderful &quot;cuppa&quot; even though it is 60 plus years old. We especially 
like the &quot;built like a bridge&quot; circular, double-bay. See the <b>TOAST 
MASTER WAFFLE IRON</b> ca.1940. You just cannot find anything that looks like 
this or the urn these days. And, there is a 4 slice TOASTMASTER TOASTER, of the 
same vintage, that has to make some of the most mouth-watering crunchy toast 
anywhere. &nbsp;For our refrigerator fans we have a 2-door mid-1930s 
refrigerator that is not only all porcelain but has blind-embossed doors. It is 
gorgeous.Last but not least, we have a six burner (with griddle) O'Keefe &amp; 
Merritt gas stove from the 1930s that was shipped new to Brazil and spent 6 
decades there before returning to California for a complete restoration. A rare 
model indeed, black and white in color, blind embossed panels, dripping in 
chrome trim and rare extras. </p> 
<p><b>The OLD, The ODD, The UNUSUAL - </b>One of the strangest heating devices 
of all time is the G.E. Electric Luminous Heater ca.1915. Three huge 
bologna-shaped light bulbs affixed in an ornately detailed floor style cabinet. 
Few have heard of this unit and less have ever seen one in A-1 condition. Also 
keeping things toasty on cold nights is the ca.1940 Coleman Kerosene Heater 
made&nbsp; </p> 
<p>in Canada. It almost resembles a radio in some aspects, but its job was to 
keep its owners warm on chilly eves. In the same display is&nbsp;yet another 
Coleman heater from the same period that was a heater with a full team of 
radiants inside along with stylish grillework only comparable to the automotive 
industry of that period. Last but not least, if you think Hoover only made 
cleaners we have a big surprise for you.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Michael Sheafe, owner of TOASTER CENTRAL and member of The Old Appliance 
Club stops by to deliver<b>'THE MAN BEHIND THE TOASTOY&#146;</b>. If you like 
toasters you will surely love this fascinating story. There is a 
&quot;twist&quot; to it that you will find astounding. Don't miss the excellent 
photos of the Excel Deluxe Whistle-T-Ket-L and the Exel Corn Popper, too. When 
you see the condition of these old timers you won't believe it.<br>

<p><i><b>** BENDIX Feature Addendum. </b>Ed. note:</i> &nbsp; <i>The following 
is a letter from John Eichinger who wrote the Feature Bendix Article for Summer 
1998 Back Issue titled &quot;The Lost Bendix&quot; with super pictures and 
text...don't miss it Bendix fans. We wanted to share what happened&#133;</i></p>
<p>Jack,  I called Gabriel Ride Control a few years ago searching for shock 
absorbers for the Duomatics. The orignal shocks were as old as the machines and 
were somewhat worn. As you can guess they were no longer available.I tried to 
locate some for years with no success. Then I decided to write Leon Viars, 
president of Gabriel Ride Control. Two weeks later I was surprised I received a 
call from his secretary, Joann Nunec. Apparently everyone there was so 
impressed by the restoration photos I sent in,  Leon  gave the word to call me 
and let me know they were going to help out!</p> 
<p>  They showed all of the information to one of their engineers, Sirnath 
Nandyall. He chuckled, &#147;I designed these shocks for Bendix!&#148;<b>What 
Luck</b>to find the man that designed these shocks over 40 years ago, <i> still 
</i>working at Gabriel. I sent him an original shock and in about two weeks he 
sent back ten brand new shiney shocks. I am so happpy to have them as they are 
as important as the motor itself. Without them the machines would be worthless! 
Gabriel Ride Control went out of the way to help me.A <i><b>special thanks</b> 
</i>goes to Sirnath Nandyall, Designer for Bendix. </p>
