Replacing Your Stove and Range<br>

<h1>Replacing Your Stove and Range</h1> 
<p><i>by Lee Wyatt</i> (last updated March 24, 2009)</p> <br>

<p>Whether you are completely remodeling your kitchen, or you are simply 
looking to replace an old and worn out unit, one of the most difficult 
dilemma's that face a home owner is deciding on which of the many possible 
models they should use for the cooking needs. Considering the sheer numbers of 
differing models contained within just one brand name, it is truly mind 
boggling when you stop and think about the number of different brands there 
are, well...is it really that surprising that so many people fear the idea of 
going out and trying to purchase a new stove?</p> 
<p>Luckily, this isn't as difficult of a thing as many people would think. 
There are only a few things that a person needs to keep in mind as they go 
through the homework process that is a necessary part of choosing your next 
cooking center. Here are some simple guidelines that you should keep in mind as 
you are going through that process, and to help you be able to pick out the 
range that is absolutely perfect for your needs.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Type.</b> One of the very first things that a consumer needs to 
consider is what type of unit you are going to purchase. There are roughly 
three kids of units that a person can purchase, such unites are gas, electric 
or a combination of these two. Even with these three main groups, there are 
other permutations for these as well when you take into account those units 
which have ovens as well. When deciding on what type of unit you may want, be 
sure to keep in mind that gas units are usually better for cooking delicate 
meals simply because they have better temperature control, while the electric 
units are more easily cleaned, at least the newer flat top models,</li> 
<li><b>Features.</b> There are almost a limitless number of different types of 
features that you can have on your new stove. Automatic timers, temperature 
control, multiple burner rings for gas units, integrated ovens, as you can see, 
the list goes on and on. Take careful stock of what your cooking needs are 
going to be, the amount of money that you are able to spend and where the two 
are going to be able to meet.</li> 
<li><b>Reviews.</b> Prior to making your final decision, take a look at the 
different consumer magazines and websites and take a look at what the reviews 
of the units you are interested in are. One of the best possible sources of 
reviews would be appliance repairmen or even the salesmen at your local Home 
Depot or Lowe's stores. Personally, I would suggest that you compare the 
information gained from all these possible resources, and make your decision 
based off of what they tell you.</li> 
<li><b>Color and Size.</b> Finally, after you have made your decision as to 
the brand and the model, all that is left is to choose the size and color of 
the model that you have chosen. Be sure that you choose one that is going to 
fit into the area you have set aside for your stove, as well as choosing one 
that is going to match the rest of the decor of your kitchen.</li> </ul> &nbsp;
