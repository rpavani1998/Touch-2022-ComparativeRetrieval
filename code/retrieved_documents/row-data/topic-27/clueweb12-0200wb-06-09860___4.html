Hi, Just to let you know that our fire is in, working and could not be better. 
Your advice and superb customer service is the best I have ever received both 
before and after the sale. To find a company who take the time and trouble to 
give such service to their customers as yours is hard to find. It has been a 
pleasure to have dealt with you. I will certainly be recommending your company 
to all my friends and relatives.</em> <br>
