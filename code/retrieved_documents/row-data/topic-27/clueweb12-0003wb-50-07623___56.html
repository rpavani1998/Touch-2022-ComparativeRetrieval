<h1>Bicycle Camping and Touring</h1> 
<h3>What Is Camping?</h3> 
<p> My first task is to deal with terminology problems. A &quot;camper&quot; 
could refer to someone traveling in a forty-foot motorhome towing a forty-foot 
boat and a car. And &quot;camping&quot; could refer to the daily or weekly task 
of squeezing such a motorhome in among a couple of hundred similar motorhomes 
that are jammed closer together now than they were in the salesman's lot. The 
fellow driving such a vehicle could be called a &quot;tourist&quot; and his 
trip a &quot;tour.&quot; When he gets back home, he'll have pictures of himself 
on top of high passes and in various beautiful natural area and parks. Somehow, 
he sees his trip as being the same as mine; in his opinion, he just was able to 
do it an easier and a better way.</p>
<p>Even a term like &quot;bicycle touring&quot; is much too broad. It is often 
used to describe short day rides. Or it can mean spending every night in a 
motel and eating every meal in a restaurant, which has sometimes been called 
credit card touring. Or it sometimes means traveling with in a group with a sag 
wagon or alone with a spouse in a car, so that no equipment has to be carried. 
The expression &quot;loaded touring&quot; also exists, but it is a very unclear 
moniker, generally used by those who feel they are traveling light; it's 
unclear because it provides no explanation for the load nor how much of a load 
is involved.</p>
<p>Even when I encounter the term &quot;bicycle camping,&quot; I still am 
quite uncertain: Are the &quot;campers&quot; actually carrying anything? Or are 
they traveling with a sag wagon? Are they spending the night (camping) in a 
building? In a motorhome village? In a public camping area? Where? Are they 
cooking anything? It's amazing to me how many cyclists who have written about 
their trips are unclear about how or where they spent the night; it's almost as 
if their night really wasn't part of the trip. I have even caught the idea in a 
cycling publication that having to pitch a tent is sort of a shameful and 
desperate act (the article actually suggested that the camper might sleep in a 
culvert!), and that persuading a stranger to share the home (perhaps even the 
bed?) is the sign of a true bike traveler.</p>
<p>The point in asking these questions is to be clear, not to put people down 
(well, maybe the guy in the motorhome) but because the one kind of touring is 
as different from the other as daylight is from dark.</p>
<p>As a result of this confusion in terms, it becomes difficult to explain to 
others what I do. If I say I camp, they probably see me nestled among the 
motorhomes. I had that experience on my first trip to the Smokies in 1965: I 
had only a tarp for a tent, but it was illegal for me to find my own spot in 
the national park; the park rangers could offer only a small treeless area 
jammed with people, vehicles, and TV sets for me to camp in. Some terms have 
been coined to describe what I do. It's been called low-impact camping and 
primitive camping for instance. But I just stick to saying that I camp in the 
woods. Of course, camping alone in the woods requires me to be a little more 
self-reliant and knowledgeable and to carry more equipment, especially more 
water.</p>
<h3>Practical Problems with Loaded Touring</h3> 
<p>Besides the terminology, there are some very practical problems involved. 
For instance, I have met touring cyclists who were carrying the same amount of 
weight I was, yet were spending their nights in motels. Why carry the extra 
weight if it's not needed? On my 1996 trip, I met two touring cyclists, 
carrying plenty of gear, who were bothered at learning I was camping in the 
woods, even though we were surrounded by national forests. So, therefore, they 
were ignoring the surrounding natural areas for what I considered to be 
unpleasant campgrounds or motels.&nbsp; If the only places where I could stop 
on a tour were campgrounds and motels, I would choose the motel as a better 
value and therefore also carry less equipment.&nbsp; With less time tied up in 
cooking and camping and less weight to carry, I'm sure I would travel enough 
extra miles each day to make $25 motels cheaper than $15 campgrounds, 
especially if I could include a few $10 hostels in the trip.</p>
<p>I think at least some cyclists might be carrying all that gear as an act of 
desperation. It's as if they are say, &quot;We don't intend to sleep out for 
the night; we'd rather beg, borrow, or steal a bed for the night, but if we 
have to, we need to be prepared.&quot; Perhaps they see camping as an 
anti-social or unenvironmental act. But camping for the night neither harms 
society nor disrupts the habitat of animals. The places that are suitable for 
me to camp have no food resources and are not sleeping areas for wildlife, 
although I may be blocking some deer's usual path.</p>
<h3>The True Delight of the Trip</h3> 
<p>And these people are missing out on the true delight of the trip. Riding 
through beautiful forests and not pitching a tent is like going with friends to 
a gourmet restaurant and watching them eat, without sharing any of the food.</p>
<p> </p>  Wild Camping <br>
<br>

<p> From my very first tour, I have been another kind of traveler, one who is 
as independent of public facilities as I am of the gas pump. I don't camp back 
in the woods because I'm poor, because I can't make friends with people, or 
because I can't reach my destination. I camp because it's the greatest 
experience on earth. I don't camp out to travel nearly as much as I travel to 
camp out. I remember one song that I sang with feeling while on my bicycle 
trips over thirty years ago:</p> 
<ul> I don't care when the sun goes down <br>
Where I lay my weary head. <br>

Green, green valley or rocky road;<br>
It's there I'm gonna make my bed. </ul> A
nd another one:
<ul> Under a willow, there we will rest, <br>
Watching the fading light. <br>

Earth for a pillow, dreams that are blessed,<br>
Darkness enfolding the night. 
</ul> 
<h3>Our Estrangement from Nature</h3> People are growing up so far from Nature 
and the outdoors that they no longer have any sense of what such a natural 
experience such as camping must be like. They somehow picture my camping as 
being a pure act of desperation -- the madman who can't live among people; 
However, I am not a recluse or a law-breaker. I think the nine-to-five crowd 
are the ones with poor human contact and poor understanding of our natural 
world.
<h3>The Difference between Camping Equipment and Camping</h3> 
<p>It bothers me that when I read a book on bike touring that the authors have 
said nothing whatsoever about the act of camping. Oh yes, they might have a 
very good chapter on how to pick camping equipment. But there is as much 
difference between camping equipment and camping as there is between a rifle 
and hunting. Therefore, I'm going to explain the mysteries of the act and art 
of camping. Excuse the shaggy dog story that follows, but it provides a 
camper's view of life.</p>
<h3>How I Began Camping</h3> 
<p>To go back to the very beginning, I began acquiring my camping skills as a 
boy. I was very fortunately to live next to woods full of creeks, cliffs, and 
sandstone &quot;caves.&quot; We kids first started camping in back yards and 
then in the local woods. We also cooked our own meals; indeed, one camping trip 
with my best friend ended early when we had cooked and eaten everything we had 
and were &quot;starving&quot; long before dinner time. We used every method to 
cook. On that trip, we had hung pork chops from strings above the fire. 
Shishkabob was also very popular, usually using a coat hanger with the paint 
burned off and pieces of meat, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and cheese skewered 
on. I also used a &quot;buddy burner,&quot; the stove top being a #10 tin can, 
the uncut top up, with three triangular vents punched right underneath and with 
a door cut in the bottom, and the burner being a tuna can with a coil of thick 
cardboard for the wick with wax melted between. Because we had no camping 
equipment, we would spend the night in natural rock shelters, using whatever 
blankets we could convince our parents to let us take. In my case, it was some 
old wool blankets that I used later to camp in caves and on my first bike trip 
to Canada.</p>
<h3>College Camping vs. College Football</h3> 
<p>In college, I would spend the whole weekend camping in the woods while the 
other students went to football games. They thought I was strange; I thought 
they were strange. I went to a football game once: first, there is the terrible 
traffic jam that eventually turns itself into a mass of humanity; second, there 
are the painful seats; third, there is horrible weather, usually both cold and 
raining; fourth, there's an overwhelming noise; fifth, there are some tiny 
people doing something on the field that you can't see; and finally, when you 
think something is about to happen and want to see and hear, everyone stands on 
the seats and yells like crazy. I must admit that I have read some other 
people's descriptions of their camping trips that sounded just as bad, but my 
own trips have never been miserable experiences.</p>
<h3>Camping near Jacksonville, AL</h3> 
<p>Just three miles from the school was a valley surrounded by high ridges 
that was never visited, as far as I could tell, by anyone but me. From there, I 
had miles of hiking, all the camping sites that I wanted, streams of pure water 
to drink, rocky vistas overlooking isolated valleys, and all the peace and 
solitude that anyone could wish. To make camping possible, I bought a simple 
plastic tarp as my only special equipment. To make a backpack, I put my spare 
clothes, food, and gear onto the tarp, I tied the tarp into a square bundle, 
and I tied a spare pair of blue jeans to the bundle, so I could use its legs 
for arm straps. Thus I had a comfortable backpack.</p>
<h3>Ground Preparation for the Tent</h3> 
<p>Because I was not used to using a tent, on the first night I slept under my 
tarp, I followed the advice in books on camping and dug up the ground that I 
slept on and dug trenches around it. Much later, I learned that trenches are 
considered destructive, but I learned in one night that digging of any kind is 
counterproductive. If you have ever camped in a campground, you know that the 
ground there has been packed harder than a brick. However, the natural soil in 
the woods has never been packed and is naturally soft. Digging, on the other 
hand, breaks up its structure, causing the soil to quickly pack down under your 
weight during the night. In addition, removing or adding leaves or pine straw 
is also a mistake. They serve as natural cushions only when undisturbed. Even 
removing rocks creates problems. The hole left after the rock is removed is 
very likely to create as much discomfort as the rock would have done. 
Therefore, before pitching my tent, I learned to remove only loose stuff lying 
on top of the ground such as branches, nuts, and pine cones. I solve the 
problem of half-buried rocks by laying on the ground before pitching the tent, 
to make sure I have no rocks under me. I dig no trenches because they only 
destroy the natural ability of the ground to absorb water. Only an extremely 
heavy rainfall will cause water to stand on the ground anyway, and then only on 
very flat ground. I also am very reluctant to cut living plants; it's usually 
better to just pitch the tent on top of them. I use no tarp underneath my tent; 
it's not needed to protect the bottom of the tent from leaves and pine straw, 
and I seldom find soil stains.</p>
<h3>The Simple Tarp Tent</h3> 
<p>To get back to the tarp tent, a simple tarp rigged to sleep under has many 
advantages compared with a tent. The tarp weights much less, takes up less 
space, and can be pitched more quickly. Although many ways of pitching the tarp 
work, the method I preferred was to run a line about two feet high between two 
trees four or more feet apart, and then to drape the tarp over that, so my head 
would be under the cord, six feet of the tarp would extend on the lower side 
for my legs and feet, and two feet on the higher side for my head. Cords from 
each of the four corners of the tarp would then be tied to nearby trees. The 
greatest advantage of this tarp-tent was the ability it gave me to enjoy the 
night. I could look out and see the stars and any wild animals that approached. 
I really felt a part of the natural world. I also had a great deal of space 
under a 9X6 tarp. I can approximate this experience with my current tent by 
sleeping without using the door fly and by leaving the door open. This is only 
recommended for nights with small chance for bugs or rain.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of the tarp tent were also great. I never did sleep 
soundly, awakening at the smallest noise. There was no protection from either 
flying or crawling insects. While the flying insects were generally more 
troublesome, it does not take very many ants crawling through the bed clothes 
and biting every now and then to make sleep impossible. Nonetheless, I used a 
tarp tent exclusively from 1963 to 1968 and again in 1986 and 1987. This was 
possible because there are many sites in Alabama with few flying and crawling 
insects. Tarp camping in Michigan, Ontario, and Minnesota in the early summer 
of 1966 was most unpleasant, however. Only my blankets protected me against 
massive numbers of mosquitoes (and, in Canada, black flies).</p>
<h3>Cooking on a Campfire</h3> 
<p>During those first few years in college, I cooked over a campfire on my 
trips. Not satisfied with just normal cooking, I also experimented with baking 
bread -- an outdoor cooking task that was never quite satisfactory. While 
cooking over an open fire added a flavor to the trip, it also added a smell. It 
was also a time-consuming process as well. It seemed to be part of those early 
trips to come back smelling like a fire, tired from lack of sleep, and 
thoroughly satisfied</p>
<h3>How Much Equipment Is Necessary</h3> 
<p>Part of my reason for bringing up such topics as tarps, open fires, and 
wool blankets is to point out how little is necessary to enjoy camping in the 
woods. In some ways, simple methods make the trip more interesting. And I 
certainly wouldn't want anyone to be discouraged from having a good time due to 
lack of money. Homemade equipment made not only local camping possible but my 
early touring trips as well. I have never forgotten the answer someone received 
on a Sierra Club hike. He had simply asked what minimum equipment he would need 
to start camping, and the person leading the trip -- who evidently considered 
himself a great expert -- rattled off the brand names of and details about 
hundreds -- if not thousands -- of dollars of equipment, saying each item was 
absolutely necessary. Actually, on a warm night in many areas, one can sleep 
right on the ground without any gear whatsoever, although a ground cloth would 
be a good idea. I have slept without pitching my tent many times (I've also had 
to pitch the tent in the middle of the night too, when the weather changed). 
But my real point is that it doesn't take first-rate equipment to have a 
first-rate time, nor will first-rate equipment do you much good if you don't 
understand what you're doing.</p>
<h3>My First Bicycle Camping Trips</h3> 
<p>At the end of November in 1964, I bought a bike and used it to explore the 
countryside as thoroughly as I had the woods. By the end of the summer, I was 
ready for my first bicycle camping trip to the Smoky Mts. The next year, I went 
on my trip to Northern Ontario.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Stoves</h3> 
<p>However, for my first trip I borrowed, and for the second I bought a 
gasoline stove. This was a necessary change for several reasons. 1) I wanted to 
be able to cook my meal quickly with little work or fuss; a campfire would 
require time to gather the wood, build up the fire, slowly cook the food, 
careful extinguish the fire, remove all signs of the fire, and scour the black 
off the pots. 2) I wanted to keep very clean, yet the fire would give me a foul 
smell and make getting dirty much easier. 3) I wanted to do nothing to endanger 
or destroy the beauty of the places where I was camping.</p>
<h3>Simple Cooking</h3> 
<p>Cooking on the stove is just like cooking indoors except that I am confined 
to a frying pan and pot. The equipment needed for outdoor cooking is small. I 
usually don't even carry the frying pan. I do most of my cooking in a single 
three-quart pot that I also use to eat out of. The pot weighs much less than a 
cooking kit and is more practical anyway. Beside the pot, I carry the stove, a 
fuel bottle, a can opener, a knife-fork-spoon set, the pot lid, and a sharp 
knife. When packing my bags, I use the space inside the pot to hold food that 
must be cooked, such as rice.</p>
<p>While I never did learn the art of fine cooking, I learned how to cook 
practical, simple meals for myself, and I have cooked most of my meals since I 
was 17. Basically, cooking in a pot means just boiling water, and putting some 
things in the boiling water before others. A piece of chicken needs 30 minutes 
or more, rice takes 20, and many vegetables will cook in ten. In using one pot 
to cook in, I just cook everything together, adding the ingredients at separate 
times, so that they'll each receive the proper amount of cooking. I even cook 
spaghetti this way, getting the spaghetti fairly soft, emptying out most of the 
water, and adding the sauce a little at a time (spaghetti, however, is not a 
good choice for a small pot and a hot stove). Usually, while my pot is boiling, 
I'll be doing other things, such as pitching the tent.</p>
<p>In choosing foods to eat on a trip, I buy fresh fruits and vegetables, 
yogurt, rice, pasta, and bread. I keep my meat-eating down on bike trips: 
first, small quantities of meat are usually expensive, and second, they spoil 
very easily (this is especially a problem due to having to buy food when the 
opportunity presents itself and to not being sure of my camping place that 
night). So, I sometimes buy sardines and chicken bologna on trips, when I 
rarely use them at home. In areas where hoagies are cheap, I buy them; and in 
other areas, I make sandwiches for lunch. I eat most of my vegetables raw. I 
now usually eat so well during the day that my evening meal is often slight or 
skipped altogether. (A note about my food: I don't eat beef, pork, or the flesh 
of any mammal.)</p>
<h3>Places to Sleep</h3> 
<p>On all of my trips, the greatest number of nights are spend neither at 
campgrounds nor at motels but at sites of my own choosing. What is wrong with a 
public campground? There are several problems with car campgrounds for 
cyclists. First, bicycle campers must often travel long distances and up steep 
hills to reach campground locations. For a motorist, to travel an extra five 
miles one way to the campground is no big deal, but to a cyclist the ten-mile 
round trip to the campground is likely to be 20% of the day's travel. Second, 
campgrounds often offer little privacy and quiet. Unlike a motorist, the 
cyclist lacks all the extras to ensure privacy, is physically tired, and just 
wants a quiet night's rest. A cyclist does not travel with a mob of screaming 
kids, a pack of dogs, a noisy radio, a color TV, a supply of charcoal or 
firewood, great slabs of meat, a cooler full of beer, a standing tent with 
auxiliary sleeping tent and connecting canopy, a full set of cookware, a gas 
stove, one or more gasoline or electric floodlamps, a bug zapper, fogs of 
chemical spray, a motorhome, a boat, a spare car, or an extra trailer. Nor is a 
bicycle camper thrilled with acre after acre of parking lots with mandatory 
gravel &quot;pads&quot; for the tent, open and smelly trash cans, a scarcity of 
scrawny trees, cigarette butts and beer tops littering the ground, and the 
obviously mandatory mowed grass. Frankly, sleeping in the backyard at home is a 
lot more of an adventure, and a lot quieter. Third, bicycle campers do not 
share the cultural attitudes of the others. It's sort of like being the only 
Buddhist at a Baptist church.</p>
<p>When I returned to cycling in 1985, after an absence of eight years, I 
assumed that all these cyclists traveling around with their loaded-down bikes 
were like me. However, in talking to the few I met, I discovered that they were 
staying in campgrounds or motels. Then when I bought some books on bicycle 
touring, I discovered lots of material about equipment for camping, but no 
advice whatsoever about how to camp. That reminds me of the &quot;safety 
information&quot; that tells you to obey the law but that doesn't tell you what 
the law is. There is good advice in the hiking books about camping, but 
unfortunately, some of it is wrong or misleading for bicycle camping. So I want 
to set the matter straight here.</p>
<h3>What Does the Law Say?</h3> 
<p>In traveling by bike, does the law require me to beg or buy a place to 
sleep at night? There is no such law. People who rent cabins, rooms, and 
camping sites would like for us to believe that we have to stay at their 
facilities, but no law requires me to do so. In fact, if I can't find a place 
to camp near a small town, I will contact the police for advice. It's a waste 
of time to do so in a city; however, because the city usually has lots of local 
ordinances to avoid &quot;vagrancy.&quot; I wouldn't recommend just pitching a 
tent along the public road in the US, although it's common in many countries. 
Getting out of sight is a sensible idea since it avoids hassles from 
passers-by. The only time I camp in a spot visible to others is in a public 
area approved for camping or well off of the road, such as in the far end of a 
field or up on a hill.That doesn't mean that I can't see the road from where I 
am camping. If the brush and/or leaves are heavy, I might camp within 50 feet 
of the pavement.</p>
<h3>Camping on Public Land</h3> 
<p>Is it legal for me to camp on public land without asking permission? The 
answer varies from place to place. Public land is owned by federal, state, and 
local governments and is controlled by different agencies of the above, each 
with different rules. Camping in national parks is usually limited to 
backpackers, but Shenandoah is an exception. I can always camp in a national 
forest if I abide by its restrictions (the most common restrictions are to camp 
a certain minimum distance from the road and to not camp at all in a few 
areas). State parks and forests vary quite a bit; sometimes they allow &quot;no 
overnight use&quot; or permit no camping or backpacking at all. In other cases, 
they allow backpacking but don't want me to camp; sometimes I am told I can 
camp if I leave the bicycle tied up at the road, a sure way to invite trouble 
or lose a bicycle. The most irritating restriction to me is this simple one: I 
can camp anywhere if and only if I let the ranger know exactly where I am. 
That's fine for car campers but makes bicycle camping impossible. I would have 
to find a site, then ride miles to hopefully find the ranger and then return. 
There's also a strong tendency to have a few dumb rules that have nothing to 
due with safety, reality, or anything. North Carolina goes to the greatest 
extreme with its watershed lands where it is illegal to even stop on the road 
to look at the view. On the other hand, one official in one state said he could 
give me no official opinion about camping on state lands, but he advised me 
that there was no one charged with seeking out such individuals nor any 
punishment listed if they should be found. He suggested that if I was just 
spending one night and moving on that no one would care one way or another. 
Some national forests have problems with people living on them, so they have a 
two-week camping limit as a result.</p>
<h3>Why Most Restrictions Aren't Necessary</h3> 
<p>By the way, almost all the restrictions on camping are a lot of 
foolishness. There's not that many campers, they do little harm, and they 
create a fire hazard in only a few regions and/or times of year (campers with 
stoves create no hazard). These rules against camping are mainly designed to 
get everyone to use the facilities for motorists, but they foolishly prevent 
people, especially children, from enjoying the woods who would otherwise more 
strongly support those parks and forests. They are also based on the idea that 
everyone arrives by motor vehicle. The restrictions do make sense in very small 
or crowded parks, but even there some seldom used corner could be designed for 
primitive camping. If you think these restrictions are designed to protect wild 
animals, I can point out that almost all of these places are open to hunting. A 
few campers are going to have little effect on the animal populations.</p>
<h3>Bicycle Campers Have Not Been Good Advocates</h3> 
<p>In regard to camping on public land, cyclists have not been good advocates 
of their interests. Many public forests and parks that are publicly and openly 
in favor of backpackers sleeping out in the woods feel that cyclists must stay 
in pubic campgrounds which poorly accommodate them. An important question here 
is, are bicycle campers more like motorists or like backpackers? The similarity 
is that the equipment used in bicycle camping is the same as the equipment used 
in backpacking; perhaps we ought to call ourselves bikepackers. The cyclist 
needs the same kind of camping spot as a backpacker with one exception, the 
cyclist can carry all the necessary water. This makes it possible for the 
cyclist to camp on the mountaintop while the backpacker has to camp in the 
valley. On the other hand, the bicycle camper is not going to want to travel 
long distances from the pavement. For instance, I seldom camp more than 400 
feet from the highway and often less than 100 feet. To some rangers, this 
presents a great problem, but I always get out of sight and camp in an area 
where there are no trails for people to hike. Thus my camping sites are less 
likely to be discovered than those of a backpacker. And unlike the motorist, I 
don't need a road or even a path. In regard to trash, it is true that a bicycle 
camper could carry more in than a backpacker, but it is also easier to carry it 
out as well. When I break camp in the morning, the only sign that I have been 
there is that the ground is &quot;flatter&quot; and drier where my tent was.</p>
<h3>Camping on Private Land</h3> 
<p>Is it legal for me to camp on private land without permission? Yes and no, 
as there are two kinds of private land. Improved property is land that has a 
building, a fence, mowed grass, or other signs of occupancy and use. I can 
legally camp on these lands only if I have permission. Otherwise, I am 
automatically trespassing. Unimproved property is unfenced, unposted, 
woodlands, fields, or scrub, that shows no sign of the owner's hand. This land 
can be camped on without violating the law in most states. If the owner wishes 
me to stay off of this property, he must place a &quot;no trespassing&quot; 
sign. If no such sign is posted, he can ask me to leave, he can charge me for 
any damage to his land, but he cannot charge me with trespassing (which is a 
misdemeanor, and not a felony). Fenced land, by the way, seems to be regarded 
as open land in some ways (remember the rules about closing the farmer's 
fence?) and as closed land in other ways. I just made the decision to never 
camp within fenced-in land.</p>
<p>It must be stressed, however, that I am fully liable for any damage I do 
while on another person's property. In an Alabama case, a man prepared a picnic 
area but did not mark it &quot;no trespassing.&quot; When people stopped there 
to have a picnic, he sued them in court. Since the people had left some trash 
on the ground, they had to pay $5. Later, some other people cut trees on the 
same land, so he took them to court and won a settlement of thousands of 
dollars. Therefore (and also because of my sense of civic responsibility and my 
love of Nature), I cannot cut any trees or shrubs, start any fires, leave any 
trash, disturb any farm animals, or leave open any closed gates. My policy is 
that when I leave a campsite, there must be no sign that I've even been there.
</p>
<p>I need to point out that trespass laws are state laws, as are the traffic 
laws. Thus, they vary from state to state. The wording of the following Alabama 
State Law is an example of such a law, but it is not the law in other states.
Section 13A-7-1 of the Code of Alabama states, &quot; A person who enters or 
remains upon unimproved and apparently unused land, which is neither fenced nor 
otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders, does so with 
license and privileges unless notice against trespass is personally 
communicated to him by the owner of such land or other authorized person, or 
unless such notice is given by posting in a conspicuous manner.&quot;</p>
<p>It is also important to note the traditional laws about trespass are under 
attack by landowners because they do not wish to have to go to the trouble of 
posting their land, and they want the privilege of being able to arrest anyone 
for trespass who they happen to find there. Trespass laws are especially used 
against hunters, homeless people, dumpers, and vandals, as getting a conviction 
for trespass is easier than getting a conviction for any actual crime. They are 
also used in property disputes. Recently, in Wisconsin, a law was passed which 
&quot;makes a person liable for trespass even when unintentionally entering 
another&#146;s land, and it eliminates the requirement that land be posted or 
marked. Under this bill, which passed into law, a hiker or hunter lost in the 
woods may be held liable (a civil forfeiture of up to $1,000) for mistakenly 
wandering onto someone&#146;s unposted property.&quot; Laws like this one and 
the decision in Illinois that cyclists &quot;are not the intended users of the 
road&quot; violate the principles of common law and common sense and will 
probably be overturned.</p>
<h3>When to Ask Permission on Unimproved Property</h3> 
<p>When should I ask permission to camp on private land? If there's a house 
nearby, so the people could be aware of my presence, I need to talk to the 
people in that house. Even if they don't own the property where I'm camping, 
they're going to be concerned about my being there. If they feel uncomfortable, 
I won't stay, whether they own the land or not. Also, if the land has been 
improved or is marked posted, I must ask or risk charges of trespassing. Posted 
land is not a reaction to bicycle camping as bicycle campers are very rare, 
except in a few parts of the country. People have different reasons for posting 
their property; sometimes, for instance, they just want to limit their 
liability. Often the land belongs to a hunting club. In other cases, they have 
had trouble from or want to keep away dumpers, snowmobile operators, hunters, 
thieves, or unknown strangers.</p>
<h3>Penalties for Trespassing</h3> 
<p>What can happen if I camp illegally on public or private property? Some 
people told me about being fined $300 for picking blackberries along the side 
of the road in Alabama, but that is an extreme example. The Blue Ridge Parkway, 
even more extreme, threatens six months in jail. In most places, if I was found 
camping on posted property, I would probably just be told to leave, but I don't 
count on it. Instead, I just avoid posted or ambiguous sites. I admit, however, 
that I have camped on such sites by mistake. Sometimes a sign is almost 
impossible to see. In such a case, I would have a strong defense in the 
unlikely event that charges were pressed. In any event, I have never done any 
harm to anyone's property.</p>
<h3>Confronting a Land-Owner</h3> 
<p>Although I have never been confronted by a property owner (indeed, my 
camping spot has never been discovered), if such an event happened, I would be 
very polite and immediately offer to leave. I would never argue, as I have no 
right to remain after being asked to leave, nor would I want to remain even if 
somone other than the landowner asked me to go. Most of the private land I camp 
on is probably owned by corporations with little immediate interest or concern 
about what happens there.</p>
<h3>Other Free Camping</h3> 
<p>Where else can I camp free? In small towns, I have often camped in the town 
park; it's best to check with the local police, if the town is large enough to 
have them. If the town is too small for police, I ask at a nearby store. I have 
also camped at a police station and at fire stations (in pretty spots too!).</p>
<p>There are also bits and pieces of ground that I use that no one has much 
interest in: under bridges, along right of ways, within wooded traffic islands, 
and behind guard rails. I just make sure I'm out of sight and that the spot 
shows no signs of recent use.</p>
<p>Some cyclists often camp in churchyards and cemeteries. I have camped at 
both locations on occasions. However, I have also had trouble finding someone 
to ask permission. People can be touchy about someone camping in these 
locations, especially on Sundays.</p>
<p>Finally, I have done a fair bit of camping in people's yards; usually, it 
was their idea when I asked about places to camp.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages to Camping in the Open</h3> 
<p>A lot of people think of camping as being something someone does in a field 
rather than in the woods. I have to admit that the original Latin word referred 
to a field, but fields have several problems: 1) the campsite is visible from 
the road, so one may be bothered by by-passers, 2) there is no protection from 
the sun and the heat, 3) the wind can be a problem, 3) the ground is harder, 4) 
the opportunities to see wildlife are greatly reduced, and 5) the tent is 
likely to be soaked by dew, requiring a separate stop to spread it out to dry. 
And frankly, I just don't go on camping trips to camp in fields.</p>
<h3>Fear of the Woods</h3> 
<p>The problem for many people is that they are not used to camping in the 
woods. I agree that it's best to begin gradually. A good method would be to 
only camp in the very most suitable spots until familiarity is gained. Another 
idea is to make several practice camping trips before starting on a long trip; 
this is a good idea anyway.</p>
<p>I must acknowledge that there is often a great deal of fear connected with 
camping in the woods. People have heard all kinds of horror stories about 
snakes, wild animals, and poison ivy, to go along with a natural fear of dark 
and unknown places. Thoreau said, &quot;I believe that men are generally still 
a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and Christianity 
and candles have been introduced.&quot; The truth is that poisonous snakes are 
rare in the woods, and they are not interested in bothering people at all. In 
walking in the woods, I have learned to watch where I put my feet, but I rarely 
see any snake, let alone a poisonous one. More likely I'll get a scratched 
ankle from a saw briar. The few poisonous snakes I have encountered made no 
attempt to attack me. Attacks by wild animals are rare. In one recent year in 
the US, one person was killed by mountain lions and bears (combined), 15 by 
snakes, 20 by dogs, and 150 by striking deer with their motor vehicles. Poison 
ivy is also greatly overrated. It runs as a heavy vine up tree trunks, and a 
related plant, poison oak, is a frequent ground cover. But few people are 
allergic to either one, although it's best not to dig, tear up, or disturb any 
forest life anyway. Insects are no more likely to be a problem back in the 
woods than anywhere else. In any state, it's best to avoid camping in low 
swampy ground, but in some areas of the North and West, mosquitoes and/or black 
flies are a real problem. However, the use of insect repellent, long clothing, 
and mosquito netting on tents mainly solves the problem. Basically, it's no 
more dangerous to camp in the woods than it is to live next to one.</p>
<h3>How I Pick a Camping Site</h3> 
<p>The first step is early in the day, usually before I get up, when I check 
over my maps and make some predictions. Usually, I am on a strange road, and I 
have no certainty as to which way I'll go. So, I'll choose a route on the map 
that connects two towns rather than two large cities, and I'll depend on my 
observations during the day to make a final decision. I might have a topo map 
or forest map to help me make a better decision about camping possibilities, 
but most often I just plan on being in a rural area towards evening and seeing 
what I can find. If I start looking for a camping place at six in the evening, 
I still have plenty of time to find one before dark.</p>
<p>As part of my plans for camping, I make sure all three of my quart water 
bottles are full in the late afternoon. I like to say, one bottle is for 
drinking, one is for cooking, and one will get me to my first stop in the 
morning. I could camp on two bottles and still cook, but it would be close. I 
would only camp with one bottle if I had already eaten and was showing no signs 
of thirst. To aid in getting water, I carry a water filtration system. 
Otherwise, I would have to boil all the water that I get from streams or add 
iodine tables to it.</p>
<p>As I ride along in the late afternoon, I am looking for a suitable spot. On 
some roads and in some regions, finding a camping spot is so easy that the only 
problem is picking the best one. On other roads or in other regions, I can ride 
for hours without finding anything at all, but my study of the map in the 
morning and my observations of the area in which I am riding help me understand 
what to expect. As I ride along, I see some good sites near houses. If it were 
later in the day, I would be more tempted to stop and ask permission, but for 
right now, I continue riding. Here's another good site, but there's a fence. In 
some states, every patch of property, no matter how useless, is fenced in. Now 
I see another place, but there's a dirt road leading into it. I don't like such 
places generally. Anyone traveling in a motor vehicle can pull off here. So, I 
only camp along such a road if I can find a spot that can't be seen from that 
road. But even then, the possibility that someone will pull off onto that road 
is good. My worst experience was on a local trip in 1997. I crossed the 
railroad track at a parking site and went way back over a hill to camp, but in 
the morning, some people arrived at the parking site and used my hill for 
target practice for an hour. Since I was safe from their shots, I just kept 
quiet, but I felt extremely uncomfortable. It's just much better to stop where 
others won't.</p>
<p>But now, riding along, I see a favorable area. There's woods on both sides, 
no houses near, and the land is high and dry (I carry enough water and avoid 
low sites to avoid wet ground and/or mosquitoes). Looking back into the woods 
on either side, something the motorists can't do, I notice that the trees are 
of reasonable size, and that the land on the left is higher. It's a plus if 
there is no place to even stop a car; certainly, I avoid a frequently used 
pull-off.</p>
<p>The size and spacing of the trees is an important indication that can be 
seen from the road. If the trees are all very small and widely spaced, the 
&quot;woods&quot; will be a weed field. If they are small and tightly spaced, I 
will have to camp like a hobbit. If they are large, the open spaces will be 
wide and handsome. In fact, the size of the trees often determines how far from 
the road I'll camp, since I want to be back far enough to not be visible and 
since small trees and thick growth with not only hide me quicker but will also 
make traveling back into the woods more difficult. Of course, traveling at 15 
mph, I can also look back into the woods and see details that a 55 mph motorist 
can not.</p>
<p>Whether the land is higher or lower than the road also has some importance. 
I don't want to be seen, and it is easier for a passenger to see deep into the 
woods from above than from below. Occasionally, I will camp on a bluff, hill, 
or road cut that gives me a balcony on the night sky yet allows me to be 
invisible from below.</p>
<p>Pulling off the road, I let some cars go by and then push the bike off the 
road out of sight. In pushing the bike into the woods, I am careful not to let 
limbs get hung in the wheels or chain. At the edge of the woods, next to the 
road, the brush and leaves very thick as everything is fighting for sunlight. A 
few feet back in the shade, there are more open spaces. If everything looks 
good, I'll keep moving back while looking for a small natural open spot. On the 
other hand, if the ground is rough, wet, or covered with briars, I will leave 
the bike and check out some of the other surrounding woods before moving on.</p>
<p>Provided everything is suitable, I will make camp a distance from the road 
in keeping with the thickness of the cover; the farther I can see, the farther 
I move off of the road. Often I can see the faces of the motorists as they 
pass, but I am invisible to them because I am so much darker than the brightly 
reflecting leaves next to the road (this doesn't work on overcast days). All I 
really need is enough space to pitch my tent, so sometimes my 
&quot;clearing&quot; is minuscule. Once in Colorado, I had one little scrubby 
tree to hide my presence. In fact, in a few cases, I have camped where there 
was no space for a tent. One night near Murphy, N. C., I felt that it was too 
dangerous to proceed, but while I found cover, there was no spot to lie down, 
so I just slept in a sitting position, as I would go to sleep in an arm chair. 
I have had much worse nights in a fine bed.</p>
<p>What is a good site? Besides giving me enough room to pitch my tent, it 
must also be on fairly dry ground without many saw briars or other unacceptable 
weeds or trees. Second, the ground should slope slightly for drainage and yet 
not be very steep. I always pitch the tent with my feet downhill, so the proof 
of the ground being too steep will be a tendency for me to slide towards my 
feet.</p>
<p>Before making my decision final, I look around at the trees. Dead trees or 
large dead branches must be avoided. Once, on my own property, I looked up and 
studied a large dead tree, and then I traveled about a hundred feet, climbed on 
a large rock, and looked back. At that moment, with no breeze blowing, the tree 
came crashing down! Camping under a dead limb could be fatal.</p>
<p>A few trees received undo attention from lightning, so I look for scars as 
well.</p>
<h3>Activities after Stopping</h3> 
<p>My next step depends on the time of day. If I have arrived near dark, I 
quickly prepare my meal and pitch my tent. If the day is early, I usually walk 
around and check out my woods.</p>
<p>In walking around, the greatest risk is being bitten by insects. There is a 
mild danger from Lyme disease, spread by tiny deer ticks. While I ignore this 
danger, I could spray my socks, shoes, and legs with repellent, so the ticks 
won't get on my body. After my walk, I inspect for the large dog ticks. Due to 
spending much time in the woods since childhood, I am very sensitive to insects 
landing or crawling on my body, and I always kill them immediately. I tear dog 
ticks in half with my finger nails.</p>
<p>If the place I have found has a lot of mosquitoes, I am likely to leave for 
a better site. However, all nearby land might also be low, or it might be time 
for the mosquitoes to naturally arrive -- mosquitoes are always worst at dusk. 
Although I could spray myself with repellent from head to foot for mosquitoes, 
I generally prefer to wear my jacket and rain pants instead. If a site is on a 
hill, mountain, or lake shore with a good breeze, the problem of mosquitoes 
will be minimal.</p>
<p>By the way, there are worse insects than mosquitoes. No-seem-ums are very 
tiny flying midges that are very difficult to see. Usually, I recognize their 
presence by my hands and arms burning. While not as painful as being bitten, 
the sensation becomes overwhelming very quickly. At the campground on the 
Chesapeake Bay in '93, they appeared in clouds at dusk. I first encountered 
them in the Smokies and later in Alabama, but Thoreau first met them in Maine. 
The Canadian black fly is the same creature that we call a gnat in Alabama. 
However, in Alabama, the gnats fly during the day and just get into your eyes, 
looking for moisture. In South Georgia, they can appear in clouds. But in 
Canada, the black flies crawl under clothing at dusk to bite, leaving small 
bloody marks. Repellent works, and a tent with tight netting is a necessity. 
All these insects are best avoided by not camping in or near low, wet ground.
</p>
<h3>Using a Gasoline Stove</h3> 
<p>My preparation for setting up the stove is minimal. If there is a large 
flat rock, I'll put the stove on that. Otherwise, I'll just scoop some leaves 
out of the way to place the stove on the dirt. It is important to be careful 
when fueling the stove. Any gasoline spilled on the ground can explode into 
flame later. A good idea is to walk 50 feet away to fill the stove or attach 
the fuel bottle. My stove also requires spilling a little gas on the outside 
and igniting it. Again, this is an opportunity to get burned or to burn the 
woods down, so I use caution. I always carefully tighten the top of the fuel 
bottle before going on to the next step.</p>
<p>For nearly 35 years, I have been burning white or &quot;unleaded&quot; gas 
from the gas pump in my gas stoves. For years, Amoco was the only station that 
carried it; now it's the most common gas in America. However, I have never 
burned -- and would caution against using -- MTBE gas, oxygenated gas, or 
gasohol. Coleman sells a fuel very similar to white gas which is often called 
white gas, but it would not burn properly in a combustion engine as it contains 
naphtha, aliphatic petroleum distillates, Xylene, and Toluene. Some recommend 
against using any gas other than Coleman fuel in small gas stoves because of 
the additives found in unleaded gas or because unleaded gas is more explosive. 
However, because Coleman gas is sold in gallon containers while a pint of 
gasoline will last a week, it's not a practical solution for the bike traveler. 
The solution, in my opinion, is to buy a stove that does not require a special 
fuel, to be careful about not spilling fuel, and to not breathe the fumes from 
the stove (which would be hazardous even with Coleman fuel).</p>
<p>I also am very careful while boiling water. One quart of boiling hot water 
is enough to kill someone (cold water is the best remedy for hot water or a 
burn). My stove, the old reliable Svea 123, is not too steady, so I always make 
sure that it is firmly on the ground before adding the pot of water. Losing 
that much water because of an accidental spill could also leave me thirsty for 
the night (a terrible experience) or make me break camp.</p>
<p>Often while my stove is bubbling, I am busy with my tent. But I never leave 
due to the fire hazard and because gas stoves are quick at burning the food in 
the pot. I have already explained how I cook, so I will pass that by, but I 
will suggest watching the pot closely as the rice or whatever absorbs water and 
the rest boils away. A nice pot of food can become a mess within half a minute. 
Spaghetti is especially troublesome, wanting to either lump together, turn into 
a sticky, slimy mass, or burn on the bottom of the pan. It is much easier to 
cook at home, even in the same pot. A good way to prepare for a trip would be 
to cook the kind of foods that you are going to eat in the same pot and even on 
the same stove, butuse the camp stove only out of doors away from any fire 
hazard, and don't breathe the fumes.</p>
<h3>Pitching a Tent</h3> 
<p>A good tent should pitch quickly and easily. Remember your feet must be at 
the lowest spot. As I have already said, remove loose limbs, cones, nuts, or 
rocks before spreading it. Lying on the ground first is a good quick test. In 
the tent, I always place a light so I can get up at night, although I use a 
light very little. Basically, I go to sleep when it's dark. In the tent, I also 
place a Thermorest pad. I must admit that I was suspicious of these pads when 
they first appeared, but I have used mine on all my trips for eight years now 
without a leak. Then, I put in my sleeping bag (I have two: one much lighter 
than the other to be used for summer trips only. They both are mummy bags with 
synthetic fill -- down is horrible about absorbing water and clumping into 
tight, wet balls). I put in my maps, etc., so I can study my route before I go 
to bed.</p>
<h3>Cleaning My Pot</h3> 
<p>After eating, I clean up my pot with a little water and my fingers. I've 
become very good at not making a mess. If the pot needs more attention, I will 
add a touch of soap and some more water. I might use a stick or my fork to 
clean a tough spot.</p>
<h3>&quot;House-Keeping&quot; in the Woods</h3> 
<p>Then I repack as much as I can into my bags and fasten everything up. I pay 
special attention to the possibility of rain in preparing for the night. It 
makes no sense to put a dry sleeping bag into a wet pannier.</p>
<p>Many books insist that it's necessary to hang all food from trees. Since I 
usually don't have meat and don't camp in public campgrounds, I have only once 
had visitors to eat my food in the night, and they were mice. I carry trash 
away when I leave, although I do leave banana peels and other organic wastes in 
the woods.</p>
<h3>Campground Sanitation</h3> 
<p>Usually, I do my urinating and defecating in the woods on a trip. Many 
books and some state and provincial laws suggests that human wastes must be 
buried one or two feet deep. When I first started camping, I carried a small 
trowel, then used a folding shovel, and finally realized that nothing short of 
dynamite can make a two-foot hole in the woods; there are just too many rocks 
and roots. And the truth is that anything buried beneath the active part of the 
solid just stays there without decomposing. On the other hand, most people just 
use the top of the ground and leave their wastes exposed to flies, a very 
unsanitary and unsightly method. On my own property when first camping out 
there, I used the space under some large, flat rocks, and I discovered that my 
feces were returning to nature within two or three days. So, on a trip, I first 
find a place that is not near running water or a path, I second use my foot and 
shoe to scoop off the leaves and as much of the dirt as I can, I next pull down 
my pants and then squat in this cat hole (using the natural position) until I'm 
done, sometimes steadying my bottom against my leg, I then wipe before 
standing, and I finish by carefully covering everything up.</p>
<h3>Wild Animals</h3> 
<p>Late afternoon is the time when wild animals are likely to show up near the 
campsite. It is rare for me to encounter animals while hiking because 1) they 
hear me coming and 2) many animals are more active in the evening and the night 
anyway. I have seen nearly every wild animal while traveling on my bike or at 
my cabin or while camping in the woods. None of these animals made any attempt 
to bother me, and most disappeared as quickly as they were aware of me. My most 
common visitors are deer, and they will come within 50 feet at times, trying to 
figure out what I'm doing. On the other hand, at many campsites, I only hear 
their snorts. Among the few animals I have never seen are coyotes, but I was 
serenaded by them at a spooky close distance once. I never identify large 
numbers of my night visitors; they are just sounds in the dark.</p>
<h3>Sleeping</h3> 
<p>I find, when I camp in the woods, that I usually sleep much better than in 
my own bed. I think part of the reason is being tired from a long ride, but the 
woods is also very dark and quiet at night. Usually, at home, when I wake 
during the night, I can't get back to sleep. But in the woods, I'm sleeping 
again before I have time to get worried.</p>
<h3>Getting Back on the Road</h3> 
<p>In the morning, I make sure that I didn't miss anything before I go out to 
the road. I also check the bike before I get on to make sure some stick is not 
jammed into my derailleur, under a fender, or in some other bothersome spot.</p>
<h3>Keeping Clean</h3> 
<p>The most common argument I get against camping in the woods is, &quot;I 
want to be able to take a shower.&quot; Our society has developed a fetish for 
cleanliness that does not allow smelly bodies and clothes or dirty fingernails. 
However, the problem of keeping clean on a touring trip is not as great as 
people imagine. First of all, the cause of much sweaty odor is being out of 
shape. Second, the cause of most dirt is from working around dirt. As a 
cyclist, I don't get dirty or sweaty in the normal sense of the word. On my 
trips years ago, I used to get pretty dirty from the dust of the road, but most 
of our roads today are clean pavement and grass. Third, a common cause of odor 
is the clothing, especially soft cotton, which not only captures and holds 
odors but also rots easily, producing odors. I use only synthetics. Fourth, an 
additional cause of dirt is skin and hair oil which gradually accumulates. This 
can create a very sticky feeling. I solve the problem in this fashion. At some 
point in the afternoon, while my water bottles are still hot from the sun, I 
find a shady spot off of the road and give myself a little sponge bath, using a 
touch of dish-washing liquid and an already worn shirt. This cleans the oil off 
of my skin, so I feel fresh again. Usually, I wait to clean my hair until I 
have a lake or stream to swim in. Of course, I can't use soap in a lake or 
stream, but it doesn't seem to be necessary. If it was, I would get out with my 
hair wet, and clean it with a touch of soap and a shirt, then rise with a water 
bottle.</p>
<p>The problems of camping in the wild, if done in a careful and conscientious 
way, are largely imaginary. The pleasures are great.</p>
