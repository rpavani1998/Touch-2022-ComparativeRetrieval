<h3>Advantages of Gas Ranges</h3> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<p> Advantages of Gas Ranges</p> 
<p> There's a reason restaurants use gas ranges almost exclusively: there are 
a number of advantages to using a gas range as opposed to an electric range. 
Although home cooks don't require quite the same performance that a 
professional chef needs from a stove, they may find that gas stoves are easier 
to work with and observe that they produce more dependable results than their 
electric counterparts. There is an assortment of reasons to opt for gas over 
electric.</p> 
<p> For people concerned about the bottom line, it tends to be cheaper to 
operate a gas stove, depending on the type of gas used to fuel it (natural gas 
is the least expensive) and the prevailing prices for gas. Gas stoves tend to 
be a bit more expensive to buy and install, but people may feel that this is 
worth it when viewing costs in the long term.</p> 
<p> A gas stove offers immensely more control over what is going on at the 
stove top. When temperature adjustments are made with a gas stove, the stove 
changes immediately, rather than taking time to heat up or cool off, as is the 
case with an electric range. For finicky dishes, this level of control can be 
critical. It's also easy to gauge how much heat a pot or pan is getting by 
looking at the flame, allowing for more accuracy when working with gas.</p> 
<p> Gas stoves also tend to contribute less to ambient temperatures in the 
kitchen. After a day of slogging over the stove, the kitchen should not be 
significantly warmer as a result of lost heat from the stove, a common problem 
with electric stoves. Gas stoves also work when the power is out, a definite 
plus for people in regions with unreliable power sources, and the stove top 
tends to be cooler than that of an electric stove, reducing the risk of burns.
</p> 
<p> Historically, gas ovens have been criticized as being slightly less 
accurate and harder to handle than electric ovens. However, there are many 
modern gas stoves that offer ovens with excellent performance on par with that 
of an electric oven if not better, and they are often more suitable for tasks 
like broiling and baking bread. A gas stove/oven combination can take up less 
space than a separate range and oven.&nbsp; Ask your major appliance 
professional which stoves cook with the best performance.</p> 
<p> People who want to make the switch from an electric to a gas stove should 
consider switching to gas for theirhot water heatersand their heating systems. 
As long as one is going to go to the expense of installing a gas line, it pays 
to convert several systems at once. Switching to gas for heating can also save 
a significant amount of money.</p> 
<p> <strong>Natural gas prices are currently in decline with new drilling 
technology, America has huge natural gas reserves, which means gas prices, are 
declining markedly right now.&nbsp; It is dangerous to predict where the future 
is going for natural gas, but currently natural gas production is on a steep 
rise, and when supply expands and demand remains the same, prices tend to drop.
