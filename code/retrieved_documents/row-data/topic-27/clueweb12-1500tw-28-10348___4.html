<h2> FAQ </h2> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of questions about food as well as everything else 
over the years, so I did what anyone else with tons of time on his hands would 
do: I started an FAQ page.</p> 
<p>If you have something you want to know and you think the ol&rsquo; 
FoodFella could help, send it along and maybe it will be on this page.</p> 
<h3>What&rsquo;s your favorite restaurant in Toronto?</h3> 
<p>It&rsquo;s too hard to pick just one place that I really love. There are so 
many great places, so the best way to find out if there&rsquo;s a restaurant 
that stands out is to look on the reviews page.</p> 
<h3>What type of food do you enjoy the most?</h3> 
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to pick just one. I&rsquo;d say my 
favorites include some traditional French (because that&rsquo;s what I 
learned), classic American as well as barbecue, Italian, Spanish, Mexican, 
Seafood, Sushi and Japanese, Thai and contemporary Canadian.</p> 
<h3>Why do you shop at restaurant supply shops?</h3> 
<p>I find the quality of the products there to be really good. If something is 
designed to withstand the abuse it will get in a restaurant kitchen, then 
chances are it will last almost forever in a household kitchen.</p> 
<h3>Do you watch the food-related reality shows?</h3> 
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t. Mainly because I find that those shows are produced for 
entertainment purposes rather than showcasing the food itself. They focus on 
the human struggle and the competition as well as the drama. Although I do 
occasionally enjoy<em>Iron Chef America</em> and <em>Restaurant Makeover</em>.
</p> 
<h3>What&rsquo;s are your favorite &ldquo;restaurant cities&rdquo; ?</h3> 
<p>Easily Toronto is one of the best, followed by (in no particular order) New 
York City (providing you stay away from the tourist and celebrity restaurants), 
Vancouver, Montreal, Buffalo (yes,<em>the</em> Buffalo. Plenty of awesome, 
non-chain and non-tourist restaurants there&hellip; you just have to look) and 
Chicago. I&rsquo;m told Ottawa has a growing restaurant scene and I&rsquo;ve 
been wanting to visit Philadelphia and Washington DC.</p> 
<h3>How come TheFoodFella.com isn&rsquo;t just about food?</h3> 
<p>There are tons of great food blogs out there &ndash; many of which that are 
far better than mine. So I wanted to do something different. I wanted to share 
parts of my life, both food and non-food related and add something of a 
personal touch to it&hellip; the same way I do with cooking.</p> 
<h3>For a stove: gas or electric?</h3> 
<p>I prefer gas, but I&rsquo;ve been using a lot of electric as well these 
days. It&rsquo;s a personal preference and while many say that gas is better 
(and I do love it) you can make a fine meal on an electric stove too.</p> 
<h3>How do I find a good espresso/cappuccino maker?</h3> 
<p>Go to specialty stores. Try to find a place that sells more than one brand. 
Ask a lot of questions and try the coffee!</p> 
<h3>When boiling pasta, do you salt the water?</h3> 
<p>Yes. I was taught by one of my chefs to &ldquo;make it taste like the 
sea&rdquo;. But that being said, if you&rsquo;re making a dish that has a lot 
of salt in it (pasta with prosciutto or pancetta, for example) then I ease up 
on the salt in the pasta water.</p> 
<h3>Best food to eat on the TTC?</h3> 
<p>There is no such thing because <em>nobody</em> should be eating on a bus, 
streetcar or subway. I can&rsquo;t think of anything worse than a subway car 
full of people who have to smell whatever it is some guy (or girl) brought on 
board with them.</p> 
<h3>If you could have dinner with one person, who would it be?</h3> 
<p>If we&rsquo;re talking &ldquo;living or dead&rdquo; then I&rsquo;m going to 
have to go with Johnny Carson. If it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;living&rdquo; then 
that&rsquo;s an easy answer&hellip; my wife.</p> <br>
