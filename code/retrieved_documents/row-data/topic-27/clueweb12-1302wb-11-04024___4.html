<h1>
<p>Articles About Sauna Parts and Accessories </p></h1> 
<p>Every component of a home sauna has at least one important purpose, and 
every home sauna accessory can add value to a sauna bath. In addition to 
looking at such significant sauna parts as sauna heaters, sauna rocks and sauna 
doors, the following articles provide helpful information on sauna accessories 
(everything from sauna ladles to negative ion generators) and a versatile 
softwood commonly used in sauna construction. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Chromotherapy - Can Color and Light Improve Your Health?</strong>
<br> Chromotherapy is defined as a system of alternative medicine in which 
colors and their energy frequencies are used to correct psychological or 
physical imbalances. As more and more people investigate it with the intention 
of fixing such imbalances, many are discovering just how effectively 
chromotherapy and far infrared sauna therapy can complement each other.</p> 
<p><strong>Great Saunas Have Great Sauna Doors</strong><strong><br>
</strong>
If you are planning to buy a sauna, you should think seriously about your sauna 
door. Indeed, many sauna owners agree that the sauna door is one of the most 
essential parts of a sauna. A sauna door is much more than just a sauna&rsquo;s 
entrance and exit, and sauna shoppers would be wise to give this vital feature 
the consideration it deserves.<strong><br>
<br>
Sauna Accessories for an Even 
Better Sauna Bath<br>
</strong>Experienced sauna bathers know just how valuable 
the right sauna accessories can be. Often, it is these accoutrements that 
distinguish a sauna session that is truly superior from one that is merely 
second-rate. Used properly, sauna accessories can help a sauna bather create an 
ideal ambience for a decidedly delectable dip in the soothing heat of a sauna.
<strong><br>
<br>
Sauna Rocks &ndash; Another Hot Sauna Topic<br>
</strong>Even 
in the modern era of far infrared sauna therapy, many sauna enthusiasts hold 
firm to their belief that sauna rocks are essential to achieving the definitive 
hot sauna experience. While sauna fans are forever at liberty to debate what 
defines an authentic sauna bath, it is an absolute must that rock sauna owners 
always use proper sauna rocks in their saunas.<strong><br>
<br>
Sauna Stoves 
&ndash; Wood Burning, Electric or Gas?<br>
</strong>Which type of sauna heater 
or sauna stove is best is truly a matter of opinion. One type may be better 
than another in certain conditions and circumstances, but the bottom line seems 
to be that electric sauna heaters, gas sauna heaters, and wood burning sauna 
heaters each have unique appeal.</p> 
<p><strong>Seasonal Affective Disorder, Light Therapy, and Far Infrared Saunas
</strong><br>
 Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of clinical 
depression commonly experienced during the winter months when daylight hours 
decrease. One treatment for SAD that has been shown to be effective is 
phototherapy or light therapy, the administration of doses of bright light from 
a portable device called a light box. Far infrared saunas are therapeutic 
devices known for utilizing a different kind of light, but many of them are now 
being outfitted to help SAD sufferers find hope and healing.<br>
<strong><br>

The Negative Ion Generator &ndash; A Beneficial Infrared Sauna Accessory<br>

</strong>The long list of benefits of far infrared sauna use has already 
convinced countless people to incorporate radiant heat baths into their usual 
routines, but now, with the many extra advantages it offers, an invaluable far 
infrared sauna accessory &ndash; the negative ion generator - is persuading 
even more people to embrace far infrared sauna bathing.<strong><br>
<br>

Western Red Cedar &ndash; A Multi-Purpose Softwood<br>
</strong>Whether 
you&rsquo;re building a sauna, gazebo, greenhouse, patio deck, canoe or casket, 
the odds are against you finding a softwood more perfect for your project than 
the lightweight yet durable Western red cedar.<strong><br>
<br>
Western Red 
Cedar Saunas &ndash; Saunas of Life<br>
</strong>Western red cedar is an ideal 
wood for building saunas. Throughout the years, saunas made of Western red 
cedar have provided great benefits to the people lucky enough to own them or 
use them on a regular basis. Sweat bathing in cedar saunas has been credited 
with promoting blood circulation, improving lung function, increasing immunity 
to viruses and infections, assisting skin care, aiding relaxation, and more.</p>
