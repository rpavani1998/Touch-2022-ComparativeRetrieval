while being one of the leaders in a revenue sport serves as a boost in prestige, football serves as a more significant boost to donor revenue.no matter how good the other sports are, and making an investment in football will pay off in the long run far more than the sum of the investment, and more than applying those resources to any other sport on campus.while unc football is facing someserious charges from the ncaa which could affect the program in the short-term, and have not had a great deal of success in the sport, they have long been thought of as a "sleeping giant" in the college football world that has the ability and resources to become a factor in the acc and nationally.but also, the fortunes of fellow major division-1 schools have shown that success in football can lead to an enlarged donor base and significantly increased gifts to the athletic department.revenue from ticket sales is one portion of athletic revenue where the football powers have an advantage, given that even given the fewer number of games (7-8 football home games, compared to 18-20 home games for a basketball power), the massive, always sold-out stadiums bring in far more money than even a sold-out dean dome or allen fieldhouse with triple the number of games.with similar profiles in basketball and non-revenue sports, and sharing the same media markets, there really is one factor that would explain the value of unc to be so much higher than that of duke.while not limiting myself just to those few schools, there is a clear hierarchy in the level of donations among the various powers: the football schools bring in significantly more in donations than do the basketball leaders.a far more significant factor that distinguishes the major football schools from the basketball powers is the level of private contributions to the athletic department.the people taking charge of the project know a heck of a lot about college sports, and from being able to keep up with the offline discussion surrounding it, they are taking selections, and weighing the advantages and disadvantages of all the d-1 schools very seriously.for that matter, virginia tech received more in athletic donations last year than did unc, despite its own relative weakness in basketball plus not having the same base of wealth to draw from as does unc (or other flagship state universities).while in the big east, louisville serves as a big outlier- which uconn proves to be the exception, the general reality is that the schools with major football programs notably and significantly outperform those known for their basketball programs.this is considered to be very much a basketball conference, yet the largest level of contributions among public schools in the acc went to florida state, a school with (relatively) mediocre basketball but a strong football program over the past three decades.the limitation of the effect of this factor however is that even mediocre college football teams draw pretty well, particularly where there is a greater culture of athletic success at the university; for example, unc and kentucky may not be that great in football right now, but they stillsell out their nearly all their games.there are sure to be improvements that morgan center can make in terms of selling the department, the successes and financial needs of the various teams to donors wealthy or not.leaving out schools with a solid-to-strong football profile and high donor revenue, but having a single uber-wealthy "sugar daddy" alumni to fund their needs - like oregon and oklahoma state, there are several schools that can fairly said to be football powers - such as alabama, lsu, ohio state, oklahoma, texas for example, as well as some strong-to powerful basketball schools such as kansas, kentucky, unc and uconn.
