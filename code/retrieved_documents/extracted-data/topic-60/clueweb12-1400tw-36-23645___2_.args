without that, we're no better than the big east, who will have a regular top ten program among their ranks soon.it also gives us insight into why the conferences not named the sec and the big have targeted who they have targeted for any remaining expansion.a 12 team acc might be more attractive to notre dame.both the pac 12, b1g and the acc are more limited by geography, though this limitation is self imposed by the respective conference.as to the target schools, you might be able to expand that to include potential 16 team leagues: pac 12: texas, oklahoma, tag-alongs accepted as long as texas is in the package acc: notre dame, pick-em big 12: florida state, clemsonm louisville, cincy, afa, byu sec: florida state, clemson, wvu, oklahoma, texas b1g: notre dame, pick-em (as long as academics are respectable) both the pac 12, b1g and the acc are more limited by geography, though this limitation is self imposed by the respective conference.florida has a .700 winning % in the ncaas, 2 ncs, 4 ffs, and 6 elite 8s.arizona has a .622 winning % in the ncaas, 1 nc, 4 ffs, and 8 elite 8s.the acc on the otherhand is well positioned as a 12 team league if fsu or clemson (or both) were to leave.the acc and big 12 are in similar situations, although the latter's two kings are more stable than the acc's, the acc's barons are more plentiful.i am more hopeful that the acc is rising with fsu looking better every year, syracuse actually playing competitive football again.and the acc supposedly tested the waters with both texas and notre dame, showing a willingness to go beyond their perceived geography.the big 12 and the sec are more willing to go beyond what would be considered their "region".the pac-12 - texas and oklahoma the acc - notre dame the big 12 - florida state and clemson ultimately, for the acc (since this is an acc board), the league truly needs fsu and miami to get back to being kings on the field as well as off the field.ultimately, for the acc (since this is an acc board), the league truly needs fsu and miami to get back to being kings on the field as well as off the field.as to the target schools, you might be able to expand that to include potential 16 team leagues: pac 12: texas, oklahoma, tag-alongs accepted as long as texas is in the package acc: notre dame, pick-em big 12: florida state, clemson, louisville, cincy, afa, byu sec: florida state, clemson, wvu, oklahoma, texas b1g: notre dame, pick-em (as long as academics are respectable)
