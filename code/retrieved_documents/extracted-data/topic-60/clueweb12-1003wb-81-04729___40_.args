the youth programs and leagues are money based and "win at all costs" to make the club and coach look good in order to attract the "best" players with money to inflate the club's accounts.soccer normally falls into a similar demographic as basketball does in the us, impoverished families, but in the us local clubs charge upwards of $1000 (and do so rightly as they wouldn't exist without the funding) for players to travel whereas european clubs allow free to play opportunities.unlike any other sport soccer requires a true athlete with real talent.resources were allocated to produce talented players and give them a structure in which to excel.in brazil and in europe, you will see players being reared from a young age, from a small club, to bigger clubs etc... they have to be interested, and they need to understand there is a possible career in the game for them.soccer has to compete with american football, baseball, and basketball for the best athletes.we are much better than we were 10 years ago with almost all of our players playing in the best leagues in the world here in england or elsewhere in europe.the us has made tremendous strides in their team's performance and has adapted well to the multinational styles of the game but still lacks the passion that the rest of the world has for the sport.with some fans i've talked to, the enjoyment of watching the supporters groups has acted as a bridge to understanding the play on the field.with a population of over 300 million and with a large percentage of immigrants from countries where football is king, it is my belief there should be more talent in america.us youth soccer is going the wrong way fast, and the only way to improve is to start up residential academies for all mls clubs, and pick players based on other factors than size and strength.soccer is the most international sport, the most passionated, the most exciting.the problem is the mentality, is to get the children to dream of playing soccer, finding teammates, the infrastructure, local clubs who will take in those children and train them, see them as an investment, to later sell them.kids are coached from early and it limits their natural ability.he's a terrible teammate and his personal life is abominable.
