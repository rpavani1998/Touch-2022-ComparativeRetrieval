the financial primacy of college football over basketball by patroclus on jun 30, 2011 2:25 pm pdt in ucla athletics tweet email print last week, bellerophon talked about the recent fall in both ticket sales  and overall athletic revenue, as well as the general stagnation in revenue as  compared to leading ncaa athletic programs.
while unc football is facing someserious charges from the ncaa which could affect the program in the short-term, and have not had a great deal of success in the sport, they have long been thought of as a "sleeping giant" in the college football world that has the ability and resources to become a factor in the acc and nationally.
aside from a couple of good years under steve spurrier in the '80's, the program has accomplished nothing, and has no real signs of life for the future.
likewise, the big east is known for its basketball prowess more than for football; while i noted that louisville looks to be the exception to the rule, the other big east basketball power (with a fbs-level football program) uconn took far less in donor revenue last year than did the conference's strongest public football school, west virginia.
i don't say this  to mean that another fluke 10-win season or beating southern cal the next  couple of years will suddenly open the financial floodgates, but that football  is the sport that drives everything else in a d-1a (fbs) athletic department-

revenue from ticket sales is one portion of athletic revenue where the  football powers have an advantage, given that even given the fewer number of  games (7-8 football home games, compared to 18-20 home games for a basketball  power), the massive, always sold-out stadiums bring in far more money than even  a sold-out dean dome or allen fieldhouse with triple the number of games.

while being one of the leaders in a revenue sport serves as a boost in prestige, football serves as a more significant boost to donor revenue.
on the draft board, unc came in 18th, right between oregon and stanford; despite duke's dominance in the world ofmarketing and revenue through basketball, they didn't go until #36.
with similar profiles in  basketball and non-revenue sports, and sharing the same media markets, there  really is one factor that would explain the value of unc to be so much higher  than that of duke.
likewise, the big east is known for its basketball prowess more  than for football; while i noted that louisville looks to be the exception to  the rule, the other big east basketball power (with a fbs-level football  program) uconn took far less in donor revenue last year than did the  conference's strongest public football school, west virginia.

the power of football.
this is considered to be very much a basketball conference, yet the largest level of contributions among public schools in the acc went to florida state, a school with (relatively) mediocre basketball but a strong football program over the past three decades.
a far more significant factor that distinguishes the major football schools  from the basketball powers is the level of private contributions to the  athletic department.
