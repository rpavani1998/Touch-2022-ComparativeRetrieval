millions of little kids can feel important and part of the team when there is no way they could ever play basketball or real football.
then the goalie kicks the ball back to the middle of the field and we start all over again.
they refuse to speak english.
ok i have checked to site.
and believe me the crowd doesnt like fake injuries aswell.
pm it is a cultural thing.
belgians, are surprisingly resilient.
my remarks may have indeed eeked a bit of disdain for soccer... because , yes, i do think it is boring.
anyway, tons of annoying, european people took the time to unhitch their oxen, and come in from the fields to "educate me" about soccer.
the problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time.
i guess football is a lot of strategy, like chess, but watching it is just about as interesting.
soccer doesn't have 10% the strategy of football, and i love both games.
am having played american football and being slightly familiar with rugby, i'd have to say that rugby is the sport for 'everybody'.
each side fights for the advantage, trying to dictate the play to the other team.
i don't think they have patrol boats off the coast of spain picking up flimsy rafts full of americans trying to sneak into europe so they can start a better life.
but i am an american at heart and if i were to watch something on tv it would probably be american football.
usually, it's only to say things like, "i was having trouble falling asleep last night, luckily espn2 was showing soccer."
but i am an american at heart and if i were to watch something on tv it would probably be american football.
in football most games end in the 20-10 points result and that is equivalent to 2-1 in soccer, and any leade is no sade, ask bayern levekuzen the german team who lost 2-1 after 1-0 lead to manchester united in the 90'th minute two goals were scored in less then a minute and that was in the champions league final of 1999.

it was about as enjoyable as soccer."
just for one of many things, in football players have more than one duty as well.
as for faking injuries - they do it in hoops too, and even in football you'll see wr's trying to draw interference calls.

even a superb athlete like randi moss would most probably look foolish trying to dribble a soccer ball.
pm no, sorry, soccer gamess do not have 4 goals on average.
every decision, stress about every injury, argue endlessly about a third and 5, and even build their own teams.
am thegreatgrundle, i can play your game aswell soccer has much more strategy then football, every player has many different taskes.
we didn't save your pusillanimous asses from hitler to put up with this kind of piss poor attitude.
since football plays happen every few minutes (ad space?) and last about fifteen seconds, i actually feel that the extended plays in soccer move a little faster and have players thinking on their feet, and they give me more time to see specific players in action.
and no lead is safe (ask oilers' fans).

there is nothing in soccer, nut even the best slide tackle, like seeing your team's linebacker break through the line and nail the qb.
you get nearly constant running as well as bonebreaking tackles.
soccer at it's very best is the finest game on earth.
i can compare them in the way of... how shall i put it, soccer looks better to the eye ?
am football (american rugby) is more fun to watch and futbawl (american soccer) is more fun to play.
and what makes it worse is that everyone knows that they're faking: the crowd, the other players, the coaches, the commentators, even the refs!
futbawl is better exercise, football has too many 'fine adjustments' in its rule books (but i'm still opposed to the infield fly rule!).
i do prefer playing soccer though.
it's like music - fluent, improvisational, thrilling...nothing in the world like it.
since i was allmost at a sleepless blackout when i watch the game, the only thing i remmember is that, the blue-black team was much better then the white red team.
the extra few feet behind the line give the qb an extra second or two to find a reciever before the defensive players get to him.
am i can appreciate football, but not love it.
the game isso slow, and i'm saying this as someone who is promoting a game with plays that last approximately 4 seconds.
in soccer, your options are, "well, i think we'll try to score 1 point, and if that fails, we'll try to score 1 point, but we can always go for 1 point."
one girl is kicking one girl is chasing...and the other girls are biting their nails.
like religion, your faviorite sport depends on where you are born.
if you don't want to give it your all, get off the field.
you don't give up until the qb takes a knee and says checkmate.
pm those are condescending comments, which basically state that soccer is more about social concerns than sports.
@richard quote: football (american rugby) is more fun to watch and futbawl (american soccer) is more fun to play.
it is a good thing that soccer is for millions of little kids...
the play is concentrated in the middle of the field, where the players give the ball back and forth to each other until someone breaks down the field and shoots the ball 20 feet wide of the net.
oh ok so it is better for a leading team to try running plays and a team with less points to try to make passes it saves the time because half the game is lost during the intervals.
every thing can happen in soccer.
but the scoring adds a whole new dimension to the game.
in soccer there are double passes ,headers, and the dribbles are much prettier and more sophisticated then holding the ball and running 40 yards.
pm i guess football is a lot of strategy, like chess, but watching it is just about as interesting.
another problem i have with soccer is the pace.
try to argue what sport is better on a south american or a european forum.
i didnt say i hate football, i am one of those few israelis who know the rules and sometimes i watch it on espn but to me soccer is the best sport.
but in soccer the game is continous and fast not like in football where plays as you said last 4 seconds, most of them fail, and bitween each play you need to wait a couple of minutes.
i played soccer as a kid, but never really got into it.
pm nyani, a good football (pigskin) game has like 10-15 plays that take your breath away, not one.
in soccer there are double passes ,headers, and the dribbles are much prettier and more sophisticated then holding the ball and running 40 yards.
i apologize if i offended you.
most soccer games have anywhere between 2.5-2.85 goals per game.
anyway, my chauffer is german and my bodyguards are all from belgium.
i remember when mls started, everyone said it would take off because a lot of people had played soccer as a kid, and loved the game.
on the other hand, the patriots beat injun nana last night, so i'll go with american football.
and what makes it worse is that everyone knows that they're faking: the crowd, the other players, the coaches, the commentators, even the refs!
2 goals are considered a nearly insurmountable lead, and a team with the lead is content to sit back and kill 50 minutes of the game.
i see 10x for the info i will look you up at walla, normally i dont go there, ynet is my port of call.
in football, on the other hand, each play is executed at full speed, with full effort.
i remember when mls started, everyone said it would take off because a lot of people had played soccer as a kid, and loved the game.

but in soccer the game is continous and fast not like in football where plays as you said last 4 seconds, most of them fail, and bitween each play you need to wait a couple of minutes.
any game that encourages someone to fake an injury pisses me off.
the rb has to guard against the blitz before he runs with the ball, the wr may have to block, and even offensive linemen have to both protect the quarterback and create holes for the runner.
millions of little kids can feel important and part of the team when [/b] there is no way they could ever play basketball or real football
the game is static more often then not on the meantime a below avarage soccer game bitween to israeli teams was more fluid.
the flopping in soccer is annoying, but that's why they have the very good rule nowadays of a yellow card for faking in the penalty area.

of course, i'm not big on either sport.
soccer at it's very best is the finest game on earth.
soccer is the ultimate fan game because the fans can also suggest and yell tactics to the coach, they can also swear freely on the coach the players and the other team coach and players as for the score, so what?

finally, i believe football is better, because it's the ultimate fan game.

i would restate your comment that favorite sports areusually dependent on our culture.
as for shot-gun - that's when the quarterback stands a few feet behind the center, not crouching directly behind him.
i had hardly ever heard of rugby before visiting new zealand now i like it as much if not more than american football.
i was watching the stanley cup playoffs last year, and some of the players started to pull that crap in order to get power plays.
like jazz or jazz influenced hip-hop.
you said that soccer is for little kids - meaning it's not for "real", grown-up athletes (contrary to the opinion of the vast majorityy of the world, of course...).
but maybe this is why i'll (and probably most americans) will always see soccer as a little kids game.
and i'm currently wat to out of shape to even worry about trying to find someone to play rugby with, but it is fun to think about.
if you don't want to give it your all, get off the field.
as for the pace, a good soccer game, has a very good pace, with allmost no stops, many passes and lots of attacks by both teams, while a football game as i said is divided in to short plays and most of them fail.

this is done in cases where the defense must gain quite a lot of yards in one play (say 3rd down and 8).

it's just not as interesting.

i watched the game bitween washington and tampa bay, and it just proved my point.

every play is a mini chess game, and requires much higher levels of thinking than soccer.
unfortunately, as i said, the rules currently discourage playing like that at the highest level.
but unlike religion sport is good.
you said "girls can play", as if they can't and don't play basketball as well.
watching these prima donnas flop around on the field because someone stepped on their toe makes me sick.
superior to actual europe in terms of rides, as well as buffets, both of these versions of europe include things that appear to be kryptonite to most real europeans; manners, toothpaste, and deodorant.
as for the pace, a good soccer game, has a very good pace, with allmost no stops, many passes and lots of attacks by both teams, while a football game as i said is divided in to short plays and most of them fail.
when it comes to sports, i'd like to see stuff that looks cool, that's what sports mean to me.
