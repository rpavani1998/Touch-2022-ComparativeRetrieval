while it is a distant second to football in cash flow generated, it is one of only two sports with a possibility of turning a significant profit.atlanta is a fertile field in which much basketball talent flourishes.at times the kids have played up to both talent and energy and we seemed to easily run away from a lot of teams, and at times we played flat and lost to plainly less talented teams.moreover, as evidenced by the recruiting class mark richt landed last month, a full house in stegeman coliseum when uncommitted football prep stars pay their last-minute visits to athens can be a powerful tool to use in persuading high school gridiron standouts to spend their college years playing in sanford stadium.we weren’t exactly recruiting the best and brightest when all of a sudden our academics came into question, and after suing the ncaa and them coming after us, i think a fear of don’t let problems in hoops kills the whole ad and football with it, led to a huge reduction in resources for that sport.here are five reasons why making the field of 68, even if only by the skin of their collective teeth, was tremendously important for the red and black: it helps a team to build up a track record of attending the tournament.it shows that we are, and helps to make us more, serious about basketball.it helps in recruiting.the more banners a program can hang, even in one-and-done seasons, the more name recognition it will have with the selection committee in marches to come.plus i need you to use your new found basketball acumen to help commentate the game (you really have made impressive progress).at times, especially early w/ full roster, the kids have come out w/ huge energy and confidence and looked like a contender.the university wasn’t nearly as profitable then as it is now and they weren’t about to sink any money into a program that, seemingly, no one really cared about.we also have good facilities.if anything, it was a bit of a badge of honor; being good at basketball was what thekentucky wildcats, the vanderbilt commodores, and the acc had to ease the pain of not being good at football.but honestly, i’d rather share the experience with everyone (win or lose) than have anyone not be able to experience what has been a rare occurence in georgia athletics.
