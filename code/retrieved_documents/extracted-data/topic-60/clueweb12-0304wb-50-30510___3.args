arguably one of the hottest teams in the country, one of the best running backs and they finished second in their conference, yet no bid.
i was out for a few days this week, and realized it's been a while since i offered up a blog.
-good move in my opinion by wku locking coach taggart up.
so without further adieu... -i think the fact that wku didn't get invited to a bowl game is a real shame.
he has had two top recruiting classes in the sun belt and the players all seem to have really bought into his message.
a rough start the wku men's basketball team has looked good in their last two wins.
-i think the wildcats will get a tougher game out of indiana on saturdayÂ than most people think.
iu gave coach tom crean time to build the program after it was decimated by kelvin sampson and it looks like they have finally turned the corner.

no reason to think he can't lead the hilltoppers to a number of conference championships.
taggart is also the highest paid employee at the university, which now makes football king at western.
no reason to think they won't be 6-6 going into the game against louisville.
