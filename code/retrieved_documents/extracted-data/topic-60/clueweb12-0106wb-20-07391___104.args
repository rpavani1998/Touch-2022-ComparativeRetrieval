in addition, the ncaa takes into consideration knowledge of the ncaa legislation at the time of the violation.
given that kanter played for fu during the period in which this was the specified rules, it was likely argued by uk that kanter be grandfathered in under the old interpretation, though he still was in violation of the rule in action, if not intent.

if even one dollar of that endorsement money comes from him playing football (whether it’s directly stated or just “understood” to be that way), it is an improper benefit.
for tennis players, the funding they receive comes from some national association, and people go out of their way to help them hide or deny any prize money they might have won.

this is the perfect year for cal to gamble a bit on a guy like kanter.

the only way the ncaa can ensure that doesn’t happen is to disallow all sponsorships.
but darn it, i just think drawing a line between a smarmy agent, or nike and reebok, and the professional team is just too neat and clean and doesn’t fairly deal with reality.
i thought he sat out last year because the ncaa hadn’t cleared him to play until this year and then they added the 9 games for the money.
according to my reading of 12.2.3.1, prior to this year, reasonable and necessary expenses were not allowed.
but the ncaa is noting if not consistent in applying their rules only to the sports for which they are directly applicable.
hopefully, uk has a much better idea than we do, because in the end, if the kanters and uk cannot resolve those concerns via prior precedent or new information, the committee on reinstatement is likely to reach the same conclusion the staff did, which is permanent ineligibility.

they seem correct to me and in line with the ncaa release that kanter received “payments above his actual expenses”.
now if patterson stayed then we have something.
"free enes"is on the lips of almost every kentucky fan in america, while at the same time, foreign players considering the possibility of playing for american ncaa-controlled universities must be thinking that this avenue is being forever closed, or at best very tightly restricted, before their very eyes.
the first group told uk their hands were tied, but that they would tell the second group to consider over ruling them.
i think they have a leg to stand on no matter what they decide, because the rules are so arbitrarily enforced that they can defend any decision they make.
i’m sure there are considerations that many of us have never thought of when it comes to managing rides..but nonetheless we are always happy to offer our “two-cents” worth.
though i’d prefer uk and kanter to “win” on whatever basis they can, the ncaa can certainly make a logical case in either direction.
if it is a rule in tennis and not a rule in basketball, they just don’t care about how that looks to laypersons like us.
the colleges themselves have made these rules.
this team could be awesome.
i understand your reasoning, but the ncaa has been consistent in the way they insulate sports from each other.
you can be the greatest coach in the game, but if nobody listens, it doesn’t matter.

every one of them could elect to go to another school without penalty, but they realize that they’ll get just as much tv time (if that’s what they want) or the opportunity to compete at the same level sans bowl game even if they stay.
using impermissible benefits to commit another violation of the rules only exacerbates the offense.
the ncaa will likely never be perceived by fans as reasonable.
you can always couch facts into an argument that makes perfect sense if you ignore the details and stick with the big picture.
yes, i know all about the $20k that the kanters spent on education, but since that was done outside the rules, it is easy to see that the committee may not be willing to just forget about that fact.
again, i am not wishing for another coach by any means.
the ncaa is well within a reasonable reading of the rules to declare him permanently ineligible, as they have.
but maybe mitch could hire an “in-game” assistant that could teach coach a thing or two.
the fans also have an interest, both financially and emotionally, although that interest is so diluted by comparison to the institutions that their power is almost impossible to muster except in very rare situations.
that’s contrary to rule 12.1.2.1.3.1, which says rather clearly (after several readings) that professional sports teams/organationzations may notprovide educational expenses or services to prospective student-athletes.
i hope it doesn’t happen come tourney time, but watch the first 3 minutes of the game and tell me if unc’s game plan wasn’t perfectly clear.
duke was one miracle heave of a basketball away from going home runners-up.
i never had any idea how much money i made, because it was handled 100% by my parents.

no, if they suspend kanter at all it will be for 9 games plus repayment, the prescribed penalty for impermissible benefits over $1000.

there is no real doubt that if vast numbers of fans across the country tried to affect ncaa regulations by acting as a cohesive whole, they could.
sorry, but i think you have misread the bylaws, and i was wrong when i said they are stricter on some sports than others.
cal has not actually had time to really “rebuild” the uk program.
i would like to see an example where the ncaa told a player they had to sit out of games in the midst of their season because there was an investigation in which they haven’t found evidence that the student was in violation of any ncaa rule.
so far, all you’ve done is make a bunch of claims of hypocrisy, but it turns out those charges aren’t demonstrably accurate.

my own thought: if one thinks that the urgency of the sec championship game and its likely impact on the bcs title didn’t influence the newton decision then that person is deserving of the naif of the year award — so much for the inscrutable ncaa.
they all knowingly and blantantly broke the rules.
even participating in what the ncaa deemed a professional league, without receiving payment of any kind, resulted in a lengthy suspension.

and if you watched cal’s comments after the game, he clearly said he told his guys not to foul zeller, and they did anyway.
i think it is more difficult for the ncaa to rule him eligible and be perceived as reasonable by the member schools than it is to rule him ineligible.
this kind of reasoning is exactly why i think kanter has a better shot in the appeals committee: let the members directly decide the outcome and set the precedent.
a sea of blue -- kentucky sports for the discerning fan by glenn logan on dec 8, 2010 1:13 pm est up reply actions i think one of cal’s greatest strengths is getting his players to listen to him and turning a bunch of kids used to playing for themselves into playing as a unit and for a team.
after the staff’s initial decision, calipari mentioned how the kanter’s didn’t know it was wrong to use the money that way.
"  the logic of this is that his family was handling the finances, and it is rational to think that enes would not be aware of how much money was needed for actual and necessary expenses since he wasn't paying the bills.
it was great to visit with cawood for every game, but… blue... there is no other color to bleed !!!
they could plough new ground here under the rubric of the new rule never having been applied, and the lack of prior precedent.
kentucky helps make these rules.
the ncaa’s ruling is very rarely about student-athletes.
going through the list of the top 5 ranked ncaa men, and crossing it with the atp (professional tennis) website, i get this: john-patrick smith (australian)- $3,596 earnings on tour henrique cunha (brazilian) $6,009 bradley klahn (us born)- $34,945 guillermo gomez (spain)- $6,022 chase buchanan (us)- $43,000 and that atp site only shows earnings from elite-level, atp tour events.
they could always turn the offender in.
kanter's parents applied any moneys in excess of expenses to young enes' education, or sequestered it in a separate account for appropriate disposition according to their perception of ncaa rules.

the money kanter took in excess benefits was comparatively trivial, especially considering most of it was used for education, a defined exception in the bylaws, even if the execution was flawed.

if that’s not good enough proof to the ncaa that kanter meant to stay amateur, then no player good enough to enter a european or south american club system (the only developmental system available to them) will ever be able to play.
the reality, though, is that the member universities are the ones who elect the body and pay their salary.
now, if the member institutions get up in arms about some enforcement action in enough numbers, it will matter.
