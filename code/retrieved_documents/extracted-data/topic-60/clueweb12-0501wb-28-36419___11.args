:-) a sea of blue -- kentucky sports for the discerning fan by glenn logan on nov 7, 2011 8:12 am est up reply actions being a uk football fan relates to being a woman in a man’s world.
assuming the $820 million figure reasonably reflects the university’s fair claim on the state’s bonding capacity, something i’m not willing to concede, anecdotal evidence suggests any bonding proposals by the university for uk athletics are not being warmly received in frankfort.

for basketball, it would yield money immediately after a new arena was put into service.
you will have to trust me on that.
however, such an investment on the part of the uk would be costly.
so i was going to have to move anyway, by oldkentucky on nov 7, 2011 2:58 am est reply actions the fact that you were an out-of-state student means you were a profit center for the university.
they have to have the ability to borrow money, and that province is reserved to a board of trustees that is very reluctant to dole out the ability to borrow cash to athletics.
kentucky is supposed to be an academic institution first, and it looks to me like they are putting their money where their mission is.
we need to maximize our current situation first – we have to fill the stadium for games by raising the level of play and giving the fans a reason to go to the game and back the program with dollars.
i knew that athletics dept gave money back to uk, but what i didn’t know was that we are theonly sec team to do so… but only at uk is athletics required to help fund the university at its own peril
by teamweaver on nov 7, 2011 5:57 am est up reply actions imo, the place to start is with this number… “in the decade of this ad’s tenure, the trustees received $820 million in bonding debt authority.”
the new boards and sound upgrades at least something.
uk football on the other hand can’t have a down year, or the fans go away again.
so far, no one seems to be willing to look farther than next weekdown the road.
add in concessions, parking and souvenirs and you easily get to $3 million dollars.
i will point out, though, that “if we build it, they will come” is probably wishful thinking when it comes to football.
they’ll increase the money as needed to keep us “respectable” in the sec.
of course, it isn't the whole story, but the reality is that kentucky cannot fund major projects like a stadium renovation entirely out of private funds.
i think respectable to them will mean an occasional lower tier bowl appearance and a .500 record, with a couple of sec wins.
on the one hand a new hospital, on the other a new football stadium.
after all, the bottom line is raising more money for everything – football, basketball, field hockey, the university, the albert b. chandler and the like.
in sum, it is a much longer-term roi on football compared to basketball, even though the numbers are much bigger in the end.
alabama and florida and tennessee football fans are like that — they will fill their stadiums regardless (especially since they probably know that if the team does really badly, they’ll get a new coach).
suffice it to say that the football program has a lot of competition for the dollars it needs to upgrade facilities.
of course, it isn't the whole story, but the reality is that kentucky cannot fund major projects like a stadium renovation entirely out of private funds.
i also think a lot of people might owe him an apology.
the basketball program is the sacred cow at kentucky, and it will get what it needs one way or the other.
while such a sum would be enough to build a new basketball arena or renovate commonwealth, it probably couldn’t do both and certainly couldn’t cover the full cost of building a new football stadium.
i woke up feeling blue this morning.
so, even if bonds could be used to finance these smaller projects, payments of interest and principal would cut directly into the funds available to distribute to the university.
honestly, i’ve looked and i can’t find a good figure for the actual revenue directly attributable to commonwealth stadium or rupp arena
if we’re not filling the current stadium, don’t even think about building a new one – it makes no economic sense.
that would suggest it is in the university’s best interest to invest in developing the necessary facilities for uk athletics independent of what such an investment might mean for the competitive success of the football and basketball teams.
as you can well believe, there are no budget surpluses at uk and the administration has already built the funds coming from uk athletics into their long-term budget projections, probably into perpetuity.
war is god's way of teaching americans geography.
mitch tries hard, i am positive, he really is a football guy.
it would be the university or non-revenue sports that would shoulder the cuts to finance any new construction.

- george orwell by wild weasel on nov 7, 2011 11:33 am est reply actions that uk would be left out.
i fully expect the idea of “super conferences” to evolve into an actuality — most likely when the economy has returned to something near normal — and i don’t think it’s an impossibility that uk would be left out of such groups if it doesn’t have a similar evolution of its football program to match the standards of funding, facilities, etc.
i am away at a funeral, so i didn’t see it earlier.
even though the new facilities would be expected to support the cost of their own bond service once built, the initial cost of bonds during the 2 – 3 years of construction and any startup phase would have to be paid by the university.
a combination arena/stadium might be the only way to get football facilities upgraded.
and i think you would have to assume that at current ticket prices, as i don’t know that improved play could justify higher prices among the current fanbase.
many of us have lamented kentucky's apparent lack of support for the football program, and pointed the finger mostly at the athletics department.
more money and bonding capacity would have to be found.
i encourage each and every one of you who have wondered about what structural problems hold back uk from creating the kinds of programs we see everywhere around the sec to read matt's post and the herald-leader article.
but, tucked away in that huge cost center that is uk, you find that uk athletics is a ‘profit center,’ not only paying its own way but actually throwing off $20 million in diverted revenue to the university.
display: expanded collapsed bring good students.
kentucky is supposed to be an academic institution first, and it looks to me like they are putting their money where their mission is.
for football to make more moolah than basketball and get a lot less payback.
similar estimates, but even more lucrative, suggest a new basketball arena modeled on the nba archetype could be expected toquadruple the revenue of rupp.
the flip side to that is that the potential cash cow that is the athletics department, and in particular, the football program, is getting starved for money.
i can only say it’s disappointing and even a bit amazing that we find ourselves in this position.

i only had a few schools that taught my subject.
on the other hand, bonding capacity can be found for the new university of kentucky albert b. chandler hospital.
"man i don't want to talk about guys (moss) who left us, you know.
any bonds sold to finance the construction of new facilities would have to be amortized over the term of the bonds – interest and principal.
it may be that is the main factor holding football back.
i totally agree with glenn in that we cannot simply build a new stadium with the “build it and they will come” rationale.
interest rates are low but so are state revenues.
further, anecdotal estimates suggest that a new football stadium could expect todouble the revenue currently earned by commonwealth stadium.
we (these schools) would be begging almost any conference for admittance.
by kywineman on nov 7, 2011 11:48 am est up reply actions as ww points out addressing mega super-confernces.
to obtain a roi, someone must be first interested in making the investment.
i simply don’t see the economics working to convince the trustees to put more money into football.
at first glance, even for the rabid fans of the bbn, the choice seems reasonably straight forward.
if they are going to sink more money into athletics, it’s going to be into basketball, where there is a virtual guaranteed roi.
i do expect that sports economics (read: football becoming the overriding factor in reorganization) will eventually force the university to rethink its priorities.
thus they would join other basketball-first schools such as duke, indiana, kansas, memphis, vanderbilt, villanova, perhaps even uconn and syracuse, and those that do not field fb teams: georgetown, st. john’s, et al.
the rupp situation will be fixed, the commonwealth situation will not.
at an average ticket price of, say, $40 that comes to $2.4 million dollars.
you assume that putting more money into recruiting and more money into facilities that are not a stadium will improve the level of play enough to fill commonwealth stadium game after game.
those schools will throw money at their football programs because the fans make it a priority, and because, like uk basketball, it’s a virtual guaranteed money-maker.
that elevated level of play and increased interest in the football program has a tremendous impact on the economics.

matt jones at ksr highlighted an important piece at the herald-leader, where a uk trustee explains in detail most of the reasons uk doesn't spend the cash to upgrade the facilities to sec level.
if basketball wants a new arena, they will eventually get one, and we both know this.
the basketball program is the sacred cow at kentucky, and it will get what it needs one way or the other.
" "in times of universal deceit, telling the truth will be a revolutionary act."
i am sure he has begged and begged for more leash to spend more on football.
plus, building a team in the sec to the level that would fully leverage a new or substantially upgraded stadium is a dicey proposition at best – the competition is not going to just sit back and say, “look, kentucky’s trying to compete in football, too.
but i’m willing to bet doubling and quadrupling it is a big number with a similar impact on the amount contributed by uk athletics to the university.
on one hand it assumes filling the stadium for each game on the rosy assumption but it also doesn’t take into account higher seat prices justified with a better product, increases in the blue white fund requirements, increases in alumni donations to the school and all of the incremental boost in revenue that comes with a successful program and the positive national press that derives from success.
at current tax free bond yields, the $20 million currently diverted to the university could be expected to support approximately $570 million in 30-year bonds.
simplistically, if you had $3 million dollars extra a year you could afford $30 million dollars of expense and have 10% return on your investment and these days 10% looks pretty damn good.
yes, basketball is king at uk but i and a few others will always be the squeaky wheels.

they could just walk away from the sec couldn’t they – what’s to stop them – loyalty, that’s a joke when it comes to greed and power.
a conference full of great teams cannibalizes itself in football.
reality suggests the university’s bonding needs are limited by the competing requirements of the various political constituencies under the commonwealth’s umbrella debt service capacity.
i would simply like to see more spent on football recruiting and football player facilities; not necessarily to be equal with the top sec programs like florida and alabama but several levels above our current state.
but, imo, that would be a short sighted perspective.
this is simple economics, you have to spend money to make money and this is a very basic look.

that answer might not necessarily mean more money to athletics.
football would take at least five years to take hold after construction, just because watching a relatively uncompetitive team, even from new seats, won’t materially increase revenue.
lexington, the city, will make it happen.
more butts in the seats means increases gate revenue, parking revenue, concessions, jerseys, donations to athletics and donations to the general fund.
and no matter what the team did last year, rupp is filled to the brim.
however, attracting more in-state students actually expands the tuition/cost deficit that state funding has to fill and more students in general further increases the demand pressure on the commonwealth’s limited bonding capacity to expand dorms, classrooms, etc. – accentuating the funding problem for uk athletics.
having discussed the big ticket items above, a large number of the projects kentucky athletics would like to build would be much smaller and, although geared toward improving recruiting or the competitive success of our various teams, they wouldn’t be expected to materially bring more money into uk athletics.
just taking this years attendance figures we’ve left about 60000 seats empty for the six games held at commonwealth and we still have another home game on the schedule.
imo this could happen and the sec be left with the remaining schools who are the perennial cellar dwellers.
the flip side to that is that the potential cash cow that is the athletics department, and in particular, the football program, is getting starved for money.
if i had listened, i wouldn’t be here today, living and dying, with the choices i made i guess we now know how things really are in a lot of ways.
