an 8,000 seat fieldhouse is irrellevant compared to the other revenue sources.his assistants make more than some head coaches, fan support is constant and consistent, administrative support has been excellent, and there’s the whole issue of that new basketball training facility.we can, now, have quality proven coaches competing to come here.the programs aren’t close to comparable on a fiscal, record, or tradition sense.no university official in this country makes any hiring decision with an eye toward weakening a rival.surgeon general's warning: k-state-mizzou basketball may increase the risk of high blood pressure.at that point in our history, we were still hamstrung by an administration that didn’t care if ksu played in the big time athletically.if he leaves manhattan for non-competitive salaries, dismal fan support at all times, competition with pro sports, an administration that looks at basketball as a third-tier sport, and aging/run down facilities, i will be flabbergasted.but it’s intellectually a bit silly and lazy to a) assume that if frank leaves, he was never loyal; b) think that leaving is an immoral or unethical choice; c) claim that k-state and the wildcats are “loyal” to him, (rather than just valuing a winning coach); or d) try to pretend that you wouldn’t under any circumstances resign your current job to get more money to live where you really, really would rather be living.until i hear a credible report (read: an actual journalist) that frank is even on miami’s list, i’m going with katz’s report and simple logic — miami won’t make the financial commitment necessary to attract martin because it’s never cared about basketball.i’d move back there to coach a 1a school—especially if my town’s school had instability in administration, crappy fan support, terrible facilities, and no basketball tradtion.parrish’s article is based on the premise that miami has the money (i’m thinking around an additional $7 million a year with upgrades to salaries and general basketball expenses – not to mention the huge money to upgrade/buildi facilities) and the support to do both.honor exists among thieves, not coaches.media is now simply a profit center – it is no longer a public service…it wasn’t even given a proper burial – it was just left cold and lifeless in the gutter.by k. scott bailey on apr 7, 2011 1:04 pm cdt up reply actions the idea that the miami job, even with a “commitment to the basketball program” and including a large financial incentive would be a better spot for martin (even with his ties to miami) than what he’s got here, is asinine.
