even though the nets do have a minimal amount of wins, deron has successfully made other players better with his passing ability.all of which are extremely talented scorers.while westbrook outscores williams, he has nowhere close to the amount of assists.also, turnovers have proven to be a very big problem for westbrook thus far.currently the new jersey nets sit tied with the raptors for last in the atlantic division with just a mere 16 wins.however, looking at his stats, they can’t be saying that because of his scoring ability; as it is average at best with 12.7ppg.nets rookie marshon brooks is averaging 12.8 ppg, big man kris humphries is averaging 13.5 ppg, and guard anthony morrow is averaging 12.6 ppg.while there is no doubt that chris paul and derrick rose hold the top two when ranking point guards, the next three players have not been as clear.russell westbrook is averaging 24 ppg, 4.5 rpg, and 5.4 apg.this is because he is playing besides arguably one of the best players in the nba in kevin durant.as you can see, deron’s great passing capability has made everyone around him look better.on top of that he is averaging a very respectable 22 ppg.unlike deron williams, rondo is playing amongst three arguable future hall of famers in paul pierce, ray allen, and kevin garnett.up to this point, deron williams is averaging 21.9 ppg, 3.3 rpg, and 8.2 apg.rajon rondo is averaging 12.7 ppg, 4.7 rpg, and 10.7 apg.
