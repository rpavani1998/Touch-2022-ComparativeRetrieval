georgetown probably would have bumped one of them, but i was trying to tie the kings/barons list to conference realignment, so ruled out the non-fbs programs from consideration.
as to the  target schools, you might be able to expand that to include potential 16 team  leagues: pac 12: texas, oklahoma, tag-alongs accepted as long as  texas is in the package acc: notre dame, pick-em big 12: florida  state, clemsonm louisville, cincy, afa, byu sec: florida state, clemson,  wvu, oklahoma, texas b1g: notre dame, pick-em (as long as academics are  respectable) both the pac 12, b1g and the acc are more limited by  geography, though this limitation is self imposed by the respective conference.
again, anyone who wants to make their own lists, i have no problem with that.
state have  both flirted with baron status in the past but don't make the grade now.

the big xii has no place to go if either the sec or the pac 12 are successful.
maybe add georgetown to the barons list.

the pac-12,  despite it's great tv contracts knows that it needs to expand at some point  since they only have 1 football king.
it's just that the feeling isn't mutual, especially by texas.
for the latter i am not including non-fbs playing members suchas georgetown, villanova, and marquette which would all be at least baron status.
my list wasn't meant to be the be-all and end-all on the discussion, just a starting point.

also, i tried to balance the two kings list with 13 programs each.
i am more hopeful  that the acc is rising with fsu looking better every year, syracuse actually  playing competitive football again.

with one league having three kings and four barons and the other having four kings, one baron, and two knights that could rise to baron status in michigan state and iowa, they may choose to do so, but they don't need to.
the b1g did flirt with texas but rejected any tag-alongs that would tarnish their academic image (ou, ttech, and/or osu).

the big 12 - florida state and clemson
* several acc teams were once kings but have fallen to baron (clemson & ga tech) or lower (pittsburgh).
today's landscape pretty much ensures conferences will be looking to extend beyond their supposed geography of yesteryear.
also, i'd add temple to the fbs football fielding basketball barons list.
the  pac-12 - texas and oklahoma the acc - notre dame the big 12 -  florida state and clemson ultimately, for the acc (since this is an  acc board), the league truly needs fsu and miami to get back to being kings on  the field as well as off the field.

the listing you have, especially below the  kings, is very fluid and can change in a couple of short years.
as for the basketball list, basketball is such a different mindset - i don't know how you can make a kings and barons list and not include programs like g-town, butler, xavier, and
as i said, the list isn't perfect but on the flip side my thinking included the following...
i am more hopeful that the acc is rising with fsu looking better every year, syracuse actually playing competitive football again.
both the pac 12, b1g and the acc are more limited by geography, though this limitation is self imposed by the respective conference.
florida as a king too looks suspect.
so georgia, if it were to go on a hot streak for 5-7 years and win another nc they would quickly be elevated back to king (if they aren't a king already), but oregon would need probably two decades or more at their current level with at least 2 ncs to reach king level.
it's just that the feeling isn't mutual, especially by  texas.

without that, we're no better than the big east, who will have a regular top ten program among their ranks soon.
cheers, re: revisiting kings and barons  both football and basketball nice thread.
the acc on the otherhand is well positioned as a 12 team league if fsu or clemson (or both) were to leave.
knock yourselves out.
the big 12 and the sec are more willing to go beyond what would be considered their "region".

i think the pac-12 desperately wants to extend beyond their current geography to get into both texas and oklahoma, moreso the former than the latter.
the acc and big 12 are in similar situations, although the latter's two kings are more stable than the acc's, the acc's barons are more plentiful.
the acc on the otherhand is well positioned as a 12 team leagueif fsu or clemson (or both) were to leave.
they were the last two to make my kings bb list, but i think they have enough separation from the other barons.
the b1g did flirt with texas but rejected any  tag-alongs that would tarnish their academic image (ou, ttech, and/or osu).
it also gives us insight into why the  conferences not named the sec and the big have targeted who they have targeted  for any remaining expansion.
and this time i would like  to add a separate listing of kings and barons in basketball as well.
and unless ucla finds their pete carroll that isn't changing in a hurry.

they should be in a category above the kings.

i see missouri as more big ten country than sec, but then it took the sec some time to decide upon #14 after they couldn't persuade two other logical geographical extensions as takers (a team from virginia or a team from north carolina).
