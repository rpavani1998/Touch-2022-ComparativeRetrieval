rodriguez intends to give all three players significant playing time.sheridan isn’t the most overwhelming talent, but he has the advantage of experience and age, and will be a factor.forcier is the brother of former michigan and stanford qb jason, and he’s an impressive all-round talent – the likely long term starter from the group.given that you’ll have a sense of how much i have enjoyed the last year or two of football, and the last decade of basketball.robinson is an athletic freak with a weird habit – he hasn’t tied up his cleats since he was seven years old.if you haven’t been keeping track, michigan’s biggest problem right now is quarterback – i.e. they really don’t have one.as you probably know if you have read this blog much i am a diehard michigan fan – the kind that bleeds maize and blue.have us write for your website advertising rates contact the handicappers i’m not sure that 3 is better than 1 as you probably know if you have read this blog much i am a diehard michigan fan – the kind that bleeds maize and blue.they were spoiled by four good years from chad henne, but he’s now in his second year as backup with the dolphins, and a void was left in his stead.i have no respect at all for the irish, and i want to beat them senseless.uber frosh ryan mallett was supposed to be the answer as a sophomore last year, but he made a knee jerk reaction and left as soon as rodriguez was hired because he didn’t think he fit in with the system.i don’t think you can qb by committee against legitimate teams.all that being said, i still think we will win 8 or 9 games this year.i won’t feel as comfortable in that, though, if we have yet to make a qb decision.the being said, the press conference by coach rich rodriguez today pretty much terrified me.
