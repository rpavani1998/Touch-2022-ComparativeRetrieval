belgians, are surprisingly resilient.
however, soccer is very rarely at its  very best nowadays, due to the reluctance of the calcified fifa to make  necessary rule changes, whereas football is currently tweaked nearly to  perfection.
my remarks may have indeed eeked a bit of disdain for soccer... because , yes, i do think it is boring.
anyway, tons of annoying, european people took the time to unhitch their oxen, and come in from the fields to "educate me" about soccer.
the  problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a  killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short  like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time.
i guess football is a lot of strategy, like chess, but watching it is  just about as interesting.
soccer doesn't have 10% the strategy of football, and i love both games.

in football most games end in the 20-10 points result and  that is equivalent to 2-1 in soccer, and any leade is no sade, ask bayern  levekuzen the german team who lost 2-1 after 1-0 lead to manchester united in  the 90'th minute two goals were scored in less then a minute and that was in  the champions league final of 1999.
and a touchdown isn't even worth 7 points.

there is nothing in soccer, nut even the best slide tackle, like seeing your team's linebacker break through the line and nail the qb.
it's like the love/hate child of soccer and  football.
you get nearly constant running as well as bonebreaking tackles.

there is no argument.
futbawl is better exercise, football has too many 'fine adjustments' in its rule books (but i'm still opposed to the infield fly rule!).
i do prefer playing soccer though.
it's like music - fluent, improvisational,  thrilling...nothing in the world like it.
since i was allmost at a sleepless blackout when i watch the game, the only thing i remmember is that, the blue-black team was much better then the white red team.
the extra few feet behind the line give the qb an extra second or two to find a reciever before the defensive players get to him.

oh ok so it is better for a leading team to try running plays and a team with less points to try to make passes it saves the time because half the game is lost during the intervals.
every thing can happen in soccer.
but the scoring adds a whole new dimension to the game.
in soccer there are  double passes ,headers, and the dribbles are much prettier and more  sophisticated then holding the ball and running 40 yards.

do you go for the win by scoring a more difficult td, or do you take the sure  points with a fg?

2 goals are considered a nearly insurmountable lead, and a team with the lead is content to sit back and kill 50 minutes of the game.

do you try to win/tie in one possession, or trust your defense to get the ball  back so you can win in two?
as for fluency -it's a different tempo altogether.
any game that encourages someone to  fake an injury pisses me off.
the rb has to guard against the blitz before he runs with the ball, the wr may  have to block, and even offensive linemen have to both protect the quarterback  and create holes for the runner.

each play is a battle of wits between the offense and the defense.
so both teams are trying to do the same thing regardless.

however, soccer is very rarely at its very best nowadays, due to the reluctance of the calcified fifa to make necessary rule changes, whereas football is currently tweaked nearly to perfection.
but other than that i think it's pointless, and much too far to be of any use to anyone.
with football you get  one amazing play in the course of a game, and it gets on the replays all night.
another  problem i have with soccer is the players.
which fortunately, is not often.
ofcourse that every play is bitween the offence and defence.
just for one of many things, in football players have more than one duty as well.

when it comes to sports, i'd like to see stuff that looks cool, that's what sports mean to me.
10x so... what is the shot-gun defence from "remmember the titans" with denzel washington?

we always like what is ours best.
quentin griffin would probably have done well, though, had he played from an early age.
and what do  you mean, "what strategy is there in football?"?

if only they'd stop the game less (say by 30% or so).

finally, i believe football is better, because it's the ultimate fan game.
soccer is just never going to cut it in america !
so both teams are trying to do  the same thing regardless.
you said "cute little uniforms", as if other sports don't have those.

are you really trying to argue that "cute little uniforms" isn't a put-down?
or, "how did it feel when that rabid badger bit you in the face?
@richard quote: football (american rugby) is more fun to watch and futbawl (american soccer) is more fun to play.
that's why i go for more obscure stuff like aikido, lacrosse, wakeboarding and whatnot.
they can get good exercise and wear a cute uniform and its is great for them.
not to mention the fact that like all of my employees, any of them trying to speak directly to me will be taken away and fed to the hounds.

how many fantasy soccer leagues are out there?
20 refrigirators of a people collide with each other while to qb either choose to pass a line backer?
to me rugby is a real man's game, though i cannot necessarily say that i would play for the bingham cup in the uk.

in football, on  the other hand, each play is executed at full speed, with full effort.
gah, and i thought baseball was bad for schedules.
you have nothing that we want.
but football has aesthetically pleasing elements and primally-appealing elements that soccer simply doesn't.
it's like music - fluent, improvisational, thrilling...nothing in the world like it.
do you try to win/tie in one possession, or trust your defense to get the ball back so you can win in two?
i don't mean to start a flame war in the sports forum, but the way i see it, that's what you're doing.
lacrosse takes the  cake.
the rb has to guard against the blitz before he runs with the ball, the wr may have to block, and even offensive linemen have to both protect the quarterback and create holes for the runner.
kids simply don't have the mental and physical skills necessary to play football the way it's supposed to be played, although just playing flag football, or everybody-run-down-the-field-and-i'll-throw-it football, was always a lot of fun.
you have to anticipate what your enemy is going to bring, and choose your own strategy accordingly, all before the ball is snapped.
i guess there are some good things about europe, like eurodisney, and i hear they've built a hard rock cafe.
all in all i think it is a colture thing.
when i walk through my estate it's like a tour of europe.
i threw up and then cursed the  soccer gods for their unholy influence on a once noble sport!
a really good rushing or kick-return td is every bit as beautiful as a great slalom goal.

if you must believe they were condescending then so be it.
as for the players, most players dont fake injuries, infact if a player is  catched by the referee he gets a yellow card.
fans can track every minute detail of their teams, second-guess
"we call it football because we use our feet."

the stanley cup playoffs are the greatest sports event of the year.
i understand that most europeans hate americans.
kids simply don't have the mental and physical skills necessary  to play football the way it's supposed to be played, although just playing flag  football, or everybody-run-down-the-field-and-i'll-throw-it football, was  always a lot of fun.
and i'm currently wat to out of shape to even worry about trying to find someone to play rugby with, but it is fun to think about.
and how could anyone compare the dangers of a soccer match with that of a football game?
then the  goalie kicks the ball back to the middle of the field and we start all over  again.
try to argue what sport is better on a south american or a european forum.
that's why i go for more obscure  stuff like aikido, lacrosse, wakeboarding and whatnot.
ron member member # 1698 posted september 11, 2004 12:02 am i prefer watching crickett to baseball, but american football to soccer.
the problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time.
you have to anticipate what your enemy is going to bring,  and choose your own strategy accordingly, all before the ball is snapped.
since football  plays happen every few minutes (ad space?) and last about fifteen seconds, i  actually feel that the extended plays in soccer move a little faster and have  players thinking on their feet, and they give me more time to see specific  players in action.
but hardly condescending .i did say it was just my opinion.
futbawl is better exercise, football has too many 'fine adjustments' in its  rule books (but i'm still opposed to the infield fly rule!).
but maybe this is why i'll (and probably most americans) will always see soccer as a little kids game.
and the ones who do speak english speak it poorly or with a funny accent.
and they do feel important.
then again,  since football is so much more difficult and intricate, maybe you can't truly  enjoy it until you reach the highest levels, i.e. pro, college, or to a lesser  degree high school (i never made it past middle school.
as for the "couldn't play basketball or reall football" - just as most soccer players couldn't play high level basketball or football, the reverse is also true.
soccer is for little kids.
the play is concentrated in the middle of the field,  where the players give the ball back and forth to each other until someone  breaks down the field and shoots the ball 20 feet wide of the net.
all in all i think it is  a colture thing.
i would ask them, but like i said they all speak gibberish.
the motion itself is not as challenging, because a rusher doesn't need to control the ball with his feet, but he is eluding full contact.
like religion, your faviorite sport depends on where you are born.
why, the freakin' matches
(it was near cleves ... and gary was more fun  than m-g).
those were my nice serious comments.

and believe me the crowd doesnt like fake injuries aswell.
i, for one, prefer football over soccer for some of the following reasons: football has more strategy.
with football you get one amazing play in the course of a game, and it gets on the replays all night.
am                        football (american rugby) is  more fun to watch and futbawl (american soccer) is more fun to play.

football is a strategic war between two teams of highly specialized players.

pm football...soccer...
where's the hubbub over beckham  2005?
the redskins-tampa game is about to start on fox sports (59 on sattelite, 60 on cable).
another problem i have with soccer is the pace.
oh and girls can play.
football stops by design.
but most of the people like the team their father liked, and stuff like that.
that is great and they do wear cute little uniforms and yes girls get to play.
we are certainly influenced heavily by it, but not absolutly determined.
there are a few people who go against their family wishes or colture idioms every where.
then again, since football is so much more difficult and intricate, maybe you can't truly enjoy it until you reach the highest levels, i.e. pro, college, or to a lesser degree high school (i never made it past middle school.
i actually agree with that.
and i'll bet i'm one of the few  around here who was ever there!
