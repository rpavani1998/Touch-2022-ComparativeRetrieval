i'd say the biggest obstacle facing minnesota is lack of fan support.
can’t sell 7-5, 8-4, 9-3 when the twins are challenging in the central and the vike’s are competing for nfc titles, even though the gopher’s seasons are laying a foundation for future success.
i suppose it's a fair trade with minnesota.
minnesota just built itself a shiny new stadium, and if you went to the nebraska game this year, you know it's a pretty nice place to watch football.
the game sucks from my perspective.
i see no reason why we can’t because i think we have that passion to be better, to not settle.
if you don't' support the team you're not going to sway the recruits you need to consistently have a winner.
we can’t really get rid of the men’s team, given that it makes money and that funds other sports that don’t.
take everything i've just said about minnesota football and apply it to husker men's basketball.
i spent the better part, lol, of 3 years in lincoln and in my experience the answer is, other than the athlethes of other sports and their friends, no. by conspiracy* on feb 9, 2012 3:47 pm cst reply actions i guess what i’m saying is that if men’s basketball is to change, that attitude has to change.
if what i think about us is true, i think we can succeed and eventually reach a level where we are in the top 25 year in and year out.
the star tribune had an article about it, and tubby smith headed back north insisting that the gophers need to upgrade their facilities.
take everything i've just said about minnesota football and apply it to husker men's basketball.
what i hope is that nebraskans have a slightly different mindset about success, enough to want to strive to be the best regardless.
if you ask, minnesota would say they've made a commitment to having a good football team.
why minnesota may never be good at football (and how that relates to nebraska basketball) by jon johnston on feb 9, 2012 8:02 am cst in nebraska husker basketball tweet email print if there was one good thing that happened regarding nebraska's game against minnesota last sunday, it was that minnesota's staff came away from lincoln, nebraska blown away by their tour of thehendricks training complex.
make the fans pay to see the 13th-ranked women, and let ’em in free to watch the boys.
minnesota has to get people into the mode that they're going to have some patience and let things work, but mostly, they're going to have to get over the fickle nature of "i'll go when they're good enough".
we are incredibly inelastic when it comes to quality.
with basketball you are only starting 5 players and with one or two really good recruits/players you can easily build a good run and progress from there.
they had limited success with this with mason (nebraska may remember from similar success at kansas), but instead of allowing mason to build on this, they fire him.
i just wish we'd quit giving ourselves so many learning opportunities.
it sure as hell beats the old metrodome, which was like watching football at a rest home, or inside a toilet, whichever comparison you like best.
google's homepage celebrates too much shit.
if you attended last night’s men’s game, your ticket gets you in free for tonight’s women’s game.
i’m not trying to be rude, but it’s a standard to say no one cares.
the successful learn from their failures.
look at nebraska - the huskers stolelydon murtha and nate swift from minnesota largely because of the lincoln game day environment.
because what we have with football is pretty unique and something a program really can never expect, for honestly, i think we accept alot of crap from our fb program.
mason couldn’t spell “defense”, and i hear that it’s an important part of the game.
the football team has been bad for years, seeing some success under glen mason, but dropping below ground in the tim brewster era.

poor non-conference schedules, poor teams with cahallan and solich, and we still attend and watch.
time will tell if he can turn their program around.
he wasn't a name coach, a big money "splash" hire, but he worked his way through his first year despite suffering health issues and made some improvement along the way.

i don’t know if we’ve seen that with fans in seats, but when you live here, you don’t really accept second-best for anything, especially when it comes to the huskers.
i guess it's nice that they were impressed with the facilities because they sure weren't with the husker basketball team.
minnesota has to get people into the mode that they're going to have some patience and let things work, but mostly, they're going to have to get over the fickle nature of "i'll go when they're good enough".
and while fan support matters, its really up to the coach to give fan a reason to cheer.
the apathy created by long term suckage in these sports is only compounded by the presence of huskers and vikings football.

so that’s my hope, that after we let the good guy sadler go away after this season, we make the financial commitment to bring in someone bigger who will not only get the “hidden” fanbase excited, but get better recruits interested as well.

but then again, i hate watching my daughter play basketball and she’s pretty good.

by jf1husker on feb 9, 2012 9:17 am cst reply actions outside of getting a new coach.
for husker basketball, i think this switch over to the haymarket arena is a reasonably good chance to get people invested (they’re already financially invested since the good people of lincoln voted to raise taxes on everyone visiting the city to pay for it), but i do think its a fairly narrow window.
while facilities matter, all in all, we are just unlucky with coaches and well, we were spoiled with nee and didn’t realize how good we did have it.

develop good, homegrown linemen and go to the coasts and cities to get your speed and skill.

btw, danny nee’s previous stop, here at good ol’ ohio u, still hasn’t fully recovered from his departure either.
he wasn't a name coach, a big money "splash" hire, but he worked his way through his first year despite suffering health issues and made some improvement along the way.
it is in these programs that the fan bases of the programs in question place their true passion, and because husker and vikings football are generally successful enterprises, they’re willing to put up with a substandard product in their secondary rooting interests.
by doc1028 on feb 9, 2012 2:10 pm cst up reply actions it’s beneficial for us that our problem is in basketball and not football.

a run of pretty good teams and a couple of nba draft picks from his successor, but then he was fired for not being astoundingly, as opposed to consistently, successful.
it's not like there are a lot of husker football fans that would be impressed with golden gopher football.

not too many programs fire their most successful coach in their program’s history, outside of a major scandal.
now at least the students look like they’re having fun crappy team or not.
the power of red begins with the passion of walk-ons.
