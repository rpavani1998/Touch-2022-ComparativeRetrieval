every decision, stress about every injury, argue endlessly about a third and 5, and even build their own teams.
since football plays happen every few minutes (ad space?) and last about fifteen seconds, i actually feel that the extended plays in soccer move a little faster and have players thinking on their feet, and they give me more time to see specific players in action.
oh and girls can play.
try to argue what sport is better on a south american or a european forum.
if you don't want to give it your all, get off the field.
you don't give up until the qb takes a knee and says checkmate.
in soccer there are double passes ,headers, and the dribbles are much prettier and more sophisticated then holding the ball and running 40 yards.
the game isso slow, and i'm saying this as someone who is promoting a game with plays that last approximately 4 seconds.
like jazz or jazz influenced hip-hop.
you said that soccer is for little kids - meaning it's not for "real", grown-up athletes (contrary to the opinion of the vast majorityy of the world, of course...).
when it comes to sports, i'd like to see stuff that looks cool, that's what sports mean to me.
another problem i have with soccer is the pace.
soccer is the ultimate fan game because the fans can also suggest and yell tactics to the coach, they can also swear freely on the coach the players and the other team coach and players as for the score, so what?

that's why i go for more obscure stuff like aikido, lacrosse, wakeboarding and whatnot.
and nobody there is faking injuries for penatlies.
there is nothing in soccer, nut even the best slide tackle, like seeing your team's linebacker break through the line and nail the qb.

the rb has to guard against the blitz before he runs with the ball, the wr may have to block, and even offensive linemen have to both protect the quarterback and create holes for the runner.
ok i have checked to site.
they can get good exercise and wear a cute uniform and its is great for them.
but unlike religion sport is good.
as for shot-gun - that's when the quarterback stands a few feet behind the center, not crouching directly behind him.
most soccer games have anywhere between 2.5-2.85 goals per game.
futbawl is better exercise, football has too many 'fine adjustments' in its rule books (but i'm still opposed to the infield fly rule!).
watching these prima donnas flop around on the field because someone stepped on their toe makes me sick.
and believe me the crowd doesnt like fake injuries aswell.
i remember when mls started, everyone said it would take off because a lot of people had played soccer as a kid, and loved the game.
like most americans i have no use for europe, especially since we built such a swell version of it at epcot, not to mention the one we built in las vegas.
not to mention the fact that like all of my employees, any of them trying to speak directly to me will be taken away and fed to the hounds.
belgians, are surprisingly resilient.
that's why i go for more obscure stuff like aikido, lacrosse, wakeboarding and whatnot.
the flopping in soccer is annoying, but that's why they have the very good rule nowadays of a yellow card for faking in the penalty area.
makes good tv i guess.
the problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time.
i guess there are some good things about europe, like eurodisney, and i hear they've built a hard rock cafe.
but in soccer the game is continous and fast not like in football where plays as you said last 4 seconds, most of them fail, and bitween each play you need to wait a couple of minutes.
but maybe this is why i'll (and probably most americans) will always see soccer as a little kids game.
but i am an american at heart and if i were to watch something on tv it would probably be american football.

2 goals are considered a nearly insurmountable lead, and a team with the lead is content to sit back and kill 50 minutes of the game.
the motion itself is not as challenging, because a rusher doesn't need to control the ball with his feet, but he is eluding full contact.
i understand that most europeans hate americans.
the game isso slow, and i'm saying this as someone who is promoting a game with plays that last approximately 4 seconds.

ofcourse that every play is bitween the offence and defence.
superior to actual europe in terms of rides, as well as buffets, both of these versions of europe include things that appear to be kryptonite to most real europeans; manners, toothpaste, and deodorant.
you get nearly constant running as well as bonebreaking tackles.
soccer at it's very best is the finest game on earth.
a really good rushing or kick-return td is every bit as beautiful as a great slalom goal.
am football (american rugby) is more fun to watch and futbawl (american soccer) is more fun to play.
lacrosse takes the cake.
in football most games end in the 20-10 points result and that is equivalent to 2-1 in soccer, and any leade is no sade, ask bayern levekuzen the german team who lost 2-1 after 1-0 lead to manchester united in the 90'th minute two goals were scored in less then a minute and that was in the champions league final of 1999.
the stanley cup playoffs are the greatest sports event of the year.
fans can track every minute detail of their teams, second-guess every decision, stress about every injury, argue endlessly about a third and 5, and even build their own teams.
each side fights for the advantage, trying to dictate the play to the other team.

any game that encourages someone to fake an injury pisses me off.
i think its quite amazing that you even percieved my post as condescending.
millions of little kids can feel important and part of the team when there is no way they could ever play basketball or real football.
but the scoring adds a whole new dimension to the game.
oh ok so it is better for a leading team to try running plays and a team with less points to try to make passes it saves the time because half the game is lost during the intervals.
another problem i have with soccer is the pace.
usually, it's only to say things like, "i was having trouble falling asleep last night, luckily espn2 was showing soccer."

pm it is a cultural thing.
i, for one, prefer football over soccer for some of the following reasons: football has more strategy.
unfortunately, as i said, the rules currently discourage playing like that at the highest level.
pm i guess football is a lot of strategy, like chess, but watching it is just about as interesting.
as for faking injuries - they do it in hoops too, and even in football you'll see wr's trying to draw interference calls.
i would restate your comment that favorite sports areusually dependent on our culture.
pm good one, ron i personally find cricket to be baseball's primitive predecessor, but that's me.
with football you get one amazing play in the course of a game, and it gets on the replays all night.
that is great and they do wear cute little uniforms and yes girls get to play.
one girl is kicking one girl is chasing...and the other girls are biting their nails.
it's just not as interesting.
my remarks may have indeed eeked a bit of disdain for soccer... because , yes, i do think it is boring.

hannibal member member # 1339 posted september 13, 2004 10:16 am i also menaged to survive till 0500 and watch the game bitween denver broncos and the somthing chiefs.
pm those are condescending comments, which basically state that soccer is more about social concerns than sports.
even a snoozer like tonight's titans-dolphins affair has at least one exciting play (chris brown's 52 yard romp, in this case).
am i can appreciate football, but not love it.
the extra few feet behind the line give the qb an extra second or two to find a reciever before the defensive players get to him.
then again, since football is so much more difficult and intricate, maybe you can't truly enjoy it until you reach the highest levels, i.e. pro, college, or to a lesser degree high school (i never made it past middle school.
the play is concentrated in the middle of the field, where the players give the ball back and forth to each other until someone breaks down the field and shoots the ball 20 feet wide of the net.
the problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time.
it's like music - fluent, improvisational, thrilling...nothing in the world like it.
as for the players, most players dont fake injuries, infact if a player is catched by the referee he gets a yellow card.
this is done in cases where the defense must gain quite a lot of yards in one play (say 3rd down and 8).
i would ask them, but like i said they all speak gibberish.
they can get good exercise and wear a cute uniform and its is great for them.

we have it, not to mention all of the slutty american girls giving it away for free.
you said "girls can play", as if they can't and don't play basketball as well.
as for the pace, a good soccer game, has a very good pace, with allmost no stops, many passes and lots of attacks by both teams, while a football game as i said is divided in to short plays and most of them fail.
and i'm currently wat to out of shape to even worry about trying to find someone to play rugby with, but it is fun to think about.
