with its ability to generate a significant amount of revenue for the university, historical recognition as an athletics powerhouse and its desire to bring the best talent found nationwide to south bend, one thing is for sure: notre dame’s recruiting expenses will continue to lead the ncaa.after all, the historic significance of collegiate athletic conferences has been to organize a group of universities around a common sense of mission, history, size, and geographic location in order to create affiliations and rivalries that benefit all involved.this is because new football members will restore the balance of power between football and non-football schools, while securing well-performing football schools in strong media markets will likely help the big east maintain its bcs aq status.the athletics department’s ability to turn over $20 million worth of revenue to the university as a result of its football team’s success is arguably a reason why nearly one-half of notre dame’s entire recruiting budget is spent by the football team.securing a fourth texas school into its conference gives all big 12 members a significant advantage over other conferences in recruiting this talent.thus, it’s in the big east’s best interest to secure schools who have performed well in recent years and also attract media viewership.big 12 college coaches can lure texas recruits to play for them by promising them the ability to play before their family and friends in their hometown.by moving to the big 12, tcu has arguably set itself on good footing to earn even larger amounts of money from one of the biggest revenue streams in college sports.if the tigers can turn a profit and increase their recruiting expenses, memphis should be largely competitive in the conference.in fact, its basketball teams perform so well, that it is one of the only conferences which earned more money from its basketball teams than its football teams.given that memphis has invested in its facilities, it is certain that other big east teams and their fans will enjoy traveling to memphis to watch their teams compete.the $20 million worth of revenue provided by the athletics department to the university is used by the university to fund other students’ financial aid and to cover operating expenses.like st. john’s, which plays its home games at madison square garden, memphis also has an impressive basketball facility.the impact on the department as a whole would be a reduction in departmental revenues by several million dollars and departmental income available for supporting other sports/programs by $1 million.while likely a small factor when considered in the grand scheme of things, the university’s athletic department will incur much lower travel expenses by moving to the big 12.
