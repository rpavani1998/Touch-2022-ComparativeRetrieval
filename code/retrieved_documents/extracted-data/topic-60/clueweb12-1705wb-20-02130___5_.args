blatant fouls with excessive contact or that are not an attempt to play the ball are called unsportsmanlike fouls (or flagrant fouls in the nba) and typically will result in ejection.by not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of someone stealing the ball from him/her.a player or coach who shows poor sportsmanship, for instance, by arguing with a referee or by fighting with another player, can be charged with a more serious foul called atechnical foul.although some players can perform them effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be fundamentally unsound, difficult to control, and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.... college basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated inmatch fixing and point shaving.half-court games also raise the number of players that can use a court, an important benefit when many players want to play.the most commonly interchanged positions are point guard and shooting guard, especially if both players have good leadership and ball handling skills.this provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.half-court games require lesscardiovascular stamina, since players need not run back and forth a full court.in 1946, the basketball association of america (baa) was formed, organizing the top professional teams and leading to greater popularity of the professional game.an attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through physical contact is illegal and is called a foul.disruptive physical contact (fouls) is not permitted and there are restrictions on how the ball can be handled (violations).while shorter players are often not very good at defending against shooting, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths.while variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height; a rim that is off by but a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.world championships, held in 2002 in indianapolis and 2006 in japan, demonstrate the globalization of the game equally dramatically.
