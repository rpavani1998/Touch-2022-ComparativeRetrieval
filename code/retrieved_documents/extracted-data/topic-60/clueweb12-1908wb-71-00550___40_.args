i truly believe it is the single best tool available to take advantage of a disciplined defense.(more…) given that humans lack clairvoyance, there is no such thing as the perfect play-caller and thus much of the development in football strategy has centered on how to get into (or out of) a given play because the defense is well suited to defend the one that was called.the play-pass is one of the best ways to cool all of that emotion and intensity down because the object of the play-pass is to get the defensive team to commit to a fake run and then throw behind them.surprisingly, however, this supposedly natural skill — the ability to locate and throw the ball to an open receiver — is taught in a variety of ways, some more effective than others.the shallow cross is, quite possibly, the best pass play in football: almost any quarterback can complete it; almost any receiver can run it (though there is more nuance than maybe one might initially realize to a good shallow route); it is a way to get “speed in space” without requiring a big arm; it works against most all coverages; and throwing a few of these tends to open up big plays downfield as defenders creep up.by using the play-pass as an integral pant of your offense you are trying to take advantage of a defensive team that is very anxious very intense and very fired-up to play football.once you get the defensive team distracted and disoriented, they begin to think about options and, therefore, are susceptible to the running game.the play-pass is the one fundamentally sound football play that does everything possible to contradict the basic principles of defense.that’s all well and good, but is still cumbersome and, most importantly, the defense can still make the offense wrong after the quarterback has made his decision at the line.(more…) the shallow cross is, quite possibly, the best pass play in football: almost any quarterback can complete it; almost any receiver can run it (though there is more nuance than maybe one might initially realize to a good shallow route); it is a way to get “speed in space” without requiring a big arm; it works against most all coverages; and throwing a few of these tends to open up big plays downfield as defenders creep up.in essence, the quarterback reads defenders, who dictate where the ball will go.my talent would never have allowed for me to dream of playing after college (i considered myself blessed to be there), and i always knew i would go into coaching.because football is governed by its immutable twins of strategy — arithmetic and geometry — these remain the foundation for all effective pass plays: simple stuff these three categories essentially made up the full panoply of choices for the passing game for, well, for a really long time.this conjures up the idea that the receiver’s job is to release off the ball and immediately start “fading” to the sideline, where the quarterback has to throw it to an increasingly vanishing spot between the defender and the sideline.moreover, with the rise of no-huddle offenses, there aren’t as many opportunities to call multiple plays at the lineand have the quarterback check into one or another.
