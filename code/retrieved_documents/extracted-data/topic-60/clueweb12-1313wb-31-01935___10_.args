we are confident that boise state will be well positioned for future success, and we will evaluate our status with the best interests of the entire university in mind.boise state’s athletic achievements, academic and research successes, popularity, and vision for future growth make the university an extremely valuable conference partner.”strong facilities and a strong out of conference schedule year in year out.a lot of teams would improve in an aq conference.navy, air force and boise state are being considered as football members only, while ucf, temple, houston and smu are at the top of the list as all-sports members so it’s unknown right now how large the basketball membership could grow.“the landscape of college athletics is exceptionally fluid, and we are continuing to monitor the situation.some league members support adding boise state because of the broncos’ recent success, which would help the league with its future bcs status.however, there remains the very real possibility louisville and west virginia may not be in the league and bound for the big 12 if missouri leaves for the sec or the big 12 expands to 12 teams.“while we are certainly flattered to be mentioned in connection with other conferences and we hold those leagues in high regard, our current focus is on continuing to build the outstanding athletic programs that have helped make boise state a popular and compelling national brand," kustra said.they'd get more fan turnout playing against teams like wvu, usf, and louisville than they would playing the likes of troy, ul-lafayette, and north texas.boise state president bob kustra said in a statement monday that the broncos “are looking forward to their inaugural season” in the mountain west conference and he “has great confidence in the future direction of the mountain west.”joining a bcs conference isn't about how that conference can help your school.how about putting the best 64 teams out there and see what happens on the field not in some board room where a bunch of fools try to carve up a pie on the backs of kids that in many cases could not get into the university the represent.in fact, the only florida teams that ucf has ever beaten are fau and bethune-cookman.southern miss has been to 8 straight bowl games and ecu 5 a claim that only 20 other programs can make yet they both appear to be on the outside looking in.
