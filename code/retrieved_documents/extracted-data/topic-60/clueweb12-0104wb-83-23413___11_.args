with basketball you are only starting 5 players and with one or two really good recruits/players you can easily build a good run and progress from there.it is in these programs that the fan bases of the programs in question place their true passion, and because husker and vikings football are generally successful enterprises, they’re willing to put up with a substandard product in their secondary rooting interests.we can’t really get rid of the men’s team, given that it makes money and that funds other sports that don’t.if what i think about us is true, i think we can succeed and eventually reach a level where we are in the top 25 year in and year out.if you don't' support the team you're not going to sway the recruits you need to consistently have a winner.develop good, homegrown linemen and go to the coasts and cities to get your speed and skill.while facilities matter, all in all, we are just unlucky with coaches and well, we were spoiled with nee and didn’t realize how good we did have it.and while fan support matters, its really up to the coach to give fan a reason to cheer.the apathy created by long term suckage in these sports is only compounded by the presence of huskers and vikings football.what i hope is that nebraskans have a slightly different mindset about success, enough to want to strive to be the best regardless.the successful learn from their failures.for husker basketball, i think this switch over to the haymarket arena is a reasonably good chance to get people invested (they’re already financially invested since the good people of lincoln voted to raise taxes on everyone visiting the city to pay for it), but i do think its a fairly narrow window.we are incredibly inelastic when it comes to quality.because what we have with football is pretty unique and something a program really can never expect, for honestly, i think we accept alot of crap from our fb program.i'd say the biggest obstacle facing minnesota is lack of fan support.
