an athletics program as prominent as georgia's, and with as many natural and institutional advantages, ought to be good consistently at multiple sports, and certainly at the second-most important sport, in terms of money and prestige, in intercollegiate competition.if the results were averaged (i.e., if it showed how well a school was doing overall in the sports in which it participated) rather than lumped together, it would give us a more accurate portrait of how good an athletics program a university was running.but my hope is that this was the breakthrough that will put georgia basketball on the road to respectability, significance, and, ultimately, success at the highest level.in short, the s.e.c. has gotten good at basketball, too, without sacrificing its commitment to quality football. . . .rivals.com’s methodology was somewhat confusing---the formula, for instance, states contradictorily that a team gets five points for a third- or fourth-place finish in the college world series but receives three points for the selfsame third- or fourth-place finish in the college world series---but, assuming that we are all agreed thatintercollegiate athletics are superior to professional sports, i thought it was worth exploring how the bulldogs fared according to these rankings.no, georgia basketball doesn’t enjoy kentucky’s tradition, or even arkansas’s, but there’s no reason why the bulldogs can’t improve their stature in the sport in the same way florida and tennessee have in recent years.if georgia had matched florida’s 42 points in basketball during that period, it would have put the bulldogs in the top ten.even this crude calculation by rivals.com, however, offers meaningful insights into the state of what otherwise isas strong an athletics program as any in the conference.rivals.com reports that georgia ranks 17th overall since 1974, half a point behind no. 16 notre dame.surveys like this one, however, explain why it matters to me to see georgia improve at men’s basketball.that would have been good enough to boost the bulldogs from 17th overall since 1974 to 13th.georgia’s sensational run through the s.e.c. tournament last spring got us all excited, but the euphoria has worn off and it is time for us to expect more than a long weekend’s worth of excellence.georgia’s 2002 s.e.c. championship squad compiled a resume of achievement equal to or better than that of more than a couple of the national champions who have been crowned since richard nixon left office, but the bulldogs received half as many points (5) for mark richt’s second season in athens as the gators received for urban meyer’s altogether comparable second season in gainesville (10).i know we probably can’t beat stanford or ucla because we don’t field teams in water polo, wake boarding, beach volley ball, snow skiing, bowling or hacky-sack, but we had a pretty amazing run this year with at least 3 national titles, two #2 finishes in major sports and a conference championship in our achilles heel, basketball.if, instead of collecting an anemic 12 points in basketball since 1974, the classic city canines had amassed 25.5 points---equal to the totals earned by alabama and oklahoma state in that same span---georgia would have finished with a cumulative 123 points in the three sports combined.
