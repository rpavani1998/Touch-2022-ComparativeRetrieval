while not limiting myself just to those few schools, there is a clear hierarchy in the level of donations among the various powers: the football schools bring in significantly more in donations than do the basketball leaders.
the limitation of the effect of this factor however is that even mediocre college football teams draw pretty well, particularly where there is a greater culture of athletic success at the university; for example, unc and kentucky may not be that great in football right now, but they stillsell out their nearly all their games.

while unc football is facing someserious charges from the ncaa which could affect the program in the short-term, and have not had a great deal of success in the sport, they have long been thought of as a "sleeping giant" in the college football world that has the ability and resources to become a factor in the acc and nationally.
