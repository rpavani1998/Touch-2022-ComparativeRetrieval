the exposers of jordon's  foolishness my controversial, award-winning site that exposes the clay feet of the tin god michael jordon.
stripped down, just-the-facts site that shows why michael jordan is not the greatest basketball player ever.
when you even the playing field, you see that he is not the best.
this site has only one purpose: to show that no matter what criteria is used, michael jordan is not the greatest player ever.
because of the unfounded hype, i created a webpage using hype in the other extreme, in order to demonstrate the absurdity of the press.
this is the only site i have that features a guest book.
that got this site a bunch of hits (1000 before he died, 50,000 during 3 months after he died).
i am simply sick of the media worshipping him and holding him to a lesser standard than others are held to.
not only is he the most overrated basketball player in history, and an out-of-control megalomaniac.
one of the funniest parts is how people take it so seriously, so for added humorous benefit, iprint the hate mail and the praise mail.
the most exhaustive page on the internet dedicated to the greatest player in nba history.
it contains interactive sections as well, and most of my graphics work.
when people call him thebest ever, it becomes obvious that they don't understandever, because they lack knowledge of basketball history.
when you even the playing field, you see that he is not the best.
it contains the java applets and java script that i have learned.
i may remove the frames someday, but for now, i can't think of an easier way to navigate the 75+ html document related to it.
i grow tired of the hype of the media, saying he is "without a doubt the best ever", instead of, saying that he is "one of the best ever."  because of the unfounded hype, i created a webpage using hype in the other extreme, in order to demonstrate the absurdity of the press.
making fun of him in his current job as part-owner of the washington wizards is just too easy.
my exposers of jordon's foolishness site was a lot of fun, but some people thought that because of the humor, that it completely lacked in factual information (due to the obviously absurd parts).
air judden's  basketball book library reviews of books from my 100+ book collection.
it contains interactive sections as well, and most of my graphics work.
i don't update this site very much anymore.
however, he happens to be one of the greatest cooks in the world, so this proves that i am unbiased."
this is a bare-bones, all-facts/no humor site.
when people call him thebest ever, it becomes obvious that they don't understandever, because they lack knowledge of basketball history.
you don't hear any baseball or football player called the best ever.
because basketball has degenerated from a serious sport into an entertainment business, and jordan, while he was a great player, was an even better entertainer.
therefore, the theme of the site is "michael jordon is a foolish ballhog.
if you just don't "get it", then go to the "political agenda" section and read how he masterminded the clinton-lewinski scandal.
