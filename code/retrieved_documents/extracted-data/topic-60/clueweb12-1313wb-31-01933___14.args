what make temple, smu and houston attractive to the big east, one source said, is their respective television markets.
navy, air force and boise state are being considered as football members only, while ucf, temple, houston and smu are at the top of the list as all-sports members so it’s unknown right now how large the basketball membership could grow.
beyond navy, air force and ucf, a league source said “no one team is definitely next” as an expansion candidate.
east carolina would be a great choice for the be, and definitely an asset to the league.
and everyone knows that ecu brings the crowds to bowl games (when they get into them).
but ecu (just like any other team) would get better because of the beast rep. in sports kids would want to play against the uconns, wvu, usf (ecu would love to beat them because of skip hotlz).
boise state president bob kustra said in a statement monday that the broncos “are looking forward to their inaugural season” in the mountain west conference and he “has great confidence in the future direction of the mountain west.”
if the powers that be in the big east can't see this diamond in the rough, then they are certainly the epitome of "can't see the forest for the trees"!
put wvu in the east this year and they are competing for a shot at the sec championship game.
just think, what if any other team in north carolina cared about football.
ecu has a very nice stadium, great sports fans, and a very convienient location for big east fans.
big east plotting football, hoops divisions in the end, wvu lost.
a league source also told cbssports.com that army is no longer being considered as a candidate by the big east.

to make all those attempts means you have no running game (or at least that night....and you're behind in the scoreboard)...all night.

“while we are certainly flattered to be mentioned in connection with other conferences and we hold those leagues in high regard, our current focus is on continuing to build the outstanding athletic programs that have helped make boise state a popular and compelling national brand," kustra said.
“they’ve been honest with us and that they’re not interested because of the challenges they had previously in conference usa,” the source said.
east carolina has won 2 of the last 3 cusa football championships, is nc's second largest university, has a basketball team that is getting better, a consistently good baseball team, cusa titles in other sports, packs 50,000+ in the football stadium on a dreary day with a down year team, is a foothold in a state with 4 acc schools, has a fan base across the state, is actually in the eastern us, and there is not much mention here about them.
lsu is #2 in forced turnovers for the ncaa.
however, there remains the very real possibility louisville and west virginia may not be in the league and bound for the big 12 if missouri leaves for the sec or the big 12 expands to 12 teams.
you are the one who claimed wvu would get killed in the sec.
their average drive was 60 yards.
ecu is not an easy w. their record this year hasn't been helped by their schedule.
lsu didn't give up those kind of numbers to any other sec team....
i agree they could be a good addition for the big east.
so to throw out the term "average at best" is pretty irresponsible.
yeah goldrusher, that would really be a crushing blow to the acc.
averaged 50% conversion of possessions into td's so lsu's goal was to pin them back and make them work.
that is a pretty respectable place to be in the sec.
not trying to be a smart... but because of the impact of tv on college athletics, your conference idea, while encouraging rivalries, would actually demote all those schools to the level of app st rather than elevate app st.

(that means they score a lot of points per drive) lsu had 7 td's vs wva 2 were direct result of turnover one was at the 1 yard line and a punt return.
they have losing records all time against all of those but perennial football power duke, which is 5-5.
brilliant idea, i'm sure the big east will jump right on it(sarcasm, if it's not obvious).
the tv market of n carolina, s carolina, virginia, w virginia and maryland would be smaller than the southern conference market of n carolina, s carolina, georgia, tennessee and alabama.

but, for you to claim wvu would get killed in the sec... just makes you look foolish.
we are confident that boise state will be well positioned for future success, and we will evaluate our status with the best interests of the entire university in mind.
so wva would have to drive 90 yards 6 times and assuming 50% conversion that is 21 points and 270 yards.
yet none of these teams accomplished in points or passing yards or total yards what wvu produced.

some league members support adding boise state because of the broncos’ recent success, which would help the league with its future bcs status.
pm officials from what’s left of the big east’s dwindling football membership had another conference call on tuesday morning and there remains no specific timetable on adding ucf, but “appears an invitation is forthcoming” for the knights, the league’s no. 1 target.
“the landscape of college athletics is exceptionally fluid, and we are continuing to monitor the situation.
you can ask any acc school that plays ecu, and they will tell you that ecu is ready to play you in football anytime, home or away.

i said it's because wvu threw as much as 3 sec schools vs lsu.

the acc does not need another north carolina team thus why they got pitt and syc.
a lot of teams would be 1-4 after playing south carolina, virginia tech, north carolina and houston.
boise state’s athletic achievements, academic and research successes, popularity, and vision for future growth make the university an extremely valuable conference partner.”

clab4tune, i was responding sarcastically to an emotional, hateful, unprovoked post against the acc and the north carolina schools.
to me, it would be a huge mistake for the be to pass over ecu.
i know we punted to wva 6 times and the average start on those 6 possessions was the 10.
in the end, wvu lost.
it would be centralized (duke, ncst, unc, wf, usc (gamecocks), clemson, virginia, wvu, vt, ecu, app st, maryland) would be ok in all sports!
that ecu has not been productive against the acc schools but ecu does fit the beast profile.
lsu has the #2 offensive efficiency in the sec.
funny how everyone - outside of wvu fans - thinks that they would be average at best in the sec.

and all-time against the other schools that the beast is looking at ecu has done very well, which is what you need to look at. 1-0 vs boise state (again we had chris johnson that game) 8-2 vs ucf, 7-4 vs temple, 6-4 vs houston (last one was houston crushing ecu) 2-2 vs smu and 0-2 vs navy (again another crushing defeat last time).

i am not an ecu fan, but i respect their program, fans and great facilities.
on a consistency basis, i would say that wvu is like uga or arkansas.
