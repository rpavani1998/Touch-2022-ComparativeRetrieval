even in as large and wealthy a country as the united states, where the national appetite for playing, and even more so for watching, games is enormous, the cultural, economic and psychological space available for sport is limited and that space is already taken.baseball, american football and basketball have long since put down deep roots, claimed particular seasons of the year as their own (although they now overlap) and gained the allegiance of the sports-following public.football and basketball are therefore the team sports that most vividly evoke a common human fantasy: to leave the ground and fly through the air.and both football and basketball players can perfect their skills practising entirely alone.the presence of four major team sports - more than in any other country - has made the barrier to entry in the competition for the affections and the dollars of american sports fans extraordinarily high, so high that even the world's most popular game has not been able to surmount it.they do not require elaborate equipment and satisfactory informal games can be staged without the full complement of players.to do the same thing for football might well require dramatic modifications in the way the game is now played - the abolition of the offside rule, for example, or awarding points that count in the final score for corner kicks, which, as in prize fights that do not end in knockouts, would give an advantage to the side that makes the most determined efforts to score.one possible reason is that such changes would make the american version of football substantially different from the game played everywhere else, and here americans are reluctant to be out of step with the rest of the world.a fourth team sport, ice hockey, is widely played across the northern tier of the country and has a professional league with teams located across the border in canada and throughout the united states, even in cities whose climates are so benign that ice has never formed in them: indeed, the franchise in tampa, florida, won this year's championship.if architecture is, as is sometimes said, music set in concrete, then football and basketball may be said to be creativity embodied in team sports.the action of a basketball game and of a football match are easier to follow than that of other team sports as well because the ball is larger than in cricket and baseball and is never hidden in a tangle of bodies or a scrum, as it is in american football and rugby.north americans don't need football because they already get what it has to offer from basketball.their marked similarities, however, also mean that the two sports duplicate each other.basketball players spring off the floor to launch shots at the basket and soar to capture missed shots as they bounce off the rim, even as football players leap upward to intercept a kicked ball with their heads to control it, tap it to a team-mate, or redirect it into their opponents' goal.spectators see the same thing in the two games: episodes of spontaneous coordination, with players devising and implementing schemes for scoring.
