players are selected, not recruited, you can get experienced players right away with no need for development, and holes can be filled in the cases of injury or need during the season.there is very little actual teaching of basketball done in the pros -- mostly just skills refinement for which the players are primarily responsible.the coach must manage his players in every detail from grades to rules compliance to media appearances to matters of discipline.most of these kids need more than one year of college to learn enough basketball knowledge to make it in the pros.based on the amount of years cal envisions himself still coaching, it is far more likely that he will win enough (conference titles, final fours, championships, 30-win seasons, etc) to be considered one of the best coaches of all time in college rather than the nba.coaching in the nba is more an exercise in business management than actual coaching, since the players are often employed more like financial assets in a monopoly game.the ncaa tournament is also unquestionably more difficult for a given team to win, even considering only the historically best teams.i don’t think we fans expect that uk basketball can ever mean quite the same thing to a coach, who comes from elsewhere, has worked for other programs and is paid to do the job, as it does to the fans, for whom kentucky fandom literally feels like a part of the genetic code.we get the fact that the elite players don’t come from the hollers of kentucky where selling only kentucky’s fine history might be enough to ensure we get the best players and the best possible teams.ones goals, desires, health, and a plethora of other things can change in an individual’s life resulting in a desire for career change.as nba players get bigger and bigger, they control more and more about the team as a whole in many different ways.the nba requires a coach to manage personalities more than anything else, as he is coaching mostly full-grown men making six and seven figure salaries per year.you also have key players for as long as you want to pay what they demand, no one and dones or graduating seniors to worry about.what the nba has going for it are larger team fan bases, more player name recognition, more marketing and apparel tie-ins and even more media exposure as an institution than the ncaa championship.the nba also unquestionably has the best players, since only the cream of the college crop ever make it in the association.
