basketball players are allowed participation with professional teams as long as they don’t accept money in excess of reasonable and necessary expenses, just like tennis players.a former professional athlete may receive educational expenses from a professional team or league, provided the following conditions are met: (a) the student-athlete no longer is involved in professional athletics; (b)an individual may receive educational expenses awarded by a professional team or league, in accordance with the applicable conditions set forth in bylaw 15.2.5.6.the fans also have an interest, both financially and emotionally, although that interest is so diluted by comparison to the institutions that their power is almost impossible to muster except in very rare situations.the rule that i believe is applicable states that a prospective student-athlete may receive educational expenses or services from any individual other than a professional sports team/organization (and the few other entities), and then goes on to place a limitation on those who are permitted to provide such expenses.i think they have a leg to stand on no matter what they decide, because the rules are so arbitrarily enforced that they can defend any decision they make.you claim they are earning “prize money,” but the ncaa rules state that they may earn money as long as it isn’t in excess of actual or necessary expenses — just like basketball players.that’s contrary to rule 12.1.2.1.3.1, which says rather clearly (after several readings) that professional sports teams/organationzations may notprovide educational expenses or services to prospective student-athletes.there is no real doubt that if vast numbers of fans across the country tried to affect ncaa regulations by acting as a cohesive whole, they could.just as nobody is guaranteed the school will field a football team or renew a scholarship year by year, nobody is guaranteed a smooth ride vis-a-vis the ncaa.the possibility of ncaa punishment is part and parcel of the college athletics experience.you get a ton of foreign players who try to make it professionally from about 16-20 years old, realize its going to be nearly impossible (only a few hundred pro tennis players really make any decent money), so then change direction and come to play for us colleges, where they have a nice opportunity to get a free education.if young kanter did not really know how much money he was receiving as far as necessary and actual expenses were concerned, he could have reasonably believed that he and his family were acting fully within the ncaa bylaws.tennis and golf amateurs are not allowed to receive more than “actual or necessary” expenses, just like basketball players.using impermissible benefits to commit another violation of the rules only exacerbates the offense.
