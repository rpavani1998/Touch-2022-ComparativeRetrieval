hoops was always an afterthought.
moreover, as evidenced by the recruiting class mark  richt landed last month, a full house in stegeman coliseum when uncommitted  football prep stars pay their last-minute visits to athens can be a powerful  tool to use in persuading high school gridiron standouts to spend their college  years playing in sanford stadium.

let’s be frank: 20 years ago, being bad at basketball didn’t matter  for an sec program.
scoring streaks, and droughts, have also a been regular feature during games.
maybe i can learn to love bouncyball after all.
honestly, the match-up between a husky and a bulldog would be interesting (but, as vick knows, is illegal).
plus i need you to use your new found basketball acumen to help commentate the game (you really have made impressive progress).
on the other, how many times do we get to dance in the first place.
i peeked at the bama game.
i’ll wager a beer on the game, and will gladly buy if we lose . . .

here are five reasons why making the field of 68, even if only by the skin  of their collective teeth, was tremendously important for the red and black: it helps a team to build up a track record of attending the tournament.
