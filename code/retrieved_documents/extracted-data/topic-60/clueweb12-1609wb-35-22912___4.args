david perno has the diamond dogs on sound ground.
the ‘dawgs and the irish were tied with 65 points apiece in football, but notre dame’s eight straight n.c.a.a. tournament appearances from 1999 to 2006 boosted the golden domers to 28 points in men’s basketball, whereas the red and black’s 25-year-old final four berth got georgia only as far as 12 points.
if georgia had matched florida’s 42 points in basketball during that period, it would have put the bulldogs in the top ten.
an athletics program as prominent as georgia's, and with as many natural and institutional advantages, ought to be good consistently at multiple sports, and certainly at the second-most important sport, in terms of money and prestige, in intercollegiate competition.
no, georgia basketball doesn’t enjoy kentucky’s tradition, or even arkansas’s, but there’s no reason why the bulldogs can’t improve their stature in the sport in the same way florida and tennessee have in recent years.
rivals.com’s methodology was somewhat confusing---the formula, for instance, states contradictorily that a team gets five points for a third- or fourth-place finish in the college world series but receives three points for the selfsame third- or fourth-place finish in the college world series---but, assuming that we are all agreed thatintercollegiate athletics are superior to professional sports, i thought it was worth exploring how the bulldogs fared according to these rankings.

is that it rewards quantity as much as quality.

i know we probably can’t beat stanford or ucla because we don’t field teams in water polo, wake boarding, beach volley ball, snow skiing, bowling or hacky-sack, but we had a pretty amazing run this year with at least 3 national titles, two #2 finishes in major sports and a conference championship in our achilles heel, basketball.
there are so few teams, even if we stink, we still probably get a #10 ranking and reap some more points.
georgia’s 2002 s.e.c. championship squad compiled a resume of achievement equal to or better than that of more than a couple of the national champions who have been crowned since richard nixon left office, but the bulldogs received half as many points (5) for mark richt’s second season in athens as the gators received for urban meyer’s altogether comparable second season in gainesville (10).

in short, the s.e.c. has gotten good at basketball, too, without sacrificing its commitment to quality football. . . .
that would have been good enough to boost the bulldogs from 17th overall since 1974 to 13th.
if the results were averaged (i.e., if it showed how well a school was doing overall in the sports in which it participated) rather than lumped together, it would give us a more accurate portrait of how good an athletics program a university was running.

indeed, there was, in no small sense, rather a manly satisfaction to be derived from deriding the neighboring a.c.c. as "a basketball conference"---by which was meant, of course, only a basketball conference, a league that had to settle for being good at hoops because it lacked the masculine fortitude to excel on the gridiron.
