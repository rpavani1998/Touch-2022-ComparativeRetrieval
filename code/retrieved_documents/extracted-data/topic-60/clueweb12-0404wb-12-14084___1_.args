you may also want to read strength and power for maximum speed as it details all the background information on why max strength, elastic strength and explosive strength improve speed at all velocities and gives detailed explanations of the exercises found to be best for getting this training effect.the argument presented is plyometrics helps with bounding and bounding lifts you off the ground more efficiently, thus reducing the energy cost of running for distance runners.if you are interested in the two landmark studies on plyometric effects on distance running you need to access explosive strength training improves 5-k running time by improving running economy and muscle power; european journal of applied physiology, vol. 86,#5 pp.while our sprinters do both plyometrics and conventional weight training (mix of olympic lifts, power lifts â€“ bench andsquats, and regular strength training for ancillary exercises), distance runners could certainly improve on the strength in their legs as well as flexibility (in my opinion).the bottom line is any improvement in strength and elasticity of your leg muscles will result in faster running.i am open to suggestions particularly when it comes to strength training so feel free to challenge me on my philosophies.of course, that extra strength and possible muscle mass must be translated to applying force to the ground while in a running motion.speedendurance (article summarizing research that plyometrics may be better than tradition weight training for distance runners.)as for wondering what max strength training would add to the plyo work for distance runners you need to check out maximal strength training improves aerobic endurance performance; scandinavian journal of med & science in sports, vol. 12, pp.results: improvements of 3%, 4.8% and 4.1% for the none, plyometrics and conventional weight training.squats, bench and olympic lifts have a time and place in a programme, and any world class coach will periodise weight training to peak at the right time, therefore 8 weeks is too short time frame.you'll also get coaching manuals from tom tellez, loren seagrave and dan pfaff.plyo group also made significant improvements in running economy at 3 different speeds (12k/hour 6.7%, 14k/hr 6.4%, and 4.1% at 16k/hour) with no change in control group at these speeds.the second study showed an average 3k improvement by 16.6 seconds(2.7%)in plyo group while control group had no change in times.this results in faster times, at least in theory.
