dooley needs to be able to take recruits to tba and have the same atmosphere as when martin takes basketball recruits to neyland.
the scoreboards tell you something else.
the degree of difficulty in achieving a major upset in basketball isn't close to pulling off one in football.
no disrespect to ccm but he would be first to admit that his situation is better than dooley's was.
the scoreboards tell you something else.
i don't know why he is waiting, but the damage being done daily is growing and i don't blame the kids.
maybe ut's football team will have a new defensive coordinator by then.
so you can get up in the morning and deliver the paper!
in fair comparison, dooley has lost to the two worst florida football teams in the past three decades.
ut's 67-56 victory will resonate beyond basketball.
sure, it's apples and big oranges.

the vols will have a couple of chances to enhance their reputation for upsets in the next week.

he was too busy plying his trade at court-side.
they will play at mississippi state on thursday before taking on kentucky at thompson-boling two days later.
he said more than once in his postgame analysis that when you don't execute, the opponent often has a big hand in it.
he doesn't make excuse after excuse for his failings...he coaches and he does it well.
in basketball, they have won 12 of the last 19 meetings.
i was and am willing to give dooley a reasonable chance and i think next year will be enough time to make a valid judgment about him.
right now the ut football program is a joke and the major reason is that we have a joker running it.
their superiority was so apparent in upping the lead to 16 points, i wondered if martin would be accused of running up the score.
to his credit, donovan didn't attribute the outcome solely to his team's inadequate play.

i think they're better than their record shows.
his presence contrasted sharply with that of florida coach billy donovan, who sat through the last five minutes as lifeless as a weary commercial-airlines traveler waiting on an overdue jet.
florida forward erik murphy dismissed another possible excuse by saying ut's early-season struggles didn't burden the gators with overconfidence.
he did inherit a bad situation, and i don't think a 3-5 year window to get us back to somewhere in the 9 win mark is too much to ask.
it's funny though, because i bet that if he amazingly succeeds next season, it will be because he's such a wonderful coach...
if you want to tailgate, get festive or watch the vols run through the "t," go to neyland stadium.
in 2005, when a ut team picked to contend for a national title was trying to figure out how it finished 5-6, bruce pearl's first ut basketball team beat sixth-ranked texas by 17 points in austin.
this day's basketball success is not enhanced by comparing it to the football team, nor..is there any valid point in making the comparison to begin with.
the basketball program this year isn't in as bad of shape as the football program was when derek dooley took over.
atlannavol, thanks for your mature and reasoned response.

the ut basketball program doesn't just prop up its football buddies against florida.
i know the position coaches and coordinators play a big part in the decisions a lot of kids make, but i want a kid that is coming to tennessee for all of the things we fans and alumni love about the volunteers.
the crack at the end about the d coordinator is especially dumb.
all they know is they attended a sporting event on the ut campus and didn't return home with their stomachs churning.
the ut basketball program doesn't just prop up its football buddies against florida.
martin probably didn't notice or care, but his ten nessee fan club was growing by the basket saturday.
yesterday was a great win for the vols and it has nothing to do with the football situation.
i guess we can continue to lose recruits to south carolina, like diggs, because we are waiting for some reason that no one knows including the head coach i believe.
the few dool-aid drinkers left are struggling to find a position to defend, and want to have it both ways hoping something will just magically happen.
the sheer size of neyland stadium tells you this is a football town.
i think most everybody knows dooley is just about out of excuses if he doesn't get it done next year, whatever "get it done" means in the context of recent ut football.
accurate article, this has been going on for years, where it's taken basketball for us to have something to really cheer about.
if, as you say, he amazingly succeeds, how would that not be a result of good coaching and recruiting?
they were muddling along at 7-7 when the 13th-ranked florida gators came knocking on their door saturday morning.
this win was was huge for their confidence and hopefully a nice building block for the rest of the season.
to his credit, donovan didn't attribute the outcome solely to his team's inadequate play.

a basketball team is to a football team as a bass boat is to a supertanker....much easier to turn around.
ut fans were reminded again saturday that they can count on basketball â€” even when they think they can't.
to my mind that would be progress and perhaps dooley gets the benefit of the doubt.
last week a multiple...or two..of this many registered their view of a mere freshman leaving the football program; one out of 85..or so.

they will play at mississippi state on thursday before taking on kentucky at thompson-boling two days later.

the ut men are rebuilding under a new coach.
i could debate you on my already having "gotten a good life," residing in other than a hole and probably having been grown up before you were born; however, like adams, you obviously don't know proper language; just profanity and nonsense.
the degree of difficulty in achieving a major upset in basketball isn't close to pulling off one in football.
if the new guys are who we need them to be, many if not all of the decommits will come back.
now, as the vols sit out another bowl season, the basketball team has managed to do two things in one day that the football program can't: beat a nationally ranked team and beat florida.
frankly dwayne, i think most fans are simply looking for progress.
i don't know what hole these creeps have crawled out from, but i wish they'd get the hell off this site so grown up fans can stay tuned to ut sports.
i'm absolutely thrilled for martin and this team to get this great win over a very good florida team.
we will have a better season next year.
and if dooley doesn't hire a couple of defensive coaches soon this recruiting season will be a lost cause.
the vols didn't just beat the gators.
tennessee downs florida for first sec win see all 17 photos at full size the sheer size of neyland stadium tells you this is a football town.
if you are saying failure would be another losing season of 5 or less wins, then i would agree with you, it's a bad statement on the coaching.
all they know is they attended a sporting event on the ut campus and didn't return home with their stomachs churning.
but if he fails, well...then it will be because the program was in such a horrible state when he took it over.
his presence contrasted sharply with that of florida coach billy donovan, who sat through the last five minutes as lifeless as a weary commercial-airlines traveler waiting on an overdue jet.
however, consider: thus far, 256 readers have logged in to this site, with mostly positive comments.
heaping garbage on them is totally unhelpful.....
some people with long memories and a tendency toward bitterness and negativity will hold that uk loss against him even if he wins the sec east next year, but most fans won't.
well, adams, that wasn't worth the time to read.

we've been without a defensive coordinator for one week, but florida still hasn't named a replacement for charlie weis and he took the kansas job dec. 8.
florida's casey prather actually fell to the floor and injured his ankle as ut's cam tatum changed directions on the dribble.
a good basketball program is good for the football team, just as a good football team is good for the basketball program.
they shot better, defended harder and seemed vastly more interested in the outcome.
martin may not lead ut to a final four (or maybe he will, who knows) but he doesn't throw his kids under the bus.
it also takes the heat off them during the bowl season.
you agree not to post comments that are off topic, defamatory, obscene, abusive, threatening or an invasion of privacy.
the only valid excuse he will have is if he loses 15-20 guys to injuries in the preseason.
the other kns guys are pretty good.
in basketball, they have won 12 of the last 19 meetings.
the knowledgeable vol fans recognize that martin inherited a total mess, with ncaa sanctions, yet in his first year takes a much less talented bunch and gets his signature win over a ranked florida team!
in fact, he was still barking commands in the last two minutes, although the victory had been tucked away.
fact of the matter is, the football team is painful to watch, and the basketball team is a nice change, despite the record.
if you want to see tennessee win a meaningful game, go to thompson-boling arena.
this was a great win.
he was too busy plying his trade at court-side.
lots of us like some things, if not all things, about dooley's personality and demeanor, and no reasonable person can fault his progress in rebuilding the program's overall numbers and depth if he can get most of this year's pretty good class nailed down.
such pointless non-writing just trivialized both programs...without a valid reason or punch line.
nope, i will leave the lectern to you; you earn it with your erudition.
in fact, he was still barking commands in the last two minutes, although the victory had been tucked away.
as long as the new guys are on board a couple of weeks before nsd--and if anybody has heard of them nationally, of course--i'm not too worried about the effect the void is having on recruits right now.
ut fans were reminded again saturday that they can count on basketball â€” even when they think they can't.

you two together are not going to change the way things are and you sure as heck will not change the coaching staff at tennessee.
i wouldn't come to a school where i didn't know who my position coach or coordinator was either.
they were muddling along at 7-7 when the 13th-ranked florida gators came knocking on their door saturday morning.
nobody will continue to give dooley the benefit of the doubt, whatever they may think about him personally, unless he has more on-field success next year.
florida's casey prather actually fell to the floor and injured his ankle as ut's cam tatum changed directions on the dribble.
uses a basketball win as an excuse to keep pouring salt in the wounds of ut fans.
comments are the sole responsibility of the person posting them.
they shot better, defended harder and seemed vastly more interested in the outcome.
i doubt it, and i'm sure dooley is happy for coach martin.
and, as a rule, there are usually more upsets in basketball than football.
completely unnecessary negativity from adams.
"the basketball program this year isn't in as bad of shape as the football program was when derek dooley took over."
