we are confident that boise state will be well positioned for future success, and we will evaluate our status with the best interests of the entire university in mind.boise state’s athletic achievements, academic and research successes, popularity, and vision for future growth make the university an extremely valuable conference partner.”in basketball, we are probably going to get steamrolled for the first few seasons but the acc is a recruiting draw and with our coaching staff, we should only get better.today, pitt has talent, as does wvu, but neither team is ready for a national championship.we can't even recruit the best players in the country.pitt leaving the conference for the acc will be the single biggest mistake the university will ever make.you have to admit that wvu has poor academics, facilities and no media market share.our academics are average at best.navy, air force and boise state are being considered as football members only, while ucf, temple, houston and smu are at the top of the list as all-sports members so it’s unknown right now how large the basketball membership could grow.“the landscape of college athletics is exceptionally fluid, and we are continuing to monitor the situation.some league members support adding boise state because of the broncos’ recent success, which would help the league with its future bcs status.however, there remains the very real possibility louisville and west virginia may not be in the league and bound for the big 12 if missouri leaves for the sec or the big 12 expands to 12 teams.“while we are certainly flattered to be mentioned in connection with other conferences and we hold those leagues in high regard, our current focus is on continuing to build the outstanding athletic programs that have helped make boise state a popular and compelling national brand," kustra said.boise state president bob kustra said in a statement monday that the broncos “are looking forward to their inaugural season” in the mountain west conference and he “has great confidence in the future direction of the mountain west.”when we can recruit like lsu and oklahoma, then we can look for the next level...not jump conferences out of desperation.
