since football plays happen every few minutes (ad space?) and last about fifteen seconds, i actually feel that the extended plays in soccer move a little faster and have players thinking on their feet, and they give me more time to see specific players in action.
another  problem i have with soccer is the players.
i played both as a kid, and preferred to play soccer.

try to argue what sport is better on a south american or a european forum.
pm crickett players think the rest of you are slightly above homo habilis.
each play is a battle of wits between the offense  and the defense.
if you don't want to give it your all, get off the field.
you don't give up until the qb takes a knee and says checkmate.
soccer is hockey's retarded little brother.
in soccer there are  double passes ,headers, and the dribbles are much prettier and more  sophisticated then holding the ball and running 40 yards.
the game isso slow, and i'm saying this as someone who is promoting a game with plays that last approximately 4 seconds.
so both teams are trying to do the same thing regardless.

those were my nice serious comments.

all in all i think it is  a colture thing.
then  you have to decide whether to take the sure pat or risk everything to go for 2.
the problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time.
but other than that i think it's pointless, and much too far to be of any use to anyone.

i guess there are some good things about europe, like eurodisney, and i hear they've built a hard rock cafe.

but in soccer the game is continous and fast not like in football where plays as you said last 4 seconds, most of them fail, and bitween each play you need to wait a couple of minutes.
but maybe this is why i'll (and probably most americans) will always see soccer as a little kids game.

yes, but aren't you wearing socks on those feet?
the motion itself is not as challenging, because a rusher doesn't need to control the ball with his feet, but he is eluding full contact.

the stanley cup playoffs are the greatest sports event of the year.
fans can track every minute detail of their teams, second-guess every  decision, stress about every injury, argue endlessly about a third and 5, and  even build their own teams.
each side fights for the advantage, trying to dictate the play to the other team.
2 goals are considered a nearly insurmountable lead, and a team with the  lead is content to sit back and kill 50 minutes of the game.

any game that encourages someone to  fake an injury pisses me off.
i think its quite amazing that you even percieved my post as condescending.
millions of little kids  can feel important and part of the team when there is no way they could ever  play basketball or real football.
soccer is just never  going to cut it in america !
but the scoring adds a whole new dimension to the game.
oh ok so it is better for a leading team to try running plays and a team with less points to try to make passes it saves the time because half the game is lost during the intervals.
another  problem i have with soccer is the pace.

unfortunately, as i said, the rules currently discourage playing like that at the highest level.

as  for faking injuries - they do it in hoops too, and even in football you'll see  wr's trying to draw interference calls.

pm those are condescending comments, which basically state that soccer is more about social concerns than sports.
i know that here i am outnumbered 100 to 1
why would i care what they think?
even a snoozer like tonight's titans-dolphins affair has at least one exciting play (chris brown's 52 yard romp, in this case).
if you don;'t see the profound difference between the two, i suggest you think on it till it comes to you.
and how could anyone compare the dangers of a soccer match with that of a football game?
choose between long passes, short passes, or  dribbling?
am i can appreciate football, but not love it.
the extra few feet behind the line give the qb an extra second or two to find a reciever before the defensive players get to him.
then again, since football is so much more difficult and intricate, maybe you can't truly enjoy it until you reach the highest levels, i.e. pro, college, or to a lesser degree high school (i never made it past middle school.
the play is concentrated in the middle of the field, where the players give the ball back and forth to each other until someone breaks down the field and shoots the ball 20 feet wide of the net.
the  problem with football is that when you are actually in a stadium you have a  killer of a time trying to see what is going on, especially if you are short  like me and have to stand on the bench the whole time.
with all this football(rugby) and footbawl (kiddy sport)  and football (pointy pigskin)
we are certainly influenced heavily by it, but not absolutly determined.
it's like music - fluent, improvisational,  thrilling...nothing in the world like it.
as for the players, most players dont fake injuries, infact if a player is  catched by the referee he gets a yellow card.
this is done in cases where the defense must gain quite a lot of yards in one play (say 3rd down and 8).
i would ask them, but like i said they all speak gibberish.
they can get good exercise and wear a cute uniform and its is great for them.

i suggest you try to limit yourself to expressing boredom with sports you don't dig, rather than contempt for those who practice and watch them.
it's so simple a child could figure it out (which is probably why so many american kids play it

in soccer, your options are, "well, i  think we'll try to score 1 point, and if that fails, we'll try to score 1  point, but we can always go for 1 point."
millions of little kids can feel important and part of the team when there is no way they could ever play basketball or real football.
i was, and still am, far too small).
anyway, tons of annoying, european people took the time to unhitch their oxen, and come in from the fields to "educate me" about soccer.
if a goal whould count as 7 points then the game will be  better?
in football, on  the other hand, each play is executed at full speed, with full effort.
i remember when mls  started, everyone said it would take off because a lot of people had played  soccer as a kid, and loved the game.

kids simply don't have the mental and physical skills necessary to play football the way it's supposed to be played, although just playing flag football, or everybody-run-down-the-field-and-i'll-throw-it football, was always a lot of fun.

or to ran with the ball himself?

we always like what is ours best.

and what makes it worse is that everyone knows that they're faking: the crowd, the other players, the coaches, the commentators, even the refs!
espn carries the late game (at 03:30 tonight) and the monday night game (tomorrow at 04:00
football is a strategic war between two teams of highly  specialized players.
as for the "couldn't play basketball or reall football" - just as most soccer players couldn't play high level basketball or football, the reverse is also true.
i played soccer as a kid, but never really got into it.
these people slam into each other at full speed play after play, get up and ask "you want some more, b*tch?"
i see 10x for the info i will look you up at walla, normally i dont go there, ynet is my port of call.
you have nothing that we want.

and  nobody there is faking injuries for penatlies.
there are a few people who go against their family wishes or colture idioms every where.
in football most games end in the 20-10 points result and  that is equivalent to 2-1 in soccer, and any leade is no sade, ask bayern  levekuzen the german team who lost 2-1 after 1-0 lead to manchester united in  the 90'th minute two goals were scored in less then a minute and that was in  the champions league final of 1999.
with football you get one amazing play in the course of a game, and it gets on the replays all night.
you said "cute little uniforms", as if other sports don't have those.
then again,  since football is so much more difficult and intricate, maybe you can't truly  enjoy it until you reach the highest levels, i.e. pro, college, or to a lesser  degree high school (i never made it past middle school.
we didn't save your pusillanimous asses from hitler to put up with this kind of piss poor attitude.
what startegies are there in soccer?
the game is static more often then not on the meantime a below avarage soccer game bitween to israeli teams was more fluid.
posts: 673 | registered: sep 2003 | ip: logged | all in all i think it is a colture thing.
on the other hand, the patriots beat injun nana last night, so i'll go with american football.
i don't mean to start a flame war in the sports forum, but the way i see it, that's what you're doing.
as for the players, most players dont fake injuries, infact if a player is catched by the referee he gets a yellow card.
but in soccer the game is continous and fast not like in football where plays  as you said last 4 seconds, most of them fail, and bitween each play you need  to wait a couple of minutes.
every  play is a mini chess game, and requires much higher levels of thinking than  soccer.
just  for one of many things, in football players have more than one duty as well.
gah, and i thought baseball was bad for schedules.
pm no, sorry, soccer gamess do not have 4 goals on average.

they don't even have three.
each sport has different physical requirements.
pm ok, hannibal, you're on the losing end of an argument.
it is a good thing that soccer is for millions of little kids...

each play is a battle of wits between the offense and the defense.
the rb has to guard against the blitz before he runs with the ball, the wr may  have to block, and even offensive linemen have to both protect the quarterback  and create holes for the runner.

but hardly condescending .i did say it was just my opinion.
are you really trying to argue that "cute little uniforms" isn't a put-down?
when are they on, 3 am on espn 2?
but i am an american at heart and if i were to watch something on tv it would probably be american football.
let them have soccer.
you have to anticipate what your enemy is going to bring, and choose your own strategy accordingly, all before the ball is snapped.
ron member member # 1698 posted september 11, 2004 12:02 am i prefer watching crickett to baseball, but american football to soccer.
every team has a  playbook that weighs 10 pounds!
@richard quote: football (american rugby) is more fun to watch and futbawl (american soccer) is more fun to play.
soccer is for little kids.
i edit the football section there.
the redskins-tampa game is about to start on fox sports (59 on sattelite, 60 on cable).
as for fluency -it's a different tempo altogether.
if a goal whould count as 7 points then the game will be better?
i watched the game bitween washington and tampa bay, and it just proved my point.
finally, i believe football is better, because it's the ultimate fan game.

as for faking injuries - they do it in hoops too, and even in football you'll see wr's trying to draw interference calls.
even a superb athlete like randi moss would most probably look foolish trying to dribble a soccer ball.
to me rugby is a real man's game, though i cannot necessarily say that i would play for the bingham cup in the uk.
watching these prima donnas flop around on the  field because someone stepped on their toe makes me sick.

and no lead is safe (ask oilers' fans).
but football has aesthetically pleasing elements and primally-appealing elements that soccer simply doesn't.
i can compare them in the way of... how shall i put it, soccer looks better to the eye ?
then the goalie kicks the ball back to the middle of the field and we start all over again.
pm try to watch some games from the brazilan national team maybe then you will see that soccer is the best sport.
and what do you mean, "what strategy is there in football?"?

what are they down to, 4 teams?
but most of the people like the team their father liked, and stuff like that.

i don't think they have patrol boats off the coast of spain picking up flimsy rafts full of americans trying to sneak into europe so they can start a better life.
i didnt say i hate football, i am one of those few israelis who know the rules and sometimes i watch it on espn but to me soccer is the best sport.
i guess football is a lot of strategy, like chess, but watching it is  just about as interesting.

soccer doesn't have 10% the strategy of football, and i love both games.
i know that here i am  outnumbered 100 to 1
i had hardly ever heard of rugby before visiting new zealand now i like it as much if not more than american football.
and as ricky said, soccer at its best, is the best sport in the world.
so i assume they're from europe, too.
why, the freakin' matches
