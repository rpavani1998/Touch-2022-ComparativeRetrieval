millions of little kids can feel important and part of the team when there is no way they could ever play basketball or real football.fans can track every minute detail of their teams, second-guess every decision, stress about every injury, argue endlessly about a third and 5, and even build their own teams.kids simply don't have the mental and physical skills necessary to play football the way it's supposed to be played, although just playing flag football, or everybody-run-down-the-field-and-i'll-throw-it football, was always a lot of fun.they can get good exercise and wear a cute uniform and its is great for them.but football has aesthetically pleasing elements and primally-appealing elements that soccer simply doesn't.since football plays happen every few minutes (ad space?) and last about fifteen seconds, i actually feel that the extended plays in soccer move a little faster and have players thinking on their feet, and they give me more time to see specific players in action.as for the players, most players dont fake injuries, infact if a player is catched by the referee he gets a yellow card.in football, on the other hand, each play is executed at full speed, with full effort.millions of little kids can feel important and part of the team when [/b] there is no way they could ever play basketball or real footballit is a good thing that soccer is for millions of little kids...each side fights for the advantage, trying to dictate the play to the other team.every play is a mini chess game, and requires much higher levels of thinking than soccer.soccer is the ultimate fan game because the fans can also suggest and yell tactics to the coach, they can also swear freely on the coach the players and the other team coach and players as for the score, so what?with football you get one amazing play in the course of a game, and it gets on the replays all night.the play is concentrated in the middle of the field, where the players give the ball back and forth to each other until someone breaks down the field and shoots the ball 20 feet wide of the net.
