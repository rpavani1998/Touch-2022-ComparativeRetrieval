that would suggest it is in the university’s best interest to invest in developing the necessary facilities for uk athletics independent of what such an investment might mean for the competitive success of the football and basketball teams.that elevated level of play and increased interest in the football program has a tremendous impact on the economics.a combination arena/stadium might be the only way to get football facilities upgraded.those schools will throw money at their football programs because the fans make it a priority, and because, like uk basketball, it’s a virtual guaranteed money-maker.however, attracting more in-state students actually expands the tuition/cost deficit that state funding has to fill and more students in general further increases the demand pressure on the commonwealth’s limited bonding capacity to expand dorms, classrooms, etc. – accentuating the funding problem for uk athletics.they have to have the ability to borrow money, and that province is reserved to a board of trustees that is very reluctant to dole out the ability to borrow cash to athletics.the basketball program is the sacred cow at kentucky, and it will get what it needs one way or the other.a conference full of great teams cannibalizes itself in football.we need to maximize our current situation first – we have to fill the stadium for games by raising the level of play and giving the fans a reason to go to the game and back the program with dollars.interest rates are low but so are state revenues.while such a sum would be enough to build a new basketball arena or renovate commonwealth, it probably couldn’t do both and certainly couldn’t cover the full cost of building a new football stadium.if they are going to sink more money into athletics, it’s going to be into basketball, where there is a virtual guaranteed roi.having discussed the big ticket items above, a large number of the projects kentucky athletics would like to build would be much smaller and, although geared toward improving recruiting or the competitive success of our various teams, they wouldn’t be expected to materially bring more money into uk athletics.suffice it to say that the football program has a lot of competition for the dollars it needs to upgrade facilities.i do expect that sports economics (read: football becoming the overriding factor in reorganization) will eventually force the university to rethink its priorities.
