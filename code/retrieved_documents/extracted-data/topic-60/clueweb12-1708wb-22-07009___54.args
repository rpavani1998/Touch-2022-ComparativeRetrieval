nevala was willing to help provide insight into how notre dame’s large recruiting budget is spent.
the $250,000.00 million dollar state-of-the-art facility is also home to memphis’ nba team, the grizzlies.
add that $2.4 million to the incremental $3.35 million from the media rights deal, and now san diego state is $5.75 million ahead on revenue by switching conferences.
memphis also has a decent football facility in the liberty bowl memorial stadium.
according to stitt, leach was impressed with what he saw.
although this data is not perfect, it is the only data available for both public and private institutions.
with respect to the performance data the bcs will rely upon to select 2014-2017′s aq conferences, only 2010′s data is currently available.
however, with his kind disposition and impressive academic record, there was no question that hahn would become a successful professional, whether it was in the nfl or elsewhere.
while ranking 40th in all of the ncaa is arguably an impressive feat, memphis will likely have to increase its recruiting budget to keep up with those of its new big east peers.
by securing schools which will participate in football who have proven records of recent success on the football field as new members, the big east will chip away at wvu’s claims and likely secure its participation in the conference for the next 27-months.

connecticut also has the highest average women’s sports assistant coaching salary.
b. costs as noted above, tcu was set to join the big east.
in terms of recruiting expenses, the fighting irish of notre dame put up a good fight when stacked against other programs’ spending.
while the premature death of hahn arguably fueled the colorado school of mines orediggers to win on the football field in 2004, the coaching of the team by stitt during that season and in subsequent years provided the team with the skills necessary to be competitive.
on a morning in early august 2004, when in previous years, his teammates would have been busy on the gridiron during two-a-days, hahn’s teammates were dressed in freshly pressed black suits and sitting in the front pews of a catholic church in hahn’s hometown of aurora, colorado.
tcu’s move to the big 12 presents several incentives which will be enjoyed by the university and conference.
the big east has steadfastly maintained that it will hold syracuse and pittsburgh to its bylaws, which require that teams give 27-months’ notice of their intent to leave and pay a $5 million exit fee.
this ranking makes dallas the highest-rated tv market for all of texas.
recruiting it is no secret that texas is a hotbed for high school football talent.
all in all, numerous factors make ucf a very favorable candidate for big east expansion.
more difficult to quantify are issues like the impact on football student-athletes from a more demanding travel schedule, the effect that playing lower ranked teams has on recruiting and quality of experience for every other team in the department, and the overall message that accompanies the move.
with the move of the football team to the big east, sdsu had to find a new home for all of the other sports since the mountain west was no longer interested in having the school without football.
hahn could not give a serious reason for why he wanted to change his number, but he knew he wanted to.
in all, memphis appears to be a worthy candidate for big east membership.

reports indicate that tcu will have to pay the big east a $5 million exit fee.
automatic qualifier arguably one of the biggest factors the big east is concerned with when extending invitations to universities to join the conference, is that it maintains its bcs automatic qualifier status.
what stitt was able to do with a group of engineers that season was not lost on other coaches.
thus, while for some it may seem preposterous that tcu was willing to fork out $5 million to exit a conference it never played a game in, its board of trustees arguably realized the television revenue earning potential the school could reap through big 12 membership.
the team went 12-1, losing a bitter playoff game in pittsburg, kansas at a place called “the jungle.”
according to nevala, notre dame tries “to capture everything recruiting related” when reporting its figures to the department of education.

memphis will arguably be set to compete with the big east in terms of basketball.
wvu wide receiver tavon austin, who runs the 40-yard-dash in 4.3 seconds, scored four touchdowns using a play that stumped clemson’s defense.
the long-legged hahn was a talented kicker who also showed skill in punting.
given this, after 2007, stitt told the rmac commissioner that mines would never go back to play int eh game.
by moving to the big 12, tcu has arguably set itself on good footing to earn even larger amounts of money from one of the biggest revenue streams in college sports.
while likely a small factor when considered in the grand scheme of things, the university’s athletic department will incur much lower travel expenses by moving to the big 12.
a gain of $1.8 million per year could be a powerful incentive.

facilities while the big east is known for its basketball talent, it is also known for the spectacular facilities its teams get to play their basketball games in.
however, team’s performances between 2010 through 2013 will be used.
if the tigers can turn a profit and increase their recruiting expenses, memphis should be largely competitive in the conference.
telling by its name, it is also home to the liberty bowl game.
although this season the knights only have a 3-3 record, their success last season arguably depicts that they are a football team to contend with and someone who will help the big east maintain its bcs aq status.
nonetheless, the merits of the lawsuit will be hashed out between lawyers and ultimately a judge in a courtroom.
last season, the ucf knights finished ranked 25th in the bcs standings.
we participate in the university’s budget process.
adding houston, boise state, and two other schools for football gets the big east to 12 football members, which would yield a max of $2.4 million per institution from bcs participation if two schools were chosen to participate in bcs games.
under the current bcs arrangement, each conference whose team qualifies automatically for the bcs receives approximately $22.3 million in net revenue.
stitt granted his request and during his junior season, hahn played as number 12.
prior to the contract extension, he was earning around $1.6 million annually from his pitt salary.
there is a fairly straightforward analytical approach to evaluating that sort of move and in the case of san diego state, the financial bottom line would suggest that the move makes both dollars and sense.
for example, florida state’s football program showed a gain of approximately $14 million from ’09-’10 to ’10-’11.

according to nevala, the notre dame athletics department is committed to providing $20 million worth of revenue to the university.

, the fact that the conference is specifically seeking out institutions to create a 12-team football conference depicts a shift in its sport of choice.
therefore, long story short, the big east needs schools with successful football teams to join its conference and it needs them to join fast.
in 2010-11, memphis football had lower expenses and revenues than those of 2009-10, at $8,609,503.00, for a profit of $0.00.
thus, there clearly is a large range between the profits and losses incurred by big east teams in a given year.
last year sdsu earned more than $1 million profit from basketball operations on revenues of $4.7 million.
if sdsu approximated the rest of the big west as a result of lower level of competition, smaller venues, lower attendance, lower level recruits, etc., it would be reasonable to assume that sdsu basketball would become a break-even enterprise.
according to the us department of education, sdsu is currently spending $12.1 million on 121 football players, or $100.2k per player.
the mountain west median basketball profit was $300k on median revenues of $2.9 million, so sdsu has a very strong and successful position compared to their current peers.

for example, each school can decide for itself whether to break out television revenue by sport or leave it in a generic revenue category, which causes variances.
while ucf isn’t on the same level in terms of basketball talent as these schools, it will likely be able to compete.
the impact on the department as a whole would be a reduction in departmental revenues by several million dollars and departmental income available for supporting other sports/programs by $1 million.
if a football recruit is visiting for a game, this factor increases the cost of recruiting him.
using the modified fly sweep play in 2004, mines was able to break the school’s season passing record with 4,766 yards.
if the tigers can turn a profit and increase their recruiting expenses, memphis should be largely competitive in the conference.
about the data: all of the data is from reports each school files with the us department of education.
since sdsu is only participating in football in the big east, let’s assume that only 15% of staffing is attributed to football, or 2 ftes.

arguably, in finding a new member, the big east would want to find candidates on par with those schools leaving, so as to fill their “shoes” upon their departure.
for the big 12 although some believed the big 12 to be on its deathbed several weeks ago, the conference’s extension of an invitation to tcu was not one made out of pity for the university.
as coaches do, stitt continued to break down the play in his head to determine what he could do to make it successful.
however, one thing that hasn’t changed is the method by which mines recruits–a method unique to the school’s rigorous academic curriculum.
the data used for this analysis was obtained from reports filed by each school with the u.s. department of education, as required by title ix.
in terms of recruiting expenses, in 2010-11, memphis ranked 40th in the ncaa, spending a total of $961,150.00 on recruiting for all of its teams and $759,844.00 for its men’s teams.
the $250,000.00 million dollar state-of-the-art facility is also home to memphis’ nba team, the grizzlies.
halgorsen, smiling, responded, “well, my good friend bob stitt at the colorado school of mines, gave me that.”
securing a fourth texas school into its conference gives all big 12 members a significant advantage over other conferences in recruiting this talent.
last season, the horned frogs went undefeated in football and won the rose bowl.
as seenhere, this is not something that every basketball team accomplishes.
first, unlike sports like basketball where only a handful of student-athletes are recruited during a given year, a school can be recruiting upwards of fifty or more football players in a given recruiting year.
however, that same year, the uconn basketball team–which won the ncaa division i national championship–suffered losses of $417,181.00.
thus, memphis’ 48th ranking falls nicely in between pittsburgh and syracuse’s rankings, arguably pleasing the big east.
dana was working with the quarterbacks and he kind of noticed me.
the knights’ basketball team also is sitting pretty in terms of its facility.
calculating the average salaries of football competing members and non-football competing members (not taking into consideration notre dame in either calculation), head coaches of men’s sports of football competing schools earn 1.4 times as much as their non-football competing school counterparts.
the second consideration is the share of bcs revenue that a school in a conference with an automatic qualifying slot would gain as a result of their membership, assuming the conference has an equal revenue sharing agreement.
arguably, in finding a new member, the big east would want to find candidates on par with those schools leaving, so as to fill their “shoes” upon their departure.
that being said, its 11th hour switch to the big 12 does not come without financial consequences.
with four big 12 teams being located in texas, a recruit who signs with a big 12 team will play at least four games a season in his home state.
in 2010-11, memphis men’s basketball had expenses and revenues of $6,739,131.00, for a profit of $0.00.
given that memphis has invested in its facilities, it is certain that other big east teams and their fans will enjoy traveling to memphis to watch their teams compete.
additionally, another school the big east reportedly has its eyes on–the university of houston–only had football revenue of $7,719,733.00 during the period.
at an average of $60k including benefits that would require an additional $720k per year to match the big east and $540k per year to reach mountain west norms.
with quarterback phenom case keenum, houston has only kept up with its notoriety of scoring many points.
the game fell during finals for mines students.
however, the size of the big east’s exit fee and tcu’s willingness to pay it signals just how much the school expects to gain financially by joining the big 12.
with memphis set to announce its departure to the big east today, is the pairing a good fit? basketball one thing is certain:  the big east is known for its basketball talent.
ucf boasts football revenue that is on par with other big east schools.

the new pac 12 contract, which will begin with the 2012-13 season, will be worth more than $225 million per year — or $2.7 billion over the life of the deal, according to the sports business daily and the associated press.
seeing that notre dame spent $376,114.00 more than the next highest recruiting spender (alabama) in the ncaa, leads one to wonder what exactly the $2,070,316.00 was spent on.
that year, it also broke the school’s completions record (401) and yards in a season record (6,894).
however, one thing is certain: the mines football team had found its 12th man.
the chart is sorted by ’10-11 profits for each football and men’s basketball program from greatest profit to least.
add that to the increased spending per player and you get an annual operating expense increase of $1.57 million per year, which still leaves a tidy net gain of $4.18 million per year by switching football to the big east.
holgorsen was an assistant coach under leach, so it is likely then that holgorsen first was introduced to stitt’s fly sweep play, or what holgorsen calls, “quick.”
the big east is also party to a second-tier television rights contract with cbs worth $54 million.
in 2010-11, the following big east schools ranked and spent as follows in terms of recruiting: notre dame: 3rd, $2,070,316.00 marquette: 11th, $1,461,373.00 louisville: 25th, $1,128,645.00 thus, memphis will now be recruiting against schools with much larger recruiting budgets.
that season, stitt realized that the play was taking too much time to practice for the amount of benefits mines was receiving from it.
thereafter, stitt showed keenum how to run the play.

geno auriemma, the head coach of the successful connecticut women’s basketball team, reportedly earned $1.6 million in salary last year.
additionally, wvu was in a position to make these claims in an attempt to free itself of the 27-month notice provision because of the fact that the departure of pitt, syracuse and tcu arguably adversely impacted the state of the conference.
given that memphis has invested in its facilities, it is certain that other big east teams and their fans will enjoy traveling to memphis to watch their teams compete.
otherwise, wvu may be packing its bags as soon as next season.
the athletics department’s ability to turn over $20 million worth of revenue to the university as a result of its football team’s success is arguably a reason why nearly one-half of notre dame’s entire recruiting budget is spent by the football team.
it is the only available data for both public and private universities.
in all, memphis appears to be a worthy candidate for big east membership.
to rise to the median level of football spending in the big east that would require an incremental $12k per player, or $1.45 million per year.
we got done and it was early afternoon, so i went over to the university of houston to see if they were practicing.
at one point late in the season this year both houston and boise state were ranked in the top 10 in the bcs, which would mean $28.9 million for the big east if both had been members and chosen for bcs games.
after all, the historic significance of collegiate athletic conferences has been to organize a group of universities around a common sense of mission, history, size, and geographic location in order to create affiliations and rivalries that benefit all involved.
all in all, it appears that tcu’s move to the big 12 is a win-win situation for the university and the conference.
likely, the bcs’s television contracts and the bowls themselves will drive the exact criteria used in selecting aq conferences.
the highest average men’s sports head coaching salary is paid by pittsburgh, while the highest average women’s sports head coaching salary is paid by connecticut.
the current big east practice is to split the total package with 70% going to football and 30% to basketball.
in the case of sdsu, the biggest factor is the effect on what is currently a very successful basketball program.
that being said, when recruiting, the first thing stitt looks at is not how fast a kid can run the 40-yard-dash or how much he can bench press.
under the best case scenario, where the big east lands a media rights deal worth $90 million a year and has two teams in bcs games, sdsu stands to gain $4.18 million per year after deducting incremental spending on football.
memphis ranks as the48th largest television market.
we also fund all of our sports’ scholarships, so that tends to lead to a little bit more national recruiting,” noted nevala.
that season, the mines football team recorded its best record in school history.
furthermore, the data provided is for the 2010-11 school year.
on average, men’s sports head coaches earn 3.2 times as much as their women’s sports counterparts.
geography along with providing the big 12 with a connection to the fifth-largest media market, geography likely factored heavily into both tcu and the big 12′s decision to join forces.
most would balk at the thought of a school shelling out $5 million to swap out its conference affiliation.
this $20 million is additional to the amount of money the athletics department spends to fund all of the department’s scholarships.
thus, ucf’s football revenue puts it on par with other schools presently in the big east and those set to join the conference.
# 12 patches were sown onto the chests of player’s jerseys.
given the projected membership above, that leaves a $5.25 million share for football only schools, a $1.687 million share for basketball only schools, and a $6.937 million share for full members.
like st. john’s, which plays its home games at madison square garden, memphis also has an impressive basketball facility.
for instance, hotel prices in south bend, indiana, where notre dame is located, skyrocket when the fighting irish are playing a home football game.
under that scenario, san diego state could be increasing their annual take from football media rights from $1.9 million to $5.25 million, for a net gain of $3.35 million.
another interesting feature of the big east, is that it has both football competing members and non-football competing members.
if the receiver doesn’t slow down while making the play, the team runs the risk of fumbling the ball.
on october 27, 2011, wvu was invited by the big 12 to become a member of the conference.
he mentioned that the previous season, hahn came into stitt’s office and asked to change his number to 12.
in 2010-11, big east competitor louisville turned a $27,551,289.00 profit with its men’s basketball team.
however, on the other end of the spectrum, the worst case scenario could cost sdsu approximately $770,000 per year, which would involve no increased media rights deal and loss of aq status in the big east and decreased basketball revenue consistent with typical big west basketball revenue.
we have a net revenue target that we have to meet for the campus.
the “% invested” column shows how much of the specific sport’s revenue goes back into that specific sport.
last year the big west median revenue on basketball was $1.4 million and not a single school reported a profit, with several losing money.
these reports are the only public documentation providing numbers for every school, because private schools are not subject to public records requests, yet have to file their data with the u.s. department of education.
wvu can argue that the loss of the number-three ranked team unduly damaged the big east’s chances of becoming an aq conference in 2014-2017.
the stadium was built as part of a $60 million construction project, which also included building practice fields for the knights’ football, soccer and baseball teams.
after meeting holgorsen two years prior at a one-back clinic, stitt found himself in houston for a mines alumni golf tournament fundraiser.
when looking at the business aspects of this move, it’s clear why the big east has its eyes on ucf.
the tigers will likely make another run this march.
we’ve been really successful getting engineers who can play football,” said stitt.
the real crux of wvu’s lawsuit is that the exodus of schools from the conference has left the big east unstable.
since tcu never joined the conference as a participating member, it was not held to the notice provision but was only required to pay the $5 million exit fee.
at the same time, that big east deal pales when compared to the other conference negotiations in the last several years.
the $20 million worth of revenue provided by the athletics department to the university is used by the university to fund other students’ financial aid and to cover operating expenses.
based on a $90 million annual package, there would be $63 million for football and $27 million for basketball.
thus, although tcu’s football revenue is less than its new big 12 peers’, it was larger than teams in the big east.
the facility boasts an impressive five levels and over 100 concession stands.
rather, the big 12 clearly realized the money-making potential tcu brings to the conference.
wvu uses the factual scenarios related to the departure of big east member schools to allege that the big east failed to proactively maintain a level of competition, the remaining six football schools and eight non-football schools creates an imbalance and disparity of power and the current state of the big east means that it is expected to lose its bcs aq status.
the school is the second-largest in terms of enrollment, after arizona state university.
in fact, its basketball teams perform so well, that it is one of the only conferences which earned more money from its basketball teams than its football teams.
nevala also noted that travel expenses are higher depending upon when a recruit visits notre dame.
ranking tcu: 3 boise state: 10 west virginia: 22 ucf: 25 thus, in terms of maintaining aq status for 2014-2017, tcu’s decision to join the big 12 over the big east was more detrimental than syracuse and pitt’s departures.
the tigers basketball teams call the 18,119 seat fedexforum home.
when contacted for comment fsu explained that in ’10-’11 they broke out contributions by sport, which they hadn’t done previously.
staying closer to home undoubtedly curbs travel expenses.
in order to match big east average staffing levels sdsu would have to add a total of 12 staff ftes.
even legendary louisville basketball coach, rick pitino, called for the conference to add memphis to its stable of schools.
there were rumblings that his abilities could land him in the nfl.
market orlando is a huge market that the big east would be smart to tap into.
notre dame also had the highest recruitment expenses for its women’s sports programs in 2010-11.
facilities ucf’s facilities are set for the big stage.
one way to quickly measure and benchmark athletic staffing levels is to evaluate the number of full time equivalent positions in each department as reported on their websites.
stitt estimates the team spendss $30,000.00 to $40,000.00 in recruiting new players.
i knew that dana had gotten the job there, and i walked right onto the field.
like st. john’s, which plays its home games at madison square garden, memphis also has an impressive basketball facility.
while ranking 40th in all of the ncaa is arguably an impressive feat, memphis will likely have to increase its recruiting budget to keep up with those of its new big east peers.
however, in announcing that it will join the big 12 in 2012, tcu effectively exited the big east before ever competing within the conference.
arguably, as long as memphis stays out of the red, it should be able to compete financially with other big east members.
in 2009-10, memphis football had expenses and revenues of $11,557,329.00, for a profit of $0.00.
the 8 basketball only members would be: depaul, georgetown, marquette, notre dame, providence, seton hall, st. john’s, and villanova.
while nevala confirmed that the vast majority of recruiting expenses incurred by every notre dame team are travel related, he also explained that it’s possible that notre dame’s recruiting expenses appear significantly higher than other those of other schools, because notre dame is comprehensive in how it defines recruiting expenses.
it is safe to say, that stitt has brought success to mines football.
