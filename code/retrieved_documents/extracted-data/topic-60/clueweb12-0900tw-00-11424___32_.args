the primary purpose of a six-year scholarship is to give athletes whose playing days have ended a chance to get their degrees — and to really have time to focus on classes that can prepare them for a future without football or basketball.it would allow players to take fewer courses during their years of athletic eligibility, giving them a better chance to succeed at the courses they do take.legitimizing relations between agents and college athletes would be another huge improvement, because players could get good advice about their professional prospects.it is meant to ensure that no matter what your status on the team, you can still live like other students on campus — maybe even a tad better — even if you come from a disadvantaged background.by the time most players realize that they are not going to make it to the professional ranks, so much time has been lost that they can never catch up academically.they realize that having universities in charge of a major form of american entertainment is far from ideal, but they are also realistic enough to know that scaling back big-time college sports is implausible, given the money at stake.schools that truly couldn’t afford to pay their players would be forced to de-emphasize football and men’s basketball — and, perhaps, regain their identity as institutions of higher learning.baseball and hockey players have a choice that football and basketball players don’t have: they can go pro as soon as they leave high school, thanks to the existence of minor leagues.the n.c.a.a. would no longer need to obsess over an athlete’s academic performance; as long as he met the same standard the school applied to every other student, he could stay in school and play on the team.and it would make it possible for those players who do graduate within four years to pursue a graduate degree.the extra two years would place the onus on the athlete to get an education, while also giving him the opportunity.fans will be able to enjoy football and men’s basketball without having to avert their eyes from the scandals and the hypocrisy.college sports will become more honest once players are paid, and more honorable.basketball teams would use $325,000 on minimum salaries, and have another $325,000 to allocate as they wish among players.if the time comes when women’s basketball is as commercialized and profit-driven as men’s basketball, then yes, the women should be paid as well.
