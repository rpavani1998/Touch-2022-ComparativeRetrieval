believe it or not, the run game comes basically verbatim from what the university of colorado did in the early 1990s (except for the option runs, of course) — football is not as complicated as people think.
moreover, walsh often combined the two zone beaters — the horizontal and vertical stretch — with the third category, the man beating concept, into a single “triangle” read that also was designed to defeat man coverage.
it is important for the quarterback to pre-read the coverage to get an indication of the coverage, but, more importantly, a progression read requires the quarterback to know where each of the receivers will be given the pattern called.
as anyone who reads this site knows, all football begins as arithmetic.
increasingly, the answer to this has been to package concepts together, such that the quarterback has different options depending on what the defense does after the snap.

in essence, the quarterback reads defenders, who dictate where the ball will go.
while both players were impressive in their play-action fakes — and someone like peyton manning is even more impressive — if you’re a linebacker or safety and you see a pulling guard, you basically can’t help but tell yourself: “it’s a run.”
progression reads require the coach/quarterback not have their mind made up ahead of time.
(more…) given that humans lack clairvoyance, there is no such thing as the perfect play-caller and thus much of the development in football strategy has centered on how to get into (or out of) a given play because the defense is well suited to defend the one that was called.

if #1 throttles down, the lb will come off #2 and get to his zone.
if #2 is a te or wing, then one of the stack backers (sam, will, whatever) is responsible for seam elimination (as we like to call it).
it is no surprise then that maybe the two best play-action teams in college football season were stanford and baylor, two teams that just so happened to produce the two best quarterbacks in college football, andrew luck and robert griffin iii.
brian cook of mgoblog put up some photos from last week’s game between michigan and indiana, where michigan pulled out the victory but indiana’s ben chappellthrew for 480 yards and three tds, by completing over 70% of his passes.
this works because of numbers: there are three receivers against two short defenders; the deep safety is not in position to tackle the bubble for a short gain.
but now that the game is here, there’s one aspect that absolutely is at the top of my list: the game features arguably the two best quarterbacks in the league who run undoubtedly the best — and most interesting offenses.
â the best vertical or horizontal stretches use more than two receivers, with three or more receivers being used in various “zone flood” routes.
the answer,most coaches would agree, is most anything you like, especially with the techniques michigan used.
i’d say that if you play cover two against trips (which can definitely be done — more on that later), the first thing an opposing coach will try you with is the smash with a divide or seam/post right down the middle.
for a 3-3-5 defense, the alignment of the #2 reciever changes who is responsible for this.
typically, manning gets the ball snapped with under six seconds left on the play clock; he both wants to take his time surveying the defense and limit late shifts before the snap.
if you caught the defense in the right look it was mathematically impossible for them to defend you: if you ran the three-level flood route against cover 2, they had two guys (a corner and a safety) to defend three receivers; and if you caught a cover 3/4-under defense with your all-curl concept, it was easy pick’ins: all this has been detailed before, and if you can identify what coverage you are facing it is still better to run a true three-level vertical stretch or five-receiver horizontal stretch against the right coverage — if you get that right, there’s very little the defense can do.
the base play looks like this: the post and the wheel are “alert” routes, in that they aren’t part of the basic reads but the quarterback can look at them first if the defense gives it.
the play-pass is the one fundamentally sound football play that does everything possible to contradict the basic principles of defense.
this is a great concept, but is quarterback intensive: the quarterback has to look for the quick pass and then reset his feet with depth and then go through another progression — not something every quarterback can do.
if the perfect pass play was the holy grail of modern football, then the triangle is its best personification to date and walsh its galahad.
the play-pass is one of the best ways to cool all of that emotion and intensity down because the object of the play-pass is to get the defensive team to commit to a fake run and then throw behind them.

play-action from under center: play-action from shotgun: on passing downs and when peyton is in the shotgun, you’ll see most of the traditional routes that other teams run, but far and away his favorite is the “levels” play.
all of the major “new” (in relative terms) passing concepts are based on a triangle read.
they rarely shift and instead rely on peyton to get them to the line and find the appropriate play.
while much is rightfully made about whether a quarterback does an effective job of selling a run fake on play-action, the reality is that the offensive line plays just as big of a role in convincing a defense that a play is a run.
even then, there were two things i knew i wanted: (1) my system would establish itself with the dropback pass and (2) i was going to give the quarterback as many options as possible on a given pass play.
this isn’t always possible, and the fade is an outside release play, but that should be the goal every time it is called.
even as a college player, i would sit in meetings or pick up a game plan handout and roll my eyes when i saw these words attached to a pass play.
another go-to concept is three-verticals, though manning likes to look for the inside slight off play-action as a quick throw right behind the linebackers.
in reviewing the game film of both players, i couldn’t help but marvel at how many of their touchdown passes were well designed, well executed “shot plays” that, while impressive, pretty much just required both quarterbacks to throw the ball to wide open receivers.
once the jam and re-route is accomplished, the lb will key #1.
colts the show peyton runs is amazing not only because of its effectiveness, but also because of its simplicity.
widen the seam route to the corner’s zone, or outside 1/3.
alabama came outin a quarters or split safety look, but there was some coverage bust (it’s hard to say exactly but it was probably the cornerback chasing the post route all the way inside, as shown in the video below).
it’s a wide trips bunch (trips but detached from the formation), the corner isn’t in position to get a jam, and you’re outnumbered.
this kind of read calls for throwing the ball with rhythm drops — i.e. on a five-step drop, the ball is thrown to the first receiver when the fifth step hits (the“rhythm” throw), the second receiver after a hitch-up or gather step (the“read” or “gather” throw), and the third receiver after resetting the feet.
typically the linebacker runs with the slot and the quick five yarder is open, but once he’s hit that a few times manning will hit the inside square-in for an easy first down.
while much is rightfully made about whether a quarterback does an effective job of selling a run fake on play-action, the reality is that the offensive line plays just as big of a role in convincing a defense that a play is a run.
four verticals against cover 3 is not designed for the home run.
in that case you pick the most aggressive horizontal stretch of them all,four verticals.
the insight behind the triangle is that the horizontal and the vertical stretch are combined to create a single straightforward read for the quarterback that provides answers no matter what the defense presents.
i see petrino’s version as essentially the meshing of a pro style approach with a college sensibility; the reads are simple but there are nuances built in so that it works against almost any coverage.
that’s all well and good, but is still cumbersome and, most importantly, the defense can still make the offense wrong after the quarterback has made his decision at the line.
my talent would never have allowed for me to dream of playing after college (i considered myself blessed to be there), and i always knew i would go into coaching.
they fit together through a system of pattern variations, or “tags,” which i’ve created to give the quarterback a well defined method of attacking the full width and depth of pass defenses.
this worked for the same reason the bubble screen worked: the cornerback (one guy) can’t guard two guys (the corner route and the flat route).

once you get the defensive team distracted and disoriented, they begin to think about options and, therefore, are susceptible to the running game.
and a huge part of that was because both of their offenses involved heavy doses of play-action with pulling linemen.
the read is the same though: alert (post/wheel), shallow to square-in to comeback.

in the passing system i have coached myself (and have since installed for my clients on a consultant basis), pass plays have “frontside” and “backside” component.
because football is governed by its immutable twins of strategy — arithmetic and geometry — these remain the foundation for all effective pass plays: simple stuff vertical stretches — these place two or three receivers at different levels vertically up the field to “stretch” the defense.
play-action from under center: play-action from shotgun: on passing downs and when peyton is in the shotgun, you’ll see most of the traditional routes that other teams run, but far and away his favorite is the “levels” play.

against press man coverage,he should get the defender’s feet moving; the goal is not to get “around” the defender but to get through him, by making the defender move and then having the receiver run on a path immediately past him.
but,â of course, it’s not so easy to figure out what coverage the defense is in before the play; indeed, with the advent of combo coverages and pre- and post-snap shifts,â it’s often is difficult to even determine what the coverage was evenafter the play.
on the actual play, the corner sat on the flat route and the corner route — one on one with the safety who had no help to either the inside or outside, and thus had little chance to make a play — was wide open.
from bunch, the outside receiver widens on his hitch route to get the corner to widen and then simply breaks down.
this isn’t always possible, and the fade is an outside release play, but that should be the goal every time it is called.
baylor, being a spread team, typically used the vaunted“inverted veer” play, which is the spread offense’s read-based adaptation of the old power-o. regardless, for opponents of both, a pulling guard meant trouble for stanford’s and baylor’s opponents run defenses, which, through the use of play-action, in turn meant trouble for their pass defense.
the qb is coached to look off the free safety and throw to the #2 receiver away from him.
this worked for the same reason the bubble screen worked: the cornerback (one guy) can’t guard two guys (the corner route and the flat route).
the corner and safety drop deep, and the advantage of running the shallow to this side is the tight alignment brings the linebackers in, and the shallow ends up able to outflank those guys.
once you get the defensive team distracted and disoriented, they begin to think about options and, therefore, are susceptible to the running game.
we were taught sound mechanics and fundamentals and our system was a complex pro-style system.
the great thing about the smash is that you can outnumber the secondary both horizontally across the field (three guys running deep and stretching two deep safeties) but also vertically (high/low of the cornerback).
indeed, the play-action pass is probably the best weapon offenses have, one far too often underutilized by modern spread offenses.
as anyone who reads this site knows, all football begins as arithmetic.
it is frustrating for coaches to watch because they can see that a receiver who is later in the progression is wide open.
this conjures up the idea that the receiver’s job is to release off the ball and immediately start “fading” to the sideline, where the quarterback has to throw it to an increasingly vanishing spot between the defender and the sideline.
the weakness of the triangle stretch is that it’s typically only possible to only get a two-man horizontal or vertical stretch, whereas with a true “flood” you can place three (or more) receivers across the field on a given plane to truly defeat a defense.
the backside split end going deep, and, as a result, the trips side safety has to make a very unfortunate choice between one receiver breaking for the post and another breaking for the corner.

for the passing game, on early downs they run a lot of play-action, where the goal is either to beat the defense deep (through post routes and go routes) or to hit a deep void with a deep crossing route or corner.

man or “object receiver” reads — these are not necessarily distinct from the above horizontal and vertical stretches, but the focus is on having a route or combination of routes that will defeat man-to-man coverage.
were it not third and 16, the automatic adjustment you’d see against this defensive look is thebubble screen.
too often young receivers want to outside release, get jammed, and can barely get off the line of scrimmage or get run basically out of bounds.
this works because of numbers: there are three receivers against two short defenders; the deep safety is not in position to tackle the bubble for a short gain.
this conjures up the idea that the receiver’s job is to release off the ball and immediately start “fading” to the sideline, where the quarterback has to throw it to an increasingly vanishing spot between the defender and the sideline.
although a defense has some options and disguise some things, there are only so many things a defense can do: they might be able to disguise press or loose coverage, or rotate the secondary or send an unexpected blitzer, but they can’t move a cornerback from one side of the field to the other after the snap, and there might be blitzers but there are only so many candidates.

although a defense has some options and disguise some things, there are only so many things a defense can do: they might be able to disguise press or loose coverage, or rotate the secondary or send an unexpected blitzer, but they can’t move a cornerback from one side of the field to the other after the snap, and there might be blitzers but
a simple way to think about it is to tell the receiver to get no wider than a yard outside the numbers (i.e. the big numbers on the field between the hashmarks and the sideline).
i am honored to host his excellent article on smart football.
indeed, quarterbacks have called audibles at the line of scrimmage for decades, and a few years ago the hot idea was calling multiple plays in the huddle.
especially since run plays that involve a pulling guard means one thing: “power,” in the lowercase sense of lots of bodies will be at the point of attack so the defense needs to match numbers as well.
thus if you want to break someone downfield, you need to send three guys deep.
but now that the game is here, there’s one aspect that absolutely is at the top of my list: the game features arguably the two best quarterbacks in the league who run undoubtedly the best — and most interesting offenses.
surprisingly, however, this supposedly natural skill — the ability to locate and throw the ball to an open receiver — is taught in a variety of ways, some more effective than others.
examples include themesh concept from the airraid, bunch passes and option-routes.
the best vertical or horizontal stretches use more than two receivers, with three or more receivers being used in various “zone flood” routes.
the answer has been to combine plays but to simplify the reads for the quarterback.
all of the major “new” (in relative terms) passing concepts are based on a triangle read.
the base play looks like this: the post and the wheel are “alert” routes, in that they aren’t part of the basic reads but the quarterback can look at them first if the defense gives it.
the shallow cross is, quite possibly, the best pass play in football: almost any quarterback can complete it; almost any receiver can run it (though there is more nuance than maybe one might initially realize to a good shallow route); it is a way to get “speed in space” without requiring a big arm; it works against most all coverages; and throwing a few of these tends to open up big plays downfield as defenders creep up.
third, consistent with the above two points, the receiver should actually try to lean into the defender as he bursts upfield.
thus if you want to break someone downfield, you need to send three guys deep.
if #2 is a te or wing, then one of the stack backers (sam, will, whatever) is responsible for seam elimination (as we like to call it).
most of these yards came from underneath throws, but chappell hit a few big plays, including abig gainer on third and 16.
because football is governed by its immutable twins of strategy — arithmetic and geometry — these remain the foundation for all effective pass plays: simple stuff these three categories essentially made up the full panoply of choices for the passing game for, well, for a really long time.
(more…) this past weekend saw that old classic, the fade route, used to win a couple huge games in the sec: the game winner in the lsu-florida game was a fade (the second try), and south carolina’s alshon jeffrey caught several big time fade passes against formerly #1 alabama.
petrino moves his guys around a bit, but, the key feature is that unlikethe airraid guys, he has his runningback and his shallow going to the same side: the back runs a wheel route to pull the underneath coverage to the sideline and up the sideline, while the other two receivers run a post and a square-in, and on the backside the receiver runs a comeback.
more typically, the goal is to hit the shallow, as the read is shallow to square-in to comeback on the backside.
by using the play-pass as an integral pant of your offense you are trying to take advantage of a defensive team that is very anxious very intense and very fired-up to play football.
but let’s say iu wanted to be more aggressive and wanted to attack more than just the corner; let’s say they wanted to put pressure — and get a numbers advantage — against both the cornerbackand the safeties.
the backside safety is occupied by the backside split end going deep, and, as a result, the trips side safety has to make a very unfortunate choice between one receiver breaking for the post and another breaking for the corner.
i truly believe it is the single best tool available to take advantage of a disciplined defense.
i don’t believe he can take away a seam and be able to get to a curl against quality qb/wr combos.)(more…) posted in the category: passing 19 comments smart football super bowl preview: manning vs. brees sunday, 07 february 2010 , by : chris give the media two weeks before the super bowl and they will find every weird angle to take to fill the void: who has the best food (uh, not indianapolis);what u.s. presidents are like what super bowl (in a matchup between super bowl iii, with broadway joe, against thomas jefferson, the third president, jefferson won because he “wanted it more.”); and opinion from every blustery ex-player and coach that can be found.
for a 3-3-5 defense, the alignment of the #2 reciever changes who is responsible for this.

this limitation means that a triangle can be throttled by certain coverages that rotate to the triangle side.
colts the show peyton runs is amazing not only because of its effectiveness, but also because of its simplicity.
from bunch, the outside receiver widens on his hitch route to get the corner to widen and then simply breaks down.
the great thing about the smash is that you can outnumber the secondary both horizontally across the field (three guys running deep and stretching two deep safeties) but also vertically (high/low of the cornerback).
take away the quick seam throw by jamming and running with #2.
four verticals against cover 3 is not designed for the home run.
the route, at least from the receiver’s perspective, should be thought of as an almost totally vertical route.
this is an easy read but hard to get to quickly.
in the passing system i have coached myself (and have since installed for my clients on a consultant basis), pass plays have “frontside” and “backside” component.
oklamhoma sooners tickets to all games at oklahoma memorial stadium and away.
they fit together through a system of pattern variations, or “tags,” which i’ve created to give the quarterback a well defined method of attacking the full width and depth of pass defenses.
to make this work, the coaches and quarterback must understand the exact coverage called; there might be five receivers deployed but the coverage determines which two or three are “live” for the quarterback.
alabama came outin a quarters or split safety look, but there was some coverage bust (it’s hard to say exactly but it was probably the cornerback chasing the post route all the way inside, as shown in the video below).
especially since run plays that involve a pulling guard means one thing: “power,” in the lowercase sense of lots of bodies will be at the point of attack so the defense needs to match numbers as well.
the play-pass is one of the best ways to cool all of that emotion and intensity down because the object of the play-pass is to get the defensive team to commit to a fake run and then throw behind them.
indeed, the play-action pass is probably the best weapon offenses have, one far too often underutilized by modern spread offenses.
steve spurrier, of course, is one of the masters of the fade, and this isnot the first time lsu has won a big game on a well-thrown fade.
indeed, in all but specialty situations they have basically two personnel groups — two wide receivers, two tight-ends, and one running back and three wide receivers, one tight-end and one running back — and they have run the same few plays for the last decade.
