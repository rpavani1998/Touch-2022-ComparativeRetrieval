because basketball has degenerated from a serious sport into an entertainment business, and jordan, while he was a great player, was an even better entertainer.not only is he the most overrated basketball player in history, and an out-of-control megalomaniac.i am simply sick of the media worshipping him and holding him to a lesser standard than others are held to.however, he happens to be one of the greatest cooks in the world, so this proves that i am unbiased."when people call him thebest ever, it becomes obvious that they don't understandever, because they lack knowledge of basketball history.this site has only one purpose: to show that no matter what criteria is used, michael jordan is not the greatest player ever.if you think he is in your opinion, that is fine, but i simply ask that you first define your criteria for judging players, and then i will show that your very own criteria does not support the conclusion that jordan is #1.i grow tired of the hype of the media, saying he is "without a doubt the best ever", instead of, saying that he is "one of the best ever."it is for those who wanted to share a wilt thought or story.when you even the playing field, you see that he is not the best.i grow tired of the hype of the media, saying he is "without a doubt the best ever", instead of, saying that he is "one of the best ever."Â  because of the unfounded hype, i created a webpage using hype in the other extreme, in order to demonstrate the absurdity of the press.i don't care if you think that wilt chamberlain isnot the greatest player ever.one of the funniest parts is how people take it so seriously, so for added humorous benefit, iprint the hate mail and the praise mail.the most exhaustive page on the internet dedicated to the greatest player in nba history.his teammates won in spite of him.
