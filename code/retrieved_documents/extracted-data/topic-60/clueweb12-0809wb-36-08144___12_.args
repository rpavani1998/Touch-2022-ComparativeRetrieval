one great basketball player can make a larger impact, i suspect, than one great player in any other team sport.this was the end, the last time kansas and missouri will play each other in the rivalry game that has fueled winters in the midwest for more than 100 years.we know what success means, even if we can’t really say what it means.i think michael’s one of the best sportswriters in the country and we see things the same way the vast majority of the time.he thought that smith’s remarkable coaching record was the result of exceptional recruiting and his willingness to choke the life out of games.(us presswire) houston — basketball is probably the most predictable of all our team sports.he didn’t see north carolina’s famous four corners offense as an innovation as much as a cowardly manipulation of the rules.charles had lived a basketball life — he was an excellent college basketball player, of course.don’t worry, they said, in the years ahead missouri and kansas will probably renew the rivalry in some sort of annual game played in kansas city.right now, the estimate and charge is that about $1 million was siphoned away from the school and into the pockets of those employees.it was reading michael’s piece, and this sentence in particular — “if we wanted to be completelyfair, then football and basketball players would not be forced to subsidize non-revenue athletes” — that opened the door.read more… dean smith was a genius on the bench, managing every game with the same attention to detail.every time they got the ball, they pushed it up court — faster, always faster — this is how vcu plays, this is how their dynamic coach shaka smart coaches, this is how vcu won five games and made one of the more unlikely final four runs ever.no, people kept saying, missouri and kansas will probably play each other in the big 12 tournament, and that’s in just a couple weeks.he liked to make the point that both of north carolina’s national championships under dean smith were haunted by spectacular last-second gaffes by an opponent.
