it is an insidious thing.”
over the last few months, in consultation with sports economists, antitrust lawyers and reformers, i put together the outlines of what i believe to be a realistic plan to pay those who play football and men’s basketball in college.
but big-time football and men’s basketball are clearly commercial entertainment and have been pulled away from the fundamental purpose of a university.”
did — will be violating the n.c.a.a.’s rules regarding amateurism  and will probably face a multigame suspension.
the number of recruiting  violations would quite likely shrink to a negligible figure, as would most of  the scandals that involve players taking money.
it is also possible that the case could be decided or  settled narrowly — allowing former players to be compensated for the use  of their images but leaving the status of current players unchanged.
by the time most players realize that they are not going to make it to the professional ranks, so much time has been lost that they can never catch up academically.
hausfeld has been attacking the concept of amateurism head-on, and the n.c.a.a. has been defending it with equal fervor.
i would take that notion a step further, and have that organization represent current players as well and negotiate a wider range of issues on their behalf.
the n.c.a.a.’s  often-stated contention that it is protecting the players from “excessive  commercialism” is ludicrous; the only thing it’s protecting is  everyone else’s revenue stream.
“to some extent they have compromised the  integrity of the universities.”
companies like coors and chick-fil-a eagerly toss millions in marketing dollars at college sports.
those who succeed will be those who use that money most  intelligently.
“within two or three weeks of coming to a university, players often find out they are woefully underprepared for college work,” duderstadt says.
it’s called the o’bannon case, after the lead plaintiff, ed o’bannon, a former college basketball star who led u.c.l.a. to a national championship in 1995.
companies like coors and chick-fil-a eagerly toss millions in marketing dollars  at college sports.
indeed, given the  way big-time college sports are going, paying the players may be the only way  to save them.
besides, how much worse could it be than the status quo, in which parents and hangers-on too often angle for a little something to steer their children to this school or that one?
in economic terms, the players’  incentives will be realigned.
the hypocrisy that permeates big-money college sports takes your breath  away.
she has played no role in the  case, and does not stand to profit if o’bannon wins.)
(rascher is also a professor of sport management at the university of  san francisco.)
in his recent book  of essays about college sports, “circling the bases,” he also  called for federal legislation to cap — and lower — coaches’  egregious salaries.
last year, turner broadcasting and cbs signed a 14-year, $10.8 billion deal for the television rights to the n.c.a.a.’s men’s basketball national championship tournament (a k a “march madness”).
at the time i spoke to emmert, high-school athletes were signing binding letters of intent to attend a university — letters that said they would get the $2,000.
a trial is scheduled for  may 2013.
yet, as emmert notes, “we had 5,500 division i men’s basketball players last year, and only 50 went to the n.b.a.”
what an improvement that would be — using booster money to legitimately pay players instead of handing them cash under the table.
the minimum salary is not meant to make anybody rich.
the case has received attention because it’s a legitimate threat — maybe the first one ever — to the n.c.a.a.’s longstanding refusal to compensate its players.
for both coaches and players, sweet-talking will take a back seat to  clear-eyed financial calculations.
a salary caps equalizes the amount every team can pay to recruit players.
that case, he says proudly, “resulted not just in a monetary judgment, but a restructuring of the company’s relationship with minorities.”
those who succeed will be those who use that money most intelligently.
baseball and hockey players have a choice that football and basketball players don’t have: they can go pro as soon as they leave high school, thanks to the existence of minor leagues.
players aren’t stupid.
for both coaches and players, sweet-talking will take a back seat to clear-eyed financial calculations.
the point is, if schools had to pay their workers, they would  find the money.
one obvious rejoinder is that paying players will create haves and have-nots in college sports.
there is another issue: players who were stars in high school inevitably  come to college with big dreams of going pro one day.
but the big-name college  programs already have overwhelming advantages over the smaller division i  schools; paying the players doesn’t really change that fact.
n.c.a.a. rules make no allowance for poverty, yet surely college athletes should be able to go on a date, rent an off-campus apartment, lease a car, have some clothes, visit home and pay for their parents to see them play once in a while.
yet any other college athlete who manages to get his hands on an  extra $2,000 — by taking money from an overenthusiastic booster, say, or  selling some of their team paraphernalia, as a few ohio state football players
the primary purpose of a six-year scholarship is to give athletes whose  playing days have ended a chance to get their degrees — and to really  have time to focus on classes that can prepare them for a future without  football or basketball.
“i  wouldn’t have had any shoulders left if i had played football in  college,” he told me recently.
but i would argue that  the employee status of those who play football and men’s basketball means  that paying them does not violate title ix.
it is meant to ensure that no matter what your status on the  team, you can still live like other students on campus — maybe even a tad  better — even if you come from a disadvantaged background.
indeed, to inquire about the life of college athletes is to hear, invariably, about players who wear the same clothes every day because they don’t own any others.
lifetime health insurance and the college players association
the fact that they are not getting anything  is precisely why everyone else is getting so much.
why would you care  about their behavior?”
(a  portion of those fees would be used to pay the health insurance costs.)
there are almost surely title ix issues surrounding my plan, which would probably have to be settled by the courts.
although the approach may appear radical at first glance, that’s mainly because we’ve been brainwashed into believing that there’s something fundamentally wrong with rewarding college athletes with cold, hard cash.
like most such would-be reformers, however, he didn’t offer a way  to go about it.
the current one-year deals are, believe it or not, renewable at the discretion of coaches, who can effectively cut injured or underperforming “student athletes,” as the n.c.a.a. likes to call them.
but we’re a long way from that point.
they wouldn’t need to take money because they would be paid for their work.
if the time comes when women’s basketball is as  commercialized and profit-driven as men’s basketball, then yes, the women  should be paid as well.
if you were starting from scratch, you would never devise a system that  relies on universities to serve as a feeder system for pro sports.
indeed, to inquire about the life of college athletes is to hear, invariably,  about players who wear the same clothes every day because they don’t own  any others.
at the university of texas, mack brown, the football coach, can earn up to $6 million with bonuses.
“that would be just as true if they were being paid.
actual coaching — x’s  and o’s — would become more important.
“economically, a big chunk of that money really does belong to the players,” schwarz says.
as james duderstadt, the former president of the  university of michigan, told me: “most sports can be justified as part of  what a university does.
when i saw emmert in november, shortly after the new rule went into effect, i  told him that the stipend struck me as a form of payment to the players.
this organization  — let’s call it the college players association — would  manage the health insurance, negotiate with the n.c.a.a. to set the salary caps  and salary minimums, distribute royalties and serve as an all-around  counterweight to the n.c.a.a.
the number of recruiting violations would quite likely shrink to a negligible figure, as would most of the scandals that involve players taking money.
but they would learn, just as the pros have had to learn, how to bring a financial perspective to evaluating talent.
andrew zimbalist, the noted sports economist at smith college — and a critic of many n.c.a.a. practices — told me he agrees with the contention that schools can’t afford to pay players.
this image and one other thing: with emmert’s backing, the n.c.a.a.’s  board of directors, composed of college and university presidents (emmert  himself is a former president of the university of washington), agreed to make  it permissible for division i schools to pay their athletes a $2,000 stipend.
it’s a system that enables misconduct to flourish.
the historian taylor branch, who in october published alengthy  excoriation of the n.c.a.a. in the atlantic, comparing it to “the  plantation,” was only the most recent voice to call for players to be  paid.
(that’s why most  professional sports leagues embrace players’ unions.)
the college players association, which would administer the health-insurance plan, would also represent the players whenever salary caps or minimum salaries are being set, as well as on those occasions when the n.c.a.a. or a college conference is cutting a deal with a television network or a marketing firm.
within a month, more than 125 of them had signed an “override request.”
that is true — the alabamas and florida  states would have a much easier time coming up with $3.65 million for their  football and basketball players than youngstown state.
for legal reasons, those athletes who  were already promised the $2,000 will most likely still get it.
that case, he says proudly,  “resulted not just in a monetary judgment, but a restructuring of the  company’s relationship with minorities.”
it is the unspoken scandal that permeates college sports, and it is corrosive not just for the athletes but also for the entire student body.
the case they make for using the free market to recruit players
so there is at least a possibility that a judge will conclude that the n.c.a.a.’s refusal to pay its players has less to do with protecting the sanctity of amateur athletics than with its needs as a cartel to illegally suppress wages.
if  hausfeld wins the case, that may be where we are headed anyway.
players would receive a percentage of the revenues — i am thinking 10 percent at first, though that, too, would quite likely rise — to be disbursed after they leave school, giving them a small share of the revenue their team generated while they were there.
college sports will become more honest once players are paid, and more  honorable.
mark emmert, the president of the national collegiate athletic association , the almighty overseer of american college sports, likes to think of himself as a reformer.
“i wouldn’t have had any shoulders left if i had played football in college,” he told me recently.
in most cases, they also can’t afford to quit football and concentrate on their studies, because that would cost them their athletic scholarships.
the extra two years would place the onus  on the athlete to get an education, while also giving him the opportunity.
(competitive balance is another reason the n.c.a.a. gives for not paying players.)
the n.c.a.a.’s often-stated contention that it is protecting the players from “excessive commercialism” is ludicrous; the only thing it’s protecting is everyone else’s revenue stream.
and it would make it possible for those players who do graduate within four years to pursue a graduate degree.
but i think it’s better to acknowledge forthrightly that those who play football and men’s basketball are different from other college athletes — and that the players in those two revenue sports should be treated accordingly.
the first is a  modified free-market approach to recruiting college players.
anticipating the day when a judge might ask him what sort of remedy he  would propose for the plaintiffs, hausfeld has put forward the idea of an  organization that would negotiate licensing agreements on behalf of former  players and then act to collect and distribute the money they are due.
the hypocrisy that permeates big-money college sports takes your breath away.
to those who question why i am willing to pay these two categories of male athletes, but not any female athletes, my simple answer is that football and men’s basketball players occupy a different role on campus — the role of an employee as well as a student — that female (and most other male) athletes do not.
they will be better, too.
the denial of that central fact is the primary reason those sports are so troubled today.
in europe, where soccer is king, children with professional potential are culled from the educational system in their early teens and often receive separate schooling from their soccer teams.
that illusion was shattered long ago, surely.
ultimately,  i suspect that if schools had to start paying their players, we would wind up  with maybe 72 football schools (six conferences of 12 teams each) — down  from the current 120 football bowl subdivision programs — and 100 or so  major basketball schools instead of the 338 that now play in division i. seems  about right, doesn’t it?
that is what the minimum salary will provide.
even those who officially “graduate” often do so without getting a real education.
they know  they are making money for the athletic department.
another consequence of this economic discrepancy between the players and everyone else, though, is the increasingly loud calls for reform.
any student athlete who accepts an unapproved, free hamburger from a coach, or even a fan, is in violation of n.c.a.a. rules.

it is also possible that the case could be decided or settled narrowly — allowing former players to be compensated for the use of their images but leaving the status of current players unchanged.
every player who stays  in school for four years would also get an additional two-year scholarship,  which he could use either to complete his bachelor’s or get a  master’s degree.
providing lifetime health insurance as a benefit for anyone who plays at least two years of college ball is a no-brainer.
in the world schwarz and rascher  envision, athletes would hire advisers to help them.
powerful conferences like  the s.e.c. and the pac 12 have signed lucrative tv deals, while the big 10 and  the university of texas have created theirown sports networks.
instead, the best approach is to openly acknowledge their  commercialization — and pay the work force.
fans will be able to enjoy football and men’s basketball without having to avert their eyes from the scandals and the hypocrisy.
the salary caps i have in mind are pretty low, all things considered: $3 million for the salaries for the football team, and $650,000 for basketball, with a minimum salary of $25,000 per athlete.
the fact that they are not getting anything is precisely why everyone else is getting so much.

those who don’t wind  up playing professionally are then ruthlessly tossed aside.
thus, each football team would spend  $1.5 million on the minimum salaries, and have the rest to attract star  players.

“they shouldn’t ask the football team to subsidize it.”
but i would argue that the employee status of those who play football and men’s basketball means that paying them does not violate title ix.
one school might think a star  halfback is worth $40,000 a year; another might think he’s worth $60,000.
no, he insisted, the extra $2,000 was an effort to  increase the value of the scholarships, which some studies estimate falls on  average about $3,500 short of the full cost of attending college annually.

basketball teams would use $325,000 on minimum salaries, and have  another $325,000 to allocate as they wish among players.
as for the objection that colleges with major sports programs don’t have  the money to pay $2,000 stipends, much less free-market salaries, schwarz and  rascher just roll their eyes.

instead of  sweet-talking recruits, college coaches will instead offer athletes real  contracts, just as professional teams do.
there are five elements to my plan.
(the n.c.a.a. itself takes in nearly $800  million a year, mostly from its march madness tv contracts.)
second, the salary cap recognizes that university athletic departments  don’t have unlimited sums of money to throw at football and basketball  players.
behold the logic of the n.c.a.a. at work.
the revelation that a university of miami booster — now in prison, convicted of running aponzi scheme — provided dozens of miami football players with money, cars and even prostitutes.

“within two or  three weeks of coming to a university, players often find out they are woefully  underprepared for college work,” duderstadt says.
but both  hausfeld and the n.c.a.a. have been acting as if the stakes are higher than  that.
the n.c.a.a. can  piously define them as students first, but the players know better.
“the huge tv contracts and excessive commercialization have corrupted  intercollegiate athletics,” says brit kirwan, the chancellor at the  university of maryland system.
the financial scandal at the  fiesta bowl that led to the firing of its chief executive and the indictment of  another top executive.
there is another issue: players who were stars in high school inevitably come to college with big dreams of going pro one day.
dean robinson a version of this article appeared in print on january 1, 2012, on page mm 30 of the sunday magazine with the headline: here’s how to pay up now.
“if we move toward a pay-for-play model — if we were to convert our student athletes to employees of the university — that would be the death of college athletics,” emmert retorted.
the n.c.a.a. would no longer need to obsess over an athlete’s academic performance; as long as he met the same standard the school applied to every other student, he could stay in school and play on the team.
then i met  two bay area economists, andy schwarz and dan rascher, who work as litigation  consultants and have a longstanding interest in the economics of college  sports.
ultimately, i suspect that if schools had to start paying their players, we would wind up with maybe 72 football schools (six conferences of 12 teams each) — down from the current 120 football bowl subdivision programs — and 100 or so major basketball schools instead of the 338 that now play in division i. seems about right, doesn’t it?
students get paid all the time.”
college football and men’s basketball have become such huge  commercial enterprises that together they generate more than $6 billion in  annual revenue, more than the national basketball association.
paying the players will cause the vast majority of the scandals to go away.
if the time comes when women’s basketball is as commercialized and profit-driven as men’s basketball, then yes, the women should be paid as well.
legitimizing relations  between agents and college athletes would be another huge improvement, because  players could get good advice about their professional prospects.
it is worth noting that, even now, 40 years after title ix became the law of the land, many schools still spend far more money on men’s than women’s sports without running afoul of it.
isn’t that how it should work anyway?
yes, it’s true: paying players will change college sports.
in both cases, critics feared that the  introduction of serious and legitimate money would damage the sports, turn off  the fans and lead to chaos.
they see 100,000 people in the stands on a saturday afternoon.
second, the salary cap recognizes that university athletic departments don’t have unlimited sums of money to throw at football and basketball players.
a few months ago, after he’d been on the job for a little  more than a year, he pushed through a series of improvements, including  slightly higher academic standards for college athletes, a full-scale review of  the n.c.a.a.’s fat rule book and a new provision giving universities the  option of offering four-year scholarships.
(a portion of those fees would be used to pay the health insurance costs.)
and the fifth: an organization would be created to represent both current and former college athletes.
college sports will become more honest once players are paid, and more honorable.
“if having a good lacrosse team is part of what  the community values, then the university should pay for it,” schwarz  says.
(the n.c.a.a. itself takes in nearly $800 million a year, mostly from its march madness tv contracts.)
joe nocera is an op-ed columnist for the times and the co-author of  “all the devils are here: the hidden history of the financial  crisis.”
actual coaching — x’s and o’s — would become more important.
since the summer of 2009, he has  been representing former division i college football and basketball players in  a class-action antitrust lawsuit against the n.c.a.a. for licensing their  images without compensating them.
the new breed of reformers, whose perspective i share, believes that the only way the major sports schools can achieve any integrity is to end the hypocrisy and recognize that college football and men’s basketball are big businesses.
at the university of texas,  mack brown, the football coach, can earn up to $6 million with bonuses.
bidding for players
it is possible, certainly, that the n.c.a.a. could win  the o’bannon case.
for his part, hausfeld has embraced  this litigation as a cause akin to a lawsuit he once filed against texaco for  discriminating against minority employees.
that is true — the alabamas and florida states would have a much easier time coming up with $3.65 million for their football and basketball players than youngstown state.
as for the salary cap, it is an acknowledgment of two things.
what about the argument that football and basketball profits subsidize the  other athletic programs?
players would receive a percentage of the revenues — i am  thinking 10 percent at first, though that, too, would quite likely rise —  to be disbursed after they leave school, giving them a small share of the  revenue their team generated while they were there.
thus, each football team would spend $1.5 million on the minimum salaries, and have the rest to attract star players.
also in the female factor» religious intolerance seems to be part of the message sent to student-athletes in texas.
that’s the third element.
although  the approach may appear radical at first glance, that’s mainly because  we’ve been brainwashed into believing that there’s something  fundamentally wrong with rewarding college athletes with cold, hard cash.
first,  without a cap of some sort, the wealthiest athletic departments, like  texas’s, with its own sports network, and oklahoma state’s, which  has boone pickens’s fortune behind it, could well dominate the recruiting  of top players.
hausfeld insists that athletes have rights: “they have rights to a fair allocation of revenue, to health care, to career development, to education and to posteducational opportunities.”
“what draws us to college athletics is  that we love seeing students representing our schools,” schwarz says.
hausfeld insists that athletes have rights: “they have rights to a  fair allocation of revenue, to health care, to career development, to education  and to posteducational opportunities.”
not the kind of reform that emmert talks about — change that nibbles around the edges, while trying to maintain the illusion that college football and men’s basketball players are merely partaking in an extracurricular activity like theater or the chess club.
the fourth: each player would have lifetime health insurance.
as for the objection that colleges with major sports programs don’t have the money to pay $2,000 stipends, much less free-market salaries, schwarz and rascher just roll their eyes.
they look around and see  jerseys with their names on them being sold in the bookstores.
first, without a cap of some sort, the wealthiest athletic departments, like texas’s, with its own sports network, and oklahoma state’s, which has boone pickens’s fortune behind it, could well dominate the recruiting of top players.
indeed, given the way big-time college sports are going, paying the players may be the only way to save them.
a few months ago, after he’d been on the job for a little more than a year, he pushed through a series of improvements, including slightly higher academic standards for college athletes, a full-scale review of the n.c.a.a.’s fat rule book and a new provision giving universities the option of offering four-year scholarships.
and sports like wrestling and rowing don’t offer the possibility of a pro career — wrestlers and rowers are true amateurs.
teams need right tackles and backup point guards too.
it is not what universities were intended to do, and no other country in the world does it that way.
not the kind  of reform that emmert talks about — change that nibbles around the edges,  while trying to maintain the illusion that college football and men’s  basketball players are merely partaking in an extracurricular activity like  theater or the chess club.
they will be  better, too.
the n.c.a.a. likes to conflate paying college athletes with the issue of whether they would still be students.
“the dominant attitude among players is that there is no moral or ethical reason not to take money, because the system is ripping them off.”
it is not  what universities were intended to do, and no other country in the world does  it that way.
and sports like wrestling and  rowing don’t offer the possibility of a pro career — wrestlers and  rowers are true amateurs.
those who don’t wind up playing professionally are then ruthlessly tossed aside.
for his part, hausfeld has embraced this litigation as a cause akin to a lawsuit he once filed against texaco for discriminating against minority employees.
but schwarz and rascher argue amateurism has nothing to do  with why fans love college sports.
it is the  unspoken scandal that permeates college sports, and it is corrosive not just  for the athletes but also for the entire student body.
he visibly stiffened.
why would you care about their behavior?”
they realize that having universities in charge of a major form of american entertainment is far from ideal, but they are also realistic enough to know that scaling back big-time college sports is implausible, given the money at stake.
there is another possible benefit.
any student athlete who accepts an  unapproved, free hamburger from a coach, or even a fan, is in violation of  n.c.a.a. rules.
the n.c.a.a. can piously define them as students first, but the players know better.
but over the next month, college athletic directors and  conference commissioners began protesting the new stipend, claiming they  couldn’t afford it.
but big-time football and men’s basketball are  clearly commercial entertainment and have been pulled away from the fundamental  purpose of a university.”
one of the n.c.a.a.’s primary arguments against paying players is that the concept of amateurism is what defines college sports and make it special — and that to abandon that amateurism would ruin the college “brand.”
it is possible, certainly, that the n.c.a.a. could win the o’bannon case.
college athletes are routinely tossed aside, too — after they have  used up their athletic eligibility.
so there is at least a  possibility that a judge will conclude that the n.c.a.a.’s refusal to pay  its players has less to do with protecting the sanctity of amateur athletics  than with its needs as a cartel to illegally suppress wages.
it would simply mean trimming excess elsewhere.
the n.c.a.a. would  no longer need to obsess over an athlete’s academic performance; as long  as he met the same standard the school applied to every other student, he could  stay in school and play on the team.
when the player chooses a school, money will inevitably be part of the equation.
fans will be able to enjoy football and men’s basketball  without having to avert their eyes from the scandals and the hypocrisy.
the organization would handle licensing deals on behalf of players whose jerseys are being sold, too, and collect fees whenever the n.c.a.a. markets the images of former players.
as james duderstadt, the former president of the university of michigan, told me: “most sports can be justified as part of what a university does.
the historian taylor branch, who in october published alengthy excoriation of the n.c.a.a. in the atlantic, comparing it to “the plantation,” was only the most recent voice to call for players to be paid.
but the big-name college programs already have overwhelming advantages over the smaller division i schools; paying the players doesn’t really change that fact.
it would allow players to take fewer courses during  their years of athletic eligibility, giving them a better chance to succeed at  the courses they do take.
“it’s already an arms race,” schwarz says.
what an improvement that would be — using  booster money to legitimately pay players instead of handing them cash under  the table.
one obvious rejoinder is that paying players will create haves and  have-nots in college sports.
the second element is a salary cap for every team, along with a minimum  annual salary for every scholarship athlete.
this is, by now, a moral imperative.
when i saw emmert in november, shortly after the new rule went into effect, i told him that the stipend struck me as a form of payment to the players.
the primary purpose of a six-year scholarship is to give athletes whose playing days have ended a chance to get their degrees — and to really have time to focus on classes that can prepare them for a future without football or basketball.
but if the players were paid, the market would probably  readjust coaches’ salaries all by itself.
the assault on the constitution by politicians damages our nation.
it is worth noting that, even now,  40 years after title ix became the law of the land, many schools still spend  far more money on men’s than women’s sports without running afoul  of it.
why would you even want them to be students?
and one other thing: with emmert’s backing, the n.c.a.a.’s board of directors, composed of college and university presidents (emmert himself is a former president of the university of washington), agreed to make it permissible for division i schools to pay their athletes a $2,000 stipend.
yet any other college athlete who manages to get his hands on an extra $2,000 — by taking money from an overenthusiastic booster, say, or selling some of their team paraphernalia, as a few ohio state football players did — will be violating the n.c.a.a.’s rules regarding amateurism and will probably face a multigame suspension.
if you were starting from scratch, you would never devise a system that relies on universities to serve as a feeder system for pro sports.
legitimizing relations between agents and college athletes would be another huge improvement, because players could get good advice about their professional prospects.
the workers are supposed to be content with a scholarship that does not even cover the full cost of attending college.
i borrowed the idea of a college players’ association from michael  d. hausfeld, a plaintiffs’ lawyer who likes to take on high-profile cases  with an element of social justice to them.
“very quickly  they give up and major in eligibility.
for all the  stereotypes of college jocks living large, the reality is often quite harsh.
(full disclosure: william isaacson, a lawyer with boies, schiller & flexner, is among more than a dozen attorneys from various firms who have assisted hausfeld in bringing the o’bannon lawsuit.
for all the stereotypes of college jocks living large, the reality is often quite harsh.
“very quickly they give up and major in eligibility.
but over the next month, college athletic directors and conference commissioners began protesting the new stipend, claiming they couldn’t afford it.
but schwarz and rascher argue amateurism has nothing to do with why fans love college sports.
a top college coach can make as much or more than a professional coach; ohio state just agreed to pay urban meyer $24 million over six years.
but both hausfeld and the n.c.a.a. have been acting as if the stakes are higher than that.
(competitive balance is another reason the n.c.a.a. gives for  not paying players.)
powerful conferences like the s.e.c. and the pac 12 have signed lucrative tv deals, while the big 10 and the university of texas have created theirown sports networks.
what it will  most likely do is force smaller schools to rethink their commitment to big-time  athletics.
texas  could pay its entire salary cap merely by hiring a $3 million coach instead of  a $6 million one.
it’s called the o’bannon case,  after the lead plaintiff, ed o’bannon, a former college basketball star  who led u.c.l.a. to a national championship in 1995.
a salary caps equalizes the amount every team can pay to  recruit players.
it is meant to ensure that no matter what your status on the team, you can still live like other students on campus — maybe even a tad better — even if you come from a disadvantaged background.
“athletes in football and basketball feel unfairly treated,” leigh steinberg, a prominent sports agent, says.
the financial scandal at the fiesta bowl that led to the firing of its chief executive and the indictment of another top executive.
one of the n.c.a.a.’s primary arguments against paying players is  that the concept of amateurism is what defines college sports and make it  special — and that to abandon that amateurism would ruin the college  “brand.”
but if the players were paid, the market would probably readjust coaches’ salaries all by itself.
they take the cupcake courses.
my fiancée is  the firm’s director of communications.
but i think it’s better to acknowledge forthrightly that those who play  football and men’s basketball are different from other college athletes  — and that the players in those two revenue sports should be treated  accordingly.
instead, the best approach is to openly acknowledge their commercialization — and pay the work force.
(rascher is also a professor of sport management at the university of san francisco.)
this clearinghouse role would resemble the system by which songwriters receive royalties from b.m.i. or ascap whenever their songs are played on the radio or on television.
if hausfeld wins the case, that may be where we are headed anyway.
this organization — let’s call it the college players association — would manage the health insurance, negotiate with the n.c.a.a. to set the salary caps and salary minimums, distribute royalties and serve as an all-around counterweight to the n.c.a.a. there have been other pay-the-player schemes put forward recently, in particular asports illustrated proposal that would pay every athlete on campus a small stipend, including lacrosse players, golfers and volleyball players.
“the huge tv contracts and excessive commercialization have corrupted intercollegiate athletics,” says brit kirwan, the chancellor at the university of maryland system.
taylor branch, the  author of the atlantic essay, was a good football player in high school, but he  turned down a football scholarship to georgia tech because he knew his body was  already breaking down just from playing high-school football.
one school might think a star halfback is worth $40,000 a year; another might think he’s worth $60,000.
the abuse scandals that have swirled around penn state football and syracuse basketball.
yes,  it’s true: paying players will change college sports.
over the last few  months, in consultation with sports economists, antitrust lawyers and  reformers, i put together the outlines of what i believe to be a realistic plan  to pay those who play football and men’s basketball in college.
when the player chooses a school, money will inevitably be part of the  equation.
(the n.c.a.a. plans to review the issue on jan. 14.)
college football and men’s basketball have become such huge commercial enterprises that together they generate more than $6 billion in annual revenue, more than the national basketball association.
and what does the labor force that makes it possible for  coaches to earn millions, and causes marketers to spend billions, get?
this  clearinghouse role would resemble the system by which songwriters receive  royalties from b.m.i. or ascap whenever their songs are played on the radio or  on television.
would coaches sometimes overpay players who turn out to be duds?
first, it has bred a deep cynicism among the  athletes themselves.
