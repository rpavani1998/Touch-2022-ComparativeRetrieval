scholastic/collegiate associations place these restrictions on soccer not to keep the games in the "proper educational perspective" but rather to prevent soccer from receiving equivalent exposure to that of the 'revenue' or 'traditional' sports of football/basketball/baseball.the result is that high school teams in small towns in rural areas are severely limited in their ability to compete with schools from the large urban and suburban areas since those players simply cannot form club teams without running afoul of the six player rule.while baseball tries to accommodate soccer's schedule in the fall and soccer tries to accommodate baseball's in the spring, conflicts inevitably arise that prevent kids from playing both sports at the same time.the ncaa has actually used title ix to decrease the number of men's college soccer programs available, while the ussf, which is not legally bound by title ix has greatly expanded the opportunities for women and girls to play soccer without decreasing opportunitie s for men and boys.the "development" of my middle school soccer player has included increased stamina, increased soccer skills, better sportsmanship in both winning and losing, development of self control in the face of unfair referee calls.as the prestige of travel teams run by parents and not educators grows, scholastic sports become trivial with the best athletes opting out of the school program.any child psychologist will tell you that specializing in a sport in middle school/high school is not good for the physical or emotional development of the child.sports were under the umbrella and protection of the educational system.club teams - the non-scolastic teams - now have parents funding coaches and travel.verbally abusive coaches, in any sport, won't last long where the parents are involved.my experience with soccer has been that the schools wouldn't pick it up as a sport, so a local recreational league was developed by parents for their children who love soccer.there's greater attendance at the football games, because they are school sponsered and have a decent place to play.parents don't have a thought about their children's development, just scholarships and winning games.soccer is a superior activity to american football and anyone who can't understand why is proof of why.high school soccer teams suffer as well.
