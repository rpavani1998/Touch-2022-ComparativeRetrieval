if architecture is, as is sometimes said, music set in concrete, then football and basketball may be said to be creativity embodied in team sports.
the action of a basketball game and of a football match are easier to follow than that of other team sports as well because the ball is larger than in cricket and baseball and is never hidden in a tangle of bodies or a scrum, as it is in american football and rugby.
