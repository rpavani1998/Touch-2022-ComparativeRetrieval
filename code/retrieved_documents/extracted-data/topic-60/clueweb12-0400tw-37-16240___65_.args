it is extremely important for players to drink enough fluids because dehydration can seriously reduce athletic performance and increase the risk of heat illnesses.this finding is considered significant as such injuries may potentially affect high school and college players also.[37] heart disease while retired nfl players have a lower overall rate of death compared to men in the general u.s. population, players at certain positions have a higher incidence ofheart disease.it is increasingly rare, for example, for nfl quarterbacks or running backs (who take the most direct hits) to make it through an entire season without missing some time to injury.[citation needed ] additionally, 28 football players died from direct football injuries in the years 2000–05 and an additional 68 died indirectly from dehydration or other examples of "non-physical" dangers, according to the national center for catastrophic sport injury research.[33] concussions are common, with about 41,000 suffered every year among high school playersthese protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lastinginjury to players.it is increasingly rare, for example, for nfl quarterbacks or running backs (who take the most direct hits) to make it through an entire season without missing some time to injury.[citation needed ] additionally, 28 football players died from direct football injuries in the years 2000–05 and an additional 68 died indirectly from dehydration or other examples of "non-physical" dangers, according to the national center for catastrophic sport injury research.[33]because of the amount of physical wear the game can inflict on the human body, american football seasons are typically far shorter than the comparable seasons of other popular american sports.an unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game.defensive linemen were 42% more likely to die from heart disease than men in the general population.the increased incidence of heart disease may be attributed to highbmi measurements: retired players—notably offensive and defensive linemen—with a playing-time bmi of 30 or more had double the risk of dying from heart disease as compared to other players.the danger of football, and the equipment required to reduce it, make regulation football impractical for casual play.these teams mostly play other similarly sized schools, through the ncaa's divisional system, which divides the schools into four divisions:division i bowl subdivision, division i championship subdivision, division ii, and division iii.to compensate for this, players must wear special protective equipment, such as a padded plastichelmet, shoulder pads, hip pads and knee pads.however, there is some research, reported in 2009, which, using phone interviews based on thenational health interview survey, showed increased incidence of diagnosis ofmemory loss and dementia among retired professional football players; chronic traumatic encephalopathy diagnoses are increasingly common among deceased football players.as such, the sport is played in a wide range of weather conditions, from the heat and humidity of late summer, to the cold winds and snow in mid-winter.as such, defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball-carrier to the ground, within certain rules and guidelines.
