he has had two top recruiting classes in the sun belt and the players all seem to have really bought into his message.arguably one of the hottest teams in the country, one of the best running backs and they finished second in their conference, yet no bid.iu gave coach tom crean time to build the program after it was decimated by kelvin sampson and it looks like they have finally turned the corner.taggart is also the highest paid employee at the university, which now makes football king at western.he came in to a tough situation and in two short years seems to have turned the program around.so without further adieu... -i think the fact that wku didn't get invited to a bowl game is a real shame.a rough start the wku men's basketball team has looked good in their last two wins.no reason to think he can't lead the hilltoppers to a number of conference championships.oh, and the third and fourth place finishers in their league did.no reason to think they won't be 6-6 going into the game against louisville.-chane behanan vs. george fant should be a very good match-up to watch, although right now it looks like behanan is the better player.-i think the wildcats will get a tougher game out of indiana on saturdayÂ than most people think.-i think the wildcats will get a tougher game out of indiana on saturday than most people think.- not many thoughts on hs basketball, mainly because i haven't seen a lot of it yet.that being said, i'll still take uk by 8-10.
