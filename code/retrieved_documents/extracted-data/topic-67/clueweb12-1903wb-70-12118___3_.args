just like we do with all of our standardized tests, if you take the toefl multiple times and submit all your scores we will take the highest sub-score for each section, even if they are obtained during different exams.however, i just found out today from a friend that toefl is required even for applicants who are attending secondary school in english-speaking countries but have only been there for less than five years.however, we are stressing the fact that these are the scores that one should obtain to be considered competitive in the admissions process.as our web site ( http://apply.jhu.edu/faqs/international.html) states, during the early stages of the internet-based toefl we will be flexible with scores, especially from the speaking section.recently, i’ve got my toefl results and unfortunately my listening and speaking sections appear to lack a few scores from the minimum requirements stated in the admission website (http://www.jhu.edu/admis/apply/testreqs.html).in addition, we state that a student should have the stated scores, and that we prefer the following minimum sub-scores: 26 in reading 26 in listening 25 in speaking 22 in writing by using the words "should" and "prefer" we are avoiding stating specific requirements.every other student is required to take the examination even if they hold a us passport.in addition, we state that a student should have the stated scores, and that we prefer the following minimum sub-scores: 26 in reading 25 in speaking 22 in writing by using the words "should" and "prefer" we are avoiding stating specific requirements.as our web site ( http://apply.jhu.edu/faqs/international.html) states, a student should have the following minimum sub-scores: 26 in reading 26 in listening 25 in speaking 22 in writing these are not specific requirementsdo note though that self-reported scores on your application are not considered official, and you are required to have the college board submit all your toefl scores to johns hopkins university directly.students are not automatically denied if they do not obtain these levels.quote from: "admissions_daniel" as our web site ( http://apply.jhu.edu/faqs/international.html) states, during the early stages of the internet-based toefl we will be flexible with scores, especially from the speaking section.toefl scores do not replace sat critical reading or writing scores.it’s quite expensive for me to retake the test, but if these scores are not sufficient for me to stand a chance for admission, i’m more than willing to retake my test… please advise!!!that is true, for the 2010-2011 application cycle the office of undergraduate admissions for johns hopkins university still does not accept ielts exam scores.
