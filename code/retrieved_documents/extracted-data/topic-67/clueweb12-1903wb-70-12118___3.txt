or you would view the total score of each time?
recently, i’ve got my toefl results and unfortunately my listening and speaking sections appear to lack a few scores from the minimum requirements stated in the admission website (http://www.jhu.edu/admis/apply/testreqs.html).
however, we are  stressing the fact that these are the scores that one should obtain to be  considered competitive in the admissions process.
the decision as to whether or not to take the toefl again is one you will need to make on your own.

if you attend an english-language school but do not speak english at home, you should take the toefl.
quote from: "blackstones91" i am wondering if it will be safer to send my original toefl score from october now and send toefl score from january later.
hope to get some pointers on my toefl ibt scores.

quote from: "sorasong" since im 3 point short on the speaking section i am concerned if the ibt toefl system is still considered new and flexible.
although it is 2 scores short for both sections, still it does not meet the stated requirements.
and i have a question about the toefl score.
i am wondering if it will be safer to send my original toefl score  from october now and send toefl score from january later.

i have total toefl score 102, but i lack one point from each listening and speaking section.
i have rest of the scores higher than requirement with total of 101.

you are required to request from the college board/ets that your october toefl scores are sent directly to johns hopkins prior to the jan. 1 application deadline.
i have already talked to one of admission officer on the phone and she said it is okay to take toefl on january and send score.
i read the questions and answers in this forum.
if i hold a us passport, but do not speak english at home and am not completely fluent in english, would the toefl be one of the components used during the admissions process?
i tried looking up by typing in the school name, but i didn't see anything that says johns hopkins university undergraduate.

i’m from malaysia and interested to apply for ed for fall term 2008.
just like we do with all of our standardized tests, if you take the toefl multiple times and submit all your scores we will take the highest sub-score for each section, even if they are obtained during different exams.
« reply #1 on: december 09, 2006, 10:15 am » not at this point, no.
it’s quite expensive for me to retake the test, but if these scores are not sufficient for me to stand a chance for admission, i’m more than willing to retake my test… please advise!!!
i used to live in india and my first language is english.
by using the words "should" and "prefer" we are avoiding stating specific requirements.
in addition, we state that a student should have the stated scores, and that we prefer the following minimum sub-scores: 26 in reading 26 in listening 25 in speaking 22 in writing by using the words "should" and "prefer" we are avoiding stating specific requirements.

there is no guarantee that your january scores will arrive in time, but if they do then they will be factored in.
however, based on our suggested scores, if you want your application to be strongly considered for admission you should consider trying to raise your toefl scores to meet or minimum sub-scores.
quote from:  "admissions_daniel" as our web site ( http://apply.jhu.edu/faqs/international.html)  states, during the early stages of the internet-based toefl we will be flexible  with scores, especially from the speaking section.
that is true, for the 2010-2011 application cycle the office of undergraduate admissions for johns hopkins university still does not accept ielts exam scores.
but it is highly advisable a student obtains these scores or higher on each sub-section.

sat scores and toefl scores are separate admissions factors and are looked at differently by the admissions committee.
and i am not sure if i take the toefl and pass the minimum scores, then would my toefl scores replace my sat cr and wr scores?
however, it is not the native language of india.
i immigrated to canada in 2005 and i will be graduating from my high school in 2009.

students are not automatically denied if they do not obtain these levels.
however, i just found out today from a friend that toefl is required even for applicants who are attending secondary school in english-speaking countries but have only been there for less than five years.

you will then need to request that your january toefl scores also be sent.
do note though that self-reported scores on your application are not considered official, and you are required to have the college board submit all your toefl scores to johns hopkins university directly.
students are  not automatically denied if they do not obtain these levels.
i am wondering if it will be safer to send my original toefl score from october now and send toefl score from january later.

applicants whose first language is not english need to show english proficiency with their application and the way to do that is by one of the following three things: - toefl score - attended an english-language school for the last five consecutive years - a score of 670 or higher on the critical reading section of the sat sorasong - newbie - - posts: 1 - joined: dec 20, 2010 - member: #1973 questions about toefl (ielts)?

xtine, yes - you not are required to take the toefl examination
the admissions committee will review your toefl scores as we review toefl scores, as a test of english proficiency, and the committee will review your sat scores as we review standardized exam scores that all applicants must submit.

if your native language is not english and you attend an english-language secondary school., you must take the toefl if you have been at that school for fewer than five years.
