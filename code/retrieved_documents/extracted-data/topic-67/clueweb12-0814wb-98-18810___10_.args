toefl may tend to favour more abstract learners as many of the questions are multiple choice whereas ielts may be more suited to concrete learners as it involves memory recall.i think a student having better toefl score is much more qualified than having better ielts scores.if you are good at memorising things and repeating them, ielts will be better, and toefl is better for people who are more abstract learners.if you are applying to university in an english speaking country and english is not your first language, you may need to meet certain language requirements dictated by the institution.while the differences are not as great as some assume, accents and spelling variations can cause a problem for some students.the face to face speaking section of the ielts may be daunting to some candidates who would be more comfortable speaking into a microphoneyour experiences can help fellow learners.that isn’t necessarily correct; the language tests accepted will vary from institution to institution – you should contact the institutions you are interested in to ask about their english language requirements and what tests they will accept as proof of your ability.many more students who make better score in ielts fail to make 80 in toefl ibt.the question of which is easier is largely irrelevant as both tests will grade you accurately according to your level of english.either way, you should do everything you can to improve your english before taking the test – read english websites and watch tv and movies that are in english.you could also fill out an enquiry form at i-studentenquiry- our free matching service that can help match you with institutions according to your preferences.i want to take ielts test but i do not have any money to cover all my recuirements such as passport,test ielts,letter of medichal checkup.toefl gives a more numerical sat-type grade, totalling your scores from all the areas.this is in my opinion one advantage the ielts has over the toefl.
