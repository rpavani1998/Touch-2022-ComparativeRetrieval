recently, i’ve got my toefl results and unfortunately my listening and speaking sections appear to lack a few scores from the minimum requirements stated in the admission website (http://www.jhu.edu/admis/apply/testreqs.html).
however, we are stressing the fact that these are the scores that one should obtain to be considered competitive in the admissions process.
quote from: "blackstones91" i am wondering if it will be safer to send my original toefl score from october now and send toefl score from january later.
quote from: "sorasong" since im 3 point short on the speaking section i am concerned if the ibt toefl system is still considered new and flexible.
although it is 2 scores short for both sections, still it does not meet the stated requirements.
i have total toefl score 102, but i lack one point from each listening and speaking section.
i have rest of the scores higher than requirement with total of 101.
i have already talked to one of admission officer on the phone and she said it is okay to take toefl on january and send score.
i tried looking up by typing in the school name, but i didn't see anything that says johns hopkins university undergraduate.
i’m from malaysia and interested to apply for ed for fall term 2008.
just like we do with all of our standardized tests, if you take the toefl multiple times and submit all your scores we will take the highest sub-score for each section, even if they are obtained during different exams.
it’s quite expensive for me to retake the test, but if these scores are not sufficient for me to stand a chance for admission, i’m more than willing to retake my test… please advise!!!
i used to live in india and my first language is english.
in addition, we state that a student should have the stated scores, and that we prefer the following minimum sub-scores: 26 in reading 26 in listening 25 in speaking 22 in writing by using the words "should" and "prefer" we are avoiding stating specific requirements.
quote from: "admissions_daniel" as our web site ( http://apply.jhu.edu/faqs/international.html) states, during the early stages of the internet-based toefl we will be flexible with scores, especially from the speaking section.
that is true, for the 2010-2011 application cycle the office of undergraduate admissions for johns hopkins university still does not accept ielts exam scores.
however, we are stressing the fact that these are the scores that one should obtain to be considered competitive in the admissions process.
however, it is not the native language of india.
students are not automatically denied if they do not obtain these levels.
however, i just found out today from a friend that toefl is required even for applicants who are attending secondary school in english-speaking countries but have only been there for less than five years.
quote from: "ryanghee0223" i took the sat and my cr and wr scores are not good for jhu, and i am going to take toefl to make up my cr and wr scores.
the scores can arrive after the deadline but they must be requested prior to it.

i scored only 24 for listening and 23 for speaking, which are each 2 marks short from the required scores for admission (i scored 29 for both my reading and writing though).

toefl scores do not replace sat critical reading or writing scores.
all you have to do now is click on the verification link in the email address you registered account with.
as i posted earlier in this discussion forum: i have rest of the scores higher than requirement with total of 101.
i have total toefl score 102, but i lack one point from each listening and speaking section.
you will then need to request that your january toefl scores also be sent.
do note though that self-reported scores on your application are not considered official, and you are required to have the college board submit all your toefl scores to johns hopkins university directly.
students are not automatically denied if they do not obtain these levels.
every other student is required to take the examination even if they hold a us passport.
i took toefl twice and i saw the post that jhu will take best scores from each subsection.
i really want to get into johns hopkins university for undergrad.
i thought that sat reasoning test and the sat subject tests were the only standardized tests required to apply at jhu.
