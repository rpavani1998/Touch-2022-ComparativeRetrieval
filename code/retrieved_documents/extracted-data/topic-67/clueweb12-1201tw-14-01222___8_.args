studying for the gre can be difficult for anyone, but trying to learn thousands of new words with a reading disability can be a daunting task.unfortunately, for those of us with reading disabilities, that is way too time consuming.despite your disability, you too can learn thisvocabulary and take the gre successfully.taking quizzes can also help to reduce the monotony of this horrible task.it helps to use a talking dictionary to verify that you are pronouncing the words correctly.even though learning new words may seem to be an insurmountable task, it is not so bad if you break up the work into segments and do the least amount of reading possible.this will help you to learn the words even when you don’t feel like putting in the tons of effort required to actually physically read these words from paper.if you are lucky enough to have a friend who is also studying for the gre, you might be able to get them to help you with making these recordings.if you’re still unsure of yourself, you can always trywriting your own sentences using the words, making flash cards of antonyms, and utilizing other methods of learningvocabulary.people without a reading disability would probably just read these word lists over and over again until they understood the words sufficiently.now you have a better understanding of most of them, but you couldn’t solidly define them or produce antonyms on demand.even if your classmates might be able to breeze through this section of the gre due to their reading habits, you are not likely to be able to get through this part quickly.so here’s how you’re going to avoid reading these words and definitions multiple times: you will have to make recordings of these words to listen to them later on audio.this will involve you reading the words out loud into a microphone and gradually putting a list of all the words you don’t know into audio format.read all of the words and definitions this part is going to take a lot of time and is unfortunately very difficult.
