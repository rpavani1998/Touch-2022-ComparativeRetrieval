quite separately, the browser itself is now looking dated with most alternative products offering tabbed browsing and other productivity enhancements.
our web stats do show that ie is the overwhelming choice of our readers, though there is a growing trend towards the "firefox" browser.

version 1.0.7 includes security and stability updates, and mozilla recommends everyone upgrade to the newest version.
there are several excellent alternatives but mozilla firefox is the stand-out pick.

firefox is an "open source" program, and therefore gets constant attention and improvements.

if you haven't tried the "firefox" browser from mozilla.org, you're missing out on some great features missing from ie.

download for free, auto-install.
more "add-on's" (extensions, they call them) than you can count, as the open source community continues to come up with new ones nearly every day.
netscape and safari tied for second place, and ie 6, deepnet and opera brought up the rear.
here's the link to download it: http://www.foxcloud.com/wiki/main_page
and, if you're among the many still using internet explorer, ah well, you have my sympathies.
when combined with alt-d above, this works wonders!
it loads a little slower than ie but once running, it zips along at lightning speed.

it installed and runs fine here.
to  launch a new tab
firefox web browser (free) everybody uses internet explorer to surf the 'net, right?
press alt-d, and your insertion point (cursor) will jump to the address bar.
(not to mention better security from all of those hackers going after flaws in ie).
shift-click a link to  launch a new window with the link.
plus, it leaves no personal information behind on the machine you run it on, so you can take your favorite browser along with all your favorite bookmarks and extensions with you wherever you go.
it's much safer than internet explorer, so safe in fact that many users have reported no spyware infections since they started using the product.
with tabbed browsing and more free extensions than you could ever want, it offers a major upgrade in your browsing experience.
