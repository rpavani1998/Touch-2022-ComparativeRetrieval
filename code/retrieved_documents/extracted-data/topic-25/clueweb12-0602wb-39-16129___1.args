but once i got it going, i was really impressed.
after my good experience with firefox, i also tried out thunderbird and sunbird.http://www.mozilla.org/products/. thunderbird is a mail client while sunbird is a calendar application.

supporting firefox just seems to be the cool thing to do".
browser compatibility is of course a bigger concern now as your app will have to work at least on ie, netscape and firefox.
but once i got it going, i was really impressed.
to know how you can support firefox, check spreadfirefox.com.
netscape’s share dropped sharply and although opera is a very good browser it never became a serious ie competitor.

i did not really believe that firefox was so good that it could kill ie.
some of the features mozilla has are capturing html form data and re-fill from the memory, a user friendly password manager and a very effective popup blocker for the nasty popups.
almost everybody who loves open source hates microsoft and so firefox is just serving as a medium to get back at microsoft.
about 8% of all hits are coming from firefox.
sunbird is still in an experimental stage but once it get ready for production and integrates well with thunderbird, sunbird and thunderbird together should be a super combination that can not only match outlook express but also give outlook a run for its money.
friendly happy to use it.
outlook express and outlook better watch out.

new 1.5 is excellent speed and user
until firefox supports opera like mouse gestures i’m not moving.
the community support for firefox is exceptional.
obscure sites are flashing spread firefox banners and blogs across sections have only good things to say about firefox.
firefox is fast, the interface is clean and actually i can’t think of any significant negatives.
i still use ie and opera but firefox is now my preferred browser.
the users have to relate with the product and promote it as if it was their own creation.
its true that java has survived and competed well with microsoft for many years now but for it to continue to thrive and compete, it also needs to learn from success stories like the firefox one.
to know how you can support firefox, check  spreadfirefox.com.
anyway, who is going to buy opera if they have a free open source and cross platform alternative to ie.
sunbird is still in an experimental stage but once it get ready for production and integrates well with thunderbird, sunbird and thunderbird together should be a super combination that can not only match outlook express but also give outlook a run for its money.
linux already did that in the os space and firefox is now doing it in the browser space.
we do this from time to time when we stumble over a good blog.
check this report:  internet explorer losing market share indicthreads.com has already got requests from 9 different versions of firefox.

opera is an awesome browser (if only the free version was ad free) and i hope it becomes completely free very soon.
but not just that because it also shows the java community that it is possible to compete with microsoft even without a big company name behind the product or a big marketing budget.

unlike many open source s/w, the installation is also very simple.
firefox has virtually taken all the goods of mozilla and re-architechured its look and feel very close to ie to address a larger user-base.
i did not really believe that firefox was so good that it could kill ie.
i feel a little sorry for opera because if opera had become totally free (no ads) and had the community support that firefox is getting today it could have been as big as firefox long time back.
