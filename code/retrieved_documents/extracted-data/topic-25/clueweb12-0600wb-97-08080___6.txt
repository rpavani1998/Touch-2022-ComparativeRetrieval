since both firefox 4 and ie9 use hardware acceleration for more  than just future 3d content, they score the maximum 60 fps with 20 fish, but ie  still beats firefox with 500 fish.

since the arrival of google chrome nearly three years ago, all browsers have come under its influence, and they've all moved in the same three-pronged directions—speedier page loading, cleaner user interfaces, and greater support for new web standards.

the company's site for its browser, calledietestdrive.com, sports a slew of demonstrations that show off hardware acceleration, which you can try running in any browser.
even chrome, which i already described as "lightning fast" in december of 2008, has sped up on the test from a time of 881ms to 267ms in version 12 on my 2.6ghz dual-core laptop—that's less than a third of the time!

apple's html5 demos, for example, flat out won't function unless you're browsing with safari.

when these first came out, the maker's own browsers widely outpaced competitors, but results on these tests are also evening out.
ie8 can't run the test since it lacks the requisite html5 support.
the first two qualities are pretty much universally desirable, but the "standards" support piece, while also desirable, gets sticky:

each browser seems to support a different subset of the many features that fall under the label html5.
all of the major browsers—chrome, firefox, internet explorer, safari, and opera—have made significant strides in each of these three dimensions.

mozilla and google have built their own javascript speed tests, kraken and v8, respectively.
the rest of the browsers have followed suit, clustering around the same level of performance.
