i can’t really give you the tech-head reasons why i feel firefox is the better, safer browser (mostly because i’m not much of a tech-head), but a large portion of the internet-savvy population agrees that it’s the way to go.i’m not saying microsoft couldn’t release a great browser right out of the box, i just think that with their deadlines and the need to think about profitability above all else, they tend to rush releases before everything is ready.you’ve got to educate your kids about malicious software, because a keylogger doesn’t care who downloads itself; it’s going to send login and password information, whether it’s to a facebook profile (bad news) or your financial accounts (worse).this is vital anyway, but if you’ve got kids clicking a mile a minute on facebook and twitter, you really need to take maximum precautions.perhaps this is true when it comes to first-person shooters and making goofy videos, but kids don’t know everything about computers, and security is one of those areas where they generally seem to lack the fundamentals.the cool thing about firefox is that there are all kinds of plug-ins (or “add-ons”) available.thirdly, obtain the burliest antivirus and firewall software you can afford, and pay the money to keep it updated.the firefox site has a big list of available add-ons.for one thing, firefox is “open source” software.plus, when i opened my web browser (internet explorer 6) and tried to visit a website, this window popped up offering a free virus scan.being a huge corporation with shareholders’ interests as their primary concern, they have multiple levels of bureaucracy to work through before they can releaseanything.this nifty little program starts you off by blocking all flash, java and javascript programs.you can afford, and pay the money to keep it updated.it came with this virus protection software, but the only thing it’s done for the past two years is tell me my subscription is expired.for example, if you visit facebook, it will start by blocking every script.
