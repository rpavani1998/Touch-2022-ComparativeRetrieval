while both google chrome and microsoft internet explorer implement the same set of anti-exploitation technologies, google chrome’s plug-in security and sandboxing architectures are implemented in a more thorough and comprehensive manner.case in point: in microsoft's own estimation, ie 9 has the best protection against phishing attacks and the most protection against socially engineered malware of the three most popular browsers.both google chrome and microsoft internet explorer implement state-of-the-art antiexploitation technologies, but mozilla firefox lags behind without jit hardening.to go back to carole's point, security can be improved vastly simply by keeping a given browser up to date, without rocking the boat on an individual's personal preference for browser maker.the study, released friday by accuvant labs, found that firefox has four "unimplemented or ineffective" security services: sandboxing, plug-in security, it hardening and url blacklisting (the last of which all three browsers flunked).therefore, we believe google chrome is the browser that is most secured against attack.besides, as sophos's carole theriault points out, the real issue isn't which browser you use; it's more about whether your browser is up to date and how you've configured its security options.the place i work is a huge healthcare organization that, when we switch to a new browser, would probably get implemented across the country, so they do need to be cautious, but not to the point of security vulnerabilities.reply opera has worst url filtering and has no jit hardening or sandboxing so it would be tied with firefox.it has a larger attack surface especially with activex enabled.after all, as accuvant puts it, it's hard to know, exactly, how long a browser hole lets the wind in, given that vendors don't necessarily go around blabbing about fix timelines: while accuvant labs did not approach microsoft for internal statistics on privately identified vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities with undisclosed remediation timelines, it is likely that these statistics exist, and could open the door for an unambiguous debate about each project’s true response time.here's accuvant's conclusion: the url blacklisting services offered by all three browsers will stop fewer attacks than will go undetected.however, from a practical standpoint you are the safest b/c no hacker is going to spend his time coding for a 2 percent browser in the english speaking web.join thousands of others, and sign up for naked security's newsletter filed under: featured, malware, privacy, vulnerability a new study has tossed the big browsers into the security mosh pit and decreed that google's chrome comes in first, microsoft's internet explorer pulls in at a close second, and mozilla firefox is bleeding a bit like a stuck pig.fake news of hugo chavez's death leads to malware microsoft offers free windows phones to android malware victims google-funded study finds firefox least secure browser, chrome the best over 100,000 people are part of the sophos community on facebook.
