arena provides resources, and i use my best judgment to allocate them.
to put it another way, it is clear to me that arena can create a great deal of customer value with new applications built around the latest web standards, but it is not clear if the value of supporting ie will outweigh the cost in engineering efficiency and forgone features.
our customers are forward-thinking—and so are we—so i tend to believe that companies like arena should lead rather than follow the market, especially when it allows us to create more value with the resources we have.
most notably, html5 and css3 have opened up a whole new world of applications just waiting to be written.

late one night in a college architecture studio, jason lentz reached that point when fatigue and deliriousness spark an idea so far out, it just may be genius.
and finally, we stopped supporting version 6 of internet explorer (ie6).
the competition between browsers to support web standards is a good thing, because the standards themselves are moving forward at an increasingly rapid clip.
if you have friends who work on web software, you’re probably familiar with the frustrations of supporting ie6—and if this is a new topic to you, justrun a search for “ie bugs” to see how problematic this particular piece of software has become.
to make matters worse, microsoft has announced that ie8 is the last version of internet explorer they will release on windows xp, so even as new versions of ie are released, a large portion of users will be stuck using version 8.
until recently, we had to accept the bugs, weak standards compliance and functional limitations ie imposed because so many of our customers relied on it.
it’s been a satisfying couple of months for the arena product team.

arena will once again be spending valuable resources to make products that work with a non-compliant and outdated browser.

google has even created a free way to give ie itself an alternative “personality” with dramatically better standards compliance in the form ofchrome frame.

the more cutting-edge and willing the customer base is to adopt saas solutions and other technologies, the more appealing it is to improve engineering efficiencies by abandoning stock internet explorer.
for example, to make a new feature in our core application work with ie6, we must code the feature using standard html, css and javascript, and then find and fix all the places where seemingly correct code is corrupted by ie6 bugs—unfortunately, the “fix” is often to remove or compromise functionality.
internet explorer, standards and customer value by eric larkin | posted inarena, innovation, business strategy it’s been a satisfying couple of months for the arena product team.

supporting internet explorer with our new apps might seem like an obvious decision, since ie remains the dominant browser for many manufacturing companies.

and now, by forming partnerships with like-minded cloud companies, we’ve been able to extend the value of cloud even further.
it’s not an overstatement to say that supporting ie6 roughly doubles our workload, leaving fewer resources available to develop new features and improvements for our customers.
this is a difficult question for any company to answer, but it is particularly difficult for arena because manufacturing has historically used ie more than other markets.
for our new applications, i envision a future in which we don’t have to do more work and accept a degraded user experience just to support the “stock”, non-chrome-frame-enhanced configuration of internet explorer.

but, as cto of arena solutions, a big part of my job is to make sure we create as much customer value as possible with the available resources—in this capacity, i think of myself as an agent for our customers.
