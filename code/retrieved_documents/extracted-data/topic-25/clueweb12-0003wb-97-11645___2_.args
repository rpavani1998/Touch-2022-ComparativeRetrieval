just as linux has emerged as the pre-eminent os for enterprise applications, firefox has an opportunity to reclaim market share from microsoft’s anemic internet explorer.firefox will improve your productivity on the web by an order of magnitude.the current plague of viruses and spy-ware and security holes is a direct consequence of leveraging monopoly power to push inferior technology on the masses, without recourse to external audits or fair competition.if the playing field were level, and if microsoft were not a convicted monopolist, then firefox would already have climbed to the top of the browser market.the web browser is the “thin edge of the wedge” that forces its way into the workplace, into the home, and begin to wean customers away from their proprietary lock-in.i still get the same web searches, but having the history right there is just incredibly valuable, and it is something one doesn’t get using google alone.firefox offers tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking.firefox offers everything that internet explorer does and a thousand things more.firefox is far, far more secure.i couldn’t be happier that version 1.0 of firefox has been released, and i look forward to the next generation of the web, with first-rate (and free) applications such as this leading the way.and by offering a rich set of tools for third-party extensions, the firefox team has already seen a rich set of rewards.with the release offirefox 1.0, the mozilla organization has incontrovertibly proven that, given enough time, the open-source development model can, and will, build superior software to that of their commercial competitors.they scared their users about the high cost of switching to alternatives, but stopped offering anything valuable in return.the developers of firefox are hackers themselves, so they know that the best ideas frequently do not come from the heads of a product’s owners, but rather from outsiders.and moreover, firefox gets a little bit better every single day, thanks to the passion of the open source development community.
