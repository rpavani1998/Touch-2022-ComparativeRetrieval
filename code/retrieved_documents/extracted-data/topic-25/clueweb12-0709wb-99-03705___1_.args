who knows how many countless computers were infected with spyware programs due to the vulnerabilities internet explorer presented.making the switch to firefox not only gives surfers new security features that are not available with internet explorer, but they also remove themselves from the target of spyware creators.because not every site is optimized for browsers such as firefox, web surfers who try to make the transition to firefox will find themselves on familiar sites that appear broken to them in firefox, but not internet explorer because internet explorer does not follow a standard set of rules that any browser can comply with.and, in the interest of giving credit where credit is due, they should be commended for finally looking to improve the security of their browser.microsoft, being the vast market share holder in the browser market, can influence the behavior of website owners and web surfers.any person who does a little research will quickly realize that most spyware programs focus on the vulnerabilities of internet explorer, since that is what most surfers use.features firefox also offers unique features that users cannot get with internet explorer.the w3cs goal for their recommendations is to avoid market fragmentation on the internet, thus creating a more uniform and more enjoyable surfing experience for web users.the w3câ€™s goal for their recommendations is to avoid market fragmentation on the internet, thus creating a more uniform and more enjoyable surfing experience for web users.microsoft views incompatibility as a competitive advantage most website developers develop a website for internet explorer first, and for the secondary browsers second.since security is the one of the biggest reasons people leave internet explorer, the people at microsoft have decided to make security a major priority.unfortunately for firefox, they have proved to be the market testing for microsoft, without microsoft having to spend any money on development.until one of these two options occurs, expect microsoft to continue to interpret the web as they see fit, and in a way that will keep users on microsoft products.in all, we made over 200 behavior changes (bug fixes or new features) under strict mode to improve css2.1 compliance.the result is nothing more than a major headache for those developing a website that is accessible to all people, regardless of the browser they are using.
