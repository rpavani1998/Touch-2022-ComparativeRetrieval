firefox is so easy to use and very versatile.while firefox just entered the ring with many already popular browsers to compete with, it still managed to capture a good percentage of the market in a comparatively short span of time.there is no doubt that ie 7 is better-looking, but firefox with its simple beauty will still continue to capture more users.just the magnitude of extensions available for firefox should make it the best browser[u can even dl videos from you tube and google video with one extension].just the fact that microsoft worked with firefox to make it compatible with vista shows its popularity.since i've gotten firefox, i have had no browser hijacks, no viruses, and virtually no spy or malware.truth is that firefox, with all its extensions, far surpasses any other browser in terms of functionality.the only gripe with firefox is that uses a lot of memory compared to the the other two.extensions do add flavor to firefox, but then i am so much comfortable with opera - i have rarely felt the need for another browser.ie takes long time to open the page and its tabbing browsing actually eats up the space and the password remembering doesn't work properly.ie7, being a part of vista, has also undergone cosmetic changes, and at the same time has even become a lot more feature-rich than its previous version.there is even an extension in firefox which can change the rendering engine to ie.ie 7, with its vista look, has an all glass theme, the buttons and the whole look has been changed so that it syncs well with vista.firefox 2 hasn't changed much from its beta release; so, talking much about it would just be a mere repetition.report abuse shiju ,bangalore, on dec 17, 2007 04:44 pm ie 7 is good, it has good security & good password protection report abuse mans ,chennai, on feb 12, 2008 02:13 pm opera 9.02 is the best browser is the best browser.if you keep a window of ie 7 open beside a window of ie 6, you will notice the changes and for all you know you might just not be able to tell if it's ie in the first place.
