internet explorer 9 should be the go-to browser for organizations concerned about protecting machines from malicious downloads, according to a new study from nss labs: microsoft’s browser trounced rivals chrome, firefox, and safari in the security company’s more recent malware-blocking tests, a significant win considering that traditional malware remains among the most prevalent threats to users.to a degree, yes, in that firefox and safari do rely on google’s safe browsing api for identifying potential malware and warning users against accessing it.in ctrlroom, interactive solutions internet explorer 9 should be the go-to browser for organizations concerned about protecting machines from malicious downloads, according to a new study from nss labs: microsoft’s browser trounced rivals chrome, firefox, and safari in the security company’s more recent malware-blocking tests, a significant win considering that traditional malware remains among the most prevalent threats to users.yes, that’s better than firefox 7′s 3.6 percent block rate and safari 5′s 3.5 percent block rate, but it’s tough to imagine the average it security professional sleeping easy with machines running browsers that are just 34.1 percent effective at blocking malware.however, with the technology implemented, chrome fared considerably better in blocking malware downloads over the span of the testing.that’s nss labs’ conclusion: “while nss does not recommend switching browsers based on the results of these tests alone, if you currently have a free choice of browser, then internet explorer 9 offers the most comprehensive protection from these particular threats.”during the tests, nss labs observed that chrome, firefox, and safari offer nearly equal protection.google rolled out its newest malicious-download protection in december, and it appears to help chrome block malware downloads.“[google's safe browsing team] has made phishing and malware detection services available to our users, and these are already implemented in firefox,” johnathan nightingale, mozilla’s director of firefox engineering, told infoworld.(pdf) — spends considerable time accusing google of depriving firefox and safari users of its latest malware-fighting capabilities, which lifted chrome far above the other two in the tests.thus, they understandably should want the best protection google can provide.the company has insisted that it has been open about how the safe browsing feature works and has made the technology available to mozilla.the api works by sending google the urls for suspicious pages or executables downloads that aren’t white-listed, and neither mozilla nor safari use it.but the best protection google provides apparently ain’t that great, if nss labs’ testing is to be believed: chrome’s malware-blocking rate using google’s latest and greatest safe browsing upgrades is still a lowly 34.1 percent.the report also discusses whether google is somehow to blame for firefox’s and safari’s for respective low scores.
