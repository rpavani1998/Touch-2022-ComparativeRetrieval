i use firefox and hate using ie for anything.

never really got into firefox even though it is the superior browser.
but safari is faster... and google chrome is the most easy and confortable web browser released.
perhaps it's a bit tinfoil hat kind of situation but i just feel more comfortable with it.
the extensions alone are make it way better than ie.
