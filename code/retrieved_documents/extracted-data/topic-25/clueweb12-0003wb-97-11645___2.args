so i created my own lightweight web-based bookmark application that listed my top 50 or so links and ranked them by the number of times i clicked on them.
put a link to it on your desktop, and, if you are windows user, make it your default web browser.
it will only take a few minutes on a fast connection and take just a few seconds to install.
amusingly, google is hosting thedefault firefox start page, but their toolbar doesn’t work on firefox yet.
firefox loads pages faster.
i estimate that 1 in 5 or so of my initial clicks are for something that i’ve been working on or looking at in the past 24 hours, and having access to that context on my homepage saves a fair bit of time recreating the search.
but all of them include links to essential sites, such as: google: i still use google when i don’t want to remember the search history.
with the release offirefox 1.0, the mozilla organization has incontrovertibly proven that, given enough time, the open-source development model can, and will, build superior software to that of their commercial competitors.
the fact that ie comes pre-installed on millions of desktop computers is the only reason that it will retain any lead at all.
ten years ago, back when they were the only portal in the game, i set my homepage toyahoo!.
this could be for any number of reasons, but more often or not it is because it is just because it is easier to keep my work and my personal life completely separate.
then it will be open sourcemail readers.
i use this site to manage miscellaneous personal notes.
aside from the time i worked at microsoft, i never used internet explorer.
it is so effective that i’d have reservations about using it at all, if not for the nascent market for text-based (and much less offensive) advertising.
and finally, once the application space has been reclaimed, the operating system itself is replaceable at little or no cost.
they are not recommendations, per se, just ways in which i’ve learned to be most productive with firefox.
having immediate access to up-to-the-minute news, weather, and sports scores seemed to be the most useful thing at the time.
eventually, a9 may be able to track different “personalities” for each user and thus obviate the need for this.
i think that rss feeds and sites likegoogle news mitigate the need for a single portal page.
however, i’ve found that the overhead of using a full wiki is fine for professional needs (we use it extensively at work), but it is a little much for personal use.
a way of switching at no cost.
i still get the same web searches, but having the history right there is just incredibly valuable, and it is something one doesn’t get using google alone.
the my yahoo page is still one of the most convenient places to keep track of news sources (i have about a dozen displayed on my customized page), scores, weather, and stock prices.
rather than capitalize on the market-share advantage they held and improve the technology itself, microsoft was content leverage their dominance by further locking their customers in.
and moreover, firefox gets a little bit better every single day, thanks to the passion of the open source development community.
and since google was so lightweight, it made for little delay in opening up a browser window.
you can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 2.0 feed.
this is an indispensable tool for staying on top of current memes on the web.
and since google was so lightweight, it made for little delay in opening up a browser window.
essential bookmarks: seeing as how i bounce around between 4 or 5 different computers during the course of my day, keeping a large bookmark directory locally on each is impractical.
the developers of firefox are hackers themselves, so they know that the best ideas frequently do not come from the heads of a product’s owners, but rather from outsiders.
those differ from computer to computer insofar as my work machines have some extra links to intranet resources.
that site doesn’t track anything about the user — much less than google does, in fact.
and, unlike local bookmarks, the interface never feels cluttered or unmanageable.
whenever i see an interesting site that i might want to return to later, i add it.
if the playing field were level, and if microsoft were not a convicted monopolist, then firefox would already have climbed to the top of the browser market.
just as linux has emerged as the pre-eminent os for enterprise applications, firefox has an opportunity to reclaim market share from microsoft’s anemic internet explorer.
the a9 toolbar: a9 managed to beat google to the punch and release a mozilla/firefox toolbar even before the official firefox 1.0 release.
i couldn’t be happier that version 1.0 of firefox has been released, and i look forward to the next generation of the web, with first-rate (and free) applications such as this leading the way.

the first step is to download a copy.
having immediate access to up-to-the-minute news, weather, and sports scores seemed to be the most useful thing at the time.
i have found dozens of sites that i otherwise would have missed simply by checking del.icio.us/popular once or twice a day.
aside from the time i worked at microsoft, i never used internet explorer.
just as linux has emerged as the pre-eminent os for enterprise applications, firefox has an opportunity to reclaim market share from microsoft’s anemic internet explorer.
essential homepage: not surprisingly, i’ve set my homepage to a9.com.
ten years ago, back when they were the only portal in the game, i set my homepage toyahoo!.
the fact that ie comes pre-installed on millions of desktop computers is the only reason that it will retain any lead at all.
the current plague of viruses and spy-ware and security holes is a direct consequence of leveraging monopoly power to push inferior technology on the masses, without recourse to external audits or fair competition.
however, i was a little frustrated with the long load times of the my yahoo! page, especially when i knew that i simply wanted to open up a browser window to go to another site.
simply because it is better in all ways than internet explorer.
that page loaded very quickly and was accessible from anywhere and it stayed as my home page for a number of years.
while the a9 toolbar is still in beta, it has all of the features of the ie toolbar, and is getting better every day.
the web browser is the “thin edge of the wedge” that forces its way into the workplace, into the home, and begin to wean customers away from their proprietary lock-in.
firefox has gone out of its way to provide a comprehensive set of apis to third-party developers so that it can get the most out of the strength of the community.
and by offering a rich set of tools for third-party extensions, the firefox team has already seen a rich set of rewards.
del.icio.us/popular: similar to the bloglines top feeds, the real power of a social bookmark manager is being able to keep abreast of what other people find interesting and useful.
a way of switching at no cost.
they scared their users about the high cost of switching to alternatives, but stopped offering anything valuable in return.
put a link to it on your desktop, and, if you are windows user, make it your default web browser.
so i created my own lightweight web-based bookmark application that listed my top 50 or so links and ranked them by the number of times i clicked on them.
the theory being that a certain percentage of time i was opening a web browser not knowing exactly where i wanted to go, but would instead be needing a search engine to find it.
essential bookmarks: seeing as how i bounce around between 4 or 5 different computers during the course of my day, keeping a large bookmark directory locally on each is impractical.
but suffice it to say that gmail is probably the first link i click on each morning and the first place i go when i sit back down at the machine.
it offers so much more functionality that i suspect you’ll stick with it.
firefox is far, far more secure.
the developers of firefox are hackers themselves, so they know that the best ideas frequently do not come from the heads of a product’s owners, but rather from outsiders.
mark fletcher, founder of bloglines, has done an amazing job with this application and adds new features every week or so.
firefox will improve your productivity on the web by an order of magnitude.
firefox offers tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking.
google’s a smart company, though, so their toolbar is sure to follow.
and moreover, firefox gets a little bit better every single day, thanks to the passion of the open source development community.
the current plague of viruses and spy-ware and security holes is a direct consequence of leveraging monopoly power to push inferior technology on the masses, without recourse to external audits or fair competition.
i use it regularly at work, and will adopt it at home once it is a little easier to toggle the privacy mode on and off.
firefox offers tabbed browsing and pop-up blocking.
they failed to fundamentally improve internet explorer.
firefox will improve your productivity on the web by an order of magnitude.
firefox offers everything that internet explorer does and a thousand things more.
del.icio.us extension: used in conjunction with the del.icio.us social bookmark manager, this extension has all but replaced my need for a local bookmarks folder.
those differ from computer to computer insofar as my work machines have some extra links to intranet resources.
that page loaded very quickly and was accessible from anywhere and it stayed as my home page for a number of years.
the web browser is the “thin edge of the wedge” that forces its way into the workplace, into the home, and begin to wean customers away from their proprietary lock-in.
combine this withbuzz andersen’s mac os x cocoal.icio.us client, and you have a very powerful, and fun, bookmark manager.
i estimate that 1 in 5 or so of my initial clicks are for something that i’ve been working on or looking at in the past 24 hours, and having access to that context on my homepage saves a fair bit of time recreating the search.
gmail: i’ve written about how important gmail is before, so i won’t extol its virtues again here.
firefox offers everything that internet explorer does and a thousand things more.
bloglines: bloglines is my favorite site for rss feed aggregation.
