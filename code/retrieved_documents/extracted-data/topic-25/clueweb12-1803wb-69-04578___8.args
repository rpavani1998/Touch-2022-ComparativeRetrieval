the above addons are my most favorites and it's a shame ie 8 has features that were in ff 2.
pages opened on opera and chrome open like a breeze.

i still use ff because its familiar to me now, but chrome is the best and safest browser around.

we can't compare firefox with ie.
and i have firewall and antivirus installed, all of the intrusions were java-downloaders etc (i update my programs religiously using secunia)
recent tests the chrome coding makes their browser faster and ff is having trouble implementing their new coding into ff 4 and they've delayed it for a while.
yes firefox is better since they are the "leader" in web browsing with the diverse addons like downthemall which makes downloads faster and youtubetomp3 which provides the youtube content to mp3 format.

chrome works fast and nice, but i can't get used to it, ie is still crap imo.
i would use ie and trust it more than ff now like i said.
