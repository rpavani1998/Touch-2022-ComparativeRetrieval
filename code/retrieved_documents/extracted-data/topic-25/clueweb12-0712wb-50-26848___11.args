report abuse subbu  ,singapore, on nov 22, 2006 11:36 am guys, ms has copied all the features of firefox and has released a version.
opera already is overwhelmingly better than firefox - no comparison there - i.e why techtree is not doing a review of opera vs firefox.
ie 7, with its vista look, has an all glass theme, the buttons and the whole look has been changed so that it syncs well with vista.
honestly - other than "adblock" which i must add is currently implemented from opera 9 onwards - opera is way better than firefox.
press control and + key, your text size increases.
certainly , i have concluded in overall aspects firefox is the best and it will remain best .
finally ,firefox is best then opera and followed by internet explorer report abuse sachin ,goa, on nov 13, 2006 11:00 pm when it comes to saving a complete web page (exectly as we see it while surfing),firefox saves a web page in a second or two where as ie takes a much longer time to do so.internet explorer could loose its market share at faster pace now due to addition of stupid genuine advantage with no real advantage seen over firefox.they are just trying to cath up with firefox with ie 7 and upcoming vista story is no different to mac.
while firefox just entered the ring with many already popular browsers to compete with, it still managed to capture a good percentage of the market in a comparatively short span of time.
while ie flaunts all the beauty, firefox on the other hand hasn't changed much in terms of looks to make it look more cool.
extensions do add flavor to firefox, but then i am so much comfortable with opera - i have rarely felt the need for another browser.

hi guys...ie7 is nothing near to firefox when we compare the easy readability and useability of the firefox.
ie 7 has only copied the idea from firefox of tabbed browsing.
press control and + key, your text size increases.
there is no doubt that ie 7 is better-looking, but firefox with its simple beauty will still continue to capture more users.
and firefox got many many features and it's pop bloc is best and the password remembering another good once plus the themes and add ons extensions many extra feature and ie spell check make it really good to use .

only empty heads use internet explorer.
whats more, it has thousands of themes to enhance the look.
the minimizetotray firefox extension doesn't use control-h, but allows you to minimize to the system tray when firefox "closes."
ie 7, with its vista look, has an all glass theme, the buttons and the whole look has been changed so that it syncs well with vista.
any day firefox is better than ie 7 .
there is even an extension in firefox which can change the rendering engine to ie.
maybe, that too can be enabled somehow.
the newer version, looking at the competition, has the use of make-up and has done a few minor touch-up jobs.

truth is that firefox, with all its extensions, far surpasses any other browser in terms of functionality.
since i've gotten firefox, i have had no browser hijacks, no viruses, and virtually no spy or malware.

this isn't a beauty contest, but that's what microsoft personally feels making most of the changes to the whole of vista family, mostly cosmetic.
ie7, being a part of vista, has also undergone cosmetic changes, and at the same time has even become a lot more feature-rich than its previous version.
firefox 2 hasn't changed much from its beta release; so, talking much about it would just be a mere repetition.
this version of ie gives that all-clear look.
just lately, we did a feature of the firefox 2 beta, you can have a look at here .

the only gripe with firefox is that uses a lot of memory compared to the the other two.
my only gripe is earlier 'find next' and other options would also appear once searching is started.
the only thing opera has on firefox is speed.
ie 7 is better-looking than firefox 2 (default skin) but that's not the only thing we actually want at the end of the day.
just the magnitude of extensions available for firefox should make it the best browser[u can even dl videos from you tube and google video with one extension].just the fact that microsoft worked with firefox to make it compatible with vista shows its popularity.

ie is still leaps behind... if we need the looks mozilla provided with lots of skins to change and the firefox is much faster and it uses less system resources..

i have used many types of browsers and all latest browsers too right from ie 5.5 to ie 7.0 beta 3 and opera 7. 2 to opera 9.02 and firefox the day it was released for windows platform.
while firefox just entered the ring with many already popular browsers to compete with, it still managed to capture a good percentage of the market in a comparatively short span of time.
if you keep a window of ie 7 open beside a window of ie 6, you will notice the changes and for all you know you might just not be able to tell if it's ie in the first place.
