wrapping up between the acid and javascript testing and our real world usage tests, we can say without a doubt that we would recommend virtually any of these browsers other than internet explorer.
internet explorer really dragged in these tests: several times during the tests, an error box popped up asking to stop running them as they were making the application run slowly.
it consistently came in last place for each of the tests and was by far the worst performing browser in the acid3 test.
dromaeo offers several sets of tests and we opted for the full range, which takes over a half hour to run.

our first javascript performance test is from dromaeo.com.
we didnt design this article to bash against microsoft, but their product truly is second class compared to the competition.
even though firefox didn’t make it to 100 and chrome had failed the ‘linktest,’ these browsers at least seemed to run the test in the same amount of time as safari.
just as in the tests, ie is tangibly slower in common use and sometimes creates problems with viewing sites as they were intended.
acid2 is designed to expose browsers and applications that inaccurately render simpler web content, particularly tests for w3c html and css compliance that should be common on the web.
firefox was perpetually middling and came in third place in half of the tests while reaching second place the other half, never completely winning any one test.
as seen with dromaeo and firefox, there was no home field advantage for safari.
if we were to give report cards as a result of the test, safari would earn the top mark of an a+ while chrome and firefox would each receive an a. internet explorer, though, clearly earned an f. speed testing with javascript many major web properties rely on javascript to accurately render the user environment.
upon allowing the add-on to load and re-running the test it progressed to 20/100, but still failed.
surprisingly, firefox was in a distant third place, and the results for internet explorer barely registered.
because of its prevalence in modern web-browsing, our speed tests focused on the browsers' ability to quickly render javascript code.

either is very lightweight and has an extremely simple user interface that gets out of the way when possible.
this is especially true given the rapid shift in market share from internet explorer's one-time dominance: according to statcounter, internet explorer currently commands just 61 percent of the browser market, while firefox has climbed to second place with 30 percent market share and the last 9 percent shared between chrome, opera, safari and smaller rivals.
it builds upon acid2 and stresses compliance with the dom (document object model) and javascript, the latter of which is crucial to most modern web apps like google docs.
the results for this test are expressed in the number of test runs per second, so the higher the score the better.

the bad - internet explorer uniformly bad in all tests.
all testing was done under actual usage scenarios with other applications running in the background.
the first time ie ran acid3, it stated that it needed to run an add-on called msxml 3.0 and it made it to 12/100 with some random graphical errors.
we can honestly say weve never seen a software application all but beg to stop a test.
chrome did in fact win this test, but safari took a close second.
it's interesting to note the internet explorer generated the most consistent sample of scores at 1.5 percent variance or less and chrome and safari generated the most scattered scores, at around 4 percent variance.
other browsers completed the tests, but the gaps were wide: firefox appropriately edged out chrome by about 30 points, but safari took the crown and more than doubled firefoxs score.
earning a 100/100 on the acid3 test means a browser has loaded and completed 100 sub-tasks and successfully changed the graphic colors with each subtask.

google of course uses the v8 javascript engine in chrome, so we anticipated a slanted result here as well.
webkit is the rendering engine for safari, so as with dromaeo and firefox we expected a slant towards chrome and safari.
again, the results are measured in milliseconds, so the lower the score the better.

safari 4 was the only browser to fully complete this test and earned a 100/100 score -- a not surprising result given the efforts of the webkit team to target the acid tests as a goal.
it's interesting to note the internet explorer generated the most consistent sample of scores at 1.5 percent variance or less and chrome and safari generated the most scattered scores, at around 4 percent variance.
all four browsers passed the acid2 test with no issues, errors, or delays, though it was originally launched in 2005 and has been used as a target for accuracy even by microsoft, which until recent years had not felt compelled to fully support w3c. acid3, however, was a 2008 update to acid2 and was considerably more of a challenge for our four contestants.
they may have garnered less than 5 percent of the global browser market, but they're both excellent browsers that deserve more.
acid2 is designed to expose browsers and applications that inaccurately render simpler web content, particularly tests for w3c html and css compliance that should be common on the web.
google of course uses the v8 javascript engine in chrome, so we anticipated a slanted result here as well.
personal usage thoughts while not the champion, the new firefox 3.5 is still noticeably faster in daily browsing than the previous 3.1 edition.
again, the results are measured in milliseconds, so the lower the score the better.
these tests verify that browsers are compliant with major web standards including w3c, html 4.0, xml 1.0, xhtml 1.1, and dom and ecma standards.
what left little mystery was internet explorer's habitual lack of performance.
firefox came close at 93/100; chrome, which also uses a modern webkit engine, matched apple at 100/100 but unusually produced an error stating that the "linktest failed.
we tried running smaller sets of tests, but each batch resulted in at least one error that prevented internet explorer from completing the run.
firefox was perpetually middling and came in third place in half of the tests while reaching second place the other half, never completely winning any one test.
all of our testing was conducted on anotebook connected to a wi-fi network to simulate real world usage.
firefox is great for those that love add-ons, and chrome and safari are both very high-speed but also low-frills.
this can largely be pinned on safari's nitro engine, which is touted as better optimized than chrome's and also has the advantage of the fairly lean webkit rendering engine to back it up.

if you havent tried one of these browsers before, we would highly recommend giving one or both of them a go for a solid week -- though mac users will likely have already spent their fair share of time with apple's software, which can't be said for windows users and chrome.

we don’t think it would be fair to say that firefox and chrome are vastly inferior to safari in their rendering capabilities; they simply don’t adhere to the standards as closely as safari does.
