until one of these two options occurs, expect microsoft to continue to interpret the web as they see fit, and in a way that will keep users on microsoft products.
we have an application compatibility toolkit that logs and identifies changes in behavior due to changes in ie 7 and vista.
a look at microsoft’s history and their current position in the market place seems to point to the idea that they will continue to buck the open source development trend and try to mold the marketplace according to their vision.
as an example, in the platform we did not focus on any proprietary properties – though we may try out new features in the future using the official –ms- prefix, following the css extension mechanism.
because not every site is optimized for browsers such as firefox, web surfers who try to make the transition to firefox will find themselves on familiar sites that appear broken to them in firefox, but not internet explorer because internet explorer does not follow a standard set of rules that any browser can comply with.
ironically enough, microsoft and the w3c have the same goal, although microsoft would like to have uniformity on the web as a result of everyone using internet explorer.
keep the advantage, eliminate the disadvantages there are a few reasons for people making the switch from internet explorer to firefox.
i like to thank especially the contributors on this blog for their participation.
the only way for us to continue to improve our standards support is to get your help in changing your sites for ie7.
they will have this ability as long as they have an overwhelming majority of the market share.
tags nested within li elements will no longer add extra bottom margin when hover occurs we no longer lose the image aspect ratio on refresh cleaned up our ident parsing according to css2.1 rules
microsoft is not worried about these people so much because they will always represent a small group of people.

but as we’ve been continually reminded, better standards support in ie also means some pages break.
1 px dotted borders no longer render as dashed bottom margin bug on hover does not collapse margins several negative margin issues fixed recalc issues including relative positioning and/or negative margins are fixed now clsid attribute of tag no longer limited to 128 characters :first-letter whitespace bug described in http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/02/460115.aspx fixed descendant selector now works properly for grand children when combined with other selectors first-line and first-letter now applies when there is no space between word :first-line and opening brace { pseudo-classes now are working as expected if selector is excluded
features firefox also offers unique features that users cannot get with internet explorer.
the result is nothing more than a major headache for those developing a website that is accessible to all people, regardless of the browser they are using.

as long as microsoft is able to hold onto its market share through segmenting the market, they will do so.
addressed many relative positioning issues addressed many absolute positioned issues % calculations for height/width for abs positioned elements http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=191182 prolog no longer causes quirks mode html element truly independent of the body (now gets its own width, height etc.)
additionally, the other side of this coin is at details on our css changes for ie7 (http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/08/22/712830.aspx): we are currently locking down ie7 for shipping and i wanted to give an update on the css work that went into ie7.
we have provided a set of documentation and tools to help you transition your pages to ie7: the ie 7 readiness toolkit pulls together documentation, tools, and guidance for developers, testers, and itpros to prepare sites, extensions and applications for ie 7.
since security is the one of the biggest reasons people leave internet explorer, the people at microsoft have decided to make security a major priority.

on the flip side, if the site works fine in internet explorer, but not in firefox, only a small percentage of your website visitors are inconvenienced.
i really like to thank everyone who helped us here.
any person who does a little research will quickly realize that most spyware programs focus on the vulnerabilities of internet explorer, since that is what most surfers use.
unfortunately for firefox, they have proved to be the market testing for microsoft, without microsoft having to spend any money on development.
microsoft is not worried about these people so much because they will always represent a small group of people.
there is the obvious group of people that truly believe microsoft is evil, so they will do anything to avoid a microsoft product no matter how much it inconveniences them.
finally, we added new features from css2.1: min/max width/height support (also for images, which did not work in ie7b2) transparent borders fixed positioning support selectors: first-child, adjacent, attribute, child a couple of css 3 attribute selectors: prefix, suffix and substring since we were working already in the code base (also the general sibling selector)

keep the advantage, eliminate the disadvantages there are a few reasons for people making the switch from internet explorer to firefox.
currently microsoft does not support all of css2s functionalities and also adds some functionalities that css2 never initially supported.
who knows how many countless computers were infected with spyware programs due to the vulnerabilities internet explorer presented.
(that means boxes do not automatically grow any more.)
making the switch to firefox not only gives surfers new security features that are not available with internet explorer, but they also remove themselves from the target of spyware creators.

the result is that these surfers who try to make the transition over to firefox will go back to the more familiar internet explorer.
developer and itpro checklists the ie developer center is the clearinghouse for all (past and present)

microsoft views incompatibility as a competitive advantage most website developers develop a website for internet explorer first, and for the secondary browsers second.

features firefox also offers unique features that users cannot get with internet explorer.
in all, we made over 200 behavior changes (bug fixes or new features) under strict mode to improve css2.1 compliance.
chris originally outlined our plans for ie7, and we listened to a lot of feedback (blog, connect database, conferences, our wasp partnership etc.) to help us address the most grievous bugs and prioritize which features to put in for ie7.

fixed parsing bugs for multi- class selectors and class selectors that are combined with id selectors and many more we also extended our existing implementations to comply with w3c specifications: enable :hover on all elements not just on background-attachment: fixed works on all elements – so eric meyer’s complexspiral demo works improved fallback
the cascading style sheet compatibility in internet explorer 7 - documentation on common breaking patterns and techniques you can do to avoid them.
in all, we made over 200 behavior changes (bug fixes or new features) under strict mode to improve css2.1 compliance.
if you have a website that works in firefox, but appears broken in internet explorer, the site appears broken to over 90% of its visitors.
a look at microsofts history and their current position in the market place seems to point to the idea that they will continue to buck the open source development trend and try to mold the marketplace according to their vision.
to preserve application compatibility we will not make any behavioral changes to “quirks mode” as it has been established since ie6.
the w3c’s goal for their recommendations is to avoid market fragmentation on the internet, thus creating a more uniform and more enjoyable surfing experience for web users.
all this work (with the exception of transparent pngs) has been done under the switch only, since all changes required behavioral updates to be more in line what the css spec specifies.
finally, as we’ve talked about before, we have a web developer toolbar, which is a great aid during the development and debugging of a website.
until one of these two options occurs, expect microsoft to continue to interpret the web as they see fit, and in a way that will keep users on microsoft products.
and, in the interest of giving credit where credit is due, they should be commended for finally looking to improve the security of their browser.
microsoft, being the vast market share holder in the browser market, can influence the behavior of website owners and web surfers.

alpha channel png support (not a css feature but too important for designers to not call it out j) better standards support…

parser bugs: * html, _property and /**/ comment bug select control: css style-able and not always on top auto-sizing of absolute positioned element with width:auto and right & left (great for 3 column layouts)

information nested block elements now respect all overflow declarations (hidden, scroll, etc) fixed the opposing offset problem (absolute positioned element whit all four top, bottom left and right are present)
