yes firefox is better since they are the "leader" in web browsing with the diverse addons like downthemall which makes downloads faster and youtubetomp3 which provides the youtube content to mp3 format.i still use ff because its familiar to me now, but chrome is the best and safest browser around.recent tests the chrome coding makes their browser faster and ff is having trouble implementing their new coding into ff 4 and they've delayed it for a while.ie 8 will slow your entire computer up.we can't compare firefox with ie.the above addons are my most favorites and it's a shame ie 8 has features that were in ff 2.chrome works fast and nice, but i can't get used to it, ie is still crap imo.and i have firewall and antivirus installed, all of the intrusions were java-downloaders etc (i update my programs religiously using secunia)i would use ie and trust it more than ff now like i said.everything else... amateur dj help the djs - producers - vocalist tracklist requests and track id user feedback / website statusascendingdescending page 11 of12 [ 172 posts ] go to page previous   1 ... 8, 9, 10, 11, 12  next advertisement have been removed for all,donate here to keep the site alive!am display posts from previous: all posts1 day 7 days2 weeks1 month3 months6 months1 year sort by authorpost timesubject ascendingdescending page 11 of12 [ 172 posts ] go to page previous 1 ... 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 next advertisement have been removed for all,donate here to keep the site alive!the djs - producers - vocalist    tracklist requests and track id user feedback / website status    feedback/comments/tech support powered by phpbb © 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007 phpbb group.fire fox way btr dan xplorer, but reacent versions of ie are much improved _________________pages opened on opera and chrome open like a breeze.
