with firefox you'll get strict anti-phishing and anti-malaware security.security opera and firefox are much more secure than ie.website designers should never use fewer than the three main browsers - firefox, ie, and opera.firefox is unquestionably best for add-on features.to sum up, if you just surf the internet, try out some browsers to see which you think is the best web browser for you.if you are a web designer, you must have several browsers, without worrying about which is best.user friendliness discussion can get quite heated because it is a matter of opinion.some of these features would only interest a web site builder.the other web site builder persuaded me to give up on making my website look good for visitors with their screen resolution set to 800 pixels wide, because fewer and fewer visitors still use such a low resolution.these are people whose reward is to keep coming up with better answers than their (friendly) rivals.web designers as i mentioned above, website designers">website designers should have at least the top three browsers installed on their computers.but i mostly use ie when firefox refuses to display web pages that are designed so that they will only work on ie, and to download videos.browse through their add-on list and pick out the ones that you will find most useful.at last my website displays the same way in all three browsers for browsers using any screen resolution higher than 800 pixels.when i was making my latest site that teaches beginners how to make their own website, i spent about a six days working through it with another website designer trying to make the site look the same whichever browser visitors used.
