this article also talks about the look and feel of ie 7, if you guys want to try firefox with vista look, please try vista fire fox 1.5.
opera already is overwhelmingly better  than firefox - no comparison there - i.e why techtree is not doing a review of  opera vs firefox.
ie 7, with its vista look, has an all glass theme, the buttons and the whole look has been changed so that it syncs well with vista.
honestly - other than "adblock" which i must add is  currently implemented from opera 9 onwards - opera is way better than firefox.
for ie it has been a leap, while for firefox  it's just been a hop-over from its already evolved product to a more evolved  version.

this isn't a beauty contest, but that's what microsoft personally feels making most of the changes to the whole of vista family, mostly cosmetic.
ie7, being a part of vista, has also undergone cosmetic changes, and at the same time has even become a lot more feature-rich than its previous version.
firefox 2 hasn't changed much from its beta release; so, talking  much about it would just be a mere repetition.

the only gripe with firefox is that  uses a lot of memory compared to the the other two.
my only gripe is earlier 'find next' and other options would also appear once searching is started.
the  only thing opera has on firefox is speed.
ie 7 is better-looking than firefox 2 (default skin) but that's not the only thing we actually want at the end of the day.
just  the magnitude of extensions available for firefox should make it the best  browser[u can even dl videos from you tube and google video with one  extension].just the fact that microsoft worked with firefox to make it  compatible with vista shows its popularity.
there is no doubt that  ie 7 is better-looking, but firefox with its simple beauty will still continue  to capture more users.
is there any firefox addon for this??
ie is still leaps behind... if we need the looks mozilla provided with lots of skins to change and the firefox is much faster and it uses less system resources..
the newer version, looking at the competition, has the use of make-up and has done a few minor touch-up jobs.
