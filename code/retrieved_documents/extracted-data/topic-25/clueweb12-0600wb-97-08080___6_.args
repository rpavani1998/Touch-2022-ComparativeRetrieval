" the speed of the web along with new standard support, all browsers have posted massive improvements in page-rendering and script execution speed.the rest of the browsers have followed suit, clustering around the same level of performance.the company's site for its browser, calledietestdrive.com, sports a slew of demonstrations that show off hardware acceleration, which you can try running in any browser.when these first came out, the maker's own browsers widely outpaced competitors, but results on these tests are also evening out.opera 11.50 279 safari 5.1 303 the next frontier in browser performance is about graphics hardware acceleration.score in ms the next frontier in browser performance is about graphics hardware acceleration.ie8 can't run the test since it lacks the requisite html5 support.chrome, however, plays the test's required sound, but fares far worse in the revolutions per minute result: browser psychedelic browsingbrowser psychedelic browsing one final test of hardware acceleration comes from mozilla, its hardware acceleration stress test, which spins a spiral of photos in the browser window and reports a score in frames per second (which tops out at the lcd's maximum of 60fps): browser mozilla hardware acceleration stress testbrowser mozilla hardware acceleration stress testgoogle chrome 12 131 (correct sound) opera 11 82 (no sound) safari 5 83 (no sound) one final test of hardware acceleration comes from mozilla, its hardware acceleration stress test, which spins a spiral of photos in the browser window and reports a score in frames per second (which tops out at the lcd's maximum of 60fps): browser mozilla hardware acceleration stress test fps (higher is better)mozilla and google have built their own javascript speed tests, kraken and v8, respectively.reproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without express written permission of ziff davis, inc. is prohibited.on these, you can clearly see ie and firefox's lead in hardware acceleration.microsoft was the first browser maker to make an issue of hardware acceleration in the buildup to its releasing ie9.apple's html5 demos, for example, flat out won't function unless you're browsing with safari.on this test, again, the browsers with graphics hardware acceleration trounced those without.
