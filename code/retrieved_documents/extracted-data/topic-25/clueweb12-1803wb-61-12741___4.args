you can also customize it a lot to your liking.
there are rare times when it has issues with some new crap on media heavy websites but it's so rare that i just use ie momentarily if it ever happens.
i don't do addons, toolbars (aside from the google one it comes with), or anything that clogs up my screen.
works just fine for 99.9% of sites i go to, which is a lot of sites.

mouse gestures and speed dial are excellent features.
