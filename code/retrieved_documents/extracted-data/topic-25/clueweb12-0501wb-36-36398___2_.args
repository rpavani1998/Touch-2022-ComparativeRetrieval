it also still has the largest development community of all of the browsers available today and its add-on architecture is not only flexible but results in top notch contributions.despite coming in third in our speed tests, it's responsive for day to day use and is quite stable, which couldn't always be said for earlier versions and other modern browsers.it also still has the largest development community of all of the browsers available today and its add-on architecture is not only flexible but results in top notchin the spirit of full disclosure and honest journalism, we should disclose that our primary browser on a daily basis is firefox.this is especially true given the rapid shift in market share from internet explorer's one-time dominance: according to statcounter, internet explorer currently commands just 61 percent of the browser market, while firefox has climbed to second place with 30 percent market share and the last 9 percent shared between chrome, opera, safari and smaller rivals.these tests verify that browsers are compliant with major web standards including w3c, html 4.0, xml 1.0, xhtml 1.1, and dom and ecma standards.there are no redeeming qualities to the software's performance or ability to draw websites, and it's bad enough that we would recommend any other browser over internet explorer unless it's absolutely required.they may have garnered less than 5 percent of the global browser market, but they're both excellent browsers that deserve more.we don’t think it would be fair to say that firefox and chrome are vastly inferior to safari in their rendering capabilities; they simply don’t adhere to the standards as closely as safari does.firefox is great for those that love add-ons, and chrome and safari are both very high-speed but also low-frills.this can largely be pinned on safari's nitro engine, which is touted as better optimized than chrome's and also has the advantage of the fairly lean webkit rendering engine to back it up.we dont think it would be fair to say that firefox and chrome are vastly inferior to safari in their rendering capabilities; they simply dont adhere to the standards as closely as safari does.because of its prevalence in modern web-browsing, our speed tests focused on the browsers' ability to quickly render javascript code.it consistently came in last place for each of the tests and was by far the worst performing browser in the acid3 test.if we were to give report cards as a result of the test, safari would earn the top mark of an a+ while chrome and firefox would each receive an a. internet explorer, though, clearly earned an f. speed testing with javascript many major web properties rely on javascript to accurately render the user environment.
