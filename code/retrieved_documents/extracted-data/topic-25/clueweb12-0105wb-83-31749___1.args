i also co-host a pc and console game related podcast calledgamercast.
while internet explorer 8 blocked 81% of malware before it reached the machine.
the things that windows do to make it harder (for an exploit to work), macs don't do.
5) internet explorer 7 already has tabbed browsing.
so not only is it more difficult to exploit vulnerabilities on internet explorer 8 on windows vista and up.
on windows, the code might show up
hacking into macs is so much easier.
4) firefox still has plenty of bugs that impact developers and designers.
of course nobody bothers reporting that this vulnerability can only be exploited on internet explorer 6, a 10 year old version and on windows xp a 10 year old operating system.
the underlying os doesn't have anti-exploit stuff built into it.
they let the process run with the same rights as the user which is fundamentally less secure then running the browser in its own little sandbox where it can't get out.
the main problem is phishing and malware.

technology wise i'm a microsoft mvp for windows desktop experience and am actively involved in several online computing related communities.
of course what he really demonstrates is how little richmurrils actually knows about technology or security, i expect he was one of the people telling people to turn uac off /facepalm, and how tech radar can't report things in context.
it's clear that all three browsers (safari, ie and firefox) have bugs.
your site works fine in internet explorer.
with stories about how it is completely unsecure.
4) firefox still has plenty of bugs that impact developers and designers.
safari on the mac is easier to exploit.
so i'll put things in context even if they can't be bothered to, firefox 3.5 has had at least 35 documented security vulnerabilities.
of course what he really demonstrates is how little richmurrils actually knows about technology or security, i expect he was one of the people telling people to turn uac off /facepalm, and how tech radar can't report things in context.
but it also requires them to somehow break out of the protected mode sandbox.
the cosmos interpreted by some conscious matter of the cosmos.
the things that windows do to make it harder (for an exploit to work), macs don't do.
namely protected mode made possible by uac.
they let the process run with the same rights as the user which is fundamentally less secure then running the browser in its own little sandbox where it can't get out.
linux based operating systems can have hundreds of vulnerabilities discovered each year, windows historically has had the fewest usually at just a dozen or two every year discovered.
ie8 blocks 83% of phishing websites completely, compared to firefox which blocks 80%.
you don't have to jump through hoops and deal with all the anti-exploit mitigations you'd find in windows (vista and later -paul).
ok let's hand control of the internet over to mozilla corporation.
tech radar recently interviewed microsoft's head security guy in the uk cliff evans.
even if i get to the code, it's not executable.
alright sure the vulnerability still exists in later versions, but it cannot be exploited on newer systems because of the additional security measures windows vista and later provide.

2) internet explorer 7 on windows vista is more secure than firefox.
the malware and phishing filters are also better on ie8, something that will protect most computer users.
while internet explorer 8 blocked 81% of malware before it reached the machine.
you don't have to jump through hoops and deal with all the anti-exploit mitigations you'd find in windows (vista and later -paul).
of course 3rd parties could use protected mode on windows vista and later like ie7 and 8 do.
firefox blocked less than 30%, and other browsers scored even worse (source).
firefox on mac is pretty easy too.
with stories about how it is completely unsecure.
so internet explorer has been the media's main victim this past week.
of course 3rd parties could use protected mode on windows vista and later like ie7 and 8 do.
one last comment is on how well google and the media have spun this around from a story about how google got broken into and people's personal data was stolen into a story about how a 10 year old browser on a 10 year old system has a single vulnerability, without even asking why google are running such dated systems or without bothering to report that newer versions of ie aren't as susceptible.

when using firefox a hacker only has to exploit code in the browser to run code on the machine.

well i suppose the media have to knock microsoft, it's about the only thing they can do when it comes to microsoft so this will have to do.
nice spin department working there.

for people offering decent employment opportunities here's myresume.
so i'll put things in context even if they can't be bothered to, firefox 3.5 has had at least 35 documented security vulnerabilities.
update: mark informed me that chrome also runs in a sandbox.
hacking into macs is so much easier.
i know when i jump there, the code is there and i can execute it there.
i know when i jump there, the code is there and i can execute it there.
but mozilla, opera and others simply don't bother.
