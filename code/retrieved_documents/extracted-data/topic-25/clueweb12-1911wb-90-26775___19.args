we’ve been constantly updating our v8 benchmark suite to force us to get faster in areas that are important to web developers.
we’re very focused on javascript performance, so we scrutinize our benchmark carefully to make sure that it’s as useful a measuring stick as possible.
as a result, the benchmark is less useful and has even (mis)led us to spend time making some irrelevant optimizations in chrome.
after the previous benchmark results that tested the latest stable versions of web browsers, people expressed their interest in the beta or alpha build results as well.
we’ve been constantly updating our v8 benchmark suite to force us to get faster in areas that are important to web developers.

we’ve fixed bugs and added new tests forregular expressions and memory management.
sebastian's numbers were a bit closer, but opera 10.6 still won (+14%).
google chrome v8 benchmarks are incredibly important for influencing the direction of javascript engines.
settings pages now have their own urls as well, giving users the ability to navigate straight to a particular setting.
unfortunately, they did not test the final version of firefox 4.
gpu accelerated video is now also a part of the new beta, reducing cpu usage for and improving battery life.
according to ie blog, when it comes to power consumption, ie9 and firefox 4 are the browsers to die for.
in case you want to test it as well, just head over to the canary builds page and seek for download link.
the highest recorded drop in cpu usage was 80% when using full screen mode.
thanks to nox for the tip.
despite very positive windows 7 reviews, it still remains the #2 operating system, right behind everyone’s beloved windows xp.
it is a new compilation infrastructure for google’s v8 javascript engine.
perhaps they were dropping a not-so-subtle hint about 10.6turning up the heat on chrome, so to speak... google chrome browser is a community site for users and developers of the google chrome browser.
results higher is better.
tomshardware has posted a nice benchmark and compared some of the most popular web browsers.
with regards to the revamped browser settings, they now open in a tab instead of a window.

it’s more than 30% faster on the sunspider suite overall and up to 4x faster on some of the individual tests.
google chrome fans will scream out of the excitement, as google has recently released the very first build of google chrome 10 with crankshaft.
as you can see from the results, ie10 has scored 99%, followed by firefox 5.0, ie9 and google chrome 13 beta.
unfortunately, the canonical version of the benchmark has not been updated to reflect all the latest changes which address at leastone important bug.
we’re posting a modified version of sunspider and the latest version of kraken to make it easy to run the benchmarks in your own browser and compare results.
passphrases can be utilized to encrypt passwords for additional security.
judging from test results, 64 build still has a long way to go.
google released the newest google chrome 10 build to the beta channel yesterday, boasting progress in the form of revamped browser settings, password sync features, as well as javascript performance.

ie metro (aka immersive web browser) uses the 64 bit libraries by default.
so here you have it folks, switching from google chrome to ie10 alone would extend your battery life by you as much as 23 minutes.
as a result, the benchmark is less useful and has even (mis)led us to spend time making some irrelevant optimizations in chrome.
just by using internet explorer 9 over opera 11 you can have an extra hour of the battery life on your laptop!
thanks to geek for the news tip.
a while back, opera 10.5 briefly snatched away the speed crown from google chrome on my system.
by comparing top 5 web browsers battery life on a hp pavillion laptop, 7tutorials found out the following… tested web browsers internet explorer 10
this just isn’t long enough to figure out which engine is faster--a golf cart and a tesla will finish a 10-foot race in nearly the same time.
that's pretty substantial, and the difference is noticeable while browsing web sites and tackling my usual daily tasks in apps like gmail, google reader, and seesmic web.
when comparing benchmark results, 64 bit version actually scored much less than the 32 bit version: 5600 points vs. 6700 points (v8 benchmark).
in rather pointless benchmark, downloadsquad has tested latest internet explorer 9 build against google chrome 6 dev.
we’ve fixed bugs and added new tests forregular expressions and memory management.

- a runtime profiler which monitors the running system and identifies hot code, i.e., code that we spend a significant amount of the time running.
with this change, the results begin to reflect chrome’s true performance.
we’re posting a modified version of sunspider and the latest version of kraken to make it easy to run the benchmarks in your own browser and compare results.
however, as js engines get faster, benchmarks must evolve in order to keep pushing them in the right direction.

- an optimizing compiler which recompiles and optimizes hot code identified by the runtime profiler.
unfortunately for internet explorer 9 and 8, they are in the bottom, followed by firefox 3.6 and safari 5.
vygantas, it’s confusing and such, just give us benchmarks already.
