they let the process run with the same rights as the user which is fundamentally less secure then running the browser in its own little sandbox where it can't get out.the malware and phishing filters are also better on ie8, something that will protect most computer users.ie8 blocks 83% of phishing websites completely, compared to firefox which blocks 80%.when using firefox a hacker only has to exploit code in the browser to run code on the machine.so i'll put things in context even if they can't be bothered to, firefox 3.5 has had at least 35 documented security vulnerabilities.4) firefox still has plenty of bugs that impact developers and designers.alright sure the vulnerability still exists in later versions, but it cannot be exploited on newer systems because of the additional security measures windows vista and later provide.the main problem is phishing and malware.so not only is it more difficult to exploit vulnerabilities on internet explorer 8 on windows vista and up.it's clear that all three browsers (safari, ie and firefox) have bugs.linux based operating systems can have hundreds of vulnerabilities discovered each year, windows historically has had the fewest usually at just a dozen or two every year discovered.of course nobody bothers reporting that this vulnerability can only be exploited on internet explorer 6, a 10 year old version and on windows xp a 10 year old operating system.2) internet explorer 7 on windows vista is more secure than firefox.firefox blocked less than 30%, and other browsers scored even worse (source).one last comment is on how well google and the media have spun this around from a story about how google got broken into and people's personal data was stolen into a story about how a 10 year old browser on a 10 year old system has a single vulnerability, without even asking why google are running such dated systems or without bothering to report that newer versions of ie aren't as susceptible.
