the truth of the  matter is, the browser is so out-dated, a lot of the stuff we browse barely  works on them anymore.
i wouldn't trust such findings any further  than i could throw them.
both google chrome and microsoft internet  explorer implement state-of-the-art antiexploitation technologies, but mozilla  firefox lags behind without jit hardening.
because it takes so long to test when a new browser is updated that basically  an even newer version comes out before they're done.
i find if something happens to their server i have a new one signed up just as  soon as i here about a leak!
reports go off automatically to apple, but the problem  remains.
as carole said in her update your parents' browser day post, people tend to stick like glue to the browsers they know and love.
reply i never hold much, if any, store by research findings that are sponsored by a company with a vested interest.
i have raised these concerns with microsoft in the past and have  never heard back from them.
stick a fork in them: they're done.
the  joy of blogging is being able to pick up on one of the headlines of the day and  throw in a bit of perspective, that's why.
the real issue isn't which browser you use; it's more about whether your  browser is up to date and how you've configured its security options.
no matter how many other browsers i try, i  always come back to opera as the most functional.
follow @lisavaas tags: browsers, chrome, firefox, google chrome, internet explorer, microsoft ie, mozilla firefox, vulnerabilties use no script and there is nothing wrong with firefox.

gee, i wonder which browser would come out on top if apple funded a study that included safari.... hmmm..... !
reply right, for whatever reason, studies of this type tend to stick to the top 3 browsers.
there's probably something they aren't telling us.
the real issue isn't which browser you use; it's more about whether your browser is up to date and how you've configured its security options.
after all, as accuvant puts it, it's hard to know, exactly, how long a  browser hole lets the wind in, given that vendors don't necessarily go around  blabbing about fix timelines: while accuvant labs did not approach microsoft for internal statistics on  privately identified vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities with undisclosed  remediation timelines, it is likely that these statistics exist, and could open  the door for an unambiguous debate about each projectâ€™s true response  time.
internet explorer is the least secure browser  for two fundamental reasons.
