ff is no longer the fastest browser around, it's chrome.
anyway if it's firefox vs ie, then its firefox all the way :d [ post made via mobile device ] wed aug 11, 2010 9:18

and i  have firewall and antivirus installed, all of the intrusions were  java-downloaders etc (i update my programs religiously using secunia)
recent tests  the chrome coding makes their browser faster and ff is having trouble  implementing their new coding into ff 4 and they've delayed it for a while.
chrome for speed, ff for  add-ons, ie for familiarity.

yes firefox is better since they are the "leader" in web browsing  with the diverse addons like downthemall which makes downloads faster and  youtubetomp3 which provides the youtube content to mp3 format.
