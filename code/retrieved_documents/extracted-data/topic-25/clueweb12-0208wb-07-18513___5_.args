according to statistics from trend micro, at present 53 percent of malware attacks come directly from the internet, compared with just 12 percent via e-mail.in past years we also used firefox for comparison, but its phishing detection rate declined to the point where it was no longer useful.nss labs put six browsers to the test using real-world threats and found thatinternet explorer 9 beta offers vastly more protection than the rest.the same technology that blocks malware sites also protects against fraudulent (phishing) sites.and we offer a new, clean streamlined user interface, with a more interactive and immersive experience."surprisingly, the majority of third-party antiphishing products can't do better than the browser's built-in protection.internet explorer 9 achieved an outstanding 99 percent blocking rate, 5 percent of which was accomplished by the browser's new application reputation system.in fact, 25 to 30 percent of these unknowns are later identified as malware.the other browsers in the test, chrome, firefox, opera, and safari, scored much lower than internet explorer.in recognition of the prevalence of this threat, vector modernbrowsers include built-in filters to protect users.the application reputation system identifies risky unknown downloads and advises the user to delete them.jeb haber, principal program manager lead for internet explorer security, did point out that the number of malware-hosting sites is vastly greater than the number of active phishing sites.pcmag's antiphishing testing uses internet explorer as a touchstone.firefox detected 19 percent of the threats, down from 29 percent.curiously, nss labs found that despite using the same service, the three products had significantly different overall detection rates.
