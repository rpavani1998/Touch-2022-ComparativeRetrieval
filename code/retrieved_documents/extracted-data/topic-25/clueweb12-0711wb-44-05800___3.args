reply i have to agree, it's nice to read headlines about google fixing a bunch of chrome vulnerabilities and then have the process happen automatically.
therefore a compromise of the browser is a potential compromise of the operating system as well.

the truth of the matter is, the browser is so out-dated, a lot of the stuff we browse barely works on them anymore.
i wouldn't trust such findings any further than i could throw them.
both google chrome and microsoft internet explorer implement state-of-the-art antiexploitation technologies, but mozilla firefox lags behind without jit hardening.
because it takes so long to test when a new browser is updated that basically an even newer version comes out before they're done.
i find if something happens to their server i have a new one signed up just as soon as i here about a leak!
reports go off automatically to apple, but the problem remains.
as carole said in her update your parents' browser day post, people tend to stick like glue to the browsers they know and love.

how does that hold up in the browser lineup?reply i wish my job would see it that way about the old browsers.
chrome gets for all services (except the aforementioned url blacklisting).
sorry, that email doesn't look right to us so we haven't added it to our list.
i'm now on version 15 and haven't seen any upgrading.
case in point: in microsoft's own estimation, ie 9 has the best protection against phishing attacks and the most protection against socially engineered malware of the three most popular browsers.
reply right, for whatever reason, studies of this type tend to stick to the top 3 browsers.
after all, as accuvant puts it, it's hard to know, exactly, how long a browser hole lets the wind in, given that vendors don't necessarily go around blabbing about fix timelines: while accuvant labs did not approach microsoft for internal statistics on privately identified vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities with undisclosed remediation timelines, it is likely that these statistics exist, and could open the door for an unambiguous debate about each project’s true response time.

i am writing articles about every security setting in internet explorer, so others can be safer using it.
besides, as sophos's carole theriault points out, the real issue isn't which browser you use; it's more about whether your browser is up to date and how you've configured its security options.
i absolutely agree it is very important to keep up with the latest version, one reason i like chrome is it keeps updating automatically.

the browser comparison found that ie has, in fact, sandboxing and plug-in security, but it's just plain old "implemented," in accuvant's eyes, as opposed to being an "industry standard," which is the star billing chrome gets for all services (except the aforementioned url blacklisting).
