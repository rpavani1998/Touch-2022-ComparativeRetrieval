shutting down the tabbed browsing, notifying users of rss feeds and alerting users about potential phishing sites should all be modified to be more visible and draw more attention from the user.other features such as the search box next to the address bar, and support for viewing rss feeds are also great, but they are already present in most competing browsers as well.the phishing filter will compare the web site against a microsoft-maintained database of known phishing sites and alert the user if the web site might be a phishing threat.it should be noted that the other major browsers such as firefox, opera and safari also fall short of passing the complete acid2 test.with ie7, microsoft will append the orginating domain name to any scripts that are executed and restrict the ability of the browser to interact with domains outside of the domain you intend to visit.with tabbed browsing, new browser windows result in new tabs on the existing ie window rather than opening separate instances or windows of ie.no phishing: microsoft is including a phishing filter feature (say that 10 times fast) which can be enabled or disabled by the user.i think a warning box notifying the user thatall tabs in that instance will be closed and asking for confirmation would be helpful.there is a little icon in the toolbar which remains grayed out on sites with no rss content, but, when you visit a site which includes rss feeds, the icon changes to red and clicking it reveals the rss feed information from that site.rss feeds: ie7 includes the ability to view rss feeds from within the browser.my thoughts on ie7 beta: the installation went fine and the browser itself seems to work as advertised.acid test: microsoft has acknowledged that ie7 will not pass the acid2 test.more ie7 beta news next explorer to fail acid test internet explorer 7 beta: a first look ie7 beta: improved security, resembles firefox netsecurity articlesif you were looking for ie7 to innovate or set the bar for competition, you will be disappointed.it worked on some sites, but not others, most notably my own about.com internet / network security site.
