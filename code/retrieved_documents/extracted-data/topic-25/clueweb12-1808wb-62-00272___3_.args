firefox is far less vulnerable to such attacks.firefox has many other features not offered by internet explorer, including the ability to view your browsing history not just by date but by name of website (alphabetical order), order in which last viewed, and so on.because internet explorer is so widely used, hackers and virus writers have queued up to try to exploit flaws in it (and in the past they have discovered many).some aspects of firefox may look unfamiliar at first if you're used to internet explorer, but if you give it a fair chance, i'm pretty sure you'll end up making it your first-choice browser application.if, as i do, you typically visit large numbers of websites during the course of your working day, firefox really can save you a significant chunk of time.it is also much better at organising your bookmarks (favorites) than internet explorer.this version of firefox includes the google toolbar, which has a pop-up blocker, automatic form filler, google search box, spell-checker, and much more.i only switch to internet explorer on the very rare occasions when a site does not seem to display or operate correctly in firefox.you can open up to five different websites in the same window and quickly switch between them using the 'tabs' at the top of the screen.sorry that's a slightly roundabout method, but by following this method the website will automatically detect what software you currently have installed and take you to the most appropriate download page.the best news is that firefox is free of charge, and you can download it via the following link: http://www.nickdaws.co.uk/firefox.htm just click on this link and click on the button that appears to go to the main information and download page.as you'll gather, i'm a big fan of firefox, and i recommend trying it out yourself and seeing if you like it.using firefox, i can flip quickly and easily between them.firefox has many other attractions as a browsing tool, however.it will also ask if you want to make firefox your default browser.
