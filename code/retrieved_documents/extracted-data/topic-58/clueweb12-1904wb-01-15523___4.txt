having  now watched a few of the early episodes, i can see both why it got canned but  also why plenty of people bought the dvds and brought about its resurrection.
check out lovefilm's online dvd rental service.
similarity to the simpsons: obvious.
conclusion: i'll  rent the second disc at some point

comments : this show is still in production despite having been cancelled twice.
with luck, later episodes feature more of  brian and stewie while making the other characters a little more memorable.
jokes about president clinton: some.
basically, it's the kind of thing you wouldn't turn on specially but that's a real score if you're flicking channels while sitting up late with a grouchy baby.
(some of the references are overly american, however, and some are out-of-date now).
it might even be better just going straight to season four and seeing if the show ever really finds its feet.
each episode is a separate scenario with no ongoing story.
that said, watching an episode of family guy is a better way to  spend twenty minutes last thing at night than hunting around on teletext for  something interesting because you can't be bothered to go to bed.
just remember not to end up doing the teletext thing as well...

it's never pleasant waking up  up on the sofa at half-seven in the morning with a small child sitting on your  head playingmario kart.
we've seen it all before.
brilliant comic characters: two.
rated: 15 story: this is an  animated sitcom about the griffin family - fat, oafish dad (peter),  hard-working, well-to-do mum (lois), insecure teenage daughter (meg), idiot  teenage son (chris), evil genius baby (stewie) and their talking,  martini-drinking dog (brian).
stuff for dads wednesday, 27 june 2007 family guy - series 1 volume 1 (dvd) starring :
the best bits are always the brief flash-back and 'what if' scenes that pop up frequently, introduced by lines such as, "i'm not so sure that's a good idea, remember the last time i did the laundry..."
family guy is far better when things revolve around stewie's plans for world domination.

conclusion: i'll rent the second disc at some point but i'm in no great rush.
family guy has moments where it is hilarious but they leap out  unexpectedly in the midst of something which is patently a wannabe ofthe  simpsons, except wackier and not as clever.
if you're desperate for some american comedy, trymy name is earl first - it's consistently funnier and more interesting.
in contrast, the actual story-lines affirming that lazy, idiot dads are really heroes can be tedious.
with luck, later episodes feature more of brian and stewie while making the other characters a little more memorable.
chances of a family guy fanboy slagging me for daring to suggest any similarity tothe
2 week free trial period.
since there are already about  a million episodes ofthe simpsons, a knock-off isn't going to get  anyone excited.
