the simpsons the simpsons can life get any better for homer j. simpson?
he juggles the roles of husband, father, safety inspector at the springfield nuclear power plant, bowler, beer drinker, astronaut, small business owner and dreamer, and makes it all look easy.

lisa simpson can't wait for college.
lisa wants everyone to know  that she is a vegetarian and that if she could have one thing (besides world  peace), it would be a pony.

her favorite  activities include playing her saxophone, attending school and reading  non-threatening boys magazine.
