the simpsons have lost their edge over the last 12 years - clever and witty in the 90s, they have become very missable since 2000 and i haven't missed them at all during that time.
the real springfield is a lumber town, and has a blue collar quality, which puts it in contrast with nearby eugene, which is home to the university of oregon, and is exceptionally liberal politically and socially.
groening also said he named some of the characters after streets in portland,  including reverend lovejoy, the school bully kearney and the simpsons'  annoyingly lovable neighbour ned flanders.

why is it that every damn article about this warm, loving, intelligent family is labelled with that ancient cliche?
in an interview with smithsonian magazine's may issue, matt groening revealed that the animated town is based on springfield, oregon, near his childhood hometown of portland.
bart is based on the creator himself, although groening changed the name  from 'matt' to 'bart' because he "had this idea of an angry father yelling  'bart,' and bart sounds kind of like bark-like a barking dog," and he  thought it would sound funny.

or, at least, it was.
it is also old news that the 'generic' quality of springfield played into his choice--he wanted an anytown, usa quality, and 'springfield' is indeed a banal and widely used name.

i think matt groening, more than anyone, would know the right answer.
i lived in portland for a couple of years, wonderful weird city, the character names mentioned come from the trendy 'alphabet district' where the streets are names in alphabetical order, so lovejoy to kearney is a short walk, and a few blocks to flanders... never did find nahasapeemapetilon st. tho.

11:54pm i thought the simpsons obsessed had worked this out years ago.
maybe originally it was set in oregon, but it's since become it's own thing and the show has made numerous jokes placing springfield in a non-existant state that's both by the coast, and in the middle of the desert, and next to mountains and bordering mexico, that it's kind of irrelevant now.
