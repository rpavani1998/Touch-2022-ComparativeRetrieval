this ranked it 3rd on the night behind family guy, which was seen by 10.17 million, and the series premiere of the cleveland show with 9.42.it was a good episode i rated a b and good ratings on homer the whooper, though it was the first of the season so was expected to have good ratings.there are no more heavy shadows like in the simpsons movie, more segments of the show are hand drawn instead computer animated, and all in all everything looks more natural.this website, it's owners, and any content on this site is not authorized by fox.i guess because the cleveland show was the series premiere, its beating the simpsons is understandable… since it was good, not great, hopefully it’ll settle down nicely with american dad in the future.last night’s season premiere of the simpsons was seen 8.21 million.if other episodes in this season are as good as this one, there in absolutely no reason for worrying about the future of the show!i think he’s rating the quality of the episodes, not the # of viewers.time for simpsons writers to man up and produce some quality episodes before we loose complete interest.fox was 2nd among adults 18-49 on the night behind nbc with it’s sunday night football.i think these ratings will be a sign to come that the simpsons dominance on sundays is over.people see the first episode and as some will stay, people expect to see a good start and won’t get it.although episode had really simple plot, it had tons of great humor.viewer ratings for last night’s animation domination have been released.i don’t really understand the way they can estimate how much people have seen some show…reply i was rating the shows on my point of view.
