quote from: baaja on october 15, 2009, 12:46:43 pm i know it's the family guy thread...but we should discuss a bit around all of the "3", family guy, the simpsons and american dad:p
i think most of us has seen it, i don't know if anybody agrees with me
i don't know, i'm just more to family guy.

just a little confused though, since they started the new "the cleveland show" where cleveland (ofc) has gotten his own show now, are they gonna continue having him in family guy?
not that family guy doesn't do the same thing from time to time, but they do know how to mock reality better than any show ever.
has to be the most random cartoon ever.
futurama is just a sister show of simpsons (same creator/writer)
the simpsons have become somewhat  formulaic like most sitcoms end up being...
he did make an appearance in the last episode though when they broke his tub again, so i'm sure we'll see him again once in a while.
nothing beats the simpsons.
nah i don't know i think simpsons had there time
but i don't think that it's better than the simpsons.
logged credits to didgy!
nah he's gone, the crew is going to need a new replacement(most likely will be mort).
all of my friends like this tv series.
from time to time, but they do know how to mock reality better than any show  ever.
i.e. you can basically expect the ending of each episode.
