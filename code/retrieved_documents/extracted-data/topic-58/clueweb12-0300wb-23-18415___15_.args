"since the passing of seinfeld last year, the simpsons is left alone as the only laugh-out-loud show on television," he said."not only do the simpsons go to church every sunday and pray, they actually speak to god from time to time.when otto, the stoned school-bus driver, becomes homeless he is invited by bart to move into the simpsons' garage.
