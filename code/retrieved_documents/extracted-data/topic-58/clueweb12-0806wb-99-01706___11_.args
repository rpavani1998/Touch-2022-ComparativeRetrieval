no matter how much we complain about our kids' short attention spans or even their attention deficit disorder, their ability to disconnect from programming has released them from the hypnotic spell of even the best tv mesmerizers.whether they are convincing us to buy a product, vote for a candidate, adopt an ideology, or simply confirm a moral platitude, the underlying reason for making television is to hold onto our attention and then sell us a bill of goods.figures from the television world are represented as cartoon characters not just to accentuate certain features, but to allow for total recontextualization of their identities.bart is a ten-year-old media strategist - or at least an unconscious media manipulator - and his exploits reveal the complexity of the current pop media from the inside out.audiences delight in watching bart effortlessly outwit his parents, teachers, and local institutions.but, most importantly, it is through bart that the writers of "the simpsons" are enabled to voice their own, more self-conscious comments on the media.bart functions as matt groening's "smile," and the child permits him--and the show's young, harvard-educated writing staff--to get away with a hell of a lot.from with the plastic safety of his incarnation as an animated character, bart can do much more than just watch and comment on media iconography.the audience interested in the program's subversive doctrine may not be large enough to keep the show in prime time, but the millions of kids who tune in every week to watch bart's antics are."the simpsons" takes place in a town called springfield, named after the fictional location of "father knows best," making it clear that the simpson family is meant as a nineties answer to the media reality presented to us in the fifties and sixties.although most well-behaved adult viewers will soldier on through a story, kids raised with remotes in their hands have much less reverence for well-crafted story arcs, and zap away without a moment's hesitation.in our current self-fed media, according to the writers of "the simpsons," a real event can have much less impact than a constructed virus, especially when its intention is revealed.as writers, they see themselves as "feeding" the show and using other media references as the fodder.many episodes are still about what happens on the simpsons' own tv set, allowing the characters to feed off television, which itself is feeding off other television.co-opting a media event out of real history, when a little girl struggled for life at the bottom of a well as rescuers worked to save her and the world listened via radio, bart uses his toy radio to fool the world and launch his own media virus.
