the characters were very well developed and never faltered, and the stories felt relatively realistic, and were often just as sweet as they were funny.that's why shows like that can last so long; they aren't plot or narrative based, but expand, grow, and change as our own culture does.i watch it for the same reason that i would watch a talk show, in that it comments on social issues and current events and can be quite funny at times.they become dated, but so much so that they eventually seem original again i will agree that it has lost a lot of its character consistency/appeal.i would have liked to see it scrapped, just in the interest of letting a new premise breathe, but then 'allen gregory' aired and i decided maybe i'd rather have the simpsons stick around after all adult animation is a niche' market, and unfortunately it's very hard nowadays to find stations that will market highbrow writing within it.i'll agree they have an okay episode or two every now and again, but in my opinion it doesn't feel like the same show, and it isn't anywhere near as good as it used to be.the characters don't feel like the same people, and it makes me sad, because i really liked the characters.now, it's just like they're trying to be like family guy and crank out anything that'll get a laugh.actually, if you haven't seen all of the episodes i'd highly reccommend that you watch futurama.i've been meaning to watch more of it, but cricket is stupid and i can't use netflix until we get better internet.14% 6 deviants said are not what they used to be, but they're still alright.the last few episodes that i've seen have been pretty good.reply *rawpoetry nov 16, 2011 well, the thing about the simpsons is it didn't used to coast on pop culture references, at least not that i remember.most of the time my poll inspiration comes from sleep deprivation or a semi food coma.5% 2 deviants said are so bad now that the thought of them angers me.
