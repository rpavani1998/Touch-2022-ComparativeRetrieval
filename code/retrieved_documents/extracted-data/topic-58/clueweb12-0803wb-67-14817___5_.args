however, their toddler, stewie, and dog, bryan (macfarlane, who won an emmy for his portrayal of stewie, in both roles), seem to escape the stock characterization of meg and chris.however, unlike "the simpsons", the first season of "family guy" proved to be one of the best first seasons ever produced.overall, however, "family guy" proves to be one of the funniest animated shows to ever hit airwaves.while it features aspects of both shows, its satire is much closer to that of "the simpsons".it does lose its satiric approach by taking a heavy handed approach to its crude humor like "south park" does but nor does it retreat into the ranks of dryer satire like "the daily show".for example, during his house arrest, peter gets television shows all confused and conjures up one entitled "homicide: life on sesame street" which depicts burt and ernie as gay lovers.however, plots aside, macfarlane and his staff of writers seem to find other points within each episode to provide a hysterical joke."family guy" does not commit the same error that "the simpsons" does.the animation seems to shift and has an overall rigid look.while stewie uses his intelligence manically to either take over the world or kill his mother, bryan drowns his in books and martinis.chris (seth green), seems to be a fourteen year old version of peter, overweight and stupid while insecure meg (mila kunis) seems to be the product of her mother.from the first episode, in which the family becomes the recipient of a erroneous welfare check, through the griffinâ€™s family experiences following y2k, to peter coaching a young golf prodigy with attention deficit disorder.stewie and bryan are, ironically enough, the most intellectual out of all the family members.i would agree that the show never evolves into anything, but it was only on for three seasons and contained roughly fifty episodes.his wife, lois (alex borstein), seems to be the back bone and mediator of the group.
