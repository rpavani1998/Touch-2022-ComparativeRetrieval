they’re all opinion, and clearly, you are a bigger simpsons fan than any of the other shows.
12 october 2009 18 comments ratings: the great wife hope 7.55 million viewers tuned into “the great wife hope” last  night, meaning the third episode of the new season is now the least watched.
this episode was by far the worst episode ever!
but the always good optimism is that they are all much higher than last year.
this episode was really good and i’m suprised more people  didn’t watch it.
after the first two eps i thought it was going to distinguish itself by having a little more heart than family guy or american dad, but it looks like it’s on track to be a cheap copy of fg.
i thought this episode was the best one so far but that  doesn’t say much since there have only been three episodes and the other  two were crap.
but the always good optimism is that  they are all much higher than last year.

while every show in fox’s animation domination ensemble saw notable  reductions in viewer numbers, both a new episode of family guy and it’s  new spin-off series the cleveland show managed to edge the simpsons out of the  top spot for the third week running, with 8.8 and 7.78 million viewers tuning  in respectively.

i still miss king of the hill.
this episode was really good and i’m suprised more people didn’t watch it.
honestly i thought that this episode will bring us even bigger numbers than  last week, but again we got a surprise (this time not so nice).
i laughed out loud which i rarely do lately!
anyway, i was surprised by how good this episode was, especially considering the premise, which seemed rather silly on paper but worked surprisingly well in practice.
even my husband ran in to watch it and he usually doesn’t care too much about simpsons.
can’t wait for the thoh this week!
also on the subject of nbc  football, go colts!!!!!
the ratings for bart gets a z say it got over a million  viewers more than cleveland last week, yet here it says cleveland beat the  simpsons “for the third week running.”
after the first two eps i thought it  was going to distinguish itself by having a little more heart than family guy  or american dad, but it looks like it’s on track to be a cheap copy of  fg.
reply i meant it was edged off the top spot for the third week running.
everyone has the right to a opinion.
i hope that thoh won’t disappoint us, big numbers are expected and  very much needed… reply rmcc(portugal) 13 october 2009 at 2:51 pm #
and i had to turn it off after the  first 10 min.
the family guy episode wasn’t so good here  are my ratings for this week family guy-7.6
honestly i thought that this episode will bring us even bigger numbers than last week, but again we got a surprise (this time not so nice).
my opinion the only reason i watch it is because i always watch animation domination the best animation domination was when it used to be on tuesdays, aka “da boom!”
this episode was awesome way better than family guy, american dad an the  cleveland show, this three look all the same… i really don’t  know why were the ratings that low, this three episodes of the 21st season were  all great!
reply cleveland show was by far the funniest of the night.
i do reckon 9million is a limit for this type of genre these days in the us.
i bet the only reason clevland show gets more episodes is because of it being a spin-off that’s

the other two were way better!!
reply the clevland show is worse then the simpsons but this episode was slightly better family guy was the 3rd with american dad 4th.
cleveland is a funny character, but i think he was funnier as a member of peter’s gang.
i’m not surprised it got low ratings.

and i’m really hoping that the halloween episode will be the best thoh so far
family guy was just terrible.
the simpsons episode was good too.
-sigh- i’ll always be bummed when family guy gets a higher rating, but it’s really sad when the cleveland show beats it.
cleveland is a funny  character, but i think he was funnier as a member of peter’s gang.
it was very funny and it had a great plot.
reply marbat has right to put his opinion here no matter is he bigger fan of the simpsons or some other show, and i see no reason why would it bother someone…reply i saw this episode last night, and honestly, in comparing with other two episodes we’ve seen this new season, it’s the worst one… maybe the best part of the episode was when marge was preparing her self for combat (especially part with mr. burns), but ultimate fight at the end was a bit disappointing, since i expected one big crowd fight…

reply i’am a fan of all the animation domination shows not just the simpsons and i’m not bias.
and i had to turn it off after the first 10 min.
it had futurama, the pj’s, i think a simpsons repeat and i’m not sure if the 4th show was family guy or king of the hill.
-sigh- i’ll  always be bummed when family guy gets a higher rating, but it’s really  sad when the cleveland show beats it.
can’t wait for the thoh this week!reply hey, what gives?
reply this episode was awesome!
this episode was the worst one this season so far, but still very good.
reply i thought this episode was actually great.
is there any point, you will always give the simpson’s high ratings anyway.
cleveland is already becoming stupider at an amazing speed; at this rate  he’ll be a clone of peter by mid-season.

cleveland, meanwhile, disappointed me.
as usual, nbc won the night with it’s sunday night football; fox was fourth overall on the night, coming second in the aged 18-34 category.
however i know the new thoh will be a lot better though.
reply pleco 12 october 2009 at 8:12 pm # cleveland show was by far the funniest of the night.
i’m not  surprised it got low ratings.
also, i record the simpsons, i don’t watch it when it airs.
i even tried to watch the cleveland show
