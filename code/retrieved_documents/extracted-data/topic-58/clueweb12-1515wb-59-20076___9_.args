if we all work together to do so, we might be able to pick up some media attention and even get the creators/writers of family guy to notice this.plagiarism is copying without bothering to make it sufficiently unique from what you're assembling your work from.he's taken plot ideas from the simpsons, but at this point in time, you can't have any original idea whatsoever without "copying" someone because every single thing has been done somewhere before.aufbruch thanks for saying this...while there are a few suspicious liftings on family guy's part...people are really going out of their way to find any and all similarities they can and labelling them "plagiarism".well, if seth macfarlane's shows are becoming funny, it must mean he's stealing the jokes from somewhere.if you wanna know what happened, chris and stewie get lost in the woods, peter believes he has psycic powers, and chris later asks out a girl with down's syndrome (i'm guessing this is where the offensive joke comes in).not saying family guy (or american dad....which is a....less defesnible story) is _completely_ innocent of this, but there are really only like 2 or 3 infractions that hold any water in the face of common sense.the new seasons of the simpsons are starting to get worse and worse, season 20 was a piece of shit.i don't think family guy is funny, but i find you funny...and they steal a joke from you...but family guy isn't funny...it would give us a show on fox that's actually funny!people frequently buy more than they use or have ones that they won't take back when they finish a move.the reality is that nothing comes from a creative vacuum--writers, all good ones, are moreso collectors and imaginative thieves than anything close to the metaphysical wellsprings of ideas people like to think they are.then rush limbal used it to describe all democrats and when questioned, sarah palin said it was ok because it was out of humor/satire...well, macfarlane doesn't actually write that much for his shows anyway.[quote=deus]funny tidbit... recently a democrat (senator or congressman not sure) used the word "retard" to describe some group (i won't say who it is) and sarah palin wanted him fired because she said it was offensive...
