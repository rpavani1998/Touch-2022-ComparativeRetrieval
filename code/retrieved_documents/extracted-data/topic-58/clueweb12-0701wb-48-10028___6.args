reply nick-tick-97 16 march 2009 at 4:44 pm # less and less ratings each week, shame it was such a good episode.
oh well i’m looking forward to next weeks episode and to in the name of the grandfather too reply bart-fan 20 march 2009 at 1:54 pm # i liked this episode more than the previous episode.
reply keep in mind, people are watching it online, and these statistics don’t include that.
in the last two years, i think people have turned much much more to internet tv.
i really liked this episode, didn’t deserve those bad ratings,:( but the ratings doesn’t make the episode.
this comes as fox have consistently programmed new episodes for three weeks in a row, and even got around to advertising this week’s episode during its commercial breaks throughout the week.

so, i watched them all but am not counted among the viewership.
this website, it's owners, and any content on this site is not authorized by fox.
also, earlier in the season i downloaded the episodes.

reply marbat 17 march 2009 at 11:54 am # i watched the episode last night (cause i recorded it vhs) and i liked it better then the last week episode, so far all of the new hd episodes have been really good
suprised it didnt get better ratings.
‘no loan again, naturally’ as second least watched episode of all time.
after all, nearly 6 millions viewers isn’t so bad, although it can be much, much better!
can’t wait to see it hope its good!reply i watched it last night, and really enjoyed it.
reply nicolas 16 march 2009 at 3:07 pm # surely, we can blame some others shows for taking viewers from the simpsons, but i also read that this episode wasn’t very good… i haven’t seen it yet, but in a couple of days i’ll give my 2 cents!
reply aww it’s a shame it got low ratings, especially considering family guy getting good ratings with a pretty lousy episode when this was top notch.

the ratings system does not care if you download or pvr or tape the episodes because you’re skipping the ads and ratings are just a way to measure whether a show is viable enough to generate revenue for the network and its advertisers.
i wonder hhow much longer these types of ratings will go on.
suprised it didnt get better ratings.
hope to see more viewers next week.
one reason for the poor ratings was the shows lead-in, one hour of the mind-numbing hole in the wall, which had an average of 2.13 million viewers (well below cancellation territory).
