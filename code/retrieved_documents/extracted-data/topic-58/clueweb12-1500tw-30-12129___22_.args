the real springfield is a lumber town, and has a blue collar quality, which puts it in contrast with nearby eugene, which is home to the university of oregon, and is exceptionally liberal politically and socially.this was the inspiration for the hometown of 'sanctimonious' marge simpson and her nuclear family, and that is a scientifically proven fact.the simpsons is still very very funny though not quite as cutting edge as it once was, before south park and family guy etc.bart is based on the creator himself, although groening changed the name from 'matt' to 'bart' because he "had this idea of an angry father yelling 'bart,' and bart sounds kind of like bark-like a barking dog," and he thought it would sound funny.it is also old news that the 'generic' quality of springfield played into his choice--he wanted an anytown, usa quality, and 'springfield' is indeed a banal and widely used name." i agree, though in a direct reversal, family guy early seasons were poor but got much better and the simpsons started off good and got a lot worse.but in 23 years on air, the show's creator has kept the real location of the town veiled, saying he didn't want to "ruin it for people" â€“ until now.all the generations of my family, from 10 to 80 love the show.12:02am leaving out the link to groening, the fact that the simpsons is near the coast, mountains and has forests implies it's somewhere in the pacific northwest.groening also said he named some of the characters after streets in portland, including reverend lovejoy, the school bully kearney and the simpsons' annoyingly lovable neighbour ned flanders.11 april 2012 2:34am if the simpsons has been running since 1989 it means bart must now be in his 30s.even the address that america's favourite animated family live at, 632 evergreen terrace, is named after groening's own childhood home address.in anticipation of the success of the show, i thought, 'this will be cool; everyone will think it's their springfield.'i wish the simpsons would piss off back to the 90's, when it was still funny and relevant.11:57pm it's pretty obvious given groening's birthplace, but the point is that it is "everyone's springfield".
