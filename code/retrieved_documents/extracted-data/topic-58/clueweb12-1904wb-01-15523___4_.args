with luck, later episodes feature more of brian and stewie while making the other characters a little more memorable.rated: 15 story: this is an animated sitcom about the griffin family - fat, oafish dad (peter), hard-working, well-to-do mum (lois), insecure teenage daughter (meg), idiot teenage son (chris), evil genius baby (stewie) and their talking, martini-drinking dog (brian).that said, watching an episode of family guy is a better way to spend twenty minutes last thing at night than hunting around on teletext for something interesting because you can't be bothered to go to bed.family guy has moments where it is hilarious but they leap out unexpectedly in the midst of something which is patently a wannabe ofthe simpsons, except wackier and not as clever.the disembodied voices of some americans, plenty of excellent visual gags and one-liners and a bunch of rejected plots fromthe simpsons.having now watched a few of the early episodes, i can see both why it got canned but also why plenty of people bought the dvds and brought about its resurrection.family guy is far better when things revolve around stewie's plans for world domination.in contrast, the actual story-lines affirming that lazy, idiot dads are really heroes can be tedious.you can also watch movies online or download movies.since there are already about a million episodes ofthe simpsons, a knock-off isn't going to get anyone excited.if you're desperate for some american comedy, trymy name is earl first - it's consistently funnier and more interesting.these provide nearly all the laugh-out-loud moments.it might even be better just going straight to season four and seeing if the show ever really finds its feet.the best bits are always the brief flash-back and 'what if' scenes that pop up frequently, introduced by lines such as, "i'm not so sure that's a good idea, remember the last time i did the laundry..."and 'what if' scenes that pop up frequently, introduced by lines such as, "i'm not so sure that's a good idea, remember the last time i did the laundry..."
