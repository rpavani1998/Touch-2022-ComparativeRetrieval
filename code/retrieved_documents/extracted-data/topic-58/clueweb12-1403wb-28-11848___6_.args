it will stabilize ratings, and hopefully will make real break through after few not-so-great seasons, just what this show needs!it will make good impression on viewers to see few good episodes consecutively week by week.this makes the episode the second highest rated this season, behind ‘bart gets a ‘z’ which had 9.32 million viewers last month.also the level of detail that is now in episodes, like the backgrounds etc really adds something new.first what you need to know is that between simpsons and family guy have been a great competition since the family guy started as a show on fox.the cleveland show followed with 7.01 million viewers, while a usually-dominant family guy had 8.28 million viewers at 9:00 (yes, it was a new episode too).this website, it's owners, and any content on this site is not authorized by fox.reason for that is surely cause f.g. made simpsons ratings much lower, they literally took over over 1/4 (or even more) of old viewers from the simpsons.i don’t think that f.g. is bad show (although i don’t like kind of art, or the way gags are presented in show), but i surely like simpsons much, much more, and i can say that i’m really proud on the simpsons when i see that their ratings are better than family guys.last night’s episode ‘the devil wears nada’ had a total of 9.04 million viewers.i say we be glad both shows are doing great so they will be on for years to come.fox was third overall for the night and second among the 18 – 49 demographic.i’m very happy with this numbers, and i’m so glad that simpsons finally got higher rates that the family guy!!!it’s surely one of the best (if not the best) episode in new season.and just to note, i wish all the luck to family guy, but as long as they are direct competition to the simpsons, i can’t say that i would like to see them in the air instead of simpsons… reply fliz 18 november 2009 at 5:37 pm # @pleco – just like lisa said in 1f18, “everybody needs a nemesis.
