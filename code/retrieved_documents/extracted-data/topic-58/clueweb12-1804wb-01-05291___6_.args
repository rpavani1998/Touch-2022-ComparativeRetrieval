the characters have become broad and bland - homer is a gleeful ignoramus, bart is "america's bad boy," lisa an annoying activist.worst yet, they've recycled the plots over and over again - remember that episode where lisa became a buddhist, much to the chagrin of everyone before they came to tolerate her preferences.often times, they waste a good ten minutes (sometimes fifteen) of an average 22-minute episode on setup alone.while the author of this piece serves some valid food for thought, i would like to hear his musings on how well the tracy ullman show "simpsons shorts" stack up against any of the recent episodes.details reply to this comment maemikemae maemikemae posted 11/18/04 @ 5:22 pm est also, most audiences who watch shows like that don't care as much about the quality and character development, which fox has shown by bringing back family guy instead of futurama because it got better re-run ratings and more dvd sales.(continued…) details   reply to this comment maemikemae maemikemae posted 11/18/04 @ 5:22 pm est also, most audiences who watch shows like that don't care as much about the quality and character development, which fox has shown by bringing back family guy instead of futurama because it got better re-run ratings and more dvd sales.as the series nears 350 episodes and sixteen seasons, i fear that they may have been more serious than they were letting on.i don't hate the simpsons, in fact i love most of the episodes through season 6, but i can't think of a single episode made since 1998 that i would ever have the desire to see again.it was a much better episode, and had incomparably better guest voices to boot (paul and linda mccartney).well i grew up with the simpsons,31 yrs of age been watching them from the start & still to this day i never get tired of the simpsons weather it is a older or current show.i steadfastly defended "homerpalooza," one of the episodes sometimes touted as the beginning of the quality slip.one of the things that apparenlty bothers the author of that article is that the jokes made on current affairs aren't current.i know the simpsons isn't nearly as good as it used to be but you shouldn't base that on the treehouse of horror eppisodes.one of the things that apparently bothers the author of that article is that the jokes made on current affairs aren't current.that's not possible; this show is spectacular.
