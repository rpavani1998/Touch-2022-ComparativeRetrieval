re: the  simpsons vs family guy i like both of them equally.
more disturbing really.
rather than saying you aren't watching that, i say to them, i  would like for you not to watch those shows, they set a bad example.
but you gotta watch it on adult swim on the cartoon network.

maybe that's why i love anime so much, the story lines are great and if there is sexual content or bad language, it's much more tastefully displayed in my opinion.
thank you for pointing out how harsh i was in my judgement.
in all  honesty, i believe that the children are going to see those things on the  street anyhow.

the family guy, any toddler that has the voice of a man, masterbates & suckles tit and is protrated as a toddler is just plain sick.

now  you are old enough to be able to desifer the comics, but a tweleve year old  watching it with her dad and then him finding humor, it's the wrong kind of  influence.
but i guess you are right to shield your family from these things.
i do have to say, though, that it depends on my mood; if i feel intellectual then i'll watch the simpsons, and if i feel like a little immature laughs i'll go for family guy.

the simpsons, if a kid can insult, put down and make his dad the butt to entertainment, that's pathatic.
