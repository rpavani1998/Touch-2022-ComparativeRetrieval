not that i was expecting anything good to begin with, but after a few minutes i couldn't even leave it on as a background distraction.
the characters don't feel like the same people, and it makes me sad, because i really liked the characters.
i've been meaning to watch more of it, but cricket is stupid and i can't use netflix until we get better internet.

actually, if you haven't seen all of the episodes i'd highly reccommend that you watch futurama.
i'll agree they have an okay episode or two every now and again, but in my opinion it doesn't feel like the same show, and it isn't anywhere near as good as it used to be.
that's why shows like that can last so long; they aren't plot or narrative based, but expand, grow, and change as our own culture does.

reply *rawpoetry nov 19, 2011 i feel like it didn't used to be to the same extent though... a lot of the stories were based around actual life situations.
the characters were very well developed and never faltered, and the stories felt relatively realistic, and were often just as sweet as they were funny.

i would have liked to see it scrapped, just in the interest of letting a new premise breathe, but then 'allen gregory' aired and i decided maybe i'd rather have the simpsons stick around after all adult animation is a niche' market, and unfortunately it's very hard nowadays to find stations that will market highbrow writing within it.

they become dated, but so much so that they eventually seem original again i will agree that it has lost a lot of its character consistency/appeal.
i watch it for the same reason that i would watch a talk show, in that it comments on social issues and current events and can be quite funny at times.
