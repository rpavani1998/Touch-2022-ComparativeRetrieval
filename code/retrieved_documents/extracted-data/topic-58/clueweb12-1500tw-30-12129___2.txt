11 april 2012 8:24am i'm pretty sure homer is named after groening's dad not (directly) after the poet.
i lived in portland for a couple of years, wonderful weird city, the character names mentioned come from the trendy 'alphabet district' where the streets are names in alphabetical order, so lovejoy to kearney is a short walk, and a few blocks to flanders... never did find nahasapeemapetilon st. tho.

11:57pm it's pretty obvious given groening's birthplace, but the point is that it is "everyone's springfield".
even the address that america's favourite animated family live at, 632  evergreen terrace, is named after groening's own childhood home address.
it was quite obvious, yes, but as he said "everyone will think it's their springfield.'

what always intrigues me though is when someone like yourself feigns indifference to an article/topic, then generalises that nobody else cares about said article/topic, but was obviously drawn enough to the article to first read and then comment on it.
all the generations of my family, from 10 to 80 love the show.
the simpsons is still very very funny though not quite as cutting edge as it once was, before south park and family guy etc.
i wish it stayed in the 90's only because i love seasons 2-8 so much and it upsets me to see the greatest tv show ever made become a caricature of itself 11 april 2012 2:30amresponse to agghtea, 11 april 2012 1:06am ..

i lived in oregon for many years, and it was widely known that matt groening borrowed a bunch of place names from oregon in general and portland in particular, and used them in the show.
i wish the simpsons would piss off back to the 90's, when it was still funny and relevant.
in an interview with smithsonian magazine's may issue, matt groening  revealed that the animated town is based on springfield, oregon, near his  childhood hometown of portland.
you killed that bit of civic pride and cultural curiosity for nothing but a touch of smugness mr groening.
bart is based on the creator himself, although groening changed the name  from 'matt' to 'bart' because he "had this idea of an angry father yelling  'bart,' and bart sounds kind of like bark-like a barking dog," and he  thought it would sound funny.

maybe originally it was set in oregon, but it's since become it's own thing and the show has made numerous jokes placing springfield in a non-existant state that's both by the coast, and in the middle of the desert, and next to mountains and bordering mexico, that it's kind of irrelevant now.

it was wrong twenty years ago and it's wrong now.
it is also old news that the 'generic' quality of springfield played into his choice--he wanted an anytown, usa quality, and 'springfield' is indeed a banal and widely used name.
