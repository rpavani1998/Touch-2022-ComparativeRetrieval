- aug 7, 2011 if i started a group based around critique/improvement, would you be interested?
i'm sure you'll think of something eventually!
not that i was expecting anything good  to begin with, but after a few minutes i couldn't even leave it on as a  background distraction.
- nov 21, 2011 should i write more photography tips?
has my writing improved over the past few months?
it  should be there in a couple of days!
- mar 1, 2010 should i try some more visual poetry?
the characters don't feel like the same people, and it makes me sad, because i really liked the characters.
i've been meaning to watch more of it, but cricket is  stupid and i can't use netflix until we get better internet.
hey internet - make my life decisions for me!

which one of these 2 do you think is better?
14% 6 deviants said are not what they used to be, but  they're still alright.
i tried to watch the pilot, and i got about halfway  through it before i decided that it was only ever going to be a huge waste of  my time, haha.
- dec 25, 2009 when you read a poetry book, do you prefer it with or without illustrations?
- feb 11, 2012 alright, my first cake attempt will be either tomorrow or monday.
- feb 15, 2012 do you buy prints from da?
actually, if you haven't seen all of the episodes i'd highly reccommend that you watch futurama.
the only thing of consequence is what we  do.
i'll agree they have an okay episode or two every now and again, but in my opinion it doesn't feel like the same show, and it isn't anywhere near as good as it used to be.
i will try to keep it up!

that's why shows like that can last so long; they aren't plot or narrative based, but expand, grow, and change as our own culture does.

- aug 19, 2011 what do you consider to be a 'professional' artist?
i've seen a few episodes of futurama, it's hilarious!
the characters were very well  developed and never faltered, and the stories felt relatively realistic, and  were often just as sweet as they were funny.
- dec 12, 2009 choose the prompt for my upcoming contest!
i'll agree they have an okay episode or two  every now and again, but in my opinion it doesn't feel like the same show, and  it isn't anywhere near as good as it used to be.
i would have liked to see it scrapped, just in the interest of letting a new premise breathe, but then 'allen gregory' aired and i decided maybe i'd rather have the simpsons stick around after all adult animation is a niche' market, and unfortunately it's very hard nowadays to find stations that will market highbrow writing within it.
- jan 30, 2012 do you get bored of seeing droplets pictures?
maybe that's the secret of pop culture references.

they become dated, but so much so that they eventually seem  original again i will agree that it has lost a lot of its character  consistency/appeal.
i watch it for the same reason that i would watch a talk show, in that it comments on social issues and current events and can be quite funny at times.
