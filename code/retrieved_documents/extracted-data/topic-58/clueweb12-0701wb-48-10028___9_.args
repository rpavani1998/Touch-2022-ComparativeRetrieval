the ratings system does not care if you download or pvr or tape the episodes because you’re skipping the ads and ratings are just a way to measure whether a show is viable enough to generate revenue for the network and its advertisers.one reason for the poor ratings was the shows lead-in, one hour of the mind-numbing hole in the wall, which had an average of 2.13 million viewers (well below cancellation territory).this comes as fox have consistently programmed new episodes for three weeks in a row, and even got around to advertising this week’s episode during its commercial breaks throughout the week.this website, it's owners, and any content on this site is not authorized by fox.in the last two years, i think people have turned much much more to internet tv.oh well it’s signed for two more seasons at least, and as long as i watch it and enjoy it everyone else can miss out on the fun for all i cares of course you have to acknowledge that its gonna be very very hard to generate new enthusiam in the show considering the length of time it’s been around.reply charles-montgomery-burns 18 march 2009 at 3:21 pm # aww it’s a shame it got low ratings, especially considering family guy getting good ratings with a pretty lousy episode when this was top notch.reply aww it’s a shame it got low ratings, especially considering family guy getting good ratings with a pretty lousy episode when this was top notch.fox was fourth overall for the night and third among adults 18 – 49.after all, nearly 6 millions viewers isn’t so bad, although it can be much, much better!reply keep in mind, people are watching it online, and these statistics don’t include that.i must say that none of the hd episodes have disappointed me yet!reply less and less ratings each week, shame it was such a good episode.after all, nearly 6 millions viewers isn’t so bad, although it can be much, much better!replyin the last two years, i think people have turned much much more to internet tv.reply name (required) mail (will not be published) (required) website rate: at long last leave view results | polls archiveloading ...suprised it didnt get better ratings.
