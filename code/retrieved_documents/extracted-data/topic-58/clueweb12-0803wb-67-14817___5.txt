this volume of the show does not feature much in the way of extra material.
"family guy" has been inappropriately branded a cross between  "the simpsons" and the animated dick and fart joke of "south  park".
you need javascript enabled to view it one of my college classes, writing about film and television, requested, on monday, that each student write a meditation on television and the experience which occurs while doing so.
however, unlike "the simpsons", the first season of "family guy" proved to be one of the best first seasons ever produced.
the video quality on this set proves to be slightly disappointing.
it  was never given the incubation time to evolve.
"family guy" revolves around the griffin family.
granted, some episodes are better than others.
i limit myself to watching the news at lunchtime and my weekly ritual of the next episode of "24".
i spent my easter weekend by sitting through all twenty-eight episodes of fox’s recently cancelled animated sitcom "family guy" and it was one of the best television experiences i’ve ever encountered.
however, this previous  weekend i had to venture from my dorm in milwaukee back to home in good old  port washington, wisconsin, the home of "step by step".

i look forward to the third  season, which hits the dvd format in fall, to cap off one of funniest  television shows i’ve ever seen.
stewie and bryan are, ironically enough, the most intellectual out of all the family members.
each disc, featuring seven episodes a piece, holds commentary tracks for two different episodes.
while stewie uses his intelligence manically to either  take over the world or kill his mother, bryan drowns his in books and martinis.
however, their  toddler, stewie, and dog, bryan (macfarlane, who won an emmy for his portrayal  of stewie, in both roles), seem to escape the stock characterization of meg and  chris.

i would agree that the show never evolves into anything, but it was only on for three seasons and contained roughly fifty episodes.
"family guy" does not commit the same error that "the simpsons" does.
his wife, lois (alex borstein), seems to be  the back bone and mediator of the group.
for example, during his house  arrest, peter gets television shows all confused and conjures up one entitled  "homicide: life on sesame street" which depicts burt and ernie as gay  lovers.
unlike "step by step"’s portrayal of port washington, there isn’t much to do.
granted, some  episodes are better than others.
chris (seth green), seems to be a fourteen year old version of peter, overweight and stupid while insecure meg (mila kunis) seems to be the product of her mother.

the audio proved adequate and i have no complaints towards it.
from the first episode, in which the family becomes the recipient of a erroneous welfare check, through the griffin’s family experiences following y2k, to peter coaching a young golf prodigy with attention deficit disorder.

the rest of the family consists of the couple’s children and their intellectual dog.

i never really watch much television anymore.
while it features aspects of both shows, its satire is much closer to that of "the simpsons".
this volume of the show does not  feature much in the way of extra material.
however, plots aside, macfarlane and his staff of writers seem to find other points within each episode to provide a hysterical joke.
however, the show makes this set worth purchasing alone.

i only found one to be below par, "holy crap", the second episode of the second season.

peter griffin  (creator seth macfarlane) is the overweight moron, and homer variation, who  serves as the head of the house.

this is because  "the simpsons" was not the working formula it is today when it began.
the only other  extra is a three minute fluff featurette on the making of the show.
the audio proved  adequate
the animation seems to shift and has an overall rigid look.
it does  lose its satiric approach by taking a heavy handed approach to its crude humor  like "south park" does but nor does it retreat into the ranks of  dryer satire like "the daily show".
