this volume of the show does not feature much in the way of extra material.
you need javascript enabled to view it one of my college classes, writing about film and television, requested, on monday, that each student write a meditation on television and the experience which occurs while doing so.
however, unlike "the simpsons", the first season of "family guy" proved to be one of the best first seasons ever produced.
the video quality on this set proves to be slightly disappointing.
granted, some episodes are better than others.
i limit myself to watching the news at lunchtime and my weekly ritual of the next episode of "24".
however, this previous weekend i had to venture from my dorm in milwaukee back to home in good old port washington, wisconsin, the home of "step by step".

i look forward to the third season, which hits the dvd format in fall, to cap off one of funniest television shows i’ve ever seen.
stewie and bryan are, ironically enough, the most intellectual out of all the family members.
while stewie uses his intelligence manically to either take over the world or kill his mother, bryan drowns his in books and martinis.
however, their toddler, stewie, and dog, bryan (macfarlane, who won an emmy for his portrayal of stewie, in both roles), seem to escape the stock characterization of meg and chris.
i would agree that the show never evolves into anything, but it was only on for three seasons and contained roughly fifty episodes.
"family guy" does not commit the same error that "the simpsons" does.
his wife, lois (alex borstein), seems to be the back bone and mediator of the group.
for example, during his house arrest, peter gets television shows all confused and conjures up one entitled "homicide: life on sesame street" which depicts burt and ernie as gay lovers.

chris (seth green), seems to be a fourteen year old version of peter, overweight and stupid while insecure meg (mila kunis) seems to be the product of her mother.

the audio proved adequate and i have no complaints towards it.
from the first episode, in which the family becomes the recipient of a erroneous welfare check, through the griffin’s family experiences following y2k, to peter coaching a young golf prodigy with attention deficit disorder.

i never really watch much television anymore.
while it features aspects of both shows, its satire is much closer to that of "the simpsons".
this volume of the show does not feature much in the way of extra material.
however, plots aside, macfarlane and his staff of writers seem to find other points within each episode to provide a hysterical joke.
however, the show makes this set worth purchasing alone.

peter griffin (creator seth macfarlane) is the overweight moron, and homer variation, who serves as the head of the house.

overall, however, "family guy" proves to be one of the funniest animated shows to ever hit airwaves.

this is because "the simpsons" was not the working formula it is today when it began.
the animation seems to shift and has an overall rigid look.
