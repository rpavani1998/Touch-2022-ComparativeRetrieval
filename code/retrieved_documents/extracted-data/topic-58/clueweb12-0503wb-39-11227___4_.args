in contrast, family guy feeds off constant randomness and incoherence.also, the simpsons came first and revolutionized television.on the other hand, family guy brought nothing new to tv, and was even cancelled three times (always returning to broadcast).the simpsons in some episodes and even the motion picture have a moral about life.i do admit it has been going on for so long the quality of the episodes has gone down, but at least not to the level of family guy.there is too much vulgarity in comparison to the simpsons (which is undeniably vulgar).if i'm ever looking for a show that has great episodes, i watch the simpsons.i cannot watch the show for long, the characters never engaged me and the jokes were of bad taste.well if i'm ever looking for a a laugh, i watch family guy.that show i can watch for hours in a row.for this thread i say family guy is a horrible rip off of the simpsons.friend codes reply with quotefriend codes reply with quote | staff| chat| blog| i absolutely love family guy.although i did find the simpsons movie hilarious.but seriously family guy is too rude xp friend codes reply with quotefriend codes reply with quote originally posted by mrstorm torilicious, my bestest mazy friend<3 the simpsons obvfriend codes reply with quote family guy is gross.friend codes reply with quotefriend codes reply with quote â–² clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie.
