so enjoying every bit of it we have here recap of this week’s episode which was titled “bart stops to smell the roosevelts”.
lets see is this character able to achieve this goal.
till then fans like me are busy collecting latest updates on the upcoming episodes.
stradivarius will be homer’s illusion after getting a head injury and he will try to make homer a man that marge cannot resist.
it will see the devout christian neighbor to homer simpson believing that the big guy upstairs is instructing him to murder various residents of the town.

called “ treehouse of horror xxii“, the episode will air on october 30.
then only we come to know that wayne was actually a highly trained government agent and that’s why he is not so friendly.

but unfortunately calmers is removed from his position due to a minor accident that takes place while camping.
like the previous episode dealt completely with bart’s newfound interest in his history books.
according to me, simpsons has maintained its family-centric plot for over 23 seasons, and the script has been developed in a manner to give equal importance to each family member.
the simpsons season 23 premiere episode had guest voice of keifer sutherland as wayne.
marge and the kids happen to get an opportunity to feast on some ethiopian delicacies, after which they decide to express their satisfaction derived from the food (and the specialty of the cuisine) through a food blog.
for this year’s halloween, “the simpsons ” will take a jab at “dexter“.
and they are taught american history about president theodore roosevelt in a different manner which makes it more interesting.
the character for which he will be voicing will be of a hollywood superspy named stradivarius cain.
