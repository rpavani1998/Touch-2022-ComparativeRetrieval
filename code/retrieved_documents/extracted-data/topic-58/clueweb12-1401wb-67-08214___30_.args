they alienate the casual simpsons viewer, who are likely to turn off or just not tune in to begin with if the stories do not interest them.the simpsons remain one of the best written shows on tv their writers continue to do justice to a 20 year old brand, no small accomplishment.king of the hill had 4.10 million viewers and american dad 4.95 million, which, compared to the simpsons at 8:00 in a more accessible timeslot is actually impressive.while i’m sure the writers are trying to find fresh ways to make new episodes, i still enjoy watching the classic simpsons episodes which had a great balance of humour, storytelling and heart.i find that these episodes purposely go beyond the simpsons universe and make them uncomfortable for me to watch… the writers seem to show less care in storytelling, and you sit in fear of what is going to happen to your favourite simpsons characters next.family guy had 6.47 million viewers at 9:00, keeping it as the number one performer for fox on sunday nights.it’s still consistently the second-highest rated show on a night where fox is having trouble introducing new content.although i still love the simpsons and will watch them until they are cancelled i think the quality has gone down because the writers now have to appeal to the slack jawed yokels like the family guy fans who want senseless entertainment with no thought or subtle humor.it’s funny how such a smart and successful show can be lost on such an obviously obtuse viewership.it’s the quality of the previous episode(s) that influences the ratings for a given episode.the fact the simpsons may still be running is fox or generating a huge income from the merch, the dvd’s etc.fox has done a horrendous job promoting the simpsons (essentially hyping it to the moon when it didn’t need hype and switching to hyping family guy – which i find unfunny and essentially unwatchable.)plan b is to move it off fox and get it onto another network, the change might make new viewers as people who say hate fox might be willing to watch it on the new channel.reply derek 11 may 2009 at 2:06 pm # all this indicates is that the average simpsons viewer doesn’t even come close to appreciating the subtle philosophical, historical, and political nuances that these storytelling episodes ooze with.the simpsons have 29 – 35 million of viewers.
