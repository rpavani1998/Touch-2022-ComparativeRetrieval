you can do the same by taking the flintstones vs the simpsons.
so, you say seth plagiarizes from simpsons, but the simpsons took from older stuff anyway.
ahh, this was a clever (and coincidental) joke, as well as the willy wonka reference.
in fact, i think that should be your official pickup line.
he probably thinks he is a certifiable genius.
01.16.2012 - 14:53 | haon no, what's cool is that the angry movie dork actually wrote a comment that isn't full of bullshit.
the lightning, its so white and make us think that you're in a smaller set, but it just my opinion.
i mean...seriously watch almost any given spoony video and keep a tally of how many mst3k riffs he uses.
at first i was thinking robot chicken (again) but that was vulcan salute and then crotch grab.
on a fun aside: the voiceactor of the down's character really has down's syndrome.

actually, i've noticed a decrease in quality this past season.

aufbruch thanks for saying this...while there are a few suspicious liftings on family guy's part...people are really going out of their way to find any and all similarities they can and labelling them "plagiarism".
[quote=deus]funny tidbit... recently a democrat (senator or congressman not sure) used the word "retard" to describe some group (i won't say who it is) and sarah palin wanted him fired because she said it was offensive...
not to mention i just thought that whole episode was kinda dull anyway.
he's taken plot ideas from the simpsons, but at this point in time, you can't have any original idea whatsoever without "copying" someone because every single thing has been done somewhere before.
- 02.21.2010 - 00:44 | rowdycmoore oh, there can only be one attorney good enough for chester.....
yeah, i thought i heard someone screaming, it sounded like there was some kind of attack going on.

if we all work together to do so, we might be able to pick up some media attention and even get the creators/writers of family guy to notice this.
heh17 that'd be awesome if it really turned out he got the joke from you and he did one or two more references to your work.
and yeah aside from adding in the southpark bit that was clearly enacting exactly what was shown on bum reviews.
i an assassin / mercenary will kill / kidnap the fox ceos!!!
on video... that's freaking creepy... who knows he might have copied you, otherwise that joke has like no connection... - 05.22.2010 - 23:20 | jegsimmons well i think it was more of a personal stab and kinda insulted her kid also instead of a generalization of a group.
it would give us a show on fox that's actually funny!
the reality is that nothing comes from a creative vacuum--writers, all good ones, are moreso collectors and imaginative thieves than anything close to the metaphysical wellsprings of ideas people like to think they are.

well, macfarlane doesn't actually write that much for his shows anyway.
i don't think family guy is funny, but i find you funny...and they steal a joke from you...but family guy isn't funny...
yay sarah palin, making sure the next 4 years will still be pretty funny even with the lack of bush jokes!
actually, i've noticed a decrease in quality this past season.
not saying family guy (or american dad....which is a....less defesnible story) is _completely_ innocent of this, but there are really only like 2 or 3 infractions that hold any water in the face of common sense.
denny can be the face.

rob had a great role in this.
only registered users can write comments!
sometimes even the big appliance boxes which sometimes even have plastic linings to protect from moisture.
plagiarism is copying without bothering to make it sufficiently unique from what you're assembling your work from.
people frequently buy more than they use or have ones that they won't take back when they finish a move.
then rush limbal used it to describe all democrats and when questioned, sarah palin said it was ok because it was out of humor/satire...
as an evil lawfirm, i will sue fox and get chester a show in family guy's time slot!
if that doesn't get you laid, i don't know what will.
if you wanna know what happened, chris and stewie get lost in the woods, peter believes he has psycic powers, and chris later asks out a girl with down's syndrome (i'm guessing this is where the offensive joke comes in).
doesn't have a nice radio to steal so his jokes get stolen instead.

i'm not surprised that he cribbed some material from this site.

the new seasons of the simpsons are starting to get worse and worse, season 20 was a piece of shit.
i totally did not see this episode coming.
(see, because i used a different character, that makes it an homage, not a ripoff.)
well, if seth macfarlane's shows are becoming funny, it must mean he's stealing the jokes from somewhere.
the goth i find it hilarious that people are taking this video seriously.
yeah, i thought i heard someone screaming, it sounded like there was some kind of attack going on.
i'd love to see his attorney character return.

now i'm really pissed that i missed that episode of family guy.
