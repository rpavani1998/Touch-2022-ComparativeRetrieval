many would argue season five of the show is a slightly weaker season than season 4, just prior to it, and whilst that may be true - certain episodes seemed to rely more upon wacky outrageous gags than strong satire and well-written wit - there's no denying this season contained several of the greatest episodes ever, and every 23-minute animated masterpiece here will satisfy a fan's appetite for the show.one complaint many simpsons fans have had with the sets has been the lack of a really complete, comprehensive documentary.this season also featured its fair share of guest stars, with big names such as conan o'brien, george harrison, the ramones, robert goulet, sam neill, michelle pfeiffer, ernest borgnine, james brown, buzz aldrin, kathleen turner and more all popping up in springfield, as well as regular special guests kelsey grammer and phil hartman also stopping by.the commentaries also prove just how funny the guys really are, even when not writing for the show: occasionally a commentary will go a little off-topic and we'll be treated to hilarious banter from the participants.the speech promises to deliver quickfire sarcasm and satire in the way in which only the simpsons can: those behind the penning of the short are all acclaimed simpsons writers, and various previews of the speech obtained by the press have apparently delivered laughs thick and fast.the audio-video quality on this set is excellent – it's improving with each successive season, and whilst we're not quite up to the impressive digital quality we'll be expecting with the later seasons, we're getting a lot closer.all are entertaining, and are in the later stages of production - the only thing really missing is some voice cleanup and sound effects.compared to that, the salaries of the original voices, $250,000 an episode, seem astronomical.this set brings a few weaker episodes with it - some purists cite "bart gets an elephant" and "lady bouvier's lover" as cases of the wacky outweighing the clever, so to speak, but to all intents and purposes, every episode here is simply great.the audio-video quality on this set is excellent it's improving with each successive season, and whilst we're not quite up to the impressive digital quality we'll be expecting with the later seasons, we're getting a lot closer.though we don't know if there's a connection, it's worth to point out that months after the first conflict with the original actors of the simpsons, the latin american voice of bart was changed and has not been changed back.the commentaries also prove just how funny the guys really are, even when not writing for the show: occasionally a commentary will go a little off-topicwith up to 7 or 8 contributors a time, there's rarely a quiet moment, and whilst the occasional sections of indecipheral information are present when more than one person is talking at a time, for the most part we get to hear some really interesting people discuss a really interesting show.on january 8th news media all over the region began to report that the voices of homer (done by humberto velez, see photo), marge (nancy mckenzy), bart (claudia mota), lisa (patricia acevedo) and mr. burns (gabriel chávez) would change beginning with next season.union conflict may result in replacing simpsons actors.
