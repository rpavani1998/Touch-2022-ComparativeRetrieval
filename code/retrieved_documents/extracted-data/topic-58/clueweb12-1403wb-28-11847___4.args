i notice this time the writers are coming up with ideas, and not just recycling.
nobody deleted anything, your comment was... - apocaloso: i thought this was a really funny show.
great couch gag even though i thought last weeks was better.
the episode was good i especially liked the beginning.
the bop-it sequence was priceless.

reply - ryan 12 december 2009 at 12:31 pm # i hope that the simpsons goes back to the glory years when it got 12 million or at least it becomes moreviewed than family guy although i think family guy is funny.
the story was really good.
this season has really improved in the writing and funniness of episodes.
and if its a good episode, that also helps too.
i especially loved first part of the episode, but plot and ending were rather nice.

i love how lisa is so smart, is a vegitarian, cares about the world and is now starting to embrace magic.
hope that other christmas time episodes will also have lovely scenes like this episode.

i don’t think that it’s bad because we have modern animation in the show, like in the simpsons movie.
i don’t expect some enormously big number (over 10 million), i hope that it will stay round 9 millions.

this episode was not bad.
fox was 3rd overall on the night on both the adults 18-49 and 18-34 ratings shares.
my fave episode was lisa the drama queen and this one is right up there with it.
the next new episode, “o brother, where bart thou”, airs december 13th on fox.

i thought it was funny how two of the act breaks showed someone about to die.

first few minutes really reminded me of the alaska part of the movie, which was my favorite.
glad to see the viewer ship staying up.
reply scott 1 december 2009 at 6:34 pm # thought the first act was great especially the bambi part.

comments ratings: rednecks and broomsticks all shows in fox’s weekly animation domination last night were up on last week’s, and what’s more, a new episode of the simpsons won the night for the third time this season, with 8.9 million tuning in, a 27% increase on last week’s 7.39 million.
thought the first act was great especially the bambi part.
at least it beated family guy.
the story was intriguing and really entertaining.
family guy was a close second with 8.48 million watching (13% increase); new episodes of the cleveland show and american dad scored 7.2 (6% increase) and 6.4 million (18% increase) viewers respectively.
