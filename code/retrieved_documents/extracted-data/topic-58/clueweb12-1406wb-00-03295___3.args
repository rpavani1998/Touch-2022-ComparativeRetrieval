family guy is just more hilariously random, in my opinion.
thank you for pointing out how harsh i was in my judgement.
rather than saying you aren't watching that, i say to them, i would like for you not to watch those shows, they set a bad example.
the simpsons, if a kid can insult, put down and make his dad the butt to entertainment, that's pathatic.

it leaves behind a lingering odor and commotion of emotions we wish not to organize.
the whole house went without tv.

when i took tv away from the kids, i didn't sit and watch it in front of them.

robot chicken, as well, is spontaneously amusing, and i find it enjoyable as well, but i have to say family guy takes the cake.
i mean no harm and hope that no one takes me the wrong way.
i really shouldn't have left it hanging out there like that without explaining myself and i promise you and everybody that i will be more careful from now on.

in all honesty, i believe that the children are going to see those things on the street anyhow.
reward large, but purnishments should match the crime.

the family guy, any toddler that has the voice of a man, masterbates & suckles tit and is protrated as a toddler is just plain sick.

i do have to say, though, that it depends on my mood; if i feel intellectual then i'll watch the simpsons, and if i feel like a little immature laughs i'll go for family guy.
now you are old enough to be able to desifer the comics, but a tweleve year old watching it with her dad and then him finding humor, it's the wrong kind of influence.

you sort of have to be a geek to understand some of the content, however, and i am not ashamed to admit myself as somewhat of a nerd.
maybe that's why i love anime so much, the story lines are great and if there is sexual content or bad language, it's much more tastefully displayed in my opinion.
if you screw up, everybody pays.
