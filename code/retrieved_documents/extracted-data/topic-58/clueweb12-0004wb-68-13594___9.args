since, at the beginning, he was still something of a father, who might be annoyed by the childishness of his son or even by his son’s failure to behave, it was a good demonstration of how homer in some waysfit his role of father, but lacked the moderation or maturity to behave ashe was supposed to.
the writers count on the youth of their fan base to get away with this fraud.
it was a pleasure, then, to watch the cartoon wars episodes recently and have them skewerthe family guy so beautifully, a show about which i cannot say enough ill.

i don’t think, though, that homer strangling bart is the equivalent of “kick the baby”.

it’s not even libertarian, because they believe that most people are idiots.

an episode like “that 90s show” is extremely self-aware and post-, since of course the 90s was a decade that the simpsons helped to define, and the writers know that (the episode begins the same way as another popular episode where we see marge and homer in the 70s).
example: in one episode, police have to negotiate with tom cruise to come out of hiding in the closet of stan marsh’s room.
for me, this endless succession of bones to pick and axes to grind makes the show’s stories much more interesting than they would otherwise be.

your analysis of episode mechanics, in particular, strikes me as correct.

the first episode about the alien anal probes isn’t about anything, but as time has gone on they’ve started to say more and more interesting things.
i still find many episodes too disgusting to watch, and a significant amount of the humor is just dumb.
but the most irritating aspect of the show is their blatant plagiarism of the simpsons, as when stewie uses extended arm skin flaps to glide in the sky - a feat that was carried out by “old jewish man” (2 years before) during the olympic games for the elderly when he leaped from the high-dive board.
the lines wobble and the sight gag of bart’s head ‘squishing’ up when homer strangles him is common (homer strangles him whenever he realizes that bart is making fun of him: “why you little…”).
a couple episodes have stayed with me as templates for my thinking.

i’m also glad you reminded me of their take on alcoholism: itwas unusual and delightful to have someone criticize the idea that alcoholism is a disease.
and, frankly, i think the show’s kept up its quality (such as it is) remarkably well over the years.
homer looks and sounds like a dangerous monster.
an episode i saw recently [3] was pretty clever in many ways.

i wasn’t particularly convinced, but it made me immediately grateful for the dialectical space it created.
i think this was groening making the successful show more like his comic books, which are fairly intellectual.
if you don’t stop and look around once and a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it” but he also likes authori-teh).
his tremendous selfishness, his fantastic prowess at manipulation, and his simultaneous childishness are a combination that parker and stone clearly understand enough to preserve.
and, frankly, i think the show’s kept up its quality (such as it is) remarkably well over the years.
then, as groening et al. figure out the medium, everything slows down, the animation gets cleaner and the focus shifts to the complex three-act stories with all the cultural references.
sometimes their take is so contrarian that it makes you glad contrarians exist (the “bloody mary” episode has an interesting take on alcoholism[1]).
homer strangling bart was (aside from a good sight gag) a demonstration of homer’s inability to restrain his impulses.
family guy is funny sometimes but all of the gross stuff just makes it not worth it.
june 2, 2008 by nate i was horrified by south park when it came on the air.
that homer’s inability to parent more effectively is essentially parallel to bart’s failure to be a good kid is, of course, obvious to us and part of the cleverness of it.
i’d take any of those episodes in a second over the satire of episodes like “that ’90s show”, where the characters are unimportant, and exist merely to serve up a smörgåsbord of (admittedly decent) cultural references and jokes.
all this is to say that i consider it part of the sophisticated character structures that informed stories and interactions in the early years.
then, the simpsons has had to transition from a creative labor of love to a social institution, like saturday night live.

family guy has some okay moments (mostly from the earlier seasons) but the style of humor presented is sometimes lazy, as when they break in with the live action musical performances or use excessive flatulence.

this is a compelling picture, in my opinion, where many of us feel fundamentally unsuited (or at least occasionally unsuited) to the roles we must play, as much as we frequently are grateful for them, too.
