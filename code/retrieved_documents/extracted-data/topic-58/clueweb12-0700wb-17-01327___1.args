there are no more heavy shadows like in the simpsons movie, more segments of the show are hand drawn instead computer animated, and all in all everything looks more natural.
get well adam, don’t worry about us, we’ll wait for the new information, and i am really impressed with your enthusiasm about simpsons channel!
i thought that rates will be around 10 million, but this is still not bad for a first episode of new season.
hopefully the rest of the season will be great too!reply this week oct 4 1.

i think these ratings will be a sign to come that the simpsons dominance on sundays is over.
it was a good episode i rated a b and good ratings on homer the whooper, though it was the first of the season so was expected to have good ratings.
but i was disappointed with this episode it only revolved around homer and comic book guy it should have been involved with other simpsons characters not comic book guy he’s one of my least favorite characters.
as big of a simpsons fan i am, fg was funnier last sunday.
i guess because the cleveland show was the series premiere, its beating the simpsons is understandable… since it was good, not great, hopefully it’ll settle down nicely with american dad in the future.
