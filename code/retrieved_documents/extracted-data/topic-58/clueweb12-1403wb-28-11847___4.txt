the story was really good.
this season has really improved in the writing and funniness of episodes.
and if its a good episode, that also helps too.
i especially loved first part of the episode, but plot and ending were rather nice.

i don’t think that it’s bad because we have modern animation in  the show, like in the simpsons movie.

i don’t  expect some enormously big number (over 10 million), i hope that it will stay  round 9 millions.

reply brad cruise 30 november 2009 at 5:38 pm # what happened to marbat and his ratings?
fox was 3rd overall on the night on both the adults 18-49 and 18-34 ratings shares.
my fave episode was lisa the drama queen and this one is right up there with it.
anyway, it should be noted that the 19-49 demo of the simpsons (4.2) was not as high as family guy’s (4.4) reply - ashley 1 december 2009 at 3:41 pm #
the next new episode, “o brother, where bart thou”, airs  december 13th on fox.
what a great season so far!

reply fox_executive 1 december 2009 at 2:23 am # last week’s episode had 6.883 million viewers, just for the record.
i thought it was funny how two of the act breaks showed someone about to die.

comments ratings: rednecks and broomsticks all shows in fox’s weekly animation domination last night were up on last week’s, and what’s more, a new episode of the simpsons won the night for the third time this season, with 8.9 million tuning in, a 27% increase on last week’s 7.39 million.
haha they disappeared!
thought the first act was great especially the bambi part.
at least it beated family guy.
the story was intriguing and really entertaining.
family guy was a close second with 8.48 million watching (13% increase); new episodes of the cleveland show and american dad scored 7.2 (6% increase) and 6.4 million (18% increase) viewers respectively.
