according to me, simpsons has maintained its family-centric plot for over 23 seasons, and the script has been developed in a manner to give equal importance to each family member.following a salary dispute between the main cast and 20th century fox television which produces the show, it has just been officially announced on friday noon, october 7 that the longest running primetime scripted show on the air will stay for two more seasons.bart has always been mischievous and this time his mischief has cost his school heavily destroying its fundraiser.marge and the kids happen to get an opportunity to feast on some ethiopian delicacies, after which they decide to express their satisfaction derived from the food (and the specialty of the cuisine) through a food blog.marge is tired with handling the mundane household chores on a daily basis and expresses that she is jealous of her husband for not leaving any opportunity for her to have fun with the children.they morph into the land’s indigenous one-eyed avatars, but when bart finds love and an eternal mate abroad, he is caught in planet warfare.in a newly released sneak peek for the special halloween episode, the eldest child of homer and marge is seen waking up as a single-eyed creature and boasting about facing his bullies with his new body.bart and his friends stand for the teacher who changed them a bit (though not much as how can bart be changed so easily, we also love bart as he is).stradivarius will be homer’s illusion after getting a head injury and he will try to make homer a man that marge cannot resist.this new season of the simpsons series we will be having several guest voices namely, of jane lynch, joan rivers, keifer sutherland, andy garcia, michael cera and jeremy irons.in simpsons season 23 episode 3, marge is angry over the fact that homer is the one always enjoying with the kids while the household chores keep her busy.it focused completely on incidents that for the first time inculcated bart’s interest in the subject of history.the clip presents a springfield version of the showtime series’ opening credits complete with the theme song.later in premiere episode of the simpsons season 23 we see that homer shows his true friendship by giving wayne a shelter but landing up into trouble due to this.so, that was bart’s tryst with the meaning and purpose of academics; the upcoming episode completely shifts focus to his mother, mrs. marge simpsons.
