the simpsons, if a kid can insult, put down and make  his dad the butt to entertainment, that's pathatic.

the family guy, any toddler that has the voice of a man, masterbates & suckles tit and is protrated as a toddler is just plain sick.
how many shows can claim a global impact and smart comedy? ???

the whole house went without tv.
we all know of it, yet  we all fear its aura.
rather than saying you aren't watching that, i say to them, i  would like for you not to watch those shows, they set a bad example.
american television seems to be devolving, and i've never found those shows very funny.

it's like telling them, do as i say not as i do.
i do have to say, though, that it depends on my mood; if i feel intellectual then i'll watch the simpsons, and if i feel like a little immature laughs i'll go for family guy.
some open their arms  gratefully when that day comes...
now  you are old enough to be able to desifer the comics, but a tweleve year old  watching it with her dad and then him finding humor, it's the wrong kind of  influence.

maybe that's why i love anime so much, the story lines are great and if there is sexual content or bad language, it's much more tastefully displayed in my opinion.
if you screw up, everybody pays.
