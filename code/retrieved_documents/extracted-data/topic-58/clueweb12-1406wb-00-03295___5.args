rather than saying you aren't watching that, i say to them, i would like for you not to watch those shows, they set a bad example.
maybe that's why i love anime so much, the story lines are great and if there is sexual content or bad language, it's much more tastefully displayed in my opinion.

in all honesty, i believe that the children are going to see those things on the street anyhow.
i do have to say, though, that it depends on my mood; if i feel intellectual then i'll watch the simpsons, and if i feel like a little immature laughs i'll go for family guy.

robot chicken, as well, is spontaneously amusing, and i find it enjoyable as well, but i have to say family guy takes the cake.
i mean no harm and hope that no one takes me the wrong way.

reward large, but purnishments should match the crime.
the whole house went without tv.
logged outside of a dog a book is man's best friend.
the family guy, any toddler that has the voice of a man, masterbates & suckles tit and is protrated as a toddler is just plain sick.

now you are old enough to be able to desifer the comics, but a tweleve year old watching it with her dad and then him finding humor, it's the wrong kind of influence.
