family guy has some okay moments (mostly from the earlier seasons) but the style of humor presented is sometimes lazy, as when they break in with the live action musical performances or use excessive flatulence.this is a compelling picture, in my opinion, where many of us feel fundamentally unsuited (or at least occasionally unsuited) to the roles we must play, as much as we frequently are grateful for them, too.but the most irritating aspect of the show is their blatant plagiarism of the simpsons, as when stewie uses extended arm skin flaps to glide in the sky - a feat that was carried out by “old jewish man” (2 years before) during the olympic games for the elderly when he leaped from the high-dive board.homer strangling bart was (aside from a good sight gag) a demonstration of homer’s inability to restrain his impulses.then, as groening et al. figure out the medium, everything slows down, the animation gets cleaner and the focus shifts to the complex three-act stories with all the cultural references.then, the simpsons has had to transition from a creative labor of love to a social institution, like saturday night live.the writers count on the youth of their fan base to get away with this fraud.that homer’s inability to parent more effectively is essentially parallel to bart’s failure to be a good kid is, of course, obvious to us and part of the cleverness of it.since, at the beginning, he was still something of a father, who might be annoyed by the childishness of his son or even by his son’s failure to behave, it was a good demonstration of how homer in some waysfit his role of father, but lacked the moderation or maturity to behave ashe was supposed to.and, frankly, i think the show’s kept up its quality (such as it is) remarkably well over the years.the lines wobble and the sight gag of bart’s head ‘squishing’ up when homer strangles him is common (homer strangles him whenever he realizes that bart is making fun of him: “why you little…”).sometimes their take is so contrarian that it makes you glad contrarians exist (the “bloody mary” episode has an interesting take on alcoholism[1]).an episode like “that 90s show” is extremely self-aware and post-, since of course the 90s was a decade that the simpsons helped to define, and the writers know that (the episode begins the same way as another popular episode where we see marge and homer in the 70s).i still find many episodes too disgusting to watch, and a significant amount of the humor is just dumb.his tremendous selfishness, his fantastic prowess at manipulation, and his simultaneous childishness are a combination that parker and stone clearly understand enough to preserve.
