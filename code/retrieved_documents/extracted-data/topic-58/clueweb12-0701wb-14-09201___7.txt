norwegian:) watch s20 e21, it’s great.
this is great news, i hope that next season will  be much better than the last one (if it is possible ).
since they’re such a staple, i’d hope that they’d take some risks.
, i hope that it will keep going for a while too, despite all the quality  complaints.
but other than that, it  looks really interesting and i can’t wait for it to air in australia.
and for god’s sake, shake things up!
it looks soooooooooo cooool!!!!
in their usual respective 9.00pm and 9.30pm time slots, and the series premiere offamily guy spin-off the cleveland show at 8.30pm.
it’s little unrealistic to expect that the simpsons will  run for ever, we are all aware that it’s not possible, but what we can  hope for is another 4-5 seasons.
how about some guest writers or directors?
interesting… homer as a super-hero… besides pie-man… is in a film… but still, interesting… 2 more years and it’s on portugal!
dreply love the simpsons, can’t wait for the season to begin!reply love the simpsons!!!
reply nick 18 june 2009 at 5:07 pm # that’s amazing, 21 seasons.
reply mathias 28 september 2009 at 4:08 pm # love the simpsons!!!
we can only hope that simpsons will have a lot of viewers, so fox will make  contract for another season (or even seasons).
reply i wish fox would release season 99 (2088-2089) episodes of the simpsons on dvd years before they’re actually aired.
but it’s stupid that they did not send the new episodes in norway yet.
treehouse of horror xx it should be the best!
it’s not like they’ll lose any viewers…reply ya, i hope that it will keep going for a while too, despite all the quality complaints.
this website, it's owners, and any content on this site is not authorized by fox.
this  seasons had some good eps, but on the whole was very poor.
it will be interesting to  actually watch a tv series that may very well outlive several generations of  americans.
i hope that sideshow bob comes back!reply the simpsons for everreply this show is a hundred percent better than family guy.
reply santos l. halper 19 june 2009 at 5:45 pm # i’m pretty sure the everyman episode is the one seth rogan + his  writing partner wrote.
18 june 2009 25 comments the simpsons season 21 premiere announced the 21st season of the simpsons will premiere on sunday, september 27th,  2009 on fox at 8.00pm.
im looking  forward to the horror episode.
yeah, i know for that, but a lot of fans were frighten  when people from fox said that they gonna reconsider their contract when they  saw not-so-great ratings… hope that new season gonna bring  something good, so that fox gonna make new contract.
reply i can’t wait for season 21.
wouldn’t it make more sense to air it closer to halloween?
i hope the simpsons never end!!!
treehouse of horror xx it should be the best!reply that’s amazing, 21 seasons.
it’s little unrealistic to expect that the simpsons will run for ever, we are all aware that it’s not possible, but what we can hope for is another 4-5 seasons.
i wish they’d do a season where it’s one (or more) big over-arching plot line, like arrested development.
and for god’s sake,  shake things up!
or having a plot continue over a number of weeks?
since they’re  such a staple, i’d hope that they’d take some risks.
but it’s stupid that they did not  send the new episodes in norway yet.
reply so am i the only person who’s not looking forward to that everyman stuff (which, by the way, is the seth rogen episode, although i thought he’d be able to write something more original than that)?reply i hope there is another episode like “who shot mt burns” where there was an exciting two parter (but this time make them on the same season).

definitley one of the best/smartest shows on television reply jay hunter 2 july 2009 at 10:38 am # i’m one of those fans who think the simpsons has gotten very stale  and formulaic, but will probably never tear themselves away from the show.
reply gaulty 11 july 2009 at 12:36 pm # @dominic – on a different point, they wouldn’t put a two parter  mid-season cos, well it would be less suspensful and the people who watched the  season finale would be eager to watch the season premiere and therefore that  equals higher ratings.
but other than that, it looks really interesting and i can’t wait for it to air in australia.

this is great news, i hope that next season will be much better than the last one (if it is possible ).
the 21st season of the simpsons will see comic book guy create a superhero  called everyman, which is adapted into a film starring homer, “treehouse of horror xx,” the twentiethtreehouse of horror episode, and will see the return of jackie mason who will voice krusty the  clown’s father rabbi hyman krustofski.
the simpsons will rise up  again and destroy family guy for the garbage that it is.

this will be joined by the season premieres of family guy and american dad!

we shouldn’t be disappointed with one or  two year contract with fox, it is just one more little victory for the show and  one more step forward.
we can only hope that simpsons will have a lot of viewers, so fox will make contract for another season (or even seasons).reply actually there’s a contract till 2011 but after that they’ll make a new onereply @rmcc(portugal)
