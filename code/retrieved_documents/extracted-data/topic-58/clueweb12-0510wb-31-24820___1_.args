the sales of these dvd sets were astronomical and somehow convinced the ‘suits’ at fox that there was an opportunity to make even more money off of the griffin family.and just as "the simpsons" has big stars fighting to do voiceover work, this handful of episodes includes 'appearances' from the likes of robert downey jr., charles durning, frank sinatra jr., wallace shawn, carrie fisher, will sasso, bob barker, sherman helmsley, marion ross, tom bosley, paula abdul, jay leno, carol channing, bob costas, pat sajak, alex trebek, carrot top, bryan cranston, adam carolla, betty white, and michael clarke duncan.there are also multi angle comparisons for scenes from four of the episodes, which give you the opportunity to see how the original storyboards looked.this show is refreshing in its gleeful attempts to tick off everyone on the planet.it combined the rapid-fire editing of the “simpsons” with the taboo humor of “south park” and delivered a constant barrage of laughs.so, in an unprecedented move, the studio decided to bring back the previously cancelled show, much to the delight of audiences everywhere.but while this new set may have fewer episodes than some of the previous sets, there are still a ton of extra features, every bit as funny as the series itself.every single episode has commentary with seth mcfarlane, who is joined on and off by just about everyone who ever had anything to do with the series.plus you'll find a 14 minute behind the scenes featurette that allows mcfarlane and some of his other directors to show us how an animation director does his job, a short visit with artist peter shin who shows us how to draw stewie, and a look at the "family guy" offices as actor adam west is given a tour.after the release of that 2nd volume, “family guy” fans such as myself figured we had seen the last of peter griffin, his wife lois and his three adorable children, meg, chris and little stewie.additionally there are about 43 deleted scenes from the season and some animatics that can be accessed from your dvd-rom.just to give you an example… the first episodes of the third season alone, “the thin white line”, poked fun at drug abuse, pregnant teenagers, people in wheelchairs and charles manson.this new season brought with it the opportunity to see just how much more offensive it could get without being edited.he then proceeds to name off every failed series that fox had aired in their time slot since the cancellation.the very first scene shows peter standing in front of his family and talking about how long of a summer it had been, but goes on to say how wonderful it was to have sooo many terrific shows to watch.
