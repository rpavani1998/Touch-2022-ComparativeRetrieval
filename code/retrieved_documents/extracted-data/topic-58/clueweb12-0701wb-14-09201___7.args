this is great news, i hope that next season will be much better than the last one (if it is possible ).
since they’re such a staple, i’d hope that they’d take some risks.
, i hope that it will keep going for a while too, despite all the quality complaints.
but other than that, it looks really interesting and i can’t wait for it to air in australia.

it’s little unrealistic to expect that the simpsons will run for ever, we are all aware that it’s not possible, but what we can hope for is another 4-5 seasons.
interesting… homer as a super-hero… besides pie-man… is in a film… but still, interesting… 2 more years and it’s on portugal!
we can only hope that simpsons will have a lot of viewers, so fox will make contract for another season (or even seasons).
but it’s stupid that they did not send the new episodes in norway yet.
it’s not like they’ll lose any viewers…reply ya, i hope that it will keep going for a while too, despite all the quality complaints.

this seasons had some good eps, but on the whole was very poor.
it will be interesting to actually watch a tv series that may very well outlive several generations of americans.

reply so am i the only person who’s not looking forward to that everyman stuff (which, by the way, is the seth rogen episode, although i thought he’d be able to write something more original than that)?reply i hope there is another episode like “who shot mt burns” where there was an exciting two parter (but this time make them on the same season).
definitley one of the best/smartest shows on television reply jay hunter 2 july 2009 at 10:38 am # i’m one of those fans who think the simpsons has gotten very stale and formulaic, but will probably never tear themselves away from the show.
reply gaulty 11 july 2009 at 12:36 pm # @dominic – on a different point, they wouldn’t put a two parter mid-season cos, well it would be less suspensful and the people who watched the season finale would be eager to watch the season premiere and therefore that equals higher ratings.

i’m pretty sure the everyman episode is the one seth rogan + his writing partner wrote.

the 21st season of the simpsons will see comic book guy create a superhero called everyman, which is adapted into a film starring homer, “treehouse of horror xx,” the twentiethtreehouse of horror episode, and will see the return of jackie mason who will voice krusty the clown’s father rabbi hyman krustofski.
the simpsons will rise up again and destroy family guy for the garbage that it is.
