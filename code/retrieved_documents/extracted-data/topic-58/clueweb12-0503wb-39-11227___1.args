if i'm ever looking for a show that has great episodes, i watch the simpsons.
i do admit it has been going on for so long the quality of the episodes has gone down, but at least not to the level of family guy.
in that debate i supported digimon, which in my opinion is better than nintendo's counterpart in terms of story and character development.
i cannot watch the show for long, the characters never engaged me and the jokes were of bad taste.
there is too much vulgarity in comparison to the simpsons (which is undeniably vulgar).
