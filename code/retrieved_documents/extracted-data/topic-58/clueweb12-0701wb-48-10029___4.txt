the episode attracted511,000 viewers on sky 1 in ireland earlier this week, more than doubling sky 1′s previous highest audience for any program in ireland.
these international figures, of course, are not included in the north american ratings.
i watched it on sky and the uk are getting good ratings for the simpsons seeing that its muuuuuuuuuuuuch smaller then the us.
reply charles-montgomery-burns 23 march 2009 at 3:42 pm # yay, yay for ratings, it’s weird that for the uk just under 1 million  viewers is great ratings for sky.
i hope that next episode will bring more that 6.5 millions, and it’s  also great that there is a big number of uk viewers, but it is probably only  this time because the plot of this episode was in ireland… reply brandon f 23 march 2009 at 11:38 pm #

at least the ratings are higher than last weeks.
