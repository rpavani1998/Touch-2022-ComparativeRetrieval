(ann kaplan, feminist criticism and tv) just 10% of nike's annual $978 million a year advertising budget would lift nike's subcontracted workers' wages to a livable level.we believe that paying a living wage will result in higher profits to both nike and its subcontractors.one answer to nike's moral leadership dilemmas would be to conduct action research experiments that would convince executives and factory owners and managers that feudalistic sweatshop practices are less profitable and less efficient than more modern and even postmodern ones.this would mean establishing research grants for university research into such issues as the viability and effectiveness of codes of conduct, what is a sweatshop, how to measure living wages, and the relationship between the university and organizations such as fair labor association, workers rights consortium, and collegiate apparel who offer alternative and different monitoring standards and programs.45 academic scholars have organized into four study groups and made a proposal to put the question of sweatshops versus modern factory methods to an empirical test (boje et al, 2000).the purpose of the action research is to develop interdisciplinary work and dialogue that will address a set of action research questions that is of growing concern to academics, the general public, and the nike corporation.we believe this is an attainable objective for the nike corporation, its subcontractors, and global workforce.the protests forced more than fifty universities and colleges to capitulate to students' demands and join the worker rights consortium (wrc) workers rights consortium (wrc) and james keady, a student turned activist,  spend their free time promoting a new nike image,  with young girls spending 12 to 14 hours a day in 100-degree heat, six days a week, on an nike assembly line in asia gluing sports shoes while they breathe toxic toluene fumes and earn about a dollar  a day.the protests forced more than fifty universities and colleges to capitulate to students' demands and join the worker rights consortium (wrc) workers rights consortium (wrc) and james keady, a student turned activist, spend their free time promoting a new nike image, with young girls spending 12 to 14 hours a day in 100-degree heat, six days a week, on an nike assembly line in asia gluing sports shoes while they breathe toxic toluene fumes and earn about a dollar a day..the scholars should stop pretending to be neutral and objective in a situation where people-especially women and young girls-are being exploited and are suffering so that excessive profits may continue to be generated by nike and the corporations that indulge in similar practices.what i have proposed is a way for nike to sustain its global economic power, but enjoy the fruits of modern factory practices.in nike's code of conduct, they say they respect the right to organize.any profit gained by overwork and snatching time for mealtimes and rest breaks and from paying the least possible bare subsistence wage and over-work in unhealthy and unpleasant situations was meager compared to the output of the high productivity enterprise.if a journalist or activist finds child labor, force overtime, unsafe conditions, nike will demand that the subcontractor clean it up.nike provides course materials, access to nike executives, and financial incentives that make student or faculty-critique of nike at st. john's problematic.multi-skilling, for example, is seen as a way to enhance worker's negotiating position.
