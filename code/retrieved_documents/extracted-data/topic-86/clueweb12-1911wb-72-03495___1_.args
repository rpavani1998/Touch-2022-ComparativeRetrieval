aside from these two traits, nike shoes, as opposed to that of adidas, have a much more comfortable interior.while some might argue that because nikes are lighter this makes movement much better, i have found that once the shoes wear out (which happens quite often), i slide around the court unable to control the valuable seconds of time i need to get to the next shot.while this might seem insignificant to any recreational player, all competitive players know that this contributes greatly to a player's ability to turn and push in any direction.while not the same as the slipper-like feel of nike's tennis shoes, the soles of adidas shoes conform well to the shape of the foot very quickly, and don't put too much pressure on the toes.because of this monopoly on the sporting industry, nike has allowed itself enough room to expand its design.this addition to the shoe, a lighter and more reactive foam, allows for greater spring in the step while also allowing for greater impact force when stepping down.in my experience, playing close to 1-2 hours everyday (including sprinting, sliding and stopping), i have found that adidas tennis shoes can last at minimum 2 weeks.the reason that i believe adidas to be the better shoe is because, from the perspective of a competitive player, while bold colors and new shoe technology are great, they don't win matches.as a competitive tennis player, i constantly go through shoes every 2-3 weeks, and i have found that nike shoes tend to last me at most 2 weeks.common traits among nike shoes related to design are that they are: flashy consistently endorsed by professionals and are constantly upgrading technology for example, in the last line of nike shoes (the nadal air series), the apparel featured strong contrasting colors, small dots for breathability and lunarlite technology (will be explained in the comfort section).because of this, adidas can often feel heavy to the user, but with practice, this feeling goes away.the results have been dramatic and revolutionary.â with more than 700 patents on new sports equipment and shoes before his death in 1959, adidas was able to maintain its number one spot until just recently, with nike in first place.â with more than 700 patents on new sports equipment and shoes before his death in 1959, adidas was able to maintain its number one spot until just recently, with nike in first place.despite this fact, the small dots covering the exterior of the shoe do allow for greater movement and flexibility.
