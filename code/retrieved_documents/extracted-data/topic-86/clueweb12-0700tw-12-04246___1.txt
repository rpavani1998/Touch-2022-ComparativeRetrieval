now as  the release date approaches, everyones saying how nice they are….
@audeblu says: march 5th, 2012 at 2:09 pm i'll have no chance at getting these….. resellers are camping out  right now!!
just because people are going to be looking to make a  quick buck…
if they were smart, they'd just make it a gr for a short time and be done  with it.
when its really not their fault.
thats alot of money in your pocket if you get the chance to.
but im not gonna camp a whole week for this craps……….. most def the black and pink didn't cop the first ones, not gunna cop these either, but in my opinion i think these look better….
hype kills says: march 5th, 2012 at 1:51 pm but it doesnt matter to me because i cant afford these no way.
i saw these same shoes on a site for like 89.99 and i will be copping them quick!!!
***big infinite*** says: march 5th, 2012 at 1:52 pm lets hype these up people!!!!
i need those black solar red let the "_____" begin!!!!!!!!
i guess hype does that to people… to me they look alrite, i just don't like how the upper and the toe box look with the all mesh.
i think da yeezy 1s were better, but dat wolf grey & platinum pair is dope… but i.hope people dat want these get them.
2 just 2 wtf what happen to 5 man this is just gonna make things more out of hand i really hope if they only doing 2 they make a good amount still limited but enough for most to cop $225 i believe
kayla says: march 5th, 2012 at 1:10 pm i take that back i don't wish anyone getting hurt but damn stop messing up  the sneaker game for a quick buck that sh*t is whack!
watch a lot of us not get yeezy's the same a lot of us ( including myself) didn't get galaxy foams -_- 215 i remember seeing it on nike.com and not being able to copp!!

but it doesnt matter to me because i cant afford these no way.
i wanna say dee says: march 5th, 2012 at 3:27 pm resellers should be sentenced to death !
that  notion still remains, but it’s becoming a difficult task to track the  progress of the air yeezy 2 with nike keeping such a tight lid on the project.
the heel and  ankle of the shoes look pretty fresh tho littleacker09 says: march 5th, 2012 at 6:30 pm just spiting it out now to any re-sellers out  there…………..go ta hell login or register to leave a comment make sure to register if you  comment regularly.
nike air yeezy 2 black/solar red 508214-006 wolf grey/pure platinum 508214-010 nike air yeezy 2 black/solar red nike air yeezy 2 wolf grey/pure platinum i like the black and pink ones!
this past friday, sneaker news was provided some informationregarding a third colorway of the nike air yeezy 2, but it appears that for now, just two colorways will release – theblack/solar red, which has been on kanye’s feet over the last few months, and thewolf grey/pure platinum, commonly referred to as the ‘zen grey’.
the news is that the rumored date of march is no longer true.

it's a clean sneaker, gold tip laces and very casual.
so there is more talk/commotion on the  sneakers which makes more hype!
hopefully all the bum ass resellers get  into some freak accident so they won't ruin the chance for the actually people  who wants to wear them!
blame the game on "hypebeast" & resellers.

people get upset when they aren't able to get a pair of kicks that are  highly sought after or hyped up!
many thanks to jack for the info.
blame the game on "hypebeast" &  resellers.
blame yourself, for knowing that the shoe is qs or hard to get, knowing that people are going to be camped out, & knowing that there are resellers… wtf

@ofcoursejamal says: march 5th, 2012 at 12:36 pm most anticipated!
if you want the most up-to-date information regarding the nike air  yeezy 2 release, you know where to keep in tuned, so let us know which of the  two confirmed colorways you’d prefer to have, and stick with sneaker news  for more updates.
another significant piece  of information is that the rumored release of march 23rd is looking to be  unlikely, with the release rumored to be pushed back to a later date (but not  far after).
pm cool @emkae says: march 5th, 2012 at 12:51 pm

if it isn't a gr, there will be a loss of life over these.
