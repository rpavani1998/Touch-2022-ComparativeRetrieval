advancing the college through investment in digital fabrication equipment will have a profound impact on the quality of student and professional work.tiffany keys symbolize unity, love, faithfulness, devotion, and much more.tools such as wire benders, fabric cutters, and a programmable stop gauge would help to fulfill the need for accurate material shaping in media that we cannot currently accurately control.the digital equipment that has already been introduced to the cbe shops in the last two years has allowed students to try new techniques that would have otherwise been unreachable for us, and expanding the equipment options will help us even more.all would significantly enhance the student educational experience in our college.availability of this equipment would significantly enhance the uw's existing reputation for furniture design, prototype/model work, and production - helping students become more marketable, expanding opportunities for interdisciplinary work with other departments and outside entities, and attracting ambitious and talented students wanting to work with a wide array of fabrication and production tools.we have been able to provide training to hundreds of students, who enjoy unfettered access to our tools.as such techniques and materials have become common in the design and construction disciplines, this experience will prove invaluable.the nearly 300 students using the shops each year will benefit from many opportunities afforded by the availability of the proposed equipment, among which are: - exploration of precision production processes, which are increasingly important in the professional world as efficient, resource-responsible production becomes more critical.effective representation of and interaction with visual and graphic information, as well as interactive process modeling, the acquisition and analysis of data in the field and the straightforward production of physical prototypes from digital models, have become key to the design and construction of our shared built environment.such devices are widely used in industry to efficiently produce sets of identical building parts; a deep understanding of their integration into the production process would help students be more effective both in the shops and in situations like internships in the field.gaining a better understanding of how spaces and volumes function allows us as designers to not only evaluate the existing but to design better for the future.tools such as the proposed laser measuring device allow us to learn from the world within which we live.access to digital-design & downstream digital fabrication resources assists many of our students in experiencing an alternate form of design practice that is at once compelling, timely, and competitive.advanced machine-specific training is available to enable students to take advantage of more complex functions and capacities.
