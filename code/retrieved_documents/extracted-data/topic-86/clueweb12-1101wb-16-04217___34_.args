rent may be an illegitimate source of income, but it is a totally legitimate and necessary price, without which efficient allocation of scarce resources would be impossible.success will be measured by the ability to provide a high quality of life and attract people to live there.there is an opportunity right now to make a lot of money bringing the economy into harmony with the biosphere and growing them together.once you are able to do that, you heal the land and create economic growth.landlord rent is unearned income, and we find income based on ownership of that which no one produced to be ethically distasteful.the economy grows as ecological health grows.people that are in a position to do this through technological innovation are in a position to make a lot of money.no one can predict the future, we can look at the present and the past and try to rectify our mistakes and move on.i am a middle aged man, i make a very decent living and i would consider myself at the top of the consumer chain.the economy is designed to grow, just like biological life is designed to evolve and diversify and spread out.rehabilitating those rain forest and retrofitting existing infrastucture to be 'greener' is more akin to 'healing' the environment.while predictions and record-keeping can be interesting, and can even serve an important purpose by highlighting the past inaccuracies of someone offering a new prediction, i'm more interested in the methodology of prediction.and our unconscious minds are fantastic at avoiding any sense of self-blame for anything that is going wrong in our world.the economy can keep growing in a qualitative manner versus a quantitative manner.it would take a lot of sacrifice, quantitatively and qualitatively, sacrifice people aren't prepared for and aren't prepared to make unless they have to.
