@audeblu says: march 5th, 2012 at 2:09 pm i'll have no chance at getting these….. resellers are camping out right now!!
if they were smart, they'd just make it a gr for a short time and be done with it.
thats alot of money in your pocket if you get the chance to.
but im not gonna camp a whole week for this craps……….. most def the black and pink didn't cop the first ones, not gunna cop these either, but in my opinion i think these look better….
hype kills says: march 5th, 2012 at 1:51 pm but it doesnt matter to me because i cant afford these no way.
i saw these same shoes on a site for like 89.99 and i will be copping them quick!!!
i guess hype does that to people… to me they look alrite, i just don't like how the upper and the toe box look with the all mesh.
i think da yeezy 1s were better, but dat wolf grey & platinum pair is dope… but i.hope people dat want these get them.
2 just 2 wtf what happen to 5 man this is just gonna make things more out of hand i really hope if they only doing 2 they make a good amount still limited but enough for most to cop $225 i believe

this past friday, sneaker news was provided some informationregarding a third colorway of the nike air yeezy 2, but it appears that for now, just two colorways will release – theblack/solar red, which has been on kanye’s feet over the last few months, and thewolf grey/pure platinum, commonly referred to as the ‘zen grey’.
the news is that the rumored date of march is no longer true.
well what i meant to say actually was that, i actually saw these on cnn.
now as the release date approaches, everyones saying how nice they are….
sneaker news readers voted the nike air yeezy 2 as the most anticipated sneaker release of 2012 in our year-endsneaker news reader’s choice poll, beating out the two blockbuster air jordan retros by significant margins.
ay2 going to retail 230+tax blinks, without a doubt ya niggaz need to hurry up and drop em shit takin foreva ya slackin buy 1 pair to stuff up my ass, one to ball , in a one to store i remember wen they first showed pictures of these last year, everyone was commenting how much they hated them and that they looked ugly as hell.
hopefully all the bum ass resellers get into some freak accident so they won't ruin the chance for the actually people who wants to wear them!

the first yeezy's looked better and not by that much.

it's a clean sneaker, gold tip laces and very casual.
so there is more talk/commotion on the sneakers which makes more hype!

blame the game on "hypebeast" & resellers.

of course but then again its worth the buy if you like supra's and things like that.
people get upset when they aren't able to get a pair of kicks that are highly sought after or hyped up!

if you want the most up-to-date information regarding the nike air yeezy 2 release, you know where to keep in tuned, so let us know which of the two confirmed colorways you’d prefer to have, and stick with sneaker news for more updates.
if it isn't a gr, there will be a loss of life over these.
