we may achieve greater success in reducing incidence of at least some types of cancer by advances in gene therapy, than by modifications of diet, exercise, and behavior.a palaeolithic diet improves glucose tolerance more than a mediterranean-like diet in individuals with ischaemic heart disease.children are helpless for the first decade of life, so the survival of genes is dependent on there being a large support network to ensure the survival of children, even if their parents die.â€” iron-deficiency anemia can be protective against dysentery, as high levels of transferrin sequester iron and make it unavailable to bacteria.for most of human existence, and in some places to this very day, human beings have faced periodic severe food shortages, permanently stunting growth and creating additional health problems.of course, there are psychiatrists and psychologists who create dependence in their patients as well or simply prescribe pills inappropriately (as unethical as that is) and not all mds are capable of providing or arranging the kind of support someone may be seeking or need (due to lack of interpersonal skills, training in psychology or simply time).that would mean that the paleolithic diet was good for preventing heart disease and type ii diabetes.they are still prey to the same illnesses and accidents, but now they can be effectively treated.for instance, african americans are vulnerable to sickle cell anemia and sensitivity to salt and are prone to hypertension.the dramatic improvement in longevity must, to a great extent, be attributed to improvement in diet, improvement in employment conditions, social benefits and other benefits not related in medical intervention.to make a recommendation for a patient based on scientific evidence requires a rigorous approach by the professional doctor to evaluate scientific evidence.ischemic heart disease or cancer can occur in a patient who is 75 who has eaten the healthiest diet, followed the best exercise regimen, minimized stress, etc.since children with genetic defects tend to die very early, and since childbearing is associated with a high risk of death, it makes biologic sense for ovulation to wind down when the quality of ova diminishes.furthermore, research shows that as these people transition to the western diet (like native pacific islanders), they have extremely high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.in times of war and famine, children who are with their mothers are less vulnerable to malnutrition than are children who are with aunts, grandmothers, fathers, stepmothers or some random stranger.
