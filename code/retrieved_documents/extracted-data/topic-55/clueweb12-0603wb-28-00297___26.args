for dichotomous outcomes, logistic regression was used, with adjustment for base-line values whenever available.29 for all comparisons of the three treatment groups a p value of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, and sidak's method for pairwise comparisons was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.30 all p values were two-tailed.

for dichotomous outcomes, logistic regression was used, with adjustment for base-line values whenever available.29 for all comparisons of the three treatment groups a p value of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance, and sidak's method for pairwise comparisons was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.30 all p values were two-tailed.

the scores on this scale are based on the answers to 23 yes–no questions about daily activities and can range from 0 (none of the 23 daily activities limited by back pain) to 23 (all 23 activities limited by back pain).
we found that patients who received chiropractic manipulation or physical therapy had only marginally better outcomes than those who received only an educational booklet.
for all outcomes, there were no significant differences between the physical-therapy and chiropractic groups and no significant differences among the groups in the numbers of days of reduced activity or missed work or in recurrences of back pain.
a minimal-intervention control group received an educational booklet to minimize potential disappointment with not receiving a physical treatment.
the overall costs of care for back pain were lowest in the booklet group, so there was no evidence that the higher initial costs of the physical treatments were offset by later savings.
among other rigorous studies comparing chiropractic and physical therapy, a british study concluded that chiropractic was more beneficial,11,12 whereas a swedish study found no significant differences in outcomes or costs.14
an exercise sheet was used that emphasized stretching and strengthening but excluded extension exercises, an important part of mckenzie therapy.
fewer than 2 percent of the subjects reported using corsets, braces, traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or injections.
full text of background and methods... after adjustment for base-line differences, the chiropractic group had less severe symptoms than the booklet group at four weeks (p=0.02), and there was a trend toward less severe symptoms in the physical-therapy group (p=0.06).
this instrument is reliable, valid, and sensitive,24,27 and the questions are easily administered by telephone.
the relative costs of chiropractic and mckenzie treatments could differ in other settings.
at base line and at all follow-up visits, subjects rated how “bothersome” back pain, leg pain, and numbness or tingling had been during the preceding 24 hours.
given the limited benefits and high costs, it seems unwise to refer all patients with low back pain for chiropractic or mckenzie therapy.
however, these differences were small and not significant after transformations of the data to adjust for their non-normal distribution.
general health was evaluated with the general health perceptions and mental health subscales of the medical outcomes study short-form health survey (sf-36).17,18 the score on each of the subscales ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).

in addition, 54 percent underwent sacral or sacroiliac manipulation, 27 percent thoracic manipulation, 12 percent cervical manipulation, and 6 percent manipulation of the hip, pelvis, or ischium.
the marginally better outcome of the physical treatments raises the possibility that effects were nonspecific.
the roland disability and bothersomeness-of-symptoms scores were analyzed as continuous variables by analysis of covariance after adjustment for base-line values.29 a common set of base-line variables predictive of these scores was included in all analyses of covariance (age, age squared, sf-36 mental health score, sf-36 general health perceptions score, previous physical therapy, and subjects'
exercise therapy for low back pain.
a previous trial found that the use of this booklet as a supplement to standard care was not associated with improved outcomes, even though subjects considered the booklet useful.23 outcome measures because back pain often recurs, both short-term outcome (1, 4, and 12 weeks) and long-term outcome (1 to 2 years) were assessed.
a dutch study found that manual therapy (manipulation and mobilization) and physiotherapy (exercise, massage, and physical-therapy methods) had similar effects and were superior to continued treatment by a general practitioner.32
thus, out-of-pocket expenses for patients are not included.
after square-root transformation to adjust for the non-normal distribution of the outcome measures, the differences among the treatment groups were no longer significant at 4 weeks (p=0.14) or 12 weeks (p=0.19).

there were no significant differences among the chiropractors or the therapists with respect to their effect on the subjects' symptoms (e.g., p=0.71 and p=0.22, respectively, at four weeks) or function (e.g., p=0.51 and p=0.30, respectively).
the study paid for the costs of the study treatments.
although most of the higher costs in the chiropractic and physical-therapy groups were attributable to the treatments themselves (table 2 and table 4), the cost of other hmo services for low back pain was also lower in the booklet group than in the other two groups.
psychometric and clinical tests of validity in measuring physical and mental health constructs.
all 66 subjects in the booklet group were mailed a $1 booklet (table 2table 2mean costs of the treatments.).

the relative costs of chiropractic and mckenzie treatments could differ in other settings.
for example, during the second year, 24 percent of the subjects in the booklet group reported visits to any provider for back pain, as compared with 29 percent of the subjects in the chiropractic group and 20 percent of the subjects in the physical-therapy group (p=0.29).
health economic evaluation in complementary medicine.
the bothersomeness of symptoms was measured on an 11-point scale, and the level of dysfunction was measured on the 24-point roland disability scale.
subjects were excluded if they had mild or no pain seven days after the visit to the physician, a history of back surgery, sciatica, systemic or visceral causes of the pain, osteoporosis, a vertebral fracture or dislocation, severe neurologic signs, spondylolisthesis, coagulation disorders, or a severe concurrent illness.
according to the subjects' reports, the total amount of time spent with the provider was virtually identical in the two groups (about 145 minutes).

the typical subject was approximately 40 years old, white, well educated, and employed (table 1table 1base-line characteristics of the subjects.).
physical therapy was provided in a facility adjacent to these clinics, and spinal manipulation was performed by four chiropractors in solo practice.
thus, 66 were assigned to receive the booklet, 122 to chiropractic, and 133 to physical therapy.
the assessment of short-term outcome focused on the effects of the assigned treatment on symptoms, the level of function, and the level of disability; the assessment of long-term outcomes focused on recurrences of low back pain and the use of back-related health care.
other treatments included ice packs (20 percent), brief localized massage (49 percent), and exercises in the office (41 percent) or at home (58 percent).

however, about one quarter of the subjects in the booklet group failed to answer this question, possibly because only 18 percent received care during this period.
the difference in the bothersomeness of symptoms was not significant after data transformation to compensate for the skewed distribution of scores.
the roland disability and bothersomeness-of-symptoms scores were analyzed as continuous variables by analysis of covariance after adjustment for base-line values.29 a common set of base-line variables predictive of these scores was included in all analyses of covariance (age, age squared, sf-36 mental health score, sf-36 general health perceptions score, previous physical therapy, and subjects' expectations of the likelihood of improvement).
