based on the pioneering studies by dr. jay shah and colleagues at the national institutes of health, we know that inserting a needle into trigger points can cause favorable biochemical changes, which assist in reducing pain.in the us, imt is a relatively new method for treating myofascial pain and not everyone is already aware of this effective modality.the treatment of muscles has the greatest effect on reducing pain mechanisms in the nervous system.if the pain comes back, "tune-ups" are recommended to treat and prevent serious injuries.such conditions include, but are not limited to neck, back and shoulder pain, arm pain (tennis elbow, carpal tunnel, golfer's elbow), headache to include migraines and tension-type headaches, jaw pain, buttock pain and leg pain (sciatica, hamstrings strains, calf tightness/spasms).the musculoskeletal system is under constant pressure from gravity, stress, work etc.muscles are thought to be a primary contributing factor to the symptoms.getting local twitch responses with imt is the first step in breaking the pain cycle.again, the therapeutic response occurs with the elicitation of local twitch responses and that is a good and desirable reaction.a regular exercise program combined with good posture can prevent many problems.a myofascial trigger point consists of multiple contraction knots, which are related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle.it is essential to elicit so-called local twitch responses, which are spinal cord reflexes.imt is a western medical technique that is based on scientific studies and knowledge.imt is the first step in breaking the pain cycle.again, we are trying to cause mechanical and biochemical changes without any pharmacological means.
