we utilize this intervention for support and pain relief for post-operative conditions, acute injury, back pain, during pregnancy, with children and adolescents, scoliosis, for postural support, sacroiliac (si) dysfunction and many other conditions.
this method basically stems from the science of kinesiology, hence the name "kinesio".
the elastic properties of this tape help in many ways: as a part of physical therapy, kinesio taping is best used as an adjunct to therapy and exercise.
kinesio taping alleviates pain and facilitates lymphatic drainage by lifting the skin.
it is an adjunct to our manual therapy, neuromuscular re-education, therapeutic exercise and modalities to return people to pain-free living without surgery or medication.
this kinesio taping exhibits its efficacy through the activation of neurological and circulatory systems.
slowly pressure is taken off the lymphatic system allowing it to drain more freely.
employment of kinesio taping creates a totally new approach to treating nerves, muscles, and organs.
this method basically stems from the science of kinesiology, hence the name "kinesio".
examples include: muscular facilitation or inhibition in pediatric patients, carpal tunnel syndrome, lower back strain/pain (subluxations, herniated disc), knee conditions, shoulder conditions, hamstring, groin injury, rotator cuff injury, whiplash, tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, patella tracking, pre and post surgical edema, ankle sprains, athletic preventative injury method, and as a support method.
kinesio tape can be best used in conjunction with physical therapy treatments.
the result is that pressure and irritation are taken off the neural/sensory receptors.
a good physical therapy program goes hand-in-hand with good taping.
the method and tape allow the individual to wear and receive the therapeutic benefits on a 24-hours/day basis, and can be worn for several days per application.
it is an adjunct to our manual therapy, neuromuscular re-education, therapeutic exercise and modalities to return people to pain-free living without surgery or medication.
it can dramatically speed the rehabilitation process by lessening pain and improving tolerance to exercise and movement.
for instance, the clinician must know if the patient needs taping to assist muscle strengthening or to assist muscle relaxation, as the taping will be different.
elastic tape is water resistant, durable and easy to wear, usually 3-5 days, latex free and generally very well tolerated.

patient satisfaction survey kinesio taping kinesio taping is a method used to help normalize the function of muscles and other connective tissues.
the first technique gives the practitioner the opportunity to actually give support with full range of motion that enables the individual to participate in physical activity with functional assistance.
it can dramatically speed the rehabilitation process by lessening pain and improving tolerance to exercise and movement.
elastic tape is water resistant, durable and easy to wear, usually 3-5 days, latex free and generally very well tolerated.
the success of kinesio taping strongly depends on clinician knowledge.
the method and tape allow the individual to wear and receive the therapeutic benefits on a 24-hours/day basis, and can be worn for several days per application.
the taped portion forms convolutions in the skin this increasing interstitial space.
kinesio tape facilitates normal motion, decreases edema, improves pain and facilitates biomechanical alignment.
muscles are not only attributed to the movements of the body but also control the circulation of venous and lymph flows, body temperature, etc.
using an elastic tape, it was discovered that muscles and other tissues could be helped by outside assistance.
we utilize this intervention for support and pain relief for post-operative conditions, acute injury, back pain, during pregnancy, with children and adolescents, scoliosis, for postural support, sacroiliac (si) dysfunction and many other conditions.
the second technique helps fight against overuse/contraction and helps provide 24 hours/day facilitation of lymphatic fluid.
elastic taping is not just for athletes.
therefore, the failure of the muscles to function properly induces various kinds of symptoms.
the elastic properties of this tape help in many ways: improve contraction of a weakened muscle reduce muscle fatigue and spasm reduce over-stretching and over-contraction of muscles re-educate muscles through sensory feedback lessen edema (swelling) through aiding the lymphatic system minimize post-traumatic or post-surgical bruising through improved circulation help mobilize scar tissue by enhancing glide between tissue layers help correct joint mechanics through aiding muscle function around the joint relieve pain by activating the natural analgesic system in our skin receptors as a part of physical therapy, kinesio taping is best used as an adjunct to therapy and exercise.
the first technique gives the practitioner the opportunity to actually give support with full range of motion that enables the individual to participate in physical activity with functional assistance.
consequently, so much attention was given to the importance of muscle function that the idea of treating the muscles in order to activate the body's own healing process came about.
the result is that pressure and irritation are taken off the neural/sensory receptors.
this kinesio taping exhibits its efficacy through the activation of neurological and circulatory systems.
kinesio taping alleviates pain and facilitates lymphatic drainage by lifting the skin.
kinesio tape facilitates normal motion, decreases edema, improves pain and facilitates biomechanical alignment.
lastly, there are many types of correctional techniques such as: myofascial, lymph, and tracking (i.e., patella [knee cap])
muscles are not only attributed to the movements of the body but also control the circulation of venous and lymph flows, body temperature, etc.
employment of kinesio taping creates a totally new approach to treating nerves, muscles, and organs.
we may use taping as a part of your therapy, and also offer tape for your ongoing use at home.

kinesio tape is used for anything from headaches to foot problems and everything in between.
