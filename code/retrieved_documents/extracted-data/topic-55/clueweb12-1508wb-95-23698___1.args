this study used only massage techniques that were limited to manipulation of the soft tissues (the muscles and fascia that surround the muscles) (cherkin, 2001).
it found that therapeutic massage was effective for persistent low back pain in terms of improvement of symptoms and function and that it provided long-lasting benefits.
in a randomized controlled clinical trial of patients with chronic and subchronic low back pain (back pain for at least three weeks but less than six months), osteopathic manual care was compared to standard medical care.
it sees the musculoskeletal system as a unified structure that needs all parts functioning well for there to be proper physiology and a chance for an absence of pain.
the focus of chiropractic care is on the nervous system with adjustments of the spinal vertebra to improve joint, nerve and muscle function.
however the osteopathic treatment group receiving manual care required significantly less medication (analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents and muscle relaxants) and used less physical therapy (andersson, 1999).
in a 1997 systematic review, strong evidence was found that spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain was better than placebo treatment and moderate evidence that it was better than treatment by a general practitioner, massage, bed rest and analgesics (van tulder, 1997)
to date, the data from scientific trials on the effectiveness of manipulation for acute back pain show it to be an effective therapy (shekelle, 1992).

studies also suggest that when improvement occurs it is usually early in the course of treatment (after 6 treatments) so that if there is no improvement in symptoms by that point, manipulative intervention may be ineffective in that case (berman, 1998).

both types of treatment had similar clinical results in terms of pain relief, function and satisfaction in patients with subacute low back pain.
a recent randomized study compared the effectiveness of acupuncture, therapeutic massage and self-care education for chronic low back pain.
in a systematic review of 81 trials of manipulation for chronic low back pain, however, 25% were high quality studies showing strong evidence that manipulation was effective, especially for specific structural conditions.
these therapeutic approaches therefore emphasize treatment of low back pain not just of the low back, but of the spine as a whole.
massage therapy was found to be effective in reducing pain, stress hormones, and symptoms associated with chronic low back pain (hernandez-reif, 2001).
high quality studies showing strong evidence that manipulation was effective, especially for specific structural conditions.
in a randomized study comparing massage therapy and progressive muscle relaxation for chronic low back pain, the massage therapy group reported experiencing less pain, depression, anxiety, improved sleep, improved trunk and pain flexion performance and higher levels of serotonin and dopamine.
thus, despite the need for more high quality research studies to evaluate massage as a main treatment option, it would seem reasonable to include massage in a multi-modal treatment approach for certain types of chronic low back pain conditions.
studies that confine manipulative therapies only to the low back and restrict use in other areas as part of the treatment regimen (as is common practice) may be less likely to show benefit.
