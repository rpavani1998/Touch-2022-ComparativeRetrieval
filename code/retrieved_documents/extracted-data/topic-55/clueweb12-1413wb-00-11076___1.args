in a very sophisticated analysis of cost effectiveness the study “shows consistently that both manipulation alone and manipulation followed by exercise provide cost-effective additions to care in general practice.”
they are also the second most costly health care problem 3.
exercise alone significantly improved only function/disability, and only up to the 3 month follow-up.
the experimental group received forceful spinal manipulations and injections of a proliferant solution to reduce pain.
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic management of low back pain.
in utah, jarvis reported patients with back injuries took 10x the number of days off work (20.7 vs 2.4) and used 10x the compensation costs ($668 vs $68) when they chose medical care vs chiropractic care.
(ironically, after commissioning these studies, six years later, in a budget crisis, the ontario government dropped chiropractic care from its public health insurance program (ohip) using the savings for increased hip and knee surgeries and the construction of more mri and ct scanners.)
while both the medical and chiropractic groups improved in pain and function as compared to the sham group, only the chiropractic group improved significantly.

the research supported safety and appropriateness of spinal manipulation for all these conditions.
meade reported that chiropractic care demonstrated significantly better long-term benefit that started soon after the onset of care.
while both the medical and chiropractic groups improved in pain and function as compared to the sham group, only the chiropractic group improved significantly.
the results showed manipulation was a significantly better treatment on all measurement scales than general medical care, through the full year of the trial.
exercise alone significantly improved only function/disability, and only up to the 3 month follow-up.

low back pain of mechanical origin: randomized comparison of chiropractic and hospital outpatient treatment.
in summary, about 90% of chiropractic practice is supported by scientific evidence at the most rigorous randomized control trial level.
patient satisfaction he made a strong recommendation for the ontario government to utilize chiropractors in the treatment of low back pain patients.
here’s what the researchers found: spinal manipulation is effective in adults for: • acute, subacute and chronic low back pain • migraine and cervicogenic headache • cervicogenic dizziness • acute, subacute and chronic neck pain • several extremity joint conditions there is inconclusive but favourable evidence for chiropractic management of other musculoskeletal conditions: • ankle sprains • sciatica •
doubling the proportion of patients who visit chiropractors from 10% to (only) 20% would save the government $348 million per year in direct costs and $1.85 billion in indirect costs.

exercise combined with manipulation showed similar results to manipulation alone.

also, “that the incidence of serious side effects such as a stroke following chiropractic care is extremely rare and is probably not related to manipulation in most patients but due to the fact that patients develop neck pain or headaches as a result of a dissection of a vertebral artery that progresses through the natural history of dissection to stroke irrespective of the clinician the patient consults”.
in this randomized, controlled format, treatment outcomes were measured by pain and disability questionnaires, straight leg raise and lumbar flexion, and patients were tracked for 2 years.
medical patients were also 10x more likely to develop chronic low back pain (11.6% vs 1.9%).
the results showed manipulation was a significantly better treatment on all measurement scales than general medical care, through the full year of the trial.
it was a large (741 subjects) and meticulous study comparing treatment outcomes at hospital outpatient clinics and chiropractic clinics.

thus both subjective and objective measures supported chiropractic treatment.
his summary points are emphatic: as compared to medical and physiotherapy treatment in ontario, chiropractic care is significantly better in, 1.

it also noted there was significantly less lost time at work in the chiropractic group.
coccydynia • tmj disorders • tension headache • fibromyalgia • etc … and non-musculoskeletal conditions: • pre-menstrual syndrome • pneumonia in older adults • nocturnal eneuresis in children • hypertension • otitis media (ear infections) in children • etc spinal manipulation was not any more effective than sham manipulation for: • asthma • colic/incessant crying in children
they looked at general medical care, exercise classes, manipulation or a combination of the latter two as the treatments.
the patients receiving chiropractic adjustments showed a significant improvement in pain relief and objective measures of spinal mobility as compared to the sham group.

a prospective short and long term comparative trial of general medical practice care, chiropractic manipulation therapy and sham manipulation in the management of chronic low back pain.
subjects were evaluated for effectiveness of the treatment at onset, one, 3 and 6 month intervals using pain and disability scales and objective evaluation of physical signs.
doubling the proportion of patients who visit chiropractors from 10% to (only) 20% would save the government $348 million per year in direct costs and $1.85 billion in indirect costs.
meade also reported that the greatest benefit in the chiropractic group was with the chronic and severe low back pain patients.
