a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy can help reduce chronic back pain, or at least enhance the patient's ability to deal with it.a combined therapy approach, including antidepressant therapy and pain self-management program has been shown to improve depression symptoms and reduce the severity of pain and disability.acupuncture has not shown any benefits for acute low back pain in most patients, but it may provide some help for patients with chronic low back pain.combined chiropractic interventions (such as spinal manipulation, massage, electrotherapies, and exercise programs) may provide slight, short-term improvements in pain and disability.in this way, the positive benefits of exercise not only affect strength and flexibility but also alter and improve patients' attitudes toward their disability and pain.antidepressants called tricyclics may be effective painkillers in non-depressed people with chronic back pain.in general, surgery has been found to provide better short term and possibly quicker relief for selected patients when compared to non-surgical treatment.massage therapy can help some patients with chronic or acute back pain, especially when combined with exercise and patient education.a possible benefit of these artificial disks is that they would allow more movement of the spine, and therefore prevent disk degeneration below and above the site of surgery (a frequent complication of spinal fusion).when tested in high-quality studies, these electrical nerve stimulation techniques have not been found to provide much help for chronic low back pain.specific and regular exercise under the guidance of a trained professional is important for reducing pain and improving function, although patients often find it difficult to maintain therapy.depression and a tendency to develop physical complaints in response to stress also increase the likelihood that acute back pain will become a chronic condition.the technique may be useful for early detection of spinal fractures, cancer that has spread to the bone, or certain inflammatory arthritic conditions.surgery can be an extremely effective approach, however, for certain patients whose severe back pain does not respond to conservative measures.graded exercise programs, general exercise treatment (daily walks), and home and workplace interventions may improve pain and function for up to 12 months in patients with chronic low back pain.
