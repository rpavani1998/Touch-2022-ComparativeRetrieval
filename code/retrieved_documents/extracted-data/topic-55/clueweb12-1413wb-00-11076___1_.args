the patients receiving chiropractic adjustments showed a significant improvement in pain relief and objective measures of spinal mobility as compared to the sham group.doubling the proportion of patients who visit chiropractors from 10% to (only) 20% would save the government $348 million per year in direct costs and $1.85 billion in indirect costs.in summary, about 90% of chiropractic practice is supported by scientific evidence at the most rigorous randomized control trial level.here’s what the researchers found: spinal manipulation is effective in adults for: • acute, subacute and chronic low back pain • migraine and cervicogenic headache • acute, subacute and chronic neck pain • several extremity joint conditions there is inconclusive but favourable evidence for chiropractic management of other musculoskeletal conditions: • ankle sprainsenhanced chiropractic coverage under ohip as a means of reducing health care costs, attaining better health outcomes and improving the public’s access to cost-effective health services.the research supported safety and appropriateness of spinal manipulation for all these conditions.medical patients were also 10x more likely to develop chronic low back pain (11.6% vs 1.9%).in this randomized, controlled format, treatment outcomes were measured by pain and disability questionnaires, straight leg raise and lumbar flexion, and patients were tracked for 2 years.while both the medical and chiropractic groups improved in pain and function as compared to the sham group, only the chiropractic group improved significantly.subjects were evaluated for effectiveness of the treatment at onset, one, 3 and 6 month intervals using pain and disability scales and objective evaluation of physical signs.here’s what the researchers found: spinal manipulation is effective in adults for: • acute, subacute and chronic low back pain • migraine and cervicogenic headache • cervicogenic dizziness • acute, subacute and chronic neck pain • several extremity joint conditions there is inconclusive but favourable evidence for chiropractic management of other musculoskeletal conditions: • ankle sprains • sciatica •meade reported that chiropractic care demonstrated significantly better long-term benefit that started soon after the onset of care.these mds concluded manipulation is “a safe and effective treatment”.he estimated the savings of “hundreds of millions” of dollars annually if the treatment of back pain was transferred from mds to chiropractors.in a very sophisticated analysis of cost effectiveness the study “shows consistently that both manipulation alone and manipulation followed by exercise provide cost-effective additions to care in general practice.”
