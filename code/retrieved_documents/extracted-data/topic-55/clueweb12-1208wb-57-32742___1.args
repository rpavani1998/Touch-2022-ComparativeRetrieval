sometimes you will not feel improvement for a number of treatments.
in clinical studies patients receiving laser therapy have experienced a significant reduction in pain.

high power laser therapy has already helped thousands of people get long-term relief without drugs, needles, side effects, pain or surgery.
st. tereiza physical therapy has had great success at treating all of the previously mentioned pains.
more chronic problems respond better when treatments are received 2 to 3 times per week tapering to once a week or once every other week, with improvement.
these effects include improved healing time, pain reduction, increased circulation and decreased swelling.
if a patient is allergic to light then they may get a rash or blister for a few days.
patient satisfaction survey laser therapy high power laser therapy has already helped thousands of people get long-term relief without drugs, needles, side effects, pain or surgery.
laser light therapy has shown promising results and only takes a couple sessions to feel the difference!
occasionally some old injuries or pain syndromes may feel aggravated for a few days, as the healing response is more active after treatment.
the laser light directs biostimulative energy to the body's injured cells in a specific location where the cells transform this energy into chemical energy promoting natural healing and pain relief through tissue repair.
conditions such as severe arthritis may require ongoing periodic care to control pain.
in fact, a recent review of over 2500 articles in the medical literature indicated that many acute and chronic conditions may be improved or eliminated with therapeutic lasers.
each treatment is cumulative and results are often felt after 3 or 4 sessions.
you may feel improvement in your condition (usually pain reduction) after the very first treatment.
the light may be provided by a low-power laser or led (light emitting diode).
laser light therapy is used by st. tereiza physical therapy as an effective treatment for numerous acute and chronic pain.
for some acute conditions 1-6 treatments may be sufficient.
these effects include improved healing time, pain reduction, increased circulation and decreased swelling.
those of a more chronic nature may require 10-15 (or more) treatments.
low level lasers send cold light through skin layers to soft tissue cells to stimulate blood flow and cell metabolism.
other healing modalities are complementary and can be used with laser to increase the effectiveness of the treatment.
