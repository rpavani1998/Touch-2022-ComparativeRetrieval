radiological examination reveals degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, particularly at l4-l5.
however there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that it achieves better outcomes than standard care.
a clinical prediction rule to identify patients with low back pain most likely to benefit from spinal manipulation: a validation study.
enjoy… commentary by brian liem, msiv a 52 year old male with no medical problems presents to your clinic with a 10 year history of chronic intermittent back pain.
at three months post-treatment, those patients who were given the additional spinal manipulation had improved roland morris disability scores.4 at twelve months there continued to be improvements, although less dramatic.
however, in a meta-analysis of 39 randomized control trials comparing spinal manipulation to commonly used, but not necessarily proven, therapies (i.e.: analgesics, back school (diathermy), physical therapy, light massage, bed rest, topical gels, corsets), spinal manipulative therapy was found only to be superior to sham therapy or therapies judged to be ineffective or even harmful.5 researchers found no evidence that spinal manipulation was more effective than standard treatments for low back pain.

it didn’t seem biased against chiropractic, yet seemed to present the facts and research.

from a chiropractor’s perspective, low back pain is a function of restricted movement in the spine.
in a study of 681 low back pain patients at ucla, receiving either chiropractic or medical care, it was found that compared with medical care-only patients, chiropractic patients were much more likely to perceive improvements in their low back symptoms.6 this study, however, found that at 18 months post treatment, there was no statistically significant reduction in clinical outcomes, as measured by pain score and disability, between the two groups.

one randomized control study in uk of 1334 patients compared treatment of low back pain with “best care” in general practice to spinal manipulation added to “best care.”

a clinical prediction rule to identify patients with low back pain most likely to benefit from spinal manipulation: a validation study.
there are actually some really good studies that have been conducted by british medical journal and the journal of manipulative and physiologic therapeutics that have suggested chiropractic therapy was more effective with exercises at providing substantial long-term relief.
despite the above meta-analysis findings, patients may still believe that they achieve greater relief from chiropractic interventions than from standard medical treatment.
physician office visits for low back pain.
a review of the evidence for the effectiveness, safety, and cost of acupuncture, massage therapy, and spinal manipulation for back pain.
class act will feature posts written by nyu 3rd and 4th year medical students.
taking the above studies together, at this time chiropractic care can be considered a safe and moderately effective treatment of low back pain.
