(2008) analgesic effects of treatments for non-specific low back pain: a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials.
we randomly assigned 321 adults with low back pain that persisted for seven days after a primary care visit to the mckenzie method of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation, or a minimal intervention (provision of an educational booklet).
the initial visit was scheduled  within four days after randomization, and up to eight additional visits were  scheduled, at the discretion of the chiropractor, over the ensuing month.
after square-root transformation to adjust for the non-normal distribution of the outcome measures, the differences among the treatment groups were no longer significant at 4 weeks (p=0.14) or 12 weeks (p=0.19).

in the mckenzie approach, patients are placed in one of three broad  categories (derangement, dysfunction, and postural syndrome) that determine  therapy.19,20 in this formulation, most back, buttock, and leg pain is thought  to result from a “derangement syndrome,” treated by exercises that  “centralize” pain from the feet, legs, or buttocks to the lower  back.21 patients are taught to perform exercises that centralize their symptoms  and to avoid movements that peripheralize them.
