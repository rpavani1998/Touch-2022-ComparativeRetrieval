chiropractic was found to be more effective, especially for those with "short current episodes, a history of back pain, and initially high [pain scale] scores."
after six months of follow-up, the conventional medical care and chiropractic regimens were found to be comparably effective.
time to recovery was "essentially the same," regardless of who provided the care.
other chiropractic research on back pain focused just on adults with the condition.
participants were randomized to receive either chiropractic or hospital-outpatient management.
patients received chiropractic manipulation, physical therapy (pt), or a booklet on self-managing back pain.

enrollees (174) were measured for low back pain, disability, and functional health status at 5 and 11 weeks.
enrollees (174) were measured for low back pain, disability, and functional health status at 5 and 11 weeks.
participants (652) hadacute , subacute , or chronic low back pain with or without leg pain.
authors noted that further trials are needed, for example, on specific components of chiropractic care.
pope et al., 1994 prospective rct compared chiropractic spinal manipulation for treatment ofsubacute low back pain to massage, use of a corset, and tms (electrical muscle stimulation).
other chiropractic research on back pain focused just on adults with the condition.
pain relief continued to end after the evaluation period.
patients (164) were treated for three weeks and evaluated through various standardized instruments and examinations.
participants (1,633) had acute pain of less than 10 weeks' duration.
participants (170) hadlow back pain (lasting seven weeks or longer or consisting of at least six episodes in 12 months) and were evaluated for pain and activity tolerance at enrollment, after two weeks of treatment, and after two weeks of no treatment.
the manipulation group had the most improvement in flexion and pain.
however, authors concluded overall that none of the changes in physical outcomes measured was significantly different between groups.
the outcomes for those who received manipulation or pt were better than those who received the booklet, but "only marginally better."
back pain intensity and back-related disability were measured.

participants (178) had lbp for either longer than three weeks but less than six months in a current episode or more than two months within the preceding eight months for recurrent lbp, and were evaluated three weeks and six months after treatment.
