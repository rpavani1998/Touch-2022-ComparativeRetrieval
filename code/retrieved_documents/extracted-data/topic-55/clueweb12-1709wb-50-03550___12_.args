neurological physical therapy works to restore balance, coordination, and motor function through repeated exercises for patients with spinal injury, parkinson's disease, alzheimer's disease, and other brain and nerve disorders.cardiopulmonary physical therapy treats lung and heart conditions, such as cerebral palsy, asthma, and post-heart attack rehabilitation, by clearing the lungs of mucus, ventilating the lungs to ease breathing, or exercising to increase a patient's ability to move.there is emerging evidence that physical therapy may be beneficial for reducing the time to heal following whiplash injury.physical therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for dysfunctional voiding in children.there may be a beneficial effect of respiratory rehabilitation in terms of improved tolerance to exercise and improved quality of life for copd patients.despite the large amount of research conducted on physical therapy cost-effectiveness and treatments for back pain (including chronic and acute low back pain, lumbar disc herniation, pregnancy-related back pain, work-related back pain), there is a lack of conclusive evidence that physical therapy is more effective than other treatments or placebo.home-based physical therapy programs have also found modest benefits in walking, bathing, upper- and lower-body dressing, transferring from a chair, using the toilet, eating, and grooming in elderly patients.not all physical therapy programs are suited for everyone, and patients should discuss their medical history with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any treatments.chest physical therapy, among other kinds of physical therapy, may increase metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, heart rate, and blood pressure.based on the available literature, physical therapy appears generally safe when practiced by a qualified physical therapist.physical therapy in this population may improve aerobic capacity and muscle force and reduce fatigue.there is good evidence that low-intensity laser irradiation, a widespread but controversial physical therapy agent, is not an effective treatment of plantar fasciitis when compared with sham laser treatment for plantar fasciitis.musculoskeletal physical therapy uses massage and joint movement to increase strength, motor control, and flexibility.according to one study, manipulative treatment may shorten recovery time faster than physiotherapy treatment.in some very low birth weight premature infants and young children, physical therapy techniques, such as passive motion and chest percussion therapy, may increase the likelihood of bone fractures.
