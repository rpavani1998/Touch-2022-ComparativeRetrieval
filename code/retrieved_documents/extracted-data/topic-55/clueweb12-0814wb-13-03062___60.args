i spent a little time with google and found out that urine therapy is, and has been, widely practiced in many traditional cultures.
the most significant finding is that no adverse outcomes were reported from the use of melatonin.
it is better to misinterpret shadows in the bushes as a lion than to miss a real lion.
“methinks you realize the obvious trap you have fallen into” i don’t see any trap.
all studies were performed on advanced cancer patients, were unblinded and did not include placebos.
when science suggests that the chances of something like, say, homeopathy working are so infinitesimally small as to be in essence zero, they can then cry “persecuted!”
several patients i’ve seen who through denial of their condition had deluded themselves that they did not have cancer, even after the tumor was growing through the skin.”
it is not the case that our brains constantly deceive us and lead us into grave errors.
they are also opposed to repeatedly running low quality pilot quality studies over and over again instead of following up with higher quality double blinded rct’s that can separate a signal form the noise.
modern people have the bias that they don’t know those things either and would rather listen to an ignorant charismatic fraud than a non-charismatic knowledgeable nerd.
a big problem with the scam world is that anecdotal reports and small preliminary-like studies are presented as actual, hard evidence.
the trend of late to divide medical therapies into “conventional” and “alternative” really doesn’t help the community.
for another, otc dietary supplements and herbs, even ones with real pharmacological effects, are typically considered cam, and receive greater attention from cam people.
one obvious problem with your article is that it doesn’t clarify that oral and not intravenous laetrile is generally (as far as i’ve heard) considered toxic.
five-year specific breast cancer survival of women who refused surgery was lower than that of those who accepted (72%, 95% confidence interval, 60%–84% versus 87%, 95% confidence interval, 86%–88%, respectively).
indeed, i sometimes think that the more intelligent among us aremore prone to such thinking, at least with respect to medicine, simply because they believe that their intelligence is such that they would never be so easily misled by such cognitive shortcomings that appear to be hard-wired into the human brain.
effects were consistent across melatonin dose, and type of cancer”.
as edzard ernst put it: the idea of an “alternative cancer cure” assumes that conventional oncology would not adopt a cancer treatment simply because it originates from an area outside of mainstream medicine.
nitrite and no also disrupts the biofilm phenotype of many bacteria, causing biofilms to disperse.
but jerry always said the reason he could fool people is not that they are fools but is because they have wonderful brains.
a new hypothesis that contradicts established scientific understanding is always rejected with rare exception: the new hypothesis must explain something previously unexplained and have more predictive power than the theory it contradicts.
i also found that one woman in south america died from a urine injection.
i can understand why parents might be afraid to have their children vaccinated, and that they don’t always have blind faith in the all-knowing medical priesthood and those fabulous drug companies.
the shallow reading of alternative cancer treatments displayed in this post (and even, strangely, in cassileth’s review), confirms an earlier statement i made in a comment that this blog has strong ideological rather than (or in addition to) scientific elements.
sometimes health fads catch on for a while, but if they are truly useless they will die out pretty soon.
you probably don’t know this because you haven’t read the primary literature that it reviews.
perhaps the most significant is that the same network of investigators in italy and poland conducted all 10 trials.
one possible explanation is that users of alternative medicine are less likely to undergo optimal medical therapy.
cam treatments cannot possibly be scientific because you define cam as treatments that have not been scientifically verified.
ghosts can’t possibly exist, but all kinds of people have been seeing them everywhere.
if a member of a primitive tribe eats a mushroom and dies the other members might jump to the conclusion that the mushroom was poisonous.
one interesting possibility is that users of alternative medicine were more likely to be having severe symptoms, which led them to turn to “alternative medicine” to try to relieve their symptoms.
independent verification is incredibly important.
people hold it up as an example of drug companies only wanting to sell expensive things, but its high price is a barrier to purchase which significantly limits their market share.
ancient people had the bias that they didn’t know about physiology, bacteria, metabolism, and a zillion other things.
the more complicated and expensive a drug is to manufacture, the narrower the profit margin will be.
i know i don’t like to waste time and money on things that have no obvious benefit.

as far as the single group, i mentioned that fact as suspicious in my comment, which apparently gorski didn’t notice.
of note, it was 19 years before all patients were dead.
i read the article previously, by the way, and added it as a reference in wikipedia.
no the experiments aren’t blinded and controlled, but they’re still experiments and they still give valid results in the long run.
yet we are able to sort out cause and effect well enough to navigate complex everyday life.
even so, given the huge difficulties involved in undertaking such a study, the investigators, who, as private practitioners operating a community practice in eugene, or, went above and beyond the call by trying to look at their data and answer this question.
# david gorski on 23 mar 2009 at 6:28 pm cam is not anti-scientific and they are as interested as you are in testing their ideas scientifically (but you want to prevent them).
in the meantime, i will continue to argue that the very concept of “alternative” medicine is a potentially deadly false dichotomy for cancer patients.
even though intuitively one would hypothesize that refusing scientific medicine and relying on placebo medicine instead would have a detrimental effect on survival, it turns out that this question is not as easy to answer as you might think.
the belief that the majority of mds (i.e. the standard of care) are always wrong is faith too.
(ref. 103) have shown that there is a positive benefit from the use of melatonin.
look especially at the long report by fda commissioner donald kennedy: http://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/q/laetrile/commissioner.pdf my first response to ii, who does, as kim so astutely put it, seem to be “imperfectly informed,” would be to ask why he/she considers melatonin to be in any way “alternative.”
there are far better ways of stimulating the growth of the bacteria i am working with to supply no/nox.
i have the highest respect for people and their wonderful brains; i just recognize that because of the way our wonderful brains are constructed, we tend to make mistakes that can only be countered by science.
the strength of this study is that the geneva cancer registry includes data from all patients from the geneva canton who underwent treatment and allowed the investigators to compare the outcomes of the women who refused to undergo surgery with curative intent with those who underwent surgery.
“i sometimes think that the more intelligent among us are more prone to such thinking, at least with respect to medicine, simply because they believe that their intelligence is such that they would never be so easily misled by such cognitive shortcomings that appear to be hard-wired into the human brain.”
despite a strong set of laws protecting the public from cancer cure quackery (ccq), there still exist a number of practicioners who insist on alternate treaments for their very ill patients, depsite no evidence of efficacy and the possible interference or delay of legitimate treatment.
i said that if i found good reasons to suspect it might have some benefit, i would first try it on animals to find out if it’s safe.
another important reason is that the natural history of breast cancer is extremely variable, from nasty, aggressive tumors that kill within months to indolent, slow-growing tumors that, even when metastatic, women can survive with for several years.
we recognize that we can be fooled as easily as anyone else.
the most common deficiencies included: lack of power sample calculation; small sample size; lack of adequate randomization and/or (patient and assessor or only assessor) blinding; and insufficient follow-up periods.
even the much touted psychosocial support of late hasfailed to demonstrate any improvement in the survival of cancer patients.
one trick you “skeptics” use in your war against cam is to ridicule and dismiss successful pilot studies, because they are small.
yes, i sometimes think the most educated high-iq types tend to make the most serious errors, because they have so much confidence in their own thinking.
the shallow reading of alternative cancer treatments displayed in this post (and even, strangely, in cassileth’s review), confirms an earlier statement i made in a comment that this blog has strong ideological rather than (or in addition to) scientific elements.
you probably don’t know this because you haven’t read the primary literature that it reviews.
however, to my great surprise, the one post that stands out as having received the most comments thus far in the history of sbm is one that i wrote.
we do not apologize for this; differentiating science-based from non-science-based medicine is theraison d’être of this blog.
modalities such as relaxation, psychotherapy, participation in a self-help group or changes in lifestyle activities that were used to reduce distress and to improve the patient’s subjective well being were not coded as am.
this is also true in science, certainly in modern medicine.
because it’s important to understand the natural history of breast cancer, i’ll reference a classic study examining the natural history of untreated breast cancer.
patients with a poor performance status are more likely to undergo less aggressive therapy because they are less able to tolerate, for example, radical surgery or heavy-duty chemotherapy regimens.
we recognize that we can be fooled as easily as anyone else.
i am interested in science and technology and that’s why i studied them.
what that means is that, if such a study could be done today, it is very likely thatlead time bias would significantly increase the apparent median survival, because increasingly tiny tumors are being found.
effects were consistent across melatonin dose, and type of cancer”.
i would not rule out treatments just because they depend on the idea that water can store information, for example, or that there are as-yet unrecognized forms of energy.
moreover, half the women accepted some form of other standard, effective treatm,ent, such as hormonal therapy alone.
the 1970s from the fda commissioner is not compelling either, and similarly doesn’t seem to make the toxicity clarification.
people do not make serious errors in practical matters because they lack conscious knowledge of the scientific method.
this is in spite of the fact that they know very well an alternative idea today could become mainstream tomorrow.
if the ‘treatment’ does not pass the early phases, plausibility is unlikely and it never makes it to formal rcts.
i think pec’s response makes it fairly clear he/she considers urine injections to be absurd, since he/she responded with a statement about the absurdity of extremes.
a survival graph from this classic paper is below: it should be noted that all of these tumors were detected as (at the very minimum) lumps in the breast, given that there was no other way of detecting them at the time.
if it doesn’t work, or is surpassed by something else, it should be set aside so that people are not harmed by it.
yep, no limit to the outrageous claims, false hope, misrepresentation, and continuous health fraud from the cam crowd.
as an extreme example, i would point out that there are lots of antivaccine “scientists” out there who all claim to find an association between vaccines and autism that no other investigator who’s looked at the question has been able to find.
# weing on 24 mar 2009 at 8:34 pm there is medicine on the one hand and quackery on the other.
one could argue that, given the poor quality of the studies examined by ernst, there might be an effect that was missed.
but it is weak and people get tired of bothering with things that only make them feel slightly better.
selective memory, confirmation bias, and confusing correlation with causationis how people think.
investigators studied data from surveys done by the norwegian board of health, which asked patients standard demographic information, but then asked them about their use of alternative medicine as follows: in the questionnaire presented to the patients, am was defined as any treatment outside of mainstream therapy that had been used to treat their cancer.
the placebo effect is only operative in mostly subjective outcomes, such as reduction of pain, etc.
the point that you seem to be missing here is that the scientific method came about to compensate for those recognized human vulnerabilities.
# pec on 28 mar 2009 at 6:34 am i understand the scientific method and the reasons for controlled experiments.
in tibet at high altitude, fuel was scarce, and also green leafy vegetables were not available year round.
controlled scientific experiments have their place, but most of the time are not practical.
death rates were higher in am users (79%) than in those who did not use am (65%).
consequently, it’s impossible to rule out selection bias, but, as the authors point out, this is one case where doing a randomized study is completely unethical.
moreover, half the women accepted some form of other standard, effective treatm,ent, such as hormonal therapy alone.
taken together, these data make it very hard not to conclude that at best the vast majority of alternative therapies are either useless, no more than placebos, or might even be harmful.
furthermore, the disease progression caused by the delay in surgery was associated with an increase in the estimated 10-year mortality rate.
but someone might note that they have eaten the same mushroom and it was ok, so the death may have been a coincidence.
what they found was that 18% of the 250 patients survived five years; 3.6% survived 10 years; and 0.8% survived 15 years.
in contrast, lots of women with metastatic breast cancer live longer than two or three years; a few.
this study did not limit itself to breast cancer, but it is interesting and useful nonetheless.
still, i find it equally suspicious that nobody else has bothered to try to replicate the findings in all these years.
if every single person became a scientist and lived according to the scientific method, there would be just as many stupid mistakes, and just as many irrational beliefs.
if a good rct shows that a treatment has utility, then it is medicine.
ancient people had the bias that they didn’t know about physiology, bacteria, metabolism, and a zillion other things.
no blinding, no placebo, 2/10 rcts used intent to treat; most trials tested melatonin + treatment against only treatment.
dean burk’s continued support of the therapy is similarly suspicious, and altogether it’s enough to leave room for doubt that the therapy was properly tested.
most trails had small sample sizes; thus a type ii error is conceivable.
# qetzal on 28 mar 2009 at 10:56 am pec, you should sue your phd program and advisor, because they clearly failed to train you properly.
it is also possible that a significant number of such small tumorsmay spontaneously regress , which further complicates the issue today, not to mention making it easier to find women who have rejected some or all of “conventional” medicine to treat their cancers and survived significant lengths of time to produce alternative medicine testimonials.
but we do not, if we are sane, deceive ourselves in the face of clear and obvious evidence.
overall, the median survival was 2.7 years.
they lost any physiological effects by changing what they did.
http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/full/47/12/3713 when this author presented this work at a conference, i asked for his comment on how his no/nox results in urine might reflect on the effectiveness of a golden shower regarding uti status.
topically applied urine might be able to substitute for exercise or thermal sweating provided one had the right biofilm of the bacteria i am studying.
the belief that the majority of mds (i.e. the standard of care) are always wrong is faith too.
a big problem with the scam world is that anecdotal reports and small preliminary-like studies are presented as actual, hard evidence.
yes i know we deceive ourselves, as i already said, but not because we aren’t scientific enough.
# daedalus2u on 28 mar 2009 at 7:39 pm i actually have looked at the literature on urine therapy (such as i could find it, there wasn’t that much when i looked).
this is not the same thing as saying that there are no effective ones, but it’s really not much better.
in tibet at high altitude, fuel was scarce, and also green leafy vegetables were not available year round.
as an extreme example, i would point out that there are lots of antivaccine “scientists” out there who all claim to find an association between vaccines and autism that no other investigator who’s looked at the question has been able to find.
a total of 515 patients were analyzed, and results were as follows: in january 2001, survival data were obtained with a follow-up of 8 years for 515 cancer patients.
no, i would definitely not start with an rct, and most definitely not with human subjects.
of the other 6 patients, 5 had developed metastatic disease that precluded benefit from surgery.
neither would the myth that things go crazy around the time of a full moon … ” yes because you are absolutely certain that every ancient “superstition” is complete nonsense you would say that.
of the other 6 patients, 5 had developed metastatic disease that precluded benefit from surgery.
i’ve also read about the chichimeca indians drinking the urine of their chief after he consumed a hallucinogenic mushroom in order to experience hallucinations.
in any case, as a cancer surgeon, i don’t care where a therapy came from.
i could find no mention of injection of urine (which i think would be a death wish).
the difference is that current mainstream medicine is materialist, mechanistic and reductionist, while cam does not share these limitations.
oh, and skeptics do not exempt themselves from human foolishness.
patients also had the opportunity to add other types of alternative therapy in response to an open question.
in any case, as a cancer surgeon, i don’t care where a therapy came from.
# weing on 29 mar 2009 at 11:27 am i’ve heard of using urine for wound irrigation in the wilderness.
death rates were higher in am users (79%) than in those who did not use am (65%).
the topical use of urine might have therapeutic effects in “the wild” provided the proper biofilm is present.
doctor’s office with huge, fungating tumors, only to be told that they have to undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before any surgery is possible, after which they will often disappear again.
look here: http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=83 there you’ll also find links to evidence against laetrile that was compelling enough so that it should have “closed the books” even before moertel’s study.
treatments examined included various methods of psychosocial support such as group support therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive existential group therapy, a combination of muscle relaxation training and guided imagery, the chinese herbal remedy shi quan da bu tang, thymus extract, transfer factor, melatonin, and factor af2.
online, an online tool into which clinicians can enter prognostic factors of a breast cancer at the time of presentation and come up with an estimate of chances of survival and recurrence with and without treatment.
no/nox physiology is pretty complicated and there is cross-talk with dietary nitrate which is most abundant in leafy green vegetables and which some have hypothesized is the reason that a diet rich in green leafy vegetables is associated with good health.
patients certainly benefit from placebo treatments, in concert with viable methodologies, however, to the exclusion of effective treatment they are a measure of criminal negligence.
admittedly much of the altmed use may be oral.
one obvious problem with your article is that it doesn’t clarify that oral and not intravenous laetrile is generally (as far as i’ve heard) considered toxic.
[...] @ii: sorry, but you are, well, imperfectly informed.
for example, shark cartilage extract neovastat (now disproven), polysaccharide k (approved in japan, so arguably not cam), and perhaps antineoplastons.
i think science is great and that the dogmatic pseudo-skeptics only block its progress.
in the case of pancreatic cancer, for instance, just producing well documented case reports of a few five year survivors among patients with documented metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas would, i daresay, make even wally sampson and kimball atwood sit up and take notice.
if every single person became a scientist and lived according to the scientific method, there would be just as many stupid mistakes, and just as many irrational beliefs.
we deceive ourselves in things we do know know and cannot know, accepting whichever answers we find most pleasant.
although their omission may introduce a selection bias in the results, the effect of this bias is expected to be small because relatively few patients (14 of 47) were in this category.
(ref. 103) were able to find only ten reports, all from the lissoni group, that analysed melatonin definitively alone or in combination with standard therapies.
# pec on 26 mar 2009 at 7:22 am obviously, i would have to take time to read up on urine for autism.
in the case of blood letting, your approach was to find out if ancient people really did use blood letting, rather than try and figure out what physiology blood letting might influence.
anecdotal evidence may come first, then a series of small pilot studies, and eventually, if the treatment looks promising, carefully controlled experiments.
i would read what i could find, and i might speak to some patients and practitioners who use it.
perhaps the most significant is that the same network of investigators in italy and poland conducted all 10 trials.
admittedly, same research group for all the trials, which is suspicious.
am use had the most detrimental effect in patients with an ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group) performance status (ps) of 0 (hazard ratio for use=2.32, 95% ci, 1.44, 3.74, p=0.001), when compared with an ecog ps of 1 or higher.
there’s little interest in sifting the wheat from the chaff and providing a balanced overview of medical science, including major problems in mainstream medicine.
that alone would not make me dismiss it as dangerous, without knowing all the details of that particular case.
if a good rct shows that a treatment has utility, then it is medicine.
this, of course, is a weakness, but, again, randomizing patients to scientific medicine or alternative medicine would be completely unethical.
basically, they just have to prove that it’s functionally identical to the original drug and that their manufacturing methods pass muster.
to my knowledge, no one has ever shown an improvement in survival from cancer or even the shrinkage of a tumor due to placebo effect.
my fundamental no hypothesis is that ammonia oxidizing bacteria on the skin oxidize ammonia in sweat into nitrite and no, and this is important in setting the basal level of no/nox.
if any “alternative” medicine can make the cut when subjected to scientific scrutiny, both in terms of evidence supporting its efficacy against disease and of a scientifically remotely plausible mechanism that can be studied, we will then consider it to be part of sbm.”
as far as laetrile, i don’t have convenient nejm access that far back, although i’d love to see those issues.
nitrite and no also disrupts the biofilm phenotype of many bacteria, causing biofilms to disperse.
in the case of such questions, we scientists have to make do with whatever methodology we can; i.e., do the best we can with what we have.

for correctly inferring causation, it’s very, very unreliable.
these trials were all performed by the same group in the same hospital and are thus without independent confirmation from any other group; the results, although intriguing, are therefore difficult to assess.
mar 23 2009 of all the posts i and my cobloggers have written for sbm over the last 15 months, most provoke relatively few comments.

patients who declined chemotherapy or hormone therapy faired slightly better.
or a busy person, as you seem to have no means for quickly dismissing the idea of giving autistic kids urine shots.
if someone could show me that reiki or homeopathy cures cancer, i’d use either.
i have the highest respect for people and their wonderful brains; i just recognize that because of the way our wonderful brains are constructed, we tend to make mistakes that can only be countered by science.
it makes you feel good to believe that.
airborne is marked up considerably, but still people buy a lot of it.
finally, about five years ago, there was a study out of norway that looked at the effect of alternative medicine on cancer survival.
you seem completely unable to believe that all humans are prone to these sorts of cognitive shortcomings in every day life.
in any case, what this study shows is that women with no surgery can still live a long time, but are far more likely to die of their cancer than women who do undergo surgical extirpation.
cam treatments cannot possibly be scientific because you define cam as treatments that have not been scientifically verified.
in the case of pancreatic cancer, for instance, just producing well documented case reports of a few five year survivors among patients with documented metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas would, i daresay, make even wally sampson and kimball atwood sit up and take notice.
mysteriously, their veteran researcher kanematsu sugiura found it effective in several animal experiments.
in scam the quack cures are sold all over and the corporations selling them are laughing all the way to the bank.
if it’s legitimatly tested and found effective… so if a cam researcher manages to get some funding in spite of your all-out ideological war, and if they demonstrate effectiveness, you will say well maybe it works but, since it has now been scientifically verified, it isn’t cam.
also, those that do probably drop off the radar screen of their science-based practitioners, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture data regarding their outcomes, given that they all too often stick with their alternative healers until the end.
most of the time most things are unknown and we do our best.
there are far better ways of stimulating the growth of the bacteria i am working with to supply no/nox.

so, as far as melatonin goes, my retort to ii would be that (1) melatonin as an anticancer therapy is not in any way “alternative” and (2) that the evidence for its efficacy is rather weak.
for example, if you do a search on pubmed using terms like “alternative medicine,” “breast cancer,” and “survival,” the vast majority of the hits will be studies of complementary and alternative medicine (cam) and breast cancer with little reference to what possible effect these therapies might have on survival.
astrology wouldn’t exist if that weren’t the case.
in a cox regression model adjusted for demographic, disease and treatment factors, the hazard ratio of death for any use of am compared with no use was 1.30, (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.99, 1.70; p=0.056), suggesting that am use may predict a shorter survival.
these trials were all performed by the same group in the same hospital and are thus without independent confirmation from any other group; the results, although intriguing, are therefore difficult to assess.
selective memory, confirmation bias, and confusing correlation with causationis how people think.
the entire antivaccine movement, which leads to autism quackery.
in any case, this study had a number of problems, including a high attrition rate that could have resulted in significant selection bias.
in the case of such questions, we scientists have to make do with whatever methodology we can; i.e., do the best we can with what we have.
sensitivity analyses strengthened the negative association between am use and survival.
people hold it up as an example of drug companies only wanting to sell expensive things, but its high price is a barrier to purchase which significantly limits their market share.
that would be a waste of time and then you have to spend money denouncing the studies when they inevitably find that the treatments don’t work.
complicated, expensive chemicals are not preferred by drug companies, because the higher costs make them riskier to market.
after accounting for other prognostic factors including tumor characteristics and stage, women who refused surgery had a 2.1-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.5–3.1) increased risk to die of breast cancer compared with operated women.
i got it because of my interest in nitric oxide physiology, and because urine is a good source of urea, which i hypothesized that indigenous peoples in regions where other no sources were unavailable might turn to.
when humans migrated out of africa, they left the tropics and entered regions where it was not hot year round, where sweating was virtually absent for parts of the year.
unlike most “skeptics,” i do not believe that most people are self-deceiving fools.
for example: cow urine for migraine.
# shadowmouse on 23 mar 2009 at 6:56 pm le sigh, pec’s tiresome patterings, with a heaping helping of snarkiness “but you want to prevent cam researchers from getting funding” no, cammers refuse to legtimatly set up proper testing studies, and blame everyone else.

it’s also a straw man to say that this is evidence of the “idiocy” of nonscientists.
if i recall correctly wade says he wasn’t able to distinguish when blinded, but it’s still suspicious.
neither would the myth that things go crazy around the time of a full moon (it’s been studied; there are, for example, no more er visits on average around the time of a full moon than any other time).
it is better to misinterpret shadows in the bushes as a lion than to miss a real lion.
first, it confirms once again the importance of surgery as a therapeutic modality for breast cancer, especially early stage.
i just spit up my iced tea all over it when i read that sentence.
when very large numbers of seemingly normal people swear by something, it warrants at least a casual investigation.
the paucity and the often-low methodological quality of the rcts are as unexpected to us as they are disappointing.
in fact, i view it as condescending to asians to hold remedies that originate from the “east” to a lower standard of evidence than those that originated from the “west.”
non-western traditional people do not use harmful or useless medical treatments repeatedly over thousands of years because they have confused correlation with causation.
you seem completely unable to believe that all humans are prone to these sorts of cognitive shortcomings in every day life.
to my knowledge, no one has ever shown an improvement in survival from cancer or even the shrinkage of a tumor due to placebo effect.
yes that is always your ultimate “proof” that traditional people are capable of fooling themselves endlessly.
on the other hand, anecdotes and testimonials are not scientific evidence.
as i’ve often argued about, for example, the gonzalez regimen for pancreatic cancer, if such accs really were cures, it would actually be fairly easy to show.
the objective of the study was to examine all studies randomized clinical trials (rcts) for “alternative cancer cures” (accs).
cam is not anti-scientific and they are as interested as you are in testing their ideas scientifically (but you want to prevent them).
i am a skeptic and i do not make up my mind about things just because i follow a certain ideology.
the difference is that current mainstream medicine is materialist, mechanistic and reductionist, while cam does not share these limitations.”
controlled scientific experiments have their place, but most of the time are not practical.
if i recall correctly wade says he wasn’t able to distinguish when blinded, but it’s still suspicious.
finally, about five years ago, there was a study out of norway that looked at the effect of alternative medicine on cancer survival.
moreover, although there is a relative paucity of studies, and they, too, are generally retrospective and difficult to interpret, what evidence is out there is that alternative medicine use among cancer patients is associated with an increased risk of dying from cancer, particularly when conventional therapy is eschewed.
the difference is that current mainstream medicine is materialist, mechanistic and reductionist, while cam does not share these limitations.
i can understand why a patient with advanced cancer might feel they have no good options and might be afraid to accept the reality.
one interesting possibility is that users of alternative medicine were more likely to be having severe symptoms, which led them to turn to “alternative medicine” to try to relieve their symptoms.
in any case, this study had a number of problems, including a high attrition rate that could have resulted in significant selection bias.
i know that we are all very limited and fallible, but i also believe in the essential reasonableness of human nature.
in other words, not surprisingly, use of alternative medicine is correlated with poorer surival in the patients with a good performance status and thus who are likely to have a more favorable prognosis.
we deceive ourselves in things we do know know and cannot know, accepting whichever answers we find most pleasant.
and, yes, all those ancient peoples who thought bloodletting was a great cure for what ails you or that it’s not possible for so many people to be so wrong for so many hundreds (or thousands) of years about something.
yes, i sometimes think the most educated high-iq types tend to make the most serious errors, because they have so much confidence in their own thinking.
# pec on 29 mar 2009 at 6:29 am daedalus2u, your post seems to confirm the idea that non-western people are capable of reasoning and of making scientific observations.
what is often claimed is a near-miraculous “cure” for cancer, which, if it were true, would be relatively easy to detect.
if any “alternative” medicine can make the cut when subjected to scientific scrutiny, both in terms of evidence supporting its efficacy against disease and of a scientifically remotely plausible mechanism that can be studied, we will then consider it to be part of sbm.”
science is just a formalization of the way people naturally think; it is not different from the normal logic and common sense that all people in all times have possessed.
my complaint was that gorski is able to claim that there are no effective cam treatments, because any that have been shown to be effective are now mainstream.
# pec on 24 mar 2009 at 6:43 am the blog authors here and at neurologica are fighting a political war (that is how they describe it) against cam funding.
your article is so incriminating of lamas that i’m surprised you haven’t filed some sort of case with the office of research integrity.
i know that we are all very limited and fallible, but i also believe in the essential reasonableness of human nature.
basically, they just have to prove that it’s functionally identical to the original drug and that their manufacturing methods pass muster.
topically applied urine might be able to substitute for exercise or thermal sweating provided one had the right biofilm of the bacteria i am studying.
while i don’t think they’re being rational in regards to their belief that the earth is 6000 years old, i don’t consider most young earth creationists to be not sane.
but you are very steadfast in missing my point.
compare that with airborne, a “dietary supplement” sold as a cold remedy (despite a lack of evidence), which is extremely cheap to make.
when humans migrated out of africa, they left the tropics and entered regions where it was not hot year round, where sweating was virtually absent for parts of the year.
because it’s important to understand the natural history of breast cancer, i’ll reference a classic study examining the natural history of untreated breast cancer.
a generic drug doesn’t have to pay very much for development; they just have to apply with the fda to get their version approved, which is much less onerous than proving that the stuff works as advertised in the first place.
# hcn on 28 mar 2009 at 1:39 pm pec said “i have a phd in an experimental science.”
this study did not limit itself to breast cancer, but it is interesting and useful nonetheless.
when organizations like ncam perform real rcts and find no value in whatever “snake oil”, the scam community condemns the findings (see all of the sen harkin related posts).
it would be a silly waste of our time to not assume that frames contain glass and to try to verify every instance.
modalities such as relaxation, psychotherapy, participation in a self-help group or changes in lifestyle activities that were used to reduce distress and to improve the patient’s subjective well being were not coded as am.
you can find as much silliness and intelligence in “non-westerns” as you can here.
however, the reason we go back to this study time and time again is because, at least in developed countries, it is the rare woman with breast cancer who does not undergo treatment of some kind for it.
no/nox physiology is pretty complicated and there is cross-talk with dietary nitrate which is most abundant in leafy green vegetables and which some have hypothesized is the reason that a diet rich in green leafy vegetables is associated with good health.
it’s not a health fad, but that fact that astrology hasn’t died out yet kind of shoots a hole in that position.
what is often claimed is a near-miraculous “cure” for cancer, which, if it were true, would be relatively easy to detect.
so, if a drug is cheaper to make, this is actually to the drug company’s benefit.
i will also note that i tend to cast an especially skeptical eye on any clinical trial done by the cancer treatment centers of america, given how much ctca promotes and supports woo in addition to standard therapy; i.e., “integrative medicine.”
our “wonderful brains” are very good at navigating this world.
you can find as much silliness and intelligence in “non-westerns” as you can here.
a no-lose situation for the camsters.
i’m not sure pec’s answer to the stated question would be all that useful; the point is simply that we can judge some things as being too absurd to waste resources on, and i think pec agrees.
but we do not see ordinary people going around doing ridiculous things because they have confused correlation with causation.
i think science is great and that the dogmatic pseudo-skeptics only block its progress.”
for correctly inferring causation, it’s very, very unreliable.
pec, surely you believe that some therapies are not worthy of our precious resources.
yep, no limit to the outrageous claims, false hope, misrepresentation, and continuous health fraud from the cam crowd.
so, as far as melatonin goes, my retort to ii would be that (1) melatonin as an anticancer therapy is not in any way “alternative” and (2) that the evidence for its efficacy is rather weak.
i don’t know, but i do know that i’m always very skeptical about results that come from only one group of investigators.
the more complicated and expensive a drug is to manufacture, the narrower the profit margin will be.
the trend of late to divide medical therapies into “conventional” and “alternative” really doesn’t help the community.
the meta-analysis concludes that melatonin significantly reduced the risk of death of these patients at one year.
admittedly, same research group for all the trials, which is suspicious.
a new hypothesis that contradicts established scientific understanding is always rejected with rare exception: the new hypothesis must explain something previously unexplained and have more predictive power than the theory it contradicts.
even so, given the huge difficulties involved in undertaking such a study, the investigators, who, as private practitioners operating a community practice in eugene, or, went above and beyond the call by trying to look at their data and answer this question.
sensitivity analyses strengthened the negative association between am use and survival.
but we do not, in general, fool ourselves into eating poisonous mushrooms.
as someone who i suppose straddles the line, having an asian parent, and who lived in asia for a while, i can tell you that “non-western” folk are just like us.
when very large numbers of seemingly normal people swear by something, it warrants at least a casual investigation.
you may well have a phd in an experimental science, but you definitely lack a phdunderstanding of experimental science.
if a member of a primitive tribe eats a mushroom and dies the other members might jump to the conclusion that the mushroom was poisonous.
they do not want cam treatments and ideas to be tested scientifically.
they’re summed up in the following table: the authors comment: we found that the overwhelming majority of the patients who initially refused surgical treatment for breast cancer developed disease progression.
take, for example the computer that you use, it represents tremendous amounts of known science.
in any case, what this study shows is that women with no surgery can still live a long time, but are far more likely to die of their cancer than women who do undergo surgical extirpation.
the scam business is all about reintroducing quackery into the marketplace.
i spent a little time with google and found out that urine therapy is, and has been, widely practiced in many traditional cultures.
they are also opposed to repeatedly running low quality pilot quality studies over and over again instead of following up with higher quality double blinded rct’s that can separate a signal form the noise.
# dr benway on 23 mar 2009 at 11:06 pm pec, surely you believe that some therapies are not worthy of our precious resources.
maybe there is a substance in urine that benefits the immune system in some way.
@gorski: i consider melatonin “cam” because, well, for one thing it would be at best “complementary”.
in reality, the scientific method is a barrier against the way people naturally think that prevents how humans naturally think from leading them to confuse correlation with causation and jump to the wrong conclusions.
i actually have looked at the literature on urine therapy (such as i could find it, there wasn’t that much when i looked).
for another, otc dietary supplements and herbs, even ones with real pharmacological effects, are typically considered cam, and receive greater attention from cam people.
“i just recognize that because of the way our wonderful brains are constructed, we tend to make mistakes that can only be countered by science.”
while i don’t think they’re being rational in regards to their belief that the earth is 6000 years old, i don’t consider most young earth creationists to be not sane.
i could find no mention of injection of urine (which i think would be a death wish).
patients with a poor performance status are more likely to undergo less aggressive therapy because they are less able to tolerate, for example, radical surgery or heavy-duty chemotherapy regimens.
@gorski: i consider melatonin “cam” because, well, for one thing it would be at best “complementary”.
unfortunately, the study was also small, only 33 patients.
in reality, the scientific method is a barrier against the way people naturally think that prevents how humans naturally think from leading them to confuse correlation with causation and jump to the wrong conclusions.
complicated, expensive chemicals are not preferred by drug companies, because the higher costs make them riskier to market.
ingesting urine might be able to substitute for ingesting nitrate in green leafy vegetables.
we could not survive otherwise.
the objective of the study was to examine all studies randomized clinical trials (rcts) for “alternative cancer cures” (accs).
i was saying that traditional people who do not have a western scientific education are nevertheless capable of being reasonable and making scientific observations.
very superstitious, wash your face and hands the point that dr hall was trying to make, and which you agreed with, was that there needed to be some sort of a priori plausible physiology behind a treatment before going into clinical trials.
modern urine therapy likely has no beneficial effects and the current practitioners of it don’t realize it.
congratulations, you have successfully combined the argument from antiquity, with the argument from incredulity, topped off with blatant cultural chauvinism .
whenever evidence is clear and unambiguous people go along with it.
all normal humans, including those who lack a western education, are able to reason.
when science suggests that the chances of something like, say, homeopathy working are so infinitesimally small as to be in essence zero, they can then cry “persecuted!”
so this drives them towards complicated, expensive chemicals anyway, which can give the impression that they somehow prefer selling things that are very expensive despite the lower profit margin that comes with that.
have shown that there is a positive benefit from the use of melatonin.
we can be more efficient by using such mental shortcuts, but occasionally they mislead us.
i know i don’t like to waste time and money on things that have no obvious benefit.
pec, you should sue your phd program and advisor, because they clearly failed to train you properly.
it has been suggested that utis can be treated by ingesting nitrate (as in 100 g of lettuce), allowing the nitrate to be excreted in the urine, allowing the bacteria causing the uti to reduce that nitrate to nitrite (e. coli does this), and then acidifying the urine and ingesting vitamin c which facilitates reduction of nitrite to no, producing acidified nitrite which is a broad spectrum antimicrobial.
pec, “non-western traditional people do not use harmful or useless medical treatments repeatedly over thousands of years because they have confused correlation with causation.”
this characteristic would make larger clinical trials of melatonin feasible.
but we do not, if we are sane, deceive ourselves in the face of clear and obvious evidence.
i would not rule out treatments just because they depend on the idea that water can store information, for example, or that there are as-yet unrecognized forms of energy.
i can understand why parents might be afraid to have their children vaccinated, and that they don’t always have blind faith in the all-knowing medical priesthood and those fabulous drug companies.

it’s interesting that as soon as a cam therapy is shown to be effective, you say it isn’t cam.
i said that if i found good reasons to suspect it might have some benefit, i would first try it on animals to find out if it’s safe.
daedalus2u, your post seems to confirm the idea that non-western people are capable of reasoning and of making scientific observations.
# david gorski on 29 mar 2009 at 7:52 am the antivaccine movement is based on confusing correlation with causation in blaming autism on vaccines, for one.
this occurs at levels well below that necessary for bactericidal effects.
the latest cochrane review of laetrile actually stated that clinical trials are necessary, and there’s allegations that moertel used the relatively inactive isoamgydalin at far too low of doses, and gave up on intravenous (nontoxic) for oral (possibly toxic) far too quickly.
i am interested in science and technology and that’s why i studied them.
in scam the quack cures are sold all over and the corporations selling them are laughing all the way to the bank.
for example, if you do a search on pubmed using terms like “alternative medicine,” “breast cancer,” and “survival,” the vast majority of the hits will be studies of complementary and alternative medicine (cam) and breast cancer with little reference to what possible effect these therapies might have on survival.
after accounting for other prognostic factors including tumor characteristics and stage, women who refused surgery had a 2.1-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.5–3.1) increased risk to die of breast cancer compared with operated women.
yes that is always your ultimate “proof” that traditional people are capable of fooling themselves endlessly.
perfectly sane people do ignore, disregard, and discount clear and obvious evidence that contradicts positions they “know” to be true all the time.
compare that with airborne, a “dietary supplement” sold as a cold remedy (despite a lack of evidence), which is extremely cheap to make.
nitter therapy consists of vitamin b12, gammaglobulins, tranexamic acid, multivitamins and nutritional supplements.
the use of am seems to predict a shorter survival from cancer.
modern people have the bias that they don’t know those things either and would rather listen to an ignorant charismatic fraud than a non-charismatic knowledgeable nerd.
there is a folk remedy for impotence,the golden shower , which might have a mechanism via no/nox (erections are mediated through no physiology).
i would not plunge into elaborate and expensive formal research until i had seen some very good evidence in favor of the therapy.
if the ‘treatment’ does not pass the early phases, plausibility is unlikely and it never makes it to formal rcts.
still, i find it equally suspicious that nobody else has bothered to try to replicate the findings in all these years.
# pec on 26 mar 2009 at 6:18 pm “methinks you realize the obvious trap you have fallen into” i don’t see any trap.
a recent meta-analysis found that melatonin “reduced the risk of death at 1 yr (relative risk: 0.66, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.73, i2=0%, heterogeneity p<or=0.56).
if it’s legitimatly tested and found effective… so if a cam researcher manages to get some funding in spite of your all-out ideological war, and if they demonstrate effectiveness, you will say well maybe it works but, since it has now been scientifically verified, it isn’t cam.
what they found was that 18% of the 250 patients survived five years; 3.6% survived 10 years; and 0.8% survived 15 years.
there is a folk remedy for impotence,the golden shower , which might have a mechanism via no/nox (erections are mediated through no physiology).
athletes wouldn’t refuse to shave or wear their “lucky shirts” when they’re on a winning streak if that weren’t the case.
such rapid “jumping to conclusions” probably had an evolutionary advantage because waiting for more information could be fatal, but it is a method of thinking that is very ill-suited for answering scientific questions regarding medicine.
i’m not sure pec’s answer to the stated question would be all that useful; the point is simply that we can judge some things as being too absurd to waste resources on, and i think pec agrees.
there is medicine on the one hand and quackery on the other.
in any case, it raises red flags that virtually all of the positive studies of melatonin as a breast cancer chemotherapeutic agent come from a single group, lissoni et al.
science is the way to prevent such cognitive quirks from leading to the wrong conclusion.
i can understand why a patient with advanced cancer might feel they have no good options and might be afraid to accept the reality.
the hypothesis of the study was that the use of alternative medicine does not have any effect on the survival of cancer patients, and to test the hypothesis investigators studied data from surveys done by the norwegian board of health, which asked patients standard demographic information, but then asked them about their use of alternative medicine as follows: in the questionnaire presented to the patients, am was defined as any treatment outside of mainstream therapy that had been used to treat their cancer.
the topic of the post was a case report that i had heard while visiting the tumor board of an affiliate of my former cancer center describing a young woman who had rejected conventional therapy for an eminently treatable breast cancer and then returned two or three years later with a large, nasty tumor that was much more difficult to treat and possibly metastatic to the bone, which would make it no longer even potentially curable.
obviously, i would have to take time to read up on urine for autism.
the strength of this study is that the geneva cancer registry includes data from all patients from the geneva canton who underwent treatment and allowed the investigators to compare the outcomes of the women who refused to undergo surgery with curative intent with those who underwent surgery.
ultimately this website preaches to the choir, and it’s articles are typically obviously biased.
treatments examined included various methods of psychosocial support such as group support therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy cognitive existential group therapy, a combination of muscle relaxation training and guided imagery, the chinese herbal remedy shi quan da bu tang, thymus extract, transfer factor, melatonin, and factor af2.

the terminal metabolite of no is nitrate, and that is excreted in the urine, so urine is a source of nitrate as well as a source of urea (which becomes ammonia on hydrolysis).
from the 15 studies ernst examined, this is what was concluded: the totality of the data fails to show a single intervention that would be demonstrably effective as an acc.

airborne is marked up considerably, but still people buy a lot of it.
also, those that do probably drop off the radar screen of their science-based practitioners, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to capture data regarding their outcomes, given that they all too often stick with their alternative healers until the end.

yes, they are opposed to wasting precious, limited funds on highly implausible treatments, especially those that have already been tested scientifically and failed to show any difference from placebo.
as far as the single group, i mentioned that fact as suspicious in my comment, which apparently gorski didn’t notice.
it was noted that only one trial applied anintention to treat analysis .

such rapid “jumping to conclusions” probably had an evolutionary advantage because waiting for more information could be fatal, but it is a method of thinking that is very ill-suited for answering scientific questions regarding medicine.
although their omission may introduce a selection bias in the results, the effect of this bias is expected to be small because relatively few patients (14 of 47) were in this category.
this, of course, is a weakness, but, again, randomizing patients to scientific medicine or alternative medicine would be completely unethical.
science is the way to prevent such cognitive quirks from leading to the wrong conclusion.
true, they may pop up again in their surgeon’s or primary care
(it is, of course, these women who usually show up in “alternative medicine” testimonials, because they can survive a long time with little or no treatment before their tumors progress.)
it’s not a health fad, but that fact that astrology hasn’t died out yet kind of shoots a hole in that position.
a survival graph from this classic paper is below: it should be noted that all of these tumors were detected as (at the very minimum) lumps in the breast, given that there was no other way of detecting them at the time.
in the registry, there were identified 70 patients (1.3%) who refused surgery and concluded: these women [those who refused surgery] were older, more frequently single, and had larger tumors.
i read the article previously, by the way, and added it as a reference in wikipedia.
i think science is great and that the dogmatic pseudo-skeptics only block its progress.
the studies that do purport to show an effect are virtually all plagued with methodological difficulties and tend to show effects that are barely above background noise.

as i’ve often argued about, for example, the gonzalez regimen for pancreatic cancer, if such accs really were cures, it would actually be fairly easy to show.
it is also possible that a significant number of such small tumorsmay spontaneously regress , which further complicates the issue today, not to mention making it easier to find women who have rejected some or all of “conventional” medicine to treat their cancers and survived significant lengths of time to produce alternative medicine testimonials.
putting it all together, i conclude that there is no compelling evidence for a significant survival benefit due to any “alternative” therapy, nor is there good evidence for significant treatment effects.
even the much touted psychosocial support of late hasfailed to demonstrate any improvement in the survival of cancer patients.
by software estimates, the 10-year mortality rate for these patients is still expected to be more than 50% higher than it would have been if the patients had taken their recommended therapy.
the correct way to supply more no is topically where it feeds into the natural physiological pathways that regulate it.
in this way, you can block cam treatments from getting through the initial stages of careful scientific investigation.
am use had the most detrimental effect in patients with an ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group) performance status (ps) of 0 (hazard ratio for use=2.32, 95% ci, 1.44, 3.74, p=0.001), when compared with an ecog ps of 1 or higher.
no, i would definitely not start with an rct, and most definitely not with human subjects.
my guess is that it was almost certainly due to the ineffectiveness of the alternative therapies chosen.
of note, it was 19 years before all patients were dead.
but since most of the cheap ones have already been taken, they are usually forced to either compete in an existing market for a simple, cheap chemical (eg ibuprofen, where advil and motrin are engaged in all-out advertising war) or try to come up with something new where they won’t have so much competition.
certainly more than will buy gardasil, and lots more doses per person.
there’s little interest in sifting the wheat from the chaff and providing a balanced overview of medical science, including major problems in mainstream medicine.

i am sorry but testing software does not make you a real scientist.
yes, they are opposed to wasting precious, limited funds on highly implausible treatments, especially those that have already been tested scientifically and failed to show any difference from placebo.
in addition, one year survival is very short term in the context of many cancers such as breast (with a mean recurrence time of seven years) and a much longer trial would need to be conducted.
but even if this were true, one would be correct in stating that to date, no effective acc has been identified.
for instance, he would take off his glasses and show that there was no glass in them; everyone had assumed they were real glasses
consequently, it’s impossible to rule out selection bias, but, as the authors point out, this is one case where doing a randomized study is completely unethical.
however, the reason we go back to this study time and time again is because, at least in developed countries, it is the rare woman with breast cancer who does not undergo treatment of some kind for it.
i feel comfortable in saying that if there was an “alternative” treatment with a plausible basis in science, or it the underlying basis for an apparently implausible treatment could be plausibly supported, and it had not already been properly tested, you wouldn’t find any of the authors on this site opposing high quality testing of that treatment, and if those high quality trials showed it to be effective, the treatment would become part of scientific medicine, perhaps requiring a rewrite of our knowledge of science and medicine.

that would be a waste of time and then you have to spend money denouncing the studies when they inevitably find that the treatments don’t work.
dean burk’s continued support of the therapy is similarly suspicious, and altogether it’s enough to leave room for doubt that the therapy was properly tested.
in the registry, there were identified 70 patients (1.3%) who refused surgery and concluded: these women [those who refused surgery] were older, more frequently single, and had larger tumors.
and in this way you can always claim that no cam treatments work, and cam research should never be funded.
it’s also a straw man to say that this is evidence of the “idiocy” of nonscientists.
you are wrong — people make stupid mistakes because the world is complicated and our data is limited.
in no way do i suggest that anyone use urine therapy for anything.
the main goal of scam studies is marketing.
we feel that, should such a cure one day emerge, it would be investigated without delay by oncologists and adopted into routine care as soon as the data supporting it are convincing.
i would read what i could find, and i might speak to some patients and practitioners who use it.
# calli arcale on 25 mar 2009 at 9:01 am i think pec’s response makes it fairly clear he/she considers urine injections to be absurd, since he/she responded with a statement about the absurdity of extremes.
one could argue that, given the poor quality of the studies examined by ernst, there might be an effect that was missed.
and, yes, all those ancient peoples who thought bloodletting was a great cure for what ails you or that it’s not possible for so many people to be so wrong for so many hundreds (or thousands) of years about something.
as edzard ernst put it: the idea of an “alternative cancer cure” assumes that conventional oncology would not adopt a cancer treatment simply because it originates from an area outside of mainstream medicine.
even though intuitively one would hypothesize that refusing scientific medicine and relying on placebo medicine instead would have a detrimental effect on survival, it turns out that this question is not as easy to answer as you might think.
in the meantime, i will continue to argue that the very concept of “alternative” medicine is a potentially deadly false dichotomy for cancer patients.
the placebo effect is only operative in mostly subjective outcomes, such as reduction of pain, etc.
our brains have learned to take shortcuts and jump to conclusions because of the survival value.
take, for example the computer that you use, it represents tremendous amounts of known science.
several patients i’ve seen who through denial of their condition had deluded themselves that they did not have cancer, even after the tumor was growing through the skin.”
you do not need any scientific training to do this kind of analysis — everyone does it every day.
it would be a silly waste of our time to not assume that frames contain glass and to try to verify every instance.
maybe there is a substance in urine that benefits the immune system in some way.
i simply don’t know, and if i were a medical researcher i might try to find out.
it’s interesting that as soon as a cam therapy is shown to be effective, you say it isn’t cam.
despite a strong set of laws protecting the public from cancer cure quackery (ccq), there still exist a number of practicioners who insist on alternate treaments for their very ill patients, depsite no evidence of efficacy and the possible interference or delay of legitimate treatment.
patients certainly benefit from placebo treatments, in concert with viable methodologies, however, to the exclusion of effective treatment they are a measure of criminal negligence.
but since most of the cheap ones have already been taken, they are usually forced to either compete in an existing market for a simple, cheap chemical (eg ibuprofen, where advil and motrin are engaged in all-out advertising war) or try to come up with something new where they won’t have so much competition.
the main goal of scam studies is marketing.
bizarrely, cassileth and deng don’t mention perhaps the most promising cam cancer treatment: melatonin.
as far as laetrile, i don’t have convenient nejm access that far back, although i’d love to see those issues.
our brains have learned to take shortcuts and jump to conclusions because of the survival value.
as someone who i suppose straddles the line, having an asian parent, and who lived in asia for a while, i can tell you that “non-western” folk are just like us.
what that means is that, if such a study could be done today, it is very likely thatlead time bias would significantly increase the apparent median survival, because increasingly tiny tumors are being found.
in contrast, the vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer die within the first year (more than half die within six months); fewer still live beyond two years; and very close to none live beyond three years.
http://aac.asm.org/cgi/content/full/47/12/3713 when this author presented this work at a conference, i asked for his comment on how his no/nox results in urine might reflect on the effectiveness of a golden shower regarding uti status.
in fact, harriet seems to be quite good at writing posts that provoke a lot of comment, as another of her posts, specifically the one in which shediscussed circumcision, also garnered hundreds of comments.
unlike most “skeptics,” i do not believe that most people are self-deceiving fools.
but even if this were true, one would be correct in stating that to date, no effective acc has been identified.
i wouldn’t reject it just because it sounds odd.
sometimes health fads catch on for a while, but if they are truly useless they will die out pretty soon.
that is why they have no role in science-based medicine at present.
so if a cam researcher manages to get some funding in spite of your all-out ideological war, and if they demonstrate effectiveness, you will say well maybe it works but, since it has now been scientifically verified, it isn’t cam.
you are wrong — people make stupid mistakes because the world is complicated and our data is limited.
in contrast, lots of women with metastatic breast cancer live longer than two or three years; a few.
second, and more importantly, it strongly suggests that foregoing or delaying surgery or chemotherapy is at the very least associated with a significantly decreased chance of recurrence-free survival.
i was saying that traditional people who do not have a western scientific education are nevertheless capable of being reasonable and making scientific observations.
i actually very much approve of the fact that the investigators did not define relaxation, psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, etc., as “alternative.”
in a cox regression model adjusted for demographic, disease and treatment factors, the hazard ratio of death for any use of am compared with no use was 1.30, (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.99, 1.70; p=0.056), suggesting that am use may predict a shorter survival.
the correct way to supply more no is topically where it feeds into the natural physiological pathways that regulate it.
very superstitious, wash your face and hands the point that dr hall was trying to make, and which you agreed with, was that there needed to be some sort of a priori plausible physiology behind a treatment before going into clinical trials.
most trails had small sample sizes; thus a type ii error is conceivable.
“they do not want cam treatments and ideas to be tested scientifically. ”
moreover, although there is a relative paucity of studies, and they, too, are generally retrospective and difficult to interpret, what evidence is out there is that alternative medicine use among cancer patients is associated with an increased risk of dying from cancer, particularly when conventional therapy is eschewed.
in addition, one year survival is very short term in the context of many cancers such as breast (with a mean recurrence time of seven years) and a much longer trial would need to be conducted.
or a busy person, as you seem to have no means for quickly dismissing the idea of giving autistic kids urine shots.
the paucity and the often-low methodological quality of the rcts are as unexpected to us as they are disappointing.
putting it all together, i conclude that there is no compelling evidence for a significant survival benefit due to any “alternative” therapy, nor is there good evidence for significant treatment effects.
if it were possible to be perfectly scientific, it would still not be possible to know the “truth” because we never have enough data.
we can be more efficient by using such mental shortcuts, but occasionally they mislead us.
incidentally, one of the coauthors, seely, is a naturopath who published a very critical review of chelation therapy.
you “skeptics” think the reason people make stupid mistakes is because they have not been educated into the scientific elite.
non-western traditional people do not use harmful or useless medical treatments repeatedly over thousands of years because they have confused correlation with causation.
independent verification is incredibly important.
you “skeptics” think the reason people make stupid mistakes is because they have not been educated into the scientific elite.
second, and more importantly, it strongly suggests that foregoing or delaying surgery or chemotherapy is at the very least associated with a significantly decreased chance of recurrence-free survival.
the first finding was that the methodological quality of the studies was, by and large, pretty low.
these days, most tumors are detected at far less advanced stages; indeed, most are detected by mammography.
the profit margin for the overhyped multivitamin is much higher than for the elective vaccine, and the manufacturer could still lose their shirt over it if they can’t recoup their research and development costs due to the high price.
the 1970s from the fda commissioner is not compelling either, and similarly doesn’t seem to make the toxicity clarification.
for example, shark cartilage extract neovastat (now disproven), polysaccharide k (approved in japan, so arguably not cam), and perhaps antineoplastons.
i don’t know, but i do know that i’m always very skeptical about results that come from only one group of investigators.
they do not want cam treatments and ideas to be tested scientifically.
true, they may pop up again in their surgeon’s or primary care doctor’s office with huge, fungating tumors, only to be told that they have to undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor before any surgery is possible, after which they will often disappear again.
the point that you seem to be missing here is that the scientific method came about to compensate for those recognized human vulnerabilities.
on the other hand, anecdotes and testimonials are not scientific evidence.
or: bear bile for rejuvenating brain cells.
and in this way you can always claim that no cam treatments work, and cam research should never be funded.
but we do not see ordinary people going around doing ridiculous things because they have confused correlation with causation.
nitter therapy consists of vitamin b12, gammaglobulins, tranexamic acid, multivitamins and nutritional supplements.
this occurs at levels well below that necessary for bactericidal effects.
the terminal metabolite of no is nitrate, and that is excreted in the urine, so urine is a source of nitrate as well as a source of urea (which becomes ammonia on hydrolysis).
first, it confirms once again the importance of surgery as a therapeutic modality for breast cancer, especially early stage.
this characteristic would make larger clinical trials of melatonin feasible.
at best, anecdotal evidence can be hypothesis generating.
neither would the myth that things go crazy around the time of a full moon (it’s been studied; there are, for example, no more er visits on average around the time of a full moon than any other time).
103) were able to find only ten reports, all from the lissoni group, that analysed melatonin definitively alone or in combination with standard therapies.
mysteriously, their veteran researcher kanematsu sugiura found it effective in several animal experiments.
smart human beings do it too.
i feel comfortable in saying that if there was an “alternative” treatment with a plausible basis in science, or it the underlying basis for an apparently implausible treatment could be plausibly supported, and it had not already been properly tested, you wouldn’t find any of the authors on this site opposing high quality testing of that treatment, and if those high quality trials showed it to be effective, the treatment would become part of scientific medicine, perhaps requiring a rewrite of our knowledge of science and medicine.
a recent meta-analysis found that melatonin “reduced the risk of death at 1 yr (relative risk: 0.66, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.73, i2=0%, heterogeneity p<or=0.56).
taken together, these data make it very hard not to conclude that at best the vast majority of alternative therapies are either useless, no more than placebos, or might even be harmful.
(it is, of course, these women who usually show up in “alternative medicine” testimonials, because they can survive a long time with little or no treatment before their tumors progress.)
the most common deficiencies included: lack of power sample calculation; small sample size; lack of adequate randomization and/or (patient and assessor or only assessor) blinding; and insufficient follow-up periods.
five-year specific breast cancer survival of women who refused surgery was lower than that of those who accepted (72%, 95% confidence interval, 60%–84% versus 87%, 95% confidence interval, 86%–88%, respectively).
in any case, it raises red flags that virtually all of the positive studies of melatonin as a breast cancer chemotherapeutic agent come from a single group, lissoni et al.
furthermore, the disease progression caused by the delay in surgery was associated with an increase in the estimated 10-year mortality rate.
i actually very much approve of the fact that the investigators did not define relaxation, psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, etc., as “alternative.”
you do not need any scientific training to do this kind of analysis — everyone does it every day.
yes i know we deceive ourselves, as i already said, but not because we aren’t scientific enough.
so this drives them towards complicated, expensive chemicals anyway, which can give the impression that they somehow prefer selling things that are very expensive despite the lower profit margin that comes with that.
in this way, you can block cam treatments from getting through the initial stages of careful scientific investigation.
yet we are able to sort out cause and effect well enough to navigate complex everyday life.
modern urine therapy likely has no beneficial effects and the current practitioners of it don’t realize it.
the hypothesis of the study was that the use of alternative medicine does not have any effect on the survival of cancer patients, and to test the hypothesis
science is just a formalization of the way people naturally think; it is not different from the normal logic and common sense that all people in all times have possessed.
a total of 515 patients were analyzed, and results were as follows: in january 2001, survival data were obtained with a follow-up of 8 years for 515 cancer patients.
i’ve also read about the chichimeca indians drinking the urine of their chief after he consumed a hallucinogenic mushroom in order to experience hallucinations.
online, an online tool into which clinicians can enter prognostic factors of a breast cancer at the time of presentation and come up with an estimate of chances of survival and recurrence with and without treatment.
the profit margin for the overhyped multivitamin is much higher than for the elective vaccine, and the manufacturer could still lose their shirt over it if they can’t recoup their research and development costs due to the high price.
in fact, harriet seems to be quite good at writing posts that provoke a lot of comment, as another of her posts, specifically the one in which shediscussed circumcision, also garnered hundreds of comments.
i am a skeptic and i do not make up my mind about things just because i follow a certain ideology.
no the experiments aren’t blinded and controlled, but they’re still experiments and they still give valid results in the long run.
if any “alternative” medicine can make the cut when subjected to scientific scrutiny, both in terms of evidence supporting its efficacy against disease and of a scientifically remotely plausible mechanism that can be studied, we will then consider it to be part of sbm.
the meta-analysis concludes that melatonin significantly reduced the risk of death of these patients at one year.
patients also had the opportunity to add other types of alternative therapy in response to an open question.
well, that pretty much clinches it for me.
from the 15 studies ernst examined, this is what was concluded: the totality of the data fails to show a single intervention that would be demonstrably effective as an acc.
when organizations like ncam perform real rcts and find no value in whatever “snake oil”, the scam community condemns the findings (see all of the sen harkin related posts).
