objectives: to compare the effectiveness of medical and chiropractic care for low back pain patients in managed care; to assess the effectiveness of physical therapy among medical patients; and to assess the effectiveness of physical modalities among chiropractic patients.
[22] the active approach used by the physical therapy staff  may be responsible for the relatively better 6-month disability outcomes  experienced by the physical therapy patients.
no clinically significant differences in outcomes between chiropractic  and hospital outpatient care were found in the meade et al
chiropractors at the study site use the same general type of spinal manipulation taught in most chiropractic schools and used by most chiropractors in the united states.
cherkin et a [l9]  reported no differences between chiropractic and mckenzie physical therapy  groups during 2 years of follow-up in terms of pain and disability, and these  groups had only slightly better outcomes and much greater costs than did  patients in the control group receiving only an educational booklet.
the authors of a well-designed observational study concluded that among patients with low back pain of less than 10 weeks duration seen by primary care physicians, chiropractors, and orthopedic surgeons, pain and functional status outcomes were similar at 6 months, and costs were higher for patients of orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors.

the authors of review papers and treatment guidelines have concluded that acetaminophen, [5,14] nsaids, [ 5,11,14,28,49] muscle relaxants, [11,49] conditioning exercises and certain aerobic activities, [5] and spinal manipulation [5,40] may provide shortterm benefit for patients with acute low back pain; nsaids, [ 49] exercise therapy, [19,49] and spinal manipulation [49] may be of some benefit for patients with chronic low back pain.
[ 36,49] adverse reactions are much more frequent in patients taking medications than in patients receiving nonmedication comparison treatments.
medical and chiropractic care without physical therapy or physical modalities  yielded similar improvements in pain severity and disability after 6 months of  follow-up.
despite the burden that low back pain places on patients, providers, and society, the relative effectiveness of common treatment strategies offered in managed care is unknown.
[10,12] the medical providers prescribe nsaids, muscle relaxants, and narcotic analgesics, which is the typical treatment approach used by primary care physicians for patients with low back pain.
medical providers, chiropractors, and physical  therapists outside this network may differ in their approaches to low back pain  care; and patients under fee-for-service, workersâ€™ compensation, personal  injury, and other reimbursement models may differ in ways that affect treatment  outcomes.
physical therapy appears to be more effective than medical care  alone for reducing disability in some patients after 6 months, but the  magnitude of this possible benefit is not large.
conclusions: after 6 months of follow-up, chiropractic care and medical care for low back pain were comparable in their effectiveness.
also, patients who chose not to be randomly assigned may differ from participants on factors that modify treatment effects.
a recent randomized clinical trial comparing osteopathic care with standard  medical care in amanaged care setting found equivalent pain and disability  outcomes among patients with subacute (3 weeks to 6months) low back pain after  12 weeks of care, but there was greater prescription medication use in the  medical care
nevertheless, our study population is similar to other outpatient low back pain populations in terms of average baseline level of back pain [9,29,30] and baseline level of disability resulting from back pain.

[38] concluded that acute pain patients were  better with chiropractic at 3 weeks; chronic patients were better with physical  therapy at 3 weeks; and there were no differences between groups at 6 months.

assessment of the costs and potential risks  associated with each treatment strategy would be helpful in more fully  understanding the roles of medical providers, chiropractors, and physical  therapists in the treatment of low back pain.
overall, there are only small differences in low back pain outcomes  between the treatment groups in this population of largely subacute and chronic  pain patients.
[21] because many of the medical care with physical therapy patients in our study did not receive physical therapy, the intention-to-treat analysis may have underestimated the magnitude of this effect.

- six hundred eighty-one patients presenting to a managed care facility were randomly assigned to medical care with and without physical therapy and chiropractic care with and without physical modalities; 95.7% were followed up through 6 months.
the mean changes in low back pain intensity and  disability of participants in the medical and chiropractic care-only groups  were similar at each follow-up assessment (adjusted mean differences at 6  months for most severe pain, 0.27, 95% confidence interval, -0.32-0.86; average  pain, 0.22, -0.25-0.69; and disability, 0.75, -0.29-1.79).

[34] in patients with  chronic pain, physical therapy and medically supervised exercise were found to  be better than unsupervised exercise in terms of pain intensity, functional  status, and cost per sick day after 12 months following 3 months of therapy in  norway.
the  findings suggest that physical therapy patients may have greater reductions in  disability, on average, than do patients in the medical care-only group from 6  weeks to 6 months, resulting in relatively better 6-month disability outcomes;  however, these small differences may be chance findings and may not persist  with continued follow- up.
key points - a randomized clinical trial was conducted among low back pain patients to compare the effectiveness of medical and chiropractic care; to assess the effectiveness of physical therapy among medical patients; and to assess the effectiveness of physical modalities among chiropractic patients.
[48] the greater value of supervised exercise for patients with  chronic low back pain is also supported by another recent trial that followed  patients for 2 years.
