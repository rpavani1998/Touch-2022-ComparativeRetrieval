the elastic properties of this tape help in many ways: improve contraction of a weakened muscle reduce muscle fatigue and spasm reduce over-stretching and over-contraction of muscles re-educate muscles through sensory feedback lessen edema (swelling) through aiding the lymphatic system minimize post-traumatic or post-surgical bruising through improved  circulation help mobilize scar tissue by enhancing glide between tissue layers help correct joint mechanics through aiding muscle function around the  joint relieve pain by activating the natural analgesic system in our skin  receptors as a part of physical therapy, kinesio taping is best used as an adjunct to  therapy and exercise.
the first technique gives the practitioner the opportunity to  actually give support with full range of motion that enables the individual to  participate in physical activity with functional assistance.
