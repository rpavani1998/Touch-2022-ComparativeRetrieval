chiropractic was found to be more effective, especially for those with "short current episodes, a history of back pain, and initially high [pain scale] scores."
patients received chiropractic manipulation, physical therapy (pt), or a booklet on self-managing back pain.
published from january 1994 through june 2003 citation description findings hurwitz et al., 2002 randomized clinical trial (rct) of patients in a managed care organization compared chiropractic care (with and without any of the following added: heat or cold therapy, ultrasound, electrical muscle stimulation) with conventional medical care (with and without physical therapy added).
participants (1,633) had acute pain of less than 10 weeks' duration.
the outcomes for those who received manipulation or pt were better than those who received the booklet, but "only marginally better."
however, authors concluded overall that none of the changes in physical outcomes measured was significantly different between groups.
greater improvement was found in the manipulation group than in other groups.

meade et al., 1995 rct of 741 patients who came to chiropractic and hospital outpatient clinics in 11 centers forlow back pain.
the manipulation group had the most improvement in flexion and pain.
time to recovery was "essentially the same," regardless of who provided the care.
patients (164) were treated for three weeks and evaluated through various standardized instruments and examinations.
other chiropractic research on back pain focused just on adults with the condition.
participants (178) had lbp for either longer than three weeks but less than six months in a current episode or more than two months within the preceding eight months for recurrent lbp, and were evaluated three weeks and six months after treatment.
participants (170) hadlow back pain (lasting seven weeks or longer or consisting of at least six episodes in 12 months) and were evaluated for pain and activity tolerance at enrollment, after two weeks of treatment, and after two weeks of no treatment.
back pain intensity and back-related disability were measured.

hsieh et al., 2002 rct compared four treatments forsubacute low back pain (lbp): "joint manipulation" by a chiropractor, back school (program of counseling and exercises), myofascial therapy, and joint manipulation plus myofascial therapy.
after six months of follow-up, the conventional medical care and chiropractic regimens were found to be comparably effective.
enrollees (174) were measured for low back pain, disability, and functional health status at 5 and 11 weeks.
