treating patients in the clinic.
a regular exercise program combined with good posture can prevent many problems.
the treatment of muscles has the greatest effect on reducing pain mechanisms in the nervous system.
the local twitch response elicits a very brief (less than a second) painful sensation.
again, we are trying to cause mechanical and biochemical changes without any pharmacological means.
typically, the soreness lasts between a few hours and two days.
imt is a western medical technique that is based on scientific studies and knowledge.
a myofascial trigger point consists of multiple contraction knots, which are related to the production and maintenance of the pain cycle.
getting local twitch responses with imt is the first step in breaking the pain cycle.
muscles are thought to be a primary contributing factor to the symptoms.
most patients do not feel the insertion of the needle.
such conditions include, but are not limited to neck, back and shoulder pain, arm pain (tennis elbow, carpal tunnel, golfer's elbow), headache to include migraines and tension-type headaches, jaw pain, buttock pain and leg pain (sciatica, hamstrings strains, calf tightness/spasms).
most patients do not feel the insertion of the needle.
the musculoskeletal system is under constant pressure from gravity, stress, work etc.
in the us, imt is a relatively new method for treating myofascial pain and not everyone is already aware of this effective modality.
if the pain comes back, "tune-ups" are recommended to treat and prevent serious injuries.
the musculoskeletal system is under constant pressure from gravity, stress, work etc.
based on the pioneering studies by dr. jay shah and colleagues at the national institutes of health, we know that inserting a needle into trigger points can cause favorable biochemical changes, which assist in reducing pain.
it is essential to elicit so-called local twitch responses, which are spinal cord reflexes.

again, the therapeutic response occurs with the elicitation of local twitch responses and that is a good and desirable reaction.
