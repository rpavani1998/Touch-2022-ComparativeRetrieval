in the case of arthritic joints, increased ligament strength would allow the joint to function more efficiently, reducing pain.55 in a review of 13 randomized trials, researchers concluded that massage may be effective for nonspecific low back pain, and the beneficial effects can last for up to 1 year in patients suffering from chronic pain.preliminary evidence suggests that proteolytic enzymes might be helpful for back pain.surgery may be recommended in certain cases, such as when there are severe disc problems, but most forms of back surgery also lack reliable supporting evidence.however, there is little reliable evidence that these treatments actually provide much benefit.chronic back pain requires a medical workup to make sure there are no serious underlying causes, although evidence suggests that, in most cases, x-rays are not necessary.in a review of 23 randomized trials involving over 6,000 patients with chronic low back, researchers concluded that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment for short-term pain relief, but there was no significant difference between the effects of true and sham.however, there is some evidence that the technique may be beneficial when combined with other therapies.other studies have failed to find benefit as well; in several controlled studies enrolling a total of over 300 people, real acupuncture again failed to prove more effective than sham-acupuncture or other placebo treatments.52 in a review of 23 randomized trials involving over 6,000 patients with chronic low back, researchers concluded that acupuncture is more effective than no treatment for short-term pain relief, but there was no significant difference between the effects of true and sham.a review of the literature found no more than weak preliminary evidence that alexander may help with back pain, but concluded that further research is warranted.however, thus far, research has not produced clear evidence of acupunctureâ€™s effectiveness for back pain.on a positive note, one study of 100 people with back pain and sciatica symptoms (pain down the leg due to disc protrusion) found that chiropractic manipulation was significantly more effective at relieving symptoms than sham chiropractic manipulation.the results showed that while the use of alternative therapies improved patient satisfaction, it did not significantly improve symptoms.in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling 215 people with back pain, use of a topical cream made from the herb comfrey produced statistically significant benefits as compared to placebo.
