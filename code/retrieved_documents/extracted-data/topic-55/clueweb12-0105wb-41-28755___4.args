cherkin et a [l9] reported no differences between chiropractic and mckenzie physical therapy groups during 2 years of follow-up in terms of pain and disability, and these groups had only slightly better outcomes and much greater costs than did patients in the control group receiving only an educational booklet.
the mean changes in low back pain intensity and disability of participants in the medical and chiropractic care-only groups were similar at each follow-up assessment (adjusted mean differences at 6 months for most severe pain, 0.27, 95% confidence interval, -0.32-0.86; average pain, 0.22, -0.25-0.69; and disability, 0.75, -0.29-1.79).
[27] although this study also showed managed care and fee-for-service reimbursement do not appreciably affect utilization patterns, [27] an earlier survey of physical therapists demonstrated differences in treatment preferences and visit frequency by practice setting.
