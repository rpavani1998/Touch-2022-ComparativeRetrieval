i care about sbm so i comment when i see it being abused and misrepresented by anyone – advocates of cam, cargo cult science bloggers such as yourself who use all the same fallacies and techniques as advocates of cam, and shills for big pharma or big scam.
neither did i realize until i visited ask dr amy again that she actually sells all kinds of baby products on her site as well!
even penn and teller (who i also admire) on passive smoking.
if you agree with amy’s stance on toxins, chlorine leaching into the soil and groundwater shouldn’t be a problem.
i find it strange that anyone would imply that we haven’t seen a huge impact on life expectancy from the effect that medicine has had on so many diseases.
during that time we were evolving too– gaining things like lactose tolerance and improved grain digestion.
“harriet said that some herbal treatments are (or could be) an exception to the general statement that alternative medicine as useless, though they are inferior to their pharmaceutical counterparts.”
another thing that has bugged me is that people started trying to discredit dr. teteur’s statement that life expectancy was 35 years old by showing proof that were people who lived to be older than 35.
1-dr tuteur appears to use the blogosphere to promote herself as a product (a book, an iphone application, “personal advice” for sale on her own blog).
likewise, we can easily eat things not available to all cavemen that provide us with an expanded nutrient repertoire.
so his thesis is not irrelevant to amy’s contention that everyone died young before modern agriculture and medicine.
clearly some people in the past in all kinds of societies and cultures enjoyed their lives very much, there are all kinds of records that show this to be true.
if people died before that age, then of course cad would be rare.
ah but you keep acting like an apologist and making excuses for why his bad science is okay because you think he’s promoting “common sense”
as jmb described above, the greatest successes in medicine have been achieved in preventing and treating the diseases of childhood, and to a lesser extent, the diseases of early and middle adulthood.
this reminds me of a presentation i attended by a dermatology resident who was into all natural treatments (not sure how she got into derm).
they look at contemporary populations living in isolated areas and their diets might not be representative of the “average” paleolithic diet.
or, as amy says, we are now able to cure or prevent the things that children used to die from, something that ‘ancienct wisdom’ couldn’t do.
it did not matter that the ancestors of those who cooked meat had not done so.
for instance, all those 3rd-generation east-asian immigrants in north america who are so much taller than their grandparents.
the union of concerned scientists are not science based from what i have seen.
as the owner of a site that runs google ads myself, i know that you have virtually no control over what pops up–often to great frustration.
having worked in a science department at ag school that did work on organic production methods, let me tell you they were’t using horse-drawn ploughs.
it doesn’t matter that we were originally hunter gatherers.
smallpox, for example, became widespread, and the hunter gatherers (along a few groups were farmers, but not of livestock) of north america were decimated by it.
this is not a problem unique to yourself, and frankly, there are bloggers who put up with a lot more than a few hundred e-mails a day.
dr tuteur – “as jmb described above, the greatest successes in medicine have been achieved in preventing and treating the diseases of childhood, and to a lesser extent, the diseases of early and middle adulthood.
“anyone familiar with contemporary medical literature at the turn of the 20th century also knows that native african and asian populations suffered very little from diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and cavities, but saw rapid increases in all of these diseases upon the adoption of the western “industrial agricultural” diet.”
if 12% of adult londoners were able to survive to 70, i’m impressed.
otherwise, if you assume that women contribute to a healthy (=large?) society primarily or solely by the number of infants we generate, there would be no menopause.
that would not mean that the diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get heart disease and type ii diabetes.
it is possible that agriculture, at least initially, lead to a bigger population, but a lower life expectancy because of infectious disease.
medieval medicine being what it was, on some level i’d rather be a peasant without a doctor than nobility with someone who will bleed me repeatedly and make me take gross, unproven remedies.
(van der waal has some interesting insights from a group of chimps where the most aggressive males were killed in an accident, leaving the “beta males” behind to reproduce.
the failure rate is for that small chance you’ll ovulate before menstruating, but many women have an anovulatory period the first time.
no, foxglove and willow bark are alternative.
okay, amy said cam was useless (which means that herbal treatments are useless, no?).
anthropologic studies give us rough estimates of disease incidence and mortality as a function of age, as well as information about how diet, exercise, and behavior has changed across time, or in different cultures.
is it not possible, and reasonable, to say that human lifespan has been greatly increased by childhood vaccination and other useful medical interventions, but also that our average lifespan (not to mention happiness) could be increased still further if, for example, we tried eating and working and living in a manner more in line with our biology?
wiki several studies offer evidence that a low fiber intake is involved in the pathogenesis of appendicitis[14]
if you want to use romanticized reasons to eat raw roots and meat, i won’t complain.
blood letting mostly* wasn’t good for them and human sacrifice was most definitely not good for them.
that’s because, simply put, farming is easier than hunter-gathering.
of course, the advent of agriculture wasn’t all good.
i think plonit was being tongue in cheek with her comment about dr. tuteur’s ad revenue.
but there are definitely advantages and lower infant mortality rates in agricultural socieities, as well as much higher birth rates (1 per year [ag] vs. 1 per 3-4
i have not disputed the fact that agriculture allows larger populations to be supported.
that would mean that the paleolithic diet was good for preventing heart disease and type ii diabetes.
because harriet qualified her comment and, if she had have had even more time to be even more precise, she would have qualified it even more (i know because, unless i’m badly mistaken, i have seen her do so in the past).
the archaeological evidence suggests, for example, an almost uniform crash in average heights when populations make the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture (in crete, for example, average heights for men went from 5′9″ pre-agriculture to 5′3″ afterwards).”
plenty of doctors change their practices based on the latest evidence, the majority do i’d suspect (though i have no evidence of that one way or the other).
yet with the ability to master fire came the ability to cook meat and release even more nutrients.
that said, i’ve always found the google ads on skeptic sites to be very funny since they’re almost always advertising woo of some kind.
it means that what is “working” is the placebo effect itself, not the drug/herb/whatever.
as a consequence, i’d have to see a highly controlled study that shows the superiority of a modern diet, because the observational evidence goes the other way.
it doesn’t do any could to always be skeptical of fringe ideas and always being accepting of conventional ideas and vice versa.
she repeatedly says that cancer and heart disease are normal diseases of aging.
the past may not have been a golden age, but it doesn’t follow from that that we have nothing to learn from it.
kung and masai compared to their agricultural neighbors is eye-opening.
i thank modern medicine every day for the mircale baby that she is.
i am alive today because of modern medicine (adding to the unscientific poll).
we may achieve greater success in reducing incidence of at least some types of cancer by advances in gene therapy, than by modifications of diet, exercise, and behavior.
of course, it is more entertaining to argue romanticizing the past versus scientific method, than to construct a model of disease.
so much for the evolutionary advantage of the hunter gatherer diet: it has led to the near extinction of the hunter gatherers.
very unlikely to have been up that high if he had been pre-industrial, so moot wrt benefits of life-saving industrial technology.)
(fortunately you don’t speak for all doctors nor do you actually represent medicine, you’re usually simply promoting your personal ideological position and resentments under the guise of standing up for sbm.)
here’s why: the claim is that (in regards to paleo diet) a) people of yesteryear ate “better” as per their reliance on natural foods; and b) avoided diseases as a result of that; and c)
agriculturalists have access to grain.
they don’t have to be perfect; they just have to improve the odds.
it is not being fanatical or fundamentalist to say that modern americans tend to be very unhealthy and dependent on medical treatments.
some of the patients in the study may never develop overt diabetes if they stick to the paleo diet.
[...] diet and exercise will delay the onset of type ii diabetes in most but not all patients.
i can point to my own famiy history where my grandmother has an older half-sister, my great grandfather’s first wife died, he remarried to my great grandmother and she raised her stepdaughter and her own children.
evolutionary medicine, in contrast, recognizes that the human body is the result of competing evolutionary pressures and changing pressures of natural selection.
i see her as saying that , even if the diet eaten in paletolithic time was the ideal diet for no heart disease, etc it didn’t help protect the paleolithic people from sucummbing from non-dietary related illnesses and accidents that shortened the lifespan because of the paleolithic people did not have the medical knowledge and medicine to treat or cure those illnesses and accidents.
at some point, they became skilled hunters and were able to obtain meat.
the h-g diet was plant based, while our diet is more meat based- this probably isn’t the healthiest way to live, not to mention the inactive lifestyle we industrialists follow.
and for prehistoric cultures, we really don’t know, and it probably varied greatly.
sounds pretty much like a confirmation bias and, consequently, as if you’re being an apologist for someone you agree with.
full of piss and vinegar or she “tuts” her own horn…witch doesn’t make any cents…d’oh by the by….
since children with genetic defects tend to die very early, and since childbearing is associated with a high risk of death, it makes biologic sense for ovulation to wind down when the quality of ova diminishes.
my point being, i am definitely eating fewer calories than i used to, but it’s very natural to do so.
i’m not fan of the garden of eden fantasy and find the noble savage idea that has become popular to be incredibly condescending (not to mention rather colonialist).
there’s also a great-great-great (i think i’ve got that right) uncle who had 17 children by three different wives.
if i understand alex’s interpretation of sbm, the lack of one very high quality study controlling for all variables, means that there is insufficient evidence to draw any reasonable conclusion.
the evidence that doing well on any particular diet conferred an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors would have to come from several sources, but it wouldinclude evidence that we do well on that diet compared to other diets, all else being equal.
but i just had to contribute because dr. t always exaggerates the wonderfulness of modern life, and always said everything was horrible before modern medicine and technology.
graunt found that the average life expectancy in london was 27 years, with 65% of people dying before age 16, the vast majority due to childhood infectious diseases, diseases, i note, that have now been largely brought under control by vaccines, antibiotics, and advances in medical care.
my point was that alex knapp provided no support for the implied claim that reduced average height in the population of the scenario he presented was a result of stunted growth in the same thread in which he criticized amy for not using citation to peer-reviewed research and analysis.
# alex knapp on 19 feb 2010 at 5:43 pm amy, no, those papers don’t demonstrate that, nor could they.
his objection to kyoto is that it accomplishes too little, too late (not the argument of a global warming denier!), and that it costs money that could be used to save lives today with simple but effective measures like malaria-preventing bed nets.
as jmb described above, the greatest successes in medicine have been achieved in preventing and treating the diseases of childhood, and to a lesser extent, the diseases of early and middle adulthood.
went on hbp meds and bp has been perfect ever since.
most of the time, though, i write new material for sbm.
this is what makes it clear that you’re using sbm as a soapbox and to try to legitimize a personal agenda and are not actually a champion of sbm and reality-based thinking or trying to educate the public about sbm.
show me a infectious disease that you believe would still be an important cause of infant/childhood mortality were it not for modern medicine and i’ll demonstrate you how you’re incorrect …and i’ll give you lots of data “menopause makes most sense if you assume that it makes at least a small core of women not tied down with infant care available to guide and support a group of younger mothers”
surely that’s no different than using homeopathy or other forms of cam (though patients being given pharmaceuticals that are no better than placebos are just as attached and convinced by their experience and “feeling better” as people given cam treatments that are no better than placebos…it’s human nature
with special feature on medical technology.
dr. t’s writing is fine for the back of a cereal box, but i had come to expect more nuance from the bloggers here because of the more knowledgeable readers.
dr. hall: “his critics have responded to errors he made, but they have not responded to his main points which would still be valid if all those errors were corrected.”
i live in a very cold climate, and have a great deal of concern about interruption in the supply chain to my local coffee roaster.
then there’s also the fact that at least one grandparent of mine and both parents were raised with their cousins when the cousins’ parents either died or were unable to afford to care for them.
they have never had any evidence in support of their claims other than “personal experience”, and it’s only pure luck when they do get things right on the odd occasion.
but for fun, *no one* on this planet is the same as the humanoids of 200,000 years ago.
over hundreds of thousands – or millions – of years, for chronic diseases of aging to not be able to exert any selection pressure at all, everyone must die young.
“by your definition, prilosec is alternative medicine because you can buy it over the counter.”
living in tahiti or a fertile valley is quite different than living in the arctic, though people survive and thrive in both environments.
sexual selection would select for health.
more children suffered infections at hardin village than at indian knoll.
also, conflating medicine with pesticides and commercial farming just doesn’t make any sense.
obesity, diabetes, asthma are all chronic diseases that have nothing to do with aging.
not only that, sbm also attracts some interesting commenters and discussions.
if people are just seeking to feel better or get some support making lifestyle changes (i’m not talking about cures here) then going to see someone who pays attention makes them feel better.
a reader gets the impression that dr amy is a practicing ob-gyn, but just can’t give advice because she hasn’t personally examined the person or reviewed their medical records.
perhaps publishing in peer reviewed journals in your medical specialty could be quite beneficial for advancing science and academia in your field, especially since other researchers have got it wrong in numerous cases?
there is no reason to think that what we ate was the ideal diet; it was merely the available diet.
i can simply not adopt a religion at all and accept reality for what it is.
the result was a much more cooperative, less aggressive social group that ended up having a larger population than similar chimpanzee groups because there was less violence among the chimps.)
there is a ton of research that suggests improved health for modern humans who follow a diet that models the macronutrient composition of h-g tribes.
personally, i think the difference is almost entirely due to (1) and that (2) introduces problems of disease and malnourishment.
i thank modern medicine every day for the mircale baby that she is.
the cube-farm dwellers suffer health effects from lack of exercise, so they use their agriculture-and-fossil-fuel-enabled technology to build themselves gyms and take sulfonylurea drugs.
that assertion is not only irrelevant but actually works against you because the other poster is talking about contemporary humans eating a paleolithic diet and preventing heart disease is very relevant since we do live longer!
# bluedevilra on 18 feb 2010 at 10:51 am alex knapp, for being so critical of dr. tuteur’s lack of citations, you do a poor job yourself.
it definitely is not reliable as a form of birth control.”
and i think we should always be our best)…..ok i will just get back to my endless dictations, for my ridiculously low pay and wonder if i shouldn’t be the next vitamin guru this sight seems to help preserve some semblence of sanity.
i suspect, but do not know, that alex and others are concerned about the dangers of “industrial farming”.
still, in general, lactation is the best bet for birth control if you don’t have access to anything else.
additionally, agriculture allowed the development of cities and technology.
to blithely assume that modern life is, in every respect, superior to life in the past based on life expectancy alone is ridiculous.
if dr. tuteur had said something like that, she would have been challenged to prove it and accused of merely spouting a personal opinion, having a fundamentalist bias against technology, and not being science-based.
michele: i think the theory is that the “environmental thing” is a toxin thing via chlorine leaking into landfills and groundwater(which makes sense to me).
better living conditions, nutrition, sociable justice and sanitation were instrumental in this.
i do believe that other scientists have asked questions about your statistical analysis in previous blog articles.
the scientific question that i could understand from the article was how much is the changing incidence of disease between past populations and current populations due to changes in diet, exercise, and other habits, versus the factor of aging of the population, and modern medicine which contributes to the aging of the population.
(and am well aware that it’s more likely a software thing and not a personal attempt to silence – self mocking sarcasm on – my oh so powerful commentary because dr tuteur is so scared of my insights and how i challenge her deeply held beliefs!
it doesn’t even have to be them, it could be some entrepreneurs applying their model of agriculture.
in these circumstances the taboo against sex with a lactating woman is very strong.
basically his diet advice (based on a combination of research on diets from all over the world, not just western high fat, high carbs) is “eat food.
human beings and their ancestors have been around for millions of years, and for most of that time, they did not eat meat.
especially: eliminate flour, sugar, vegetable & seed oils.
she pointed to our prehistoric ancestors and said that they were fine without using soap.
like most species, we cope with our premature death rate by having enough babies to make up the difference, but it’s probably fair to say our wild life expectancy was in the order of 70 years, barring illness or accident or famine.
they may not have had the best cancer diagnostics in the 1920s, but they could and did find tumors during autopsy, and they could and did compare the prevalence of tumors in the “native diet” v. “western diet” among the same population in the same region.
# amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 1:35 pm “show me a infectious disease that you believe would still be an important cause of infant/childhood mortality were it not for modern medicine and i’ll demonstrate you how you’re incorrect” smallpox.
no, but you can look at turn of the century comparative research on heart attacks of native v. western populations within the same region.
even with a lower growth rate, human hunter/gatherer societies managed to cover most of the planet.
but i was aware you also blogged under a (notorious) pseudonym elsewhere because you mention it in your bio.
the reason that the doctors and scientists who read sbm don’t criticize my posts is because the aren’t published in peer reviewed journals?
as for animals they hunted — maybe they over hunted one year, or new predators moved in, or the animals moved on in search of food.
there are a significant number of good researchers out there hypothesizing that at least some incidences of type ii diabetes are caused by a diet high in grains and refined carbohydrates over a number of years.
fine, if that is her take she should be proud of her provocative “fox news” style and stop with the simultaneous persecution complex that readers are trying to “censor” her (tres bizarre).
however, i think that it’s a mistake to completely write off the past and romanticize the present as being the best human society, in every aspect, that ever existed.
i was trying to give you a friendly word of advice that you might be a little too heated at the moment.
also, i agree that the spread of disease was an unfortunate side effect of the growth of cities, the increase in farm production, and the increase in trade.
(on another site when readers asked her whetherunique hits are also important as a measure, and whether her writing style is effective in driving unique hits as well as total hits, she declined to respond.)
dr hall – actually, what you said was that it didn’t influence your own position that circumcision is harmless (if i remember correctly) since that’s what was being argued about since it was your opinion on circumcision that was being discussed.
i don’t particularly take issue with that if you’d both be honest about your personal biases (with yourselves and us) instead of insisting that your personal opinions or beliefs are evidence based when they’re not.
someone could have an accident, get wounded, and the wound becomes infected and then they die.
among elderly kitavans, incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia are incredibly low.
your head must be deep in the sand not to see them.
amy tuteur on better health: “that would mean that the paleolithic diet was good for preventing heart disease and type ii diabetes.
for example, i wanted to see about fasting workouts, so i tested bg prior, at 24 hours fast (80s).
or the children could be sent to live with relatives who could afford to take care of them.
in a population of humans eating the only diet available to them over the course of, say, 100,000 years, heart disease will exert selection pressure to eliminate genes for susceptibility to heart diseaseunder those particular conditions from the gene pool only if 1) people can live long enough to get heart disease under those conditions anyway, and 2) people who are resistant to heart disease have more grandchildren.
for me the issue is that she sells medical advice online as part of her ask dr amy brand (and it’s as a “premium service”).
few of us can resist some jibes and hyperbole when feeling strongly about the subject matter.
even though health has been improved dramatically, we recognize that it can be improved even further.
in the meantime, life in crowded medieval and industrial cities could be quite disgusting and unsanitary, killing babies and otherwise-healthy young people.
we could change that situation, and in the process reduce the risk of diseases like diabetes (not a disease of old age these days).
remember, evolutionary success is measured by number of living offspring, not by length of life.
plonit – seems to me, that’s why i didn’t understand medical or ethical and am not sure if dr hall was making a distinction or really meant to write “medical and ethical”.
# beatis on 18 feb 2010 at 5:06 am i have not worded my previous comment accurately enough; i don’t mean to say that “mommy instinct” equals national-socialism, but that it is part of the way of thinking that consistently overvalues “natural” vs “scientific”.
and i don’t know if high blood pressure counts, but i went in to the doc two years ago for a check up and he said my bp was so high it was “stroke worthy.”
death after that would not be an evolutionary disadvantage.
medicine certainly hasn’t been successful in preventing these diseases and industrialization can very reasonably be argued as a contributing factor.
this could, perhaps, be due to better, more readily available nourishment, or maybe it was due to a lower probability of being killed by one’s prey if you were tall and strong (assuming tall=strong & fit).
your friends by playing a tune on a piano versus reading a book by electric light and listening to music on or even watching a movie on a digital music player.
many people i love and care deeply about have chosen to not vaccine their children, go to naturopathic doctors, any use homeopathics.
that’s fine: an obstetrician is not an anthropologist.
they may contain unintended contaminants such as arsenic, lead or mercury or deliberately laced with actual pharmaceuticals.
if you don’t have nuts where you live, the plant material available for your baby is low-protein and low caloric density.

it didn’t matter that the ancestors of the first meat eaters didn’t eat meat.
romanticizing science and “modern medicine” as all good and conflating it with industry is just as romantic and simplistic as doing so about nature.
amy said that alternative medicine is useless, and later defined alternative medicine as that which is useless.
i instituted that method to cut down on the hundreds of personal e-mails i otherwise get each day, and it has been very effective.”
there are old apes that have useful roles in their group.
based upon ratios and proportions of vital events and consideration of the way in which these changed in different circumstances, his analysis is amazingly free of major statistical errors.
medicine has increased lifespan but not from the fanciful 35 years amy imagines.
sure, but i’m not too worried that they are since you’ve been unable to back up your claims with any peer-reviewed research.
expecting everyone to say not much, she was a little shocked when i shouted, “they died at 30.”
i’d much rather read about science than some pseudo psychoanalysis of some made up group.
i fasted twice per week while losing the weight and now i do it once per week, 18-30 hours, typically.
the disclaimer from your site says, “disclaimer: dr. amy does not and cannot provide medical advice.
further, it’s rather odd that the claims in the blog are taken as true with no research evidence, but anybody who questions the conclusions must provide iron-clad data (although these commenters are rising to the challenge, even if it’s not reciprocated).
what is your evidence that they are merely the products of age apart from mere correlation to incidence within age groups in the united states? # amy tuteur, md on 19 feb 2010 at 2:30 pm sid, i’m still waiting for you to provide the statistics that show smallpox disappeared spontaneously and not as a result of vaccination.
okay, correcting myself here, because obviously this makes no sense.
reverse ip: 283,150 other sites hosted on this server.
i will grant you that some populations are lactose tolerant, but that’s an easier evolutionary leap since all human infants produce lactase, and so selection for individuals who continue to produce lactase isn’t much of a leap.
it’s worth familiarizing yourself with if you’re interested in science and good magazines (though their fondness for humanism and art, and some other factors, does make me positively biased towards them).
this conferred a tremendous advantage because it provided a more nutrient rich food source.
michele – “i thought the chlorine free aspects of diapers was more of an environmental thing (chlorine processing, bleaching, going into groundwater, etc).”
or, hunter-gatherers moved around and didn’t have to worry much about sewage.
this data agrees with the assertion by dr tuteur that modern medicine accounts for a significant fraction of the improvement in life expectancy.
the final winner to the argument is based on the ability of the model to predict observations in the future.
therefore, it is safe to assume that the increase in life expectancy is nonlinear, even though we lack reliable population data before 1900.
amy’s criticism of sid is ironic given that his link to an article by dr. simon szreter of cambridge is relevant, educational and on topic, more so perhaps than the opinions she has generated here.
it’s possible that termites eat wood because that’s all that’s available to them, but that they would be much healthier as individuals and larger as a population if they were to eat whiskey instead because it has higher caloric density.
however, one doesn’t need to be provocative to teach critical thinking, one needs to teach people how to research, analyse and the basic cognitive traps we fall into that create biases that get in the way of seeing reality or the facts for what they are.
but if you think survival is impossible if people die at 45, consider the fact that in societies without good access to medical care, the maternal death rate can be as high as 10%, so clearly there is a fairly significant risk that a child won’t just become motherless before 16, but may come into the world motherless.
amy has not produced evidence for her statement, but my evidence for my belief that there were people who lived to old age in the past is pretty skimpy.
i’m paid for my other blogging gig.
# bluedevilra on 18 feb 2010 at 3:26 pm oh no, sid, don’t do the “well the diseases were on their way and vaccines had little effect” gambit.
lillym – i agree that romanticising the past and nature is silly.
i thought the whole point of saying that we were using science-based medicine is to break out of the false dichotomy of alternative vs conventional health.
they can’t be “more genetically fit” if that’s all there was.
so it’s still hypocritical to sell these products.
while that’s true, it doesn’t change the fact that the archaeological evidence demonstrates that theincidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer societies than in agricultural ones.
when the average life expectancy is low, the rate of chronic diseases of old age is low.
i would assume that the editors will continue to allow different styles, whether provocative or more nuturing.
when i looked up ownership of the site, it was indicated that she also owns other domain names.
also, saying that the placebo effect means “it doesn’t work” isn’t accurate and is overly simplistic – particularly when talking about something as subjective as treatments for pain or depression.
it’s clear that we mostly do better when we don’t get infectious diseases (with the possible exception of helminths in some populations).
anybody that wants to minimize their risk of diabetes which watch their diet.
we are fortunate that through the advances of science and agricultural techniques that this can mean different things for different people.
(this list could go on and on…) if so, foregoing any of these would have increased your risk of, if not led directly to, a potentially fatal outcome “reality is starvation, scavenging, and scurvy.”
if a mother didn’t have her own income, her children breakfasted on leftovers from supper — and that was it until they were old enough to stay up and eat supper with the grownups and get two meals a day.
that may be true for most blogs, but my impression was that sbm tries to distinguish itself from the pack.
however an sbm blogger really should be giving full disclosure regarding their commercial interests and associations – being transparent about one’s associations is a pretty basic part of being ethical in science and sbm blogging too!
from my personal research to date, i think that the evidence demonstrates that we ought to (a) keep modern medicine, because it’s awesome and (b) emulate to the best of our abilities the traditional diet of hunter-gatherer societies using the tools of modern food production.
“show me a infectious disease that you believe would still be an important cause of infant/childhood mortality were it not for modern medicine and i’ll demonstrate you how you’re incorrect” smallpox.

ma made it through 5 pregnancies.
to be fair, conventional approaches, such as physiotherapy, also struggle to treat back problems with any consistency.

they are still prey to the same illnesses and accidents, but now they can be effectively treated.
we would just keep popping them out until we keeled over.
the present study illustrates graunt’s careful scientific approach, his ability to extract the essence from what by modern standards are distinctly untrustworthy demographic data, and his intuitive appreciation of the amount of interpretation his findings would tolerate.
if we want to constantly reduce complex issues with areas of scientific uncertainty to sensationalist opinion pieces that contain no scientific evidence on an sbm blog we have no grounds to complain when the msm does it (in fact, we’re bigger hypocrites).
i’m not quoting these statistics for precision, but merely to show that life expectancy sucked until fairly recently even for adults.
you want to make sure that other readers of sbm can’t read what i write.
the diseases of hunter gatherer societies don’t tend to be influenza, tuberculosis, smallpox, but things like chagas disease.
i suspect i represent others who have remained quiet out of politeness until now.
even more importantly, if i’m right, he has a lot less control over his health than he’d like to think.
had surgical removal of the dead baby not been possible, she could never have become pregnant again (at least not safely).
many childhood strep infections — and my paternal grandmother died of rheumatic heart disease.
group dynamics also get selected for from an evolutionary perspective.
additionally, the stuides done between native and westernized populations in the early 20th century were controlled for age and still found lower prevalence of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease in those eating a tradtional diet vs. a western one.
people who survived childhood in pre-modern times were likely to get old, and they were not likely to get heart disease or cancer.
herbal treatments are useless.
overall life expectancy of the kitavans is 45 (because like most populations without access to modern obstetrics, infant mortality is high)–which the u.s. did not match about 1900.
(trying to block publication, e.g.) i do detect a bit of split mind from amy.
of course, lomborg’s book is so riddled with errors of science that it should not be taken seriously: http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/skeptical.htm http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/02/lomborg_beats_gore_110_to_2.php http://thingsbreak.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/willful-idocy/ some appear to be deliberate: http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/examples.htm just to be clear, i’m not advocating for cam, i’m advocating understanding why people use it, why they believe it works and why the fact that little bits and pieces of it here and there kind of work (or harness certain techniques from behavioral psychology intentionally or accidentally) and can be useful enough to people to lead them to believe the larger cam narrative and naturalistic fallacies and garden of eden fantasies (you know, the kind that sell island vacations too).
they have the money to start farms and growing food to compete with big agra.
it definitely is not reliable as a form of birth control.”
yes, i’ve been reading your blog for quite some time and it is very easy to rack up many comments with the heated discussion there.
i don’t even know where my salt shaker is, and am a healthy weight and don’t smoke, so i don’t really have any risk factors.
doctors’ experiences in training are not uniform.
in our modern world, but it seems like more of an effort for people than those living in the past who had a slower-paced life, no choice but to do physical labour, and the main food available was the nutritious food from their farm/garden.
those populations were then able to drive out h-gs from their native territories because they had larger armies, even though h-gs were generally taller and stronger.
it’s likely that starvation, death by animal attacks, death in childbirth, malaria in tropical regions, and sepsis in wounds were more common than influenza (from pigs and chickens), smallpox (from cattle), or tuberculosis (also cattle).
or the children could be sent to live with relatives who could afford to take care of them.
i follow another blog that has multiple writers and there some writers i automatically scroll past, i don’t like their writing style, i don’t agree with them so i just let it go.
no, what i was initially after was you actually writing like an sbm blogger and not some sort of cargo cult woo merchant who resorts to the same fallacies as extremist cam advocates when critiqued.
but if you think survival is impossible if people die at 45, consider the fact that in societies without good access to medical care, the maternal death rate can be as high as 10%, so clearly there is a fairly significant risk that a child won’t just become motherless before 16, but may come into the world motherless.
it’s another sign that dr tuteur is making an ideological argument that’s simply a reaction to an equally ideological argument rather than actually considering reality.
low serum insulin in traditional pacific islanders–the kitava study.
dr tuteur – “therefore, you wish to censor me.
going back to fifi’s point about mark crislip’s post being so perfect there was nothing for a commenter to add, my feeling is that amy deliberately writes sloppy posts with many indefensible absolutes.
that doesn’t mean i’m romanticising life as an ant.
these observations represent the 1st, as well as an extremely competent attempt, to draw scientific conclusions from statistical data.
they are still prey to the same illnesses and accidents, but now they can be effectively treated.
in populations with nutrition-related growth restriction, men and women are of similar height because there is not enough surplus food to fuel a complete male adolescent growth spurt.
amy says: the difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine everybody else says: fertility and mortality in the united states michael haines, colgate university http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/haines.demography the mortality decline since the late nineteenth century seems to have been the result particularly of improvements in public health and sanitation, especially better water supplies and sewage disposal.
the first sign is the lack of a growth spurt during the early teen years.
this is false for several reasons: first, most of our major diseases that strike hunter-gatherers today came from domestication of animals and spread by cities and long-distance trade; we don’t really know what our own hunter-gatherer ancestors died of in terms of infectious disease.
they can’t be “more genetically fit” if that’s all there was.
no, you’re the one who keeps presenting either/or scenarios and extremist and high generalized naturalist vs industrialist fallacies and simplistic nature vs sbm fallacies regarding everything from diet, exercise, psychology and neurobiology and even extending into childbirth and circumcision.
however, it was true that the population of the agricultrual society was higher.
it is more accurate to say that he is promoting good science but made some mistakes in a field that he is not an expert in.
this includes massive deaths of humans, which obviously doctors don’t like.
hey jj, from just that paper, you’re right–the researchers didn’t distinguish between the diet and the change in exercise levels, and i wouldn’t use just that paper to prove my thesis by itself.
it seems that those critical of amy’s style are so for the same reason that sbm bloggers (including amy) criticize the general media inaccuracies when reporting on science and medicine: the brevity and sensationalism of science and medical reporting generally found in the media does not lend itself to the accurate communication (qualifiers and all) of a complex topic.
these observations represent the 1st, as well as an extremely competent attempt, to draw scientific conclusions from statistical data.
lomborg’s mistakes were so glaring, both in quantity and quality, that they easily bring into question his entire thesis, the “common sense” aspects of it notwithstanding, and, more importantly, his mistakes are consistent with allowing an ideological agenda override science.
likewise, we can easily eat things not available to all cavemen that provide us with an expanded nutrient repertoire.
while there are obvious benefits from eating a diet that consists of more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins, it does appear that longevity and resistance to cardiovascular disease and dementia have a very strong genetic component to them.
copy and pasting a link, which might impress lay people, carries no weight here.
it is safe to surmise that public health measures and modern medicine (as well as changes in population habits) can take credit for the more recent improvement in longevity.
alison, i also have read that hunter-gatherers cannot carry their children long distances, so they tend to have less of them (due to lactational ammenorhea, assuming).
dr tuteur seems to have a prejudice against non-pharmaceutical or surgical treatments and, for some strange reason exercise and a healthy diet.
blood letting mostly* wasn’t good for them and human sacrifice was most definitely not good for them.
they look at contemporary populations living in isolated areas and their diets might not be representative of the “average” paleolithic diet.
when people do have neurological damage that removes emotion entirely from the decision making process it causes all kinds of real world problems.
(and areas where dr tuteur is quite obviously not an expert herself, she quite often proposes quite old fashioned and reactionary ideas that aren’t supported by contemporary scientific understandings or that don’t take into account complexity and the limits of current knowledge.
but i know most of the paleolithic diet supporters did not descend from those groups; they are well-evolved to eat whole and stone-ground grains, honey, beer and malted grains, fermented everything, vegetable and seed oils, milk, cheese, and yogurt.”
it may also not have been available due to weather conditions, pests, etc.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhx1b5mfykg # thehandsomecamel on 18 feb 2010 at 4:09 am my understanding is that the vast majority of that difference in lifespan is accounted for by infant mortality and, to a lesser extent, deaths from other childhood diseases.
so once again i say that the available evidence suggests that we could promote better health by keeping the advantages of modern medicine, while at the same time steering our agricultural industry and diet to one that emulates the macronutrient constitution of a paleolithic diet.
to make a recommendation for a patient based on scientific evidence requires a rigorous approach by the professional doctor to evaluate scientific evidence.
no admission that he got facts wrong here, just that “his critics” said he got it wrong.
so – human lifespan has actually not changed much.

because they don’t threaten my personal or professional identity, nor do they confer status to me or take it away, nor do they influence my income in any way.
she also ignored the well-known fact that pharmaceutical companies got caught red handed cooking data around ssris (surely relevant to the discussion).
sarcasm off/ that said, she does seem to mistake critique of style or content as a personal attack and be fond of using ad hominem attacks against researchers she’s writing about and doesn’t agree with.)
the past is a big place.
i suspect that there is a lot of evidence that shows that before the introduction of “modern methods” of farming, many people died of starvation because enough food could not be produced the old way.
it has also worked wonders for my parents, my mom getting off insulin as a t2 and my dad getting off about 6 meds now, including bp meds he’d been on for 30 years.
now, i have no desire to hop into a time machine to live in the past and i appreciate how far medicine and scientific knowledge have advanced even in my own lifetime but to assume that all throughout history before now that life was “hell” is just ridiculous!
at the simplest level, very few people were able to keep their teeth into middle age, let alone survive that long.
middle brother: hospitalized with nephritis; kidney failure would be a horrible way to go * youngest brother: resuscitated after crashing at 4 months of age; two months in icu, respirator, tracheotomy, naso-gastric feedings, formula since mom went dry due to the stress, numerous surgeries to repair the trachea….
you do acknowledge that unnecessary c-sections can increase maternal morbidity.
“because the archaeological record is replete with similar stories, as are historical accounts”
of course, their isolation left them susceptible to our diseases, and when they eat stuff like milk and sugary snacks they have health problems.
the problem is that cam practitioners often take a little bit of science and then exaggerate it greatly (that’s what makes it pseudoscience, whether it’s cam or big pharma doing that kind of thing).
those with education degrees can discuss that.
hence the cargo cult aspect of her presenting as an sbm blogger.
yet in the lindeberg 2007 study i cited above, it’s worth noting that of the type ii diabetics who were given a paleo diet, every single one had normal fasting glucose levels and normal insulin sensitivity by the end of the study.
i have cites in my other office but not on the computer i’m working from now.
if we do better on a diet that was available to us for 200,000 years than we do on a variety of other diets, that would be part of the evidence that our bodies adapted to make the most of that diet.
basically he’s saying life spans haven’t really increased, it’s just that lots of children used to die.
it may seem harsh in a blog, but i can guarantee it is tame compared to medical school (although medical schools may now be much kinder and gentler).
as to temporal declines occurring after vaccination remember correlation does not equal causation finally this is not to say vaccination, when practiced properly with actual vaccine, did not work or have an impact, simply that, as a major cause of mortality, smallpox was on its way out vaccine or not @wales to listen to amy you’d think this guy was cliff clavin spouting off at cheers http://faculty.jhsph.edu/default.cfm?faculty_id=310 sid offit: “for actual data see welch and miller homage to vaccines, acute contagious diseases”
this shows that while diets vary broadly among modern h-g cultures, the macronutrient compositions are, in fact, quite similar.
i think her broad brush “cam is useless” is pretty good in achieving that result.
farming conferred a tremendous advantage.
2003;13;149-160 (compares the health of modern hunter-gatherers in comparison to modern folks in agricultural society and finds a marked absence of hypertension, diabetes, cancer, etc.)
oh, and on your intro to the board, there were several medical doctors who were “stunned” that sbm had chosen you.
you don’t need to demonstrate that the past was hell and nature is a bitch in order to demonstrate the illogic of the natural fallacy and the traditional fallacy.”
the mean intake of calories in these groups is around 2800-3200 calories.
i find that i keep commenting hoping that someone (editors perhaps) will get the message that this blog is making a choice between “getting hits” and credibility and that not all readers are happy with that choice.
dr hall – you’re providing a very fine example of how an intelligent and educated person can be seduced by pseudoscience when it confirms their “common sense” feeling or opinion about a subject.
and finally, you can check out a very good review article here: loren cordain, s. boyd eaton, anthony sebastian, neil mann, staffan lindeberg, bruce a. watkins, james h. o’keefe, janette brand miller.
hey, even when there’s the odd confirmation bias or ideological issue it’s usually pretty minor and doesn’t really impact the actual science being discussed.
i’d highly recommend you read the cassidy article i cite above, which compared the archaeological evidence of two groups of native americans in the same region, of which one was a hunter-gatherer society (referred to as “indian knoll”) and the other was agricultural (referred to as “hardin village”).
what amy may have meant was that even if a paleolithic-style diet protects against chronic disease in post-industrial societies, it did not do so in paleolithic societies because everyone died before chronic disease could have affected them anyway.
i do know there are active worldwide and national efforts to lower the c-section rate because of possible increased neonatal and maternal mortality and morbidity from elective cesareans.”
after all, those qualifiers do not alter the basic conclusion that herbal treatments are useless.
as dr. tuteur aptly states, we evolved to eat what was available.
her writing and the responses generated will have to speak for themselves when it comes to quality and bias.
dr. hall: ” i understood him to say that there are various predictions of the extent of global warming and that some of those predictions may be overly alarmist, that it is simplistic to only look at the bad consequences and fail to take into account even the possibility of some good consequences, ” this point, for example, must be backed up by correct science.
there is also evidence, on the basis of funnel plots, of publication bias that could account for most of the percieved benefits of herbs.
the british chiropractic association claims that their members can help treat children with colic, sleeping and feeding problems, frequent ear infections, asthma and prolonged crying, even though there is not a jot of evidence.
it may be that aspects of life in the past, coupled with modern advancements, would lead to a healthier life.
they may be using various methods to reduce birth rates to keep group size manageable.
people who do so are willing to sacrifice editorial control in return for the income generation.
as per fifi’s point above, if it turns out that a) there is something that it makes sense to call a “paleolithic diet,” and b) that it coincidentally is associated with lower rates of heart disease in people who have access to modern medicine, then c) a plausible hypothesis would be that evolution preferentially selected for paleolithic humans who had lower rates of heart disease when eating the diet available to them.
bariatric surgery has been shown in some small series to revert type ii diabetes more effectively than diet/lifestyle changes, but that probably reflects patient compliance as well.
(you’d have the added benefit of not maiming and killing people in wars and polluting the environment and drinking water, sounds like a win win situation.
the key seems to be less food but very nutrient rich.
off the top of my head i can remember reading about a young polish girl deported by the russians along with many other poles to siberia during the second ww where there was no soap, cambodians living without soap and british nurses held prisoners by the japanese during wwii who didn’t have any.
the attending would often make a statement that would result in a lot of discussion, but a lot of errors in thought processes would be revealed and opened up for criticism.
relying on the meager evidence of the distant past to guide our actions is a fruitless exercise that is overly romanticized; the “spirit” of the post.
oh, and some of my sbm material is not new: i have reprinted or linked to articles i have written for skeptic, e-skeptic, and skeptical inquirer and to the powerpoint presentation i gave at the skeptic’s toolbox.
it may be that aspects of life in the past, coupled with modern advancements, would lead to a healthier life.
he is responsible for the 1st scientific estimates of population size, the concept of the life table, the idea of statistical association, the 1st studies of time series, and a pioneer attempt to draw a representative sample.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhx1b5mfykg my understanding is that the vast majority of that difference in lifespan is accounted for by infant mortality and, to a lesser extent, deaths from other childhood diseases.
please explain how i have glorified my birth choices and point to where i have ever demeaned other women who make different choices.
further, no one could get green tea, acai berry, seaweed, tomatoes, pomegranates, fish, raw cocoa, quinoa and almonds all in the same area.
however, this would be the time frame and location in which we might expect to see an effect of modern medicine on longevity.
i have not disputed the fact that agriculture allows larger populations to be supported.
more food can be produced more quickly, thus supporting larger populations.
even if agriculture can support more people, it wouldn’t be surprising if they were smaller, at least in some circumstances.
this may be partly because a certain percentage of humans have always been weak and vulnerable to disease, because that’s life.
secondly, the “we evolved to eat only what we could hunt and gather” gambit is a ridiculously romantic portrayal of early humanity.
it surely is strange for an sbm blogger to get revenue from googleads for services such as thishttp://felopio.com/
this is why elders are revered cultures without a written language, and it may well be that the survival of that knowledge garners an evolutionary advantage to humans.
it definitely is not reliable as a form of birth control.
speaking for myself personally, since i adopted this manner of eating, i have lost a significant amount of weight, my ldl levels have gone down, my fasting glucose has gone down, and my blood pressure has gone down.
the other thing we can do is look at our ape cousins who are hunter-gatherers (both chimps and bonobos).
actually, quite a few have examined the peer-reviewed, scientific evidence and noted that, when you control for the problems of infectious disease and infant mortality, people on a h-g diet exhibit more robust health and have fewer incidences of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
i am willing to believe her when she talks about obstetrics, especially since in this field she is familiar with the literature and is clear about her sources and the bases for her statements.
other animals, such as ants, for instance, can live in large communities without having the same s***-related problems that humans do.
they have had a strong selective pressure to be faster, stronger, and less prone to local diseases.
at the very least, dr. tuteur has certainly not proven her assertion that the increase in average “lifespan” (the wrong word anyway, it’s life expectancy) can be accounted for by industrial farming practices (like pesticides).
# fifi on 18 feb 2010 at 4:51 pm i’m not fan of the garden of eden fantasy and find the noble savage idea that has become popular to be incredibly condescending (not to mention rather colonialist).
this conferred a tremendous advantage because it provided a more nutrient rich food source.
if a faculty member is faced with a student who don’t seem to be making adequate progress in developing critical thinking, then the teacher might resort to a different method of teaching (moving from a nuturing style to a more provocative style).
dr tuteur – my repeating my analysis of the way you communicate can certainly be brushed off as personal opinion.
yet with the ability to master fire came the ability to cook meat and release even more nutrients.
if we do better on a diet that was available to us for 200,000 years than we do on a variety of other diets, that would be part of the evidence that our bodies adapted to make the most of that diet.
“and the main food available was the nutritious food from their farm/garden”
consider that while presidents adams and jefferson lived to an advanced age, william henry harrison died of pneumonia only 10 days after his inauguration.
grains supply approximately 2-4% of their calories as protein and 1-4% of calories as fat.
otherwise, if you assume that women contribute to a healthy (=large?) society primarily or solely by the number of infants we generate, there would be no menopause.
i personally want the best of both worlds – the benefits of modern medicine combined with the robust health of the h-gs who were able to survive disease, trauma and other people to have robust health into their 70s.
as usual, this post is as overly simplistic as the “all nature is pure” folks’ viewpoint.
copy and pasting a link, which might impress lay people, carries no weight here.”
as to differences between harriet’s style and amy’s, give me long-winded and accurate any day, over short, strident and inaccurate.
on top of that you’re damaging in terms of public perception of sbm since you are an ideologue abusing sbm as a platform to promote an agenda.
karl, if you review the literature on modern h-g societies, you will discover that the incidence of cancer, heart disease, and strokes are much lower than in modern agricultural societies.
although eating cariogenic carbohydrates is a risk factor for developing cavities, it’s not the only factor.
if we extrapolate the current measured rate of improvement in longevity backward in time, we would end up with an intuitively ridiculous life expectancy of zero somewhere between 1850 and 1750.
a palaeolithic diet improves glucose tolerance more than a mediterranean-like diet in individuals with ischaemic heart disease.
# alex knapp on 18 feb 2010 at 10:05 am what a disappointing post in what is overall a wonderful site.
while the indicence of type ii diabetes definitely increases with age in the united states, i have a hard time describing a disease that impacts 10.8% of the population between the ages of 40-59 as a “disease of old age.”
i think it’s safe to say that people *were* generally as healthy then as they are today, as long as they didn’t have any serious accidents, get seriously ill, eat spoiled food, drink tainted water, get snakebit, die in childbirth, get in infection, be unfortunate enough to have a congenital defect, etc.
i’d assume that there would be remarriage and the stepmothers would take care of the younger children as well as any children she had.
but it is true that decreasing infant mortality has had a disproportionate effect on life expectancy, since saving one child may add 70-80 years to their life.
just as contemporary pollution contributes to both disease and death – this is one of the trade-offs of living in a city during any time.
i grew up around general medicine, neuroscience and psychology so what interests me is the cognitive aspects and what is actually going on vis a vis placebo effects.
“because the archaeological record is replete with similar stories, as are historical accounts”
the insights being gained from the field of evolutionary medicine contrast dramatically with the evolutionary claims of “alternative” health advocates.
there may be another reason why menopause developed.
based upon ratios and proportions of vital events and consideration of the way in which these changed in different circumstances, his analysis is amazingly free of major statistical errors.
i read her comment and i didn’t read it the way you interperted it.
my sister was taken into care by the children’s aid because it was feared that her stepmother would kill her and her older sister.
it’s clear that we mostly do better when we don’t get infectious diseases (with the possible exception of helminths in some populations).
one hypothesis to explain high rates of heart disease in aboriginal canadians today is that they are not adapted to a grain-based diet.
by your definition, prilosec is alternative medicine because you can buy it over the counter.

i’m not super familiar with them, but would like to know more.
so far sid’s citations are the most educational thing about this post.
# sid offit on 19 feb 2010 at 2:07 pm amy says: so the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease and type ii diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything else.
metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet.
the percentage of his mistakes is small compared to the percent of facts he got right, and correcting those mistakes would not be enough to change his arguments.
fitness is about the production of successful offspring and the population boom in the last 100 years has clearly shown that the evolution of agriculture benefited us as a species.
when confronted she keeps digging herself in deeper: it is laughable when she claims: “and scientific consensus may be irrevelant to you.
amy, i’ve been a reader of sbm for half a year or so and enjoy your articles.
] i think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.”
overall life expectancy of the kitavans is 45 (because like most populations without access to modern obstetrics, infant mortality is high)–which the u.s. did not match about 1900.
the best measure of evolutionary success is population growth, and by that measure, agriculture was an extraordinary triumph.
i think it’s safe to say that people *were* generally as healthy then as they are today, as long as they didn’t have any serious accidents, get seriously ill, eat spoiled food, drink tainted water, get snakebit, die in childbirth, get in infection, be unfortunate enough to have a congenital defect, etc.
humans are social animals, and even in hunter-gatherer groups, children are looked after by more than just their parents.
if you regularly have prominent advertising for scam products…then you have some responsibility for that…no one forces anyone to carry googleads.
use the thing that’s achieving the effect – understanding, empathy, compassion, psychology etc “also, saying that the placebo effect means “it doesn’t work” isn’t accurate and is overly simplistic – if a placebo is relieving someone’s pain or depression it is working since the end goal of any treatment for pain or depression is to relieve pain or depression.
in any case, even if true, it doesn’t mean women usually made it past menopause (nor does it mean that men did).
the insights being gained from the field of evolutionary medicine contrast dramatically with the evolutionary claims of “alternative” health advocates.
her post on antidepressants not only accused psychologists of having nefarious intentions but entirely ignored the professional context of the discussion within psychology and psychiatry about anti-depressant use.
they will probably counter that, yes, today we are getting better at finding ways of living longer with our unnatural, unhealthy lifestyles.
in the case of “alternative” health, this is relatively easy to debunk since we have copious historical evidence on death rates, disease incidence, etc. jmb, thanks for the data and the explanations!
i agree with whoever said that it’s also dangerous to romanticize the present.
it’s like epigenetics, sports medicine, cognitive science, pain medicine, evolutionary biology, environmental health and so on simply don’t exist to dr tuteur.
jmb – i’d add that one of the most valuable things i learned growing up around science and medicine was that we simply don’t know all kinds of things.
i haven’t ever given in to the dark side of selling nutritional supplements or vitamins, but after hours of work, tons of dictations left, and a whole lot of wasted breath, i sometimes wonder if i shouldn’t just sell the damn things.
if everyone knows they *must* not be weaned then the extended lactation period will be actively protected.
the archaeological evidence suggests, for example, an almost uniform crash in average heights when populations make the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture (in crete, for example, average heights for men went from 5’9″ pre-agriculture to 5’3″ afterwards).
in the peacefully idyllic past, evolution actively tuned children to be in harmony with their pre-civilization environment.
that’s great, but (and this is a huge but) you have the ability to control access to food in a way that was not available in paleolithic times.
answers will change over time, but the principles of critical thinking have not changed since galileo.
that said, meditation for pain management certainly started out as “alternative medicine” and was viewed with suspicion (and still is by some reactionary types) and neurplasticity was denied by “modern medicine” for quite a long time.
(for example, plains indians were taller than the western calvarymen who waged war on them — see http://eh.net/xiiicongress/cd/papers/70princesteckel378.pdf).
it is a mistake in logic to assume that “progress” is some unilateral arrow, and that as some progress is made, all aspects of the culture progress at the same time.
yet without the western diet, many wouldn’t need medical interventions to survive.”
it is more accurate to say that he is promoting good science but made some mistakes in a field that he is not an expert in.”
dr gorski and dr novella also do a good job of explaining complex topics and taking on specific advocates of unscientific nonsense.
additionally, when comparative studies have been done of people who do not follow western diets, the prevalence of diabetes and heart disease is diminished even among the elderly compared to those with western diets.
if everyone knows they *must* not be weaned then the extended lactation period will be actively protected.
i like this site and many of the bloggers and i’m passionate about science in medicine (and i enjoy discussing things with many of the commenters here too).
sid, you’re just the kind of person about whom i am writing, those who imagine an idealized past without bothering to acquire any knowledge of what the past was actually like.
it’s highly personalize, sensationalist cargo cult blogging.
according to my review of the literature, diabetes and heart disease are primarily caused by diet.
as fact for the sake of argument since its factualness is not relevant to my point.
it does tend to give a unique flavor to discussions about science by medical scientists.
the improving diet, clothing, and shelter of the american population over the period since about 1870 also played a role.
the absence of a gatekeeper means that this category can contain a whole heaping pile of utter nonsense.
i caught malaria several times when i was in west africa.
then while checking pz myer’s blog i saw it again, with a link to a news article: book review: the lomborg deception ” did not know there was a book coming out against the “skeptical environmentalist.”
if this is what happened, that suggests that a not-insignificant proportion of the population got old,and that old people were genetically fit — that is, that they contributed to the survival of their relatives and the reproduction of their genes.
dr hall, clearly you share some political views with dr tuteur and feel aligned with her on a wide variety of subjects.
however, i believe that is another topic, one for now and the future, not one to use to measure how science, agricultural science and chemistry, benefited past generations.
plant to animal subsistence ratios and macronutrient energy estimations in world wide hunter-gatherer diets.
diet and exercise will delay the onset of type ii diabetes in most but not all patients.
(and, let’s be honest, some of the sbm bloggers here aren’t above at least poking – quite deservedly – some of the more ridiculous offenders with a stick…they generally just make sure it’s an evidence stick and not just the pointy end of their ego.)
in practical sense, this means defending your position, without putting down those against you, because even if their arguments are not true, there may be some truth to what they are saying.
things such as whether your grandparents lived through a famine will also have a genetic repercussion.
i didn’t know amy was not practising when i first read her articles.
of course, many mds, pain specialists and psychologists and psychiatrists also promote these kinds of common sense approaches to basic mental and physical health.
one hypothesis to explain high rates of heart disease in aboriginal canadians today is that they are not adapted to a grain-based diet.
i might die in a car crash even if i wear my seatbelt, but wearing a seatbelt certainly lowers the risk, so i wear one.
a hg of 10,000 years ago would be likely to be more adapted to a hg lifestyle that a hg of 100,000 years ago.
i don’t even know where my salt shaker is, and am a healthy weight and don’t smoke, so i don’t really have any risk factors.
she was on a vent for 5 days, cpap for 5 days, and oxygen for a month.
she died during pregnancy, either of typhus or a pregnancy-related condition.
my interest in meditation, nutrition and exercise isn’t because i’m an advocate of cam.
so i tend to leap in to stick up for these as being useful for chronic pain management and some forms of mental disorders since they do get denigrated even by doctors who are stuck in very old fashioned and simplistic understandings of chronic pain and neurobiology.

a lasting cure would be to alter the pathway (transplant islet cells, rejuvenate mitochondria, alter immune responses are the current hopes).
@bluedevilra the theory put forth by alex and others seems to be that h-g’s were more fit to survive because they lived long and healthy lives.
there’s also a great-great-great (i think i’ve got that right) uncle who had 17 children by three different wives.
i could be convinced either way, but he is the only one providing copious amounts of evidence for his position, while dr. tuteur only keeps repeating “but they died when they were 35!!!”
you keep answering coherent arguments and evidence with personalized attacks and grandiose assertions (“you’re all out to get me because you’re threatened” projection being a big and somewhat obsessive theme with you apparently).
http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2507 the percentage of his mistakes is small compared to the percent of facts he got right, and correcting those mistakes would not be enough to change his arguments.
the rise in incidence of these diseases is a sign of success, not failure.
it’s interesting that she seems to be a bit of an apologist for lomborg who seems to be a pretty classic pseudoskeptic posing as an expert in a field outside of his expertise who romanticizes technology/industry.
so, the stats that people died younger then seem accurate.
in addition, if alex’s thesis is correct, that would be a strand of evidence in the direction that in fact wedid live long enough that resistance to chronic disease would have beneficial.
# karl withakay on 18 feb 2010 at 1:23 pm alex knapp: “all else being equal, stunted growth is typically symptomatic of malnourishment.”
epidemiologists generally agree that communicable diseases were already decreasing when vax were invented.
“however, i find your posts annoying to read because of the reasons marco outlined above and because you’re a sloppy, sensationalist writer and entirely unreflective about your own biases and clearly have a lot of self worth and ego tied up in this image of yourself as a provocateur and “challenger”.”
medicine has increased lifespan but not from the fanciful 35 years amy imagines.
i must say though, that you’ve taken quite a condescending and belittling tone with sid as you demand citations for evidence.. “no, no, no, that’s not how you support a claim with scientific evidence.
plonit — it’s not so much that it’s time-consuming as that it’s like playing whack-a-mole.
if the genomical aging of an individual is accelerated, then the diseases tend to occur at an earlier chronological age.
they can accumulate capital, which offers protection against lean times.
some lucky people will never develop diabetes regardless of their diet.
alison, fairly enough, most of what is contained within the paleo diet is roundly accepted as nutritious food.
it is axiomatic in “alternative” health that the human body represents evolutionary perfection and that if we only hark back to nature we will be healthier.
we can move forward in some areas, but not in others.
# fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 2:52 pm lillym – i agree that romanticising the past and nature is silly.
in essence though, it’s kind of like nature vs. nurture, or phonics versus whole language.
(fortunately you don’t speak for all doctors nor do you actually represent medicine, you’re usually simply promoting your personal ideological position and resentments under the guise of standing up for sbm.)
you’ll throw anything against the wall to see if it will stick in the hope that you can convince yourself and others that they don’t have to listen to me.
weing, i used to think quantity mattered more, too, until i reviewed some of the literature on the insulin response to refined carbohydrates and its effect on the insulin response, as well as insulin’s role in fat storage and satiety.
harriet’s more accurate long version: “all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.”
plonit is a british midwife and she can reliably be counted upon to support the british midwifery line, regardless of whether it is based on scientific evidence.
diseases of old age can become primary causes of death only when diseases of infancy and childhood are vanquished, and that is precisely what has happened.]
they wouldn’t reach the age to develop clinically significant occlusions in their coronary arteries!
the same logic has been a defense of dr. tuteur- that her premises may be wrong, but her main point remains intact.
my wife’s sister, age 85, has some sort of adult asthma, which nearly killed her 8 years ago.
clearly she’s not exactly an expert or experienced vis a vis medical research (being a practicing doctor is different than being a researcher).
food can be cultivated more intensively, grain can be stored, babies can be weaned earlier.
it’s that i can have it handy at 8:00 at night when my beloved (who usually heals very slowly) has a dirty cut on his hand, and it’s not greasy and occlusive like drugstore antibiotic creams.
the kitavans of paupa new guinea provide an interesting counterpoint to your claims.
while the arguments that people promoting paleolithic diets make regarding evolution are rather silly, it’s just as silly to not consider how we evolved and what we naturally need for optimum health when looking at the best ways to stay healthy and happy.
or making a lucid, evidence based argument (which would involve presenting evidence in your initial post) for how medicine has improved public health and longevity.
you attack because you disagree and you lack any other ground to stand on.
then there’s also the fact that at least one grandparent of mine and both parents were raised with their cousins when the cousins’ parents either died or were unable to afford to care for them.
otherwise, it’s $14.95 for a detailed answer to any question about a woman’s health.
for what it’s worth, i agree with fifi that i am reluctant to recommend this site to others (i think that’s what she said anyway), at least not without a large caveat warning about certain bloggers.
statement you made: “all the existing scientific evidence shows that all of the myriad claims of alternative health are flat out false.”
with a little supplementation, an adult can live on bananas.
http://www.askdramy.com/premium.html fifi, lots of words, but no actual facts.
2 – rocky mountain spotted fever – vaccines saved a whole lot of people in my home town.
catholics who believe that good works on earth are part of the path toward salvation are condemned to hell because the fundie maintains that faith alone garners entry through the pearly gates.
this point is particularly bad: the difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods (including pesticides).
it was caused by extremely successful agriculture that supported a large (but impoverished) population that could not be supported by anything else.
the author may request such citations from responders, so that the critical review can be applied to such papers.
i tried to verify the claim, but unfortunately, your site is blocked at my workplace.
my personal definition of alternative medicine is stuff that i can access without a gatekeeper.
the thing is, the most important thing in environmentalism is land.
we should be able to acknowledge the disadvantages of our technology — for example, the average american doesn’t have the time or energy for physical exercise.
it’s true that the greatest evolutionary advantage of humans over other species is our behavioural adaptability.
further, no one could get green tea, acai berry, seaweed, tomatoes, pomegranates, fish, raw cocoa, quinoa and almonds all in the same area.
the reason why people keep going back to alternative health practitioners is that bits of it can work – not to cure cancer or aids of course, but certainly to help make people feel better or get into shape or make a necessary life change.
all the existing scientific evidence shows that all of the myriad claims of alternative health are flat out false.
# alison cummins on 18 feb 2010 at 1:24 pm there are ways to limit population growth besides having a baby every year and letting half of them die (the agricultural model).
# ericg on 19 feb 2010 at 5:18 pm i feel the spirit of dr. t’s post is intact, despite whatever complaints the usual suspects seem to have with whatever it is they complain about.
they also did not eat it in very large proportions.
i’ve rambled a bit here, but my point is that you can’t point to menopause as evidence that people were generally healthy five thousand years ago.
they may be romanticizing and trying to get back to nature in the wrong way, but it certainly can help describe why some people are interested in alternative health therapies.
bluedevilra makes a good point as well: “the problem is, most people don’t even realize when they receive treatment for life threatening diseases.”
although eating cariogenic carbohydrates is a risk factor for developing cavities, it’s not the only factor.
this could, perhaps, be due to better, more readily available nourishment, or maybe it was due to a lower probability of being killed by one’s prey if you were tall and strong (assuming tall=strong & fit).
the point is that h-g shouldn’t be romanticized, but neither should filthy industrial or agricultural communities.
probably would have been able to fight the infection anyway, but maybe he would have been too weak from low oxygen.
(oh well, unless their divorce is getting too nasty or the drinking is getting out of control) they actually argued the art and the principles.
knapp you have many links to provide but do a poor job presenting anything from them that is specific to your point and not diluted by the nuances of the work.
she said the average life expectancy.
other diseases also became more widespread because people lived closer together in one spot.
also, i rather liked dr hall’s blog because it advocated for (and she commended pollan’s book for supporting) a more balanced and practical approach to nutrition than we typically see in most special diets.
the premise of the paleolithic diet is not that it offered anyone an evolutionary advantage.
the perception of the size of that risk and its acceptability boils down to personal attitudes and risk-taking behaviors…there is no reason well-trained, well-equipped midwives could not deliver babies at home for those who prefer it and are willing to accept the small risk.
the fact of the matter is, those guys have really solid science backing them up.
however those who come after me repeatedly, who can’t resist the personal attacks, are fighting to hold on to cherished beliefs about themselves, not for scientific integrity.
in fact, the development of agriculture is arguably the greatest accomplishment of the human species.
and that most of us are still stuck with a lot of paleolithic genes.
# rosemary on 18 feb 2010 at 11:29 am alex knapp, “so it’s impossible to state that the difference in life expectancy is due to both modern medicine and industrial agriculture.
saying there is no evidence for x is not the same as saying there is evidence for not-x. i think dr. hall admitted that some of lomberg’s data was wrong, just that it didn’t make any difference to his “common sense” positions.
similarly, for most of human existence, meat was not cooked.
as you rightly point out, we have no idea if dr tuteur still holds a medical license and she does give the impression she’s a practicing ob/gyn on her site.
h-g faced the very real threat of malnutrition and hunger do to scarcity of food as mentioned above.
the active ingredients are present in variable amounts depending on the souce and season, and sometimes not present at all.
not that the authors of psalm 90 had access to good statistics, but the numbers seem to give a good indication of what was understood to be a normal lifespan at the time.
the point was that harriet and amy have the same views on what the science says (regarding herbal remedies), they just have a different way of communicting that view.
for most of human existence, according to fossil and anthropological data, the average human life expectancy was 35 years.
2 – rocky mountain spotted fever – vaccines saved a whole lot of people in my home town.
so i tend to leap in to stick up for these as being useful for chronic pain management and some forms of mental disorders since they do get denigrated even by doctors who are stuck in very old fashioned and simplistic understandings of chronic pain and neurobiology.
# lillym on 19 feb 2010 at 2:39 pm i also want to point out that i’ve seen people romanticize the past and how much healthier everyone ate and how much better and simpler life was
had a stent put in and is doing fine.
the rise in incidence of these diseases is a sign of success, not failure.
i guessed (“made up”) that sbm shared your goals and invited you on board at least partly for that reason.
he argues that science ought to be able to come up with more effective remedies than kyoto, and meanwhile there is much we can do today at little expense to improve human welfare more than kyoto could.
i also advocate being realistic about sbm and medicine in general.
dr hall – okay, you just asserted that the science he got wrong was no big deal and didn’t change anything he wrote in any meaningful way and any critiques of his science or ideas were “emotional”.
# codesculptor on 19 feb 2010 at 12:17 am i love when people try to use “look at all the notable people that lived to…” that is specious on several levels, because the notable people typically had more resources at their disposal.
if you regularly have prominent advertising for scam products trading on the misery of infertility (e.g.http://www.naturalypure.com , in addition to those already posted upthread) – then you have some responsibility for that.
it’s just sad that you’re doing this as an sbm blogger (but it’s also fascinating in that bug under a microscope way that watching pec implode used to be).
i’d say it is because you feel threatened by what i write and you are desperately trying to convince yourself and others that you don’t need to heed it.
that’s why we developed the scientific method and the tools we have, to get past the limitations of our own senses and kluge of a brain.
i say this because modern farming produces food that is less nutrient dense and higher in sugar content than existed even 50 years ago–to say nothing of extensive medical research in the early 20th century comparing the heath effects of native vs. western diets.
it enabled us to create cities and the specialization of labor, which subsequently allowed us to to develop modern science and medicine.
sure she makes her living as a midwife but she does so as a part of a medical system where she isn’t competing for customers and works cooperatively with obs.
sure, that’s unusual and extreme, but stepmothers are unreliable.
dr. tuteur also tends to garner hundreds of comments for the simple reason that she actually responds to people and questions.
it did not matter that the ancestors of those who cooked meat had not done so.
the only times he’s right about science, imho, is when the industry position on an issue happens to be closest to the best scientific position, for example, on vaccinations.
me: one of her premises is that c-sections do not lead to higher maternal mortality (perhaps morbidity)”
industrial vegetable oils high in pro-inflammatory omega 6 fatty acids some ate mostly carnivorous (masai, inuit), while others thrived on roots, fish, and coconuts (kitava, tokelau).
i know nothing of the compensation agreements between the sbm bloggers and what i gather are affiliated entities science blogs or seed media, or what corporate entities might be contributing to science blogs and seed media and sbm.
other animals, such as ants, for instance, can live in large communities without having the same s***-related problems that humans do.
also, it’s just stupid to say life in the past was “hell”.
when the average life expectancy is low, the rate of chronic diseases of old age is low.
in fact, i had never been paid for any of my writing until this january when “o, the oprah magazine” started paying me to write a short column.”
children have a lot of demands on the limited amount of food they can consume: physical maturation, exploring, learning, fighting disease, hunting and gathering.
no. medical attendings just give the medical student seven study references to look up in the medical school library and present in morning rounds at 7 am the next morning.
first, she doesn’t make adequate distinction between “the past” (in the traditional fallacy) and “nature” (in the natural fallacy) – and that has been the cause of a lot of the comment on this thread.
my evidence suggests that your hunch here is correct.
you have a lot invested here vis a vis personal identity and are very often arguing opinion and from an emotional perspective.
this was good writing both in the sense of being accurate and in the sense of being clear and easy to assimilate.”
lizkat and others are doing exactly the kind of thing they criticize dr. tuteur for.
(pygmies are hunter-gatherers.
i do agree with dr. tuteur that there is no evolutionary advantages to having people live past reproductive age.
what i said was that it may and it was reasonable enough that it may influence your or another doctor’s opinion since no one wants to believe they were doing harm to a defenseless child (even if they thought it was in the child’s best interests at the time).
the problem is, most people don’t even realize when they receive treatment for life threatening diseases.
would dr hall frame medical scientists’ expertise in this same way in a discussion of medicine when the scientific consensus was being challenged by someone not versed in medical science? really, dr hall is being an apologist and claiming on the one hand that his ideas are “clearly science and evidence based” and then claims they’re just common sense so the bad science doesn’t matter because really he’s telling us how to think…um, using bad science and confirmation bias apparently.
however, that seems highly unlike since you keep resorting to all the same rhetorical tactics as pseudoscientific pseudoskeptics as big scam promoters and climate change deniers.
she has a variety of adult onset lupus which has been treated in part with medicines that did not exist 30 years her stomach got blocked and needed to be reattached to the small bowel, probably something that could not have been done a hundred years ago.
a high-fiber diet speeds stool transit times, reduces fecal viscosity, and inhibits fecalith formation.
so, (this is quite preliminary and speculative) our ancestors may have evolved the ability to go into a diabetic state to provide sufficient blood sugar for a large brain despite the vagaries of a paleolithic or even pre-paleolithic diet.
on it were more genetically fit because that’s all there was.”
so anything that reduces the amount of land we use for farming is good, unless it’s dumping more dangerous pesticides and fertilizers (including cow manure– it’s also a burden) into the local ecosystems. ”
in fact, doctors with attitudes such as the one you repeatedly show here have increasingly made basic preventative medicine the realm of alternative medicine.
sexual selection would select for health.
if you live somewhere that’s abundant in healthy food – tahiti or hawaii, or a fertile crescent or valley – you probably did pretty well in terms of longevity.
when i read lomborg, i got one impression; when others read the books, they got a very different impression.
history travels in veins, often dividing in making directions.
it’s important to remember that the switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture was neither overnight, nor cold-turkey.
however, when you go to its origins i noted that it was begun by medical researchers who took the time and trouble to conduct good studies, and published their work in peer-reviewed journals.
the improving diet, clothing, and shelter of the american population over the period since about 1870 also played a role.
my point was that alex knapp provided no support for the implied claim that reduced average height in the population of the scenario he presented was a result of stunted growth in the same thread in which he criticized amy for not using citation to peer-reviewed research and analysis.
off the top of my head i can remember reading about a young polish girl deported by the russians along with many other poles to siberia during the second ww where there was no soap, cambodians living without soap and british nurses held prisoners by the japanese during wwii who didn’t have any.
they had fewer diseases compared to modern man and were therefore superior.
the problem with only reading people who’s style you like or who you know you agree and share a perspective with is that it’s just feeding a personal confirmation bias.
agreed, it would have been more accurate to say that the post was about the advantages of modernity in toto, in particular citing modern agriculture and not at all restricted to sbm, in contrast to the hellishness of the past/nature.
as fact for the sake of argument since its factualness is not relevant to my point.
when i lived in africa, children who could not live with their mother (mother died, or mother remarried and new husband was not interested in supporting another man’s child) were sent to live with their maternal grandmother.
hmm, i wonder if i’m the only one lucky enough to have never needed life saving medicine two broken arms (soccer), torn acl (soccer), flu a few times, that’s it.
basiorana: “the thing is, the most important thing in environmentalism is land.
you’re unable to own up to your own rather glaring errors in communication or take responsibility for how you communicate (sure you change things after the fact but that’s not actually honestly owning what you originally said, it’s usually just erasing the evidence of your error), you don’t seem to understand or be able to acknowledge how much your project onto people who comment and your own cognitive biases, and you certainly don’t seem aware of just how often you use exactly the same tactics as cam promoters of pseudoscience or ideologies.
the point is that, as usual, you’re being ideological and simplistic and giving the impression that real public health issues are simply being fabricated by alt med types rather than being the domain of medicine and public health concerns also advanced by the medical establishment.
i would not take from this evidence that religious revivals improve life expectancies.
might have survived anyway, might have succumbed to infection.
you don’t have to be a luddite to simply want to eat human food.
because you like the sciency feel of lomborg’s book, even though you don’t actually have the expertise to analyze the science in this case, and you consider yourself to be “scientifically minded” and agree with his opinions, you give him total credence and just brush off the actual experts as being “emotional”.
(and areas where dr tuteur is quite obviously not an expert herself, she quite often proposes quite old fashioned and reactionary ideas that aren’t supported by contemporary scientific understandings or that don’t take into account complexity and the limits of current knowledge.
fair enough, but don’t claim to be flying the flag for science-based medicine.

if you are going to call someone out for not supporting their position with peer-reviewed research and analysis, you’d better make sure your not standing in a glass house when you do it.
if i get a chance, i’ll post those citations.
there’s a commercial driven conflict of interest here that the other sbm bloggers simply don’t have (that i’m aware of anyway, most seem very, very ethical in this regard and have no monetary interest in skeptical blogging or promoting a public image of themselves as skeptical…as retired or practicing doctors and researchers they generally seem to genuinely care about good science and medical practices).
there is also the myth i’ve seen implied in some comments that technologically advanced westerners managed to conquer the “inferior” native people because they were smarter.
“i think that one of the main reasons that the past is romanticized by so many in the general public is because in addition to having no education in science, they also lack any in history and they seem to do very little reading.”
it’s because they barely had enough to eat and sometimes starved.
remember, evolutionary success is measured by number of living offspring, not by length of life.
had he been talking about lower back pain, he would no doubt have been more long-winded, discussing the evidence that chiropractic manipulations appear help and discussig whether this was because of ‘subluxions’ or just because chiropractic is similar to other sorts of hands on stuff which also appears to help like massage, osteopathy etc… plonit, let’s cut to the chase: chiropractic is useless for back pain.
i am also waiting with bated breath for a science based response to the point that children are now suffering from obesity and type ii diabetes… kind of puts a wrench in dr. tuteur’s unique theories.
years, people who did well on it were more genetically fit because that’s all there was.”
“part of science education is teaching the critical approach to information and conclusion.
well the entertainment value is certainly deepening here.
dr. t sees everything as either this extreme or that extreme, but life is complicated.
i would go back even further, to the neolithic revolution, around 10,000 years ago, (if we’re looking at hunter-gatherer societies versus farming), when population started growing exponentially.
while you display impressive insight from what i typically see as a paleo blogger (the fist part of the para), you seem a bit unconcerned or perhaps ignorant of the possibility of a spectrum.
if a placebo is relieving someone’s pain or depression it is working since the end goal of any treatment for pain or depression is to relieve pain or depression.
technology has given us more leisure time and i’m not sure how it would affect our “energy.”
in other words, we will get them regardless of lifestyle.
also, african americans are more likely to be lactose intolerant than people of eastern european descent.
mothers will go further to save a baby’s life than anyone else will.
historically speaking, the best way to examine the effects of the paleolithic diet are to look at modern human hunter-gatherers and their health.
alison cummins, i never maid any claim that food restriction does not result in stunted growth.
all of these things combined are what make dr tuteur into a cargo cult science blogger and makes it a real shame that she’s using sbm as a platform to promote ideological positions as sbm rather than using this platform to educate lay people about sbm, how science and medicine work, and the difference between science and pseudoscience and how to spot bloggers and writers that promote pseudoscience.
the internet is an interactive medium so i also interact around what i read.
that said, meditation for pain management certainly started out as “alternative medicine” and was viewed with suspicion (and still is by some reactionary types) and neurplasticity was denied by “modern medicine” for quite a long time.
when you start acting like a reasonable sbm blogger instead of behaving like a desperate narcissist frantically engaged in image control, you’ll get treated like the other sbm bloggers do.

he does not “completely disagree” with the kyoto protocol: rather, he shows that its actual impact on global temperatures would be positive but very small.
my mom and brother qualify (two life threatening bone infections), grandmother, type 2 diabetes, but my dad, other siblings, kids, and husband don’t belong in the club either.
fifi – “also, saying that the placebo effect means “it doesn’t work” isn’t accurate and is overly simplistic – if a placebo is relieving someone’s pain or depression it is working since the end goal of any treatment for pain or depression is to relieve pain or depression.
i don’t think that is true, and she does not offer any substantiating evidence.
also, i’m not sure that lifespan alone is the only valid indicator of where we’re at as a society.
alison – well i guess it’s easier to quit (or whatever happened) than to simply act like a reputable skeptic or ethical sbm blogger.
while it’s true that modern medicine has improved life expectancy, particularly for infants and children, the idea that agriculture is an unequivicol good from a medical standpoint simply lacks support.
my suspicion that many skeptics are anti environmentalists is being strengthened… i think one of the major things to remember is that we have a bad habit of looking at modern hunter-gatherers as an example of how we must have lived back then.
it was beneficial for the new meat eaters anyway.
that would not mean that the diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get heart disease and type ii diabetes.”
seriously, you’re not even arguing from basic logic, science or interest in contemporay human health anymore but from a purely reactionary and non-evidence based prejudice against a paleolithic diet and all kinds of things you lump in together willynilly.
short and to the point versus long-winded but more accurate.
natural selection does not select for health, it selects for reproductive outcomes.
if evolution was able to select for resistance to heart disease in grain-based cultures over the past 10,000 years, it suggests that enough of us were living long enough that selection pressure to resist heart disease was acting very quickly.
grains supply approximately 2-4% of their calories as protein and 1-4% of calories as fat.
that assertion is not only irrelevant but actually works against you because the other poster is talking about contemporary humans eating a paleolithic diet and preventing heart disease is very relevant since we do live longer!
“however, one doesn’t need to be provocative to teach critical thinking,” what worked for you might not work for someone else.
there are, no doubt, some people who argue that people in the past lived to 90, spoke with the voice of gods and could wipe out armies single-handedly.
there is also no reason midwives could not deliver most babies within the hospital in a patient-friendly homelike environment with expert emergency backup right next door.
it’s one good reason to read ideas and to talk with people we disagree with, be they experts or not.
while it’s certainly true that declining infant mortality and conquering of childhood diseases were huge factors in increasing life expectancy, adult life expectancy has been increasing as well.
the scientific american article points out that kyoto was never *intended* to be the “solution” to global warming.
even though those patients are treated with diet, exercise, and behavior modification, they do not have a normal life expectancy.
unfortunately, balanced, practical and reasonable don’t typically play well in a blog/comment thread.
i’m guessing that in every society, with every kind of diet, no matter how low the baseline incidence of ischemic heart disease and diabetes, the incidence of both increases with age.
there is a ton of research that suggests improved health for modern humans who follow a diet that models the macronutrient composition of h-g tribes.
plant to animal subsistence ratios and macronutrient energy estimations in world wide hunter-gatherer diets.
i’m also an advocate of people understanding why something is working for them – being cognitively literate and self aware, or aware that something is actually a drug – and not presenting it as magic or harmless because its made from a plant.
“her fanatical clinging to the notion that anything natural is not good and everything medical is” watch out for matches with all that straw around.
in contrast, the survival curve for 2004 is nearly flat until about age 50 after which the decline in survival becomes more rapid.

right, so outside of urban areas, which have their own urban ills, people did much better.
i wouldn’t even take issue with google ads really myself.
in addition, as a culture we tend to disparage history.
so far i’ve observed that there are a few people here who seem to have a lot invested in attacking both dr tuteur and anything she says.
technology freed us from having to walk or do physical labor.
paleo is a good baseline starting place.
trying to pretend that one is never swayed by emotion or subject to cognitive biases is really pretty deluded and, not surprisingly, makes one even more prone to being swayed by emotion or unaware of cognitive and confirmation biases.
however, this would be the time frame and location in which we might expect to see an effect of modern medicine on longevity.
— more children per mother, leading to earlier weaning of infants and more competition for food among children.
had a stent put in and is doing fine.
to alex knapp, i have never stated that diet and exercise were not factors in the development of diabetes.
please keep in mind that for a significant proportion of the people on this planet, particularly in developing nations, life is still a living hell, despite all of our technological advances.
the argument is initially won by the model that explains the greatest amount of evidence, with the evidence weighted by the reliability of the method of collection.
“rereading dr. hall’s post on michael pollan’s book, i can see that the comments are almost all negative comments (9 out 11), and one asked for a citation.
if building a community of argumentative commenters is her role as an sbm blogger, then she is successful, and i don’t see anything to be concerned about.
the cooked meat was still more nutritious and that nutrition could be accessed by the first people who cooked meat.
there are also many techniques non-medical bloggers use to avoid undesired e-mail in their inbox — having separate accounts for blogging and for personal business, using e-mail filters, etc.
well it is a good lesson in critical thinking and doing a bit of research to see if someone’s words and actions align and what their general integrity level is.
there is no reason to assume that the reason hunter-gatherer groups are smaller than traditional agricultural groups is that their death rates are higher.
the syndrome of periosteal inflammation was more common at hardin village than at indian knoll.
“it’s well documented that the incidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer populations vs. agricultural populations.”
now, combine knowledge of this diet with modern medicine and place it in a modern context, and it appears we have an extraordinary way to improve health.
pneumonia survived w/o drama thanks to antibiotics.

while the indicence of type ii diabetes definitely increases with age in the united states, i have a hard time describing a disease that impacts 10.8% of the population between the ages of 40-59 as a “disease of old age.”
no, i’m saying that those h-gs that did survive into adulthood had more robust health and longer life expectancies than their agricultural neighbors.
yet acog and who say that maternal mortality, while difficult to measure because of confounders, is 3 to 7 times larger with cesarean section.

of course, we could go back to dredge the thread for exact quotes if you would like to or feel the need to do so.
“2-dr tuteur doesn’t seem to actually be as engaged in practicing professional medicine or academic research as much as she is with promoting herself as a commercial medical expert/brand (with associated products, including her reputation/expertise, to sell at $4.95 a “personal” email…medical advice by email…really?
granted, my interest in cognitive science, neurobiology, psychology and emotions – and people, art and how we communicate and perceive the world – probably means i’m biased towards seeing emotions as being as important as reason, and emotions and logic as not being mutually exclusive.
of course, the cause and rate of progression of disease such as diabetes, cancer, and atherosclerosis are multifactorial, but the observations of the natural course of werner’s favors the process of aging as being a significant factor in the development of those diseases.
i don’t recall discussing any of these topics on any other thread, which is why this thread is interesting.
in most cases the herb has either not been tested against conventional treatments or has been shown to be less effective than conventional treatments.
that said, back pain is still somewhat mysterious even to medicine (hence it being a fertile ground for woo).
what can i say, i enjoy observing people and seeing what makes them tick (and tock) and how even advocates of sbm fall prey to cognitive traps when they’re unaware or in denial of their own humanity.
what i don’t believe is that the 80% being done in latin america (for example) are, or the 45% rate in some u.s. hospitals.
living in accordance with the nature we evolved with — to some degree anyway — requires conscious effort.
in populations with nutrition-related growth restriction, men and women are of similar height because there is not enough surplus food to fuel a complete male adolescent growth spurt.

science really does not understand exactly how and why physical exercise helps to keep us healthy.
since children with genetic defects tend to die very early, and since childbearing is associated with a high risk of death, it makes biologic sense for ovulation to wind down when the quality of ova diminishes.”
again, likely true because life has always been a battle of survival.

yes, reality in the past also favored survival of those physically strong enough to survive and provide for themselves.
if you’re going to tally up errors, then actually i would reiterate that lomborg had way more errors and flaws in science in just one chapter on agw inthe skeptical environmentalist than al gore had in his movie and book combined.
perhaps there is some way you can explain how charging a fee to give medical advice over the internet is an ethical way to deal with unwanted e-mail.
meditation does work to change neuroanatomy and for pain management, exercise has been shown to help alleviate mild to moderate depression, herbs have a biological effect and various other very non-magical things that cam claims as their treatment territory.
sid, i’m still waiting for you to provide the statistics that show smallpox disappeared spontaneously and not as a result of vaccination.
they have loads of [not without errors, but still valid] research to back that up.
ok, that’s fine, we all like our modern advantages.
civilization apparently makes us weak.
i eat a relatively sensible diet and get regular exercise like my gp mom taught me
i have been quite puzzled how sbm editors could read amy tuteurs own blog and view her ask dr. amy website and still accept her as a contributor here.
it’s not as if i could grow my own beans here.
a “religious-fervor” is a fine metaphor, but this fundamentalist comparison is a bit sloppy.
i think that one of the main reasons that the past is romanticized by so many in the general public is because in addition to having no education in science, they also lack any in history and they seem to do very little reading.”
just because i agree with singh (a confirmation bias) and know what he’s talking about (the context) doesn’t actually mean that the quotes you’ve presented are any more legitimate than any other opinion proffered without evidence.
his critics have responded to errors he made, but they have not responded to his main points which would still be valid if all those errors were corrected.
as dr. tuteur aptly states, we evolved to eat what was available.
but eat real food and through self-experimentation, figure out what works for you.
the smartest professors were often more humble because they had learned the limitations of their knowledge.
as the highest grossest movie of all time, i think it’s relevant to where we’re at as a culture.
people living in a traditional way in okinawa are a good example of how a good diet, daily exercise (and probably some good genetic material) can play into living a long life.
oh no, sid, don’t do the “well the diseases were on their way and vaccines had little effect” gambit.
one other obvious possibility is an increased survival rate for smaller, weaker, less physically gifted, and shorter individuals (assuming height is an indicator of optimal physique) for one reason or another.
(the fact that you constantly assume that anyone who critiques you is promoter of your pet peeves and not an advocate of sbm only strengthens the impression you’re into black/white thinking and not actually sbm.)
his second and third wives were actually younger than the oldest children.
and backed up with evidence, and i don’t believe that dr. tuteur has provided a single link to back up her statements in 400+ comments (despite promising to a commenting doctor to do so).
i also nursed two babies at once, and it still didn’t make a difference.
i suspect you’re right in many ways but the quality does also seem to be a factor, in the research that’s been done on fruitflies at least.
according to the “fiber hypothesis,” fecaliths develop more readily in people who consume a diet deficient in fiber, because their stools are more tenacious.
i’d like to point out that i’m pretty sure you can find very reliable statistics about the number of deaths caused by these diseases in the not so distant past.
once again dr tuteur is making it appear as if medicine doesn’t promote exercise and a healthy diet as basic preventative medicine (and that these are the domain of “alternative health” rather than medicine).
i do not dispute, for one minute, that modern medicine has enabled modern americans to live longer and healthier lives.
nothing essentially wrong with that, of course, it’s just rather hypocritical to spout off against organic farming on sbm and then to cynically exploit people’s desire and willingness to pay more for organic and green products on your site.
tooth decay was rampant at hardin village and led to early abscessing and tooth loss; decay was unusual at indian knoll and abscessing occurred later in life because of severe wear to the teeth.
since children with genetic defects tend to die very early, and since childbearing is associated with a high risk of death, it makes biologic sense for ovulation to wind down when the quality of ova diminishes.”
more food can be produced more quickly, thus supporting larger populations.
so it’s impossible to state that the difference in life expectancy is due to both modern medicine and industrial agriculture.
there just seems to be no recognition by dr hall that he got his facts wrong… dr hall – “he is clearly evidence- and science-based, although he has made mistakes about what the evidence shows.
i’m very interested in this and want to believe you, but your vagueness is leaving me less than impressed!
or someone could have an accident and there could be internal damage that the h-g couldn’t know about and the person would die later.
his second and third wives were actually younger than the oldest children.
the study above reviews the food-intake over over 250 modern hunter-gather tribes and examines their macronutrients.
sbm has established itself as being on the journalism spectrum with both editorial and investigative/analytical aspects.
i am glad that science based medicine and agriculture did not really make a difference in longevity, because if they did we would have an overpopulated world.
definitely a devout fundamentalist.
# billyjoe on 24 feb 2010 at 6:04 am plonit, let’s cut to the chase: chiropractic is useless for back pain.
very unlikely to have been up that high if he had been pre-industrial, so moot wrt benefits of life-saving industrial technology.)
true, but when they started refining the rice it did.
of course, none of the sbm bloggers here are climate scientists (and neither am i, nor apparently is lomborg) so, like dr tuteur’s claims of expertize regarding agriculture and anthropology, we’d all really be out of our areas of expertize and mistaking our opinions for fact (if we argued them as fact that is).
however, there are doctors who cling to practices or beliefs despite the evidence – sometimes because it involves a pet theory of theirs (this is where doctors often step over the line into being quacks) and sometimes because it’s a bit horrifying to think you did something harmful when your self image is that of a healer (and you genuinely are a pretty nice and decent person who was just doing whatever the norm was at the time so it’s easier to believe it isn’t really harmful or a big deal).
yet without the western diet, many wouldn’t need medical interventions to survive.
yes, the average lifespan has dramatically increased, but that does not mean health has improved.
your point is better made if you stop posting links without context and start providing analysis.
what i challenge is your statement that any evidence that a “paleolithic diet” is protective against chronic diseases associated with age (compared to a grain-based diet) is irrelevant to discussions of longevity.
i believe the current life expectancy for a 50 year old white male is about 34 years, more or less.
medicine certainly hasn’t been successful in preventing these diseases and industrialization can very reasonably be argued as a contributing factor.
improvements in survival between 1900–1902 and 1949–1951 occurred at all ages, although the largest improvements were among the younger population.
hmm, more ad hominem attacks by dr. tuteur.
i spend quite a bit of my own time railing against acupuncture, chiropractors, etc.
and, if you’re going to take on ideologues and true believers, and people with commercial interests or a lot to lose if reality is exposed, there is going to be pushing and shoving.
people who do so are willing to sacrifice editorial control in return for the income generation.”
yardshares, rooftop gardens and community plots are another way that more people are growing their own food or using urban and suburban land/spaces to grow food.
i did not say that you were an egotistical monster–i said that that that statement made it sound like you were.
this is not very different from people into cam who think that medical pseudoscience supports their opinion or “common sense” belief.
to all those who write as if you had some personal vendetta against dr. tuteur: it is possible to discuss the content of the writing without saying derogatory things about the writer.
basically his diet advice (based on a combination of research on diets from all over the world, not just western high fat, high carbs) is “eat food.
3 – the smallpox, whooping cough, polio i didn’t have to worry about because my parents believed in vaccines.
your personal narrative about the kinds of responses you get is as faulty as it is self-aggrandizing – it’s also very familiar from antivaxers and the most nutty alt med promoters!
perhaps the following can add to the premise of dr tuteurs article that abandoning modern medicine for the romantic notion of how we used to be healthier would be disastrous.
the only person who’s desperate to believe that you’ve got something of substance to offer and are teaching everyone a lesson they “need” to learn is you.
sbm is not a peer reviewed journal publishing original scientific observations, so the articles are not required to have the same rigor in observation and citation.
it occured to me as well that the extremist skeptic backlash against *anything* natural was a response to being compared to animals, since, guess what, that’s what we are.
and even the most accurate scientific data can’t tell us what is the “right” thing to do.
lizkat and others are doing exactly the kind of thing they criticize dr. tuteur for.
the finding was that while the book was scientifically dishonest, it wasn’t fraud because lomberg wasn’t an expert.
however, this is not the case among modern-hunter gatherer groups.
billyjoe: “let’s cut to the chase: chiropractic is useless for back pain.”
it’s even highly probable washington himself would have lived much longer had he not been “bled” and given quack-therapy of molasses and the like after being diagnosed with the quinsy (lol).
my provocative posts are provocative because they challenge cherished wisdom.
in some ways, modern industrialize living comes with complications.

fifi: “from my perspective, it would be nice if humans finally just got over the fantasies and started to figure out how to live on the planet as human animals.

my mother-in-law: heart attack 2 years ago.
all modes of living have their advantages and disadvantages, to romanticize any of them is creating fantasies that deny reality.
i’d be interested in knowing too since it seems weird that you’re here.
for the most part i have found the blogs posted on this site to be extremely informative–i currently work at a planned parenthood as a reproductive health assistant but don’t have a “real” medical background; for the most part, i approach the site as a layman skeptic.
i’d be interested in knowing what the authors think about the union of concerned scientists, since they seem to both be environmentalists and don’t subscribe to the skeptic label (as far as i know).
what they were doing is developing alternative methods to improving productivity to rival monsanto & co. using science…not ancient magical augers or buckets drawn by goats.
if references are supplied, that doesn’t fully simulate the problem solving situations that may be faced in the practice of medicine.
modern hunter-gatherers have spent the whole time we’ve been developing agriculture evolving to their lifestyle and weeding out bad genes.
however, it came at the price of a lower overall quality of health.
argument is really useful.
telling people that you are concern about some of their healthcare choices, and then give them the reasons why, goes a lot farther than just telling them that their doctor is a quack, their medicine is garbage, and that they are just a backwards looking fundamentalist for thinking so.
however, it is effective at getting some students to be much more circumspect about how to solve a problem using medical literature.
they had fewer diseases compared to modern man and were therefore superior.
jmb – i don’t buy your explanation since there are other factors at work here and dr tuteur’s style and even the content of her posts has more to do with how cam pseudoscience promoters operate than any medical scientist or doctor i’ve known (including ones that teach).
according to my review of the literature, diabetes and heart disease are primarily caused by diet.
the result are very healthy people who live a long time if they survive childhood.
i agree with whoever said that it’s also dangerous to romanticize the present.
instead of amy tuteur who omits (at least on her sbm profile) that she left the practice of medicine and gives readers the impression that she is currently a practicing ob-gyn.
i agree with dr hall that she is being treated unfairly.
” israelites were pastoralists.
amy, “hg individuals were not obese.
but i’m sure any one of her intellectually nimble and nuanced commentators could explain why the natural fallacy and the traditional fallacy utilized by cam advocates are entirely fallacious.
our genes evolved over millions of years, not the 10,000 years that power hungry leaders have used farming to control the entire world in a very short time.
the national academy of scienes series dr. novella posted about a few weeks ago on evolution has some really cool articles on aging and disease.
“dr. t’s writing is fine for the back of a cereal box, but i had come to expect more nuance from the bloggers here because of the more knowledgeable readers.
modern agriculture — and especially modern agricultural policy — makes food available cheaply, but the cheap stuff is mostly bad food.
rereading dr. hall’s post on michael pollan’s book, i can see that the comments are almost all negative comments (9 out 11), and one asked for a citation.
that is a process that the student will gradually get better at with practice.
personally, i think the difference is almost entirely due to (1) and that (2) introduces problems of disease and malnourishment.
in a small way, i do feel sort of personally threatened by ideologues in the sense that ideologues that ascend to power may try to impinge upon societal liberties now in place and eventually my personal freedom.
i eat what i eat because it tastes good and i feel good when i get proper nutrition.
medicine’s great achievement has been to stop children dying.
as applied to american society, focus on diet, exercise, and behavior will result in improvements in longevity, but improvements in longevity are likely to be limited by the phenomenon of aging.
to show us that that their way is as good as they say.
taking into account that both you and dr tutuer are sharing personal meanings regarding the term “alternative medicine”, i think it’s important to note that there’s increasingly sound scientific evidence for meditation and exercise for managing stress and chronic pain.
# steven novella on 18 feb 2010 at 4:15 pm point of clarification (sorry if i missed this earlier) lifespan is the maximum age an individual may live life expectancy is the average age a population lives.
they are sure that they can prevent getting cancer and heart disease if they simply eat “right” and exercise.
# amy tuteur, md on 19 feb 2010 at 3:29 pm “if this is what happened, that suggests that a not-insignificant proportion of the population got old, and that old people were genetically fit — that is, that they contributed to the survival of their relatives and the reproduction of their genes.”
in this comment thread i mentioned that i had thought that amy was going to write about the current “stone-age diet” and would have been interested to hear amy or another sbm blogger deconstruct it.
agriculture may lead to: — more sewage to deal with, more water-borne disease to fight off, therefore less energy available to fuel growth even with the same amount of food.
is that there are no ads and i can change the size of the text.
“credibility problems in press releases can be caused by…….. omitting qualifiers and diluting the text by using too many superlatives…..”
indeed, it usually ignores scientific evidence entirely.
his proposal is that we are healthy and long-lived today because we have access to modern medicine, not because we eat grain.
dr. tuteur’s role on sbm is not to increase traffic.
# bluedevilra on 18 feb 2010 at 9:29 am stroh raises a good point.

# alison cummins on 18 feb 2010 at 4:02 pm plonit on infanticide: “there is no reason to kill a child because a new child has been born while the first is still nursing; women can generally support two babies, milk-wise, and by then the older child is not exclusively drinking breastmilk.
people challenge her on them and end up engaging in conversations with one another about topics they care about, often only tangentially related to amy’s original post.
it would be nice to see one shred of evidence to prove dr. tuteur’s assertions, especially that modern agriculture is primarily responsible for an increase in life expectancy.
his proposal is that we are healthy and long-lived today because we have access to modern medicine, not because we eat grain.
other diseases also became more widespread because people lived closer together in one spot.
ironically, i got interested in the “stone-age diet” for the purpose of debunking it.
as has been seen in the previous section, child mortality fell from a number of diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia) in the early part of the 20th century for which there was no effective therapy or immunization # amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 1:27 pm “i would argue that a larger population with a lower life expectancy is indicative of worse health”
difference makes the world interesting and it’s worth remaining open to and curious about different perspectives rather than constantly seeking to affirm our own.
amy tuteur: evolution does not select for anything.
i spend quite a bit of my own time railing against acupuncture, chiropractors, etc.
for me, at least, cutting out grains means that i’m hungry less often.
one potential complicator: men and women both care for the children, but although male fertility does decline with age, they don’t really have any equivalent to menopause.
using average lifespan as the measure of a society’s health is wrong.
# fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 1:38 pm alison – oh, i just don’t assume that we all know about the scientific evidence for meditation and exercise (and often find it’s necessary to clarify that these are part of medicine as well as being promoted by “alternative medicine”).
oh well, shouldn’t have read it, but bored, sick and napping all day.
karl, if you review the literature on modern h-g societies, you will discover that the incidence of cancer, heart disease, and strokes are much lower than in modern agricultural societies.
moreover, by any parameter you wish to name, modern americans are healthier and live longer than individuals in hunter gatherer populations.
diseases of old age can become primary causes of death only when diseases of infancy and childhood are vanquished, and that is precisely what has happened.]
that was a process not easily duplicated on a test.
it’s a bit like dr tuteur thinks nature is the enemy when everything is part of the natural world, including the tools and technologies that humans create (be they health supporting or destructive to human health and happiness).
you support his “common sense” opinion despite the fact that neither you nor he are climate scientists and the people you’ve denigrated as being “emotional” for critiquing him are actually climate scientists.
if evolution was able to select for resistance to heart disease in grain-based cultures over the past 10,000 years, it suggests that enough of us were living long enough that selection pressure to resist heart disease was acting very quickly.
# jmbon 22 feb 2010 at 10:10 pm “i guess the incentive in the provocative approach was, “get mad at me, then go prove me wrong.”
for example, research from asia indicates that the switch to a predominantly cultivated rice diet did not result in a deterioration of dental health.
they don’t have to be perfect; they just have to improve the odds.
amy writes a post about how toxins are non-existent (dec. 24) then sells organic diapers and baby food on her site.
i’d be happy to provide them.
it doesn’t matter that we were originally hunter gatherers.
furthermore, research shows that as these people transition to the western diet (like native pacific islanders), they have extremely high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
i know i’ve seen blogs and websites where people will say they don’t believe in or use allopathic medicine and only use natural herbs, plants and traditional remedies that have been used for 1000s of years because it’s far superior to “allopathic” and modern medicine.
re harris # hairyape68 on 18 feb 2010 at 6:25 pm typo, average age at death of the first 30 71.1, not 77.1 i know two people alive because of modern medicine: my wife is 77.
she pointed to our prehistoric ancestors and said that they were fine without using soap.
i’m guessing that although diet and lifestyle modification can drastically reduce the incidence of those diseases, it can’t entirely eradicate them.
not to mention using an agricultural caused disease (smallpox/ cowpox) to prove one’s point that modern agriculuture with pesticides is the main reason (in addition to modern medicine) for increasing human life expectancy.
(this one focuses on glucose tolerance for type 2 diabetes patients with ischaemic heart disease and notes that a paleolithic type diet produced better glucose tolerance than a mediterranean consensus diet.)
well, of course, you can’t extrapolate off one person… so widen the net to his family.
for example, john graunt reported on life expectancy in london in the 1500s and 1600s, one of the earliest examples of vital statistics.
not saying i’m wild about the e-commerce/online pregnancy advice line of work in a sbm blogger, just nitpicking for accuracy.
# lovleanjel on 18 feb 2010 at 9:47 am amy, citing a royal family of europe as “the most likely to live long” is probably a bad idea, since they were terribly inbred and had many people gunning for their thrones.
i would argue that a larger population with a lower life expectancy is indicative of worse health, but that’s the pattern we see time and time againt when socieites move from hunter-gatherer to agriculture.
i thought the chlorine free aspects of diapers was more of an environmental thing (chlorine processing, bleaching, going into groundwater, etc).
well, of course, you can’t extrapolate off one person… so widen the net to his family.
some of my posts are getting delayed by “waiting in moderation” too.
one of the greatest things about modern medicine is that we don’t rest on our laurels.
yes, i just discovered that she charges for “expert advice”!
regards, billyjoe wales: “admitting that cam can be as effective as placebo”
you have stated on numerous occasions that there is no good data to think that c-sections increase maternal mortality, but i certainly may be misinterpreting.
make that voluminous reference citations.
these papers study both diabetics and healthy, modern people, and show health improvements from following a paleolithic style diet.
vaccines didn’t eradicate polio.
i am also waiting with bated breath for a science based response to the point that children are now suffering from obesity and type ii diabetes… kind of puts a wrench in dr. tuteur’s unique theories.
growth arrest episodes at indian knoll were periodic and more often of short duration and were possibly due to food shortage in late winter; those at hardin village occurred randomly and were more often of long duration, probably indicative of disease as a causative agent.
of course, the biggest problem with chiropractors isn’t that they’re ineffective, it’s that their neck cracking confidence trick can cause strokes.
there was no obesity, and people got lots of exercise.
this data agrees with the assertion by dr tuteur that modern medicine accounts for a significant fraction of the improvement in life expectancy.
sorry about that and thanks for clarifying # fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 1:45 pm dr tuteur – “and for most people during most of human existence, preventing heart disease was irrelevant, since they died long before they could be afflicted with it.”
while it’s theoretically possible for a particular human community to be hunter-gatherers while having access to modern medicine, modern medicine is dependent on agriculture and fuel.
but in my experience the sticking point is precisely what was simply asserted without any detailed discussion – “for most of human existence, according to fossil and anthropological data, the average human lifespan was 35 years.”
so, in lieu of a change in nomenclature, our best summary is that alternative medicne does not work, none of it.
most work long hours, women with young children often have to work.
before modern sanitation, agriculture most likely lead to increased population, but decreased life expectancy.
we may think were more powerful than our genes but it doesn’t work that way at least not now or for the foreseeable future.
emulating the fox news model (or appearing to do so) would seem to narrow the teaching possibilities rather than broaden them, in terms of actually reaching a prospective audience.
but then i don’t have unrealistic expectations of journalism (or science, medicine or doctors for that matter…though i may apparently have unrealistic expectations regarding the integrity of sbm bloggers practicing what they preach and going by the same rules as ethical scientists do).
i never claimed it always creates a bias and obviously many doctors who used to do circumcisions no longer do them for ethical reasons and can admit that even though they did them at the time because it was routine that they no longer consider it good practice.
in the absence of potatoes, the irish either had to leave (like good hunter-gatherers) or use capital (which they didn’t have but the english did) to import food.
children have a lot of demands on the limited amount of food they can consume: physical maturation, exploring, learning, fighting disease, hunting and gathering.
statlerwaldorf – i’d suspect it’s illegal to give medical advice over the internet (in this kind of context, legitimate telehealth setups associated with reputable health institutions can be very useful for remote communities).
2-dr tuteur doesn’t seem to actually be as engaged in practicing professional medicine or academic research as much as she is with promoting herself as a commercial medical expert/brand (with associated products, including her reputation/expertise, to sell at $4.95 a “personal” email…medical advice by email…really?
of course i believe cesareans are necessary sometimes.
because it gives me insight into other perspectives, it sometimes gives me an understanding or provokes thought that changes my perspective and even when that’s not the case it means i at least have an understanding of those i disagree with (and just don’t routinely shut out anything that may challenge ideas i already hold).
finally, a reason to pick up o magazine for the first time!
i think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.
it’s also worth noting that someone communicating in an emotional or passionate manner doesn’t automatically mean they’re being irrational or that what they’re communicating isn’t evidence or science based.
if you’d started out rocky but gotten better it would be understandable (new to sbm’s style, etc) but you haven’t improved at all and have descended even further into the mire of antivaxer/altmed rhetorical clichés and presenting generalize philosophical or ideological positions as scientific and/or sbm.
there is no reason to kill a child because a new child has been born while the first is still nursing; women can generally support two babies, milk-wise, and by then the older child is not exclusively drinking breastmilk.
but it does not follow that absolutely everything about post-industrial life is better than any imaginable aspect of pre-industrial life.
dr. tuteur: “the difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods (including pesticides).
my wife is currently expecting, and believe me, we have a great ob–not a midwife.
i’m really pretty surprised that the sbm editors think this is okay if they knew about it.
fantastic point about menopause and its evolutionary purpose.
i think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.

moreover, this research also demonstrates that diet-related illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, and strokes are lower in incidence among the elderly of h-g groups than the elderly in the united states.
i would argue that a larger population with a lower life expectancy is indicative of worse health”
it would be nice to see one shred of evidence to prove dr. tuteur’s assertions, especially that modern agriculture is primarily responsible for an increase in life expectancy.
in addition, if alex’s thesis is correct, that would be a strand of evidence in the direction that in fact wedid live long enough that resistance to chronic disease would have beneficial.
if i wanted religion or some kind of simplistic good/evil fantasy world, i’d be into alternative medicine or technofuturism not science and reality-based thinking.
expecting everyone to say not much, she was a little shocked when i shouted, “they died at 30.”
since such an experiment is impractical, we must settle on a less reliable method.
steve rappaport reports inworlds within worlds: structures of life in sixteenth-century london that, a century earlier in the 1500s, of men who made it to age 25 to 26, the ages at which most men became full citizens, the average further life expectancy was 28 years, meaning that men who made it to adulthood would have had about a 50-50 chance of living to be older than 53 or 54.
it might work in medical school, where the students are a captive audience and where the entire ritual of enrolling in school, paying tuition, and knowing a degree is received at the end reinforces the proscribed roles of student and teacher and supports the learning process, no matter how angry the student feels about the teacher.
normally, it is very high in all species including humans, because (in my opinion) it is one of nature’s mechanisms for keeping species healthy.
i just find it unfortunate when an sbm blogger acts as if sbm is merely about surgery and pharmaceuticals and make equally unscientific assertions as those promoting naturalist fallacies.
# alison cummins on 18 feb 2010 at 2:10 pm lillym on motherless infants: i’d assume that there would be remarriage and the stepmothers would take care of the younger children as well as any children she had.
another very problematic habit she has is that she pontificates and claims expertize in areas where she’s very clearly not at all up on the latest research or qualified as an expert in!
thanks to fifi for the tip.
if 12% of adult londoners were able to survive to 70, i’m impressed.
however, i think that it’s a mistake to completely write off the past and romanticize the present as being the best human society, in every aspect, that ever existed.
i don’t really know what percentage of the 6 plus billion people on this planet have a horrible quality of life, but it would be interesting to find out.
you don’t need to demonstrate that the past was hell and nature is a bitch in order to demonstrate the illogic of the natural fallacy and the traditional fallacy.
“i think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.”
i suspect that a lower carb via starch is probably more suited to most.
wiki several studies offer evidence that a low fiber intake is involved in the pathogenesis of appendicitis[14]
amy, so this “healthy” diet that “we evolved to eat” is responsible for the fact that hunter gathers have spread to every corner of the globe and now number in the billions.
in some patients, that delay will be sufficient that they will never suffer the complications of the error in metabolism.
i didn’t say any organization, i said every organization.
brother-in-law: my mother-in-law lost her second baby, but never delivered it.
i know that there have been studies on the isolated modern tribes of hunter-gatherers
hg individuals were not obese.
because they’re an isolated population that experiences little infectious disease, they provide a nice control for what a h-g diet looks like when you control for infectious disease.
that’s a pretty typical meal for me and yet, i lose weight, my triglycerides are lower, my blood pressure is lower, my fasting glucose is lower, etc. crap – i submitted too early.
for instance, hunter-gatherers tended to get more exercise than cube-farm dwellers.
(pygmies are hunter-gatherers.
if you are 40 now your life expectancy is greater than if you were 40 in 1800.
menopause makes most sense if you assume that it makes at least a small core of women not tied down with infant care available to guide and support a group of younger mothers.
i personally remember the polio epidemics.
and, in many ways singh is doing the same things as a journalist that some bloggers here complain about when science writers do them regarding things they don’t agree about (using anecdotes, making assertions about evidence without presenting the actual evidence, relying upon an expert rather than analysing the data himself, etc).
my understanding is that in hunter-gatherer societies it is more typical to have a baby every four years.
h-g had to deal with the fact that their food sources could be unreliable for many reasons beyond their control — plants not bearing enough fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
also: — more staying at home, better housing, cleared land and fewer (not more) predators.
factual errors matter, if left uncorrected by the author.
apart from the question of clinical evidence, the dose of actual active ingredient in the herb has been found to vary greatly from batch to batch and sometimes there is actually no active ingredient.
from a completely anthropological point of view – life expectancy in ancient populations isn’t worked out from a mean of the whole population, it’s worked out from the tiny percentage of fossils we find.
might have survived anyway, might have succumbed to infection.
as a consequence, i’d have to see a highly controlled study that shows the superiority of a modern diet, because the observational evidence goes the other way.
weing – “my personal feeling regarding these diets is that the quantity of the food and not the quality will turn out to be critical.
if i get a chance, i’ll post those citations.
so it is strictly unjustified to say “there is not a jot” of evidence that chiropractic can treat asthma.
additional info– numerous property losses forcing moves through debt that they could not repay for both pa and almanzo.
so the drug/herb/whatever should not get the credit.
fundamentalists really require that infallible source text for them to reinterpret strictly.
i’m also assuming that the father would marry a younger woman.
in that village the only variable they could find was whether the mother had a cash income or not.
amy tuteur on premises: “there’s actually no good data to show that c-sections increase the risk of maternal death, despite a number of studies that make that claim.”
we tend to talk much about the factors of diet, exercise, and smoking, because those are factors we can change.
rather ironically, considering the subject of this particular blog, she sells organic baby formula and green baby products alongside the pampers.
what is true is that “given the evidence, a reasonable and informed person would have not a jot of belief that chiropractic is a remedy for asthma”.
they wouldn’t reach the age to develop clinically significant occlusions in their coronary arteries!
which makes sense for her to point out because there are a lot of people who believe in alternative “natural” healing that argue that not only is the paleolithic diet far superior to our modern diet but the paleolithich and “traditional” treatments and use of herbs, plants, and folk healing is far superior to science-based modern medicine.
the reason some may feel threatened by amy’s posts may be because she exposes their own biases, making them feel that the perfect image they had of themselves never really existed outside of their own minds.
improvements in survival between 1900–1902 and 1949–1951 occurred at all ages, although the largest improvements were among the younger population.
while it would take studies to determine, whether or not, or to what degree, the lack of soap was responsible for their skin diseases, if i remember correctly, all really missed soap and were very happy when it was again available.
one of the greatest things about modern medicine is that we don’t rest on our laurels.
your writing isn’t threatening, it’s simply not good sbm writing.
secondly, the “we evolved to eat only what we could hunt and gather” gambit is a ridiculously romantic portrayal of early humanity.
hunters and gatherers don’t eat much grain.
(pre-industrially she might not have had a pot full of boiling water to spill on herself in the first place, so likely moot.)
it only makes sense to reduce childbearing to spare her life if her life has value to the population beyond the infants she can produce.
thus, there’s an evolutionary advantage to long-life in humans, because pre-writing, the knowledge and experience of the elderly allowed for knowledge to be used and passed on to enhance the survival of the group and therefore children.
intelligent and even skeptical people like harriet can find his arguments compelling because they don’t know the background science.
for most of human existence, according to fossil and anthropological data, the average human life expectancy was 35 years.
dr. tuteur, however, doesn’t even try to research the other side or falsify her own statements or provide evidence.
i always looked upon myself as a global warming proponent.
one other obvious possibility is an increased survival rate for smaller, weaker, less physically gifted, and shorter individuals (assuming height is an indicator of optimal physique) for one reason or another.
amy tuteur said, “you, sw, have come from my personal blog where you have submitted more than a hundred comments all glorifying your personal birth choices and demeaning women who make different choices.”
additionally, agriculture allowed the development of cities and technology.
especially because they go against mainstream scientific thought.
of course, there is a very interesting political, critical history on that book!
alex knapp (not one of the 5) had the virtue of at least being honest about his motivations.
# doctorlaw on 19 feb 2010 at 4:27 pm harriet hall: “[i]t is possible to discuss the content of the writing without saying derogatory things about the writer.”
more likely, they just were lucky.
modern chimpanzees hunt, and 2.5 million years ago early hominids were using stone tools to cut the flesh off the bones of large animals (presumably scavenged).
agriculture enabled people to stop moving around all the time to follow the food source.
evolutionary medicine, in contrast, recognizes that the human body is the result of competing evolutionary pressures and changing pressures of natural selection.
amy’s response was that it doesn’t matter if a paleolithic diet prevents chronic disease because nobody eating it could live long enough to get chronic disease anyway.
in that case the post would be made much clearer, simpler, tighter — better writing — by deleting all references to alternative medicine.
seventh generation offers a safe conventional diaper without dangerous toxins.
the h-g diet was plant based, while our diet is more meat based- this probably isn’t the healthiest way to live, not to mention the inactive lifestyle we industrialists follow.
i say this because modern farming produces food that is less nutrient dense and higher in sugar content than existed even 50 years ago–to say nothing of extensive medical research in the early 20th century comparing the heath effects of native vs. western diets.
“amy said that alternative medicine is useless, and later defined alternative medicine as that which is useless.
a transition to urban areas and close quarters made possible by agriculture most certainly increased population at first, but lead to decreased life expectancy.
the archaeological evidence suggests, for example, an almost uniform crash in average heights when populations make the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture (in crete, for example, average heights for men went from 5′9″ pre-agriculture to 5′3″ afterwards).”
so this “healthy” diet that “we evolved to eat” is responsible for the fact that hunter gathers have spread to every corner of the globe and now number in the billions.
in contrast, the survival curve for 2004 is nearly flat until about age 50 after which the decline in survival becomes more rapid.
i don’t know how one would classify the ancient egyptian diet, but it sure wasn’t equivalent to the modern western diet.
you personally practice the diet that you advocate because you think you are protecting yourself.
# amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 1:31 pm sid, those quotes are meaningless one is from an encyclopedia and the other is someone’s opinion.
i am happy to admit that modern medicine saves lives, because there are ample scientific reasons to believe it.
humans are social animals, and even in hunter-gatherer groups, children are looked after by more than just their parents.
the idea is that the student would have an incentive to start with a question, find references that may apply, filter those references as to how appropriate they are, and analyze their methods and conclusions to arrive at an answer.
more likely, they just were lucky.
he is responsible for the 1st scientific estimates of population size, the concept of the life table, the idea of statistical association, the 1st studies of time series, and a pioneer attempt to draw a representative sample.
quite the opposite, i’m interested in the science around these things and sorting out the wheat (the medicine) from the chaff (the made up magical stuff).
what the student learned was to pay attention to the credibility of the source.
lillym, i take your point, but amy was responding to alex.
i did view dr. amy’s site and saw the organic products for sale in the “store”.
“harriet: “i think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.”” firstly, harriet said “more accurate”, not “wrong”.
husband: his mother had hepatitis while pregnant and had to be hospitalized; it’s very likely the pregnancy would not have been successful without treatment, and as it is, he was born several weeks late and only 7 pounds (in a family where the babies tend to be big).
the fact of the matter is, those guys have really solid science backing them up.
you seem so wrapped up ina an ideological position that you’ll even argue against evidence before you’ve even looked at the evidence!!!
he has a very rosy view of the present and the future and basically dismisses the dangers of global warming, overpopulation, water supplies, overuse of pesticide and nitrogen based fertilizers, and other toxins and pollution.
was eventually able to get off the mountain and get treated.
i don’t believe this at all, diseases happen due to all kinds of reasons outside of our control and we certainly inherit genetic vulnerabilities.
learning from some of our past mistakes and actually living in reality might be a good place to start!”
if you’re genuinely worried about clean water then reducing and cleaning up industrial pollution and domestic waste is essential, as is not polluting the land and water during wartime by using depleted uranium weapons, or mining by removing whole mountain tops, and so on.
medicine has allowed for an acceleration of that population explosion.
you’re particularly easy to spot for those of us who are familiar with the tactics used by people peddling cam pseudoscience (and marketing/propaganda techniques).
he chronicles the history of conservation biology and interviews the people who have made such leaps and bounds to save biodiversity and save our planet from extinction.
at the simplest level, very few people were able to keep their teeth into middle age, let alone survive that long.
see the following studies: apparent absence of stroke and ischaemic heart disease in a traditional melanesian island: a clinical study in kitava.
hi bluedevilrna – everyone likes to imagine they would be the sole survivor during a zombie holocaust.
a transition to urban areas and close quarters made possible by agriculture most certainly increased population at first, but lead to decreased life expectancy.
it does seem to be the more libertarian skeptics who claim to be unconvinced by global warming, ddt/malaria links, recycling, the existence of toxins/ environmental pollutants etc etc etc.
she reminds me of penn & teller (who i find entertaining but who veer into pseudo-skepticism and sensationalism, and have professional ties with industry that blatantly influence what they promote at times).
she has a variety of adult onset lupus which has been treated in part with medicines that did not exist 30 years her stomach got blocked and needed to be reattached to the small bowel, probably something that could not have been done a hundred years ago.
constantly critiqued by the same 5 people, all of whom are lay people, most (? all) who formed their personal opinions without reading the scientific papers and can’t even be bothered to read them even after it is clear that they have misinterpreted them.
dr gorski shows that it wasn’t just getting one or two small things wrong and that there’s a bias (as did the many climate scientists that dr hall dismissed as being “emotional”).
this organisation is the respectable face of the chiropractic profession and yet it happily promotes bogus treatments.”
sure, that’s unusual and extreme, but stepmothers are unreliable.
alex knapp: “all else being equal, stunted growth is typically symptomatic of malnourishment.”
*blood letting: — good for hemochromatosis.
most students got credit for attempting a literature review if they cited references to studies published in recognized peer review journals, regardless of whether it agreed with the professor’s opinion.
when a cam promoter makes these same claims about “common sense” or presents distorted science as evidence we question them – rightly so.
a baby with this range of plant food choices needs substantial meat or breastfeeding for the first 30 months, otherwise they are at high risk of kwashiorkor.
(even then her statements may bear no obvious relationship to the literature, but at least we are working from common ground and her leaps of illogic are clear.)
weing, they ate primarily unrefined brown rice, not refined white rice.
to jmb, to alex knapp, i have never stated that diet and exercise were not factors in the development of diabetes.
i believe that proper nutrition and lifestyle choices will lead to a decreased risk of illness, yes.
they eat leaves, roots, fruits, tubers, nuts and meat.
usually the statements by the attending were carefully crafted (often by years of experience and repetition) to scatter traps for unsuspecting students.
# fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 11:59 am also, it’s just stupid to say life in the past was “hell”.
sid, those quotes are meaningless one is from an encyclopedia and the other is someone’s opinion.
certain habits affect the speed at which we proceed down the pathway.
amy tuteur said, “$4.95 is the special introductory offer to have dr. amy explain to you how likely it is that you, personally, are pregnant right now.”
if i wanted religion or some kind of simplistic good/evil fantasy world, i’d be into alternative medicine or technofuturism not science and reality-based thinking.
once you do that, you’ll probably find both upsides and downsides.
biochemical studies gives us information about reactions which may cause instability of dna, or the rate of hydrolysis of simple sugars versus complex sugars.
i don’t think anyone has disputed that agriculture can support a larger population than hunting and gathering.
the rapid expansion and rapid population growth tends to result in environmental destruction, which in turn results in civilizations collapsing.
not that i’m not prone to being human myself and growing up around science certainly made me a knowledge junkie and means i love a good debate (or even a poor one sometimes).
blogging can be many things, it can be a personal journal, it can be a soapbox to share opinions with the world or it can be a very credible extension and form of journalism (either editorial or investigative).
trephining, while possibly useful in that capacity, has origins in releasing evil spirits.
in addition to being effective at keeping baby dry and reducing the risk of diaper rash, studies show that our absorbent polymer is non-toxic and non-irritating to baby’s sensitive skin.
after you have spent 8 hours at the office and 2 hours in your car, you have to deliberately and consciously make time for physical exercise.
this is because traits do not survive only if they guarantee survival.
this point is particularly bad: the difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods (including pesticides).
i believe this because there is alot of peer-reviewed research that provides data to support this position.
dr tuteur – it’s not particularly relevant how much money you make at the moment by selling your expertize on your ask dr amy website, being unsuccessful doesn’t mean you haven’t tried to commercialize your expertize and that you aren’t trying to sell medical expertize online.
diabetes (type ii), cancer and heart disease are predominantly diseases of old age.
if we could intervene in the 60 year old and give them the genomic integrity of a 20 year old by gene therapy, then maybe we wouldn’t waste so much time trying to convince the patient to eat healthier, get more exercise, and stop smoking.
it’s entirely possible to be entertaining, provocative and to explain complex ideas in lay terms without resorting to dodgy techniques.
they have loads of research to back that up.
i’d say it is because you feel threatened by what i write and you are desperately trying to convince yourself and others that you don’t need to heed it.”
but i certainly don’t think it will prevent me from getting cancer or aids or being hit by a bus or is magic.
someone has tried to argue that the h-g were really healthy due to their diet being optimal and so they were less prone to infection.
if so, the evidence of all those deaths caused by the inability of farmers to feed everyone, is very good evidence that what replaced the old method saved, prolonged and improved a great many human lives.
the only way to really get over that one is travel and friends from other cultures, actually coming up against other cultures and beliefs so you become aware of your own beliefs (since these are what we construct our personal/subjective realities out of, and it’s these personal/subjective realities that can get in the way of seeing actual/objective reality).
“while that’s true, it doesn’t change the fact that the archaeological evidence demonstrates that the incidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer societies than in agricultural ones.”
but that doesn’t mean the reason that i have lived longer than most people born 50,000 years ago is that i eat bread and they ate meat and roots.
the goal of the style was to teach students how to think, beyond just regurgitate facts for a test.
i would argue that a larger population with a lower life expectancy is indicative of worse health, but that’s the pattern we see time and time againt when socieites move from hunter-gatherer to agriculture.
basically, a native american civilization on another planet are portrayed as the good guys, while the evil technology driven armed forces attempts to exterminate them.
it’s another sign that dr tuteur is making an ideological argument that’s simply a reaction to an equally ideological argument rather than actually considering reality.
for me at least, science is about learning what objective reality really is (despite how it may seem) and not just promoting a subjective perception of reality.
again, likely true because life has always been a battle of survival.
the female menopause, which kicks in at 50, is also evidence that our ‘time gone by’ relatives lived well passed 35.
and, if one still wants a mango in the middle of winter then it’s quite possible to buy fair trade, organic mangoes.
eat whole foods that don’t require industrial processing or intense agriculture, and you’re eating an essentially paleolithic diet.
these kinds of value judgments based on personal perceptions instead of evidence are equally as meaningless when promoted by either side that’s fanatically attached to ideas about the past or “modern” life (“modern” is so quaint and retro to use…such “better living through chemistry” science romanticism!).
we also haven’t been talking about pastoralists, who are probably the healthiest of the preindustrial groups.
alex knapp, “so it’s impossible to state that the difference in life expectancy is due to both modern medicine and industrial agriculture.
and in fact, i have read posters in the past commenting on the lack of citations in a few of your posts.
evidence that our bodies adapted to make the most of that diet would be evidence that doing well on that diet conferred an evolutionary advantage — made individuals more genetically fit — otherwise there would be no adaptation.
amy, i’d say it is because you feel threatened by what i write and you are desperately trying to convince yourself and others that you don’t need to heed it.
i also didn’t know harriet was practising when i first read her articles (that was elsewhere, not here).
i can’t estimate the relative strength of the factors, but the study of werner’s syndrome suggests that aging is a stronger factor than what our beliefs (even after medical training) would suggest.
the cassidy study i particular recommend because of how comprehensive it is, but it’s far from the only study demonstrating the same result.
i mean, i’m interested in science-based medicine in the first place because i want to know what the best treatments are for particular conditions.
in 1662, he publishednatural and political observations mentioned in a following index and made upon the bills of mortality.
the nomadic mongols were, on average, taller and stronger than the peoples they conquered.
to blithely assume that modern life is, in every respect, superior to life in the past based on life expectancy alone is ridiculous.
i do it, but it’s scary, because drivers do not watch for bicyclists or pedestrians, in general.
lifespan is the maximum age an individual may live life expectancy is the average age a population lives.
my understanding is that the vast majority of that difference in lifespan is accounted for by infant mortality and, to a lesser extent, deaths from other childhood diseases.
so it’s impossible to state that the difference in life expectancy is due to both modern medicine and industrial agriculture.
they will probably counter that, yes, today we are getting better at finding ways of living longer with our unnatural, unhealthy lifestyles.
all of those things were picked for their lack of modern utility.
it’s clear that many would have lived much longer today, given nutrition, pre-natal care, competent ob-gyn care, anti-biotics, vaccinations and all the things we take for granted.
i would go back even further, to the neolithic revolution, around 10,000 years ago, (if we’re looking at hunter-gatherer societies versus farming), when population started growing exponentially.
i have cites in my other office but not on the computer i’m working from now.
what i said was that fasting glucose declined and insulin sensitivity returned to normal levels.
the fundamentalists argue that they can cure anything.
diseases of old age can become primary causes of death only when diseases of infancy and childhood are vanquished, and that is precisely what has happened.
so far sid’s citations are the most educational thing about this post. # passionlessdrone on 18 feb 2010 at 2:26 pm hi bluedevilrna – everyone likes to imagine they would be the sole survivor during a zombie holocaust.
my understanding is that the vast majority of that difference in lifespan is accounted for by infant mortality and, to a lesser extent, deaths from other childhood diseases.
“normal birth is not a medical problem, but it can turn into a life-threatening medical problem with no advance warning…there is undeniably a small risk [with home birth].
therefore, it is safe to assume that the increase in life expectancy is nonlinear, even though we lack reliable population data before 1900.
that said, fantasies about industrialization/technology are equally as silly.
but to extrapolate incredible fortune or genetics to the extent that all medicine is futile is incredibly shortsighted and selfish.
when harriet hall wonders why you to elicit more blog participation than she does, your explanation is that you tell the truth and sbm readers can’t handle the truth.
gangrenous appendix removed w/o drama.
my mom and brother qualify (two life threatening bone infections), grandmother, type 2 diabetes, but my dad, other siblings, kids, and husband don’t belong in the club either.
as the primary causes of death in childhood and early adulthood have been vanquished, it is only appropriate that we turn our focus to the diseases of old age.
i personally keep goldenseal capsules at home as a topical antibiotic.
dr val jones is down to earth, easy to read and clearly interested in actually creating understanding and reaching out in a friendly way.
“if this is what happened, that suggests that a not-insignificant proportion of the population got old, and that old people were genetically fit — that is, that they contributed to the survival of their relatives and the reproduction of their genes.”
it definitely is not reliable as a form of birth control.
i very much enjoy this blog, it becomes exceedingly tedious to keep up with the good nuggets of info amongst the various squabbles.
there is no reason to kill a child because a new child has been born while the first is still nursing; women can generally support two babies, milk-wise, and by then the older child is not exclusively drinking breastmilk.
this conferred a tremendous advantage because it provided a more nutrient rich food source.
i suffered a bad case of mononucleosis when i was six years old, bad enough to put me on iv for several days.
the people i know who take this perspective insist that life expectancies in hunter/gatherer societies were 100+ years, and that while medicine has increased them drastically over the past 100 years, that’s only partially making up for the horrible health effects of civilization.
it has also worked wonders for my parents, my mom getting off insulin as a t2 and my dad getting off about 6 meds now, including bp meds he’d been on for 30 years.
the same should apply to all of our own ideas, no matter how much we emotionally feel they’re “common sense” or how sciency they look even if we can’t expertly dissect the science ourselves.
plonit on infanticide: “there is no reason to kill a child because a new child has been born while the first is still nursing; women can generally support two babies, milk-wise, and by then the older child is not exclusively drinking breastmilk.
resistant to iron-deficiency anemia on that diet.
if you don’t have nuts where you live, the plant material available for your baby is low-protein and low caloric density.
as for the incidence of cavities, that’s a bunch of baloney.
# calli arcale on 18 feb 2010 at 11:13 pm my hunch is that hunter-gatherers, agrarians, pastoralists, and civilizationists are all basically equally “healthy”.

david gorski on pre-industrial life expectancy: “in all fairness, i note that life expectancy was significantly higher in the countryside, at least as far as the data we have suggest.”
in the peacefully idyllic past, evolution actively tuned children to be in harmony with their pre-civilization environment.
# zoe237 on 18 feb 2010 at 10:08 am actually, the movie avatar could be used as an example in popular culture.
there’s no reason to romanticise humans over other apes.
the analysis of the scientific evidence requires consideration of the different scientific methods, the accuracy and reproducibility of those scientific methods, the scale of the concept (reaction in a test tube, incidence of disease, success or health of a culture, or effects on evolution), and the consideration of the underlying model of disease (individuals are healthier because they are taller, or have lower incidence of metabolic bone disease, or because they live longer).
her prejudices lead her to make up lies/emotional accusations about those she disagrees with for ideological reasons (often in areas where she is clearly not an expert).
this plays out in contemporary health issues in different populations.
well, i know a few people who use cloth toilet paper… but i digress lol.
on another note, there is a difference in cam using concepts of science (and thus claiming common ground with sbm), and sbm which uses methods of science in addition to scientific concepts.
amy’s criticism of sid is ironic given that his link to an article by dr. simon szreter of cambridge is relevant, educational and on topic, more so perhaps than the opinions she has generated here.
i know a certain degree of sarcasm, heckling, and ridicule is unavoidable, necessary, and lets be honest a little fun.
middle brother: hospitalized with nephritis; kidney failure would be a horrible way to go * youngest brother: resuscitated after crashing at 4 months of age; two months in icu, respirator, tracheotomy, naso-gastric feedings, formula since mom went dry due to the stress, numerous surgeries to repair the trachea….
or making a lucid, evidence based argument (which would involve presenting evidence in your initial post) for how medicine has improved public health and longevity.
entirely irrational positions or beliefs, when one considers the evidence, can also be presenting in a very unemotional way.
except dr. tuteur is the one claiming to be personally attacked when somebody questions either her simplistic writing or her “authority” status that she promotes.
still, people who lived to adulthood did not make it to their 70s and 80s at anywhere near the rate that they do now.
it also enabled us to have more time for other pursuits.
there are, no doubt, some people who argue that people in the past lived to 90, spoke with the voice of gods and could wipe out armies single-handedly.
so the majority of skeletons are in their 30s, giving us an average life expectancy around 35.
the most “successful” human beings in evolutionary terms are those that leave the most offspring, not those that live the longest.
technology has given us more leisure time and i’m not sure how it would affect our “energy.”]
all of this makes it worth coming back and, well, it’s interesting watching you act and communicate like a cam promoter and ideologue while claiming to be an sbm advocate.
herbs are often purposefully supplemented by pharmaceutical drugs to enhance their effect, or inadvertently contaminated by heavy metals and other toxins which make them dangerus to use.
they are mostly common sense points about how to think about the subject, rather than specific arguments that depend on the facts his critics say he got wrong.
medical advances have had the greatest impact on disease of childhood, but the impact on diseases of adulthood has been substantial.
dr. amy offers explanations and information.
poor diet, poor lifestyle, and lack of exercise can contribute to lack of energy, depression and generally feeling unwell.

considering that the evidence seems to be pointing to viruses playing a key role in many cancers (as well as lifestyle choices, like smoking, in some), your claims that cancer is a result of aging aren’t actually very scientific.

this is in accordance with the occurrence of a right sided fecal reservoir and the fact that dietary fiber reduces transit time[17].

not without a study that compared groups of people with access to modern medicine, but with one living on a traditional diet and the other on a diet of food produced by “industrial farming methods.”
anyone familiar with contemporary medical literature at the turn of the 20th century also knows that native african and asian populations suffered very little from diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and cavities, but saw rapid increases in all of these diseases upon the adoption of the western “industrial agricultural” diet.
# alex knapp on 19 feb 2010 at 3:52 pm amy, hg individuals were not obese.
diseases of old age can become primary causes of death only when diseases of infancy and childhood are vanquished, and that is precisely what has happened.
it does us no good to form our arguments in such as way as to read: alternative health advocates claim pesticides are bad and modern diseases are caused by the environment, alternative health advocates are stupid, therefore pesticides are good and modern disease can’t be avoid only cured.

funny, i’m in a college class on conservation biology and community ecology, where we are currently learning about the history of the conservation movement and efforts to save biodiversity.
it was beneficial for the new meat eaters anyway.
i do agree with dr. tuteur that there is no evolutionary advantages to having people live past reproductive age.
i don’t think anyone has disputed that agriculture can support a larger population than hunting and gathering.
published safety statistics for home births are pretty good, but their validity has been questioned.
i realize that i may not correctly understand what is meant by ebm although from a quick glance i suspect that it isn’t written in stone and that different institutions give it different definitions.)
unlike you, i don’t feel threatened by cam – even though i don’t agree with most of what is promote under this label and find some of them downright creepy and dangerous.
(there are tons of other general info sites out there about women’s health and pregnancy so obviously this is about promoting the dr amy brand and not just being informative like most skeptics are generally doing.)

squirrelelite, i already took back my post, 3 comments up from yours, after reading more carefully.
if a placebo works in the sense that it improves the patient’s symptoms that means that a particular condition may well have a viable treatment option that doesn’t involve using a drug.
there is also the myth i’ve seen implied in some comments that technologically advanced westerners managed to conquer the “inferior” native people because they were smarter.
i don’t know very much about werner’s syndrome, but i did find it interesting that part of the recommended course of treatment was diet and exercise.
the present study illustrates graunt’s careful scientific approach, his ability to extract the essence from what by modern standards are distinctly untrustworthy demographic data, and his intuitive appreciation of the amount of interpretation his findings would tolerate.
i don’t see her as saying that the diet kills people.
thus, you have a very interesting opinion piece, full of fun speculation and plausible inference, but no level ia evidence for which you press sid.
sure we can play the “once it’s been proven by science it’s not alternative medicine it’s scientific medicine” gambit but there’s quite a bit of intellectual dishonesty in not recognizing that the claims for efficacy were once made by alternative health practitioners.
that’s without access to modern medicine, obstetrics, etc.
you can challenge me and i will be helpless before you, but this was part of my senior thesis.
i myself eat a little wild rice here and there, but overall i don’t need grains.
but it is true that decreasing infant mortality has had a disproportionate effect on life expectancy, since saving one child may add 70-80 years to their life.
my sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coronary_artery_disease#risk_factors # amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 10:54 am “while it’s true that modern medicine has improved life expectancy, particularly for infants and children, the idea that agriculture is an unequivicol good from a medical standpoint simply lacks support.
but no one tried to discredit that by proving that people live to be more than 77.7 years old.
if amy wants this “method” to be effective at “teaching” readers, she must therefore cite references, which she rarely does.
your basic premise is that life expectancy has increased from 35 to 77 due to modern medicine and agricultural advances.

# bluedevilra on 18 feb 2010 at 1:23 pm thanks for the citations.
amy’s response was that it doesn’t matter if a paleolithic diet prevents chronic disease because nobody eating it could live long enough to get chronic disease anyway.
not to mention studies of modern populations that show health benefits of removing cereal grains from the diet completely.
indeed, it usually ignores scientific evidence entirely.
that would not mean that the diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get heart disease and type ii diabetes.”
one of her premises is that c-sections do not lead to higher maternal mortality (perhaps morbidity).
all of these are the tactics of woo merchants that peddle pseudoscience to promote an ideological position and fox news reporters and not of sbm bloggers or skeptical thinkers.

i don’t think h-g ate much grain at all).
someone lost a lot of weight on a peleo diet which includes times of fasting.
the other thing worth mentioning is that communication plays a key role in shaping public perception of both cam and sbm, which is why i personally think it’s a big deal not to use cam/propaganda/advertising methodology which isn’t about promoting critical or reality-based thinking.
you know the one: “what have the roman’s ever done for us” as long as you take out all the people who died early, people in the 1900s lived just as long as we do today.
i’m not saying this is true, i’m saying that given that humans are social animals, there may be evolutionary advantages to longer life spans beyond mere reproductive age and accordingly it’s dangerous to write off over 40 as “old” from an evolutionary perspective.
other medbloggers have disclaimers explaining that they can’t respond to personal questions, but i’m sure your method works just as well.
karl: stunted growth: it doesn’t take a lot of food restriction to stunt growth.
i suspect people romanticize our h-g ancestors because they fancy the idea that if we had to return to those uncivilized times, then they would be the one’s who survive.
this is a disease in which the natural course of life is altered by a mutation in the wrn gene (obviously so named because of the investigation into werner’s syndrome).
seriously, you’re not even arguing from basic logic, science or interest in contemporay human health anymore but from a purely reactionary and non-evidence based prejudice against a paleolithic diet and all kinds of things you lump in together willynilly.
it also includes studies of nutrition and demonstrates that in terms of minerals and vitamins, people in the region didn’t catch up to hunter-gatherers until relatively recently.
fifi – sorry, i was going from past memory of my diapering days and the amazon description… “hypo-allergenic and offering soft, cloth-like comfort and premium absorbency, these diapers are made of chlorine-free absorbent materials that do not contribute to dioxin pollution.”
since commentators do not submit a cv, i’m not sure how you can know whether or not they are doctors or scientists.

in her opinion, stone age people would have had cancer and heart disease if they didn’t die so young (ad she steadfastly ignores the infant mortality factor).

amy, citing a royal family of europe as “the most likely to live long” is probably a bad idea, since they were terribly inbred and had many people gunning for their thrones.
i do it, but it’s scary, because drivers do not watch for bicyclists or pedestrians, in general.
btw, the 3-7 range takes into account the presence of confounders.
that’s not surprising when you consider that it never worked in times past; advocates of alternative health merely pretend that it did, without any regard for historical reality.
i’d be concerned if i were being repeatedly criticized by doctors and scientists who provided relevant quotes from appropriate papers.
4 – the iv fluids and antibiotics that cured the typhoid i got out of my own stupidity because i forgot to get a booster shot not “alive”, but cured of a chlamydia eye infection that would have left them blind a few months earlier – one entire litter of kittens that got an experimental drug that had been developed in rabbits for use on humans, and proven to work in human babies … for once the “animal research” went the other way.
on the other hand, i try hard to keep that persona (mostly) separate from my work at sbm, although regular readers of both recognize that from time to time i crosspost.
because otherwise all you’re doing is giving credence to the critics of sbm in the eyes of the public and presenting an image of science that has nothing to do with the ethical practice of science or educating the public.
in addition to the weight loss from 235 to 175 so far, i’m off the allergy meds i was on since i was a teenager, gurd meds, and without meds i brought my average bp from 150-160 / 95-105 to normal ranges.
i find it odd that you’re posting here since, generally speaking, the quality of writing and analysis of other sbm bloggers is so much better that what you post.
i think that modern medicine is a wonderful thing.
for one thing, prehistoric lifespans are hard to estimate.
taking into account that both you and dr tutuer are sharing personal meanings regarding the term “alternative medicine”, i think it’s important to note that there’s increasingly sound scientific evidence for meditation and exercise for managing stress and chronic pain.
“i was explaining that proponents of the provocative style argue that if you are to educate people in critical thinking, you must provoke them to engage in their own literature research.
that’s why she hasn’t been able to make it in scientific communication outside the blogging world.
if the student’s analysis was based on less renown journals, then it would tend to be dismissed without much comment.
if the diet is the same, people who are healthy when they eat it are more genetically fit than people who are not healthy when they eat it.
though it definitely seems that there is a huge spectrum of global warming dissidents.
everyone likes to imagine they would be the sole survivor during a zombie holocaust.
it’s well documented that the incidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer populations vs. agricultural populations.
additionally, the stuides done between native and westernized populations in the early 20th century were controlled for age and still found lower prevalence of diabetes, cancer, and heart disease in those eating a tradtional diet vs. a western one.
as the primary causes of death in childhood and early adulthood have been vanquished, it is only appropriate that we turn our focus to the diseases of old age.
sometimes i resurrect old posts from my other blog that i am particularly proud of and update them for sbm.
his books discussing agw are so riddled with errors of science that it’s really quite impossible to figure out when what he is arguing is science-based and when it isn’t if you don’t already know quite a bit about the science.
however, none of them stand to profit from writing their blogs (or commenting here).
i don’t have a reference either but i think amy is correct about the average life expectancy.
epidemiologists generally agree that communicable diseases were already decreasing when vax were invented.
they are herb-based pharmaceuticals.
i’m getting really tired of repeating myself, here.
it’s clear that many would have lived much longer today, given nutrition, pre-natal care, competent ob-gyn care, anti-biotics, vaccinations and all the things we take for granted.
there are low rates of infectious disease (because they’re an isolated population) and they follow a hunter-gatherer diet as they are non-agricultural (although, of course, that’s changing.)
to die antiseptically in a hospital was almost unknown.
likewise, i eat a paleo diet because the best available, peer-reviewed medical research that i can find indicates that it’s the best way to lower the risk factors for chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, etc.
lindeberg’s kitavan studies that i cited above did not check for incidence of diabetes, but the virtual non-existence of ischemic heart disease is suggestive that diabetes rates are low among their elderly population as well.
food can be cultivated more intensively, grain can be stored, babies can be weaned earlier.
it also includes studies of nutrition and demonstrates that in terms of minerals and vitamins, people in the region didn’t catch up to hunter-gatherers until relatively recently.
it’s well documented that the incidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer populations vs. agricultural populations.
i believe the current life expectancy for a 50 year old white male is about 34 years, more or less.
and for most people during most of human existence, preventing heart disease was irrelevant, since they died long before they could be afflicted with it.
i’m of the belief that it can be healthy to challenge oneself and to read more than just what one likes.
there were posters here saying that amy’s opinions on what the science says (regarding herbal treatments) was different from harriet’s opinon of what the science says.
sounds awful to me, but people moved there because they liked it.
unfortunately she doesn’t do a great job, for a couple of reasons.
i don’t think i’ve ever seen a blog here by any of the other sbm posters without a single outside link or source of information.
i certainly have used a “devil’s advocate” position in the classroom as the teacher, as well as the socratic method.
the unadulterated kind good for lemurs or buffalo or kangaroos or trees.
i am to belief that alternative health believes that the past was a paradise.
he presented contemporary studies and didn’t simply make grand (and often inaccurate) assertions about the past like you’ve been doing.
i am really really suprised that many can’t see how she overly simplifies complicated medical and science topics.
even the muslims, who as an article of religious doctrine, are expected to nurse for two years, will introduce solids by six months.
i ask that purely in the interest of transparency and imply no conflict of interest, merely questioning the assumption that no profits are involved in blogging for sbm.
# sid offit on 18 feb 2010 at 11:45 am @david the vast majority due to childhood infectious diseases, diseases, i note, that have now been largely brought under control by vaccines, antibiotics, and advances in medical care.
it’s just sad and it’s detrimental to actually getting anyone to respect or trust sbm (not that you actually care about that since it’s all about ego for you).
but i can not believe that in all of human history every h-g tribe in every part of the world has always been able to eat the optimal diet.
perhaps chalk it up to a matter of personal taste, but in a purportedly science based venue it’s food for thought.
i eat plenty of meat, fruits, vegetables, and nuts with some moderate amounts of cheese and greek yogurt.
quite often the bloggers here touch upon these subjects directly or indirectly, and they also usually do very good breakdowns of the research done in these areas.
it would be interesting to have sbm examine some of the purported health effects of global warming in the ipcc reports.
however, when you go to its origins i noted that it was begun by medical researchers who took the time and trouble to conduct good studies, and published their work in peer-reviewed journals.
ask dr. amy.com accepts credit cards and paypal.
al. study i cited above, which makes precisely the point in comparing two similar populations, one pre-agriculture and the other post-agriculture.
the idea that all life in nature is short and brutish seems to be as much a product of colonial mentality as the notion of the noble savage is – neither seem particularly accurate and both seem to look at nature from a rather misinformed and antiquated perspective that’s really not very scientific (at least in contemporary terms).
industrial vegetable oils high in pro-inflammatory omega 6 fatty acids some ate mostly carnivorous (masai, inuit), while others thrived on roots, fish, and coconuts (kitava, tokelau).
normally, it is very high in all species including humans, because (in my opinion) it is one of nature’s mechanisms for keeping species healthy.
moreover, this research also demonstrates that diet-related illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, and strokes are lower in incidence among the elderly of h-g groups than the elderly in the united states.
since you don’t mention what it is or link to it though, you’re hardly using this blog to drive traffic there.
i, of course, make a distinction between a cure and simply making someone subjectively feel better but it’s worth remembering what the patient is actually seeking…which is often to simply feel better or be supported in some way.
mainly because i used to like to send people here to educate themselves about science and medicine and you’re like the anti-carl sagan – you’re guaranteed to turn off the general public and you make sbm look like an ideology that’s uncritically pro-industry and big pharma rather than equally critical and looking out for the public good.
this is actually a testable hypothesis, so someone with anthropological savvy (not me) can probably go and look up the data.
at the least, i abhor the catholic restrictions on birth control (for example).
# doctorlaw on 18 feb 2010 at 5:12 pm showmedadata correctly points out that dr. tuteur paints with a broad brush, just like fundies do.
it’s not “looking to some mythical past”–it’s noting that hey, the modern diet doesn’t promote health, longevity, or a good quality of life.
this may be a bit of an argument from ignorance, but i don’t know how we can repeatably and reliably define the relative quality of sitting around a campfire ” no, but we can look at the number of people starving and still dying of infectious disease around the world.
(we don’t have to go back very far i the history of our own cities to see how a more localized farming system can work.)
me, i tend to find a gleeful irony in the fact that woo-woo sellers are, inadvertently, funding their arch nemeses.
it would just mean that those people would probably be happier if they dialled back the fibre and made an effort to include more butter in their diets.
as per fifi’s point above, if it turns out that a) there is something that it makes sense to call a “paleolithic diet,” and b) that it coincidentally is associated with lower rates of heart disease in people who have access to modern medicine, then c) a plausible hypothesis would be that evolution preferentially selected for paleolithic humans who had lower rates of heart disease when eating the diet available to them.
first, she doesn’t make adequate distinction between “the past” (in the traditional fallacy) and “nature” (in the natural fallacy) – and that has been the cause of a lot of the comment on this thread.
i actually prefer the idea that she is deliberately using a pedagogical technique of withholding crucial elements or including distractors to get her readers to think for themselves.
ironically, i got interested in the “stone-age diet” for the purpose of debunking it.
i see her as saying that , even if the diet eaten in paletolithic time was the ideal diet for no heart disease, etc it didn’t help protect the paleolithic people from sucummbing from non-dietary related illnesses and accidents that shortened the lifespan because of the paleolithic people did not have the medical knowledge and medicine to treat or cure those illnesses and accidents.
moreover, by any parameter you wish to name, modern americans are healthier and live longer than individuals in hunter gatherer populations.
because amy shows no restraint in talking about things she doesn’t actually understand, and does not qualify her statements, i can’t trust anything she says.
i agree that romanticising the past and nature is silly.
i just hope it won’t be to the detriment of the purpose of a sbm blog in the first place.
“the scientific american article points out that kyoto was never *intended* to be the “solution” to global warming.
additionally, when comparative studies have been done of people who do not follow western diets, the prevalence of diabetes and heart disease is diminished even among the elderly compared to those with western diets.
the female menopause, which kicks in at 50, is also evidence that our ‘time gone by’ relatives lived well passed 35.
jmb thanks for taking time to explain your point of view.
to clarify my point, in the medical school method being discussed, the stick and carrot are being employed simultaneously, and the students are invested in (literally) obtaining that carrot.
“hmm, i wonder if i’m the only one lucky enough to have never needed life saving medicine” the closest i’ve gotten is a couple of stitches in my knee when a car kocked me off my motorcycle.
oh well, if whack-a-mole doesn’t appeal, then there is always….not carrying googleads.
(these three above are all short term studies, alas, but all of them note lowered triglycerides, increased insulin sensitivity, and other improvements in measures of health from even a short term stint on a h-g type diet.)
my wife is currently expecting, and believe me, we have a great ob–not a midwife.
# amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 12:02 pm “it’s well documented that the incidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer populations vs. agricultural populations.”
but the fact that she didn’t know what she was talking about was no obstacle to her: she made indefensible statements and generated comments.
you don’t actually need to be able to analyze all the scientific studies to do this as a skeptical thinker, there are rote clichés and tactics that get used when people are doing cargo cult science blogging or misrepresenting ideology as being evidence/science-based and you’ve used most of them.

actually, a great deal of “bemoaning the current state of american health” is being done by medical experts and doctors.
most work long hours, women with young children often have to work.
the composition of the article has a central theme about romanticizing the past, other than the scientific argument, that makes it more interesting.
but when i do eat, there’s no real skimping.
it also tends to result in wars and the fostering and spread of disease.
“which compared the archaeological evidence of two groups of native americans in the same region, of which one was a hunter-gatherer society (referred to as “indian knoll”) and the other was agricultural (referred to as “hardin village”).
we have lots of serious problems now.
after all, the foundation of science as a philosophy is that people have the potential to be highly rational creatures.
learning from some of our past mistakes and actually living in reality might be a good place to start!
i would argue the incidence of ischemic heart disease and cancer is higher in the 75 year old doing everything right, than in a 25 year old doing everything wrong, but i do not have a citation, just clinical experience.
if we simply routinely read or support opinions because they align with our own then we’re simply feeding a confirmation bias.
i don’t think it’s necessary to assume that everything about hunter-gather societies was perfect to recognize that it drove most of our evolution, and that significant deviations from the lifestyle may need to be compensated for – for instance, through technology.
copy and pasting a link, which might impress lay people, carries no weight here.”
here’s why: the claim is that (in regards to paleo diet) a) people of yesteryear ate “better” as per their reliance on natural foods; and b) avoided diseases as a result of that; and c)
such an explanation would be independent of the facts about hunter-gatherer societies, etc..that people are arguing about in this thread.
if we extrapolate the current measured rate of improvement in longevity backward in time, we would end up with an intuitively ridiculous life expectancy of zero somewhere between 1850 and 1750.
population density and settlements dramatically increased with the agricultural revolution, causing unintended consequences of infectious disease.
dr. tuteur: “there’s actually no good data to show that c-sections increase the risk of maternal death, despite a number of studies that make that claim.”
even with a lower growth rate, human hunter/gatherer societies managed to cover most of the planet.
the bold assertions: “there is not a jot of evidence” and “bogus treatments” are fine because they are true and there is evidence to back them up, but if you have to stick strictly with what the evidence says, it confines you to making statements that run into a long paragraphs of explanations and qualifications.
amy, the best measure of evolutionary success is population growth, and by that measure, agriculture was an extraordinary triumph.
i’d say you’re more influenced by having worked in the military than anything else from what i’ve read of your posts and certain very traditional perspectives you promote.
plonit is a practicing health professional like the practicing doctors and researchers who blog and comment on this site are – it’s not at all the same as selling yourself as a brand or online expert (plus plonit is not promoting herself professionally, she’s discussing medical issues and the evidence using a pseudonym).
if they are right, their success will be evident and big agra will be left in the dust.
also, agricultural societies have a downside.
i said that it wasn’t unequivicallygood.
better living conditions, nutrition, sociable justice and sanitation were instrumental in this.
so foxglove is in there.
if you want to deny that, then you will have to show an effect of the drug above placebo.
peter and i have paid gigs over at scienceblogs (marginally paid gigs), but neither peter nor i nor anyone else here gets paid for blogging for sbm.
oh well, if it’s time consuming to remove scam ads….. huh, been trying to give dr. t. the benefit of the doubt, but this post is sadly lacking in knowledge of anthropology and data to back up the claims.
i think that modern medicine is amazing.
but dr. tuteur seems to claim that all pesticides have saved lives (indirectly of course), which doesn’t make any sense to me.
all else being equal, stunted growth is typically symptomatic of malnourishment.
alison, “unqualified assertions wrt chiropractic’s ability to treat childhood asthma are correct and justified.
this is not the first instance in history where we see a strong longing for a better, more “natural” world.

“amy is completely focused on discrediting natural childbirth and its practices.
i think she paints with a broad brush for impact.
not having a penis, i can’t really comment from a penis having perspective on male circumcision and as a lover of penises it’s all about the individual penis and who it’s attached to so no fetishistic preference there either.
in fact, i accepted the statement, “all else being equal, stunted growth is typically symptomatic of malnourishment.”
the failure rate is for that small chance you’ll ovulate before menstruating, but many women have an anovulatory period the first time.
i drew the analogy to religious fundamentalism because fundamentalists of all stripes tell themselves and each other that they are recreating the past, when that “past” exists only in their imaginations.
it was caused by extremely successful agriculture that supported a large (but impoverished) population that could not be supported by anything else.
a few people could feed an entire civilization.
clearly we do have some control over some aspects of our health so it makes sense to practice preventative medicine of various kinds.
i can be honest and say that i may not be as intelligent as some of you folks here, and my masters degree is not in the sciences, but i can plainly see that amy tuteur’s blog entries are not of the same quality as the other blog entries by sbm contributors.
i was giving you a friendly word of advice out of respect.
once again dr tuteur is making it appear as if medicine doesn’t promote exercise and a healthy diet as basic preventative medicine (and that these are the domain of “alternative health” rather than medicine).
in contrast, agriculture allowed for a population explosion that has been continuing to this day.
on 19 feb 2010 at 6:30 am “hmm, i wonder if i’m the only one lucky enough to have never needed life saving medicine” the closest i’ve gotten is a couple of stitches in my knee when a car kocked me off my motorcycle.
dr tuteur – “that would not mean that the diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get heart disease and type ii diabetes.”
for example, research from asia indicates that the switch to a predominantly cultivated rice diet did not result in a deterioration of dental health.
sounds great… when i see quantum extinction of an individual, i’ll hurry to see that homeopath.

we also haven’t been talking about pastoralists, who are probably the healthiest of the preindustrial groups.
they also are careful to make qualifiers.

and it’s clear that a combination of modern birth control, modern infection control and modern obstetrics reduces perinatal mortality.
i’ve also read that agriculture has been around for about 10,000 years, while h. sapiens have been around for 100,000 years, and we branched off from chimps 5 million years ago.
the premise of the paleolithic diet is not that it offered anyone an evolutionary advantage.
they’re tall, mobile and have ready access to animal protein.
alex knapp, yes, the whole stone age diet/lifestyle appears quite sensible to me on many levels, though i have only the briefest of exposures to the theory/ philosophy/ whatever it is.
the mean intake of calories in these groups is around 2800-3200 calories.
moreover, it is predicated on the unquestioned assumption that the amount of food available was adequate.
but it does not follow that absolutely everything about post-industrial life is better than any imaginable aspect of pre-industrial life.
with a little supplementation, an adult can live on bananas.
it’s possible that termites eat wood because that’s all that’s available to them, but that they would be much healthier as individuals and larger as a population if they were to eat whiskey instead because it has higher caloric density.
heh, dr amy’s pregnancy store even sells baby einstein videos…nice endorsement of baby woo there dr amy! http://astore.amazon.com/askdramy-20 today simon singh goes to court.
mxh, referring to a dermatologist, “she pointed to our prehistoric ancestors and said that they were fine without using soap.”
dr hall – certainly bowing out of discussing lomborg is up to you but pretending that his misrepresentation of climate science is no big deal and just a matter of subjective opinion is kind of strange on an sbm blog.
indeed, i would venture to guess that you keep throwing out citations because constructing an argument to support your claim is literally impossible.
in the case of simon singh vs. bca, he was referring to chiropractic claims to treat childhood illnesses including asthma.
earlier weaning of infants leads to more children per mother, all other things being equal.
if early childhood illness didn’t get you, and early adulthood illness didn’t get you, and middle age illness didn’t get you, you certainly could live to a ripe old age.
replacing one religion with another isn’t freeing oneself from the fallacies of religion, it’s simply rejecting reality for another form of religion that pretends to be reality and not a religion.
the days of yore were tough, and a [...] alive because of science-based medicine – me 1 – childhood fever of some sort … sulfa drugs saved me.
i can respect a libertarian position that simply knowing agw exists doesn’t necessitate governmental involvement, even if i don’t agree.
a few weeks ago on the skeptic guide to universe, steve novella commented on the dangers of living in an environmental that was too sterile, and how people living in the developing world may have an edge over us because their bodies develop more antibodies and have less examples of incidents of allergies.
you stand alone in being in the position of having a commercial aspect to your identity as an online “skeptical” blogger and are clearly marketing a dr amy brand and not just sharing professional expertize regarding sbm or certain issues.
i cannot access anything with the work ‘blog’ in the title.
we look to science to help us build on the positive and eliminate the negative.
if you live somewhere that’s abundant in healthy food – tahiti or hawaii, or a fertile crescent or valley – you probably did pretty well in terms of longevity.
apparently there are people who believe that back in the day, ancient man lived a long, strong, and healthy life up to the minute he just dropped dead of old age one day in the middle of running around hunting and gathering nuts.
as a teacher i noticed it would certainly keep students awake in class.
# amy tuteur, md on 19 feb 2010 at 2:38 pm “c) a plausible hypothesis would be that evolution preferentially selected for paleolithic humans who had lower rates of heart disease when eating the diet available to them.”
leave me wondering if you believe that impact is placed above accuracy on a hierarchy of effective science writing skills.
advocates of alternative health bemoan the incidence of diseases like cancer and heart disease without considering that they are primarily diseases of old age.
the diseases of hunter gatherer societies don’t tend to be influenza, tuberculosis, smallpox, but things like chagas disease.
of course, i am very familiar with the naturalistic fallacy as well- romanticizing the past- i don’t like either extreme.
not that post-modernism doesn’t have its technofetishists as well and dreams of a post-human future that are just as fantastic as modernism’s promises.
he also proposes that instead of leaping wholeheartedly into expensive solutions that we “think” will work, we should test proposals to reduce global warming with a scientific approach where something is tried and the results are continuously monitored allowing adaptation of policy in response to the data.
# lizkat on 19 feb 2010 at 3:09 pm >i agree that romanticising the past and nature is silly.
however i can see how it could lead someone visiting a site with questions about pregnancy to click on one and wander down the path of woo assuming it was somehow sanctioned by the site (fi they don’t understand how google ads work).
in other words, they were not really disagreeing with the theme of the blog, but just trying to clarify or point out something that occurred to them.
i don’t think it’s necessary to assume that everything about hunter-gather societies was perfect to recognize that it drove most of our evolution, and that significant deviations from the lifestyle may need to be compensated for – for instance, through technology.
science is not about “painting with a broad brush” (and sbm is about science,no?)and i can get that type of broad brush science reporting from any mass media product.
to all those who write as if you had some personal vendetta against dr. tuteur: it is possible to discuss the content of the writing without saying derogatory things about the writer.
you’re so reactionary and ideological that you’ll even argue against a healthy diet and exercise as important for preventative health!
while it’s certainly true that declining infant mortality and conquering of childhood diseases were huge factors in increasing life expectancy, adult life expectancy has been increasing as well.
scott, “but in my experience the sticking point is precisely what was simply asserted without any detailed discussion – ‘for most of human existence, according to fossil and anthropological data, the average human lifespan was 35 years.’”
what it indicates is that the actual drug may not work in the way anticipated and be no better than a placebo.
“as far as the discussion of dr tuteur’s style, i think most medical doctors would recognize the style as a provocative style of teaching used by attending physicians and residents to get medical students to think for themselves.”
everyone likes to imagine they would be the sole survivor during a zombie holocaust.
(we’ve got an overzealous nanny filter, and it blocks a fair number of pregnancy-related websites for no good reason.)
i also will not have the heart valve complications that survivors of untreated scarlet fever often developed later in life.
i think that one of the main reasons that the past is romanticized by so many in the general public is because in addition to having no education in science, they also lack any in history and they seem to do very little reading.
i think carl sagan was very wise in cautioning skeptics of taking a tone that was too polemic, judgmental, and just plain wrong.
alison – oh, i just don’t assume that we all know about the scientific evidence for meditation and exercise (and often find it’s necessary to clarify that these are part of medicine as well as being promoted by “alternative medicine”).
personally, i wouldn’t want to live in any other time, and having followed a very rigorous paleolithic diet numerous times for sport competitions, i must admit, life really isn’t worth living unless you can have belgian pralines on occasion.
# alex knapp on 19 feb 2010 at 5:20 pm amy, so this “healthy” diet that “we evolved to eat” is responsible for the fact that hunter gathers have spread to every corner of the globe and now number in the billions.
second, humans did not abruptly stop evolving 10,000 years ago.
in one case a great aunt died of pnemounia when she went to care of her sister who was dying of breast cancer.
(and may cause some confusion for you regarding sbm as a practice and your professional/personal identity as a “skeptical blogger” that means ego comes into play in areas that should be about evidence.)
feel free to disagree with me; feel free to argue with me; but stop lying about me and stop trying to censor me.
agriculture enabled people to stop moving around all the time to follow the food source.
fun aside, maybe that means she’s actually learned something from that whole secret death sauna debacle and is backing away from the woo (or is at least trying to polish her image).
passionately held positions can be based on very solid evidence or science (and remain evidence based if one is willing to consider new evidence when it appears and/or if one’s passion is for an outcome rather than an attachment to a certain process or belief).
modern medicine didn’t get rid of diseases.
agriculture made cities possible and urbanites spent thousands of years suffering from life in various quantities of s*** before flush toilets and rotavirus vaccine were invented.
this is partly because i’m old enough to remember a time when many people didn’t have social freedoms we now tend to take for granted (and having known some survivors of the holocaust).
my mom was a hobby family historian, and the family tree is full of people who would have been saved today … deaths from childbed fever, pneumonia, and other plagues abound.
i’m not surprised they thought 70 was a normal lifespan.
it’s so much easier to overeat on our western diet.
because science journalists and media, and other researchers, are critiqued here, it’s just a matter of basic integrity to live up to the standards one sets for others.
the cassidy study i particular recommend because of how comprehensive it is, but it’s far from the only study demonstrating the same result.
please keep in mind that for a significant proportion of the people on this planet, particularly in developing nations, life is still a living hell, despite all of our technological advances.
i am alive today because of modern medicine (adding to the unscientific poll).
for example, if there is a population who lives on nothing but mcdonald’s food for the next 10,000 years and then their children suddenly started eating a high-fibre, low-fat diet, i would expect to see a huge crisis in volvulus and diseases related to cholesterol deficiency.
in that case the post would be made much clearer, simpler, tighter — better writing — by deleting all references to alternative medicine.
a high-fiber diet speeds stool transit times, reduces fecal viscosity, and inhibits fecalith formation.
science based medicine, as i understand it—is not concern who practicing, but what they are practicing.
in pr the “there’s no bad publicity” motto is common because it’s all about visibility and being in opposition to another brand (natural childbirth) makes business sense.
crops were lost from locusts, winter, and drought (twice for laura and almanzo’s case, forcing them to move to arkansas).
the one brother died of tuberculosis age 31.
i don’t find that particularly problematic, even when it is clear that you have a bias you’re unwilling to own up to (which i only ever really noted on the circumcision thread where you refused to acknowledge that having performed circumcisions may lead a doctor to not want to see them as being harmful).
they may not have had the best cancer diagnostics in the 1920s, but they could and did find tumors during autopsy, and they could and did compare the prevalence of tumors in the “native diet” v. “western diet” among the same population in the same region.
“one of her premises is that c-sections do not lead to higher maternal mortality (perhaps morbidity)”
and me, if i eat grains, i very soon have pretty strong nasal congestion.
# fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 11:01 am dr tuteur – “as jmb described above, the greatest successes in medicine have been achieved in preventing and treating the diseases of childhood, and to a lesser extent, the diseases of early and middle adulthood.
it’s difficult to take seriously the obviously biased criticism from lay people who are so invested in what i critique that they can’t be bothered to read the scientific papers and are virtually impervious to scientific evidence.
strip away the emotional overlays, and there is still an underlying emphasis on interpretation of scientific evidence.
the result was a much more cooperative, less aggressive social group that ended up having a larger population than similar chimpanzee groups because there was less violence among the chimps.)
i’m not going to take anybody’s word for something on a blog (particularly outside their area of expertise) just because they are a doctor or posting on sbm.
i have no need to ‘discredit’ you – everyone can read for themselves and form their own judgments.
while it’s true that modern medicine has improved life expectancy, particularly for infants and children, the idea that agriculture is an unequivicol good from a medical standpoint simply lacks support.
(pre-industrially she might not have had a pot full of boiling water to spill on herself in the first place, so likely moot.)
but i just had to contribute because dr. t always exaggerates the wonderfulness of modern life, and always said everything was horrible before modern medicine and technology.
she had surgery and underwent chemo and just had a clean bill of health at her 6 month check-up.
what concerns her is that patients do not really truely understand the risk they are taking, even when it is clearly spelled out to them, and will blame the doctor anyway when things do go badly wrong.
— more dependence on grain and less consumption of meat.
however, because we are arguably the most successful species in the last several hundred million years at adapting to and exploiting our environment, we have survived and expanded from a population of only a few thousand living in a small corner of africa to a population of several billion living or at least surviving in practically every environment on this planet and even off of it.
i did not say “c-sections do not lead to higher maternal mortality.”
i also have to say that for a self-described staunch defender of “science” amy definitely veers far into the realm of “woo” and telepathic/omniscient knowledge with this “your motivation is obvious.
not that the authors of psalm 90 had access to good statistics, but the numbers seem to give a good indication of what was understood to be a normal lifespan at the time.
graunt found that the average life expectancy in london was 27 years, with 65% of people dying before age 16, the vast majority due to childhood infectious diseases, diseases, i note, that have now been largely brought under control by vaccines, antibiotics, and advances in medical care.
i teach mcat prep courses to get more doctors into the medical school.
personally, i think children surviving is a pretty good indication that we have a healthier population!
furthermore, there’s haziness in your assertion that “for most of human existence” the life expectancy was 35 years..
jmb – “part of science education is teaching the critical approach to information and conclusion.
otherwise you’re back to being just like what you’re critiquing, which makes any soapbox a pretty slippery place to stand when push comes to shove.
we have not yet learned to manipulate the wrn gene in humans (they have in fruit flies), so treatment of werner’s focuses on the other factors in the disease.
fetishising nature or technology/science and making either into an ideological all-good or all-bad proposition is indulging in fantasy rather than putting on al reality-based thinking cap to figure out what what works in the real world.
the pathway is initially set by their inherited characteristics.
in 1662, he publishednatural and political observations mentioned in a following index and made upon the bills of mortality.
the average age for diaper-wearers is also 35.
as a result, we can no longer rely on mere biological or evolutionary pressures to guide us in some “right” direction.
(for example, plains indians were taller than the western calvarymen who waged war on them — see http://eh.net/xiiicongress/cd/papers/70princesteckel378.pdf).
a quick ‘back of a fag packet’ calculation suggests that to achieve an overall average of 35, the remaining 5 (of 10) adults had to have reached 70 years of age.
— iron-deficiency anemia can be protective against dysentery, as high levels of transferrin sequester iron and make it unavailable to bacteria.
i disagree and think this is an example of the problem of using sbm as opposed to ebm to evaluate health interventions.
i teach mcat prep courses to get more doctors into the medical school.
the us presidents make a reasonable sample of white males who lived past about 50 years of age.
if indeed this is amy’s modus operandi, i question the belief that this method would be as effective in the real world.

karen armstrong, who has written extensively on religious fundamentalism, has emphasized that religious fundamentalists idealize the past in similar ways and consider themselves to be returning to that past.
sbm bloggers are not paid.
when i come to sbm, i’m used to seeing citation to peer-reviewed research and analysis.
harriet hall, you are right, amy tuteur has written on a few other topics on sbm, but on her own blog you can see that she clearly loves to rail against pretty much everything natural.
more children suffered infections at hardin village than at indian knoll.
science really does not understand exactly how and why physical exercise helps to keep us healthy.
i often write that “paleo” is kitaval to inutit (70% starchy carb to near 0% carb) and everything in between.
well you’re out of touch with average americans then.
anyone familiar with contemporary medical literature at the turn of the 20th century also knows that native african and asian populations suffered very little from diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and cavities, but saw rapid increases in all of these diseases upon the adoption of the western “industrial agricultural” diet.
additionally, countless hours and labor had to be spent growing food the old way prevented people from engaging in other, perhaps more valuable, pursuits.
they are complaining because they long for an imagined past that literally never existed.
bananas are the highest-protein fruit at about 2% of calories.
there is no reason well-trained, well-equipped midwives could not deliver babies at home for those who prefer it and are willing to accept the small risk.
i chime in on non-midwifery topics on this blog as the fancy takes me, and certainly not restricted to your posts (although perhaps you don’t read the other comment threads, and why would you?).
and that most of us are still stuck with a lot of paleolithic genes.
if a living mother has no value, it makes no difference whether her children are at higher risk of down syndrome.
amy tuteur: “human beings and their ancestors have been around for millions of years, and for most of that time, they did not eat meat.
your head must be deep in the sand not to see them.
but steven, the naturalists insist those diseases didn’t exist in olden times; they are all a result of our modern, unnatural lifestyles.
further, it’s rather odd that the claims in the blog are taken as true with no research evidence, but anybody who questions the conclusions must provide iron-clad data (although these commenters are rising to the challenge, even if it’s not reciprocated).
like most species, we cope with our premature death rate by having enough babies to make up the difference, but it’s probably fair to say our wild life expectancy was in the order of 70 years, barring illness or accident or famine.
as to temporal declines occurring after vaccination remember correlation does not equal causation finally this is not to say vaccination, when practiced properly with actual vaccine, did not work or have an impact, simply that, as a major cause of mortality, smallpox was on its way out vaccine or not # sid offit on 18 feb 2010 at 3:17 pm @wales to listen to amy you’d think this guy was cliff clavin spouting off at cheers http://faculty.jhsph.edu/default.cfm?faculty_id=310 # amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 3:21 pm sid offit: “for actual data see welch and miller homage to vaccines, acute contagious diseases”
menopause makes most sense if you assume that it makes at least a small core of women not tied down with infant care available to guide and support a group of younger mothers.
i’m neither really pro nor against circumcision, it just doesn’t seem to stand up as a medically necessary procedure or a scientific practice for either boys or girls.
“he does not “completely disagree” with the kyoto protocol: rather, he shows that its actual impact on global temperatures would be positive but very small.
billyjoe – the main point is that making unqualified statements isn’t sbm writing and it’s the kind of thing sbm bloggers call out both science journalists and cam promoters for all the time.

had surgical removal of the dead baby not been possible, she could never have become pregnant again (at least not safely).

so this “healthy” diet that “we evolved to eat” is responsible for the fact that hunter gathers have spread to every corner of the globe and now number in the billions.
(if they did, they’d be malnourished; you really do need to start solids prior to age 2.
i’m happy sbm will return to being a source of good science and real skeptical thinking.
instead, i find the only thing that does work is the really humanist thing—have patience, accept them for where they are at, give people empathy, and most importantly appeal to there reason, not your judgments of them.
al. study i cited above, which makes precisely the point in comparing two similar populations, one pre-agriculture and the other post-agriculture.
thus, agricultural societies were able to overcome h-g tribes by virtue of superior weaponry and higher populations.
more children per mother, leading to earlier weaning of infants and more competition for food among children.
in times of war and famine, children who are with their mothers are less vulnerable to malnutrition than are children who are with aunts, grandmothers, fathers, stepmothers or some random stranger.

“remember, evolutionary success is measured by number of living offspring, not by length of life.
in her opinion, stone age people would have had cancer and heart disease if they didn’t die so young (ad she steadfastly ignores the infant mortality factor).
the hunter gatherer culture has been a dismal failure compared to the farming culture.
she also (almost never) takes criticism personally, which i like.
you should really attend a real organic ag conference…all the presentations are about science.
and i’d have thought it was mainly about the processing and environmental pollution myself but the marketing does play on parental fears (reality based or not) of their children being exposed to toxins.
jmb said “i was explaining that proponents of the provocative style argue that if you are to educate people in critical thinking, you must provoke them to engage in their own literature research.”
i know i’ve seen blogs and websites where people will say they don’t believe in or use allopathic medicine and only use natural herbs, plants and traditional remedies that have been used for 1000s of years because it’s far superior to “allopathic” and modern medicine.
for instance, hunter-gatherers tended to get more exercise than cube-farm dwellers.
part of the job as a resident is to teach those with less experience, so most doctors have some limited teaching experience.
actually, quite a few have examined the peer-reviewed, scientific evidence and noted that, when you control for the problems of infectious disease and infant mortality, people on a h-g diet exhibit more robust health and have fewer incidences of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
so agriculture has been a very small percentage of our history.
i don’t understand why your so resistant to this.
wikipedia says that trephining was good for them if someone had smashed their heads with a club and they needed to let out the blood that pooled under the skull, and we do in fact do it today for similar reasons except that we call it craniotomy.
i used to teach in medical school.
i’d suggest that youmay well feel somewhat threatened by cam (and particularly by natural birth advocates) since you keep bringing up being threatened and projecting it onto people who obviously aren’t threatened by what you write (though they may disagree).
so the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease and type ii diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything else.
absent that study, you can have an opinion, but it won’t be a science-based one.”
i can point to my own famiy history where my grandmother has an older half-sister, my great grandfather’s first wife died, he remarried to my great grandmother and she raised her stepdaughter and her own children.

i think it is very important for those who carry the flag or reason, skepticism, and science to ensure that they don’t fall into the same rhetorical pitfalls and generally confused thinking that we purpose to be against.
in the absence of potatoes, the irish either had to leave (like good hunter-gatherers) or use capital (which they didn’t have but the english did) to import food.

karen armstrong, who has written extensively on religious fundamentalism, has emphasized that religious fundamentalists idealize the past in similar ways and consider themselves to be returning to that past.
not only that, different peoples evolved differently due to different evolutionary pressures.
coming up with solid evidence about what things were like in the past, especially evidence that is meaningful to the general public, is very difficult.
zoe237 (11:39 pm) i agree with your point about quality of life for as many people as possible being important.
living in accordance with the nature we evolved with — to some degree anyway — requires conscious effort.
years, people who did well on it were more genetically fit because that’s all there was.
so anything that reduces the amount of land we use for farming is good, unless it’s dumping more dangerous pesticides and fertilizers (including cow manure– it’s also a burden) into the local ecosystems.
there is no reason to assume that the reason hunter-gatherer groups are smaller than traditional agricultural groups is that their death rates are higher.
i believe that by eating a diet that mimics the macronutrient composition of hunter-gatherer groups that yes, i will see lowered risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
if evolution selected paleolithic people for lower rates of heart disease, that suggests that enough of them were living long enough that heart disease mattered.
when pressed, they can’t provide any actual evidence for that proposition, of course.
the argument was that there was less infection because one, they were crowded close together in one spot.
anyway, iow, the low population density of h-g, due to lack of agriculture, lead to fewer infections, not their diet.

# ericg on 19 feb 2010 at 5:43 pm alison, fairly enough, most of what is contained within the paleo diet is roundly accepted as nutritious food.
absent that study, you can have an opinion, but it won’t be a science-based one.
i think there’s still a lot of work to do, but it’s a strong hypothesis and the data from populations eating traditional, non-western diets is compelling enough for me to have cut grains out of my diet in an effort to lower my risk factors for chronic diseases.

i suspect, but do not know, that alex and others are concerned about the dangers of “industrial farming”.
actually it’s pretty clear that despite liking to be sciency and elevating herself on an sbm soapbox to legitimitize her opinions, dr tuteur isn’t actually experienced as a medical researcher and is hostile to researchers that don’t support her ideological position (going so far as to make ad hominem attacks on them and casting aspersions on their professionalism).
in a traditional lifestyle, some people really do face horrible choices.
after the first couple of weeks of weaning myself off grains, i don’t count calories at all, but then again i don’t have to.

51-73)] — which studies populations in the mediterranean region over time and shows life expectancy dropping after the invention of agriculture, and not rising again for a few thousand years, then dropping again during the middle ages, then coming back up again.
i will grant you that stone-ground, unsifted flours are healthier than modern refined flowers, but archaeological comparisons of health belie the claim that that cereal grain consumption is health-promoting beyond the mere provision of calories.

it works and its mode of action is explained by science (therefore not alternative) but pharmaceuticals are more predictable (therefore science doesn’t support using foxglove over pharmaceuticals if pharmaceuticals are available, therefore alternative in most modern contexts).
they may be using various methods to reduce birth rates to keep group size manageable.
i don’t feel threatened by what you write – as much as you want to believe this about yourself all you do when you repeat this is highlight how much your ego is wrapped up in this image of yourself and how you project onto others so much that you can’t hear or see what is being written (and are incapable of being self reflective).
you’re so reactionary and ideological that you’ll even argue against a healthy diet and exercise as important for preventative health!

while i find alt medicine claims about “tradition” as being some form of proof silly, i also find it quite entertaining that dr tuteur herself seems unable to move beyond certain traditional medical beliefs that contemporary medical science doesn’t subscribe to and is actually quite reactionary in her beliefs rather than curious about contemporary science and new discoveries.
highly-paid obstetrical expertise is not needed for most births.
i suppose it is possible that all of the scientists disagreeing with lomberg are simply having emotional reactions, but i doubt it.
i also thought the business of being born post was well balanced (unlike dr. t), but lacking in research to back it up.
but i think there’s powerful evidence to suggest that diet and lifestyle choices make a dramatic difference in longevity and quality of life, all else being equal.
that doesn’t mean that everyone is going to survive an infection (depending on what the infection is).
i am amazed at how the emotional reaction to the subject of global warming led readers to react to what they wanted to think lomborg wrote rather than to what he actually said.
in the meantime, life in crowded medieval and industrial cities could be quite disgusting and unsanitary, killing babies and otherwise-healthy young people.
that’s not because their diet was so fabulous.
she doesn’t make disclaimers, even after repeated requests for clarification.
that said, fantasies about industrialization/technology are equally as silly.
4-dr tuteur uses all the same tactics as woo merchants in trying to discredit commenters, research scientists who don’t support her opinion and those she’s in financial competition with; in cherry picking the science she presents to support her pre-existing opinion and doing a cargo cult ritual of being scientific; and by trying to pass off opinion as sbm.
# fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 3:06 pm unfortunately dr tuteur seems to wantonly ignore whole fields of medical science and likes to make grand proclamations about fields of medicine that are outside of her specialty as an ob/gyn.
however, after reading dr. amy tuteur post, and the numerous comments following it, i feel somewhat obligated to speak up.
it’s why you get engineers and graduates of computer and political science who think that the “science” part or having done statistics means they’re equally qualified in medical science.
she says people are getting heart disease and cancer only because modern medicine has given them so many additional years of life.
if you are going to call someone out for not supporting their position with peer-reviewed research and analysis, you’d better make sure your not standing in a glass house when you do it.
imo, even that pleasure should account for something that even the prehistoric derm should recognize as valuable.
hobbes was talking about politics when he wrote that life in the state of nature was “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” but his words are equally true of health conditions.
just because all these competing commercial and ego interests that pose as left/right (liberal/conservative) are using the issue of climate change to further personal, political or corporate agendas doesn’t mean that climate change and environmental damage from pollution isn’t happening.
“i would argue that a modern fast-paced and stressful life where more junk food is available and cheap, and people aren’t as physically active as they used to be to run their own households and farms/gardens, can mean a lower quality of health for an increasing number of people.”
we weren’t very good at identifying cancer before the development of modern medicine.
although appalling, this is probably in line with mortality rates in other ape and primate species.
this despite the fact that i’ve cited quite a bit of peer-reviewed research indicating that populations subsisting on h-g diets had life expectancies that many agricultural societies could not match until the 19th and 20th centuries.
i think that modern medicine is a wonderful thing.
is it not possible, and reasonable, to say that human lifespan has been greatly increased by childhood vaccination and other useful medical interventions, but also that our average lifespan (not to mention happiness)
“so much for the evolutionary advantage of the hunter gatherer diet: it has led to the near extinction of the hunter gatherers.”
fifi, “billyjoe – actually, i’d rather see singh’s quotes in context since he’s actually not just making non-evidence based assertions and generalizations as you seem to think he is when you see him quoted out of context. ”
agriculture may lead to: — more sewage to deal with, more water-borne disease to fight off, therefore less energy available to fuel growth even with the same amount of food.
it’s very convenient for you to sit around debating laypeople all day.
the other thing we can do is look at our ape cousins who are hunter-gatherers (both chimps and bonobos).
the end result is that she very often resembles the very ideologues and promoters of pseudoscience that she’s berating!)
one potential complicator: men and women both care for the children, but although male fertility does decline with age, they don’t really have any equivalent to menopause.
additionally, countless hours and labor had to be spent growing food the old way prevented people from engaging in other, perhaps more valuable, pursuits.
here dr hall dismisses his mistakes regarding the science and claims that there’s no ulterior motive and isn’t promoting pseudoscience.
4 – the iv fluids and antibiotics that cured the typhoid i got out of my own stupidity because i forgot to get a booster shot not “alive”, but cured of a chlamydia eye infection that would have left them blind a few months earlier – one entire litter of kittens that got an experimental drug that had been developed in rabbits for use on humans, and proven to work in human babies … for once the “animal research” went the other way.
she died during pregnancy, either of typhus or a pregnancy-related condition.
i suspect that there is a lot of evidence that shows that before the introduction of “modern methods” of farming, many people died of starvation because enough food could not be produced the old way.
fitness is about the production of successful offspring and the population boom in the last 100 years has clearly shown that the evolution of agriculture benefited us as a species.
agriculture as the basis of our lifestyle has only been around for the past 10,000 years, probably 1% of our evolutionary history.
but for the rest, i follow her blog for the community of argumentative commenters that she builds, many of who understand a particular field much better than amy does and are able to discuss it intelligently.
ants evolved to live in large, stationary communities.
on the other hand, amy is new to this lil’ corner of the blogosphere, so i expect her commentary to become more measured in the future.
while i doubt i’m celiac, and i do seem to tolerate lactose in reasonable quantity, i have a brother with mild chron’s.
husband: his mother had hepatitis while pregnant and had to be hospitalized; it’s very likely the pregnancy would not have been successful without treatment, and as it is, he was born several weeks late and only 7 pounds (in a family where the babies tend to be big).
3 – the smallpox, whooping cough, polio i didn’t have to worry about because my parents believed in vaccines.
if al makes 4 claims and 2 are shown to be errors the ratio would also be 0.5.
evidently, a toxin in the algal blooms can cause seizures in sea lions and humans and even cause a permanent epileptic condition in the brain.
my perception is that other sbm bloggers give the kind of thoughtful , sometimes long winded (and occasionally arrogant, which is tolerable if accompanied by accuracy) comments that are required of a complex subject.
(for instance, you were called out on your very first blog for inappropriately accusing researchers of having nefarious motives and fiddling data – an emotional and ad hominem attack – and then you did exactly the same thing again in your blog about antidepressants.
my personal feeling regarding these diets is that the quantity of the food and not the quality will turn out to be critical.
billyjoe on herbal treatments: “herbal treatments are useless.”
even though health has been improved dramatically, we recognize that it can be improved even further.
the past may not have been a golden age, but it doesn’t follow from that that we have nothing to learn from it.
if dr. hall has a bias on the matter of circumcision, it’s nothing like dr. tuteur’s (just look at the difference of their titles of the blog posts on circumcision).
it can be identified in young people, it can be controlled by diet, but the prevalence of disease will increase as the population ages.
malnutrition was endemic, almost always compromising health.
as far as the discussion of dr tuteur’s style, i think most medical doctors would recognize the style as a provocative style of teaching used by attending physicians and residents to get medical students to think for themselves.
we would just keep popping them out until we keeled over.
public health measures may account for a significant fraction in improvement between 1900 and 1950, but modern medicine would still have had an effect.
she repeatedly says that cancer and heart disease are normal diseases of aging.
if you check several of the studies i’ve cited here, modern, european-descended populations show improved health on diets modeling that of the macronutrient composition of paleolithic tribes.
they were not random mistakes, as one might expect if he were just getting it wrong without an agenda.
you, sw, have come from my personal blog where you have submitted more than a hundred comments all glorifying your personal birth choices and demeaning women who make different choices.
if you want to educate people about how to critically read media, how to deconstruct an argument for themselves and how not to get sucked into sensationalist or bogus “common sense” assertions, you can’t use dodgy methods yourself and claim they’re legitimate or critical thinking when you use them but dodgy when others do.
absent that study, you can have an opinion, but it won’t be a science-based one.
so i think the notion that if one survived to 50 or so in 1870 one could have expected to reach about the same age as a 50 year old can expect now is wrong on the facts.
it’s not a sbm piece by any stretch, just me commenting on my frustration with the alt med folks and their love of mystifying the past.
she was on a vent for 5 days, cpap for 5 days, and oxygen for a month.
that says more about the readers than about the text.
we could change that situation, and in the process reduce the risk of diseases like diabetes (not a disease of old age these days).
it additionally becomes enormously absurd because all of the things that various charlatans and cam foodies say are necessary for health would have been exclusive to a particular region and particularly impossible for any one group or individual to acquire anyway.
we may not know precisely what paleolithic humans were eating, but we have a pretty good idea of what they were not: refined sugar, especially fructose (wild, ancient fruits weren’t bred for hypersweetness) grains (especially gluten grains) in any appreciable amounts (just try harvesting enough wild grain to bake a loaf of bread)
my impression is that non-reproductive grandmothers are a prominent feature of the hunter-gatherer societies we know today.
dr tutuer has shown herself to be entirely uncritical of the commercial aspects of medicine, and of pseudoscience when promoted by industry.
keep your baby dry and comfortable in between changes and through the night, and go chlorine free at the same time.
the post by dr. tuteur i found a bit upsetting because it seemed to duplicate many of the things that we are supposing against.
(recreational mountain climbing with very post-industrial equipment.
well, maybe just one small qualifier then: chiropractic, defined as a realignment of subluxed vertebra as opposed to a good massage, is useless for the treatment of back pain.
when the average life expectancy rises, the incidence of diseases of old age rises too.
fetishising nature or technology/science and making either into an ideological all-good or all-bad proposition is indulging in fantasy rather than putting on al reality-based thinking cap to figure out what what works in the real world.
i’ve rambled a bit here, but my point is that you can’t point to menopause as evidence that people were generally healthy five thousand years
you don’t have a problem with my “style,” you have a problem with the substance, but lacking the ability to challenge the science, you resort to personal attacks.
sid offit: “medicine has increased lifespan but not from the fanciful 35 years amy imagines.
prunes are certainly a traditional cure for constipation – and generally pretty effective – but they do get prescribed by doctors too!
societies with high fiber intake (asia, india, africa) have less than one-tenth the incidence of appendicitis compared with locations where fiber intake is lower (europe, north america).
we most definitely still have a lot to learn and it’s a fascinating subject for those of us who love food and eating (and cooking and growing food too).
that’s because, simply put, farming is easier than hunter-gathering.
either way, it does seem like it’s taking advantage of desperate women who should simply be seeing a doctor to either find out if they’re pregnant or able to become pregnant (both situations that women can feel rather anxious and emotional about and both conditions that can’t really be evaluated via email in any meaningful way).
the context of this comment from chapter 21, credibility in science communication, pertains to scientific press releases but is relevant to science bloggers who desire to create or maintain credibility.
so this is probably a good opportunity to do some education.
thus, there’s an evolutionary advantage to long-life in humans, because pre-writing, the knowledge and experience of the elderly allowed for knowledge to be used and passed on to enhance the survival of the group and therefore children.
i do, however, expect a blogging collective that calls itself science-based medicine and purports to support and promote sbm to actually do that.
# tsudhonimh on 18 feb 2010 at 9:21 pm alive because of science-based medicine – me 1 – childhood fever of some sort … sulfa drugs saved me.
i think my reply may have got eaten by moderation, but you obviously know nothing about the remuneration of uk midwives if you think any economic benefit accrues from my “web presence”.
when the average life expectancy rises, the incidence of diseases of old age rises too.
science/medicine/technology aren’t gods, or articles of faith, they’re merely tools that us humans use that can be used constructively or destructively and to support health and happiness or create illness and despair.
there are other writers on sbm who also publish opinion pieces.
# scott on 18 feb 2010 at 8:46 am the post would be strengthened by an examination of the evidence that shows ancient life expectancies.
the nomadic mongols were, on average, taller and stronger than the peoples they conquered.
actually, a great deal of “bemoaning the current state of american health” is being done by medical experts and doctors.
all the existing scientific evidence shows that all of the myriad claims of alternative health are flat out false.
for example, john graunt reported on life expectancy in london in the 1500s and 1600s, one of the earliest examples of vital statistics.
it’s interesting to observe and challenge you because you use so many of exactly the same clichés as cam advocates and pseudoscience bloggers and writers.
# alison cummins on 19 feb 2010 at 2:46 pm lillym, i take your point, but amy was responding to alex.
that’s not because their diet was so fabulous.
the primary contributors to this site may have a difference in opinion about the importance of models in the scientific approach.
thanks for the citations.
this doesn’t mean diet changes don’t correlate to diabetes rates but this paper does not present a clear connection without other associated causes.
they eat leaves, roots, fruits, tubers, nuts and meat.
you can’t keep yourself from reading it and it frightens you because it casts serious doubts on what you believe.
further, the ability to accurately diagnose coronary artery disease (which is the form of heart disease you seem to be claiming comes from a poor diet)
it does not include organic farming, which is actually a huge problem as it requires more land than modern farming and is still dumping stuff into the ecosystem that doesn’t belong there, like manure.
i didn’t say that agriculture was unequivocally bad.
mxh, referring to a dermatologist, “she pointed to our prehistoric ancestors and said that they were fine without using soap.”
# amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 12:18 pm “while that’s true, it doesn’t change the fact that the archaeological evidence demonstrates that the incidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer societies than in agricultural ones.”
for instance, african americans are vulnerable to sickle cell anemia and sensitivity to salt and are prone to hypertension.
got an infected toe while mountain climbing.
the difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods (including pesticides). .
tons of 0 year old diaper wearers + some 80 and 90 year old ones = average age of 35.
we should be able to acknowledge the disadvantages of our technology — for example, the average american doesn’t have the time or energy for physical exercise.
a reduction in infant mortality is responsible for any increase in average lifespan and that increase had nothing to do with any of your imagined medical miracles – unless you believe not drinking filthy water to be a medical miracle # amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 11:27 am “a reduction in infant mortality is responsible for any increase in average lifespan and that increase had nothing to do with any of your imagined medical miracles” sid, you’re just the kind of person about whom i am writing, those who imagine an idealized past without bothering to acquire any knowledge of what the past was actually like.
dr. tuteur, you might want to try writing for a non-internet (print) audience (particularly, actual anthropologists) and see how many of them feel “threatened” by your lack of nuance and black and white/ either-or thinking.
i liked dr. t’s contributions, but i’m glad she’s gone if only for the fact that i won’t have to come back a week later to see what discussion developed in my blissful absence from internet distractions only to sift through 400+ posts containing mostly mind vomit.
that’s not surprising when you consider that it never worked in times past; advocates of alternative health merely pretend that it did, without any regard for historical reality.
still, in general, lactation is the best bet for birth control if you don’t have access to anything else.
the trouble is figuring out what since most of it was so riddled with errors.
such an explanation would be independent of the facts about hunter-gatherer societies, etc..that people are arguing about in this thread.
alex was saying that there’s no evidence that modern agriculture provides a healthier diet.
the pathway may be modified by accidents or infectious diseases, as well as genetic mutations.
you really don’t seem to be very well informed in these areas (but then you’ve expressed some hostility towards cognitive science and psychology and seem to equate then with woo so that’s not surprising).
kind of like living in a modern industrial city is hell for some people (life expectancy of 57 for dc african-american men) and very nice for some people, thank you very much (life expectancy of 92 for affluent asian-americans).
grandmother’s help with offspring survival.
of course, i believe that preventative medicine (vaccines) had a lot to do with it.
people living in a traditional way in okinawa are a good example of how a good diet, daily exercise (and probably some good genetic material) can play into living a long life.
i’m not quoting these statistics for precision, but merely to show that life expectancy sucked until fairly recently even for adults.
i don’t think there is any motivation in the approach, other than it helped dr tuteur, so dr tuteur feels others should be exposed to the method for possible benefit.
i’m hypothesizing that, based on the available evidence, prior to the advent of medicine and sanitation, a hunter-gatherer lifestyle appears to produce more robust health outcomes than an agricultural one.
perhaps diet, exercise and behavior combined represent a maximum of 30% predictive power of disease and death, but age (either chronologic, or based on measures of genomic intstability) represents a 50% ppv.
alex knapp, for being so critical of dr. tuteur’s lack of citations, you do a poor job yourself.
i certainly wouldn’t have wanted to live in london in the 1500s, or the 1800s for that matter.
moreover, by any parameter you wish to name, modern americans are healthier and live longer than individuals in hunter gatherer populations.
which makes sense for her to point out because there are a lot of people who believe in alternative “natural” healing that argue that not only is the paleolithic diet far superior to our modern diet but the paleolithich and “traditional” treatments and use of herbs, plants, and folk healing is far superior to science-based modern medicine.
so far dr tuteur has done all these things repeatedly and then claims to be being victimized for being called out on doing so (unless it’s a research scientist doing so who’s caught her inappropriately presenting evidence, then she’s all about the suck up…which would be fine if she was actually learning from it and didn’t simply then repeat the same emotionally-based ad hominem type of attack to try to discredit a research scientist she disagrees with yet again!)
# fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 10:02 am dr tuteur – well, to deal with reality there are some mds who peddle woo that also peddle naturalist fallacies.
http://freetheanimal.com/2010/02/real-results-dad.html lizkat said, “when dr. t refuses to even consider that our modern lifestyle may have some drawbacks” to my knowledge, dr. tuteur has never “refused to even consider that our modern lifestyle may have some drawbacks.”
that’s because neither you nor he can provide any evidence to back up their claims.
personally, this is something i need to practice on a daily basis, so it frustrates me when fellow skeptics take it for granted.
the unhealthy die prematurely.
my sister was taken into care by the children’s aid because it was feared that her stepmother would kill her and her older sister.
the point being, because one ancient method might prove to have some benefit, does not mean that all or any other methods do as well (as we all would probably agree on).
and i hypothesize that one could probably increase their lifespan substantially.
since children with genetic defects tend to die very early, and since childbearing is associated with a high risk of death, it makes biologic sense for ovulation to wind down when the quality of ova diminishes.
except these declines all took place before vaccination, antibiotics or “medical care” see richard lewontin’s triple helix p104-05 # michelle b on 18 feb 2010 at 11:51 am i am glad that science based medicine and agriculture did not really make a difference in longevity, because if they did we would have an overpopulated world.
i understood him to say that there are various predictions of the extent of global warming and that some of those predictions may be overly alarmist, that it is simplistic to only look at the bad consequences and fail to take into account even the possibility of some good consequences, that there are a lot of other bad things that need to be dealt with (disease, lack of access to clean water, etc.) that have the potential to save many lives and improve human welfare now, and that our limited economic resources should be applied judiciously considering where they can do the most good in both the short term and the long term.
i certainly wouldn’t have wanted to live in london in the 1500s, or the 1800s for that matter.
alex – “however, i think that it’s a mistake to completely write off the past and romanticize the present as being the best human society, in every aspect, that ever existed.”
that is pretty funny that the site is “ask dr amy” and then she only wants to answer questions for a fee.
one sociological study of an agricultural village looked at all kinds of variables upside down and sideways — family size, father’s family size, mother’s family size, size of land available to family, distribution of land, quality of land — to find variables that would identify children at risk of malnutrition.
after all, one huge error can trump a dozen piddling minor errors.
billyjoe – the problem is that some of the claims made about specific alternative medicine treatments have been true (not many but some, and they now more or less own the diet and exercise territory in the public eye…and let’s face it, diet and exercise are good treatments for many common ailments).
it enabled us to create cities and the specialization of labor, which subsequently allowed us to to develop modern science and medicine.
there is no evidence that the paleolithic diet was the “best” diet; it was the only diet.
however, it was true that the population of the agricultrual society was higher.
the short phrases without qualification are therefore justified.
and for prehistoric cultures, we really don’t know, and it probably varied greatly.
of course it is still possible to live a slower and less stressful life, eat nutritious food, get lots of exercise etc.
societies with high fiber intake (asia, india, africa) have less than one-tenth the incidence of appendicitis compared with locations where fiber intake is lower (europe, north america).
in that village the only variable they could find was whether the mother had a cash income or not.
it didn’t matter that the ancestors of the first meat eaters didn’t eat meat.
# zoe237 on 18 feb 2010 at 2:16 pm calli arcale: “like most species, we cope with our premature death rate by having enough babies to make up the difference, but it’s probably fair to say our wild life expectancy was in the order of 70 years, barring illness or accident or famine.
you also probably are lactose-intolerant and prone to obesity because your ancestors never gained the genes needed to tolerate modern food.
as a result all of those children (i believe about eight) were sent to live with various relatives, i don’t think any of the siblings ever lived together after that.
by that definition, any herbal treatments which are not useless (eg foxglove for dropsy, white willow bark for fever and pain) are not alternative.”
in any case, even if true, it doesn’t mean women usually made it past menopause (nor does it mean that men did).
in fact, the development of agriculture is arguably the greatest accomplishment of the human species.
we know many of those facts and concepts will change in a short period of time.
that’s why i like a good zombie survival story.
while that’s true, it doesn’t change the fact that the archaeological evidence demonstrates that theincidence of cavities is lower in hunter-gatherer societies than in agricultural ones.
it is safe to surmise that public health measures and modern medicine (as well as changes in population habits) can take credit for the more recent improvement in longevity.
i also want to point out that i’ve seen people romanticize the past and how much healthier everyone ate and how much better and simpler life was and they aren’t talking about hunter-gatherer’s they are talking about people living in the us in the 1800s.
in this segment, live from the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science in san diego, we’ll talk with researchers who are doing just that.
the hunter gathers only exist in tiny, isolated populations that will soon be extinct.
agriculture as the basis of our lifestyle has only been around for the past 10,000 years, probably 1% of our evolutionary history.
the woo alarm in my head is ringing so loud i can barely hear myself think.
it’s not a sbm piece by any stretch, just me commenting on my frustration with the alt med folks and their love of mystifying the past.
and even the more moderate chiropractors have ideas above their station.
the other segment which you can easily navigate to from the first link is about studying epilepsy in sea lions caused by harmful algal blooms (which affected a large number of people in canada several years ago when they ate some bad mussels from prince edward island).
anyone can view my comments in context and decide for themselves.
her point was that the doctor must make absolutely clear that she really does understand that risk.
some examples, my maternal grandparents both died in their 40s in the 1930s, one from a stroke probably caused by hypertension, the other from pneumonia.
i feel the spirit of dr. t’s post is intact, despite whatever complaints the usual suspects seem to have with whatever it is they complain about.
i could, of course, be wrong because the nature of the genetic disorder might complicate matters.
in contrast, agriculture allowed for a population explosion that has been continuing to this day.
nothing makes me more annoying than the fallacy that organic = ancient production methods.
once you do that, you’ll probably find both upsides and downsides.
(i did find it interesting that you seem to make a habit of attacking other bloggers in their comment sections so you seek out adversarial interaction rather than discussion or any form of constructive or positive interaction.)
this is what makes it clear that you’re using sbm as a soapbox and to try to legitimize a personal agenda and are not actually a champion of sbm and reality-based thinking or trying to educate the public about sbm.
hobbes was talking about politics when he wrote that life in the state of nature was “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” but his words are equally true of health conditions.
it’s just disaster capitalism in action, it’s hardly a new way to make oodles of cash (one good reason to know history is to be able to see patterns repeat themselves).
however, this is not the case among modern-hunter gatherer groups.
death after that would not be an evolutionary disadvantage.
you may have fooled some people with your posturing as an sbm blogger and skeptic – just like cam and antivax pseudoskeptics and climate change deniers fool some people by posturing as if they’re promoting science and skepticism – but you’re actually pretty easy to spot for anyone who is a critical thinker familiar with certain pr/propaganda/debating techniques and who isn’t just looking to affirm a particular bias they share with you.
medicine has allowed for an acceleration of that population explosion.
noting that hey, the modern diet doesn’t promote health, longevity, or a good quality of life.
while i have no interest in eating a paleolithic diet personally, i’m quite willing to accept that it may be a healthy diet if it’s scientifically proven to be so.
you appear to be a champion of brevity and your comments that “i think she paints with a broad brush for impact.
they had fewer diseases compared to modern man and were therefore superior.
of course, there are liberals on the other side who believe everything they read if it fits in their worldview.
thus, you have a very interesting opinion piece, full of fun speculation and plausible inference, but no level ia evidence for which you press sid.
i won’t argue about lomborg any more: i think it is obvious that all his readers are biased in one way or another, myself included, and further discussion would be as fruitless as the protracted debate about dr. tuteur.
context and how inappropriate to the context of sbm dr tuteur’s post were is what first made the alarms go off for me because her posts are so similar to those of cam cargo cult science bloggers and her tactics are no different than sketchy pr image management shenanigans…walks like a duck, quacks like duck…produces and sells quackery like online medical advice (for entertainment purposes and not meant as medical advice of course)….hmmm….

lomberg believes agw research is flawed.
if i understand alex’s interpretation of sbm, the lack of one very high quality study controlling for all variables, means that there is insufficient evidence to draw any reasonable conclusion.
so, the mean age would be between 34-40.
the theory put forth by alex and others seems to be that h-g’s were more fit to survive because they lived long and healthy lives.
while some in academic medicine may enjoy full support of a librarian and a nearby library of medicine, those in private practice are faced with the same problems as the lay person.
smallpox, for example, became widespread, and the hunter gatherers (along a few groups were farmers, but not of livestock) of north america were decimated by it.
perhaps the following can add to the premise of dr tuteurs article that abandoning modern medicine for the romantic notion of how we used to be healthier would be disastrous.
then you said you didn’t want to talk about it anymore without acknowledging that lomborg was actually promoting pseudoscience or misrepresenting science.
group dynamics also get selected for from an evolutionary perspective.
agriculture made cities possible and urbanites spent thousands of years suffering from life in various quantities of s*** before flush toilets and rotavirus vaccine were invented.
and for most people during most of human existence, preventing heart disease was irrelevant, since they died long before they could be afflicted with it.
yes, i’ve seen similar done in art school, but the difference is that when you disagree they do not attempt to discredit you by claiming you are just out to get them or that you are part of a “insert group here” consortium that is just trying to protect their interests.
i can’t imagine how a pre-technological society could grow substantially in population without an increase in lifespan.

there are low rates of infectious disease (because they’re an isolated population) and they follow a hunter-gatherer diet as they are non-agricultural (although, of course, that’s changing.)

actually, milloy is simply a shill for big business, both through ideology and for whom he’s worked in the past.
my point was that you aren’t even a part of the conversation in the scientific community on cesarean section or anything else.
could be increased still further if, for example, we tried eating and working and living in a manner more in line with our biology?
however, i believe that is another topic, one for now and the future, not one to use to measure how science, agricultural science and chemistry, benefited past generations.
dr. t accuses those of us who advocate a healthy lifestyle of romanticizing the past.
— iron-deficiency anemia can be protective against dysentery, as high levels of transferrin sequester iron and make it unavailable to bacteria.
it only makes sense to reduce childbearing to spare her life if her life has value to the population beyond the infants she can produce.
i would argue that a modern fast-paced and stressful life where more junk food is available and cheap, and people aren’t as physically active as they used to be to run their own households and farms/gardens, can mean a lower quality of health for an increasing number of people.
that’s why the ***data*** is so important, to take the subjectivity out.
further, the ability to accurately diagnose coronary artery disease (which is the form of heart disease you seem to be claiming comes from a poor diet) was not developed until the late 1950′s or early 1960′s via use of cardiac catheterization.
that’s what most doctor-bloggers (active and retired) do, and it is the ethical thing to do.
all in all, it seems pretty spectacularly unethical to be proposing one can tell someone via email whether their chances of being or getting pregnant are good or not.
see the following studies: apparent absence of stroke and ischaemic heart disease in a traditional melanesian island: a clinical study in kitava.
the other thing i can’t understand is people’s refusal to accept diet is not the only indicator of longevity and that access to food was an issue for hunter gatherers.
she also said that currently the average life expectancy is 77.7 years.
it’s because i think that the most vociferous commenters are not attacking me personally; they are fighting to hold onto deeply cherished opinions about themselves.
i drew the analogy to religious fundamentalism because fundamentalists of all stripes tell themselves and each other that they are recreating the past, when that “past” exists only in their imaginations.
science/medicine/technology aren’t gods, or articles of faith, they’re merely tools that us humans use that can be used constructively or destructively and to support health and happiness or create illness and despair.
moreover, the critical driver of evolution, natural selection, does not favor perfection or even health; it favors reproductive success and it tolerates a massive amount of wastage.
in fact, when life is hard, the new young wife is often not at all keen on looking after another woman’s children.

furthermore, research shows that as these people transition to the western diet (like native pacific islanders), they have extremely high rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.
it’s not a lot compared to what i make at my real job, but it’s not just a few bucks a month, either, and it’s based on traffic.
academic physicians rarely write articles about education techniques, so the provocative style is just passed on from generation to generation in medical schools.
it’s not like being an sbm blogger actually makes you more money as a physician or is a source of income – and if you’re a truly skeptical blogger that takes on unscientific medicine across the board then it may even harm your chances of being hired or promoted.
human beings and their ancestors have been around for millions of years, and for most of that time, they did not eat meat.
you seem so wrapped up ina an ideological position that you’ll even argue against evidence before you’ve even looked at the evidence!!!
i think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.”
all i can say if you are trying to use that style you should be a lot tighter in your evidence and logic than this article.
eat whole foods that don’t require industrial processing or intense agriculture, and you’re eating an essentially paleolithic diet.

of the 17 easily found in the bio, 8 didn’t survive adolescence.
we can survive almost anywhere, on a wide variety of diets.
i’d also add contemporary accounts of the mongol invastions into chinese, muslim and european terroitories.
i totally agree that dr hall’s post was much more reasonable than dr tuteur’s, even she did get a bit over the top with the fanatics and even if we disagreed on some aspects.
alternative health as a form of fundamentalism also makes sense in that it has an almost religious fervor.
a baby with this range of plant food choices needs substantial meat or breastfeeding for the first 30 months, otherwise they are at high risk of kwashiorkor.
my mom was a hobby family historian, and the family tree is full of people who would have been saved today … deaths from childbed fever, pneumonia, and other plagues abound.
this “social effect” can also be obtained from seeing a psychotherapist or md, which i would recommend over a cam practitioner for many reasons, but if that’s what people are really seeking then they can also get it from many cam practitioners.
you don’t want to contribute to obstetrics and gynecology through research and discussions in the fora of your peers, but would rather focus your intellect and energy on becoming a successful internet blogger as a fox news style pseudo-medical expert and moral pundit.
but steven, the naturalists insist those diseases didn’t exist in olden times; they are all a result of our modern, unnatural lifestyles.
i agree that many people never learn to think critically, whether it’s being able to think critically about science or art or literature.
i have an annual physical with my doctor because i want to ensure that i’m in the best possible health i can be because the best available evidence indicates that regular checkups help to promote health.

a palaeolithic diet improves glucose tolerance more than a mediterranean-like diet in individuals with ischaemic heart disease.
this shows that while diets vary broadly among modern h-g cultures, the macronutrient compositions are, in fact, quite similar.

steve rappaport reports inworlds within worlds: structures of life in sixteenth-century london that, a century earlier in the 1500s, of men who made it to age 25 to 26, the ages at which most men became full citizens, the average further life expectancy was 28 years, meaning that men who made it to adulthood would have had about a 50-50 chance of living to be older than 53 or 54.
several attendees expressed disdain for modern civilization and technology because children no longer have to do the “hard sensory work” previously required for survival.
i must say though, that you’ve taken quite a condescending and belittling tone with sid as you demand citations for evidence.. “no, no, no, that’s not how you support a claim with scientific evidence.
so i think the notion that if one survived to 50 or so in 1870 one could have expected to reach about the same age as a 50 year old can expect now is wrong on the facts.
i would scale the process of aging of a person to the genetic level of the shutting off of the wrn gene that is a factor in the rate of repair of damage to dna (of course, there will be other factors in the aging of the person).
what amy may have meant was that even if a paleolithic-style diet protects against chronic disease in post-industrial societies, it did not do so in paleolithic societies because everyone died before chronic disease could have affected them anyway.
milk, butter, and salt pork were the proteins of the diet; other meat was salted and smoked.
yet there is evidence that chiropractic works for asthma.
the reason i dislike the paleolithic diet is because while it may well be ancestral for a person whose ancestors lived in the pacific northwest, anyone whose pre-colonialism ancestors lived in a food-producing region has evolved to consume grain.
back in my university days i had a professor who used to talk about that phenomenon being quite visible in newfoundland, where sex differences in height in the older generation were less pronounced than in the younger generation.
they are complaining because they long for an imagined past that literally never existed.

simply put, he is a political scientist whose environmental conclusions go against most major scientific organizations in the world.
evolution is the result of reproductive success of individuals fittest for the particular environment in which they live.
i don’t always agree with dr hall’s perspective – and i do think she was unable to acknowledge a personal bias vis a vis circumcision (if you used to do them, there’s bound to be a desire to believe it was and is a good thing) and felt personally attacked in that instance so feels very aligned with dr tuteur because of some shared beliefs – but generally speaking she’s at least got a basic respect for science and communicates without resorting to simplistic and ideological black/white distortions.
dr. gorski and alex knapp are the only one who have provided any backup for his statements.
some examples, my maternal grandparents both died in their 40s in the 1930s, one from a stroke probably caused by hypertension, the other from pneumonia.
early findings (usually observed in the 20s) include loss and graying of hair, hoarseness, and scleroderma-like skin changes, followed by bilateral ocular cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism, skin ulcers, and osteoporosis in the 30s.
nobody else, that i can think of, has said anything about feeling attacked personally (although they probably could have, particularly “outing” plonit as a midwife).
while i don’t always agree on all matters with all the (other) bloggers who are part of the sbm collective, i generally have found that the integrity level is pretty high and most can be trusted to be honest and provide insightful analysis.
but i know most of the paleolithic diet supporters did not descend from those groups; they are well-evolved to eat whole and stone-ground grains, honey, beer and malted grains, fermented everything, vegetable and seed oils, milk, cheese, and yogurt.

when pressed, they can’t provide any actual evidence for that proposition, of course.
a quick ‘back of a fag packet’ calculation suggests that to achieve an overall average of 35, the remaining 5 (of 10) adults had to have reached 70 years of age.
for example, when i was commenting on one of sbm’s great takedowns of acupuncture on my blog and went further on about it (acupuncture being something i can’t help railing against), it was only natural that ads for acupuncture showed up!
plonit – i believe you can also ask for certain ads to be restricted but it’s pretty time consuming.

# fifi on 19 feb 2010 at 12:57 pm dr tuteur – “that would not mean that the diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get heart disease and type ii diabetes.”
even marsden wagner, the who official who pushed through the recommendation acknowledges that there was never any evidence.
while the arguments that people promoting paleolithic diets make regarding evolution are rather silly, it’s just as silly to not consider how we evolved and what we naturally need for optimum health when looking at the best ways to stay healthy and happy.
otherwise they would be sent to live with someone who needed a small child to fetch wood and carry water.
i do not dispute, for one minute, that modern medicine has enabled modern americans to live longer and healthier lives.
zoe, i didn’t mean to paint the agricultural revolution as one event (i was describing all the agricultural revolutions and advancements that have occurred in human history).
she says people are getting heart disease and cancer only because modern medicine has given them so many additional years of life.
but i would add that while challenging cherished beliefs is all well and good and something that i’m in favor of, as an advocate of science i believe that such challenges should be backed up with the best available research.
one of the means a society can use to space births is a taboo against sex for lactating women which may be a two to four year period.
we’re still figuring out placebo effects (note the plural basically you’re spot on though – the actual substance isn’t causing the effect, the mind/brain or expectation of an effect is.
nor does it mean you’re not overly invested in maintaining a public image or protecting a brand in a way that creates a conflict of interest on an sbm site.
my diet is plenty varied and i find i really don’t miss the breads, cakes and chips–or the extra weight that came with them!
sorry about that and thanks for clarifying dr tuteur – “and for most people during most of human existence, preventing heart disease was irrelevant, since they died long before they could be afflicted with it.”
agriculture provides concentrated abundance, and therefore can support a larger population, but the grain-based diets of agriculture are not necessarily healthier.
i fasted twice per week while losing the weight and now i do it once per week, 18-30 hours, typically.
everyone’s ancestors diets were different.
diabetes (type ii), cancer and heart disease are predominantly diseases of old age.
i don’t see her as saying that the diet kills people.
i also disagree with the idea that because blogs are “different” (i.e. have a lower bar for accountability and accuracy?) that anything goes.
anyway, evolution may work to select genes that can survive, propagate and reproduce but for humans in the 21st century just generating greater numbers of humans is not going to be good enough.
from the medical viewpoint, this represents successful control of the diabetes without insulin or other glucose lowering medications.
on the other hand, amy is new to this lil’ corner of the blogosphere, so i expect her commentary to become more measured in the future.
if they don’t complete the task, they get flunked.
as a result all of those children (i believe about eight) were sent to live with various relatives, i don’t think any of the siblings ever lived together after that.
i’d also add contemporary accounts of the mongol invastions into chinese, muslim and european terroitories.
billy joe, i disagree that the appropriate use of qualifiers in science communication is merely a personal style choice.
if dr. tuteur had said something like that, she would have been challenged to prove it and accused of merely spouting a personal opinion, having a fundamentalist bias against technology, and not being science-based.
obviously dr. tuteur thinks the research is flawed in this area, and that’s fine.
we are very aware that the past was no garden of eden.
that said, it is interesting and kind of nice to see that “skeptic” as a brand or label is becoming marketable (though unfortunate that it’s often pseudoskepticism that’s being sold since most actual skeptics seem to view educating others about skepticism as more of a public service than a commercial endeavor).
showmedadata correctly points out that dr. tuteur paints with a broad brush, just like fundies do.
starting from her first blog, she’s been called out by medical researchers for misinterpreting data or research methodology and assigning nefarious intent to researchers she disagrees with (which is an attempt to manipulate using emotion).
but there are definitely advantages and lower infant mortality rates in agricultural socieities, as well as much higher birth rates (1 per year [ag] vs. 1 per 3-4
you don’t see people saying, “look at how long that peasant fishsmeller barnaby lived” because clearly he wasn’t recorded.
unfortunately dr tuteur seems to wantonly ignore whole fields of medical science and likes to make grand proclamations about fields of medicine that are outside of her specialty as an ob/gyn.
on another thread she taunted a jew-baiter and deliberately prolonged a discussion of whether judaism is inherited through the mother without actually bringing any insight to the thread.
i assume this is because of the nuance – the paper shows trends of increasing supermarket shopping *and* decreases in foot travel.
“modern” diseases will handle them and if not they will go the route of the panda bear (overweight, unable to reproduce with short to non-existent ovulation period, including “my head hurts” syndrome) it may take a few generations but its possible.
some attendings would even make invalid statements, to see who could come up with the best evidence to prove them wrong.

plant to animal subsistence ratios and macronutrient energy estimations in world wide hunter-gatherer diets.

because the archaeological record is replete with similar stories, as are historical accounts.
of the 17 easily found in the bio, 8 didn’t survive adolescence.
harriet, it is very true that dr. t consistently minimizes the importance of lifestyle.
most people eating organic food aren’t longing for a past that never existed, they simply worry about the effect of things like pesticides on their children or want to support more environmentally friendly production methods.
the most “successful” human beings in evolutionary terms are those that leave the most offspring, not those that live the longest.
how so? fifi, you are reading more into my words than i intended.
# showmedadata on 18 feb 2010 at 1:51 pm amy, i’ve been a reader of sbm for half a year or so and enjoy your articles.
if she had income she could buy snacks for her children and they would eat twice a day.
calli arcale: “like most species, we cope with our premature death rate by having enough babies to make up the difference, but it’s probably fair to say our wild life expectancy was in the order of 70 years, barring illness or accident or famine.
it seems to me that the life expectancy of a 50 year old white male is now much better than the average age at death (77.1) of these first 30.
now, none of this actualy validates a paleolithic diet but it does reveal that evolution is not meaningless when it comes to nutrition and health.
# rnikoley on 19 feb 2010 at 3:33 pm one of the strawmen often used against a “paleo” or “stone age” diet / lifestyle is that it’s living a fantasy.
otherwise they would be sent to live with someone who needed a small child to fetch wood and carry water.
in my city most italian immigrant families still grow a great deal of their own fresh fruit and vegetables in their back yard.
evidence that our bodies adapted to make the most of that diet would be evidence that doing well on that diet conferred an evolutionary advantage — made individuals more genetically fit — otherwise there would be no adaptation.
i’m new to the science based medicine site.
but it will be interesting to see where the lines of evidence end up pointing, either way.
burned herself with boiling water while breathing steam to treat a sinus infection.
(these three above are all short term studies, alas, but all of them note lowered triglycerides, increased insulin sensitivity, and other improvements in measures of health from even a short term stint on a h-g type diet.)
dr tuteur’s apparent prejudice against preventative medicine – and cognitive science and psychology – isn’t very surprising when you see how it’s connected to her belief system regarding actions and consequences.
i think it’s as dangerous to romanticize the present as it is to romanticize the past.
that would be the farmers.
it is not enough to cite papers and books that you think make your point.
my sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_invasive_and_interventional_cardiology http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coronary_artery_disease#risk_factors “while it’s true that modern medicine has improved life expectancy, particularly for infants and children, the idea that agriculture is an unequivicol good from a medical standpoint simply lacks support.
i would not take from this evidence that religious revivals improve life expectancies.
dr hall, it’s interesting that you’re an advocate for lomborg’s political/ideological position even though he’s been called out by climate scientists as promoting bad science (either willingly or purely by virtual of ignorance).
my understanding is that in hunter-gatherer societies it is more typical to have a baby every four years.
if this is what happened, that suggests that a not-insignificant proportion of the population got old,and that old people were genetically fit — that is, that they contributed to the survival of their relatives and the reproduction of their genes.
all else being equal, stunted growth is typically symptomatic of malnourishment.
technology is undoubtedly part of the solution but so is simply stopping doing some really stupid things for short term profit or because we’re energy gluttons.
in my field (education) this is certainly true, and i find it hard to believe that medicine/diet is a lot different.
dr. tuteur is certainly unique among the bloggers on sbm.
you don’t need to demonstrate that the past was hell and nature is a bitch in order to demonstrate the illogic of the natural fallacy and the traditional fallacy.
fundamentalists really require that infallible source text for them to reinterpret strictly.
i’d assume that there would be remarriage and the stepmothers would take care of the younger children as well as any children she had.
i really do appreciate the sbm bloggers here who clearly love science for what it is and want to communicate just how cool it is to the general public.
this is actually a testable hypothesis, so someone with anthropological savvy (not me) can probably go and look up the data.
if this wasn’t possible, they might be adopted by a childless aunt.
also – if you look at individual diseases – cancer survival is increasing, heart attack survival is increasing, stroke survival is increasing, etc.
this was good writing both in the sense of being accurate and in the sense of being clear and easy to assimilate.
and finally, you can check out a very good review article here: loren cordain, s. boyd eaton, anthony sebastian, neil mann, staffan lindeberg, bruce a. watkins, james h. o’keefe, janette brand miller.
particularly since dr tuteur just made an excuse for doing it and tried to brush it under the carpet by once again claiming that she’s being victimized simply because someone pointed out that she’s engaging in unethical behavior that certainly isn’t in line with what one would expect from someone who claims to be an advocate of sbm!
fifi, speaking of sbm bloggers “however, none of them stand to profit from writing their blogs (or commenting here).”
everyone feel free to do their part for future generations (where do you hear _that_ all the time?).
if a mother didn’t have her own income, her children breakfasted on leftovers from supper — and that was it until they were old enough to stay up and eat supper with the grownups and get two meals a day.
growth arrest episodes at indian knoll were periodic and more often of short duration and were possibly due to food shortage in late winter; those at hardin village occurred randomly and were more often of long duration, probably indicative of disease as a causative agent.
i must say how much dr. t’s calling out of zoe, plonit and others stuck me as more appropriate to the wwf than sbm.
— more dependence on local crops, so a boom-and-bust cycle of feast and famine.
furthermore, there’s haziness in your assertion that “for most of human existence” the life expectancy was 35 years..
i would hypothesize that because werner’s patients suffer from type ii diabetes and ischemic heart disease that they would benefit from the diets used in the lindeberg and jonsson studies i cite above.
my impression is that non-reproductive grandmothers are a prominent feature of the hunter-gatherer societies we know today.
the effect of the “inactive” ingredients is unknown and could be truely neutral and therefore unnecessary, or have presently unknown adverse effects.
most of critical thinking entails being able to get beyond either/or kind of thinking, which is one of the most basic cognitive traps there is (it has nothing to do with intelligence, it’s just the way our brain is set up for expediency, so even intelligent people can fall into this trap).
it is axiomatic in “alternative” health that the human body represents evolutionary perfection and that if we only hark back to nature we will be healthier.
part of science education is teaching the critical approach to information and conclusion.
since a popular and very successful tactic of purveyors of anti-medicine woo and pseudoscience is to try to make out that sbm isn’t trustworthy and is merely a front for industry or is financially self-serving, it seems crucially important that sbm bloggers actually be pretty spotlessly ethical and not blatantly engaged in the same kinds of mercenary activities as the more nefarious woo merchants.
now, to get back to my moose liver fried in coconut oil.
resistant to starvation on that diet.
the absence of a gatekeeper means that this category can contain a whole heaping pile of utter nonsense.
i will still use romanticized reasons for riding my motorcycle.
but it will be interesting to see where the lines of evidence end up pointing, either way.
climate science is complicated and we certainly don’t know everything (this is also true of medical science) – that’s why reliable experts are so important and discussions need to be based on good science (meaning in reality!).
you make 100% of your income by practicing midwifery.
in growing up, by russell baker, starting on p. 50 he has a few very informative pages about life and death in backwoods america in the 1920s before scientific medicine reached there.
copy and pasting a link, which might impress lay people, carries no weight here.
since you’re hostile and dismissive of preventative medicine and non-surgical and non-pharmacological treatments, and are uncritically pro-industry, you present as a real life version of the cartoon pro-industry pseudoskeptic/pseudoscientist that cam advocates and healthfreedomusa types claim scientists and doctors are.
however, as far as i can tell, the incidence among the elderly in populations who eat a modern, western diet ismuch higher than those that don’t.
i think both styles are fine, you just have to recognise each for what it is.
true, they aren’t the same, but if anthropologists are going to look at human life spans throughout history, looking at (fast disappearing) modern day hunter-gatherers is the next best thing, given the relative paucity of data about people from 200,000 years ago.
you are defending the paleo diet because you have a personal stake in the argument.
in the 70s and 80s, which found zero cases of type ii diabetes among those inuit who still ate the traditional diet.
this despite the fact that i’ve cited quite a bit of peer-reviewed research indicating that populations subsisting on h-g diets had life expectancies that many agricultural societies could not match until the 19th and 20th centuries.
agriculture is a lot of work, and food preparation is a lot of work, and there just isn’t the availability to provide children with food all through the day.
some of them will develop overt diabetes (requiring glucose lowering medication) within five years, even if they stick to the diet.
life expectancies for both sexes at all ages were lower at hardin village than at indian knoll.
if you want to talk about demeaning other women, maybe you should retract your blog entries where you characterize women who don’t birth in hospitals, choose non-pharmacological pain relief, and are pro-breastfeeding as “uneducated”, “egocentric” “sanctimommies”, “stunt-birthers” etc.
(my grandfather’s black bag contains, among other things, a standardized digitalis preparation: that is, a herbal preparation that a pharmaceutical company standardized to a certain strength.)
@bluedevilra the theory put forth by alex and others seems to be that h-g’s were more fit to survive because they lived long and healthy lives.
i suffered a bad case of mononucleosis when i was six years old, bad enough to put me on iv for several days.
if so, the evidence of all those deaths caused by the inability of farmers to feed everyone, is very good evidence that what replaced the old method saved, prolonged and improved a great many human lives.
the libel is around the “promotes bogus treatments” since it implies that the bca is being intentionally unethical (i have no doubt they are but we’re talking british libel laws here).
he seems like a rogue “environmentalist” whose only training is in political science, and has been brought to trial for charges of plagiarism, fabrication of data, deliberate misinterpretation, etc etc etc.
(but then big pharma is creepy and dangerous too.
i agree it’s preferable for someone to see an md, psychologist or psychiatrist for a wide variety of reasons – the main one being so that they learn how their own mind works and find healthier ways to get this kind of support and empathy.
“anyone familiar with contemporary medical literature at the turn of the 20th century also knows that native african and asian populations suffered very little from diseases such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and cavities, but saw rapid increases in all of these diseases upon the adoption of the western “industrial agricultural” diet.”
it didn’t matter that the ancestors of the first meat eaters didn’t eat meat.
my hunch is that hunter-gatherers, agrarians, pastoralists, and civilizationists are all basically equally “healthy”.
it is not being fanatical or fundamentalist to say that modern americans tend to be very unhealthy and dependent on medical treatments.
we can survive almost anywhere, on a wide variety of diets.
amy, alex knapp (not one of the 5) had the virtue of at least being honest about his motivations.
we can move forward in some areas, but not in others.
when i lived in africa, children who could not live with their mother (mother died, or mother remarried and new husband was not interested in supporting another man’s child) were sent to live with their maternal grandmother.
we are fortunate that through the advances of science and agricultural techniques that this can mean different things for different people.
in fact, doctors with attitudes such as the one you repeatedly show here have increasingly made basic preventative medicine the realm of alternative medicine.
so, you’re healthy *if you live to be*, and while i think it’s exaggerating to say few people lived to menopause in the past, it’s also unfair to ignore that a lot of people alive today would be dead if they’d been living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
if one is going to talk about history and culture, it’s worth knowing a bit about history and culture instead of just promoting what is essentially anthropological woo!
besides for smallpox to live up to its reputation as the speckled monster, we’d need to return the squalorous conditions plaguing the people of the 17 and 1800s.
natural selection does not select for health, it selects for reproductive outcomes.
i think that one of the main reasons that the past is romanticized by so many in the general public is because in addition to having no education in science, they also lack any in history and they seem to do very little reading.
if the diet is the same, people who are healthy when they eat it are more genetically fit than people who are not healthy when they eat it.
animal attacks (immediate death or wounds that cause a slow death), animal bites (infections) would also be an issue.
they just have the maturity to draw a line in the sand regarding how many they are actually going to read.
my favorite was the guy who collected images of the virgin mary on food products and had made a name for himself by debunking bogus science claims.
in my opinion, when jref allowed google ads, which predictably featured all sorts of scam products, they sold out.
i have even seen some explanations of benefit of a homeopathic treatment based on quantum mechanical principles.
there is some research to suggest that exercise has very little effect on obesity or diabetes rates, but from this computer i don’t have the citations handy.
my father: treated with antibiotics for paratyphoid fever caught in bangladesh.
it additionally becomes enormously absurd because all of the things that various charlatans and cam foodies say are necessary for health would have been exclusive to a particular region and particularly impossible for any one group or individual to acquire anyway.
# alison cummins on 18 feb 2010 at 1:55 pm karl: stunted growth: it doesn’t take a lot of food restriction to stunt growth.

this reminds me of a presentation i attended by a dermatology resident who was into all natural treatments (not sure how she got into derm).
it’s because they barely had enough to eat and sometimes starved.
the end result is that she very often resembles the very ideologues and promoters of pseudoscience that she’s berating!)
the style is unnecessarily jeering in tone and too simplistic for a rationalist forum.
crikey jbm, i now have an image of sir lancelot spratt of st. swithin’s “as far as the discussion of dr tuteur’s style, i think most medical doctors would recognize the style as a provocative style of teaching used by attending physicians and residents to get medical students to think for themselves.
the hunter gatherer culture has been a dismal failure compared to the farming culture.
one sociological study of an agricultural village looked at all kinds of variables upside down and sideways — family size, father’s family size, mother’s family size, size of land available to family, distribution of land, quality of land — to find variables that would identify children at risk of malnutrition.
consider that while presidents adams and jefferson lived to an advanced age, william henry harrison died of pneumonia only 10 days after his inauguration.
the advantage of survivorship curves and life tables is the demonstration of mortality as a function of age.
my mother: started bleeding in 7th month of pregnancy.
to be clear, i don’t think there is anything wrong with having an ideology as long as you can, one, be honest about it, and two, attempt to falsify it.
no, lomberg certainly isn’t a agw denier.
# alex knapp on 18 feb 2010 at 11:36 am amy, the best measure of evolutionary success is population growth, and by that measure, agriculture was an extraordinary triumph.

(though perhaps not giving out the info and mentioning notoriety is a clever bait and switch type of scheme to get us all out there trying to solve the puzzle…mouhahaha.)
back in my university days i had a professor who used to talk about that phenomenon being quite visible in newfoundland, where sex differences in height in the older generation were less pronounced than in the younger generation.
— enables longevity as high levels of iron lead to oxidative damage (one reason women live longer than men).
ruth scurr in her book “fatal purity” has written about the ideals of the french revolution, which were inspired considerably by the philosophy of proverbial romantic jj rousseau and how these ideals could lead to a reign of terror.
i think that, given the available evidence, it’s more reasonable to assume that advances in health are almost solely due to modern medicine and not the industrial methods of farming.
“normal birth is not a medical problem, but it can turn into a life-threatening medical problem with no advance warning.
to my knowledge, dr. tuteur has never “refused to even consider that our modern lifestyle may have some drawbacks.”
i also will not have the heart valve complications that survivors of untreated scarlet fever often developed later in life.
plonit – to be fair, most site owners have little control over which google ads appear on the site.
i think i was exposed to fairly harsh methods (there was significant morbidity and mortality in my cohort of medical students), more modern teaching programs may have evolved beyond that.
in “cool it,”lomborg calls for cooling the earth but also cooling the emotional heat of the debate about what actions to take.
moreover, the critical driver of evolution, natural selection, does not favor perfection or even health; it favors reproductive success and it tolerates a massive amount of wastage.
now, if you really are a descendant of a hunter-gatherer society that had a fully-formed agricultural system thrust on them suddenly and less than 500 years ago, you should absolutely try out a paleolithic diet.
# bluedevilra on 18 feb 2010 at 2:02 pm i suspect people romanticize our h-g ancestors because they fancy the idea that if we had to return to those uncivilized times, then they would be the one’s who survive.
this doesnt’ cover what happens when a father dies, in the case of one of my grandfathers when his father died his older sister married at the age of 14 and he and his younger sister were sent to “schools” because their mother had no money and no desire to try and care for them.
i instituted that method to cut down on the hundreds of personal e-mails i otherwise get each day, and it has been very effective.
people who actively, deliberately, biologically reproduce themselves, creating new human beings to consume resources on the planet, and then claim to be saving the world by using cloth diapers.
modern chimpanzees hunt, and 2.5 million years ago early hominids were using stone tools to cut the flesh off the bones of large animals (presumably scavenged).
as some of the other comments mentioned, it makes no more sense to romanticize the past as it does the present.
the woo alarm in my head is ringing so loud i can barely hear myself think.
i know it is easy to for all of us to label many of those who practice alternative medicine as quacks, cranks, irrational buffoons, or–as dr. tuteur does in her article–”fundamentalist” but to do so targets are energy on the people and not their ideas.
it’s a bit like dr tuteur thinks nature is the enemy when everything is part of the natural world, including the tools and technologies that humans create (be they health supporting or destructive to human health and happiness).
(van der waal has some interesting insights from a group of chimps where the most aggressive males were killed in an accident, leaving the “beta males” behind to reproduce.
but i do think it takes a lot more attention from skeptics then it needs to, or is healthy, and i worry about the environment that it creates for us.
it does have much value with out certainty in something else.
writing about chiropractic and back pain would have to choose between being accurate and being easy to digest.
in the medical school situation, if a student presented legitimate reference citations at odds with the professor’s teachings how did the professor react?
if evolution selected paleolithic people for lower rates of heart disease, that suggests that enough of them were living long enough that heart disease mattered.
from my perspective, it would be nice if humans finally just got over the fantasies and started to figure out how to live on the planet as human animals.
it also seems just as fear based as the beliefs of those who cling to naturalist fallacies, it’s just that dr tuteur seems to think that technology is infallible and the “all good” magic to ward off scary nature instead of believing the naturalist fallacy that one can appease nature by being “good” or “in harmony”.
http://shm.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/1/1/1 # amy tuteur, md on 18 feb 2010 at 1:19 pm “i think it would be more accurate to say that all the existing scientific evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that no cam treatment works better than placebo, except for some herbal remedies which would probably work even better if they were approached by the time-tested methods of pharmacology with isolation and purification of the active ingredient.”
certainly, in the historic nature vs. science/technology debate, people couldn’t stand being compared to animals, and there are certainly some religious undertones there.
i’d highly recommend you read the cassidy article i cite above, which compared the archaeological evidence of two groups of native americans in the same region, of which one was a hunter-gatherer society (referred to as “indian knoll”) and the other was agricultural (referred to as “hardin village”).
the national academy of scienes series dr. novella posted about a few weeks ago on evolution has some really cool articles on aging and disease.
hunter-gatherer children don’t eat porrige, so they often can’t be weaned as young as agricultural children.
still, people who lived to adulthood did not make it to their 70s and 80s at anywhere near the rate that they do now.
i apologize for the misunderstanding.
but that doesn’t mean the reason that i have lived longer than most people born 50,000 years ago is that i eat bread and they ate meat and roots.
i’m also assuming that the father would marry a younger woman.
thus, agricultural societies were able to overcome h-g tribes by virtue of superior weaponry and higher populations.
he is clearly evidence- and science-based, although he has made mistakes about what the evidence shows.
however, i find your posts annoying to read because of the reasons marco outlined above and because you’re a sloppy, sensationalist writer and entirely unreflective about your own biases and clearly have a lot of self worth and ego tied up in this image of yourself as a provocateur and “challenger”.
from my personal research to date, i think that the evidence demonstrates that we ought to (a) keep modern medicine, because it’s awesome and (b) emulate to the best of our abilities the traditional diet of hunter-gatherer societies using the tools of modern food production.
in all fairness, i note that life expectancy was significantly higher in the countryside, at least as far as the data we have suggest.
people who survived childhood in pre-modern times were likely to get old, and they were not likely to get heart disease or cancer.
alex knapp: “the archaeological evidence suggests, for example, an almost uniform crash in average heights when populations make the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture (in crete, for example, average heights for men went from 5′9″ pre-agriculture to 5′3″ afterwards).”
but to extrapolate incredible fortune or genetics to the extent that all medicine is futile is incredibly shortsighted and selfish.
once again, what i take issue with is your so far unproved assumption that modern diets create better health.
“there’s plenty of revenue from carrying googleads for sites like this ->http://www.ourpregnancymiracle.com” hmm.
@david the vast majority due to childhood infectious diseases, diseases, i note, that have now been largely brought under control by vaccines, antibiotics, and advances in medical care.
# lillym on 19 feb 2010 at 2:11 pm @alison – you’re misrepresenting what dr. tuteur said, either that or you stopped reading after the sentence you quoted becuase she also said: so the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease and type ii diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything else.
the cube-farm dwellers suffer health effects from lack of exercise, so they use their agriculture-and-fossil-fuel-enabled technology to build themselves gyms and take sulfonylurea drugs.
it is important to learn that different scientific approaches yield different degrees of quality of information that can be used to make a medical decision.
there is no evidence that the paleolithic diet was the “best” diet; it was the only diet.
however, as far as i can determine, this is not true as far as the consumption of cereal grains go.
in the article he said “not a jot of evidence” elsewhere he has actually evaluated the evidence that chiropractic helps asthma and other non spinal conditions.
that gw predictions may be overly alarming.
dr tuteur seems to have a prejudice against non-pharmaceutical or surgical treatments and, for some strange reason exercise and a healthy diet.
the burdens of disease by j. n. hays p 279 “government compulsion did not…mean effective administration, and the rapid elimination of smallpox certainly did not result.”
but alison is trying to claim that dr. teteur said that “nobody” lived to old age.
alison cummins: “c) a plausible hypothesis would be that evolution preferentially selected for paleolithic humans who had lower rates of heart disease when eating the diet available to them.”
“my understanding is that her role is to increase traffic at sbm.”
marco – great post (though i’ll admit to a confirmation bias since i’m a big fan of the carl sagans, ramachandrans and sacks who are both great scientitsts and great communicators…writers who clearly care much more deeply about people and communication, as well as what they write about, than about their own egos).
# karl withakay on 18 feb 2010 at 1:00 pm bluedevilra makes a good point as well: “the problem is, most people don’t even realize when they receive treatment for life threatening diseases.”
i also find it frustrating that she is furthering the myth that conventional medicine does not emphasize diet and exercise, and making it (unintentionally) the domain of “alternative medicine.”
i’m sorry, but that does not show that her statement isn’t true.
alternative health as a form of fundamentalism also makes sense in that it has an almost religious fervor.
antibiotics cured it, but historically scarlet fever had a 15-20% mortality rate before antibiotics.
this may be a bit of an argument from ignorance, but i don’t know how we can repeatably and reliably define the relative quality of sitting around a campfire listening to the tribal elders sing songs and tell stories versus reading a book by candlelight or entertaining (?!)
kind of odd at sbm since other doctors who use their credentials or professional authority to sell opinions, woo/ideologies or products/books are regularly taken to task here (and rightly so).
because the archaeological record is replete with similar stories, as are historical accounts.
in fact, when life is hard, the new young wife is often not at all keen on looking after another woman’s children.
i’m hypothesizing that, based on the available evidence, prior to the advent of medicine and sanitation, a hunter-gatherer lifestyle appears to produce more robust health outcomes than an agricultural one.
no, seriously, you seem to have managed to divide the two in an ethical and honest way – unless it’s big pharma or big scam paying you to blog or some such and then it would be relevant because of the potential influence on what you publish here.
given amy’s stance at sbm on toxins i would expect to see her advising parents not to waste their money on the more expensive chlorine free diapers and organic baby food because there is no “evidence” that diapers bleached with chlorine and food grown with chemical fertilizers and pesticides pose any harm to babies.
modern agriculture — and especially modern agricultural policy — makes food available cheaply, but the cheap stuff is mostly bad food.
hunter-gatherer children don’t eat porrige, so they often can’t be weaned as young as agricultural children.
since you keep making the same claims to be being victimized and projecting motivations onto commenters here over and over again as if doing so makes it true, clearly you don’t actually have a problem with that kind of thing when you’re doing it yourself!
she had surgery and underwent chemo and just had a clean bill of health at her 6 month check-up.
lillym, in her original post, amy states that for most of human existence the average human life expectancy was 35 years.
i love when people try to use “look at all the notable people that lived to…” that is specious on several levels, because the notable people typically had more resources at their disposal.
# plonit on 18 feb 2010 at 2:28 pm more children per mother, leading to earlier weaning of infants and more competition for food among children.
lizkat, “i exercise every day and it requires discipline and planning.”
i only have a second, and i have only read one of his books, but he agrees that agw may exist, but that it’s really not that big of a deal, in comparison with other problems we face (that he also attempts to diminish however).
influence of motorization and supermarket-proliferation on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the inhabitants of a small town on okinawa, japan, internal medicine vol. 46 (2007) , no. 23 pp.1899-1904).
i said that it wasn’t unequivicallygood.
— enables longevity as high levels of iron lead to oxidative damage (one reason women live longer than men).
moderns eating their 6 tupperware meals a day outta try it someday.
that would mean that the paleolithic diet was good for preventing heart disease and type ii diabetes.
of course, now that i know that ask dr amy is a commercial site and dr tuteur is selling herself/her identity as a brand, it makes many of her tactics here make more sense than they first did to me.
we will need to find a way to provide greater quality of life for a greater fraction of the overall population (mere fairness) under long term stable conditions (environmental concerns).
just because someone is an sbm blogger and claims to be a skeptic doesn’t mean they actually are one.
i don’t think anyone is suggesting those diseases are “merely” diseases of old age, but they do clearly increase in incidence with age.
a successful “paleo diet,” i think, would be predicated on what it eliminates.
what a disappointing post in what is overall a wonderful site.
, i’d like to point out that i’m pretty sure you can find very reliable statistics about the number of deaths caused by these diseases in the not so distant past.
i sincerely trust that dr. tuteur doesn’t actually believe that argument, but they way she structured her comments it is definitely reasonable to walk-in with that understanding.
“c) a plausible hypothesis would be that evolution preferentially selected for paleolithic humans who had lower rates of heart disease when eating the diet available to them.”
clearly some people in the past in all kinds of societies and cultures enjoyed their lives very much, there are all kinds of records that show this to be true.
not weaning them delays mothers’ return to ovulation, absolutely.
only when they get steamed up will they really learn what critical thinking entails.
ask dr. amy doesn’t need to make money from answering email questions, there’s plenty of revenue from carrying googleads for sites like this ->http://www.ourpregnancymiracle.com
the idea that all life in nature is short and brutish seems to be as much a product of colonial mentality as the notion of the noble savage is – neither seem particularly accurate and both seem to look at nature from a rather misinformed and antiquated perspective that’s really not very scientific (at least in contemporary terms).
infant mortality was higher at hardin village.
indeed, some diseases can be completely prevented by vaccination.
consider that type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity.
but their health tendencies will naturally be different from ours (meaning descendants of farmers, like myself) since they evolved in a different habitat with a different diet, different ecological pressures, and different founding genes to begin with.
perhaps my impressions have been wrong for the past year and i should just realize that a blog is a blog is a blog…..hence my decision to view this site as an entertainment venue.
i can’t imagine how a pre-technological society could grow substantially in population without an increase in lifespan.
if you want to deny that, then you will have to show an effect of the drug above placebo.”
if they had lived long, happy and healthy lives their population would have grown.
now, i do disagree with dr. hall somewhat on circ, but my personal blogging preference is respectful, honest disagreement and balance.
among elderly kitavans, incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia are incredibly low.
infant mortality was higher at hardin village.
not only that, it makes the moderate promoters of alternative medicine seem quite sane and realistic in comparison and their claims that sbm is simply about uncritically promoting industry over public health true.
the students also rarely knew my personal position on a topic- i wanted them to draw their own conclusions, backed by evidence, which is the entire point behind education.
that would eliminate manifestations of the disease, but not alter the pathway.
natural selection isn’t the only factor.
it’s long been known that parental age is associated with the rate of birth defects; as the parents get older, so goes the idea, their gamete-production-systems accumulate genetic defects, some of which will be fatal to the offspring.
i personally remember the polio epidemics.
# sid offit on 18 feb 2010 at 3:13 pm amy, you lack imagination.
# galadriel on 18 feb 2010 at 10:30 am something i find as an interesting snapshot of the state of health pre-modern medicine is to open up wikipedia to a page on someone i find interesting…then to look at what we know of that person’s family.
moreover, it is predicated on the unquestioned assumption that the amount of food available was adequate.
the problem is that his “science” is faulty, used to promote an idealogical agenda, and he romanticizes the present.
if however you have another infectious disease eliminated by modern medicine i’d love to hear about it.
it would just mean that those people would probably be happier if they dialled back the fibre and made an effort to include more butter in their diets.
i have never been paid for public speaking, either, except for receiving a small honorarium for being on the faculty of the skeptic’s toolbox last summer.
those populations were then able to drive out h-gs from their native territories because they had larger armies, even though h-gs were generally taller and stronger.
so, you’re healthy *if you live to be*, and while i think it’s exaggerating to say few people lived to menopause in the past, it’s also unfair to ignore that a lot of people alive today would be dead if they’d been living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
however, you’re not a personal threat in any way and basically serve as a distraction (in the same way pec used to here when she used to comment, you remind me of a reverse version of her in many ways).
i think it’s as dangerous to romanticize the present as it is to romanticize the past.
children are helpless for the first decade of life, so the survival of genes is dependent on there being a large support network to ensure the survival of children, even if their parents die.
only someone who has examined you and reviewed your medical records can provide advice.
through some medical interventions, we might push the patient to an earlier point in the pathway.
imo, even that pleasure should account for something that even the prehistoric derm should recognize as valuable.
when i come to sbm, i’m used to seeing citation to peer-reviewed research and analysis.
i certainly do care about whether claims are based on scientific evidence.
it is not enough to cite papers and books that you think make your point.
catholics who believe that good works on earth are part of the path toward salvation are condemned to hell because the fundie maintains that faith alone garners entry through the pearly gates.
but the modern lifestyle is definitely a big factor.
using average lifespan as the measure of a society’s health is wrong.
considering that the evidence seems to be pointing to viruses playing a key role in many cancers (as well as lifestyle choices, like smoking, in some), your claims that cancer is a result of aging aren’t actually very scientific.
you know the one: “what have the roman’s ever done for us” as long as you take out all the people who died early, people in the 1900s lived just as long as we do today.
relying on the meager evidence of the distant past to guide our actions is a fruitless exercise that is overly romanticized; the “spirit” of the post.
it may not have generated much controversy or debate but that’s because it was so well written, humble and non-sensationalist – even though it was dealing with a potentially controversial topic – there was no bullsh*t to call him out on and no sloppy language and vagueness about meaning.
but in reproductive terms, age 40 is old age.
historically speaking, the best way to examine the effects of the paleolithic diet are to look at modern human hunter-gatherers and their health.
apart from not being nearly as successful, i can’t see how this is particularly different than what the dr phils and mercolas and other tv/internet medical charlatans are doing.
the other problem even intelligent people often have is a lack of ability to deconstruct and recognize our own personal biases and the biases of our own culture.
according to the “fiber hypothesis,” fecaliths develop more readily in people who consume a diet deficient in fiber, because their stools are more tenacious.
it is a mistake in logic to assume that “progress” is some unilateral arrow, and that as some progress is made, all aspects of the culture progress at the same time.
a lot of pseudoscience and pseudoskepticism does this – that’s the ritual or cargo cult aspect of it, how it presents as being scientific or rational but doesn’t actually conform to scientific or skeptical processes or results (it does things like cherry pick evidence, misrepresent the actual science, be unreasonably skeptical in the face of reasonable evidence, etc).
we weren’t very good at identifying cancer before the development of modern medicine.
i am really really suprised that many can’t see how she overly simplifies complicated medical and science topics.”
my ancestors were celtic and scandinavian; they had a diet based on milk, domesticated cattle, fish, and farming and it’s stupid to think they stopped evolving to their diet as soon as they got cows.
i disagree and think this is an example of the problem of using sbm as opposed to ebm to evaluate health interventions.
i know you aren’t saying that harriet hall does not tell the truth.
we are very aware that the past was no garden of eden.
i think i would have to offer as a counterpoint to your evidence the ample studies indicating that the incidence of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are very low among population groups that follow a traditional h-g diet compared to similar populations that consume a modern, western diet.
it seems to me that the life expectancy of a 50 year old white male is now much better than the average age at death (77.1) of these first 30.
harriet, it is very true that dr. t consistently minimizes the importance of lifestyle.
i can simply not adopt a religion at all and accept reality for what it is.
as is the increasing evidence that a sparkling clean home and no exposure to dirt and germs isn’t very good for priming a kid’s immune system.
and also perhaps that chlorine residue on diapers is toxic to infants.
amy says: so the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease and type ii diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything else.
these papers study both diabetics and healthy, modern people, and show health improvements from following a paleolithic style diet.
the whole family almost died during the dakota winter when the trains stopped running.
evolution is the result of reproductive success of individuals fittest for the particular environment in which they live.
i have not worded my previous comment accurately enough; i don’t mean to say that “mommy instinct” equals national-socialism, but that it is part of the way of thinking that consistently overvalues “natural” vs “scientific”.
not without a study that compared groups of people with access to modern medicine, but with one living on a traditional diet and the other on a diet of food produced by “industrial farming methods.”
you’re right that it probably didn’t happen very often.
so there’s no reason to conclude that they would be good for us.
determination of scientific validity of our answer would ideally be done by an empirical method in a reproducible controlled experiment.
also – if you look at individual diseases – cancer survival is increasing, heart attack survival is increasing, stroke survival is increasing, etc.
the difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods (including pesticides).
i am doubtful that this happened very often even in ancient hunter-gatherer societies, especially given the paleontological evidence even in homo erectus of taking care of seriously disabled tribe/clan members, and, more notably, the fact that it isn’t common in modern hunter-gatherer societies (what few still exist).
it is not romanticizing to admit that we have some problems now, or that some things were better in some previous societies.
at one point in his life, he refused to sign a statement that condemn the influence of astrology on astronomers because he thought the tone of the statement was too harsh and condensing.

@alison – you’re misrepresenting what dr. tuteur said, either that or you stopped reading after the sentence you quoted becuase she also said: so the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease and type ii diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything else.
and, secondly, amy readily agreed with my rather long summary of the scientific view of herbal treatment which, as far as i can tell, is just an expansion of harriet’s summary.
in my opinion good scientists is passionate about what they know, and ecstatic about what they don’t know.
we can apply the model to the observed evidence to see how well it fits.
i have never been paid anything by big pharma and i have not even been in the same room with a drug rep in the last three decades.
i’ve also read that evolution can also happen very fast.
now, i have no desire to hop into a time machine to live in the past and i appreciate how far medicine and scientific knowledge have advanced even in my own lifetime but to assume that all throughout history before now that life was “hell” is just ridiculous!
one of the strawmen often used against a “paleo” or “stone age” diet / lifestyle is that it’s living a fantasy.
for example her statement that people living in the modern world “still prey to the same illnesses and accidents, but now they can be effectively treated” just isn’t true.
or, hunter-gatherers moved around and didn’t have to worry much about sewage.
apparently there are people who believe that back in the day, ancient man lived a long, strong, and healthy life up to the minute he just dropped dead of old age one day in the middle of running around hunting and gathering nuts.
sensationalism, being overly simplistic, relying upon “common sense” over actual evidence, making assertions with no context or recontextualising something so it appears other than it is and making broad generalizations are all the trademarks of tabloid journalism and woo.
yet without the western diet, many wouldn’t need medical interventions to survive.
of course, they also suffered from other things which could affect their skin, such as, in some cases malnutrition or just very poor diets.
my sister was taken into care by the children’s aid because it was feared that her stepmother would kill her and her older sister.
now, combine knowledge of this diet with modern medicine and place it in a modern context, and it appears we have an extraordinary way to improve health.
despite this, incidence of obesity is much less common than among similar population groups eating a modern western diet.
maybe you are confusing biodynamic, which is about ancient magical stuff, with organic.
also, i’m not sure that lifespan alone is the only valid indicator of where we’re at as a society.
however, that judgment of the quality of the source is an easy way for biases to enter the process.
full disclosure: sbm bloggers are not paid.
which could be for any number of reasons: drought, too much rain, too hot, too cold, frost came too early, frost came to late (depending on the climate of where they lived), bad storms damaged fruit as it came ripe, storms damaged plants before they could bear fruit.
as usual, this post is as overly simplistic as the “all nature is pure” folks’ viewpoint.
however, life expectancy at age 50 is 75–which the u.s. did not match until 1980– and a signficant portion of the population reaches that age.
also: — more staying at home, better housing, cleared land and fewer (not more) predators.
i didn’t go into his books with any conscious bias, but i’m willing to admit that my reading comprehension could be unconsciously impaired by a tendency to optimism and a distrust of alarmism.
once again, what i take issue with is your so far unproved assumption that modern diets create better health.
i also nursed two babies at once, and it still didn’t make a difference.
for my part, if you weren’t blogging at sbm more frequently than any other blogger here, i’d ignore you as another crank on the internet who’s simply being sensationalist and attention seeking, and abusing science to prop up their own ego and personal identity.
the main problem with rah-rah and romantic attitudes to industrial science – be it pharmaceuticals, factory farming and pesticides or technology – is that it generally takes time for us to actually understand what the impact upon human biology and the environment is from these new technologies.
alex, i love sashimi myself too but didn’t those okinawans eat rice also?
i am not arguing that diet, exercise, and behavior are not factors in developing diseases we associate with aging, i am just arguing that the aging process based on accumulating errors in our dna that occur when our dna repair mechanisms shut down after reproductive years, is a bigger factor than we have realized.
agriculture provides concentrated abundance, and therefore can support a larger population, but the grain-based diets of agriculture are not necessarily healthier.
not to mention using an agricultural caused disease (smallpox/ cowpox) to prove one’s point that modern agriculuture with pesticides is the main reason (in addition to modern medicine) for increasing human life expectancy.

the differences in tooth wear and caries rate are very likely attributable to dietary differences between the two groups.
of course, considering that we’re in the post-modern era, the “modernists” are actually simply nostalgic for the past and certain traditional “modern” beliefs and cultural modes from a simpler time where they felt more comfortable.
kung and masai compared to their agricultural neighbors is eye-opening.
the incidence of type ii diabetes among the elderly in modern hunter-gatherer populations is virtually non-existent.
the objective facts are that cam is useless except for [add a large paragraph of qualifiers which add much to the statement that "cam is useless"].

the age at which the disease becomes manifest depends on the pathway, and how fast they proceed down the pathway.
the incidence of type ii diabetes was also low among the islanders of okinawa, the population with the longest life expectancy in the world, until the past decade, when substantial numbers of people there began adopting an american-style diet–resulting in almostdoubling the incidence in a 13-year span of time.
he advocates a cool-headed scientific approach instead of rushing prematurely into the most radical, expensive procedures based on panic and emotion a la al gore (whose movie also contained a lot of errors).
what it indicates is that the actual drug may not work in the way anticipated and be no better than a placebo.”
(and i did like dr. hall’s article on it, but that confirmation bias is very powerful!) points out the disadvantages of organic farming, the big corporate organic farms, and the fact that organic does use potentially dangerous pesticides, just not synthetic ones.

this may be partly because a certain percentage of humans have always been weak and vulnerable to disease, because that’s life.
as a research grant competitor, you understand that funds are limited and priorities must be set somehow.
but i’m sure any one of her intellectually nimble and nuanced commentators could explain why the natural fallacy and the traditional fallacy utilized by cam advocates are entirely fallacious.
you don’t get so fixated on treating a patient’s cancer that you neglect to treat his other medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension, some of which might kill him before the cancer does.
for most of human existence, and in some places to this very day, human beings have faced periodic severe food shortages, permanently stunting growth and creating additional health problems.
no, i’m saying that those h-gs that did survive into adulthood had more robust health and longer life expectancies than their agricultural neighbors.
that’s like saying if zero-point energy was invented tomorrow and the creators ate mainly twinkies, and were able to use their resources to take over the world within several decades, that now twinkies are the ideal food because the zero-pointers have been such a grand success.
right, so outside of urban areas, which have their own urban ills, people did much better.
i find it hard to believe that medical school information is taught entirely as absolutes… i dunno, maybe i’ve become too cynical, but the premise that amy’s blogging style has been a deliberate “teaching” method seems implausible.
the difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods (including pesticides). .
although appalling, this is probably in line with mortality rates in other ape and primate species.
while i find alt medicine claims about “tradition” as being some form of proof silly, i also find it quite entertaining that dr tuteur herself seems unable to move beyond certain traditional medical beliefs that contemporary medical science doesn’t subscribe to and is actually quite reactionary in her beliefs rather than curious about contemporary science and new discoveries.
at some point, they became skilled hunters and were able to obtain meat.
he presented contemporary studies and didn’t simply make grand (and often inaccurate) assertions about the past like you’ve been doing.
as a woman, i’m very glad i live in the time i do and i appreciate our technological advances.
i could say the same about the hysterectomy rate- too many unnecessary surgeries.
so the majority of skeletons are in their 30s, giving us an average life expectancy around 35.
— more dependence on local crops, so a boom-and-bust cycle of feast and famine.
if you didn’t, you might be forced to actually have some evidence behind your claims.
i realize that i may not correctly understand what is meant by ebm although from a quick glance i suspect that it isn’t written in stone and that different institutions give it different definitions.)
h-g had disease, but they weren’t/aren’t the diseases of agriculture.
children are helpless for the first decade of life, so the survival of genes is dependent on there being a large support network to ensure the survival of children, even if their parents die.

in fact, i accepted the statement, “all else being equal, stunted growth is typically symptomatic of malnourishment.”
but the modern lifestyle is definitely a big factor.
the cooked meat was still more nutritious and that nutrition could be accessed by the first people who cooked meat.
does the professor summarily dismisses legitimate research that conflicts with his/her theories, while not providing any evidence for his/her theories?
the hunter gathers only exist in tiny, isolated populations that will soon be extinct.
ruth scurr in her book “fatal purity” has written about the ideals of the french revolution, which were inspired considerably by the philosophy of proverbial romantic jj rousseau and how these ideals could lead to a reign of terror.
from the little i’ve read (which is far more than the average person, but probably not as much as the commenters here), organic farming has pluses and minuses.
i am happy to admit that modern medicine saves lives, because there are ample scientific reasons to believe it.
i don’t perceive many “threatened” commenters here, just people calling out those who state personal opinion as fact.
before modern sanitation, agriculture most likely lead to increased population, but decreased life expectancy.
# alison cummins on 19 feb 2010 at 5:20 pm for example, if there is a population who lives on nothing but mcdonald’s food for the next 10,000 years and then their children suddenly started eating a high-fibre, low-fat diet, i would expect to see a huge crisis in volvulus and diseases related to cholesterol deficiency.
not only that, it makes the moderate promoters of alternative medicine seem quite sane and realistic in comparison and their claims that sbm is simply about uncritically promoting industry over public health true.
it was beneficial for the new meat eaters anyway.”
the more complex model of disease allows us to assimilate evidence from different levels of scale (such as chemical reactions in a test tube, and success of different ancient societies).
in the case of “alternative” health, this is relatively easy to debunk since we have copious historical evidence on death rates, disease incidence, etc. # amy tuteur, md on 19 feb 2010 at 9:33 am jmb, thanks for the data and the explanations!
the differences in tooth wear and caries rate are very likely attributable to dietary differences between the two groups.
“on the circumcision thread where you refused to acknowledge that having performed circumcisions may lead a doctor to not want to see them as being harmful”

population statistics gives us accurate measures of disease incidence and mortality as a function of age.
however, life expectancy at age 50 is 75–which the u.s. did not match until 1980– and a signficant portion of the population reaches that age.
so his thesis is not irrelevant to amy’s contention that everyone died young before modern agriculture and medicine.
i know that most of you probably deal with a lot of people who have some fairly wacky ideas of medicine at a distance—i am not so lucky.
i find it strange that anyone would imply that we haven’t seen a huge impact on life expectancy from the effect that medicine has had on so many diseases.
copy and pasting a link, which might impress lay people, carries no weight here.
they can accumulate capital, which offers protection against lean times.
agriculture is a lot of work, and food preparation is a lot of work, and there just isn’t the availability to provide children with food all through the day.

that would not mean that the diet leads to better health since you first have to survive long enough to get heart disease and type ii diabetes.
indeed, some diseases can be completely prevented by vaccination.
this is why elders are revered cultures without a written language, and it may well be that the survival of that knowledge garners an evolutionary advantage to humans.
one of the means a society can use to space births is a taboo against sex for lactating women which may be a two to four year period.
also, if one is at all interested in basic cognitive science or psychology then it’s easy to spot the cognitive traps us humans fall into unconsciously if we’re not on guard for them, and sometimes even when we are.

the syndrome of periosteal inflammation was more common at hardin village than at indian knoll.
tooth decay was rampant at hardin village and led to early abscessing and tooth loss; decay was unusual at indian knoll and abscessing occurred later in life because of severe wear to the teeth.

“so much for the evolutionary advantage of the hunter gatherer diet: it has led to the near extinction of the hunter gatherers.”
hope that having you on board would increase traffic played no role in the decision to invite you to blog on sbm.
in a population of humans eating the only diet available to them over the course of, say, 100,000 years, heart disease will exert selection pressure to eliminate genes for susceptibility to heart diseaseunder those particular conditions from the gene pool only if 1) people can live long enough to get heart disease under those conditions anyway, and 2) people who are resistant to heart disease have more grandchildren.
i don’t think that is true, and she does not offer any substantiating evidence.
by the same token, others might be equally and oppositely biased by a tendency to pessimism and catastrophism.
yes, the average lifespan has dramatically increased, but that does not mean health has improved.
i very much enjoy this blog, it becomes exceedingly tedious to keep up with the good nuggets of info amongst the various squabbles.
i agree that agriculture benefitted us as a species.
the unhealthy die prematurely.
because they’re an isolated population that experiences little infectious disease, they provide a nice control for what a h-g diet looks like when you control for infectious disease.
but the more i read, the more i conclude that there are not easy answers, despite a few “expert” bloggers who insist there are.
if you are 40 now your life expectancy is greater than if you were 40 in 1800.
medieval medicine being what it was, on some level i’d rather be a peasant without a doctor than nobility with someone who will bleed me repeatedly and make me take gross, unproven remedies.
natural selection does not select for health, it selects for reproductive outcomes.
on the other hand, almost all of us in north america indirectly financially support factory farming of various kinds through all kinds of government subsidies given out – even if we choose to support local or organic agriculture by buying organic or local produce our tax dollars still support factory farming.

# sid offit on 18 feb 2010 at 11:53 am a reduction in infant mortality is responsible for any increase in average lifespan let me correct myself.
it’s like epigenetics, sports medicine, cognitive science, pain medicine, evolutionary biology, environmental health and so on simply don’t exist to dr tuteur.
perhaps though, i was so moved to write something because of the comments i read in reply to the post (and in replies to some of those replies), because of the general direction i fear skepticism is going in.
my point is that if a “paleolithic diet” has benefits to post-industrial folks (a hypothesis you told alex you were willing to entertain) that isnot irrelevant to your thesis that pre-industrial lives were uniformly short, or to your other statement (if i understood correctly) that mothers who survive into the adolescence of their children are no more genetically fit than mothers who die in childbirth, as long as the baby gets born alive.
as for reading, i am reading purely for entertainment value now, if at all.
very clean, very well-nourished.
i was explaining that proponents of the provocative style argue that if you are to educate people in critical thinking, you must provoke them to engage in their own literature research.
i’m not saying this is true, i’m saying that given that humans are social animals, there may be evolutionary advantages to longer life spans beyond mere reproductive age and accordingly it’s dangerous to write off over 40 as “old” from an evolutionary perspective.
it’s because they barely had enough to eat and sometimes starved.
replacing one religion with another isn’t freeing oneself from the fallacies of religion, it’s simply rejecting reality for another form of religion that pretends to be reality and not a religion.
the people i know who take this perspective insist that life expectancies in hunter/gatherer societies were 100+ years, and that while medicine has increased them drastically over the past 100 years, that’s only partially making up for the horrible health effects of civilization.
as the highest grossest movie of all time, i think it’s relevant to where we’re at as a culture.
here is a link to a science news article about dr stephanie venn watson’s research: http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/56441/title/dolphins_may_offer_clues_to_treating_diabetes i’m of the belief that if you don’t like someone’s writing style then you don’t read what they write!
while it would take studies to determine, whether or not, or to what degree, the lack of soap was responsible for their skin diseases, if i remember correctly, all really missed soap and were very happy when it was again available.

many childhood strep infections — and my paternal grandmother died of rheumatic heart disease.
i certainly don’t feel threatened by science or medicine, it’s what i grew up with and i have a very realistic perspective on it (both medicine and doctors are fallible and our understanding is constantly evolving – think critically here too and know your own body and family history..the basic stuff).
that’s what i mean by feeling threatened.
so much for the evolutionary advantage of the hunter gatherer diet: it has led to the near extinction of the hunter gatherers.

different populations in different areas had very different diets and different survival challenges so had very different health outcomes.
obesity, diabetes, asthma are all chronic diseases that have nothing to do with aging.
i’m sorry, i didn’t mean to: my ignorance is showing again.
from a completely anthropological point of view – life expectancy in ancient populations isn’t worked out from a mean of the whole population, it’s worked out from the tiny percentage of fossils we find.
basically, a native american civilization on another planet are portrayed as the good guys, while the evil technology driven armed forces attempts to exterminate them.
also, i woke up this morning listening to two episodes from npr’s science friday podcast which seem pertinent to this discussion.
agriculturalists often have access to milk; pastoralists definitely do.
the best measure of evolutionary success is population growth, and by that measure, agriculture was an extraordinary triumph.
for instance, all those 3rd-generation east-asian immigrants in north america who are so much taller than their grandparents.
the doctor would expect that the patient is at greater risk for diabetic problems when they get older, or endure physiologic stress (surgery, pregnancy, severe infection).
however, we simply don’t have conclusive evidence about how much disease genesis is genetic and how much is environmental for many forms of cancer so making grand claims about not having any control is simply not warranted either.
antibiotics cured it, but historically scarlet fever had a 15-20% mortality rate before antibiotics.
consider that type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity.
fwiw, i recently sent to the healthfraud list an account of some cme material i received.
my main confusion is why she’s allowed to plug in old blog entries of hers, when everybody else writes new, pertinent entries every week.
on other forums, dr. tuteur has gone so far to post full name, city, and occupation of anonymous posters that she feels threatened by (instead of addressing their points).
diagnostic problems apply to cancer as well.
normally, i just check-out the blogs to heighten my limited medical knowledge, find good arguments against quackery—which sadly many people i care about deeply engage in—and because i find a lot of comments interesting and fun.
so the best you could say about that diet is that it prevents heart disease and type ii diabetes, but it offers no advantage in terms of infectious disease, common medical problems (appendicitis), injuries or virtually anything else.
agreed, if a drug works no better than a placebo then it means the drug doesn’t work.

# fifi on 18 feb 2010 at 5:18 pm alex – “however, i think that it’s a mistake to completely write off the past and romanticize the present as being the best human society, in every aspect, that ever existed.”
the study above reviews the food-intake over over 250 modern hunter-gather tribes and examines their macronutrients.
dr tuteur – “my provocative posts are provocative because they challenge cherished wisdom.”
just as contemporary pollution contributes to both disease and death – this is one of the trade-offs of living in a city during any time.
and it’s clear that a combination of modern birth control, modern infection control and modern obstetrics reduces perinatal mortality.
ischemic heart disease or cancer can occur in a patient who is 75 who has eaten the healthiest diet, followed the best exercise regimen, minimized stress, etc.
there is no other time i would like to live in than the present (especially considering sexism and racism!), but modern technology isn’t perfect either.
(humans are animals like any other, you put too many of us in close quarters with poor sanitation and it becomes the perfect environment for diseases to incubate and spread between humans and other animals, as well as having detrimental psychlogical effects.)
still, i’d be interested to see some dietary studies on the sufferer’s of werner’s syndrome to see if any particular macronutrient compositions help or hinder treatment.
there was no obesity, and people got lots of exercise.
# karl withakay on 18 feb 2010 at 2:30 pm alison cummins, i never maid any claim that food restriction does not result in stunted growth.
midwives in the uk get paid for doing their job (which includes employing the best available evidence) regardless of whether their recreation is commenting on sbm or yoga.
if a living mother has no value, it makes no difference whether her children are at higher risk of down syndrome.
life expectancies for both sexes at all ages were lower at hardin village than at indian knoll.
i wasn’t aware that i was fighting anything.
the point is that, as usual, you’re being ideological and simplistic and giving the impression that real public health issues are simply being fabricated by alt med types rather than being the domain of medicine and public health concerns also advanced by the medical establishment.
it’s true that the greatest evolutionary advantage of humans over other species is our behavioural adaptability.
“for example her statement that people living in the modern world “still prey to the same illnesses and accidents, but now they can be effectively treated” just isn’t true.
surgical attendings just call the student a wimp (or worse) and tell the residents to keep the student out of their sight.
all those people crammed in together burning whatever they could get their hands on for fuel was a recipe for disease and early death.
i think dr. hall admitted that some of lomberg’s data was wrong, just that it didn’t make any difference to his “common sense” positions.
you seem pretty proud not to have learned anything in your 15 years of blogging and pretty narcissistically engaged with using sbm as a soapbox to affirm your personal identity.
by that definition, any herbal treatments which are not useless (eg foxglove for dropsy, white willow bark for fever and pain) are not alternative.
the forerunners of every major discovery or advancement in conservation and real environmentalism (ie, out in the field actually fighting for it with science to back them up, not buying “eco-friendly” toilet paper) have all been practical, down-to-earth sorts who abhor fundamentalism and all double as professional skeptics.
if i understand alex’s interpretation of sbm, the lack of one very high quality study controlling for all variables, means that there is insufficient evidence to draw any reasonable conclusion.
indeed, i would venture to guess that you keep throwing out citations because constructing an argument to support your claim is literally impossible.
but in my experience the sticking point is precisely what was simply asserted without any detailed discussion – “for most of human existence, according to fossil and anthropological data, the average human lifespan was 35 years.”
the problem is, most people don’t even realize when they receive treatment for life threatening diseases.
if my claims in this piece and the subsequent comment thread are correct, you’re not doing much of anything for your health by following your diet, and you just might get cad or cancer anyway.
(this one focuses on glucose tolerance for type 2 diabetes patients with ischaemic heart disease and notes that a paleolithic type diet produced better glucose tolerance than a mediterranean consensus diet.)
no, but you can look at turn of the century comparative research on heart attacks of native v. western populations within the same region.
harriet said that some herbal treatments are (or could be) an exception to the general statement that alternative medicine as useless, though they are inferior to their pharmaceutical counterparts.
despite this, incidence of obesity is much less common than among similar population groups eating a modern western diet.
a reduction in infant mortality is responsible for any increase in average lifespan and that increase had nothing to do with any of your imagined medical miracles – unless you believe not drinking filthy water to be a medical miracle
biological and clinical potential of a paleolithic diet.
dr. t accuses those of us who advocate a healthy lifestyle of romanticizing the past.
alex was saying that there’s no evidence that modern agriculture provides a healthier diet.
to die antiseptically in a hospital was almost unknown.
as we increase the percentage of people living past 100, we may see increasing incidence of leukemia/lymphoma, immune disorders, cardiac valvular disease, osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome.
not everyone who is critical or modern medicine and modern agriculture is a romantic primitivist who thinks we should go back to the stone age.
amy promptly made comments on the stone age diet but they made no sense; she also demonstrated a poor understanding of evolution and made statements about the history of human diet (that our ancestors did not eat meat) that were simply false.
i think that, given the available evidence, it’s more reasonable to assume that advances in health are almost solely due to modern medicine and not the industrial methods of farming.
while it’s theoretically possible for a particular human community to be hunter-gatherers while having access to modern medicine, modern medicine is dependent on agriculture and fuel.
in sbm blogging and scientific research, good reputation and scientific authority can be greatly damaged by bad publicity based on bad behavior and promoting bad science.
manipulating the spine can cure some problems, but results are mixed.
my wife’s sister, age 85, has some sort of adult asthma, which nearly killed her 8 years ago.
i know peer reviewed research is big around here and good.
this is not the first instance in history where we see a strong longing for a better, more “natural” world.
also, it isn’t *only* the same 5 posters calling dr. tuteur out on her inaccuracies.
also, conflating medicine with pesticides and commercial farming just doesn’t make any sense.
just because it sounds “common sense” to you or aligns with your beliefs doesn’t mean his approach is actually evidence or science based – even if he makes a ritual showing of presenting science.
we may not know precisely what paleolithic humans were eating, but we have a pretty good idea of what they were not: refined sugar, especially fructose (wild, ancient fruits weren’t bred for hypersweetness) grains (especially gluten grains) in any appreciable amounts (just try harvesting enough wild grain to bake a loaf of bread)
does the professor summarily dismisses legitimate research that conflicts with his/her theories, while not providing any evidence for his/her theories?”
the difference is that somebody intellectually honest will make it very clear that this is their opinion, they have biases, and they are not an expert.
yeah, some herbs may work, but you wouldn’t use them in preference to pharmacological preparations with their standard and guaranteed amounts of active ingredient, no unnecessary stuff added in, and no potentially harmful contaminants inadvertantly or deliberately added (to be even more accurate)
alison, i also have read that hunter-gatherers cannot carry their children long distances, so they tend to have less of them (due to lactational ammenorhea, assuming).
# hairyape68 on 18 feb 2010 at 6:16 pm the us presidents make a reasonable sample of white males who lived past about 50 years of age.
there is no evidence that the paleolithic diet was the “best” diet; it was the only diet.
i cannot speak for dr tuteur, i just recognized a style of teaching and a thread of scientific reasoning in the earlier posts that triggered my memories.
i noted that 2 of the 11 comments were actually cross-reference comments.
so once again i say that the available evidence suggests that we could promote better health by keeping the advantages of modern medicine, while at the same time steering our agricultural industry and diet to one that emulates the macronutrient constitution of a paleolithic diet.
the evidence that doing well on any particular diet conferred an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors would have to come from several sources, but it wouldinclude evidence that we do well on that diet compared to other diets, all else being equal.
kind of like living in a modern industrial city is hell for some people (life expectancy of 57 for dc african-american men) and very nice for some people, thank you very much (life expectancy of 92 for affluent asian-americans).
of course, no one really listens to scientists – particularly when it requires making changes and there’s a lot of money and power at stake and industry has more clout.
in these circumstances the taboo against sex with a lactating woman is very strong.
for example, the union of concerned scientists—a very rational, caring, and science-based organization—has been critical of modern agricultural practices, like the use of pesticides, for years.
seeing really isn’t believing and common sense is just as often misleading as it is accurate (and is subjective at best, highly biased at worst).
public health measures may account for a significant fraction in improvement between 1900 and 1950, but modern medicine would still have had an effect.
there is no reason to think that what we ate was the ideal diet; it was merely the available diet.
personally, i think children surviving is a pretty good indication that we have a healthier population!
dr tuteur – well, to deal with reality there are some mds who peddle woo that also peddle naturalist fallacies.
or, as amy says, we are now able to cure or prevent the things that children used to die from, something that ‘ancienct wisdom’ couldn’t do.
the first one, from a study of dolphins working with the u.s. navy in san diego bay, discovered that dolphins in a “fasting” state, i.e. just eating a few fish, go into a diabetic-like high blood sugar state to allow the liver to provide the blood sugar needed to support a large brain.
for instance, while most of us who support sbm probably have very rational reasons for doing so, my guess is that quite a few of us are also passionate about science, medicine and sbm and that contributes to why we participate here.
given that the causes of type ii diabetes are still murky, i would hesitate to label this as a cure.
you can challenge me and i will be helpless before you, but this was part of my senior thesis.
i can tell people that there isn’t a shred of evidence for many of these “remedies” only to see them back weeks later, carrying those and others.
real food only (meat, fish, fowl, natural fats, veggies, fruits, nuts).
on a side note, i am well aware of the scientific evidence that severe dietary restriction slows down aging, that is a separate issue.
science education isn’t just about reading a textbook to determine what the consensus of textbook writers determines are scientific facts and concepts.
(poor carter tried to wake up the us regarding energy independence and the environment but was trounced out of office for it.
health problems were treated with folk wisdom and natural remedies.
even when the experts have pointed out the bad science and how the science is being manipulated for ideological ends!
resistant to iron-deficiency anemia on that diet.
as i stated in my comment upthread, “i actually prefer the idea that [amy tuteur] is deliberately using a pedagogical technique of withholding crucial elements or including distractors to get her readers to think for themselves.
jmb, i’m not sure that a genetic disorder completely supports the hypothesis of heart disease, diabetes and cancer being merely “diseases of age.”
the advantage of survivorship curves and life tables is the demonstration of mortality as a function of age.
while the teaching could be pretty harsh, the price of incompetence in a resident is high.
my understanding is that her role is to increase traffic at sbm.
legumes are even higher in fat and protein.
and i hypothesize that one could probably increase their lifespan substantially.
empirical evidence (from current medical experiments) will tell us that diet, exercise, genetic inheritance, and behavioral factors all contribute to diseases that have a higher incidence in a group of people over forty (that does not deny that they may be factors in people under forty).
my point is that if a “paleolithic diet” has benefits to post-industrial folks (a hypothesis you told alex you were willing to entertain) that isnot irrelevant to your thesis that pre-industrial lives were uniformly short, or to your other statement (if i understood correctly) that mothers who survive into the adolescence of their children are no more genetically fit than mothers who die in childbirth, as long as the baby gets born alive.
“which compared the archaeological evidence of two groups of native americans in the same region, of which one was a hunter-gatherer society (referred to as “indian knoll”) and the other was agricultural (referred to as “hardin village”).
you’re making the same kind of error involving confirmation biases that believers of woo do about “traditional” cures and so on.
earlier weaning of infants leads to more children per mother, all other things being equal.
second, domesticated animals introduced new disease.
zoe has not only betrayed her prejudices, but she has demonstrated a fine disregard for the truth by constantly misrepresenting what i write.
“fitness is about the production of successful offspring and the population boom in the last 100 years has clearly shown that the evolution of agriculture benefited us as a species.”
it is not romanticizing to admit that we have some problems now, or that some things were better in some previous societies.
of course, they also suffered from other things which could affect their skin, such as, in some cases malnutrition or just very poor diets.
in all fairness, i note that life expectancy was significantly higher in the countryside, at least as far as the data we have suggest.
it does seem very much like blogging at sbm is about career/reputation/audience/customer building for dr tuteur and not actually about truly being a skeptical blogger and supporter of the practice of sbm.
acog along with he us healthy people guidelines also set some numerical goals.
it’s pretty outrageous (but interesting) to watch all this unfold on an sbm blog.
of course, there are psychiatrists and psychologists who create dependence in their patients as well or simply prescribe pills inappropriately (as unethical as that is) and not all mds are capable of providing or arranging the kind of support someone may be seeking or need (due to lack of interpersonal skills, training in psychology or simply time).
i also think different students responded to different styles of education.
in one case a great aunt died of pnemounia when she went to care of her sister who was dying of breast cancer.
later on she states that it’s not possible for chronic diseases of aging to have exerted selection pressure during human evolution because people died young.
and if there was an issue of food scarcity and the people were suffering from malnutrition (which was a real possibility) they would have been less likely to fight off infections.
dr tuteur, for someone who continually claims not to take things personally you respond exactly like someone who’s ego is threatened and is taking any critiques made personally.
i am doubtful that this happened very often even in ancient hunter-gatherer societies, especially given the paleontological evidence even in homo erectus of taking care of seriously disabled tribe/clan members, and, more notably, the fact that it isn’t common in modern hunter-gatherer societies (what few still exist).
use the thing that’s achieving the effect – understanding, empathy, compassion, psychology etc” not always – some herbs like st-john’s wart have evidence behind it, so do meditation, exercise and diet.
if early childhood illness didn’t get you, and early adulthood illness didn’t get you, and middle age illness didn’t get you, you certainly could live to a ripe old age.
