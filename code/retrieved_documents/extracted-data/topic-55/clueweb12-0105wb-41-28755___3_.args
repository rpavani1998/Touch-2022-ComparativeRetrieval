this is the first randomized clinical trial to address the relative effectiveness of primary medical versus chiropractic care and the effectiveness of physical therapy or physical modalities for patients with low back pain within a managed care practice setting with salaried providers.physical therapy appears to be more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the magnitude of this possible benefit is minimal.assessment of the costs and potential risks associated with each treatment strategy would be helpful in more fully understanding the roles of medical providers, chiropractors, and physical therapists in the treatment of low back pain.physical therapy may be marginally more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the possible benefit is small.the authors of review papers and treatment guidelines have concluded that acetaminophen, [5,14] nsaids, [ 5,11,14,28,49] muscle relaxants, [11,49] conditioning exercises and certain aerobic activities, [5] and spinal manipulation [5,40] may provide shortterm benefit for patients with acute low back pain; nsaids, [ 49] exercise therapy, [19,49] and spinal manipulation [49] may be of some benefit for patients with chronic low back pain.findings from a national network of physical therapy practices showed that the combination of modalities and exercise is the most frequently used treatment strategy for patients with lumbar impairments.an intervention with physical therapist-led exercise classes was found to be more effective than primary medical care for patients with subacute low back pain after 6 and 12 months.physical therapy appears to be more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients after 6 months, but the magnitude of this possible benefit is not large.medical and chiropractic care without physical therapy or physical modalities yielded similar improvements in pain severity and disability after 6 months of follow-up.the authors of a well-designed observational study concluded that among patients with low back pain of less than 10 weeks duration seen by primary care physicians, chiropractors, and orthopedic surgeons, pain and functional status outcomes were similar at 6 months, and costs were higher for patients of orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors.medical providers, chiropractors, and physical therapists outside this network may differ in their approaches to low back pain care; and patients under fee-for-service, workers compensation, personal injury, and other reimbursement models may differ in ways that affect treatment outcomes.the findings suggest that physical therapy patients may have greater reductions in disability, on average, than do patients in the medical care-only group from 6 weeks to 6 months, resulting in relatively better 6-month disability outcomes; however, these small differences may be chance findings and may not persist with continued follow- up.medical providers, chiropractors, and physical therapists outside this network may differ in their approaches to low back pain care; and patients under fee-for-service, workersâ€™ compensation, personal injury, and other reimbursement models may differ in ways that affect treatment outcomes.[34] in patients with chronic pain, physical therapy and medically supervised exercise were found to be better than unsupervised exercise in terms of pain intensity, functional status, and cost per sick day after 12 months following 3 months of therapy in norway.[22] the active approach used by the physical therapy staff may be responsible for the relatively better 6-month disability outcomes experienced by the physical therapy patients.
