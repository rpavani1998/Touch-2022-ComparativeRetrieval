chiropractic chiropractic spinal manipulation is one of the most popular treatments for acute and chronic back pain in the us, and it may provide at least modest benefit; however, as yet, research evidence has failed to find chiropractic manipulation convincingly more effective than standard medical care.49,50,76 chiropractic does seem to be more effective than placebo, if not by a great deal.in the case of arthritic joints, increased ligament strength would allow the joint to function more efficiently, reducing pain.surgery may be recommended in certain cases, such as when there are severe disc problems, but most forms of back surgery also lack reliable supporting evidence.however, there is little reliable evidence that these treatments actually provide much benefit.however, there is some evidence that the technique may be beneficial when combined with other therapies.the results showed that while the use of alternative therapies improved patient satisfaction, it did not significantly improve symptoms.when used alone prolotherapy is probably no more effective than a placebo injection for the treatment of chronic low back pain.unimpressive results were also seen in a well-designed study of 321 people with back pain, comparing chiropractic manipulation, a special form of physical therapy (the mackenzie method), and the provision of an educational booklet in treating low back pain.25 all groups improved to about the same extent.the little-known injection technique known as prolotherapy may be effective for back pain as well.in a review of five studies, three found prolotherapy to be no more effective than control treatments for treating low back pain.in one interesting study, 444 people with acute low back pain were randomly assigned to receive either usual care or usual care plus a choice of alternative therapies (chiropractic, acupuncture, or massage).68 the results showed that while the use of alternative therapies improved patient satisfaction, it did not significantly improve symptoms.a review of the literature found no more than weak preliminary evidence that alexander may help with back pain, but concluded that further research is warranted.56a subsequent controlled trial involving 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain found that alexander technique lessons, particularly when combined with exercise, was more effective than normal care or massage after one year.78 prolotherapy the use of prolotherapy to treat back pain has had mixed results in clinical studies.preliminary evidence suggests that proteolytic enzymesmight be helpful for back pain.44 various herbs and supplements may interact adversely with drugs used to treat back pain.in a review of 13 randomized trials, researchers concluded that massage may be effective for nonspecific low back pain, and the beneficial effects can last for up to 1 year in patients suffering from chronic pain.77they also noted that exercise and education appear to enhance the effectiveness of massage.in a detailed review of 7 randomized trials, researchers were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of lllt for nonspecific low back pain.73 many other studies have compared acupuncture to such treatments as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens), physical therapy, chiropractic care, and massage.14,33-37,59in many of these trials, acupuncture provided benefits comparable to the other options tested.
