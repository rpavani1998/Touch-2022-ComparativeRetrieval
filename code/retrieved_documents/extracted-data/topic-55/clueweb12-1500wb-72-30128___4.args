i have suffered with back, neck, shoulder, and hip and pelvic pain for 25 years.
if you live in pain, then you know how comforting and affirming it is to find a doctor who truly understands, cares, and can offer solutions.
www.koutures.com life is an adventure, sometimes you go down a road that you know isn't the road you should have taken, but there is no off ramp for you.
one, the professional and caring way they have treated me, the help with the mental issues of my injury and the skilled care of my pilates instructor have guided me to desire and attempt to get stronger and to be wiser in allowing myself to make myself important enough to take the time and needed finances to allow me to live a fuller and more active life.
i have found the treatments your facility has provided to be extremely beneficial.
the pilates wellness staff have also taken my particular needs into account at every session, and i am learning to use their techniques to correct my posture and movements in all my daily activities.
it's a great feeling when someone can pin point your pain and know exactly how far to take it, and to stop before they get there.
dr. ando was awesome.
the pilates wellness staff have also taken my particular needs into account at every session, and i am learning to use their techniques to correct my posture and movements in all my daily activities.
besides not finding any real solutions, i often felt misunderstood, invalidated, and even dismissed by doctors who treated me simply because they could not help me.
i had my surgery with dr. derek dee a few months ago and have been back to the center for my pt.
the staff here was very friendly.
after successfully completing a therapy and exercise treatment program of several months duration, i have continued to work out in the wellness side of the clinic.
gratefully, victoria himes brea, ca age 42 over the past years i have been struggling with severe shoulder and neck pain along with nerve issues due to a disorder called thoracic outlet syndrome (tos).
their staff is so well trained, so compassionate and knowledgeable and they enabled me to gradually get back into sports i love and to be able to move without fear.
it was embarrassing because any where i went out in public i had to know where all the bathrooms were at.
my physical therapy treatment not only has been an effective option for this episode of pain, but has also instructed me on maintaining good health going forward.
i then asked these miracle therapists if there was anything that could be done about the leg aches and muscle cramps, lower back pain and limp, that i had been coping with since a total hip replacement seven years ago.
my physical therapist, dr. james sposa, was very professional and compassionate.
the staff at ando & aston are pleasant, courteous and helpful.
my disabilities quickly forced a social dilemma as well.
martin carr, m.d. i had quite a few problems with my back, shoulder, and hips.
in addition, my head movements were terribly compromised.
epidurals didn't help the pain, my excessive weight didn't help either.
when i showed up here i will admit i was very skeptical and defensive because most places seem to leave me in more pain.
i have suffered low back pain for 19 years and, these last 4 months, such debilitating knee pain that i had to give up yoga altogether.
dr. art ando, gary, and char are also among the best physical therapists you'll ever find.
their expertise allowed them to diagnose my illusive problems, which had evaded other healers.
i immediately saw a difference; i was able to get through the day without any problems.
they also are wonderful communicators- with patients, families, and other health care professionals-
having to look up caused excruciating pains in my neck and shoulders.
as a result of the physical wellness therapy i have heightened my body awareness, and have learned how to self-manage any day to day discomfort from activities such as gardening or lifting.
the hands on aspect was absolutely amazing.
i liked the fact that i wasn't just passed along to a student who doesn't have the years of experience as dr. ando.
old dance teacher, yoga practitioner and ballet student, working around or refusing to give in to chronic pain.
art ando's initial thorough evaluation made me confident that i had found the right physical therapist, and all of his associates and staff reinforced that confidence at every visit.
i tried biofeedback, physical therapy, chiropractors, water therapy, medications, and numerous other means of healing.
i found an orthopedic physician who works with dancers,
i use to get up 2-3 times a night to use the bathroom and wasn't sleeping through the night.
luckily for me he referred me to dr. art ando, physical therapist.
f.w. dear fellow pain sufferers, i am happy to share my experiences at ando and aston physical wellness therapy in hopes that other pain sufferers will find the incredible relief that i have.
i'd take several steps back, which made it much easier to give eye contact whenever someone was taller than me, which was the majority.
they really pay attention to you when you're doing your exercises to make sure you're doing them correctly.
my knee pain is gone.
it got to the point where i was nervous about walking through a large parking lot when i had a cold because i was afraid i would loss control of my bladder.
my hand was still weaker than normal, and stiffness and pain in my arm and shoulder and upper back continued to disturb me.
when i first came to ando and aston it was after a back surgery, and i had given up being able to live what i call a normal life.
they are not afraid of more complex cases; in fact, they seem to thrive on the more difficult presentations.
www.koutures.com life is an adventure, sometimes you go down a road that you know isn't the road you should have taken, but there is no off ramp for you.
i was a year out from undergoing major surgery to correct hand weakness and arm pain from thoracic outlet syndrome, and was still dealing with problems from previous cervical disk herniation and rotator cuff tear.
i sneezed the other day and braced like physical therapist trained me to do and was successful.
they are quick to return your call and will make sure your questions (about insurance and such) are answered.
they also demonstrate genuine concern for the clients, which has been very obvious at each of my 3 times per week visits.
they patiently helped me to put my life back together through physical therapy and then they opened their pilates studio.
they are an awesome bunch of people.
i felt like the tin man, caught out in the rain.
jenny and melissa, the front office administrators, are the most efficient foa's i've ever met.
this has helped me to follow the instructions for home exercise as well, which has also proven to be very helpful.
my first impression about this facility was the professionalism displayed by all the staff members.
nicole u bellflower, ca if you are in need of physical therapy, you must know that not all physical therapy centers are equal and not all physical therapist are the same.
under the guidance of their highly qualified instructors i enjoy using the pilates equipment as well as the participating in the mat classes.
this was over ten years ago and i have continued working in their studio to keep myself strong and flexible to enable me to live an active life.
i could actually look up and down, and even glance over my shoulder, left and right.
i've put off visiting my daughter in new york ever since she moved into a 5-story walk-up three years ago (even sports events were more than i could handle)

i felt like the tin man, caught out in the rain.
i've put off visiting my daughter in new york ever since she moved into a 5-story walk-up three years ago (even sports events were more than i could handle)
my doctor told me, "do everything they tell you, and you won't see my knife."
and ingrid (who also holds a doctor of physical therapy degree) is the best pt intern.
i am definitely not cured, but i didn't come here expecting that.
but with ando & aston's expertise, my body's response was drastically different.
that task required the skills of a contortionist.
the staff and front office were all wonderful and i would not hesitate for one moment to refer my family and friends to the team at ando & aston.
ando & aston does not just focus on the local problem- they integrate the whole body in designing their therapeutic approach.
i have fibromyalgia, arthritis, carpel tunnel syndrome, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and more.
in the past, i often got some relief from treatments, but sadly the following day muscles would clamp down tight, and my body would grow stiff all over again.
after 2 months of therapy, dr. james sposa, who holds a doctor of physical therapy degree, was the one who recognized my shoulder had a bigger problem than what i was being treated for and suggested i see an orthopedic surgeon.
regardless, i still could not open my mouth more than two fingers wide.
i found an orthopedic physician who works with dancers, dr. chris koutures using the internet.
your facility is clean and bright, and has easy parking arrangements, with a short walk to the entrance, that i truly appreciated when i was in such great pain!
i can't thank them enough.
i have had two invasive surgeries that have brought no relief what so ever from the pain.
sincerely, barbara macurda i am glad that i was referred to dr. art ando who treated me for immediate relief of my longstanding severe back pain.
they are not afraid of more complex cases; in fact, they seem to thrive on the more difficult presentations.
i would highly recommend your services to anyone in the future, and i told my doctor i am very happy that he recommended you to me.
unfortunately due to recent changes in reimbursement structure with blue cross of ca, a&a has had to modify its treatment plans and strategies as well.
i am lucky that i discovered this unique physical therapy practice.
i was looking for someone who could give me some answers and home exercises that will continue to help aide in my recovery.
art took the care to help me relearn how to sit, stand, and walk, as well as to learn techniques of self-care that i will apply the rest of my life.
all these years in the waiting and i can finally gaze up at the night sky to thank my lucky stars.
at the suggestion of a pain center in l.a., i searched for a physical therapy facility that also used pilates as part of treatment.
this was about 5 weeks ago and since then have seen art for physical therapy, seen their guided imagery specialist to help me with issues that were blocking my healing and have returned to pilates on a weekly basis.
the staff and front office were all wonderful and i would not hesitate for one moment to refer my family and friends to the team at ando & aston.
before the first session was over, i had complete confidence in his ability to assess my entire physical nature and root out the sources of not just the knee pain, but chronic tightness and imbalances i had developed over my lifetime, dr. ando, dr. james sposa and the entire staff were able to educate and encourage me to move with better awareness of habitual patterns contributing to chronic problems.
unfortunately due to recent changes in reimbursement structure with blue cross of ca, a&a has had to modify its treatment plans and strategies as well.
because the practice offers a variety of services with doctors specializing in different areas they were able to address all of my pain issues (which is such a relief to someone who deals with multiple medical issues!).
jenny and melissa, the front office administrators, are the most efficient foa's i've ever met.
at the suggestion of a pain center in l.a., i searched for a physical therapy facility that also used pilates as part of treatment.
i was given a brief tour of the gym area which was clean and well spaced out.
even sitting down for a meal, and having to turn to the person seated next to me, was nearly impossible.
they incorporate manual and soft tissue manipulations that, in my view, are vital to your recovery.
the violent blows caused permanent damage to my jaws, head, neck, back, and arms.
when i showed up here i will admit i was very skeptical and defensive because most places seem to leave me in more pain.
this was over ten years ago and i have continued working in their studio to keep myself strong and flexible to enable me to live an active life.
i loved my experience as a physical therapy patient as well as a wellness client at ando & aston.
send them a knee issue, and they will look at the entire chain from the spine down to the toes- and that's why their patients do well not just with the immediate problem, but also with increased function and less injury risk years down the road.
instead of having to collect my records and restate my problem over and over as i move from one doctor's office to the next, i simply go to my treatments and in between they discuss my situation and collaborate on how to best help me.
i am living a normal life again in much less pain and with significant improvement with each of my medical problems.
epidurals didn't help the pain, my excessive weight didn't help either.
i immediately saw a difference; i was able to get through the day without any problems.
in additional to dr. sposa, i'd also like to give kudos to everyone at the center.
because the practice offers a variety of services with doctors specializing in different areas they were able to address all of my pain issues (which is such a relief to someone who deals with multiple medical issues!).
quite simply, i know they will receive a comprehensive and thoughtful evaluation followed by an appropriately challenging rehabilitation program.
this has helped me to follow the instructions for home exercise as well, which has also proven to be very helpful.
my youngest daughters were two and four years old at the time of my injury; too young to remember i once carried them in my arms, or pushed them high on a swing.
gary has been treating my heels for the last 3 months and i really appreciate his patience with my problematic heels.
they also demonstrate genuine concern for the clients, which has been very obvious at each of my 3 times per week visits.
in 5 sessions, their team fixed that problem plus the neck aches that had bothered me off and on for years.
sometimes i have hesitation working with a student intern, but not ingrid, she can really hold her own.
send them a knee issue, and they will look at the entire chain from the spine down to the toes- and that's why their patients do well not just with the immediate problem, but also with increased function and less injury risk years down the road.
to ando & aston their diagnosis just made sound sense.
it seemed that every social situation caused me fear of the unexpected.
fran o. dear art, i am writing to let you know that i am greatly appreciative of the efforts you and your staff have made for me while i have been in physical therapy at your facility in anaheim hills.
i have yet to meet any other physical therapy group with such fine tuned understanding of the muscles, nerves, and structure and function of the human body.
to ando & aston their diagnosis just made sound sense.
i first sought treatment at ando & aston when my shoulder became so painful i couldn't lie down or sleep through the night.
dr. art ando, physical therapist and his amazing staff through the years have taught me about how to heal and maintain my body so that i can do the things (maybe differently than i used to do them) but enabled me to keep my life active and satisfying.
i have to tell you how amazing it was once i realized i could move my head every single day, and my pain was beginning to fade.
i have been educated during my treatments in regard to the various inner workings of the human body, in order to help me understand what i can expect as my condition improves.
i continually learn from their superb skills, and continually watch my patients improve in strength, function, and overall health.
i have fibromyalgia, arthritis, carpel tunnel syndrome, herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and more.
i experienced incessant blinding headaches, which landed me in emergency rooms countless times.
all these years in the waiting and i can finally gaze up at the night sky to thank my lucky stars.
one of the most incredible traits of the practice that i have noticed is that the doctors communicate with each other regarding a patient's progress.
i liked the fact that i wasn't just passed along to a student who doesn't have the years of experience as dr. ando.
my first impression about this facility was the professionalism displayed by all the staff members.
their expertise allowed them to diagnose my illusive problems, which had evaded other healers.
they are quick to return your call and will make sure your questions (about insurance and such) are answered.
i had almost given up and resigned myself to a life of pain and physical mediocrity when i was referred to ando and aston.
quite simply, i know they will receive a comprehensive and thoughtful evaluation followed by an appropriately challenging rehabilitation program.
i entered pt at the recommendation of my m.d. as the result of severe lower back and hip pain from an injury i sustained earlier in the year.
their staff is so well trained, so compassionate and knowledgeable and they enabled me to gradually get back into sports i love and to be able to move without fear.
so far, i have been treated by five doctors at ando and aston physical wellness therapy and each one has done just that.
since my head couldn't turn, i learned to turn my entire body one way or the other, especially when standing in a group.
i've no doubt she will do very well once she finishes her internship and starts her career as a physical therapist.
gary aston pt, one of the clinic owners, did a thorough and methodical evaluation and came up with a treatment plan.
i entered pt at the recommendation of my m.d. as the result of severe lower back and hip pain from an injury i sustained earlier in the year.
i couldn't even pass food platters around, as my arms had little strength and i could only raise one arm at a time.
i am so glad i am back on track, and in the care of such a special group of people that really care about me and the quality of my life.
dr. art ando comprehensive physical therapist my life started to improve the moment i was referred to the ando and aston physical wellness therapy in anaheim hills.
that task required the skills of a contortionist.
what sets this center apart from the rest is that they don't just tell you to exercise on your own.
after getting a gastric by-pass to help with the weight problem, i returned to the pilates exercise as a wellness client, and continue to improve in my body awareness, core strength and overall well-being.

wendy c. anaheim hills, ca after treatment at ando & aston physical wellness therapy, i'll never again believe anybody who tells me i have to live with the aches and pains of growing old.
they're grown women now, but they, too, cried when they saw how well i could move.
i am lucky that i discovered this unique physical therapy practice.
i even had to compensate in order to drive a car, using side mirrors instead of looking over my shoulder, and making thousands of right hand turns, instead of crossing traffic, just to keep everyone safe.
before the first session was over, i had complete confidence in his ability to assess my entire physical nature and root out the sources of not just the knee pain, but chronic tightness and imbalances i had developed over my lifetime, dr. ando, dr. james sposa and the entire staff were able to educate and encourage me to move with better awareness of habitual patterns contributing to chronic problems.

i have also gone to countless physical therapy offices looking for an answer.
the relentless tightness in the stabilizing muscles throughout my low back, pelvis and front of the thighs is slowly letting go.
this is where i have been and am so grateful to be back on the correct road for me.
about 7 months ago i had a wake up call and had a big set back and erroneously due to forgetting that i was worth the financial and physical commitment, i decided i was just not going to be able to continue the commitment with myself and ando & aston.
it didn't feel like they were treating my problem and ignoring everything else.
my doctor told me, "do everything they tell you, and you won't see my knife."

they took into account the shoes i wear, the way i walk, sleep, sit and warm-up and stretch for dance.

the 5-step functional approach (viewable in the ‘for pt’s section of our andoaston.comwebsite) i used to help barbara was intended to not miss any of the factors involved in her pain and functional loss, and was actually developed for patients like her.
art took the care to help me relearn how to sit, stand, and walk, as well as to learn techniques of self-care that i will apply the rest of my life.
i couldn't even pass food platters around, as my arms had little strength and i could only raise one arm at a time.
i could not have achieved this without the persistent guidance of dr. ando and staff.
i have yet to meet any other physical therapy group with such fine tuned understanding of the muscles, nerves, and structure and function of the human body.
i could not have achieved this without the persistent guidance of dr. ando and staff.
after the first two sessions, i was already able to move my head---and not just a little.
if i was sitting and someone approached, i'd stand as well.
dr. art ando, gary, and char are also among the best physical therapists you'll ever find.
ando & aston have indeed given me a precious gift---a gift of life filled with new possibilities.
it's a great feeling when someone can pin point your pain and know exactly how far to take it, and to stop before they get there.
my experience with ando & aston physical therapy was very rewarding.
i tried biofeedback, physical therapy, chiropractors, water therapy, medications, and numerous other means of healing.
having to look up caused excruciating pains in my neck and shoulders.
thanks to a recent visit to my 2nd opinion orthopedic surgeon, he suggested i get back to ando and aston, and give it 4 to 6 weeks of intense work.
regardless, i still could not open my mouth more than two fingers wide.
i like that the physical therapist at ando and aston didn't just treat my problem by addressed my whole body.
even my jaws were working better, and i could finally open my mouth wide enough to get much needed dental work done.
this was about 5 weeks ago and since then have seen art for physical therapy, seen their guided imagery specialist to help me with issues that were blocking my healing and have returned to pilates on a weekly basis.
i am hopeful that with the tools i learned here i will continue to improve every day.
i experienced unrelenting pain all over my body, every day, every hour.
i made this decision due to insurance changes and my pain level and was not thinking it through for the long run.
i am living a normal life again in much less pain and with significant improvement with each of my medical problems.
the 5-step functional approach (viewable in the for pts section of our andoaston.comwebsite) i used to help barbara was intended to not miss any of the factors involved in her pain and functional loss, and was actually developed for patients like her.
seeing a dentist, even for cleanings, was torture, landing me in bed for days.
i was a year out from undergoing major surgery to correct hand weakness and arm pain from thoracic outlet syndrome, and was still dealing with problems from previous cervical disk herniation and rotator cuff tear.
i was always tired in the morning.
i was then convinced as a patient that all the ingredients were there for my success.
your facility is clean and bright, and has easy parking arrangements, with a short walk to the entrance, that i truly appreciated when i was in such great pain!
my injuries had caused such excruciating pain that i couldn't always be there for my children when they needed a mother.
she told me i could do biofeedback or surgery.
i was given a brief tour of the gym area which was clean and well spaced out.
