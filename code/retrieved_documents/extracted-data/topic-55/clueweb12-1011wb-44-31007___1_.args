we educate our patients so that they can make educated decisions in regards to their health care and their health care goals.the goal in reconstructive care is to get the structure of the spine to function at its maximum with the least amount of pressure on the nervous system.i've been having a lot of low back pain and have tried painkillers, physical therapy and massage.i have chosen lifetime care for myself and my family and we are healthier because of it.a similar concern is that if you get adjusted a lot, your spine will become "loose" and then you will always need care.we find that the educated patient makes a better patient and always gets better results!in my clinic we do a great deal of education which includes videos, handouts, report of findings and various lectures, to name a few.in conclusion, you only have to keep going to a chiropractor for a long time if it is your choice.none of these "myths" are true and none of them have any research to substantiate them.a good analogy of this type of care is to compare it to braces on teeth, which may take two to five years.if your goal is to simply get out of pain and come in only when it hurts - fine.if your goal is lifetime care for you and your family to keep their nervous systems functioning at their maximum - great.or that too many adjustments will give you arthritis in your spine.you will find a wealth of information that will help you and your family.Â©2009 dr. harvey special offer initial visit & exam $235 value for only $25* *new patients with coupon only.
