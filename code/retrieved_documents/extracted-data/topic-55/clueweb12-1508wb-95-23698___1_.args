it found that therapeutic massage was effective for persistent low back pain in terms of improvement of symptoms and function and that it provided long-lasting benefits.both types of treatment had similar clinical results in terms of pain relief, function and satisfaction in patients with subacute low back pain.thus, despite the need for more high quality research studies to evaluate massage as a main treatment option, it would seem reasonable to include massage in a multi-modal treatment approach for certain types of chronic low back pain conditions.there is moderate evidence for the effectiveness of manipulation for chronic low back pain.it sees the musculoskeletal system as a unified structure that needs all parts functioning well for there to be proper physiology and a chance for an absence of pain.massage therapy was found to be effective in reducing pain, stress hormones, and symptoms associated with chronic low back pain (hernandez-reif, 2001).high quality studies showing strong evidence that manipulation was effective, especially for specific structural conditions.in a randomized study comparing massage therapy and progressive muscle relaxation for chronic low back pain, the massage therapy group reported experiencing less pain, depression, anxiety, improved sleep, improved trunk and pain flexion performance and higher levels of serotonin and dopamine.these therapeutic approaches therefore emphasize treatment of low back pain not just of the low back, but of the spine as a whole.in a 1997 systematic review, strong evidence was found that spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain was better than placebo treatment and moderate evidence that it was better than treatment by a general practitioner, massage, bed rest and analgesics (van tulder, 1997)in a randomized controlled clinical trial of patients with chronic and subchronic low back pain (back pain for at least three weeks but less than six months), osteopathic manual care was compared to standard medical care.to date, the data from scientific trials on the effectiveness of manipulation for acute back pain show it to be an effective therapy (shekelle, 1992).in a systematic review of 81 trials of manipulation for chronic low back pain, however, 25% were high quality studies showing strong evidence that manipulation was effective, especially for specific structural conditions.these modalities all recognize that low back pain is not an isolated pathology (as is the case with many conventional approaches).the focus of chiropractic care is on the nervous system with adjustments of the spinal vertebra to improve joint, nerve and muscle function.
