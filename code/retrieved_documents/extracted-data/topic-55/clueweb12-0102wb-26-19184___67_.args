the usefulness of integrated spect/ct for anatomical and functional assessment of back pain opens promising opportunities both for multi-disciplinary clinical assessment and treatment for manual therapists and for research into the effectiveness of manual therapies.for patients with low back pain in whom manipulation is not contraindicated chiropractic almost certainly confers worthwhile, long term benefit in comparison with hospital outpatient management.this study suggests that chiropractic management administered in an nhs setting may be effective for reducing levels of disability and perceived pain during the period of treatment for a sub-population of patients with chronic low-back pain (clbp).this evidence can guide physicians, payers, and policy makers in evaluating chiropractic as a treatment option for low back pain.the results suggest that chiropractic treatment was safe in these cases and support the hypothesis that it may be effective for reducing pain intensity.physical therapy may be marginally more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the possible benefit is small.for patients with psychological comorbidities, adjunctive analgesics, behavioral therapy, or multidisciplinary rehabilitation also may be appropriate.this study found that chiropractic care is more effective than medical care at treating chronic low-back pain in patients' first year of symptoms.the best available evidence currently suggests that in the absence of serious spinal pathology, nonspinal causes, or progressive or severe neurologic deficits, the management of chronic lbp should focus on patient education, self-care, common analgesics, and back exercises.the detailed clinical outcomes reported in the accompanying paper reinforce these findings by showing that the improvements in health status reported here reflect statistically significant improvements in function, pain, disability, physical and mentalit demonstrated that those treated by chiropractic derive more benefit and long term satisfaction than those treated by hospitals,especially for those who suffered from chronic (or long-term) low back pain!chiropractic care appeared relatively cost-effective for the treatment of chronic lbp.for acute low back pain, this review found insufficient evidence for reaching a conclusion about the cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation.the detailed clinical outcomes reported in the accompanying paper reinforce these findings by showing that the improvements in health status reported here reflect statistically significant improvements in function, pain, disability, physical and mental aspects of quality of life, and beliefs about back pain.a recent 4-year retrospective study of 700,000 health plan members revealed that offering chiropractic services within a managed-care environment could save insurers 27% in back pain episode-related costs!
