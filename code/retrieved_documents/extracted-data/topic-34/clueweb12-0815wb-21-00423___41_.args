unfortunately artificial trees are not biodegradable and cannot be recycled, so their disposal has a significant impact to the environment.due to their hardiness, christmas trees can be planted on barren slopes where few other plants successfully grow, as well as fill in areas under power lines.the raw material for fake christmas trees is both non-renewable and polluting.it is true that these artifical trees would be detrimental to the environment because it isn't biodegradable but perhaps a better way around this problem would be for compaines to start creating their trees with no pvc and use other more organic ways of making christmas trees.the mulch provides a protective barrier for the roots of other plants and vegetation while preventing weeds from growing.in addition to watering, some christmas tree farms use pesticides and chemicals for pest control and to speed growth.furthermore, pvc production results in the unhealthy emission of a number of carcinogens, such as dioxin, ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride.artificial trees do offer a long-term solution for your christmas tree decorating needs.a just released study, the first iso-compliant peer reviewed study of its kind comparing the environmental impact of the most common real christmas tree to the most common artificial tree found that either tree has a negligible impact on the environment.there are many homeless shelters, soup kitchens, halfway houses, public health centers and less fortunate people who would be blessed by having a christmas tree each year, lit with led christmas lights of course- using 90% less energy and lasting alot longer.additionally, in order to make the pvc needles on artificial trees more malleable, the manufacturers use lead and other additives that have been linked to liver, kidney, neurological, and reproductive system damage in lab studies on animals.if disposed of by incineration, the pvc in artificial trees will emit into the atmosphere dioxins and other carcinogens into the air.also,most christmas trees are harvested after 8-12 years and carbon sequestering occurs more rapidly in younger trees.this will help keep some of these artificial tress out of the landfills and will lift some spirits during a holiday season that can be depressing for some.this way your family christmas tree can enjoy a second life... as mulch to help nurture and protect the next generation of trees.
