whether it be to improve personal health, build a sense of community amongst neighbors, be more resource-efficient and earth-friendly or to help feed those that are hungry, it is amazing how growing food can have a positive impact!in addition, american christmas tree farms provide over 500,000 acres of wild life habitat and green space.prior to harvest farmed christmas trees are a carbon sink, harnessing bad greenhouse gasses while producing oxygen at the same time.they offer many advantages when growing ‘green goods’ such as vegetables, herbs or flowers.they are symbolic of the next spring that is sure to come and they promise new-found life and beauty in the days to come.the two key advantages raised beds offer are 1) they can be filled with perfect soil and 2) they provide ideal soil drainage.yes, real christmas trees may be sprayed with pesticides but don’t forget artificial trees put out toxic fumes from the plastic production.i believe this is what motivates gardeners far and wide to plant once again at the close of a growing season.they are 100% biodegradable, recyclable.to the best of my knowledge fake christmas trees are not made out of recyclable plastic so there is no repurposing.however, most christmas tree farms are located in areas like the pacific northwest, pennsylvania, north carolina and michigan where there is ample natural moisture.as elementary as that sounds, it plays a key role in knowing when to harvest edibles.the realization that edible crops have a harvest window based on the rate of their growth and that these plants find a way to get to the flowering stage no matter what, helps understand when it is time to harvest.some type of tree grows most everywhere around the world and they have been around since pre-historic times so i feel they connect us to the earth and to time gone by thousands of years ago.this show is a great place to spend time with gardening friends, learn from the pros and buy some fantastic plants!
