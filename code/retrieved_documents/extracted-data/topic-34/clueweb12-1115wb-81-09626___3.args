first, when we got to the farm, the kind man who greeted us showed us four different types of trees.
i went to the thermostat, which was in the corridor where i had taken the tree earlier that day, and it was 90+ degrees in the house.
i strung it with lights, and the boys added ornaments.
while i very much enjoyed getting the real tree, getting rid of it after the holidays wasn’t as easy.

getting a real christmas tree isn’t just about the tree itself but about the tree-acquiring experience.
i removed the cheap plastic cover and inside where pine needles that had lodged in the shut-off mechanism and weren’t allowing the heater to regulate off and on; it was just running constantly.
it seemed tall at the lot, but compared to our 9 foot artificial tree of years past, it really wasn’t that large.
the farm had a small shop with ornaments for sale, a fire in the fireplace, and hot cocoa.
there was snow all around up there, so it felt very christmas-y to go to the christmas tree farm.
that night, i woke up to an extremely hot house.
so far the boys aren’t too thrilled about going to get a real tree.
it seemed tall at the lot, but compared to our 9 foot artificial tree of years past, it really wasn’t that large.
the first year we lived in an upstairs apartment and once we were done with it we threw it over the balcony to the ground below.
i want the boys to experience a real tree at least once and to see what we think about it as a possible tradition.
i removed the needles and turned on the a/c. i also went outside in the 30-degree weather and left the front door wide open to cool me (and the house) down.
jan the rest of the story … when the boys and i went to get our real christmas tree, it didn’t go exactly as i’d thought.
he then gave me directions around his lot on where i could find the different types, handed me a measuring stick to measure the heights of the trees, and gave me a saw.
the trees come all neatly and tightly bundled and thus pretty easy to get in.
it smelled wonderful, and was kinda nice just to do something new and different.
i hope things will be better once we actually get to the farm, pick our tree, watch it be hacked down, bundled up and bring it in our home.

the dry pine branches and needles were not very gentle to the corridor walls, and the walls were badly scratched.
a friend picked it up and took to his father’s pond.
so no more real trees after that year.
my knees got muddy and my hands were rubbed (a little) raw, but i succeeded in felling the tree and was quite proud of myself for doing a new, hard thing and for (hopefully) impressing the boys.
it’s also such a big hassle to put on all the limbs and fold out each branch.
we all helped drag our tree to the truck.
so i decided to drag it out the front door, which meant i had to take it down a small corridor between the dining room and the front foyer.
but once you cut the cord and the branches poof out, it’s a bigger task to get the treeout.

boys in front of the christmas tree, 2009 i’ve decided to get a real christmas tree this year, rather than put up our fake one.
