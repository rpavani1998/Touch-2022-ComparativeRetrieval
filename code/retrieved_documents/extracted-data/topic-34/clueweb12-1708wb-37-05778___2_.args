this ensures that the trees are utilized for christmas, not thrown in the trash and most importantly replanted in the environment they love.with the roots wrapped in a burlap sack and ample water during the time it is indoors, the trees can be planted quite successfully in most climates.neither are the safest choice and both cause many house fires.if they believed that a live tree in and around the home would bring them good fortune, good health and invite the sun, both physically and metaphorically into their lives; it is good reason to follow ancient wisdom and use live trees for christmas.no matter how many pine-scented candles you leave burning around the home, there is nothing more inviting and comforting than the smell of a freshly cut (or wrapped) live tree adorning the home during christmas.it is a much more worthy cause to pay attention to how much paper just one school throws away in a day or how much junk mail you receive in a month than to worry about the cutting of trees for christmas.there is no waste, greed and the money you spend on your christmas tree can actually be reinvested in your landscaping.certainly, the falling needles can cause a problem in the middle of the living room but there is something reminiscently warm and friendly about the smell of pine and the way real trees always have a slight imperfection that makes them feel homey.each year, millions of trees are dumped and wrapped in plastic bags, which seems to only inflate the greed of the season.legend says that evergreens would help to ward off evil spirits and candles were used to attract the goddess of good fortune.it will sit in a landfill for eons before it finally disintegrates and lord only knows what will happen to the metallic and wires intertwined throughout.as far as safer is concerned, should the lights on the tree spark a flame the plastic tree is going to melt and heat up ten times more quickly than the sappy pine thick with natural moisture.while it is unfortunate and sad to see these trees lying on the curb waiting for the tree pickup, most communities are recycling them and even supplying degradable wraps for the trees so that the whole thing can be used again.the pagans would decorate their homes with wreaths and use fir and pine trees inside their home as a way to celebrate the winter solstice.the winter solstice was known as the return of the sun and the evergreens would remind the pagans that spring and the rebirth of life were just around the corner.
