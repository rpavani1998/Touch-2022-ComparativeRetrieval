think of us as a grocery store for all your basics – milk, vinegar, toothpaste, flour, dishwashing detergent – as well as some “special” things like beer, wine, chicken feed, seeds, etc.
it also doesn’t take any fossil fuel to go and grab the tree from the attic, so it’s definitely an energy-saver.
one of the things i’ve become most excited about in anticipation of thein.gredients store opening: it’ll be so much easier to eat seasonal, local, organic/natural, produce.
the national christmas tree association (ncta) says that real trees, hands-down, are better for the environment.
better yet, you could buy a living tree with roots intact and plant it post-christmas.
christmas trees, which are usually firs or pines, need to be hauled to parts of the country where these species don’t grow.
option: while sausage is traditional in this dish, it can be left out for a delicious vegan soup!
let me clarify – it’ll be easier to eat it because it’ll be easier to find it!
for this caldo verderecipe (from allrecipes.com), you’ll need these veggies from your local farmer: kale, potatoes, onion, and garlic.
a little creativity and thinking out side the box could introduce some new and exciting holiday traditions!
if you’re hungry, go get food.
what’s more, i’ve found that even my favorite small, local grocery stores don’t have a great selection of local and organic produce.
but if you have to go to the bathroom food may need to wait… that is, unless the house is on fire.
but at some point in time, even if it’s 35 years later, that non-recyclable plastic will have to go to a landfill.
as the environment changes, so may the best choice.
you can decrease your likelihood of chowing down on pesticides by using the ewg’s shopper’s guide to pesticides in produce.
if anything changed, a program wasn’t equipped to adapt.

most of the time when we think of “specialty store” we think of a small store offering organic spices and nuts and herbs.
better yet, you could buy a living tree with roots intact and plant it post-christmas.
it’s easy to make, relatively quick, and makes a delicious warm meal for a winter day.
the answer’s pretty complex, with many factors to consider…and it really depends on where you live, so answers will be different for people in different parts of the country.

in its classic model the computer was programmed to make a “choice” given a set of rules that are obeyed.
we want to make it easy for you to find ingredients and easy for you to do things with those ingredients.
fruits and veggies listed in “the dirty dozen” tend to be pretty “chemically” and are best to avoid when they aren’t available as organic.
i think we’re all too familiar with the fact that the vast majority of produce available at most grocery stores isn’t locally sourced (in part due to the constant consumer demand for non-seasonal produce) – something that kind of gets me down.
theenvironmental working group (ewg) says that you should still eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, because their health benefits out-weigh the risk of pesticide exposure.
when we open, you can count on us for delicious, responsibly-raised local eggs!

for a fake tree, this could be tricky.
having lots of yummy fresh eggs is such a wonderful treat, but before you put up your coop, determine whether raising chickens is right for you.
this is great if the computer is, for example, playing chess – it just needs to know the few million possible configurations, play out every game to the end in its head, and choose the move that means it’s most likely to win.
often times, a non-certified organic small farm may be a better environmental steward than a large national organic brand.
aside from farm-fresh veggies, you’ll need some olive oil and linguica sausage.
the most important thing is to do a bit of research, and make your decision based on the facts.
check out “the clean 15″ though, where you’ll find some safer, less contaminated options.
computers are great at solving certain problems – and terrible at solving others.
what’s more, it’s a great way to use leftover roast chicken or turkey!

but at some point in time, even if it’s 35 years later, that non-recyclable plastic will have to go to a landfill.
the absence of one million tons of food scraps “saved 2.7 million cubic yards of landfill space and produced 600,000 cubic yards of finished compost.”
the idea is to simplify grocery shopping.
for example, if you’re hungry, get some food – unless you have to go to the bathroom, and in that case go to the bathroom first.
it will also never deviate from its path even if what it “chooses” doesn’t make sense given the bigger picture.
you could do this by cutting down your own tree near your home, or asking the tree vendor which kind is the most “local.”
as the title of this post says, we’re a “grocery store in scope” and a “convenience store in scale” – meaning we’ll offer a broad selection of food (dairy, meat, produce, breads, household cleaners, …) in a dense, efficient space.
if so, you’ll be delightfully surprised to learn of austin’s the burlap bag (502 west 30th street).
they aren’t really choices, though, because the computer will choose the same way every time.
fake trees can last for decades, which is a great considering nothing is going to waste during its life-span.
however, if you’re not up for such a project, a well-timed trip to thrift store could win you a great tree and the satisfaction that it wont be seeing the landfill this year.
christmas trees, which are usually firs or pines, need to be hauled to parts of the country where these species don’t grow.
but the window of opportunity to get at these farm-fresh goodies will be significantly wider, so no fret if you can’t make it to market day.
most are made of pvc plastic, so they aren’t recyclable.
given this flow, the program will never consider if the house is on fire and will burn up.
that’s a whoppingone million tons of solid waste that’s been spared from the landfill and put to good use rejuvenating local soil as compost.
additionally, the carbon storage feature on real trees is great, but it’s counterproductive if trees are cut down.
