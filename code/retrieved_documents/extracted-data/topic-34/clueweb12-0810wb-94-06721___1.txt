the green christmas tree debate you know its a  trend when it gets its own lobbying group in washington.
real tree advocates claim that encouraging farmers to  grow trees is the healthier sustainable choice and that the combination of  toxic chemicals and energy usage necessary for manufacturing the fake ones  cancels out any possible benefits.
the real trees also have a smaller carbon footprint than ones made with plastic and shipped mostly from factories in china, said stephanie flack, potomac river project director for the nature conservancy.
those racks of trees that magically appear at thanksgiving  on city streets and in suburban malls seem likely to be with us for a long  time.
and at the forefront of the argument is which kind of tree is better for the environment.
but the american christmas tree association would say that freshley’s fake-tree purchase was the greener choice.

fake tree supporters claim they are saving trees and that recycling theirs is better than throwing out fresh ones every year.
even tree huggers are encouraging americans to go out every december and buy a real tree from a lot or go to a farm, cut one down, and drag it home because tree farms are good for the atmosphere artificial trees have been gaining ground in american living rooms — 50 million fake trees vs. 30 million fresh ones.

real fir — along with  pine and spruce — has benefits beyond a fresh smell that says christmas,  supporters say.

the group cites a study to support its view that fake trees have a lower carbon footprint — if consumers hold on to fake trees for six to 10 years — considering the energy it takes to chop, water and transport fresh trees annually.
but at any rate, the group says, most fake trees go back into a box, rather than a street curb for pickup by a truck.

reading the fine print, it does seem that the fake trees' environmental benefits depend on reuse for six to ten years - but no data are yet available on average fake tree longevity.

real trees have other drawbacks: some, such as the fraser fir, are susceptible to a deadly water mold that can infect other trees, according to the sierra club, and nearly all firs are doused with pesticides to kill invasive pests such as the douglas fir beetle.
