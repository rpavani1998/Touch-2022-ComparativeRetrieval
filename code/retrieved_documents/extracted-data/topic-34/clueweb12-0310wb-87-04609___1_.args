plastic trees also can cause more-immediate health problems.they suck carbon dioxide -- a huge contributor to global warming and respiratory disease -- out of the air and turn it into wood.so, by buying a real tree, you're saving the earth, just a little, as well as sustaining what many would call the green heart and soul of christmas.the bigger the tree, the more carbon dioxide the tree scrubs from the atmosphere and the more oxygen it returns.maybe that would reserve agricultural land for food -- or spare the environment from pesticides, herbicides and erosion.in fact, the market for christmas trees means millions are planted each year, each "sequestering" by expert estimates, anywhere from 40 to 300 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.in north carolina, discarded christmas trees are tied to sand dunes to trap sand and slow erosion.because it lasts and lasts, a plastic tree could, in theory, spare more live trees every year it is used.cities and towns around the country recycle trees after christmas by grinding them into garden mulch that they sell -- or give -- back to the folks who discarded the trees in the first place.at the same time, live trees clean up air pollution.they're bundled and sunk into lakes to make a habitat where fingerlings can hide from big predators.christmas-tree farms, he says, are restoring wildlife -- rodents, songbirds, foxes, wild turkeys, birds of prey, bobcats, deer and -- it is rumored -- mountain lions.we've started to see quail coming back where they had disappeared because of habitat loss.the logic: manufacturing and shipping a plastic tree emits a small amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but just once.if forests are falling, it's not because of christmas trees, points out gary chastagner, a washington state university professor of plant pathology who specializes in christmas-tree diseases and post-harvest quality.
