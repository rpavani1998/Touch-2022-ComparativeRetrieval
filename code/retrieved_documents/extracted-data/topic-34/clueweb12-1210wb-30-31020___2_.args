i decided over christmas that it would be more beneficial to me both health and market-wise to replace my few remaining artificial plants with real ones.a lot of plants, like the spider one that i stole from my mom, clean the air.all those "sell this house" type of shows swear that real plants show better, and i know that they're better for the environment.you would think that returning my living room to its pre-christmas glory would be as simple as replacing the fake plants with the real ones.even if i never remember where everything went, i'm sure that i can put my art minor to good use and come up with a new configuration that's equally as pleasing.why is it that after christmas, once your christmas tree has been placed beside the road and the decorations have been safely stowed away in you garage, you can never return your living room to the same decorating state that it was in before?posted by staci at 7:19 pm labels: decorating , home improvement , real estate every place has its decoration, and every decoration has its place, just not after christmas why is it that after christmas, once your christmas tree has been placed beside the road and the decorations have been safely stowed away in you garage, you can never return your living room to the same decorating state that it was in before?posted by staci at  7:19 pm labels: decorating , home improvement , real estate every place has its decoration, and every decoration has its place, just not after christmas why is it that after christmas, once your christmas tree has been placed beside the road and the decorations have been safely stowed away in you garage, you can never return your living room to the same decorating state that it was in before?last night, i attempted to do just that--put everything back where it belongs--and failed miserably.they were formerly in a cactus rock garden, but, seeing as they haven't grown an inch since i got them, i decided that the rocks were doing more harm than good water-wise.in addition, i can't remember for the life of me where this one vase and this one candlestick came from.consequently, i painstakingly dug out the cacti and placed them in several decorative pots wednesday morning.the only thing a plastic plant does is steal its dust.if you have been injured in an accident caused by a tractor trailer, we urge you to contact theatlanta truck accident attorney for a free consultation.however, if my house still hasn't sold by next christmas and i'm still living here, i'm taking a picture before i drag out the first christmas decoration.
