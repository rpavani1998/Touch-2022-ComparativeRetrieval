among the norfolk pine's main downsides as a holiday centerpiece is it's tricky to find one as large as a traditional cut tree, its branches are not as numerous nor dense and it's sensitive to pressure, generally unable to handle too many decorations.strike 2: as a living christmas tree that was supposed to be planted outdoors, it should have never been fertilized -- which i did, unwittingly -- because that risks provoking new growth, awakening the dormant tree, which means it likely won't survive when the time comes to plant it outdoors.but fake trees are made with polyvinyl chloride (or pvc, otherwise known as vinyl), one of the most environmentally offensive forms of non-renewable, petroleum-derived plastic.some might make a case for fake trees, because they are re-used every year and thus don't generate the waste of their real counterparts.according toearthtalk: "... most environmentalists, "tree huggers" among them, would agree that real trees are the better choice, at least from a personal and public health standpoint.my colleague steve nix, about.com's guide to forestry saysseven to ten days is an acceptable time lapse to keep a living christmas tree indoors before putting it outside for eventual planting.i figured environmentalists would root for fake but according toearthtalk: "... most environmentalists, "tree huggers" among them, would agree that real trees are the better choice, at least from a personal and public health standpoint.and christmas lights dry out the norfolk pine quickly, making it require daily misting and moisture checks.even if it can bear the weight, the branches might droop permanently from the overload.yes, there is one conifer that can withstand the rigors of indoor life: the norfolk pine, a subtropical evergreen fromnorfolk island which would quickly expire if youdid put it outside." either way, i'm not thrilled with either option, even though the city of montreal makes good use of discarded christmas trees.above: a norfolk pine, one of the only conifers able to survive as a year-round indoor plant.and according to extension greenhouse and nursery crops specialist dr. leonard perry, you don't need much of a green thumb to handle the cone-bearing norfolk: "if you want to invest in a houseplant with a future, buy a norfolk island pine.notwithstanding that my lovely little evergreen came with zero instructions -- the florist didn't known what species it was either -- i suspect the problem was that it needed to go outside.so last year i bought a living christmas tree.
