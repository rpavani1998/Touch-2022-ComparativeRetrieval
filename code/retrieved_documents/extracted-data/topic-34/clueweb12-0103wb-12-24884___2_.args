i’m confident that sooner, rather than later, consumers will know the truth and know that the eco-friendly choice in christmas trees is a renewable, recyclable real tree grown on a farm.they do indeed produce oxygen, as all plants do, but do not require tons of pesticides.he uses 600 gallons of fuel per year (both diesel and gasoline) to grow 14,000 trees.in it, a fake tree seller is touting the lower fuel consumption required to transport fake trees from asia if you calculate that over 15 years of using the same tree.well, to combat some of the misleading, and sometimes outright false, information that consumers are exposed to, we put together a simple comparison chart.part of the problem is the misleading, and sometimes outright false, information put out there.that equates to 5.5 ounces of fuel per tree per year.that doesn’t take into account the fuel required to ship raw materials such as plastic and metal to the factory in the first place.this is a farm in the deep south, where mowing is probably required more than other places.the main blog contributor is rick dungey, who works as public relations manager for the national christmas tree association.it was manufactured in a factory somewhere, most likely china, then shipped here.of course, it comes in a cardboard box....the hypocrisy is astounding.under the real tree column, in a category called “dirty business” it says “produce oxygen, but require tons of pesticides and herbicides.”you are welcome to send responses or questions to the blog, but be aware that not all posts will be made public and all will be reviewed prior to posting.that represents about 10 percent of the nation’s total oil consumption.
