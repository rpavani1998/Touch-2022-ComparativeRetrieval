christmas tree farms keep land into forest use that might otherwise be converted to development.artificial trees are environmentally sound, most real trees go into landfills – in an average 15 year life span of a fake christmas tree – the real tree user will put about 1/2 ton of waste in a landfill – land fill waste is not compost.learn about the potential health and environmental consequences of both real and fake christmas trees, and a third alternative that just may offer a more eco-friendly answer.they can be reused as erosion control in gullies, sunk in ponds as fish habitat, composted for your garden, placed in the woods or fields as a wildlife brush pile.we have cats who are constantly bothering the tree and, so far, they do not appear to have any resulting health problems.the income they generate for the grower y can keep a farm operation viable, so the farmer can remain in farming.they sequester carbon and create oxygen while growing.pine decomposes very fast and it takes a number of years for a seedling to become a six foot tree.even the old ratty looking tree has been picked up by someone who can’t afford a tree in the first place so it gets an extra chance with a new family.i prefer the look of a real christmas tree’s in my house but it can be a pain when bits fall of and also disposing of them isnt that easy, having a fake tree is better but they just dont seem to have that christmas feel about them.gifts are rarely under our tree because we put decorative things like trains or villages there.many public landfills now compost them.i think fake trees are better than real trees because thay last 4 longer and do not make land waste.real christmas trees are very versitle.photo courtesy of paul anderson i am stuck with artificial trees because of allergies.
