i’m confident that sooner, rather than later, consumers will know the truth and know that the eco-friendly choice in christmas trees is a renewable, recyclable real tree grown on a farm.
that doesn’t take into account the fuel required to ship raw materials such as plastic and metal to the factory in the first place.
of course, it comes in a cardboard box....the hypocrisy is astounding.
well, to combat some of the misleading, and sometimes outright false,  information that consumers are exposed to, we put together a simple comparison  chart.

quite frankly, it befuddles me that there is still a “debate” at all and that there are consumers out there who still think a manufactured product is better for the environment than a natural product.

when to buy a real tree real tree care white house tree; grand champions here’s the best example, an article from the hays daily news in  hays, kansas.
now that second part is a totally false statement.
a recent article in spirit magazine said the u.s. uses 2 million barrels  of oil every day to make plastic.
no source is cited, and phone calls to ms. perry went unreturned.
’s packaging: “better for the environment because no tree has to be cut down.”

recently a christmas tree  farmer calculated fuel use to grow his trees.
that equates to 5.5 ounces of fuel per tree per year.
part of the problem is the misleading, and sometimes outright false, information put out there.
nor does it take into account the energy consumed by the factory itself.
a recent article in spirit magazine said the u.s. uses 2 million barrels of oil every day to make plastic.
that doesn’t take into account the fuel required to  ship raw materials such as plastic and metal to the factory in the first place.
here’s the best example, an article from the hays daily news in hays, kansas.
in it, a  fake tree seller is touting the lower fuel consumption required to transport  fake trees from asia if you calculate that over 15 years of using the same  tree.
plastic is a product we all use, but many believe will need to be replaced soon.
the author is celia perry.
he uses 600 gallons  of fuel per year (both diesel and gasoline) to grow 14,000 trees.
please try to use an obvious phrase in the subject line, such as "christmas tree question" or "blog topic."

they do indeed produce oxygen, as all plants do, but do not require tons of pesticides.

it was manufactured in a factory somewhere, most likely china, then shipped here.
nor  does it take into account the fuel consumed to distribute the product from  shipping ports to retail outlets throughout the u.s.

keep the questions coming...next week we’ll start posting consumer  emails and answers.
this is a farm in the deep south, where mowing is probably required more than other places.
here’s another example: in the november/december issue of mother jones magazine, there’s a chart comparing real trees and fake trees.
mother jones’ tagline says “smart, fearless journalism”....really?
that equates  to 5.5 ounces of fuel per tree per year.
the rant subject is the “debate” over whether a fake tree is a better eco-choice than a real tree.
other people on  the ncta staff and members of ncta will also contribute posts.

under the real tree column, in a category called “dirty business” it says “produce oxygen, but require tons of pesticides and herbicides.”
