many people who purchase fake christmas trees do so because they believe that cutting down real trees is bad for the environment.even if you would use one for 20 years or more, it will eventually be thrown away and end up in a landfill, unlike real trees, which are biodegradable and recyclable.gary chastagner, professor of plant pathology at washington state university's puyallup research and extension center, attributes this to the good growing sites, moderate temperatures, good rain fall and a good grower-knowledge base that produces good quality trees in the northwest.the national christmas tree association also stresses how the use of real christmas trees is actually better for the environment than fake trees.according to the pacific northwest christmas tree association, 92 percent of all northwest harvested christmas trees are exported out of the region and around the world, with 47 percent going to california." chastagner's christmas tree research focuses on disease problems that affect the production of high quality christmas trees and how to manage them, as well as post harvest quality."there is natural reseeding of trees in forests and permits are given out to cut down christmas trees in areas that need to be thinned."in order to keep your cut christmas trees fresh and have the longest needle retention possible, chastagner said the "single most important thing to do is to re-cut the base of the tree and display in a water tree stand that holds one gallon of water per one inch of stem diameter."calcium builds strong bones, good teethâ€”and healthy plants, according to a new study from washington state university.if properly taken care of, a douglas fir can live and retain its needles three weeks and noble fir can last for four to six weeks.in fight against pathogens, calcium helps plants make their own aspirinit's that time of year again, the stores are flooded with holiday decorations, the street corners are lined with christmas trees for sale and many people are torn with the decision to decorate a real or fake tree this year.calcium builds strong bones, good teethand healthy plants, according to a new study from washington state university.experiments show that calcium, when bound to a protein called calmodulin, prompts plants to make salicylic acid (sa) when threatened by infection or other danger.scientists at wsus tree fruit research and extension center in wenatchee are working to learn more about these beneficial bugs in an effort to better leverage them in pest control.
