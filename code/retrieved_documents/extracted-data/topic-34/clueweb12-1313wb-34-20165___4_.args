for one a lot of people enjoy the smell of a real tree or there is some long family tradition behind getting one.to me fake trees are just easier to maintain, but i do get why people prefer real trees.when i was in college and couldn't be home in time to help, my parents switched to a fake tree.maybe if i hit the lottery, i'll pay someone to put up a real and an artificial tree sometime just for the memories.we had to get douglas fir and they weren't always easy to find and expensive.so of course people like to keep those memories fresh and a live so they keep on with the tradition.if you want the experience of a real tree stick withÂ  your fake tree and light a pine candle.. then you will miss out on all the bugs and vacuuming all the needles which fall everyday.if you want the experience of a real tree stick with your fake tree and light a pine candle.. then you will miss out on all the bugs and vacuuming all the needles which fall everyday.however since i've never had a tradition of going out and cutting a tree down for christmas i don't really care for one.-it's good to be able to haul it up in pieces if you can't get someone to help you.the branches i believe are heavier with a fake tree.plus they can become a real mess, especially when they are dying.a bunch of the hallmark ornaments were just too heavy for the real tree.so they keep on with the tradition.i always had real trees growing up.
