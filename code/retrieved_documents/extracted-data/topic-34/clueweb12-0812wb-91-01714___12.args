it was nice to have the fresh cut tree in the house, but i would never go back.

i would defiantly go with a real tree that is a recyclable and a positive contribution to the environment over a tree made from harmful chemicals that is not able to be recycled.
besides the heavy use of toxic pesticides , they are fairly devoid of wildlife as they encompass acres and acres of land comprised of a single species.

given the current economic climate, artificial trees may be especially appealing for their investment value when compared with the recurrent, annual expense of a real christmas tree.

a single farmed tree absorbs more than 1 ton of co2 throughout its lifetime.
plant it & enjoy it everyday of the year.

though not feasible for everybody due to climate and land availability, living trees are brought into the home for about 10 days, then replanted after christmas.
it looks really cool.
the creation of … poetree planter offers green burial alternative it might be a dark subject, but looking on the bright side, the process of death is actually a green one.
their convenience is also appealing to consumers as they don’t need watering, don’t leave pine needles all over the floor and transportation from tree farm to home isn’t an issue.
and diesel trucks transporting tons of trees in order to sell and later to recycle, and later to sell the mulch are doing as much harm as the transportation of artificial ones.
they can be used for beachfronterosion prevention, lake and river shoreline stabilization and fish and wildlife habitat.
think of it this way, we “absorb” oxygen and exhale co2—that doesn’t mean we store it, or that it adds to our weight or that we suddenly release it all into the atmosphere when we expire.
lastly, its not clear to me which has a bigger impact: shipping a lighter plastic tree via cargo ship from china to houston (which has a port), or shipping a heavier, real tree from oregon to houston by diesel truck.
it was nice to have the fresh cut tree in the house, but i would never go back.
an even better option go one step further than the real versus artificial debate and consider a living, potted tree this christmas.
the ideal tree would be raised organically, using integrated pest management techniques rather than chemicals.
given the current economic climate, artificial trees may be especially appealing for their investment value when compared with the recurrent, annual expense of a real christmas tree.
furthermore, approximately 85 percent of artificial trees sold in the u.s. are imported fromchina, according to the national christmas tree association (ncta), adding to their overall environmental footprint.
treecycling is an easy way to return a renewable and natural source back to the environment instead of disposing it in a landfill, where decomposition rates are slowed due to lack of oxygen.

i genuinely think that artificial trees are the way forward and considering they are so maintenance free, i’m surprised not everyone has caught on to how good they really are.

i love the look and smell of a real tree, but i have cats.
until, i allowed others to influence me into purchasing an artificial tree which went against my good judgment.
