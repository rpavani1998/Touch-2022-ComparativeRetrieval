however since i've never had a tradition of going out and cutting a  tree down for christmas i don't really care for one.
our dog would have to be  stopped from drinking the water, like dan's.
we didn't cut them ourselves, but went to a tree farm.
so of course people like to keep those memories fresh and a live

and i wouldn't have it any other way.
what does everyone else get in terms of a tree?
real or fake: i've always had a fake tree for christmas, from when i was little to now and i wouldn't have it any other way.
for one a lot of people enjoy the smell of a real tree or there is some long family tradition behind getting one.
plus they can become a  real mess, especially when they are dying.
we had to get douglas fir and they weren't always easy to find and expensive.
a bunch of the hallmark ornaments were just too heavy for the real tree.
lol those are good memories, but
to me fake trees are just easier to maintain, but i do get why people prefer real trees.
so they keep on with the tradition.
at first it bugged me.
vacuuming  needles everyday 4.)
having to wrap the tree in a bag and drag is down  stairs or out a door to the trash.
i  really never had it any other way.
we  didn't cut them ourselves, but went to a tree farm.
it was a family tradition to freeze, though, and haul the sucker home, etc.
after a few years, though, i got used to it  and started liking it.
-no dropping  needles through the house as you bag it and try to haul it away.

plus they can become a real mess, especially when they are dying.
-it's good to be able to haul it up in pieces if you can't get someone to help you.
who knows though maybe one day i'll  start getting a real tree, like when i have my very own nagging kids.

if you want the  experience of a real tree stick with  your fake tree and light a pine  candle.. then you will miss out on all the bugs and vacuuming all the needles  which fall everyday.
so, when i get nostalgic, i just think of all that.

it was a challenge because my dad was allergic to most of them.
the branches i believe are heavier with a fake tree.
