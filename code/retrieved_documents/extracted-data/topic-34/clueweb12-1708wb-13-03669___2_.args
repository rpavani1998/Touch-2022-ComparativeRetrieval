additionally, the christmas tree business ensures that around 500 million trees are safe and growing annually, which is extremely environmentally friendly.fake christmas trees also include a healthy dose of lead in the manufacturing process which can make them a health hazard in the home.real trees are produced through farming, which is environmentally friendly as opposed to factory manufacturing, which produces harmful emissions into the atmosphere.while it is true that most farmers do use some pesticides to keep the trees healthy, scientists have found that the run-of and waste material from the production of fake trees is 90 times worse than the chemicals used on live tree farm.when you consider how many trees are grown for the sole purpose of farming for christmas, experts believe that live christmas trees actually sustain the environment, whereas the factories that produce the fake christmas trees take away from the environment.considering the fact that the us and canada purchase more trees than any other country in the world, it only make sense that we should capitalize on our own purchases.- while it is true that most farmers do use some pesticides to keep the trees healthy, scientists have found that the run-of and waste material from the production of fake trees is 90 times worse than the chemicals used on live tree farm.- real trees are produced through farming, which is environmentally friendly as opposed to factory manufacturing, which produces harmful emissions into the atmosphere.in fact, according to the national christmas tree association the debate should be over because their research and findings is in defense of live/real christmas trees for the holiday season as an environmentally friendly option.it is estimated that because of christmas tree production around 45 million trees are planted each and every year in the united states and canada alone.on the contrary, the plastic tree in your living room is constantly dispersing dioxins into the air in your home – which has been found to be one of the most dangerous cancer causing compounds known to man and animals.not only do farmers replant trees annually, but they are making richer soils with their farming techniques.in fact, research has proven over and over again that when it comes to your christmas tree, the healthy choice – the smart choice, is a live one.interestingly, live trees absorb carbon dioxide and release these essential elements into the soil when they decompose.plus, in 2010, a panel of scientists that tested nearly 5,000 trees harvested in the united states and canada, found that the trees themselves did not have any trace amounts of chemicals on the trees consumers were buying.
