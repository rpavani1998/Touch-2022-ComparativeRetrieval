getting a real christmas tree isn’t just about the tree itself but about the tree-acquiring experience.i want the boys to experience a real tree at least once and to see what we think about it as a possible tradition.i hope things will be better once we actually get to the farm, pick our tree, watch it be hacked down, bundled up and bring it in our home.the trees come all neatly and tightly bundled and thus pretty easy to get in.it smelled wonderful, and was kinda nice just to do something new and different.there was snow all around up there, so it felt very christmas-y to go to the christmas tree farm.it’s also such a big hassle to put on all the limbs and fold out each branch.the farm had a small shop with ornaments for sale, a fire in the fireplace, and hot cocoa.i went to the thermostat, which was in the corridor where i had taken the tree earlier that day, and it was 90+ degrees in the house.he then gave me directions around his lot on where i could find the different types, handed me a measuring stick to measure the heights of the trees, and gave me a saw.first, when we got to the farm, the kind man who greeted us showed us four different types of trees.it seemed tall at the lot, but compared to our 9 foot artificial tree of years past, it really wasn’t that large.while i very much enjoyed getting the real tree, getting rid of it after the holidays wasn’t as easy.the first year we lived in an upstairs apartment and once we were done with it we threw it over the balcony to the ground below.i strung it with lights, and the boys added ornaments.
