there is also a real chance it could lead to discrimination, assault, abuse, isolation and in some circumstances, self harm and/or suicide.any of the above using their real name online could have severe ramifications on future employment, housing opportunites and quality of life.much like the internet filter, it's an idea that would only block innocents from innocent content; those who want to circumvent the system will do so with ease.google’s reliance on automating these decisions is bound to lead to indiscriminate mistakes.governments and services will argue that using a real name policy will help cut down spam,internet trolling) and general bad behaviour.the issue quickly escalates to one of suppression of free speech and, as such, makes its enforcement one more example of companies trying to create an internet that is, in essence, simply commercial.our goal is to ensure the content is not compromised in any way.at the end of the day, however futile this opinion may be, companies such as google and facebook need to understand that an individuals health, wellbeing and safety is more important than business and financial gain.in these days where potential employers/clients check your facebook before your resume, online anonymity is the only way to maintain a separation between one's private and professional lives.given this can then lead to an automatic suspension of your email account with no warning, the consequences are severe.theconversation, from what i understand, is largely reliant on people being upfront about their identity, their credibility and any conflicts of interest they may have.we therefore ask all authors to disclose any potential conflicts of interest before publication.this means any name google has determined is not the person’s real name has resulted in an automatic suspension.exactly how many users have been affected by this action is not known but it is enough to have mobilised google+ users to voice their displeasure.if the internet is a human right than everyone has the right to shield their identity should they choose to.
