similar to most environmental story plots, this one has a good environmentalist, the lorax, that holds the moral high ground and a bad, greedy, profit mongering, capitalist, the oncelor.
the world of zero transaction costs is a fiction—but a sometimes useful fiction, not unlike a vacuum in physics.
this conservation ethic has the power to enhance resource stewardship and environmental quality.
in this story the oncelor produces thneeds that appear to be in high demand.
the resilience of nature is recognized with an understanding that some places are more fragile than others.
at seasons end, real trees can be recycled and used for making everything from mulch to medicines, or to enhance wildlife habitat and prevent erosion.
the very possibility that the “victims” of pollution should bribe the factory owners to reduce their pollution levels is anathema to many.
yandle: there are success stories in both camps.
my direct link into questions of the environment as we think of it narrowly –water, air — was a colleague i became associated with at clemson by the name of hugh macaulay.
so there are wonderful success stories there.
it starts in the financial sector, where the benefits of bankers’ actions are often and almost entirely privatized: they pocket the bonus if the bet pays off.
he sees a global landscape that has been touched by humans.
they are, i would say, hampered inasmuch as they are promoting it within the context of technology-based, systems-approach standards based on inputs, and that’s because of the statutes under which they operate.
what coase showed was that, in the world of neoclassical economics, government regulation was unnecessary for an efficient resolution of social cost problems.
coase is not about the coase theorem; he was a strong advocate of comparative institutional analysis and that, at a minimum, economic benefits and costs have an important role to play in evaluating policy options.
a billion dollar industry, supporting more than 14,000 jobs, exotic ranches have worked to bolster the populations of approximately 125 different endangered species.
if you want to understand the fundamentals of environmental problems look at the property rights and follow the incentives.
but value judgments often get in the way of sound reasoning when it comes to things like externalities, so not everyone has gotten on board with coase’s notion of reciprocity.
in reality, it turns out, we all get a steady stream of free passes.
so, pigovian remedies are unnecessary in a pigovian (costless transacting) world.
alternatively, you can buy a fake tree that is probably made in china.
the incentive-based framework will complement other efforts in the region to keep the eastern population of the gopher tortoise off the endangered species list.”
the process approach is by far the oldest because common law is a process approach where there are rules of property, rules of liability, rules with respect to pollution that have been around for centuries, so that one cannot impose costs on his neighbor without your neighbor’s permission, or your neighbor has a cause of action against you.
industry and profit are not necessarily bad and harmful to the environment.
he also believes that “there do not seem to be any serious problems with the nonrenewable resources.”
the first is that markets/exchangecan work to resolve certain social cost issues.
frank takes a very simple game theory used to explain the arms race (and naively applies it to elk antlers, arguing that one elk grows big antlers and gets all the cows so that others must also grow such big ones to compete), applies it to market competition, and concludes that competition can lead to bad things for the group as a whole.
christmas tree plantations cover 350,000 acres of land in the us and are growing about 350 million trees.
a: probably because coase focused so heavily on efficiency.
a: the coase theorem tells us that if property rights over the relevant resources are well-defined and the costs of transacting are zero, parties who disagree over the use of those resources will negotiate to an efficient solution, regardless of to whom the property rights are assigned.
in the case of elk, he claims that large elk antlers make elk as a species worse off because the antlers make it difficult for the bull elk to run through the woods and therefore more susceptible to wolf predation; obviously he has never seen a bull lay his head back so that the antlers are tucked neatly against his back and ribs and run through the thickest trees; never seen a bull use the antlers for defense against wolves; and doesn’t ask how it is that elk are thriving by moving to more open spaces in the presence of wolves–spaces which they occupied before human pressure moved them to the mountains.
i have not yet seen “the lorax” movie but will think about how the storyline may differ given well specified property rights when i do.
in africa, private land owners are protecting rhinos from poaching; in the caribbean an alumnus of perc’s enviropreneur institute (pei) is working to help replant and regenerate dying coral reefs; and in the gulf of mexico, the environmental defense fund has joined perc in campaigning for property rights solutions to overfishing.
q: critics of coase often contend that transaction costs in markets are too high for coasian-type bargaining to occur: negotiations can be costly, multiple parties can be affected, and information is diffuse.
if property rights are assigned over the resources in question and there are no costs of transacting, the parties will efficiently resolve the problem through negotiation.
this, in the end, is also lost because the oncelor puts himself out of business by extricating every last truffala tree which are a needed input for thneed production.
no data, no theory, no knowledge of wild species, but lots of rhetorical arguments.
moore sees the forest and the trees that provide habitat, ecosystem services, and wood products.
a: probably because coase focused so heavily on efficiency.
i do care about the environment, both near and far.
if you would like to learn more about market-based approaches for conservation, such as the approach gartner began formulating as a perc enviropreneur fellow, thenapply to perc’s enviropreneur institute by march 5.
that is, if a is generating smoke that harms b, b may be said to be as much the “cause” of the harm as a, since b could mitigate damages by, e.g., moving away.
at common law, people downstream hold property rights to water quality and people upstream cannot destroy that with impunity.
the first is that markets/exchangecan work to resolve certain social cost issues.
see coase as important because he emphasized that social cost problems are ultimately problems related to incomplete property rights.
the funds collected from hunting a small percentage of the endangered animals gives ranchers the money they need to continue to run their ranches.
finally, frank argues that taxes can fix the problems–and yes, of course, most importantly the problem of global warming.
read terry anderson and shawn regan’s article, “shoot an elephant, save a community,” to see how assigning economic value to animals in africa is also working to conserve wildlife.
how smart economics can save the world, and is an economist at the environmental defense fund.
trees are renewable and through proper forest management we can harvest timber while enhancing environmental quality.
a live tree means removing a tree from the forest, or tree plantation, as it may be.
one can only come to grips with these things on a case-by-case basis, weighing the benefits and costs associated with alternative courses of action and recognizing that both markets/exchange and government activity have associated with them certain costs—often substantial.
the scimitar horned oryx, the addax, the dama gazelle – endangered animals one would expect to encounter in africa.
we are all a part of nature and nature will be as we steward it.
it is time for conservationists from all walks to shed old paradigms of doom and gloom and look at the world as it really is.
wagner points out that it has become acceptable to say that markets don’t work, just look at “the demise of lehman brothers and the subsequent swoon of the global economy.”
coase is not about the coase theorem; he was a strong advocate of comparative institutional analysis and that, at a minimum, economic benefits and costs have an important role to play in evaluating policy options.
during production he clear cuts every last trufulla tree, smogs the air, and clogs the water.
thus, greenfaith has used lessons garnered from pei to attract new congregations to their certification program by touting the benefits of financial savings, as well as engaging new and younger members.
the upshot of the theorem is that private negotiations or other market-like processes can efficiently resolve social cost (“externality”) problems such as those associated with air and water pollution.
there are some wonderful success stories: epa is now promoting process with respect to river basin management approaches for water quality and we’ve got some pretty interesting success stories going on there.
they are an aggregator of wishes and desires, however misguided they may be.
the world of zero transaction costs is a fiction—but a sometimes useful fiction, not unlike a vacuum in physics.
the evaluation of how society should deal with such problems thus involves a comparison of the benefits and costs of alternative courses of action—including the possibility of allowing the problem to persist if the costs of “curing” it are worse than the disease itself.
the major force driving greenfaith’s success, therefore, has not been morals, but the promise of growth – and this strategy is having success.
if you want to change behavior, change the incentives.
but the costs are socialized: bankers pay but a tiny fraction of the costs of their failed bets; society pays.
now is the moment when improving the environment by utilizing property rights and markets rather than big government can truly benefit america as the nation works to deal with its fiscal crisis.
lomborg concludes that we are living in a healthier, wealthier, and cleaner environment than ever before thanks to human innovation.
your tax-deductible gift will help fund innovative research, convene conferences, publish the results inperc reports and other venues, and add to the growing number of environmentalists implementing perc’s ideas.
although some regions are better cared for than others, there are more reasons for optimism than pessimism.
he was disturbed by the misinformation that was being disseminated and the unwillingness of organization leaders to compromise to work toward realistic solutions.
they do so not to prove their conservation ethic, rather as an investment in timber for future production.
a bit of green pr doesn’t hurt, either.
stiff regulations can make forests a liability by decreasing permissible harvest and increasing management costs.
this makes coase’s analysis the natural starting point for the analysis of social cost issues.
a: the coase theorem tells us that if property rights over the relevant resources are well-defined and the costs of transacting are zero, parties who disagree over the use of those resources will negotiate to an efficient solution, regardless of to whom the property rights are assigned.
i purchased the darwin economy: liberty, competition, and the common good by robert frank thinking i would learn something.
no data, no theory, no knowledge of wild species, but lots of rhetorical arguments.
there are transaction-cost problems and enforcement-cost problems that lead to situations where people will understandably develop a systems approach.
few know more about the legendary economist and his impact on economic thought thansteven medema.
problems such as those associated with air and water pollution.
the list of movie sponsors is a bit surprising, to say the least.
“in short, the best way to reduce the carbon footprint of agricultural production is to produce food where it can be done most efficiently and to engage in international trade.
the gopher tortoise conservation marketplace is testing a new strategy, which provides financial incentives to private landowners who manage their woodlands for habitat and candidate species.
so when i joined that faculty, there was a senior faculty member who was working on this.
if property rights are assigned over the resources in question and there are no costs of transacting, the parties will efficiently resolve the problem through negotiation.
in a process approach, you identify goals and outcomes, develop some rules of the game, and then let the process take hold, holding accountability with respect to outcome.
unfortunately, too many economists and policy makers do not want to hear such things.
a: my sense is that most environmental economists see coase as important because he emphasized that social cost problems are ultimately problems related to incomplete property rights.
they are even used as biomass to create energy.
this is no doubt often the case, yet transaction costs are also present in the political process.
a: my sense is that, at a minimum, he impressed upon some that social cost problems, or externalities, are reciprocal in nature.

similar to lomborg and moore, peter kareiva puts humans at the center of conservation.
so, pigovian remedies are unnecessary in a pigovian (costless transacting) world.
abject opposition to logging is one case in point.
but by showing how property-rights-based solutions can generate private, efficiency-enhancing moves, the theorem opened the door to the subsequent analysis of exchange solutions in the real world, and thus to both theories and policies that employ such a framework.
few know more about the legendary economist and his impact on economic thought thansteven medema.
the second is that neither markets nor government are panaceas.
weyerhaeuser, for example, is proud to announce that they plant millions of trees every year.
but by showing how property-rights-based solutions can generate private, efficiency-enhancing moves, the theorem opened the door to the subsequent analysis of exchange solutions in the real world, and thus to both theories and policies that employ such a framework.
environmental problems are the result of conflicting demands on resources.

i learned that i should not have purchased it.
as this 60 minutes segment shows, by allowing a number of these animals to be hunted for a high price, exotic wildlife ranches have achieved a major feat in wildlife conservation.
they can be cut into firewood and burned for home heat or as the centerpiece for your next weenie roast.
a: i think that its central impact has been in the way of making scholars—and later policy makers—aware of the possibility of using the exchange process to deal with social cost issues.
the next time you hear someone say this, you can tell them they’re wrong for two reasons: lehman brothers is more asymptom of what happened rather than the underlying cause, and it was guided by much larger forces than itself.
though humans have touched nearly every place on earth, our increased prosperity has brought enhanced environmental quality.
the rub comes in where one goes from there.
the new paradigm acknowledges humans as an important part of nature and is grounded in a realistic view of the state of the world.
save your money, and if you get a complimentary copy, save your time by not reading it.

regardless, forest service permits to harvest a tree are issued to help manage the forest under agency guidelines.
to clear up some of the confusion, we talked with steven medema for the next installment of perc’s q&a series.
artificial trees are not biodegradable, nor are they a good fuel source.
then epa says, ok, members of this watershed community, tell us how you would like to achieve that goal.
that is, somehow we all survived until the 1970s without having a systems approach imposed from the top for the environment in a consistent way.
he believes that both protected forests and managed forests involve human action, which can enhance the benefits provided to society.
the upshot of the theorem is that private negotiations or other market-like processes can efficiently resolve social cost (“externality”)

first, it takes two to tango.
but value judgments often get in the way of sound reasoning when it comes to things like externalities, so not everyone has gotten on board with coase’s notion of reciprocity.
thus, hunting endangered species in texas has provided economic incentives for ranchers to continue to conserve and protect the species.
i just have to change the names on the axes from “housing” to “water,” then i’ve got my model.
a: i think that its central impact has been in the way of making scholars—and later policy makers—aware of the possibility of using the exchange process to deal with social cost issues.
given well specified rights, negotiation will motivate the highest valued resource use.
our christmas tree harvesting activities result in growing more trees, not less.
frank takes a very simple game theory used to explain the arms race (and naively applies it to elk antlers, arguing that one elk grows big antlers and gets all the cows so that others must also grow such big ones to compete), applies it to market competition, and concludes that competition can lead to bad things for the group as a whole.
fossil fuel subsidies and various other loopholes and distortions make the playing field uneven.
we have gotten to the point now where the epa is identifying maximum loads that can be imposed on a stream; that’s an outcome.
yet, as some texas ranches are proving, helping to bring back large numbers of these endangered species can be a profitable pastime.
the only conservation that makes sense to kareiva is one that considers human needs and desires.
this makes coase’s analysis the natural starting point for the analysis of social cost issues.
the evaluation of how society should deal with such problems thus involves a comparison of the benefits and costs of alternative courses of action—including the possibility of allowing the problem to persist if the costs of “curing” it are worse than the disease itself.
given ownership, however, the oncelor is more likely to invest in future trees to ensure the possibility of future production.
as you can imagine, the motivator of many of these sponsors is not just good green ethics as much as good for the bottom line.
to clear up some of the confusion, we talked with steven medema for the next installment of perc’s q&a series.
