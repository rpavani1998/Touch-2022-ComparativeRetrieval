by leaving wildflowers and field buffers throughout the christmas trees and horse pastures, we provide habitat for all sorts of creatures.as arthur sower with the us forest service wrote in 1949,  "...there is no reason why the joy associated with the christmas evergreen may not be a means of arousing in the minds of children an appreciation of the beauty and usefulness of trees; and keen appreciation of the beauty and usefulness of trees is a long step toward the will to plant and care for them.after all, the christmas tree reminds us in the dead of winter of the beauty of nature and life.it is a chain of recreational areas, offering motorists a spot to picnic in the woods, a place to sleep overnight in a campground or a charming lodge, as well as opportunities to refuel their vehicle, enjoy a meal, or purchase a piece of fine regional handiwork.it's role as the center of the christmas festivities makes it a part of the family.it is a series of parks providing the visitor access to high mountain passes, splendid natural “gardens” of flowering mountain plants, waterfalls and water gaps, deep forests and upland meadows.another will be planted in its place to provide a home for butterfly and bird.it never provided a perch for a bird or had a butterfly rest on its branches.we are so blessed to live in such a diverse and beautiful place!we travel with our parents, hike the boulder and waterfall trails with our ten year old twin boys and chase or 2 year old little girl across the meadows at doughton park where we often fly kites in the spring and summer.it's ok to use a real tree to wait for santa on christmas eve.the scent of it -- the feel of it -- can not be compared to plastic.it is a “museum of the managed american countryside,” preserving the rough-hewn log cabin of the mountain pioneer, the summer home of a textile magnate, and traces of early industries, such as logging railways and an old canal.it is an elongated park, protecting significant mountain landscapes far beyond the shoulders of the road itself.the old tree will be recycled.
