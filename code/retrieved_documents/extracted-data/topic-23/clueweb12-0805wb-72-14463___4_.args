yahoo is a bit like my mother, not with plants but with growing profitable businesses.the sale of kelkoo proves once again that yahoo doesn’t integrate its acquisitions in the manner of google.navigate to yahoo.com, click the “shopping” label above the search box, and you will see the bold face “shopping” to alert you that you are now running a shopping search.i am not sure why the yahoo system does not do a better job of figuring out what i want when i run a query.frankly i am tired of yahoo technologists telling me that yahoo’s engineering is as good or better than google’s.not only does yahoo have the uncanny ability to muff its acquisitions, yahoo can’t find penguin bracelets.i use yahoo less and less because it’s search system continues to unhelpful for me.yahoo can own a property for four years and sell it like i would sell one of my goslings.well, i got this page of results: now navigate to google, click products, and run the same query.here’s what i received from the goog: i know these screen shots are difficult to read due to wordpress’s helpful image compression algorithm.i can, however, buy a pink penguin bracelet, a gold penguin bracelet, and silver blue gray penguin bracelet from google.google, despite its weird positioning of google products is getting better.i can’t relate to black thumbs, and it is a fact that i can’t buy a penguin bracelet via the yahoo shopping search system.i read in techcrunch a story by ouriel ohayonhere that yahoo sold its kelkoo property.stephen arnold, november 22, 2008 written by stephen e. arnold · filed under business strategy, news, online (general), search, yahoo comments are closed.
