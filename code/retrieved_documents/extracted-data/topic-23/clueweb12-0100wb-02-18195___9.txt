having two good search engines to choose from makes searching that  much better for everyone.
google gave me 7 stores and 3 charitable organizations (one of which was a  store as well).
google has a lot more diversity.
the content provided in  this article is not warranted or guaranteed by developer shed, inc.
there were 3 music resource sites (but no  magazines), one downloading program, one cd store, one radio station (yahoo  radio), one music directory, and the 10th result was an audio player program  site.
google had some lower quality sites, but the information was just as good even though they did seem less professional.
so even though i didn't necessarily want the latest news about what a charity did regarding mosquito nets, i think getting the same site twice from yahoo (not to mention the search result page) is the bigger
information about music from different sources such as magazine, tv and other music news sites are found 6 times in the top 10 results.

it also makes marketing better.
google also had 2 sites in its top ten that were of no value whatsoever; mp3.com which just has one page stating that they no longer offer the services that they used to (with links to their parent company), and music.com, which is nothing more than an email gathering site for a newsletter (not a single link on the entire page).
which search engine is better?
what i got was a lot of "how to find a doctor" sites, with a lot of good information.

the other results were a search result page (not a good result) and an inner page from a previous result (also not a good result).
in less than twenty-four hours, google went from about 79% of the market  share to about 51%, almost overnight.
now there will be more stability; if  you drop in google today, your hits from yahoo will remain consistent.
maybe they took parts and ideas from all the search engines they bought - maybe they even took the best parts - , but whatever they did, the result is something completely new.
the only differences were sites by actual realtors and sites that were simply property listings.
this one goes to google.

mosquito nets it seems to me that someone searching for "mosquito nets" wants either a) to buy them, or b) to learn about them, so i was expecting to find either stores or information about mosquito nets.
google gave me 4 good informational sites, 2 good "find a doctor" sites, one recent article about liposuction for people in the industry, one site with very poor information one written by a single doctor and one site that was nothing more than a directory.
the only way this could have been worse is if yahoo's results sucked, and they don't.

so google has 5 spam sites, and yahoo has 3 and a half.
the other results were a search result page (not a good  result) and an inner page from a previous result (also not a good result).
the other search engines all hold less than 4% of the market share (except for msn which uses yahoo's inktomi), so i won't be considering them.

google's diversity is a big bonus, but the 2 spam/junk/useless sites really hurt it.
they seem just as good, if not better, than google's.
