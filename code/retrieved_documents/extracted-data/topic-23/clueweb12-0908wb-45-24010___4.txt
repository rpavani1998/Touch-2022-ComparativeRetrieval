if yahoo tries to re-inflate its share price with a new search  deal with google, yahoo irretreivably sets itself down a path of: a very serious collusion antitrust investigation with the doj; and a tradeoff of long-term competitive position decline and destruction  of long-term shareholder value for a short-term increase in profitability  and share price.
interested parties should go directly to the source document here and  read themicrosoft letter to yahoo very carefully.

- google also denied microsoft the only available opportunity to assemble the scale and scope in users, advertisers and publishers to better compete with google.
