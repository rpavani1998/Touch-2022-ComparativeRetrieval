having two good search engines to choose from makes searching that much better for everyone.we are not liable for any negative consequences that may result from implementing any information covered in our articles or tutorials.the content provided is intended for entertainment and/or educational purposes in order to introduce to the reader key ideas, concepts, and/or product reviews.as such it is incumbent upon the reader to employ real-world tactics for security and implementation of best practices.both types of results are useful, with google having an edge in realtors.it also makes traffic to your site steadier.it also makes marketing better.it also makes getting listings better.information about music from different sources such as magazine, tv and other music news sites are found 6 times in the top 10 results.the other links are all affiliate spam with no content whatsoever (just links to stores), with the exception of one of yahoo's links, which has some biographical content about artists.liposuction i expected to find information about liposuction, liposuction organizations and either doctors or centers where you can have liposuction done.in comparing these engines, it seems to me that yahoo's results are from a brand new engine.maybe they took parts and ideas from all the search engines they bought - maybe they even took the best parts - , but whatever they did, the result is something completely new.now there will be more stability; if you drop in google today, your hits from yahoo will remain consistent.other than the 3 doubled sites, the results included 4 informational sites, 2 sites for finding doctors and one poorly written article about the history of liposuction.
