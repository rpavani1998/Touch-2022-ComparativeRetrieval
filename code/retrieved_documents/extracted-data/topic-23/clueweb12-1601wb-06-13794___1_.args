we have found this to be absolutely true, and one of the most powerful ways to penetrate highly competitive keyword phrases on google.slowly modifying your pages to penetrate a difficult phrase can have a devastating effect on your competition.when google sees new pages are added and slight changes are constantly being made, it increases your web sites rankings within search results.separating a few target pages out and having them stay static will insure you are still accommodating the 'other' search engines.when you edit the page to better suite what is being searched it causes the page to be edited just slightly, not enough for it to be considered a new topic.when your web site is active, google rewards your site with higher rankings.check google cache everyday until you see the new page listed, once it is in the cache try searching for some of the prominent phrases that appear in your new page.(maybe once every week) can cause your site to be considered more up to date and therefore break the tie.yahoo and msn prefer sites to be static for long periods of time before giving them high search results.there is no lack of advise out there for finding many other ways, the objective here was to share our findings.they are more interested in what the page has on it and how long it has been available.also find out if there are any iterations of that phrase that are searched more often.
