the markup and code underneath can make your content even more attractive to search engines and help your visitors find what they are looking for faster.in essence it's a user-friendly manner to search for content by filtering on author, content type, taxonomy,...faceted search also has a couple of extra features that make it a worthy competitor.solr (via the solr integration module written and maintained by robert douglas) provides a method to bring very robust faceted search to drupal sites.as you search in google (or yahoo or msn), the results you click go on to train surf canyon to find links more relevant to what you are looking for.if you haven't heard yet, microsoft and yahoo! have inked a 10 year deal to partner on search and advertising.if the deal is approved by regulators, we could see changes in yahoo and bing search and advertising early next year, from the sound of it.for bonus points there would be a way for content recommendation engine or other modules with user specific input to add their influence to the final list.now, not everyone has the resources to set up a server with apache solr, be it an actual dedicated server to run the software on or the funds to rent one.this module allows drupal developers and site administrators to plug into google's enterprise search offerings (the googlemini and the google search appliance).aside from better performance the most prominent feature is the addition of faceted search.certainly if you do everything right up to this point: write good content, use appropriate markup and install the right drupal modules, the search engines will index your site.these modules could have their own configuration (e.g. to only pull from certain vocabularies), and the central api would allow you to weight one module/factor against another (e.g. taxonomy similarity v.s. word similarity v.s. destination node votes or freshness).manually entered parsed links search/analysis of title/body taxonomy same content type related links ☺ ☺ ☺ ☺ related block ☺ similar by terms ☺ similar entries ☺ relevant content ☺ ☺ it should be pointed out that while related links is one of the oldest of the bunch, and has most features, it is not quite as flexible as people are looking for (which i think is the main reason for the other modules), and the ui is not always easy to understand.basically, surf canyon helps you find information deep within the search results.
