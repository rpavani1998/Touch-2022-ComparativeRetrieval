all of their products and services could be improved with better search.it also cant help retaining or attracting top search talent.they are diversified to the point, that they attract visitors with their content, services, and web 2.0 initiatives.besides, yahoo quickly showed that it knows the value of features that bring into the search domain what the artificial intelligence of search algorithms cannot - human intelligence.yahoo could probably have made some important technical improvements to our search experience, but instead they have decided to pay attention to only their market share.they are a firm second in the search field, far from an after thought, but can be successful focusing their business elsewhere.and while i love the google work environment they have created, i'm not sure the founders are really proven business strategists or executives.so, with many potential pitfalls, a less than proven management team and one significant source of revenue that they aren't all that good at-just better than anyone else-will they be successful?competition is important for yahoo and others, otherwise innovation will end.i am far from an internet neophyte yet i never really started using google over yahoo for search until after the ipo.in any case yahoo lacks innovation.they are lining up enemies in every facet of business including the customer ranks.even if yahoo! maintains a strong number two showing, that will only compliment their strong "stickiness" of the other services offered.we would be very happy to maintain our market share.''yahoo's future lies in a different place, as the no1 destination site /portal.
