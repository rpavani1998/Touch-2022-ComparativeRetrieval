on-page markup enables search engines to understand the information on web pages and provide richer search results in order to make it easier for users to find relevant information on the web.that should help them by providing both companies with a larger stream of search related data that can be exploited to improve search relevance, ad placement and trend spotting.the web isn’t merely words — it’s information about things in the real world, and understanding the relationships between real-world entities can help us deliver relevant information more quickly.search engines including bing, google and yahoo! rely on this markup to improve the display of search results, making it easier for people to find the right web pages.many applications, especially search engines, can benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data.supporting multiple syntaxes makes documentation for webmasters more complex and introduces more overhead in terms of defining new formats.they have found that how many people search for flu-related topics is a leading indicator for reports on how many people actually have flu symptoms.a shared markup vocabulary makes easier for webmasters to decide on a markup schema and get the maximum benefit for their efforts.by making our flu estimates available each day, google flu trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza.”it will also help to foster competition with google focused on developing better search technology.you have said in the past that through “brute force” — analyzing massive amounts of queries and web content — google’s engine can deliver results that make it seem as if it understood things semantically, when it really functions using other algorithmic approaches.we think you can get to a much better level of understanding through pattern-matching data, building large-scale systems.i interpret these comments to mean that google’s management still views the concept of semantic search (and the semantic web) as involving better understanding of the intended meaning of text in documents and queries.it’s main advantage over microformats is that it is extensible — you can define new semantic vocabulary terms.that’s why it’s better to have an approach that’s based on machine learning and that changes, iterates and responds to the data.
