the only motive google has to diversify its offerings is to protect it's user base; not to add revenue generating services.search engines want to refer search users to sites where they can have some measure of assurance the site will display properly.let's face it, google generally sends users off to other websites rather than keeping visitors transfixed by its own services, and amazingly, this really does not harm its earning potential.she is innovative, creative and a fantastic communicator.google lives and dies by the sheer number of users who visit google.com and engage its search services, (google gives the largest stake of advertising revenue to content publisher partners that serve its ads).if a search box in browser software, (or as a function of a favorite portal) ends up being the way people use search (rather than directly), that threatens the very nature of success google has enjoyed to this point.it may constitute a second revenue generating service by google.if search becomes a commodity again, google would be charging for services it currently gives away free, then an upstart can repeat the google burn by focusing on search alone.nearly all of google's revenue is earned by ads served at google.com, where only a meager 10% (roughly) is earned through content network ad serving.google can think of itself as a modern media company, referring users elsewhere while selling search ads.as danny pointed out in a recent searchcast, people use google for its search, and other sites that offer search for their other services.google seems to have improved its ability to identify low-quality link ranking schemes.we bet many readers were ecstatic to learn that the basic version of google earth is free, and would gladly have paid something for it.a shift from the ranking power associated with large numbers of off-topic links, links from link pages, and reciprocal linking in general, has shifted towards additional power for inbound links from trusted sites."i find it hard to believe that the search engines will go to these lengths for personalization but use it only on paid search.
