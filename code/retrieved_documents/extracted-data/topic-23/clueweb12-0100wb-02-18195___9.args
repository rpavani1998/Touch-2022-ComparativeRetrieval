having two good search engines to choose from makes searching that much better for everyone.
google has a lot more diversity.
there were 3 music resource sites (but no magazines), one downloading program, one cd store, one radio station (yahoo radio), one music directory, and the 10th result was an audio player program site.
google had some lower quality sites, but the information was just as good even though they did seem less professional.
so even though i didn't necessarily want the latest news about what a charity did regarding mosquito nets, i think getting the same site twice from yahoo (not to mention the search result page) is the bigger
information about music from different sources such as magazine, tv and other music news sites are found 6 times in the top 10 results.
it also makes marketing better.
google also had 2 sites in its top ten that were of no value whatsoever; mp3.com which just has one page stating that they no longer offer the services that they used to (with links to their parent company), and music.com, which is nothing more than an email gathering site for a newsletter (not a single link on the entire page).
what i got was a lot of "how to find a doctor" sites, with a lot of good information.
the 10th result was an audio player program site.
they seem just as good, if not better, than google's.
it also offered downloading and file sharing programs 3 times.
in comparing these engines, it seems to me that yahoo's results are from a brand new engine.
the content provided is intended for entertainment and/or educational purposes in order to introduce to the reader key ideas, concepts, and/or product reviews.
the other results were a search result page (not a good result) and an inner page from a previous result (also not a good result).
in less than twenty-four hours, google went from about 79% of the market share to about 51%, almost overnight.
now there will be more stability; if you drop in google today, your hits from yahoo will remain consistent.
maybe they took parts and ideas from all the search engines they bought - maybe they even took the best parts - , but whatever they did, the result is something completely new.
the only differences were sites by actual realtors and sites that were simply property listings.

mosquito nets it seems to me that someone searching for "mosquito nets" wants either a) to buy them, or b) to learn about them, so i was expecting to find either stores or information about mosquito nets.
google gave me 4 good informational sites, 2 good "find a doctor" sites, one recent article about liposuction for people in the industry, one site with very poor information one written by a single doctor and one site that was nothing more than a directory.
the only way this could have been worse is if yahoo's results sucked, and they don't.
both types of results are useful, with google having an edge in realtors.
it also makes traffic to your site steadier.

so google has 5 spam sites, and yahoo has 3 and a half.
the other results were a search result page (not a good result) and an inner page from a previous result (also not a good result).
the other search engines all hold less than 4% of the market share (except for msn which uses yahoo's inktomi), so i won't be considering them.
many people are saying that the results come from a new inktomi because the results are similar; but the results are also similar to all the other search engines out there.
google's diversity is a big bonus, but the 2 spam/junk/useless sites really hurt it.
they seem just as good, if not better, than google's.
the other links are all affiliate spam with no content whatsoever (just links to stores), with the exception of one of yahoo's links, which has some biographical content about artists.
the only differences were sites by actual realtors and sites that were simply property listings.

art prints and posters yahoo offers 6 stores, while google offers 5.
overall, it looks like yahoo needs to fix its doubling of sites and google needs to clean out some spam (poor sites).
yahoo showed me 6 stores and 2 informational pages.

it also offered downloading and file sharing programs 3 times.
on the other hand, yahoo did have one site that was nothing more than a links page from another realtor's site.
other than the 3 doubled sites, the results included 4 informational sites, 2 sites for finding doctors and one poorly written article about the history of liposuction.
it also makes getting listings better.
being #1 in google was great, but when you had the misfortune of dropping even a couple of positions you really felt it.

as such it is incumbent upon the reader to employ real-world tactics for security and implementation of best practices.
the other search engines all hold less than 4% of the market share (except for msn which uses yahoo's inktomi), so i won't be considering them.
yahoo results included 3 sites doubled.
the other 2 charitable organizations were a news article outlining what they had done regarding mosquito nets and information about mosquito nets.
