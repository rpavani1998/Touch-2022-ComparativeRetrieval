i have found there to be more sites listed in yahoo's database than google's and have also found it to be far more easier to optimize your site for yahoo.google recently added 1.1million shares to its offering but has allotted them to yahoo in order to pay for a technology licence to continue displaying adwords in a settlement of a long-standing patent suit.if you peruse the forums, you find that there are many topics discussing the lack of traffic coming from and the difficulty of maintaining consistent rankings in yahoo.this will ensure your site will be crawled and indexed.you can optimize and see results with yahoo.if shares trade in that price range, google and its current shareholders could see as much as $3.4biliion, placing the overall value of the company around $32billion - $35billion.as for increasing traffic that actually comes from yahoo, optimize your on page content.this is an easy conclusion to reach being that yahoo and yahoo-owned search engines are the only ones currently using paid inclusion.it seems that yahoo's ranking algorithm values this more than backlinks pointing to your site.although, some have speculated that if you're already in yahoo search's index, submitting to their directory can hurt rankings you've established from the free crawl.as it stands, if ranking in yahoo is important to you, it may be advisable to pay the $300 and join their directory.like rustybrick, he receives most of his search engine traffic from google.if you are reading this column and have not been living on mars for the past year, you know that google is about to go public, and soon.in fact,rustybrick of seroundtable.com, states that google "provides over 70%" search engine traffic that his site receives.however, yahoo is still including meta descriptions when a search is queried.
