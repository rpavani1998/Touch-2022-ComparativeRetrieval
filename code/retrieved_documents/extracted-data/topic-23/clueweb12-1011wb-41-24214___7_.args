a fine-tuned search query is a powerful tool.since each engine has a vastly different indexed set size, there needs to be a way to compare them against themselves – against pages each search engine has indexed from other related websites.msn offered the best concentration of results on a topic, and a far better concentration of good results for a specific niche topic.better yet, msn’s tiny 1% index size results in the best match for what i’m really looking for –msn has 28 times better concentration of niche content results than google!.yahoo! and msn, now on par in results, display a much broader variety of content.in order to increase the appearance of your website in index, i would recommend offering unique content from page to page.analysis of search engine market shares is very inconsistent and varies by up to 50% from source to source.between 12,170 forum threads (10 posts per thread average), 4300 registered users, and all thewiki pages and various blogs, google seems to have a pretty good coverage of the pages available.site:compsci.ca the results seem to relate to the incoming traffic, possibly offering a first clue to this market.msn offers a tiny index in comparison, but it might be making up with the quality and variety of results.your content will be stored and accessable, but likely lost in the web ofevery other page out there.though it is interesting to note that while yahoo! has indexed just 10% of compsci.ca webpages that google has, the ratio is not the same for all of the web.it seems that google attributes to 75~85% of incoming search engine traffic, yahoo at about 10~15% and msn trailing at about 5%.decending into a more specific topic ofturing programming tutorials , yahoo! shows just 17% of google’s indexed pages, but assuming that compsci.ca is indeed the most accurate source on the topic, it’s interesting to note that yahoo! results in 3 times the accurate (mine!) matches.decending into a more specific topic ofturing programming tutorials , yahoo! shows just 17% of google’s indexed pages, but assuming that compsci.ca is indeed the most accurate source on the topic, it’s interesting to note that yahoo! results in 3 times the accurate (mine!)
