despite this fact, php does have a well defined process of membership and decision making similar to what more formal organizations tend to have.the lack of a legally incorporated organization seems to mainly be a problem in scenarios where php would need to assert trademark or copyright or otherwise enter into legal proceedings against some threat - scenarios which have never materialized.from these results it follows as an obvious recommendation that vendors participating in open source development and business, should look into participating in collaborative community developed projects - where the standard and familiar governance form is a non-profit foundation.since the original vendor is always the strongest candidate to become the leading vendor also in a collaboratively developed project, the vendor could,as a rule of thumb, expect this strategy - if properly executed - to result in a 10x growth in the project and product, but also 10x larger addressable market, of which the vendor can expect to capture 50% or more as its own market share.by comparing the relative investment of red hat and novell into the development of linux, it was shown that both the largest and second largest linux vendor clearly benefit from sharing development cost by collaborative development.even if the underlying data was deemed to be of poor quality, it is clear it does not have errors that could explain a difference of this magnitude.similarly separate "contributor modules" archives - found in perl, php, drupal etc... - are considered part of the main project, as a modular architecture is a key enabler of growing a large community.the conclusions that can be drawn from this set of software are not obviously transferrable to niche or domain specific tools that operate with vastly smaller user-bases, much smaller development communities and no clear business model.by studying a selection - believed to be more or less complete - of the most popular open source projects and correlating their size with governance model, we have revealed a strong, and to some possibly surprising result: the oracle controlled openjdk may prove to become an exception to the rule, since ibm in 2010 announced that it will contribute to openjdk development and abandon apache harmony.the main results of this study are statistically very strong, with a 10x difference in size between different types of projects, and however large the margin of error due to ohloh inaccuracies, it is certainly smaller than that.the product's market share one factor limiting the products market share is how well its functionality and features serve the needs of the total addressable market.since the original vendor is always the strongest candidate to become the leading vendor also in a collaboratively developed project, the vendor could, as a rule of thumb, expect this strategy - if properly executed - to result in: the project growing 10 times larger.so while it is a remarkable achievement to build a large developer community around a previously closed source product, the path taken to achieve that is perhaps not applicable in a general case.(of course, if linux was a single vendor project, then novell's share as the second largest vendor would tend to be zero or insignificant, so the benefit of participating in a collaborative project is in that light quite dramatic for the second vendor.)recommendations from these results it follows as an obvious recommendation that vendors participating in open source development and business, should look into participating in collaborative community developed projects - where the standard and familiar governance form is a non-profit foundation.
