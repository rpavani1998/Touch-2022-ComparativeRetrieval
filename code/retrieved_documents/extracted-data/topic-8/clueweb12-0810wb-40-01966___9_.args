after sorting the smaller lists, which is supposed to be easier than sorting the entire initial list, we can try to merge the result into one sorted list.it is written in c# but it can be easily converted to java or any other language.fast no matter the input merge sort is a great sorting algorithm mainly because it’s very fast and stable.slower than non-comparison based algorithms merge sort is however based on the comparison model and as such can be slower than algorithms not based on comparisons that can sort data in linear time.implementation the good news is that this algorithm is fast, but not too difficult to implement and that sounds quite good from a developer’s point of view.this reference of best practices and idiomatic solutions smoothly guides you to the next step of... - dzone - refcardz - book reviews - tech library - it questions - snippets - my profile - about dzone - advertise - tools & buttons - send feedback - topics - html5 - wp7 - cloud - mobile - .net - python - java - php - solr-lucene - eclipse - jetbrains - netbeans - agile - devops controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.as a conclusion i can say that merge sort is practically one of the best sorting algorithms because it’s easy to implement and fast, so it must be considered by every developer!so we can be sure that merge sort is very stable no matter the input.of course, this depends on the input data, so we must be careful of the input.- defining a restful framework - developer efficiency - xcode vs. eclipse vs. visual studio - groovy, a reasonable jvm language for devops - sometimes it takes 2 days to do 2 hours of work - interfaces in dynamic languages - client-side server monitoring with jolokia and jmx - getting started with data mining - test driven development without tears latest articles - groovy will replace the java language as dominant language - a domain-specific language for unit manipulations - higher-order functions with groovy, part 1 - from java to groovy, part 2: closures and native syntax for lists - dynamic typing vs dynamic language explained - alex tkachman on static groovy: the inside scoop - the war on grails is really a war on spring - grails 1.0 released!indeed if the input is nearly sorted the insertion sort or bubble sort can be faster.we can start comparing the first items of the lists and than we can pop the smaller of them both and put it into a new list containing the merged (sorted) array.the python zone is sponsored bynew relic, the all-in-one web application performance tool that lets yousee performance from the end user experience, through servers, and down to the line of application code.the problem with these three algorithms is that their complexity is o(n2) so they are very slow.python zone is brought to you in partnership with:  stoimen popov - bio - website - @stoimenpopov - - i've been working on web based projects built mainly with php and javascript, where i mostly use zend framework and jquery.
