therefore, many frameworks and helper tools have been created to assist developers in creating faster and more robust sites.storing the objects directly has the advantage that nearly all objects can be saved in a straightforward way, unlike in relational databases where some objects are very hard to represent.the template engine is text-based and is designed to be usable for page designers who cannot write python.it includes an orm which is quite powerful while being simple to use, and has a great online administration interface which makes it possible to edit the data in the database with a browser.it presents some ways to integrate python with a web server, and general practices useful for developing web sites.it is worth learning about the available tools because they can greatly simplify the process of developing a web site. ..this is useful for debugging, but it might risk exposing some confidential data to the user.bigger web applications can have lots of code, so it is a good idea to have an effective structure right from the beginning.that's why it is important not to write unnecessary python code in the templates -- it works against the mvc model and creates chaos in the code base, making it harder to understand and modify. ..most http servers are written in c or c++, so they cannot execute python code directly -- a bridge is needed between the server and the program.django has many handy features bundled, such as creation of rss feeds or generic views, which make it possible to create web sites almost without writing any python code.although wsgi may seem complex, the initial phase of learning can be very rewarding because wsgi and the associated middleware already have solutions to many problems that might arise while developing web sites.the code to provide a particular service often works the same way regardless of the complexity or purpose of the web site in question.that way, even users of other frameworks (or even other languages, since mvc is not python-specific) can easily understand the code, given that they are already familiar with the mvc structure.unlike the php interpreter, the python interpreter uses caching when executing files, so changes to a file will require the web server to be restarted.
