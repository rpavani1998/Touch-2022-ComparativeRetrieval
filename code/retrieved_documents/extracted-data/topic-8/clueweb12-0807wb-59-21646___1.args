the key to the dictionary is page number (1-based).
the cryptic text.sort( key=lambda row: (-row.y, row.x) ) will sort the text blocks into order from top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
also, the package seems to rely on a huge volume of isinstance type checking.
the good news is that they're documented ( http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html).
the bad news is that they're rather complex.
in a multi-column layout, the footer can be so close to the bottom of a column that pdfminer may put the two text blocks together.

but some kind of filter that picked elements by type might be nicer than a lot of isinstance checks.
