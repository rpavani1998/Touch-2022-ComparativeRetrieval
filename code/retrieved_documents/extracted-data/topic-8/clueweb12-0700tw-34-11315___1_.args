merge sort is a great sorting algorithm mainly because it’s very fast and stable.the good news is that this algorithm is fast, but not too difficult to implement and that sounds quite good from a developer’s point of view.after sorting the smaller lists, which is supposed to be easier than sorting the entire initial list, we can try to merge the result into one sorted list.merge sort is however based on the comparison model and as such can be slower than algorithms not based on comparisons that can sort data in linear time.fast no matter the input merge sort is a great sorting algorithm mainly because it’s very fast and stable.slower than non-comparison based algorithms merge sort is however based on the comparison model and as such can be slower than algorithms not based on comparisons that can sort data in linear time.implementation the good news is that this algorithm is fast, but not too difficult to implement and that sounds quite good from a developer’s point of view.as a conclusion i can say that merge sort is practically one of the best sorting algorithms because it’s easy to implement and fast, so it must be considered by every developer!so we can be sure that merge sort is very stable no matter the input.of course, this depends on the input data, so we must be careful of the input.indeed if the input is nearly sorted the insertion sort or bubble sort can be faster.we can start comparing the first items of the lists and than we can pop the smaller of them both and put it into a new list containing the merged (sorted) array.the python zone is sponsored bynew relic, the all-in-one web application performance tool that lets yousee performance from the end user experience, through servers, and down to the line of application code.the problem with these three algorithms is that their complexity is o(n2) so they are very slow.insertion sort, bubble sort and shell sort are based on the comparison model.
