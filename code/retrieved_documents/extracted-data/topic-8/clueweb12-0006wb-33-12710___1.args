on the next page, we will look atthe php version of this setup and see how we can code the program to allow command-line execution and debugging.

if you are at all uncomfortable with the cgi library, i encourage you to read [link url=/od/cgiformswithpython/ss/pycgitut1.htm] my tutorial on programming cgi with python.
if cgi is used for this program, the application should have a 'cgi' suffix instead of the usual 'py'.
the way we assign data to feedname depends on whether we are using php or cgi as the intermediary.
in addition to receiving the user data, we need to define a variable to hold the data.
if we use cgi, we will need to import the cgi and cgitb libraries, enablecgitb, and then assign the data from cgi.
