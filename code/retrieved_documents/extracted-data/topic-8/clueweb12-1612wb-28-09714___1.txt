the 2nd and 3rd place languages were javascript and python.
i couldn't find as well significantly other tips and information aboutlip plumpers on this posting, so it was fantastic to discover this one.
with the announcement of google chrome web store, i think that more developers will spend more time on html5, javascript and actionscript, just like java developers jumping into android.
it also indicates that most java programers are sever side programmers since there is not really much space for java on desktop or on the web.
sadly disappointed to see them combined.

perhaps a dzone article explaining the vast differences between actionscript and javascript is in order? a. shirkov is right to point out that not only are the languages different, but their field of use keeps them widely disparate as well.
so please answer the question of the audience.
