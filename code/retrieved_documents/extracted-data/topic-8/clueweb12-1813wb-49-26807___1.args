feel free to look at the cost calculator tool to estimate usage costs.
this is great, and we can easily add extra locations to this policy and have, for example, a third location in asia.
given the cdn is just a checkbox on the management pages means integrating with cdn is a breeze.
tenants will, in the future, be given the option to authenticate to their own adfs server, we’re pretty sure acs will allow us to simply configure that and instrument only tenant x can use that adfs server.
it’s the building blocks available such as traffic manager, cdn and access control service that make our lives easier.
cloud zone is brought to you in partnership with: maarten balliauw website @maartenballiauw maarten balliauw is a technical consultant in web technologies at realdolmen, one of belgium's biggest ict companies.
this dzone refcard provides an in depth introduction to the cloud computing technology, google app engine.
distributing the application does mean that our us datacenter server has to access storage in the eu datacenter which of course adds some latency.
acs has been a great time saver and is definitely something we want to use in future project.
cheap as in cost-effective, not as in, well, sleezy.
to streamline, manage and maintain a clear overview of which user can authenticate to which application via which identity provider, we use acs to facilitate myget authentication.
the main use case for myget is accessing and downloading packages.
we try to reduce this using extensive caching on all sides, but it’d be nicer if traffic manager allowed us to setup georeplication for storage as well.
the windows azure content delivery network allows us to serve users fast.
in fact, we even plan for tenants so every tenant in fact is its own application.
the pricing structure is not always that transparent but if you dig a little into it you’ll find affordable solutions that are really easy to use because you don’t have to roll your own.
ok, the updating has some latency due to the restrictions mentioned above, but if you download a package from myget it will always come from a cdn node near the end user to ensure low latency and fast access.
reading packages is not affected by this because we’re using the windows azure cdn for that.
while appealing, we think about deploying memcached in our application because of the cost structure involved.
many will disagree with me but the cost perspective of windows azure can be real cheap in some cases as well as very expensive in other cases.

we currently use the asp.net in-memory cache on all machines but do feel the need for having a distributed caching solution.
acs has been a great time saver and is definitely something we want to use in future project.
with myget we run 2 windows azure instances in 2 datacenters across the globe (one in the us and one in the eu).
in our scenario, windows azure is cheap.
it really eases common authentication pains and acts as a service bus between users, identity providers and our applications.
to give you an example: our dev environment allows logging in via openid on a development machine.
not ideal as the web application will be served faster from a server that’s closer to the end user, but the application will not go down.
it’s the building blocks available such as traffic manager, cdn and access control service that make our lives easier.
microsoft has a host of tools to let you deploynode.js, php, and java apps on their windows azure platform.

the cloud zone is presented by dzone and microsoft.
production allows for openid on a live environment.
with myget we run 2 windows azure instances in 2 datacenters across the globe (one in the us and one in the eu).
you can see how wellyour apps run on azure with their free 3 month trial.

traffic manager traffic manager, a great (beta) product in the windows azure offering allows us to do geographically distributed applications.
dzone has great portals for python, cloud, nosql, and html5!
we use windows azure storage (blobs, tables and queues) as those only cost $0.12 per gb.
we currently use the asp.net in-memory cache on all machines but do feel the need for having a distributed caching solution.

in staging, we only use windows live id and facebook whereas our production website uses different identity providers.
for $180.00 per month this means 2 great machines at two very distant regions of the globe.
for example, if someone asks me if they should move to windows azure and they now have one server running 300 small sites, i’d probably tell them not to move as it will be a tough price comparison.
conclusion in short, windows azure is much more than hosting and scalability.
this only affects storing package metadata and packages.
next to geographically distributing myget, traffic manager also ensures that if one datacenter goes down, the dns pool will consist of only “live” datacenters and thus provide datacenter fail-over.

but we might as well end up with wndows azure appfabric caching anyway as it integrates nicely with our current codebase.

first of all, here’s a high-level overview of our deployment, which may illustrate some of the aspects below: costs windows azure is cheap.

basically, he mocked me for using windows azure formyget, a website with enough users but not enough to justify the “scalability” aspect he thought windows azure was offering.
