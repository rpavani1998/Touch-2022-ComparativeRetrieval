the problem with these three algorithms is that their complexity is o(n2) so they are very slow.
slower than insertion and bubble sort for nearly sorted input again it is very important to know the input data.

this section is brought to you in partnership with: programming groovy is easy to start with.
easy implementation another cool reason is that merge sort is easy to implement.
merge sort is a great sorting algorithm mainly because it’s very fast and stable.
indeed if the input is nearly sorted the insertion sort or bubble sort can be faster.
fast no matter the input merge sort is a great sorting algorithm mainly because it’s very fast and stable.
insertion sort, bubble sort and shell sort are based on the comparison model.
as a conclusion i can say that merge sort is practically one of the best sorting algorithms because it’s easy to implement and fast, so it must be considered by every developer!

however recursion can be bitter so you can go for a iterative solution.
of course, this depends on the input data, so we must be careful of the input.
again it is very important to know the input data.
so far so good, so let’s say we have a very large list of data, which we want to sort.
if they remain too large, we can continue breaking them down until we get to something very easy to sort as shown on the diagram bellow.
dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!
we can start comparing the first items of the lists and than we can pop the smaller of them both and put it into a new list containing the merged (sorted) array.

slower than non-comparison based algorithms merge sort is however based on the comparison model and as such can be slower than algorithms not based on comparisons that can sort data in linear time.
after sorting the smaller lists, which is supposed to be easier than sorting the entire initial list, we can try to merge the result into one sorted list.
so we can be sure that merge sort is very stable no matter the input.

implementation the good news is that this algorithm is fast, but not too difficult to implement and that sounds quite good from a developer’s point of view.
