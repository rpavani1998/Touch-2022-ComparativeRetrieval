each wiki peer, who works 8 hours daily in wikis and blogs should at least have an income of 2000 us$ a month from their wiki work, so that they are free to dedicate their best ideas, knowledge and skills to the prospering of the planet, without being hampered by paid work for "third parties", who are not interested in the wellbeing of the whole planet.fortunately we know how much our common success depends on good teamwork, so it should not be a great problem to find a good compromise between self-expression and self-sacrifice.the citizens are brothers and sisters who help one another through reciprocal trust, respect, clarity, acceptance, solidarity, and continuous inner transformation.i don't know whether he can contribute constructively or not, but i would like someone in this community to try to give him advise.it's great that you also have an economic model to make wiki work profitable and i wish you the best, but i do not understand it and therefore it doesn't motivate me to participate.often they pay by a loss of freedom, by being hierarchical or autocratic.i feel as a communicator and mediator: translating the visions of my customers into software and enabling these visions by knowing and showing my customers the potentials of new technologies.the communities represent the ideal form of union and communal living.a lot of technology is old (recent edits turned off, no page history, no one-click diff+page available, no summary), the founder virtually non-existent, vision and direction has been lost, people are frustrated and have lost their faith in their wiki although they still cling to it.it's still too early to know what will happen but i think it will be worthwhile anyway, either small and family-like or bigger, a signal of breakthrough.you are changing the very nature of wiki (c.f.whatisawiki), so the burden of proof is on you to prove that this makes sense and is welcome to the community.i am having a headache in things likesuperordinategoal, and often been wondering what extent of relevance these have to my needs to get informed on "practical aspects" of communications and teambuilding in an organization (not online community per se).it might be helpful to leave generic queries to google, because this saves keystrokes to the peers, who want to explore the context and to elaborate shows possibly related work in other wikis (if camelcase queries are used) to connect with authors with a wiki blog, can leave their rich link support on their blog, allowing their peers to delete links in the base wiki, but with notifying, that the deleted links are still on the author's blog.until now, most of us were conditioned, to have "a good feeling", when we contribute to wikis, although "this is paid badly", or in less euphemistic terms: "having a good feeling with unpaid work".you are of course right that the summary/digest should be in sync with the page content and reflect the process.
