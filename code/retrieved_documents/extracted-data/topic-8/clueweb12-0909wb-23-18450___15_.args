hitting indexes and keeping datasets small is critical, and the django ecosystem has many great tools to help us profile.it's unusual for open source code and communities to bridge minor perceived differences in scope and style and to start sharing code and ideas openly.however, the tools and techniques apply just as well to other python web frameworks, so users of other tools will likely be able to follow along fairly easily.we update and deploy new code at least once a week, and have to deal with the additional complication of managing and interacting with parts of the php site that have not been ported over.there is a fair amount of unnecessary animosity between developers about version control systems, especially between mercurial and git users.we will also discuss in some detail its ajax capabilities by using web2py components and plugins for modular design of rich web interfaces.we will discuss many different tools, including pandas, a new open source library designed for analyzing common financial and economic data sets.we ran into issues creating a reliable environment with this method; switching to a separate vendor repository solved our problems with only a small amount of added effort.in reality, these two systems are very similar and can actually cooperate pretty well.we see about 120 million web requests per month and 1.4 million visitors per day.python in quantitative finance (#158) python in quantitative finance presented by wes mckinney (aqr capital management, llc) this talk will show how python and libraries such as numpy were instrumental at aqr for building a robust research platform for prototyping and implementing quantitative trading models.in this talk we will show just how similar git and mercurial are, look at some of their technical differences, and see how they can work together by looking at hg-git, the bidirectional git/mercurial bridge, implemented in python.the classic, but difficult, algorithm for lexical analysis becomes simple when composing python's dicts and frozensets.in this tutorial we will provide a brief introduction to web2py, the web based ide, its internal design, and its internal file organization.this talk will be a case study of scaling and deploying a large website (and getting faster than php) with mysql, memcached, virtualenv, celery, hudson, redis, mongodb, and more.
