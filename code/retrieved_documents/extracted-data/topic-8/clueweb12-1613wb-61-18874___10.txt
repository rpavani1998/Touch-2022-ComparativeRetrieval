that leads to another problem – we must know the interval of values from the input.
because the input is so important for an algorithm's efficiency, we may ask if there are any sorting algorithms that are faster than o(n.log(n)), which is the average-case complexity for merge sort and quicksort.
view full user profile algorithm of the week: radix sort 03.20.2012  email views: 5457 tweet this content is part of the python zone, which is  presented to you by dzone andnew relic.
for input that is almost sorted, insertion sort may be preferred instead  of quicksort, which is generally a faster algorithm.
because it consists only of integers and because array keys are integers in programming languages we can implement radix sort.
this algorithm is very useful in practice because in practice we often sort sets of integers.
array(4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5); function radix_sort(&$input) { $temp = array(); $len = count($input); // initialize with 0s $temp = array_fill(min, max-min+1, 0); foreach ($input as $key => $val) { $temp[$val]++; } $input = array(); foreach ($temp as $key => $val) { if ($val == 1) { $input[] = $key; } else { while ($val--) { $input[] = $key; } } } } // 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5 var_dump($list); radix_sort(&$list); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 var_dump($list);here the input is modified during the sorting process and it’s used as a result.
on the other hand, quicksort is considered one of the best general purpose sorting algorithms, but while it’s a great algorithm when the data is randomized, it’s practically as slow as bubble sort when the input is almost or fully sorted.

let’s say we have an array of integers which is not sorted.
indeed, php is flexible enough to build-up arrays in the memory without knowing their size in advance.
you need no more than a few loops to implement it.
and the answer is yes there are faster, linear complexity algorithms, that can sort data faster than quicksort, merge sort and heapsort.
but there are some constraints!
array(4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5); function radix_sort($input) { $temp = $output = array(); $len = count($input); for ($i = 0; $i  0) ?

indeed,insertion and bubble sort are considered slow, with a best-case complexity of o(n2), but they are quite effective when the input is fairly sorted.

requires additional space radix sort needs additional space – at least as much as the input.

first for each value of the input array we put the value of “1” on the key-th place of the temporary array as explained on the following diagram.

we may think that our input consists only of integers and we can go for  radix sort, but what if in the future someone passes floats or strings to our  routine.

everything sounds great but we can’t sort any particular data with linear complexity, so the question is what rules must the input follow in order to be sorted in linear time?
radix sort is very fast compared to other sorting algorithms as we saw on the diagram above.
array(4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6,  5); function radix_sort(&$input) { $temp = array(); $len = count($input);  // initialize with 0s $temp = array_fill(min, max-min+1, 0); foreach ($input as  $key => $val) { $temp[$val]++; } $input = array(); foreach ($temp as $key  => $val) { if ($val == 1) { $input[] = $key; } else { while ($val--) {  $input[] = $key; } } } } // 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5 var_dump($list);  radix_sort(&$list); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 var_dump($list); here the input is modified during the sorting process and it’s used as a  result.

fortunately, modern programming languages and libraries are more flexible so we can initialize our temporary array even if we don’t know the interval of input values, as in the example bellow.
works only with integers if you’re not sure about the input, you're better off not using radix  sort.
radix sort is restricted by the input’s domain, but i must say that in practice there are tons of cases where only integers are sorted.
final words radix sort is restricted by the input’s domain, but i must say that  in practice there are tons of cases where only integers are sorted.
the thing is  that old-school programming languages weren’t very flexible and we needed  to initialize the entire temporary array.
overview let’s say we have an array of integers which is not sorted.
such an algorithm that is capable of sorting data in linear o(n) time is radix sort and the domain of the input is restricted – it must consist only of integers.

share it with your friends: | more algorithms always depend on the input.
after  “initializing” the temporary array with one pass (with linear  complexity) we can sort the input.
so, when you have a sorted array and you add some “new” values to the array you can sort it quite effectively with insertion sort.

radix sort needs additional space – at least as much as the input.
if there are repeating values in the  input array, we increment the corresponding value in the temporary array.

it’s fast radix sort is very fast compared to other sorting algorithms as we saw on  the diagram above.
that is a great benefit in performance compared to o(n.log(n)) or even worse  with o(n2) as we can see in the following chart.

complexity the complexity of radix sort is linear, which in terms of omega means o(n).
we saw that general purpose sorting algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort andquicksort can be very efficient in some cases and inefficient in others.
