as a mechanism to conduct some rudimentary tests on the code written so far, the following code is introduced.
this is a must read article which provides the reader with a good overview without getting too much into the nitty gritties of functional programming.
add to that the fact that python is a language thats extremely easy to learn, suffers from excellent readability, has fairly good web frameworks such asdjango, has excellent mathematical and statistical libraries such asnumpy, and cool network oriented frameworks such as twisted.
threaded programs are nasty to write.
python may not be the right choice if you want to write 100% fp.
because of its focus on readability, it actually can be used to write functional programs are much more readable by a large mass of programmers than most of the functional programming languages themselves (readability being subjectively interpreted by me as what is most natural for english or similar language speaking people).
thus it will continuously generate tuples with the first element of the tuple being the ‘+’ character and the second being the number with the number varying from values 1 through n. thechain.from_iterable flattens the generated list (it thus has 20 items for n = 10, each alternate one being the ‘+’ character starting with the first items).
finally the handle_float function either sets the current value to the incoming value or in case the current operator is already set it applies the binary operator to the current value and the incoming value and replaces current with the computed value.

python will do it for you.
none) note that i created a unary_functions dict (or dictionary or hashmap) where the key is the character which represents the function and the value is the reference to the function.
python is probably the most productive language i have worked with (across a variety of different types of programming requirements).
functions as the basic building blocks : unsurprisingly fp requires the construction and usage of functions as the basic building units.
thus the code below should work (though it does not form a part of the calculator program).
but if you want to learn more of fp or use fp techniques along with other paradigmspython’s capabilities are screaming to be heard.
thus the way most changes to state are implemented are not by modifying an object in place (which is how imperative programming deals with it) but by cloning the data structure with some of the values getting modified and the modified data structure being returned by the function.
for the calculator i shall need acontext which contains astack for storing any incomplete operations, an attributecurrent reflecting the current value being shown on the screen and anop which might reflect a pending operation which is typically required for binary operators where the second value still needs to be provided.
update: i much later also conducted a presentation on the same topic at pycon india 2010.
thehandle_binary_op method reflects how the op in the context is set to the appropriate binary function that should be triggered after the subsequent value is known.
to further make it easy i re-represent the same function below differently which is much more readable and easier to understand.
for purpose of emphasis i would like to note that in the above code, “add” is now an entry in the namespace which is a reference to a function.
a function is said to be referentially transparent if its invocation can be substituted by the return value in a program without impacting the program in any other way.

when i wrote the calculator program, i wrote the functionality to introduce braces.

however that functionality is not particularly important in this explanation.
here you can get an overall feel of the program.
in general because of fewer side effects, testing under functional programming is often a lot easier, and the importance of having to do “integration” testing and “module” testing is lesser since testing functions in isolation is likely to identify most issues, far more than in typical imperative programming.
python is not particularly strong at immutable data.

on a named tuple it creates another tuple based on the existing namedtuple data, but with some of the values modified as specified in the keyword paramters passed to_replace.

processing one key i must confess i started off using key to represent the keystrokes, but along the way the key can also represent a complete floating point number (not just a single keystroke).
mocking out functions can also help testing each function in isolation.
thus the key parameter can refer to a single character operator or a sequence of characters representing a floating point number function_groups = { tuple(unary_functions.keys()) : handle_unary_op, tuple(binary_functions.keys()) : handle_binary_op, tuple(tokens.keys()) :
as this series of posts is about to demonstrate – python can do a decent job at it as well.

anamedtuple is another data structure which supports both tuple like access through indices or through named elements in the tuple.

this section is brought to you in partnership with: programming groovy is easy to start with.
this shows one more strength of python.

so i can better structure the subsequent posts based on the feedback.
in other words such a function cannot change any global variables, write to the console, update the database etc.

this is to demonstrate how python treats attributes and functions virtually identically consistent with theuniform access principle.
however since list is mutable, it cannot get used as a key into the overall hashmap, hence i convert it into a tuple.

some of the nice benefits (i am tempted to say side effects) of functional programming are : python is not the best functional programming language.

dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!
without much ado we now get into the sample program.
similarly during debugging you need to be able to quickly locate the function likely to have the problem, after which you can easily focus on the function to be able to quickly resolve the issue.
but if you want to learn more of fp or use fp techniques along with other paradigmspython’s capabilities are screaming to be heard.
because a data structure once constructed will not be modified and because the source of the modifications can be clearly located to the function which instantiated the datastructure, the unpredictability of data changing right under you is gone.
if it is the latter it searches for it in all the keys of each operator groups, and if it finds a match, it locates the corresponding handler function from the map and invokes it.
this shows one more strength of python.
a typical calculator supports simple unary or binary mathematical operators and performs floating point operations.

this reference can be passed around, assigned to other entries.

functional programming deals with the issue far more elegantly.
finally in case no match is found it ignores the key.
in an imperative environment, you not only have to deal with data structures being modified in place by some other parts of the program, in a threaded environment such modifications can happen using peer threads, even as your current thread whose logic you are focusing on is attempting to exercise that logic.
finally the handle_float function either sets the current value to the incoming value or in case the current operator is already set it applies the binary operator to the current value and the incoming value and replaces current with the computed value.
the process_key function takes the incoming key, passes it handle_float if it is a number, or treats it as an operator.
its an extremely unpredictable environment which has resulted in a number of how-to’s for safe threaded programming using constructs such as locks, mutexes etc.
thehandle_binary_op method reflects how the op in the context is set to the appropriate binary function that should be triggered after the subsequent value is known.

thus the value of any variable is not open to modification (thus they are called values and not variables).
a typical calculator supports simple unary or binary mathematical operators and performs floating point operations.
java programmers are aware of the immutability of the string instances wherein any modifications to the string result in a new string instance being created.
