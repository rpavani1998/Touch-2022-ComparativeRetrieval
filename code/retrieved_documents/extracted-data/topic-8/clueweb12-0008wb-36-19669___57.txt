without having a phd on the team of 8 programmers who happened to be a python pro (but interestingly enough had no django experience) was like a blind monkey trying to lead a pack of deaf rats.

as for being marriage material, the author again is assuming an idealistic world, where a spouse is faithfully and doesn't nag all the time.
and if i had a cat, it would twitch its tail and otherwise look mildly irritated at python code.
and, as it turns out, customers really don’t care whether your saas application is built in php, c#, ruby or python.
i think a lot about choices and decisions at startups.
but,  once you get past that initial dating period, you need to think about your  future.
the article was aptly titled, “python vs. c#: business and technology tradeoffs”.
and its also interesting that a very smart google engineer named j. skeet, one of the top rated users on stackoverflow wrote a great in depth book on c#.
posted on saturday, october 30, 2010 at 3:45 am by brent hooverseems like this decision to switch to python is even harder since the python 2.7 release on 4 july 2010 was the final end-of-life (albeit with extended support) for the 2.x branch and the new 3.x is not backward compatible with 2.x and django support for 3.x is still pretty much awol at this time.
i'm thinking of pylons here.
but in the end it's also about what the company you program for already uses.
just like i need to work with symfony 1.4 and not 2.0, even though i'd like to use 2.0 already (or one of the other frameworks).
the article was very widely read, and still continues to drive traffic (likely because it ranks #1 in google for “python vs c#”).

the hubspot developer interviews  are a bit, um,rigorous, but i promise that you’ll meet some  people that will have made the time spent worthwhile, even if things  don’t work out.
the decisions that are hardest arenot the ones where you have the least amount of information — they are the ones that are hardest to undo or reverse.
so,  i picked c# and .net — which frankly, if i had to do over, i  wouldn’t have picked (more on that later).
yes, it’s nice to know that there are thousands of hosting providers out there that all support php, and that you can get hosting really cheap as a result.
there are definitely times to learn new things and experiment with new technologies — the early days of your product development is not the best time.
i like some php frameworks too and will still use php but the more i learn about python it seems like everything you said on here is true.
if you’re in the software development business as a career choice (i.e. you’re going to do it for a long time), then the larger consideration should be what’s going to create the most value for you long-term.

posted on thursday, october 28, 2010 at 3:31 pm by brianits kind of interesting that stack overflow.com and answers.onstartups.com are both built on c# and asp.net mvc.
i’m sure they’re all great frameworks (i use codeigniter right now), but the fact that there’s no clear winner means that the market is fragmented.
i actually had  fun developing in the language, and after the first few months, i felt  that the code i was producing was about as good as some of the code i’m  most proud of throughout my professional career.
don’t get me wrong, ilove frameworks (dating back all the way to  the object windows library that borland had for  turbopascal).
low learning are less important than high ceilings.
second, success in the early days of a startup is much more about getting market validation and traction than anything else.
with guido as bdfl it means that progress can be made rather being mired in some of the community bickering that can go on with languages like java.
posted on thursday, october 28, 2010 at 8:54 am by bootsi love these arguments, it shows how much we grow over the years as we program.
it’s easy-going, fun, and you feel super-productive  (especially if you’re making a big change to something new).
cost most be taken into consideration as well as knowledge of the platform.
the only point you had that had any return on investment mentality was the "python means i get better programmers applying", but i would wager that you would find more quality php programmers simply due to the sheer number of php programmers to python programmers out there.
how functions are first-class objects.
(i’m talking about php 5+ here — and ignoring all the ugliness that  came before).
by this defintiion, picking the language/platform to use at a startup is one of the harder decisions.
contrast that to php where we have symfony, zend, codeigniter, kohana — and others.
php “just  happened”.
cumulatively, they’re getting millions of page views  a month now.

choose javascript posted on wednesday, october 27, 2010 at 8:56 pm by pytoat one point i had the option to choose .net or python for our primary web programming language.
for you, the cost of  change is high (maybe even prohibitively high).
one of the arguments i hear continually online goes something like this:   “php is a perfectly fine language, and folks pushing python are just  fad-focused elitists that want to work on the latest cool new thing, instead of  just picking what works and focusing on building apps that solve customer  problems.”
but, once you get past that initial dating period, you need to think about your future.
i’ve been programming for a long time, it’s my calling, and with any luck, i expect to do it for a couple of more decades.
and, if there are any arguments you’d make on either side (php or  python), would love to hear them.
i knew i wanted a dynamic language, and i had whittled things down to those three choices.
you’ve got a startup to grow, you can’t be bothered with trying to join the cool kids.
not to knock php (i actuallylove working in php) — but python is just a better language.
i actually had fun developing in the language, and after the first few months, i felt that the code i was producing was about as good as some of the code i’m most proud of throughout my professional career.
i write c# for a living but love learning about python and using it in my own products.
i'm also considering switching from php, mostly because of all the bad rumors about php6 development.
so true... posted on friday, november 26, 2010 at 7:03 pm by mike schinkelthis article was well written!
in the early days  of a startup, you’re looking to mitigate unnecessary risk and get to  market as fast as humanly possible.
as a “classically trained” developer (undergrad  compsci), i appreciate that python gets a bunch of the language stuff  “right”.
frameworks have an upfront cost, but provide a ton of value long-term.
i think that’s a  poor reason.
no  need for higher-end hosting
i chose php too for all the reasons that you have mentioned.
i am coming from a desktop app perspective and couldn't imagine doing my work entirely in python, but i'm also not that experienced in it.

all things being equal, i much prefer that all of us are working with the same frameworks and libraries.
if you’re looking to build wordpress plugins,  you’re going to be doing it in php.
in python land, the clear web framework winner is  django.
for all you know it might not even be python.
the good news is that the mistake  wasn’t fatal.
you did put things right :)
many people make the argument that php is a great choice of platform for startups because you can find a $9.99/month hosting provider that supports php.

here are some of the tradeoffs (php wins on some fronts, python in others), for those faced with the decision now.
this means that if i find a great python developer for the team  (more on this later), they’ve likely used django.
and as such, getting someone new up to speed  takes longer.
these tools pulled in website visitors, increased visibility of hubspot, and helped us get some interesting data that we used to benefit our core business.
because it was basically just me.
you want to forge a relationship with a language that will be long-lasting, rich and deep.

those languages are needed in the vast majority of programming jobs, so people who see coding as a means to a paycheck rather than a passion will (quite reasonably) learn one of them and work in it.

glad to see you've come over to the django side.
python just feels  more “natural” to me.
so, back to the title of this article: php is fantastically fun, but python is marriage material .
it's suitable for enterprise intranet and limited extranet applications.
in fact, many of the biggest open source projects out there, that you might consider leveraging, are based on php.
the good news  is that the company did very well despite these mistakes for two simple  reasons:  first, i didn’t makeawful choices — just  sub-optimal ones.
this means that if i find a great python developer for the team (more on this later), they’ve likely used django.
[side note: patrick, if you’re reading this, i’ll admit, you were right.
i don't code on the first date.
if you’re looking to build wordpress plugins, you’re going to be doing it in php.
i was lumping it in with .net because i know that java is heavily used in the enterprise.
the article was aptly titled,  “python vs. c#: business and technology tradeoffs”.
the learning curve is with the framework.
i think that’s a poor reason.
if the product can grow, the language is scalable, talent is available in wide swaths of the community, and there is robust third party development (frameworks, open source, cms, etc) then i would say go with what you know best.

back to why i chose php: main reasons were: 1)
posted by dharmesh shah on wed, oct 27, 2010
i wouldn’t fault people for solving for their  self-interest and preference.
it’svery hard to change  this decision.
i was working in hubspot labs.
and, that’s  awesome.
i think you are trying to push what you actually believe in rather than the fact.
at the time, i was trying to pick between c# and python for my then fledgling startup.
either you  need to know the language/platfrom from soup to nuts yourself — or  you need to have immediate access to people you can rely on, that do.
here are some of the tradeoffs (php wins on some fronts, python in others),  for those faced with the decision now.
if you’re interested, just drop me an email  at {dshah} @ {onstartups}{daht-com}.
therefore, pick a language that you and your team is comfortable with and focus on building the product that solves the solution.
i feel the same way about there being multiple frameworks in php.
on the one hand, this kind of competition is  good.
in the short to mid-term, that’s not a  particularly big problem.
yes, it’s nice to know that there are thousands of  hosting providers out there that all support php, and that you can get hosting  really cheap as a result.
but, some of the  arguments still apply, even if you’re earlier stage.
the author asserts, without explanation or elaboration, that c# was the wrong choice.
but then again all my knowledge, experience and pre-made ready-to-use code is in php - so why switch?
that will keep you happy and motivated.
one of the the early reasons i picked php, which is still true, is that it has become lingua franca on the web.
but, if you’re picking a language based  on spending $10/month vs. $50/month or $100/month — you’re focused  on the wrong thing.
posted on tuesday, november 16, 2010 at 12:13 pm by greg wilsononce again, awesome read...
i wrote a set of articles on the topic of choosing a language/platform — specifically for startups.
i'm a php programmer fighting to switch to python (which i already knew was better) for quite some time.
sarkissian -- answers.onstartups.com is an instance of the stack overflow software, isn't it?
i’ll attempt at answering some of those questions.
not all python fans are fad-focused elitists .
why php is fun and easy but python is marriage material
second, success in the early days of a startup is much  more about getting market validation and traction than anything else.
if you have questions about startups, you can find me and a bunch of other startup fanatics on the free q&a website: answers.onstartups.com current articles | rss feed i think a lot about choices and decisions at startups.
it’sparticularly bad when it comes to web frameworks.
posted on monday, november 01, 2010 at 6:33 pm by mikei get asked questions about one language over another all the time.
it’s about how reflection is  implemented.
by “within  reason”, i mean if what you know is a relatively mainstream language  (python, php, ruby, java, c# etc.).
by the way, if you’re a gifted  python developer in the boston area and looking to join what is quite  possibly the best company to work for in boston (we won an award, so it  must be true), would love to connect.
i'm impressed with it's capability and the community is awesome.
posted on tuesday, november 02, 2010 at 4:33 am by seunwebin my opinion the point really being made here isn't that one is simply a better language than the other but what is more sustainable as a platform in the long run to scale-up a startup's operations.
it’s about how reflection is implemented.
there isn't always one 'best ' solution but more importantly use the proper tool to solve the problem.
posted on wednesday, october 27, 2010 at 5:46 pm by mike schinkelyour new hubspot labs logo is really cool.
it's noteworthy that at the end of the day if you're just trying to get your solution up and running go with just about any platform you're comfortable with rather than having to add another layer of learning i.e. other than marketing, finance etc.
they’re not trying to talk you into switching, they’re just saying thatit matters to them.
it’s easy-going, fun, and you feel super-productive (especially if you’re making a big change to something new).
at the end of the day they all have their pros and cons, it really comes down to what you have the most experience with.
as a “classically trained” developer (undergrad compsci), i appreciate that python gets a bunch of the language stuff “right”.
but i find it telling that the django guys don't try to redefine the term "mvc".
in a startup every thought should be on maximum return on investment, and i cannot see anything in your post to indicate that was on your mind which leads me to believe that yes you were indeed "fad-focused".
since you’re really good, and demand for great developers always exceeds supply, you essentially get to pick where you want to work.
(i’m talking about php 5+ here — and ignoring all the ugliness that came before).
many  people make the argument that php is a great choice of platform for startups  because you can find a $9.99/month hosting provider that supports php.
it might be different if you're setting up a site from scratch..
the decisions that are hardest arenot the ones where you have the  least amount of information — they are the ones that are  hardest to undo or reverse.
all  things being equal, i much prefer that all of us are working with the same  frameworks and libraries.
the fact that i can use python in so many ways makes it so much more valuable.
i once read a blog post where someone said "asp.net doesn't let you build 'web' apps, it lets you build asp.net apps that just so happen to live on the web."
the deadhead in me thinks it looks like a bong.
at the time, i was trying to pick between c#  and python for my then fledgling startup.
i  was working in hubspot labs.
some reasonable open source well supported cms are available in php.
i've been using php for almost 5 years and i love a lot about it, mainly the oop.
within reason, my general advice is “go with what you know”.
i don't ask because i'm a fan of it, because i chose specifically to move away from the ms technology stack, but i'm curious to see someone else's perspective on it who wasn't influenced by having actually worked at ms (like me.)
by the way, in case you didn’t know, i’m the founder/cto at hubspot, and an all-around nice guy.

the reality is that all the languages mentioned have been used to develop successfull business's.
all things being equal, you’re going to pick the place that is doing python vs. php.
that is the  life of a software entrerpreneur:  it’s a stready stream of  hard work, occasionally punctuated by some really hard decisions.
so, knowing php is a very, very useful thing.
at the time all this was happening, i was trying to  decide between php, python and ruby.
right now the world is mostly in php and that's what i've got the most experience in.
i knew i wanted a dynamic language,
it’svery hard to change this decision.
[side note: patrick, if you’re reading this,  i’ll admit, you were right.
lets say  you were on the outside looking in (i.e. you’re a gifted developer  looking to join a cool new startup).
if the site does kick off though i could see having to rewrite it in a more robust language.
what i constantly found myself having problems with was the amount of inconsistencies in the prebuilt libraries and modules that we as a shop ended up using.
yes, sometimes the prebuilt stuff makes it easy, but as the latest comment prior to mine stated, python has now deprecated the current revision of python that is the only compatible version with django.
yes, php sometimes probably involves a bit more programming *sometimes*, but i find that the python programmer is one who is a)lazy and b)enjoys coming up with impossible to track down code using highly ingenious solutions to solve the most menial problems ever.
at the time all this was happening, i was trying to decide between php, python and ruby.
a language that brings the best out in you  — over the long-term.
don’t want to start yet another  language war, but i’m fascinated by the topic of making hard decisions at  startups, and this is one of the hardest.
it’s theother stuff — which is deeper and more  nuanced.
but that's likely related to my c/c++  background.
and, if there are any arguments you’d make on either side (php or python), would love to hear them.
no need for higher-end hosting and you save money.

these  tools pulled in website visitors, increased visibility of hubspot,  and helped us get some interesting data that we used to benefit our  core business.
and, fragmentation is bad.
the language served me well.
but, the idea was to  build cool free tools (seehttp://grader.com).
that ended up being longer than i expected.

the good news is that the company did very well despite these mistakes for two simple reasons: first, i didn’t makeawful choices — just sub-optimal ones.
i can get over that pretty quickly.

the learning curve these days is not a new language (it takes a proficient programmer just a few days to get her arms around the basics of a new language).
don’t want to start yet another language war, but i’m fascinated by the topic of making hard decisions at startups, and this is one of the hardest.
here’s the story of how i made notone but two big language/platform decisions, neither of which really worked  out — and which i’m now paying the price for.
of course, not all things  are equal, and you might actually pick the startup whose business you think has  the best chances of success or whose founders you like and respect.
during my 2+ years of php development, i launched a bunch of web  applications.
either you need to know the language/platfrom from soup to nuts yourself — or you need to have immediate access to people you can rely on, that do.
,  it’s notbetter enough to warrant switching.
lets say you were on the outside looking in (i.e. you’re a gifted developer looking to join a cool new startup).
but, some of the arguments still apply, even if you’re earlier stage.
my advice is  that even if you do decide to go with python — be at least  “reasonably fluent” in php — it’ll come in handy.
it is a personal choice based on the qualities of a language that appeal to you (verbosity and strong typing in my case) and that work for you in terms of your own productivity.
but, if there are a bunch of different frameworks floating around, the odds that any given person is working in the same framework you are lower.
in the early days of a startup, you’re looking to mitigate unnecessary risk and get to market as fast as humanly possible.
the good news is that the mistake wasn’t fatal.
sometimes i have good days,  and sometimes i have great days.

we don’t have a written charter for hubspot labs (because frankly, i’m not exactly sure how to write one of those, or if i did, who would read it).
any experienced developer that can create great  software can likely also write really good software in php.
maybe not quite as dominant as rails in ruby-land — but close.
the reason related to corba, the beast which had to be tamed, but which perl just couldn't deal with.

i picked php, and python was my second choice.
though, if i had experience in another language i sure i would have chosen it.
so, you might then be wondering, why switch away from php and move to  python now?
if someone releases a new api, and  provides a “wrapper” for convenience, the first language supported  will likely be php.
it’s theother stuff — which is deeper and more nuanced.
and this is to address what those who say"technology choice isn't important, it's execution that's important."
and, as it turns out, customers really don’t care whether your saas  application is built in php, c#, ruby or python.

really hard to justify the change, because though you might grudgingly admit that python is better, it’s notbetter enough to warrant switching.
because they are not using it as buzzword in the first place, unlike all the php frameworks.

halligan"if i had a dog, the dog would bark at the ruby code."
php is lingua franca in the world of the web.
note:  the context here is a  startup that is a bit further along (hubspot was 2 years old and had about  50 employees at the time of this decision).
[note:  i still  am viscerally troubled by the using whitespace to indicate code structure,  instead of just using braces like the rest of the sane world, but it’s a  relatively minor gripe].

python mostly has that with django.
sometimes i have good days, and sometimes i have great days.
clearly language choice does not depend on how good you are as a programmer or how passionate you are about the craft of software design.
you want to forge a relationship with a language that will be  long-lasting, rich and deep.
but, there are limits.
i did a little test run with python and appengine(horrible choice by the way).
i prefer python because i hate to press a lot of key (shift+[ = {) and python is easier to read.
i’m not particularly  bothered by the weird idiosyncracies of php (the “needle vs.  haystack” problem).
i’m paraphrasing a bit, but that’s the gist of it.
if you made it this far, thanks for reading!
but, if you’re picking a language based on spending $10/month vs. $50/month or $100/month — you’re focused on the wrong thing.
of course the invterview process would take quite a bit more skill and time to weed out all the bad ones.
posted on monday, november 01, 2010 at 3:53 am by rami've spent a lot of time in php, and just enough time in python to realize that i don't like the amount of "magic" that python forces the developers to rely on.
contrast that to php where we have symfony, zend, codeigniter, kohana  — and others.
i’m not particularly bothered by the weird idiosyncracies of php (the “needle vs. haystack” problem).
whew!  that ended up being longer than i expected.
billplease let us know about what your view are on c# in follow up to your statement "so, i picked c# and .net — which frankly, if i had to do over, i wouldn’t have picked (more on that later)."!!!
did i give in to peer pressure or somehow decide i wanted one more chance at being one of the “cool kids”.
it was  an easy transition from my c++/c# days, and combined with an mvc framework like  codeigniter, things weren’t too bad.
if you’re interested, just drop me an email at {dshah} @ {onstartups}{daht-com}.
although php  is a completelyworkable language — it’s still not an  elegant language.

it’s close to the de-facto choice for web frameworks in python.
apologies for the strained metaphor, but it resonated with me.
i wouldn’t fault people for solving for their self-interest and preference.

this is a time vs experience issue.
i am talking about django framework vs one of the php frameworks.
low-end web hosting is a non-issue.
everything he said about the company was appealing (good use of social media, smart concept, and great use of tools as marketing) but that stack choice stuck out in my mind the most.

though ruby/rails would likely have been fine too, there’s something about it that i just found unnatural.
on the one hand, this kind of competition is good.
apologies for the strained metaphor, but it resonated with  me.
3) there were lots of other people using it.
although it’s perfectly possible to write good code in php, it’s much easier to write great code in python .
but, if there are a bunch of different frameworks  floating around, the odds that any given person is working in the same  framework you are lower.
it’s all the little things, which in aggregate, make for better cleaner, more elegant code.
posted on saturday, november 13, 2010 at 4:08 am by hiimleathif you're using python for web apps, you should definitely check out web2py.
they are right about the latter but not about the former, and in part it's because the former relates to the latter in ways they were probably not considering.
by the way, in case you didn’t  know, i’m the founder/cto at hubspot, and an all-around nice guy.
python just feels more “natural” to me.
low learning are less important than high  ceilings.
[note: i still am viscerally troubled by the using whitespace to indicate code structure, instead of just using braces like the rest of the sane world, but it’s a relatively minor gripe].
though ruby/rails would likely have been  fine too, there’s something about it that i just found unnatural.
i picked php, and  python was my second choice.
frameworks have an upfront cost, but provide a ton of  value long-term.
i’m paraphrasing a bit, but that’s the gist  of it.
hubspot labs is a  “startup within a startup”.
don’t get me wrong, ilove frameworks (dating back all the way to the object windows library that borland had for turbopascal).
my advice is that even if you do decide to go with python — be at least “reasonably fluent” in php — it’ll come in handy.
also i can't agree with tom leys more.
it is clear that python was architected to be a  robust, well-designed and well thought-out language.
and, you can find me on google+
my advice:   recognize that there are things like amazon ec2 out there now, and over time,  it’s going to be just as easy to spin up servers for python as it is for  php.
one  of the the early reasons i picked php, which is still true, is that it has  become lingua franca on the web.
python has a “clear” web framework winner: although conceptually i like having choices (and i believe in  openness), practically, i really,really like standards.
did i give in to peer pressure or somehow decide i wanted one more chance at  being one of the “cool kids”.
the  learning curve these days is not a new language (it takes a proficient  programmer just a few days to get her arms around the basics of  a new language).
perhaps next year, right?
apologies for the strained metaphor here  — but it had some resonance for me.
it is clear that python was architected to be a robust, well-designed and well thought-out language.
don’t i have better things to do with my time?
that’s just not a lot of money.
python allows for very bad code to be written fast and easily.
since i'm going to get into a long-term relationship with a language, i figured python's a pretty good bet.
posted on wednesday, october 27, 2010 at 4:26 pm by david semeriai'm curious (especially because i thought you were going to expand on why, you now regret having chosen c# and .net.
by “within reason”, i mean if what you know is a relatively mainstream language (python, php, ruby, java, c# etc.).
the deeper and richer the framework is, the more there is to learn.
why hubspot labs is switching from php to python
so to start off the block in quick time, with minimal resources, it is kinda hard to look the other way :)

during my 2+ years of php development, i launched a bunch of web applications.
in the short to mid-term, that’s not a particularly big problem.
that is the life of a software entrerpreneur: it’s a stready stream of hard work, occasionally punctuated by some really hard decisions.
a language that brings the best out in you — over the long-term.
hubspot labs is a “startup within a startup”.
although php is a completelyworkable language — it’s still not an elegant language.
a couple of years later, i was faced with a different decision.
there were lots of other people using it.
and as such, getting someone new up to speed takes longer.
however, the more i work in python it appears the maintainability of a python application will be much easier.
not to knock php (i actuallylove working in  php) — but python is just a better language.
posted on tuesday, november 02, 2010 at 9:46 pm by hsekhonin my opinion, c# is good to develop desktop application, php and python is good to make web application.
my advice: recognize that there are things like amazon ec2 out there now, and over time, it’s going to be just as easy to spin up servers for python as it is for php.

get the solution out there, mature it, reassess when scaling up and go with the platform that suits your needs the best.
but, the idea was to build cool free tools (seehttp://grader.com).

some languages, like php, have very low learning curves  — it’s super-easy to get started.
php....agreed...easy to learn posted on wednesday, october 27, 2010 at 9:42 pm by chuksi'm curious if you ever considered anything besides django for python.
if that were the case then not only python but all the other good languages would be "great".
seems like there have been other sites with extremely high traffic that have either redesigned on another language or added code to turbo boost php.

posted on monday, november 08, 2010 at 9:42 am by dave m.please write the follow up article on c# vs. python - we're about to make this very decision and currently leaning to c# (for the same reason you made your original decision) posted on tuesday, november 09, 2010 at 10:28 pm by jonafter previously commenting i'm returning to comment again because i just got an email that reminded me of one of the key reasons why php or python are much better for most startups than c# or java.
other costs, as you mentioned, are minimal compared with the cost of learning new languages and frameworks for a single founder.
i can't tell you the number of times i spent hours in one rabbit whole, only to ask and find out that the problem was actually somewhere entirely different and really would never have looked there unless i just knew that was where to look.
but, i’m to advocate for some empathy here.
of course, not all things are equal, and you might actually pick the startup whose business you think has the best chances of success or whose founders you like and respect.
they won't apply for a job at a company using python because it would be a waste of time for them to invest in learning the language.
if someone releases a new api, and provides a “wrapper” for convenience, the first language supported will likely be php.
lets  say you’re something like me:  you’ve learned php and used it  to build and launch “real world” apps.
although it does appear that out-looking-in that java is similar to .net (the local java user group in atlanta is all enterprise focused, for example) truth-be-told i don't have enough relevant experience in the java ecosystems to speak with any authority on it.
i’ll attempt at answering  some of those questions.
posted on thursday, october 28, 2010 at 10:40 am by pebbiei've never tried django, so have no comparison to contribute.
to me, django appears to have that same allure of php (a low learning curve), but when you get past the dating period, you wish you had more flexibility.
python has a “clear” web framework winner: although conceptually i like having choices (and i believe in openness), practically, i really,really like standards.
but,  often, it’s hard to know that stuff upfront, so you focus on what you do know — that developing in python’s a better  “bet”.
so, you might then be wondering, why switch away from php and move to python now?
it was an easy transition from my c++/c# days, and combined with an mvc framework like codeigniter, things weren’t too bad.
one of the arguments i hear continually online goes something like this: “php is a perfectly fine language, and folks pushing python are just fad-focused elitists that want to work on the latest cool new thing, instead of just picking what works and focusing on building apps that solve customer problems.”
i  wrote a set of articles on the topic of choosing a language/platform —  specifically for startups.
since i'm  going to get into a long-term relationship with a language, i figured python's  a pretty good bet.

this article touched on a lot of points we, developers are thinking but would never say due to being flamed by our peers.
lets say you’re something like me: you’ve learned php and used it to build and launch “real world” apps.
i made some pretty good arguments in that article, most of which i still stand behind to this day.
i'm a php developer for the most part, but a skeptic forever, and this kind of writing is always interesting to me.
some languages, like php, have very low learning curves — it’s super-easy to get started.
they’re not trying to talk you into  switching, they’re just saying thatit matters to them.
posted on wednesday, october 27, 2010 at 8:32 pm by carlos acciolyphp vs. python?
i'm not a programmer myself, but do dabble in it sometimes and the idea that php have lots of open source and freely available code, makes you want to go back to it again and again.
back to why i chose php: main  reasons were: 1)
that makes life  much easier.
note: the context here is a startup that is a bit further along (hubspot was 2 years old and had about 50 employees at the time of this decision).
the  deeper and richer the framework is, the more there is to learn.
i've had to maintain someone else's python (or cr*p as i like to call it) code.
on with my story… when i kicked off my startup, hubspot, over 4 years ago (june, 2006)
we ended up picking c# at the time.
but then i found bottle, now i am becoming lazier to open my php code than to write and experiment using bottle.
twice now, i've looked into php and gotten annoyed and sidetracked by the fragmented framework-space.
there are definitely times to  learn new things and experiment with new technologies — the early  days of your product development is not the best time.
i’m sure they’re all great frameworks (i use  codeigniter right now), but the fact that there’s no clear winner means  that the market is fragmented.
posted on monday, november 01, 2010 at 9:14 pm by adamfinding a good platform is very critical at start up.
assuming that you stick with your low-cost provider  for 18 months (a long time in startup-land), you’ll havemaybe saved $900.
you’ve  got a startup to grow, you can’t be bothered with trying to join the cool  kids.
all things being equal, you’re going to  pick the place that is doing python vs. php.
it had decent oop  support.
it was lingua franca on the web.
i think you just pushed me to commit some time to django.
really hard to justify  the change, because though you might grudgingly admit that python is better
we don’t have a written  charter for hubspot labs (because frankly, i’m not exactly sure how to  write one of those, or if i did, who would read it).
if you’re in the software development business as  a career choice (i.e. you’re going to do it for a long time), then the  larger consideration should be what’s going to create the most value for  you long-term.
it’s  all the little things, which in aggregate, make for better cleaner, more elegant code.
posted on thursday, october 28, 2010 at 9:58 am by gilesafter reading your article, and enjoying it, i'm trying to find one solid business reason for doing the unthinkable in a startup business environment, switching programming languages after having significant investment in another.
i choose php because it seemed like the shortest learning curve, tons of information available (manuals, sample code, forums, user community etc.. though this is probably true with most other languages as well), and the easiest to get started on to bring up a version 1/working prototype.
by this defintiion, picking the language/platform to use at a startup is  one of the harder decisions.

within reason, my general advice  is  “go with what you know”.

although it’s perfectly possible to  write good code in php, it’s much easier to write great code in python .
for you, the cost of change is high (maybe even prohibitively high).
would love to see what the issues are with c# and website development.
that makes life much easier.
