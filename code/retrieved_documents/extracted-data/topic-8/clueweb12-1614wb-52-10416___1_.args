they can help you harness the full potential of search through their enterprise solr development platform—lucidworks enterprise—which can make your production process simpler and more cost-efficient with open source configurability.you can use them for tasks like spam detection and sentiment analysis.phonetics phonetic algorithms are also provided to determine what words sound like and compare them accordingly.each algorithm produces a number indicating its perception of similarity, but each is determined differently and can even move in opposite directions.this allows the consumer to perform custom tokenization and stemming if any at all.tf*idf tf*idf weights can be used to judge how important a given word is to a given document in a broader corpus (collection of documents).many of the algorithms have additional parameters that can be used to tweak their operation and a few modules weren't represented at all, but the official readme can help fill that gap.many of the algorithms have additional parameters that can be used to tweak their operation and a few modules weren't represented at all, but the official readme can help fill that gap.consider the following code which adds a few documents to a corpus and then determines how important the words "ruby" and "node" are to them.similarly the classifier can be trained on arrays rather than strings, bypassing tokenization and stemming.the following example shows each algorithm's perception of the difference between the words "execution" and "intention".initially i didn't think "natural" could be as complete as the nltk, but as my own understanding as well as community contributions picked up i've become much more hopeful.[ 'i', 'stem', 'word' ] all of the code above would also work with a lancaster stemmer by requiring the lancasterstemmer module instead, like: var natural = require('natural'), stemmer = natural.to guarantee that a frequently-used, albeit semantically less important, word doesn't gain too much favor you'll want to ensure you have many documents in your tfidf clone.the above code returns the following output: stem stem stem stem for convenience stemmers can patch string with methods to simplify the process by calling the attach method.
