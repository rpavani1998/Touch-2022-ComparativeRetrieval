indeed most  developers consider something fast to be difficult to implement, but  that’s not the case of merge sort.
however this is not so difficult.
although i don’t think this can be the main reason why not to use merge sort some people say that it can be difficult to implement for beginners, especially the merge part of the algorithm.
i am interested in  any webpage optimizations techniques - for a faster web!
the problem with these three algorithms is that  their complexity is o(n2) so they are very slow.

obviously it will be better if we divide the list into two sub-lists with equal length and then sort them.
slower than insertion and bubble sort for nearly sorted input again it is very important to know the input data.

this, of course, is not the best approach and we don’t need to do that.

slower than non-comparison based algorithms merge sort is however based on the comparison model and as such can be  slower than algorithms not based on comparisons that can sort data in linear  time.
after sorting the smaller lists, which is supposed to be easier than sorting the entire initial list, we can try to merge the result into one sorted list.

merge sort is a comparison model sorting algorithm based on the “divide and conquer” principle.
here’s a recursive version of merge sort.
here’s the implementation in php.
note that in the  best case insertion and bubble sort complexity is o(n), while merge  sort’s best case is o(n*log(n)).
so we can be sure that merge sort is very stable no matter the input.
then somehow  we can merge the results of the solved problems.
this technique is typically known as “divide and conquer”.
of course, this depends on the input data, so we must be careful of the input.
instead we can try to divide the list into smaller lists and then sort them.
note that even quicksort’s complexity is o(n2) in the worst  case, which for n = 20 is about 4.6 times slower!
