because the input is so important for an algorithm's efficiency, we may ask if there are any sorting algorithms that are faster than o(n.log(n)), which is the average-case complexity for merge sort and quicksort.
view full user profile algorithm of the week: radix sort 03.20.2012 email views: 5457 tweet this content is part of the python zone, which is presented to you by dzone andnew relic.
for input that is almost sorted, insertion sort may be preferred instead of quicksort, which is generally a faster algorithm.
because it consists only of integers and because array keys are integers in programming languages we can implement radix sort.
this algorithm is very useful in practice because in practice we often sort sets of integers.
on the other hand, quicksort is considered one of the best general purpose sorting algorithms, but while it’s a great algorithm when the data is randomized, it’s practically as slow as bubble sort when the input is almost or fully sorted.

indeed, php is flexible enough to build-up arrays in the memory without knowing their size in advance.
and the answer is yes there are faster, linear complexity algorithms, that can sort data faster than quicksort, merge sort and heapsort.
the python zone is sponsored bynew relic, the all-in-one web application performance tool that lets yousee performance from the end user experience, through servers, and down to the line of application code.
indeed,insertion and bubble sort are considered slow, with a best-case complexity of o(n2), but they are quite effective when the input is fairly sorted.
requires additional space radix sort needs additional space – at least as much as the input.
this dzone refcard provides an in depth introduction to the cloud computing technology, google app engine.
because it consists only of integers and because array keys are integers in programming languages we can implement radix sort.
we may think that our input consists only of integers and we can go for radix sort, but what if in the future someone passes floats or strings to our routine.
radix sort is very fast compared to other sorting algorithms as we saw on the diagram above.
fortunately, modern programming languages and libraries are more flexible so we can initialize our temporary array even if we don’t know the interval of input values, as in the example bellow.
works only with integers if you’re not sure about the input, you're better off not using radix sort.
the thing is that old-school programming languages weren’t very flexible and we needed to initialize the entire temporary array.
such an algorithm that is capable of sorting data in linear o(n) time is radix sort and the domain of the input is restricted – it must consist only of integers.
you can read more from them attheir website.
new relic provides the resources and best practices to help you monitor these applications.
dzone has great portals for python, cloud, nosql , andhtml5!
even a beginner can understand and implement radix sort, which is great.

after “initializing” the temporary array with one pass (with linear complexity) we can sort the input.
so, when you have a sorted array and you add some “new” values to the array you can sort it quite effectively with insertion sort.

implementing radix sort is in fact very easy, which is great.

it’s fast radix sort is very fast compared to other sorting algorithms as we saw on the diagram above.
that is a great benefit in performance compared to o(n.log(n)) or even worse with o(n2) as we can see in the following chart.
it’s easy to understand and implement even a beginner can understand and implement radix sort, which is great.
this is when we get some data from the db based on primary keys – typically primary in database tables are integers as well.
and the answer is yes there are faster, linear complexity algorithms, that can sort data faster than quicksort, merge sort and heapsort.
we saw that general purpose sorting algorithms like insertion sort, bubble sort andquicksort can be very efficient in some cases and inefficient in others.

and it is so cool that it is also easy to implement.

so practically there are lots of cases of sorting integers, so radix sort may be one very, very useful algorithm and it is so cool that it is also easy to implement.
