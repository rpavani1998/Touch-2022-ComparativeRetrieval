my suggested link includes an alternative description of tuples, described on their own rather than based on a comparison.
this article is an overview  comparison and not a definitive specification of lists, tuples and  dictionaries.
a tuple is much more efficient in use, and there are many occasions you want to set up a collection of objects in order (an "ordered collection") and refer to it many times later on.
if you set up a large collection (for  example a list that contains all ten thousand lines from a data file), you're  occupying computer memory ... and if the only thing you then do with it is  process each element once, it's not efficient.
