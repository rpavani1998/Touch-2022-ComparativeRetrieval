php competes with visual basic and c++ as the third most popular programming language behind java and c, based on world wide availability of practitioners, courses and vendors.php can be used with a large number of relational database management systems, runs on all of the most popular web servers and is available for many different operating systems.this flexibility means that php has a wide installation base across the internet; over 18 million internet domains are currently hosted on servers with php installed.this technology allows the user of a web browser to execute a program on the web server, and to thereby receive dynamic as well as static content.php 5 included new features such as: robust support for object-oriented programming (or oop) through php data objects performance enhancements taking advantage of the new engine better support for mysql through a completely rewritten extension better xml support through a suite of interoperable tools embedded support for sqliteprogrammers used scripting languages with these programs because of their ability to manipulate text streams easily and efficiently, even when they originate from disparate sources.while running the php parser with a web server and web browser, the php model can be compared to other server-side scripting languages such as microsoft's asp.net system, adobe coldfusion, sun microsystems' javaserver pages, zope, mod_perl and the ruby on rails framework, as they all provide dynamic content to the client from a web server.though the originators of these open source programs did not design them all to work specifically with each other, the combination has become popular because of its low acquisition cost and because of the ubiquity of its components (which come bundled with most current linux distributions particularly as deployed by isps).php 5 included new features such as: - robust support for object-oriented programming (or oop) through php data objects - performance enhancements taking advantage of the new engine - better support for mysql through a completely rewritten extension - better xml support through a suite of interoperable tools - embedded support for sqlite - integrated soap support - data iterators - error handling through exceptions the latest version as of october 2006 is php 5.1.6.- client-side gui applications php provides bindings to gui libraries such as gtk+ and text mode libraries like ncurses in order to facilitate development of a broader range of cross-platform gui applications.- server-side scripting originally designed to create dynamic web pages, server-side scripting is the principal focus for php.they also founded zend technologies in ramat gan, israel, which is actively involved with php development.the article aimed to show that a bundle of free software could provide a viable alternative to commercial packages.- command-line scripting php also provides a command line interface sapi for developing shell and desktop applications, log parsing, or other system administration tasks.lerdorf initially created php to display his résumé and to collect certain data, such as how much traffic his page was receiving.
