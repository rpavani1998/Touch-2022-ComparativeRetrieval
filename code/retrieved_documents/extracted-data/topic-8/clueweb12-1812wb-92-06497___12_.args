but would improve health, improve the environment and create new economic activity.lastly, the cost of carbon fuels can only go up and will only become more unreliable, and so any straight comparison between carbon fuels and solar energy should take that into account as well.to save wood, especially since charcoal is made of wood, it’s more efficient to produce on a large scale.this means things can be done that wouldn’t make economic sense if we were paying for fuel.also important to note is that there’s little damage to the machine from using it more rather than less (and no damage that can’t be repaired locally).for instance, a small magnifying glass can also focus the sun’s light and also reaches temperatures of over 300 c° ... but it would take a long, long time to boil a liter of water.large oven’s and maximum efficiency are therefore of less concern, there’s little disadvantage to produce on a small solar scale for rainy days.if a vesta earns or saves 25 euros a day by creating an opportunity that wouldn’t otherwise exist, let’s say in tourism, that’s 9125if a vesta earns or saves 25 euros a day by creating an opportunity that wouldn’t otherwise exist, let’s say in tourism, that’s 9125 euros in one year and 182 500 euros over 20 years: far, far more than the initial cost of the machine.because the vesta does not depend on electricity or gas, it can go where electricity and gas cannot, and so the possibilities are out there.a commercial electric stove or small gas burner can take as much as 10 minutes to boil a liter of water, and an open wood fire even more (not counting the time it takes to collect the wood and make the fire).efficiency the efficiency of a solar machine tells you how much of the incoming solar energy is actually put to use.this sort of data can usually be gotten from a national environmental or wheater agency.the idea behind the vesta is to reach easily reach 200 c° with a significant amount of power yet still be local and rugged.it takes 6 times more energy to evaporate watter than to bring it to boil, and so to arrive at a roiling boil (water evaporating on the bottom and bubbling up) will take good fraction longer than to simply bring the water to boil (water evaporating only on the surface).
