this means that audit, hinting, and verification schemes can use the django model as a point of reference.there are some differences between evolutions and migrations, mainly due to the fact that django is model-centric, meaning that you define the attributes of your models in the code and generate the database from that.it puts a nice domain specific language on top of hibernate to make using hibernate even easier.my theory is that we are at a point with java where we can build applications with the same level of productivity as any other framework.annotations and generics are making life easier.the language is succinct and powerful, it almost feels like writing psuedo code, except that it actually works.i'm not a big fan of developing with php, and i was hoping to start doing some custom things with my site, so i switched to typo, so that my site would be running ror, and i could make my own extensions using ror.i do most of my programming in java, so i came to the realization that there are great things about python, django, ruby and rails, but java, stripes, hibernate and friends have advantages too.the other nice thing about grails is that it leverages all the existing java frameworks, such asspring and hibernate.java the current leader in the web application framework space, has a declining approval rating from the general public, but still maintains support from members of the static typing party.choosing a web framework and programming language is like choosing a guitar.since i can't create a class in ruby and declare what type each property is, there is no way to automatically generate a database based on the model.the part where this analogy falls apart is that once you learn to play guitar, you can pick up any guitar and play, but just because you are a ruby on rails expert doesn't mean you can build a web site with java, and vice versa.since then, i've discovered a few major design flaws with ror, so i'm not writing any code in ror now.the current leader in the web application framework space, has a declining approval rating from the general public, but still maintains support from members of the static typing party.
