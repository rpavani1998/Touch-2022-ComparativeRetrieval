in contrast to relational databases, which rigidly require information to be stored in pre-defined tables, document-oriented databases are more free-flowing and flexible.javascript — a web scripting language used to enhance websites; it can make them more interactive without requiring a browser plugin.an ontology is similar to a taxonomy in that it is also a classification system with nodes or entities, but it is more complex and flexible because ontologies allow for non-hierarchical relationships.for instance, web development frameworks like ruby on rails (written in ruby, meaning programmers use ruby to do the “fill in the blanks” tasks) and django (written in python), have easy-to-use, built-in support for common web development tasks, such as reading and writing to a database, writing content in html, and so forth.cloud computing is appealing because companies can reduce the amount they spend on their own computer servers and software but can also quickly and easily expand as the company grows.this allows sites to validate users’ identities without having full access to their personal accounts.metadata helps to organize information online and make it machine-readable.html5 — the upcoming, powerful standard of hypertext markup language, which has added advanced interactive features, such as allowing video to be embedded on a web page.css, which was first introduced by the world wide web consortium in the late 1990s, helped eliminate the clumsy and often repetitive markup in the original html syntax.perl — a dynamic language that is often used to parse and sort information because of its powerful abilities in manipulating text.it is an alternative to xml that is more concise because, unlike xml, it is not a markup language that requires open and close tags.a playback option allows new users to get up to speed on projects and creates an environment that is both real-time and asynchronous.but it is more complex and flexible because ontologies allow for non-hierarchical relationships.apps for webos are developed using web standards (html, javascript and css), which means there is a low barrier to entry for web developers to create mobile apps for webos as compared to other mobile platforms.this enables developers to create applications that sort information based on geography, which can mean sorting by whether various places are within a certain county or pointing out the places that are geographically closest to the user.
