now python does have compiled bytecode, and it is possible to get an implementation of python that runs on a java vm or creates a standalone executable, but distributing a python program or library usually means distributing the source code.
if invoked like parse(text), it will default to 0 in the case of a parse failure; if invoked like parse(text, 1), it will default to another value, such as 1, and if invoked like parse(text, none), the result can be examined for a parse failure: it will hold an integer if parsing was successful and the (non-integer) value none in the case of failure.
c would be a scientific scalpel, molecular sharp: the most exacting precision you can get unless you go subatomic with assembler or machine language, but treacherously slippery and easy to cut yourself with, something like the scientific-use razor blades which came in a package labelled: "warning: knife is extremely sharp.
and people listed legitimate flaws with django and legitimate reasons they use other alternatives, but one developer got over thirty upvotes with a response of, "yeah, i am an honest guy, and the client wanted to charge by the hour.

and in fact the essay "why python?" in which eric raymond said that python's significant whitespace made the first impression of a "steaming pile of dinosaur dung", goes on to give python some singular compliments, saying of one particular good experience with python, "to say i was astonished would have been positively wallowing in understatement.
however, i do advocate the use of a serious, noteworthy "python++" framework and not the standard library alone: the cgi module works entirely as advertised, but the difference between python + django + pinax and just python with the cgi module is comparable to the difference between python with the cgi module and programming on bare metal in c.
flat is better than nested.
as opposed to c and c++ which are compiled to a standalone executable (or library, etc.), python is interpreted from a script's source file, or more precisely compiled to a bytecode.
for some python software such as cherrypy, if you make a change in one of your source files, the application immediately reloads it without needing separately quit and restart, making the feedback cycle even shorter and more responsive.
few features in python are absolutely unique, and python did not pioneer the concept of significant whitespace.
if you are going to make a web interface that allows the user to upload files, you don't want to say, "i don't know exactly how many the user will want, so i'm deciding five is probably enough;" you start with one file upload input and add a button that creates another file upload input, and lets the user keep adding as many files as are wanted.
if you want a social network and you use django and pinax, you don't have to reinvent the internal combustion engine either, or power steering, or antilock brakes, because they are all included in standard packages for a car or truck.
apply antiseptic and bandages to scratches sustained while removing shortening from cat's tail.
or, depending on context, you may create an interface that allows the user to upload at most one file as an avatar, or you may write an opinion survey in which uploading files does not make sense as part of the design.
this kind of thing is very appropriate in dealing with the web, where you should assume that input is inappropriate and possibly malicious until proven otherwise.

and this is a recipe to bake jr's teddy bear at 375 and then be left wondering why the house is so full of foul-smelling smoke: proper exception handling removes the teddy bear from the oven, repeatedly if need be, instead of just boldly ignoring problems that need to be addressed properly.
but it is not entirely easy to learn or read perl, and this is not just something that affects novices.
it would not be a surprise if ruby on rails or php developers were to look through this and find it speaks to how they can create a better user interface.
in working on the web, there may be ideal input that you intend, but both from a usability and a security perspective you need to be able to respond appropriately to input that was not what you intended.
because in python we are effectively "running the source code," this usually means a faster feedback cycle than the edit-compile-test process one uses in working with a c application.
this can mean that, even if we expect we will mainly just write code for the ideal case, we may have to write a significant amount of code for non-ideal cases.

the typing is so-called "duck typing": if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck, and we have already seen one instance of duck typing at work: if an integer computation overflows, python deftly substitutes another class that walks like the basic integer class and quacks like the basic integer class, but can handle millions of digits or more as long as you have enough memory and processor time.

python's standard library does come with its cgi module, and it is possible to write webapps with it, but using the cgi module and the standard library to implement a social networking site with all the common bells and whistles would take months or years.

it has been suggested that top-notch perl programmers are slightly more productive than top-notch python programmers, and if you were to speak a computer language natively, perl would be an excellent choice.
a trade language, such as hausa in nigeria and much of west africa, or swahili in much of east africa, may or may not have any native speakers at all, but it is an easy-to-learn language that you can use for basic needs with people who do not speak your native language.
probably the next step to internationalization after using unicode strings is, instead of storing the interface language in your code like: print u'please enter your email address below:' you would instead do string look-ups that would pull the appropriate translation: print translate(messages.
the code samples peppering this chapter are intended to simply illustrate basic features of the language; once you get up to speed, it's not so much that you'll have better ways of doing what that code does, as that you'll have better ways of avoiding doing that, using python more like a magic wand.
freeform formatting means that the compiler will accept all of the variations of the "internet user's drinking song" below as equivalent: for(i = 99; i > 0; ++i) {
it is also a daunting obstacle to adults who need to learn the many ways english speakers may say something to them.
web2py in particular cuts out one very daunting hurdle to new programmers: a command line with a steep learning curve.
com, besides being easy to type when you really mean python.
and people listed legitimate flaws with django and legitimate reasons they use other alternatives, but one developer got over thirty upvotes with a response of, "yeah, i am an honest guy, and the client wanted to charge by the hour.
add 1/3-cup milk, dash of salt, and boil, stirring constantly for 2 minutes.
(the teacher, seeing that he had the correct answer so quickly, assumed that the boy must have cheated and gave him a spanking as his just reward.)
u'curly' i will comment briefly that zero-based indices, while they are a common feature to most major languages, confuse newcomers: it takes a while for beginning programmers to gain the ingrained habit of "you don't start counting at 1; you start counting at 0."
if once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will.
take telephone away from billy and assure party on the line the call was a mistake.
another point about usability may be made by looking at "natural" languages, meaning the kinds of languages people speak (such as english), as opposed to computer languages and other languages that have been artificially created.
that's the only way he could've known what we needed, before we knew it ourselves.
c would be a scientific scalpel, molecular sharp: the most exacting precision you can get unless you go subatomic with assembler or machine language, but treacherously slippery and easy to cut yourself with, something like the scientific-use razor blades which came in a package labelled: "warning: knife is extremely sharp.
if you were born in the u.s. and grew up speaking english, you could presumably not just travel around your state but travel thousands of miles, traveling from state to state coast to coast all the while being able to buy food, fuel, lodging, and the like without language being an issue.
it is a truism that code is read many more times than it is written, and write-only code is very much "the dark side of code maintainability."
if you are going to make a web interface that allows the user to upload files, you don't want to say, "i don't know exactly how many the user will want, so i'm deciding five is probably enough;" you start with one file upload input and add a button that creates another file upload input, and lets the user keep adding as many files as are wanted.
there is a classic story in mathematics in which one famous mathematician, as a boy, was in class and the teacher wanted some time and so decided to give the students a time-consuming task to keep them busy.
a language like visual basic may be said to be the opposite on both counts, as making a very gentle start to programming, but not a good place to grow to be an expert programmer: the sort of place where you'll be constricted by the language's ceiling.
this code somewhat flexibly parses string/unicode input for an integer value, returning a default if it cannot be parsed.
explain to kids that you have no idea if shaved cats will sunburn.
java might be compared to the equipment owned by a construction company, equipment that allows large organizations and a well-organized army to erect something monumental.
but this way of solving things makes more sense in java than python; in java it is recommended practice to make most or all instance variables private and then define corresponding getters and setters, and perhaps build a counter class that let you guarantee it could only be incremented, read, and optionally reset.
with python + django + pinax the time is more like hours.
in python, comments are not there to make code understandable.
truer to the spirit of python would be to use an integer and avoid the work of creating a class, let alone accessor methods.
python's objects are in some ways like java and in some ways like javascript: python objects come from full-fledged classes like java, but are more dynamic: fields and methods can be deleted from a python object on the fly, like javascript, even though inheritance is classical and not prototypal.
but it is not entirely easy to learn or read perl, and this is not just something that affects novices.
and this is a recipe to bake jr's teddy bear at 375 and then be left wondering why the house is so full of foul-smelling smoke: proper exception handling removes the teddy bear from the oven, repeatedly if need be, instead of just boldly ignoring problems that need to be addressed properly.
org, is a famous porn site), and python's core library is your best friend.
the python community does not favor shows of cleverness in quite the same way; in fact, saying, "this code is clever," is a respectful and diplomatic way of saying, "you blew it."
visual basic is an easy trade language but a limited native language.
if your goal is an online store instead of a social network pinax will not likely be of much help, but django + satchmo will.
but the first one, the one with range(), creates a list with a staggering ten billion integers; a workstation with eight gigs of ram doesn't have nearly enough memory to hold the list, and if you try to run it, you may well observe your computer slow to a crawl as more and more memory is used just to create that one array.
(the teacher, seeing that he had the correct answer so quickly, assumed that the boy must have cheated and gave him a spanking as his just reward.)
perl, designed by a linguist, is a bit like english in this regard.
however, i do advocate the use of a serious, noteworthy "python++" framework and not the standard library alone: the cgi module works entirely as advertised, but the difference between python + django + pinax and just python with the cgi module is comparable to the difference between python with the cgi module and programming on bare metal in c.
the xoltar toolkit provides a module, functional, which is written in pure python, is largely self-documenting code, and provides tools and/or reference implementations for currying and other favorites.
a language like visual basic may be said to be the opposite on both counts, as making a very gentle start to programming, but not a good place to grow to be an expert programmer: the sort of place where you'll be constricted by the language's ceiling.
one way, which happens to be implemented by a tuple, is useful if you want to return (for instance) both a status code and a text description of the status.
a trade language, such as hausa in nigeria and much of west africa, or swahili in much of east africa, may or may not have any native speakers at all, but it is an easy-to-learn language that you can use for basic needs with people who do not speak your native language.
in python, a ternary operator like a > b and a or b can malfunction if its middle argument is falsy; it is more robust to write (a > b and [a] or [b])[0], at a significant cost to pythonic ease in reading and understanding.
one of the key features of a good trade language's job description is to be gentle to people who do not eat, sleep, and breathe it.
it has been suggested that top-notch perl programmers are slightly more productive than top-notch python programmers, and if you were to speak a computer language natively, perl would be an excellent choice.
perl is a vast native language and painfully vast as a trade language.
= u'curly' i will comment briefly that zero-based indices, while they are a common feature to most major languages, confuse newcomers: it takes a while for beginning programmers to gain the ingrained habit of "you don't start counting at 1; you start counting at 0."
a famous blog post called python is not java addresses java programmers rather bluntly on why doing everything you'd do in java is not getting the most out of python: essentially, if you've been using java for a while and are new to python, do not trust your instincts.
if you've given it years and years of hard work, perl breathes very attractively, a native language to love.
but python pulls off the delicate balancing act of working well as a trade language where a programmer can be productive very quickly after starting, and having room to grow for those programmers who are able to experience it more like a native language.
and in fact the essay "why python?" in which eric raymond said that python's significant whitespace made the first impression of a "steaming pile of dinosaur dung", goes on to give python some singular compliments, saying of one particular good experience with python, "to say i was astonished would have been positively wallowing in understatement."
probably the next step to internationalization after using unicode strings is, instead of storing the interface language in your code like: print u'please enter your email address below:' you would instead do string look-ups that would pull the appropriate translation: print translate(messages.
it's not just that the solution we have built works a bit more like java than python, but the problem we were addressing in the first place works more like java than python.
if you've given it years and years of hard work, perl breathes very attractively, a native language to love.
special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
in python, a ternary operator like a > b and a or b can malfunction if its middle argument is falsy; it is more robust to write (a > b and [a] or [b])[0], at a significant cost to pythonic ease in reading and understanding.
java might be compared to the equipment owned by a construction company, equipment that allows large organizations and a well-organized army to erect something monumental.
because in python we are effectively "running the source code," this usually means a faster feedback cycle than the edit-compile-test process one uses in working with a c application.
for the web, frameworks like django, turbogears, and web2py offer significantly greater power with less work in more truly pythonic fashion.
both of them provide ready-made solution to routine tasks, whether user avatars with gravatar support, or a shopping cart with that works with any of several payment gateways.
whatever brace styles python programmers may happen to use in languages with braces, all the python code looks the same, and while the major brace styles illustrated above are a few of many ways the c code could be laid out, there's only one real way to do it.
measure 1-tsp. salt & a cup nuts and beat all ingredients well.
(at a glance, afewwordsincamelcase look a bit more like a block of undifferentiated text than a_few_words_separated_by_underscores if you live and breathe english's alphabet, but if you have worked hard on english but its alphabet is still not your own, afewwordsincamelcase looks absolutely like a block of undifferentiated text next to a_few_words_separated_by_underscores.
or, depending on context, you may create an interface that allows the user to upload at most one file as an avatar, or you may write an opinion survey in which uploading files does not make sense as part of the design.
even if there are not ego issues involved, it's distracting.
if you write a web script that asks people to enter their age, and someone hits two keys at once and enters an age of u'22w', you need to be able to roll with it-and this is nothing next to what might happen if someone is acting maliciously.
i will not be attempting to provide select highlights from the core library because that would easily be a book in its own right.
if once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will.
a more pythonic example might be a simple way to list tags in a webpage.
if your goal is an online store instead of a social network pinax will not likely be of much help, but django + satchmo will.
because people are intelligent, you can write a recipe book and describe only the ideal case.
nigeria in africa is a country about the size of texas, and it doesn't have a native language; it has hundreds of them.
but there is another sense in which you may want a generator that can keep on returning values.
the dictionary is a like a list, but instead of the index automatically being a whole number, the index can be anything that is immutable.
the enormous english vocabulary with so many ways to say things, and the broad collection of idioms, are tremendous tools for the skilled english communicator.
for many people you meet, english would be their native language, too.
early exposure to fortran left an undeniably foul taste in eric raymond's mouth, and when he learned that python had significant whitespace, he repeatedly described python's first impression on him as "a steaming pile of dinosaur dung."
what i have heard consistently is that using a good library really does qualify as a move from "unadorned python" to "python++".
its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offence," or "you can tell how advanced of a society we live in when fortran is the language of supercomputers."
i would choose object oriented methodology over procedural for large projects, and procedural over object oriented for small to intermediate sized projects, with some tiny projects not even needing procedural structure.
if you have more than one pet, this method will place a line break between each sentence.
the best thing of all would be to just use spaces in variable names, but so far the language designers have not supported that route.
the enormous english vocabulary with so many ways to say things, and the broad collection of idioms, are tremendous tools for the skilled english communicator.

if you only type: result = int(input) your whole program will break on even an innocent typo like entering u'22w' when asked for their age.
a programmer's strength flows from code maintainability.
pretend that python is a magic wand that will miraculously do whatever you want without you needing to lifting a finger.
unlike a normal list where you should be able to get things in a fixed order, elements in a dictionary should not be expected to be in any particular order: nothing in the dictionary's job description says that it should give back first the name, then the phone number, then the email.
it is also a daunting obstacle to adults who need to learn the many ways english speakers may say something to them.
return default this code somewhat flexibly parses string/unicode input for an integer value, returning a default if it cannot be parsed.
i will not be attempting to provide select highlights from the core library because that would easily be a book in its own right.
the typing is so-called "duck typing": if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck, and we have already seen one instance of duck typing at work: if an integer computation overflows, python deftly substitutes another class that walks like the basic integer class and quacks like the basic integer class, but can handle millions of digits or more as long as you have enough memory and processor time.
(at a glance, afewwordsincamelcase look a bit more like a block of undifferentiated text than a_few_words_separated_by_underscores if you live and breathe english's alphabet, but if you have worked hard on english but its alphabet is still not your own, afewwordsincamelcase looks absolutely like a block of undifferentiated text next to a_few_words_separated_by_underscores.
apply antiseptic and bandages to scratches sustained while removing shortening from cat's tail.
programmers stand on one another's toes.
easily they flow, quick to join you when code you write.
and worse than the flaws of any one brace style are the flaws of a mix of brace styles and the fact that they seem to be tied to personal investment for programmers who care about writing code well.
for some python software such as cherrypy, if you make a change in one of your source files, the application immediately reloads it without needing separately quit and restart, making the feedback cycle even shorter and more responsive.
with that stated, it might be suggested that perl is the creation of a linguist, but a linguist who seemed not to be thinking about why a language like english is hard for adults to learn and, in its native form, is a terrible trade language.
and so the teacher told the students to add up the numbers from 1 to 100.
your instincts are tuned to java, not python.
the code samples peppering this chapter are intended to simply illustrate basic features of the language; once you get up to speed, it's not so much that you'll have better ways of doing what that code does, as that you'll have better ways of avoiding doing that, using python more like a magic wand.
quicker, easier, more seductive.
english has many things to appreciate as a native language, but these strengths are the opposite of what makes for a good trade language that adults can learn.
but deliberately lazy or inappropriately clever formatting isn't the real problem here either.
even if there are not ego issues involved, it's distracting.
