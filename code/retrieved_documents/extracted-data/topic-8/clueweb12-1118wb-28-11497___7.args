these "lesser people" may be accepted if they just keep quiet and do the "wiki chores" (e.g. despam, fix up tabs).
--davidliu helmut your observations about c2 is excellent and eventually i would like to copy it over to c2 for the benefit of the community there.
as to 3), i think costin is again not the only one who think i am inexperienced.
sunir has done a lot of work about the changes expected or needed within the scientific system.
i'm also not quite sure how i would incorporate this material into sunir's opening suggestions regarding how to brainstorm here at meatball, so i'm being a bit cautious for that reason too (especially, since i think i am more like you in that i may "prefer a more piecemeal approach").
i have managed to squeezed in a line or two in c2 wiki'wikisandbox to mention the sand 'box here for new users, in case they find c2 lock out from edits.
i think it would be more impolite to criticize their project at their home than here.
isn't it more holistic, to integrate the economic dimension into to all the more or less high-pitched reflexions, we do in the wikis.
it's still too early to know what will happen but i think it will be worthwhile anyway, either small and family-like or bigger, a signal of breakthrough.
the better the balance, the less it hurts.
a community can handle bans in a better way.
sunirshah thank you for writing wikicooperationarticle .
you want to care aboutwardswiki and therefore you do it, you invite people to discuss it.
some examples (most are german): all these wikis are running from the same wiki:prowikisoftware executable and are only configured for their different purposes and layouts.
helmutleitner helmut, i may be dense, but i don't see the problems the pages wikipediaisnottypical and wikipediaisnotanencyclopedia are meant to solve.
i meant it is not so easy to read from body language whether someone will be a good friend or fair partner.
:-) i hope, that you or some other friendly, appreciated, collaborative, constructive peer takes the free tlds wikicat?.com, .net, .. for being developed in someopenbusinesswiki like meatballwiki or whereever you suggest, such that we can help each other tocreateandsharewealth.
in real life, i could read his body language.
in real life, i could read his body language.
it is then very efficient to read this sis file through a hash to get at sister pages list.
but i think you can change the situation only from within.
davidcary hi helmut, after a long quiet, i went away and implemented a new cdml evaluator (lex/yacc based in python) which i'm using in cerenity (http://cerenity.org/ )- which hasn't had a very wide release yet, but is fun so far.
i think the realities more than the models are broken: solidarity is inner agreement, not external agreement.
-- fridemar i think it's the right thing to note such changes in the digest, but to mark them ascopyedits; that way, one can choose approximately the level of detail one wants onrecentchanges.
my biggest lament about the site is that the worst enemies of the site started out as enthusiastic supporters.
completely open and free communities are impossible, not because a community can't be open for difficult people, but because the community is then closed for people that haven't grown a skin 2 inched thick.
or the systems are not general enough to work for all in a multi-cultural society, or they are invaded by status-quo traditions, and so on ...
yes, i find it interesting and i'm happy that you find cdml as useful as i do.
unwelcome to come here and write nonsense like "da vinci was a robot expert !", yes, but he may be able to contribute well.
i did create a lot of c2 pages, typically of three kinds 1) appln & implementation related; 2) management and life strategy oriented; 3) wiki community & communication oriented material.
ironic as it was only a few days after i asked him whether hiswiki:wikichangepropoal can defend against a hostile costin.
the first is straightfoward: i need set up a wiki to contain the prince and keep him at a respectful distance from the princess.
part of the reason there's so much solidarity is because the entire society is based in perpetual struggle consciously undertaken -- comfort is explicitly not an aim of the society.
memehunting is just one kind of doing this, invent something and be positive, try to hype it.
i don't know whether he can contribute constructively or not, but i would like someone in this community to try to give him advise.
perhaps we can find one or another compromise, e.g.: at last in my humble opionion holds: if somebody destroys structure, built by work of another peer, s/he has the burden of proof (to prove that this makes sense and is welcome to the community), taking responsibility of this act.
so whatever happens, we are neither able to initiate it nor to control it.
but at the same time i did it in good faith and still think it was appropriate "at the time".
i think the majority of the contributors at c2 think "application development and implementation" mean writing compilers, devicing new perl scripts against newly identified exposures, intricate 3d game programming, etc.
meatball internals may be felt offtopic at c2, but that's not our business. --
--hanswobbe hans, i got an e-mail and found you on skype.
personally i dislike to talk about c2 in this situation, although i don't think it is inappropriate.
it might be helpful to leave generic queries to google, because this saves keystrokes to the peers, who want to explore the context and to elaborate shows possibly related work in other wikis (if camelcase queries are used) to connect with authors with a wiki blog, can leave their rich link support on their blog, allowing their peers to delete links in the base wiki, but with notifying, that the deleted links are still on the author's blog.
would be nice if we could meet.
--davidliu helmut your observations about c2 is excellent and eventually i would like to copy it over to c2 for the benefit of the community there.
meta-discussion were never loved by the c2 community, so that's why mb came into existance.
they are verbose and are waste of time.
that this is a highly competitive market and that it turned out to be less profitable than expected, that is a different story.
if he agrees to do so there, we can see whether he will be accepted by members atwardswiki.
only a small percentage of the members (who were primarily interested in software) were also interested in talking about wiki details.
jonas, years ago, i thought like you, positively, try to include everybody in our wikis, talk night long to convince people to go a cooperative path.
in any old system you wouldn't be allowed to do this, being "none of your business".
damanhur is not without it's problems: it's a lot of hard work, both inwardly and outwardly, and damanhurians put a high emphasis oncontinuity and finishing what you start -- backing out of projects freely chosen is strongly discouraged.
solidarity can be extended to another, but unless it is received and reciprocated, it can only be a glimpse of a future possibility.
i think you slightly hurt yourself by doing so.
people who are expecting contributions from "better qualified (academic) people" has been disappointed with my "quality of contributions".
i'm so glad that i got to meet you and hang out with you atwikisym.
often they pay by a loss of freedom, by being hierarchical or autocratic.
it is true that i only started "contributing in 2004", did not know a lot of "social norms" before i started to write, ask a lot of "basic technical (unix) questions " etc.
until now, most of us were conditioned, to have "a good feeling", when we contribute to wikis, although "this is paid badly", or in less euphemistic terms: "having a good feeling with unpaid work".
or the systems are not general enough to work for all in a multi-cultural society, or they are invaded by status-quo traditions, and so on ...
but i'm saying, if i were young again and were going to do a community again, it would not start with such rigid egalitarianism.
to check, that i have really bought the domains, click[4][5][6][7].
i currently use the method only for the 80 wikis on myprowiki servers.
i sent an email re a skype chat, but got a cryptic error message that indicated it might not have been transmitted.
openbusiness in wikis appears to be the advent of the vision of the cluetrainmanifesto.
i may take up invitation and copy (not transfer)your new pattern writeup to c2.interwiki does not seem to work as well yet.
i tell you, they will find and/or create asocialcommonwealth.
i asked ron about that and we have an e-mail exchange (this tendency towards backstage communications also bothers me).
i hear method acting classes are helpful.
i think that wallace shows a lack of social intelligence and it is not the goal of mb to teach people the basics of how to get along with each other.
i asked ron about that and we have an e-mail exchange (this tendency towards backstage communications also bothers me).
--nathanielthurstonit's actually very nice to see your "footprints" and to know that you still visit (if only every other month or so)!
with respect to your suggestions towards a kind of "polite-ical correctness" or towards new "standards of how to behave and structure our communication" i admit that i like to stick to common habits that have grown in this and other communities, as long as you are alone promoting them.
i am also checking email regularly via hwobbe@datafix.com --hanswobbe
the second project is the first task for the prince: creating a git underlayer for wikis.
-- lionkimbro lion, maybe i didn't express myself well enough.
all this isn't needed when communication is working.
if the mechanics of thenoosphere were understood, those people at the top of the power/property/status pyramid would use it to stay on top and secure the better part of the cake.
if they are looking for support, they may put up messages on several friendly-looking wikis.
memehunting is just one kind of doing this, invent something and be positive, try to hype it.
if a wiki participates it writes its page changes to sister site log files /sistersite/pagename.sis in the format "second[+|-]interwiki".
further, dreams are fundamental to the fabric of damanhurian reality, consciously cultivated, and the society reshaped to meet their fulfillment.
helmutleitner to sunir/helmut i apologize for getting people here upset for the meatball page i have created over there.
the communities represent the ideal form of union and communal living.
damanhur is fundamentally rooted insolidarity.
lastly on markparrot, i take it this community has not yet starteddissuadeinteraction, so my suggestion is actually for him to go to wardswiki and chair the wiki:meatballcommentary discussion which i have created and welcome him to participate.
i went to c2 and showed my face but there is little interest in what help i have to offer, so naturally i do not insist.
a barnstar does not even come close to letting me express my appreciation.
helmutleitner i'm less burnt out now.
it is true that i only started "contributing in 2004", did not know a lot of "social norms" before i started to write, ask a lot of "basic technical (unix) questions " etc.
note that discussing ra issues is difficult, because he is banned and the issue has not settled.
but at the same time i did it in good faith and still think it was appropriate "at the time".
(at this moment computer science oriented page are mainstream, followed by xp and maybe technical wiki implementation stuff).
i can talk most anytime during this month.
helmut, it would be a pity, if your cryptic shortdigest message, points to some problems beneath the surface.
the second project is the first task for the prince: creating a git underlayer for wikis.
it will be under some primarilypublicdomain or sharealike license just as soon as i get around to putting that notice there.
wed aug 26 18:13:38 2009 helmut, i noticed that spanish interface doesn't figure in properties of prowiki in wikimatrix.
even ctwocommentary is inappropriate.
if a wiki participates it writes its page changes to sister site log files /sistersite/pagename.sis in the format "second[+|-]interwiki".
i must go read some relevant pages and come to understand bit more.
i might go, but i'm not exactly wealthy, and i don't have a lot of money to blow between this and wikimania.
it is also a fact that the world is turning more and more into a casino-like economy, where reactions of an abstract market are unpredictable and people make their "bets" and hope for their luck.
it saves hijackingrecentchanges.
categoryhomepage helmut, i noticed that spanish interface doesn't figure in properties of prowiki in wikimatrix.
i'm also no a referee for c2.
since i have zero exposure to "open source" application development and appear to be "promoting" the much hated microsoft i am not winning new friends fast enough.
michaelsamuels michael, thank you for your work and for the information.
this solidarity is not visible and we understand no processes to grow it.
you are changing the very nature of wiki (c.f.whatisawiki), so the burden of proof is on you to prove that this makes sense and is welcome to the community.
it had no community feeling, more like people working on their projects, takaing notes side by side....
fortunately we know how much our common success depends on good teamwork, so it should not be a great problem to find a good compromise between self-expression and self-sacrifice.
i, and others, where just unable to cooperate with them and use this wiki and other wikis together without conflicts.
i would like to have a society in which we expect some people to have more than others.
i find this helps me word those things i really care about, much more carefully.
i agree with the recentchangesattentionseeking you observed.
i shouldn't have been so curt or quick to respond when my wits weren't fully with me.
i'll try to contact you as soon as i return for an actual conversation.
in that sense i agree with you - it is just as easy to read body language as written text.
if bandwidth is sufficient, we may turn on video.
--hanswobbe hello helmut, pondering about your cryptic message "openbusiness +=cat", suggesting that something is added toopenbusiness, i googled for it google:"openbusiness+=cat" no entry google:"+=cat" 425,000,000, i.e. 425 million entries
it seems that people don't talk to each other, often hide their identity - as if this behaviour is meant to protect them.
i should probably run a quick microphone test since i haven't used it in a while.
cerenity also only uses cdml for semantic or structural things, rather than simple markup, which i thought you might find interesting.
-- helmutleitner helmut, you know, that i programmed in c++ and other object-oriented c-dialects.
-- fridemar fridemar, it is a sad fact, that the meatballwiki community, however much we appreciate it and try to make it socially open, people from non-western-industrial countries or lower education don't join in.
it will be under some primarilypublicdomain or sharealike license just as soon as i get around to putting that notice there.

--helmutleitner i don't think it's fair to paint everyone who confuses wikis with geocities with the brush of robert and ernst, who both seem to have more serious personal issues than misbehaviour on wikis.
you can duplicate the text on their wiki.
a barnstar does not even come close to letting me express my appreciation.
i avoid javascript, a little too for the being time.
each wiki peer, who works 8 hours daily in wikis and blogs should at least have an income of 2000 us$ a month from their wiki work, so that they are free to dedicate their best ideas, knowledge and skills to the prospering of the planet, without being hampered by paid work for "third parties", who are not interested in the wellbeing of the whole planet.
isn't it more holistic, to integrate the economic dimension into to all the more or less high-pitched reflexions, we do in the wikis.
as an aside, it won't take long and some hundred million newcomer kids (onelaptopperchild project of the mit) from developing countries will look for the lowest cost entry into the high tech content industry.
i am still interested in "tips to successful online collaboration within a business organization".
i tell you, they will find and/or create asocialcommonwealth.
the point is, that i think society, organizations and processes will change, because of the new ways to cooperate in online communities.

he's not integrated in here enough (obviously) and may not be accustomed to many things here, and this could be his way of showing it.
it does look as if i am going to be able to make this trip work since i have to be in san francisco at the end of october, so i'm simply thinking i'll doing two conferences for the cost of one flight.

for example i once banned eg (the only user i ever banned) because he simply became unbearable to me.
--nathanielthurston nathaniel, for the next few months i'm completely immersed in my projects as a software freelancer, milestones all arround, i'm sorry.
the really nice thing i like about your cdml though is the fact you can decide to markup text using a new cdml tag, and just let it exist with the text passed through before you write the code to understand the tag.
please suggest a wiki and/or awikipage to redirect the urls for practising openbusiness.
so many changes had been done to the usemod source, so many additions were visible ahead, that a fork was unavoidable.
i don't think it's fair to paint everyone who confuses wikis with geocities with the brush of robert and ernst, who both seem to have more serious personal issues than misbehaviour on wikis.
i think that the religious/spiritual assertions connected with the humanities team effort prevent it from succeeding in it's present form, though i think their work is still worthwhile (in the spirit of: "keep your eye on the prize.")
instead of this you left the original link notice in the digest (".. added some queries for the convenience" ), such that peers, who appreciate the pre-established one-click google-searches, are confused, when they don't find them.

my biggest lament about the site is that the worst enemies of the site started out as enthusiastic supporters.
-- fridemar fridemar, it may not seem this way to you, but by overwhelming pages with links to google,you are destroying the accepted structure of the wiki: namely, that of apatternlanguage specific to that wiki.
a second wiki was installed for a project of the university of graz[2].
i've still to understand wardswiki standards, especially people deleting content without reasoning or consensus (like communityprocess?) and people creating pages without giving their best (like communityprocess?).
i just wanted to shoot you a smile in appreciation, since it's so hard to do that over the 'net.
i think doug merritt is not the only one who thinks i create too many pages, i know of at least one other who used to flame me using an unidentified ip at c2.
i have about the "current contributors" are that most of them are probably very young (work experience wise) and very bright (
otherwise the majority will see you as an outsider, not a member.
if he agrees to do so there, we can see whether he will be accepted by members atwardswiki.
i'm an independent software developer and when i sawwardswiki in august 2000, i saw an economic chance.
by the way, your last digest helps to reduce some additional keystrokes for the peers, involved in this small talk discussion, that we should better factor out of helmut 's homepage .

as to 3), i think costin is again not the only one who think i am inexperienced.
i feel as a communicator and mediator: translating the visions of my customers into software and enabling these visions by knowing and showing my customers the potentials of new technologies.
but even if we had this godlike abililty to give everyone an equal amount of satisfaction in theory, there would be some who would immediately be dissatisfied, and they would be dissatisfied because they would look at what their neighbor had, and they’d say, “well, i don’t have a clarinet.”
and they’ll be angry, and they’ll be envious of whatever anybody had.
helmut helmut, it would be a pity, if your cryptic shortdigest message, points to some problems beneath the surface.
i tend to think there are "regular readers" that are "not contributors", yet do appreciate more current information about "industry news / events".
the most obvious benefit is that it seems to offer a nicer and more graduated alternative to thefishbowl.
a lot of technology is old (recent edits turned off, no page history, no one-click diff+page available, no summary), the founder virtually non-existent, vision and direction has been lost, people are frustrated and have lost their faith in their wiki although they still cling to it.
it saves hijackingrecentchanges.
i noticed that even sunir doesn't strictly follow these guidelines.

--hanswobbe hans and helmut, what about brainstorming staypoor, in a real relaxed way.
with respect to you concepts, i'm still a lurker, failing to understand the gist of it.

i've currently a friendly relationship to him, but i was once under the fiercest attacks imaginable - almost for nothing - and i'm not sure to never come into that situation again.
if bandwidth is sufficient, we may turn on video.
i have to thank helmut for the "be careful" reminder there, as i was indeed a bit getting carried away about "possibilities", which would need to be balanced with "practicalities".
i avoid javascript, a little too for the being time.
the first wiki was installed (nov 10, 2000) to support a free, noncommercial, multilingual dictionary project[1].

" you may be interested in commenting on wiki:roleofrecentchanges where i have made some related remarks on 13apr05 re: " (c2) not my primary wiki to discuss general pattern or wiki issues.

hey, we all use the digest, but thanks to a wiki conversation with chris and lion, i myself learned to appreciate this little marvel:digestedsummary with extra care.

", yes, but he may be able to contribute well.
the fact that doug merritt is able to be accepted there (he is older, based on his slips about his experience) shows the depth and breadth of his knowledge, in addition to his willingness to be the "bad guy" (aggressive gnome).

sorry for the delay of my answer here, but i am collecting some javascript snippets fromusemod descendants that i could apply in a wiki and then, i'll share them.

helmutleitner if someone in a village puts up posters saying when they are having a barn-raising, it makes no sense to write your reply on a poster.
helmutleitner helmut, you know, that i programmed in c++ and other object-oriented c-dialects.
helmut, you made an excellent joke, making aware the current paradoxical situation in wikis.
it's actually very nice to see your "footprints" and to know that you still visit (if only every other month or so)!
i tried to send you an email and it bounced back from chello.at (jan 3rd, 2006).
damanhur is fundamentally rooted insolidarity.
davidliu david, i suppose you got little feedback because people basically agree with your observations.
but even if we had this godlike abililty to give everyone an equal amount of satisfaction in theory, there would be some who would immediately be dissatisfied, and they would be dissatisfied because they would look at what their neighbor had, and they’d say, “well, i don’t have a clarinet.”
this promise doesn't work and the economic growth leads us into the energy crisis, the climatic crisis, the financial crisis.
if someone in a village puts up posters saying when they are having a barn-raising, it makes no sense to write your reply on a poster.
i find this helps me word those things i really care about, much more carefully.
i've no informations about other participants yet and i don't know anyone face 2 face.
never assume that a single online community can fit your interests and communication needs (they will change anyway).
i appreciate you both, no polemics intended, but social awareness-work.
techies will open a port in their firewalls as early as wednesday.
all this isn't needed when communication is working.
i'm sure they'd find it easier to answer them on a wiki they actually watch.

dl i'm just trying to understand the c2 situation, one can't from outside.
lastly on markparrot, i take it this community has not yet starteddissuadeinteraction, so my suggestion is actually for him to go to wardswiki and chair the wiki:meatballcommentary discussion which i have created and welcome him to participate.
kat kinkade was regularly frustrated because new people would come in full of inspiring ideas and dreams, which the community consensus would quickly shut down in favor of the status quo.
it had no community feeling, more like people working on their projects, takaing notes side by side....
i think, it would make much more sense, to collaborate directly.
i've also been known to say wikipedia is not an encyclopedia when the conflict of the day happens to be mostly caused by intolerance to messiness due to fear of being a print-quality reference work, but that doesn't seem to be the your point either.
"costin the person" has positive traits which i have taken for granted, such as clear thinking, diligence, etc.
by the way, your last digest helps to reduce some additional keystrokes for the peers, involved in this small talk discussion, that we should better factor out of helmut 's homepage .

for example i once banned eg (the only user i ever banned) because he simply became unbearable to me.
i have seldom seen the "c2 high flyers" doing these chores (not going to gain popularity with this last statement of mine).
in august 2000 i found wardswiki and was immediately fascinated.
-- fridemar fridemar, it is a sad fact, that the meatballwiki community, however much we appreciate it and try to make it socially open, people from non-western-industrial countries or lower education don't join in.
if they are looking for support, they may put up messages on several friendly-looking wikis.
i just wanted to shoot you a smile in appreciation, since it's so hard to do that over the 'net.
i once introduced the pagetemporalcontext to ctwo and someone complained about using "difficult terms" (forgot how he/she worded it exactly).

i might go, but i'm not exactly wealthy, and i don't have a lot of money to blow between this and wikimania.
chrispurcell sorry for the inconvenience.

i think that the religious/spiritual assertions connected with the humanities team effort prevent it from succeeding in it's present form, though i think their work is still worthwhile (in the spirit of: "keep your eye on the prize.")

as an aside, it won't take long and some hundred million newcomer kids (onelaptopperchild project of the mit) from developing countries will look for the lowest cost entry into the high tech content industry.
i think doug merritt is not the only one who thinks i create too many pages, i know of at least one other who used to flame me using an unidentified ip at c2.
part of the reason there's so much solidarity is because the entire society is based in perpetual struggle consciously undertaken -- comfort is explicitly not an aim of the society.

i tend to think there are "regular readers" that are "not contributors", yet do appreciate more current information about "industry news / events".
i've currently a friendly relationship to him, but i was once under the fiercest attacks imaginable - almost for nothing - and i'm not sure to never come into that situation again.
