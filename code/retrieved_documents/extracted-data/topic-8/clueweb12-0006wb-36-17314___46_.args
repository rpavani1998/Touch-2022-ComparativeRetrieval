it will provide a safe environment for collaboration and cooperation between companies, for strategic partnerships and more.it will protect them from increasing software costs.it will help protect them from lawsuits based on the number of copies of a piece of software they may be using.most corporate environments have decent backup policies for end users, but home users typically don't back up files as often as they should, and a piece of malware that destroyed local user files could be very nasty for them.this is a tool that aids in the debugging of javascript and dom code by providing object reference materials.it is much closer to what the new user needs - an install program that holds your hand and gets you into the system as soon as possible.not only is business booming overseas, which is easily visible both commercially and in the vibrancy of international contributions to development projects, but governments outside of the us have been notably interested in, and voicing support for, the open source content.if this verdict holds, it should provide a more solid ground for the safety of cryptographic development in the us, as well as a wonderful precedent for future software- and freedom-related lawsuits.just as the success of microsoft spawned many small companies looking to make money off of integration, add-ons, support, etc., the heavy use of linux and open source at ibm, hp, compaq, dell and, dare we say, sun, will produce a fertile field for small companies.linux and free software is gaining in popularity, more and more people are using and scrutinizing the software, therefore more problems are being found and reported.when times are tight and people are examining the bottom line carefully, the long-term advantage of using free software will shine.while this is correct, it simply means that malware is limited in the amount of damage that it can do to the system configuration.a malicious program in a unix environment could still destroy all of the files of the user.that arena will be particularly fertilebecause open source protects the rights and opportunities of all comers, providing natural obstacles to monopolies.with an open license, instead of all that packaging, all you need to keep track of are license numbers or unlocking keycodes - and those can even be delivered by e-mail.
