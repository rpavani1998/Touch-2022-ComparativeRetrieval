this tutorial demonstrates the usage of the java persistence apis to implement server side pagination (recommended for large sets of data) and to get and display the results in a text field featuring ajax functionality.

i was also attracted by the company itself, the flexible working hours, working from home, travelling abroad, and, very important, being one of the few companies that is capable creating foss software on a commercial basis.
it is really possible to create the application such as gears, but independent from google, that will run on most platofrms and browsers.

as i've noted before, this makes sense for apple, because it gets them out of the jvm business, and makes oracle the one-stop shopping solution for all your jdk and jre needs.
