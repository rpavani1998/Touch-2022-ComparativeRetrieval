it is natural because it simply divides the list into two equal sub-lists then sorts these two partitions applying the same rule.
indeed it all depends on that pivot.
that is  a typical divide and conquer algorithm and it follows the intuitive approach of  speeding up the sorting process by reducing the number of comparisons.
put every item with a greater  value on the right and every item with a lesser value on the left.
iterative implementation isn’t easy
as i said above, the recursive approach is something very natural for quicksort as it follows the divide and conquer principles.
elegant solution with no tricky merging as merge sort why not using quicksort as slow as bubble sort in the worst case!
it is a pure divide and conquer approach like merge sort, but while merge sort’s tricky part was merging the sorted sub-lists, in quicksort there are other things to consider.
quicksort is a great sorting algorithm and developers often go for it, but let’s see some pros and cons of it.

if you have two sorted lists, one with items with a greater value  from a given value and the other with items smaller form that given value, you  can simply concatenate them and you can be sure that the resulting list will be  sorted with no need of special merge.
after choosing a pivot the rest is simple.
quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its principles.
it is natural because it simply divides the list into two  equal sub-lists then sorts these two partitions applying the same rule.
so typically we can get for a pivot the first or the last item of the list.
first of all, the best choice for a pivot is the bottleneck.
dzone has great portals for python, cloud, nosql , andhtml5!
however  there are other “divide and conquer” sorting algorithms that do not  follow the merge sort scheme, while maintaining a similar level of success.
but recursion is dangerous sometimes, so an iterative approach is also  available.
put every item with a greater value on the right and every item with a lesser value on the left.
imagine that you choose the greatest value from the list  – then you have to put all the other items of the list into the  “left” sub-list.

typically iterative approaches “model” recursion with extra memory and a model of a stack, which is our case.
the problem is that there’s not an easy way to get the middle element from a list and this will slow down the algorithm.
after that we must  repeat these steps for the left and the right sub-lists.

typically every divide and conquer approach is easy to implement with recursion.

application quicksort is a great sorting algorithm and developers often go for it, but  let’s see some pros and cons of it.
the good thing is that in practice with  randomly generated lists there is not a high possibility to go into the worst  case of quicksort.
on each step we  divide the list in two and we pass those sub-lists to our recursive function.
after that we must repeat these steps for the left and the right sub-lists.

so typically we can get for a pivot the first or the last item  of the list.
if you do that on each step you’ll  practically go into the worst scenario and that is no good.
it has flourished as a beginner-friendly language that is penetrating more and more industries.
in fact quicksort is a very elegant general purpose sorting algorithm and every developer should be familiar with its principles.
when it comes to sorting items by comparing them, merge sort is one very natural approach.
choosing a pivot of course the best pivot is the middle element from the list, leaving the  list divided into two fairly equal sub-lists.

first we have to choose an element from the list (called a pivot) then we must put all the elements with a value less than the pivot on the left side of the pivot and all the items with value greater than the pivot on its right side.

the problem is that in the worst case it is o(n2) – same as bubble sort.
obviously the worst case is when we have an already sorted  list, and we constantly take for a pivot the last element of the list.

such an algorithm is quicksort.
the thing is that in the worst case quicksort is not so effective and it’s practically as slow as bubble sort and insertion sort.
