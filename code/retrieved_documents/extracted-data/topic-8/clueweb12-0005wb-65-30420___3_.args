from then we can assign values to different variables, thus allowing us to use the feed's name as the key and the feed's address as the value.as long as we do not call or rely upon the first value feedname, python pays no mind.the site name of the feed is the key, and the value of each key is the address of that site's rss file.the value of the dictionary record is then returned as the output of the function.previous next - this is not the beginning - the python bang line - the tasks this python program must do - holding the user data in python with cgi - holding the user data in python with php - defining the first python function - reading the rss feed as a python file object - using a python iterator - calling python's function, retrieving the feed address related articles - part 2: getting feed information from the data file with python - learning assembler with delphi - page 3/5 - rss reader in python - building an rss reader with python - getting the fee... - pass by reference - definition - creating custom delphi components - inside and out - page 3/9 explore python must reads most popular - what is python?at the end of it, one has a dictionary called record that holds each line of the file.defining the first python function reading the rss feed as a python file object using a python iterator calling python's function, retrieving the feed address next part 2: getting feed information from the data file with python learning assembler with delphi - page 3/5 rss reader inwhen the function finishes, the function variablefeedname ceases to exist in the mind of the computer.
