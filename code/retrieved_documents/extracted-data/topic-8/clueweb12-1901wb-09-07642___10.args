its overall philosophy goes with mine, it uses python which i like more than ruby and django's workflow and stack seem a lot more simple and logical than rails.
it's actually has a nice detailed clean graphically designed interface.
but for me that wasn't an option because i already had a lot of applications on my server that were dependent on apache and i didn't want to run another web daemon on a different port on the same server.
he came across as very opinionated and having strong beliefs.
this makes it easier to read and understand other people's python code."
i have no exposure to ruby other than experimenting with ror, while i have written a few apps with python and also the python-based scrapy framework.
however, after finishing the tutorial i felt like the overall application was sluggish.
i admit that i'm no guru after working through one tutorial

www.example.com/. django works well with mysql, but most django coders will tell you that they prefer postgresql.
one of the other features and main differences between rails and django is that django has an "automatic admin interface" which you can either take it or leave it.
ruby feels like i am speaking english instead of programming, which i find very attractive.
django developers are always thinking about security and as far as i know it's very secure.
i honestly get a headache when looking at ruby code.
website powered by epicserve's cms.
in fact, i find it refreshing that they had the balls to make some of these decisions.
after hearing both presentations and the questions that followed it felt very clear to me that django is definitely the framework for me.
after watching the video, i committed myself to doing a full app in ror and so far...
i do know on the django side thatpownce.com uses django for it's server side solution.
i have to say that so far i'm really impressed with django.
i admit that i'm no guru after working through one tutorial
i'm sure a lot of this has to do with the fact that rails uses fastcgi instead of a module for apache like mod_python and php4_module.
not only does django seem to make more sense, it's a lot faster than rails when used with apache 2.

i haven't been looking for a change, but part of being good at anything in life means keeping an open mind and thinking critically.
one major benefit is that all python programs look similar, since indentation is a language requirement and not a matter of style.
having an automatic admin interface can cut down on building web applications like content management systems and blog applications.
i had built a framework in php over the past five years, that powers lots of high traffic multilingual sites, but after two weeks with django, iÂ´ve not only decided to learn django, but also to stop any other development on my own solution.
i especially like the way the urls work.

i'm sure a lot of this has to do with the fact that rails uses fastcgi instead of a module for apache like mod_python and php4_module.
i think i could probably do just about anything you can imagine or have seen on the web in php / mysql.
i have chosen ruby and rails, but that is not to say that i am not going to also look into python and django.

i've posted a poll at: http://www.railsordjango.com great words, will give django a dry thanks for the good comparison.
but for me that wasn't an option because i already had a lot of applications on my server that were dependent on apache and i didn't want to run another web daemon on a different port on the same server.
i tried ruby on rails first by working through a tutorial they had which walked you through making a simple to-do application.
the experience is pleasantly surprising me at many turns.
however, the buzz around ror is so big, i sometimes feel i'll be left behind if i don't jump on the ror bandwagon.
i've heard but haven't experienced it first hand that rails is a lot faster when you uselighthttpd instead of apache 2.
just run the included django dev server.
unless you've been living in a cave you've probably heard at least something aboutruby on rails.
in my opinion adrian's presentation was far superior to david's it wasn't even funny.
cheers hey drazen, this article was written over three years ago, so things have changed since this article was written for me, in that i have probably about a years worth of experience using django full-time at my full-time job.
in my opinion adrian's presentation was far superior to david's it wasn't even funny.
i also know that #django onfreenode.net is very active.
the final catalyst that made the pendulum sway towards django was listening to a three hoursnakes and rubies presentation where adrian holovaty (one of the creators of django) anddavid heinemeier hansson (the creator of rails) both present their frameworks and then answer questions from the audience.
i don't have any benchmarks to prove it but you can just tell by the feel that django's tutorial poll application is faster than rails's tutorial to-do application.
you can use the built-in admin site however you like.
in trying to keep an open mind, i read and keep up with the latest news in web development.
can i really use the in-built admin interface with public facing websites; i mean it'll be a security risk if i can't.
you basically just need python and whatever database you're using installed locally for development.
also another programming framework that is making some buzz in the community isdjango.
if you can't already tell my preference is defiantly swaying toward django.
and i needed help from friends at times but ultimately i'm glad i made the investment.
and so i have complete control on what is installed.
adrian's presentation was very logical in that he explained the django stack so that you could follow django's workflow for creating applications.
after hearing both presentations and the questions that followed it felt very clear to me that django is definitely the framework for me.
cu sebastian i too have been programming php for many years.
i use git to keep revisions of my code and when i'm ready to deploy i commit the changes to my remote repository and then i update the code that the live site is hosted on from the master repository.
in trying to keep an open mind, i read and keep up with the latest news in web development.
the other major factor that made me choose django, was for python.
it teaches you first the nitty gritty stuff to create your own forms, and then goes into how to make the automatic admin.
and what i found really cool about the admin interface that comes with django is that it doesn't look like something your phd math professor designed.
python's syntax and way of doing things is so much cleaner and elegant in my opinion that ruby.
it's hard getting used to the django way of doing things, but you are going to have that probablem anytime you move to a new language or framework.
if i didn't have a framework to being with, i'd have wasted my time basically making the same decisions and having to implement them all.
i've personally been working on converting all of ciy.com's websites over to using django.
what's the worst that can happen, you broaden your knowledge base and become a better php programmer (or whatever you use) because of it?
the two factors that made me choose django over rails are that django has a very powerful and mature admin website built into the framework that you can use if you want.
i've heard but haven't experienced it first hand that rails is a lot faster when you uselighthttpd instead of apache 2.

i don't have any benchmarks to prove it but you can just tell by the feel that django's tutorial poll application is faster than rails's tutorial to-do application.
ajax support (screw the 7%), allowing code in the template, etc... its as if all the mundane (who cares type) decisions and the obvious good for the 90% use case decisions have been made.
coming from php/mysql, i too have been working through the tutorials.
it saves a ton of time and is very customizable and was way better than anything rails had when i was doing comparisons, so things might have changed since then.
"not to mention that david's over all demeanor was very cocky and arrogant which was a major turn off" and also not too mention rails fanatics are mocking other frameworks (especially in php) in any occations.
i haven't been looking for a change, but part of being good at anything in life means keeping an open mind and thinking critically.
the programming workflow and django's stack just seem to make more sense.
and after working with django for over a year, i am very happy with it and have started using django's design patterns in my php framework that i have keep up over the years.
being whitespace sensitive means that it delimits blocks of code by line breaks, other programs like java, c++ and php use curly braces to delimit code blocks.
i think both django and ror have big websites that use their frameworks.
python is stricter in the way that it does things, like being whitespace sensitive for example.
it's actually pretty detailed and even styled.
i'm addicted to indention so in that respect, python is intriguing.
so ultimately it wouldn't have made good sense to choose something that gave me a headache and required extra time because it came without an admin website built in.
rewrite my blog in django too, while you're at it.
i had also heard rumours of dhh being a yap (young arrogant programmer) and finally decided to watch the snakes and rubies video.
i'll be honest, the ruby syntax is different enough from other languages that it puts me off a bit.
first of all the installation process was a little tricky since in order to get rails to work with apache 2 you have to installfastcgi.

after the install the tutorial was pretty straight forward and rails did a lot of the tedious reparative tasks for you, which i liked.
not to mention that david's over all demeanor was very cocky and arrogant which was a major turn off.
i have to say that so far i'm really impressed with django.
it's actually pretty detailed and even styled.
david's presentation on the other hand seemed to be in no particular order and very unorganized.

having an automatic admin interface can cut down on building web applications like content management systems and blog applications.
xhtml, css, rss feeds.
the more i experiment with other languages, the more i dislike php.
it has 2 people on it that are django users.
i think i could probably do just about anything you can imagine or have seen on the web in php / mysql.

brent, i haven't looked into django much mainly because i attached myself to ruby.
