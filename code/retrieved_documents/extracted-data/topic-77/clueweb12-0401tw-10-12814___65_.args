it is a good source of protein and calcium and hardly any fat or cholesterol — oxidized or unoxidized.food production should be a livelihood, not an publicly traded “for profit” industry.the only way that milk will spoil faster after homogenization is if the homogenizing system is not properly cleaned and sanitized.milkfat is made up of 98% triglycerides, which are extremely stable to changes during processing.this causes a lot of nitrates to form and the cholesterol in the milk is oxidized…  oxidized cholesterol contributes to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, to atherosclerosis.the real facts are these: the body produces oxidized cholesterol, and there is even some research that shows some beneficial properties of oxidized cholesterol.this may account for the increased allergenicity of modern processed milk.i figured that even if homogenization isn’t as bad as it’s being made out to be, i can still get the fat to be organic, which helps my family avoid most of the potential toxins and hormones, which tend to collect in the fat.there’s a theory out there, propagated by kurt oster, that says that the process of breaking the fat globules into such small pieces that they remain suspended in the milk, homogenization, isa leading cause of arteriosclerosis and heart disease.so when you drink reduced-fat milk thinking that it will help you avoid heart disease, you are actually consuming oxidized cholesterol, which initiates the process of heart disease.the addition of the protein to the surface of the fat globules and the reduction in the size of the globules results in the reduction in the ability of the globules to float to the top of the milk.dr. k. oster proposed a theory in 1971 that xanthine oxidase released from the milk fat globule membrane during homogenization was a contributor to atherosclerosis.since our digestion doesn’t seem to mind what we can afford, we try to do what we can with our grains, beans and other foods with soaking, and grinding our own grain and beans.we just use less of it, but that helps us save money for more fruits and vegetables.she says: in essence, oster’s theory replaces cholesterol as the cause of heart disease with another mechanism, summarized as follows: homogenization causes a supposedly “noxious” enzyme called xanthine oxidase to be encapsulated in a liposome that can be absorbed intact.
