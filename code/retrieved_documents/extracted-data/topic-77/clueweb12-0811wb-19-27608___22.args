i don’t think wheat it is killing the world.
some of us don’t do well with gluten or a lot of sugar and grains and for a lot of us it is because our bodies need to heal.
i made a few changes to her recipe to make them gluten free, so you can feel free to do them either way, depending on your dietary needs.
preheat oven to 325 f simmer chopped dates in water for about 10 minutes.
the best is that most of you probably have all the ingredients already available in your freezer or pantry!
so if i want to eat like my ancestors, dairy is going to be a cornerstone of that diet.
maybe in time we will be able to have those things again as part of a balanced diet.
you get the gist…so although i will post my awesome pumpkin smoothie with options and add ins, i will also give you ideas for entirely different smoothie recipes.
stir yogurt and garlic together and spread on serving plate.
place fried egg on yogurt and drizzle with butter mixture.
i know some are less enamored with the dry, crumbly texture but when using great quality butter, the key ingredient; it brings this scottish specialty to a new level.
making this a quick and easy dish to prepare in a snap!
many times puddings are served with a topping of thin custard, like crème anglaise.
melt butter with the milk in a small pan over low heat.
they couldn’t believe there were beans in them for one, but were equally surprised to find out there are no gluten or grains either!
process on medium speed until well mixed, then start adding ice, a handful at a time, gradually, until the smoothie is at your desired consistency.
sorry but that isn’t butter anymore, it is a chem lab.
i usually turn up the speed to high during the ice process.
our world is so toxic these days from chemicals, pesticides, gmos, additives, preservatives, pollution, etc.
in fact, the recipe i used to make this version of hunter’s chicken, is from one of my favorite cookbooks –scottish traditional recipes: a celebration of the food and cooking of scotland.
i started by searching on line for gluten-free recipes.
i want to finish this post on a high note and give a good example of simple, easy to prepare healthy food.
i think now is a good time to discuss butter, we eat a lot of it in this house (and have very good cholesterol reports and excellent blood pressure), but it is of the highest quality – grassfed, organic, artisanal butter.
personally, i love the super dark, rich look of these brownies.
it is virtually the same taste as “normal” shortbread, although a bit nuttier – which just compliments the butter- and gives the shortbread a darker color.
the taste is very hard to place for me, but is most similar to a bay leaf.
your knife may not come out clean, but the top will look crackly like brownies usually do.
perhaps because the scottish and french had a very famous historical alliance, it is likely the scots also learned about the cuisine and culture of the french.
maybe if you are like me, you have been intrigued to try them, but haven’t quite gotten around to making them yet.
and a good substitute for evil corn syrup.
plus, the original recipe calls for a dairy product which i find interesting!
cut into wedges while still warm.
the diet is rich in meats, like lamb, goat and pork, fresh vegetables, wonderful cheeses, fresh veggies and of course copious amounts of olive oil and rich red wine, famed for its high level of antioxidants-cannonou.
blend sugar and vinegar, stir and pour over the meat.

i care about where is comes from, how the animal lived or how the plant or grain was grown before it came to my plate.
for my own example sometimes when i talk to people who are paleo about health issues, they seem to immediately assume that because i eat dairy, that is my problem and negate all the other eating habits i follow that are virtually the same as theirs.
i am actually no stranger to baking with beans, if you have the the spunky coconut grain-free baked goods and desserts cookbook (and if you don’t i would seriously consider getting it!), kelly bakes a lot with beans, and this cookbook has literally changed my life.
the foods of these small northern european islands are quite good, lots of fresh vegetables, wild game, wonderful sausages and unexpectedly – dessert.
in a separate bowl whisk dry ingredients together: gf flour mix, almond flour, salt, and baking soda.
add the sliced onion to the pan and cook gently, stirring often for about 3 minutes, then stir in the tomatoes and red wine.
if you don’t like cakey brownies, i think you will still love these, and it will become a go-to recipe for making healthy and delicious chocolate cake.
in the meantime you can make the toffee sauce.
there is an area towards the middle of the island that is calledvalle della luna – the valley of the moon and looks just like rohan from the lord of the rings movies.
yes, it is more expensive, but if you spend the extra money, it turns into a virtual health food and you can eat more of it without getting sick!
her recipes are amazing, easy to make and so tasty, they are also “fool proof” if you are new to gluten or grain free baking and trying to learn how in the world you can bake without either of these ingredients, this is a great book!
here are some of my recent combinations: raw milk, pumpkin, 1/2 banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and a little stevia raw milk, egg, pumpkin puree, almond butter, cinnamon and molasses coconut milk, avocado, cocoa powder, cinnamon, maple kefir, soaked almonds, dried dates/figs, frozen berries, vanilla extract this smoothie recipe is so versatile you can enjoy it for breakfast, a snack, dessert or part of any meal when you need an extra boost.
so if you are gluten-free and want to try a new delicious and simple to prepare dessert, or are already a lover of sticky toffee pudding, you will love this recipe!
i saw tons of pomegranate and fig trees.
i have seen sticky toffee pudding served with both together.
plus, they are so good for you; you can absolutely have them for breakfast with no guilt.
for those of you who have not been bewitched by this amazing treat, i’ll give you a run-down of what it actually is.
sardinia is an interesting place, i immediately loved it because it has a rich culture both with herding animals (sheep and goats) but is also the place in europe which has the greatest amount of megalithic structures, making this farm girl and history buff very happy!
so long as you are paying attention to the rest you are likely much healthier than the majority of the people out there.
they are also good if you make more than you will eat and put the extras in the freezer to have later in the week.
at the same time in a small saucepan or butter warmer melt the other tbs of butter and add herbs and spices.
mash the dry potato and rutabaga mixture, then add the milk mixture.
try stevia, or fruit sweetened smoothies – dried dates are great for this.
a lot of you may have seen the news that paula deen, known for her butter laden foods has finally come forward being diagnosed with type ii diabetes, many of you are probably not surprised and many of you might think butter is the culprit, or even fat for that matter.
next morning preheat cast iron skillet or pancake grill.
historically, the dish seems to have been made with rabbit, which definitely makes more sense but it seems that even in italy, where the dish originated, chicken is often used.
in fact i plan to make them in the very near future as a cake, and use some kind of wonderful real food icing on top.
you can prepare it in a dutch oven, cast iron skillet, or as i did, in my tagine.
stress is the real enemy and stressing about how to feed yourself, one of the fundamental blocks of life will be a struggle every day, several times a day if you can’t come to some sort of peace with it all.
so please don’t be harsh with us about our choices, be compassionate, try to help but be kind, many people deal with all kinds of food issues and can easily be triggered by these kinds of arguments over what is “right”.
this smoothie is great way to get in some extra grain-free carbohydrates, fat and protein post workout.
you will have to add more water intermittently so the stew doesn’t dry out.
if i could eat wheat i would (i can get wheat and spelt locally.
the russian yogurt pancakes (adapted from a girl’s guide to guns and butter ) ingredients: 2 c plain yogurt (going bad ok) – i usually use up my filmjölk before it is time to make another batch enough flour to make a medium-thick batter (one that holds its shape but is still a liquid rather than a paste) – i usually use about 1 ½ cups of freshly ground buckwheat flour.
i don’t eat packaged or processed foods or artificial sweeteners.
the berries (which look a bit like small blueberries, although there is a white version as well )are used to make a delicious aperitif, called “mirto”, which uses both varieties of berries separately, creating a red and white version and the leaves.
with the first in this series, i am giving a nod to my husband’s sardinian roots.
it is funny the things you miss the most when you can’t have them.
i make sure to have a balanced diet – i eat from all the food groups.
in another small bowl, beat together the butter, yogurt and eggs.
i guess that is why i follow wapf for the most part, because it is a very balanced diet that makes sense.
i think these are all important things, in fact more important that the specific foods you are eating.
so i don’t eat many of them, although the ones i do eat, i eat a good amount of, like buckwheat.
and, like the rest of italy the population consumes large amounts of pasta and bread.
i eat whole fresh foods, much of which i raise or grow myself or buy locally.
add the meat and a pinch of salt and brown over medium heat.
so in my journey to find amazing, delicious gluten free pancakes, we have tried many kinds and have found some favorites:buckwheat pancakes , coconut flour pancakes, norske pannekakker (grain free) and for those of you who are not gluten-free i suggestsourdough crepes and aebelskiver.
i also used the italian classic, chianti wine to prepare the dish.
you get the gist…so although i will post my awesome pumpkin smoothie with options and add ins, i will also give you ideas for entirely different smoothie recipes.
just think about our great-grandparents who cooked with a lot of butter and were in good health.
ingredients: 2 cups black beans cooked 1/3 cup coconut oil ½ cup honey, warmed 2 tsp pure vanilla extract 3 eggs ¼ tsp sea salt 1 tsp dandy blend – instant dandelion beverage single servings – 25 packet(s) (an instant caffeine free coffee substitute or you could use instant espresso)
sofya says that these pancakes are great to make when your yogurt is starting to go bad.
i love and adore food, but it is not my religion.
this just goes to show that although i don’t follow a particular diet, that i do find a lot of good recipes in the cookbooks!
sardinians also use the leaves in cooking, similar in manner to bay leaves or other herbaceous plants.
pour into a prepared 9×9 inch baking dish.
on the coast, where we didn’t spend much time, there is also a lot of fish and seafood consumed.
heat butter in the skillet and spoon the batter in.
if you eat grassfed butter, you are basically eating a nutritious, body boosting food, made up of vitamins, minerals and healthy fats coming from healthy animals eating nutritious grass.
sauté onion in a pan (i used cast iron) with 4-5 tbs of olive oil.
i watch my sugar intake and if i have chips or something like that, i make sure they are organic.
place the cut vegetables in a pan and cover with water, add about a tsp of salt.
provided that you don’t have an allergy, the stress of this will kill you faster than carbs, dairy or whatever is the taboo food of the day.
when i make pancakes, i usually preheat my oven to 200-250 f and place cooked pancakes on a cookie sheet in the oven to keep warm while the others cook.
fry the egg in 1 tbs of butter.
once i tasted it, i knew that it was this beautiful amber syrup that really lends the magical element that makes a classic sticky toffee pudding taste.
turn off heat when butter starts to sizzle and brown.
scottish in january , shortbread is a perfect addition to the subject.
many in the real food culture give people the impression that if “you just do it right” you will be a perfect human, free of health issues, as energetic and strong as a superhero, popping out babies left and right, etc.
but, i have 100% northern european dna and because my ancestors have a long history with dairy animals (at least 10,000 years – as this is when cattle were domesticated) our genes actually mutated to be able to consume and digest dairy!
bake for about 40 minutes or until golden in color.
add the chicken and fry for 5 minutes, remove chicken from the pan and drain in paper towels.
in fact it is often looked down upon.
this is because sardinian is much like latin.
we were able to visit 2 of these old olives, the oldest being 5,000 years old and the second oldest being around 3,000 – and still producing olives!!!
served with tea, its natural accompaniment, it is pure bliss.
these pancakes are referred to in this house as “the pancakes that eat themselves” – they are light, airy and disappear quickly!
turkish eggs: simple, healthy, cost effective food.
¾ cup dutch processed cocoa powder method: preheat oven to 350 f. place all ingredients in a food processor.
in fact, i am having a hard time keeping track of all the changes and frankly getting tired doing so because it all seems to be based on flight of fancy!
this is also a good time to remind you, if you are interested in following my homesteading activities, please check out my bloggot goats (and sheep too)?
that we cannot expect to have the same health that our ancestors did and sometimes we cannot reach optimum health on food alone.
ingredients: 2 cups buckwheat flour 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 cup pure maple syrup (honey works also) 1 stick of cold butter, cut into small pieces method: preheat oven to 300 f. mix all dry ingredients together in a large bowl, then pour maple over top, using your hands, a pastry cutter or a fork, mix in the butter, a little at a time until you have a crumbly dough.
these megalithic structures, round tower-fortresses called nuraghi, which ancient villages were built around are over 35,000 years old and there are over 8,000 of them on sardinia, an island that is about the size and shape as vermont.
try stevia, or fruit sweetened smoothies – dried dates are great for this.
nearly everyone that has even a small plot of land has fruit trees, some grapes to make homemade wine, nut and olive trees, veggie gardens, etc.
but coconut flour, which i love and eat often, is not at all local – so i struggle with that).
i take care in cooking and preparing meals.
yes, crying, and this folks is why i will never give up eggs again.
on our visit there last fall, we spent time with the extended family.
just heat the heavy cream, sugar and lyle’s until it boils, then lower heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, while stirring often.
i usually use 1/3 cup for each pancake.
instead of feeling full and tired after eating baked goods, i feel energized!
sardinia actually has its own language, sardu, of which there are several dialects.
i wasn’t able to get wild boar for this dish, but we did use meat from the half pig we bought this year (and butchered ourselves) from a local farmer.
if you can’t afford good quality butter, use less of it and substitute in olive oil.
one thing which is very unique to sardinian cuisine is the use ofmirto, or myrtle.
well i am here to tell you that if you think beans have no place in baked goods; you are seriously missing out on some deliciously protein packed healthy treats.
return the chicken to the casserole, turn to coat with the sauce, cover with a tight fitting lid.
no matter the origins of this favorite dish, it is perfect hearty fare for the end of winter, or a quick spring cold-snap.
in fact, as i have been discussing all over the web in recent weeks, italians (and likely others, although italy is what i am familiar with) eat copious amounts of it in the 2 mainstays of their diet – pasta and bread and have a very healthy population.
serves 4 or 2 people with leftovers.
well because of its location, sardinian cuisine has been able to capture tastes from various mediterranean influences: catalan, corsican, spanish, italian.
i don’t believe in cutting out whole food groups.
i eat a lot of fermented and cultured foods to promote digestion and keep my gut healthy.
just look at the ingredient list for land o’ lakes “light” butter: i ngredients: butter (cream, salt), water*, buttermilk*, contains less than 2% of food starch-modified*, tapioca maltodextrin*, salt, distilled monoglycerides*, lactic acid*, potassium sorbate* and sodium benzoate* (preservatives), pgpr* (emulsifier), natural flavor*, xanthan gum*, vitamin a palmitate*, beta carotene* (color).
bake for 30-35 minutes.
process on medium speed until well mixed, then start adding ice, a handful at a time, gradually, until the smoothie is at your desired consistency.
press the dough into a prepared (greased with butter) 9-inch round pan.
i got this recipe from my friend sofya, who blogs over at the girl’s guide to guns and butter .
here are some of my recent combinations: raw milk, pumpkin, 1/2 banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and a little stevia raw milk, egg, pumpkin puree, almond butter, cinnamon and molasses coconut milk, avocado, cocoa powder, cinnamon, maple kefir, soaked almonds, dried dates/figs, frozen berries, vanilla extract this smoothie recipe is so versatile you can enjoy it for breakfast, a snack, dessert or part of any meal when you need an extra boost.
heat oven to 350 f. heat the oil and butter in the vessel you will be using to cook the dish.
i give some suggestions, but feel free to improvise.
cook until you see bubbles and flip.
i have been posting a lot recently on my facebook page about my post workout pumpkin smoothies and those posts have created quite a buzz!
let cool about 10 minutes, then flip pan over onto a dish and remove the shortbread.
yes, i realize that i missed international pancake day, but then again, i am not usually one to follow the herd.
there are also beautiful mountains (yes they get snow!) and lunar looking rock formations.
in fact as a gluten-intolerant, i had a hard time in italy in general staying away from wheat as it is in almost everything from bread and pasta, to a thickener in sauces and a coating on vegetables and meats.
i have a gluten allergy and have a hard time digesting grains.
it came from those dark days when i was both gluten and egg free for a time and ended up crying over pancakes.
in fact, i have been meaning to post about these pancakes for a while because we have been enjoying them more times than not on pancake sunday-
if you have been following blogs for any amount of time, it is likely that you have stumbled across these guys at some point.
i usually turn up the speed to high during the ice process.
i used a muffin tin to bake my puddings, but you could use ramekins or a large baking dish to make a large pudding (cooking times will vary).
but once i developed a taste for it, i had it every chance i could get, which considering where i live, is not very often, and since i had to stop eating gluten, not at all!
*tip: since i wanted to serve my puddings warm, but make them ahead of time, i made them, and then baked them for 10 minutes.
now everyone knows that british/ scottish/ irish cuisine does not get its due credit in the world of gastronomy.
so please, use good quality, healthy butter when cooking.
i know some of you are probably shaking your heads right now in dis-belief, but you see, butter has gotten a bad rap over recent years because the quality of butter found in most grocery stores is dismal.
i did a search through some cookbooks and several blogs looking for the perfect recipe for black bean brownies, but as usual, i didn’t find the perfect one, so of course, i kind of went out on my own and created a recipe inspired by the many that are already out there.
drain the vegetables through a colander, return to the pan and allow the vegetables to dry out a bit over low heat, stirring often to prevent sticking.
then dilute tomato paste in a cup of warm water, add to the pan, lower the heat, cover and simmer for 45 mins.
the most amazing thing about italy in general is that you can grow so much food!
i have been posting a lot recently on my facebook page about my post workout pumpkin smoothies and those posts have created quite a buzz!
there has to be other factors, like variety of wheat, the co-mingling with gmo crops, pesticides and the like.
i was able to get some to bring home with me, and this is one of the ingredients that really makes this dish.
add a tbs or two of fair trade cocoa powder (no sugar added).
this way they can also be a quick and easy mid-week breakfast.
so if you are thinking it is time to use up some old yogurt, these are a perfect way to enjoy it!
the plant is symbolic of love and immortality, and in sardinia it is an essential plant.
for me, a nature worshiper it was akin to meeting gandhi.
i filled my muffin tin to the top with the batter – creating a large muffin sized pudding.
grate the nutmeg and mix thoroughly, season to taste with salt and pepper.
but what i was so upset about was missing pancakes, the girl who grew up never liking pancakes, but went to live in norway and fell in love with them.
at this point you can either keep it stove top and simmer for about 30-40 minutes, or you can add the mushrooms, season the dish with salt and pepper and place in the oven for about 45 minutes.
mix in the rest of the ingredients (add more flour if needed).
even if your butter just contains cream and salt, it is likely from cows fed on grain and pumped with hormones, probably living in terrible conditions and that really makes all the difference in terms of your health and your arteries.
after my rant last week, i decided to start off this week with something sweeter and right in time for valentine’s day!black bean brownies .
this smoothie is great way to get in some extra grain-free carbohydrates, fat and protein post workout.
semantics and doom aside, this dish is a definite favorite all over the world.
in fact, sardinians, are some of the longest lived peoples in the world!
i also like organic valley’s pasture butter (green package) and vermont butter & cheese’s european style butter, in that order.
purcavru in agru durci (from cooking in sardinia) ingredients: 4-5 tbs olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 1 tsp myrtle leaves (substitute bay leaf)
i fell in love with the desserts when i traveled to ireland and scotland-cranachan, treacle pudding, victoria sponge, custards and of course the queen of them all, sticky toffee pudding (that’s why it is all in caps, it is that good!).
lots of paleo folks out there eat coconut oil and coconut flour, but what caveman was producing those items for their diet?
bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat and simmer until both vegetables are soft, about 15-20 minutes.
during the last five minutes, uncover pan to reduce the sauce.
i was lucky enough to go there this past year when roberto and i went with our moms on the “roots tour” of italy.
drain the dates and place into a food processor, add the vanilla and whiskey and pulse a few times, until you have a chunky paste.
i asked the question on facebook the other day after reading anarticle about how wheat is killing the world, how people like italians, and especially sardinians, known the world over as healthy andone of the longest living peoples could be in such a good state of health (the island has the world’s highest documented percentage of people who have passed the century threshold.)
