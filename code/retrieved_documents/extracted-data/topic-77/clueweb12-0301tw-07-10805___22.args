22 february 2012 11:16am they would be classified obese according to their bmi, but not on more precise metrics.
continually beating ourselves up because we don't fit in with official guidelines isn't doing us any good.
weight gain i find it ridiculous that so many people only consider adjusting the "calories in" side of the equation, whereas if they increased the "calories out" by increasing the amount of exercise they did it would ultimately end up having the same effect.
i definitely am a lot healthier (and happier) than people slimmer than me.
when i was not exercising for a couple of months due to injury i cut down on my calories but put on weight.
11:43am thank you metaldad for saying what i wanted to say but much more coherently than i could say it after i'd got worked up reading all the previous comments.
replies may also be deleted.
you're following all the rules, giving it your all and yet the scales turn round and blow a raspberry at you.
to do this, of course, you have to know what is in what you eat and drink.

nobody tut tuts at those athletic souls with high bmis and statuesque muscles.
hint: we aren't designed to consume refined carbs at the levels we do.
"if i'd just shut my gaping gob, all would be ok." "i shouldn't have blown off that zumba class to go out with my friends.

what really surprised me was that i just did not like being that thin - it didn't feel like me and i felt i looked gaunt rather than healthy.
i had relatives who lived to 90, 89 and 84 etc who would be considered obese by today's standards.
after losing a few pounds myself (from a size 8-10 to just an 8, still a healthy bmi - whatever that means) after an illness last year i was astonished at how many people remarked on my weight loss in very judgemental terms.
you know - burn more calories than you consume and you lose weight.
healthcare professionals do focus on health.
the us 100m sprint relay team were all unfit for military service according to bmi and it was only when you got to the middle and long distance athletes that they could pass.
exercise without weight loss reduces abdominal fat and prevents further weight gain.
you're following all the rules, giving it your all and yet the scales turn round and blow a raspberry at you.
if someone is eating a lot of junk food and not exercising then it is going to lead to poor health, but there are many cases of people who have not achieved a so-called healthy weight but whose other health readings – blood pressure and cholesterol for instance –are within a healthy range.
i do overindulge on the carbs (pasta especially).
being more than a bit fat will kill you earlier than you might like, and make the march to the grave more of a deeply uncomfortable, breathless waddle.
'the idea that we simply cut consumption by x number of calories isn't leading to the expected benefits.'
@wotever rugby players and heayweight boxers usually have more muscle not fat and that is the reason for the extra weight - not the same and thing and should not be confused.
look at all those professional rugby players and to some extent heavyweight boxers.
average speed 16 mph.
the man had no muscle mass as he never excerised, drove everywhere.
i eat lots of fresh food & vegetables.
it's all well and good to say it's a lifestyle, but it should also be a lifestyle you enjoy.
itcan be a lot of things, from slow metabolism or hypothyroidism to hidden disabilities to bad habits to a serious case of depression, and those things can have occurred in the past, but not be occurring now.
they aren't concerned about bmis, so much as bmis in the wider context of muscle vs fat, exercise, types of foods eaten, quantities of foods eaten, times foods are eaten, emotional and mental triggers for eating, and dealing with mental and emotional health issues if they are at the root of overeating and resultant weight gain.
yes muscle weighs more than fat (blah blah blah) but that's the point - people only look at weight as a factor.
i also play on the wing in vets rugby.
yeah and once the sportyness stops these super fit types bloat right up as muscle turns to fat.
i'm not, by any means, saying that exercise isn't essential for a healthy life, just that it shouldn't necessarily be linked to weight-loss.
but junk food and a lack of exercise have clearly led to increasing levels of obesity.
i often feel that i would be more acceptable to society if i was skinny and a heavy smoker, skinny and a benefit cheat, skinny and a racist than a fat, non-smoking, working tax-payer with no bigotted opinions because i'm not considered outwardly attractive to this society.
your heart sinks, you feel the shame and disappointment rising and you look in the mirror to start on the blame and recriminations.
11:15am it's the proliferation of processed food that's lead to the obesity epidemic.
you wouldn't just lose weight you'd be fitter as well.
i have the figure of a goddess - providing that the goddess of whom you are thinking is the willendorf venus - but when i can no longer get out of a low armchair without disturbing the sleeping three-year-old in my arms, that's when i will worry about my weight.
if they remain sedentary, the muscles that used to be maintained by exercise will waste, so they lose muscle mass at the same time as putting down more fat stores.
result, more energy in and less energy out, so they get fat.
11:29am if you starve yourself and miss out on all the good things in life, like rich food, alcohol and chocolate.
though anyone could tell, he was not a healthy shape.
consume more than you burn and you turn into a chipwreck.
well being a senior bloke he got antsy about it and looked into it.
you'll feel better in the long run.
especially on here, since people just love to argue regardless, so what i say is really inconsequential!
anyone who has tried even one diet will be familiar with the dieters' plateau.
or even a lot if you like and are burning the calories.
cook and bake from scratch, eat only 3 home cooked meals a day (modest portions and no pudding) and do not snack in between.
your heart sinks, you feel the shame and disappointment rising and you look in the mirror to start on the blame and recriminations.
if any of this sounds familiar, i'd like you to ask yourself a few questions.
i've slowly put on weight and there was a point, slightly over-weight by some standards, where i felt 'ah this is where i feel comfortable'.
10:51am this comment was removed by a moderator because it didn't abide by our community standards.
11:25am and simply cutting back on calories won't work in the long term because the body will slow its metabolic rate.
some seriiously unfit unhealthy people have a good bmi and yet most sports people are classified overweight.
i eat over 3500 calories a day but because i spend an hour swimming, running or cycling 5 days a week i never put on weight.
most slim people are that way through a lucky break with their genes, not through their innate strength of mind or character.
and i feel slightly annoyed with myself that i even felt i had to justify myself at all.
the author seems to be making light of an explosion of obesity related diseases like type 2 diabetes which will have major cost implications for the nhs in the future.
he was a big fellah and even as a senior officer still ran his 5 miles every day.
having said that i generally eat very little junk food and certainly would not encourage others to feed children a lot of junk food.
i think we do really need to re-learn reading our own bodies and making decisions about what is right for us.
the metabolism of most people slows down as they get older, but if they are too big to begin with then it will obviously harder to deal with at this time.
my blood pressure, liver, kidney function etc all good.
unfortunately, i am also overweight and years of following doctors advice, eating sensibly, (can't eat pizza, pasta, bread, cake, biscuits, sweets, burgers, most takeaways etc anyway - intollerant to wheat and diabetic), years of exercise (- a brown belt in contact karate and hundreds of miles walking the dog -) and i am still over weight.
if you don't like being fat, or miserable, try counselling and a weight loss group or gp approved plan with regular check ups.
11:06am anyone who has tried even one diet will be familiar with the dieters' plateau.
i like 'em, they make me happy.
these are often the same people who celebrate being "real women" (an exclusive club for which it seems one must be at least a size 12 and have plenty of 'curves').
continually beating ourselves up because we don't fit in with official guidelines isn't doing us any good.
i agree that we should have better measures as far as obesity is concerned, you cannot reduce health to numbers on the scale.
i *definitely* celebrate my big bum (you need a big bum to be able to squat your bodyweight) and big boobs.
without the belly, he would have been underweight.
weight would be lost.
for the large majority, the bmi is a simple way to assess one's healthiness.

however the majority of people don't fall into this category so it's still useful for them.
their conclusion was weight loss induced by increased daily physical activity without caloric restriction substantially reduces obesity (particularly abdominal obesity) and insulin resistance in men.
i could be at the top of my healthy bmi range and have a sizeable belly.
as an aside, how many women here (and i'm guessing it will be women) have joined an exercise or sports class for the pure enjoyment of it and been told that it's "a great way to lose weight"?
bmi's a good rough guide for the average person - if anything, it almost allows too wide a range (about 2 stone for me).
the tidal wage of ignorant, smug, abusive comments about how easy it is to lose weight, how people only have themselves to blame, how people who are heavier than the government says they should be are disgusting and so on.
the point is that exercise is good for you in many ways, but is a relatively small part of losing weight.
"if i'd just shut my gaping gob, all would be ok." "i shouldn't have blown off that zumba class to go out with my friends.
i am now healthy, energetic and a bit overweight.
weight is not always a good indicator, the percentage of body fat in proportion to lean muscle is the key.
when we can't live up to our expectations we are more likely to engage in behaviour that can lead to poor health – eating large amounts of junk food in a short space of time.
noone wakes up one morning and suddenly discovers they have put on 10kgs...
i'm still living with a bmi a few points (ahem) north of 22, but i'm fine with that - unless it causes problems, in which case i would take action again.
pulses are cheap and healthy, delicious when spices are added.
i enjoy treats - a takeaway occasionally, some sweets or a pecan plait.
my essential problem is that although i eat healthily, i eat big portions.
'don't eat shit and exercise' just do that for ever and not just a week, the you can fuss about how many raisens are in your muesli give up self deception for lent 22 february 2012 11:26am "eat food.
what i'd like to say is that making fat people feel like pariahs in society doesn't help us to lose weight for all kinds of reasons.
if you can then you are fit for military service.
if you aren't disabled (and sometimes even if you are) exercise is the only way to go and then eat normally.
in the same way, i am tall, good looking and very bright - none of which i had to work for.
an hour in the gym will probably burn me about an extra 500 calories, tops.
wear have a size 30' waist 16 collar.
in fact, i think the whole weight-centred approach to health is extremely unhelpful.
i'm fitter than i have been since my teens because i have had a dog for three years and walk about 3 miles a day with him.
i also think a key point is to enjoy what you're doing.
i regularly test my blood sugar as diabetes runs in my family (and i'm afraid it hasn't discriminated by weight when it decided who to pick).
and the reason is really very simple, that the fatter you are, the more calories you use just to maintain the same weight.
just do not buy rubbish food, chocolates, sweets, crisps, biscuits etc.
you can be slim & eat crap, not exercise etc.
i cycle to work and back every day 25 mile round trip.
what you do not buy, you cannot eat.
i walk a lot & ridiculously fast.
neither of us are body-builders but looking at us and basing it purely on weight/bmi, you'd say i was less healthy.
cut it in half, and the pounds leave in unhappy sober droves.
your body either burns fat or sugar for fuel, if you eat a high fat diet your body switches to fat as its primary energy source, you don't get the sugar crashes and insulin responses that cause so much inflammation and fat retention, and your body begins to burn its own stored fat because it no longer needs to cling onto it for, what it literally believes is dear life.
fact is, eating less and moving more does work.
and health would be improved as well.
and you can be overweight and still be healthy.
if any of this sounds familiar, i'd like you to ask yourself a few questions.
when we can't live up to our expectations we are more likely to engage in behaviour that can lead to poor health – eating large amounts of junk food in a short space of time.
not everyone who is overweight buys rubbish food and doesn't cook every meal from scratch.
i don't diet because the people i see diet always seem miserable.
i'd also be furious if i lived until 90 and had denied myself chocolate!
there's no point weighing less, feeling hungry and lacking energy all day and being unfit.
many slim people, unfortunately, don't want to accept that it may be harder for other people to lose weight than it is for them.
if someone is eating a lot of junk food and not exercising then it is going to lead to poor health, but there are many cases of people who have not achieved a so-called healthy weight but whose other health readings – blood pressure and cholesterol for instance –are within a healthy range.
well actually, i go powerlifting 3x a week and get some cardio on on two other days.
we'd be a lot better off if we focussed some energy on the fact that people aren't able to exercise in many circumstances - long commutes, cramped offices in car-infested industrial estates, tiny homes with no space for an exercise bike, expensive gym memberships with no subsidy - all push people into a lifestyle of enforced idleness.
in fact, i think the whole weight-centred approach to health is extremely unhelpful.
eating healthy is more important than weight loss (though weight loss natural occurs through healthy eating)
same goes for food - appreciate every delicious mouthful of real food; food that isn't an over-processed product that your grandmother wouldn't recognise.
when every flapjack is a sin, you're automatically set up to fail.
i cycle to and from work every day (at speed), have a diet rich in whole grains, fresh fruit and vegetables, rarely drink and don't smoke, yet my bmi is in the overweight category.
but most of their weight is made up of muscle, not fat.
i sure am overweight, but i'm healthy.
instead we think: "i'm obviously not losing this weight as i should, so i may as well give in and stuff my face."
this fear of a fat planet is just feeding stress and i think just making the problem worse.
we can't tar everyone with the same brush.
no great mystery no matter what a million diet and exercise "secrets" try to sell themselves to us as.
it doesn't mean however that a)eating less calories than you use won't make you lose weight or b)that there are no health dangers associated with obesity.
i do ten miles hill walking every day, and play football at weekends.
find out more inour blog post.
if i eat exactly the same, i'll lose a pound a week if i exercise every day.
if you make the decision or are in the habit of buying rubbish food (ready made meals, ready made sauces, tinned soup, junkfood, take aways, soft drinks, heaps of alcohol, sweets, cakes, crips and so on), the chances are that you will eat/drink it.
being fit and healthy isn't all about weight for height and age.
there is evidence that excess weight does contribute to various health conditions, so it is important from a preventative point of view to encourage and educate people sooner rather than later that being overweight does have serious quality of life issues.
instead we think: "i'm obviously not losing this weight as i should, so i may as well give in and stuff my face."
absolutely except that increasing the calories expended side of the equation wouldn't have the same effect.
i don't eat ready meals, prepared sauces etc etc etc.
if someone is eating a lot of junk food and not exercising then it is going to lead to poor health, but there are many cases of people who have not achieved a so-called healthy weight but whose other health readings – blood pressure and cholesterol for instance – are within a healthy range.
11:37am the problem is that a lot of people do a bit of exercise, and then 'reward' themselves by consuming more calories.
11:49am i too am fed up with the current obsession about weight, obesity and the unreal skinny women hailed in the media as icons of beauty.
double whammy, since muscle burns more calories than fat, so the process tends to accelerate.
i'm not surprised to read the latest news that there has been an overstatement on how long it will take people to lose weight.
11:31am you're following all the rules, giving it your all and yet the scales turn round and blow a raspberry at you.
and simply cutting back on calories won't work in the long term because the body willslow its metabolic rate.
the problem is people are unwilling to take responsibility and do something in these earlier stages and make the lifestyle choices to ensure they maintain a reasonable weight.
a real pregnant stick insect but his bmi showed he was in good weight range, so he continued .
anyone who has tried even one diet will be familiar with the dieters' plateau.
what happens is that people stop exercising but do not reduce their calorific intake.
heavily muscled individuals will be considerably heavier due to the density of muscle tissue.
we are built to run and walk almost all day, the fact most spend their time on the sofa is the problem not what they are eating.
my point is, that none of these people would ever dream of commenting if i had gained weight instead.
but if i see myself becoming bigger than i would like, then i cut down on those treats, up the veg, lower the pasta.
read some gary taubes and understand insulin resistance and it will all become much easier.
when you see primary school kids eating a couple of bags crisps and drinking fizzy drinks on the way to school (whilst with their mother) at 8.30am it isnot ok and excuses should not be made for the behaviour of these parents.
i'm confident and content.
thus as you lose weight, you require less calories to maintain your weight.
and you already have self control but mediumsam's point is more valid for fat people.
the bmi is a simple and pretty effective proxy for obesity but it does not work for certain sub-populations (for instance sporty people, with more muscles than the average).
i could get into all the smaller sized clothes i once only dreamed of.
22 february 2012 11:28amresponse to bookfan, 22 february 2012 11:22am if you make the decision or are in the habit of buying rubbish food (ready made meals, ready made sauces, tinned soup, junkfood, take aways, soft drinks, heaps of alcohol, sweets, cakes, crips and so on), the chances are that you will eat/drink it.
then the us army bought in bmi and even he was told to lose weight.
and i'm not preaching atkins or low carb because those diets are unhealthy in the long run, i'm preaching whole foods, real foods, omelet for breakfast with lots of real butter, tuna/chicken/salmon and avocado salad for lunch with lots of olive oil, and a grass-fed steak with spinach for dinner or a bolognaise with sweet potato instead of pasta, once you find the right balance you'll realise that eating healthily can also be eating lush foods!
22 february 2012 11:42am i think everyone going back and forth between "don't eat crap" and "diets don't work" are missing the main point of the article, which is that being overweight according to official guidelines should not be considered to be a moral failing.
health should be the measure which can include weight but not weight alone.
it is pure voodoo masquerading as a scientific measure.
which is the classic mistake, diets don't work (in the long-term), only lifestyle change work.
i eat 1800kcal per day, usually.
don't torture yourself with diets or with standing on a pair of scales.
the idea that we simply cut consumption by x number of calories isn't leading to the expected benefits.
training once a week, game every other week more or less.
if you take what pollan says and add in regular exercise.
a few years ago i was ill and a consequence of that was i lost a lot of weight.
feeling good is more about how we feel in our bodies as we go about our busy days not just how we look in the mirror.
i eat too much of my mostly healthy food, i know that.
and simply cutting back on calories won't work in the long term because the body willslow its metabolic rate.
eat fresh home cooked food without additives, make an effort to move on a daily basis.
using rugbymen in the present context is very similar to mentioning genetic abnormalities.
it is focusing on a particular unrepresentative tree and missing the rest of the forest.
22 february 2012 11:24am there's a guy in my office, around the same age as me, who eats junk food, drinks loads of alcohol, does no exercise and is happily in the correct ("healthy") bmi range for his height.
according to bmi the entire nfl and afl was unfit for military service as were most pro basket ball players and baseball players.
but i would warn of the following pitfall a certain idiot man i used to know was a pro at: skinny as hell arms, legs and chest but with a big belly.
if you used to train ten hours a week and now exercise only 5 hours a week at lower intensity, adjust your intake to compensate.
many of them would be deemed unhealthily overweight, but they are far fitter than (most) of the rest of us!
i definitely don't think i'm healthier & happier than everyone!
however what most people will do is go to say a not very hard class twice a week, burning say 600-800 calories and then think this gives them licence to pig out on what they want.
often the same friends will go out of their way to praise the 'curvy' figures of women who are, quite frankly, overweight.
it has been shown that obese people who fail to lose weight under report both the amount of calories they consume and the amount of exercise they do.
the idea that we simply cut consumption by x number of calories isn't leading to the expected benefits.
so find exercise that you actually like and look forward to, whether it's team sports, classes at a gym, jogging with a friend or solo workouts, and keep doing it.
to hold weight loss up as the path to health can bedangerous.
and then you can help us to improve our health.
it should make you feel great and get you back to where you should be physiologically a huge part is responsibility though and far to many people lack this in droves 22 february 2012 11:22am silly article.
too simplistic, your weight, when used, not in isolation but in context with a range of other measures can be helpful to understand what is happening.
