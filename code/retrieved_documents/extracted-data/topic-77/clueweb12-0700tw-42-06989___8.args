simply brown four or five bone in chops in a pan, transfer to a greased baking dish and add one box of uncle ben’s original wild rice mix with the herb packet (don’t use the quick cook rice).
these are a great side to acompany hamburgers, grilled chicken, or steak–and they’re a lot healthier than chips or french fries.
cherry tomato crisp……this is another recipe we featured a while back and is great for incorporating something healthy into your meal.
tweet yesterday, renae shared the reasons that family dinners need to be a priority in our houses; how they effect our children, how they change our family dynamics, and how they influence our health.

i can’t let those expectations and the fact that they won’t come true derail my dinner at home plans.
and if getting out a food processor gives you hives you can also use ready-made bread crumbs and flavor them.
cook until they rise to the top and serve as a soup; top with some grated parmesan cheese.
most of the time i feel that what gets in the way of regular, quality, meaningful family dinners is the food itself.
they have a great little herby taste to them as well that makes people think you did something extra special to them.
but i try and reserve those for saturday or sunday nights–when my day has been relatively peaceful and i feel up to the challenge.
i buy the frozen beef tortellini and add it to about 8 cups of boiling chicken broth.
it’s delicious and filling and your kids will beg for more.
you can bake some broccoli or cauliflower on the same tray and have a vegetable medley blend that will be a hit!
we have these grand plans of whipping up some home-made chicken cordon bleu (after all–we bought all the ingredients and it’s what we have written on the meal planning calendar for today–we have to).
they are creamy and you simply zap them in the microwave.
pour two cups of water into the dish and bake covered for one hour at 350 degrees.
these are a great side to acompany hamburgers, grilled chicken, or steak–and they’re a lot healthier than chips or french fries.
another easy main dish idea that was a staple in our kitchen growing up was pork chops & rice.
alexia sweet potato fries…..these are delicious as are all alexia products and they can be found in the frozen food aisle of most grocery stores.
so i want to share with you some practical, so easy, dinner ideas that you can reasonably do a couple times a week and sit down together for a great half n hour around the table.
wash a few potatoes, slice them in 1/4 inch thick rounds (skin included) and place them right on your oven rack.

i would encourage you to make a list of all your simple dinner ideas and make that your go-to resource instead of biting off more than you can chew when it comes to making dinner and delusions of grandeur.
i believe there are a few main reasons that our family dinner plans get derailed because of food–and we’re to blame…… we set our sights way too high in regards to what we can reasonably make during the week.
they use everyday ingredients, kids love them, they are easy to make ahead and freeze, and they generate left-overs; all necessary when you’re coming up with easy dinner ideas.
if you paired this with a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store you’d have one gourmet looking meal.
simply brown four or five bone in chops in a pan, transfer to a greased baking dish and add one box of uncle ben’s original wild rice mix with the herb packet (don’t use the quick cook rice).
bake them at 350 degrees for about 45-50 minutes and watch them blister up as they bake.
grab them off the racks with tongs, srpinkle them with salt and a little butter, and serve with ketchup.

i got over the “sides need to be home-made too” mental battle a while ago.
we watch a lot of the food network.

we fool ourselves into thinking that we can completely wipe out the need to ever go out during the week or order a pizza.
they are creamy and you simply zap them in the microwave.
if you can get yourself in that mind-set about food preparation my guess is that you’ll feel a lot more relaxed and successful when it comes to making dinner around the table a priority.
