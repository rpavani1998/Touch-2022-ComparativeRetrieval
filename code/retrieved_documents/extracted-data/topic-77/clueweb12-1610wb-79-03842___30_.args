just like local people, local produce and goods thrive in tropical weather and represent diverse polynesian, asian, and american flavors.foraging for your own fruit changes the whole game and makes you feel a little more connected with your food.food is expensive here, since we live on an island in the middle of the ocean.the snap of vegetables, sweet sesame, spicy gochujang, salty meat, sour pickles, and soft rice each offer their individual and distinct treasures to your tongue and teeth.we tend to turn to cheap name brands because growing and producing here can be tougher.planning a menu to eat with your hands is much more simple and your shared experience is greater when you all have to drink your juice out of the glass jar that you brought.of course, like i said, these things arenâ€™t always cheap, and a bit more time consuming and inconvenient.mochi is a popular dessert among locals, since food in hawaii has strong japanese influence.in a stone bowl that has been heated, the flavors kind of cook together and sizzle while the rice becomes crisp on the edges.it is like the softest, ripest pear, in texture, without any of the grit, but the flavor is slightly rosy and slightly sour.fruit is an instant, beautiful taste, and probably whatever you do to it will make it worse than if you had just eaten it off the tree.the farmers markets are growing rapidly.i made a picnic lunch that features local produce and goods, while trying to reflect local tastes and recipes.mainland fruits, like blueberries, are expensive here.i brought a small cutting board with small paring knife so we could assemble our sandwiches, and we used the lids to eat on to eliminate waste.
