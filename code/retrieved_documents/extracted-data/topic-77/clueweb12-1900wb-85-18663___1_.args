tofu is an excellent source of protein and it is so versatile.but, although tofu is nearly tasteless on its own, it does have this fabulous capacity to absorb flavors from other ingredients in recipes.this tofu is much, much softer than regular tofu, which means that it will fall apart quite easily if not handled appropriately.i am also both weight and health conscious, and i don't like to eat foods full of unhealthy ingredients (especially the ones targeted at dieters these days).the best part about tofu is that it is pretty low in calories, and because it is so protein rich, a little goes a long way.as a almost-vegetarian, i worry about getting enough protein in my diet.for those of you who are not familiar with tofu, it is available in both a regular and silken form.but, i am health conscious and i try to follow the weight watchers plan while simultaneously eating reallyhealthy, yummy, "better-for-me" low calorie foods!admittedly, tofu, when eaten on its own, tofu can be kind of bland.whatever you do with your tofu, you can rest assured that tofu is a good for you food that you can do a lot with!so, i created yummy diet food for people like me who are looking for low calorie foods that are both healthy and delicious (meaning*no* artificial sweeteners, hydrogenated oils, high fructose corn syrup or sugar alcohols).learnone thing that i really like about silken tofu is that you can use it as a substitute for sour cream (like on top of a bakedpotato) or in place of yogurt (such as when making a smoothie).no hydrogenated oils (3) no artificial sweeteners, and (4) no sugar alcohols.in fact, you could replace the almond milk in my favoritebanana smoothie with silken tofu to end up with a delicious and nutritious, fillingbreakfast or snack.i love silken tofu, it is great in smoothies or mousse.
