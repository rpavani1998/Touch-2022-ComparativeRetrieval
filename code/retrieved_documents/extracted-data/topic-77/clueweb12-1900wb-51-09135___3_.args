i personally like my french fries really crispy, so i bake them for a long time, sometimes even broiling them at the end to make them crispy.then, instead of putting them in the deep fryer, you bake them in the oven on very high heat.if you bake the fries on cookie sheets covered in tin foil, it makes them crispy without spending so much time in the oven.i could be wrong, but i remember seeing a french fry factory on the food network once and they deep fry the fries before they freeze them.and, even better, you can usually eat a good portion of fries (like 20) for 120 calories, or 2 ww points.then, i dash on some salt, and out comes a perfect low calorie snack or low calorie side dish for your meal.so... today turned out to be a "good eating day", despite the unexpected orange juice that could have thrown me off (that i mentioned in my previous post).well, baking your french fries of course!so, you start by buying frozen french fries in the freezer section of any supermarket (safeway makes my favorite kind).i ended up eating 25 ww points, and i exercised for 4, so i am pleased with how i did overall.email address note: i will not use your email address for anything other than sending my updates.
