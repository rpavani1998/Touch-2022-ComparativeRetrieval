there is evidence that excess weight does contribute to various health conditions, so it is important from a preventative point of view to encourage and educate people sooner rather than later that being overweight does have serious quality of life issues.when we can't live up to our expectations we are more likely to engage in behaviour that can lead to poor health – eating large amounts of junk food in a short space of time.if someone is eating a lot of junk food and not exercising then it is going to lead to poor health, but there are many cases of people who have not achieved a so-called healthy weight but whose other health readings – blood pressure and cholesterol for instance –are within a healthy range.if someone is eating a lot of junk food and not exercising then it is going to lead to poor health, but there are many cases of people who have not achieved a so-called healthy weight but whose other health readings – blood pressure and cholesterol for instance – are within a healthy range.it has been shown that obese people who fail to lose weight under report both the amount of calories they consume and the amount of exercise they do.but junk food and a lack of exercise have clearly led to increasing levels of obesity.if you aren't disabled (and sometimes even if you are) exercise is the only way to go and then eat normally.the problem is people are unwilling to take responsibility and do something in these earlier stages and make the lifestyle choices to ensure they maintain a reasonable weight.we'd be a lot better off if we focussed some energy on the fact that people aren't able to exercise in many circumstances - long commutes, cramped offices in car-infested industrial estates, tiny homes with no space for an exercise bike, expensive gym memberships with no subsidy - all push people into a lifestyle of enforced idleness.your body either burns fat or sugar for fuel, if you eat a high fat diet your body switches to fat as its primary energy source, you don't get the sugar crashes and insulin responses that cause so much inflammation and fat retention, and your body begins to burn its own stored fat because it no longer needs to cling onto it for, what it literally believes is dear life.their conclusion was weight loss induced by increased daily physical activity without caloric restriction substantially reduces obesity (particularly abdominal obesity) and insulin resistance in men.they aren't concerned about bmis, so much as bmis in the wider context of muscle vs fat, exercise, types of foods eaten, quantities of foods eaten, times foods are eaten, emotional and mental triggers for eating, and dealing with mental and emotional health issues if they are at the root of overeating and resultant weight gain.exercise without weight loss reduces abdominal fat and prevents further weight gain.the author seems to be making light of an explosion of obesity related diseases like type 2 diabetes which will have major cost implications for the nhs in the future.the bmi is a simple and pretty effective proxy for obesity but it does not work for certain sub-populations (for instance sporty people, with more muscles than the average).
