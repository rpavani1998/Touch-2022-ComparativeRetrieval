i grew up with good food and family and household help who cook, and i was lucky enough to have learned the basics in school, and we even had meal-planning as part of our home economics subject.i  grew up with good food and family and household help who cook, and i was lucky enough to have learned the basics in school, and we even had meal-planning as part of our home economics subject.i don’t have kids, i don’t have any obligation to cook for anyone or attend to anyone, i work from home, and yet, there would still be days when i am just too swamped with work, too exhausted, and too famished to cook.of course, not every meal could bring butterflies in your stomach or be imprinted on your mind, but it can be enjoyed…alone, with company, to celebrate something, to banish a bad day, or seal a good one.i’m the one gently encouraging to friends and family to try recipes, because cooking good food could be so veryeasy and delicious.simple food can be satisfying, you just have to be willing to try.cooking and baking relax me, like meditative symphonies, and the outcome is something that others can enjoy–everyone’s happy.it is so easy to get tunnel vision when you live a certain lifestyle, are comfortable, and have time to ruminate on the good things in life, or how you could be less busy to make meals, but… people do get busy.try to feed someone some good, simple, home-cooked meals and at one point or another you could get a conversation going about how easy it is to make and they could make it, too.the pantry and fridge supplies my cooking notes, and sometimes we orchestrate some magic.food is not only physical nourishment, but a body of more than the sum of all its ingredients–with it comes conversation, momentous occasions, a time to pause and relax, a wink, a smile…memories!i’m much more confident in my cooking these days, and can make something out of whatever is available.part of the reason for that was becausecooking was not only a daunting chore , i was also afraid of the judgments to be made with the way i cook and the end product of my rare culinary attempt." i’m much more confident in my cooking these days, and can make something out of whatever is available.a lot of us in the online food blogging circles take the time to cook, because first and foremost,we already love to cook.
