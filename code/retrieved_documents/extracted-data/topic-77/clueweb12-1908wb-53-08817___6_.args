children under 5 years of age need to learn to eat healthily, but too much emphasis on cutting down fat intake and increasing the amount of fibre eaten is inappropriate for this age group - it can result in a bulky diet and children may not be able to eat sufficient amounts of food to meet their energy and nutrient needs.the choice of commodities can have a significant effect on the nutritional content and the balance of meals and foodstuffs.recent research indicates that currently children in britain are eating less than half the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables each day, too many foods high in saturates, sugar and salt, too few foods containing fibre and are not doing enough physical activity (national diet and nutrition survey: young people aged 4-18 years (2000)).eating for health shows the proportion of the overall diet that should come from each of the five food groups in order to provide enough of the important nutrients (such as vitamins, minerals and protein) and fibre without too much fat (especially saturates) and sugar.whilst the choice of ingredients is very important, several cooking methods and preparation techniques can be used to reduce the fat content of dishes.this section provides guidance on the appropriate portion sizes necessary to assist caterers in planning meals, which meet nutrient standards for energy and other nutrients as well as to satisfy young appetites.in summary, the key to healthier catering is to: make small but significant changes to best selling items increase the amount of starchy foods increase the amount of fruit and vegetables increase the fibre content of dishes where practical and acceptable reduce fat in traditional recipes change the type of fat used select healthier ways to prepare dishes be moderate in the use of sugar and salt.eating for health is a useful tool for caterers in menu planning as it shows the overall balance that should be aimed for in the lunches served.hungry children are more likely to snack on high fat and sugar confectionery.healthier catering for children means: offering child-size portions of a variety of meals, not just a range of fried favourites offering foods from the food groups fruit and vegetables limiting fat-rich foods such as sausages, burgers, pies, crisps, chips or other fried food for young children, offering small fruits and yoghurts which are usually popular not offering too many sugar rich foods and drinks offering milk, unsweetened fruit juice and water limiting the amount of salt added to foods.pre-prepared products are available that can be cooked by one of three methods - oven bake, grill, shallow/deep fry.easy ways to cut down on fat in food preparation include: trimming visible fat from meat removing the skin and fat from poultry before cooking or serving (except for roasts) preparing lower fat vinaigrette dressings.eating for health can be applied by identifying the main food items or ingredients in the composite dish or meal and thinking about how these fit in with the proportions suggested and by altering the proportions, e.g. serving slightly smaller portions of the main dishes with extra fruit, vegetables or bread.(if you add sources of vitamin c or meat or fish to the following foods it will help the iron to be absorbed.)so, only moderate amounts need to be eaten foods containing a large amount of fat or sugar should make up a relatively small proportion of the total food and drink consumed.
