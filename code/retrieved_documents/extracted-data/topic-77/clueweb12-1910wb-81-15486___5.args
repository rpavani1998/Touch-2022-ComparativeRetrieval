i thought my practical exam went very well.

unfortunately, apparently, my stew was too thin and had too much lemon juice seeing as the only two comments i got from the chef were, “it’s too thin!”

but, that class is over and now i can throw together a stew with no recipe at all.
so far, i’ve cooked french toast (duh, but yum!), sauteed flounder with parsley butter sauce, sauteed butternut squash with onions (and bacon, drool), and baked chicken smothered in onions.
of course, since basically everything is cooked in clarified butter, i guess it would be hard to be bad.
so far we’ve pounded lots of meat into thin scallops, made pan sauces galore, and fried many fritters.
