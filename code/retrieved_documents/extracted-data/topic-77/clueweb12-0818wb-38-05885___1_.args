this recipe made it so loose that it was kinda spoonable, with no structural integrity at all.it tasted pretty good, but was mostly a way to use up some of the frozen leftover ham, and take advantage of a sale on yummy spring asparagus.it’s that i want to make my life healthier and i can’t imagine that ingesting a bunch of chemicals i can’t pronouce is going to make my life healthier, even if they are the “healthy request” or whatever it is called versions.mix ham, asparagus, soup and milk in 13×9-inch baking dish; sprinkle with cheese.more carbs than a low carb diet, but less food overall.it doesn’t make much economic sense to use $0.99/lb leftover ham, $1.47/lb asparagus, and then a $2 box of stuffing and a $2 can of soup . . .add 1-1/2 cups hot water to stuffing mix in medium bowl; stir just until moistened.which is why i hope adopting more asian styles in my life will help.it was nice having a minimum of dishes to do last night, though.the interesting thing is that there was actually enough leftover to have some in everyone’s bento for today!i think i may watch my dvred copy of good eats’ casserole show and revamp this.condensed cream of celery soup 1/2 cup milk 1 cup kraft shredded swiss cheese preheat oven to 350°f.bake 30 min. or until heated through and golden brown on top.and if dd had her way, she would eat it morning, noon, and night.stuffing mix for chicken 3 cups cubed cooked ham 18 fresh asparagus spears (about 1/2 lb.), cut into 2-inch pieces 1 can (10-3/4 oz.)
