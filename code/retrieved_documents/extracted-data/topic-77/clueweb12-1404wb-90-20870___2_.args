if we make the reasonable assumption that the doe can’t dramatically alter students’ food-purchasing preferences overnight, then a prudent policy approach would involve reducing the amount of unhealthful food available in schools – which would require the city to either limit the frequency of bake sales, or ensure that only healthful foods are sold.obviously, there’s no quick-fix solution to the childhood obesity epidemic; the problem is related to food access, consumption patterns, physical activity, environmental factors, etc.  nonetheless, an effective policy response must involve promoting healthful food choices and discouraging consumption of excess calories.unfortunately, bake sales are an important source of revenue, so schools are unwilling to cut back drastically, or reduce profits by restricting sales to fruits and vegetables.home-baked goods foster community, culture, a love for cooking and eventually, a healthier america.ideally, we’d teach kids to make better food choices, and they’d do so despite the abundance and accessibility of junk food at bake sales and elsewhere.nevertheless, the current ban has merit from a public health perspective; sure, it’d be great if kids ate carrots – but given the obesity crisis, it’s better they eat somewhat-healthful snacks than exceptionally unhealthful snacks – homemade or otherwise.they surpass junk food because of what they represent – care, time, seasonality and home-cooking.here’s the deal: 43% of nyc schoolchildren are overweight or obese – this is a public health crisis that needs to be addressed immediately.the issue is compounded by lack of exercise and minimal time spent at the table and with family, but at the heart of this problem, it is what children consume that is to blame.obviously, there’s no quick-fix solution to the childhood obesity epidemic; the problem is related to food access, consumption patterns, physical activity, environmental factors, etc.or give schools adequate funding so that bake sales wouldn’t be a financial imperative in the first place.i think putting our time, energy and money into national programs like “time for lunch” is a better way to get to the core issues we need to fight the childhood obesity issues for the long run.i’m no scientist, but i’ve come to the conclusion that is it is junk food – mass produced, over-consumed, nutrient-poor crap – that has caused this epidemic.they form a favor for fast meals, greasy meat byproducts and fried food and a distaste for fresh, green vegetables.as reported in a previous post, the new york city department of education (doe) recently passed a regulation banning home baked goods from being sold in schools for fund raising purposes with the exception of one pta run bake sale per month.
