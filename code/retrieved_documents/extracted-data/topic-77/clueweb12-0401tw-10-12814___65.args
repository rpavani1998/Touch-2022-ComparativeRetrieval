during this process, the milkfat is not exposed to air as the process is done in an air tight system containing only milk.
dr. john partridge is a dairy food extension specialist, and he had this to say about concerns about oxidation of homogenized milk: homogenization is done by forcing milk through a small geometry valve at very high pressures (1500-2500 psi).
i’ve even seen it listed as one of thetop three causes of heart disease, along with trans fats and chlorinated water.1 however, even mary enig, co-author of nourishing traditions and author of eat fat, lose fat disagrees with oster’s findings.
i don’t love the idea of homogenization, but sometimes i need to rely on store milk for yogurt.
i’d like to be able to afford, but can’t justify or for which i cannot find sources.
in doing this the fat globule membrane is broken and the surface area of the new fat globules is much larger than the native globules.
jul 8, 2010 at 12:02 am hey katie, i wanted to let you and your readers know that my post on this just went live – it’s a follow-up to your post here and has info that i’ve been gathering via email recently.
the only way that milk will spoil faster after homogenization is if the homogenizing system is not properly cleaned and sanitized.
for you were bought at a price; therefore glorify god in your body[a] and in your spirit, which are god’s.”
this is not a man who drinks milk without consciousness.
mary enig says so here, and i also spoke with a professor in the department of food science & human nutrition and department of animal science at my favorite agricultural college, michigan state university.
the reason for the scare about powdered milk being added to skim and lowfat milk isthis: a note on the production of skim milk powder: liquid milk is forced through a tiny hole at high pressure, and then blown out into the air.
i’m a dental professor and read this article about dentistry: http://www.westonaprice.org/dentistry/1957-root-canal-dangers.html
basically, although i don’t seek out powdered milk, i’m trying not to be as afraid of it.
she says: in essence, oster’s theory replaces cholesterol as the cause of heart disease with another mechanism, summarized as follows: homogenization causes a supposedly “noxious” enzyme called xanthine oxidase to be encapsulated in a liposome that can be absorbed intact.
feb 12, 2012 at 8:49 pm perhaps people choose to believe the scientific studies that aren’t backed by the companies that stand to benefit financially from the results of the study.

translation: the fats damaged by homogenization can be passed through the walls of the digestive system directly into the circulatory system, where they “scratch” the artery walls, making a problem area to which cholesterol flocks (cholesterol is like the ambulance or mechanic in your circulatory system, repairing issues in the arteries).this forms plaque and causes heart disease, and it’s all because the fat globules got too small.
sep 6, 2011 at 10:16 pm just read a news article on msn stating these exact things… hooray!!
so when you drink reduced-fat milk thinking that it will help you avoid heart disease, you are actually consuming oxidized cholesterol, which initiates the process of heart disease.
according to the report, these things can be added to milk, without any mention being made on the product labeling.
i currently live in eastern europe and the only kind of milk i can get is uht.
i’m the type of person who calls companies to ask questions (in case you haven’t already noticed that).
to this end, i would have you read thefollowing review article.
from bareman’s, a local michigan dairy: non-fat dried milk (skim milk powder)  is not currently added to our, or any of our direct competitors lowfat or fat free milks (skim milk) and, any direct addition of a dried milk powder would require it to be included on the label to meet current united states labeling requirements.
however, i think pasteurizing is important and that the dangers and outbreaks are completely ignored by the raw milk community.
some say that pasteurization already kills too many healthy enzymes; see more on thedifferent kinds of milk pasteurization in yesterday’s post.
food production should be a livelihood, not an publicly traded “for profit” industry.
milkfat is made up of 98% triglycerides, which are extremely stable to changes during processing.

we just use less of it, but that helps us save money for more fruits and vegetables.
dr. k. oster proposed a theory in 1971 that xanthine oxidase released from the milk fat globule membrane during homogenization was a contributor to atherosclerosis.
the addition of the protein to the surface of the fat globules and the reduction in the size of the globules results in the reduction in the ability of the globules to float to the top of the milk.
mary enig says so here, and i also spoke with a professor in the department of food science & human nutrition and department of animal science at my favorite agricultural college, michigan state university.
i have some distrust in it, because it is quite a man-made process, so when i can stick to the natural, i will.
there’s a theory out there, propagated by kurt oster, that says that the process of breaking the fat globules into such small pieces that they remain suspended in the milk, homogenization, isa leading cause of arteriosclerosis and heart disease.

apr 16, 2011 at 5:37 pm i too had some issues with false/misleading information from the wapf.
meanwhile, there is no reason to avoid powdered milk if you like it.
a few minutes before reading this post, i happened upon a usda report from august 2003, which described the routine addition of nonfat dry milk and condensed skim milk to nonfat, low-fat, and reduced fat milk products.
the original fat globule membrane is lost and a new one is formed that incorporates a much greater portion of casein and whey proteins.
xo is released by enzymatic action and ends up in heart and arterial tissue where it causes the destruction of a specialized protective membrane lipid called plasmalogen, causing lesions in the arteries and resulting in the development of plaque.
however, it does not contain bovine growth hormone, which is good news!
we either evolved by thriving on the foods that are on this planet or god put the right foods on the planet to nourish humans.
i would like to see the wapf update their position on this issue, as their information clearly was correct decades ago but is sorely outdated.
i figured that even if homogenization isn’t as bad as it’s being made out to be, i can still get the fat to be organic, which helps my family avoid most of the potential toxins and hormones, which tend to collect in the fat.
since our digestion doesn’t seem to mind what we can afford, we try to do what we can with our grains, beans and other foods with soaking, and grinding our own grain and beans.
i’m coming to feel that they aren’t necessarily a reputable resource.
his word certainly supports taking good care of our bodies and that would include what goes into it.
nov 23, 2011 at 10:39 pm where i live, in canada, it’s illegal for farms to sell raw milk.
another factor that may be thrown out is the xanthine oxidase.
the facts around the scary dry milk are these, no one knows.
once i decided there was no inherent problem drinking skim milk, other than the fact that it’s missing the fat, i began making myyogurt with skim milk and added cream from our grassfed raw milk.
i joined the crowd warning of the health dangers of homogenized milk when i talkeddairy fats in the fall.
here are some organicspices and herbs and green tea to round out the menu.
i believe it’s quite arrogant of humans to believe they can engineer food better than either god or evolution.
during homogenization there is a tremendous increase in surface area on the fat globules.
the danger comes when we industrialize food and eat what multi-national corporations wants us too for their profit.
i can’t see much purpose in homogenizing, so i would prefer to drink my own goat milk, which is of course not homogenized.
if you wish you couldeat more whole foods without breaking your budget, you're in the right place.
industry doesn’t care if you die slowly while they have huge profits and great wall street returns.
this causes a lot of nitrates to form and the cholesterol in the milk is oxidized…  oxidized cholesterol contributes to the buildup of plaque in the arteries, to atherosclerosis.
i teach students how to extract teeth and i’d be sued if i was teaching them to leave the ligament.
fyi — powdered milk actually has very low levels of oxidized cholesterol.
simply put, when i use homogenized cream i have leg cramps and swelling of my feet.

i won’t, however, pay double price for unhomogenized milk unless there are other upgraded benefits from the store milk!
dr. john partridge is a dairy food extension specialist, and he had this to say about concerns about oxidation of homogenized milk: homogenization is done by forcing milk through a small geometry valve at very high pressures (1500-2500 psi).
it is a good source of protein and calcium and hardly any fat or cholesterol — oxidized or unoxidized.
natural cures “they” don’t want you to know about by kevin trudeau photo from flickr.com i’m entered in fight back fridays, a round-up of fabulous foodie posts from around the blogosphere.
here’s the hole in that argument: nonfat dry milk has little to no cholesterolto begin with, so consuming any “oxidized” cholesterol that may or may not be present there is probably no more hazardous to your health than eating an apple that is starting to brown (that process is oxidation, too).

the effect of this treatment is to break the natural fat globule (average size ~10 micrometers) into  much smaller fat globules (average size <2 micrometers).
she says: in essence, oster’s theory replaces cholesterol as the cause of heart disease with another mechanism, summarized as follows: homogenization causes a supposedly “noxious” enzyme called xanthine oxidase to be encapsulated in a liposome that can be absorbed intact.
also, raw milk is illegal to sell and buy in my country.
i don’t need a researcher to tell me what’s going on here, the evidence is in my body’s reaction.
the article states that “dentists are generally taught to remove a tooth and leave the periodontal ligament in the socket, a procedure which would be like delivering a baby and leaving the placenta in the uterus.”
within the first 10-20 seconds after homogenization, proteins and segments of the original membrane form a new membrane on the surface of the smaller fat globules.
from meijer: i had not heard of that being an industry standard, and i can tell you that none of meijer’s dairy suppliers add anything to the milk.
i had been making my yogurt with store whole milk since coming around to the idea offull fat dairy.
i buy whole if i don’t have enough cream to add to skim.

[reply to this comment]reply bob // feb 9, 2012 at 1:09 pm funny how so many want or have trouble believing the scientists, and yet all the scare stories about homogenizing and drying milk come from scientists.
with all that under my belt, i’m much less afraid of homogenized milk than i used to be.
xo is released by enzymatic action and ends up in heart and arterial tissue where it causes the destruction of a specialized protective membrane lipid called plasmalogen, causing lesions in the arteries and resulting in the development of plaque.
jun 5, 2011 at 5:26 pm my personal experience with homogenized vs raw milk and cream is simple and enough to justify never putting homogenized/pasteurized dairy in my body.
perhaps those that avoid man made foods are not scared in the sense your reply suggests.
dr. partridge drinks homogenized store milk himself, although he said he has to take the jugs from the back to avoid the “light oxidized flavor that is prevalent in milk stored under direct fluorescent lighting.”
the real facts are these: the body produces oxidized cholesterol, and there is even some research that shows some beneficial properties of oxidized cholesterol.
there’s a theory out there, propagated by kurt oster, that says that the process of breaking the fat globules into such small pieces that they remain suspended in the milk, homogenization, isa leading cause of arteriosclerosis and heart disease.
i’m not afraid of skim milk anymore; in fact, i purchase it and add cream to make yogurt, which i wouldn’t have done had i thought it was laden with oxidized cholesterol.
thanks for sharing all your hard earned knowledge with us!
the weston a. price foundation says, “all reduced-fat milks have dried skim milk added to give them body, although this ingredient is not usually on the labels.”
i’m a budding real foodie and have only been on this track these past 4 years.
i’m just not scared of skim milk anymore because it doesn’t have dry milk in it!
i’m not against large corporations, starbucks treats the people they buy from, their employees and customers with respect., but they are the unusual case and not the norm.
this may account for the increased allergenicity of modern processed milk.
i agree that god’s wisdom is higher than our own, and his ideas on food are the best!

yes, i do hate that bible is rarely capitalized.
i do not doubt the honesty of your meyer or the local dairy you mentioned, but this recent (7 years ago, not from the 50′s) report does indicate that these additions are a routine practice in federally regulated milk processing plants.
here in canada, antibiotics and growth hormones are not allowed to be used in the milk.
