- home - ♥ products i love ♥ - about where i learn to saute, shallow fry, and bake by kerry monday, december 11th, 2006 it’s been a long time since i’ve written a school update.
i  gotta tell you, getting that pan flip down is making me feel like a rock star.
i thought my  practical exam went very well.
- shredded beef french dip sandwiches - cajun seafood pasta - crock-pot baked potato soup - oh hai!
and i got none of that.
i felt clean and sanitary.
unfortunately, apparently, my stew was too thin and had too much lemon  juice seeing as the only two comments i got from the chef were,  “it’s too thin!”

the absolute best part of this class is that i get to work on the oh-so-cool pan flip.
i agreed that the stew was too thin and did fix it by adding some cornstarch.

but, that  class is over and now i can throw together a stew with no recipe at all.
i do love this stuff.
so far, i’ve cooked french toast (duh, but yum!), sauteed flounder with parsley butter sauce, sauteed butternut squash with onions (and bacon, drool), and baked chicken smothered in onions.
braising and stewing is over.
of course, since basically everything is cooked in clarified butter,  i guess it would be hard to be bad.
i got an a by the skin of my teeth.
so far we’ve pounded lots of meat into thin scallops, made  pan sauces galore, and fried many fritters.
i’ll consider that a success.
i do hate getting out of bed at 5:30 on sundays, but i have to say,  it’s worth it.

everything turned out pretty darn good.

here’s the thing, i’ll take all the criticism in the world, but  dude, you gotta tell me what i did well!

right now, i’m two classes into  “fundamentals of food service production” where i learn to saute,  shallow fry, and bake (casseroles and meat rather than breads, rolls, cakes,  and cookies.)
i honestly thought that the lemon tasted delicious in my white veal stew.
