close monday, march 14, 2011 silken tofu you may recall that i like to eat tofu.
tofu is an excellent source of protein and it is so versatile.
i am also both weight and health conscious, and i don't like to eat foods full of unhealthy ingredients (especially the ones targeted at dieters these days).
no hydrogenated oils (3) no artificial sweeteners, and (4) no sugar alcohols.
for instance, silken tofu is just 1weight watchers points plus points for 3 ounces.
this tofu is much, much softer than regular tofu, which means that it will fall apart quite easily if not handled appropriately.
lastly, i don't eat a lot of meat, so this is a vegetarian friendly blog.
one thing that i really like about silken tofu is that you can use it as a substitute for sour cream (like on top of a bakedpotato) or in place of yogurt (such as when making a smoothie).
admittedly, tofu, when eaten on its own, tofu can be kind of bland.
