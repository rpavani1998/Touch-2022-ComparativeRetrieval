today, i’m the one who misses cooking at home when i travel.
i know that too well having been cooking-challenged for most of my life.
try to feed someone some good, simple, home-cooked meals and at one point or another you could get a conversation going about how easy it is to make and they could make it, too.
i tweaked the ingredients until we were all satisfied with the taste.
enjoy with some pita bread or place over a bed of fresh steamed rice.
the truth is, for the longest time i thought cheesecake was only made using my mom’s no-bake method.
i found a workaround so that i still had my craving for toasted coconuts satisfied in macaron form.
this one will be added to my pile of go-to quick food, with the greens adapted to what’s in season or easily available.
no-bake cheesecake and our family goes way, way back in the 80′s.
i think everyone in our family will agree –that was gut-wrenchingly sad.
cooking steel cut oats (also called irish or coarse-cut oats) as a stand-in for rice: place 1/2 cup of steel cut oats with 1 cup of water in a small pot and cook in med-high heat.
it’s only this year that i really appreciated the fact that the canadian thanksgiving is in october, i have to say.
i’ll be sewing and baking like there’s no tomorrow.
the construction is the tricky part, but i was able to do everything under an hour, including the baking time and even while shooting photos.
the tine of a fork could help, too.
add a tablespoon of water and allow to steam.
it tasted good (not the best–too sweet), but one never should have to associate cheesecake with the word lumpy (=lame).
it really does give me more time to prepare for christmas, even though i’m still trying to catch my breath and hoping i make all my deadlines.
