i saw jamie oliver fail miserably to convince kids that chicken nuggets are nasty.
her hair is wild and sun-bleached.
i do not want to tell you how long my reading list is now.
i’d heard about quinoa, so i bought it, thinking, “this is so healthy.
i make pizza often, and i usually subject everyone to my experimentation.
i still ate it with my hands and made the crust into a tool to wrap up the toppings, just like folding a new york slice.

she knows food tastes better outside.
she doesn’t get out of trying anything when it comes to the dinner table.
and a bunch of pesticide sprayed vegetables next to the farmer’s market corn.
she gets that meals don’t have to be static repetitions of weeknight canned casseroles and eating out is a chance to try something new without having to do the dishes.
every day she starts trying to pack her bento boxes with food she can grab out of the cupboard and fridge and announces that we’re going on a picnic.
amaya picked up on my vibe very quickly.
it brought the pizza together well.
that means that they are all “local”, as we say in the islands.
it has wonderful chew that seems to melt and feel chunky at the same time.
vicious animals guarding the trails.
for the hike hiking snacks, a large pole with a net attached, good eyes
we have a few places we go regularly for foraging.
if you want to vote for me, you can do so here.
for the topping 4 large handfuls of guava as much passionfruit as you can find 6-8 mountain apple (if you can restrain yourself from eating this many) 1 mango, if you’re lucky, as your tree has already been stripped
mochi wrapped chocolate dipped strawberries featuring local waialua milk chocolate and maui grown strawberries.
bibimbap is a korean dish of vegetables and meat on rice which is tossed and mixed with hot bean paste and a barely fried egg.
food is expensive here, since we live on an island in the middle of the ocean.
the quinoa wasn’t overwhelming, and it was fluffy with just the right texture.
and well, corn isn’t very good for you either.
i will buy grass fed beef and free range chicken.
i still ate it with my hands and made the crust into a tool to wrap up the toppings, just like folding a new york slice.
amaya talks about picnics non-stop.
sometimes your daughter wants to eat at taco bell even if you kind of hate yourself later.
i pause, mid-click in my bibimbap pizza photo shoot.
fruit is an instant, beautiful taste, and probably whatever you do to it will make it worse than if you had just eaten it off the tree.
i have to admit that jake and amaya like fake cheese on their nachos better than real cheese.
amaya yells when she walks in the door.
send some recipes my way so i can like it too.
when she got out the kid’s set for our “afternoon tea”, she handed me a slice of wooden bread.
sometimes she will get ready for it even before we’re awake.
mochi is a popular dessert among locals, since food in hawaii has strong japanese influence.
it is a mix of flavors that work, however odd it sounds.
bibimbap is a korean dish of vegetables and meat on rice which is tossed and mixed with hot bean paste and a barely fried egg.
(although it makes a wonderful pie, if you pick more than you can eat raw, since it lasts for about 2 days off the tree.)
we ate and amaya explored and we even picked some fruit along the path.
everything tastes better when you’re hiking.
local lunch (click on the links to print) kalua pork sandwiches with organic pork, local sea salt, local cabbage/carrot slaw, and homemade barbecue sauce made with local lilikoi (passion fruit).
i love them, but i almost never make them because they’re a total hassle.

i think this could be a great reality show on the discovery channel.
i like elaborate meals, but a simple picnic should be just that.

when i started looking ahead tochallenge #5 of foodbuzz’s project food blog, i immediately started thinking pizza.
escaping the corporation that is food today is an extra step, make that several extra steps, when you’re considering your family, your job, and your budget.

my daughter, amaya, has tons of local attitude.
i saw jamie oliver fail miserably to convince kids that chicken nuggets are nasty.
we tend to turn to cheap name brands because growing and producing here can be tougher.
recently i found out you could make oatmeal in the rice cooker.
i decided to forage for our ingredients and make ourselves an island fruit tart.
in a stone bowl that has been heated, the flavors kind of cook together and sizzle while the rice becomes crisp on the edges.

i will eat less meat but better quality.
and a bunch of pesticide sprayed vegetables next to the farmer’s market corn.
i thought a lot about the food i eat.
i packed everything in glass boxes with lids (which stack very nicely and securely), and the soft stuff i put on top.
usually our picnics are out in the yard.
as picky as she is, she gets that there is a world of taste out there, and she wants it.
especially my rules about jello, store bought cookies, and candy that doesn’t contain chocolate.
and she definitely gets that i am going to make her try my pizza.
everyone’s more relaxed and focused on enjoying the meal instead of rushing off to finish the next thing on our to-do list.
i will cook from scratch often.
the meal is not center stage.
so if i make something from it, it better be dang good.
i will avoid fast food like the plague, even if vanilla soft serve is delicious.
it just tastes uncooked to me.
i make pizza often, and i usually subject everyone to my experimentation.
i put a ratio of 1 rice cup (if you have a rice cooker, i hope you didn’t throw this away) quinoa and 3 rice cups rice (duh) and filled the water up to “rice” line 4.
i know asking for votes is kind of rude of me.
if i wanted to make a traditional fruit tart, it’s likely that i’d be spending about $20 just on the topping.
she knows when i’m on the trail for food.
sometimes we can even stock up on local avocados (which, i’m telling you, have so many varieties and flavors that haas avocados will hold no interest for you ever again).
the pizza sauce is a sweetened gochujang (hot bean paste) that mimics korean fried chicken sauce recipes i’ve had.
when our friends came over for dinner last week, one said, “yep, this is mariko pizza.”

the pizza sliced nicely and held together, but with all the toppings, you’ll want to eat this one with a fork, because you are likely more civilized than me.
there are seasons for fruit, in hawaii, despite being an average 80 degrees most of the year.
we come back with bags of fruit and the fruit flies love it as much as we do.
this tells me so much about how people have the power to change the way business is run.
i’ve highlighted the local ingredients i used in my menu.
because, hey, i have chicken nuggets in the fridge.
when i think of food as being local, it is hawaii born and bred.
luckily there are enough secrets to go around, at least until the next guide book is published.
foraging for your own fruit changes the whole game and makes you feel a little more connected with your food.
we ate our lunch at ho’omaluhia, a botanical garden, and soaked up the local beauty.
baking the egg in the oven on the rice crust and sauce made it just right, as the yolk was hot and still able to mix well with my toppings as i loaded them on.
all the food i brought could be eaten cold or at room temperature and was a spin on the traditional sandwich type picnic lunch.
she gets that meals don’t have to be static repetitions of weeknight canned casseroles and eating out is a chance to try something new without having to do the dishes.

sweet potato is a traditional side dish at a luau.
she knows when i’m on the trail for food.

the rice crust i made on a pizza pan imitated that perfectly.
i’ve also loved being exposed to some new food blogs.
fruit is an instant, beautiful taste, and probably whatever you do to it will make it worse than if you had just eaten it off the tree.
just like local people, local produce and goods thrive in tropical weather and represent diverse polynesian, asian, and american flavors.
good food without a lot of clutter.
steel cut oats are like the mother of all oatmeals.
luckily there are enough secrets to go around, at least until the next guide book is published.
the farmers markets are growing rapidly.
i will eat leftovers rather than instant.
the pizza sliced nicely and held together, but with all the toppings, you’ll want to eat this one with a fork, because you are likely more civilized than me.
of course, like i said, these things aren’t always cheap, and a bit more time consuming and inconvenient.
even though i’m not local, getting in with the locals sure has its benefits.
i made a picnic lunch that features local produce and goods, while trying to reflect local tastes and recipes.
i think my husband would love me even more if i made rachel’s candy corn pumpkins.
sometimes when i wake up i find her outside on the porch in her pajamas, eating her picnic already.
so if nothing else, this project food blog thing rocks because i feel like i’ve been let into a secret society of “people who look at blogs.”
too many dishes and stuff to set out ruin the experience you’re having with the outdoors.

mainland fruits, like blueberries, are expensive here.
i left the rice cooker on warm for four days until we finished off the bowl.
she gets that being excited about food is an extension of the pleasure of taste.

packing up dirty plates afterwards is trickier.
planning a menu to eat with your hands is much more simple and your shared experience is greater when you all have to drink your juice out of the glass jar that you brought.
they hike a few times a week and we always have passionfruit (lilikoi), guava, strawberry guava (waiwi), or mountain apples around the house.
