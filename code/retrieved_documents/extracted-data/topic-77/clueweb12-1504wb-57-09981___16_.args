the fatty acids found in coconut oil has no harmful effects and can promote better health because it has antiviral, antifungal and antimicrobial properties.here are some of the benefits of cooking with coconut oil: it can treat digestive or mal absorption problems; it can be used in commercial infant formulas; it reduces fat consumption and stimulates metabolism which can lead to weight loss; it helps regulate thyroid function, balance blood sugar level, increase energy, and promote overall heath.consequently, coconut oil, because of its high content of saturated fat and its new stigma as an "artery-clogging fat", became an undesirable and an "unhealthy" choice in cooking.in india, panama, and even jamaica, the coconut is seen as a health tonic for the heart and is consumed like a normal liquid supplement.the food therefore absorbed more fat and could cause an increase fat consumption, and worse its hydrogenated fat had a negative effect on blood cholesterol.therefore, coconut oil can help lower ldl cholesterol and prevent high cholesterol, arthritis, fibromyalgia, candida, herpes, allergies, psoriasis, influenza, diabetes, etc.in these populations, such as the populations of the polynesian islands, showed the lowest level of cholesterol and low levels of mortality from heart disease, despite the fact that the consumption of coconut oil was quite high.the general public and commercial food industry supported the idea that polyunsaturated vegetable oil, such as soybean, safflower, and corn oils, were good in reducing total cholesterol, better than coconut oil.it is the healthiest form of coconut oil because it is made with the least possible processing from fresh coconut meat and with absolutely no chemicals.unfortunately, coconut oil still continues to get a lot of criticism from alternative vegetable oil supporters despite the fact that these hydrogenated oils are not easily digested and is composed of toxic trans fatty acids.it would seem that replacing coconut oil (even palm oil) with hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as soybeans, is only beneficial to these edible oil industries and not its consumers.in the 1970s, studies indicated that saturated fat increase blood cholesterol which could increase the risk factor in the development of heart disease.a cholesterol ratio of 5.0 is normal, and above this value indicates an increasing risk of heart disease).coconut oil is stable and has a long shelf life; it could last up to three years.therefore, the mcfa from the coconut oil is easily metabolized and poses no risk to clogging the arteries, because it does not require lipoproteins or special enzymes to utilize the fat by the body.
