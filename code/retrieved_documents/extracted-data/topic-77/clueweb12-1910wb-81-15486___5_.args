so far we’ve pounded lots of meat into thin scallops, made pan sauces galore, and fried many fritters.i felt clean and sanitary.of course, since basically everything is cooked in clarified butter, i guess it would be hard to be bad.i agreed that the stew was too thin and did fix it by adding some cornstarch.so far, i’ve cooked french toast (duh, but yum!), sauteed flounder with parsley butter sauce, sauteed butternut squash with onions (and bacon, drool), and baked chicken smothered in onions.you know, that one you see on t.v. where the chef’s look so awesome flipping the food into the air and catching it in the pan.but, that class is over and now i can throw together a stew with no recipe at all.i honestly thought that the lemon tasted delicious in my white veal stew.everything turned out pretty darn good.the absolute best part of this class is that i get to work on the oh-so-cool pan flip.unfortunately, apparently, my stew was too thin and had too much lemon juice seeing as the only two comments i got from the chef were, “it’s too thin!”i thought my practical exam went very well.i gotta tell you, getting that pan flip down is making me feel like a rock star.
