with around 50% lauric acid content (an acid also found in mother's milk), it helps support a healthy metabolism and is being researched for its ability to protect against fungus, bacteria and viruses.refined cooking oils are also detrimental, with harsh processing methods altering oil molecules and creating toxins and free radicals.natural cold-pressed oils such as nut, seed, olive and fish oils, contain healthy essential fatty acids, monounsaturated fats, nutrients and phytochemicals that serve the body.omega-3 oil serves numerous bodily processes and is particularly beneficial to the immune system and heart as well as arthritis, skin conditions, pre-menstrual tension, mental function, improving memory and reducing depressive symptoms.those who still subscribe to a coconut-rich diet display low incidences of heart disease or obesity.this negatively impacts our heart, hormone,skin, and brain functions and leads to greater inflammation.insulin promotes the use of fat for storage and reduces the use of fat for fuel, hence lower insulin levels mean a greater conversion of fat for energy rather than storage.some more surprising benefits include an ability to lower cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease and actually stimulate weight loss.they place no strain on the digestive system and their availability for metabolism means they are not likely to be stored as fat (unlike high-calorie cholesterol-heavy long-chain animal fats).those who switch to more "western" ingredients, such as omega-6 laden vegetable oils, often show a remarkable increase in these illnesses and other health problems.the benefits of coconut oil's lauric acid are so strong, it is often added to baby formula to help infants develop strong and healthy systems.one of the main reasons omega 3 oil increases fat metabolism is because of its effects on insulin, significantly reducing it’s levels in the body.skin conditions – since coconut oil is moisturizing, antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory, it’s a great natural remedy for all kinds of skin problems ranging from eczema to acne to diaper rash.insulin inhibits the enzyme lipase which breaks down fat for use as energy and activates an enzyme that converts carbohydrate into fat.omega-3 oil is another virtuous fat that can actually speed up the burning of fats in the body and hence aid weight loss.
