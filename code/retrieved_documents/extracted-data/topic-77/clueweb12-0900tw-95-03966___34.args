andddddddd we printed out the recipe and got all the ingredients for the no bake granola bars to make so we can snack on it on the way to florida thanks again for everything!!!reply this is great!
i love this so much…now, if only i taught seniors in high school, i’d be able to utilize it in health class.
then i went super-healthy (like many of you super-healthy bloggers!), but honestly, i didn’t enjoy eating that healthy either haha.
summer after freshman year, i started counting calories and would only eat about 1200 calories a day (horrible, in my opinion) and those calories were usually from things like tv dinners and pudding snacks.
drinking… lots of weight gain!!reply i spent lots of time in the dining halls freshman and sophomore year.
[mostly wordless] what i ate wednesday – #8 you put a lot of thought into this and di a great job.
wish all college kids were health freaks like us haha kelsey recently posted..i got to eat fancy food love this!!!
earlier in the week, i sent over a list of some ingredients i would need them to pick up, and on the day of the presentation, i packed up a few of the ingredients i already had on hand (like tahini and brown rice syrup) and showed the girls how to make 4 easy snacks.
i wasn’t super aware of nutrition in college, i ate healthier than my friends for sure but i didn’t know what i was doing like now.
wow, this would have been so useful to me — those girls are lucky to have had your presentation!
my diet was oh so awful and consisted mainly of overly processed snacks (think oreos, doritos, poptarts, you name it) and fast-food (late night sonic or taco bells runs became almost a nightly routine freshman year) ….
freshman year, i was clueless and ate pretty unhealthy foods.
plus, miami was great because they had so many healthy options to chose from!
they pretty much gave me free reign, so i spent some time really thinking about what i wanted to talk to them about.
i actually commuted to college so i always had my own kitchen to eat from.
i’ve always been good about haphazardly slapping healthy stuff together.
in a separate bowl, microwave the brown rice syrup and peanut butter until melted.
i had a hard time in college healthwise – so many temptations, such a messed up schedule – lots of fast food and partying.
add the oil if you’re using it process for about 5 minutes or until desired consistency is reached.
my diet was pretty good.
i felt sluggish a lot of the time which was not a good feeling!
i didn’t live on campus but always brought my lunch since i’d been doing that since kindergarten i think there’s a big difference even since when i was in college to now where universities really try to make healthier options a priority on campus.
congrats on a job well done jobo recently posted..
i had a hard time in college healthwise – so many temptations, such a messed up schedule – lots of fast food and partying.
that means i spent 3 years living in the dorms.
great advice for those currently living in dorms, or even if you aren’t and are new to cooking!
even though i lived at home for 75% of my college career … i fell victim to the late night crunch sessions at school or would spend 14 hour days making sure my assigments juuuust right.
i also kind of wish our fridge and dorm room was filled with more than easy mac, juice boxes and cheez-its.
although, i will say i think i did a fairly decent job- at least better than a lot of other people haha.
used low-sodium canned tuna or chicken packed in water.
don’t worry, i didn’t go poor or hungry, but i did lose weight with little switches!
i did not eat well at all in college.
such a great message to be sending to college girls all over — it’s like an epidemic, i swear – so many women in college go into it having no clue how to eat properly and end up gaining the freshman 15 and then some.

we only had apartments for our senior year.
2 cans of chickpeas, rinsed with 1/4 c liquid reserved 1 lemon directions: poke the sweet potato and microwave for 5 minutes to cook if using.
i have to say — i sort of fell into that camp a little bit, though i was at least working out then, i definitely wasn’t eating well (as in wholesome, real, fueling foods).
my diet was oh so awful and consisted mainly of overly processed snacks (think oreos, doritos, poptarts, you name it) and fast-food (late night sonic or taco bells runs became almost a nightly routine freshman year) ….

i figured this would appeal to the masses because if these things can be made in a dorm room, with minimal equipment and a mini-fridge, then they can definitely be made in homes and apartments with even more space and equipment.
my freshman year of college i gained quite a bit of weight–having a daily breakfast of banana bread + a white chocolate mocha probably didn’t do me any favors.
fortunately, this sparked more than just a weight loss effort; i learned the ins and outs of nutrition and found that i really enjoy exercise, so today i’m more healthy and fit than ever before.
no bake granola bars-  combine oats, brown rice syrup or honey, cereal and your favorite mix-ins for a healthy snack oats in a smoothie- add cooked oatmeal or uncooked oats to your smoothies for some extra bulk and fiber.
i told them about myself and about how when i went to college the first time, we had to live on campus all 4 years.
i definitely had my fair share of late night quesadillas or hungover greasy breakfast burritos, but for most breakfast, lunches, and dinners, i took advantage of the salad station or stir-fry station in our food court to customize my own veggie-filled meals!

they take 8-9 minutes in the microwave and use oats, applesauce, egg whites, flaxseed, cinnamon, vanilla and add-ins like berries and cocoa powder.
so i started making healthy switches (grilled chicken instead of chicken tenders; less salad dressing, more lettuce; etc.).
it can totally apply to any busy person or a person with a small kitchen.

i need them to come get my fitness routine “in shape” (literally…heeheehee).
i totally wish i would have had that in college–especially the years i was living on campus.
to use in granola bars and trail mix flax seeds and chia seeds- sprinkle on oatmeal and yogurt for added omega 3′s and protein chia jam: mix 2 tbsp chia seeds, 1 cup berries, vanilla & pinch of sugar- microwave for 2 minutes, stir and let cool.
add the peanuts to the date mixture and use your hands to combine.
add the sweet potato (skin removed) and pulse to combine.
second you are truly proof that college can be healthy!!
it is possible to eat healthy in college, even when you’re living in a dorm and have limited kitchen access/equipment.
these are great solutions and better options than the cereal i lived off of my freshman year.
the dining hall food was just not that good at my school, so i basically lived off snacks!
i lived in the dorms for two years and sometimes you just get tired of dining hall food!

since we had an a la carte meal plan at baldwin-wallace, i had to pay for everything thing i ate, so the want to spend less money also helped.
