it is possible to eat healthy in college, even when you’re living in a dorm and have limited kitchen access/equipment.such a great message to be sending to college girls all over — it’s like an epidemic, i swear – so many women in college go into it having no clue how to eat properly and end up gaining the freshman 15 and then some.they take 8-9 minutes in the microwave and use oats, applesauce, egg whites, flaxseed, cinnamon, vanilla and add-ins like berries and cocoa powder.i didn’t live on campus but always brought my lunch since i’d been doing that since kindergarten i think there’s a big difference even since when i was in college to now where universities really try to make healthier options a priority on campus.fortunately, this sparked more than just a weight loss effort; i learned the ins and outs of nutrition and found that i really enjoy exercise, so today i’m more healthy and fit than ever before.i figured this would appeal to the masses because if these things can be made in a dorm room, with minimal equipment and a mini-fridge, then they can definitely be made in homes and apartments with even more space and equipment.i wanted to cover the basics of healthy eating, give them lots of ideas and inspiration, and show them that what a wide variety of food you can prepare, even if you’re living in a dorm room.freshman year, i was clueless and ate pretty unhealthy foods.i’d love to do things like this once i get my rd…to be able to visually show people how they can make better food choices.i love this so much…now, if only i taught seniors in high school, i’d be able to utilize it in health class.it can totally apply to any busy person or a person with a small kitchen.finally junior year, i started doing more research and feeding my body properly.i love to cook, bake, eat and take pictures of food.these are great solutions and better options than the cereal i lived off of my freshman year.i wanted to be skinny and have fun… that’s part of the problem most 20 year olds think they’re invincible and can subsist on starbucks, 1 meal a day, and alcohol.
