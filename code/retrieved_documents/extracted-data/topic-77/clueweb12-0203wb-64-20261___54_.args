they are a whole food, nutritious, efficient and the most inexpensive source of dietary fiber available.the right water purifier would remove harmful bacteria, protozoa, amoebae, viruses, fibers, sediment (microscopic particles of dirt, rust, scale, radioactive particles etc.), organics, and other agents such as chlorine and radioactive gasses.during an emergency you will have a number of basic needs such as alternate methods of cooking; some method of preserving perishable food; and a supply of foods that require little or no preparation or refrigeration.to be safe for culinary use, water must be rendered chemically and biologically harmless.so, in addition to adding important enzymes, increasing nutrition, saving time and effort in preparing whole foods, the yield is even a greater savings on your food budget.sprouting makes it easier to digest and adds enzymes that change the starches to sugars and proteins to amino acids.it is nutritious, healing and has the longest shelf life.in the event of nuclear war, when fallout is a problem, the dissolved and undissolved radiation particles should be removed from the water to the greatest extent possible before other purification measures are taken.commercial sprouting trays (see instructions below) water water is more essential than food in sustaining life, and over the long term needs to be constantly available from an unpolluted source.seeds for sprouting can be stored for long periods of time and can produce many times their weight in fresh produce full of vitamins, minerals, and complete proteins.some of the suggestions may not meet your special needs, but you can adapt them, with the unique and healthful recipes given.two of the most important amino acids necessary for the body to manufacture proteins are lysine and tryptophan, which are also increased significantly.in time of emergency, your source of heat may not be available and you will be forced to search for an alternate method of heating or using your food.other sources of water: lakes, ponds, ditches, and streams all have water, but it should be rendered safe before being used.sprouts can be grown in your kitchen (from beans, lentils, grains, seeds, almonds) in any season, providing you with fresh organic produce when no other garden is available.
