support athletics georgia tech's student-athletes have a proud history of bringing distinction to the institute on the playing field, in the classroom, and in their careers.it was so annoying to read and even see on abc's wide world of sports the way ali toyed publicly with frazier, and i loathed howard cosell's role in that; he gave ali too big a platform.neither can i cut loose of the notion that without frazier - who nearly beat ali to a pulp in their third fight only to find himself beaten just as badly - was no less responsible for making ali than ali himself.in truth, there may never be anything athletic as wholly captivating as the three-pack of boxing matches between joe frazier and muhammad ali in the 1970s.legend is fuzzy on some details, but it has been told that ali had told corner man, angelo dundee, to cut his gloves off as well.consequently, i was crushed when ali beat frazier twice the next four-plus years (and mortified when george foreman destroyed joe in the interim).joe frazier, i'll tell the world right now, brings out the best in me.when given chances, frazier wasn't nearly eloquent enough to blunt the blade nor slow the anvil.it's hard nowadays to believe that boxing was once taken seriously, but upon watching that one again it's not so difficult any more.honestly, i latched onto him both because at the time - when as a 7- and 8-year-old i was beginning to pick favorites in everything - he was the world heavyweight champion (at about 205 pounds, which btw is washington's listed weight), and because he was not ali.the winner of the second would earn a shot at the belt.no words can capture the complete essence of frazier-ali.upon learning that frazier had beaten ali in 1971, my week was made.this is not frazier-ali, but nobody should be surprised if the intensity of thursday night's game rivals that of championship matches.remember, tv replays were few and far between and other than sluggish newspaper and magazine accounts, word-of-mouth was king.
