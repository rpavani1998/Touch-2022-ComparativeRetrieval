they are involved in accidents, they suffered pain, financial difficulty, failed marriages, dysfunctional families, disobedient and rebellious children, abusive spouses, apathetic parents.many people are in a poor state of physical health because they eat and drink too much.the ultimate cause of all spiritual depression is unbelief.the second general cause of this condition is sheer laziness or indolence, lack of diligence.such selfish, self-focus literally disconnects us from the one who created and redeemed us to live life abundantly in his name.they seem to have had a kind of magical view of faith; that as long as you have faith all is well, that your faith will work automatically in your life, and that all you need to do as a christian is just to believe the truth.there is only one way whereby that prisoner can be justified; that is, he must be found not guilty; and if he is found not guilty, then he is justifiedâ€”that is, he is proved to be a just man.they regard god as taskmaster, they regard him as someone who is constantly watching to discover faults and blemishes in them, and to punish them accordingly.we live in an age in which people no longer wish to believe in laws that bind them because if they did, they would be guilty and afraid when they broke those laws.we worship and love god daily as we love and serve our neighbors, our family members, even strangers.well, for many of us, that bravado attracts us because we hope that if we can glean merely a nugget of wisdom from folks like them, if we can mimic their successful actions, maybe, just maybe we can have control of our lives just like them.the great antidote to spiritual depression is the knowledge of biblical doctrine, christian doctrine.only the message about jesus our savior, our substitute through whom we have forgiveness and eternal life, creates and sustains faith.it takes the same grace of god to save the most respectable person in the world as the most lawless person in the world.he is our father and he is always caring for us, he loves us with an everlasting love, he so loved us that he sent his only begotten son into this world and to the cross to die for our sins.
