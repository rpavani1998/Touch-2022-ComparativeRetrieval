my ali-frazier fight didn't turn out as i had hoped.
and if all those press releases from ea were even half-true, thenkk2000 could pull it off.
it  looked like something out ofsoul calibur (complete with a colored  inertia trail) and had me scratching my head as to why it would be in a boxing  sim.
that was probably the most fun i had playing this game, but it was short-lived because of all the flaws i mentioned above and the fact that all create-a-player features get old.
i anxiously rushed frazier and proceeded with a flurry of rights and lefts that were sure, i thought, to do damage and leave him stunned.
and again, the result was not what i expected because half my punches (as lethal as they were) completely missed their target, even at point blank range.
i won the fight, but it was a hollow victory.
but what actually  happened was that after a vicious right hook, frazier came back immediately  with a right hook of his own.
as the game intro winds down we see in-game footage of ali pulverizing an unidentified boxer.
arcade boxing fans should get a dreamcast (if you don't already have one) and get ready 2 rumble.
i didn't think much of it then so i  just backed off and decided to try out the signature moves mapped onto the four  c-buttons.
instead, it wound up being an  updated version ofbuster douglas (remember him?)
to its credit, black ops has created some excellent-looking  3d representations of boxing's greats but i wasted little time in choosing  muhammad ali with joe frazier as my opponent and caesar's palace as the  battleground.
as the game intro winds down we see in-game footage of ali pulverizing an  unidentified boxer.
and while watching muhammad ali, the greatest boxer in history, pulling off a move like this is one thing, seeing frazier do a back flip after the punch is another and i decided i had enough.
it was at this point that the bell rang and i was declared the winner.
while it may come off as below-average as compared to other gamers, it worked into the career mode wonderfully.
it's obviously supposed to showcase the game (and ali), but with the slow overall look of the action and the horrible collision detection, it actually becomes an omen for what is to come.
i've seen just about all of them on highlight films and they've always been touted as "the battle of the century" and, to be honest, a few of them actually lived up to the hype.
it was  supposed to be the first true boxing simulation, allowing me to play as the  best fighters to ever grace the boxing ring.
i was dying to see some kind of vicious flurry of blows or  something characteristic of ali, instead what i saw was a ridiculous,mortal  kombat-style uppercut.
all the boxers, yes all 25 of them, fought with all the pepper of a loaf of bread and had almost identical animations.

i've seen just about all of them on highlight films and they've always been  touted as "the battle of the century" and, to be honest, a few of  them actually lived up to the hype.
i was pleasantly surprised to see ali pull off his trademark showboating and punches, but what bothered me about those moves was how little they actually helped.
and i was left to wait for the motion-captured animation to end and get pummeled, because i was left totally open for an attack.
what managed to save the game though was its create-a-player feature and the career mode.
true boxing fans should definitely stay away.
the feel of vicious punches was missing, the characters moved too slowly, and none of the fighters distinguished themselves.
i'm sure that black ops thought  this too when they finished their design document, but from the conception  phase to the production phase, they seemed to have gotten off-track in a big  way.
i won the fight, but  it was a hollow victory.
ea went out and secured the license for all the great boxers (sans iron  mike) and put them in the game.
casual boxing fans dying to take on the boxing world as your favorite boxer should rent this game first.
it's apparent right from the beginning that kk2000 wants to be a sim.
i could create a boxer, train him, and build him up into a  championship contender.
i could only  tell them apart by their signature moves and that got old quickly.
once i got past the introductions and got the blessing of mills lane (who looks and sounds like the real thing), the fight began.

i know the lineup in  this games makes it extremely tempting, but the resulting game is a chore to  play and will only disappoint.
the only true representative  from the boxing world was mills lane (how sad is that?).kk2000 is an  improvement over the originalkk, which says more about the sheer  mediocrity ofkk than about any greatness of its sequel.

kk2000 could have been a very good game, but everything starting from the graphics engine to the game mechanics is so bungled that it leaveskk2000 down for the count.- published november 9, 1999 amazon.com recommendations
kk2000 lacked damn near every-thing i saw in  those legendary fights with the exception of the fighters themselves.
ea sports picked itself up off the mat and came back with a sequel (imaginatively enough)
before i knew it, my  punch meter was full and i knew that i could do some kind of "super  punch.
however, i had already  given up on the match of the century and decided to go through the rest of the  game.
if you're  dying for a boxing fix, then own the playstation version.

the playstation version includes 50 boxers compared to the n64's 25 and is a much truer simulation than the n64 version.
kk2000 becomes an example  of disregarding the player for the sake of landing a license; i would wager  that thekk engine had long existed before the licenses were secured and  was ported over from some generic boxing game.

add a point system (to tally your performance during a bout) and a training mode, and you have the makings of a great boxing game.
