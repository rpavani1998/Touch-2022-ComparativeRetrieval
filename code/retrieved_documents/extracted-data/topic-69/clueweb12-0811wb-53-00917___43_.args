his faith and his principles were truly inspiring, especially for those of us who needed something or someone to believe in.i now teach various sports including boxing to underprivalidged young people, many whom have been involved in crime.many people take stands in their life but seldom have to give up everything because of those principles, especially if it involves forfeiting the greatest title in the world, world heavyweight champion.ali proved that one individual can change destiny of millions and his humantarian efforsts are recognized as part of his desire to share his blessings and goodwill to all.i was a student at the university of lagos and the night was electrifying and we were convinced ali has fulfilled a heroic mission in a continent where he is admired so much.like most young men, what initially impressed me was his great fighting ability and the heart he displayed in the ring.today's athlete needs to take a lesson from the greatest and realize that without the fans they are nothing.i grew to admire his courage and was truly inspired by his conviction to his ideals.from all the brash bravado, he still deeply cherished his fans and cared and loved all of humanity.but ali risked everything because of his belief that the war in vietnam was wrong and he was willing to stake that belief against fame and money.during his exile from sports, he continued to work with the poor and less privileged, even though his future was in serious jeopardy.his life has helped me believe firmly that one shall never give up and keep fighting, i have recently named my little son muhammad ali aniba and i am just so proud of that.i have started boxing inspired by muhammad ali boxing style and have honed my skills and movements trying to do what hevused to inthe ring.i look upto ali as an inspiration to make the most of my life and to help others, whom have low self esteem, or issues that have impacted on their lives.if ever i feel down, i think of ali and the way he leads his life and the warmth he generates towards others, and soon my mood lifts and inspires me to make the most of my life and to help others.
