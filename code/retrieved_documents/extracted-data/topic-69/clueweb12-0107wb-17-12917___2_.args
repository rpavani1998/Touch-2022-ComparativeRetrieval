they used a new face wrapping technology that allows for realistic-looking facial textures to be used for each boxer and black ops copied each boxer's signature moves for even more authenticity.i could create a boxer, train him, and build him up into a championship contender.to its credit, black ops has created some excellent-looking 3d representations of boxing's greats but i wasted little time in choosing muhammad ali with joe frazier as my opponent and caesar's palace as the battleground.the playstation version includes 50 boxers compared to the n64's 25 and is a much truer simulation than the n64 version.add a point system (to tally your performance during a bout) and a training mode, and you have the makings of a great boxing game.they were oftentimes blocked or frazier would simply move out of the wayi was pleasantly surprised to see ali pull off his trademark showboating and punches, but what bothered me about those moves was how little they actually helped.the feel of vicious punches was missing, the characters moved too slowly, and none of the fighters distinguished themselves.and again, the result was not what i expected because half my punches (as lethal as they were) completely missed their target, even at point blank range.it was supposed to be the first true boxing simulation, allowing me to play as the best fighters to ever grace the boxing ring.i could only tell them apart by their signature moves and that got old quickly.and while watching muhammad ali, the greatest boxer in history, pulling off a move like this is one thing, seeing frazier do a back flip after the punch is another and i decided i had enough.kk2000 becomes an example of disregarding the player for the sake of landing a license; i would wager that thekk engine had long existed before the licenses were secured and was ported over from some generic boxing game.there are also key bonuses only available on the playstation like boxer bios, a 'classic fights' option and even a music video.i anxiously rushed frazier and proceeded with a flurry of rights and lefts that were sure, i thought, to do damage and leave him stunned.
