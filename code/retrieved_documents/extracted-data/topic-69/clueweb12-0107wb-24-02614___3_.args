its impressive lineup of boxers (which includes the wb's marlon wayans and nba's tim duncan!?!) is simply unsurpassed and there's a level of dignity and respect for the sport.in terms of modes offered, the most engaging is the 'career' mode where players can create their own personalized fighter, slowly develop his boxing skills, and then go for the championship in his respective weight class.while the nintendo 64 version sported arcade qualities like power-up punches and outrageous flips, the playstation one delivered a more well-rounded product containing realistic simulation coupled with an arcade slugfest.for those who like their boxing experiences way over-the-top, go with ready 2 rumble (preferably the dreamcast version) and stay away from the n64 version of knockout kings 2000.those looking for a more authentic interpretation of the sport, knockout kings 2000, despite its flaws, is attractive for its many impressive features.moving on now to the psx version, which has an even more impressive lineup (sans iron mike, prince nasim, and george foreman), it's worth noting that right off the bat, it does a better job of honoring legendary and contemporary boxers alike not just in its visuals, but in its gameplay as well.so while i was hampered by the complex controls and turned off by the lack of unique animation, i still enjoyed playing the game and it held my interest long enough for me work my way up to the heavyweight championship and defend it several times.boxers are modeled accurately, but the aging playstation has a hard-time breathing life into them.the repetitious animation really hurts the game because aside from their bodily appearances, none of the fighters have any trademark swaggering entrances to the ring or any distinct pre- or postfight verbal trash-talking or physical posturing that gives boxing its edgy bite (and i'm not talking about tyson again).ali stung opponents with his mouth as well as his fists.then there's the 'classic' mode that allows players to simulate legendary matches like thethrilla in manilla (ali vs. frazier), or leonard vs. durant or leonard vs. hagler.for the most part,kk2000 delivers what it promises, but strangely enough, i was able to pummel through the ranks largely utilizing only body blow combos.thankfully, training sessions incurred during the 'career' mode will actually try to 'school' players on how to properly execute the extensive techniques, but don't expect the training to be as comprehensive as it should have been considering the complexity of the controls.and i had serious reservations about the n64 version because the prospect of legendary fighters like muhammad ali, joe frazier, and sugar ray leonard participating in silly and over-the-top romps didn't seem quite right to us.kk2000 plays like a no-nonsense, yet full-featured interpretation of boxing.finally, of course, there is the obligatory antithesis, slugfest mode, which allows for less serious boxing fans to pit hefty boxers like butterbean against lighter peers like de la hoya, complete with power-up punches and other arcade touches.
