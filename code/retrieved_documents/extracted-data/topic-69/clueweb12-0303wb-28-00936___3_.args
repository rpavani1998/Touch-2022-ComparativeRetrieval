leonard was also no. 1 pugilist to make more than us$100,000,000, (one hundred million us dollars) in boxing.i clearly remember boxing titans clashing; muhammad ali v joe frazier - thrice - and especially the first roberto duran v sugar ray leonard fight.etc.), thomas hearns, wilfredo benitez and ‘marvelous' marvin hagler — as good as any boxer could be, genuine no. 1.when boxing was really boxing, there was only one no. 1 — champion — in each weight group too.andy flower, andy strauss and the english boys have shown that with planning, hard work, dedication and considerable skills too, they can justifiably be called no. 1 in test cricket.leonard lost because duran brawled better, having been brought up in the barrios, enduring and beating twice opponents like another legend, estanban de jesus.he is the one who has to go out and, for 15 rounds in the olden days, or 12 nowadays, decimate all opponents.these days, boxing is so watered down that no-one even knows who is fighting whom anymore.they looked unprepared, a poor effort for any defending champion.nearly 50,000 had gathered for ‘mano y mano', leonard v duran i, one of the best boxing matches ever.that is why i had loved that sport so much then.‘hands of stone' forced ‘the sugar-man' to fight duran's fight, a grave mistake for any no. 1.with the history that i had on roberto, i knew that he would win that first fight!indeed, he is not close to being the best all-rounder in the caribbean, but he deserves to have that moniker as he is team captain:they will go out and make things happen to keep being no. 1.
