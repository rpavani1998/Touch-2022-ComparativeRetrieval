with the history that i had on roberto, i knew that he would win that first fight!
i fail to understand how such a huge population cannot find ample replacements.
then they go to bangladesh for two tests and three odis, then to india for two tests and five odis.
no, he is not the best bowler in west indies, nor is he the best batsman either.

you can also rest assured that they will not be sitting back on their laurels, just waiting for something to happen.
india, with its internal cricket industry and politics, found out the hard way that is not an easy game in which to be no. 1.
everyone in the team is overly mesmerized by the slick, stealthy and sweet sugar ray leonard, thought to be the reincarnation of the original sugar ray robinson — except me.
andy flower, andy strauss and the english boys have shown that with planning, hard work, dedication and considerable skills too, they can justifiably be called no. 1 in test cricket.

indeed, he is not close to being the best all-rounder in the caribbean, but he deserves to have that moniker as he is team captain:
‘hands of stone' forced ‘the sugar-man' to fight duran's fight, a grave mistake for any no. 1.

india also made mistakes in losing its no. 1 test spot to england.

worryingly though, icc's "all-time team" did not even include (sir) garfield sobers, thought to be, at least, the best all-rounder ever, not to mention that many think that he is the best batsman too — no. 1.
nearly 50,000 had gathered for ‘mano y mano', leonard v duran i, one of the best boxing matches ever.
i clearly remember boxing titans clashing; muhammad ali v joe frazier - thrice - and especially the first roberto duran v sugar ray leonard fight.
next month, west indies starts its asian winter in europe, with two t-20s v world champions england at the kennington oval in london.

being no. 1 in anything is not that difficult — not when compared to remaining there, even for a short time.
with that effort against india earlier this year, one that had only one negative spot — west indies did not, as should have happened, beat india — sammy was the obvious ongoing choice.

that darren sammy has been continued as west indies captain is good, sensible news.
he is the one who has to go out and, for 15 rounds in the olden days, or 12 nowadays, decimate all opponents.
this is a good time for west indies to start climbing back to — hopefully — no. 1.

he was quite magnanimous after defeat, probably his only defeat.
india took its situation for granted, thus finding that being no. 1 is not easy.
another no. 1, curtly ambrose, would say: "nuttin' wuk suh, jack..." i cannot remember england recently being thought of as no. 1 in test cricket, though its progress is measured by ashes series.
