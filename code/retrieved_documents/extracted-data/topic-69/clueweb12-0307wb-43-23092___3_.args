getting hit in the head does more damage than being hit in the body, and a kidney punch does more damage than a blow to the arm, making it less of a button masher and more of a realistic representation of boxing.when all of these manoeuvres are used it amounts to quite an impressive, flowing battle, and for those totally uncoordinated there's the option to use the face buttons for punching.watch ali or frazier fight in real life and you can see they're totally different sorts of fighters who move and hold their weight differently.whilst at first it feels a little awkward it's meant to simulate the actions of real boxers and after a while you find the action becomes quite natural; you can work up quite a rhythm punching and blocking.more often than not you can keep hitting your opponent as they slide to the floor, and it's especially brutal if you've got them in the corner or on the ropes.there is a wealth of real life fighters from today and yesterday (including roy jones jr., lennox lewis, evander holyfield, joe frazier and muhammad ali), but if your favourite boxer isn't featured, the create-a-boxer feature is more than good enough to get you the fighter you're after.more realism comes in the form of cuts and bruises, flying blood, and rag doll physics (which kick in with the knockout punch).in the game, the only differences between fighters are the stance and the fact that some fighters move faster.the crowd, although rendered in 3d, has the same looped animations and they look to suffer from a bad frame rate, although the action in the ring itself remains steady.you earn money and unlock certain things, but they're all irrelevant: clothing, gloves and protective devices are mostly the same thing in different colours and the signature moves and taunts are used rarely (or not at all, if the face buttons are configured to punch).although they all look different, due to the robust fighter creation system, they're all essentially the same model with the same moves.throw too many punches, and the power of the punches and stamina decrease.using the left trigger, you can also weave and bob out of the way of incoming punches.however the commentary gets repetitive quickly (but fades out as you or your opponent get closer to being knocked out, replaced by a thumping heartbeat that amps up the tension dramatically) but the "street" mentality of the game, reflected in the "ghetto" style music, really sucks.the game is further enhanced by its realistic health system.
