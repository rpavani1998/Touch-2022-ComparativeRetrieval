much like today, when everyone who is rational and realistic fears the prospect of how the economy may deal them a disabling blow.

as everyone else, i’ve taken my share of rights to the jaw in one fashion or another in the course of my life.
cant get anything useful of the tv anymore.
get ready for an economic version of rope-a-dope i applaud all the efforts, individually, institutionally and by governments (even governments acting cooperatively one with another) to mitigate the damage of the economic crisis.
he tried to rally his supporters, using bombast – his unique form of braggadocio; his equivalent of a lion roaring at prey – to energize them.
he saw the looks on the faces of these people who were so close to him, and he saw what was obvious:  they were seriously concerned about what foreman would do to him.
after some period of time, the opponent will punch itself out.
at the same time, he often threw his own body against foreman’s, making foreman bear his weight.
he liked to talk the talk but he also walked the walk by being what we thought he was.
he could not fathom how ali would be loved by so many while he had virtually no fans.
every once in a while, take some step to be positioned for when the time comes that victory can be obtained (in the case of the economy, could this be an investment in the nation’s infrastructure, education, etc.?).
you couldn’t be rational and not fear him – and ali, in addition to being bombastic was also very rational and realistic about what he was to face in the ring –
on some occasions, he’d throw quick shots straight to foreman’s face.
and turn the volume up – the movie has a great soundtrack.
ali told his trainer, the legendary angelo dundee, that he had a secret plan, as he also told his fans.

as ali ran on the zaire roads, engaged with the citizens during the day, and whenever he had the opportunity, he would encourage the people to chant “boomiyay ali” over and over again.
a few minutes before the fight actually began, in his dressing room, among his most intimate supporters, ali reiterated his intention of using a secret plan.
books and bios is the way to go.

you don’t normally associate fear with muhammad ali, but fear dominated him as he prepared for the fight with george foreman.
and he had a trainer, dick sadler, tiny by comparison with foreman; and saddler would hang onto the heavy bag, and when foreman would hit this bag, saddler would literally be picked off his feet.”
by that time foreman, younger than ali, had punched himself out.
at the same time, he often threw his own body against foreman’s, making foreman bear his weight.
with his ego he could keep telling himself that he would dominate foreman.
in the first round, ali disoriented foreman by using right hand leads, which is an aberrant tactic.
there will be damage.
i think he was scared even then [at the press conference].
that he would beat him; that he would dance; that he would make a fool of him; that he would show him superior boxing; that foreman would never lay a glove on him.
so ali used the delay before the fight to continue his training and to reach out to the people of zaire, encouraging them whenever they saw him to yell: “boomiyay ali.”

and he fell unconscious after ali landed a left hook that had the effect of lifting foreman’s head so that it would be in perfect position to be smashed by ali’s right.
he had a plan: he would use the chanting of the crowd on fight night to cheer him on and, perhaps, to strike a blow to foreman’s morale.
but in fact, in his sleep or wherever his private moment came, he had to know that he did not do nearly as well against two boxers, particularly joe frazier and ken norton, whom foreman had demolished.
and even if not as deep and long-lasting as a worse case scenario, it will be serious.
if it lasts only one round, the strategy can make sense.
whenever it gets to me, i watch this movie.
the fighters had already been in zaire for several weeks, training and promoting the fight, and they decided that rather than cancel the fight, or substitute another boxer for foreman, they would simply push the date out a few weeks.

ali is a bigger than life character whose example is every bit as potent today as it was in his fighting prime.

in the first round, ali disoriented foreman by using right hand leads, which is an aberrant tactic.
that gave ali more time to endear himself to the citizens of zaire, who already adored him anyhow.
and his face was puffed-up by the relatively few, but sharp, shots that were the result of ali’s singular offensive tactic.
what would be interesting is that ali, who would train after foreman, would often pass by this large hall where training took place, and he never looked at foreman hitting the heavy bag.
maybe the best strategy is to put up defenses (obama’s economic stimulus plan?) and keep the opponent – in this case, the economy – from hurting you too hard and too often.
but it didn’t do much damage to foreman.

during that period of time, it may be the most realistic approach to emulate ali’s rope-a-dope strategy.

the truth is, i rarely see a movie once, because a movie doesn’t usually hold my attention and i either fall asleep or move on to something else.

good point of view, loved it.

as we end one year and begin the next, especially as we end this particular year and begin 2009 with gut level instincts of fear and hope, dismay and pride, watching this movie could teach an important lesson.
“i’m blacker than he is,” foreman said, referring to his actual skin color.
he would use his incredible legs to avoid foreman’s ferocious punches.
i think he was scared even then [at the press conference].
at the end of 15 minutes of pounding the heavy bag, there’d be a hole in the heavy bag – not a hole but a huge dent the size of half a small watermelon in that tremendous heavy bag – and foreman used the biggest heavy bag around.
it seems to me that of all the people i’ve seen hitting heavy bags, including sonny liston, no one hit it the way foreman did.

ali continued to let foreman hit him round after round, staying against the ropes.
all in the massive heat of the open stadium filled with ali fans who would begin to chant “boomiyay ali” whenever ali gave them the signal.
foreman won his championship by knocking joe frazier out and knocked him down something like seven times.

he just did not understand that ali was a hero because of his personality and his resistance to being drafted into the us army in 1967, for which he was suspended from boxing for three-and-a-half years.
