and it wasn't a matter of boxing, they both took, you know, in fairness, a good beating that night, but one guy had something special inside, and i for one am glad that i was alive to see that moment, to see so much courage coming out of one person.
i came away from that evening thinking that even most of his most loyal fans have only partial concept of what an extraordinary and wonderful, giving man he is.
we wouldn't have barry mcguigan, wayne mccullough, michael carruth, steve collins, and other of other irish heroes, people that i would certainly consider to be irish heroes.
i believe it's much better today than it was before, even with a few bum promoters, and i would shudder to think what mike tyson would have done in his life had he not had boxing to turn to, and cus d'amato, the guy who pulled him off the street and helped him out...
i think the most chances ever taken in boxing is when you have eighteen or nineteen different governing bodies -- as a result you've a great fighter who's got a fabulous record, wants to pick up a few titles, goes down to this ubff and he fights a guy who maybe had nine fights and no real competition, so he's mismatched, but the promoter, in that particular instance, maybe doesn't care.
the most interesting part of that section of the evening, for me, was when the las vegas casino project came up, because when michael spoke about that it was very revealing.
when you're in the boxing ring, the hardest, most difficult climb in the world is the steps into that ring, it's the biggest mountain you will ever climb, the first time you do that.
michael was all in black, looking very well, fit and tanned - i think he gets younger by the year, not older! - and lisa looked very elegant in a shiny black suit with belted jacket and pencil skirt to the knee, very dainty high-heeled shoes, and of course the wonderful tumble of blonde hair around her shoulders.
one fight that intrigued me was the last fight between muhammad ali and joe frazier, mainly because it made me wonder about the mindset of both men, and the distance they had come in their lives and their careers, as fighters and as men.
all were interrupted save michael, who had the house spellbound within seconds, though he appeared to be just casually talking, delivering the speech as smoothly as though it were regular conversation, and with no notes of any kind.
i don't think they were at all informed about him beforehand, maybe they had rashly invited him thinking he would never come!
again, he was self-effacing, murmuring that he liked to "play a little chess" (that had been suggested as one better channel for young people's diversion!), and i was itching to jump up and tell them he is a chess master, but of course i didn't!
yes, we've sold out to the last ticket, in advance, record time, so i'm delighted about that.
i asked if they had had a nice christmas and they said yes, it had been lovely, very relaxing, and it was so good to just stop and pause after all the travel of 2003, when they just seemed to be constantly jetlagged.
he only got one thing wrong as far as i was concerned - he referred to himself as 'uneducated compared to you youngsters'.
i think that with any luck there'll be younger, smarter minds than me that will help bring it to fruition, but ireland deserves a place on that strip in las vegas, and...
michael was all in black, looking very well, fit and tanned - i think he gets younger by the year, not older! - and lisa looked very elegant in a shiny black suit with belted jacket and pencil skirt to the knee, very dainty high-heeled shoes, and of course the wonderful tumble of blonde hair around her shoulders.
they didn't turn to basketball, they wanted to box, and if we didn't have boxing we wouldn't today have muhammad ali in that position, because he chose that because he loved it.
i can understand why some people would want to ban boxing, because of the way it's perceived and the way it looks.
i certainly think there should be a super-heavyweight division today, and i certainly think as well there should be an over-thirty class, and an over-forty class for older fighters, rather than throwing them in with the young tigers, just to get eaten alive because they've a got a big name
there were a lot of irish people who had no money that made their name, back to jack dempsey and people like that who made great names for themselves, and made it to the top of the world with boxing.
she is very tall and incredibly slim - in a contest, i think the supermodels would run her a poor second!
the form was that the speaker was left alone for three minutes (a bell marked the time), then he could be questioned or commented to, and he spoke for a further five minutes altogether.
it is so important that you're prepared, so yes, you experience pain, that's the choice i made, i didn't quit after my first fight, most fighters don't, of course -- but there's pain in life, there's pain in everything.
i had the pleasure of chatting to lisa while he was signing, and she was so sweet, very natural and softly and gently spoken, radiating the same warmth and sparkle from her eyes as michael does.
you're a fool today if you don't understand the business side of it as well, you need to protect yourself and believe in yourself, and only follow what's in your heart.
he was a very dignified and eloquent gentleman and spoke very well and very informatively.
if you're in business, you look at this, look at the sheer numbers, it doesn't matter that one guy is hitting the other guy or how the death occurs, the death occurs.
boxing gave me confidence.
i don't know anything about debate, obviously, these other lads are much more proficient than you
he did try other things, but he ended up in boxing and he was poetry in motion, in the sport that he loved.
i mean, i'm sure there are a lot more dangerous sports, even in martial arts that i heard you talk about earlier.
one fight that intrigued me was the last fight between muhammad ali and joe frazier, mainly because it made me wonder about the mindset of both men, and the distance they had come in their lives and their careers, as fighters and as men.
i tend to agree with things that were said on both sides tonight certainly, but the truth is, people have basketballs to turn to, or chess, but they didn't turn to that, because they really wanted to box, and freedom of choice is freedom of choice, and that's a really important thing to remember.
i think the most chances ever taken in boxing is when you have eighteen or nineteen different governing bodies -- as a result you've a great fighter who's got a fabulous record, wants to pick up a few titles, goes down to this ubff and he fights a guy who maybe had nine fights and no real competition, so he's mismatched, but the promoter, in that particular instance, maybe doesn't care.
on thursday, january 15th, 2004 i was at ucd (university college, dublin) to see michael presented with honourary life membership of the law society and take part in their boxing debate.
and it wasn't a matter of boxing, they both took, you know, in fairness, a good beating that night, but one guy had something special inside, and i for one am glad that i was alive to see that moment, to see so much courage coming out of one person.
and we opened in taiwan this morning, and we'll be in dubai by the end of the week, so we're opening new territories, and you know, bad and all as we are, we're bringing irish culture to parts of the world that haven't experienced it.
i came away from that evening thinking that even most of his most loyal fans have only partial concept of what an extraordinary and wonderful, giving man he is.
michael spoke at the end of the evening, after the other speakers, and was the only one no one interrupted as they could by the rules!
he just loves to help them and support them, and in fact he and lisa had flown in specially for the evening and were flying straight on the new york early next morning.
if you run away from pain you can go quit right now.
i had the pleasure of chatting to lisa while he was signing, and she was so sweet, very natural and softly and gently spoken, radiating the same warmth and sparkle from her eyes as michael does.
the next three months will be very trying, but if we can sneak a day i'll go down there and do what i can, but at least we're proud that we're giving some of the profits to the right causes down there.
take the time, learn about it, every aspect of it - i love every aspect of my business, you know, i've had the hard times, i've been knocked down a few times as you all know, and i've made a lot of mistakes, probably more than all of you together will ever make...
i don't know if i'll be giving up dancing, you know, time will tell, i'm sure, but it's closing up.
if you run away from pain you can go quit right now.
oh, the doctor's going to save everything!', obviously not, but we're all adults and we all understand that that can't be the case, you know.
the next three months will be very trying, but if we can sneak a day i'll go down there and do what i can, but at least we're proud that we're giving some of the profits to the right causes down there.
you have to have offence and defense, and the same thing is true in my shows.
i know, that's the danger of the game.
i mean, i'm not a big fan of don king, for instance, and those kind of fellas.
you could have to face something a lot more dangerous than just somebody's right hand when you hit the ground.
on thursday, january 15th, 2004 i was at ucd (university college, dublin) to see michael presented with honourary life membership of the law society and take part in their boxing debate.
it is a dangerous sport, but there's a lot of dangerous sports.
i mean it would be rude to out-stage one of our guests.'
as you jump out of that plane (sky-diving) you've made that decision then, that you may get hurt.
and we opened in taiwan this morning, and we'll be in dubai by the end of the week, so we're opening new territories, and you know, bad and all as we are, we're bringing irish culture to parts of the world that haven't experienced it.
there is some great quality to boxing, and whether you admit this or not, it does serve the minorities well.
at the end, the audience came down to have posters of the law society, scraps of paper, anything, signed, just to get to talk to him close-up!
and i truly believe he has only just begun to show the world what he can achieve.
i think that with any luck there'll be younger, smarter minds than me that will help bring it to fruition, but ireland deserves a place on that strip in las vegas, and...
i mean, i'm sure there are a lot more dangerous sports, even in martial arts that i heard you talk about earlier.
and when you're in there, your manager isn't there, your mom and dad aren't there to rescue you, and you quickly learn that you must prepare if you're going to get into that boxing ring.
take the time, learn about it, every aspect of it - i love every aspect of my business, you know, i've had the hard times, i've been knocked down a few times as you all know, and i've made a lot of mistakes, probably more than all of you together will ever make... (chuckles from the audience)...
i don't know if i'll be giving up dancing, you know, time will tell, i'm sure, but it's closing up.
ahh, well i loved - there's many great fights, from my point of view, hagler/hearns is one of the most exciting fights i've ever seen, certainly...
you know, we did a lot of talking tonight about chess, and i like to play a little bit of chess, and even though i can't do it very well i've learned an awful lot about it, i've learned a lot about life.
excerpt: flatley possesses an undeniable appeal as a throwback to a simpler era when men were men, and they weren't so worried about their identity that they couldn't express themselves with style and artistry.
and in my business i'll take advice from people, but i think it's important that you try everything, learn how it is, make sure you
i'm very uneducated compared to you youngsters.
as you jump out of that plane (sky-diving) you've made that decision then, that you may get hurt.
and although i'm sure the evening was really very boring for her, she remained attentive throughout, and joined in the laughter as much as michael, who seemed to genuinely enjoy it all thoroughly.
i did miss an odd word that michael said because of that, and also because he speaks so softly the audience had to almost hold its breath to catch all he said - and that they did!
flatley does it with gusto and you can see the boxer's body english every time he steps on stage.
when you decide to step into the ring against another man, and you know that when you're there you're going to cause some damage, so is he, he's trying to take your head off, that's part of it.
check out the fight choreography in lord of the dance where flatley, at 40-plus, makes you believe he could still go a strong five or six rounds.
it was a lovely gesture that they both came, and i think that had sunk in to the organisers once they had met and talked to them, as the host of the evening came in to apologise for the delay starting (due to a 'media circus' in the hallway!) and said very warmly that he has just met and talked to michael and what an extremely nice guy he was!
but i do know that going to school every day i was in fist fights, and they're no fun!
know your business, anyone that's going into the arts.
she is very tall and incredibly slim - in a contest, i think the supermodels would run her a poor second!
right down to the antagonistic facial expressions he casts at his arch-rival, the guy still looks every inch a fighter.
there were a lot of irish people who had no money that made their name, back to jack dempsey and people like that who made great names for themselves, and made it to the top of the world with boxing.
all were interrupted save michael, who had the house spellbound within seconds, though he appeared to be just casually talking, delivering the speech as smoothly as though it were regular conversation, and with no notes of any kind.
any kid who's ever had the word "footwork" drilled into him time and again ought to watch the "riverdance" or "lord of the dance" videotapes in which flatley performs to see how a boxer's feet can move.
you know, we did a lot of talking tonight about chess, and i like to play a little bit of chess, and even though i can't do it very well i've learned an awful lot about it, i've learned a lot about life.
when the event started, michael walked in, no "minders" in evidence, and sat with simon block at the back of the platform, and lisa took a front seat in the corner, also unaccompanied.
ahh, well i loved - there's many great fights, from my point of view, hagler/hearns is one of the most exciting fights i've ever seen, certainly...
i looked at the stats myself, and just what you said about the people in the thousands in the different sports and how many lives are lost, you're absolutely right, i looked at that myself, but there's eighty deaths every single day in the united states from handgun murders, and certainly that should take a lot more of our time.
i believe it's much better today than it was before, even with a few bum promoters, and i would shudder to think what mike tyson would have done in his life had he not had boxing to turn to, and cus d'amato, the guy who pulled him off the street and helped him out...
it would be a much fairer game, as far as i'm concerned, if we brought it back to one governing body, and we had more weight classes.
he gave, in my view, a superb demonstration of really professional public speaking, very quiet and calm, speaking slowly enough to be followed by everyone, and forming complete and natural sentences.
when you decide to step into the ring against another man, and you know that when you're there you're going to cause some damage, so is he, he's trying to take your head off, that's part of it.

finally, after one more photo call, the theatre emptied, michael and lisa left with the evening's host and one or two other people, and i and the friend who had come with me, headed out into the hideously windy, dark and wet irish night and found our way to the car park to go home!
he and lisa both chatted to all who came to them, and they must have been there near half an hour, totally informal and delightfully relaxed.
yet he conveyed his passion and energy just the same.
i know that's not specifically why we're here today, but there are more important things than this sort of sport, and i think, all in all, if you weigh up the balance, boxing has done a lot more good than it's done bad.
i looked at the stats myself, and just what you said about the people in the thousands in the different sports and how many lives are lost, you're absolutely right, i looked at that myself, but there's eighty deaths every single day in the united states from handgun murders, and certainly that should take a lot more of our time.
the form was that the speaker was left alone for three minutes (a bell marked the time), then he could be questioned or commented to, and he spoke for a further five minutes altogether.
the evening was not what was suggested by all the advertising, as i imagined a large crowd after all the hype through the week, several snippets in the press, even a tv announcement that morning, but the lecture theatre remained not filled and i doubt there were more than 50 people present, including about ten press photographers clicking away - not great for my little old tape recorder as one was right in front of it!
i appreciate you asking me here to speak, although i'm not sure after hearing everything i've just heard that i can add anything valuable to help you make your decision, but i'll do my best.
boxing gave me confidence.
it would be a much fairer game, as far as i'm concerned, if we brought it back to one governing body, and we had more weight classes.
i learned how to fight and it gave me a little confidence on the inside, and i daresay it saved me in a lot of different situations.
there is some great quality to boxing, and whether you admit this or not, it does serve the minorities well.
after that the audience were invited to ask questions, not just on boxing, and only then i think they began to open up, realising this man had a lot more to share than they had thought!
sugar ray leonard, one of the greatest businessmen in america today, was a champion, superstar boxer, and there's nothing wrong with his brain, he's a sharp guy.

he wants to pick up the belt and get the big money fight.
and although i'm sure the evening was really very boring for her, she remained attentive throughout, and joined in the laughter as much as michael, who seemed to genuinely enjoy it all thoroughly.

yeah, you know my schedule doesn't permit for me to go down there right now, i've to go to new york tomorrow morning and do a lot of stuff.
you could have to face something a lot more dangerous than just somebody's right hand when you hit the ground.
and when you're in there, your manager isn't there, your mom and dad aren't there to rescue you, and you quickly learn that you must prepare if you're going to get into that boxing ring.

but i will say, from a young man's point of view, and i particularly admired nicholas here, because here's a young man who's actually had the experience, he's been there, he can actually talk from (the point of view of) a man who's been in the ring and knows the feeling.

he did try other things, but he ended up in boxing and he was poetry in motion, in the sport that he loved.
i was a small, skinny white kid in a mostly black and mexican neighbourhood, and i got picked on.
