this illustrates thoroughly how divisive political agendas can separate afrikan people and any peoples who basically believe in freedom and empowerment.frazier had just emerged victorious from his epic 1971 encounter against muhammad ali, in a fight that was cast as a culture war between the "draft dodger" ali and the "establishment hero" joe frazier.in retirement he would express joy at any role he may have played in ali's parkinson's disease.it's also true that when ali was forced into exile for resisting the draft, it was joe frazier who gave ali money when many others turned their backs on "the greatest."his later attempts to "promote" their fights were even uglier and abusive.muhammad ali, however was a truly great boxer and his refusal to fight in vietnam where, 'no vietnamese ever called him n---,' was the correct decision to make.the only reason frazier was asked to speak to the south carlonia legislature was because he beat ali and they wanted ali to be beaten so badly.further examination reveals these influences run the gamut in terms of their attitudes, behavior, morals, and politics.ali said to frazier, "you just keep whupping those guys in the ring, and i'll keep fighting uncle sam and one day we'll make a lot of money together" but by 1971, both men were playing their roles.when ali famously lit the torch at the 1996 olympics, frazier expressed grief that he couldn't be there to shove ali into the fires.it is certainly true that ali and frazier were friends before their conflicts consumed frazier with fury.this shouldn't have been joe frazier's fate: rejected by the same establishment so quick to embrace him when it suited their needs.and he came back home and put his skills to good use, by becoming a member of the black panther party and keeping many afrikan people alive when j edgar hoover's cointelpro 'counter intelligence' program sought to disrupt and dis-unify and kill everyone everyone from the rev dr. martin luther king, jr. and the southern christian leadership conference to el hajj malik el shabazz and the organization of afro-american unity to the bpp.everyone is aware that ali always berated his opponents to sell tickets to his fights.this shouldn't have been joe frazier's fate: the convenient hero of everyone who wanted to see ali punished for his politics.
