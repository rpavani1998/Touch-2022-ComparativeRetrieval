he wasn’t going to beat people with his physical skills, so he figured out a way to keep relentless pressure on until he could find a way to land a left hook that surely was one of the most beautiful punches in boxing.“joe never forgave muhammad ali for what he did to him, but joe frazier proved that he wasn’t only a great fighter but a great man.”neither he nor ali were ever the same after the brutal bout, and frazier would have only one more meaningful fight, a second knockout loss to foreman.ali put out a statement saying he would always remember frazier with respect and admiration, something frazier surely would have scoffed at.frazier wasn’t going to surrender his heavyweight title until the referee mercifully put an end to the carnage in jamaica.frazier barely stood 5-foot-10, never weighed more than 205 or so.the 40th anniversary of the fight of the century was looming, and frazier was more than happy to talk about a memorable night long past.he fought ali the way he fought everyone, with his chin planted on his opponent’s shoulder, because that was the only way he could fight.they saw frazier do what no man had done before — beat the great ali.in the end, he’ll go down as one of the great heavyweights ever, a man who fought hard in ali’s shadow, then fought even harder to get out of it.ali found a way to beat him in their final two fights, too, including a fight so epic that boxing people simply shake their heads when asked what happened at the thrilla in manila.though blinded by his swollen eyes, frazier still tried to fight the 15th round against one of the greatest fighters ever.not the fans who scraped together enough money to get a cheap seat in the rafters, and certainly not the celebrities and various rogues of the night who dressed in their finest to parade around ringside before the bout.he would burn through all the riches he made in the ring, ending up in an apartment over his gym in philadelphia.it didn’t work against foreman because foreman was simply too big, too powerful.
