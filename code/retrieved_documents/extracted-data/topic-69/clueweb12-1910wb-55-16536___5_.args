what ali did against foreman may be a role model for how americans can deal with the economy.the fighters had already been in zaire for several weeks, training and promoting the fight, and they decided that rather than cancel the fight, or substitute another boxer for foreman, they would simply push the date out a few weeks.despite his friendly and gentle personality today, george foreman was a ferocious boxer.you couldn’t be rational and not fear him – and ali, in addition to being bombastic was also very rational and realistic about what he was to face in the ring –much like today, when everyone who is rational and realistic fears the prospect of how the economy may deal them a disabling blow.he had a plan: he would use the chanting of the crowd on fight night to cheer him on and, perhaps, to strike a blow to foreman’s morale.he just did not understand that ali was a hero because of his personality and his resistance to being drafted into the us army in 1967, for which he was suspended from boxing for three-and-a-half years.a few minutes before the fight actually began, in his dressing room, among his most intimate supporters, ali reiterated his intention of using a secret plan.ali is a bigger than life character whose example is every bit as potent today as it was in his fighting prime.you don’t normally associate fear with muhammad ali, but fear dominated him as he prepared for the fight with george foreman.but in fact, in his sleep or wherever his private moment came, he had to know that he did not do nearly as well against two boxers, particularly joe frazier and ken norton, whom foreman had demolished.in the first round, ali disoriented foreman by using right hand leads, which is an aberrant tactic.so ali used the delay before the fight to continue his training and to reach out to the people of zaire, encouraging them whenever they saw him to yell: “boomiyay ali.”you couldn’t be rational and not fear him – and ali, in addition to being bombastic was also very rational and realistic about what he was to face in the ring –there are many iconic pictures of ali, but the look on his face, as seen in the movie, is powerful.ali told his trainer, the legendary angelo dundee, that he had a secret plan, as he also told his fans.
