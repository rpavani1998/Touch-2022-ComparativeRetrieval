there is some great quality to boxing, and whether you admit this or not, it does serve the minorities well.i learned how to fight and it gave me a little confidence on the inside, and i daresay it saved me in a lot of different situations.he is so passionate about promoting ireland well, and giving its people new opportunities on the world stage in every area.one fight that intrigued me was the last fight between muhammad ali and joe frazier, mainly because it made me wonder about the mindset of both men, and the distance they had come in their lives and their careers, as fighters and as men.take the time, learn about it, every aspect of it - i love every aspect of my business, you know, i've had the hard times, i've been knocked down a few times as you all know, and i've made a lot of mistakes, probably more than all of you together will ever make...it is so important that you're prepared, so yes, you experience pain, that's the choice i made, i didn't quit after my first fight, most fighters don't, of course -- but there's pain in life, there's pain in everything.there were a lot of irish people who had no money that made their name, back to jack dempsey and people like that who made great names for themselves, and made it to the top of the world with boxing.and it wasn't a matter of boxing, they both took, you know, in fairness, a good beating that night, but one guy had something special inside, and i for one am glad that i was alive to see that moment, to see so much courage coming out of one person.he would emerge as a champion in any given role that he did, but thank god he had somewhere to make use of his talents, and i think that was one of the greatest fights ever.i think the most chances ever taken in boxing is when you have eighteen or nineteen different governing bodies -- as a result you've a great fighter who's got a fabulous record, wants to pick up a few titles, goes down to this ubff and he fights a guy who maybe had nine fights and no real competition, so he's mismatched, but the promoter, in that particular instance, maybe doesn't care.and when you're in there, your manager isn't there, your mom and dad aren't there to rescue you, and you quickly learn that you must prepare if you're going to get into that boxing ring.boxing gave me confidence.i know that's not specifically why we're here today, but there are more important things than this sort of sport, and i think, all in all, if you weigh up the balance, boxing has done a lot more good than it's done bad.take the time, learn about it, every aspect of it - i love every aspect of my business, you know, i've had the hard times, i've been knocked down a few times as you all know, and i've made a lot of mistakes, probably more than all of you together will ever make... (chuckles from the audience)...sugar ray leonard, one of the greatest businessmen in america today, was a champion, superstar boxer, and there's nothing wrong with his brain, he's a sharp guy.
