but it he is not a real boxer and the guy the movie is loosely based on (chuck wepner), stallone financially stiff armed.
ali taunted frazier for being an uncle tom.
ali is a great human being.
the first african american man to address the south carolina state legislature after the civil war wasn't booker t. washington or w.e.b. dubois or dr. martin luther king.
everyone is aware that ali always berated his opponents to sell tickets to his fights.
it was all meant to promote the fight" joe frazier didn't want to hear apologies.
this forum is for dialog between edge of sports readers.
he told jokes to great laughter about growing up in beaufort and saying, "yes bawse and no bawse" no matter the question.
without ali we would not even be talking about frazier today.
frazier had just emerged victorious from his epic 1971 encounter against muhammad ali, in a fight that was cast as a culture war between the "draft dodger" ali and the "establishment hero" joe frazier.
that statue of rocky also left me dumbfounded.
the noi threatened ali repeatedly, and feed him many of "his" best lines about those vietcong, etc.
he said that because he loved america, he'd proudly fight in vietnam.
ali said to frazier, "you just keep whupping those guys in the ring, and i'll keep fighting uncle sam and one day we'll make a lot of money together" but by 1971, both men were playing their roles.
this shouldn't have been joe frazier's fate: rejected by the same establishment so quick to embrace him when it suited their needs.
but that doesn't make it any less of a full embrace of his role as the "good one" in the ali-frazier melodrama.
yet there was ali lighting the torch while he was stuck at home.
in 1971, who would have thought it would end this way, ali carrying the torch for good ole usa, frazier kicked to the curb.
posted by ashley on 11/10/11 at 10:05 pm ali/ frazier ali was the consumate entertainer and at the same time one of the greatest sports figure the world has ever known.

the roots of his anger were deeper than just anything uttered by muhammad ali.

posted by conspiracy brother on 11/10/11 at 6:03 pm that is really sad... and ironic.
in reflecting upon the life and times of smokin' joe fraizer and muhummad ali (and his inevitable demise) let us never for forget that let "he/she who is devoid of good, bad, and ugly aspects" throw the first stone.
if you were against the war in vietnam, you rooted yourself hoarse for ali.
but that doesn't make it any less of a full embrace of his role as the "good one" in the ali-frazier melodrama.
this shouldn't have been joe frazier's fate: the convenient hero of everyone who wanted to see ali punished for his politics.
in the end, the powers that be only love you to the extent they can use you and profit from you (you listening magic johnson).
this shouldn't have been joe frazier's fate: internalizing and nursing every barb from "gaseous cassius" instead of letting it roll off his back.
in retirement he would express joy at any role he may have played in ali's parkinson's disease.
the beaten champ said frazier was "consorting with the enemy."

ali said to frazier, "you just keep whupping those guys in the ring, and i'll keep fighting uncle sam and one day we'll make a lot of money together" but by 1971, both men were playing their roles.
he spoke verses on how "black and ugly" frazier was.
watch hbo's thrilla in manila if you want a more realistic protrayal of their relationship than zirin gives in his white-washed, commercialized-radical version of ali.
he had, in ali's eyes, become a hero to the very people who as a young man in south carolina wouldn't have even spit in his direction.
frazier also, and less remembered, taunted ali for being against the war.
you can't expect to find your sense of worth and dignity from trying to please the master.
further examination reveals these influences run the gamut in terms of their attitudes, behavior, morals, and politics.
muhammad ali, however was a truly great boxer and his refusal to fight in vietnam where, 'no vietnamese ever called him n---,' was the correct decision to make.
the only reason frazier was asked to speak to the south carlonia legislature was because he beat ali and they wanted ali to be beaten so badly.
he had, in ali's eyes, become a hero to the very people who as a young man in south carolina wouldn't have even spit in his direction.
i guess ali was not being completely inaccurate in his characterization of frazier.
he said that because he loved america, he'd proudly fight in vietnam.
he never dodged a draft.
the man doesn't have a hateful bone in his body.
comrade zirin takes frazier to task for speaking to the south carolina legislature-- which incidentally had more black legislators at the time than in new york.
this sad story just speaks to the complex nature of what it's like to be black in this society.
just as a thought: ancestor geronimo ji jaga pratt served in the military as well.
if you were against the war in vietnam, you rooted yourself hoarse for ali.
speaking in a room with a confederate flag backdrop in front of a chamber with only three black representatives among its 170 elected officials, frazier's message was gentle.
in retirement he would express joy at any role he may have played in ali's parkinson's disease.
while the chamber and national media swooned, ali seethed.
one of 13 children born in abject poverty in beaufort, south carolina, it's certainly understandable why he would accept the historic invite.
yet there was ali lighting the torch while he was stuck at home.
if that not true hate, i don't know what is.
this shouldn't have been joe frazier's fate: internalizing and nursing every barb from "gaseous cassius" instead of letting it roll off his back.
yet comrade zirin ignores the fact that ali attended a ku klux klan rally to support racial separatism.

then his own 10 year old daughter, to great cheer stood and said, "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

it's also true that when ali was forced into exile for resisting the draft, it was joe frazier who gave ali money when many others turned their backs on "the greatest."
"smokin' joe" deserved so much better.
for frazier, it was more scarring than any punch in ali's arsenal.
he spoke verses on how "black and ugly" frazier was.
the establishment had chosen the anti-hero, and joe frazier was cast merely as the foil and the fool.
when ali famously lit the torch at the 1996 olympics, frazier expressed grief that he couldn't be there to shove ali into the fires.
seen from the eyes of the dominant culture frazier was the flag waving accommodationist ("our black") and ali was the anti-war militant ("their black").
it is certainly true that ali and frazier were friends before their conflicts consumed frazier with fury.
however, frazier always hated ali for the things he said about him.
the roots of his anger were deeper than just anything uttered by muhammad ali.
i can see why he "chippy".

i can believe ali's apologies to frazier but i don't believe frazier's apologies were sincere
his later attempts to "promote" their fights were even uglier and abusive.
and he came back home and put his skills to good use, by becoming a member of the black panther party and keeping many afrikan people alive when j edgar hoover's cointelpro 'counter intelligence' program sought to disrupt and dis-unify and kill everyone everyone from the rev dr. martin luther king, jr. and the southern christian leadership conference to el hajj malik el shabazz and the organization of afro-american unity to the bpp.
"smokin' joe" deserved so much better.
i can understand frazier's hatred for ali.
this illustrates thoroughly how divisive political agendas can separate afrikan people and any peoples who basically believe in freedom and empowerment.
if one were to examine the influences upon one of america's inconic giants, i.e., mlk, jr, one would realize his intellect and persona were informed by a slew of influences.
for frazier, it was more scarring than any punch in ali's arsenal.
ali, however, didn't wait forjoe's talk at the legislature to insult him at a very embarrassing personal level.
