after the commencement, there was a short break while everyone filed out of the huge tent.
my brother ali, i hope to meet you in person one day.
you are one of my biggest role model right next to my parents.
my son wanted to become a professional fighter karate, but it did and now disabled until we do not care about anyone.
we went back and he gave her his autograph.
as famous as he is, he is still a man of the people.
also i continue to be sabotaged from employment and name slandered across the counties of orange, los angeles and inland empire.
to you drawn coach - disabled from chechnya, which the disease resides in france (year-round needs a warm maritime climate).
he arrived with no limo, no fancy entourage.
i know so many people will achive greater height from the contribution of these noble men.

it was clear that ali wanted to spend more time with the people who had had come to see him.
i know so many people will achive greater height from the contribution of these noble men.
ali then became my role model, i bought the film, put posters of him in my room, made a movie about him for a school project.
afterward, i realized that when you look into ali’s eyes, you are looking into his soul.
brother, i hope that this time, my appeal will give your hands and you do so, as in this case should go my brother in the faith of muhammad ali which i fought and won in his youth as he and insha allah.
i spoke to more than 1,000 firms and companies in the world to help me, but i refused to wisdom, which is what is still important and could not believe it when i write, that if they refuse me, allah (st) - god will punish them because you can not deny coach - disabled in a world that so many years risking his life and brings free karate teaches children and young people and wherever possible helps seriously ill children in preparations for the treatment of the world and always at least the possibility of sharing with them their pensions .
and im the greatest of all times, i want a match with him but he is too ugly and old for this , i repeat too ugly and old, so send that sucker my personal request that i hate him
you are a great human being.
a little boy handed him a book that he had done in crayon entitled "the greatest," and you could see by the glint in his eye that ali was touched by the boy’s effort.
now at last in 2009 i got a elegant tatoo depicting the greatest, mr ali himself.
on the 31st may , i was involved in a freak accident, where on walking to get my sunday paper, an elderly gentleman lost control of his jaguar car and mounted the sidewalk and crushed me against a wall, where with very serious leg injuries i was trapped for over 30 minutes untill be released by the fire dept and rushed to hospital.
i would love to meet the man of whom my father still holds memories.
my grandmother went to sit with old friends nearby.
it was thanks to listening and watching you fight and talk that pushed me to my limits and made me fight against the odds, so here weare again...you saving me and me sending the gift of faith and hope to you my dear dear gentleman...
dear brother muhammad ali, if you can - help me for the sake of allah (st).
on easter sunday, 1976 my family and i were headed to 6flags in virginia and as always, i had my camera with me.
afterward, i realized that when you look into ali’s eyes, you are looking into his soul.

due to illegal acts displayed by various orange county (california) law enforcement, currently my metro cell telephone (313-740-5268) and e-mail services are illegally monitored and automobiles are gps captured for tracking purposes.
people who mistook the tv image for real missed out.
i was repeatedly told that i would never amount to anything.
his confidence in himself and his faith would not let anyone or anything stop him from fulfilling his destiny.
ali has made me believe in myself, and my ability.
later that day i thought it would be nice if she could get his autograph.
as well as having grace,style,speed,beauty in the ring,he also has all these plus more outside the ropes.
and that’s why i wanted to meet muhammad ali, so i could thank him personally.
we hitchhiked from ill to new york city for the fight - quite an adventure as we were thrown off the tollways twice by state troopers and gained the largest segment of our trip from an awol soldier in a stolen vehicle.
i spoke to more than 1,000 firms and companies in the world to help me, but i refused to wisdom, which is what is still important and could not believe it when i write, that if they refuse me, allah (st) - god will punish them because you can not deny coach - disabled in a world that so many years risking his life and brings free karate teaches children and young people and wherever possible helps seriously ill children in preparations for the treatment of the world and always at least the possibility of sharing with them their pensions .
during his exile from sports, he continued to work with the poor and less privileged, even though his future was in serious jeopardy.
to end our very special day he was put into a convertable car to ride in the parade and we were standing in line watching him go by when i yelled to him your still pretty muhammad and he yelled back your pretty too, then he noticed my daughter by my side again!
manufacfuring which i arrange and gone for the traning in kano 4 good 2 years and hope to have the assistance in any way possible i look forward to hear from you as soon as possible yours faithfully usman shehu ahmed.
laurie kept saying that ali kept looking back at me and glaring.
but i do remember how he was so loved by those around him and what a great presence he had with the whole audeince at the time.
i have started boxing inspired by muhammad ali boxing style and have honed my skills and movements trying to do what hevused to inthe ring.
i recognized him instantly, i think i must have been the first.
him gave a disability but did not give pension( we immigrants and us can do anything ) and we submitted to the tribunal, but the result is still unknown, and when it is also unknown, because we have a social advocate, and to hire a lawyer in our normal no money.
his wife then showed up and tried to persuade him that it was time to go.
first i know ali from my brother, and the i search on youtube, and i just see the greatest is playing.
anyway i guess you can see how much ali meant to us and how to this day i continue to admire this true treasure and unique american hero.
he was speaking at oswego state college and my father was huge fan of his and he toook me with him to hear him talk.
truly your biggest fan, harman yonis number of responses1 percentage of responses(3%) muhammmad ali is ugly , i repeat muhammad is ugly, i know nobody is like him besides me i repeat " besides me" , im 21 yrs old , im more faster , im handsome and im the greatest of all times, i want a match with him but he is too ugly and old for this , i repeat too ugly and old, so send that sucker my personal request that i hate him
he held and kissed every baby and child with no regard for age or race.
every day i wake up looking at my hero and thinking that he can do the impossible then i can.
i was abused by my stepfather to the point that i was too badly bruised to attend school.
but with all my good fortune, i have never forgotten my roots and how i got to this point in my life.
a little boy handed him a book that he had done in crayon entitled "the greatest," and you could see by the glint in his eye that ali was touched by the boy’s effort.
as we drove through our neighborhood that early morning, which bordered the sheraton hotel in landover maryland, i noticed a group of very large men and in the ceter of the group was muhammand ali.
it would be a memory of a life time to get a chance to meet with him, just once.
in my mind, i would imagine that i was just like ali.
on the second day of my entire face was bruised (as in my opponent ), body ached, and we with him tuscany dismantling the magistrate, but i was happy because i knew that i had won the hardest fight of his life, because iovercame in himself defended his weaknesses and your name in part from ridicule, because if i would have lost this fight, i and my brothers chechens - the muslims would lose face
but with all my good fortune, i have never forgotten my roots and how i got to this point in my life.
today, i am 46 years old and living a life i could only have dreamed of 25 years ago.
i yelled for my father to stop the car its ali and before the car could stop, my brothers and i had the doors open and were running towards ali.
she then told me that he was a famous boxer.
the honorees were already inside, with a swarm of people around ali, as you'd expect.
later on i became boxer i played boxing.
i first met the champ in 76 in landover, md while he was training at the sheraton for match w/ jimmy young.
because on that day, i met muhammad ali.
thanks maren this is personally post only not for a website!
his faith and his principles were truly inspiring, especially for those of us who needed something or someone to believe in.
mike, my brother, i lost everything in this life because of two wars in chechnya: the mother and many relatives and friends whom i could not even last farewell.
i was abused by my stepfather to the point that i was too badly bruised to attend school.
i no one helped me and always a refusal, even when it was about saving the lives of children - disabled.
anyway i guess you can see how much ali meant to us and how to this day i continue to admire this true treasure and unique american hero.
every day i wake up looking at my hero and thinking that he can do the impossible then i can.
the life of ali made me have more confidence in myself and better self esteem.
with hope and respect for coach - disabled, volunteer ruslan idrisov - official representative (volunteer like all 30 years)
i sincerely hope that before one of us leaves this life that goal will be met.
by spreading the word through all the social networks i can set up, i also treasure my time on the ali centre website, and when i next get some wages, i will join up and treat myself to a t- shirt and baseball cap...i'm 49 but feel 24...dear muhammad your strength and courage against the odds have most probably saved my life more than once....
ali nodded, gave me another hug and smiled.

he then stepped over and gave me a big hug as well.
dear brother, i appeal to the many years of muslim rulers: saudi arabia, brunei, kuwait, united arab emirates, bahrain, qatar, oman, jordan, malaysia, but my letters to them, do not get - they just throw in their environment in the dustbin - although i'll forgive them for the sake of allah (st) to transfer my appeal recipients.
you are a true great ali, all the best.
it would be a memory of a life time to get a chance to meet with him, just once.
he took special time with the elderly and especially young children.
he told his security to bring her to sit with him in the convertable for a few min it was a glorious day and she still talks of it, and i still remember the glimmer in his eye and the size of his hand , and the feeling that my hand was swallowed in his.
then i saw pictures of joe frazier, i suddenly realized, that the real winner got robbed of the decision.
we went back and he gave her his autograph.
number of responses1 percentage of responses(3%) july 31,1977 muhammed ali came to baltimore as a favor to help raise money for a local women, who had gotten scholorships for poor gifted black children... to the best private schools , before there were any government programs.
(note: this notice does not apply to those news items already copyrighted and received through wire services or other media.)
i came to france with his family to survive the most (frequent pulmonary hemoptysis threatened my life) and that children could have a future, and we are here to defeat the contrary.
while we were waiting outside the bookstore for ali’s arrival, we noticed a small church in a run-down building across the street.
but i will know, if muhammad get this post.
after the speech was over he was very gracious and let me on stage so my dad could take a picture of me with him.
like most young men, what initially impressed me was his great fighting ability and the heart he displayed in the ring.
i then fought many times in my life defending justice, walking on knives, going against the crowd, against the authorities (1983 anti-soviet hunger strike 35 days) has passed two of the war, went to the bullets and bombs, and choked with his own blood, but never ever allah (st ) did not give me a reason to show their weakness and cowardice to show and when i did is bad, i think this fight
his life has helped me believe firmly that one shall never give up and keep fighting, i have recently named my little son muhammad ali aniba and i am just so proud of that.
recently iwas challenged to share this story .
manufacfuring which i arrange and gone for the traning in kano 4 good 2 years and hope to have the assistance in any way possible i look forward to hear from you as soon as possible yours faithfully usman shehu ahmed.
mike, my brother, i lost everything in this life because of two wars in chechnya: the mother and many relatives and friends whom i could not even last farewell.
later that day i thought it would be nice if she could get his autograph.
i remember crying, after i saw pictures of his swollen jaw.
i heard someone say once that ali was a credit to his race.
i am also grateful to ali whose legacy for pragmatism, lack of fear and grace has affected the perception of blak people world wide.
i and my family not nor home nor health, nor the possibility of a normal life, and for my eldest son became disabled after a head injury in 2009 that his back at work cowardly attacked the french brass knuckles addicts who have failed deal with him face to face and he lay 15 days in a coma, but the will of allah (st) survived, but not fully recovered.
on easter sunday, 1976 my family and i were headed to 6flags in virginia and as always, i had my camera with me.
i remember crying, after i saw pictures of his swollen jaw.
my daughter had drawn him a cute litte pencil sketch of two boxers and one was sweating heart shaped beads of sweat, my daughter lindsey broke free from us and ran to him with her precious drawing in hand,, the secruity pushed her back but when muhammand saw what was happening he took his big hand and wave the secruity aside, he bent down so gently and hugged her.
i am currently working on a paper for one of my classes, but i am procrastinating and watching videos of muhammad ali's poems, fights and interviews.
i remember feeling alot better.
some 4 years ago i had lost my way working too hard , losing my family and children, being very selfish...
after serving two years, i came home, opened the first section of karate in chechnya, and since then, and began to teach their students free karate and to the extent possible to help children - the disabled and since i was born and in my cherished dream.
during his exile from sports, he continued to work with the poor and less privileged, even though his future was in serious jeopardy.
that is what happened to him and we fought without gloves.
from all the brash bravado, he still deeply cherished his fans and cared and loved all of humanity.
some of the only memories he has are those of "horse playing" with the greatest in the hallways, and bathrooms of central high school.
so he began play box to ease my nervousness and then hugged me again and smiled.
but ali risked everything because of his belief that the war in vietnam was wrong and he was willing to stake that belief against fame and money.
this is personally post only not for a website!
to say it touched me would not give the moment justice.
because of the illegal acts displayed i have no freedom, rights or privacy and continue suffering 7+years
a few years later, i was lucky enough to have his picture taken holding my 18 month old son.
as time passed, i still heard about him and as a kid i always asked myself if he was a muslim just like me.
i would just like to say "thank you" to muhammad ali.
ali was training for the shavers fight,but when i shared the story and that children were involved i was given access to mahummad.
laurie kept saying that ali kept looking back at me and glaring.
due to illegal acts displayed by various orange county (california) law enforcement, currently my metro cell telephone (313-740-5268) and e-mail services are illegally monitored and automobiles are gps captured for tracking purposes.
i would love to meet the man of whom my father still holds memories.
one of my wish before i leave this planet would be to meet with a man who i looked upon to fight my fears and to become a strong and fearless fighter with an unbreakable spirit.
from all the brash bravado, he still deeply cherished his fans and cared and loved all of humanity.
after the speech was over he was very gracious and let me on stage so my dad could take a picture of me with him.
i have now got hold of a copy of 'more than a hero' by hana ali...this too i cherish..
i finally have a place to display my auto'ed gloves and si's.
he arrived with no limo, no fancy entourage.
i immediately felt a 'buzz' as i entered the room and made my way in his direction.
i was a professional boxer myself for 12 years,so to get to the level ali was at,and to stay a boxing god for as long as he did,is just incredible!!!
with my feet coming off the ground, i have no recollection of what he said in return, but he took the glove and marker from me, signed it "muhammad ali 5-28-94" and handed both back to me as i looked into his eyes and shook his hand again, saying "thank you very much".
i look upto ali as an inspiration to make the most of my life and to help others, whom have low self esteem, or issues that have impacted on their lives.
so my wife began explaining to ali’s assistant kim that i had written to him three years ago, and that he had called me in response to my letter.
i stared so hard that you came over to our table and did a magic trick with your thumb you pulled a piece of matrial from your thumb

ali nodded, gave me another hug and smiled.
almost instantly, ali stood up and gave laurie a huge heartfelt hug.
so needless to say my two daughters also fell in love with boxing.
my father told me many stories of joking, and laughing with muhammad ali at central high school.
so needless to say my two daughters also fell in love with boxing.
with my feet coming off the ground, i have no recollection of what he said in return, but he took the glove and marker from me, signed it "muhammad ali 5-28-94" and handed both back to me as i looked into his eyes and shook his hand again, saying "thank you very much".
i now teach various sports including boxing to underprivalidged young people, many whom have been involved in crime.
if they ever met you in person, they would see a kind, loving, giving individual who had the time for anyone.
but ali risked everything because of his belief that the war in vietnam was wrong and he was willing to stake that belief against fame and money.
many people take stands in their life but seldom have to give up everything because of those principles, especially if it involves forfeiting the greatest title in the world, world heavyweight champion.
that inspiration gave me the strength to put myself through college, working two and sometimes three jobs.
first i know ali from my brother, and the i search on youtube, and i just see the greatest is playing.
i sincerely hope that before one of us leaves this life that goal will be met.
i am now back home and although unable to get around without help, i now have my laptop and i'm helping many charities and good causes (the world food organisation is my favourite !)
i first met the champ in 76 in landover, md while he was training at the sheraton for match w/ jimmy young.

the second coming january 5, 2008 turks and caicos i train in lousiville where you trained i sat where your bike was stolen, i run up thestreet that carries our name.
well, despite the fact that my plan would violate that edict, i reached inside the bag and pulled out a magic marker and a cloth boxing glove that was my grandfather's from the 1930s and took another step closer.
and when the fighting was, many set against you since you were a muslim, and we all chechens (12) were rooting for you and at this point the dispute who will win and who i stood up and said that muhammad ali would win and then a my colleague, an ethnic russian (he was a boxer and champion of the baltic military district) stood up and said that he was a supporter of joe frazier, and that if you win, joe frazier, he will fight with me after hanging up.
just then, we heard an announcement that ali would not be signing autographs, but instead would be handing out brochures which he'd previously signed, entitled "women in islam".
we approached his limo but it had the windows up and once again secruity did their job and pushed us aside, as were we walking away
i was a student at the university of lagos and the night was electrifying and we were convinced ali has fulfilled a heroic mission in a continent where he is admired so much.
i watched the film and was so amazed about why he was so great, i started researching on him and he then lifted me up.
all through the afternoon, ali would pause and give that famous fighting glare and shake his fist at different people.
if they ever met you in person, they would see a kind, loving, giving individual who had the time for anyone.
and in my opinion, there is no other soul more special than ali.
some 4 years ago i had lost my way working too hard , losing my family and children, being very selfish...
also i continue to be sabotaged from employment and name slandered across the counties of orange, los angeles and inland empire.
he took special time with the elderly and especially young children.
first is muhammad ali of his parkinson's disease and my brother charles olajide idowu silva who died of colon cancer in nigeria on 9th april, 2010.
there is not an athlete today who will have the influence you had.
i turned and made my way through the crowd to where my grandmother was sitting.
j crossroads page: 03 estimated printed pages: 5 article text: after waiting a lifetime, finally meeting muhammad ali i had the third-best day of my life on the first of december this year.
he was ultra cool, dressed in all black and was very calm and patient as he asked his bodyguard to take a family picture, with him in the middle!
i turned and made my way through the crowd to where my grandmother was sitting.
i grew to admire his courage and was truly inspired by his conviction to his ideals.
i was a professional boxer myself for 12 years,so to get to the level ali was at,and to stay a boxing god for as long as he did,is just incredible!!!
to say it touched me would not give the moment justice.
i came to france with his family to survive the most (frequent pulmonary hemoptysis threatened my life) and that children could have a future, and we are here to defeat the contrary.
i'm somewhere in 2003 i think from baku turned to you, but to me then someone from your entourage said that you have difficulties with money, because you build a sports complex and since i am looking for sponsors for their dreams, but
i'm not sure if it was seeing mr. ali or seeing him with my dad that made it so special for me but whatever it was, that was one of the most special days of my 42 years of life.
no one could stop me from fulfilling my dreams if i believed in myself and always did what was right.
i was a shy kid, a tall strong kid who always got teased by the the others because i was abit taller than the others and fat.
i yelled for my father to stop the car its ali and before the car could stop, my brothers and i had the doors open and were running towards ali.
today's athlete needs to take a lesson from the greatest and realize that without the fans they are nothing.
brother, i'm not asking you for money (although it is very difficult and they need), i ask brother introduce me to a journalist who denounced my would appeal to the rulers of the muslims that i have listed above, so that they would help me in my request, and a dream , where i live for more than 33 years (dream of all my life - to collect means and to construct sports complex and on its base to open international training - sports, rehabilitation - healthy center "peace and mercy to children", where there could study free of charge and restore lost health and broken psychic condition - children, orphans, invalids, kids-victims of wars, ethnic conflicts and natural cataclysms) and the same free of charge raised and trained karate for children and young people, and most recently tried his hand at boxing and coaching in the home of his neighbor boy boxer suliman abdurashidova took him 3 months to win the french cup in 2011, as well as in the semifinal of france - 2011, where he is in equal fight on points lost in the final and joined the french team where the training camp he was seriously injured the right shoulder and the doctors said that i needed surgery, but despite this he had his first fight for the national team and with one hand have won this battle, and then consented to surgery.
but while boxing, i discovered the story of muhammad ali.
he was speaking at oswego state college and my father was huge fan of his and he toook me with him to hear him talk.
i can remember as a small boy my intense admiration for muhammad, however at that time such admiration was based on his exploits as an athlete.
we approached his limo but it had the windows up and once again secruity did their job and pushed us aside, as were we walking away i heard the window come down and someone called out to get the little girl!
ali proved that one individual can change destiny of millions and his humantarian efforsts are recognized as part of his desire to share his blessings and goodwill to all.
ali then became my role model, i bought the film, put posters of him in my room, made a movie about him for a school project.
during my time in hospital, 'soul of the butterfly' was my constant companion, reading and meditating daily over it's wonderful and spiritual words, this has helped my progress and courage beyond words...
i have always been great at spoken word now as a professional boxer i fight for world peace and for the love of my people true religion would not weperate us but be tolorate of all races and beliefs it is with t hat conviction that i step off the football field and into the ring to do one thing to make the world sing boom ba ya boom ba ya ali rumble young man rumble no howard
to end our very special day he was put into a convertable car to ride in the parade and we were standing in line watching him go by when i yelled to him your still pretty muhammad and he yelled back your pretty too, then he noticed my daughter by my side again!
and yet i the will of allah (st) sent him a knockout, and when he came to himself, i told him about the words that muhammad ali is my brother and i will tear him any.
so i went up to a teacher.
ali was training for the shavers fight,but when i shared the story and that children were involved i was given access to mahummad.
at the commencement, we were seated near the stage, just to the right of ali.
i was a shy kid, a tall strong kid who always got teased by the the others because i was abit taller than the others and fat.

his bodyguard seemed alarmed at this young white girl and her three brothers and as he grabbed my arm and my camera, ali looked at him and said "take your hands off of that child."
you are one of my biggest role model right next to my parents.
he was slighter in build than i expected, but he was very youthful looking for a man of 62.
although i had no family to attend my graduation ceremony i can honestly say i was the proudest graduate on stage that night.

i had the great pleasure of meeting "the greatest" a couple of times, one time very personal to me the other time creating some cherished memories i'll for the rest of my life.
i grew up following how ali turned sports into victory for the black race as they struggle for emancipation.
i was so disappointed when the photos were developed.
dear brother, i appeal to the many years of muslim rulers: saudi arabia, brunei, kuwait, united arab emirates, bahrain, qatar, oman, jordan, malaysia, but my letters to them, do not get - they just throw in their environment in the dustbin - although i'll forgive them for the sake of allah (st) to transfer my appeal recipients.
