a sweep would be less than a shock.
the santa ana winds–those fierce, drying winds that come mainly the northeast and mainly in fall and winter–blow less strongly here than most of the canyon areas of southern california, because the canyon we are in is one of the few in the area that drains from the southeast and then runs due west.
even under the cloud cover, we could see a thick column of smoke still rising from a fire in the distant northeast, near palomar mountain.
this is the view to the southeast (over the persimmons) to the southeast at about 7:40 this morning.1 that’s not fog.
conditions here: no wind whatsoever all night, and the last gust of more than a 1 or 2 mph was mid-afternoon and on-shore (s/sw).
however, the current indication is that most members of the liberal party will abstain, which would be good enough for harper to remain in office.
however, the premier cannot take office until he and the proposed cabinet obtain a vote of investiture (and, of course, once appointed, the cabinet depends on the ongoing confidence of the lower house).

the oceanside police department reports that the shelter at el camino high school is full and evacuees should to go to miracosta college at 1 barnard drive off of college avenue, north of highway 78 in oceanside.
if it did that, it could come up any of the several small canyons that have brush in them and that would channel winds, including the winds made by the fire itself.
i can see smoke to the northwest (from the fire in eastern fallbrook, the location of which is more or less due north.)
temp dropped only to 63 up the hill, but all the way to 55 down below.2 that temperature range shows the impact of slope, calmness, and dryness that normally (i.e. other than the freeze of january, 2007) means no freeze up above despite winter chill down below.
the winds are blowing out of the northeast, so the danger areas are south and southwest of us.

the al champion just demolished a very good cleveland team, which is certainly much superior to the rockies.
a system of proportional representation system offers several parties an opportunity to gain seats in the 200-seat house of representatives, while the 46-seat senate provides regional representation for each canton.

as more testament to how good the al east is, all the teams except baltimore actually underplayed their expectations, and baltimore was only 1 game better than expected.
at the start of play that day the rockies were 76-72, which was three games worse than their then-expected w-l, or the same deficit of reality from expectation that they would have at the end.
thanks to the many colleagues, friends, family and those i “know” only because you read this blog for your expressions of concern.
yet the red sox were a far better road team (45-36) during the season than were the rockies (a mere 39-42), and the latter team obviously must win at least one game in boston to have any hope in this series.
because fire naturally burns faster uphill than down, it would not even take significant winds for it to advance this way.
(by area, if not by population, by far most of bonsall is south of 76, but the only indications of “bonsall” on the thomas bros. maps –the standard map resource in these parts–are on the north side, so the error is easy to make.)
through such sharing of powers between separate institutions, two (or more) branches are induced to transact with one another, i.e., to exchange and cooperate to accomplish their respective functions.

we hadn’t really prepared for the “finca feline” who came with the property, stays outdoors other than during freeze or current smoke conditions, and would not even let us near her for almost four years before finally warming up to us and revealing what a nice cat she is after all.
there were some low-key celebrations of the event, but most of them were more about patting ourselves on the back that we have such a great constitution.
the most worrisome news up to this point was the burning of parts of thepala mesa resort, which is about 4.5 miles northeast of us.
avocado trees will burn, of course, but they burn rather slowly, because they have thick leathery leaves and healthy avo trees are full of water (as i am reminded every time the monthly water bill comes in).
the bad news is that the wind has died down.
the other day, while lying around wondering if we were going to be evacuated or not (can’t do any real work, nor sleep, in such circumstances)
it is certainly better to evacuate unnecessarily than to wait till it might be too late.
in 2005, the pis was the largest party with 27% of the vote and 155 of the 460 seats.
so, my guess is an election is not coming soon, as harper needs some high-profile defeat to get one, and the other parties like the current situation more than they like the idea of taking a chance on a conservative majority–or even a larger conservative minority (which might be the most likely outcome if an election were held this fall).
the president is elected by qualified plurality: 45% suffices for a first-round victory, as does a plurality of between 40% and 45%, as long as the runner-up trails by at least 10 percentage points.
closed-list plurality with limited nominations (i.e. two candidates nominated per party, with the plurality electing both and the second party electing its first-ranked candidate).
the ash and sooty grime are unbelievable for an area that did not have its own fire–far worse than in 2003.
major threats remain to populated areas farther south, even all the way to the coast.

there was notice there about evacuation for all of bonsall posted by their reporter who was moderating the discussion.
under poland’s constitution, the presidency is one of the most powerful in (non-xssr) europe–for instance it has a veto that needs 3/5 to override1 –but the president’s ability to appoint the cabinet is limited.
in that case, they need two wins in boston.

that is only a few miles north, but we are currently out of the wind-driven path of the smoke (and thus the fire).
of course, given how they had underachieved through 16 sept. and how the diamondbacks (who should have ended up 79-83) over-achieved all season, the rockies needed every one of those excess wins!
both teams have remarkably strong home-field advantages, based on home records during the regular season (51-30 for boston, 51-31 for colorado).
oh, sure, that series went the full seven and the red sox trailed, 3 games to 1, after the first four.
