and then henning turns up and he can instantly make everything happen so easily.
it didn’t quite work first time round, because all the water froze solid before the layers of soil could settle.
we found out about working horses and how they appeared really only quite briefly on the farming scene in between oxen (used for centuries to pull primarily wooden implements until iron and steel became cheap in the industrial revolution) and tractors (rapidly over taking everything since cheap oil and wartime engineering in the 1940s).
i took some photos during the week, so you can have a look if you haven’t seen them already.
i don’t really have to do any work, but i have spent a few hours planting out some trays of rocket, mizuna, corn salad, purslane and radish seedlings in the greenhouse and polytunnel.
it felt like the farm shop and cafe were at the heart of the enterprise, with everything else feeding in to the centre.
we learned about the special place of cows; their all-important digestive system, their dreamy nature, their horns, and lack of ego and their perfectly balanced manure.
i felt like i was useless, but that i’d like to be good at it.

in the classroom sessions (with my hot water bottle) we heard each others presentations on different farm animals, in varied styles and varied levels of skill and muddle.
he’s been muckspreading and rotavating and fixing electric fencing and harvesting potatoes and putting beetroot in clamps and making everyone turn up for work on time.
the cheese we were making will be a cheddar, so it won’t be ready for eating for at least three months.
i did say it was an epic week though.
duchy home farm is prince charles’ 1,900 acre project, managed by david for 25 years (and counting) as a model organic farm with dairy, beef, sheep, arable, 50 acres of vegetables and 1,000 apple trees.
after that i help anke put some of the cows in to other stalls.
one thing i really noticed was how clearly the personalities and characters of the owners or farmers shaped the nature and feeling of the farms.

on new year’s day we had a big brunch, and i did some tidying and cleaning and sorting in my room, and a big pile of washing, to start everything new and fresh.
most of the cows have got big horns on, and every time they shake their heads i can’t help feeling that they could do rather a lot of damage without even trying.
a few days ago i did a little experiment that i originally learned in primary school.
i brought the jars inside the next day and now they are all lined up on the kitchen table.
the timetable was pretty relaxed, and we did a lot of farm visits and farm walks.
but they have more confidence and personality and curiosity.
it all sounds fairly straight forward, and i pretty much know what i’m doing, but there is also quite a lot of scope for unwanted excitement.
anyway, i had a great weekend learning about cheese and cows and milk and yoghurt and everything else dairy-related.
so then it felt quite strange to be back here, alone in my own room, with all those people gone, and the talking and ideas already turning to ghosts.
drawing is a wonderful way to force you to really look at something properly.
that’s the reason why i didn’t write my blog yesterday evening; we got home at about 6:30pm, then had supper and did the washing up and unpacked and saw to the chicks and by then it was somehow 10pm.
it’s not just the railway stations and cycle panniers and hastily scribbled train timetable; racing down the platform as the train pulls in; squinting at the road signs through the rain; fidgeting in my seat scoffing apple buns made the night before; scanning the hills and hedges as they unfold beyond the train window.
eventually they set off at a surprisingly rapid pace and suddenly i was meant to be steering, in control, and wasn’t really and went too far in to the fodder beet, and just about managed to turn round back in to the field and then was already finished and i was shaking slightly.
i felt like i was useless, but that i’d like to be good at it.
they are self-sufficient in fodder and bedding for the animals, experimenting with working horses, and they like planting trees.
laura has very upright horns, gemma has curling round horns and is brown, marie pepper is fat and a dappled pink sort of colour, marie louise is white, but then so is luna.
again, so they have a bit more space to spread out.
ideally you mix it in to compost and then it’s more likely to be stabilised and in a form the plants can use.

in between we had some very informal presentations on different farm animals, looked at some pictures of digestive systems, and played around with some bones.

one thing i really noticed was how clearly the personalities and characters of the owners or farmers shaped the nature and feeling of the farms.
the first night was pretty chilly; we woke up with all the grass outside covered in crunchy frost.
i took some soil samples from various places around the vegetable fields and set up the experiment in the barn extension.
i now step inside their pen quite a lot; partly because it’s bigger than it was and i now have to climb in to reach the food, but also because they are big enough that i don’t have to be scared of standing on them by accident.

i took some soil samples from various places around the vegetable fields and set up the experiment in the barn extension.
i direct sowed three lines of spring onions in the polytunnel in a bit of an experiment.
i got so immersed in the place and a different rhythm, surrounded by other friendly apprentices, living so much more outside, in a world of thought and ideas and heady talking and farming visions.
it’s red powdery stuff that is about the same consistency as flour, and we were sprinkling it on the soil because the soil tests showed our phosphorus levels are low.
the soil settles out in to layers, so you can see the different proportions of sand, silt, clay and organic matter in your soil.
we watched kai come alive as he set off behind the horses, them listening intently, him calling and talking, guiding them easily through their work.
apart from learning about cows and pottering around in the garden, i have been baking bread (it makes so much sense with an aga in the kitchen, so i am teaching myself how to do sourdough), making and eating a vat of soup, helping finish off all the mince pies and stollen and vol au vents and such like, and (somewhat alarmingly) buying a new laptop (my old one has died quite conclusively this time i think – it won’t even switch on any more).
on friday i came home and felt a bit lost.

and then henning turns up and he can instantly make everything happen so easily.
they squawk and struggle when i pick them up but when i put them down they sit on my hand, try to roost on my knees and peck at my bootlaces, so they can’t be too badly traumatised.
in the classroom sessions (with my hot water bottle) we heard each others presentations on different farm animals, in varied styles and varied levels of skill and muddle.
it’s great that all that stuff has been happening, but it also makes me feel really frustrated and almost helpless.
a few days ago i did a little experiment that i originally learned in primary school.
they don’t milk by hand at plaw hatch but there was at least one cow that needed starting off by hand because otherwise she doesn’t let her milk down.
it was very interesting and i was quite surprised to find out that it involved being up to our elbows in a big vat of warm milk that, after several hours, became a vat of rubbery white curds.
somehow he really makes things happen.
we made cheese on saturday morning.
somehow he really makes things happen.
of course i already knew that, but it really hit me that it’s actually real and i am so happy to know that i’m going to be outside working on the land instead of plugged in to a computer.
the machine is meant to make it quick and easy and, i suppose, very regular because the seeds should fall out at a set rate as the wheel turns.
i don’t really have to do any work, but i have spent a few hours planting out some trays of rocket, mizuna, corn salad, purslane and radish seedlings in the greenhouse and polytunnel.
big and strong with huge shaggy hooves and massive muscles and round warm-air-blowing nostrils, and endless patient calm.
i was tremendously grateful to fee for suggesting that i take a hot water bottle.
it’s more about the journey in my brain; the experience of being away from the farm; learning about archetypes in bones, and about ruminant digestion, discussing the role of the cow in the farm organism, sketching sheep in the rain, exploring another farm and another farmer’s vision, seeing a place for working horses in a world post peak oil, rubbing smoke out of my eyes as i light the stove each evening that will keep us warm through the night.
each of the three of me, caspar and duncan are now taking it in turns to be the person to organise the work in the garden for a week.
and i’ll get sunburnt and it might rain all summer, and the plants will wilt and i’ll have to go to bed when it’s still daylight, but still, i think it will be better than being locked up in an office.
fortunately markus is very patient with us when we keep getting them all muddled up, and will helpfully explain, when we ask which one nerys is, that she’s got four legs and a welsh accent.

the chicory isn’t quite as big as it should be yet, but we wanted to make a start on it.

that’s the reason why i didn’t write my blog yesterday evening; we got home at about 6:30pm, then had supper and did the washing up and unpacked and saw to the chicks and by then it was somehow 10pm.
i loved both getting a feel for the animals i was drawing (that rounded muscly-ness of the horses, the paradoxical wooliness and sharp alertness of the sheep), and looking really carefully at, for example, exactly how the horns come out of a cows head, or how the hooves fit on to a horse.
this coming week we slowly start returning to the normal routine, as companions and co-workers and houseparents and employees come back from holidays over the next few days.
i also had the most wonderful thought in the spring-like weather last week; i was in the polytunnel and suddenly realised that this summer i won’t be sitting in an office.
then each of us had a go at driving the horses.
we have also been sowing the first of our tomatoes and aubergines (my aubergine calculation: we have 2.5 beds for aubergines in the polytunnel; each bed is 15m long, with space for two rows per bed; the aubergines are at 45cm spacing in the rows; we have two varieties of aubergine; we’re sowing them initially in seed trays so we can prick them out later; we sow them at about 50 seeds per tray; in the end we need 90 plants of each variety, so we sowed three seed trays of black beauty to be on the safe side, and we’ll do the other variety in a couple of weeks time.)
the first night was pretty chilly; we woke up with all the grass outside covered in crunchy frost.
i’m enjoying helping on the farm and it’s good to get a feel for how it works.
we had compost toilets, and a woodfired shower that no one used all week, and a big kitchen which was essentially a tent with a concrete floor, a big old wood fired oven in the middle, and some plumbed in sinks round the edges.
i brought the jars inside the next day and now they are all lined up on the kitchen table.
it’s red powdery stuff that is about the same consistency as flour, and we were sprinkling it on the soil because the soil tests showed our phosphorus levels are low.
rolls of fleece and boxes of seeds and new buckets and bamboo poles and thermometers have all been appearing in the barn extension.
i was very pleasantly surprised to discover that i can still do hand milking, which i learned at monkton wyld when i was 18.
it felt like the farm shop and cafe were at the heart of the enterprise, with everything else feeding in to the centre.
going on a block course, i should know by now, is something of an epic journey.
anyway, i had a great weekend learning about cheese and cows and milk and yoghurt and everything else dairy-related.
for new year i didn’t manage to stay up late but mellanie and johanna kindly woke me up at midnight so i could drink a mug of orange juice with them in a befuddled state without even leaving my bed and then fall straight back asleep.
we’ve been doing a lot of sowing and planting in the past week, which is partly because of the time of year and partly because there were several leaf days, which means it’s a good day to sow and plant all the leafy crops like cabbage (two varieties – derby day and chateaurenard), mizuna, rocket, corn salad, purslane, spring onions and such like.
we looked at the different implements for the horses (so much more interesting and meaningful than they could possibly have been a year ago), and talked about the benefits of working with horses over tractors (less compaction, wider window to get on the land, less aggressive machines, less pollution, and so on).
my jacket smells of cows, i have straw stuck in all my clothes, and baler twine sprouting out of my pockets.
eventually they set off at a surprisingly rapid pace and suddenly i was meant to be steering, in control, and wasn’t really and went too far in to the fodder beet, and just about managed to turn round back in to the field and then was already finished and i was shaking slightly.
i’m going to try to write a short blog this week because as i’m starting it’s already 8:20pm on monday evening, which means it’s about an hour until my bedtime and in that time i’ve still got to hang up my washing and check on the chicks and make a plan for tomorrow, as well as writing this blog.
in the morning all the cows come in to the yard, and some of them are milked and some of them have calves that they feed.
fortunately markus is very patient with us when we keep getting them all muddled up, and will helpfully explain, when we ask which one nerys is, that she’s got four legs and a welsh accent.
so i went to have a look round the long crichel garden instead, and enjoyed the bike ride and ate a flapjack from the bakery there.
i now step inside their pen quite a lot; partly because it’s bigger than it was and i now have to climb in to reach the food, but also because they are big enough that i don’t have to be scared of standing on them by accident.
we also met the cows and calves, helped out with the milking, drew pictures of cows, did some cheese tasting, learned about how to make yoghurt and butter and keffir, and ate lots of delicious food.
on new year’s day we had a big brunch, and i did some tidying and cleaning and sorting in my room, and a big pile of washing, to start everything new and fresh.
but they have more confidence and personality and curiosity.
we spent an afternoon doing bone puzzles; piecing together vertebrae, observing patterns, looking at skulls, playing with clay, and thinking about the archetypal threefold viking realms of asgard, midgard and nifelheim.
but it’s okay to just sprinkle it on the soil and rake it in as well, apparently.
i missed comfy chairs and the aga when i was there, but then coming back i missed air and space and the immediacy of nature.
so then it felt quite strange to be back here, alone in my own room, with all those people gone, and the talking and ideas already turning to ghosts.

i think it is quite a good idea for us all to take turns and understand everything better, but i like it best when duncan’s in charge like normal.
it was great to see the garden operating as part of the farm.
duchy home farm is prince charles’ 1,900 acre project, managed by david for 25 years (and counting) as a model organic farm with dairy, beef, sheep, arable, 50 acres of vegetables and 1,000 apple trees.
we walked up the hill to gables farm with our pencils and sketchpads, and drew pictures of the sheep, cows, turkeys, horses and pigs we found there.
then i have been doing piles of washing and eating pumpkin pie, and sorted out my photos from the week (have a look at them), and had my first ever official supervision session with claudia, and started typing up my notes from the course and swept and mopped the corridor.
nearly every one is still away on holiday, and there’s no harvesting to do because there’s no one much here to eat anything.
it felt calm, purposeful, spacious, thriving, visionary and yet deeply rooted, and had a certain magic for me.
i missed comfy chairs and the aga when i was there, but then coming back i missed air and space and the immediacy of nature.
the chicory isn’t quite as big as it should be yet, but we wanted to make a start on it.
you dig up a little bit of soil, put it in a jam jar, add water, shake it up (with a lid on) and then leave it for a few hours.
we have six of them in four pens, and i have to let the mother cows in to the pens with their calves, feed the mothers with grain, ‘bed up’ the pens with extra straw, top up the water and hay as necessary, and then get the mother cows out of the pens when the calves have finished feeding.
we learned about the special place of cows; their all-important digestive system, their dreamy nature, their horns, and lack of ego and their perfectly balanced manure.
i not only took that hot water bottle to bed with me every night, but also had it stuffed up my jumper during most of the classroom sessions, on my lap as i ate breakfast and supper, and at my feet when my toes got too cold.
rolls of fleece and boxes of seeds and new buckets and bamboo poles and thermometers have all been appearing in the barn extension.

but then by the end of the week i realised i’d really learned a lot, and came away with a significantly expanded understanding of farms and animals and perhaps even of human evolution and social history and what it means to be alive.
wharf farm is judy and bert and their goats and ducks and dogs and chickens on a 10 acre smallholding.
i did say it was an epic week though.
for new year i didn’t manage to stay up late but mellanie and johanna kindly woke me up at midnight so i could drink a mug of orange juice with them in a befuddled state without even leaving my bed and then fall straight back asleep.
on henning’s recommendation i’ve covered them with fleece (even though they are inside) to protect them from the cold.

we have had lots of deliveries in the past week, which has added to the feeling that things are happening and spring is on the way.
it could have been terrible, but actually i felt really grateful for the opportunity to live outside for a few days; to be that much closer to nature, and weather, and light and dark.
we brushed them clean and learned how to throw a whole pile of heavy leather straps and buckles over their backs and then sort it out in to harness.
we also met the cows and calves, helped out with the milking, drew pictures of cows, did some cheese tasting, learned about how to make yoghurt and butter and keffir, and ate lots of delicious food.
i like the cows even though they are a bit scary, and i am slowly learning how to deal with them.

this week i’m kind of in charge of the garden.
we looked at the different implements for the horses (so much more interesting and meaningful than they could possibly have been a year ago), and talked about the benefits of working with horses over tractors (less compaction, wider window to get on the land, less aggressive machines, less pollution, and so on).
i was also really interested to see how each farm came together as a farm organism – how the number of sheep has to balance the number of cows, how the number of cows dictates the amount of silage you need to produce and store, how the dairy herd interacts with the beef herd, the connection between pigs and waste veg and whey from gardens and cheese making, and so on.
overall, it felt cared for though somewhat haphazard and chaotic, happily non-commercial, enthusiastic and passionate and very organic.
nearly every one is still away on holiday, and there’s no harvesting to do because there’s no one much here to eat anything.
it all sounds fairly straight forward, and i pretty much know what i’m doing, but there is also quite a lot of scope for unwanted excitement.
after that i help anke put some of the cows in to other stalls.
i can see some fairly subtle differences between the different areas of the garden, but basically we have got lots of sand and silt and it’s all a grey-yellow-brown colour.
i stood still there behind them, reins in my hands, called out ‘holdfast’ as instructed, and screwed up my nose as i failed to make any impression on them whatsoever.
they are much more bird-like now; before they were yellow and fluffy, and now they are beak and feathers and beady eyes.
it was busy and driven, big but well integrated, and good quality.
each of the three of me, caspar and duncan are now taking it in turns to be the person to organise the work in the garden for a week.

on wednesday we spent an afternoon with kai’s working horses at gables farm.
in between all that we drank tea and ate biscuits and toast in extended tea breaks, walked up and down the steps through the steep woodland and along the sparkling valley to the mill, ate good lunches in the ruskin mill cafe, and shared our apprenticeship stories and plans and hopes and frustrations.
it felt calm, purposeful, spacious, thriving, visionary and yet deeply rooted, and had a certain magic for me.
i think it is quite a good idea for us all to take turns and understand everything better, but i like it best when duncan’s in charge like normal.
it was great to see the garden operating as part of the farm.
in contrast the soil from the greenhouse is black and much more full of humus.
at abbey home farm they have, on 1,700 acres, just about everything you can think of: dairy, beef, sheep, chickens for table birds and chickens for eggs, vegetables, arable, cheese making, farm shop, cafe, fire wood and even a couple of soil association apprentices.
just in the last few days they have started getting balls of poo stuck on their toes, so i’ve spent a while sitting in with them and picking balls off their toes.

on wednesday we spent an afternoon with kai’s working horses at gables farm.
in the morning it is quite dark still at six o’clock and the yard is icy and slippery, and i have to carry buckets of water and grain and bales of straw through a herd of curious cows, so you can imagine that it’s not quite so straight forward as it sounds at first… me and anke have cow identifcation lessons every morning and afternoon, as we have to put the right cows in the right pens in the right order.
i think i need to put in clean straw more often to keep them cleaner, and i’ve also just today extended their house again, so they have a bit more space to spread out.
our apprentice weekend at plaw hatch was really good.
after fire lighting and porridge eating, and shivering strip washing in a bowl of warm water, each morning started with drawing.
we watched kai come alive as he set off behind the horses, them listening intently, him calling and talking, guiding them easily through their work.
my special job is looking after the little calves.

on first sight it could have been a junk yard, but it turned out to be a diverse and integrated smallholding where nothing gets wasted, the animals are well cared for, judy makes cheese, and the people are part of the land.

we walked up the hill to gables farm with our pencils and sketchpads, and drew pictures of the sheep, cows, turkeys, horses and pigs we found there.
on the same bed we sprinkled rock phosphate, which was a new experience for me.

we all slept in a big old tent, a bit like sardines.
okay, it might also be horribly hot and i’ll get sunburnt and it might rain all summer, and the plants will wilt and i’ll have to go to bed when it’s still daylight, but still, i think it will be better than being locked up in an office.

they squawk and struggle when i pick them up but when i put them down they sit on my hand, try to roost on my knees and peck at my bootlaces, so they can’t be too badly traumatised.
in between all that we drank tea and ate biscuits and toast in extended tea breaks, walked up and down the steps through the steep woodland and along the sparkling valley to the mill, ate good lunches in the ruskin mill cafe, and shared our apprenticeship stories and plans and hopes and frustrations.
the timetable was pretty relaxed, and we did a lot of farm visits and farm walks.
at abbey home farm they have, on 1,700 acres, just about everything you can think of: dairy, beef, sheep, chickens for table birds and chickens for eggs, vegetables, arable, cheese making, farm shop, cafe, fire wood and even a couple of soil association apprentices.
i got so immersed in the place and a different rhythm, surrounded by other friendly apprentices, living so much more outside, in a world of thought and ideas and heady talking and farming visions.
in between we had some very informal presentations on different farm animals, looked at some pictures of digestive systems, and played around with some bones.
it was busy and driven, big but well integrated, and good quality.
but after that the weather changed and it was warmer but damper.
after fire lighting and porridge eating, and shivering strip washing in a bowl of warm water, each morning started with drawing.
we found out about working horses and how they appeared really only quite briefly on the farming scene in between oxen (used for centuries to pull primarily wooden implements until iron and steel became cheap in the industrial revolution) and tractors (rapidly over taking everything since cheap oil and wartime engineering in the 1940s).
but after that the weather changed and it was warmer but damper.
