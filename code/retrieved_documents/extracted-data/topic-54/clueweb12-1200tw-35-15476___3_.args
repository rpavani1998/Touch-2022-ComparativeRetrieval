after weeks of warm weather, fruit trees are blooming about three to four weeks early and are more susceptible to damage when temperatures dip below freezing.apricot and peach trees in area orchards are in full bloom, along with a variety of other fruit crops, and local farmers are hoping recent low temperatures won t cause damage to the vulnerable fruit.local fruit farmers are hoping for a bit more normalcy than march has shown so far, and that the predicted colder weather will "put the brakes on things," as hollabaugh said, without causing too much damage.it's still early to tell what, if any, damage there was, though some farmers believed there could be damage to fruits like plums, apricots, peaches, sweet cherries and nectarines, which are further along in the growth process and are more susceptible to damage.local farmers say the budding trees and flowers popping up gave an early indication that fruit trees would also bloom early this year.so if apples that typically mature in september and october are a month ahead in the growing cycle, they might not get the cold nights they need for good color.the further the temperature dips below freezing, the higher percentage of buds killed."when the blooms open up and the petals open up and are out there in the open, that's the most susceptible time," said ed mcdannell, who along with his wife operates mcdannell's fruit farm and market in biglerville.cold temperatures bring questions at local fruit farms adams orchard owners worry about damage to trees already in bloom.for example, baugher said farmers of most apple varieties could expect a 10 percent kill at 28 degrees and a 90 percent kill at 24 degrees.local farmers said they would continue to check on forecasts and temperatures.it's not the time for sweet cherries, peaches, apples and nectarines to be in bloom." but growth and bloom started about three to four weeks early at most local fruit farms when march came in like a lamb and when the warm days turned into warm weeks.most of the nights this week are expected to stay above freezing in temperature.by heather faulhefer the evening suneveningsun.com posted: Â  03/27/2012 05:42:33 pm edt fernando rodriguez, a worker at the peters orchards, trims early blooming peach trees on monday afternoon at the orchard outside of york springs.
