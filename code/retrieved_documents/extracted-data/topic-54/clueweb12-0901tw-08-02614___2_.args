in general, the apples that get morning sun until noon seem to fruit prolifically, whereas the apples that get no morning sun, but afternoon sun seem to fruit a lot less, much more biennially.the more the noon sun is blocked, the leggier and less productive the trees are.i did notice that apples closer to the oaks that provide western shade delay the harvest by about 3-4 weeks.(most winter apples can tolerate short exposures to 20f, the types of frosts that might be common in the fall.)the sun angle is getting higher and higher now, clearing the trees more and more so it may not have as much of an effect as i'm thinking.my property is surrounded by oak trees, and i've pushed the envelope by growing fruit trees right up to the canopy.cox's orange pippin grows at an orchard close to here (40 min away), and they're ripe early/mid september as well.let's get some facts straight first, my garden is in central california, not southern california, we get a lot of fog in the hills right above santa cruz, for example my cox orange pippin will get foggy mornings with sun from maybe noon-4pm, after which it's shaded from the oaks.so in ny you would probably just want to make sure your apples ripen before the onset of extended periods of sub-freezing weather.as a whole, i've noticed much more open growth near the oak trees.if anything, your apples may even be better quality with the extra chill in the late fall from the extra shade you will get after sept. 21st.eric, you shouldn't have to worry about what apples you can grow based on the amount of shade your apples are getting.the trees that have that much delay are right next to the oaks, almost under them, so that they get shaded after about 1pm.you will only be limited by the length of your season, which means you should try to grow apples that do well in ny.what's interesting is that for example stone fruits like peaches are much less sensitive, fruiting like crazy in the same locations.
