wet leaves are more vulnerable to anthracnose infection, so a sunny location with good air circulation is best.unlike the more commonly-planted white birch, river birch is seldom troubled by insect pests, and it tolerates summer heat well.while flowering dogwood is susceptible to anthracnose and borers, proper growing conditions minimize the risk.oaks in general are excellent trees for wildlife -- they attract not just squirrels, but also foxes, deer, porcupines, rabbits, and many species of birds.the shiny red fruit is also attractive, and it provides important winter food for wildlife.hophornbeam is an excellent choice for a dry woodland; once established, it is highly drought-tolerant.redbud makes an effective companion for flowering dogwood, as it blooms at the same time and enjoys the same growing conditions.these traits make it an excellent choice for preventing erosion on steep banks.it tolerates heat, drought, pollution, and very infertile soil -- virtually anything except soggy soil.consistently moist soil is important, especially for trees growing in full sun.sour gum grows fastest if it has fertile, slightly acidic, moist soil, but it will grow in anything except alkaline or extremely dry soil.it withstands soggy soil or extreme drought, clay or sandy soil, urban pollution, and strong wind.the gray, waxy berries (used in bayberry candles) are attractive in winter, and they provide food for birds.in the landscape, it does well in sunny locations, where it will tolerate poor soil, dry soil, and strong winds.this distinctive form makes the pagoda dogwood a good specimen tree; it can also add variety to mixed plantings or woods.
