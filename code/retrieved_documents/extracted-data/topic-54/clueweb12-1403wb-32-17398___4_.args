painting at low temperatures cause trouble too, making brushing and rolling more difficult, retarding drying, and leaving wet paint susceptible to airborne dirt, insects and pollen.a good paint job should last at least 10 to 15 years, but it's longevity really depends on the location of the house and how well it is protected from sun, wind, and rain.paint sprayers provide coverage four to five times faster than brushes, but the finish tends to be uneven, and even with the airless version half the paint drifts away.oil-based paint is favored for trim work because of its attractive sheen.in the end, all of your brushwork will keep your house beautiful and safe.there is no substitute for brushwork on the trim; it gives you greater control in these small, often intricate areas.the bristle depends on the paint: natural bristle (hog's hair is best) may absorb water from latex paints, ruining the brush, so they should be used only for oil.although summer, with its endless sunny days and warm weather, might seem like the perfect time for house painting, don't even think about climbing the ladder when the temperature is greater than 90Â°f.if blistering on the wood surface does occur, allow the paint to dry for a few days, scrape off the blisters, smooth the edges with sandpaper and repaint.when you find the perfect day, the best game plan is to "follow the sun around the house."most paint jobs can be handled with a three-inch straight-edge siding brush, a two-inch angled sash brush, and a two-and-a-half-inch straight-edge trim brush.leave at least two hours for the fresh paint to dry before weather conditions cool to the point where dew forms.if you are using oil paint, work it into the wood; latex will level itself out.nylon and polyester brushes do not release oil paint uniformly, so these should be used only for latex.to determine how much you'll need overall, measure the space to be painted and calculate the area in square feet.
