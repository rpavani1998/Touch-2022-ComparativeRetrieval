during the period from around october to february, the earth’s orbital speed is much faster than at any other time of year.
in the other half of the year, as the orbital speed of the earth is slower, similar effects can be observed as well.
this increased speed causes the sun to reach its noon position in the sky earlier in january and later in november than the time caused by the earth’s tilt alone.
the diagram here shows in lighter colors the sun positions due to the tilt alone.
the tilt of the earth is the main cause of these temperature changes.
putting it all together the combined effects of the tilt and the orbit shape produce the analemma which in turn, helps us to understand why the earliest sunset is in early december and the latest sunrise is in early january.
many people are surprised to learn that the change in distance from the sun is not enough to affect the temperature very much.
this means that at 12:00 in other months the sun will not have yet reached the same noon position in the sky as the june or december sun.
the diagram here shows in lighter colors the sun positions due to the tilt alone.
this would be true if the earth had no tilt and if its orbit were a perfect circle.
this shift creates the surprising situation mentioned above.
the early morning northern hemisphere analemma (created by observing the position of the sun at the same time early each morning) is tilted to the left, while the late afternoon analemma is tilted to the right.
the positions shown in darker colors take into account the effects of both the tilt and the changing speed due to the shape of the orbit.
the tilt of the earth is the main cause of these temperature changes.
the height of the analemma is due to the tilt of the earth, and its width is due to both the tilt and the elliptical nature of earth’s orbit.
at a latitude of about 40° north of the equator (near the mediterranean sea, the central part of the united states, or the yellow sea, for example), sunrise would be about 7:40 a.m., with sunset at about 4:55 p.m. (16:55 military time).this gives a total daylight time of 9 hours and 15 minutes for this latitude.
in the other half of the year, as the orbital speed of the earth is slower, similar effects can be observed as well.
the day with the latest sunrise, around 7:43 a.m., is january 4, and the earliest sunset takes place on december 7 at around 4:52 p.m. (16:52 military time).
instead of a camera, you can use either reflected light or ordinary shadows.

if you live in a region that does not a lot of snow or rain during the year, you may wish to work outdoors instead.
in the actual sky, the horizontal distances are not this great; however, they are easily noticeable.
in the how long is the day activity, we focused on how the length of the daylight hours is different for different places on earth.
you might think that this short day would be caused by the latest sunrise and the earliest sunset; however, that is not the case!
this would be true if the earth had no tilt and if its orbit were a perfect circle.
for example, between december and march and between june and september in the northern hemisphere, the sun reaches the noon position in the sky a few minutesbefore local noon.
we also looked at how the times of sunrise and sunset change throughout the year.
this shift creates the surprising situation mentioned above.
you might think that the sun would appear at the same place in the sky at the same time each day.
the combined effects of the tilt and the orbit shape produce the analemma which in turn, helps us to understand why the earliest sunset is in early december and the latest sunrise is in early january.
if he had taken the photographs at an earlier time in the day, the analemma would have been tilted to the left.
the tilt of the earth causes the sun to reach its noon position (its highest position in the sky on a given day) a little before or a little after 12:00 noon local time on all but a few days of the year.
the tilt of the earth changes how high the sun appears to be in the sky throughout the year, as seen from a specific place on the surface of the earth.

if he had taken the photographs at an earlier time in the day, the analemma would have been tilted to the left.
the other is the fact that the earth’s orbit around the sun is not quite circular.
at a latitude of about 40° north of the equator (near the mediterranean sea, the central part of the united states, or the yellow sea, for example), sunrise would be about 7:40 a.m., with sunset at about 4:55 p.m. (16:55 military time).this gives a total daylight time of 9 hours and 15 minutes for this latitude.
first, let’s look at the path of the sun across the sky on a typical day.
the positions shown in darker colors take into account the effects of both the tilt and the changing speed due to the shape of the orbit.
during the period from around october to february, the earth’s orbital speed is much faster than at any other time of year.
the orbit of the earth is nearly circular, but it is elliptical (oval) just enough to cause the orbital speed of the earth to change throughout the year.
if you live in the northern hemisphere, you might be curious about why outside temperatures are colder in december and january when the earth is closest to the sun.
