hydrangeas are not drought tolerant plants, needing ample moisture to thrive.some gardeners like the look of the dried blooms on their plants, and even consider it an extra form of winter protection for their flower buds.some will tolerate more sun than others, and pruning needs vary by species.hydrangea paniculata (panicle hydrangea) and h. arborescens (smooth hydrangea) require a totally different method of pruning and are both much more forgiving if pruning is not done at a certain time.full morning sun or filtered sun with protection from the hot afternoon sun is best for most; however, the h. paniculata pink diamond can grow in full sun.oakleaf hydrangeas tend to stay dormant longer and rarely have any winter injury.the smooth hydrangea will produce much larger blooms if pruned hard each year, but many gardeners opt for smaller blooms on sturdier stems.full morning sun or filtered sun with protection from the hot afternoon sun is best for most; however, the h. paniculata ‘pink diamond’ can grow in full sun.pruning crossover branches and pruning for structure and support by cutting stems to a heading of 18 – 24 inches can give you a sturdier branch to support the blooms, but even then you may need some additional plant supports to keep the branches upright.hydrangea macrophylla and h. quercifolia bloom on the old growth, so should be pruned immediately after flowering if needed.they produce large showy pink or blue flowers are gracing many landscapes.acidic soils produce blue flowers, while alkaline soils produce pink.this should reduce the overall size and height of the plant, while leaving ample remaining stems for showy blooms the next season.smooth and panicle hydrangeas are usually immune to winter damage, and even if it occurs, since they bloom on the new growth, they still will bloom this growing season.some plants bloom on the new growth—hydrangea paniculata and h. arborescens, so can be pruned before growth begins in early spring or as they are going dormant in the fall.
