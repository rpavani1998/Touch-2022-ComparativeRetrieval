the tilt of the earth also has an effect on the sun’s horizontal position during the year as seen at the same time each day.at a latitude of about 40° north of the equator (near the mediterranean sea, the central part of the united states, or the yellow sea, for example), sunrise would be about 7:40 a.m., with sunset at about 4:55 p.m. (16:55 military time).this gives a total daylight time of 9 hours and 15 minutes for this latitude.at a latitude of about 40° north of the equator (near the mediterranean sea, the central part of the united states, or the yellow sea, for example), sunrise would be about 7:40 a.m., with sunset at about 4:55 p.m. (16:55 military time).this gives a total daylight time of 9 hours and 15 minutes for this latitude.the tilt of the earth changes how high the sun appears to be in the sky throughout the year, as seen from a specific place on the surface of the earth.the tilt of the earth causes the sun to reach its noon position (its highest position in the sky on a given day) a little before or a little after 12:00 noon local time on all but a few days of the year.this means that at 12:00 in other months the sun will not have yet reached the same noon position in the sky as the june or december sun.this changing speed affects the position of the sun in the sky.since this is a yearlong project, you may find it easier to work indoors, depending on your climate.for example, between december and march and between june and september in the northern hemisphere, the sun reaches the noon position in the sky a few minutesbefore local noon.the tilt of the earth is the main cause of these temperature changes.this increased speed causes the sun to reach its noon position in the sky earlier in january and later in november than the time caused by the earth’s tilt alone.many people are surprised to learn that the change in distance from the sun is not enough to affect the temperature very much.the orbit of the earth is nearly circular, but it is elliptical (oval) just enough to cause the orbital speed of the earth to change throughout the year.if you live in the northern hemisphere, you might be curious about why outside temperatures are colder in december and january when the earth is closest to the sun.the combined effects of the tilt and the orbit shape produce the analemma which in turn, helps us to understand why the earliest sunset is in early december and the latest sunrise is in early january.
