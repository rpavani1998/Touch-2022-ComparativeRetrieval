these measures also permit tender cultivars to become established in borderline locations; established trees are much hardier than young ones.sun blotch is a viral disease that causes yellowed streaking of young stems, mottling and crinkling of new leaves and occasional deformation of the fruit.branches exposed to sun by defoliation are extraordinarily susceptible to sunburn and will surely die.older trees benefit from feeding with nitrogenous fertilizer applied in late winter and early summer.six-spotted mite is very harmful; even a small population can cause massive leaf shedding.they will not survive in locations with poor drainage.the disease is rampant near the coast and has no economical control.the upper branches can also be top worked with hardy mexican types, which will protect a more tender cultivar on lower branches, as well as serving as a pollinator.the avocado is not suitable for hedgerow, but two or three trees can be planted in a single large hole to save garden space and enhance pollination.mature trees often also show a zinc deficiency.wind-caused abrasion can scar the skin, forming cracks which extend into the flesh.the roots are highly competitive and will choke out nearby plants.they are hardy 24 - 19° f. avocados need some protection from high winds which may break the branches.they are hardy 24 - 19° f. avocados need some protection from high winds which may break the branches.seeds may sprout within an avocado when it is over-mature, causing internal molds and breakdown.
