as such, seedlings grown from such seeds will normally exhibit moderate to severe leaf tip burn and marginal necrosis from salt injury.the tree will not perform well in poorly drained soils, nor will it tolerate flooding.thus, trees killed to the ground by severe cold will regenerate from varietal wood rather than from rootstock.anthracnose is particularly severe on thin-skinned types, but rarely causes significant losses on 'lula' and other thick-skinned fruits.some types are killed outright by moderate freezes and others have regenerated after sustaining complete death of all aboveground parts in severe freezes.in important avocado-producing areas, orchards are interplanted with varieties of both types to assure good pollination.mature trees can produce two to three or more bushels of avocados with good management, depending upon variety.seeds from 'lula' are the preferred rootstock for all avocados in south texas, as it is fairly tolerant to existing soil salinity.soil and site selection avocado trees are adapted to most soil types found in south texas, provided the soil has good internal drainage.when backfilling is completed, plus the extra soil above the plant's prior soil line, the outer root system is in contact with the soil in which it must grow, so the plant is more likely to survive transplanting and begin to grow.other fungal diseases such as cercospora spot, powdery mildew and scab are rarely encountered in texas, but are serious problems in the humid tropics.the most serious disease of avocados is anthracnose, which is primarily a disease of fruit nearing maturity.problems, disease and insect pests the most common problem of avocados in texas is tip burn and marginal necrosis caused by water stress and salinity, which is most prevalent during hot, dry weather.west indian types are the least cold tolerant and somewhat watery in flavor, but they have the greatest tolerance to salinity and some diseases.cold protection deep planting and subsequent soil mounding around the trunk are the best assurances that the avocado will survive a severe freeze, even if the top is completely killed.
