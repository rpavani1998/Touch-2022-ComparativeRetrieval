but considering the danger to arise from substituting external adornment for internal worth, and imaging that distinction in dress confers an advantage on its wearer, or entitles him to that which he would not otherwise assume—the missionaries were led to conclude, that a tahitian, arrayed in a scarlet and yellowtiputa , or invested in the rich fold of his ahu puu, was perhaps as humble in mind as those who appeared desirous to divest themselves of every exterior ornament.

it is difficult to suppose that, when this latter assertion was made, it simply meant, that, in connexion with other great doctrines of revelation, the missionaries taught that, in opposition to the “lords many, and the gods many,” the gods of wood, and stone, and feathers, the works of their own hands which the heathen worshipped, there was one living and true god.

the erection of their dwelling, culture of their garden, building the house for hidden prayer, &c.

when the heated iron was hammered on the anvil, and the sparks flew among them, they fancied it was spitting at them, and were frightened, as they also were with the hissing occasioned by immersing it in water; yet they were delighted to see the facility with which a bar of iron was thus converted into hatchets, adzes, fish-spears, and fish-hooks, &c. pomare, entering one day when the blacksmith was employed, after gazing a few minutes at the work, was so transported at what he saw, that he caught up the smith in his arms, and, unmindful of the dirt and perspiration inseparable from his occupation, most cordially embraced him, and saluted him, according to the custom of his country, by touching noses.

we have always been accustomed to have our usual beverage prepared in the morning and afternoon; but this is the only purpose for which, in ordinary seasons, a fire has ever been lighted for any of the missionary families; and when destitute of these articles, which in the earlier periods of the mission was often the case, no fire was lighted on the sabbath; their food was invariably dressed on the preceding day, and the warmth of the climate prevented their requiring fire for any other purpose.

before this time, a musket, ball, aimed at a native who had taken shelter in his house, was fired through the window of the room in which he was sitting; and during another war, the spear of one of the king's enemies was already poised, and would in all probability have inflicted a fatal wound in his body, had not the interference of one of mr. nott's friends, at the moment, saved him from the deadly thrust.
at the close of the evening service mr. davies gave notice, according to previous arrangements, that on the following morning a public meeting would be held; when all who had sincerely renounced their false gods, who had desired also to relinquish their evil customs, to receive jehovah for their god, and to be instructed in his word, were invited to 106 attend.
the knowledge of the spiritual nature of christianity, possessed by many of the new converts, was doubtless but imperfect, their acquaintance with the will of god but partial, and probably on many points of first erroneous, but still there was a warmth of feeling, and undisguised sincerity, and an ardour of desire, (in scripture called “the first-love,”) that has never been exceeded.
the coral rock is also more durable than the plaster; and although soft, and easily hewn when first taken out of the sea, it afterwards assumes a degree of hardness which resists the weather for a long series of years.

i could not but think how awful would my state have been, had i in that hour been ignorant of christ, or had i neglected and despised the offers of his mercy; and while this reflection induced thankfulness to him through whom alone we had been made to share a hope of immortality, it awakened a tender sympathy for our fellow-voyagers, who sat in mournful silence at the helm or in the bottom of the boat, and seemed averse to conversation.
during this transition, while the horse was suspended midway between the gangway and the yard-arm, some of the bandages gave way; when the animal, after hanging some time by the neck and fore-legs, to the great terror both of pomare and the captain, slipped through the slings, and, clearing the ship's side, fell into the sea.

no sabbath had then dawned no happy multitudes met for praise and prayer, no lovely throngs of children gathered in the– 417 – sabbath-schools, no inspired page or christian preacher directed their attention to the lord of the sabbath; but when the devotees met for public worship, it was under the gloom of overshadowing trees, amid the recesses of some rude temple, before some rustic altar, or in the presence of some deity of frightful form and fearful attributes, the offspring of their own imagination.
thus was idolatry abolished in tahiti and eimeo; the idols hurled from the thrones they had for ages occupied; and the remnant of the people liberated from the slavery and delusion in which, by the cunningly devised fables of the priests, and the “doctrines of devils,” they had been for ages – 157 – held as in fetters of iron.

to the favour of the gods he considered himself indebted for the aggrandisement of his person and family; and if the missionaries would have allowed the claims of oro or tane to have received an equal degree of attention to that which they required for jehovah, or jesus christ, pomare would readily have admitted them; but when required to renounce his dependence upon the idols of his ancestors, and to acknowledge jehovah alone as the true god, he at once rejected their message.

sometimes they wanted to know what was the colour of adam and eve's skin, or what language they spoke: with regard to the former, their opinions were in accordance with those of the late bishop heber; they said it was very likely they were brown or olive-coloured, and, as their descendants, or the descendants of noah, travelled to hotter climates, they became darker; while those, whose information had removed the belief that our colour was the effect of disease, acknowledged the plausibility of our ancestors having become white from the influence of cold, and a clouded atmosphere, whereby they were shaded from the sun.

mr. gyles was engaged for four years, during which time it was supposed he would be able, not only to commence 283 his operations, but to proceed so as to convince the kind and chiefs what might be done, and also to improve the natives in the art of cultivating cane, instruct them in the process of boiling, &c. and leave them capable of carrying it on by themselves.

a settlement thus formed could never possess any approximation to uniformity; yet it frequently seemed to us as if the variety in size and shape among the buildings, and the irregularity of their situation, were in perfect keeping with the wild, untrained luxuriant loveliness, and romantic appearance, of the rocks, the hills, the mountains, the valleys, and every other natural object by which the rising settlement was surrounded.

the chief appeared in a most affecting state, dreadfully scorched with the powder; mr. broomhall employed such applications as he supposed likely to alleviate his sufferings; these, however, increased, and both the chief and his wife attributed his pains, not to the effects of the explosion, but to the remedies applied, or rather to the poison imagined to be infused into the application by the 33 god of the foreigners.
his father is the venerable king of huahine; and has, ever since his return, proved not only a father to the people, but a uniform and bright ornament to the religion of the cross.

it does not appear that mai's house was designed as a model by which the natives were to be encouraged to build their own, but a place of security for the property, which he was recommended to enclose with a spacious native building: and the pursuits of its present occupants are in delightful contrast with the childish exhibition of fireworks, or the display of those trinkets, by which it was endeavoured to impress the minds of the natives with ideas of english superiority.
o, what hallowed music must have broken on his listening ear, and what rapture must have thrilled his soul, when he distinctly recognized the voice of prayer, and heard a native, in the accents of his mother-tongue, with an ardour that proved his sincerity, addressing petitions and thanksgivings to the throne of mercy.

the suddenness and circumstances of his death, taken in connexion with the troubles in which he had recently been engaged with the greater part of the people of the island, on account of his violent seizure of the idol of atehuru, strengthened in no small degree the idolatrous veneration with which the natives regarded their god; and the anger of 67 oro was by them supposed to be the direct cause of pomare's death.
we always stated plainly, that it 429 was the contents of that volume which we came to teach them; that the existence of this baneful and often fatal influence was too extensively felt to allow of its being questioned; that the antidote to the evil it might have already inflicted, and the preservative against its future effects, were pointed out; and that it was wiser, and far more important, to apply to those remedies, than to indulge in unprofitable speculations relative to its origin.

if the natives affirmed that the word or sentence was correctly pronounced by the missionary, it was left for more careful and deliberate investigation.
my joy, and excitement of feeling, was not less than theirs.
when i concluded, they all stoop up; the boys formed a circle on one side, and the girls on the other, and sang alternately the verses of a hymn in the native language; after which, one of the teachers offered a short prayer,and we retired, under the influence of emotions of satisfaction; but it was not easy to say whether joy was most powerfully exhibited in the countenances of the children or their parents.
many soon learned to sew the sheets together, others cut pieces of wood very thin, instead of pasteboard, which were fastened to the sides; the edges of the leaves were then cut with a knife; and the book used in this state daily, while the owner was searching for a skin or a piece of leather, with which to cover it for more effectual preservation.
the missionaries who had arrived undertook to finish what their predecessors had commenced; and although it was an undertaking of great labour, it was ready to be launched in a few weeks after they had landed.
sometimes they endeavoured to persuade him to abandon so hopeless a project, as that of attempting to train the people to habits of industry.
considering her an idolatress, the missionaries deemed this an inconsistent and unlawful act, and not only declined to sanction the proceeding, but endeavoured by every means to dissuade him from it; but mr. lewis, persevering in his determination, they dissolved the connexion that had subsisted between him and themselves, as members of a christian church or society, and discontinued all religious and social intercourse with him.
in tahiti, the idolaters proceeded to the greatest acts of lawless violence and horrid murder.
it is much to be regretted, that the missionaries on the spot—who were intimately acquainted with every indication of the moral and spiritual process that was going on, even in its incipient stages, and every event which marked its gradual development, until, in the language of the natives on another but similar occasion, it burst upon them like the light of the morning—did not, at the time, prepare a full and particular account of the work which, under god, they had been instrumental in effecting: but their motto always was, to “say too little rather than too much,” to persevere in labour, rather than employ their time in detailing their engagements; and to exercise the greatest caution and brevity in speaking of any thing connected– 177 –with themselves, or the people around them, lest subsequent events should disappoint the anticipations which existing favourable appearances might originate.
they now celebrated the subversion of idolatry, under circumstances that, but a few hours before, had threatened their own extermination, with the overthrow of the religion they had espoused, and on – 153 – account of which their destruction had been sought.
on reaching atehuru, they found the rebels had taken refuge in their pare or natural fortress, about four miles and a half from the beach.
they had heard that, when seen by navigators, they sometimes 311 averted the threatened danger by discharging their artillery at the waterspout.
these chandeliers, as they may perhaps with propriety be called, were not indeed of curious workmanship of dazzling brilliancy, in polished metal or cut-glass, but of far more common materials, and simplicity of structure.
peace continued during the remainder of the year, and the missionaries were enabled to persevere in their labours, although they were cheerless, and apparently useless.
he was accompanied by his wife, maihota, and twelve of his people, equally anxious with himself, to know more respecting these important matters.
the influence which a missionary will aim to possess is more difficult to attain; but when once possessed, is of exceedingly greater value.
in this delightful situation, as he travelled round the islands, he literally found them not merely willing to be instructed, but anxious to hear; meeting together of their own accord, and often spending the hours of night in conversation and inquiry on the important matters connected with the religion of jesus christ.
the frame of the building had been prepared with great care, several of the pillars being of polished aito, or casuarina.
the natives of the south sea islands, although scarcely alarmed at thunder and lightning, are at sea greatly terrified by the appearance of waterspouts.
he was yoked to a lever on one side of the central roller; a number of natives, pushing at another on the opposite side, turned the mill, and pressed the juice from the cane.
our houses were now thronged by individuals anxious to be instructed; and so soon as mrs. barff or mrs. ellis had taught any of the females, these immediately taught others; and those who excelled in the fineness of their platting, or in putting it together, were fully employed by the chiefs and others, and derived no small emolument from their new avocation.
the men who had eaten their fellow-men, might have been, and perhaps often were, (as many of the cannibals inhabit the low coralline islands, and live by fishing,) eaten by sharks, which would sometimes be caught and eaten by the inhabitants of distant islands.
axes, hatchets, planes, chisels, gimlets, and saws, were, next to their books, the articles in greatest demand and highest esteem.
the conduct of patii, when it became more extensively known, produced the most decisive effects on priests and people.

the beauty of the wooded or rocky shores now appeared more rich and varied than before; the stillness of the smooth waters around was only occasionally disturbed by the passage of a light nautilus-like canoe, with its little sail of white native cloth, or the rapid flight of a shoal of flying-fish, which, when the dashing of our oars or the progress of our boat intercepted their course or awakened their alarm, sprang from their native element, and darted along, three or four feet above the water.
not a few instances have occurred among the islands of the pacific, in which individuals, who, while their presents were unsparingly lavished upon the people, were regarded as kings and chiefs among them, but who, when they have experienced a reverse in their circumstances, have been treated with marked and contemptuous neglect.
in addition to these public instructions, they held a meeting every sabbath evening with those whose names had been written down as the disciples of christ, and spent much time in more private endeavours to direct 120 the views, and confirm the belief, of those who were desirous to be added to their number.

in reference to tahiti, and the change generally, captain gambier observes, the testimony is a strong one: as i had never felt any interest in the labours of missionaries, i was not only not prepossessed in favour of them, but i was in a measure suspicious of their reports.
in this state of distressing anxiety, without any means of flying from the gathering storm, all the families continued till the 25th of october, when a vessel from port jackson providentially anchored in the bay, and, by ensuring a safe retreat in the event of sudden assault, afforded no small alleviation to their minds.
by the same conveyance mr. and mrs. nott removed to tahiti, where mr. nott has since laboured in matavai, or the adjacent district of pare.
we enjoyed a most delightful sail along the northern part of eimeo the next morning, and soon after twelve o'clock anchored in the spacious and charming bay of opunohu, or, as it is usually called by foreigners, the harbour to taloo.

some substituted tough pieces of fish-skin, pieces of the skin of other animals, or leather procured from the ships; but these soon broke, and many of the natives set to work to make wooden hinges.
it is because of this that i rejoice, and i pray to jehovah, that he may increase my abhorrence of every evil way.
i have occasionally preached in the royal mission chapel, but never when any other person besides was engaged; consequently, i cannot say what effect is produced on the ear by the delivery of more than one discourse at the same time.
after our arrival at huahine, in addition to the preparation of their dwellings, messrs. nott and davies had been employed in preaching to the people, and preparing the gospels of matthew and john for the press.
of tea and sugar, and many other comforts, they had long been destitute; and their apparel was scarcely such as to enable them to appear respectable in the company of any of their countrymen who might visit the island.
circumstances, unforeseen and uncontrollable by their enemies, had prevented the different parties from arriving punctually at their respective points of rendezvous; otherwise, even now escape would have been impracticable, and destruction inevitable, as the porionu, inhabitants of pare, matavai, and apaiano, would have been on the one side, and in their rear, and the party from atehuru and papara on the other.
the three-one, he it is that can make the love of sin to cease; we cannot effect it; it is the work of god to cause evil things to be cast off, and the love of them to cease.
when the missionaries met at the house in which 102 they had lodged, the good tidings were communicated; the individual was sought out; and they were cheered with the simple yet affecting account he gave of what god had done for his own soul, and of the serious impressions then operating on the minds of several of his countrymen.
they are sublime objects of unusual interest, when viewed from the shore; but when beheld at sea, especially if near, and from a small and fragile bark, as we had seen them, it is almost impossible so to divest the mind of a sense of personal danger, as to contemplate with composure their stately movement, or the rapid internal circular eddy of the waters.
they were, however, followed by a numerous train of his attendants, &c. who had by some means heard that the work was about to commence.
for a number of days no fires were allowed to be lighted, in order that these might be effectual: but all were unavailing; the young chief, who had scarcely arrived at the age of manhood, died in the district of pare on the 19th of june, 1803.
the sleeves were long and loose, and buttoned at the wrists, while the lower parts reached nearly to the ankles.
their object was to make the tour of tahiti, with the visitor from the leeward islands.

the chief at first seemed unwilling to listen, but at last said he would attend to their religion.
they were planted, and have since flourished, so that in every island the coffee plant is now growing, and it may be cultivated 292 to almost any extent.
crowds of the natives were already collected around the door, but they made way for him, and, after he and his two companions had been admitted, the door was closed, and the small window next the sea darkened, as he did not wish to be overlooked by the people on the outside.
when the printing-office was finished, as the purau branches composing the walls afforded but an indifferent shelter from the rain and wind the 219 sides of the printing-office were boarded, and one or two glass windows introduced; probably the first ever seen in eimeo.
their family connexions may not indeed have been of the highest class, neither may the individuals themselves have enjoyed the advantages of a very liberal education, nor possessed any very extensive acquaintance with the world.
two new places, upon the same plan as the chapel, and built with similar materials, were afterwards erected, one for the boys' school, and the other for the girls'; these, when finished, greatly facilitated the instruction of the people—the accommodation they afforded, encouraging those to attend who had before been deterred.
a heathen ceremony was at hand, for which a human victim was required, and this young man was selected by his persecutors, because he professed to be a worshipper of the true god.

mr. armitage taught them to card the cotton, and mrs. armitage instructed them in spinning.
a plentiful repast had been prepared, which was carved, and handed to them as they sat upon the green turf.
before, however, these feelings could be exercised, and the earth had drunk up his blood, or his insulted corpse was deposited on their altar, his liberated and ransomed spirit had winged its way to the realms of blessedness, had joined “the noble army of martyrs;” and united in ascriptions of grateful homage unto him who had loved him, and not only made him faithful to the end, but triumphant over death.
there were no haberdashers' shops at hand, whence a supply could be procured; recourse was therefore had to native productions.
the first garment in general use among the females, was a kind of roman tunic, usually of white or blue calico, these being their favourite colours.
a considerable party of the aura tribe came one day to the printing-office, to see the press 228 when they were admitted, and beheld the native printer at work, their astonishment was great.
211 about two o'clock in the afternoon we resumed our journey; travelling sometimes along the seabeach, and at other times availing ourselves of the canoe until near sunset, when we reached afareaitu, and created by our arrival no small stir among the people.
such are the men who have long laboured in these islands; and though others may have been associated with them, who have turned back, or proved themselves unequal to the station, where many, who stand firm at their post at home, would perhaps have fainted, or have fallen under the discouragements inseparable from itthey have been faithful.
his ship remained stationary nearly an hour; and, in consequence of this circumstance, the reef has received the name of the dolphin rock.
trimmings are not so scarce now as formerly, but the supply taken is still inadequate to the requirements of the people, among whom bonnets and hats are now so common, that before i left the leeward islands, scarcely a man, woman, or child was to be seen out of doors without onemany of them possessing two, and sometimes three or four.
was the cry which re-echoed through the place; as the approaching army were seen from different parts of the building.
the same was continued through the second day; but on the third, to the great astonishment of all on board, no individual came near the ship, assigning, afterwards, as a reason, that it was the sabbath.

the scholars are the same as in the day-schools, but the mode of instruction pursued is different.
the atehuruans fled to the valley, and the king and pomare set sail with their fleet to the place of rendezvous; and, lest oro should feel indignant at the treatment he had received, a human sacrifice was ordered; but as they had no captives with them, one of pomare's own servants was murdered, and offered, as soon as the king reached the shore.
he that desires the word of god to grow where it has been planted, and to be conveyed to countries wretched as ours was before it was brought to us, will contribute freely and liberally to promote its extension: he who is unacquainted with its influence, and insensible to its claims, will not, perhaps, exert himself in this work.
the tender plants were once or twice removed, and all perished, excepting those in my garden at huahine, which i was happy to succeed in preserving.
on the evening of the day preceding that on which the ceremony was to take place, the young man, as his custom was, had retired to the brow of a hill that overlooked the valley where he dwelt; and there, seated beneath the embowering shade of an elegant clump of trees, was absorbed in meditation, previous to offering up his evening supplications to his god.

when employed in agricultural pursuits, or in fishing, in which occupation they were as much in the sea as out of it, the men seldom wore any other dress than theirtihere or maro, a broad girdle passed several times round the body.
convinced it is not in the dress with which the person is invested, but in the feelings of the heart 405 with which that dress is regarded, that the evil existsand that pride does not consist in the wearing of apparel superior to that to which an individual may have been accustomed, or to that worn by others, provided it be suitable to his circumstances, and the society with which he associatesthey did not disapprove of the native dresses.
many, in tahiti especially, were plundered of their property, banished from their homes and their possessions; their houses were burnt, and they themselves hunted for sacrifices to be offered to oro, merely because they were bure atua, prayers to god.
the men are generally above the middle stature, and proportionably stout, so that few of the coats, &c. belonging to the captains or officers of vessels touching at the islands were large enough.
in the sandwich islands they sometimes used a bullock's horn, or a long tin horn resembling that used by a mail-coach guard; but, in general, a far more classic instrument, a beautiful marine shell, a species of turbo, or trumpet-shell, varying in size according to the power of the individual by whom it might be sounded.
this retreat was rendered by nature almost impregnable to the native warriors, and the only avenues leading to it being defended by the barriers its occupants had thrown up, it appeared difficult, if not impossible, to take it by storm, even with the foreign aid by which the king was supported.
they succeeded, at length, in inducing the inhabitants, by their example and persuasion, to seek an acquaintance with that more excellent way revealed in the word of god, for whose worship they erected a convenient and respectable building.
a few, including two or three who had been to eimeo, had acquired the elements of reading, or had learned to repeat the lessons in the spelling book, more from memory than acquaintance with spelling and reading; the rest remained nearly in the same state in which they were when visited in 1808 and 1809, excepting that their superstitious ceremonies were discontinued, and they had a building for the worship of the true god.
they embarked on the 7th amid much confusion, but with the sincerest gratitude to god for the refuge so seasonably provided.
the roaring of the tempest, and the hollow sounds that murmured on the ear, as the heavy billow rolled in foam, or broke in contact with opposing billows, seemed as if deep called unto deep; and the noise of waterspouts might almost be heard, while we were momentarily expecting that the mighty waves would sweep over us.
the blessings of christianity were diffused amongst the fine people who inhabited it; a taste for industrious employment had taken deep root; a praiseworthy emulation to excel in the arts which contribute to their welfare and comfort, had seized upon all, and, in consequence, civilization was advancing with rapid strides.
while engaged in these labours, the principal object besides, that occupied our attention, was the study of the language.
mr. nott replied, i fear you are jesting with me, and stating what you think we wish, rather than what you intend.
the natives were delighted to behold foreigners coming to take up their permanent residence among them; as those they had heretofore seen had been transient visitors, with the exception of the spanish missionaries and their attendants, and a spaniard, who had saved his life by escaping from langara's ship, while it was lying at anchor off vaiarua, in taiarabu, in march, 1773; at which time three of his shipmates were executed.
the natives, in general, now considered it a great favour to be taught, though it was sometimes found that they had entertained very incorrect ideas of the motives by which their instructors were influenced.

at on place, though the people on their first arrival welcomed them cordially, yet when they understood the object of their visit, a marked, and by no means pleasing change, appeared in their behaviour.
shortly after our arrival in huahine, a large boat belonging to mahine, the chief of the island, two others belonging to messrs. orsmond and williams, and a fleet of canoes, brought down from eimeo a number of chiefs and people belonging to huahine, raiatea, &c.
the first bound copy was sent to papetoai, and is still, i believe, in mr. nott's possession; the second, half-bound in red morocco, was presented– 229 – to the king, who received it with high satisfaction.
raiatea is not only the most important island of the leeward group, from its central situation and its geographical extent, but on account of its identity, in tradition, with the origin of the people, and their preservation in the general deluge.
pomare then recommended his son, the king, to allow the atehuruan chiefs to retain the idol until a certain ceremony had been performed.
one hundred and thirty-three windows or apertures, furnished with sliding shutters, admit both light and air, and twenty-nine doors afford – 377 – ingress and egress to the congregation.
traders, influenced by the narrow views and interested motives which too frequently regulate the proceedings of those who traffic with uncivilized nations, employed a variety of inducements to prevent the natives affording any encouragement to the establishment.
assisted by the natives, we subsequently erected a rustic mill; and, when the cane in our plantation was ripe, commenced our endeavours to convert it into sugar.
that this was actually the case, appears from several letters which he wrote to the missionaries soon after his arrival in tahiti, as well as from the conversation they had with him on the subject.
a venerable chief rose, and addressed the assembly, with impressive action, and strongly excited feeling.
but to return to our voyage to raiatea: the storm, which had raged with violence ever since an hour after our departure from huahine, began to abate towards the close of the day: we did not, however, see the land, and knew not whither we had drifted; but soon after the setting of the sun, the clouds dispersed, and a streak of light lingering in the western sky, indicated the direction in which we ought to proceed.
as soon as possible, mr. nott was despatched by his companions to tahiti.
this mode of representation, although i do not regard the missionaries or their proceedings as perfect, i consider to be far from just.
mr. crook and family preceded us in a fine large double canoe, called tiaitoerau, literally, “wait for the west wind,” fromtiai to wait, andtoerau west wind.
the rain now ceased; the wind subsided; and although the surface of the sea was considerably agitated, it was no longer that quick dashing conflict of the waves to which we had been exposed, while a war of mountains raged upon its surface, but a long and heavy sluggish sort of motion.
the more intelligent among the natives, who had been longest under instruction at eimeo, usually presided.
when employed in agricultural pursuits, or in fishing, in which occupation they were as much in the sea as out of it, the men seldom wore any other dress than theirtihere or maro, a broad girdle passed several times round the body.
in addition to these means, i found the composing, or setting, of the types for the tahitian books, the best method of acquiring all that was printed in the language.
it was, indeed, a rude and perishable building, totally destitute of every thing imposing in effect, or exquisite in workmanship; yet i beheld it with emotions of pleasure, as the first roof under which the natives of tahiti had assembled, in any number, to receive the elements of useful knowledge, to listen with attention and satisfaction to the word of god, and to render publicly unto him
their astonishment was probably greater than would be experienced by an english peasant from a retired village, on beholding, for the first time, a spacious public building splendidly lighted up with gas.
the proprietors of the cotton garden watched the progress of the plants with care and anxiety, accompanied probably with some of those golden dreams of future emolument which frequently operate very powerfully on the minds of individuals commencing an enterprise, which, although in some degree uncertain as to its results, yet promises, upon the whole, an increase of wealth or enjoyment.
industry, however, soon languishes, unless nurtured by more powerful motives than the effects of abstract principles upon partially enlightened and ill-regulated minds.
the different parties, as they arrived towards midnight, learned, with no ordinary remorse and disappointment, that their prey had been alarmed, and had escaped.
the pilfering habits of the people rendered it necessary for them to watch their property during the night; and the unsettled state of political affairs in the island indicating their exposure to the consequences of actual war, led them to consider the line of conduct it would be their duty under such circumstances to pursue.
this was strikingly evinced on several occasions, when they beheld them use their carpenters' tools, cut with a saw a number of boards out of a tree, which they had never thought it possible to split into more than two, and make, with these, chests, and articles of furniture.
the battle continued to rage with fierceness; several were killed on both sides; the idolaters still pursued their way, and victory seemed to attend their desolating march, until they came to the position occupied by mahine, pomare-vahine, and their companions in arms.
a capacious hole is then dug, wherein fuel in immense logs is piled up till it assumes the appearance of a mound four or five feet high.
in the month of january, 1806, pomare returned from eimeo, bringing with him the idol oro, which was kept in his sacred canoe; while the human sacrifices, offered on his arrival, were suspended on the trees around.
they immediately left hold of the ropes, and stood gazing in astonishment alternately at the king, and the place against which the bottle had been thrown.
cotton for another piece was prepared, and the natives commenced spinning; but the confinement required being irksome, and their expectation rather lowered, as to the quality of the cloth they were to receive as wages for their labour,—before the warp was ready for the loom, they simultaneously discontinued their work.
it was 231 quite amusing to see goats' dogs' and cats' skins collected to be prepared for book-covers.
they were, however, the only inventions of the kind the natives had ever seen; and on the night when the chapel was first illuminated by their aid, as they came in one after another, and saw the glare of such a number of lights suspended from the roof in a manner that they could not at first understand, they involuntarily stopped to gaze as they entered the door, and few proceeded to their seats without an exclamation of admiration or surprise.
the island of huahine had, in common with the others forming the leeward group, been visited by mr. nott, who had travelled round it, preaching to the inhabitants of the principal villages.
he was a man of low education, and bad principles; and if he did not intentionally misrepresent the communications of the missionaries, his statements must often have conveyed to the minds of the natives very erroneous impressions of their sentiments and wishes.
long before we anchored, messrs. bicknell, – 201 – wilson, henry, and davies, came on board, followed by the other members of the mission, who greeted our arrival with satisfaction.
hautaua valley is an interesting spot, not only on account of the events connected spot, not only on account of the events connected with the early history of christianity, which transpired within its borders, but also from the peculiarity of its scenery.
taatahee, the remaining chief of the rebels, who was related to pomare, directed her to tell him, that when they had done to him, as they had done to rua the slain chief, then, and not till then, there would be peace.
this commission was executed, and not only were their objects of worship destroyed, their temples thrown down, the houses of their idols consumed, and idol-worship no longer practised; but the rude stills employed in preparing ardent spirits from the sugarcane, and other indigenous productions, were either broken, or hid under ground.
the example, thus furnished by their teachers, has led to the strict and general observance of the sabbath by the nation at large.
in adapting letters to its sounds, forming its orthography, and exhibiting the vernacular tongue in writing to the people, presenting to the eye that which had before been applied only to the ear, and thus furnishing a vehicle by which light and knowledge might be conveyed through a new avenue to the mind, they were unaided by the labours of any who had preceded them, and were therefore the pioneers of those who might follow.
the arrival of so large a reinforcement enabled the missionaries to make arrangements for re-occupying their original station in tahiti, and establishing a mission in the society, or, as they are usually termed, when spoken of in connexion with tahiti and eimeo, the leeward islands.
but the ship duff had not sailed, and the spirit of missionary enterprise was not aroused in the british churches.

we commenced preparing it for the site of our dwelling; and when cleared, it was a most delightful spot.
mr. nott again read the verse, “god so loved the world,” &c. told him it was true, and that it was the message god had sent to them, and that whosoever believed in him, would not perish, but be happy after death.

hence he was induced to prohibit an acknowledgement to the gods of his ancestors, and to invite the teachers of christianity to his camp, to speak unto him and his adherents words whereby they might be saved.
the men, however, were less scrupulous: and whether it resulted from their fondness of variety, or a supposition that the same clothes, worn in different ways, would appear like distinct articles of dress, i am not able to say; but i have seen a stocking sometimes on the leg, and sometimes – 394 – on the arm, and a pair of pantaloons worn one part of the day in a proper manner, and during another part thrown over the shoulders, the arms of the wearer stretched through the legs, and the waistband buttoned round the chest.
captain gambier, who visited them in the same year, in the extracts from his journal, which have been published, states, in reference to the manner of attending the duties of the sabbath among the young, that, the silencethe order preservedthe devotion 416 and attention paid to the subject, surprised and pleased me beyond measure.
many of their relatives or countrymen had been devoured by sharks; a limb or large portion of the fleshy part of the body of others, had been destroyed by these voracious fish.
assisted by two or three natives, mr. bicknell and mr. nott dug a grave in a spot near their dwelling on the north side of matavai bay, which had been selected as a place of interment.
on this, as well as other equally important points, their queries, from native simplicity and entire ignorance, were sometimes both puerile and amusing.
iv conduct of the rebels–discouraging impression under which the missionaries abandoned the islands–invitation from pomare to return–state of the king's mind during his exile in eimeo–his reception of the missionaries–death of three of their number–influence of domestic bereavement on the missionary life–pomare's profession of christianity–application for baptism–demonstration of the impotency of their idols–proposal to erect a place of worship–extracts from his correspondence–influence of his steady adherence to christianity–ridicule and persecution to which he was exposed–visit of missionaries to tahiti–valley of hautaua–oitu and tuahine.
after watching in breathless suspense for some time its advance in a line towards our ship, we had the satisfaction to see it incline in its course towards the starboard quarter, and ultimately pass by about a mile distant from the stern.
mr. and mrs. threlkeld, who had sailed with us from england, but had been obliged by domestic affliction to remain at rio janeiro, and mr. and mrs. barff, who had originally left england with mr. orsmond, joined us by the same conveyance.
we had, however, occasion to regret, that we were sometimes at as great a loss as the people themselves.
i was enabled to conclude the service with less difficulty than i expected, and was happy to have an opportunity of declaring, though very imperfectly, truths that were able to make those to whom they were delivered, wise unto salvation, through faith in christ jesus.
no long period had elapsed since the first establishment of the mission, without a vessel's touching at tahiti.

the matter of the lessons, they also thought was the great thing to be remembered; and this, together with a desire to facilitate the advancement of those under their care, led them to adopt the method of teaching the scholars to repeat lessons without due attention to the words of the book.

6 from a spanish account of chiloe, &c. published in 1791, it appears that, in 1772, two ships, sent by the viceroy of peru to survey the islands of the pacific, visited tahiti, and conveyed to peru two natives, who were baptized there, and sent back, in 1774, with two roman catholic missionaries.

pomare, entering one day when the blacksmith was employed, after gazing a few minutes at the work, was so transported at what he saw, that he caught up the smith in his arms, and, unmindful of the dirt and perspiration inseparable from his occupation, most cordially embraced him, and saluted him, according to the custom of his country, by touching noses.
mr. gyles, on his way to the colony of new south wales in the month of august 1819, spent some time at huahine and raiatea; and we gladly availed ourselves of his visit, to make further inquiries relative to the object for which he had come to the islands.
he also requested to be baptized, and to become one of the disciples of the lord jesus christ, assuring the missionaries that his resolution to give himself up to god, was the result of long and increasing conviction of the truth and superiority of the religion of the bible, expressing at the same time his desire to be more fully instructed in the matters to which it referred.
several chiefs, of inferior influence, – 254 – collecting their dependents, encamped on the borders of the lake near maeva, and threatened to avenge the insult to the gods, by attacking the chiefs who had sanctioned their destruction.

in the evening several of the missionaries met for social worship, and with this sacred exercise we closed our first sabbath in the society islands, under a deep impression of the advantages of christianity, and the pleasing effects, which we had that day witnessed, of divine influence over the hearts of the most profligate idolaters.
individuals, whose minds were deeply imbued with the subject, who had identified themselves with its progress and its results, and had embarked not only their influence, but much of their property, in the undertaking, might, and probably did, under the ardour of their feelings, indulge on some occasions in a splendour of imagery, and a richness of description, that exceeded the sober realities of fact: but they never imagined that they could subvert any system of idolatry by their own agency; or, that their efforts would be in any degree effectual for the conversion of the people, but as they were attended by the influence of the holy spirit.
the religion of jesus christ was the topic of conversation until they reached the settlement; when patii took his leave, and mr. nott informed his colleagues of the success of his visit to the young chief of huahine, and the determination which the priest of the district had made known to him.

the uncultivated sides of the mountains, and the low flat sandy parts of the shore, seldom tilled by the natives, were reclaimed by his industry; and many extensive groves of cocoa-nut trees in tahiti and eimeo, which the inhabitants say were planted by pomare, remain as monuments of his patriotism, and yield no small emolument to their present proprietors.
it has also been stated, that in his reception and treatment of the refugees, he was not acting more from the dictates of his own generosity, than from the suggestions of the chief heathen prophet of the nation, who had engaged, provided his advice was followed, to restore to him the dominion in tahiti.
by the queen, or her sister, the king sent over a new book to aimata, his infant daughter, which being considered as an indication of his purpose that she should be trained up in the new religion, was a source of great encouragement to the converts, and of corresponding dissatisfaction to the idolaters, who already began to meditate on the means of effecting the destruction of the christians.
near one of the large cocoa-nut trees, whose cylindrical trunk appeared like a natural pillar supporting the roof, there was a rustic sort of stand, four or five feet above the ground, on which mr. nott took his station.
while making these inquiries, many of them, doubtless, recollected the conduct of his father, in sending one night, when the warriors of atehuru had gone over to tautira, a body of men, who at midnight fell upon their defenceless victims, the aged relations, 159 wives, and children of the atehuruans, and in cold blood cruelly murdered upwards of one hundred helpless individuals; and this probably made the conduct of pomare ii.
on the following sabbath, taaroarii attended; his father also became, a few months afterwards, a sincere convert.

about a month after our departure from papetoai, mr. orsmond, who had sailed from england about july, 1816, arrived at eimeo, and, after residing some time with the missionaries at papetoai, he removed to afareaitu, pursued harmoniously with us the study of the language, assisted in preparing books for the people, and in other duties of the station, and subsequently accompanied us to the leeward islands.
although reports of war were heard during the year, there was no actual hostility; and, under discouragements every day increasing, the missionaries were enabled to prosecute their labours, having found it difficult to engage the attention of the children, while attempting to teach them in the presence of the adults, who ridiculed the idea of their learning letters, they opened a school in a part of their own dwelling.

these excursions, although they gave us an opportunity of examining more extensively the aspect of the country and the state of its inhabitants, often proved fatiguing.

this circumstance should never be lost sight of; it is a wonderful manifestation of the faithfulness of god, who has declared 184 that his word shall not return unto him void, but shall be found even after many days; and it is remarkably adapted to cheer the hearts of all who are called to labour and wait patiently, sowing season after season in hope, without reaping the wished-for harvest.
so long as our distributions had been frequent and increasingly valuable, the expressions of attachment would 257 have been ardent, and the attendance regular; but when these had failed, their zeal, &c. would have declined, and the chapel and the school would have been deserted.

at raiatea, a sun-dial was erected, by which the natives, when the sun shone, were informed of the proper time for ringing their bell: at the other stations they usually applied to the missionaries, by whose watches the meetings were regulated, but here they had neither dial nor watch: they therefore regulated their time of assembling in the school or the chapel by the situation of the sun.
clothing and iron tools appeared to be most earnestly sought; and, not-withstanding the measures of security which they adopted, their blacksmith's shop was robbed by a native, who dug two or three feet into the ground on the outside, and, burrowing his way under the wall or side of the house, came up through the earthen floor within, and stole several valuable articles.

numbers of the natives had indeed visited england, but their observation had been so limited, or their accounts so contradictory and exaggerated that their countrymen knew not what to believe, and not unfrequently, when any of these had returned, the substance of their reports was brought to the questioning meeting, to receive our confirmation or explanation.
in the court-yard of the king we were met by our friends messrs. williams and threlkeld, in whose society we spent about fourteen days, and who, considering the short time they had been among the people, had been the means of producing an astonishing change, not only in their habits and appearance, but even in the natural face of the district.

most of the valuable plants had been removed by the people to their own gardens, as the spot selected by me was not one which they would have preferred.
the change which had taken place in tahiti and eimeo, in consequence of the abolition of idol worship, had been exceedingly gratifying, as it regarded the general conduct of the people, their professed belief in the truth of revelation, and their desire to regulate their lives by its injunctions; but the visible change which resulted from the establishment of the missions in huahine and raiatea, was more striking, and did not fail to attract the notice, and command the approbation, of the most superficial observer.

pomare, and not the missionary, had on this occasion been employed as the agent, under god, in influencing the mind of the young chief, who was likely to become the king of huahine and eimeo, and in a way which at once demonstrated that it was the purpose of god that he he should be made acquainted with divine truth.

the sides and bottom of this bedstead were made– 341 – with the boards of the bread-fruit tree.

the state of feeling, also, that prevailed among the inhabitants at this time, predisposed them readily to attend to any recommendations of the kind; and the great deference they now paid to the counsel of their teachers, presented an opportunity more favourable than had ever occurred before, or was likely to occur again.

although this honourable conduct produced a surprising effect upon the minds of many of the inhabitants of tahiti and eimeo, who considered the king better acquainted both with the religion of the natives, and that of the foreigners, than any other person in the islands; it procured him many enemies, and exposed him to no ordinary degree of ridicule and persecution, or contempt, not only from his idolatrous rivals, but from his allies, and the members of his household and family.

this prudential reserve, on some accounts, cannot be too highly commended; yet, it is possible to carry it too far; and, in the present instance, however honourable to the individuals who maintained it, it cannot be doubted that the world has been thereby deprived of a full record of events, intimately connected with the destinies of the of the people among whom they transpired, and with the propagation of the gospel in the most distant parts of the world, during every future age of the christian church.

these proceedings, however, must have originated in very contracted views of the influence of such an establishment, which, while it may induce and encourage habits of more regular employment, can never diminish the demand for british calicoes, which will be superior in texture, pattern, &c. to any that can be made in the islands.

he appears to have passed the remainder of his life in inglorious indolence or wanton crime, to have become the mere instrument of the caprice or cruelty of the king of the island, who not only availed himself of the effects of his fire-arms in periods of war, but frequently ordered him to shoot at a man at a certain distance, in order to see how far the musket would do execution; or to despatch with his pistol, in the presence of the king, the ill-fated objects of his deadly anger.

discouraging as these circumstances were, the missionaries would not have abandoned their station, but for the destruction with which the civil war, and the defeat of the king, seriously threatened them; and, in addition to this darkened aspect of affairs, as it regarded the success of their enterprise, the state of feeling, bordering on hopeless despair, under which they departed from the islands, greatly augmented their distress.

the supply now procured is, however, more regular, and the introduction of goats furnishing milk, and the flesh of the kid, the feeding of cattle, by which means the residents are able to make butter, and occasionally to kill an ox, has greatly improved their circumstances.
the proprietors of the cotton garden watched the progress of the plants with care and anxiety, accompanied probably with some of those golden dreams of future emolument which frequently operate very powerfully on the minds of individuals commencing an enterprise, which, although in some degree uncertain as to its results, yet promises, upon the whole, an increase of wealth or enjoyment.

the introduction among an indolent people, of any art that requires constant, and sometimes heavy labour, must be gradual; but as building, and the use of household furniture, &c., increases among the people, skill in these departments will be held in higher esteem, and the number of workmen will necessarily increase with the demand for their labour, and the remuneration it receives.
at other times, we travelled round in the neighbourhood of the shore, alternately walking on the beach, or, proceeding in a light canoe, paddled along the shallow water near the shore.

the missionaries had often, with mingled feelings of horror and pity, heard their songs of licentiousness or of war, as well as the cantillations of their heathen worship, and their songs in honour of their idols; and it is scarcely possible to form an adequate idea of the delightful transport with which, at first, they must have heard the high praises of the almighty preferred by native voices.

the schools are important appendages o every missionary station, and are considered such by the most intelligent and influential of the people.
he instantly rose to the surface; and, snorting, as if glad, even under these circumstances, to gain his freedom, swam towards the shore; but the natives no sooner saw him at liberty, than they plunged into the water, and followed like a shoal of sharks or porpoises after him.
they were planted, and have since flourished, so that in every island the coffee plant is now growing, and it may be cultivated– 292 – to almost any extent.
though the inconsistency of this statement with the defenceless manner in which the missionaries had come amongst them, would have been self-evident to an enlightened mind,—being supported by an incontrovertible historical fact, it was remarkably adapted to operate powerfully upon an individual but partially informed, and exceedingly suspicious of every measure that might permanently alienate the smallest portion of territory, or lead to the establishment of foreign proprietorship, and consequent influence, in the islands.
the queen's sister, like a daughter of pallas, tall, and rather masculine in her stature and features, walked and fought by mahine's side; clothed in a kind of armour, or defence, made with strongly twisted cords ofromaha, or native flax, and armed with a musket and a spear.
the gratification he expressed on their landing, however, did not arise from any desire after religious instruction, for in this interview he spoke of their engaging in war with him, and probably rejoiced in their arrival only as a means of increasing the extent of his influence, and the stability of his government.
the pulpit, situated at a short distance from the northern end, was hexagonal, and supported by six pillars of the beautiful wood of thepua, which resembles, in its grain and colour, the finest satinwood.
exactly a fortnight after her departure, this vessel again entered matavai bay, much to the surprise of the missionaries, who were informed by the captain and supercargo, that, in consequence of a severe gale off huahine, she was unfitted for her voyage to massuefero, and that they intended to proceed to port jackson, when they had increased their supplies.
presentations of this kind were not uncommon among the islanders, as a compliment, or matter of courtesy, to a visitor; and were regulated by the rank and means of the donors, or the dignity of the guests.
this entrance is called by the – 331 – inhabitants tipae mau, true, or permanent, landing (place.)
in reference to presents made by missionaries to chiefs, on their first settlement among an unenlightened people, i am disposed to think they are always injurious, when given with a view of gaining influence, or inducing their recipients to attend to religious instruction.
the first was the queen charlotte, of port jackson, the vessel by which we arrived in the islands.
we explored the district carefully, but often found the brushwood, and interlaced branches of the trees, so impervious, that, without a hatchet, we should have penetrated but a short distance from the winding paths trodden by the natives.
appearance and convenience, however, were not much considered by the society islanders, and it was often amusing to see a nativesans culotte, without waistcoat or shirt, with amaro or pareu round his waist, and a fashionably made black coat– 395 – on his back.
this mode of representation, although i do not regard the missionaries or their proceedings as perfect, i consider to be far from just.
it was also the first building in the islands ever used by the natives for this sacred purpose.
what the natives thought of it i do not know, but to those who were accustomed to associate with a gallows, and any object so attached to it, only ideas of an execution, or of a criminal hung in irons, its appearance was not adapted to awaken very gratifying feelings.
about a month after our departure from papetoai, mr. orsmond, who had sailed from england about july, 1816, arrived at eimeo, and, after residing some time with the missionaries at papetoai, he removed to afareaitu, pursued harmoniously with us the study of the language, assisted in preparing books for the people, and in other duties of the station, and subsequently accompanied us to the leeward islands.

pomare, by uniting the refugees with his adherents in eimeo, and his auxiliaries from the leeward islands, might bring against them.
the king's visit to tahiti did not succeed so well as the messengers had promised, or his friends 99 had anticipated: rumours of war prevailed in the western and southern parts of the island, and many of the chiefs sent professions of subjection; but the continuance of such acknowledgment was uncertain.
he was an intelligent, active young man, 24 years of age, had been highly serviceable to the mission, and was respected by the natives, until about tweleve months prior to the arrival of the royal admiral, when he intimated his doubts as to the reality of divine influence on the mind, and the immortality of the soul.
a spot near the principal stream was selected for their site; the inhabitants of the district undertook ot build the printing-office, while the king's people, and the inhabitants of maatea, agreed to put up the frame of my dwelling-house.
the interior of the roof was remarkable for the neatness of its appearance, and the ingenuity of its structure.
in the forenoon of the day after we came to anchor, accompanied by matapuupuu, we walked through the district, in search of a house for mr. orsmond and myself, and at length selected one on the southern side of the bay, belonging to taaroarii, the young chief of the island, while mr. and mrs. williams were accommodated with another belonging to maau, a raatira, who resided near the anchorage.
we accompanied them to the shore, and landed on the western side of the bay, in the afternoon of the 13th of february, 1817, happy, under circumstances of health and comfort, to enter upon our field of future labour, and grateful for the merciful providence by which we had been conducted in safety to the end of our long and eventful voyage.
the tender plants were once or twice removed, and all perished, excepting those in my garden at huahine, which i was happy to succeed in preserving.
he laboured diligently to multiply the resources of the island, and improve the condition of the people, and his adherents were always well furnished with all that the island afforded.
the king proposed to find materials, and the missionaries labour.
this, in fact, was the trumpet carried by the king's messenger; and i have often been delighted to see a tall and active man, or a lively and almost ruddy boy, with a light cloak or scarf thrown loosely over his shoulder, a wreath of flowers on his head, and amaro or girdle around loins,a shell, suspended by a braided cord, carelessly hanging on his arm,going round the village, stopping at intervals to sound his shell, and afterwards, perhaps, inviting the listening throng to hasten to the school, or to attend the place of worship.
while he was thus engaged, relief was afforded, and the weeping and forebodings of the family turned into grateful wonder, and joyous gratulations.32a i simply state the fact, as it is recorded by the missionary in the island at the time, without making any comment; which, indeed, it neither requires nor admits.
the chiefs take a pride in building their own houses, which are now all after the european manner; and think meanly of themselves, if they do not excel the lower classes in the arts necessary for the construction.

flour is, consequently, now only to be obtained from vessels visiting the islands.
the missionaries who had been expelled from tahiti in 1808, had remained here some months prior to their final departure for port jackson; but at these periods only a temporary impression had been made upon the minds of the people, which had in a great degree, if not altogether, subsided.
idleness has been a most fruitful source of many of their vices and sufferings; and when we have seen the females working with their needle, or with the straw for their bonnets, &c. we could not but deem it an occupation far more conducive to their enjoyment, than indolence, or their former unprofitable and often injurious pastimes.
not a few instances have occurred among the islands of the pacific, in which individuals, who, while their presents were unsparingly lavished upon the people, were regarded as kings and chiefs among them, but who, when they have experienced a reverse in their circumstances, have been treated with marked and contemptuous neglect.
after wandering some time among the clustering sugar-cane, rows of pine-apples, plantains, and bananas, i approached this house for private devotion.
a fine stream, rising in the interior mountains, winds through the sinuosities of the head of the valley, and, fertilizing the district of matavai, flows through the centre of this long neck of land, into the sea.
the king had been unable to withstand the temptation with which he had been assailed at tahiti, to use ardent spirits; and although not addicted to entire intoxication, yet it induced the missionaries to fear that he, like agrippa, was but almost a christian.
the curiosity awakened in the inhabitants of afareaitu by the establishment of the press, was not soon satisfied: day after day pomare visited the printing-office; the chiefs applied to be admitted inside, while the people thronged the windows, doors, and every crevice through which they could peep, often involuntarily exclaiming, be-ri-ta-ni-e!
the individual who had been brought from the ends of the earth, and shewn whatever england could furnish, suited to impress his wondering mind, returned, and became as rude and indolent a barbarian as before.

soon after breakfast, our captain landed with the saddle and bridle, and other presents, which mr. birnie, of sydney, had sent out with the horse.
raveae was armed with a short musket, which he had reloaded since wounding the chief; of this, it is supposed, the man who held him was unconscious.
whatever may be said of the inutility of bells in churches or chapels in civilized countries, where public clocks are numerous, and watches almost universal—the same objections will not apply to a people destitute of these, and having no means of denoting the hour of the day,– 384 – except by mentioning the situation of the sun in the heavens.
numerous applications were also made for spelling-books, of which, with others of an elementary kind, a supply had been printed in eimeo.
the declarations of scripture on this momentous point, always appeared satisfactory; and although the circumstances of the resurrection, and the manner by which parts of the same body would be united, &c. were inquiries pursued with deepest interest, we generally found them terminate in expressions of desire that they might be prepared, rise with glorified bodies, and come forth from their graves “to the resurrection of life.”
a priest was sent for, who implored the assistance of his god; but, continuing his intercession for a long time, without any apparent relief to the sufferer, he desisted, and left the family in hopeless disappointment.
their enemies at home became bold in denouncing the enterprise as the wild project of extravagance and folly, and stamping upon its projectors and conductors the impress of the blindest fanaticism.
the decision of those who left tahiti, may to some, perhaps, appear premature, but it is not easy to form a correct estimate of the dangers to which they were exposed.
the doctrine of divine benevolence, thus displayed, was altogether new to the tahitians; nothing analogous to it had ever entered into any part of their mythology.
it was made for our infant daughter, with leaflets of the fan-leaved palm, brought from the marquesas; and the first hat we ever saw that had been made 400 there, was one the same individual made for me at huahine, with the same kind of leaves, which were platted by a sailor in eimeo.
they chose rather to feed a number of pigs, or cultivate the vegetables in demand by the shipping, dispose of them when vessels might put in for refreshments, and receive at once in exchange, articles of cloth, &c. than wait till the crops should be gathered, and experience so much uncertainty, or meet with such annoying disappointments in the amount of their returns.
it has opened a new channel for commercial enterprise, and has actually created a market for british manufactures, the consumption of which, among the islands of the pacific that have received the gospel, is already considerable.
about this time, several of the chiefs of raiatea, &c. and many of their adherents, who had come up in 1811 to assist pomare in the recovery of his government and authority in tahiti, returned to their own islands; not, however, without most earnestly requesting the missionaries to send them teachers and books.

the mountains are more stupendous and lofty than those of huahine, and in some parts equally broken and picturesque.

the missionaries, considering the whole of the twelve years spent in tahiti as so much time lost, were commencing afresh their endeavours on another island, and could hardly expect that at this time, after such a protracted delay, god would at once prosper their enterprise.

although the measures adopted by the directors of the missionary society, for encouraging industry among the south sea islanders, and furnishing them with a source of productive labour in the manufacture of sugar, had not accomplished all that was designed, and mr. gyles had returned to england before the expiration of the period for which he had been engaged, the directors still considered that it was their duty to endeavour to promote the temporal prosperity of the peoplethat the introduction of useful mechanic arts, and other means of advancing their civilization, though 294 objects of only secondary importance, were not to be overlooked.

by many of these the missionaries had been able to write to the directors and to their friends in england, and from several they had secured a small supply of such articles as they most needed.
this gave a peculiar interest to the nondescript sort of dwelling, half native hut, and half european cottage, which many of the people at this time inhabited.
shortly after this important event, which may justly be considered as the dawning of that day, and the first ray of that light, which has since shed such lustre, and beamed with such power, upon these isles of the sea, two chiefs arrived from tahiti, inviting pomare to return, and resume his government, promising an amicable adjustment of their differences.
this individual appeared to listen most attentively to what was said; and after the conclusion of the service, he and mr. nott, proceeded together along the beach towards the settlement.
the natives are now convinced that they can make cloth; others, besides those taught in the factory, we may expect will desire to learn; and as they can prepare and spin the cotton at their own dwellings, this employment, which is certainly adapted to their climate and habits, as they can take it up and lay it down at their convenience, will probably be very extensively followed through the islands.
in one of the visits which mr. nott made to the residence of taaroarii, for the purpose of preaching to this people, he was followed by patii, the priest of the temple in papetoai, the district in which the missionaries resided.

individuals, whose minds were deeply imbued with the subject, who had identified themselves with its progress and its results, and had embarked not only their influence, but much of their property, in the undertaking, might, and probably did, under the ardour of their feelings, indulge on some occasions in a splendour of imagery, and a richness of description, that exceeded the sober realities of fact: but they never imagined that they could subvert any system of idolatry by their own agency; or, that their efforts would be in any degree effectual for the conversion of the people, but as they were attended by the influence of the holy spirit.

the gentleman who had hitherto been his employer had proposed to make him his partner, had arranged for the advance of a very considerable sum of money; part of the materials for commencing the new establishment were procured, and the results in that line of business have since been such, as to warrant the inference, that every advantage the parties anticipated might have been realized.
a captain of a ship, at anchor in one of the harbours, was once inquiring of a native something about his wife, who was sitting by.

these remarks apply principally to the commencement 258 of a mission among an unenlightened people, where a school will be an essential part of such establishment; at subsequent periods, rewards to those who have excelled, consisting of books, penknives, inkstands, slates, or other articles connected with the pursuits of the school, may be given with a good effect, tending rather to stimulate to diligent enterprise, than to cherish a spirit of dependent indolence, or to excite expectations that never can be gratified.
committing their persons to the merciful and watchful providence of god, and, under him, to the friendly chiefs who had manifested so much concern for their safety; they had sent all the fire-arms, ammunition, and other weapons, possessed by the society, on board the nautilus, excepting two muskets, which they– 30 – presented to pomare and idia.

a prayer was then offered, during which the congregation remained standing; another hymn was sung; the people then sat down, and listened attentively to a discourse, delivered by the missionary standing on the ground behind the desk.

their determination was made known to their friends; and, as no dissatisfaction appeared, they were led to hope that they should be permitted peaceably to prosecute their labours, without any further solicitation on the subject.
the duration of the buildings was in general according to the nature of the thatch; the same house frequently received two or three new roofs, and if the frame was well put together, and the timber seasoned, a plastered cottage would probably– 358 – last ten or fifteen years.
when the door was made, it was necessary to hang it; but only a few of the chiefs were, for many years, able to procure iron hinges.

i have often heard mr. nott speak, with evident indications of strong feeling, of the emotions with which this letter was read.
the heat of the sun, and the oppressiveness of the atmosphere, with the labour of rowing with their paddles our heavily laden canoes every inch of the way, had so fatigued our men, that when we reached a-ti-ma-ha, fifteen miles from the place whence we started in the morning, we deemed in expedient to land for the night.
several valuable kinds of cotton having been at 281 different times introduced, were also growing remarkably well.
connected with the means employed in the accomplishment of this important work, a few remarks on the agents who, under god, were instrumental in effecting it, may not be inappropriate.
such an observer would often find himself exposed to an influence that could be attributed only to satanic agency; but that why he was permitted to exert this influence on man, was not made known in the bible.

with the study of the language, the erection of a printing-office and a dwelling-house now demanded my attention.
the timber principally employed in their buildings, is the wood of the bread-fruit; and although they are careful of this valuable tree, it is necessary frequently to urge the duty of planting, in order to ensure a future supply not only of timber but of food, as the large trees are now comparatively few, and the population is evidently in creasing.
the anarchy, crime, and wretchedness, which now desolated tahiti, were increased by intemperance, which at this time prevailed to an awful and unprecedented degree.

the erection of a house upon the improved plan, regulating its size by the rank or means of the family for whom it was designed, became a kind of test of sincerity in professions of desire to be instructed; for, to embrace christianity, with the precepts which it inculcated, nothing could be more at variance than the habits of indolence and unsightly filthiness of their former habitations.
when the whole of the missionaries reached huahine, it was proposed in the first instance to form only one station in the leeward islands; and that those of us who had but recently arrived from england, should unitedly prosecute the study of the language, with such assistance as messrs. davies and nott could render us, until we should be able to perform divine service among the people, and conduct the affairs of a distinct station.

he was a man of decision and daring enterprise; and though, on the occasion in tahiti above referred to, he may have acted with a degree of zeal somewhat imprudent, it was a zeal resulting, not from ignorant rashness, but enlightened principle, and holy indignation against the boasting threatening and lying vanities of the priests of idolatry; to whose arts of deception he had formerly been no stranger.
the lower part of the mountain appears basaltic; the central strata are composed of a vesicular kind of volcanic rock, while the upper parts are a large kind ofbreccia.
the tempest increasing, the natives were alarmed, and during the occasional intervals in which the wind abated its violence, the rain came down in tremendous torrents.
i could not but think how awful would my state have been, had i in that hour been ignorant of christ, or had i neglected and despised the offers of his mercy; and while this reflection induced thankfulness to him through whom alone we had been made to share a hope of immortality, it awakened a tender sympathy for our fellow-voyagers, who sat in mournful silence at the helm or in the bottom of the boat, and seemed averse to conversation.

– 187 – emotions of astonishment, admiration, and gratitude, involuntarily arise in every mind in the least degree susceptible of humanity or religion; while increasing convictions of the divine origin of revelation must fasten on the understanding, and additional encouragement strengthen the hopes, of every individual who, according to the promise of god, is anticipating the arrival of a period, when a transformation, equally decisive and lovely, shall change the moral deserts of the earth into regions of order and beauty, and the wilderness shall become as the garden of the lord.

he was remarkably venerable in his appearance, being tall and well made, his countenance open and mild, his forehead high, his hair blanched with age, and his beard as white as silver, hanging down upon his breast.32 he had led a quiet and peaceful life ever since the commencement of the mission, was probably the oldest man in the island, and, what is rather unusual, died apparently from the exhaustion of nature, or old age.

when, however, it was considered, that perhaps this pair of canoes had cost him nearly twelve months' labour, and that, before they were lost, he was comparatively richer than many an english merchant is in the possession of a five or six hundred ton vessel, it appears a remarkable instance of conscientious regard for the sabbath-day.

mr. davies, in his journey round tahiti, in 1816, met with the murderer of the young man who was offered in sacrifice by the people of taiarabu, to insure success in their last attack upon the people of atehuru and papara, and whose tragical death, he justly considered, ought to be recorded, because it is hoped it was the last human sacrifice offered in tahiti, and because the victim was selected on account of his attachment to christianity.

the bread-fruit ripened, while they lay beneath its shadows in luxurious indolence; the cocoa filled its nuts with milk and kernels; and while they slumbered from their heavy meals, in dead forgetfulness of life itself, the fish were spawning in unsounded depths: unplanted roots were thriving under ground, to spread the tables of their future banquets!”
the missionaries were accustomed to meet for prayer at sunrise, on the morning of the sabbath.
the report of his intention had spread among the people of the district, and multitudes assembled to witness this daring act of impiety, or the sudden vengeance which they expected would fall upon the sacrilegious criminal.

the handle was taken out, a string passed through the eye, and when the inhabitants were to 386 assemble, a native boy went through the settlement, holding it up by the string with one hand, and striking it with a stone which he held in the other.
when the missionaries met at the house in which– 102 – they had lodged, the good tidings were communicated; the individual was sought out; and they were cheered with the simple yet affecting account he gave of what god had done for his own soul, and of the serious impressions then operating on the minds of several of his countrymen.
the bonnets are either sewn together, or woven throughout, after the manner of leghorns, and are made not only with the leaves of themau, and the bark of thepurau, but of the fine white layers of the inside of the plantain stalk, the leaf of the sugar-cane, and a strong and beautiful species of fine grass.
a number of pillars in the centre supported the ridge-pole, or rather the different ridge-poles, which unitedly sustained the roof.
if, in addition to those already in existence, there was also an institution for the promotion of agriculture, mechanic arts, social order, and the general civilization of rude and barbarous tribes, such a society would exert a beneficial and powerful influence, and furnish an important agency, in conjunction with those now engaged.

there might be, and perhaps was, a more confident hope of the speedy accomplishment of the object than now prevails; 86 but the appeals and addresses, delivered at that period, manifest a deep conviction of human insufficiency, and breathe a spirit of entire dependence upon the blessing of god.
a number of streams originating in these water-falls pursued their course through the valley, and one, receiving in its way the tributary waters of a number of sequestered streamlets, swelled at times into what in these islands might be called a river, and flowed along the most fertile portions of the district to the sea.
on this we also bestowed personally many an hour, desirous not only to afford those who were inclined to follow our advice, and cultivate the earth for articles of commerce, the encouragement of our counsel and 282 direction, but to demonstrate the practicability of accomplishing, by means within their power, what had been proposed.
the watchful providence of god, over his infant cause in these islands, was remarkably conspicuous in preserving patii and his friends, and allowing them, after the events of the evening, safely and peacefully to retire.

notwithstanding the novelty of our situation, the exposure to the air from the mountains, the roaring of the heavy surf on the reefs, the inroads of dogs, pigs, and natives, with no other shelter than a pile 253 of boxes; we passed a comfortable night, and rose refreshed in the morning, thankful for the kind protection we had experienced, gratified also to find that no article of our property had been stolen, though all was unavoidably exposed.

the repeated trials with which the missionaries were exercised, the privations they endured, and the painful and protracted discouragements by which, at this period, they were depressed, were of no ordinary character.
the letter and presents pomare received by this conveyance from the governor of new south wales, and the attentions paid to him by the commander of the vessel, tended, in no small degree, to confirm otu in his government, and to intimidate his enemies.

a house of wood was erected for these missionaries, near the shore of vaitapeha bay, in taiarapu.
the identity of the body was stated as being consistent with the character and moral government of god, which appeared to require that the same body which had suffered for or in his cause on earth, should be glorified in heaven; and that the same body which in union with the soul had been employed in rebellion and vice, should suffer the just consequences in a– 437 – future state.
at raiatea, a sun-dial was erected, by which the natives, when the sun shone, were informed of the proper time for ringing their bell: at the other stations they usually applied to the missionaries, by whose watches the meetings were regulated, but here they had neither dial nor watch: they therefore regulated their time of assembling in the school or the chapel by the situation of the sun.
the female school in huahine was under the management of mrs. barff and mrs. ellis; and those at several of the other stations were also superintended by the wives of the missionaries.
these encouraging appearances, in regard to the affairs of the christians, only appeared to arouse the anger of their idolatrous enemies, who were no longer satisfied with simply ridiculing, and treating with contempt, the objects of their hatred, but proceeded to more alarming plans of resistance against the progress of the new principles which were daily gaining ground among the people.
while some of the missionaries were employed in the exercise of those arts which were adapted to make the most powerful impression upon the– 13 – minds of the natives, others were equally diligent in exploring the adjacent country, planting the seeds they had brought with them from europe and brazil, and studiously endeavouring to gain an acquaintance with the native language, which they considered essential to the accomplishment of their objects.
the king, determined in his purpose, levied a requisition for materials and labour on the chiefs and people of tahiti and eimeo, by whose combined efforts it was ultimately finished.

hitherto, however, they had generally worn the european cottons, &c. in the native manner, either as a light tehei, thrown over the shoulder, a pareu wound round the waist, or ahu buu, a kind of large scarf or shawl, loosely covering the greater part of the body.
but although the missionaries were cheered with the hope of often beholding it filled with attentive hearers or christian worshippers, they were obliged to pull it down early in the year 1802, to prevent its affording shelter to their enemies, or being set on fire by the rebels, by which their own dwelling might have been destroyed.
after four years, each tree bore about forty berries, which when perfectly ripe were gathered, and sent to the several stations.
a strong paling, or stockade, was planted round the house; boards, covered with nails, were sunk in the paths leading to it; and thither the missionaries, captain bishop, captain house, commander of the vessel that had been wrecked, and the seamen under their orders, now retired, as they daily received the most alarming accounts of the intention of the rebels to make their next attack upon them.

nor do i think we are to conclude, that, after the change in their instruction, the doctrine of the saviour's advent, sufferings, and death, were insisted on, to the exclusion of the former; this mode of exhibiting scripture truth would have been almost as defective as the other: but i suppose that, during the earliest years of their labours, the first principles of religion were more frequent and prominent in their instructions, than the doctrines peculiar to the gospel, and that, subsequently, these points received that more frequent attention, which the character, being, and law of god, had formerly obtained.
the school during the week, and chapel on the sabbath, though capable of containing 600 persons, were found too small for those who sought admittance.
in order that as many as possible might hear, directions were given to take down on of the ends of the house; this 271 was soon done; so that those who could not gain admission, were enabled to hear.
the state of affairs in tahiti was such, as to prevent the queen and her sister from proceeding on their intended tour of the island; but while they remained at pare, a circumstance occurred similar to that which had transpired in eimeo, though probably more decisive and important in its immediate result.
at the close of the examination, the children were rewarded by mr. barff, who, on delivering the presents, which were different books in the native language, accompanied each by a suitable remark to the favoured proprietor.

about this time, several of the chiefs of raiatea, &c. and many of their adherents, who had come up in 1811 to assist pomare in the recovery of his government and authority in tahiti, returned to their own islands; not, however, without most earnestly requesting the missionaries to send them teachers and books.

let us seeif you go this week, and bring home a good bundle of cloth, or scissors, or knives, or any thing else worth having, then we will go too; if not, we will have nothing to do with such profitless work.
it is reported here, that there is a ship at morea, and i was thinking it might be the ship with the missionaries; but it may be that it is only an idle report.
idleness has been a most fruitful source of many of their vices and sufferings; and when we have seen the females working with their needle, or with the straw for their bonnets, &c. we could not but deem it an occupation far more conducive to their enjoyment, than indolence, or their former unprofitable and often injurious pastimes.
the removal of oro, the national idol, from pare to atehuru, was the cause of the threatened conflict: ammunition was prepared; a large assembly of chiefs and warriors met at pare; and it was daily– 42 – expected that the long concealed elements of war would there explode, and plunge the nation in anarchy and bloodshed.
but the advantageous and expensive arrangements of the directors, for the purpose of introducing these important branches of commerce and productive labour, although not entirely frustrated, were in the first instance rendered to a great degree unavailing, by the unfounded reports of unprincipled and interested individuals, who beheld the advancement of the people in knowledge and civilization with any other feelings than those of satisfaction.
the uncultivated sides of the mountains, and the low flat sandy parts of the shore, seldom tilled by the natives, were reclaimed by his industry; and many extensive groves of cocoa-nut trees in tahiti and eimeo, which the inhabitants say were planted by pomare, remain as monuments of his patriotism, and yield no small emolument to their present proprietors.
the hand of the almighty was strikingly exhibited,– 108 – in the door thus effectually opened for the preaching of the gospel.
the house had been enclosed with a fence five or six feet high; but this, instead of presenting an obstacle to the gratification of their curiosity, was converted into the means of facilitating it: numbers were constantly seen sitting on the top of the railing; whereby they were able to look over the heads of their companions who were round the windows.
next to idolatry, and the diseases introduced by foreigners, it is the greatest scourge that has ever spread its desolations through their country, and we cannot deprecate in terms too strong; the 291 conduct of those who now visit these shores, and who, insensible to any other consideration than that of avarice or vice, spare no pains to introduce ardent spirits among the people, and promote its use.
i was much affected on giving up myself to missionary pursuits, on leaving england, and on reaching the islands, but i had never so deeply felt the responsibility of my situation, and my insufficiency for the work, as i did on the day when i delivered my first native discourse.
their sabbaths must have presented spectacles on which angels might look down with joy.
although the gospel had been faithfully and constantly preached, for some years in tahiti, occasionally in most of the other islands, and many of the people had imbibed a tolerably clear speculative knowledge of the leading doctrines taught in the sacred volume, yet there was no individual on whom they could look, as having been benefited by their instructionsno one whose mind was savingly enlightened, or whose heart had experienced any moral change.
several of them were some years with only one pair of shoes; and often, in their journeys undertaken for the purpose of preaching, and instructing the natives, they had travelled barefoot.
the whole either smoothed with a carpenter's plane, or polished, according to the practice of the natives, by rubbing the timber with smooth coral and sand.
many of them were arrayed in light european dresses, and all evidently appeared to feel a high degree of satisfaction in assembling for the public adoration of the almighty in a building, in many respects an object of astonishment through the island, and which their own toil and perseverance had enabled them to finish.
no remonstrance was made, no opposition offered they entered the depository of tahiti's former god; the priests and people stood round in silent expectation; even the soldiers paused a moment; and a scene was exhibited, probably strikingly analogous to that which was witnessed in the temple of serapis in alexandria, when the tutelar deity of that city was destroyed by the roman soldiers.
in the mean time, two natives were instructed to perform the most laborious parts; and, before the books were finished, they were able, under proper superintendence, to relieve us from the mechanical labour of press-work,—a department in which, they with others have been ever since employed; receiving regular payment for the same.
this induced in several of the chief women, who had at least one complete english dress, a desire to learn to make them, and ultimately to substitute the european bonnet for the nativetaumata.

her infatuation, as they conceived it to be in this respect, not only encouraged her school-fellows, but, with other circumstances which occurred about the same time, made a considerable impression on the minds of the idolaters, and occasioned some of the priests publicly to declare their conviction that the religion of the foreigners would prevail, in spite of all opposition.
an expensive and sumptuous entertainment of this kind was furnished by the chiefs of eimeo for the queen's sister.
the rafters were bound with braided cord, coloured in native dyes, or covered nearly to the top of the roof with finely woven matting, made of the white bark of the purau, or hibiscus, and often presenting a chequered mixture of opposite colours, by no means unpleasing to the eye.
the king took up the sheet, and having looked first at the paper and then at the types with attentive admiration, handed it to one of his chiefs, and expressed a wish to take another.

the hull was destroyed, but all the stores were preserved.
hitherto, the public worship of god had been performed in one of the apartments of the mission-house, but as it appeared expedient to erect a place for this specific object, to which also the natives might have access for the purpose of religious instruction, a spot was selected near the grave of mr. lewis; and on the 5th of march 1797, with the assistance of a number of pomare's men, they commenced the erection of their chapel.
what the natives thought of it i do not know, but to those who were accustomed to associate with a gallows, and any object so attached to it, only ideas of an execution, or of a criminal hung in irons, its appearance was not adapted to awaken very gratifying feelings.
under these circumstances we acted upon the principles by which our predecessors had invariably regulated their endeavours to teach the inhabitants of tahiti and eimeo; and respecting which, after careful observation, i believe we are unanimous in our conviction that they are the true principles upon which any attempts to instruct a rude untutored people can be prosecuted with a prospect of the greatest ultimate success.

these sensations were often heightened by our beholding, in the neighbourhood of these half-finished houses, the lonely and comfortless hut they had abandoned, and the neatly finished cottage in which the inmates enjoyed a degree of comfort, that, to use their own powerful expression, made them sometimes ready to doubt whether they were the same people who had been contented to inhabit their former dwellings, surrounded by pigs and dogs, and swarms of vermin, while the wind blew over them, and the rain beat upon them.

with many, the influence of a system so inflexible has probably operated powerfully in producing this uniform attention, at least to the outward duties of the sabbath, the only sacred day now recognized amongst them; with others, there is reason to believe it arises from the influence of example, and the respectability it was at this time supposed to impart to individual character; but with many it originates in far higher motives, and is the result of christian principle in regard to what they consider a duty.

our boat being but small, not above eighteen feet long, and her edge, when the sea had been smooth, not more than a foot or eighteen inches above its surface; every wave that broke near, threw its spray over us, and each billow, in striking our little bark, forced part of its foaming waters over the bow or the sides.
the most pleasing results continued also to attend the efforts of the new converts in tahiti.
they are sublime objects of unusual interest, when viewed from the shore; but when beheld at sea, especially if near, and from a small and fragile bark, as we had seen them, it is almost impossible so to divest the mind of a sense of personal danger, as to contemplate with composure their stately movement, or the rapid internal circular eddy of the waters.

patii on this occasion was not prompted by a spirit of daring bravado, but by the conviction of truth, deeply impressed upon his heart, and a desire to undeceive his deluded countrymen; probably considering, that as his conduct and instruction had heretofore done much to extend and propagate the influence of idolatry, so his thus publicly abandoning it, and exposing himself to all the consequences of their dreaded ire, would most effectually weaken their confidence in the gods, and lead them to desire instruction concerning– 113 – that being, who, he was convinced, was the only living and true god,—who was a spirit, and was to be worshipped, not with human or other sacrifices, save those of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, or the sacrifices of thanksgiving and of praise.

this strict observance of the sabbath, especially in regard to the latter points, whereby the tahitian 408 resembled the jewish more perhaps than the christian sabbath, was not directly inculcated by the missionaries, but resulted from the desire of the natives themselves to suspend, during this day, their ordinary avocations, and also from their imitation of the conduct of the missionaries in this respect.

the information, however, which the inhabitants received from the individual whom mr. williams employed to instruct them, not only in its growth, but in the methods of preparing it in the different forms under which it is offered in the markets, was valuable; and though no very advantageous results have hitherto followed, it may hereafter be productive of good.
apaiano, would have been on the one side, and in their rear, and the party from atehuru and papara on the other.
the worship of oro, in themarae here, appears to have been of the most sanguinary kind; human immolation was frequent, and, in addition to the bones and other relics of the former sacrifices, now scattered among the ruins of the temple, there is still a large enclosure, the walls of which are formed entirely of human skulls.

the invaders 36 divided the district, and the priest, taking possession of the eastern side, revelled in all the profligacy and insolence of plunder and destruction.
by the side of these vegetable plates, a small cocoa-nut shell of salt water was placed for each person.

and it is a melancholy fact, that the influence of unprincipled and profligate foreigners has been more fatal to the missionaries, more demoralizing to the natives, more inimical to the introduction of christianity, and more opposed to its establishment, than all the prejudices of the people in favour of idolatry, and all the attachment of the priests to the interests of their gods.
the circumstances of the inhabitants of the windward and leeward islands, most of whom had renounced idolatry, and their earnest desire to receive religious instruction, rendered it exceedingly desirable that the missionaries should no longer remain altogether at papetoai, but establish themselves in the different islands; but the vessel which they had commenced building in 1813, being still unfinished, and the anticipation of a considerable accession to their numbers, induced them to defer forming any new station, until such reinforcement should arrive.

this not only required a considerable addition of personal labour, but a variety of articles that could not be supplied on the islands, and must be obtained through the medium of commerce with port jackson and england; and they could only procure these articles, in a degree equal to that in which they multiplied the productions of the soil, so as to be able to exchange them for the manufactured goods of civilized countries.

discouraging as these circumstances were, the missionaries would not have abandoned their station, but for the destruction with which the civil war, and the defeat of the king, seriously threatened them; and, in addition to this darkened aspect of affairs, as it regarded the success of their enterprise, the state of feeling, bordering on hopeless despair, under which they departed from the islands, greatly augmented their distress.

houses, plantations, districts, and even whole islands, were sometimes presented; still, those who thus received them, never thought of appropriating them to their own use, and excluding their original proprietors, any more than a visitor in england, who should be told by his host to make himself perfectly at home, and to do as he would if he were in his own house, would, from this declaration, think of altering the apartments of the house, or removing from it any part of its furniture.
building houses, and avocations of a similar kind, were regarded as secondary objects; our main efforts were directed to the acquisition of the language.

if dr. carpenter meant that, with these doctrines as parts of a revelation, to the completeness of which they were essential, and in the full declaration of which their own fidelity was to be proved, the missionaries inculcated a belief in one god; he must have known, that the term unitarianism, when used as descriptive of such teaching, was inapplicable to the sentiments of those who have designated themselves unitarians.
in this respect, although the attempt of the directors to introduce extensively its cultivation, has failed in the first instance; the natives have, nevertheless, acquired, from mr. gyles's residence among them, an acquaintance with the process of manufacturing this valuable article of commerce, which, it is presumed, will prove to the nation an important and a permanent advantage.

we were in an excellent harbour, upon whose shores industry and comfort were plainly perceptible; for, in every direction, white cottages, precisely english, were seen peeping from amongst the rich foliage, which every where clothes the lowland in these islands.
he was present, surrounded by not fewer than seven thousand of his subjects, when it was for the first time appropriated to the sacred purpose for which it had been built, and his feelings on that occasion were, no doubt, of a superior and delightful kindvery different from those of his predecessors in the government of tahiti, and especially of his father, who, when the missionaries built their little chapel at matavai, for which he had furnished the timber, sent a large fish, requesting it might be suspended in the temple of the god of britain, that he might share his favour, and secure his aid, as well as that of the gods of tahiti.
the missionaries, however, have not, in any degree, introduced the love of finery; they found it there, and cannot be supposed to have produced any change for the worse, in the taste of a people, by whom a black coat fringed round the edge with red feathers was considered a suitable dress even for a high-priest.
the ornament on the rafter terminated in a graceful fringe or bunch of tassels.
i have often heard with pleasure, as i have passed the sabbath-schools rather earlier perhaps than usual, the praises of the saviour sung by between three and four hundred juvenile voices, who were thus concluding their morning exercise.
in every place they were welcomed and entertained with hospitality.
their increased acquaintance with the people had awakened their deepest commiseration, when they beheld them, not only wholly given to idolatry, and mad after their idols, but sunk to the lowest state of moral degradation and consequent wretchedness.
at the openings of several of the little glens which surround it, the cottages of the natives are seen through the luxuriant foliage of thepandanus, or the purau; while the cultivated plantations in various parts extend from the margin of the sea to the foot of the mountains.
for a number of sabbaths after our arrival, but few of the inhabitants assembled for public worship, and the schools were very thinly attended.
this district had formerly been distinguished for the turbulent and warlike dispositions of its inhabitants, and the ardour of their zeal in the service of their idolsthe magnitude of the idol templesthe sanguinary character of their worshipand the presence of oro, the war-god of the south sea islanders.
sometimes they said, we will hear our own gods; at other times they scoffingly asked the missionaries, if the people of matavai had attended to their word; if the king, or any of his family, had cast away oro; declaring, that when the king and chiefs heard the word of jehovah, then they would also.
the worship of oro, in themarae here, appears to have been of the most sanguinary kind; human immolation was frequent, and, in addition to the bones and other relics of the former sacrifices, now scattered among the ruins of the temple, there is still a large enclosure, the walls of which are formed entirely of human skulls.
next to this, ribands of native cloth, dyed with showy colours, were employed; while others used a string of the bark from a branch of thepurau, with the outer rind scraped off, the inner bark washed and bleached, passed round the bonnet, and tied under the chin.

on reaching atehuru, they found the rebels had taken refuge in their pare or natural fortress, about four miles and a half from the beach.
numbers of the vanquished fled to eimeo, where they were received by the king, or protected by the chiefs, who had taken no part whatever in the wars that were now desolating tahiti, and who determined to observe the strictest neutrality; or, if they acted at all, to do so only on the defensive, should invasion be attempted.
we were, however, sufficiently encouraged to recommend the people, notwithstanding their disappointment in regard to the cotton, to direct their attention to the culture of sugar, since they had no longer any cause to doubt the practicability of procuring, from their respective plantations, sugar for their own use, or for barter with shipping.
several of the natives now came forward, and expressed their pity for the missionaries, gave them a few strips of cloth, and, at their request, – 26 – conducted them to pomare and idia, whose tent was at some distance.
the circumstances of his death were truly affecting, and the feelings of the missionaries such as it would be in vain to attempt to describe.
they had stocked it with cocoa-nuts, oranges, limes, and citrons, of which, not fewer than six hundred plants, with other productions, were growing remarkably well.
as it appeared improbable that the place could be attacked with advantage to the assailants, and equally improbable that its occupants would accept any terms of capitulation that the king would offer, captain bishop returned to matavai, and on the day following pomare sailed about twelve miles towards pare.
i never heard them complain of the heat; and the cause of their apparent insensibility to its oppressive influence is probably to be found in their being early exposed, and constantly habituated, to the climate.
so many teachers, so many books, the whole of the bible in their language, and no idolatry, they must have little else to do but to praise god.
they justly inferred, that, unless habits of industry were introduced, and civilization promoted, the people, if they did not absolutely return to all the absurdities, superstition, and cruelty of paganism, would develop but partially the genius and spirit of christianity, and exercise very imperfectly its practical virtues.
i have frequently seen thirty or forty canoes from distant parts of eimeo, or from some other island, lying along the beach; in each of which, five or six persons had arrived, whose only errand was to procure copies of the scriptures.
the regularly framed and plastered chapels in huahine and raiatea were the first of the kind in the leeward or windward islands; they were not, however, the only large buildings erected for public worship.
were the resources of those societies formed for the universal diffusion of education, and the means of the british and foreign bible society such as to enable them to undertake entirely the instruction of the heathen, and the translation and circulation of the scriptures, it would greatly facilitate the extension of christianity.
we were robbed by an english servant, whom we had taken from port jackson, of linen and clothing; but, although we had no lock, and for a long time no bolt on our door, (which, when fastened, a native could at any time have opened, by putting his hand through the sticks and pushing back the bolt, and though sometimes the door was left open all night,)yet we do not know that one single article was stolen from us by the natives, during the eighteen months we resided among them.
they were designed to stimulate the men who were drawing the canoes into the water.
flour is, consequently, now only to be obtained from vessels visiting the islands.
every face was directed to the preacher, and each countenance strongly marked with sincerity and pleasure.
it was supposed by the people, that his illness and death 65 were occasioned by the incantations of metia, a priest of oro, a famous wrestler and sorcerer, whose influence, ceremonies, and prayers, had induced the evil spirits to enter into the young prince, and destroy him.
one end of the building was used by the inhabitants for divine service every sabbath; the other parts are only occupied at the annual meetings of the tahitian missionary society, or on similar occasions, when large national assemblies are convened.
he did not pretend to know much, but he knew that he was a sinner, and that jesus christ came into the world to save sinners, and this knowledge removed from his mind the fear of death.
we have always been accustomed to have our usual beverage prepared in the morning and afternoon; but this is the only purpose for which, in ordinary seasons, a fire has ever been lighted for any of the missionary families; and when destitute of these articles, which in the earlier periods of the mission was often the case, no fire was lighted on the sabbath; their food was invariably dressed on the preceding day, and the warmth of the climate prevented their requiring fire for any other purpose.
the priest, or friends, may wish to see me, but it is under very different circumstances from what your message would imply: i know a ceremony approaches, that a human victim is then to be offered—something within tells me i am to be that victim, and your appearance and your message confirms my conviction.
these instances are, i believe, very rare, and absolute necessity alone can warrant recourse to such a plan.
when returning from the sandwich islands on board the ship russell, in 1825, we experienced a happy deliverance from one of these wonderful and alarming objects.
on the 2nd of december, in the same year, mui, one of the early scholars, and one whose name had been written among the first that professed christianity, departed to the world of spirits, under the consolation that pure religion imparts in the hour of death.
in addition to the printed specimens, they had a small vocabulary, compiled by one of the officers of the mutineers in the bounty, who had resided some months in tahiti, prior to the arrival of the pandora; when he was arrested, and brought a prisoner to england, where he was executed at portsmouth.
the regularly framed and plastered chapels in huahine and raiatea were the first of the kind in the leeward or windward islands; they were not, however, the only large buildings erected for public worship.
pomare was left a widower and childless, all the children of the late queen having been destroyed.
the accounts given by the missionaries, on my first arrival, and the many interesting facts which subsequently came to my knowledge, when i had 176 acquired such an acquaintance with the language of the people, as to be able to pursue my inquiries among them, have made an impression on my own mind that will never be effaced, and not only excited the highest delight, but convinced me, that, in the circumstances under which the change occurred, the agency by which it was accomplished, and the continuance of its effects, it is altogether one of the most remarkable displays of divine power that has occurred in the history of mankind, and is, perhaps, unparalleled since the days of the apostles.
on the northern side of the valley, and near the foot of matoereere, we proposed to erect our dwelling and the printing-house.
although the light hats, made with a fine sort of grass, or the bark of a tree, are, in our estimation, remarkably well adapted to the climate, most of the men, making any pretensions to respectability, strive to possess an english hat.
when, however, they saw one of the seamen, who had landed with the captain from the ship, take hold of the halter that was on his neck, they returned, to gratify their curiosity.
in some places, the persecutions were so inveterate as to produce remonstrances, even from several of the inferior chiefs, who were themselves idolaters.

we hope they will follow the plastered cottage, just as that now occupies the place of the native hut.
i have often heard the young man's mother-in-law, and other members of the household, speak of this discourse as having deeply impressed their minds.
then with what augmented joy must that honoured and distinguished saint,39 in strict obedience to whose last bequest and dying charge the south sea mission was attempted, with those holy and devoted men who first matured, and subsequently aided so nobly, the plan of sending the 161 gospel to tahiti, have viewed the pleasing change.
the danger now appeared more imminent, and a watery grave every moment more probable; yet there was leisure afforded for reflection, and the sensibilities and powers of the mind were roused to an unusual state of excitement by the conflicting elements on every side.
– 5 – on the 7th of march, 1797, the missionaries went on shore, and were met on the beach by the late pomare and his queen, then called otoo and tetua; by them they were kindly welcomed, as well as by paitia, an aged chief of the district.

in some, we imagined we could trace the spiral motion of the water as it was drawn to the clouds, which were every moment augmenting their portentous darkness.
on the 23d of november, the missionaries heard that he had died on the preceding evening.
on one occasion, mr. nott, returning from a visit to the king, was resting in a – 83 – native house, when a party of the rebels approached the spot; his native companion, one of pomare's warriors, observing them, touched him on the shoulder, and urged him to fly to the canoe lying on the beach: he and his fellow-traveller had scarcely pushed off from the shore, when the men came up, and, finding they had escaped, invited them to land, or requested the native to allow the foreigner to walk.
the impression which the intelligence of these events produced upon their minds, was that of mingled admiration, gratitude, and hope, to a degree that may be better imagined than expressed.
the chiefs of the district, and island, soon visited us, received a few articles as presents, and appeared highly gratified with what they saw, especially with some engravings of natural history.
on the left-hand, about two hundred girls were arranged in the same manner.

he instantly rose to the surface; and, snorting, as if glad, even under these circumstances, to gain his freedom, swam towards the shore; but the natives no sooner saw him at liberty, than they plunged into the water, and followed like a shoal of sharks or porpoises after him.
after this period, it was only shewn by those who were actuated by a desire to obtain the favour of their superiors.
he exchanged inviting prospects of wealth, comfort, and usefulness at home, for the toil and self-denial inseparable from such an attempt.

mr. and mrs. bicknell, the first who arrived, resided some time in the same house with him.
the captain lowered down the boat; the king shouting, directed the natives to leave the horse to himself; but– 199 – his voice was lost amid the din and clamour of the crowds that accompanied the exhausted and frightened animal to the land.
altogether, the building was finished in a manner highly creditable to their public spirit, skill, and industry.
yet the disappointment which the natives had experienced prevented their cultivating the cotton; and but little was available for the establishment, excepting that subscribed by the members of the native missionary societies: the people declined coming to learn, and prospects were most unpromising.
three weeks afterwards, he intimated to his companions his intention of uniting in marriage with a native of the island, solemnly purposing to abide faithful towards her until death.
the letters of each word constitute the word, so that a person pronouncing the letters used in spelling a word, would, in fact, pronounce the word itself.
the principal and largest is to the left, viewing them from seaward; in this, and extending up the valley, the village is situated.
these habits, so perfectly congenial to their 278 uncultivated minds, to the fugitive manner of life, mirthful disposition, and rude state of society that prevailed among the islanders, appeared one of the most formidable barriers to their receiving our instructions, imbibing the spirit and exhibiting the moral influence of religion, and advancing in civilization.
to them it was peculiarly so; for we may naturally suppose, the recollection of the individuals whom many of them had perhaps poisoned, murdered without provocation, slain in battle, or killed for sacrifice, would on these occasions forcibly recur to their minds; and at these times, many a parent's heart must have been rent with anguish, to us inconceivable, at the remembrance of those children in whose blood their hands had been imbrued.
they were astonished at themselves, and were a wonder to all who beheld them.
here they were hospitably received by the chiefs and people.
he was one of those missionaries that arrived in the ship duff; he had borne “the heat and burden of the day,” and finished his course on the 25th of september, 1807.
proud of their triumph, insolent in crime, and impatient of control, the atehuruans and natives of papara quarrelled with the taiarabuans, who had joined them in destroying the porionu.
one of the king's orators, a short, plump, round-faced man, about fifty years of age, was perched upon a projecting rock by the sea-side, vociferating one of their ude, or songs, on the launching of their own large canoes, suiting the action to the word, and using at times the most violent gesticulations, as if he imagined his own muscular powers alone were– 241 – to move the vessel.
the spaces between the posts, excepting those for doors or windows, were filled with a kind of hurdle-work, or wattling of small rods or sticks, of the toughcasuarina.
the heat of the sun, and the oppressiveness of the atmosphere, with the labour of rowing with their paddles our heavily laden canoes every inch of the way, had so fatigued our men, that when we reached a-ti-ma-ha, fifteen miles from the place whence we started in the morning, we deemed in expedient to land for the night.
in the front of the line, auna, upaparu, hitote, and others equally distinguished for their steady adherence to the system they had adopted, took their station on this occasion, and shewed their readiness to lay down their lives rather than relinquish the christian faith, and the privileges it conferred.
on one of these occasions, mr. nott was reading the first portions of the gospel of st. john to a number of the natives.
many soon learned to sew the sheets together, others cut pieces of wood very thin, instead of pasteboard, which were fastened to the sides; the edges of the leaves were then cut with a knife; and the book used in this state daily, while the owner was searching for a skin or a piece of leather, with which to cover it for more effectual preservation.
the missionaries and their friends also attended.
the inhabitants of the islands knew that many of the supplies which the families from time to time received, were sent by their friends in england, and procured by the voluntary contributions of those there, who had first sent, and subsequently maintained, the mission; and it was thought that it would be better that their contributions towards the support of christianity, should be combined with those of the contributors to the missionary society; that the supplies for the teachers might still be drawn from this source, while at the same time the natives would be contributing towards the support of their own instructors, and yet identifying themselves with british christians in their efforts to propagate christianity throughout the world.
we enjoyed a most delightful sail along the northern part of eimeo the next morning, and soon after twelve o'clock anchored in the spacious and charming bay of opunohu, or, as it is usually called by foreigners, the harbour to taloo.
on such occasions, and they were not infrequent, the contrast between the country and the inhabitants must have been most affecting, appearing as if the demons of darkness had lighted up infernal fires, even in the bowers of paradise.
the first sheet of st. luke's gospel was nearly printed, when the active, with six missionaries from england, arrived.
they had established among themselves a meeting for prayer, which they held on the sabbath, and often assembled at other times for social worship.
anxious to avoid unnecessary expenditure of those funds which british benevolence furnished, they had on a former occasion written, to prevent the society's incurring and further expense on their account, as their remaining on the island was uncertain; but now, as there was a prospect of peaceable continuance, and the liberal supply they had taken out in the duff, being, by plunder, presents, &c. nearly expended, they found it necessary to solicit a few articles for their own use, and others for presents to the chiefs, whom they described as daily visiting their dwellings, and treating them with kindness.
mai, the king or chief of borabora, who was alos at huahine, had before written to the missionaries, reminding them that jesus christ and his apostles did not confine themselves to one place, but visited different parts, that as many as could might receive their instructions.
we usually found them either reading together, conversing on the contents of their books, or some other religious subject.
some employed the long filaments of the dried plantain-stalk; and others split the thin bark of thepurau into fine threads or fibres, and, though not equal in strength to the twisted thread, both answered remarkably well.
instruction itself will be undervalued; it can never be attempted but on a very limited scale, and will be always liable to vexatious interruptions.
most of the rivers or streams rise in the mountainous parts, and though, from the peculiar structure of these parts, and the circumscribed extent of the islands, the distance from their source to their union with the sea is short; yet the body of water is often – 333 – considerable, and the uneven ground through which they have cut their way, the rocky projections that frequently divide the streams, and the falls that occur between the interior and the shore, cause the rivers to impart a charming freshness, vivacity, and splendour to the inland scenery.
the stations have also been hitherto but indifferently supplied with a far more useful appendage to their places of public worship than even a dial, namely, a bell.
and it is a melancholy fact, that the influence of unprincipled and profligate foreigners has been more fatal to the missionaries, more demoralizing to the natives, more inimical to the introduction of christianity, and more opposed to its establishment, than all the prejudices of the people in favour of idolatry, and all the attachment of the priests to the interests of their gods.
many of the pupils being adults, had other engagements.
the exercises of the day were highly interesting both to the missionaries and their little band of followers.
it was then much more compact, and the width better proportioned than it now appeared.
the boys afterwards delivered public addresses.
they are made entirely by the females, who manufacture not only for themselves, their husbands, and their children, but, in some of the stations, several have formed themselves into a kind of society, for the purpose of making bonnets for the poor and the aged, who are unable to make for themselves.
water and wood were at all times procured with facility from the adjacent shore; and supplies of stock, poultry, and vegetables might generally be obtained by barter with the inhabitants.
the missionaries resumed their attempts to instruct the natives, but found the acquisition of the language so difficult, and the insensibility of the people so great, that they were exceedingly discouraged.
it is impossible to conceive the emotions of 409 delight produced by witnessing six or eight hundred natives assembling at this hour in the respective chapels, and, on entering, to see a native, one who was perhaps formerly a warrior or areoi, or even an idolatrous priest, stand up, and read a psalm or hymn, which the congregation rise, and sing.
the effect of this magnificent scene has often been heightened by the impression that the voyagers, whose approaching bark became every moment more conspicuous among the surrounding– 233 – objects, were not coming in search of pearls or gems, but the more valuable treasure contained in the sacred scriptures, deemed by them “more precious than gold, yea, than much fine gold.”
in these houses the people took their meals, sitting in circles on the grass-spread floor.
mahine on this occasion wore a curious helmet, covered on the outside with plates of the beautifully spotted cowrie, or tiger shell, so abundant in the islands; and ornamented with a plume of the tropic, or man-of-war bird's feathers.
his directions were attended to; no individual was injured, no fence broken down, no house burned, no article of property taken.
it was intended to employ the vessel in the pearl-fishery, among the paumotu islands– 240 – to the eastward; to work her with native seamen, to take the pearls, and mother-of-pearl shell, to port jackson; bringing from that settlement tools, cutlery, and manufactured goods for the natives, and supplies for the mission; thus providing a means of stimulating the people to habits of industry, and defraying to a certain degree the expenses of the mission.
the natives abandoned themselves to despair, and either threw themselves along in the bottom of the boat, or sat crouching on the keel, with their faces downwards, and their eyes covered with their hands.
i have heard several wish they could remove from their bodies the marks tataued upon them, but these figures remain too deeply fixed to be obliterated, and perpetually remind them of what they once were.

the first night he passed on shore, he slept on the earthen floor, by the side of a warrior, the murder of the crew of the boyd, and a cannibal; and the spot on which he lay was encircled by native spears fixed in the ground.
others, however, occupy lands which are at some distance; and even those who have erected their dwellings near the residence of their teacher, having plantations situated in a remote district, are often absent for several days together.
under these circumstances,– 77 – their distresses were somewhat relieved by the arrival of mr. warner; who, after the ordinary preparation, had been sent from england in the capacity of surgeon to the mission, which he joined on the 12th of may, 1807.
at first we perceived a great inclination to drowsiness, especially during the afternoon: at this we were not surprised, when we recollected that this was the manner in which they were accustomed to spend several hours every day, and that they were also unaccustomed to fixedness of attention, or exercise of thought on a particular subject, for any length of time.
although that idol was now in 58 the hands of his enemies, yet, as his errand was of a sacred character, the atehuruans, notwithstanding they would not admit him to the temple, allowed him to present his offerings, which he deposited on a part of the beach near the temple, and peaceably retired.
the account of the settlement given by the former, and the emotions excited in his own mind by his visit, are so interesting, that i think it would be almost unjust to deprive the readers of these pages of the satisfaction his description is adapted to afford.
the service, therefore, necessarily devolved on those who were willing, under every accompanying disadvantage, to undertake it.
sometimes they procured the tough skin of a large dog, or an old goat, with long shaggy matted hair and beard attached to it, or the thin skin of a wild kitten taken in the mountains.
the impetuous attack of the idolaters, attended with all the fury, imprecations, and boasting shouts practised by the savage when rushing to the onset, produced by its shock a temporary confusion in the advanced guard of the christian army: some were slain, others wounded, and upaparu, one of pomare's– 149 – leading men, saved his life only by rushing into the sea, and leaving part of his dress in the hands of the antagonis33 with whom he had grappled.
when the missionaries heard the natives make use of a word or sentence with which they were not already acquainted, they wrote it down, and repeated distinctly several times what they had written.
among the last number was taaroarii, the young chief of huahine and sir charles 107 sanders' island, and matapuupuu, a principal areoi, and chief priest of huahine, who had long been one of the main pillars of idolatry in the island to which he belonged.
it was a rude, unsightly machine, yet it answered but too well the purpose for which it was made.
it had excited among all classes the liveliest interest, called forth splendid efforts of sacred eloquence, and noble deeds of christian benevolence; but, painful and deeply humiliating as it was, it now appeared to those devoted servants of god, who had, amidst protracted and severe privations, maintained their ground till life was no longer secureafter having engaged the prayers of the people of god, and waited in vain for the results of patient and self-denying toil, during twelve eventful yearsthat the scene of their labour must be abandoned.
subsequently, when they entered into its design, and began to consider that it would become a source of pecuniary advantage, although it was thought that eimeo would be most eligible for its establishment, the chiefs of pare and the adjoining districts refused to allow the machinery to be removed.
the numbers employed rendered these allotments but small, seldom more than three of six feet in length, devolving on one or two families.
it was worn on the forehead immediately below the hair, and fastened by a narrow leaflet passing round the back of the head above each of the ears, leaving the whole of the back and upper part of the head entirely exposed.
an excitement, highly beneficial in – 262 – its tendency, was awakened in the minds of the people; who, influenced by the example and advice of their friends from eimeo, attended in great numbers daily at the schools, and were seen in the chapel, not only on the sabbath, but whenever it was open for public worship.
our mode of saluting by merely shaking hands, they consider remarkably cold and formal.
to us this was a most welcome sound, indicating our approach to the land.
otu, called pomare since his father's death, has often, during the latter years of his life, told mr. nott, that after the departure of the duff, frequently, when he has been carried on men's shoulders round the– 29 – residence of the missionaries, peter the swede, who has been with him, has said, when the missionaries were kneeling down in prayer, at their morning or evening family worship, “see they are all down on their knees, quite defenceless; how easily your people might rush upon them, and kill them all, and then their property would be yours.”
he stood transfixed as it were to the earth, till the native retired; when he bowed his knees, and, screened from human observation by the verdant shrubs, offered up, under the canopy of heaven, his grateful adoration to the most high, under all the melting of soul, and the excitement of spirit, which the unprecedented, unexpected, though long-desired events of the morning had inspired.
we were desirous to induce some of the chiefs to attempt the erection of a stone house; but they had no proper tools for preparing the stone, and the labour was also greater than in their present state of civilization they were disposed to undertake.
this circumstance, though insignificant, is interesting and important.
the conduct and conversation of pomare in reference to the gods, on this and similar occasions, must necessarily have weakened the influence of idolatry on the minds of those by those by whom he was attended; and if it produced no immediate and salutary effect on them, it doubtless confirmed his own belief in the vanity of idols, and the folly of indulging either hope or fear respecting them.
we procured cocoa-nut oil, and when it grew dark, breaking a cocoa-nut in half, took one end, and winding a little cotton-wool round the thin stalk of the leaflet of the tree, fixed it erect in the kernel of the nut.
all the missionaries remained at matavai, excepting one, who accompanied captain bishop as surgeon.
by the latter, the natives of the pearl islands were formerly regarded with the greatest contempt, astaehae and maua, savages and barbarians.

the word of god does grow in tahiti, and the raatiras are diligent about setting up houses for worship, they are also diligent in seeking instruction, and now it is well with tahiti.
the lower hills, at the time of our arrival, were clothed with verdure, and the mountains in the centre of the island, whose summits appeared to penetrate the clouds, were often entirely covered with trees.
they proceeded to their destination, but had scarcely commenced their pearl-fishing, when the natives attacked the crew, barbarously murdered the first and second officers, who were men of fine stature and benevolent dispositions; and killing one of the seamen, took possession of the ship.
the sail ropes were again fastened, and we pursued our way under the influence of thankfulness for the deliverance we had experienced.
i have seen many who had written out the whole of the spelling-book on sheets of writing paper; and others who, unable to procure paper, had prepared pieces of native cloth with great care, and then, with a reed immersed in red or purple native dye, had written out the alphabet, spelling, and reading lessons, on these pieces of cloth, made with the bark of a tree.
cannibalism, though some deny its having been practised among themselves, is supposed to have existed in one of the islands at least, and is known, and universally acknowledged to prevail among those by which they are surrounded; and it is not considered by them improbable that some of their own countrymen have been eaten by the islanders among whom they have, from stress of weather, been cast.
the nautilus had touched at the sandwich islands, and had brought away some of the natives: while the vessel remained, five of these absconded; one was brought back, but escaped again.

if you think proper, you may burn them all in the fire; or, if you like, send them to your country, for the inspection of the people of europe, that they may satisfy their curiosity, and know tahiti's foolish gods!
schools were built, and places for public worship erected; the sabbath was observed; divine service performed; child-murder, and the gross abominations of idolatry, were discontinued.
the erection of a house upon the improved plan, regulating its size by the rank or means of the family for whom it was designed, became a kind of test of sincerity in professions of desire to be instructed; for, to embrace christianity, with the precepts which it inculcated, nothing could be more at variance than the habits of indolence and unsightly filthiness of their former habitations.
it is true, there was no missionary to preach the gospel to them, or to lead their public service, yet it was performed with earnestness, propriety, and devotional feeling.
no sooner did these deluded, polluted, and cruel people, receive the gospel of christ, the elevated sentiments, sacred purity, and humane tendency of which, convinced them that it must have originated in a source as opposite to that whence idolatry had sprung, as light is to darkness, than the spell in which they had been for ages bound was dissolved, and the chains of their captivity were burst asunder.
the information, however, which the inhabitants received from the individual whom mr. williams employed to instruct them, not only in its growth, but in the methods of preparing it in the different forms under which it is offered in the markets, was valuable; and though no very advantageous results have hitherto followed, it may hereafter be productive of good.

a few, including two or three who had been to eimeo, had acquired the elements of reading, or had learned to repeat the lessons in the spelling book, more from memory than acquaintance with spelling and reading; the rest remained nearly in the same state in which they were when visited in 1808 and 1809, excepting that their superstitious ceremonies were discontinued, and they had a building for the worship of the true god.

a settlement thus formed could never possess any approximation to uniformity; yet it frequently seemed to us as if the variety in size and shape among the buildings, and the irregularity of their situation, were in perfect keeping with the wild, untrained luxuriant loveliness, and romantic appearance, of the rocks, the hills, the mountains, the valleys, and every other natural object by which the rising settlement was surrounded.
twilight in the tropics is always shortit soon grew dark; i wished them good night, and afterwards retired to rest, supposing they had gone to sleep at the house of some friend; but, on looking out of my window about daybreak, i saw these five men lying along on the ground on the outside of my house, their only bed being some platted cocoa-nut leaves, and their only covering the large native cloth they usually wear over their shoulders.

– 361 – individuals in england, who have materially contributed by personal exertions or pecuniary aid to the erection or enlargement of a church or chapel, have, when the object of their solicitude and their toil has been accomplished, experienced emotions of satisfaction during the subsequent opportunities they have had of rendering divine homage there; but the satisfaction of the tahitians, though the same in kind, i am disposed to believe, is stronger in degree, when standing on the floor, the trees constituting which, they cut down in the forest—when skreened from the wind by that portion of the wall their own hands reared, and covered by that section of the roof which they had thatched.
