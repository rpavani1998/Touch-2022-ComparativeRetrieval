they are especially susceptible to phytophthera, a common soil-borne fungus that causes root rot in avocado, papaya, citrus, and other susceptible plants.apples prefer slightly acidic and well-drained soils and perform best in full sun.this cultivar yields well and is of high eating quality.the trees will need a complete fertilizer with micronutrients and may need to be defoliated by hand in the fall.formerly grown commercially, it is a good producer, but very susceptible to scab (a disease which only harms the appearance).because flowering, fruit development and spring vegetative growth all occur during some of florida's hottest and driest months (april - june), irrigation is critical for succeeding with apples.avocadoes demand well-drained soils, as flooding for 24-48 hours can kill them.to conserve moisture, mulching is highly recommended as long as mulch is not in contact with the trunk.low chill apples are productive in florida, but susceptible to anthracnose, fire blight, and root fungus.populations are especially high in late fall and, if possible, they should be controlled to prevent spread to newly emerging spring growth.much energy from the sun is needed to annually produce the high numbers of large-seeded and oil-rich fruits.there are different theories about avocado pollination, but recent research seems to demonstrate that self-pollination is the norm, meaning that only one tree is necessary for fruit production.the tree is very productive and cold hardy; dr. price's tree in north ft. myers, fl survived the terrible freeze in 1989 with little damage while a nearby avocado was killed.this variety is prolific, consistently bearing large fruits that mature in the fall.this cultivar is better suited to drier climates- a wet summer can cause the fruit to rot.
