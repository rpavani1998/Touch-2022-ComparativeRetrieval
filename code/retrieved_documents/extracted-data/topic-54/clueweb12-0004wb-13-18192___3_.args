in full sun, the chlorophyll levels can increase and cause the leaves to pick up a green cast and look less variegated.it is not recommended that any hosta be in full sun all the time, but many hostas are more vigorous and display their most vibrant colors if given at least some sun exposure.they all need some sunlight to photosynthesize.spraying the leaves with a pesticide or fertilizer can also cause the waxy coating to melt.hostas with yellow leaves or fragrant flowers can stand more sun than hostas with green, blue or white leaves.the shade tolerant varieties seem to do best in an exposure of morning sun and afternoon shadein general, yellow hostas need to be planted in a sunny location to keep their yellow color vibrant.keep in mind, the heat experienced in a full sun location can vary from area to area and even during different times of the day.too much sun exposure will result in burned leaves, starting from the edges inward.the thicker the leaves, the more tolerant they will be of full sun.similarly, fragrant hostas, those in the species h. plantaginea, need exposure to sun to develop their flowers.special consideration: white hostas another problem with white variegated hostas is that the leaves are white because they have minimal amounts of chlorophyll.in full, hot sun, this waxy coating melts and exposes the green leaf underneath, changing the color of your plant from blue to green.another problem with white variegated hostas is that the leaves are white because they have minimal amounts of chlorophyll.without at least a couple of hours of full sun, the yellow color will fade to green, or worse, look like a green leaf that is yellowing.
