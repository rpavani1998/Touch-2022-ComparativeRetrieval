the more the noon sun is blocked, the leggier and less productive the trees are.

you will only be limited by the length of your season, which means you should try to grow apples that do well in ny.
what's interesting is that for example stone fruits like peaches are much less sensitive, fruiting like crazy in the same locations.
i've not seen any issues with northern spy, mine gets sun from am until about 1pm and is loaded with fruit.
in general, the apples that get morning sun until noon seem to fruit prolifically, whereas the apples that get no morning sun, but afternoon sun seem to fruit a lot less, much more biennially.
so noon time sun seems the most critical.
from the sounds of it, yours is actually under canopy of other trees.
i've found that apples don't like to have overhead canopy of any sorts.
the kor and or are british and french, and i figured since those regions get much less sun (about 30% less) than i do here in ny, my situation may work well for them.
(most winter apples can tolerate short exposures to 20f, the types of frosts that might be common in the fall.)
thanks again for your wisdom and this great community.
cox's orange pippin grows at an orchard close to here (40 min away), and they're ripe early/mid september as well.
who knows what will happen, i remember 1 quote though: "remember, the biggest mistake about planting a fruit tree is not to do it!"

macs off the tree here are very bitter and sour.

for fun, i've attached my climate data as well as orleans france and southampton england, places known to grow these varieties.

its a very odd situation, different native climates between me and england, i get more sun, but im simulating their climate with some shade.
other than that, don't worry about the shade they're getting.
my property is surrounded by oak trees, and i've pushed the envelope by growing fruit trees right up to the canopy.
i have a few scions from yesterday's clippings if you want some, free of charge for you (contact me via pm).

eric, you shouldn't have to worry about what apples you can grow based on the amount of shade your apples are getting.
the sun angle is getting higher and higher now, clearing the trees more and more so it may not have as much of an effect as i'm thinking.
you will only be limited by the length of your season, which means you should try to grow apples that do well in ny.
i also don't think you have to pick varieties from cool climates like england.
however gets dramatically less sun, like 4-5 hours worth a day, mostly late morning to mid afternoon.
my season isnt exceptionally long like yours, but blossoms here are usually 2nd week in may, typically we dont get a strong freeze until around 2nd or 3rd week in november at the earliest.
so in ny you would probably just want to make sure your apples ripen before the onset of extended periods of sub-freezing weather.
i dont think its a crime, because i can go to any orchard and pick/buy them, but i wouldnt anyway.

im in the situation where i get low angle sun thru trees in the morning for about an hour from 9am to about 10am then slight shade until about 10:30am.
that makes me feel a lot better about my situation.
eric, you shouldn't have to worry about what apples you can grow based on the amount of shade your apples are getting.
adjacent is ok, but directly overhead even if only half of the tree is covered is detrimental to any apple tree.
for kidd's orange red there is an orchard about 90 minutes south of me that has it, i've never been there but they record "early october" as the harvest date.

as a whole, i've noticed much more open growth near the oak trees.
i guess you really dont know until you put the tree in the ground.

they're exceptional eaters and superior to macs imo.

let's get some facts straight first, my garden is in central california, not southern california, we get a lot of fog in the hills right above santa cruz, for example my cox orange pippin will get foggy mornings with sun from maybe noon-4pm, after which it's shaded from the oaks.

(most winter apples can tolerate short exposures to 20f, the types of frosts that might be common in the fall.)
since you're in socal, i thought maybe you had some european varieties that would need some shade in your area to make it to harvest without crumbling on the tree.

pm - location: santa cruz mountains - climate zone: sunset 15/usda 9b i seriously doubt you have anything to worry about.
if anything, your apples may even be better quality with the extra chill in the late fall from the extra shade you will get after sept. 21st.
during the peak summer months, i will get about 6 hours of this intense open aired sun.
so if your situation with less sun holds true for me, im looking at a tight harvest every year contending with the first freeze.
i think it gets enough overhead light to really fruit well.
i've found that apples don't like to have overhead canopy of any sorts.
my kidds orange red ripens when expected and it looses sun about 3:30pm.

posted by axel_sc z9b/suns16 (my page) on tue, aug 24, 10 at 19:21 harvestman, my northern spy is not under the oaks, but next to them with east facing sun until 1 or 2pm.
we'll see if "morning sun, afternoon shade" is good enough.
intense sun 10:30 until around 3:30 then again sun thru trees until about 5:30.

i did notice that apples closer to the oaks that provide western shade delay the harvest by about 3-4 weeks.
pm eric, with full sun from 10:30am to 3:30pm i can't see that you would get that much of a delay, if any at all.
i think it's a crime that you don't have a macintosh, given that the best macs come out of ny.
so noon time sun seems the most critical.
what's interesting is that for example stone fruits like peaches are much less sensitive, fruiting like crazy in the same locations.
i only have room in my yard for these 3 trees.

the trees that have that much delay are right next to the oaks, almost under them, so that they get shaded after about 1pm.

let me know if you can expand on your experiences with less than all day sun thanks man, nice work on the site.
