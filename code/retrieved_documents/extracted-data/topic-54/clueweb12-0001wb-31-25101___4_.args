leaf size and number are reduced under heat or light stress, and are easily burned by intense sunlight.the symptom of potassium deficiency is scorching of leaf margins.botrytis and anthracnose can cause rot of leaves and loss of young growth, particularly stems lying on the ground or splashed during irrigation.where summers are hot, bushes will grow better and produce better fruit in heavier soils, which retain more moisture and stay cooler.keep the plants watered all season, since they will not regenerate buds or leaves lost from drought stress.plants collapse quickly when soil or air temperature exceeds 85° f. soil: gooseberry plants are less finicky about soil acidity than most other small fruits, and tolerate a wide range of soils, except those that are waterlogged.plants that have been subject to drought may make a new growth flush after deep irrigation.plants stressed for water are susceptible to mildew.fertilization: gooseberries have a high requirement for potassium and a moderate need for nitrogen, although excessive amounts of nitrogen promote disease, especially mildew.the flowers are self-fertile and pollinated by wind and insects, including bees.roots are susceptible to both oak root fungus (armillaria mellea) and phytophthora.soil: gooseberry plants are less finicky about soil acidity than most other small fruits, and tolerate a wide range of soils, except those that are waterlogged.between four and eight ounces of actual nitrogen per square yard strikes a good balance between growth and disease tolerance.pests and diseases: aphids commonly attack young leaves, distorting them.they are most productive in full sunlight but the leaves sunburn easily under california conditions.
