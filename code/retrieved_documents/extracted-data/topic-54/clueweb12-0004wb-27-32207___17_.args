people with genetic diseases that make them more sensitive to sunlight have a greater chance of developing skin cancer.there is convincing evidence that sunlight causes skin cancer.however, brief intense exposure (intermittent exposure) to strong sunlight appears to increase the risk of malignant melanoma in people who are not used to strong sunlight.studies show that ultraviolet radiation similar to sunlight causes skin cancer in animals.all outdoor workers potentially exposed to the sun's ultraviolet radiation are at risk, including: agricultural workersdarker skinned people have lower risk of sun-induced skin cancer.for squamous cell tumours, high levels of chronic occupational sunlight exposure, especially in the 10 years prior to diagnosis, results in an elevated risk for this cancer in the highest exposure group.for example, intermittent solar exposure may be an important factor leading to the onset of basal cell carcinoma of the skin.brief intense exposure can cause severe sunburn in people who are not accustomed to strong sunlight.http://www.who.int/uv/publications/en/globaluvi.pdf all outdoor workers potentially exposed to the sun's ultraviolet radiation are at risk, including: skin cancer is the result of decades of exposure to the sun.for reasons not completely understood, people with celtic heritage (irish, scottish or northern european) have increased risk of skin cancer from the sun.skin cancer if exposure to sunlight continues for several years, the damaged skin has an increased chance of developing one of the forms of skin cancer.if exposure to sunlight continues for several years, the damaged skin has an increased chance of developing one of the forms of skin cancer.high levels of chronic exposure, such as working outdoors, is more often associated with squamous cell tumours.childhood sun exposure may also play an important part in the development of these cancers later in adult life.
