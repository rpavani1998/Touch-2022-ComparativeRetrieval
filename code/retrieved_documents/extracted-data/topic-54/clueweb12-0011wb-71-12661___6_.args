this is supplemented by close inspection of the trees when watering and by maintaining the tree's general health with proper soil, sunlight, fertilizer, watering and air circulation.insecticides will work for most pests but may be toxic to some trees.these chemicals are potentially carcinogenic (cancer causing) so wear protection and don't allow them to contact your skin, mouth or lungs.pyrethrins (meant for spraying on vegetables) are very safe and work well on aphids, some scale and other insects.miracid has the additional advantage of acidifying the soil, which benefits most plants, especially azaleas (but not junipers.)too much fertilizer may cause excessive growth which may not be the desired effect on refined trees.during the growing season, your trees need proper watering, feeding, and disease and pest control.if you have a sick tree and do not know what's wrong, it's best to take it to an expert bonsaist or nurseryman for advice rather than spraying chemicals indiscriminately.trees that get a lot of sun will actually produce more compact growth with shorter internodes and smaller foliage.a higher nitrogen fertilizer, 25-15-15 will help the leaves in spring, while a higher phosphorus fertilizer is beneficial in autumn for strong root development for the coming year.this will unclog the stomata and discourage some pests.many people use the tree should be well watered before applying liquid fertilizer, or you run the risk of burning the roots.they will need more frequent watering if: the soil drains very well and therefore holds less water; the pot is small; the tree is rootbound; the plant uses a lot of water because of large leaves or stomata that transpire heavily, or because it is in the sun or wind.good drainage helps prevent root-rot.bonsai usually do well with fertilizing regularly from spring to fall.
