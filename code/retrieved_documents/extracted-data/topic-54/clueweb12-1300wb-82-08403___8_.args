moreover, corelli sees a future when growers might plant rows at specific angles, such as a northeast to southwest orientation or northwest to southeast, with trees angled to the east or west, to maximize light interception and photosynthesis while minimizing damage from too much light.in addition, he is studying the interaction of plant stress and the timing of irrigation to learn if fruit size can be influenced by irrigating in the afternoon rather than the morning.previous scientific studies have helped growers understand the importance that light plays in fruit production, said corelli, plant physiologist in the horticultural department of the university of bologna.he is using lakso’s apple thinning model that was developed to help growers factor in weather data, the carbohydrate supply, and the demand of apple trees when deciding how aggressive their chemical thinning efforts should be.corelli, who spent time at cornell university and has collaborated with cornell’s dr. alan lakso on light interception and fruit development, is studying how different aspects of light interception (shading, row orientation, and hail net color) affect fruit production.photo courtesy of university of bologna the worldwide transformation of tree fruit orchards from low to high densities and from wide to narrow canopies marked a major revolution in orchard systems.it’s a nice color because it fits in well with the lake region, but is it the best choice in terms of fruit production?if all goes well, corelli explains, light is used for photosynthesis and carbohydrates are partitioned throughout the plant in the fruit, leaves, trunk and shoots, and roots.one experiment involves using shading as a way to thin the crop load, “shocking” the fruit to make it fall off without chemical thinning.the process that turns light into fruit, is complex and fraught with chances of mistakes.“if we manage this competition properly, you can shift some percentage points in the dry matter partitioning to fruit growth,” he said, adding that growers must understand that on the road of turning light into fruit, the tree can’t make up lost time.corelli also thinks shading could have thinning applications for self-fertile varieties of sweet cherries, though he hasn’t studied cherries.managing competition the process that turns light into fruit, is complex and fraught with chances of mistakes.corelli said the model should help them avoid excessive fruit drop, as well as to know when to remove the nets.italian scientists are also looking at the effects of different hail net colors on other aspects of fruit production.
