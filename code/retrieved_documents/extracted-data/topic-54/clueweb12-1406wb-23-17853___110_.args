a morning jr. solar sprint event, workshops for kids, shuttle buses from neighboring mt. holly, and an evening program will make this a fun and educational event.the fuel burns continuously, making the combustion complete, clean, and quiet.our message to the public today is that electric vehicles are much more efficient, especially in the urban environment.this should make the process much easier and safer.not only is it a fuel cell, but it is also hydride storage, neatly packaged, and inherently safe.often a small amount of moisture or other contamination on the battery modules, connectors or wires can create a leakage path that can get you in trouble.so the idea of having racing cars run on sunlight was not to suggest that it would ever really work for transportation, but to promote solar as a sustainable, and potentially commercial, energy source.but in those smoggy and noisy cities around the world, choking on the exhaust of two-stroke engines, it could be an important part of making them more hospitable for their inhabitants.the drive and battery systems are sealed against the weather and dirt, and maintenance is described as "ultra low".each community has formed a committee to work with nesea to make each stopover exciting & informative.cabin heat is provided by a gasoline or diesel heater where 5 gallons will last about a week and, of course, heat from fuel doesn't reduce the vehicle range.finding these things can be tricky and time consuming, especially if the wiring is messy or too well hidden inside a metal car frame.those with knowledge and experience with cars, fuel systems, or electricity are particularly welcome, as they need many eyes to look all over the vehicles.this has the potential to completely control each of those wheels to the point that one could be braked while the other is powered.there is a tremendous pollution and noise problem with two-stroke engines in the east.
