they have become a part of the family; and their individual characters are as well understood and appreciated as those of the human members.it overshadows these poor people, and assimilates them somehow or other to the character of its natural inhabitants.the native poplars have different shades of green, verging towards yellow, and are very cheerful in the sunshine.they are allowed so many hours and minutes to do their work, and their desire to go as fast as possible, combined with that of keeping their horses in good order, produces about a right medium.these huts are placed beneath the trees, oaks, walnuts, and white-pines, wherever the trunks give them space to stand; and by thus adapting themselves to natural interstices, instead of making new ones, they do not break or disturb the solitude and seclusion of the place.sometimes the same vine had enveloped several shrubs, and caused a strange, tangled confusion, converting all these poor plants to the purpose of its own support, and hindering their growing to their own benefit and convenience.monument mountain and its brethren are green, and the lightness of the tint takes away something from their massiveness and ponderosity, and they respond with livelier effect to the shine and shade of the sky.this gold ore is a pure and wholesome substance, else our mother nature would not devour it so readily, and derive so much nourishment from it, and return such a rich abundance of good grain and roots in requital of it.the land is good, the farms look neat, and the houses comfortable.they  are a very sociable little flower, and dwell close together in communities,--sometimes covering a space no larger than the palm of the hand, but keeping one another in cheerful heart and life,--sometimes they occupy a much larger space.the sunshine is peculiarly genial; and in sheltered places, as on the side of a bank, or of a barn or house, one becomes acquainted and friendly with the sunshine.there is something in this sunny autumnal atmosphere that gives a peculiar effect to laughter and joyous voices,--it makes them infinitely more elastic and gladsome than at other seasons.there is so much wretchedness in the world, that we may safely take the word of any mortal professing to need our assistance; and, even should we be deceived, still the good to ourselves resulting from a kind act is worth more than the trifle by which we purchase it.these winds have strewn our avenue with withered leaves, although the trees still retain some density of foliage, which is now imbrowned or otherwise variegated by autumn.perhaps, if we could penetrate nature's secrets, we should find that what we call weeds are more essential to the well-being of the world than the most precious fruit or grain.
