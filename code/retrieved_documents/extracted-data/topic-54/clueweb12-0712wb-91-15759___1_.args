the miniscule size essentially eliminates any possibility of laptop-based work being done.this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, rather it’s a feature of the beverage and the store, but worth pointing out.what also seems clear in reflection is that london has a preferred drink, and a style, all its own.slightly larger than most of the london coffee destinations i visited, it’s also set up in such a way that the 8 or so tables don’t feel too crowded, and this was an altogether fine place to begin my coffee tasting.a word about the milk: the milk itself was quite impressive, easily the richest milki usually drink my brewed coffee with milk, and was pleased to find that the milk did not overshadow the coffee itself.the flat white was easily 75%+ of what i observed people ordering, although i admittedly observed the action largely in the mornings.while i personally have a negative view of the tradition of bringing a water with your beverage (it implies to me that it will leave a bad taste that requires cleansing the palate), i am a sucker for that type of ritual.reflecting back on my whirlwind tour of london’s top coffee bars, it’s clear that coffee culture in the city is still evolving, as it is in most places around the globe.indeed, the hard wooden benches out front don’t even make working on a mobile phone all that enjoyable.the primacy of the bean was another similarity: most places i visited featured either bins or bags of beans, artfully displayed.i initiated my tasting with a flat white, which i think most visitors from the us would call a latte, and was rewarded with one of the best examples of this beverage i can recall.milk bar seems to rely largely on beans from one of the top-tier british roasters,square mile coffee.it had a depth of flavor i have observed in only the top tier of brewed coffees i’ve tasted, not quite at the level of blue bottle but up there.besides the obvious attention that they pay to their milk, the coffee was quite fine.
