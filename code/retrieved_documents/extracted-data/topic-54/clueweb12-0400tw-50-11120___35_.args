major threats remain to populated areas farther south, even all the way to the coast.the wind has been up above 20 mph, still far less than elsewhere, but threatening some trees and fruit.avocado trees will burn, of course, but they burn rather slowly, because they have thick leathery leaves and healthy avo trees are full of water (as i am reminded every time the monthly water bill comes in).in addition, under this bill, government coverage would displace private health insurance for many children.as that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times.the northern and western sides of mt. ararat are less irrigated and planted, and have a lot of brush.but it has not been nearly as bad for us as for a half million or so others in the county who evacuated, nor for those whose homes were among the hundreds destroyed (and others still threatened).concern about the environment could improve the chances of the green party, which has strong support in cities such as geneva, lausanne and zurich.because fire naturally burns faster uphill than down, it would not even take significant winds for it to advance this way.the rice fire is still mostly un-contained, but is burning now only on the north and east side of fallbrook, mostly in unpopulated areas of the rugged and wild santa margarita river valley (where the first railroad to san diego once ran).winds forecast to pick up again briefly, temperatures could approach 100 today (though the smoke clouds could prevent that much heating) and very low humidity will persist.county emergency officials say this is much worse than the cedar fire of 2003.the santa ana winds–those fierce, drying winds that come mainly the northeast and mainly in fall and winter–blow less strongly here than most of the canyon areas of southern california, because the canyon we are in is one of the few in the area that drains from the southeast and then runs due west.between us and the most at-risk areas, there are not only lots of avocado trees, but also wetlands.overnight humidity got only as high as 21% here, and it was as low as 6% yesterday afternoon.
