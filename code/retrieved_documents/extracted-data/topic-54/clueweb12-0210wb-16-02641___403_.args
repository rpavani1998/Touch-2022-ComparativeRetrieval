like caloric restriction, intermittent fasting reduces oxidative stress, makes the animals more resistant to acute stress in general, reduces blood pressure, reduces blood sugar, improves insulin sensitivity, reduces the incidence of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, and improves cognitive ability.we believe widespread use of this pattern of eating could impact influenza epidemics and other communicable diseases by improving resistance to infection.there is a way to reduce blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce blood pressure, increase hdl levels, get rid of diabetes, live a lot longer, and still be able to lose a little weight.studies have shown that a ketogenic diet helps in the treatment of malignant brain cancers, which makes sense in view of the fact that cancer cells, unlike normal cells which can use fat, glucose and ketones, can use only glucose.there exists a fair amount of data that low-starch diets (and low-carb diets) work to prevent flare ups of all kinds of autoimmune disorders.these calorically restricted (cr) animals have low blood sugar levels, low insulin levels, good insulin sensitivity, low blood pressure and are, in general, much healthier than the ad lib fed animals.these diets are extremely potent therapeutic tools for weight loss and health improvement, but they often require early medication adjustments.in terms of the cold water hormesis would mean that a small dose of cold water would protect one from the damaging effects of a prolonged stay in frigid water.going entirely without food in the short term leads to improvement in health, but also leads to an extremely short life unless the fast is aborted.as i understand it, the reason why alternate fasting is thought to make people live longer and better is because it positively affects the metabolic profile.eating small, healthy meals more frequently continues to keep your appetite under control, and gives you the energy you need to motor through your day.bdnf is neuroprotective against stress and toxic insults to the brain and is somehow–no one yet knows how, exactly–involved in the insulin sensitivity/glucose regulating mechanism.in fact, the preponderance of the data seems to indicate that coffee is protective against diabetes, insulin resistance and all the rest of the so-called diseases of civilization.animals given small doses of gamma radiation are later protected against larger doses of gamma radiation, i.e., they don’t develop cancers at as great a rate as those animals that weren’t given the initial small dose.i enjoy eating now, for the flavor and because i need food to live, and do not feel compulsions to eat, and my desires are geared toward healthy, fresh, nutritiously packed foods.
