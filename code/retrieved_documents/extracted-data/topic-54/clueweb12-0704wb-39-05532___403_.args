trees were the most common target, with burnings and land confiscations, especially land close to settlements, which serve the aim of expanding settlements and providing strategic points for attacks on palestinian residents traveling by road.for most palestinians farmers, the olive harvest is their primary source of income for the year and the price of olive oil has a significant impact on their livelihood for the whole year.its rich soil, water resources and favourable climate produced abundant harvests of olives and vegetables.in palestine, olive trees are valued for their historical presence, their beauty, symbolic connotations, and most importantly for their economic significance.in turn unemployment and poverty rates in the farming-based community have skyrocketed.the most common attacks include violent trespassing on palestinian properties during the night, stone throwing at civilians and their homes, physical assaults on farmers, children and women, destruction of all types of properties, burning civilian structures, crops and trees, shooting livestock, poisoning wells, and theft of crops and cutting fruit trees.the israeli occupation of the west bank and siege of gaza are seriously harming palestinian olive oil production which contributes up to us$100 million annually for some of the most underprivileged palestinian families, the international ngo oxfam said in a report on friday.groups such as oxfam, the palestinian agricultural relief committee, and other social organisations have provided some of the poorest women with small gardens, sheep, rabbits or chickens to tend for food and for income.this is particularly damaging because this year’s olive harvest is expected to yield only half the oil of last year’s harvest, making each tree all the more valuable more farmers.home to around 2,000 people, mainly agricultural workers, the land is rich in olive trees, summer crops and other natural resources.an estimated 10 million olive trees dot the israeli-occupied west bank, thriving in the arid climate and covering 45 percent of all agricultural land in the region.many farmers face restrictions, imposed by the israeli defence forces, on when and where they can harvest due to the proliferation of israeli settlements and outposts.the village of kafr ad-dik, and the greater salfit district, is located on top of the largest water table in the west bank, thus providing it with some of the most fertile land in the region.consequently, the agriculture ministry has placed great importance on planting olive trees and producing quality olive oil products.since al jaba only has about 1000 inhabitants and lacks a hospital, markets, and high school, the restriction of movement means that everyone has to go two to three kilometers by foot in order to do their basic shopping and to reach school, work and healthcare.
