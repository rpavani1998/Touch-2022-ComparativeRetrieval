they grow tall in full sun in these zones outdoors, yet they are ideal as houseplants with warm bright light year round.it will grow new leaves very quickly in warm and humid weather, much slower in colder climates.bananas shriveled to the ground by cold will re-sprout from the underground corm when temperatures warm up.due to weather delays, there may be periodic delays on specific varieties of bananas.fertilize with a mild fertilizer (13-5-13 is ideal) at every watering.a banana plant can grow from 5' to 35' in as little as one year depending on variety and growing environment.you may want to refrain from too much water or fertilizer during these colder months.if you are in a colder region, you may just want to dig up your stump, including some surrounding soil and keep it in a warmer place out of the elements, like a garage, or basement, until warmer weather is near.a good rule of thumb is: if you get less than 1 leaf per week, you are not fertilizing enough!it’s hard to burn a banana with fertilizers.you can start these plants from seeds, but it is a little more difficult and much more time consuming to do.bananas are small to large herbaceous (soft leaved) tree-like plants with leaves held at the top of what appears to be a trunk, but what is actually a tightly woven packed bunch of leaf sheaths and leaf stalks that emerge from an underground stem called a raceme.banana plants and banana seeds also make a marvelous and ingenious gift idea!use organically rich soil, in warm to very warm and humid conditions.folks in the east may even want to consider planting the banana in a moveable pot with a saucer in the first place, keep it as a houseplant, and when it’s warm and humid out, move the plant outside.of course a banana's growth will slow if temperatures drop into the 50's.
