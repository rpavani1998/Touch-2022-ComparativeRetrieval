the principle behind cultural controls is that a healthy plant is far more likely to be able to withstand disease and pest problems than a plant that is under stress.over-crowded plants become stressed trying to compete with neighbouring plants for light, nutrients and moisture and are more susceptible to disease, due to poor air circulation.cultural methods the principle behind cultural controls is that a healthy plant is far more likely to be able to withstand disease and pest problems than a plant that is under stress.weeds and plant debris provide shelter for insect eggs, as well as food for larvae and adult insects that may host a variety of pathogens.shrubs, such as lilacs, benefit from deadheading, because this process will help the plant put more of its energy into growth, rather than seed formation.shrubs are pruned for many reasons, including shaping, reducing size, removal of broken and diseased branches, thinning, rejuvenation and increasing flower and fruit production.shrubs, in general, are easy to grow and have fewer insect and disease problems than many other plants.pruning shrubs are pruned for many reasons, including shaping, reducing size, removal of broken and diseased branches, thinning, rejuvenation and increasing flower and fruit production.common pests, such as aphids, leafminers, caterpillars, beetles, borers or scale may attack, but the viburnum family, is often the most seriously damaged by insects each year.fungal diseases, such as verticillium wilt, anthracnose or cankers can infect dogwoods, and honeysuckles and lilacs are prone to powdery mildew.pests and diseases shrubs, in general, are easy to grow and have fewer insect and disease problems than many other plants.traps may be used for slugs, snails and earwigs physical barriers, such as plant collars, act as deterrents to cutworms biological controls insects have predators, parasites and pathogens as natural enemies.in addition to their growth habit (height, width, form), shrubs are chosen for characteristics, such as: once established, shrubs require very low maintenance.soil amendments such as compost, bonemeal and manure applied in the growing season help to reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.mulching will help reduce the need for watering and weeding.
