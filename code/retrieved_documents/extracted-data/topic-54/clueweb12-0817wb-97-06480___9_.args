the light has nothing to do with it since there is no precise time for dusk and dawn (they change according to seasons).even if it is 10 pm, when you greet someone you greet them with "good evening" and when you leave you say "good night".if you stay up all night long with friends and you find that it is 2 am (or still dark) you can still say "good night".also, we can say good evening when we greet or leave someone.so, it is correct to say "good afternoon" when starting a meeting on 16:00 (or 4:00 pm).i think really, the transition between the latter two can take place at any point between 9-12pm.clearly morning gives way to afternoon at midday.there is very little chance of any presentation beginning so late.however, if you meet someone at 2:00 a.m. to go fishing, it's still "good morning")to 12 pm or 00:00 to 24:00 (5:00 a.m. is 0500)however, if you meet someone at 2:00 a.m. to go fishing, it's still "good morning")to 12 pm or 00:00 to 24:00 (5:00 a.m. is 0500) good afternoon: 12 pm to 6 pm (?)you can also say 'have a good night' to someone who is heading out to do something for the night.so, we can use good night when we greet or leave someone.good afternoon is tricky.the person may say "good night" and look at their watch and laugh and say "or good morning!"good evening -- i'd say that "good evening" can start at 5:00 pm, though yes, generally say "good night" as a goodby.
