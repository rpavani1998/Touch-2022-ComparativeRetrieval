avoid weedy species that become difficult to control in colorado's environmental and social conditions, since chemical herbicides are usually the only effective controls.
add deciduous shade trees to your plan to maximize summer shading and winter solar heating.
consider other plant characteristics that make trees desirable, such as flowers, fruit, fall color of leaves, winter texture in the landscape, exfoliating or colorful bark, branching habit, more than one season of ornamental interest and attractiveness to wildlife and birds.
fast growing trees develop weak wood that splits and breaks easily in storms, as in the snowstorm of september 1995.
on the plan, mark driveways, downspouts, utilities, fences, walkways, overhead lines and obstructions, doors, windows and other glass areas.
use small trees under utility lines and near small buildings.
consider the general shape of the tree at maturity since upright forms can be more appropriate for narrow spaces than spreading types.
when landscaping a home, sketch it and the lot to scale, allowing 1/8 or 1/10 inch per linear foot.
observe the wind and effects of a winter storm on your building.
choose only trees with good branch spacing and trunk taper.
avoid weedy species that become difficult to control in colorado's environmental and social conditions, since chemical herbicides are usually the only effective controls.
choosing a tree consider the normal mature height and spread of trees for your site.
note the direction of winter winds, usually northwest in origin, and add windbreaks of mostly evergreen trees to your plan to block the prevailing wind.
remember that evergreens can provide screening from unsightly views and a sound barrier from traffic and loud noises, as well as wind protection.
leaves, when present, should be evenly spaced along the twigs.

avoid planting spreading trees too close to structures.
selecting ornamental and shade trees for the eastern plains landscaping with trees proper landscaping elements can conserve up to 25% of the energy needed to heat or cool a home or building.
avoid planting trees with weak wood unless used for quick, temporary cover only.
instead, plant evergreens on the north and west sides of your property to slow the prevailing winter winds and save on heating bills.
a single story building surrounded by medium to small trees appears aesthetically pleasing from a design perspective.
notice how the sun strikes the house in the early morning and late afternoon in the summer, and between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. in the winter.
do not purchase trees that have injuries to the bark or with root balls that are loose in the container, or have not been kept moist.
choose trees that are well adapted to colorado's harsh, variable climate.
add man-made structures, like arbors, to provide immediate shade.
use fences, windbreak plantings, and shade trees to provide a sun pocket on the south side of your home, creating a warm spot for outside activities during sunny, cool, but comfortable winter days.
instead, plant evergreens on the north and west sides of your property to slow the prevailing winter winds and save on heating bills.
avoid trees with many upright branches, rather than good horizontal growth.
crabapples, for examples, should be chosen for fire blight resistance.
if fast growing, weak-wooded trees are used, plan to replace them with more suitable species as soon as possible.
avoid trees with visible damage from insects or diseases.
nursery-grown plants are superior to "collected" plants of the same species, since containerized plants are the least risky of all, as compared to b&b stock and bare-root material.

avoid trees with many upright branches, rather than good horizontal growth.
select a reputable colorado nursery or garden center that stocks trees acclimated to our growing conditions.
never top trees to limit growth or control their size.
also, the mature height of trees will determine the location for maximum shading.
using trees, shrubs, vines and man-made structures can modify the climate around any building to reduce heat gains in the summer and heat losses in winter.
keep in mind that large shade trees require large planting areas for the development of healthy root systems and a mature canopy.
these include: soil conditions and ph, available light and exposure, water and adequate drainage, localized weather patterns, terrain and elevation and the presence of a microclimate (a location with climatic conditions different from the surrounding geographic area).
