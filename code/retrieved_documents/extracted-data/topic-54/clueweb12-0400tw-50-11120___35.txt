that would be foolish.
a sweep would be less than a shock.
the santa ana winds–those  fierce, drying winds that come mainly the northeast and mainly in fall and  winter–blow less strongly here than most of the canyon areas of southern  california, because the canyon we are in is one of the few in the area that  drains from the southeast and then runs due west.

the yankees ought to have been 99-63.
we still have had ground-level humidity barely go above 50% at any point in the past week except early saturday morning, when it was briefly in the 80s.
there are also elections for federal senators in some (half?) of the provinces.
it certainly looks as though the liberals fear one.
any time you are doubling up your opponent’s runs on a regular basis, you are doing pretty well.

and there is currently no risk to  any of bonsall.
with winds blowing up till very early morning, it was warm overnight.
(clicking that link will download a kml file.)
this is less fog-like than it was in 2003, when for much of  the first day after the wind settled, we could not see across the canyon.
it was 72 at midnight, and the humidity was only 11%.
the other day, while lying around wondering if we were going to be evacuated or not (can’t do any real work, nor sleep, in such circumstances)
as  more testament to how good the al east is, all the teams except baltimore  actually underplayed their expectations, and baltimore was only 1 game better  than expected.
at the start of play that day the rockies were 76-72, which was three  games worse than their then-expected w-l, or the same deficit of reality from  expectation that they would have at the end.
thanks to the many colleagues, friends, family and those i “know” only because you read this blog for your expressions of concern.
yet the red  sox were a far better road team (45-36) during the season than were the rockies  (a mere 39-42), and the latter team obviously must win at least one game in  boston to have any hope in this series.
because fire naturally burns faster uphill than down, it would not even  take significant winds for it to advance this way.
(by area, if not by population, by far most of bonsall is south of 76, but the only indications of “bonsall” on the thomas bros. maps –the standard map resource in these parts–are on the north side, so the error is easy to make.)
(there has not been a runoff since the current rules replaced an electoral college in 1995, though there should have been once: in 2003, the peronists split and presented several candidates, but the number two candidate, former president carlos menem withdrew, and the runoff was never held.
through such sharing of powers between separate institutions, two (or more) branches are induced to transact with one another, i.e., to exchange and cooperate to accomplish their respective functions.
fortunately, there is the world series to  help get back to normal, and last night it got off to pretty much exactly the  start i expected.
update (3:44 p.m.): now, apparently all of fallbrook is  being evacuated.
is there any chance of a runoff?
i went to the sd emergency website and it showed an order for bonsallnorth of 76.
the humidity is down to 7% and falling.

thanks again for all of your concern!
but there had been the risk that we were being complacent, and there was the instinctive fear of fire and the fear that it was i, and not the emergency operators, who was in error.
instinct tells  me that a fire is a fairly low risk here.
i felt this area was as safe as any semi-rural part of this dangerous county could be, and that’s one of the reasons we chose to move here, rather than fallbrook, coronado hills (san marcos), or harmony grove.

even when the light rain was falling, the humidity was quite low (30% range).
the conservatives currently are about five percentage points ahead, though this is may be overly sensitive to what looks like an outlier near the end of the current sequence.
reverse 9-1-1 was used to issue mandatory  evacuations in the communities ofbonsall, san luis rey heights  and winterwarm on the north side of highway 76.

smoke is visible above the ridges in the right of the photo, but it is very clear here, with the moon visible in a perfectly blue sky.
hamilton elaborates the institutional argument for the veto in federalist 73: the propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights and to absorb the powers of the other departments…; the insufficiency of mere parchment deliniation of the boundaries of each…; and the necessity of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its defense… from these clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of the negative, either absolute or qualified, in the executive, upon the acts of the legislative branches.
they also say the fire currently burning from east of  ramona west to rancho santa fe is highly likely to reach the coast before it  burns out.
it obtained only around 40% of the votes.
and the air quality is  awful, but not as bad as it was tuesday, nor has it been as bad as it was for  two days in 2003.
apparently there remains some theat to downtown  fallbrook from this fire.
just over a month ago, it wasconstitution day, which marked the day, in 1787, of the final meeting of the constitutional convention in philadelphia.
it’s 64 degrees, 31% humidity.
the disaster scenario was now  seeming quite real.
we hadn’t really prepared  for the “finca feline” who came with the property, stays outdoors  other than during freeze or current smoke conditions, and would not even let us  near her for almost four years before finally warming up to us and revealing  what a nice cat she is after all.
so, they were only  3 games above expectation.
there were some low-key celebrations of the event, but most of them were more about patting ourselves on the back that we have such a great constitution.
the most worrisome news up to this point was the  burning of parts of thepala mesa resort, which is about 4.5 miles northeast of  us.
avocado trees will burn, of course, but they burn rather slowly, because they have thick leathery leaves and healthy avo trees are full of water (as i am reminded every time the monthly water bill comes in).
the bad news is that the wind has died down.
the other day, while lying around wondering if we were going to be  evacuated or not (can’t do any real work, nor sleep, in such  circumstances)
it is certainly  better to evacuate unnecessarily than to wait till it might be too late.

in 2005,  the pis was the largest party with 27% of the vote and 155 of the 460 seats.
so, my guess is an election is not coming soon, as harper needs some high-profile defeat to get one, and the other parties like the current situation more than they like the idea of taking a chance on a conservative majority–or even a larger conservative minority (which might be the most likely outcome if an election were held this fall).

however, the premier cannot take office until he and the proposed cabinet obtain a vote of investiture (and, of course, once appointed, the cabinet depends on the ongoing confidence of the lower house).

in that case, they need two wins in boston.
the other main contender is the  civic platform (co), usually described as a “liberal” (in the  european sense) party.

the president has discretion to nominate a candidate to be premier,  and here’s betting he will choose his twin brother.
