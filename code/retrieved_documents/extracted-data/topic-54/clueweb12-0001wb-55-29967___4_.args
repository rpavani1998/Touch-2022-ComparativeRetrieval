annual pruning increases yields and keeps plants manageable.the leaves sunburn readily and the plants collapse quickly when the soil or air temperature exceeds 85° f. currants can withstand ocean winds but the salt air will burn the leaves and turn them ragged.with too much nitrogen the plants become more prone to disease.they are best adapted to usda hardiness zones 3 through 5, although in california they are fairly productive in the coolest parts of the san francisco bay area and coastal northern california.plants stressed for water are susceptible to mildew.botrytis and anthracnose can cause rot of leaves and loss of young growth, usually stems lying on the ground or splashed during irrigation.cultivars are selected for the clarity of juice, size of berry and productivity.it tolerates a wide range of soils, even alkali, and does not require much winter chill.the most feared disease in black (rarely red) currant is reversion virus, and appears as weakened, barren plants with pleated leaves.pests and diseases: currants are subject to a variety of insect and disease pests.currant roots are susceptible to both oak root fungus (armillaria) and phytophthora.irrigation: with their fibrous, shallow roots, currants are are ideal for drip irrigation.native to american prairies, they are extraordinarily hardy bushes and productive.a thick mulch of some organic material also keeps the soil cool in summer while adding humus to the soil.gooseberry mildew infects currants, especially in humid areas, but is not common in california.
