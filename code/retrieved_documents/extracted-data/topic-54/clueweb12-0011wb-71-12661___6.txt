miracid has the additional advantage of acidifying the soil, which benefits most plants, especially azaleas (but not junipers.)
mites are discouraged by washing the foliage when watering the tree.
most evergreens, especially pines, need as many hours of direct sun as possible (in our climate.)

some common insecticide sprays are isotox, sevin, cygon, malathion, etc.
in general, avoid the toxic chemicals if you can because they may contribute to causing cancer or other diseases.

one easy way to water with a hose is to attach a bonsai nozzle (e.g. masakuni, from bonsai vendors) to a brass shut-off valve or a plastic sprayer pistol to turn the water on and off.
an alternative to try is safer spray, a soap solution that kills insects but is relatively non-toxic to humans.
it will also produce larger leaves to increase its sun exposure.
