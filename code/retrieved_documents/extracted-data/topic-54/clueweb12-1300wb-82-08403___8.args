previous scientific studies have helped growers understand the importance that light plays in fruit production, said corelli, plant physiologist in the horticultural department of the university of bologna.
“you’d see one color used for bud break, another color if you want to make shoot growth be shorter, and the top layer may reflect the sky to make the net disappear for environmental impact.”

already, he’s observed that peaches are more sensitive to shading than apples.
“if we manage this competition properly, you can shift some percentage points in the dry matter partitioning to fruit growth,” he said, adding that growers must understand that on the road of turning light into fruit, the tree can’t make up lost time.

moreover, corelli sees a future when growers might plant rows at specific angles, such as a northeast to southwest orientation or northwest to southeast, with trees angled to the east or west, to maximize light interception and photosynthesis while minimizing damage from too much light.
initial research shows that blue hail nets result in more buds breaking than some of the other colors, he said.

in addition, he is studying the interaction of plant stress and the timing of irrigation to learn if fruit size can be influenced by irrigating in the afternoon rather than the morning.

italian scientists are also looking at the effects of different hail net colors on other aspects of fruit production.
“the environmentalists want hail nets to be green, but that is the one color to avoid because it depresses photosynthesis.”
if all goes well, corelli explains, light is used for photosynthesis and carbohydrates are partitioned throughout the plant in the fruit, leaves, trunk and shoots, and roots.

corelli said that some believe that the extensive use of dark gray hail nets in the tourist region is ruining the view.
for example, he noted that fuji apples in the bologna area grow about two grams per day.
corelli said the model should help them avoid excessive fruit drop, as well as to know when to remove the nets.

“we wiped out a peach crop from one week of shading,” he said, noting that three days of shading in peaches can cause fruit drop.
it’s a nice color because it fits in well with the lake region, but is it the best choice in terms of fruit production?

he shared the details of his research projects with an international group of tree fruit growers who visited the university of bologna last fall.
one experiment involves using shading as a way to thin the crop load, “shocking” the fruit to make it fall off without chemical thinning.
however, it took five to seven days of shading to show effects in pink lady and golden delicious apples.

“if you make a mistake with irrigation and it’s off for ten days in a row, you can’t make up that twenty grams unless you remove plant material.

corelli, who spent time at cornell university and has collaborated with cornell’s dr. alan lakso on light interception and fruit development, is studying how different aspects of light interception (shading, row orientation, and hail net color) affect fruit production.
“the orchard today is a highly technological enterprise,” he said, likening the orchardist to a racecar technician who must expertly keep the car at peak performance.
