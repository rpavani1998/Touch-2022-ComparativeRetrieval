i like netbeans 6, as a ruby development ide it is quite simply amazing and though i am an aptana advocate even i have to admit that netbeans does it better.
looks like the same guy’s that worked on the awesome ruby editor functionality have been working on improving the javascript editor this time around.
technorati tags: netbeans 6
one of the downloads available is an early access preview of support for  php.
netbeans 6 is not netbeans 5 with some new bits and bug fixes, this is a whole new development and it shows.
i have not been keeping up so well with this version and so i’m a little out of the loop on all the changes but i understand that they have been working hard on improving the javascript capabilities, from what i can tell this is mostly in the intellisense.
it’s official netbeans 6.1 is now in full release and available for download fromnetbeans.org.

i’ve said before that netbeans 6 is an important release for the netbeans team and i believe it is one of (if not the) best ide’s available for java, ruby and ruby on rails amongst others like the upcoming javafx.
advance versions of new modules, such as a javascript debugger, support of  clearcase, axis, and hibernate are available as separate plugins.
code completion is second to none and the features included are making netbeans the ide of choice for many people and i’m fast becoming one of them.
while i like netbeans 6 and personally i am really happy with it having moved from eclipse, there is, as always, a flip side to every coin so in the interests of balancing things,this post on the java tutorials weblog is asking for votes to bring back the beans module that is missing from netbeans 6.
netbeans ide 6.1 also contains all of the improvements made in 6.0 including: the new smarter editor, next generation of the ground-breaking gui builder (formerly known as project matisse), visual mobile designer, integrated profiler, and java™ ee 5 support.

the official announcement from the netbeans announcement email is: netbeans™ ide 6.1 supports a wide range of open source scripting technologies and offers improved performance.

this is done easily via the package manager, just search for sun jdk ad pick your version.
this release extends language  support beyond java™ technology by providing a rich set of features for  c/c++, javascript™ and the ruby language, including ruby on rails.
pick the number that corresponds to the version you want to use (or accept the current default and that will now become the default java version for ubuntu.
there are some interesting comments made as people place their vote and i’d say the vote is overwhelming and we should be seeing the bean module in the upcoming update to nb6.
this should produce a list of installed java versions and there will be a * by the default one in use.

since 6.1 is supposed to improve javascript in netbeans i shall have to take a look.

technorati tags: netbeans 6 netbeans 6 has finally reached the full release version and is available for download today.
now try sudo update-alternatives –config java in the terminal.
if you are an ubuntu user and you use java you would benefit from some cool tips i’ve found while browsing the ubuntu forums of late.
this release did remind me that i was going to take a look and see if i  could get netbeans to play nice with some of the javascript libraries out there  and i never did, apologies to those who were waiting for me to pull my finger  out.
there’s a handy plugin that will convert eclipse apps over to netbeans – just in case you are worried about switching ;0) picture taken from netbeans anouncement email technorati tags: netbeans 6 netbeans 6 is getting closer to full release, rc1 is available to download fromnetbeans.org today.
unfortunately despite installing sun’s jdk the java system may not be fully utilising it.

advance versions of new modules, such as a javascript debugger, support of clearcase, axis, and hibernate are available as separate plugins.
java -version in a terminal session will show you the current version in use, and this should be the one you installed from the package manager.
netbeans ide 6.1 also contains all of the improvements made in 6.0  including: the new smarter editor, next generation of the ground-breaking gui  builder (formerly known as project matisse), visual mobile designer, integrated  profiler, and java™ ee 5 support.
the detailed feature list can be foundhere.
by default ubuntu comes with a version of java (jgc) that isn’t sun’s.
this can be handy if you want to check your app in different versions of java or develop to a specific version, or even switch to a different version to troubleshoot environment issues you suspect are java related.

i still like aptana’s javascript css and html handling so won’t be giving it up just yet but for ruby, rails and java, netbeans 6 is my tool of choice.
this isn’t a problem unless you are perhaps developing java applications, in that case you might want to install the sun jdk.
reasons why i like netbeans 6: as you may have guessed i have been using eclipse and i have found netbeans so much better.
