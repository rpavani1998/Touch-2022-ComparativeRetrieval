click the + button at the top of the window and select tomcat -> local (or other application server of your choice; i use tomcat server as example in this post) from the pop-up menu.
create run/debug configuration in intellij idea and run the struts 2  project
you should finally see the project structure created as shown below(expand the directories as needed).
you should see the run configuration window which allows you to make  any further configuration changes before the application is run.
jetbrains released intellij idea 8 milestone release 1 a week ago and the  milestone version includes support for struts 2 out-of-the-box(no plugins need  to be installed) so that we can test the functionality right away.
click the run button to run the application.
first read the summary of its current feature list(and what is planned for the future) and have a look at some screenshots.
to test the above installation, see my next post(to be published), “hello, world” java web application using java se 6 + tomcat 5.5 + maven 2.”
at last we have a java ide that ships with struts 2 support built-in: no manual configuring the web applications to add struts 2 support and no more hassles of finding and installing struts 2 plugins.
secondly, it helps in auto-completion: more information on  auto-completion.
install sun’s latest jdk by manually downloading the binaries from  sun’s website.
let us create an example action class in java and a jsp result page to go with it.
when you click finish, intellij idea will start  downloading the required struts 2 jar library files to your project’s lib directory, which may take a few minutes.
download and install apache tomcat web application server: apache tomcat  5.5.
it is at least slightly better than creating and developing struts 2 applications completely manually.
for more details, refer to sun’s instructions on how to install java se.
a java application server/container like tomcat, glassfish, jboss etc.
click the fix button on the far right corner and then click ok.
any loose ends should be tied up by the time the final version is released.
for one thing, the plugin helps in creating template files for struts 2  actions, interceptors, results etc.

create struts 2 action java class and jsp result page and configure  struts.xml file right-click on the src folder, select new -> class and enter hello.
if you get an error saying that the ‘java’ command is not recognised or is not available, then you need to check the values the above environment variables were set to once again.
i hope that intellij idea’s out-of-the-box  struts 2 support will encourage the teams/communities of other popular ides to  follow the suit.
the struts 2 plugin is now installed in netbeans.
in the add jar/folder file chooser dialog box, browse to  the extracted struts 2 directory, go tolib directory in it and select  all the jar files that you want to add to the project.
you can accept the default settings for everything else in the wizard.
but it is at least more beginner friendly than working from the command line using just themaven build tool.
i have tried to make this more beginner friendly by including a lot  of screenshots.
don’t select any frameworks, especially struts 1.2.9, to be  added to the project.
add the struts 2 library files to the web application project:
download/install java se, netbeans and struts 2 download and install the latest version of sun jdk: sun java se 6 update 7 .
verify tomcat’s installation by running the following commands in the windows command prompt:$ echo %java_home% you will need to start and stop the tomcat service from the command line manually(or tools from other java frameworks may do that for you automatically).
if we do all this manually, then what does  the plugin do?
create maven 2 environment variables create a new m2_home environment variable.
you can also opt for the smaller “essential  dependencies only” package if you want to later incrementally add  additional packages as and when the need arises.

even though you may not need all the three components mentioned above to work with every java technology, i found myself installing them way too many times when compared to any other java component that i wanted a place to document the installation process of these three components specifically, if only to refer to this post from other java tutorials.
below i explain how to install java se 6, apache  maven 2 and apache tomcat 5.5 software.
installing openjdk/sun java se 6, apache maven 2 and tomcat 5 on fedora  gnu/linux installing java se 6 you can’t install  sun’s jdk directly from the fedora repositories, you have the following  two choices: use openjdk that comes installed by default in fedora 9(if not, you can  install it with a simple ‘yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk’ command;  or first search for the exact package name using ‘yum search jdk’).
select the path variable in system variables pane and add the path to java bin directory to it.
check maven 2 version and confirm install to check if maven is properly configured or not, start a command prompt and  check its version: $ echo %java_home% c:\program files  (x86)\java\jdk1.6.0_06 $ mvn –version maven version: 2.0.9 java version: 1.6.0_06 for more details, refer to instructions on maven’s website on how to  install maven 2.
select thehelloworld project in  the left pane and go torun -> edit configuration .
don’t select any frameworks, especially struts 1.2.9, to be added to the project.
add struts 2 libraries to web application project in netbeans and  configure web.xml file

to check if maven is properly configured or not, start a command prompt and check its version:$ echo %java_home% for more details, refer to instructions on maven’s website on how to install maven 2.
just run the installer and follow the wizard.
i am not including those instructions here because i don’t run and don’t recommend running it as a service; ymmv.
go through the wizard clicking the button next and  accepting the license agreement and ignoring any errors about invalid signature.
leave the struts.properties file empty for now.
if you get an error saying that the ‘java’ command is not  recognised or is not available, then you need to check the values the above  environment variables were set to once again.

installing apache maven2 apache maven 2 can be  installed using yum command: # yum install maven2 maven version 2.0.4 # yum remove maven2 installing maven 2 on fedora 9 using the yum package manager gave me the  old 2.0.4 version, so i removed it and decided to install maven manually.
this is a big moment for the struts 2 users.
this maps the requests sent to the “/helloworld.action” url tohelloworld.java struts 2 action class, and after the successful  execution of the request, it directs to theindex.jsp result page.
to  manually download and extract maven 2 archive on fedora 9, follow these  instructions: download the latest stable version of apache maven 2 archive from its  download page.
before we can run the application, we first need to create/edit the run  configuration for our project.
it is not yet completely bug free though: it also helps in easy navigation using hyperlinks.
