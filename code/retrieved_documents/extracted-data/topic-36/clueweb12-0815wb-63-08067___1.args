ibm only qualifies for 2 out of 7 points, though nothing beats ibm's stability.
hire the java developers who lost their jobs during the recession.

you get into the situation that salaries are low, yet the company spends a lot of money on it.
give the developers more than water and coffee..

just in case you are seriously looking for good java developers, some hints: - raise the salary (no excuses).
- don't try poor copies of google and ibm ideas, these companies are just richer than yours.
simple fact is: java is stillranking high in the it market, while all that hype revolutions are still hype promises.

they're productivity goes down and the company tries to solve it by hiring consultants, architects and layers of managers.

google does get 5 out of 7.
people in general tends to accomodate and in tech that means not being able to use the productivity tools and concepts developed in recent years.
dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!

well, they will need to accept that java job now, frustrated people mostly unable to delivery a quality service anyway.

these languages advertised revolutions during the last two or three year, sold out a lot of books and conference speeches but nowadays it is not easy to find good jobs (salaries) for such technologies.
people are becoming lazy and dumb, everyday a bit more.
it is time for smart managers to raise the salaries and catch the good ones, the rest can be shared by people reading scrum and kanban manuals.

offer learning as part of the job benefits (conferences, books, courses, etc).
i'm surprised that profit sharing or bonuses were not mentioned.

give the developers some stability and carrier perspective, and don't try that in a bureaucratic way.

the rest will definitely dumb down: shorten attention span, reduce brain power.
the hiring market for java developers cannot be all that tight if employers can be picky enough to specify a dozen different apis, tools and frameworks with which a candidate must also have significant experience.
don't try poor copies of google and ibm ideas, these companies are just richer than yours.
well, the reality is a boring overestimation of the management models, leaving to the developers just the extra hours,tendinitis and more learning curves.

nevertheless, i agree finding average developers is difficult, really good ones are close to impossible.
if necessary, hire the ones who lost their jobs during the dot-com crash or due to out-sourcing.
