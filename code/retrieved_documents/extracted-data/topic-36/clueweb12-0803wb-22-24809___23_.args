it is very well tested and has a great integration with databases and application servers.it is very small, fast, and has many built-in features that help create better code, more efficiently.i am currently working on an enterprise scale distributed web application framework with over 200 source files and about 2 dozen import packages and netbeans has managed the coding and execution of my work perfectly.the user interface is intuitive, and the drag and drop palettes are easy and transparent.it is also fast thanks to advances in hardware and so far has allowed me to easily develop non-gui java applications (programming assignments) for the object oriented programming module that i am currently teaching.code completion, automated javadoc building, automated jar deployment and the astonishing profiler make this the best ide out there for developers working on large projects.i think the main difference between eclipse and netbeans is, that netbeans focuses on providing the very basic functionality for a developer.the automatic integration of frameworks (along with the tutorials) makes acquiring facility with new java technologies relatively easy.by version 4, netbeans was incredibly intuitive, stable and offered good tools for refactoring (the global search and replace features are a godsend) then came version 5, then 5.5.surprisingly, that support is so good that it now compares favourably to more established competitors like eclipse, komodo ide, and zend studio.the fact that netbeans offers a full-fledged ide that runs on multiple platforms is enough in itself.the more users you can reach at these early stages will help with user feedback and to drive future feature development.the fact that it has support for every language you could ever want (or need) to write code in is nearly unprecedented.the built-in example apps are self-explanatory and highly instructive.all in all, with the improvements made to the netbeans editor, the tight integration with maven, and the painless way of setting up a jsf project (essentially, all required code completion and features works "automagically")
