not only that, if you set a preference in one area, it might not be set in another, and may collide with another preference, sometime throwing errors, or shutting down the editor.
when things like this happen, i get pissed, and go looking for new  tools.
in conclusion, because of problems i've had configuring colors with  eclipse, even using theeclipse color theme plugin i wrote about in another  post, i find myself using netbeans to write my code.
i wanted to set up my beloved work environment, back to open-source.
you can have both ide's running at the same time without conflicts.
if your a php developer, netbeans has integrated support for git, debugging, phpunit testing, phpdoc, smarty templates, symfony framework, and the zend framework.
netbeans initial start up screen netbeans is a java application and requires java to run, which is probably already loaded on your computer.
after a preliminary search showed that netbeans had good reviews, i decided to give it a try.
… and pdt seems to have lost the development momentum (i tested it 3 months ago the last time).
it takes you quite a bit of time to initially configure preferences.
that is if you can download it intellij 11 is so awesome, that i have even bought it.
you have a choice to install netbeans  with just the php bundle, which is what i did, since i do not do a lot of java  work.
naturally, i downloaded eclipse pdt based on the helios release, on which zend studio is built.
no… i will certainly not go back to netbeans.
in all fairness to eclipse, i'm comparing this to eclipse helios pdt.
so you don't have to reconfigure then again, you export your preferences and import them to the new eclipse environments.
netbeans main editor window with other windows closed
the installation took about 5 minutes and  netbeans came up quickly and easily.
if you do a feature by feature analysis of eclipse and netbeans, you'll find that both ide's pretty much have the same features and functionality.
i am a long time user of eclipse and ex netbeans user
you'll find several good articles on the web about this, so i won't go into individual features here.
netbeans seems like a new bmw  sports car.
what surprised me was how far netbeans has come as a php development environment.
eclipse is like an old car that you keep fixing up, it's serviceable and runs good, but every once in a while, you get irritated, because something doesn't work right.

the installer downloads  46.6 mb, which grows to 152.5 mb on install.
setting preferences is straightforward and java development support is great.
you can set all colors and  fonts for all languages at once, not like eclipse.
i had tried netbeans before, and found it wanting for php development, but that was four years ago.
by the way… i was netbeans fanatic for a long time then i tried eclipse again
i would recommend eclipse  pdt users uninstall helios, download indigo, and add pdt.
using vi is not archaic, once you know vi.
it takes you quite a bit of time to initially  configure preferences.
since zend studio costs money, as a newbie to my new company, i didn't see  a lot of zend studio's installed.
i'm guessing zend studio preferences have problems with importing to eclipse.
it is my prefered php server.
netbeans for php development.
i did an import of my zend studio preferences and then started changing  some setting, and i had a hiccup.
if eclipse is a house built with a series of additions, netbeans is a house built from the ground up by an architect.
the hiccup was eclipse balked at some  setting i set, and blew away my entire workspace.
i had to  reload everything including re-configuring my preferences.
eclipse + pydev for python (since the python support in netbeans has more ore less been dropped) 2.
i had used eclipse before zend studio, and so this  was pretty close to home.
since php is now an object-oriented language, like java, netbeans has incorporated php into its editor.
the netbeans 7.1 download and install was seamless.
the netbeans license is owned by oracle  from its acquisition of sun, but it is a free and open source ide.
in fact, i saw few ide's.
if both ide's pretty much have the same functionality, what is the difference between the two?
eclipse feels bloated.
netbeans rocks, it has all of php developer needs… and very configurable i feel very much comfortable with netbeans.
you can set all colors and fonts for all languages at once, not like eclipse.
not saying that netbeans can do things that eclipse can’t – the same is true the other way around, but in my experience netbeans just is more intuitive to use.
btw netbeans settings preferences compared to intellij is not so good… i agree only that netbeans is more newbie friendly and you don’t have to know much about classpath and compiling/building to produce a working application.
this seemed a little archaic  to me.
i think you'll like it better, if you stay with eclipse.
by the way, my eclipse  helios folder checks in at 390 mb.
netbeans initial start up screen netbeans is a java application and requires java to run, which is probably  already loaded on your computer.
in the process of configuring eclipse, i, of course, started messing with  preferences.
all the menus and functionality, except for some of the zend studio features, are the same.
but both of these are far from “the best ide”.
i would recommend eclipse pdt users uninstall helios, download indigo, and add pdt.
netbeans seems like a new bmw sports car.
i trialed all the commercial ide’s/editors and so money really wasn’t an issue.
since zend studio costs money, as a newbie to my new company, i didn't see a lot of zend studio's installed.
i wanted to set up my beloved work environment, back to  open-source.
afaik eclipse was also designed with java development in mind.
netbeans is like an editor with a little bit of sophisticated tool calling where eclipse really is an ide.
i think you'll  like it  better, if you stay with eclipse.
the installer downloads 46.6 mb, which grows to 152.5 mb on install.
i had tried netbeans before, and found it  wanting for php development, but that was four years ago.
netbeans feels integrated, not like your bringing up a  separate application every time you go to a new area of the ide.
by the way, my eclipse helios folder checks in at 390 mb.
what that means is setting preferences is a nightmare.
i give you that… for me netbeans is wisely written ide, very intuitive, effective, … i use netbeans for php and the support is awesome.
colors and fonts are configured in one tab, php in another tab.
but: they do *not* use pdt, they use another plugin (phpedit or so..)
naturally, i downloaded eclipse pdt based on the helios release, on which  zend studio is built.
having done php development  full time for many years, zend studio had become my ide of choice.
i downloaded the eclipse indigo 64bit and added the pdt plugin, and i find this version quicker, and much more stable.
one main argument for netbeans against eclipse+pdt: in netbeans you can format the sourcecode (and adapting your coding styles).
it deserved another look.
it deserved  another look.

the feel you get while developing is also not as bloated and “old car” as you say from my perspective – eclipse is slow, too bloated, and clumsy.
i love open source, and my current choice is netbeans, but i’m constantly searching for better and faster native aps (for linux or windows), which are not slow and clumsy as these two
most of the edits were done on a linux server running vim.
i have been using both eclipse and netbeans professionally (java), and when i can choose myself its a nobrainer: netbeans!netbeans do the same things as eclipse – but smoother and with all the stuff you need build in out of the box.
when i try to download.
i downloaded the eclipse indigo 64bit and added the pdt plugin, and i find this  version quicker,  and much more stable.
if you don't like netbeans, you can stay with eclipse, but in the process of using both, i think you'll find yourself gradually moving to netbeans as your ide of choice.
if you do a feature by feature analysis of eclipse and netbeans, you'll  find that both ide's pretty much have the same features and
most of  the edits were done on a linux server running vim.
and i’m certain now i won’t switch back to netbeans.
what that means is  setting preferences is a nightmare.
i thought about good analogies and similes for the two editors.
pingback: netbeans 7.1 review: "eclipse is like an old... | eclipse | syngu i just started developing in php (coming form microsoft/visual studio) and spent quite a bit of time looking for a php ide.
i had used eclipse before zend studio, and so this was pretty close to home.
i've had all of this happen.
anyone who has used eclipse understands what a nightmare the  eclipse preferences are.
or because netbeans was created with java in mind?
for me that was zend studio.
not only that, if you set a  preference in one area, it might not be set in another, and may collide with  another preference, sometime throwing errors, or shutting down the  editor.
you have a choice to install netbeans with just the php bundle, which is what i did, since i do not do a lot of java work.
one major weakness in eclipse is setting preferences on how you want the editor to work.
in eclipse+pdt i can only change the tab-space (at least i did not find anything else).
you can have both  ide's running at the same time without conflicts.
anyone who has used eclipse understands what a nightmare the eclipse preferences are.
because setting preferences is difficult in eclipse?
the netbeans icon why would we gradually move?
the installation took about 5 minutes and netbeans came up quickly and easily.
maybe intellij is next step but certanly not netbeans.
if you don’t want to use vi, use phpstorm.
after a preliminary search showed that netbeans had good reviews,  i decided to give it a try.
the hiccup was eclipse balked at some setting i set, and blew away my entire workspace.

if your a php  developer, netbeans has integrated support for git, debugging, phpunit testing,  phpdoc, smarty templates, symfony framework, and the zend framework.
this seemed a little archaic to me.
each plugin added to eclipse has its own preferences,  every section of eclipse has it own preferences.
well, it comes down to the feel of the ide as your using them.
since php is now an object-oriented language, like java, netbeans has  incorporated php into its editor.
http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3 i can not download netbean’s latest version it says “the requested url /netbeans/7.1/final/bundles/netbeans-7.1-ml-linux.sh was not found on this server.”
if you don't like  netbeans, you can stay with eclipse, but in the process of using both, i think  you'll find yourself gradually moving to netbeans as your ide of choice.
well, it comes down to the feel of the ide as  your using them.
netbeans is the best.
here you can for “format source code” and adapt a lot of stuff
anyways netbeans is a great tool after all.
i did an import of my zend studio preferences and then started changing some setting, and i had a hiccup.
as far as the php-oops oriented coding is concern i would recommend netbeans as the ide.
in the process of configuring eclipse, i, of course, started messing with preferences.

netbeans with various windows open
one of outcomes of switching jobs is you lose some of your favorite tools.
having done php development full time for many years, zend studio had become my ide of choice.
no.. i will certainly not go back to eclipse!
you'll find several good articles on the web about this,  so i won't go into individual features here.
and i have to disagree with your arguments.
but when you want more control and more advanced stuff i’m pretty sure eclipse is the way to go.
i'm guessing zend  studio preferences have problems with importing to eclipse.
the power of the  internet a new site coming for php – a preview → netbeans 7.1 review posted on january 21, 2012 by dalev one of outcomes of switching jobs is you lose some of your favorite  tools.
if your doing java development, netbeans should be your ide of choice,  since it was built with java development in mind.
netbeans fonts and colors preference screen
actually there is a funny alternative: aptana studio whicht is based on eclipse.
in conclusion, because of problems i've had configuring colors with eclipse, even using theeclipse color theme plugin i wrote about in another post, i find myself using netbeans to write my code.
each plugin added to eclipse has its own preferences, every section of eclipse has it own preferences.
i highly recommend you download and try netbeans.
what surprised me was  how far netbeans has come as a php development environment.
in contrast, netbeans preferences are a pleasure.

eclipse  feels bloated.
netbeans php preference screen
if your doing java development, netbeans should be your ide of choice, since it was built with java development in mind.
it is possible to configure netbeans 7.1.1 with zend server ce?
so you don't have to reconfigure then again, you  export your preferences and import them to the new eclipse environments.
for simple things it is ok, but eclipse outperforms it in nearly everything advanced.
