sillyprocessor its only contents is the name of the processor implementation.
these are compiled and usable just like any other normal class.
filer.createsourcefile( "silly/" + sillyclassname, element); file.openwriter() .append(sillyclasscontent) .close(); } catch (ioexception e) { e.printstacktrace(); } } return true; } } without creating this meta-inf entry i couldn’t get the processor to register in eclipse.

press the “advanced” button and you’ll be presented with a dialog which contains the processor you defined in your meta-inf/services/javax.annotation.processing.

* namespace, and you had to use theapt tool to process the source code.
here’s what it looks like for me in my project: so we get a warning for the thing class because its class name start with a “t” and for each class in the project we get corresponding “silly” classes generated.
jdk6 cleaned up the api and integrated this stuff it into javac itself so you didn’t need to use the separate apt tool anymore.

in the properties for your new project go to java compiler -> annotation processing check the “enable project specific settings” and make sure “enable annotation processing” is checked.

apparently built for processing source code with annotations before they are compiled into classes, it can also be used for all kinds of fun like code generation and code analyzers which are ide independent; and you don’t even need to use annotations necessarily.
so we’re creating a processor which will generate a new class for each class in projects compiled using this processor.
i also changed the generated source directory to a name which didn’t start with a dot so it wouldn’t be hidden in the package explorer (files or directories which start with a dot are by default filtered away in eclipse).
this is when i tried to register a processor with the depricated annotations running with the silly processor you introduced.

i tried to add more than one processor in the jar and i found out, according to theprocessor.process java doc that you need to return false instead of true (in you example).

when making both processors return false; both processors run well.
so if we're returning true from process subsequent processors which match the same supported annotation types will not be called.
