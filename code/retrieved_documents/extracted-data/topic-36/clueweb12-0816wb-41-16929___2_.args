oracle has been a leader in the java community since the inception of the java programming language and already has the world’s largest investment in the java platform, which provides the foundation for its oracle fusion middleware products and its next-generation enterprise applications.i can easily see netbeans being recommended by oracle for developing consumer applications (desktop, mobile, embedded) on the java platform, with jdeveloper being recommended for developing enterprise applications (web, soa, mobile web).as for netbeans it is most likely that oracle will continue its support and funding but will likely cut back on java ee support for the ide, and increase its javafx/java se/java me support.the nice thing about his plan is that netbeans, glassfish and virtualbox are all what some programmers need to fasten and improve the uses of these products.netbeans is integrated and looks and feels like one toolset instead of the smattering of tools that it actually is."  a commercial license for openoffice will also be available to customers that require enterprise level support and tools.that's why i've been wary of relying on sun's open source product lines (afraid all the funding for them would dry up sooner or later), preferring instead oss competitors that have proven to be successful on their own (jetty, spring, eclipse, etc.).that means he writes and searches for the finest developer content in the land so that you don't have to." glassfish oracle says it will "invest in aligning common infrastructure components and innovations" between oracle weblogic server and glassfish.oracle makes it clear however, that jdeveloper is still "oracle's strategic development tool" for oracle fusion and future enterprise applications.as a mysql user, tell me how i stand to benefit from my data storage tool being owned by a company that views mysql as something that eats millions of dollars per year in potential oracle database licensing?if these succeed then oracle will surely have a great portfolio.in any case, the alternative was ibm (the "owner" of the eclipse foundation) or the failure - well, failure is anticompetitive by its very nature, as things mostly vanish in thin air.oracle says that jdeveloper, enterprise pack, and netbeans will all be options "for pure java and java ee development.i believe that glassfish is here to stay, because jee is open sourced and needs a reference implementation, thus justifying the existence of two separate products.
