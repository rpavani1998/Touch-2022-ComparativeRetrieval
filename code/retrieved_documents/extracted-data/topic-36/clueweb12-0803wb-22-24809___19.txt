i've tried eclipse, zend studio, komodo, rubymine...  and almost didn't bother with netbeans because it seemed that any ide was bound  to be a disappointment.
i believe it's the best ruby ide out there.
then netbeans released 6.5 with php support.
i opened netbeans,  and found some cool stuff, which i later learned that eclipse doesn't have!
the fact that netbeans offers a full-fledged ide that runs on  multiple platforms is enough in itself.
code completion, automated javadoc  building, automated jar deployment and the astonishing profiler make this the  best ide out there for developers working on large projects.
that was about it, i used it for about 6  months before i was forced to work with jbuilder in early 2002.
all in all,  with the improvements made to the netbeans editor, the tight integration with  maven, and the painless way of setting up a jsf project (essentially, all  required code completion and features works "automagically")
real stories from people switching to the netbeans ide!
it worked  out of the box both under windows xp and opensuse 10.3.
i can't say enough good things about netbeans.
excerpt from blog entry: eclipse hits the mat...netbeans new champ!
code completion is one of them, and in netbeans it looks awesome.
here are some of their stories.
i decided to give netbeans 6 a try, and i was amazed at the integration of the development environment.
why would i pay $250 for intellij when i can get netbeans for free?
it is also fast thanks  to advances in hardware and so far has allowed me to easily develop non-gui  java applications (programming assignments) for the object oriented programming  module that i am currently teaching.
looking for an  alternative, i came across aptana, and it blew me away.

excerpt from blog entry: java and netbeans - finally a brew that i am able to enjoy as an academic teaching computer science for the past thirty years (currentlyhere) i have seen major changes take place in terms of the programmers working environment. ...
i think your efforts and product so far are so good you should get people running down the streets wearing t-shirts and singing.
refcard i  switched from eclipse to netbeans about 2 years ago and i am completely happy  with it.
for me, netbeans now works and i have encouraged my colleagues to consider using it for their teaching!
i  just have everything in netbeans - out of the box.
and how it acts just hit the wrong nerve.
my students who used borland's jbuilder  previously, were equally impressed.
excerpt from blog entry: eclipse veteran switches to netbeans ...
i used to use code::blocks, it's a great ide, don't get me wrong, but pretty soon, a certain error
that means that opening//<![cdata [ comments would comment out entire scripts.
professionally, i used also eclipse and intellij idea in other projects,  but never even thought of switching to any of them with eportfel.
ryan penn i love the ruby and ruby on rails support in netbeans!
count me in as a new convert....
i've been using netbeans since 6.8 was released, and i'm completely happy that this is the right choice for our development needs in the future.
josh eckerman, eventux, llc i just wanted to say that netbeans 6.7.1 has blown myself and my  team away.
i’m officially in love with netbeans for now.
i haven't  bothered to use eclipse since.
there are few features i expect my ide to have.
i also tried eclipse and abandoned it for the same reason.
the fact that it does all of this better than any ide i've ever  seen is teetering on goofy.
crtl+clicking a method call navigates to the method declaration
if you work on sizable php projects and you’re not using an ide like netbeans, you might be surprised at how much time a tool like this can save you!
what i like most is that this ide gets better and better with every  release, even with release candidates or master releases.
scott carpenter, senior i/t professional, minnesota, usa excerpt from blog entry:
incremental deployments (that's awesome).
i am currently  working on an enterprise scale distributed web application framework with over  200 source files and about 2 dozen import packages and netbeans has managed the  coding and execution of my work perfectly.
i think the main difference between eclipse and netbeans is, that netbeans focuses on providing the very basic functionality for a developer.
refcard i switched from eclipse to netbeans about 2 years ago and i am completely happy with it.
however, the bottom line is netbeans makes you a better  developer.
if you have some spare time, give it a try.
i stayed with the dw tools until version 8, when i got fed up with the continual costs of upgrading and the traditional bugs on release 1 of any version.
long dismissed as a “toy java ide”,  netbeansâ€”sun’s open source integrated development  evironment (ide)â€”has really grown up in recent years.
levan dvalishvili here is the top 5 features that pulled me to neatbeans from  eclipse: very decent jsp editor, plus seamless integration with tomcat.
ctrl+space automatically suggests variable names ...
by version 4, netbeans was incredibly  intuitive, stable and offered good tools for refactoring (the global search and  replace features are a godsend) then came version 5, then 5.5.
audience member at java day 2008, bratislava why would i pay $250 for intellij when i can get netbeans for  free?
but because of my commitment to free software, i have always been on the lookout for an ide that i could share with my students with them working under ms and me under linux.
i have been using netbeans since the time it was called forte, way back in 2001.
finally, i decided to give  netbeans a try and, thank god, i don’t have any issues yet…
my main requirements were great handling of php code, and great javascript - jquery in particular.
after using this, we've begun a migration to netbeans, and everyone is hitting the ground running.
you have to write html, css, and javascript code as well.
netbeans has now surpassed eclipse in usability.
i was surprised by the responsiveness without  sacrificing high-level functionality, and the feature set that seems to  anticipate exactly what i want and would have designed into the product.
i've  managed to convert a number of die-hard eclipse guys over to netbeans.
eclipse was nice, but netbeans has a much more comfortable feel to it.
try it, you won't be disappointed.
i dropped dw and was a loyal aptana user for over a year.
i just have everything in netbeans - out of the box.
so,  i'm very happy with netbeans and i'll be using it, at least for java.
great ide speed (faster than eclipse that liked to freeze my desktop) 5.
daniel noz excerpt from blog entry: netbeans ide 6.7
so, i'm very happy with netbeans and i'll be using it, at least for java.
i’m  officially in love with netbeans for now.
i'll be using netbeans for all of my ruby, groovy, and eventually  scala development.
needless to say, that soured aptana’s  viability completely, and after looking into a fix for about an hour, i  declared netbeans the winner.
after using this,  we've begun a migration to netbeans, and everyone is hitting the ground  running.
i highly recommend netbeans to all  my coding friends over any alternative when i get the chance.
when i'm not using svn, i can save the file i'm working on, and it is automatically uploaded to the web or testing server.
yet, right out of the box, netbeans  is pre-configured to develop, debug, and deploy web components quickly onto  tomcat (which is included with the download).
so i went online to search  for java, the language i've been refusing for so long.
i have already switched the whole  company to netbeans for php, but little ol' me isn't enough to reach the  masses.
another thing, and the most important one, netbeans is free.
laurin1 excerpt from zend forum:  netbeans  6.5....zend studio please pay attention my company bought three 3-year licenses for zend studio earlier  this and up until a few weeks ago, there was nothing else on the market that  even came close to meeting our requirements.
it comes back to gui  programming and started [] when i went looking for a way to do this in eclipse.
but it feels odd that i don't have to pay  for this one!
i  also tried eclipse and abandoned it for the same reason.
i wanted something free, and feature packed.
it is very well tested and has a  great integration with databases and application servers.
it just  worked...and perfectly!
i work in a development and support shop.
i should also admit that i also wanted to access the additional  capabilities these ides now offered.
the automatic integration of  frameworks (along with the tutorials) makes acquiring facility with new java  technologies relatively easy.
i’ve been using nusphere phped for some time, it also has similar feature but does not write the require statement like netbeans.
i have mostly programmed in c#.
so what has tipped me over to netbeans?
- incremental deployments (that's awesome).
debugger that actually works well with web applications.
things i earlier missed from the eclipse  editor are now available in netbeans, such as: highlighting a variable highlights it everywhere in the file, making it  easy to see where it is been used.
needless to say, that soured aptana’s viability completely, and after looking into a fix for about an hour, i declared netbeans the winner.
netbeans came out the winner - not least because it  wasn't based on a bloated eclipse platform, and being free, i couldn't argue  with the price.
these more recent efforts were renewed efforts to migrate from emacs to bring myself into line with my colleagues and students who as i have already mentioned mostly used borland's ide.
these days, it’s a powerful, multi-language development environment that’s free for the taking.
i've managed to convert a number of die-hard eclipse guys over to netbeans.
that means that opening//<![cdata [ comments  would comment out entire scripts.
profiler that actually works.
this has  however changed in recent times and i have tried it again, only to abandon it  as it was often an overkill for small teaching level programming projects.
http monitor that actually works.
i would never use  notepad++ for c/c++/java, and that's why i use netbeans.
i've tried eclipse, zend studio, komodo, rubymine... and almost didn't bother with netbeans because it seemed that any ide was bound to be a disappointment.
i had briefly tried netbeans before, however i always went  back to eclipse because it offered a much better java editor, i think this has  changed in version 6 of netbeans.
this year i have once again tried both netbeans and eclipse.
eclipse was  nice, but netbeans has a much more comfortable feel to it.
if you work on sizable php projects and you’re not using an ide  like netbeans, you might be surprised at how much time a tool like this can  save you!
java ide sorry eclipse, but it was bound to happen.
i shouldn't really call it a "migration" either.
i enjoyed the ease with which i could get my project going  and really liked the color coding.
it comes back to gui programming and started [] when i went looking for a way to do this in eclipse.
i haven't bothered to use eclipse since.
the automatic integration of frameworks (along with the tutorials) makes acquiring facility with new java technologies relatively easy.
a php ide with debugging built in (dw didn't have that a the time), and great facilities.
well done to all the people involved in producing such a great ide.
right out of the gate, their php and javascript support is on the  whole, so much better and faster than zend's product, with so many fewer bugs,  that despite the fact that we spent $1000 this year investing in zend's  product, and i personally have spent time with zend's tech support and  developers (good guys, very helpful), i am assisting my team in migrating over  to use netbeans for most of our development....
many developers are migrating their applications to the netbeans ide from  other ides.
forte  was replaced by netbeans, i went through all the major versions up to 4.2  before the buzz on this "uber" ide called eclipse started up.
i’m just saying i feel more comfortable now, today, using netbeans than using zend or nuspere; not to mention the cost of each of them.
i had become used to writing my php code in a simple text editor (jedit, if you’re wondering), so it had been awhile since i’d enjoyed the luxuries of project-wide code completion, code refactoring, and a full debugger.
(saves me a lot of time.)
it's a good product, and  attractively priced.
no crazy configuration necessary.
great ant integration (no more hand-keeping consistency between ide and separate build script!)
i highly recommend netbeans to all my coding friends over any alternative when i get the chance.
my advice to java developers out there: give netbeans a try!
doug puchalski free software is great.
this year i have once again  tried both netbeans and eclipse.
the fact that it's open source is down right nuts.
in my experience, it takes much time to configure  eclipse to properly develop web components.
well, i don't like microsoft products to begin with, so this was a natural disaster waiting to happen, and guess what... it happened...
ultimately it came down to a showdown between aptana studio and netbeans, and while they were pretty close, aptana’s php plug-in failed me miserably when it came to actual usage: when i launched the site (via “run” function, if i remember correctly), my entire site was squished onto one line.
this all started when it occurred to me that i was going nowhere fast trying to do php coding with eclipse's phpeclipse plugin....
just import, and off you go.
i've written and deployed web based support apps from some of my clients in as little as an hour or two.
all in all, with the improvements made to the netbeans editor, the tight integration with maven, and the painless way of setting up a jsf project (essentially, all required code completion and features works "automagically")
excerpt from blog entry:20
and as a  summary i have to say i do not have any need for looking for better tool.
netbeans is hands down the best ide, with the least about of bugs, and virtually no learning curve (try that eclipse...), that i've used.
many developers are migrating their applications to the netbeans ide from other ides.
zachelko excerpt from blog entry: netbeans: why it matters ...
no longer is it just for java, either: for web developers, netbeans 6.5 now supports ruby and php out of the box.
i think your efforts and product so far are so good you should get  people running down the streets wearing t-shirts and singing.
attach an in-depth  profiler?
great and consistent ide ui (no more ui mess like in  eclipse) 4.
until they dropped all  php support from the tool, changed the ftp method (and broke it), and generally  showed that they no longer had a strategy to support php developers.
but it didn't have the intuitive feel that forte did.
[...] this took a while of jumping  from site to site, checking out feature comparison charts, trying different  software, and so on.
the more users you can reach at these early stages will help with user feedback  and to drive future feature development.
i stayed with the dw  tools until version 8, when i got fed up with the continual costs of upgrading  and the traditional bugs on release 1 of any version.
free software is great.
i opened netbeans, and found some cool stuff, which i later learned that eclipse doesn't have!
professionally, i used also eclipse and intellij idea in other projects, but never even thought of switching to any of them with eportfel.
netbeans unpacks and sets up easily.
i just wanted to say that netbeans 6.7.1 has blown myself and my team away.
moving to netbeans (from eclipse) ...
the fact that it covers the major elements of all of the languages it supports is second to none.
and even better, redeployments seem to go pretty smoothly and take a couple seconds to do.
you can  lock yourself away, keep all the lights off, cover your face if you must, but  just try it.
this has however changed in recent times and i have tried it again, only to abandon it as it was often an overkill for small teaching level programming projects.
this post is not intended to be some detailed review of a product.
the built-in example apps are  self-explanatory and highly instructive.
there are few other things in which netbeans stands out of the crowd, like xhtml code completion and so on.
travis walters excerpt from blog entry: the second coming of netbeans [...] i hate to say it but...
rarely do i use software that seems to anticipate  my needs before i even realize them myself.
branko excerpt from blog entry: netbeans 6.5 php edition ...
i also plan to try netbeans on my next java gig to see how it holds up in an enterprise development environment.
when netbeans first appeared, i tried it, but only once as it was so slow on my box that it was unusable.
if you haven't used netbeans in a while i'd strongly encourage you to check it out.
i believe  it's the best ruby ide out there.
the fact that it has support for every language you could ever want (or need) to write code in is nearly unprecedented.
yet, right out of the box, netbeans is pre-configured to develop, debug, and deploy web components quickly onto tomcat (which is included with the download).
it has become a  sluggish beast.
and when a single file  mixes these languages together, netbeans handles it all seamlessly.
it’s a merely an personal observation.
kevin yank excerpt from blog: php support in netbeans 6.5
code sharing (collaboration).
i was afraid i'd have to go through mountains of tutorials to regain my level of proficiency i had with eclipse.
i enjoyed the ease with which i could get my project going and really liked the color coding.
is an ide that stands out above all others.
i quickly found references to the visual editor plugin, and i found a lot of  information about it, but i couldn’t get it working with my installation  of eclipse.
three strikes and you're out  eclipse!
james excerpt from blog entry: a few software recommendations for  php/javascript
well, i don't like  microsoft products to begin with, so this was a natural disaster waiting to  happen, and guess what... it happened...
recently, i have undertaken some changes in my development environment.
werner vesteraas, norway i got fed up with eclipse after four years.
great non-php tools for php developers netbeans
i now implement mvc easily without having to  memorize arcane directory structures.
i’ve done my 300th deployment now and no memory warnings, no bumps.
(saves me  a lot of time.)
the search took a few weeks, and i tried all the php ide's out there.
the ide war will never be settled.
any file can be quickly opened via a keyboard shortcut (in eclipse it is  ctrl+shift+r, in netbeans it is shift+alt+o)
i'll be using netbeans for all of my ruby, groovy, and eventually scala development.
i've abandoned  radrails for netbeans.
that means i need software, and  i need it to be either free or inexpensive.
i downloaded the netbeans ide to program a  peer-to-peer networking course project for my graduate studies.
and then you'll wonder why you weren't using it years ago.
i was surprised by the responsiveness without sacrificing high-level functionality, and the feature set that seems to anticipate exactly what i want and would have designed into the product.
things i earlier missed from the eclipse editor are now available in netbeans, such as: ...all in all, with the improvements made to the netbeans editor, the tight integration with maven, and the painless way of setting up a jsf project (essentially, all required code completion and features works "automagically")
this made me the most nervous because it can be quite a dance  dealing with java dependencies, etc.
on top of that, the tool is slick and clean....
surprisingly, that support is so good that it now compares favourably to more established competitors like eclipse, komodo ide, and zend studio.
i’d say that it’s a permanent  replacement for dreamweaver in my book; netbeans is pretty much a php  coder’s dream come true.
by version 4, netbeans was incredibly intuitive, stable and offered good tools for refactoring (the global search and replace features are a godsend) then came version 5, then 5.5.
i used to use  code::blocks, it's a great ide, don't get me wrong, but pretty soon, a certain  error
so i went online to search for java, the language i've been refusing for so long.
great non-php tools for php developers netbeans is an ide that stands out above all others.
i personally think you have the best  ide out there already for php development.
i think the main  difference between eclipse and netbeans is, that netbeans focuses on providing  the very basic functionality for a developer.
with enough motivation i might have persevered, but i had the  netbeans alternative to look at.... maciej wegorkiewicz, software consultant i want to thank the team for the best ide i use for six years for  development of personal finance application eportfel (www.eportfel.com).
i had briefly tried netbeans before, however i always went back to eclipse because it offered a much better java editor, i think this has changed in version 6 of netbeans.
if you've never tried netbeans, i strongly encourage you to do so.
count me in as a new convert.
great and consistent ide ui (no more ui mess like in eclipse) 4.
this post is not intended to be some detailed review of a  product.
the boys at sun have done an extremely amazing job of writing an ide devoid of anything overly cryptic.
it is very well tested and has a great integration with databases and application servers.
it's alright, you don't have to tell anyone that you're using netbeans.
but for rich client  guis, netbeans has no competition on the market.
- highlighting a variable highlights it everywhere in the file, making it easy to see where it is been used.
all of these and more are  available in netbeans 6.5.
it helps you do your job, and it helps you do your job well.
recently, i have undertaken some changes in my  development environment.
adam mcmahon no crazy configuration necessary.
and as a summary i have to say i do not have any need for looking for better tool.

david saintloth, chief software architect, apriority llc i have been using netbeans since the time it was called forte,  way back in 2001.

netbeans isn’t a toy for learning java anymore.

i am very  impressed with the functionality of the netbeans ide for java programming!
i've been developing websites since 1999, and at kpdirection since 2001, starting with macromedia dreamweaver ultradev.
it is very small, fast, and has many built-in features that help  create better code, more efficiently.
if you have some spare time, give it a  try.

my students who used borland's jbuilder previously, were equally impressed.

netbeans is now my weapon of choice.
[...] i hate to say it but...
however, the bottom line is netbeans makes you a better developer.
i’m just saying i  feel more comfortable now, today, using netbeans than using zend or nuspere;  not to mention the cost of each of them.
great ide speed (faster than eclipse that liked to freeze my  desktop) 5.
netbeans was selected to replace eclipse itself for my java and java me projects.
try  it, you won't be disappointed.
i will use netbeans ide for my  remaining graduate level courses in computer science at the university of  florida.
finally, i decided to give netbeans a try and, thank god, i don’t have any issues yet…
code completion, automated javadoc building, automated jar deployment and the astonishing profiler make this the best ide out there for developers working on large projects.
it offers a  built-in ftp client (far superior to dreamweaver) or supports subversion  publishing.

attach an in-depth profiler?
these are main  reasons that make netbeans best: 1.
forte was replaced by netbeans, i went through all the major versions up to 4.2 before the buzz on this "uber" ide called eclipse started up.

i decided to download and install eclipse and for the life of me i don't know how anyone could compare that to netbeans.

but it feels odd that i don't have to pay for this one!
that was about it, i used it for about 6 months before i was forced to work with jbuilder in early 2002.
i have been using eclipse for several years for servlet development.
and then you'll wonder why you weren't
i have used almost all, if not all, the ides that have looked good enough to try.
i can't say enough  good things about netbeans.
these more recent  efforts were renewed efforts to migrate from emacs to bring myself into line  with my colleagues and students who as i have already mentioned mostly used  borland's ide.
i’ve been using nusphere phped  for some time, it also has similar feature but does not write the require  statement like netbeans.
i would never use notepad++ for c/c++/java, and that's why i use netbeans.
it has become a sluggish beast.
you won't have any trouble at all getting people to convert from other ides to netbeans, that i am certain of...
the fact that it has support for every  language you could ever want (or need) to write code in is nearly  unprecedented.
so, i’m now self employed.
and gotta love http monitor.
i have already switched the whole company to netbeans for php, but little ol' me isn't enough to reach the masses.

you can lock yourself away, keep all the lights off, cover your face if you must, but just try it.
you won't need any training, it's that easy.
break your code down by classes?
eclipse and aptana studio pro were our standbys.
the fact that netbeans offers a full-fledged ide that runs on multiple platforms is enough in itself.
i installed eclipse on my laptop awhile back and had been suffering somewhat harsh just trying to prevent it from running out of permgen space....

netbeans came out the winner - not least because it wasn't based on a bloated eclipse platform, and being free, i couldn't argue with the price.
