merge sort is a great sorting algorithm mainly because it’s very fast and stable.the good news is that this algorithm is fast, but not too difficult to implement and that sounds quite good from a developer’s point of view.merge sort is however based on the comparison model and as such can be slower than algorithms not based on comparisons that can sort data in linear time.it is written in c# but it can be easily converted to java or any other language.new relic provides the resources and best practices to help you monitor these applications.after sorting the smaller lists, which is supposed to be easier than sorting the entire initial list, we can try to merge the result into one sorted list.fast no matter the input merge sort is a great sorting algorithm mainly because it’s very fast and stable.implementation the good news is that this algorithm is fast, but not too difficult to implement and that sounds quite good from a developer’s point of view.slower than non-comparison based algorithms merge sort is however based on the comparison model and as such can be slower than algorithms not based on comparisons that can sort data in linear time.as a conclusion i can say that merge sort is practically one of the best sorting algorithms because it’s easy to implement and fast, so it must be considered by every developer!so we can be sure that merge sort is very stable no matter the input.dzone has great portals for python, cloud, nosql , andhtml5!indeed if the input is nearly sorted the insertion sort or bubble sort can be faster.of course, this depends on the input data, so we must be careful of the input.the python zone is sponsored bynew relic, the all-in-one web application performance tool that lets yousee performance from the end user experience, through servers, and down to the line of application code.
