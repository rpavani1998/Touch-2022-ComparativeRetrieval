according to the netbeans performance tuning tips, changing the garbage collection policies can also make a difference.indeed, almost all the facts here are 2.5 years old and made obsolete by new software releases including a jit performance update to java 6 in may 2009 (update 14; last update: 29), eclipse (galileo, helios, indigo) and netbeans (6.7, 6.8, 7.0).what the article is trying to point out is that if you use the default settings from netbeans in eclipse, they work a lot better than the eclipse default settings.applying these switches has made eclipse much more comfortable to use, but i guess other peoples milage may differ depending on what they are doing or what machine they are using.the result is a vast improvement in performance.gc configuration makes a difference because your cpu is spending more time with gc than doing work for you.the java evolution mismatch: why you need a better jvm apache lucene 3.0: download the lucidworks certified distribution when compared to netbeans, i find that eclipse is a lot slower, particularly when doing enterprise development.the jvm options that make the biggest difference are the ones that specify how much memory eclipse can use.to try and speed eclipse up, i’ve taken the jvm settings that netbeans uses and applied them to eclipse.the default jvm settings in eclipse aren’t optimal.he started programming in java way back with java 1.0 developing desktop applications and applets.(note: opinions expressed in this article and its replies are the opinions of their respective authors and not those of dzone, inc.) comments mladen girazovski replied on fri, 2011/12/02 - 6:35am i also append the -server option, letting the jit/hotspot do more aggressive optimizations, but it requires an installed jdk.this reference of best practices and idiomatic solutions smoothly guides you to the next step of... html5 canvas: a web standard for dynamic graphics - dzone - refcardz - book reviews - tech library - it questions - snippets - my profile - about dzone - advertise - tools & buttons - send feedback - topics - html5 - wp7 - cloud - mobile - .net - python - java - php - solr-lucene - eclipse - jetbrains - netbeans - agile - devops controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.i am building a web application that is using following: i think eclipse start building complete project every time you make a change in code and it is effecting its performance.dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!
