which eases the integration in an enterprise application between components that have been derived from the java ee side of the universe.but, our objective with doing that is to gain experience and ensure that we have developed an efficient and usable and practical model for deploying multi‑bundled applications in order to inform our work in the osgi alliance.how we can encourage the use of osgi more globally, across the java platform and in particular, in the enterprise java space, in the osgi enterprise expert group and latterly to help set up the apache aries project which focuses on building enterprise osgi technologies and in particular enterprise osgi technologies that affect application components.i would like to see java evolve so that it recognizes the 10 years of experience, probably 11 years of experience, that we have in the osgi alliance of building modular systems and actually adopt osgi as the module system for java.in a container managed environment, the container that the application component runs it, for example, a blueprint container can work with and discover jpa providers and inject entity managers from those jpa providers into an application, in order to process it's persistence units.in the jmx implementation in apache aries, we implement mbeans services so that you can use jmx to query aspects of a running osgi framework.in this interview, recorded at ibm impact 2010, ian talks about how apache aries relates to the osgi framework, and its support for numerous java ee specs, including thejava persistence api (jpa), the java transaction api (jta), and java management extensions (jmx).in that model, the application is managing the use of the entity manager and it's association with any transaction context, for example.one of the other things that i think apache aries has a very forward‑looking approach to is the assembly and deployment of multi‑bundled applications.and in that model, in the managed model, the container not only manages the life cycle of the entity manager, but it also manages the relationship of the entity manager's persistence context with any transaction that the application happens to be running under.beyond that, we've had interest expressed by members of the community to extend the work of the enterprise expert group at the moment with development of some more forward‑looking things, and indeed some things that we are interested in standardizing through the enterprise expert group.so the blueprint container is extended with the jpa container so that the blueprint components that run inside the blueprint container can have their jpa context managed for them by the blueprint container.view full user profile dzone recently met up with ibm's ian robinson to discuss apache aries, a project which aims to deliver a set of pluggable java components enabling an enterprise osgi application programming model.there is an application usage model where the application essentially finds a jpa provider, interacts with it to create an entity manager factory and then uses the entity manager factory.for example, an osgi service registered in the service registry can also be made available for discovery through jndi by a jndi client.
