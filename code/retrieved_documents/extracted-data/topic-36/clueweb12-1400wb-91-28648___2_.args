intellij idea 5.0 brings code analysis to a whole new level, helping developers not only to understand code, but to find problems early, keep the design clean, and also to aid iterative design when used in combination with refactoring.intellij idea's intelligence really shines, helping developers quickly navigate and code html and xhtml in ways that are simply not possible with other tools.move/copy file safe delete file extract inlined style block from html into a css file the new i18n support provides multiple important features that make working on internationalization issues simple and convenient.new refactorings: intellij idea has more and better quality refactoring features than any other ide, and intellij idea 5.0 adds even more.skip simple getters/setters force step-over, ignoring breakpoints drag and drop support for breakpoints intellij idea 5.0 is the first ide to provide serious support for javascript, introducing many of the useful features java developers have become accustomed to.all of intellij idea's smart java features, like refactorings, intentions, inspections, etc., work in scriptlet and declarations code: jsp 2.0 support jsp source-level debugging under websphere application server jsp code formatting optimize imports in jsp structure view for jsp files the support for coding html and xhtml in intellij idea 5.0 rivals, and in many cases surpasses, dedicated html tools.debugger new intellij idea 5.0 has several new debugging features, including some great breakpoint improvements to make debugging smarter, so developers can find bugs faster with less manual effort.jsp code mostly produces different kind of html pages and it is important to have all html code clean.intellij idea 5.0 makes it even easier and more powerful to customize any object display in the debugger, similar to the alternate collections view feature.not only layout, even speed of page rendering increased dramatically when browsers switched from "quirks" toÂ  "standards compliance" mode.not only layout, even speed of page rendering increased dramatically when browsers switched from "quirks" to "standards compliance" mode.additionally, intellij idea combines all of the support for html, css, and javascript into one seamless package, and provides full support for java code inside jsp scriptlets.move/copy file extract inlined style block from html into a css file i18n support new the new i18n support provides multiple important features that make working on internationalization issues simple and convenient.all of intellij idea's smart java features, like refactorings, intentions, inspections, etc., work in scriptlet and declarations code: jsp 2.0 support support for jsp document format (jspx) jsp source-level debugging under websphere application server jsp code formatting structure view for jsp files html and xhtml support new the support for coding html and xhtml in intellij idea 5.0 rivals, and in many cases surpasses, dedicated html tools.move method: a separate refactoring from move static method, this new refactoring safely moves non-static methods from one class to another.
