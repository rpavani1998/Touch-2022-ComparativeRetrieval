applying these switches has made eclipse much more comfortable to use, but  i guess other peoples milage may differ depending on what they are doing or  what machine they are using.
what the article is trying to point out is that if you use the default settings from netbeans in eclipse, they work a lot better than the eclipse default settings.

if there is no memory available fo example you specify the startup size with xms option and if that much memory can not be allocated then eclipse won't start.

i was using myeclipse 10 and netbeans 6.8 for the same application.
