for using most of the enterprise technologies based on java, you generally need at least the following components installed and configured on your system: based on which java based technology/framework you want to use, you may need to install further dependencies.it is not yet completely bug free though: it also helps in easy navigation using hyperlinks.at last we have a java ide that ships with struts 2 support built-in: no manual configuring the web applications to add struts 2 support and no more hassles of finding and installing struts 2 plugins.the generated web.xml file includes the following configuration elements needed by the struts 2 framework so that you don’t have to type or copy/paste it manually in every struts 2 web application:it’s a shame that after such a long period since the release of struts 2 web framework, its support in all the popular ides is next to zero.using nbstruts2support in netbeans ide the plugin doesn’t allow a struts 2 project template to be created in netbeans, which means that we need to manually create a basic web application and add struts 2 libraries to it manually.even though you may not need all the three components mentioned above to be able to work with all java technologies, i found myself installing them way too many times when compared to any other java component that i wanted a place to document the installation process of these three components specifically, if only to refer to this post from other java tutorials in future.based on which java based technology/framework you want to use, you may need to install further dependencies.if you get an error saying that the ‘java’ command is not recognised or is not available, then you need to check the values the above environment variables were set to once again.even though you may not need all the three components mentioned above to work with every java technology, i found myself installing them way too many times when compared to any other java component that i wanted a place to document the installation process of these three components specifically, if only to refer to this post from other java tutorials.run the netbeans ide and create a new web application project in it.it is at least slightly better than creating and developing struts 2 applications completely manually.based on the java based technology/framework you want to use, you may need to install further dependencies.as you can see, the required struts 2 libraries are automatically downloaded and installed in thelib directory(and included in the build path) by the ide.before we can run the application, we first need to create/edit the run configuration for our project.
