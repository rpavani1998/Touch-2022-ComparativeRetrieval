if you do a feature by feature analysis of eclipse and netbeans, you'll find that both ide's pretty much have the same features and functionality.netbeans is like an editor with a little bit of sophisticated tool calling where eclipse really is an ide.since php is now an object-oriented language, like java, netbeans has incorporated php into its editor.setting preferences is straightforward and java development support is great.netbeans feels integrated, not like your bringing up a separate application every time you go to a new area of the ide.if you do a feature by feature analysis of eclipse and netbeans, you'll find that both ide's pretty much have the same features andif you don't like netbeans, you can stay with eclipse, but in the process of using both, i think you'll find yourself gradually moving to netbeans as your ide of choice.if your doing java development, netbeans should be your ide of choice, since it was built with java development in mind.one main argument for netbeans against eclipse+pdt: in netbeans you can format the sourcecode (and adapting your coding styles).i have been using both eclipse and netbeans professionally (java), and when i can choose myself its a nobrainer: netbeans!netbeans do the same things as eclipse – but smoother and with all the stuff you need build in out of the box.if your a php developer, netbeans has integrated support for git, debugging, phpunit testing, phpdoc, smarty templates, symfony framework, and the zend framework.not only that, if you set a preference in one area, it might not be set in another, and may collide with another preference, sometime throwing errors, or shutting down the editor.i give you that… for me netbeans is wisely written ide, very intuitive, effective, … i use netbeans for php and the support is awesome.btw netbeans settings preferences compared to intellij is not so good… i agree only that netbeans is more newbie friendly and you don’t have to know much about classpath and compiling/building to produce a working application.not saying that netbeans can do things that eclipse can’t – the same is true the other way around, but in my experience netbeans just is more intuitive to use.
