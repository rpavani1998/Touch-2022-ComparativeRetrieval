ecs tools can search both internally-indexed code bases and external open source software repositories.
these tools have pre-built adapters to connect to and index code from leading scm products, and because they provide read-only access, can be implemented without impact to the actual scm systems.
while developers can leverage code search from within their local ide, they are limited to seeing what’s in their workspace.

if you are looking for more information on cloud computing then this dzone refcard is for you.
there is one type of tool that could help you take better advantage of internal and external code: enterprise code search.
and ecs tools can provide plug-ins for developer ides, further integrating code search into a developer’s every day experience.
further, because up to 80% of the code in apps today can come from open source projects, being able to extend the search capability to include open source projects that live outside the organization also becomes important.
and most of that code is locked up in a source control management system (scm) specific to an app or to an organization.
while developers can leverage code search from within their local ide, they are limited to seeing what’s in their workspace.
the typical api has little documentation and few good examples, so it can be frustrating and time consuming for people to figure out how to use them successfully.
and getting visibility to code in other scms can even be more difficult.
you can read more from them attheir website.
to accomplish this, developers would need an easy way to search for and view an api call within existing code stored in enterprise code repositories.

this is the reality for most large companies managing hundreds of millions of lines of code -- the majority of which was purpose-built to solve specific application problems.

dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!
the typical api has little documentation and few good examples, so it can be frustrating and time consuming for people to figure out how to use them successfully.
enterprise code search (ecs) tools can index massive amounts of internal code from many different scms, providing developers with easy-to-use search tools that can display formatted code.

when most people think about a company’s assets, source code doesn’t show up on the list.
enterprise code search (ecs) tools can index massive amounts of internal code from many different scms, providing developers with easy-to-use search tools that can display formatted code.
so while some organizations may have already figured out how to wholesale reuse some of their code, every organization has the opportunity to help their development teams develop new applications faster by providing them greater visibility into existing enterprise code bases.
