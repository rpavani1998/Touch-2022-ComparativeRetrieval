together they will discuss and debate the need for a new type of jdbc driver – a type 5 jdbc driver that: - overcomes the limitations of type 4 jdbc driver architecture - delivers better java application performance regardless of what data access model the application uses - allows modern data-driven java applications to easily take advantage of years of innovation in database features without requiring code changes whether your jpa, hibernate, or spring-based applications are experiencing performance problems or if adding new database features to your application is resulting in brittle code changes and work-arounds, you'll definitely want to check out this presentation.
