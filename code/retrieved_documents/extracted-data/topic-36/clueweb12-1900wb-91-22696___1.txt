in the last part of the article, the author warns about ignoring the next  version of microsoft visual studio (code named “orcas“), because  microsoft is putting a massive amount of r&d effort in both libraries and  development tools, although he believes none of the java ide vendors are  getting too comfortable and resting on their laurels: i am very glad to see that the mistaken old java mentality of  “release theapis first and then wait for the development tools of varying  quality to appear much later” is being aggressively replaced with  “release the apis and world-class development tools for them as soon as  possible”.
