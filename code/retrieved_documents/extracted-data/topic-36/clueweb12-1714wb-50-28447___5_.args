code completion is second to none and the features included are making netbeans the ide of choice for many people and i’m fast becoming one of them.the official announcement from the netbeans announcement email is: netbeans™ ide 6.1 supports a wide range of open source scripting technologies and offers improved performance.i’ve said before that netbeans 6 is an important release for the netbeans team and i believe it is one of (if not the) best ide’s available for java, ruby and ruby on rails amongst others like the upcoming javafx.this release extends language support beyond java™ technology by providing a rich set of features for c/c++, javascript™ and the ruby language, including ruby on rails.this can be handy if you want to check your app in different versions of java or develop to a specific version, or even switch to a different version to troubleshoot environment issues you suspect are java related.netbeans ide 6.1 also contains all of the improvements made in 6.0 including: the new smarter editor, next generation of the ground-breaking gui builder (formerly known as project matisse), visual mobile designer, integrated profiler, and java™ ee 5 support.i have not been keeping up so well with this version and so i’m a little out of the loop on all the changes but i understand that they have been working hard on improving the javascript capabilities, from what i can tell this is mostly in the intellisense.i still like aptana’s javascript css and html handling so won’t be giving it up just yet but for ruby, rails and java, netbeans 6 is my tool of choice.if you are an ubuntu user and you use java you would benefit from some cool tips i’ve found while browsing the ubuntu forums of late.i like netbeans 6, as a ruby development ide it is quite simply amazing and though i am an aptana advocate even i have to admit that netbeans does it better.while i like netbeans 6 and personally i am really happy with it having moved from eclipse, there is, as always, a flip side to every coin so in the interests of balancing things,this post on the java tutorials weblog is asking for votes to bring back the beans module that is missing from netbeans 6.unfortunately despite installing sun’s jdk the java system may not be fully utilising it.there’s a handy plugin that will convert eclipse apps over to netbeans – just in case you are worried about switching ;0) picture taken from netbeans anouncement email technorati tags: netbeans 6 netbeans 6 is getting closer to full release, rc1 is available to download fromnetbeans.org today.since 6.1 is supposed to improve javascript in netbeans i shall have to take a look.this release did remind me that i was going to take a look and see if i could get netbeans to play nice with some of the javascript libraries out there and i never did, apologies to those who were waiting for me to pull my finger out.
