perhaps because of its exotic name or because it is so easy to implement.
in bubble sort we've to compare each two adjacent elements here “2″ appears to be less than “4″, so it is considered lighter and it continues to bubble to the surface (the front of the array).
on his way to the surface the currently lightest item meets a heavier element.
thus the lightest element bubbles to the surface and at the end of each iteration it appears on the top.

share it with your friends:| more it’s weird that bubble sort is the most famous sorting algorithm in practice since it is one of the worst approaches for data sorting.
the problem with bubble sort is that you may have to swap a lot of elements.
dzone has great portals for python, cloud, nosql , andhtml5!
swapping is slow and that is the main reason not to use bubble sort
move forward and swap with each heavier item swapping is slow and that is the main reason not to use bubble sort

well, obviously after understanding the principles of this algorithm every developer, even a beginner, can implement it.

thus the lightest element bubbles to the surface and at the end of each iteration it appears on the top.
if the currently lightest element meets another item that is lighter, then the newest currently lightest element starts to bubble to the top.
the problem is that this algorithm needs a tremendous number of comaprisons and as we know already this can be slow.
implementation implementing bubble sort is easy.

we can easily see how ineffective bubble sort is.

bubble sort consists of comparing each pair of adjacent items.
new relic provides the resources and best practices to help you monitor these applications.
if there is a lighter element, then this item begins to bubble to the surface we can be sure that on each step the algorithm bubbles the lightest element so far
