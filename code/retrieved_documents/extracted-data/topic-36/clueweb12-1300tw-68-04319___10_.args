enterprise code search (ecs) tools can index massive amounts of internal code from many different scms, providing developers with easy-to-use search tools that can display formatted code.so while some organizations may have already figured out how to wholesale reuse some of their code, every organization has the opportunity to help their development teams develop new applications faster by providing them greater visibility into existing enterprise code bases.these tools have pre-built adapters to connect to and index code from leading scm products, and because they provide read-only access, can be implemented without impact to the actual scm systems.there is one type of tool that could help you take better advantage of internal and external code: enterprise code search.further, because up to 80% of the code in apps today can come from open source projects, being able to extend the search capability to include open source projects that live outside the organization also becomes important.the typical api has little documentation and few good examples, so it can be frustrating and time consuming for people to figure out how to use them successfully.and ecs tools can provide plug-ins for developer ides, further integrating code search into a developer’s every day experience.to accomplish this, developers would need an easy way to search for and view an api call within existing code stored in enterprise code repositories.while developers can leverage code search from within their local ide, they are limited to seeing what’s in their workspace.ecs tools can help organizations leverage years of development investments to lower the cost of today’s software development.and most of that code is locked up in a source control management system (scm) specific to an app or to an organization.code search - yes, they do make tools for thatthere is one type of tool that could help you take better advantage of internal and external code: enterprise code search.this is the reality for most large companies managing hundreds of millions of lines of code -- the majority of which was purpose-built to solve specific application problems.email views: 1999 we recommend these resources best practices for open source adoption best practices for building high performance development teams java enterprise performance micro focus silktest 2011 nosql for the enterprise enterprise source code – a multi-million dollar under-utilized asset when most people think about a company’s assets, source code doesn’t show up on the list.get an in depth comparison on three different cloud... birt 3.7 report design: eclipse-based bi and big data visualization eclipse business intelligence and reporting tools (birt) is an open source, eclipse-based reporting system that integrates with your java/j2ee... google app engine for java this dzone refcard provides an in depth introduction to the cloud computing technology, google app engine.
