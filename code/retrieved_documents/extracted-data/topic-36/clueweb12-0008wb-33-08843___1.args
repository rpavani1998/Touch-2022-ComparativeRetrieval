as a good developer should do, i started looking on eclipse’s bugzilla and after some wandering i finallyhit it.
i tried other plug-ins and even updating eclipse using the official way (help -> software update), but the behavior was the same.
eclipse plug-in installer kept failing on me complaining about some other plug-in dependencies breakage even that all i did was selecting android’s plug-in.
he told me that “europa is around for some time” and so “they would have run into it”..
