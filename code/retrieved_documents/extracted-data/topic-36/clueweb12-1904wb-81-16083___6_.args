another thing is the auto-compile feature, which on the fly compiles your code as you type and gives you instant feedback on errors.netbeans provides everything out-of-the-box, and integrates seamlessly with anything you throw at it.netbeans however, is much more programmer oriented, and let's the ide to shape itself how you think, instead of shaping your thoughts to match the ide.eclipse is by far the best ide in terms of plug-in support.user-view eclipse is more tool oriented, where netbeans is more programmer oriented.eclipse have some tools for gui designing, but they're nothing compared to matisse.for example, if you want to develop android applications, eclipse may be your only choice.the basic netbeans java package is slower than the basic eclipse j2ee package.but the reason for this is probably because netbeans loads a lot more plugins than eclipse does.and if you try to load eclipse with that many plugins, it'll eat up about 1 gb of memory instantly, and the loading time is, well, i've never managed to load eclipse, because it crashes.eclipse has a better refactoring support.it's easier to code using netbeans.the setup of eclipse will have specific instructions from the it support people.netbeans does have a plugin support, but the plug-in base is nothing compared to netbeans.netbeans however, isn't as rock solid as eclipse.
