i've been looking around; here's what i've found so far: - full plug-ins like visual micro for visual studio or avr tool for eclipse - makefile, here, here and there but with many stability issues hard to solve because ofthat specific cryptic language, - command-line arduino ide like the ino project, which simulates the arduino ide pre-process and avoid the horrendous makefile.

i don't think any of them "suck".
yes, this is  a great idea, but imho, java ide suck (explicitive deleted).

the last two solutions could address a larger number of ides, although they require customisation.
there has been some talk around here to customize the qt creator ide with the ability to talk to avrdude so that we can do 100% of our development in qt creator.

i'm considering now ino, which simulates the hidden dirty work done by the standard arduino ide of pre-processing libraries, building, linking, and uploading.
furthermore, i don't want to deal with many  different ides, each one with its own idiosyncrasies.

i think qt provides a better solution to the problem java tries to solve and qt creator is an awesome ide.
don't get me wrong, netbeans or eclipse are both far superior to mpide.

should be "is there a chipkit setup for mplab x ?
although the standard ide is fine and provides out-of-the-box, ready-to-use, instant-rewarding experience, i'm missing features for serious more development, such as: parameters tips, jump to definition, object hierarchy browser, refactoring among others.

afaik, qt designer has the luxury of  only providing support for c++, whereas, eclipse/netbeans support multiple  languages.

since mpide goes closer to arduino 1.0 and eclipse is available on windows / os x / linux, i hope the plug-in is going to address chipkit also.

but because chipkit  boards offer much more power in mhz, i/os, memory,imho they deserve a  more powerful ide with all the modern niceties.

mpide is setup for  chipkit.
also needed: a glimpse of debugging.
you should go  for it.
since mpide goes  closer to arduino 1.0 and eclipse is available on windows / os x / linux, i  hope the plug-in is going to address chipkit also.

i  can imagine that for an ide to be as flexible as eclipse is across  languages/platforms is quite a challenge.

i've been using the eclipse ide for years as well as other java and non-java ides like visual studio, netbeans, intellij, etc.
wouldn't it be easier and cheaper to supply a plug-in for a standard ide so let's go for a netbeans implementation.
i can tellhow painful developing the serial_lcd library has been.
before that, xcode requires some settings, either astandard project or a template —or even minimal template .

" mplab is microchip's ide for pics.
so you see the dilemma, not one shoe fits all.
but if ever have time to work on it i'll be using qt.
should be "is there a chipkit setup for mplab  x ?
i think qt provides a  better solution to the problem java tries to solve and qt creator is an awesome  ide.
