i think an ide represents a step of maturation and stability of a language and environment that makes it feasible to create a useful and complete ide.building it on java (instead of cocoa) allows them to leverage java components from their idea platform and the fantastic development skills they already have in the company.rubymine is built upon the intellij idea platform and brings together all of the essentialfeatures you'd expect of an ide (editor, debugging tools, source control integration, code completion, and so forth) along with lots of extra goodies specific to ruby, such as gui-based support for rspec and test::unit.but as projects get bigger, and the language supported more libraries, and more complicated features and so on, an ide was pretty much essential.that intellij has pursued their new ide is a great thing, not just because there are better options for those of us who need more than a fancy text editor, but also because it means rails is getting more real.in any case, it's interesting to see another "everything but the kitchen sink" cross-platform ruby ide to compete withradrails and netbeans , but if rubymine becomes a commercial application priced similarly to intellij idea, i can't see it becoming popular except with devoted idea users migrating to ruby, but hopefully jetbrains will pull something interesting out of the bag to make it a more interesting proposition.on a casual tryout of rubymine, i found it to be a little smoother than eclipse based ides, and although it's clearly not a fully native os x application (in terms of widgets) it looks pretty good.intellij idea beats the other editors hands-down in terms of speed, refactoring, ease of use and functionality (imo).i'd really like to see textmate to evolve into a generic ide for various languages with debugger and code hinting support.it's better then textmate but usability (code completion) is a complete failure.i actually thought the latest tracking system they were using for ruby itself was called rubymine, but i guess it's ruby-redmine. "because not all those products will include all the functionality of intellij idea, they can be much less expensive, and we can choose the price based on the target market.if you're paid for your coding time there's no reason not to invest some of it back into professional tools.i have been using intellij idea for 6 years now and it's clearly the best ide for java development.all the eclipse based ides are imho not stable enough (at least when using a mac).packages start from just Â£7/month on our mod_rails/apache stack hosted on fast uk servers and include free 24/7 support.
