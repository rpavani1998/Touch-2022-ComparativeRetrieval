oracle can't maintain 2 or 3 competing product lines (and i can only imagine the amount of internal politics between jdeveloper and netbeans teams, glassfish vs weblogic teams, etc).
i am hearing the hammering of netbeans coffin nails if this doesn't cease soon.
i think all of these products have a much better future than if ibm had bought sun.
i can easily see netbeans being recommended by oracle for developing consumer applications (desktop, mobile, embedded) on the java platform, with jdeveloper being recommended for developing enterprise applications (web, soa, mobile web).
from a perspective, every acquisition is partially anticompetitive.
dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!
that means he writes and searches for the finest developer content in the land so that you don't have to.
i believe that glassfish is here to stay, because jee is open sourced and needs a reference implementation, thus justifying the existence of two separate products.
no matter how hard i've tried in the past to stay angry at microsoft and embrace java and open source, all this with oracle may be the final staw for me.
netbeans is integrated and looks and feels like one toolset instead of the smattering of tools that it actually is.
that's why i've been wary of relying on sun's open source product lines (afraid all the funding for them would dry up sooner or later), preferring instead oss competitors that have proven to be successful on their own (jetty, spring, eclipse, etc.).
if these succeed then oracle will surely have a great portfolio.
oracle puts a disclaimer in the faq saying that this document is not a binding statement however, it is the first news we've heard on the fate of several popular sun technologies.
for netbeans, oracle didn't say anything, as "is expected to provide..." doesn't make clear who will fund this "expectation".
it is interesting to note that oracle is no longer a company that is just involved on the enterprise side.
so, if the acquisition doesn't take place, it will be much worse.
" glassfish oracle says it will "invest in aligning common infrastructure components and innovations" between oracle weblogic server and glassfish.
virtualization products oracle "expects" to continue sun's desktop virtualization products.
as a mysql user, tell me how i stand to benefit from my data storage tool being owned by a company that views mysql as something that eats millions of dollars per year in potential oracle database licensing?
basically the document published today doesn't say anything or just a few things.
but it is at the top of my short list should i need a full blown ee server that does not cost $25,000 per cpu.
i am not interested in becoming the step-children hidden in the back room of oracle.
i see this aquisition as highly anticompetitive if allowed to take place.
you can read more from them attheir website.
the nice thing about his plan is that netbeans, glassfish and virtualbox are all what some programmers need to fasten and improve the uses of these products.
"  a commercial license for openoffice will also be available to customers that require enterprise level support and tools.
oracle says it will actively support the glassfish community.

i find netbeans to be the best java ide there is.
in any case, the alternative was ibm (the "owner" of the eclipse foundation) or the failure - well, failure is anticompetitive by its very nature, as things mostly vanish in thin air.
as for oracle's plans on supporting java me and java embedded it is likely that they will support it, despite that fact that oracle haven't mentioned anything about it.
i'm sorry larry, your pr speak does nothing to convince me that there is anything even remotely altruistic in your intentions.
senior healthcare consultants programming groovy is easy to start with.
it just smells anticompetitive in every respect.
recently in the last few years oracle have started to get involved in the consumer side.
microsoft has major flaws but at least i won't have to worry about losing good tools to someone whose ego is larger than their world headquarters complex.
sun had to be acquired at this point, unfortunately -- as much as i'd have loved to see them succeed on their own.
i haven't tried to use it in quite some time so it could be better now, but it was garbage before so it could only go up in my opinion.
the plans are really something and i hope oracle will get all the support.
i hope i'm wrong, but i am afraid this will only last (most likely) till the first quarter when oracle fails to meet financial expectations.
i don't think oracle has any good product(s) for covering consumer virtualisation.
i just don't see an upside for developers or consumers, but possibly for oracle shareholders.
oracle makes it clear however, that jdeveloper is still "oracle's strategic development tool" for oracle fusion and future enterprise applications.

open office oracle will "continue developing and supporting openoffice as open source.
by the way, i also use virtualbox and open office, awsome tools.
as for netbeans it is most likely that oracle will continue its support and funding but will likely cut back on java ee support for the ide, and increase its javafx/java se/java me support.
i find it interesting to note that while oracle is touting the greatness of all its own junk while purchasing sun for pity it seems since oracle has vastly superior stuff, microsoft is announcing their embracing of eclipse developers in the windows 7 and windows server 2008 operating systems.
in each case, the wolf is not only watching the hen house, the wolf is trying to buy the whole farm.
oracle says that jdeveloper, enterprise pack, and netbeans will all be options "for pure java and java ee development.
they may not all have perfectly rosy futures, but better than sun just going belly up.
oracle has been a leader in the java community since the inception of the java programming language and already has the world’s largest investment in the java platform, which provides the foundation for its oracle fusion middleware products and its next-generation enterprise applications.
they were natually going to be acquired by someone in the industry.
