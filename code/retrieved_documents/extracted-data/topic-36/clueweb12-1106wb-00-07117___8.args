not only that, if you set a preference in one area, it might not be set in another, and may collide with another preference, sometime throwing errors, or shutting down the editor.
when things like this happen, i get pissed, and go looking for new tools.
in conclusion, because of problems i've had configuring colors with eclipse, even using theeclipse color theme plugin i wrote about in another post, i find myself using netbeans to write my code.
i wanted to set up my beloved work environment, back to open-source.
you can have both ide's running at the same time without conflicts.
if your a php developer, netbeans has integrated support for git, debugging, phpunit testing, phpdoc, smarty templates, symfony framework, and the zend framework.
netbeans initial start up screen netbeans is a java application and requires java to run, which is probably already loaded on your computer.
… and pdt seems to have lost the development momentum (i tested it 3 months ago the last time).
that is if you can download it intellij 11 is so awesome, that i have even bought it.
you have a choice to install netbeans with just the php bundle, which is what i did, since i do not do a lot of java work.
naturally, i downloaded eclipse pdt based on the helios release, on which zend studio is built.
so you don't have to reconfigure then again, you export your preferences and import them to the new eclipse environments.
the installation took about 5 minutes and netbeans came up quickly and easily.
if you do a feature by feature analysis of eclipse and netbeans, you'll find that both ide's pretty much have the same features and functionality.
you'll find several good articles on the web about this, so i won't go into individual features here.
netbeans seems like a new bmw sports car.
eclipse is like an old car that you keep fixing up, it's serviceable and runs good, but every once in a while, you get irritated, because something doesn't work right.

the installer downloads 46.6 mb, which grows to 152.5 mb on install.
setting preferences is straightforward and java development support is great.
you can set all colors and fonts for all languages at once, not like eclipse.
since zend studio costs money, as a newbie to my new company, i didn't see a lot of zend studio's installed.
i'm guessing zend studio preferences have problems with importing to eclipse.
i did an import of my zend studio preferences and then started changing some setting, and i had a hiccup.
the hiccup was eclipse balked at some setting i set, and blew away my entire workspace.
i had used eclipse before zend studio, and so this was pretty close to home.
since php is now an object-oriented language, like java, netbeans has incorporated php into its editor.
the netbeans 7.1 download and install was seamless.
in fact, i saw few ide's.
netbeans rocks, it has all of php developer needs… and very configurable i feel very much comfortable with netbeans.
you can set all colors and fonts for all languages at once, not like eclipse.
not saying that netbeans can do things that eclipse can’t – the same is true the other way around, but in my experience netbeans just is more intuitive to use.
btw netbeans settings preferences compared to intellij is not so good… i agree only that netbeans is more newbie friendly and you don’t have to know much about classpath and compiling/building to produce a working application.
by the way, my eclipse helios folder checks in at 390 mb.
netbeans initial start up screen netbeans is a java application and requires java to run, which is probably already loaded on your computer.
in the process of configuring eclipse, i, of course, started messing with preferences.
all the menus and functionality, except for some of the zend studio features, are the same.
netbeans seems like a new bmw sports car.
i trialed all the commercial ide’s/editors and so money really wasn’t an issue.

netbeans is like an editor with a little bit of sophisticated tool calling where eclipse really is an ide.
the installer downloads 46.6 mb, which grows to 152.5 mb on install.
netbeans feels integrated, not like your bringing up a separate application every time you go to a new area of the ide.
by the way, my eclipse helios folder checks in at 390 mb.
i give you that… for me netbeans is wisely written ide, very intuitive, effective, … i use netbeans for php and the support is awesome.
colors and fonts are configured in one tab, php in another tab.
naturally, i downloaded eclipse pdt based on the helios release, on which zend studio is built.
i downloaded the eclipse indigo 64bit and added the pdt plugin, and i find this version quicker, and much more stable.
one main argument for netbeans against eclipse+pdt: in netbeans you can format the sourcecode (and adapting your coding styles).
all the menus and functionality, except for some of the zend studio features, are the same.
colors and fonts are configured in one tab, php in another tab.
the feel you get while developing is also not as bloated and “old car” as you say from my perspective – eclipse is slow, too bloated, and clumsy.
most of the edits were done on a linux server running vim.
i have been using both eclipse and netbeans professionally (java), and when i can choose myself its a nobrainer: netbeans!netbeans do the same things as eclipse – but smoother and with all the stuff you need build in out of the box.

if you don't like netbeans, you can stay with eclipse, but in the process of using both, i think you'll find yourself gradually moving to netbeans as your ide of choice.

in eclipse+pdt i can only change the tab-space (at least i did not find anything else).

if your a php developer, netbeans has integrated support for git, debugging, phpunit testing, phpdoc, smarty templates, symfony framework, and the zend framework.
well, it comes down to the feel of the ide as your using them.
since php is now an object-oriented language, like java, netbeans has incorporated php into its editor.
http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3 i can not download netbean’s latest version it says “the requested url /netbeans/7.1/final/bundles/netbeans-7.1-ml-linux.sh was not found on this server.”

anyways netbeans is a great tool after all.
i did an import of my zend studio preferences and then started changing some setting, and i had a hiccup.
in the process of configuring eclipse, i, of course, started messing with preferences.
one of outcomes of switching jobs is you lose some of your favorite tools.
you'll find several good articles on the web about this, so i won't go into individual features here.
but when you want more control and more advanced stuff i’m pretty sure eclipse is the way to go.
i'm guessing zend studio preferences have problems with importing to eclipse.
the power of the internet a new site coming for php – a preview → netbeans 7.1 review posted on january 21, 2012 by dalev one of outcomes of switching jobs is you lose some of your favorite tools.
if your doing java development, netbeans should be your ide of choice, since it was built with java development in mind.
actually there is a funny alternative: aptana studio whicht is based on eclipse.
in conclusion, because of problems i've had configuring colors with eclipse, even using theeclipse color theme plugin i wrote about in another post, i find myself using netbeans to write my code.
in contrast, netbeans preferences are a pleasure.
when things like this happen, i get pissed, and go looking for new tools.
