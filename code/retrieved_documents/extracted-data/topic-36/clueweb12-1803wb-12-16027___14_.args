the ide also resynchronizes the projects automatically if the changes to the eclipse configuration are unambiguous and do not require your input.this dialog provides information about discrepancies between the project structure in eclipse and in netbeans and points out actions that you might need to take to correct the discrepancies.once you have the project imported, you can use either or both the netbeans and eclipse ides to edit, build, run, debug, and profile the project.this enables you to work on projects in netbeans even if everybody else on your team is working with eclipse.in most cases, this means that the netbeans project metadata will refer to sources and libraries with the same paths that are used by the eclipse metadata.therefore, checking out the project from a version control system on different machines should result in similar behavior both in netbeans and eclipse.you can customize this script according to the needs of your project.after creating a netbeans project from an eclipse project, you can work in the following ways: use netbeans on a team project where other developers are using eclipse.netbeans uses the sources and libraries in the original eclipse project folder but creates a separate folder to hold netbeans project metadata and build outputs.the import eclipse project wizard enables you to use netbeans to work on java desktop and web application projects that were created in eclipse and myeclipse.nbproject contains project metadata that enables others users to open the project in netbeans without having to import the project first.after creating a netbeans project from an eclipse project, you can work in the following ways: top when you import a project, the ide analyzes the eclipse project metadata and then creates a netbeans project based on that metadata.typically, it is better to store netbeans project data inside eclipse project folders.if you make a configuration change in the eclipse project, you can resynchronize the netbeans project.importing eclipse projects into netbeans ide contents the import eclipse project wizard how the import wizard works importing and configuring projects building and running a project netbeans project files to complete this tutorial, you need the following software and resources.
