encouraging collaboration among the core developers in the netbeans community is a sure way to drive improvements in performance and productivity on our platform.java ide are one of the most important piece of software for our developers which have important impacts on development productivity.netbeans is robust, reliable, fast and feature rich, and the pace of innovation is staggering.this solution provides a powerful and user-friendly infrastructure which makes it easy and comprehensible for users to configure even highly complex tariff and accounting models.these technologies have the most sophisticated and cost-effective tools for mobile platform development.java and netbeans provides the ideal platform needed to develop the specialized data collection and analysis tools needed to complete this mission.with the benefit of this two-way engineering relationship we have the support necessary to fully leverage the features of the netbeans ide in our development activities.the transformation engine's and unique ability to transform hierarchical data make it ideal for building corporate portals, business intelligence,crm applications, and b2b data exchange solutions.it provides users out-of-box capabilities to efficiently and proactively manage any network of any size.we use netbeans in the our laboratories, as a "platform" for to teach java to students because netbeans have a simplified and intuitive gui, an user-friendly ide configuration, an editor enhancements including an error stripe and java hints, enhanced debugging - features that helps teachers and students in its tasks and studies.refactorit helps analyze large codebases quickly and efficiently by identifying the best opportunities for refactoring and automating the code regeneration process.yworks has brought together efficient data structures, complex algorithms, and advanced techniques that provide excellent user interaction.this allows the user to experience highly versatile and sophisticated diagram visualization in applications across many diverse areas.it layouts any valid java source code according to some widely configurable rules - to meet a certain coding style without putting a formatting burden on individual developers.with the introduction of the netbeans platform as base for its tool development, nokia hopes to boost the network operator's efficiency in carrying out network management tasks just in the same way as integrated development environments (ides) boost software development productivity.
