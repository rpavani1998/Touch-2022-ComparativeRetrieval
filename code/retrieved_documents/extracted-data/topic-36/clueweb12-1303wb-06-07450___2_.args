these files can coexist in one project directory.netbeans detects the existing build.xml and offers an alternative name, nbbuild.xml.in this demo we're going to use the spring countries sample application that ships with the spring framework to demonstrate how easy it is for eclipse and netbeans to work side-by-side.eclipse will detect that message properties has been changed and prompt you to reload the file.(note, netbeans automatically detects the proper content directory name.)there is a spring plugin for netbeans - the ides are similar, although we consider netbeans as more intuitive and less annoying prerequisities - jdk5 or jdk6 - netbeans 6.0 m10 or higher (because of the spring plugin) setup - install eclipse europa for java ee developers from eclipse.org - install aspectj development tools - help > software updates > find and install > search for new features to install > europa discovery site > finish.the migration to netbeans was painless this time, but mention that this might not be the case if the application would have a non-standard project structure or use custom build scripts.also, trying to delete the build directory from eclipse only deletes the classes, not the actually build directory.mention that this is a great feature in netbeans for monitoring requests and responses.these tasks were taken care of using the regular project type but need to be defined using the free-form project type.free-form project demo the point of this demo is to show the additional complexity imposed by choosing to use free-form projects.this demo script is part of the netbeans world tour 2008 session #2, using netbeans for your existing projects.- netbeans detects the existing build.xml and offers an alternative name, nbbuild.xml.configure the project for netbeans create a new web application with existing sources.spring module features show basic features of the spring module: go to the project properties and frameworks.
