netbeans is easier to learn and very simple to create a new project in, either from existing sources or from scratch.netbeans is set up to work with multiple programming languages, and the learning curve is shallow, so i can do just about anything i need to (except for perl or matlab, which probably should be avoided anyway).i prefer programming in java when i have my druthers, and the gui builder makes it a breeze to make graphical java applications (i can’t stress how useful the gui builder is).in the article: migrating to eclipse: a developer’s guide to evaluating eclipse vs. netbeans, the author shows the differences between the two ides.so i expect more people to sing its praises just because they have more experience with it and know how to do the snazzy things with it that netbeans hasn’t caught up to yet.i prefer netbeans a little more than eclipse as i have been using it longer and am more comfortable with it.the end user gets two very good ides.oh, and svn support built in is pretty sweet, too (though i seem to have trouble getting my windows vista machine to connect to anything with remote ssh, i don’t think that’s a netbeans issue).so that the competition between eclipse and netbeans stays fierce and there is no clear winner.i have enjoyed working with both tools and as such don’t have a clear favorite.
