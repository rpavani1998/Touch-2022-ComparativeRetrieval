so long as they can stay ahead of eclipse and netbeans in the few areas where they really shine, and thereby capture a consistent (if small) market share, i think they can still have a profitable concern.“eclipse has a wide lead in ide plugins because their ide and their tools for writing plugins were better…” as an aside, i think the goal of writing a plugin once for both platforms is a laudable goal, but for all kinds of technical and architectural reasons, won’t be fully realized.it will be as natural as debugging, and a whole new class of software errors will become a whole lot easier to address.just having decent xml syntax completion should be adequate.i guess it depends on your perspective, but i’d consider v-builder a major product it’s important to notice that bea, borland, and nokia are all working on features to help ide catch up to netbeans in the web and mobile space.i think the main reason it’s a separate product right now is that it requires jdk 5.0, and the core netbeans project must remain 1.4-compliant.it allows you to model graphically conversations between humans and computers, and generate voicexml to implement the call flow.i’d consider v-builder a major product it’s important to notice that bea, borland, and nokia are all working on features to help ide catch up to netbeans in the web and mobile space.the netbeans guys are continually adding new refactorings and tweaking the usability of the editor, both areas where eclipse has historically had higher marks.eclipse has a wide lead in ide plugins because their ide was better (let’s face it, it was), and because their tools for writing plugins were better.more and more i hear people interested in writing ide plugins that will work on both eclipse and netbeans.you can profile pieces of your application, thereby reducing the performance impact.netbeans is obviously easier to use and has more features out of the box.ide market share will drive the plugin community, not the other way around.in 4.0, the netbeans ide finally became better for developing netbeans platform modules.
