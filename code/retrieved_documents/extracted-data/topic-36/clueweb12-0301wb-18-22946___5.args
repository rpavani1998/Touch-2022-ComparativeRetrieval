rubymine sounds interesting.
i also have used apatana (fka radrails) and while it has gotten better, it's clunky eclipse baggage is very apparent.
this is exciting news.
rubymine is built upon the intellij idea platform and brings together all of the essentialfeatures you'd expect of an ide (editor, debugging tools, source control integration, code completion, and so forth) along with lots of extra goodies specific to ruby, such as gui-based support for rspec and test::unit.
up and running, the ide seemed to do the trick, but i didn't go too far as i'm not a big fan of ide-based development.
with jruby built in, i expect to soon be able to write ruby inspections in ruby itself.
i am a huge netbeans fan but cannot help be very impressed by rubymine.
i actually thought the latest tracking system they were using for ruby itself was called rubymine, but i guess it's ruby-redmine. "because not all those products will include all the functionality of intellij idea, they can be much less expensive, and we can choose the price based on the target market.
if you're paid for your coding time there's no reason not to invest some of it back into professional tools.
it's better then textmate but usability (code completion) is a complete failure.
this was on os x only, so your mileage may vary.
i really like netbeans and its ruby features are really great, but being a java application makes it painfully slow sometimes, so that i went back to textmate some time ago.
intellij idea beats the other editors hands-down in terms of speed, refactoring, ease of use and functionality (imo).
packages start from just £7/month on our mod_rails/apache stack hosted on fast uk servers and include free 24/7 support.
in any case, it's interesting to see another "everything but the kitchen sink" cross-platform ruby ide to compete withradrails and netbeans , but if rubymine becomes a commercial application priced similarly to intellij idea, i can't see it becoming popular except with devoted idea users migrating to ruby, but hopefully jetbrains will pull something interesting out of the bag to make it a more interesting proposition.
(what will be really cool, of course, will be when the first ide for rails is written in ruby ... and it is fast and stable).
lets hope the price is attractive enough to warrant an impulse purchase (hint hint).

the pricing of rubymine wasn't officially announced yet, but i can say that the price of rubymine will be much closer to the price of textmate rather than intellij idea.

$249 may sound steep, but it's worth every cent.
on a casual tryout of rubymine, i found it to be a little smoother than eclipse based ides, and although it's clearly not a fully native os x application (in terms of widgets) it looks pretty good.
building it on java (instead of cocoa) allows them to leverage java components from their idea platform and the fantastic development skills they already have in the company.
the new products can be much slimmer, lighter, and easier to get started with.
that intellij has pursued their new ide is a great thing, not just because there are better options for those of us who need more than a fancy text editor, but also because it means rails is getting more real.
intellij idea is the best java ide around, period.
and developers don't get the stuff they don't care about.

strike that, idea is one of the best editors for any supported languages.
also, code inspections.
but as projects get bigger, and the language supported more libraries, and more complicated features and so on, an ide was pretty much essential.
i think an ide represents a step of maturation and stability of a language and environment that makes it feasible to create a useful and complete ide.
all the eclipse based ides are imho not stable enough (at least when using a mac).
i think it will be tough for a commercial product to get significant market share.
one thing about eclipse that bothers me to madness is how inconsistent editors can be.
as a commercial developer tools vendor, i suspect jetbrains will most be charging for rubymine when it's finalized.
in idea this isn't a problem, the editor behaves consistently in all supported languages.
i have been using intellij idea for 6 years now and it's clearly the best ide for java development.

i had nothing but respect for his aptitude and supreme vi skills, but at some level it just seemed wrong.
i'd really like to see textmate to evolve into a generic ide for various languages with debugger and code hinting support.
