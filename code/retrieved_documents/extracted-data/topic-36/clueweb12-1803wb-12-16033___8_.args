this flexibility makes it easier for you to handle the following situations: you create a project and need to make it available and buildable to other users, whether they use the ide or not.the ide also uses classpath settings to enable code completion, automatic highlighting of compilation errors, and refactoring.all of the normal xml search tools, selection tools, and keyboard shortcuts are available for editing ant scripts, and the ide provides code completion for all standard ant tasks.the ide contains the following standard project templates for java and java web applications: in addition, the ide also contains templates for ejb modules, enterprise applications, java me applications, and more.this enables you to test and debug your application without having to wait for the application to be built first.compile on save the ide's compile on save feature enables you to save time when you are running and debugging projects in the ide.when enabled, the compile on save feature has the following effects: the ide compiles your files as you save them so that your project is always ready to run or debug in the ide.the ide's compile on save feature enables you to save time when you are running and debugging projects in the ide.in standard java projects, the ide maintains separate classpaths for compiling and running your project, as well as compiling and running junit tests (for java se applications).building applications this section explains how to build standard projects in the ide, how to do basic customizations to the build process, and how to handle compilation errors.if the compile on save feature is enabled for a java project (or the deploy on save feature is enabled for a java web or enterprise project), the ide compiles your files automatically when you save them.to register a new java platform: to switch the target jdk of a standard project: adding a group of class files to a project's classpath tells the ide which classes the project should have access to during compilation and execution.adding a group of class files to a project's classpath tells the ide which classes the project should have access to during compilation and execution.another potential inconvenience is that libraries are stored in a variety of locations, based on where they originate.as the netbeans ide project system is ant-based, netbeans projects are already generally portable between different users, whether or not they use the ide.
