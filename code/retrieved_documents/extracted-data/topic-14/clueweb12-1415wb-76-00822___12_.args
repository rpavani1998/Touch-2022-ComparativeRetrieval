for some acute diseases, such as viral infections, western doctors and medication do not seem to provide a cure -- but chinese medicine offers some help.on the practical level it may give us treatments for certain diseases -- herbs, or acupuncture therapy for stroke patients, for example.chinese medicine stresses the human capability to resist disease.it would be great if these graduates could then be incorporated into a cpasr where they would continue to receive loving support and possibly become part of an international effort to master cancer and all other diseases and human traumas.western medicine is effective in treating the ulcer, but a combination of both western and chinese medicine produces an even better effect.the task was to teach patients to stay healthy by living correctly; temperament, diet, thoughts, emotions, and exercise were all important in a system in which the patient took primary responsibility for sickness or health.it reduces the stress of cancer and reinforces that even the scarred body can be touched in a caring way.but it does mean that the complementary or adjunctive or healing approaches, which may support quality of life, and, potentially, extend life for some people, are not curative in any systematic way.medicine as a primary social and individual concern would be impacted in numerous ways by this re-orientation.i have enormous respect for biomedicine, and i see it as the great contribution of modern science to the treatment of disease.and they not only taught you about diet and exercise, but also guided you psychologically and spiritually to become a better person, because that would shape your health.they have tried herbs, needles, and pressure points and have observed that in some instances those things helped individuals with particular illnesses.as a physician, i was taught that you touch people only to diagnose them, and if you touch them in any other way, even in a comforting way, they may misunderstand.so the recovery of that wisdom and compassion, both on the part of the physician or the healer and on the part of the person with the illness, is one of the most important things we can do in medicine.but we did a special clinical study, and external chi gong treatment proved to be effective, particularly with cardiovascular diseases, digestive diseases, and neurosis.
