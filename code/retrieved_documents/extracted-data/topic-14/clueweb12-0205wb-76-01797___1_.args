a woman wants to be as hormonally balanced, and as physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy as possible before any invasive medical intervention, especially one involving the injection of significant amounts of hormones.in fact, our integrated dynamic fertility™ program prepares you physically and emotionally for western fertility treatments and relieves the side effects of the medications given as well as increasing the chances of successful conception and birth by 40% to 60%.in traditional chinese medicine, very few people are considered to be truly infertile, but are merely imbalanced.however, we know that sometimes there are mechanical and anatomically organic reasons why a woman will not be able to conceive naturally, but through western fertility treatments, can still give birth to their own child.that way, through the use of safe, effective, natural methods, we can balance and harmonize her body’s energy, blood and organ functions to produce the best art response.the birth and post partum period is generally also medically uneventful, and thus pleasurable for the new mom and new dad.however, our treatments will support you physically, mentally, and spiritually through the fertility procedures.western trained physicians usually like the fact that we focus on stress reduction and help relieve the side-effects of their medications and procedures.art is very stressful physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually to a woman.we explain to potential patients that they should allow at least 90 days or three menstrual cycles (ideally six months, if possible) before they start their art treatments.remember, once the woman’s underlying root cause for her fertility problems is uncovered and dealt with, conception can occur naturally most of the time.most of the women we see in our clinic have sought us out after repeated failure of art, the acronym for assisted reproductive technology—better known as western fertility treatments such as iui (intra-uterine insemination) and ivf (in vitro fertilization) among other treatments.most doctors are receptive to our treatments with their patients.this is due to our program of keeping a woman’s body in balance during the pregnancy.to further address the process of working with your western physician, we send your doctor a letter informing them we are working with their patient.
