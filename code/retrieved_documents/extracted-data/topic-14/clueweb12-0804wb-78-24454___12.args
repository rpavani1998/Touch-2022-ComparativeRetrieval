i then went on to southern and extremely rural belize in central america-you can imagine the culture shock.
i had plenty of opportunities to get more experience of the local culture but every time i would decline and go and hang out with the backpackers.
i did get to go to an evidence based medicine conference in san francisico as part of it though.
the pacific ocean half a mile away didn’t hurt either!
this surprised me as the picture older students had painted of american electives involved being made to stand in the corner with your hands tied for fear of being sued.
for me though, looking back after three years, i can’t help but feel that i could have made more out of it.
it is supposed to be – it’s the big carrot that is waved in front of you for five years to get you through the embryology and histology lectures.
the clinics were a different story, but interestingly the most common thing i saw was hypertension, which is a huge problem in fiji thanks to an unfortunate combination of genetic predisposition and fondness for fast foods.
the treatments available weren’t great – they got their supplies from charities based in new zealand and when they ran out of one thing they just had to move to another.

the locals soon got to recognise me on the street and would shout “ennui”, meaning doctor, as took my daily walks to and from the hospital along a road with beautiful views out to sea.
i was the only brit in a group of final year medical students and we met 4 nights a week for seminars.
a fusion of traditional chinese and high tech western medicine.
the genres of medicine i observed were also polar opposites.
so if you’re about to go on your elective and you’re going so you can experience a different culture, my advice would be to resist the temptation to hang out with people from back home, and get off the tourist trail.
well, if i was to go again i think i would try harder to push myself.
i did get involved researches and medical aid posts in high himalayas of my country (nepal).
but we have electives from england, germany, scandanavian countries and some from france in my teaching hospital.
the clinicians were all md's who had also trained in traditional chinese medicine (for another three years at least!).
they were extremely welcoming and friendly and would take me out in the evenings and at weekends.

i was allowed to clerk patients and help administer therapies and was really involved in the team.

i'm sure they have very different experience like yours by coming in developing countries like nepal!
alternatively, you can immerse yourself in the healthcare of a truly foreign environment.
my personal favorite was later in training, during residency, when i went to cuba for nearly 2 months.
we don't have that kind of culture of electives in the universities here in nepal (very very rare!!!)
the wards were quite empty in general as anything serious was helicoptered out to the mainland.
in condition to repeat the internship.
i also spent far too long reading a textbook as the fear of finals was growing.
for an american, this was a particularly unique experience - we're not allowed over there except under special programs.
one was being first out of the hostel in the morning to go to work, and the police removing the body of a dead tramp from the doorstep.

i organised the placement through ucla, they literally have hundreds of courses available in any area you can imagine-highly recommended!
i arrived in la on the sunday and somehow navigated the bus system through the second largest city in the states on a monday morning to santa monica.
many of the local parents were very keen to have their children circumcised by the “white doctor” and i was glad to get a bit more involved in things (most of the locals didn’t speak much english so out-patients soon lost its novelty).
ok ok so it might sound a little "la" but the combination was really appealing to me as someone who would always prefer to try something natural and less toxic that some of the things we're prescribed.
in the mornings there was a ward round and clinic.
i had plenty of opportunities to get more experience of the local culture but every time i would decline and go and hang out with the backpackers.
contrary to what i was informed prior to arrival i was actually encouraged to take a hands on approach.
i still enjoy telling my non-doctor friends about these operations and seeing the looks of horror on their faces.

i shadowed a doctor who worked for st vincents and went to clinics with her to hostels for homeless people off times square, women refuges, hiv clinics and clinics for people with serious menatl health problems off wall street and palliative care (in the bronx).
having said that i thoroughly enjoyed my placements last summer.

second was going out for a meal with the bmj staff - local and from london, and being entertained by richard smith (former editor) telling crazy stories.

if anyone wants an elective in rural india, i could put you in touch with an amazing woman who runs a rural weaving collective and attendant hospital/clinic.
i leaned alot from my experiences and remain passionate about the city
i learnt acupuncture, cupping, acupressure massage and trigger point injections (a kind of supersized western acupuncture).
i also spent far too long reading a textbook as the fear of finals was growing.
i stayed at the royal hotel, a beautiful old colonial hotel frequented by backpackers.
common conditions changed over night from laptop induced neck pain and headaches only relieved by botox to scabies and diarrhoea.
so if you’re about to go on your elective and you’re going so you can experience a different culture, my advice would be to resist the temptation to hang out with people from back home, and get off the tourist trail.
you can go with some friends with the aim of clearing off after a couple of weeks in a hospital and learn a foreign language or how to surf.

the doctors and staff at the hospital were all fantastic.

i even mastered the basics of reading tongues.
your elective sounds amazing.
i was attached to the integrative east-west medical centre, an air-conditioned glass and white walled haven of a workplace.
