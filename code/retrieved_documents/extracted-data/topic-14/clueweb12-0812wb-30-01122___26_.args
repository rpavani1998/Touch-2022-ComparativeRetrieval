the reason we practice medicine in whatever form or research in medically related fields, should be to relieve human suffering by providing relief of disease and its symptoms by using a method that is most effective, least invasive, most humane, cost effective and producing the least unwanted side effects.western medicine is responsible for hundreds of thousands of iatrogenic injuries and deaths per year while cam is only implicated in a handful.but it is lucrative and helps support a health system where costs have blown out of control and people have increasing levels of chronic degenerative disease.vaccination may help prevent the diseases for which a person is vaccinated for, however, overall there is a theory that they have undesirable side effects generally on a person's overall health, many people developing auto-immune diseases.they purpose of medicine is not to make new scientific discoveries and to persecute practitioners of unconventional techniques, it is to aid the patient in improving their health.in some countries where there is a very low standard of living vaccinations can save lives, but the better solution is to improve nutrition.there is no good evidence that either nutritional remedies or salts have any effect on survival in bacterial infections, or reducing the incidence or duration of bacterial infections (there is some weak evidence that cranberry juice might have a preventative effect for urinary tract infection in young, but not elderly women, but this still requires more evidence).by subjecting alternative medicines to rigorous research in the university environment, medicine is improving all the time.allopathic remedies aren't holistic and not good in the long run, but they are profitable.like western medicine, chinese medicine has also evolved from thousands of years of intuition, trial and error, serendipity, case studies, scholarly advances, experiments etc.many of these nutrients should be viewed as medicines and, indeed, are sometimes the main constituents of some patented drugs.conventional allopathic medicine rails against cam but shouldn't because there are so many diseases that conventional has no cure for and often the best drug-based medicine can do is ease a person's suffering.neither medicine has all the answers and neither should they claim too, the community will make their own decision in the long run as to which modality of medicine they choose to put their faith and dollars into, we should definitely encourage medicine research in both areas through increased availability of university course to improve the health of everyone.they have a legal (and i would say ethical and moral) obligation to prove effectiveness and safety before they go to market with a product.many people have died from taking too much, but if you survive, effects can include include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, tinnitus, and nystagmus.
