this is an opportunity to build safe, affordable and effective national health systems, especially for third world countries rich in both medicinal plant resources and traditional knowledge.traditional chinese medicine (tcm) is fully institutionalised and supported by the chinese government, and very much a part of the contemporary chinese healthcare system.although most chinese people may believe in the superior diagnostic powers of western biomedicine, many prefer tcm treatments particularly for chronic diseases where the side effects of western biomedicine are seen, rightly, to often far outweigh the benefits.chinese people take responsibility for their own health most seriously, and the use of medicine and disease prevention forms a continuum with food and nutrition.the chinese government is pressing hard for the systematisation of tcm disease categories, diagnostic standards, and therapeutic techniques, and to enforce a more stringent evaluation of therapeutic outcomes.western biomedical concepts and ideas have been assimilated into chinese medicine, and western drugs are routinely prescribed in chinese-medicine wards and outpatients departments.traditional medicine in contemporary china traditional chinese medicine enjoys high status in china, which is good for the health of the nation.traditional chinese medicine enjoys high status in china, which is good for the health of the nation.one must remember, however, that tcm has thousands of years of accumulated experience and knowledge behind it, and the government’s support for it is crucial to prevent the kind of inter-professional struggles with the dominant western biomedical model that have impeded the wide adoption of traditional medicines in other countries such as malaysia and india.one must remember, however, that tcm has thousands of years of accumulated experience and knowledge behind it, and the governments support for it is crucial to prevent the kind of inter-professional struggles with the dominant western biomedical model that have impeded the wide adoption of traditional medicines in other countries such as malaysia and india.it delivers almost 40% of total healthcare services, and like western biomedicine, is predominantly based in hospitals.china will be closely watched as an example, for better or for worse, as she is actively pushing for global acceptance of her traditional remedies and competing in the global drugs market.more importantly, self-prescribed, ready-made chinese medicines are an important part of the people’s therapeutic regime.there are almost 3000 dedicated hospitals for tcm, and over 95% of western medical hospitals also have fully-fledged chinese medicine wards and outpatient departments.for example, there are efforts to prohibit the use of endangered species in preparation of tcm drugs, and to use research methods acceptable to the dominant international drugs market, although this may not be appropriate in many cases, and reflects an unquestioned acceptance of the dominant reductionist medical model (see globalisation chinese medicine, this series).
