in western medicine, the typical treatment will be an analgesic, such as aspirin, to dilate the affected blood vessels in the scalp.common symptoms of the mild wintry disorder include difficulty waking up in the morning, oversleeping or overeating, craving for carbohydrates (weight gain), lack of energy, difficulty concentrating which in turn leads to depression and pessimism.these points are described by acupunctured theory as targeting the face and head which are considered to be the most important points when treating disorders affecting the face and head.acupuncture is an amazing physical treatment and nowadays technology still cannot explain some of its concepts.some people turn to tanning beds to get their sunlight fix, which can also be effective in the treatment of sad, though not always healthy.only rich chinese citizens can afford private doctors.and those systems usually work in a balance to maintain the healthy function of the human body.unlike the western anatomical model, which divides the physical body into parts, the chinese model is more connected with function.but in acupuncture, a common treatment for such a headache is to stimulate the sensitive points that are located roughly in the center of webs between the thumbs and the palms of the patient’s hands.of course, there is always the choice of turning to drugs to help lift your mild winter depression, though personally not recommended.since the human body is defined as having many kinds of bodily fluids going through it, humans would get sick if these fluids couldn’t escape through certain points.one such treatment is light therapy, which uses a light box that emits full spectrum light at 10,000 lux.if you see a friend or a loved one showing symptoms of this disorder, steer clear.although western medical theorem replaced most parts of tcm, the medical system between china and america is still quite different.it is like the swine flu, always on the prowl, looking for its next victim.
