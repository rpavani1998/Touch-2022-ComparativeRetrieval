tcm physicians, for their part, face pressure from hospitals to use revenue-generating biomedical diagnostic facilities such as ultrasound and computed tomography.
a comprehensive dossier containing more than 160 fully referenced articles from the science in society archives.
at the same time, however, the scientific status of tcm is not being doubted, it is decreeda priori by the state.
traditional chinese medicine enjoys high status in china, which is good for the health of the nation.
it is defined as a national treasure, which might have further insulated it from debate as a science.
more importantly, self-prescribed, ready-made chinese medicines are an important part of the people’s therapeutic regime.

although most chinese people may believe in the superior diagnostic powers of western biomedicine, many prefer tcm treatments particularly for chronic diseases where the side effects of western biomedicine are seen, rightly, to often far outweigh the benefits.
there are almost 3000 dedicated hospitals for tcm, and over 95% of western medical hospitals also have fully-fledged chinese medicine wards and outpatient departments.
chinese people take responsibility for their own health most seriously, and the use of medicine and disease prevention forms a continuum with food and nutrition.
more importantly, self-prescribed, ready-made chinese medicines are an important part of the peoples therapeutic regime.
the chinese government is pressing hard for the systematisation of tcm disease categories, diagnostic standards, and therapeutic techniques, and to enforce a more stringent evaluation of therapeutic outcomes.
for example, there are efforts to prohibit the use of endangered species in preparation of tcm drugs, and to use research methods acceptable to the dominant international drugs market, although this may not be appropriate in many cases, and reflects an unquestioned acceptance of the dominant reductionist medical model (see globalisation chinese medicine, this series).

traditional chinese medicine (tcm) is fully institutionalised and supported by the chinese government, and very much a part of the contemporary chinese healthcare system.
one must remember, however, that tcm has thousands of years of accumulated experience and knowledge behind it, and the governments support for it is crucial to prevent the kind of inter-professional struggles with the dominant western biomedical model that have impeded the wide adoption of traditional medicines in other countries such as malaysia and india.
the need to promote positive perceptions of tcm abroad is forcing internal changes, nevertheless.
this is an opportunity to build safe, affordable and effective national health systems, especially for third world countries rich in both medicinal plant resources and traditional knowledge.

it delivers almost 40% of total healthcare services, and like western biomedicine, is predominantly based in hospitals.

this includes a bewildering array of quick dissolve herbal health drinks for treating or preventing a range of diseases, from cancer and diabetes to inflammation, influenza and toxicity; or else, like ginseng, they simply regulate the body to promote a general state of health.

china will be closely watched as an example, for better or for worse, as she is actively pushing for global acceptance of her traditional remedies and competing in the global drugs market.
