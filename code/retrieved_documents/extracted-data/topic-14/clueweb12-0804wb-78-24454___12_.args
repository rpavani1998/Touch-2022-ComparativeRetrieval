the clinics were a different story, but interestingly the most common thing i saw was hypertension, which is a huge problem in fiji thanks to an unfortunate combination of genetic predisposition and fondness for fast foods.common conditions changed over night from laptop induced neck pain and headaches only relieved by botox to scabies and diarrhoea.the treatments available weren’t great – they got their supplies from charities based in new zealand and when they ran out of one thing they just had to move to another.the clinicians were all md's who had also trained in traditional chinese medicine (for another three years at least!).you can go with some friends with the aim of clearing off after a couple of weeks in a hospital and learn a foreign language or how to surf.alternatively, you can immerse yourself in the healthcare of a truly foreign environment.i was allowed to clerk patients and help administer therapies and was really involved in the team.for an american, this was a particularly unique experience - we're not allowed over there except under special programs.many of the local parents were very keen to have their children circumcised by the “white doctor” and i was glad to get a bit more involved in things (most of the locals didn’t speak much english so out-patients soon lost its novelty).the locals soon got to recognise me on the street and would shout “ennui”, meaning doctor, as took my daily walks to and from the hospital along a road with beautiful views out to sea.ok ok so it might sound a little "la" but the combination was really appealing to me as someone who would always prefer to try something natural and less toxic that some of the things we're prescribed.i learnt acupuncture, cupping, acupressure massage and trigger point injections (a kind of supersized western acupuncture).so if you’re about to go on your elective and you’re going so you can experience a different culture, my advice would be to resist the temptation to hang out with people from back home, and get off the tourist trail.the genres of medicine i observed were also polar opposites.a fusion of traditional chinese and high tech western medicine.
