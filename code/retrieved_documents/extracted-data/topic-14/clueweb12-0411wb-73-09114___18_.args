many people can't reach a doctor and they die, particularly a lot of young children.there are a lot of people with severe headaches, other illnesses, etc.i myself don't have the wealth, but i have a very strong intention to help people by building this medical clinic.if we built a clinic there, it could provide care for 2,000 to 3,000 people.these were independent kingdoms, neither under tibet nor under china, and they all had equal status.the people in the community said that even though the chinese knew that she was trungpa rinpoche's mother, she hadn't committed any crime, so she was not to blame.in this interview karma senge rinpoche talks a little bit about the history of kyere gompa, the needs of the people in the region, and his plans to build a medical clinic there.i think this will really help us to begin to connect more fully to the mukpo family and the sangha in kyere.because of that they protected trungpa rinpoche's mother and family very well.if i could build this clinic, it's like the generosity of giving life, saving lives.there hasn't been any western medicine except for chinese medicine.i built a nunnery with her donations and she continues to send money every year.we have also provided a way for people to contribute towards this project.there are a lot of tibetan doctors and these days many people are sick.it's an expansive area and it's centrally located.
