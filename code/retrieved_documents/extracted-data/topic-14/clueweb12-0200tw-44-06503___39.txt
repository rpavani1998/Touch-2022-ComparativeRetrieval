one of the long-standing mysteries surrounding acupuncture is why the technique only seems to alleviate pain if needles are inserted at specific points.
electricity is applied in some circumstances, but rarely.
which could mean random.
it took a lot of time, waiting for my turn, getting the needles and chatting with the doctor about regimen and mental health.
of course, the acupuncture industry isn't going to let go that easily, and interprets such results with truculence: "see," they cry, "acupuncture is so great that evenplacebo acupuncture works!
on rare occasion, yes.
scientists and sceptics alike have no problem with the possibility that acupuncture has a painkilling effect, so this study doesn't contradict them.

as a practical matter, i don't really care if acupuncture is a placebo (i don't think it is).
after a half-hour session, the mice felt less discomfort in their paws because the needles triggered the release of a natural painkiller, say the researchers.
it was probably a pinched/trapped nerve i had about that time that didn't fully go away.
blind quasi-religious belief that 'western' medicine is the only sensible option to treat medical ailments is both ignorant and dangerous.
the acupunture had no effect at all in either group if the needles were not  rotated.
i am no scientist and have no vested interest, i only went for the treatment in desparation because the 'conventional' drugs really didnt work.
nobody suggested that western medicine (you know, the real science is not good) is backward or bad, every single treatment should eventually be able to have a scientific explanation, but it doesn't mean that we should reject acupuncture totally.

is there any science on dogs benefiting from a placebo effect?
the  more pain the mice were in, the faster they pulled away.
therefore, all those diseases are not eradicated, they are just suppressed - mutating and waiting for a future generation of humans to wipe out.

gelion sadly yours is the mumbo jumbo.
it's not very scientific.
"because it has not been  understood completely, many people have remained sceptical."
in the majority of cases this is harmless.
the fact that the placebo effect is so powerful and that the human mind is hard wired to detect causality when none exists, means that these charlatans can continue fleecing people.
we can benefit from what has been learned over many thousands of years," nedergaard told the guardian.
further tests on the mice revealed that levels of adenosine surged 24-fold in the tissues around the acupuncture needles during and immediately after each session.
i remember some time ago a study showing that acupuncture was a placebo.
when jenner was under examination by a committee of the college of physicians in 1806, he was pressed hard for a definition of spurious cowpox, when he "owned up."
but then you could just as easily choose anywhere else, as the previous study proved (notwithstanding the mumbo-jumbo about qi and magic meridians connecting your middle toe with your tonsils or whatever).
it avoids me taking a pain killer almost every day, which over time will not be good for the rest of my body.
it just underlines how far western civilization has come in 400 years, and really how stuck non experimental and non-observational medicine remains.
seems a bit unnecessary when so many people are choosing to have acupuncture.
traditional practitioners claim acupuncture works by improving the flow of  "qi energy" along "meridians", butthe latest research,  published in nature neuroscience, points to a less mystical explanation.
without adenosine receptors, the chemical will have no effect on the mice when it is released in their bodies.
needles are not twisted on a regular basis.
choosing the knee to stop foot pain makes sense because the knee is between the source of the pain and its destination (the brain).
the drug, called deoxycoformycin, boosted the effects of acupuncture dramatically, more than  tripling how long the pain relief lasted.

the words had been employed, not to describe any irregularity on the part of the cow, but certain irregularities in the action of cowpox on the part of the vaccinated : which was to say that when the vaccinated recovered creditably and did not catch smallpox, the cowpox was genuine; but when the sequences were otherwise, why then it was spurious!

i had pins in the soft tissue between the thumb and index finger and when the pins were twiddled i felt such a surge of something through my body, much like an electric shock, that my whole body jolted up off the table.
how is chinese medicine 'non experimental' and non-observational'?

i'd also make sure that multiple medications shouldn't be conflicting, so ensuring anyone administering you knows what else you're being treated for.

i get the picture, west is best, always bet on the west, esp.
it is also highly individual, so there is no right answer for everyone, just a right answer for an individual.
i would consider a lot of the truly "alternative" therapies in the second category, along with things like counseling, religion, team sports and recreation drug use.
nedergaard said that twisting the needles seems to cause enough damage to  make cells release adenosine.
one needle inserted into a specific place on that muscle sent what can only be described as an electric shock through it, and with exercise for a few days to prevent re-spasming, my knee is functioning normally.
acupuncture works on the meridians an energy network that will baffle and annoy the flat earth western medical fraternity - acupuncture and tcm have been practiced for thousands of years and they are massively popular in asia because they work.
in effect, the muscle had atrophied and had stopped working.

all of the three acupuncturists that i have used have been quick to refer a patient to a western trained doctor for issues that they can better address.
so there's a place for all types of medicine in this world, we don't just have to rely on a prescription sheet with unreadable writing on it.
nedergaard believes that most of these points are along major nerve tracks, and as such are parts of the body that have plenty of adenosine receptors."....except that this study http://www.docbug.com/blog/archives/000353.html showed that random acupuncture works as well as formal acupuncture as a pain killer- in other wordsit doesnt work any better if the needles are just stuck in anywhere so bang goes the adenosine receptor theory 30 may 2010 7:44pm

only 2nd in amazement after being able to see properly with no glasses after laser eye surgery.
the needles stimulated cells to produce adenosine, an  anti-inflammatory and painkilling chemical, that was effective for up to an  hour after the therapy was over.
western medical science never works on the causes and prevention, it concentrates itself exclusively on symptoms.
peer review etc is great but western medicine has a rough history of horrors from thalidomide to shock treatment - our medical approach is totally different and has caused massive amounts of harm - scientific thought 100 years ago seems horrific and ridiculous now where as chinese medicine has a much longer and deeper history and does not use such invasive techniques - it is also based on the study of living healthy humans with the goal being to maintain that healthy state rather than being based on the study of cadavers and focused on the already sick.

it is an activity that relies on values measurable by its own standards which works magically in short term, but is disasterous in long one, as it is painfully obvious these days.
if they had they would know that the 'needle' used is not really a needle, but a thread of steel, so fine that it is absolutely painless when inserted.
it takes all sorts, but it really boils down to having some human contact, and a belief in something greater than oneself, so it's all ok.
if someone is still looking for a treatment.
without adenosine receptors, the  chemical will have no effect on the mice when it is released in their bodies.

thumbs up for the western medicine back pain?
perhaps the "we say 'oops it's not like that after all' every fifty years" method?
nedergaard believes that most of these points are along major nerve  tracks, and as such are parts of the body that have plenty of adenosine  receptors.
sometimes i wonder if the acupuncture treament, which i took instead of antiretroviral treatment that in the early 90's was a living hell, didn't prepare the terrain for a smooth antiretroviral treatment in the following years.

my knee was not bending in the correct manner due to my m. vastus medialis (the muscle of the inner thigh) being inoperable due to a spasm previously.
personally i don't consider chinese medicine especially "alternative".
tried acupuncture for one session and bingo - i could feel my little finger again!!

30 may 2010 10:01pm and really how stuck non experimental and non-observational medicine remains.
i'll take a painkiller thanks.
as is the suggestion that acupuncture is a ?painkiller?!
31 may 2010 6:16am western banking system, western democracy, western family values, western medicine etc etc.....

the therapy session involved inserting a fine needle into an acupuncture point in the knee above the sore foot.
even 'fake' acupuncture reduces the severity of headaches and migraines research shows an improvement in headache symptoms even when needles are placed incorrectly pinning down a remedy for backache ben goldacre: this week, a new study was published on acupuncture.
further tests on  the mice revealed that levels of adenosine surged 24-fold in the tissues around  the acupuncture needles during and immediately after each session.
one of the major issues with western medicine is that is totally profit driven - the ideal product for a drug company is one which will suppress symptoms while you use the product only to have them come back in full once you stop this creates a life long customer - a product that actually solved the problem would be bad as it would limit the potential sales.
i look forward to a time when science can start to measure subtle energies in the body and our understanding of the complexity of humanity gets much deeper than its current simplistic and shallow view.
i would rather have a none invasive technique solve the problem than take a drug which invades the whole body, e.g. the acupuncture i have about every 12 months eliminates the back pain (i have 3 lower back ruptured disks), or i can take 400 mg of ibuprofen every day for the same effect.
acupuncture is proven to be effective the central theme of chinese medicine is to try to find a natural way of healing disease, like researching the various healing potentials of herbs and even daily fruit and vegetables, whereas western medicine is taking a completely different approach which aims to acheive instant result through invasive or synthetic method.
homeopathy may be nonsense but that doesn't mean that every non-western treatment is.
anyone reading this story might like this piece from science blogger ed yong, which provides a useful critical reading of the research (and fair bit of context): http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/05/30/a-biological-basis-for-acupuncture-or-more-evidence-for-a-placebo-effect/ 30 may 2010 7:48pm would it not be better to work on a drug based on adenosine or cheaper versions of the cancer drug which boosts its effect... better still a drug which increases natural release.
after a half-hour session, the mice felt less discomfort in their paws  because the needles triggered the release of a natural painkiller, say the  researchers.
it's one thing to reject something when you actually know what you are talking about but quite another to reject it out of prejudice and ignorance.
and when we get to the proper placebo-controlled double-blinded trials, there's zero effect above placebo.
if pro-science people throw out scientific principles and can't be bothered to know about what they are talking about, then the whole thing is a stupid childish argument.
if they are self treating hayfever then no one is going to get hurt.
adenosine is a very potent anti-inflammatory compound and most  chronic pain is caused by inflammation," nedergaard said.
10:48pm proof of the effectivness of acupuncture on animals will not come as any surprise to clients of the several vets who have added acupuncture to their range of treatments.
chinese medicine has nothing whatsoever to do with homeopathy.
including medical advances such as numerous vaccines, the elimination of smallpox, women being much less likely to die in childbirth, organ donation, blood transfusion, anti-biotics etc.
i couldn't help myself but to bang with my fist against the leg.
that'll be Â£250 please!"
the drug, called deoxycoformycin, boosted the effects of acupuncture dramatically, more than tripling how long the pain relief lasted.
the world is still full with so many amazing things that we cannot comprehend and its worthwhile being open minded - open minded people are the ones who have created progress on earth and those who blindly adhere to orthodox opinions are the ones who killed galileo etc science is so important and valid but its worth remembering that todays scientific theories often seem ridiculous in 100 years time.
these are all side effects that i've suffered from western medicines.
some of the comments here seem to say 'we know acupuncture doesn't work because we are sure homeopathay doesn't work'.
but you just can't have it both ways.
in my case the acupuncture was an added 'boost' to the herbs which, over time, did the trick.
are you suggesting that it's a coincidence and not due to vaccination?
science's credentials are being destroyed by this combination of "i don't believe it because i haven't read it because it sounds bonkers, therefore it's rubbish".
the procedure involves inserting fine needles at specific points around the body and then heating, twisting or even electrifying them.
half of the mice lacked a gene that is needed to make  adenosine receptors, which are dotted along major nerves.
"because it has not been understood completely, many people have remained sceptical."
that journey began nigh on 40 years ago.
30 may 2010 9:30pm i remain hugely skeptical.
nedergaard believes that most of these points are along major nerve tracks, and as such are parts of the body that have plenty of adenosine receptors.
i am a full believer in good science, but when it comes to some of the more 'out there' things that could be tested, it seems a lot of scientists would rather shout 'impossible' than get on and actually do any real science on the matter.
the stated trial is supposed to be about dosage over time and delivery method, hence the testers believe they are testing active drugs.
i didn't have any success with homeopathy but it didn't bring me out in a rash, make me vomit, erode my stomach lining, crumble my bones, give me hot flushes, impair my memory, make my heart race, give me nightmares or make me halluninate.
lemming, 31 may 2010 5:21am even as an extreme sceptic, i wasn't aware that many scientists considered acupuncture to have no physiological effect.
between two identical operations i got myself fit and needed no post op analgesics and took nothing for pain for 2 weeks post op.
as for my personal experiences, caring about what i eat, and doing something that moves me around tend to sort out most of my ills.
interesting stuff... but a peer review is much needed will trepanning give similar results ? ...
it is almost as though ben goldacre never existed.
30 may 2010 8:58pm i think you will find it is called the scientific method.
the procedure  involves inserting fine needles at specific points around the body and then  heating, twisting or even electrifying them.
31 may 2010 12:01am agathe, my big problem with complimentary medicine is that it spouts a load of rubbish and a lot of very vulnerable people fall for it.
today, i take antiretroviral drugs to excellent results.
nedergaard said that twisting the needles seems to cause enough damage to make cells release adenosine.
an holistic approach is far more sensible and offers freedom to choose the right treatment for a certain problem.
31 may 2010 1:34am this isn't about 'western medicine' v 'eastern medicine', but about 'medicine' v 'crap that doesn't work'.
mishaps were so numerous that people became afraid of this omnipresent spurious cowpox, and to ask what it was, and how it could be avoided.
why get so hot under the collar?
31 may 2010 12:00am agathe, my big problem with complimentary medicine is that it spouts a load of rubbish and a lot of very vulnerable people fall for it.
10:55pm the question is not so much whether acupuncture, homeopathy, magnetotherapy, mesmer's electric bucket achieve their means thru placebo or by an actual physiological effect... but more: will health insurance providers accept their rationale as sufficiently legitimate to cover their costs.
turn autoplay off turn autoplay on please activate cookies in order to turn autoplay off study in mice suggests that acupuncture relieves pain not just through the placebo effect but also by stimulating cells to pump out the body's own painkiller scientists have performed acupuncture on mice with sore paws to pinpoint how the ancient chinese medical practice might alleviate pain in humans.
if someone wants to spend their own money buying sugar pills in the mistaken belief that homeopathy works then fine.
"i believe we've found the main mechanism by which acupuncture relieves pain.
nothing could be further from the thruth.
30 may 2010 8:26pm blind quasi-religious belief that 'western' medicine is the only sensible option to treat medical ailments is both ignorant and dangerous.
at least, it distracted my attention from the original pain.
