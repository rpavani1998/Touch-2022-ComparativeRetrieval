the fda said that neotame is a white crystalline powder that dissolves in  water and can be used as a mealtime sweetener or added to recipes.
the mount prospect, ill., company plans to sell it primarily to the  soft-drink and food industries rather than directly to consumers as a tabletop  sweetener.
"we don't think  there's going to be a 1-to-1 replacement," he said.
but mr. rosa said he doesn't see neotame, a white crystalline powder, taking the place of aspartame in the sweetener market.
comparable arguments could be made for aspartic acid and methanol, which i have addressed in many publications.
a more appropriate question is; "why  isn't the epa regulating it as a pesticide?" and yet  another question; "why should we believe that  anything the fda approves is safe?" complaints against  aspartame[nutrasweet] constitute 75% of all additive related complaints  relayed to the fda department of consumer complaints.
for example, these species metabolize phenylalamine 4-5 times faster than humans.
in determining the safety of neotame, fda reviewed data from more than 113 animal and human studies.
the main market is soft  drinks, dairy products including yogurt and frozen dairy desserts, and chewing  gum.
new food additives, including new sweeteners, must be approved by fda as safe before they may be marketed in the united states.

moreover, phenylalamine concentrates much more on the fetal side of the placenta, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to affect the fetus brain.
the agency and public should have the opportunity to review the additional data needed to address these issues, along with appropriate explanations prior to the issuance of a final rule.
from its evaluation of the neotame database, the fda was able to conclude that neotame is safe for human consumption.
thank you for your attention to this matter.
neotame was rolled out in australia and new zealand six months ago, and is  being used in soft drinks, yogurt and powdered gelatin mixes.
it has been approved for use in baked goods, nonalcoholic beverages, chewing gum, confections, frozen desserts, gelatins and puddings, jams, jellies, fruit, juices, toppings and syrups.

neotame is a non-nutritive, high  intensity sweetener that is manufactured by the nutrasweet company of mount  prospect, illinois.
nutrasweet president and chief executive nick e. rosa said the company  plans "to push really hard, really fast" in marketing neotame after  the fda formally publishes its approval tuesday.
a more appropriate question is; "why isn't the epa regulating it as a pesticide?"
neotame is a non-nutritive, high intensity sweetener that is manufactured by the nutrasweet company of mount prospect, illinois.
because of neotame's strength -- it usually would take 8,000 teaspoons of  sugar to equal the sweetening power of one teaspoon of neotame in most products  -- mr. rosa said the "economic benefit is extraordinary" for makers  of soft drinks and other products that use sugar substitutes.
the food and drug administration approved a new sweetener that it says is as much as 13,000 times sweeter than sugar.
the new sweetener, he  said, can be blended with regular sweeteners such as corn syrup as well as with  other sugar substitutes.
nutrasweet's aspartame, widely sold under the equal brand, had come under fire a few years ago when it believed to be a possible cause of brain tumors.
the safety studies were designed to identify possible  toxic effects, such as cancer-causing, reproductive, and neurological effects.
ii animal testing it isa gross error to project the animal studies onto humans where the massive consumption of this chemical is envisioned.
alan rulis, director of the fda's office of food-additive safety, said the fda found that there were no "risks or concerns" associated with neotame, and that it met the safety standards applied to all food additives.
the body weight gain issue impacts the establishment of a no effect or no adverse effect level and must, therefore, be evaluated closely.
we prefer that it be a pc-formatted diskette with the manuscript in word 6.0/95 or 97 format.
the sweetener, neotame, is made by nutrasweet co., which also produces  aspartame, a widely used sugar substitute that is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
"we don't think there's going to be a 1-to-1 replacement," he said.
the fda has approved neotame for general use in foods, except for meat and  poultry.
nutrasweet must submit a special request for neotame to be considered for use  on meat and poultry because those two foods fall under the jurisdiction of the  department of agriculture.
the agency said it concluded from the studies that neotame was safe for human consumption.

it is a free-flowing, water soluble, white  crystalline powder that is heat stable and can be used as a tabletop sweetener  as well as in cooking applications.

but mr. rosa said he doesn't see neotame, a white crystalline powder,  taking the place of aspartame in the sweetener market.
the issues of possible cancer induction need to be fully addressed since the neotame metabolism appears to be similar to that of aspartame.
but after reviewing a large number of studies, the fda concluded it was safe and that further study wasn't needed.
examples of uses for which neotame has been  approved include baked goods, non-alcoholic beverages (including soft drinks),  chewing gum, confections and frostings, frozen desserts, gelatins and puddings,  jams and jellies, processed fruits and fruit juices, toppings and syrups.

serious concerns raised by our client require definitive resolution to remove any remaining doubts about the safety of neotame prior to its introduction into the marketplace, and, equally important, to assure reasonable certainty that no harm will result from consumption of neotame.

in particular, the comments questioned the adequacy of the data in resolving issues regarding the body weight gain of test animals consuming neotame, and their reported food consumption values.

as such there has to be a confidentiality until publication.
