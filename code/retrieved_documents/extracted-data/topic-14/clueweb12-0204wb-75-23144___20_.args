in order to change a prevailing scientific paradigm as entrenched as classical materialistic worldview, we need evidence powerful and earth-shattering enough to create sufficient cognitive dissonance to admit the possibility of another entirely different worldview.like hinduism itself, ayurveda displays great flexibility and resilience which allowed it to adapt to the needs of the time.these healers integrated their deep knowledge of the local flora and mastery of healing techniques with wisdom they gained by observing priests who specialized in sacrificial rites and the use of efficacious incantations and ceremonies to influence and control the cosmic forces.as the tradition of ayurvedic medicine advances into the 21st, it must recapture inner respect for its own wisdom not by inaugurating ayurvedic schools in foreign lands or fighting for laws which permit the overseas sale of medicines, but rather by revitalizing our connection with our roots, however mystical they might be.precisely because quantum mechanics leads to irrefutably proven yet outrageously counter-intuitive and illogical conclusions that it has perhaps perfectly prepared the world for the true renaissance of ayurveda.our idea was to initially offer the preparation only to patients not in any imminent danger, who had not responded to conventional therapy and for whom there were no remaining options except major surgery.muslim rule not only dramatically changed indian culture, literature, traditions, and religion but also impacted its system of medicine.certainly, knowledge obtained through ritual trances, prayer, and revelation would be ridiculed by many and a medical strategy based on such knowledge adopted by few modern patients.dr. pandey explained that ayurvedic preparations such as this one did not work directly but rather required an interaction with the entire physiology (i.e immune, endocrine, nervous systems, etc) of the individual to be effective.most western ayurvedic “practitioners” and patients despite their best intentions are limited by their conditioned minds in their ability to penetrate the true essence of ayurveda.scientists believed that the connection between any cause and effect could be known by discovering the natural laws which determined it.knowledge of reality was valid only through direct perception, and not through inference or intuition.history clearly reveals that ayurveda though assaulted, weakened and changed throughout this tumultuous millennium, preserved its philosophical roots.the priest-healer who served as a conduit between universal and individual spirit was replaced by the either the gurukulum- or institutionally-trained ayurvedic physician who now applied academic and ethical standards.this incident exemplified how the elaborate procedures of western reductionist science can project highly distorted conclusions, producing “scientific” results that are essentially non-scientific.
