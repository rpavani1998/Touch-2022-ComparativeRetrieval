this blog aims to be a place to all those who are interested in chinese medicine- those of you who are interested in this field, those who are students of this wonderful philosophy, those who want to be students but just didn’t get round to it, those who are patients and want to know more about what their practitioner just did when he used that needle around the elbow… chinese medicine notes will provide important information on various topics, and hopefully it will become one of your regular stops on the world wide web, giving you interesting things to read while taking a break from work or drinking your first cup of coffee in the morning (or herbal tea, which ever you prefer).we were thinking about what should be a good way to start this new platform, and we have decided that it’s best to start with introducing this blog’s intentions and missions: this blog is going to grow due to the love we have for chinese medicine, and will have 100% chinese medicine oriented content.also, there is no mention of chinese herbs, which is ancient, in-depth and has very clear evidence to it’s effects.when we come across a text which puts down, insults and disrespects cm, we make it a point to read it carefully, thinking that the text is based on ignorance and a negative pre-disposition regarding cm and alternative medicine in general.we will list here the 10 links of chinese medicine we think you must bookmark and visit, as they offer good content and important info.if he had, he would know that there is more to cm than just tcm, and that chinese medicine doesn’t necessarily mean tcm.there is no “injection of sterile water, procaine, morphine, vitamins or homeopathic solutions through the needles”.in the book he shows, among other things, how cm can be used to treat the shen, and he brings us dr. shen’s theory- his own teacher and mentor.some of them just buy everything they can get their hands on- which isn’t a very good way to go, one reason is that it’s pretty expensive, and another reason is that many books that are recommended by the school are still in a very strange language which you just started to learn (chinese medicine).we surf the net in search of more information about chinese medicine on a regular basis.until 1989, dr. hammer studied many aspects of cm such as auriculotherapy, chinese herbs, 5 elements and more.in 1971 he started studying chinese medicine with dr. van buren.at first we went through the article, thinking this is yet another person who thinks he knows something about cm (but really doesn’t), but we saw that the person writing the article has very strong opinions in regards of the cm, how effective and what stands behind it.which isn’t a very good way to go, one reason is that it’s pretty expensive, and another reason is that many books that are recommended by the school are still in a very strange language which you just started to learn (chinese medicine).throughout the article, dr. barrett fails to mention that the chinese medicine is based on chinese philosophy, which just might be important to mention when you remember that the western medicine and science is basically based ongreek philosophy.
