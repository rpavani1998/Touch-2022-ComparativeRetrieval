you have chosen to claim that i put up a straw man, or “straw man,” by suggesting that you might tell your patients with morning sickness that ginger could not help them.
“what we’ve tried at georgetown is rather than create all new courses, we take relevant cam issues and modalities and weave them seamlessly into existing courses.
in theory it could have been even worse in the old days, if cow adrenal glands—with norepinephrine, a very potent natural alpha agonist, several kinds of steroid hormones, and numerous other molecules that our bodies would probably not much like—had been ground up and used as either inhaled or injectable medicines.
they have gathered 35 + med schools for teaching courses and a lesser number for postgraduate training in “cam.”
an alternative explanation is that consumers’ perceptions of the effects of most “supplements” are not based on specific biological activity.
i’ve also been involved in several nih/nci-funded projects over the last six years where my pharmacognosy and med chem colleagues have fractionated plant extracts that we have then tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines.
i don’t know how you get from my examples the possible notion that i suggested that consumers of non-european cuisine are in any way “defective”.
political/academic correctness takes care of the rest.
some studies actually show reduced basal metabolic rate during the first trimester over the non-pregnant state.
in rats the ld50 is 3 g/kg.

http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410488 apteryx wrote “but if you get a certain result in a bioassay or clinical trial from a whole extract, then can’t find any single molecule that has the same bioactivity profile when given in the same (relatively small) amount as was present in the extract, the only mechanist conclusion possible has to be that there is more than one active molecule present.”
in fact, georgetown’s program is actually coming close, as it is teaching a veritable cornucopia of unscientific methods: the anatomy of acupuncture; stress hormone modulation in physiology; “mechanisms” of acupuncture action in neuroscience; and psychoneuroimmunology in immunology courses.
yet even if that is true, it doesn’t follow that additive or synergistic medicinal effects must exist for substances found in plants that have useful medicinal properties for humans.
however, in a plant like hawthorn it appears that both flavonoids and procyanidins have beneficial bioactivities, and that multiple compounds in each class are bioactive, so you are not likely to be able to fish out one molecule and get the same complex in vivo activity profile.
i’m sorry, pec; i want to like you, in the sense that i’m content to believe that you are sincere but that you are a victim of a woefully inadequate grounding in both science and in critical thinking skills, and for that i feel genuinely sorry for you.
however, i do assume that hawthorn is better than a nonexistent drug derived therefrom.
since there is no such pill, consumers will reasonably conclude that some benefit from herbs is better than zero benefit from big pharma.
whatever the active components, the remedies will always contain other, inactive components, and these might be either useless or counterproductive, harmless or harmful.
i can certainly identify with apteryx’s enthusiasm for wanting drug companies to isolate and market the pure compounds from herbal products that have some reported potential for biological activity.
the url for the article looks exactly like the one you posted.
“perhaps as a well-informed doctor, you will go look up the clinical trials.”
in the former case, it’s not a surprise that higher dose means more toxicity.
going in circles unless we get our education right.
ginseng has dozens of ginsenosides having different activities in lab studies.
“by learning their own techniques of self-care, students will naturally internalize that and then be able to use it with their patients in the future.
i speculate that the reason that very high no levels are desirable during the first trimester is that is when most all of the differentiation is happening and when dna replication and epigenetic programming has to have the highest fidelity.
all the tests i know of showed that they were equal or worse.
if i come into your office and suggest trying ginger rather than the side-effect-heavy drug you might prescribe for my motion sickness, and you go off on a tirade suggesting, like joe above, that i may belong to a “pseudomedical cult” or, like daedalus above, that consumers of non-european cuisines may be somehow defective — well, next time i have a minor condition to deal with, i will say the heck with you and look for an herbalist.
they are only going to abandon teaching woo if the cost to teaching woo is higher than the profit.
i suspect there is no method that will reliably reduce nausea in pregnancy without increasing adverse outcomes in pregnancy (at least slightly).
drug interactions are a very important topic, and it is not necessary at all to integrate woo into the medical school curriculum to warn future physicians of what herbal medicines might interfere with various drugs.
as a 2001 georgetown medical school alumnus, i just missed the woo-ification of my alma mater, thankfully.
because of the dshea, i can’t trust the purity and dosage of what’s being sold.
by and large, the botanicals still allowed on our market are very safe.
it is not that the anti-emetics are causing any adverse outcomes, rather more adverse outcomes accompany a low no state.
a few readers probably have asthma.
ka # apteryx on 20 mar 2008 at 9:28 am there are quite a few plants whose activity has been found to split into multiple fractions in bioassays, or to diminish after fractionation.
perhaps it is because they have looked at these plants and decided that the evidence isn’t promising enough to make it a good business proposition.
part of the “jesuit philosophy” we were told at the very beginning of our training was to approach a problem from as many conceivable directions as necessary.
because of this herbal medicines may be taken for longer periods of time without the side effects so often experienced with drugs.”
“it is entirely rational for consumers who could benefit from those bioactivities to go on using the plants as people have done for millennia”
maybe ginger does cause problems during pregnancy but perhaps ginger is also good treatment for intestinal parasites native to india and if you have intestinal parasites getting rid of them with ginger is worth the side effects that ginger has.
if an asthmatic who isn’t pregnant inhales albuterol, the main effect is desirable and the side effects are minimal.
if all the schools promote woo, then it does become the “standard of care”.
i won’t get into the statin argument here except to make a point that may not have been made before: as drugs go, these are quite new and have a huge upside potential for improvement.
in the latter case, it actually implies that other molecules in the crude extract interfere with the toxicity of the “active molecule,” which is supporting evidence for the idea that whole plants may be less toxic because they contain multiple compounds with opposing effects.
but if you get a certain result in a bioassay or clinical trial from a whole extract, then can’t find any single molecule that has the same bioactivity profile when given in the same (relatively small) amount as was present in the extract, the only mechanist conclusion possible has to be that there is more than one active molecule present.
it would be beyond surprising if the most important organ, the brain were not.
and i reject the argument that a plant-based remedy is safe just because people have used it for centuries without noticing any problems.
consider an example that you cited: google “cocaine” and “local anesthetics” and you’ll quickly find an historical timeline leading from the intriguing but not very useful effects, in the medicinal sense, of coca leaf, to cocaine itself 150 years ago, which is an excellent local anesthetic (it was how local anesthesia was discovered) but has other effects that are undesirable, to the first synthetic analogue, procaine (novocaine, ca. 1910), which lacked those undesirable effects, to lidocaine (ca. 1940), the first really good synthetic la (it has a more rapid onset than procaine, gives a more intense nerve block, and lasts longer), to procainamide, bupivicaine, prilocaine, mepivicaine, ropivicaine, and other synthetic derivatives, each of which has useful distinguishing properties.
in the case of plants and insects, the phenomena are based on more than that: selection pressures imposed by each on the other over hundreds of millions of years.
students can take if they are so inclined, georgetown is taking the next logical step that i feared: it’s dedicating significant educational resources and time to teaching “cam” in itsmandatory general medical curriculum, whereevery student has to learn it: figures on how medical schools are introducing cam education are less definitive.
another example relevant to sbm is cinchona bark, from which quinine was found to be the active antimalarial ingredient, which itself led to the synthesis of the useful drugs quinidine and mefloquine.
moreover, there is no evidence for the safety of the fetus if the mother takes excessive amounts of ginger (more than is used to spice food).
then they go on to residency, where they expand on the basics and progress to more advanced education in their therapy.
as with any medication given during pregnancy, the potential benefit to risk.
if the non-woo schools get the bulk of the donations from non-woo practicing mds, those non-woo schools will persist and become stronger.
by “woo-ery,” i was referring to the woo aspects of herbalism, which does not mean that there are not non-woo aspects, namely, investigating folk uses to find useful medicinal substances in plants—as i thought i had made clear from previous examples.
“i am simply fascinated by the promise of herbal mixtures and their components as a source of novel chemistries that have allowed us to find new mechanisms of action to treat diseases.”
i, for one, am very interested in the “hard, involved science”
a few years before that, the only choice for a beta-adrenergic agent would have been the naturally-occurring epinephrine (adrenaline), which is not only non-selective between beta-1 and 2 receptors, but also between alpha and beta receptors.
a proper response would be for the doctor to look for, and evaluate, the clinical evidence.
the woo will become “well-established basic science” simply by virtue of its being taught to everyone as though it were, and the standard of care likewise.
it was used for decades by huge numbers of women before the women’s health initiative finally convinced us it did more harm than good.
“but your words above suggest that you would discourage them from using it …” your ability to “read for meaning” is failing you as badly as your ability to read my mind.
ka there are quite a few plants whose activity has been found to split into multiple fractions in bioassays, or to diminish after fractionation.
i don’t like cauliflower; well, it’s got icky-tasting defensive secondary metabolites in it, maybe it’s a teratogen.
some are longer acting, some are shorter acting, some have less effect on the electrical activity of the heart, which makes them safer for the large doses used in major nerve blocks, others have specific effects on the heart that makes them useful as anti-arrhythmics(procainamide), some have greater or lesser effects on the brain; the entire class of “amide” local anesthetics, of which lidocaine was the first, is less allergenic than its “ester” precursors (of which cocaine is one); and more.
a drug company recently tried to develop a pharmaceutical version of hoodia, but they gave up when they were unable to separate out a hepatotoxic component.
the fact that your native cuisine disdains pungent flavors and uses pungent vegetables in minuscule quantity does not mean that those plants are dangerous.
in the program’s second year, georgetown aims to double the number of mind-body session groups and introduce cam-related issues in lectures in the pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology courses in the students’ second year of medical school.
you could make the same claim above about any food plant whatsoever.
to address joe’s remarks for the benefit of other readers: homemade horse chestnut products indeed are unsafe.
i implied that we were then on an asceding curve of sectarian med entry into medical schools.
taxol, the anticancer drug whose structure was solved by one of my current senior colleagues, is a special story of a natural compound that made it to the prescription drug market because the process to synthesize it from a renewable resource was patented, not the molecule itself.
the gut is nitrergic, suggesting that high no causes both.
many organs are known to be programmed in utero including liver, heart, vasculature, endocrine system, etc.
if physicians are going to advise patients in makes perfect sense to educate them in relaxation techniques.
this is ironic, given that it has beenpointed out that “cam” is actually losing favor in china, where many of the concepts of traditional chinese medicine that underlie large swaths of alternative medicine originated.
my retort would be that it’s not necessary to integrate this sort of woo deeply into the curriculum in order to accomplish this.
i see no reason to respond further to joe, and given his rhetorical style, hope that he is not actually a practicing md.
i suspect that the nausea of morning sickness is actually a sign of very high no levels and that this high no is actually beneficial to pregnancy outcomes.
it seemed that the only peole who read it or were affected by it were proponents, who felt it as a whip on their behinds so to run even faster.
however, with a known potency (unlike the natural), the dosage could be titrated to lessen the side effect while seeking the effective dosage.

if an isolated and patented molecule were always “safer and more effective” than plants as found in nature, then no-doz would be safer than green tea, a capsule of pure sennoside would have fewer side effects than senna tea, and …oh, yeah… pure cocaine would be safer than chewing coca leaf.
if it didn’t, then at least non-woo schools would get stronger and the woo schools would get weaker.
daedalus - in other words, the potent pill with its delicate balance of benefits and toxicities can only be prescribed by an md, and therefore received only by someone who can shell out $100 or so for the office visit – plus maybe more money for office visits for more prescriptions to deal with the side effects.
perhaps as a well-informed doctor, you will go look up the clinical trials.
in winter 2002, educators are introducing a new workshop, “mind-body medicine: an experiential and didactic introduction,” which includes topics on a wide range of mind-body approaches, including meditation, nutrition, physical exercise, relaxation, and self-awareness.
a well-informed doctor, who was not taught quackery as if it were real, would research your claims.
one year, it was noted that dc public schools had better equipped science laboratories than did georgetown university.
a drug company recently tried to develop a pharmaceutical version of hoodia, but they gave up when they were unable to separate out a hepatotoxic component.
all of this betrays immaturity and a lack of sophistication.
to return to the proper theme, your med school should also have taught you not to label patients who understand that with words like “woo-ery,” “naivete,” and “childish.”
everyone can think of other classes of drugs that have gone through the stages of native source–extraction–purification–standardization of potency and dosing–synthesis of analogues, resulting in predictable, useful improvements in desired and undesired effects at virtually each stage.
cr’s association with racial equality and international commercialism, environmental conservation, and other social goods and artifacts of modern living, benefits from use of common language and a commonality of thought about dangers and misuse of science (radiation, animal experimentation, synthetic chemicals and drugs.
you admit that you have little knowledge of botany or the irrelevant science of entomology; i hope you do not display open contempt for non-md patients if their greater knowledge of botany causes them to disagree with some opinion you hold dear.
the average plant has hundreds of secondary metabolites, often in groups of closely related compounds.
we do, however, need doctors who are literate and can speak about non-medical pseudo-healing, so that they can approach conversations with their patients from knowledge.
of the then (1995-7) 57 or so courses in 125 us med schools only 4 or 5 taught subjects from scientific, analytical view.
by and large, the botanicals still allowed on our market are very safe.
i am simply fascinated by the promise of herbal mixtures and their components as a source of novel chemistries that have allowed us to find new mechanisms of action to treat diseases.
dr. atwood writes: “my own view is that this kind of evidence suggests that it may be useful to investigate ginger for a possible anti-nausea substance(s).
if they did, they would have the power under dshea to remove them from the market.
one of those “benign” herbal remedies might just turn out to be fatal for the occasional patient; we just don’t know.
i can’t believe this bs was written by a us medical school, it’s ridiculous.
as a general principle, if an effective herbal remedy is found, its safety and effectiveness are likely to be improved by purification and isolation of active components.
(in this case, the synergy is more accurately defined as “potentiation” since the antimicrobial efficacy of berberine is enhanced by the presence of the s. aureus nora efflux pump inhibitor, 5-methoxyhydnocarpin – this compound has no intrinsic antimicrobial activity so the effect can be described by the analogy of 1 + 0 = 3.)
the rss 2.0 feed goes up through the end of feb.
if such is found it can be standardized for dose-risk and dose-therapeutic effect relations, and also provide a potential starting point for new, more specific (and therefore safer and more effective) synthetic analogues.
it is not that the anti-emetics are causing any adverse outcomes, rather more adverse outcomes accompany a low no state.
i picked ginger as an example, rather than another well-proven botanical such as horse chestnut, because it is also a conventional food.
frocked priests roam the hall of the medical school, and there are some with phds research in biology, and several jesuit mds.
not content to offer so-called complementary and alternative medicine (“cam”) modalities as part of electives that interested
certainly, if other medical schools start following georgetown’s lead, it will be.
acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is easier on the stomach than purified salicylic acid was, although aspirin still kills thousands of people annually.
a few years ago the best beta receptor agonist, isoproterenol (also synthetic), was not specific to receptor types 1 or 2.
the only way to actually know something is to actually measure it.
why does its program tout that it will be starting to teach cam from the very first day of medical school, as described in on the georgetown website and brochure.
it suggests “intelligent design” or some similar, comforting but childish notion that nature is our mary poppins: “what’s nice about plant or herbal medicines is that because they are derived from the whole plant they are considerably less toxic to the body.
a common herbalist stance is that whole plants have fewer side effects than pure compounds because the plant contains other compounds that offset the side effects of the active constituent.
these botanicals have whole suites of active ingredients, and patients will gain more benefit from multicomponent products.
but if you get a certain result in a bioassay or clinical trial from a whole extract, then can’t find any single molecule that has the same bioactivity profile when given in the same (relatively small) amount as was present in the extract, the only mechanist conclusion possible has to be that there is more than one active molecule present.
lab studies supporting traditional uses are great to see, because animals and isolated cells can’t be accused of experiencing placebo effects!
this is for teaching practitioners, no less, not just teching students about “cam.”
of the then (1995-7) 57 or so courses in 125 us med schools only 4 or 5 taught subjects from scientific, analytical view.
this is a very good thing, and something i would like to see replicated in the us.
i am not making a claim; you are making the claim that there are no adverse effects from eating pharmacological doses of ginger.
but somehow i don’t think you would be less fearful of african wild plant foods than of the european cultivars that we’ve used for less than two millennia.
in the vast majority of cases, fractionation of plant extracts leads to an enrichment of cytotoxic activity (not a loss as might be expected if there were synergistic components) that can then be narrowed down to a single pure compound or related pure compounds.
i think that you are more likely to find single compounds effective in a cytotoxicity assay.
# harriet hall on 19 mar 2008 at 5:40 pm herbalists frequently claim herbs are superior because of some synergistic effect of their components.
there is a balance between potency, cost, and side effects, and it does not make sense to attack every symptom with the biggest possible hammer no matter what.
however, with a known potency (unlike the natural), the dosage could be titrated to lessen the side effect while seeking the effective dosage.
depending on what dr. atwood decides to write, next week i may take a look at the issue of academic medicine from october 2007 and examine some of what has been written there in more detail about the teaching of “cam” in medical school.
a dull knife is also a lot less useful as a tool.
the metabolic demand in the first trimester is small.
fda has no evidence that the commercial products are dangerous in ordinary use.
many compounds in plants are there to deter predation by herbivores.
pharmaceuticals are too high.
i, for one, am very interested in the “hard, involved science” that is used to demonstrate these plants’ bioactivities, whether or not the studies of bioactivity identify single active compounds.
you say that only formal trials mean anything, then you don’t seem interested in the results of the trials that have been published.
then anyone not with the program will become heterodox.
if a compound has no therapeutic effect in reducing nausea, it may still have physiological effect in causing side effects.
unfortunately, nccam goes beyond this and funds grants to promote the teaching–indeed, the integration–of cam in medical schools before these modalities are scientifically proven.
if they did, they would have the power under dshea to remove them from the market.
all women may not react the same way.
you imply, later in your comment, that the recommended doses (if that’s what you mean by “potency”) for pharmaceuticals are too high.
the questionnaire replies were sometimes caustic and cynical, the course heads (joke?) having sniffed out my “bias.”
cocaine has a high potential for abuse both as pure cocaine hydrochloride and also as coca leaf.
the major traditional medicine of india is ayurveda which uses heavy metals (mercury, arsenic and lead) in quantities that exceed levels now considered to be safe.
i’m sorry to say that out of ~4,000 extracts with which my lab has worked, we have yet to find a single case where synergy might be present.
( http://web.archive.org/web/20050825191221/http://www.scnm.edu/news/uploads/ms.pdf ) excuse me, but equipotent doses are equipotent, no matter what the packaging.
# apteryx on 20 mar 2008 at 1:38 pm then perhaps big pharma would do us the favor of filling in a few gaps in their armamentarium by manufacturing: - a single compound derived from hawthorn to alleviate symptoms of heart failure while reducing, rather than increasing, the risk of arrhythmias - a single hepatoprotective compound derived from milk thistle (mds who do not wish to risk malpractice suits already treat amanita poisoning with silymarin, which is a standardized mixture of four active molecules – you can find reports on pubmed) - a single compound derived from horse chestnut to treat chronic venous insufficiency - a single compound derived from gotu kola to speed wound healing and treat microangiopathy, and - a single compound derived from elderberry to fight flu.
i suspect that if this high no level is reduced by any mechanism that adverse pregnancy outcomes will increase.
the “seamless” weaving of cam into existing classes includes, for instance, a presentation by an acupuncturist on the “anatomy of acupuncture” in the gross anatomy course for first-year students.
no compelling case that i have yet seen has been made that cam methodologies are so compelling in their efficacy that room must be made in the mandatory medical school curriculum for them.
consuming an entire retail container of salt (26 oz or 740 grams) would likely be fatal.
i was asking for support for the general claim that if you select a random botanical and make a concentrated drug from one of its active molecules, that drug will be “safer” than the botanical – which is ludicrous on the face of it.
it provides at least two drugs (digoxin and digitoxin) with similar action; but very different pharmacological profiles.
the rss 0.92 feed starts at march 4th and i forget what the atom feed is doing.
the ginger plant was not intelligently designed so as to provide an anti-nausea drug for humans.
if so, even if their discoveries have only to do with substances poisonous to insects, it would provide a theoretical boost to the synergy claim for medicinal properties—even though the latter are fortuitous, existing only because biochemistry itself is similar throughout the living world.
if “everyone” in india eats ginger during their pregnancy, perhaps they are all immune, or perhaps if they didn’t eat so much ginger over historic time we would now be speaking hindi because indians would have industrialized first and conquered the world instead of europeans.
# daedalus2u on 19 mar 2008 at 4:14 pm there are many more plausible reasons that indians didn’t conquer the world than because they ate too much ginger.
if widespread synergy of bio-active molecules in plants really exists, it’s likely that it will have already been discovered by entomologists and/or botanists (readers: help us out here, please).
there is also the example of foxglove.
by “woo-ery” i was referring to ideas such as those in the quotation from the naturopath, which are childish, naive, and do not reflect an understanding of anything.
much of the information taught in the first years of professional school is presented from authority without much critical analysis.
the physiology that causes the nausea may have a beneficial role all by itself.
indeed, there are a few limited cases where synergy among herbal components might support the superior action of a whole herb – my favorite case is the work of frank stermitz at csu in the pnas report cited by apteryx above.
altering any of these regions changes biologic effects, and after much experience such “structure-activity” relationships both help us learn about how things work and allow pharmacologists to make educated guesses about what new alterations might be useful.
we only use an antibiotic or pesticide for a few decades before seeing major resistance, whereas plants seem to get by for millennia.
when purified compounds are used, the metabolism of them is simpler than the metabolism of those compounds plus thousands of others.
i will instead send a copy of your excellent article as a way explanation about why i won’t be sending any more money.
zetetic – anti-botanical pundits tend to assume that botanicals have only one active molecule, which presumably causes side effects as well as benefits.
apteryx wrote “you are saying that the single molecule will be more bioactive in terms of desired effects yet less bioactive when it comes to causing side effects — and that this is not just occasionally true but a general rule.
teaching cam must bring in more money.
here seemed to be the missing link that turned the heads of the academics and a significant percentage of mystical-bending practitioners, and spurred interest the splay of non-professionals and quasi-professionals whose ads one sees in small weekly newspapers and in yellow pages.
something that coca leaf cannot be used for.
as for the herbalist claims that herb components work together to provide some increased benefit (additive, or synergistic), the opposite can also be true- the herb can contain poisons that make the desired active-ingredient irrelevant until purified.
that could mean either that the concentrated fraction is more toxic than the crude extract when given in equal volumes (which means that a far higher quantity of the toxic molecule(s) is present), or that the concentrated fraction is more toxic than the crude extract when given at a much lower dose, so that the dose of the toxic molecule(s) is identical.
no causes high atp via sgc allowing metabolic functions to operate well.
you are saying that the single molecule will be more bioactive in terms of desired effects yet less bioactive when it comes to causing side effects — and that this is not just occasionally true but a general rule.
as for your speech about “no evidence” for the “safety of the fetus,” well, again, there are half a dozen clinical trials with no safety problems, plus a total lack of anecdotal harm.
cr as has been discussed, creates a content equity between scientific and pseudo-scientific systems.
i suppose humans could be said not to have “evolved in symbiosis” with any food plants not native to africa, although humans have been in australia, via asia, for 50,000 years.
the p450 system is regulated by no, and is quite uncoupled, that is it produces superoxide when metabolizing compounds.
announcing that every substance is toxic in excess is not a valuable revelation.
because there is no evidence to support them, just like all the other cult medicine garbage.
if you’re scientifically inclined, as i am, it ought to make you shudder.
willow bark contains salicin in relatively low doses.
i suppose humans could be said not to have “evolved in symbiosis” with any food plants not native to africa, although humans have been in australia, via asia, for 50,000 years.
pure cocaine hydrochloride can be used as a local anesthetic.
i don’t like cauliflower; well, it’s got icky-tasting defensive secondary metabolites in it, maybe it’s a teratogen.
if that is the mechanism, then it would likely also reduce the threshold for adverse outcomes in pregnancy.
one of those “benign” herbal remedies might just turn out to be fatal for the occasional patient; we just don’t know.
but do not despair for this will also be its doom: with ever increasing numbers of patients “treated”, the media will be full of failures and side-effects and the public will turn once again to good old medicine… only to go back to cam when all that travesty will have been forgotten.
and it would be nice if in every case, their molecule was significantly more potent without having serious side effects, or equally potent without any more side effects or greatly increased cost.
this sounds like a bad joke but april fool’s day is still two weeks away.
the non-woo view of herbs as potential medicines.
if the drug companies think the “evidence isn’t promising enough” to justify investigation of those botanical uses i mentioned – most supported by multiple clinical trials and multiple animal studies and, in some, in vitro explorations of mechanism – even though none of their magic-bullet drugs can offer the same bioactivity profiles, then it is entirely rational for consumers who could benefit from those bioactivities to go on using the plants as people have done for millennia.
to return, as dr. sampson has done, to the original theme — these are not controversial statements among people aware of the state of research on botanicals.
instead of drumming up fear of spicy vegetables, perhaps they should start trying to quantify the toxic dose of grain-fed red meat.
that’s clever, but if you walk away from your med school with, let’s say, the opinion that ginger can’t possibly help morning sickness but has been proven to interact with warfarin, a subset of your patients will be better informed than you are and will know it.
we seldom worry about “dose-risk relations” when we eat food, yet somehow we survive.
teaching unproven cam modalities so extensively in the core medical school curriculum rather than as electives is neither scientifically nor educationally appropriate, as it puts the imprimatur of scientific medicine as represented by medical schools on therapies that are anything but scientific.
if they continue to employ your services, they will stop telling you about their use of herbs, assuming that any attempt to inform you will be met with scorn and possibly worse care or pejorative notes in their charts.
it costs the plant something, metabolically, to make twenty saponins or alkaloids rather than just one.
it’s not entirely implausible, in a way: many biologically-active molecules in plants, including some that have become medicines, appear to have evolved as defenses against predators (mainly insects).
i reviewed the content of many of the courses through questionnaires, web sites, and requested outlines.
moreover, advocates of cam tend to be much more passionate about promoting it than skeptics are about expressing their skepticism about it.
you’re simply looking for compounds that are, frankly, poisonous in isolation, and enough of any poisonous compound will kill cells by itself.
thus, jesuit philosophy may be playing a role in the woo-ification you outlined above.
the questionnaire replies were sometimes caustic and cynical, the course heads (joke?) having sniffed out my “bias.”
so scientific medicine becomes a stand-in enemy for unhappy and somatiforming souls, whose internally generated conflicts can be comfortably externalized and then written about, meeting-about, and scolded through faculty meetings.
with botanicals, you can sometimes go to the grocery store, or your own backyard, and get perhaps weaker effects for $2.
yes, it’s plausible to “get a certain result in a bioassay or clinical trial from a whole extract, [without] any single molecule that has the same bioactivity profile when given in the same (relatively small) amount as was present in the extract.”
if so, this ought to be known to legitimate botanists and entomologists.
he often lumped-together the good, the bad and the ugly of clinical trials to support herbalist claims.
humans did not evolve in symbiosis with ginger.
all fetuses may not react the same way.
there is no evidence that the plant as traditionally used is hepatotoxic, so if the active molecule when concentrated were hepatotoxic, it might be a case where the drug model reduced safety.
again, i don’t know that there aren’t examples of medicinal plants containing more than one molecule useful for the same human problem.
offhand, i find that “hospitalized elderly patients taking digitoxin had a lower rate of toxicity than those taking digoxin.”
in fact, they already do but mostly as semi-synthetic analogs of the naturally-occurring compounds to overcome metabolism and solubility issues (and the patentability issues detailed below).
if you want to keep me as a patient, you don’t need to recommend traditional medicines, but if you want to express strong opinions on the subject, you had better show that you have seen as much of the relevant research as i have.
if that is the mechanism, then it would likely also reduce the threshold for adverse outcomes in pregnancy.
if there were only one molecule in horse chestnut that affected leg edema, or only one molecule in hawthorn that improved heart function, some drug company would by now have sifted it out, slightly altered and patented it, and be doing phase iii trials.
the vast majority of cam therapiesdo lack rigorous scientific testing that mainstream medical therapies must undergo.
i’m sure you can also appreciate that some of the critical, uncompromising language used on this blog is not the sort that most mds would throw at a patient who has approached us in good faith, however much we may disagree with his or her point of view.
thus if an asthmatic came to an emergency room needing treatment, he was likely to get a drug that worked but caused unpleasant heart-racing as a side effect, or perhaps he was denied that drug because it would have been too dangerous if he also had heart disease.
also, we know how to recombine fractions to home-in on the best activity.
because of this herbal medicines may be taken for longer periods of time without the side effects so often experienced with drugs.”
given how hard medicine already is to keep up on, maybe we should consign it to the trash-heap of intellectual history.
there’s little enough room in the curriculum to teach them that.
to return to the proper theme, your med school should also have taught you not to label patients who understand that with words like “woo-ery,” “naivete,” and “childish.”
during organ differentiation is the time when a lot of epigenetic programming of those organs occurs.
however, studies in pregnant women suggest that ginger can be used safely for morning sickness without harm to the fetus.
in the “wild”, a time of high stress is not a good time to be pregnant.
he deserves credit for that, not insult.
at the very best, we have seen nothing more than additive action among compounds where more than one was present in the extract.
thus dangerously high blood pressures and several other side effects would have been added to those previously mentioned.
even the dean of the medical school has his jesuit masters.
ending that pregnancy in the safest way, such as via preterm birth might be one of the “normal” responses to low no.
to the extent that an herb has activity, it is a contaminated drug.
exactly how i am not sure, but if it didn’t there is no way it would get a foothold.
the ginger plant was not intelligently designed so as to provide an anti-nausea drug for humans.
i said i wasn’t going to waste further time responding to joe’s posts, but for the benefit of any readers who do not know what pharmacognosy is, it is the pharmacological study of botanicals or other natural products.
it was used for decades by huge numbers of women before the women’s health initiative finally convinced us it did more harm than good.
a cochrane review concluded that it is effective for nausea of pregnancy.
that means that it stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which mainly causes bronchodilation (useful for asthma)
i suspect that if this high no level is reduced by any mechanism that adverse pregnancy outcomes will increase.
you’re simply looking for compounds that are, frankly, poisonous in isolation, and enough of any poisonous compound will kill cells by itself.
the editors did not want to publish the article – a subject for longer exposition – they objected to the time delay, the “orientation” and so forth.
we know that meditation, or relaxation, can decrease stress, and we know that excessive stress can be harmful to the body.
but you write, “a physician who knows nothing about health except which drug to prescribe, or what diagnostic and surgical technology to use, is incomplete as a health expert”—as though “which drug to prescribe” and “technology” overwhelm physiology, anatomy, biochemistry, neurobiology, immunology, hematology, histology, embryology, genetics, pathophysiology, pharmacology (which is not the same thing as “which drug to prescribe”), the natural history of disease, learning how to take histories that are useful, other interviewing techniques, physical examinations, making sense of signs and symptoms, smatterings (at least) of almost every clinical field from psychiatry to pediatrics to obstetrics to internal medicine to surgery and various surgical sub-specialties, radiology, dermatology and more, learning preventive medicine and clinical problem-solving, learning how to think about clinical research and literature, and all the rest of the enormous body of knowledge and skills that constitute becoming a physician.
it may also have quite diverse and idiosyncratic effects.
the problem is that nccam doesn’t just fund grants to study cam, which, although it often leads to studies of dubious scientific merit about therapies lacking even scientific plausibility, much less data, at least is an intellectually and scientifically defensible endeavor.
it is true that there can be more than one poison in a plant, perhaps each having conferred a selective advantage against the same species or similar species of insects.
a physician who knows nothing about health except which drug to prescribe, or what diagnostic and surgical technology to use, is incomplete as a health expert.
but talk about an anechoic response…the anti-echo came back with new foundations with more and diferent funding agendas, providing fertilizer ($$$$) for the courses david gorski described.
# daedalus2u on 18 mar 2008 at 7:41 am i suspect that the nausea of morning sickness is actually a sign of very high no levels and that this high no is actually beneficial to pregnancy outcomes.
i don’t assume that willow bark is better than aspirin, opium is better than codeine, or artemisia is better than artemisinin (if you can afford the drug and, where it is prescription-only, gain an md’s permission to obtain it).
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10677479?ordinalpos=29&itool=entrezsystem2.pentrez.pubmed.pubmed_resultspanel.pubmed_rvdocsum there have been several studies on green tea catechins, showing that while egcg is the only one that’s very potent directly (e.g., against cancer), the presence of related compounds boosts its activity.
stress is a low no state, the “adverse outcomes” can also be thought of as normal stress responses.
ginger has a number of molecules that are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system.
most members of pseudomedical cults cannot relinquish their beliefs.
the 3rd one was on the influence of post-modernism and cultural relativism (cr) on preparing the soil for the present growth.
” if you suggest in utero or in vivo exposure to ginger could possibly have prevented indians from industrializing “first,” you imply that ginger consumption could possibly create some unspecified biological condition that prevented them from being good productive capitalists and conquistadors.
the research on ginger vs. morning sickness is inconclusive.
this is a skill physicians generally lack because it’s something they were never taught.
if widespread synergy of bio-active molecules in plants really exists, it’s likely that it will have already been discovered by entomologists and/or botanists (readers: help us out here, please).
(real life example: ginseng contains individual ginsenosides that both raise and lower blood pressure in animal studies, but as a whole extract tends to lower blood pressure.)
removing compounds that don’t reduce nausea and that do cause side effects will both increase efficacy and reduce side effects.
if an isolated and patented molecule were always “safer and more effective” than plants as found in nature, then no-doz would be safer than green tea, a capsule of pure sennoside would have fewer side effects than senna tea, and …oh, yeah… pure cocaine would be safer than chewing coca leaf.
i’m sure some herbal remedies do contain more than one active ingredient.
it is not true for cranberry juice.
this is for teaching practitioners, no less, not just teching students about “cam.”
the major traditional medicine of india is ayurveda which uses heavy metals (mercury, arsenic and lead) in quantities that exceed levels now considered to be safe.
my wife received as good a medical education as i, through a public medical school at 1/10th of the tuition.
it is not true for cranberry juice.
that is used to demonstrate these plants’ bioactivities, whether or not the studies of bioactivity identify single active compounds.
the same is true of purified pharmaceutically active agents.
no is an excellent antioxidant, several thousand times better than vitamin e. high no causes high atp via sgc allowing metabolic functions to operate well.
he is also quick to note the initiative is not a program of advocacy.
please don’t confuse what’s wrong with “bigpharm”—shameless advertising, cois involved in sponsoring trials, concealing of unflattering information, which we bloggers don’t like any better than you—with what’s right with it: pharmaceutical r&d and manufacturing, ie, the science and technology.
http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/410488 # joe on 19 mar 2008 at 5:40 pm apteryx wrote “but if you get a certain result in a bioassay or clinical trial from a whole extract, then can’t find any single molecule that has the same bioactivity profile when given in the same (relatively small) amount as was present in the extract, the only mechanist conclusion possible has to be that there is more than one active molecule present.”
it may interest apteryx that i had the bittersweet honor of stepping in for varro tyler at a symposium held in 2001 a month after his untimely death and that my current research is actually on pure components in milk thistle (just do a pubmed search for me; however, i study their anticancer action rather than their hepatoprotective action).
# daedalus2u on 18 mar 2008 at 12:36 pm apteryx, it is pretty obvious that not all compounds in ginger are pharmacologically active in reducing nausea.
traditional med schools have been cranking out doctors who believe, and instruct patients, that plants are probably harmful but never helpful unless they both can be and have been made into drugs.

the nccam is the biggest of course, and combined with service departments (army, navy, defense dept. and now usaf) has exceeded $1 billion.
the vast majority of mds from good medical schools have to be opposed to the teaching of woo because it isn’t evidence based and isn’t consistent with the standards of care.
to return, as dr. sampson has done, to the original theme — these are not controversial statements among people aware of the state of research on botanicals.
the data is underwhelming.
practically everyone knows that, and it tells us nothing about what substances are toxic under normal circumstances.
when the publisher updates the web site (sram.org) some articles will be there.

# daedalus2u on 18 mar 2008 at 6:41 pm i don’t say that only formal trials mean something.
commercial products are made with specific techniques to remove the toxic compounds” btw, apteryx also noted “commercial products should be standardized to 50 mg of aescin and free from aesculin, a hydroxycoumarin.”
animal studied and in vitro mechanism studies are hard and involved, indeed, but i hope you don’t mean to imply that if they can’t completely explicate all mechanisms of action, they will never be “hard” enough to satisfy.
to put it in economic terms, since medicine is a lucrative industry these days: you will lose business.
you can comfort yourself with the belief that each has only one active molecule and that putting that molecule in a pill would be even better.
the non-woo view of herbs as potential medicines.
in theory it could have been even worse in the old days, if cow adrenal glands—with norepinephrine, a very potent natural alpha agonist, several kinds of steroid hormones, and numerous other molecules that our bodies would probably not much like—had been ground up and used as either inhaled or injectable medicines.
it is actually a necessary dietary component.
it costs the plant something, metabolically, to make twenty saponins or alkaloids rather than just one.
i’m afraid addressing all the mistaken ideas in the above message would take a very lengthy response, which as dr. sampson would note, would be a distraction from the major thread.
fda has no evidence that the commercial products are dangerous in ordinary use.
the increased adverse effects due to lowering no in pregnancy that i am contemplating would be independent of any other direct adverse effect anti-emetics might have.
# daedalus2u on 19 mar 2008 at 2:18 pm i don’t know how you get from my examples the possible notion that i suggested that consumers of non-european cuisine are in any way “defective”.
we are trying to do that now with milk thistle compounds but the reality is that the pure, naturally-occurring compounds cannot be patented and lack of a protected ip position provides no financial incentive for the average $800 million investment required to bring a drug to market in the us.
a more plausible explanation of why indians didn’t industrialize first is that (a) they didn’t have large accessible coal reserves, which is not causally correlated with consumption of spicy foods, and (b) they live in the tropics, an area historically not conducive to sweatshop labor — which is.
i reviewed the content of many of the courses through questionnaires, web sites, and requested outlines.
as a scientist with the training and willingness to investigate these questions, i can only hope that enough interest (i.e., funding) remains in the promise of this field for such questions to be addressed.
it would be beyond surprising if the most important organ, the brain were not.
the details of which specific adverse outcomes occur are complex and could be all over the map.
the 3rd one was on the influence of post-modernism and cultural relativism (cr) on preparing the soil for the present growth.
i also think that if a manufacturer did make a single-compound drug from a complex botanical, it should be their job to demonstrate that it is better than the plant it came from, rather than asking us all just to “simply assume” that the brand new corporate product is superior.
your suggestion that a good medical education leads to the opinion “that ginger cannot possibly …” is an invalid straw man.
also, we know how to recombine fractions to home-in on the best activity.
aspirin is preferable to willow tree bark and digitalis to foxglove.
lab studies supporting traditional uses are great to see, because animals and isolated cells can’t be accused of experiencing placebo effects!
more often, i think, concentrating any one of the multiple active compounds in a plant and giving an enormous dose of that alone is a good way to increase side effects.
if you can present compelling evidence that ginger is safe and effective, it will become ‘medicine.’
any wonder that you create true belivers in woo.
“if students get involved in these research projects, it will allow them to go to the cutting edge of cam.
# apteryx on 18 mar 2008 at 9:45 am thanks to drs.
the compounds in ginger are xenobiotic as far as human physiology is concerned.
by “woo-ery” i was referring to ideas such as those in the quotation from the naturopath, which are childish, naive, and do not reflect an understanding of anything.
whatever the active components, the remedies will always contain other, inactive components, and these might be either useless or counterproductive, harmless or harmful.
a dull knife is “safer” than a sharp knife.
but talk about an anechoic response…the anti-echo came back with new foundations with more and diferent funding agendas, providing fertilizer ($$$$) for the courses david gorski described.
i threw that out there as an attempt to be humorous, but also to make the point that even though things have been used for a long time doesn’t mean they are safe.
the indian practices of ayurveda reportedly were dictated by one of their gods.
the ginger plant evolved to have these compounds in it for its own reasons, not to provide medicinal effects to humans.
you can comfort yourself with the belief that each has only one active molecule and that putting that molecule in a pill would be even better.
in a related note concerning herbal medicine, more than 100 “antimalarial” chinese herbs were screened and only artemesia had useful activity http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722826?ordinalpos=21&itool=entrezsystem2.pentrez.pubmed.pubmed_resultspanel.pubmed_rvdocsum .
a plausible mechanism by which ginger reduces nausea is by causing local oxidative stress due to activation of p450 enzymes, which pulls down the no level and reduces the threshold for nausea.
they have gathered 35 + med schools for teaching courses and a lesser number for postgraduate training in “cam.”
if “everyone” in india eats ginger during their pregnancy, perhaps they are all immune, or perhaps if they didn’t eat so much ginger over historic time we would now be speaking hindi because indians would have industrialized first and conquered the world instead of europeans.
political/academic correctness takes care of the rest.
the rss 0.92 feed starts at march 4th and i forget what the atom feed is doing.
the fact is, that membership of a material in a group called “herbs” or “chemicals” or “foods” or “drugs” or “pharmaceuticals”, or “white powders” or “sold in containers of lethal quantities” tells us nothing about the safety or dangerousness of the material.
ginger has a number of molecules that are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system.
once one goes through all this learning how easy is it to realize rationally that it is all just distilled water.
no, researchers have not done separate failed clinical trials with every single one of those compounds – that would be impossible as well as foolish – but they have done lab studies showing that different groups of compounds contribute to bioactivity.
they also tend to get taken over by true believers.
the nccam is the biggest of course, and combined with service departments (army, navy, defense dept. and now usaf) has exceeded $1 billion.
artemisia annua tea is a fairly effective treatment for malaria, but concentrated derivatives of artemisinin (which is only one of several active compounds) are even better, and given the degree of misery malaria causes, patients who can afford them will prefer them.
in a related note concerning herbal medicine, more than 100 “antimalarial” chinese herbs were screened and only artemesia had useful activity http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722826?ordinalpos=21&itool=entrezsystem2.pentrez.pubmed.pubmed_resultspanel.pubmed_rvdocsum .
in the latter case, it actually implies that other molecules in the crude extract interfere with the toxicity of the “active molecule,” which is supporting evidence for the idea that whole plants may be less toxic because they contain multiple compounds with opposing effects.
it is a jesuit institution, beholden to the teachings of the catholic church.
if such is found it can be standardized for dose-risk and dose-therapeutic effect relations, and also provide a potential starting point for new, more specific (and therefore safer and more effective) synthetic analogues.
yet they promise that the drug-discovery process will give us souped-up effects with reduced side effects.
you readily offer truisms, written in the phony passive voice (thank you, calli arcale), such as “it is well known that mental states can influence physical health,” when the reality is far less sanguine.
yes, it’s plausible to “get a certain result in a bioassay or clinical trial from a whole extract, [without] any single molecule that has the same bioactivity profile when given in the same (relatively small) amount as was present in the extract.”
how easy is it really for even ebm people to change their minds about pet beliefs even when new evidence is published.
more from the acs “ginger may interfere with blood clotting …”
everyone can think of other classes of drugs that have gone through the stages of native source–extraction–purification–standardization of potency and dosing–synthesis of analogues, resulting in predictable, useful improvements in desired and undesired effects at virtually each stage.
i’m at a med school where cam was handled more skeptically.
this is a very good thing, and something i would like to see replicated in the us.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10677479?ordinalpos=29&itool=entrezsystem2.pentrez.pubmed.pubmed_resultspanel.pubmed_rvdocsum there have been several studies on green tea catechins, showing that while egcg is the only one that’s very potent directly (e.g., against cancer), the presence of related compounds boosts its activity.
especially the part “in the program’s second year, georgetown aims to double the number of mind-body session groups and introduce cam-related issues in lectures in the pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology courses in the students’ second year of medical school” read like some parody mark crislip would write.
but the more potent product is not always better.
botanists, in general, do not know how to do that.
if we start teaching “cam” as legitimate medicine, there is no end to the garbage we will force medical students to learn.
i think any botanist or entomologist would agree that there has to be some selective advantage to doing so.
since there is no such pill, consumers will reasonably conclude that some benefit from herbs is better than zero benefit from big pharma.
for example adults exposed to nutritional deprivation in utero have more health problems as adults.
as far as i know that was never done, but it would be the obvious analogy to the “cam” preference for whole plants or parts of plants—except, of course, that if such a preparation were taken by the oral route it would be relatively innocuous, and the adrenergic molecules themselves would not be sufficiently absorbed to have any effect, useful or otherwise.
apteryx wrote “you are saying that the single molecule will be more bioactive in terms of desired effects yet less bioactive when it comes to causing side effects — and that this is not just occasionally true but a general rule.
also, some botanicals cannot be turned into single-compound drugs without losing efficacy.
herbalists frequently claim herbs are superior because of some synergistic effect of their components.
i picked ginger as an example, rather than another well-proven botanical such as horse chestnut, because it is also a conventional food.
i am not making a claim; you are making the claim that there are no adverse effects from eating pharmacological doses of ginger.
one of those things that med students really ought to be learning [note casual segue back to original topic] is that when people from india and china start eating the western diet, their health worsens.
because of the dshea, i can’t trust the purity and dosage of what’s being sold.
the evaluation skills are often not part of the curriculim.
a colleague suggested that i come by to this discussion because i have spent much of my 15 yrs of independent research on natural products and herbal medicine.
apteryx does indeed seem to know a lot about my field although i’d be happy to help tone things down and add some clarity as i feel i am a stakeholder in natural products research in prescription medicine as well as in the more intellectually-accessible end of the spectrum of so-called complementary and alternative medicine – in fact, some natural products researchers are a bit miffed that their decades of legitimate work has been co-opted by purveyors of fraudulent and deceptive cam modalities at the other ends of the spectrum.
yet even if that is true, it doesn’t follow that additive or synergistic medicinal effects must exist for substances found in plants that have useful medicinal properties for humans.
professionalism in medicine, as in any other “helping” profession, is more compassionate and subtle than that.
it is disappointing when even academic environments starts to try to set these kind of trends.
in the former case, it’s not a surprise that higher dose means more toxicity.
altering any of these regions changes biologic effects, and after much experience such “structure-activity” relationships both help us learn about how things work and allow pharmacologists to make educated guesses about what new alterations might be useful.
i see no reason to respond further to joe, and given his rhetorical style, hope that he is not actually a practicing md.
the indian practices of ayurveda reportedly were dictated by one of their gods.
anyway, if the aspirin is safer, that would be one instance for which that was true.
when purified compounds are used, the metabolism of them is simpler than the metabolism of those compounds plus thousands of others.
the p450 system is regulated by no, and is quite uncoupled, that is it produces superoxide when metabolizing compounds.
once again, this putting the cart before the horse.
if an asthmatic who isn’t pregnant inhales albuterol, the main effect is desirable and the side effects are minimal.
the increased adverse effects due to lowering no in pregnancy that i am contemplating would be independent of any other direct adverse effect anti-emetics might have.
it made them uncomfortable.
apteryx, it is pretty obvious that not all compounds in ginger are pharmacologically active in reducing nausea.
another example relevant to sbm is cinchona bark, from which quinine was found to be the active antimalarial ingredient, which itself led to the synthesis of the useful drugs quinidine and mefloquine.
artemisia annua has at least seven antimalarial compounds; but artemisinin is 1,000 times more potent than the next best (“traditional medicinal plants and malaria” m. willocox, et al eds.
tyler took a conservative position, for example arguing that willow bark could not work as an analgesic (despite its use on three continents) because the dose of pure salicin was small relative to the maximum permitted dose of aspirin.
vomiting (a not infrequent outcome of nausea) is mediated largely through smooth muscle which is largely regulated through no.
a plausible mechanism by which ginger reduces nausea is by causing local oxidative stress due to activation of p450 enzymes, which pulls down the no level and reduces the threshold for nausea.
the compounds in ginger are xenobiotic as far as human physiology is concerned.
sure, the faculty claim that they will be teaching students to “critically assess” the various cam modalities, but you’ll excuse me if i remain skeptical.
i’m sorry to say that out of ~4,000 extracts with which my lab has worked, we have yet to find a single case where synergy might be present.
the only way to actually know something is to actually measure it.
i’m sure you can also appreciate that some of the critical, uncompromising language used on this blog is not the sort that most mds would throw at a patient who has approached us in good faith, however much we may disagree with his or her point of view.
if the drug companies think the “evidence isn’t promising enough” to justify investigation of those botanical uses i mentioned – most supported by multiple clinical trials and multiple animal studies and, in some, in vitro explorations of mechanism – even though none of their magic-bullet drugs can offer the same bioactivity profiles, then it is entirely rational for consumers who could benefit from those bioactivities to go on using the plants as people have done for millennia.
these days, many patients are too well informed to accept such blanket claims.
on the other hand, what would it take to convince you ginger is not safe and effective?
harriet, your link to the aafp looks exactly right; but, for me, i get to a page that tells me the page does not exist, and invites me to search for the article.
vomiting (a not infrequent outcome of nausea) is mediated largely through smooth muscle which is largely regulated through no.
the drugs you mention are indeed improvements over the natural products from which they are derived.
i’ve also been involved in several nih/nci-funded projects over the last six years where my pharmacognosy and med chem colleagues have fractionated plant extracts that we have then tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines.
since then, 2 of them are gone with the retirement of their teachers.
there is no evidence that the plant as traditionally used is hepatotoxic, so if the active molecule when concentrated were hepatotoxic, it might be a case where the drug model reduced safety.
there is a balance between potency, cost, and side effects, and it does not make sense to attack every symptom with the biggest possible hammer no matter what.
many organs are known to be programmed in utero including liver, heart, vasculature, endocrine system, etc.
if you want to keep me as a patient, you don’t need to recommend traditional medicines, but if you want to express strong opinions on the subject, you had better show that you have seen as much of the relevant research as i have.
some are longer acting, some are shorter acting, some have less effect on the electrical activity of the heart, which makes them safer for the large doses used in major nerve blocks, others have specific effects on the heart that makes them useful as anti-arrhythmics(procainamide), some have greater or lesser effects on the brain; the entire class of “amide” local anesthetics, of which lidocaine was the first, is less allergenic than its “ester” precursors (of which cocaine is one); and more.
when there is no general understanding for the physiological basis behind the nausea of early pregnancy, and when there is an inverse correlation between nausea in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, i think it is presumptuous to assume that treatments that do away with nausea have no side effects.
ginseng has dozens of ginsenosides having different activities in lab studies.
for example adults exposed to nutritional deprivation in utero have more health problems as adults.
the second largest, bravewell, is the main private force behind development of courses and training programs.
consuming an entire retail container of salt (26 oz or 740 grams) would likely be fatal.
if so, even if their discoveries have only to do with substances poisonous to insects, it would provide a theoretical boost to the synergy claim for medicinal properties—even though the latter are fortuitous, existing only because biochemistry itself is similar throughout the living world.
as a scientist with the training and willingness to investigate these questions, i can only hope that enough interest (i.e., funding) remains in the promise of this field for such questions to be addressed.
the organizers of this curriculum also point out that many people take herbal remedies and dietary supplements, many of which can interact with standard drugs, and cite this as a justification for teaching cam.
all women may not react the same way.
the only thing that the administrators are going to listen to is money.
ka harriet, sorry, i was writing my comment while you posted yours and didn’t notice that you had already addressed the evidence about ginger.

it was a safe, effective morning sickness treatment that we used for years.
during organ differentiation is the time when a lot of epigenetic programming of those organs occurs.
however, i do assume that hawthorn is better than a nonexistent drug derived therefrom.
but your words above suggest that you would discourage them from using it, pooh-poohing any evidence in its favor, and that if they openly disagreed with you, you would call them “not well informed” and club them with the completely unsupported threat of danger to their embryos.
apteryx knows this as s/he reported “homemade horse chestnut products indeed are unsafe.
effective herbal remedies are drugs just as much as prescription drugs are.
asians, including females, commonly eat this plant as a food and drink it as a beverage, often consuming more than a gram per sitting.
salicylic acid is found in some plants (e.g., meadow sweet, not in willow) and it has antipyretic and analgesic properties.

acute hypoxia can cause nausea.
“your med school should also have taught you not to label patients who understand that with words like “woo-ery,” “naivete,” and “childish.”
yes, a specific molecule would be more bioactive than “natural” and could cause side effects.
i can certainly identify with apteryx’s enthusiasm for wanting drug companies to isolate and market the pure compounds from herbal products that have some reported potential for biological activity.
sadly, sometimes the science supports traditional practices.
cr as has been discussed, creates a content equity between scientific and pseudo-scientific systems.
no, researchers have not done separate failed clinical trials with every single one of those compounds – that would be impossible as well as foolish – but they have done lab studies showing that different groups of compounds contribute to bioactivity.
if one carries that pregnancy to term, the infant’s physiology needs to be programmed to survive in a high stress environment.

professionalism in medicine, as in any other “helping” profession, is more compassionate and subtle than that.
again, i don’t know that there aren’t examples of medicinal plants containing more than one molecule useful for the same human problem.
i suspect that even biofeedback and purely neurogenic methods will still increase adverse effects via decreasing no levels.
i must admit that i’ve never been interested enough in the woo-ery of herbalism (it’s so prosaic compared to the really magical stuff) to investigate this claim, although one hears it all the time.
it seemed that the only peole who read it or were affected by it were proponents, who felt it as a whip on their behinds so to run even faster.
and i reject the argument that a plant-based remedy is safe just because people have used it for centuries without noticing any problems.
in the “wild”, a time of high stress is not a good time to be pregnant.
identifying those compounds and supplying them in pure form at known dosages allows the therapeutic effect to be titrated against any side effects.
since most people aren’t aware of mds’ limited sources of information, they’ll assume that your ignorance is a deliberate choice on your part, probably arising from strong negative opinions of the subject.
# apteryx on 18 mar 2008 at 12:42 pm zetetic – anti-botanical pundits tend to assume that botanicals have only one active molecule, which presumably causes side effects as well as benefits.
we seldom worry about “dose-risk relations” when we eat food, yet somehow we survive.
in fact, they already do but mostly as semi-synthetic analogs of the naturally-occurring compounds to overcome metabolism and solubility issues (and the patentability issues detailed below).
that’s why exposing medical students to cam practices and principles is so important, he says.
it is true that there can be more than one poison in a plant, perhaps each having conferred a selective advantage against the same species or similar species of insects.
the anecdotes of safe and beneficial use of ayurveda go as far back as the anecdotes of the safe and beneficial use of ginger (that would be for all of recorded history in india).
artemisia annua tea is a fairly effective treatment for malaria, but concentrated derivatives of artemisinin (which is only one of several active compounds) are even better, and given the degree of misery malaria causes, patients who can afford them will prefer them.
a proper response would be for the doctor to look for, and evaluate, the clinical evidence.
cr’s association with racial equality and international commercialism, environmental conservation, and other social goods and artifacts of modern living, benefits from use of common language and a commonality of thought about dangers and misuse of science (radiation, animal experimentation, synthetic chemicals and drugs.

one of those things that med students really ought to be learning [note casual segue back to original topic] is that when people from india and china start eating the western diet, their health worsens.
if ginger is effective, by identifying and isolating the anti-nausea component we may be lucky and remove a component that interferes with clotting (if it exists).

more often, i think, concentrating any one of the multiple active compounds in a plant and giving an enormous dose of that alone is a good way to increase side effects.
however, if your med school told you anything about botanicals, it should have told you that it is very common for plants to contain whole suites of structurally similar secondary metabolites, which may serve many purposes other than “poisons” – of course, what is a “poison” to a bacterium may be beneficial for us!

thus if an asthmatic came to an emergency room needing treatment, he was likely to get a drug that worked but caused unpleasant heart-racing as a side effect, or perhaps he was denied that drug because it would have been too dangerous if he also had heart disease.

thus dangerously high blood pressures and several other side effects would have been added to those previously mentioned.

when there is no general understanding for the physiological basis behind the nausea of early pregnancy, and when there is an inverse correlation between nausea in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, i think it is presumptuous to assume that treatments that do away with nausea have no side effects.

to put it in economic terms, since medicine is a lucrative industry these days: you will lose business.
the fact is, that membership of a material in a group called “herbs” or “chemicals” or “foods” or “drugs” or “pharmaceuticals”, or “white powders” or “sold in containers of lethal quantities” tells us nothing about the safety or dangerousness of the material.

if those md graduates sent letters to the schools they graduated from saying no more donations while woo is being promoted, and that instead their donations would go to non-woo promoting competing schools, i think the promotion of woo would stop.

in addition the student has to learn all the dilutions and the ritualistic shaking – when to tap with a leather bound book and when not.
i won’t get into the statin argument here except to make a point that may not have been made before: as drugs go, these are quite new and have a huge upside potential for improvement.
in pharmacology class, all that would have to be done would be, when teaching drug interactions, to include herbal remedies and supplements among the compounds and drugs that can interact with each new medication that is discussed and perhaps include a module on such remedies.
the average plant has hundreds of secondary metabolites, often in groups of closely related compounds.
i think the testing for most herbal remedies has generally been inferior to the testing for prescription drugs.
on the one hand it would give them tax exempt status, on the other hand it would be a lot easier to justify not teaching them.
but you write, “a physician who knows nothing about health except which drug to prescribe, or what diagnostic and surgical technology to use, is incomplete as a health expert”—as though “which drug to prescribe” and “technology” overwhelm physiology, anatomy, biochemistry, neurobiology, immunology, hematology, histology, embryology, genetics, pathophysiology, pharmacology (which is not the same thing as “which drug to prescribe”), the natural history of disease, learning how to take histories that are useful, other interviewing techniques, physical examinations, making sense of signs and symptoms, smatterings (at least) of almost every clinical field from psychiatry to pediatrics to obstetrics to internal medicine to surgery and various surgical sub-specialties, radiology, dermatology and more, learning preventive medicine and clinical problem-solving, learning how to think about clinical research and literature, and all the rest of the enormous body of knowledge and skills that constitute becoming a physician.
acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is easier on the stomach than purified salicylic acid was, although aspirin still kills thousands of people annually.
he often lumped-together the good, the bad and the ugly of clinical trials to support herbalist claims.
an alternative explanation is that consumers’ perceptions of the effects of most “supplements” are not based on specific biological activity.
i suspect there is no method that will reliably reduce nausea in pregnancy without increasing adverse outcomes in pregnancy (at least slightly).
a few years before that, the only choice for a beta-adrenergic agent would have been the naturally-occurring epinephrine (adrenaline), which is not only non-selective between beta-1 and 2 receptors, but also between alpha and beta receptors.
as a general principle, if an effective herbal remedy is found, its safety and effectiveness are likely to be improved by purification and isolation of active components.

yes, the virus is spreading and it may not be long until woo becomes standard treatment.
maybe ginger does cause problems during pregnancy but perhaps ginger is also good treatment for intestinal parasites native to india and if you have intestinal parasites getting rid of them with ginger is worth the side effects that ginger has.

the reason this week is, quite simply, having read dr. atwood’s excellent two part post misleading language: the common currency of “cam” characterizations (part i; part ii).
the physiology that causes the nausea may have a beneficial role all by itself.
the ginger plant evolved to have these compounds in it for its own reasons, not to provide medicinal effects to humans.
however, one thing about the “cam” movement is that it tends not to e interested in the hard, involved science necessary to identify the active compound(s) in the herbs and how they may act and interact.
though hardly religious myself, it sounded good to me at the time.
however, in a plant like hawthorn it appears that both flavonoids and procyanidins have beneficial bioactivities, and that multiple compounds in each class are bioactive, so you are not likely to be able to fish out one molecule and get the same complex in vivo activity profile.
also, above, you are assuming that there are significant side effects to begin with, otherwise we could hardly demand that consumers spend more money on the drug product to “lessen” them.
perhaps it is because they have looked at these plants and decided that the evidence isn’t promising enough to make it a good business proposition.
salicylic acid is found in some plants (e.g., meadow sweet, not in willow)
if a compound has no therapeutic effect in reducing nausea, it may still have physiological effect in causing side effects.

consider an example that you cited: google “cocaine” and “local anesthetics” and you’ll quickly find an historical timeline leading from the intriguing but not very useful effects, in the medicinal sense, of coca leaf, to cocaine itself 150 years ago, which is an excellent local anesthetic (it was how local anesthesia was discovered) but has other effects that are undesirable, to the first synthetic analogue, procaine (novocaine, ca. 1910), which lacked those undesirable effects, to lidocaine (ca. 1940), the first really good synthetic la (it has a more rapid onset than procaine, gives a more intense nerve block, and lasts longer), to procainamide, bupivicaine, prilocaine, mepivicaine, ropivicaine, and other synthetic derivatives, each of which has useful distinguishing properties.
although proven drug-herb interactions are far rarer than you are probably taught, they do exist, so this creates a potential safety issue.
we only use an antibiotic or pesticide for a few decades before seeing major resistance, whereas plants seem to get by for millennia.

acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) is more pharmacologically useful and much better tolerated.

in other words, the potent pill with its delicate balance of benefits and toxicities can only be prescribed by an md, and therefore received only by someone who can shell out $100 or so for the office visit – plus maybe more money for office visits for more prescriptions to deal with the side effects.
but the more potent product is not always better.
(imho, the real problem with hoodia products is that most of them are fake.)
regarding ginger and morning sickness, there is a bit of evidence favoring it but the studies are small and the effect modest, if it really exists.
then perhaps big pharma would do us the favor of filling in a few gaps in their armamentarium by manufacturing: - a single compound derived from hawthorn to alleviate symptoms of heart failure while reducing, rather than increasing, the risk of arrhythmias - a single hepatoprotective compound derived from milk thistle (mds who do not wish to risk malpractice suits already treat amanita poisoning with silymarin, which is a standardized mixture of four active molecules – you can find reports on pubmed) - a single compound derived from horse chestnut to treat chronic venous insufficiency - a single compound derived from gotu kola to speed wound healing and treat microangiopathy, and - a single compound derived from elderberry to fight flu.
i implied that we were then on an asceding curve of sectarian med entry into medical schools.
i suspect that even biofeedback and purely neurogenic methods will still increase adverse effects via decreasing no levels.
commercial products are made with specific techniques to remove the toxic compounds” btw, apteryx also noted “commercial products should be standardized to 50 mg of aescin and free from aesculin, a hydroxycoumarin.”
however, if your med school told you anything about botanicals, it should have told you that it is very common for plants to contain whole suites of structurally similar secondary metabolites, which may serve many purposes other than “poisons” – of course, what is a “poison” to a bacterium may be beneficial for us!
some studies actually show reduced basal metabolic rate during the first trimester over the non-pregnant state.
in other words, they will become advocates for non-science-based medicine–exactly what medicinedoesn’t need.
i think any botanist or entomologist would agree that there has to be some selective advantage to doing so.
this is probably because most doctors committed to ebm just aren’t that interested in cam because there’s not much good evidence for the vast majority of modalities that fall under its label and because so many cam modalities are associated with spiritual/religious concepts underlying them that have no business in science.
