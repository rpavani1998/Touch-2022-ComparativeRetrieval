for instance, despite a formal intent to create proletarian health care, possibly 20% of barefoot doctors went on to become professional doctors of western medicine.the new beijing chinese medical institute offered enrichment classes to chinese practitioners in preventive medicine, new acupuncture, and standardized chinese prescriptions.their training included an intensive background in public health and sanitation, a stripped-down western-style pharmaceutical toolkit, acupuncture and herbs.list of medications mentioned in the barefoot doctor’s manual what is interesting and undeniable about the barefoot doctors is that they were, ultimately, quickly and effectively trained, served without requiring enormous salaries, and were at least on some level closer in social status to their patients than doctors are in the us today.furthermore, many practitioners slide quickly into authoritarian interactions, or worse- insulated by money away from the social determinants of their patients’ diseases, they may come to think that their life represents a personal example that their slothful, slovenly patients should- must- follow.however, it is also sometimes highly dishonest to act confident or authoritative, and even when physicians do have a degree of certainty- that smoking is bad e.g.- giving instructions from a position of authority seems much less pleasant to me than giving advice at eye level.the functional, and politically acceptable solution was to inaugurate a new training program for the “peasants and workers” themselves.doctors, after all, would be a privileged class of technocratic intellectuals, and would not be able to join with the peasants and workers.academies throughout china began offering enrichment classes to doctors of chinese medicine who wished to “scientize” and standardize their practice, although those who worked with the ministry of health were generally relegated to promoting hygiene, nutrition and immunizations.the ministry of health came under attack for its policies, and in 1954 mao dictated that “scientizing” chinese medicine would not be sufficient to bring about his goal of a unified health care system.the political ideology of the cultural revolution effectively prohibited educating a class of professional doctors, in the sense we think of them today.traditional chinese medicine may not be traditional in its current form, but it is absolutely and irrevocably chinese.even in med school, i have been told by instructors never to show doubt or uncertainty, and to take control of a patient interaction with authority.while alternative explanations have been proposed, the surgery as originally described would have compromised the intrapleural space and collapsed her lungs without positive-pressure ventilation.she read somewhere that hair loss was a symptom of diabetes and that made her far more motivated to do something about it than anything the doctor had said.
