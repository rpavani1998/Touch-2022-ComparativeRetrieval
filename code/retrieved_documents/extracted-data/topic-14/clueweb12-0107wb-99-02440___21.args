sometime, i saw he was going to be short of breath, but he would overcome it and get better later.
i've brought those tapes with me, but i haven't listened to them yet (laugh).
but of course some doctors are not as good as others.
in taiwan we felt that too much homework and pressure was not good.
people usually try to see the good doctors, therefore if there is an emergency, you may not be able to make an appointment with them.
unless i talk to those i am familiar with, otherwise i don't have much to say, especially in english conversations.
but chinese doctors know about the difference.
then he (she) decided to give us a lesson on the cultural difference.
f: the old lady next door gets £70.
it may be because i worried about the steroids, so i didn't like it.
she does not want people to think she is troublesome.
but it is better with the old lady, because she is quite old and also she is a bit forgetful.
housework seemed to be her main source of stress.
but in taiwan, always be quick, be quick, otherwise you can't compete with other people, you can't catch up, you have to be faster than other people.
i will then sit there and not know what to do.
when we first came here, i felt the english people were very reserved.
so i am not very familiar with them.
he was absent for a few days and did not attend the class for a few days.
this is quite good for the children.
he is not bad -- in his school, in the secondary school, some students are behaving very badly, they are really bad.
it may be because i worried about the steroids, so i didn't like it.
our attitude towards children -- the cultures are completely different -- their mums don't care.
they said give them freedom and they would learn it themselves later.
later, i became a buddhist.
also, because the welfare for the elderly people is good.
they said give them freedom and they would learn it themselves later.
if it is not necessary, i won't say anything in the classroom, i just listen.
people usually try to see the good doctors, therefore if there is an emergency, you may not be able to make an appointment with them.
it turned out that that girl did not know how to do multiplication.
he does not see a doctor.
you are -- (she started to laugh) relax, it is alright (laugh).
i said it would not be clean by just using the spray, the stain would still be there.
because you think that you are not working and you are supposed to look after the children and the home well.
during holidays, oh dear, all the parks are packed with people.
for example asthma -- like my son, he suffers from asthma when the weather is not good ...
we chinese people say that for acute illness, consult a western doctor; for chronic illness, see a chinese doctor (laugh).
a bag of medicine costs £5, very expensive, it is very expensive.
like this morning, i went to my daughter's sports day, her friend -- her classmate's mum -- her classmate's brother is the classmate of my son -- so we are quite familiar with each other.
but now it is not easy to find a job.
firstly, the environment is better.
your mental condition affects your physical condition.
if it is not necessary, i won't say anything in the classroom, i just listen.
like this morning, i went to my daughter's sports day, her friend -- her classmate's mum -- her classmate's brother is the classmate of my son -- so we are quite familiar with each other.
i don't know, i don't know whether those people you are interviewing know english.
but now i know about it, before that i was a bit stupid and didn't understand that, and also no one taught me about that.
but they are going home soon, so they don't care.
if you have some friends it means that there will be some problems and gossip.
so all the pressure is only temporary, it will not be -- if i thought about staying here forever, then i'd have a lot to consider.
if you come here to study only, you leave once you get your degree.
they paid £3 or £4, it is not expensive.
that is why the usage of the nhs -- the statistics are so low.
my course has finished already, so i went to that class.
i felt very tired on the journey.
and when i asked the teacher how to answer, he (she) said to say "not bad", then they would not carry on asking about the problems.
it is not important whether the clothes are good quality or not, but they should be clean.
also, it is very democratic here.
i asked them why i got it, they said it is probably because of stress.
i have children to look after, for example, to get a job during the time when the children go to school.
because her husband is a job.
we have cultural differences with all the english people.
it is mainly because the weather, now you know what to wear for different weather.
because our orientations are not the same, attitudes are not the same.
your mental condition affects your physical condition.
not bad, he did not join them.
so i am not very familiar with them.
i don't know whether those chinese "tai tai" and chinese ladies, who you have interviewed, have any religion.
how to say -- he was not really behaving badly.
sometimes, the doctors don't understand them.
because in taiwan they had a lot of homework, but here all the sudden -- he realised that he can have a different kind of life.
but later i found that when i was not at home, my husband would read books in his room and our children would watch television or do something else in the living room.
i found it quite hard when i first came here, but it is getting better now.
one of my daughter's friends came to our house, they are dirty -- their mums don't do the washing --.
f: my husband came here to study for a {qualification}, so we came along too.
after crying, i still need a friend to talk with.
they were very polite, they said things very formally, otherwise they think you are rude.
sometimes a trip out is quite good.
i've brought some books with me, but i have not read them either.
i believe there are some good doctors and some bad doctors; it is not possible that all of them are good.
very sloppy, so i gave up.
but then this chinese man replied that he had been passing some black excrement (laugh).
like here there are some areas -- with a lot of single parents, they use bad language.
when the weather got cold, he thought he needed it.
then he (she) decided to give us a lesson on the cultural difference.
i came to her place, a bungalow in {location}, which is immaculate clean and tidy.
but he is good at having funny chats with other people.
i have children to look after, for example, to get a job during the time when the children go to school.
four of them got pregnant.
this is quite good for the children.
and then when we come back, i need to do a lot of laundry.
as a mother, i think i should tell him what is right and what is not right.
but we are in a foreign country, we should behave better -- i feel this is very tiring.
every wednesday, they go to 'place', a kind of centre for the elderly people -- they come and bring them out.
i don't know whether those chinese "tai tai" and chinese ladies, who you have interviewed, have any religion.
now i've learned how to deal with it -- i also may not invite them into my house.
i said how come you expect a result by taking them just twice -- they are not poison.
if i used it every day, i found my throat was very sore and i didn't like it.
i need some exercise, it is related to exercise.
he takes his own medicine without seeing a doctor...
f: cultural difference, yes, but it is not just between you and the doctors.
i went to watch films with my friends a few times, and my husband went to pick up the children.
when we first came here, i felt the english people were very reserved.
f: our children -- my son in the secondary school -- they have a lot of clothes.
i think people would not understand our english.
f: here, i like the fresher air here.
f: his friends are mainly those from the university.
also after hearing that for many times, you know how to talk with them in a way that is polite.
one of my daughter's friends came to our house, they are dirty -- their mums don't do the washing --.
f: cultural difference, yes, but it is not just between you and the doctors.
you might not think that way as i talk a lot with you (laugh).
f: i might scold the children -- i don't know -- because my son did not behave well in the first year.
they talked about pregnancy and i listened to them.
i need some exercise, it is related to exercise.
if she did not call my name, i would just sit there and not say a lot.
but he is good at having funny chats with other people.
husband just concentrates on his study and the wife is responsible for everything related to the whole family.
even though there were some taiwanese students, they came here to study, also they were..., that is, that is not the same.
she may have spent a lot of time on tidying the house.
later, i became a buddhist.
of course, they have different expectation on the students from the top group and the second group -- the teachers are not the same and neither is the homework.
as a mother, i think i should tell him what is right and what is not right.
but our chinese mums will tell our children what is right and then ask them to follow it and not to make mistakes.
i: but my previous flatmates from taiwan, they were able to get some part time jobs.
if i did not feel good, i cried and then i felt alright.
later, i realise that those foreigners, they usually won't invite you inside their houses.
i think -- are you wondering if those old people who came to this country earlier may not speak english and they may have this problem.
he simply puts them into the oven.
she only knew how to read the time from a digital display, not the other way to tell the time.
the homework and project which my son is doing is very different from what we used to do.
most of the foreigners think we chinese, most of us, will go to see chinese doctors when we fall ill and don't go to see the gps.
i think that is because of the fresher air, a lot of space, a slower pace of life, so people here live longer.
yes, we have some contacts, but that is not as easy as it is in taiwan.
and when i asked the teacher how to answer, he (she) said to say "not bad", then they would not carry on asking about the problems.
i came to her place, a bungalow in {location}, which is immaculate clean and tidy.
they could not solve my problems, but after chatting with them, i felt better.
the problems were still there, but you had someone to talk to.
but i think the children who grow up here, they will be completely different from us.
here some people go to church, i don't think it is useful.
their department is very tough, they needed to attend the classes, to do the course work, and also to take exams for many subjects.
i think i would not be able to control myself not to interfere.
we tell them to do this, not to do that -- the foreigners don't.
but of course some doctors are not as good as others.
but they are going home soon, so they don't care.
it is very convenient as they are delivered to his home.
if there is any dirt on their clothes, i will wash them as soon as possible.
there is -- but, because, i have a friend who works in the chinese medicine centre, on saturday, they have a lot of foreign patients -- some of them are old men or old ladies.
because you think that you are not working and you are supposed to look after the children and the home well.
like us, after we finish the study, we will leave.
it may be better for the children, but how about for the adults, for example, how about job opportunities, friends... f: yes, less good.
he is so capable -- he knows how to do that.
for example asthma -- like my son, he suffers from asthma when the weather is not good ...
i said how come you expect a result by taking them just twice -- they are not poison.
when i listen to her, i was worrying about her.
f: it was not mainly because -- it was not because they could not help -- like, how do you say it, there are some women's illness diseases, western doctors cannot diagnose them.
i felt my legs were very sore, i told them that i was very tired, but they did not stop talking.
yes, now if i hear that, for example, someone has just come over to this country, and they are talking with foreigners, i will tell them, i will tell them if you say it in this way, the hearer will think you are very rude.
f: in taiwan, i did not have many friends, only a few.
i wanted to see a doctor, but didn't know who to go to.
f: before i went to see a doctor, if i didn't know how to describe my symptoms, i would look them up in a dictionary beforehand and try to memorise the words.
the education system is not same as ours.
they need exercise in that kind of weather.
mainly because the rhythm of life here is slower.
when i first came here, i was not familiar with the environment, i had no friends and also i felt the pressure, i felt very tired, really.
like us, after we finish the study, we will leave.
my husband's english is also not very good, but he is very good at chatting with other people.
summer, when the weather is better.
now i also do the ironing, we didn't iron our clothes in taiwan.
husband just concentrates on his study and the wife is responsible for everything related to the whole family.
he just worried that they might disturb other passengers.
then he did not pass, he could not carry on to do a {qualification}.
but for the chronic illnesses, i think chinese medicine is better.
although he had a {qualification} already, it was not useful because it was not recognised here.
f: religions can be part of it.
they thought of getting a job in hong kong because the wages in hong kong are high.
the man said his cousin had the same name as him, but he was not working at the university.
i asked her what year she was in -- year 5 -- in year 5, she still did not know how to do those things.
my husband organised the trip and then when we were back, i had to do the washing.
also, sometimes when they come, our house may be a bit messy, then i may just chat with them outside the house for 10 mins or 15 mins.
sometime, i saw he was going to be short of breath, but he would overcome it and get better later.
i just don't want to be out for so many days.
although she told me that she was now very happy and satisfied with her life here, there seemed to be a time that she had great difficulties (the first year when she came).
because we thought most of the patients were chinese, but it was not so.
she does not like her mum's attitude towards religion -- she has her own interpretation about the bible.
i found that they gave out the award to both groups of students.
some are not good and waste your time.
f: here, there are a lot of bad students in their secondary school.
although he had a {qualification} already, it was not useful because it was not recognised here.
for the children, western medicine is more effective.
i listen to her on the phone, i think she is a bit impolite.
you have a stable income, that is very important, and you can live very healthily, i think (laugh).
i went to see them and they said it was normal.
he is not very healthy -- he likes taking medicine.
they talked about pregnancy and i listened to them.
f: my family members are in taiwan.
he was absent for a few days and did not attend the class for a few days.
the dental treatment is expensive.
he is not bad, he did not join in, but he did watch.
but later i found that when i was not at home, my husband would read books in his room and our children would watch television or do something else in the living room.
my husband is a serious person.
during holidays, oh dear, all the parks are packed with people.
the teacher has taught a lot of foreigners.
our attitude towards children -- the cultures are completely different -- their mums don't care.
then we will forget about all the polite words, like "please".
my sister told me that being a housewife is very demanding, very hard.
if you can't wash your hair or take a bath, they will help you.
f: yes, but i did not talk a lot.
she said that if we had no friends, we could go to their house for christmas.
f: taiwanese -- we did not know many of them, because the place where we used to live was not close to the university, therefore we did not have much connection.
he is also quite friendly with the teachers.
anyway, she is a good person.
they won't ask what part of your body is not well.
this is different from us chinese.
i don't know about the other people, but i know her well because i had taught her.
if she did not call my name, i would just sit there and not say a lot.
i went to see them and they said it was normal.
of course, you can't get the biscuits or bread twice.
because they had to study for a master's degree in their first year.
but the foreign mothers don't care about this.
they have meals delivered to them.
there should be plenty of time, but it is busy -- time is flying.
we tell them to do this, not to do that -- the foreigners don't.
when i came back, they would rush to turn off the television.
otherwise we would have been better off not coming and just letting my husband come over here on his own.
they divided students by their results -- say top group, second group.
generally, western medicine is effective, but people say drugs are not good.
but children can't resist ice-cold food.
f: our friend said that i care too much about what other people think of me.
i asked them why i got it, they said it is probably because of stress.
i wanted to see a doctor, but didn't know who to go to.
they asked {person} to teach us english and we paid a little bit of money.
because you asked me, so i will tell you.
if we were in taiwan, that would not matter because we were all chinese.
the rest of the medicine was left untouched.
they were very polite, they said things very formally, otherwise they think you are rude.
i do it on my own, i do the ironing for four people, it is very tiring.
they won't ask what part of your body is not well.
if you need further treatment, you have to join the long waiting list.
if a western doctor can do nothing, then you need to see a chinese doctor.
the course is grade number.
although she wants to have her son around, she thinks that her son has his own family problems and she does not want to disturb him.
a friend of mine, who is a teacher, told us that his (her) child jumped down from a high place.
firstly, the environment is better.
i was very worried about him.
otherwise we would have been better off not coming and just letting my husband come over here on his own.
there is a lot of homework, but not so hard, they are catching up gradually.
they could not solve my problems, but after chatting with them, i felt better.
i feel that some parts of my body have some problems.
mainly because the rhythm of life here is slower.
f: before i went to see a doctor, if i didn't know how to describe my symptoms, i would look them up in a dictionary beforehand and try to memorise the words.
she does not care -- even though her english is not good, she still tries.
but in taiwan, they all go to see chinese doctor.
i found that they gave out the award to both groups of students.
because our orientations are not the same, attitudes are not the same.
we travelled on the train -- a few years ago -- about two years ago -- at that time our children were still quite young -- we did not have a car, we travelled by trains.
we here -- medicine -- see £5 can last -- i found it very expensive.
there is a lot of homework, but not so hard, they are catching up gradually.
if i did not feel good, i cried and then i felt alright.
she probably doesn't go to church.
we chinese have the concept that bringing up children to help with their old age.
i went to see chinese doctors in taiwan sometimes, i drank the medicine too.
f: taiwanese -- we did not know many of them, because the place where we used to live was not close to the university, therefore we did not have much connection.
rich people don't have to worry too much before they go to see a doctor.
because we attended the class and our friends told us that the english people like that, you should say it in that way.
i prefer to look after my two children well, because my husband does not care about this.
although she told me that she was now very happy and satisfied with her life here, there seemed to be a time that she had great difficulties (the first year when she came).
the other day -- it is the holidays at the moment and we have no classes at the university -- a few "tai tai", who are going home soon, contacted {person}.
it is mainly because the weather, now you know what to wear for different weather.
but my husband is better because he has got quite a lot of friends.
i think i would not be able to control myself not to interfere.
i: you mean he is a fun person.
when we were in taiwan, my husband was always very busy and i felt very bored at home all day.
if you have relations, you can contact them sometimes.
my sister told me that being a housewife is very demanding, very hard.
i bought some tapes and i felt better.
if i go with him, i would remind him what to do and what not to do.
they don't have to take some difficult or dangerous jobs.
later, i told him that it was not good, not good, not good.
after i cried for a few times, i felt better.
i want my children going out with clean clothes, i don't want them to be dirty.
you foreigners are making a loud noise on the train.
even in taiwan, the old generations and young generations are very different, they are really different.
she does not want people to feel disgusted with her.
but now i know about it, before that i was a bit stupid and didn't understand that, and also no one taught me about that.
of course, they have different expectation on the students from the top group and the second group -- the teachers are not the same and neither is the homework.
i think if i went with him, i would be in charge of him.
also, because the welfare for the elderly people is good.
f: firstly, i cannot find it possible to calm myself down, there are so many things to do and i cannot stop.
although she wants to have her son around, she thinks that her son has his own family problems and she does not want to disturb him.
he (she) went to a pub with us.
f: he is capable of doing that.
although she said that she was very quiet, she seemed to be very relaxed and willing to share her views.
f: the children don't have to pay for the treatment if you go to see a western doctor, but not a chinese doctor.
our neighbours here are quite friendly.
our next door neighbour is a lady and she cooks for herself.
the biggest difference between western medicine and chinese medicine is that, for western medicine, you will see the result in a few days, but for chinese medicine, it may take a few months, you have to wait.
a friend of mine, who is a teacher, told us that his (her) child jumped down from a high place.
she does not like her mum's attitude towards religion -- she has her own interpretation about the bible.
it is very convenient as they are delivered to his home.
if there are some problems with your mental health, then nothing will be alright.
the next door old lady, she is clever.
even though there were some taiwanese students, they came here to study, also they were..., that is, that is not the same.
what you can get are those low class jobs -- such as a cleaner or something like that.
when i listen to her, i was worrying about her.
we chinese have the concept that bringing up children to help with their old age.
also after hearing that for many times, you know how to talk with them in a way that is polite.
i feel religions can be very influential.
sometimes they will chat with us.
we travelled on the train -- a few years ago -- about two years ago -- at that time our children were still quite young -- we did not have a car, we travelled by trains.
the class seems to be quite useful.
he [my husband] was very serious.
yes, i was told that most of them are foreigners, they are not chinese.
i: i feel that you are very active -- you visit other people.
it is good to have a chance to speak a bit of english.
he would have more freedom if i don't go.
he (she) did not worry about his (her) child and said that his (her) child knew how to get down from the high place.
i am not using it now, i have sore throat and it is very uncomfortable.
i think so -- so he has got quite a lot of friends.
generally, western medicine is effective, but people say drugs are not good.
he is so capable -- he knows how to do that.
i don't know, they are like that, they won't invite you inside and offer you a cup of tea.
if there are some problems with your mental health, then nothing will be alright.
you might not think that way as i talk a lot with you (laugh).
i do it on my own, i do the ironing for four people, it is very tiring.
but there are many cases in taiwan when chinese medicine killed the patients.
i did not go on some school trips with him.
so i really don't know which of them is more effective.
yes, i was told that most of them are foreigners, they are not chinese.
they have a lot of foreign patients.
our children, they enjoyed it very much.
but we are in a foreign country, we should behave better -- i feel this is very tiring.
he (she) said we english people did not listen to something like this -- how could you mention something like this so casually.
but i think the children who grow up here, they will be completely different from us.
i will then sit there and not know what to do.
when we were students, we had to do the homework and also pass all the tests.
i've brought some books with me, but i have not read them either.
since then, we went to their house every christmas -- 24th, 25th, 27th, we went there (laugh).
but sometimes i find my english is not very good, so i am not very close to them.
when we were students, we had to do the homework and also pass all the tests.
but i think you can do the same because you are also willing to chat with people.
if you have some friends it means that there will be some problems and gossip.
this is quite a good learning environment.
but here students need to search for a lot of books and to plan how to go about their work.
the doctors said -- sometimes, if they used spoken english which i didn't understand, i would ask them to clarify what they had said.
we went to the class and our teacher told us that if an english people asks "how are you", you must answer "fine", don't say, don't say you have any problems, they won't be prepared to listen to you.
if there is any dirt on their clothes, i will wash them as soon as possible.
at that time, my daughter was very small -- i was a bit worried.
but in taiwan, always be quick, be quick, otherwise you can't compete with other people, you can't catch up, you have to be faster than other people.
if you come here to study only, you leave once you get your degree.
also the doctors, like what i said, the english people -- they said something very formally -- "how are you", "fine" -- just something like this.
in taiwan we felt that too much homework and pressure was not good.
also, it is not easy to get a job.
later, i realise that those foreigners, they usually won't invite you inside their houses.
but i could not read it, because their handwriting is very sloppy.
also in taiwan, we need to be quick all the time.
even when i went to do the shopping and came back late, they would act as if i was not there.
you mean he takes his own medicine.
even when i went to do the shopping and came back late, they would act as if i was not there.
they thought of getting a job in hong kong because the wages in hong kong are high.
because i think if we can get along, we are friends.
he did not use an inhaler in taiwan.
the other day -- it is the holidays at the moment and we have no classes at the university -- a few "tai tai", who are going home soon, contacted {person}.
i think if i went with him, i would be in charge of him.
he (she) is a teacher, he (she) has the experience and he (she) did not worry.
so i really don't know which of them is more effective.
in this area, here in {british location}, most of our neighbours are quite old.
if you want to live in a nice place, then it is no problem.
she does not care -- even though her english is not good, she still tries.
who can you go for if you still have any problems, since your friend is leaving.
although she wants her son to come to see her, but she does not force him do so.
also, it is not easy to get a job.
in taiwan, we shouted for democracy for a long time, said how we chinese people should be, it was all the talk.
if you are mentally healthy, you will have no problems.
i feel the welfare benefits for the elderly people are better here.
i told him that i was bored, tired, and was not comfortable staying at home.
he chatted with my husband.
then we will forget about all the polite words, like "please".
he (she) did not worry about his (her) child and said that his (her) child knew how to get down from the high place.
but there are many cases in taiwan when chinese medicine killed the patients.
i: no. f: i am not good at communicating with people.
they help them to do what they can't do at home.
he would have more freedom if i don't go.
recently he hasn't taken the medicine.
i am not using it now, i have sore throat and it is very uncomfortable.
i've brought those tapes with me, but i haven't listened to them yet (laugh).
our next door neighbour is a lady and she cooks for herself.
and then when we come back, i need to do a lot of laundry.
f: i might scold the children -- i don't know -- because my son did not behave well in the first year.
i find the countryside here very beautiful.
if you move to here, it would not be easy to deal with the society here.
i prefer to look after my two children well, because my husband does not care about this.
then my husband -- my husband's surname is {name}-- told him that his surname in chinese also means "{name}", so they were both "{name}" -- belonging to the royal family.
otherwise, i would not have been able to do that, if i had had to rush back to pick the children up.
because i think if we can get along, we are friends.
now we know they emphasise that, otherwise you are like a barbarian.
since then, we went to their house every christmas -- 24th, 25th, 27th, we went there (laugh).
for the subtraction, she knew how to do minus nine, minus 10, but not minus 11.
bullying is very common, real bullying.
after visiting them for a few times, you know which ones are good and will try to stick with them.
it is not important whether the clothes are good quality or not, but they should be clean.
for example, we chinese are not the same as them -- we are very courteous to our visitors -- "please come in and take a seat" -- unlike our neighbours; if you chatted with them at their front doors for half an hour, 45 mins, or even an hour, they still would not invite you to go inside.
we also have regular contacts.
most of the foreigners think we chinese, most of us, will go to see chinese doctors when we fall ill and don't go to see the gps.
unless i talk to those i am familiar with, otherwise i don't have much to say, especially in english conversations.
f: sometimes, i listened to the tapes, to the buddhist sermons.
i don't know about the other people, but i know her well because i had taught her.
you will feel -- i don't know how about in hong kong.
the children did not care.
the teacher has taught a lot of foreigners.
now i also do the ironing, we didn't iron our clothes in taiwan.
he talked to my son, but my son did not believe it -- he found using it very convenient -- he was surprised to hear that it could be additive -- he felt in great pain without it.
our situations are quite similar because her husband is also not young.
at that time, my daughter was very small -- i was a bit worried.
she only knew how to read the time from a digital display, not the other way to tell the time.
he takes his own medicine without seeing a doctor...
you have money, you can afford to see a doctor or to be ill.
because we stayed at {location} and my husband brought my daughter out -- shopping before christmas -- and met {person}.
a bit like an infection, they all got pregnant.
for example, some doctors will talk a lot with you, but some just ask how you are and then you come out very quickly.
they don't have to take some difficult or dangerous jobs.
i used to attend the class as well.
he is not bad -- in his school, in the secondary school, some students are behaving very badly, they are really bad.
we chinese people say that for acute illness, consult a western doctor; for chronic illness, see a chinese doctor (laugh).
for the children, western medicine is more effective.
like, how do you say it, there are some women's illness diseases, western doctors cannot diagnose them.
he (she) said we english people did not listen to something like this -- how could you mention something like this so casually.
i think that is because of the fresher air, a lot of space, a slower pace of life, so people here live longer.
the western doctors said it was normal.
a study has shown that rich people live longer (laugh).
because we stayed at {location} and my husband brought my daughter out -- shopping before christmas -- and met {person}.
the medicine was expensive and the cost was not covered by the nhs, i paid for it myself.
but my husband is better because he has got quite a lot of friends.
they divided students by their results -- say top group, second group.
i felt my legs were very sore, i told them that i was very tired, but they did not stop talking.
like here there are some areas -- with a lot of single parents, they use bad language.
i went to watch films with my friends a few times, and my husband went to pick up the children.
the man said his cousin had the same name as him, but he was not working at the university.
it may be, because her teacher thought that her performance in the second group was quite good -- she also got a certificate.
she does not want people to feel disgusted with her.
she said they had their own life, she did not want to go and disturb them.
every wednesday, they go to 'place', a kind of centre for the elderly people -- they come and bring them out.
f: the children don't have to pay for the treatment if you go to see a western doctor, but not a chinese doctor.
i have not worked since i came here.
if you need further treatment, you have to join the long waiting list.
because we attended the class and our friends told us that the english people like that, you should say it in that way.
the medicine was expensive and the cost was not covered by the nhs, i paid for it myself.
after you take the children to the school, you don't have time to do much and then it is time to bring them home.
you have money, you can afford to see a doctor or to be ill.
she may have spent a lot of time on tidying the house.
i listen to him and find it very interesting.
f: i have a friend who is also from taiwan.
f: this behaviour is not just to the foreigners, he is a bit unkind.
we here -- medicine -- see £5 can last -- i found it very expensive.
i: but my previous flatmates from taiwan, they were able to get some part time jobs.
when i first came here, i was not familiar with the environment, i had no friends and also i felt the pressure, i felt very tired, really.
you eat "pai choi", you will have a lot of discharges, that is normal.
we went to the class and our teacher told us that if an english people asks "how are you", you must answer "fine", don't say, don't say you have any problems, they won't be prepared to listen to you.
there are more opportunities in taiwan, more opportunities in taiwan.
he (she) is a teacher, he (she) has the experience and he (she) did not worry.
if a western doctor can do nothing, then you need to see a chinese doctor.
it is because before we have a trip out, i have to do the packing.
f: the hardest period, that would be the first year.
a bit like an infection, they all got pregnant.
i find that the social benefits here are good.
you will feel -- i don't know how about in hong kong.
i was surprised to see one of the students -- because a girl who was my son's classmate in the primary school, she is also living in {location}, she came to see my son quite often.
yes, yes, i don't think you can't talk a lot.
he (she) went to a pub with us.
i saw the doctor once and took a long time to boil the medicine.
otherwise, i would not have been able to do that, if i had had to rush back to pick the children up.
if we were in taiwan, that would not matter because we were all chinese.
after crying, i still need a friend to talk with.
my husband always says that i should go out to know more people, but i think i am not good at communicating with people.
but it is better with the old lady, because she is quite old and also she is a bit forgetful.
so all the pressure is only temporary, it will not be -- if i thought about staying here forever, then i'd have a lot to consider.
i don't know, i don't know whether those people you are interviewing know english.
our situations are quite similar because her husband is also not young.
there is -- but, because, i have a friend who works in the chinese medicine centre, on saturday, they have a lot of foreign patients -- some of them are old men or old ladies.
our neighbours here are quite friendly.
also they are a bit different from us chinese.
but sometimes i still make some mistakes (laugh).
but chinese medicine can help, like we chinese say what sorts of things are "cold" and what sorts of things are "hot", isn't it?
f: our friend said that i care too much about what other people think of me.
i saw the doctor once and took a long time to boil the medicine.
the homework and project which my son is doing is very different from what we used to do.
in this area, here in {british location}, most of our neighbours are quite old.
i want my children going out with clean clothes, i don't want them to be dirty.
my husband always says that i should go out to know more people, but i think i am not good at communicating with people.
of course, you can't get the biscuits or bread twice.
f: i would take them, but he -- he said antibiotics are not effective.
he told me that his friend's mum did not wash his clothes for him -- every times he had a pe class, he used the spray to get rid of the odour.
very sloppy, so i gave up.
they help them to do what they can't do at home.
she does not want people to think she is troublesome.
you eat "pai choi", you will have a lot of discharges, that is normal.
i was surprised to see one of the students -- because a girl who was my son's classmate in the primary school, she is also living in {location}, she came to see my son quite often.
but sometimes i find my english is not very good, so i am not very close to them.
i spend a lot of time doing housework.
i don't want to pretend to be friendly.
that one is not good, it can be addictive.
f: my husband came here to study for a {qualification}, so we came along too.
so sometimes he has that kind of meal.
anyway, she is a good person.
i found that they are really very democratic.
rich people don't have to worry too much before they go to see a doctor.
for the subtraction, she knew how to do minus nine, minus 10, but not minus 11.
then my husband -- my husband's surname is {name}-- told him that his surname in chinese also means "{name}", so they were both "{name}" -- belonging to the royal family.
f: yes, now if i hear that, for example, someone has just come over to this country, and they are talking with foreigners, i will tell them, i will tell them if you say it in this way, the hearer will think you are very rude.
she said that if we had no friends, we could go to their house for christmas.
of course, there are some good chinese doctors, but you have to get to the right person.
but for the chronic illnesses, i think chinese medicine is better.
f: our children -- my son in the secondary school -- they have a lot of clothes.
of course, there are some good chinese doctors, but you have to get to the right person.
he said it is more important to take care of everything at home.
i did not go on some school trips with him.
but here students need to search for a lot of books and to plan how to go about their work.
it may be, because her teacher thought that her performance in the second group was quite good -- she also got a certificate.
it may be better for the children, but how about for the adults, for example, how about job opportunities, friends... f: yes, less good.
every time i ate "pai choi", i would have a noticeable reaction to it immediately.
now i've learned how to deal with it -- i also may not invite them into my house.
you said earlier that the life here is more relaxing.
also they are a bit different from us chinese.
this is why many foreigners visit taiwan and have the impression that chinese people are very warm-hearted.
but in taiwan, they all go to see chinese doctor.
my husband's english is also not very good, but he is very good at chatting with other people.
i found it quite hard when i first came here, but it is getting better now.
but now it is not easy to find a job.
for example, some doctors will talk a lot with you, but some just ask how you are and then you come out very quickly.
she pressed the bell and said she wanted to play with {son}.
she said they had their own life, she did not want to go and disturb them.
there are more opportunities in taiwan, more opportunities in taiwan.
i feel that some parts of my body have some problems.
he just worried that they might disturb other passengers.
f: yes, if i didn't feel well, i would go and see the doctor.
even in taiwan, the old generations and young generations are very different, they are really different.
i think -- are you wondering if those old people who came to this country earlier may not speak english and they may have this problem.
i listen to him and find it very interesting.
if you have relations, you can contact them sometimes.
yes, we have some contacts, but that is not as easy as it is in taiwan.
i asked her what year she was in -- year 5 -- in year 5, she still did not know how to do those things.
the next door old lady, she is clever.
the western doctors said it was normal.
also, sometimes when they come, our house may be a bit messy, then i may just chat with them outside the house for 10 mins or 15 mins.
f: firstly, i cannot find it possible to calm myself down, there are so many things to do and i cannot stop.
what you can get are those low class jobs -- such as a cleaner or something like that.
of course, relations can help.
so now i see some friends -- not from taiwan, friends from other countries, whom i met mainly in the english class, i see them making the same mistakes as i did.
he is not bad, he did not join in, but he did watch.
also the doctors, like what i said, the english people -- they said something very formally -- "how are you", "fine" -- just something like this.
i told him that i was bored, tired, and was not comfortable staying at home.
also, they give them tea and lunch.
but i think you can do the same because you are also willing to chat with people.
that is why the usage of the nhs -- the statistics are so low.
the problems were still there, but you had someone to talk to.
he simply puts them into the oven.
they stay in their bungalows and seldom move.
her health conditions, such {medical condition} might be a reason .
if you move to here, it would not be easy to deal with the society here.
when we were in taiwan, my husband was always very busy and i felt very bored at home all day.
f: he doesn't like going to see a doctor here.
i don't want to pretend to be friendly.
it turned out that that girl did not know how to do multiplication.
ice-cold food is not good for asthma.
i think religions can be a factor.
now we know they emphasise that, otherwise you are like a barbarian.
what he (she) said was not the same as the other doctor.
i find that the social benefits here are good.
the biggest difference between western medicine and chinese medicine is that, for western medicine, you will see the result in a few days, but for chinese medicine, it may take a few months, you have to wait.
i don't know, they are like that, they won't invite you inside and offer you a cup of tea.
i believe there are some good doctors and some bad doctors; it is not possible that all of them are good.
so now i see some friends -- not from taiwan, friends from other countries, whom i met mainly in the english class, i see them making the same mistakes as i did.
but children can't resist ice-cold food.
he (she) has a chinese student, who is a man and is quite old.
if we go out for many days, i will feel very exhausted.
i: because some women have told me that they have language problems.
the rest of the medicine was left untouched.
so her son helps her do the shopping every thursday and buys her a newspaper and a lottery ticket every saturday.
so he has a lot of friends.
every time i ate "pai choi", i would have a noticeable reaction to it immediately.
my husband organised the trip and then when we were back, i had to do the washing.
he is also quite friendly with the teachers.
i said it would not be clean by just using the spray, the stain would still be there.
although she wants her son to come to see her, but she does not force him do so.
if we go out for many days, i will feel very exhausted.
the doctors said -- sometimes, if they used spoken english which i didn't understand, i would ask them to clarify what they had said.
he did not use an inhaler in taiwan.
that one is not good, it can be addictive.
what he (she) said was not the same as the other doctor.
you are -- (she started to laugh) relax, it is alright (laugh).
in taiwan, we shouted for democracy for a long time, said how we chinese people should be, it was all the talk.
my husband is a serious person.
but chinese medicine can help, like we chinese say what sorts of things are "cold" and what sorts of things are "hot", isn't it?
if you are mentally healthy, you will have no problems.
but then this chinese man replied that he had been passing some black excrement (laugh).
after you take the children to the school, you don't have time to do much and
who can you go for if you still have any problems, since your friend is leaving.
they have a lot of foreign patients.
f: when i saw that my children were looked after well (laugh).
he started to use it here and it was not easy to stop.
if i used it every day, i found my throat was very sore and i didn't like it.
but our chinese mums will tell our children what is right and then ask them to follow it and not to make mistakes.
if you can't wash your hair or take a bath, they will help you.
he talked to my son, but my son did not believe it -- he found using it very convenient -- he was surprised to hear that it could be additive -- he felt in great pain without it.
i went to see chinese doctors in taiwan sometimes, i drank the medicine too.
the dental treatment is expensive.
because in taiwan they had a lot of homework, but here all the sudden -- he realised that he can have a different kind of life.
it is good to have a chance to speak a bit of english.
f: yes, it is so disordered in taiwan, very crowded.
their department is very tough, they needed to attend the classes, to do the course work, and also to take exams for many subjects.
i felt very exhausted.
this is why many foreigners visit taiwan and have the impression that chinese people are very warm-hearted.
he said it is more important to take care of everything at home.
so her son helps her do the shopping every thursday and buys her a newspaper and a lottery ticket every saturday.
because we thought most of the patients were chinese, but it was not so.
she pressed the bell and said she wanted to play with {son}.
after visiting them for a few times, you know which ones are good and will try to stick with them.
you have a stable income, that is very important, and you can live very healthily, i think (laugh).
for example, we chinese are not the same as them -- we are very courteous to our visitors -- "please come in and take a seat" -- unlike our neighbours; if you chatted with them at their front doors for half an hour, 45 mins, or even an hour, they still would not invite you to go inside.
they asked {person} to teach us english and we paid a little bit of money.
i listen to her on the phone, i think she is a bit impolite.
they stay in their bungalows and seldom move.
it is because before we have a trip out, i have to do the packing.
she will try to do things herself.
he (she) has a chinese student, who is a man and is quite old.
a bag of medicine costs £5, very expensive, it is very expensive.
sometimes a trip out is quite good.
although she said that she was very quiet, she seemed to be very relaxed and willing to share her views.
he told me that his friend's mum did not wash his clothes for him -- every times he had a pe class, he used the spray to get rid of the odour.
if you want to live in a nice place, then it is no problem.
her health conditions, such {medical condition} might be a reason .
