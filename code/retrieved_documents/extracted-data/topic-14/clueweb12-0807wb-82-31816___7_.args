as a general principle, if an effective herbal remedy is found, its safety and effectiveness are likely to be improved by purification and isolation of active components.the major traditional medicine of india is ayurveda which uses heavy metals (mercury, arsenic and lead) in quantities that exceed levels now considered to be safe.teaching unproven cam modalities so extensively in the core medical school curriculum rather than as electives is neither scientifically nor educationally appropriate, as it puts the imprimatur of scientific medicine as represented by medical schools on therapies that are anything but scientific.acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) is more pharmacologically useful and much better tolerated.that is the rational process for discovering and developing new, useful drugs, as has previously been done with numerous substances found in nature.if such is found it can be standardized for dose-risk and dose-therapeutic effect relations, and also provide a potential starting point for new, more specific (and therefore safer and more effective) synthetic analogues.acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is easier on the stomach than purified salicylic acid was, although aspirin still kills thousands of people annually.cocaine has a high potential for abuse both as pure cocaine hydrochloride and also as coca leaf.the usual order of things in medical education is that modalities to be included in the medical curriculum must first have considerable evidence of efficacy such that they are considered standard of care.we know that meditation, or relaxation, can decrease stress, and we know that excessive stress can be harmful to the body.we do, however, need doctors who are literate and can speak about non-medical pseudo-healing, so that they can approach conversations with their patients from knowledge.also, in nature the presence of multiple antipathogenic compounds probably has the advantage of delaying the evolution of resistance.no is an excellent antioxidant, several thousand times better than vitamin e. high no causes high atp via sgc allowing metabolic functions to operate well.artemisia annua tea is a fairly effective treatment for malaria, but concentrated derivatives of artemisinin (which is only one of several active compounds) are even better, and given the degree of misery malaria causes, patients who can afford them will prefer them.altering any of these regions changes biologic effects, and after much experience such “structure-activity” relationships both help us learn about how things work and allow pharmacologists to make educated guesses about what new alterations might be useful.
