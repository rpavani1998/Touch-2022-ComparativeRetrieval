while alternative explanations have been proposed, the surgery as originally described would have compromised the intrapleural space and collapsed her lungs without positive-pressure ventilation.
furthermore, many practitioners slide quickly into authoritarian interactions, or worse- insulated by money away from the social determinants of their patients’ diseases, they may come to think that their life represents a personal example that their slothful, slovenly patients should- must- follow.
the person in line at the kitchen telling jokes about the food might well be responsible for managing an epidemic of food-borne illness if the jokes turned out to be true.
there were, allegedly, multiple manuals appropriate for each province, focusing on more geographically appropriate treatments and conditions.

list of medications mentioned in the barefoot doctor’s manual what is interesting and undeniable about the barefoot doctors is that they were, ultimately, quickly and effectively trained, served without requiring enormous salaries, and were at least on some level closer in social status to their patients than doctors are in the us today.
even in med school, i have been told by instructors never to show doubt or uncertainty, and to take control of a patient interaction with authority.
china, the oldest bureaucracy on earth, had spent a humiliating century as a virtual trade colony, first to the english and portugese, then to japan.

it is worth pointing out that the korean war, which had just ended, had set communist china in full conflict with the capitalist west, and the first rumblings of the 1961 denunciation of the soviet union were straining the diplomacy between the world’s two communist superpowers.
the new beijing chinese medical institute offered enrichment classes to chinese practitioners in preventive medicine, new acupuncture, and standardized chinese prescriptions.
it only keeps them going to more doctors for answers.
this is a level of social levelling i have experienced as a paramedic, and seen even with physicians in very small towns, but which is overall lacking in the us.
traditional chinese medicine may not be traditional in its current form, but it is absolutely and irrevocably chinese.
furthermore, many practitioners slide quickly into authoritarian interactions, or worse- insulated by money away from the social determinants of their patients’ diseases, they may come to think that their life represents a personal example that their slothful, slovenly patients should- must- follow.
western-trained practitioners were few and urban.
only 14,000 practitioners passed the new exams with scores of 50% in part one and 60% in part two (the minima for certification) and in some regions the fail rate was 90%.

james reston’s famous article on how he had his appendix removed under acupuncture anesthesia started a revolution in the us- but in fact, his acupuncture was augmented with lidocaine and narcotic analgesics, something often not mentioned in secondary sources.
a blogger friend of mine recently wrote about the experience of having a doctor “issue pronouncements about other people’s bad habits,” in her case, type 2 diabetes.
doctors, after all, would be a privileged class of technocratic intellectuals, and would not be able to join with the peasants and workers.
they weren’t expected to go without shoes, but the term “barefoot doctor” came to represent this enforced humility.
for instance, despite a formal intent to create proletarian health care, possibly 20% of barefoot doctors went on to become professional doctors of western medicine.

brigades and communes would be able to designate members who showed an academic aptitude as well as an acceptable political outlook to undergo a training that lasted as little as six months.
this single, unified system, taught academically, was to replace the variable undocumented oral traditions of earlier chinese practice.
doctors can choose to be reassuring parent-figures with all the answers to their patients/clients problems, or they can choose to be allies and expert resources for their patients/clients seeking solutions to their medical and health issues.
good luck in your medical student career.

i think most of us are socialized to expect definite answers and don’t like not getting them.
since the 1971 explosion of information in the us about “traditional” chinese medicine, the barefoot doctors have been heavily romanticized by westerners looking for a more friendly vision of what health care could be.
it is reasonable to assume that these existed, and it is reasonable to assume that barefoot doctors who had been issued penicillin (good then as now against syphillis) and chlorpromazine (listed in the manual as a “tranquilizer”) would probably have been familiar with these less decorous disorders.

mao had commanded that post-revolutionary china would be “new,” “scientific,” and “unified” and this had to include healthcare.
to some extent this is what patients expect- its what they’ve grown up with, after all- and to behave otherwise is to seem un-doctorly.
i also agree that doctors do us no favours appearing certain of the diagnosis when it is by no means certain.
the ministry of health came under attack for its policies, and in 1954 mao dictated that “scientizing” chinese medicine would not be sufficient to bring about his goal of a unified health care system.

there were few medical records and no oversight.
their training included an intensive background in public health and sanitation, a stripped-down western-style pharmaceutical toolkit, acupuncture and herbs.

living on the patient side of a undiagnosable condition, i can tell you that the practice of bluffing patients with certainty does them no favors.

here, china is following in the footsteps of the soviet union, which rejected “bourgeois genetics” in favor of lysenkoism; in many ways the chinese were lucky, since unlike comrade trofim’s eternal punchline, chinese medicine did actually have a multi-millenial history of empiric refinement.
