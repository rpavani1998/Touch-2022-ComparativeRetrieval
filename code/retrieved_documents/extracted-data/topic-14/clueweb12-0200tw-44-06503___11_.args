an holistic approach is far more sensible and offers freedom to choose the right treatment for a certain problem.acupunture is a safe and very effective way to treat many problems, especially those to do with muscular function.acupuncture is proven to be effective the central theme of chinese medicine is to try to find a natural way of healing disease, like researching the various healing potentials of herbs and even daily fruit and vegetables, whereas western medicine is taking a completely different approach which aims to acheive instant result through invasive or synthetic method.i had severe psoriasis and after years of steroid creams which never helped i was able to cure it through a combination of herbal medicine and acupuncture both based on ancient prescriptions rather than topically suppressing the herbs acted on the cause and improved my digestion and general health and left me glowing with health and for the first time clear skin.the fact that the placebo effect is so powerful and that the human mind is hard wired to detect causality when none exists, means that these charlatans can continue fleecing people.of course, we also live in a society that is devastating habitat, the same habitat that produced most of our medicine, and quite likely (from modern research) has many possible cures for cancer (for example).tuberculosis for instance, was diminishing substantially before the introduction of vaccination.acupuncture could be damping down pain through a natural painkiller called adenosine.herbal or acupuncture is a very good and non-invasive way of treatment.one of the major issues with western medicine is that is totally profit driven - the ideal product for a drug company is one which will suppress symptoms while you use the product only to have them come back in full once you stop this creates a life long customer - a product that actually solved the problem would be bad as it would limit the potential sales.the drug, called deoxycoformycin, boosted the effects of acupuncture dramatically, more than tripling how long the pain relief lasted.peer review etc is great but western medicine has a rough history of horrors from thalidomide to shock treatment - our medical approach is totally different and has caused massive amounts of harm - scientific thought 100 years ago seems horrific and ridiculous now where as chinese medicine has a much longer and deeper history and does not use such invasive techniques - it is also based on the study of living healthy humans with the goal being to maintain that healthy state rather than being based on the study of cadavers and focused on the already sick.acupuncture has relieved my bronchial/asthma considerably and has given me a new lease of life.but this opens the possibility that people will abandon genuinely efficacious, double blind tested courses of treatment for more serious ailments in favour of quack treatments.including medical advances such as numerous vaccines, the elimination of smallpox, women being much less likely to die in childbirth, organ donation, blood transfusion, anti-biotics etc.
