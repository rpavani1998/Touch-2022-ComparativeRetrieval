if one hopes to systematically investigate illnesses and efficiently develop effective therapies, there simply is no substitute for an accurate, science-based understanding of anatomy, physiology, and the etiology of disease.likewise, chemical fertilizers may be more expensive than livestock manure, but they are vastly more effective on a per-unit-of-weight basis and much less likely to result in the transmission of salmonella, e. coli, and other pathogens to human or animal consumers.such research is not only costly, but reductionistic because traditional prescriptions are often intended to produce simultaneous or synergistic actions such as site-specific attack on the disease, enhanced immune response, increased cellular uptake, and repression of side effects.ethnomedicine advocates insist that local medical practices and husbandry techniques offer great potential benefit to local farmers and pastoralists, and that local knowledge and expertise should take precedence over that stemming from "outside" cultures.finally, investments in the study and application of useful local knowledge, practice and social organization can produce another important benefit: renewed respect for local cultures and technologic knowledge.this epistemic charity dehumanizes us by denying us the capacity for a reasoned modification of our beliefs in the light of better evidence made available by the methods of modern science.modern synthetic antimalarial drugs, however, are less toxic and more effective than quinine, and have largely replaced it.females are also regarded to be less vulnerable to illness than male children, meaning that less elaborate measures are necessary to protect their health.all these benefits can add up to a fresh sense of local confidence and control, stronger social structures, andempowerment of people to work together at the local level - whether independently or with nonhegemonic formal-sector support - to solve more of their own development problems.health care allocation and ethnographic data suggest that selective neglect (passive infanticide) may be occurring in rural peru, possibly as a means of regulating family size and sex ratio.for instance, when cost or lack of availability preclude the use of more safe and effective modern pharmaceuticals, it makes sense to exploit herbal or traditional therapeutic agents likely to be safe and at least marginally effective.all systems may 'work'; in practice, all have successes and failures, with some systems scoring much higher in particular areas of medicine, depending on the social, cultural, and economic context in which they are applied, as well as on their biomedical bases.many modern paraherbalists maintain that plants are not only the safest way to administer medicine, but also the most effective.of course, modern science has been so wildly successful that it's only feasible to effectively malign and depreciate it if one willfully mischaracterizes and misapprehends it.one of the most fundamental assumptions of ethnomedical philosophy (if not cultural anthropology in general) is that, even though third world peoples seem overwhelmingly eager to join in the scientific revolution and enjoy the abundant fruits of modern science and technology, they should be "spared the negative impact such fruits are certain to incur on their cultures."
