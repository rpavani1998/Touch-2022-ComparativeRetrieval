one of the long-standing mysteries surrounding acupuncture is why the technique only seems to alleviate pain if needles are inserted at specific points.
it took a lot of time, waiting for my turn, getting the needles and chatting with the doctor about regimen and mental health.
of course, the acupuncture industry isn't going to let go that easily, and interprets such results with truculence: "see," they cry, "acupuncture is so great that evenplacebo acupuncture works!
scientists and sceptics alike have no problem with the possibility that acupuncture has a painkilling effect, so this study doesn't contradict them.
30 may 2010 9:19pm chinese herbs and acupuncture cured my ailments and those of other people i know.
people need comfort and love, the world can be a sucky place.
as a practical matter, i don't really care if acupuncture is a placebo (i don't think it is).
after a half-hour session, the mice felt less discomfort in their paws because the needles triggered the release of a natural painkiller, say the researchers.
it was probably a pinched/trapped nerve i had about that time that didn't fully go away.
blind quasi-religious belief that 'western' medicine is the only sensible option to treat medical ailments is both ignorant and dangerous.
the acupunture had no effect at all in either group if the needles were not rotated.
i am no scientist and have no vested interest, i only went for the treatment in desparation because the 'conventional' drugs really didnt work.
nobody suggested that western medicine (you know, the real science is not good) is backward or bad, every single treatment should eventually be able to have a scientific explanation, but it doesn't mean that we should reject acupuncture totally.

but the thought of getting your liver, kidneys, stomach lining, damaged by painkillers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen etc, appeals to you.
i also consider your spiritual and psychological well-being to be vital to your health.
jill adair at handcross did some studies of traditional chinese acupuncture treatment of large draught animals and translated it into small animal terms.
i was really surprised at the arrogance of some of my colleagues.
the more pain the mice were in, the faster they pulled away.
therefore, all those diseases are not eradicated, they are just suppressed - mutating and waiting for a future generation of humans to wipe out.
"the view that acupuncture does not have much benefit beyond the placebo effect has really hampered research into the technique," said maiken nedergaard, a neuroscientist at the university of rochester medical centre in new york, who led the study.
and for that i accept and embrace a whole bunch of things that do not need to show their proof, since it's just about feeling better.
milkmen vend spurious milk, grocers spurious sugar, smashers spurious coin; but surely cows are not to be numbered with such malefactors as producers of spurious pox!
half of the mice lacked a gene that is needed to make adenosine receptors, which are dotted along major nerves.
well, unless you're allergic to sugar pills or water.
it was also not covered by the national health plan.
eventually, jenner faced facts for he could no longer credibly claim otherwise:"cases of smallpox after inoculation are innumerable." william white: "
it's not very scientific.
the fact that the placebo effect is so powerful and that the human mind is hard wired to detect causality when none exists, means that these charlatans can continue fleecing people.
we can benefit from what has been learned over many thousands of years," nedergaard told the guardian.
further tests on the mice revealed that levels of adenosine surged 24-fold in the tissues around the acupuncture needles during and immediately after each session.
i remember some time ago a study showing that acupuncture was a placebo.
but then you could just as easily choose anywhere else, as the previous study proved (notwithstanding the mumbo-jumbo about qi and magic meridians connecting your middle toe with your tonsils or whatever).
it avoids me taking a pain killer almost every day, which over time will not be good for the rest of my body.
it just underlines how far western civilization has come in 400 years, and really how stuck non experimental and non-observational medicine remains.
traditional practitioners claim acupuncture works by improving the flow of "qi energy" along "meridians", butthe latest research, published in nature neuroscience, points to a less mystical explanation.
without adenosine receptors, the chemical will have no effect on the mice when it is released in their bodies.
needles are not twisted on a regular basis.
choosing the knee to stop foot pain makes sense because the knee is between the source of the pain and its destination (the brain).
the drug, called deoxycoformycin, boosted the effects of acupuncture dramatically, more than tripling how long the pain relief lasted.
if you are prescribed sugar pills, it is "sham", not "random".

31 may 2010 7:50am i'm not medically trained so i don't consider myself qualified to comment on the merits of acupuncture (unlike a lot of the posters above).
tuberculosis for instance, was diminishing substantially before the introduction of vaccination.
herbal or acupuncture is a very good and non-invasive way of treatment.
31 may 2010 5:12am chinese medicine, for me, is mainly mumbo jumbo - sorry @thestrangeones.
31 may 2010 5:53am having been urged by a specialist who could not find any answer to a life threatening breathing problem to go and try anything that i thought might help, that he would provide any support needed in any alternative treatment that i undertook, and, most of all, to get back and tell him if anything worked, i eventually found my way to acupuncture.
pilate and toga for the back, assorted rubber bands and balls for the wrist.
in keeping with traditional practice, the needles were rotated periodically throughout the half-hour session.
the words had been employed, not to describe any irregularity on the part of the cow, but certain irregularities in the action of cowpox on the part of the vaccinated : which was to say that when the vaccinated recovered creditably and did not catch smallpox, the cowpox was genuine; but when the sequences were otherwise, why then it was spurious!
painkillers are great for acute pain, but terrible for long term pain for me.
the therapy session involved inserting a fine needle into an acupuncture point in the knee above the sore foot.
i took three weekly sessions for three years after a very nasty hiv primary infection.
western science is bankrupt and if it doesn't find its heart soon, we're all up the proverbial creek without the manoeuvring equipment.
well its not really pain, just a it annoying, i can live with it but not sure what it might develop to when i'm older.
one of the long-standing mysteries surrounding acupuncture is why the technique only seems to alleviate pain if needles are inserted at specific points.
writing in the journal, nedergaard's team describe how acupuncture reduced pain by two thirds in normal mice, but had no effect on the discomfort of mice that lacked the adenosine receptor gene.
in a final experiment, nedergaard's team injected mice with a cancer drug that made it harder to remove adenosine from their tissues.
the acupunture had no effect at all in either group if the needles were not rotated.
study after study after meta analysis have shown the acupuncture is no better, or worse, than a placebo.
just because science is unable to understand or quantify something does not mean its rubbish - physics could not explain how a bumble bee could fly until recently but that does not mean they never flew.
i have a bad back and damaged wrist, and the only thing that helps in the end is stretching and exercise.
you can't know nothing about it and be able to make a judgement about it.
but last week i had toothache - western equipment and medicine helped to alleviate that and acupuncture probably cannot.
it's like defining all sports as "not rugby" and then saying that football is dangerous because mountaineering is, and they're both not rubgy, and therefore footballers may suffer injuries falling several thousand feet.
31 may 2010 4:11am would it not be better to work on a drug based on adenosine or cheaper versions of the cancer drug which boosts its effect.
it changed it from being chronic to mildly irritating and has greatly improved my life quality.

i had pins in the soft tissue between the thumb and index finger and when the pins were twiddled i felt such a surge of something through my body, much like an electric shock, that my whole body jolted up off the table.
i'd also make sure that multiple medications shouldn't be conflicting, so ensuring anyone administering you knows what else you're being treated for.
31 may 2010 3:26am kenbarlow and yet, after a 4000+ year history of epidemics, not a single person has been infected with smallpox since 1978.
it is also highly individual, so there is no right answer for everyone, just a right answer for an individual.
i would consider a lot of the truly "alternative" therapies in the second category, along with things like counseling, religion, team sports and recreation drug use.
nedergaard said that twisting the needles seems to cause enough damage to make cells release adenosine.
one needle inserted into a specific place on that muscle sent what can only be described as an electric shock through it, and with exercise for a few days to prevent re-spasming, my knee is functioning normally.
acupuncture works on the meridians an energy network that will baffle and annoy the flat earth western medical fraternity - acupuncture and tcm have been practiced for thousands of years and they are massively popular in asia because they work.
in effect, the muscle had atrophied and had stopped working.

acupuncture is labour and time intensive.
the scientists gave each mouse a sore paw by injecting it with an inflammatory chemical.
the vaccinated caught smallpox; they fell sick after the operation; they were afflicted with eruptions and swellings; they died.
taking some form of drug, be it synthesized or naturally occurring, or some form of physical therapy seems to me to be able to affect my physiological state.
thanks to the progressives you rather naively praise.
writing in the journal, nedergaard's team describe how acupuncture reduced pain by two thirds in normal mice, but had no effect on the discomfort of mice that lacked the adenosine receptor gene.
all of the three acupuncturists that i have used have been quick to refer a patient to a western trained doctor for issues that they can better address.
so there's a place for all types of medicine in this world, we don't just have to rely on a prescription sheet with unreadable writing on it.
nedergaard believes that most of these points are along major nerve tracks, and as such are parts of the body that have plenty of adenosine receptors."....except that this study http://www.docbug.com/blog/archives/000353.html showed that random acupuncture works as well as formal acupuncture as a pain killer- in other wordsit doesnt work any better if the needles are just stuck in anywhere so bang goes the adenosine receptor theory 30 may 2010 7:44pm
for 6 years i have not had much of a feeling in my right small finger, it would go numb sometimes, and down my right side lower arm too.
you can also lump the placebo effect in here too, since you can put that down somewhat to wanting to be better.
molecules of such complexity and unimaginable structure, in many cases, that they cannot be conjured by the human mind.
the needles stimulated cells to produce adenosine, an anti-inflammatory and painkilling chemical, that was effective for up to an hour after the therapy was over.
to measure how effective the acupuncture was, the researchers recorded how quickly each mouse pulled its sore paw away from a small bristly brush.
often at great cost to their finances and their health.

its the same process that you prefer, civilisation, that is destroying these natural cures.
the chemical is then picked up by adenosine receptors on nearby nerves, which react by damping down pain.
chinese medicine, for me, is mainly mumbo jumbo - sorry @thestrangeones.
years of living an hour by hour essence had left residual scars, and a fragile health.
acupuncture could be damping down pain through a natural painkiller called adenosine.
31 may 2010 5:10am i have a sense that a lot of the naysayers have never had acupuncture.
and in humans, the better-designed a clinical trial of acupuncture is, the weaker the effect.

maybe this also released some adenosine.
the more pain the mice were in, the faster they pulled away.
only 2nd in amazement after being able to see properly with no glasses after laser eye surgery.
the needles stimulated cells to produce adenosine, an anti-inflammatory and painkilling chemical, that was effective for up to an hour after the therapy was over.
western medical science never works on the causes and prevention, it concentrates itself exclusively on symptoms.
peer review etc is great but western medicine has a rough history of horrors from thalidomide to shock treatment - our medical approach is totally different and has caused massive amounts of harm - scientific thought 100 years ago seems horrific and ridiculous now where as chinese medicine has a much longer and deeper history and does not use such invasive techniques - it is also based on the study of living healthy humans with the goal being to maintain that healthy state rather than being based on the study of cadavers and focused on the already sick.
i didnt believe it would work, i didn't believe in all this chinese mumbo jumbo my friends were telling me here in asia with praying at temples and worshipping the dead and needles in certain areas of my neck and back - i always believed x-rays and medicine or surgery would get rid off anything wrong with me.....did it hell.
of course, we also live in a society that is devastating habitat, the same habitat that produced most of our medicine, and quite likely (from modern research) has many possible cures for cancer (for example).

this does not mean acupuncture 'works' better than placebo and the study doesn't show this.
western medicine (surgery) works magic.
please, do stop being ignorant and narrow-minded, a medical system that has been the sole healing system in practice for billions of people for thousands of years just could not possibly be total rubbish.
also, i guess heart issues appeal to you.
the cowpox used could not have been genuine cowpox, but spurious; and for awhile spurious cowpox did yeoman's service in the way of apology; but by-and-by the excuse began to work more harm than good.

whilst it only cured the back pain temporarily a side effect was that it completely cured the rsi in my forearms, which i hadn't even told the practitioner about.
and i was a student fortunately my physician (a consultant oncologist) was a kind and generous man and waived most of his fees.
photograph: jon feingersh/getty images scientists have performed acupuncture on mice with sore paws to pinpoint how the ancient chinese medical practice might alleviate pain in humans.
choosing the knee to stop pain in a finger only makes sense if the painkilling effect is spread throughout the body - which it could be.
what it doesn't do is show that any of the numerous claims about acupuncture curing disease or other conditions (except as a placebo) has any basis in fact.
30 may 2010 10:19pm acupuncture and chinese herbs really helped improve my chronic hayfever after 30+ of suffering from it.

but this opens the possibility that people will abandon genuinely efficacious, double blind tested courses of treatment for more serious ailments in favour of quack treatments.
therefore, the target diseases/physical problems for both system of treatment are different, they could overlap at times, but do not contradict, that's why acupuncture is classified as alternative/complementary treatment, not 'anti-western medicine treatment".

it is an activity that relies on values measurable by its own standards which works magically in short term, but is disasterous in long one, as it is painfully obvious these days.
if they had they would know that the 'needle' used is not really a needle, but a thread of steel, so fine that it is absolutely painless when inserted.
without adenosine receptors, the chemical will have no effect on the mice when it is released in their bodies.
what i found encouraging was that the chinese doctor was not only knowledgeable in his own field but was also trained in 'western medicine'.
i am watching a program right now on c4 about the 5 great british scientists of the c17 - newton, hooke, wren etc - great stuff.
it sullies our intellectual discourse to give the time of day to any of these ideas.
eventually, by chance we discovered the cause, and highly sophisticated western medicine corrected the problem.
nedergaard believes that most of these points are along major nerve tracks, and as such are parts of the body that have plenty of adenosine receptors.
sometimes i wonder if the acupuncture treament, which i took instead of antiretroviral treatment that in the early 90's was a living hell, didn't prepare the terrain for a smooth antiretroviral treatment in the following years.
scientific explanation is important, but discarding a method which clearly worked (on a large scale) just because no scientific explanation is yet found, you would be missing out a lot.
in keeping with traditional practice, the needles were rotated periodically throughout the half-hour session.
but i do know a highly qualified doctor and extremely medical establishment who is trained in, and practices acupuncture.

further tests on the mice revealed that levels of adenosine surged 24-fold in the tissues around the acupuncture needles during and immediately after each session.
one of the major issues with western medicine is that is totally profit driven - the ideal product for a drug company is one which will suppress symptoms while you use the product only to have them come back in full once you stop this creates a life long customer - a product that actually solved the problem would be bad as it would limit the potential sales.
i look forward to a time when science can start to measure subtle energies in the body and our understanding of the complexity of humanity gets much deeper than its current simplistic and shallow view.
i would rather have a none invasive technique solve the problem than take a drug which invades the whole body, e.g. the acupuncture i have about every 12 months eliminates the back pain (i have 3 lower back ruptured disks), or i can take 400 mg of ibuprofen every day for the same effect.
acupuncture is proven to be effective the central theme of chinese medicine is to try to find a natural way of healing disease, like researching the various healing potentials of herbs and even daily fruit and vegetables, whereas western medicine is taking a completely different approach which aims to acheive instant result through invasive or synthetic method.
homeopathy may be nonsense but that doesn't mean that every non-western treatment is.

i couldn't help myself but to bang with my fist against the leg.
the drug, called deoxycoformycin, boosted the effects of acupuncture dramatically, more than tripling how long the pain relief lasted.
the world is still full with so many amazing things that we cannot comprehend and its worthwhile being open minded - open minded people are the ones who have created progress on earth and those who blindly adhere to orthodox opinions are the ones who killed galileo etc science is so important and valid but its worth remembering that todays scientific theories often seem ridiculous in 100 years time.
these are all side effects that i've suffered from western medicines.
in my case the acupuncture was an added 'boost' to the herbs which, over time, did the trick.
science's credentials are being destroyed by this combination of "i don't believe it because i haven't read it because it sounds bonkers, therefore it's rubbish".
the procedure involves inserting fine needles at specific points around the body and then heating, twisting or even electrifying them.

i am a full believer in good science, but when it comes to some of the more 'out there' things that could be tested, it seems a lot of scientists would rather shout 'impossible' than get on and actually do any real science on the matter.
