chinese medicine blog- about everything that is chinese medicine.
as i see their benefits and think that they are very powerful, studying them is almost like a punishment, and let’s face

between you and me, if he would have done his homework properly, he would know better than to mention homeopathy, because than he would know that you don’t mix cm with homeopathy.
after all, if he mentioned the chinese philosophy, the “mess” that reflects from his article regarding qi and acupuncture points could have been avoided, the reader would know that there’s something behind it all.
at first we went through the article, thinking this is yet another person who thinks he knows something about cm (but really doesn’t), but we saw that the person writing the article has very strong opinions in regards of the cm, how effective and what stands behind it.

10 chinese medicine links you must bookmark posted on january 26, 2008 by yael5 comments the world wide web is packed with so many websites and blogs, that sometimes you just don’t know how to reach them all, which is good and which is, well, not so good.
in the book he shows, among other things, how cm can be used to treat the shen, and he brings us dr. shen’s theory- his own teacher and mentor.

we were thinking about what should be a good way to start this new platform, and we have decided that it’s best to start with introducing this blog’s intentions and missions: this blog is going to grow due to the love we have for chinese medicine, and will have 100% chinese medicine oriented content.
