captain paul watson i also received an e-mail from a man named eugene ahn in response to one of  my quotes in the new york times.
for defending seals, we are anti-canadian, anti-norwegian, anti-russian, and anti-namibian.
would you prefer that we chinese give up our  culture and identity and conform to western diet, medicine, and language?
has it come to this that defenders of endangered species and  protectors of oceanic ecosystems are to be called racist for practicing,  promoting, and enforcing conservation?
on the contrary, my one child is half chinese and i have quite a few chinese in-laws, all of whom are opposed to shark fin soup, by the way.

there is no scientific validity to the claims that shark fin is a health benefit.
it's not chinese medicine that brought the world heroin or vicodin or oxycontin  or vioxxx, all of which are infinitely worse for people than a shark's  fin.
ninety percent of shark fins come from sharks where the body has been wastefully discarded.
the slaughter of sharks is a crime against nature and it is a crime under international and national laws.
a hundred million sentient  creatures a year massacred for non-nutritive purposes, slaughtered for vanity,  and justified by culture.
have the japanese been eating whale burgers for hundreds of years?
it is a fact that over 100 million sharks are being slaughtered each year and a great majority of this slaughter is to provide shark fins for tasteless, non-nutritive, expensive, superstitious soup meant to impress family and friends as a status symbol.
have they even been eating burgers for hundreds of years?
the shark is an essential species in maintaining the health of oceanic  ecosystems, and especially, of ocean reef communities.
the campaign against shark finning has nothing to do with race and culture  and everything to do with the conservation of important species that fulfill  valuable niches within oceanic ecological systems.
my cultural ignorance may be bewildering, but your ecological ignorance  is despicable and as far as i am concerned ecology trumps culture any day.
and even if there were valid claims, the destruction of the world's sharks is not worth the benefits.
talk about unoriginal name calling.
there is not a shred of scientific evidence to demonstrate any medicinal  benefits of shark fins or shark cartilage.
there are no western whalers hunting whales for ambergris which comes only from  the sperm whale and the only nation hunting sperm whales is japan.
this represents between 18,000 and 22,000 sharks.
we probably have a campaign to offend anyone and everyone at some  time.
i find the chinese to be no better or no worse than every other mis-guided, anthropocentric, nature-abusing hominids anywhere.
every year, i haul hundreds of miles of illegally-set long lines from the oceans and intercept poachers with cargos of shark fins.
now it appears it is  racist to defend sharks.
we oppose whaling, sealing, and illegal fishing by any  people regardless of race, culture, or religious beliefs.
it's not chinese medicine that brought the world heroin or vicodin or oxycontin or vioxxx, all of which are infinitely worse for people than a shark's fin.
i sent the following reply to hsing lee: to hsing lee, i don't fall for the racist guilt crap.
the thrill of seeing them in the wild, of swimming with them, is a far more stimulating and exciting experience than slurping down their boiled fins in a broth at some wedding banquet.
you fight off sickness faster when you drink it.
from the point of view of a shark, the  violation is extremist and violent, and the perpetrators (those who slaughter  and consume the shark) have displayed an arrogant insensitivity to their  welfare and survival both as individual sentient creatures and as species.
you are using race to cover up your support for a product which is causing incredible ecological damage to oceanic eco-systems.
it was china  that actually introduced opium to the west and heroin is an extract of opium.
captain paul watson i also received an e-mail from a man named eugene ahn in response to one of my quotes in the new york times.
the chinese may very well have eaten shark fin for centuries, but there are now more chinese people than there are sharks in the sea and we are killing them at a rate of a hundred million a year.
let me see, for defending whales, we are anti-japanese, anti-norwegian,  anti-icelandic, and anti-native american.

is my respect for and concern for the survival of sharks worthy of less  respect than a person who desires to harm them?
it's as traditional a  dish as steak and potatoes.
so, i guess it is not  surprising to now be called a racist for defending sharks.
and unlike westerners and their whale killing for ambergris, we  chinese actually put the rest of the shark on people's dinner tables.
i've been called a racist for defending whales, seals, fish, elephants, and  trees, and for speaking out about human over-population.
i have swam with sharks, with hammerheads, silkys, galapagos, whitetip, blacktip, nurse, blue, thresher, whale, basking, dogfish, giant mantas, tigers, makos, and great whites.
you see, when you work without pay because you feel that the entire future of the planet is at stake, this is viewed as a luxury.

my answer to eugene was: my reference to whale burgers marries the idea of a western company like disney incorporating local cultural for profit.
the tone of this entire article [referring to the article in the herald tribune and the new york times] is ignorant, racist, and just more china and chinese bashing by a bunch of fucking nazi crackers who think only western ways are good or proper and everyone else is immoral.
the criticism that opposition to the consumption of sharks is western  imperialism and ethnocentric is ridiculous.
your cultural ignorance is bewildering.
this is his protest: you have some western prejudice in play here on your part.
next  time, please make sense.
this is the lamest and laziest attempt at supporting the cause against  shark hunting i've ever heard.
well, it did not take long.
rejecting the cultural justification for slaughter commentary by paul watson sea shepherd conservation society
hsing lee makes quite a few factual errors in his protest.
it is yourÂ  remarks which are ignorant and racist.
it was china that actually introduced opium to the west and heroin is an extract of opium.
from the point of view of a shark, the violation is extremist and violent, and the perpetrators (those who slaughter and consume the shark) have displayed an arrogant insensitivity to their welfare and survival both as individual sentient creatures and as species.
shark fin is not  as traditional a dish in china as steak and potatoes is for westerners for the  simple reason that the cost of between $100 and $400 per bowl makes it a  restricted dish available only to the wealthy.
anyways, back to being a racist for saving sharks.
last year, i found 100 plus silky  sharks entangled and dead in a net that was caught on the rocks a hundred feet  down, off the world heritage site of malpelo island, colombia.
have we  descended so low that we are now using culture to defend the extermination of  species?
in doing so, you also expose your own racism by labeling any person who is  opposed to the massive slaughter of sharks as a nazi.
should we accept the diminishment of the health of the oceans for a bowl of  soup and justify it because it is a "cultural" dish?
the japanese, in fact, say they have been eating whale meat for hundreds of  years.
does that mean disneyland in japan is now  going to be having whale burgers?" asked paul watson, the founder and  president of the sea shepherd conservation society, in friday harbor, wash.

as far as i am concerned, there is only one race and that is the human  race, and ecologically speaking the entire race is predominantly ignorant,  destructive, and suicidal.
i guess that's why we are opposing disneyland.
but the offense works both ways.
just last week, a san diego court found a hong kong company guilty of possessing nearly 70,000 pounds of shark fins without utilizing the remaining 96% of the bodies.
lee apparently believes that it is part of the traditional chinese culture for chinese couples to have disney character fantasy weddings where traditional shark fin soup is served.

you are hiding behind race because you do not have the facts to back up your ridiculous belief that shark fin soup is a benefit to health.
as far as i am concerned, there is only one race and that is the human race, and ecologically speaking the entire race is predominantly ignorant, destructive, and suicidal.
we are asking people to be ecologically responsible and sensitive to the fact that shark species have been diminished in all species from 60% up to 95%.
we even use the highly elastic bone and tendon.
i find it amazing that saving sharks is viewed by some as "cultural imperialism" yet disney character fantasy marriages, and the entire disney americanization of local culture is embraced.

i have interviewed reputable chinese  medical practioneers who have told me that there is no validity to these claims.
your accusation that westerners are killing whales for ambergris is way out of date.
paul watson there may be many who disagree with me but the rights of a species to survive on this planet take absolute precedence over the "rights" of a cultural practice or tradition by groups of humans.
we are all on the same  spaceship, hsing.

i was sent a response from a man named hsing lee who believes that the entire campaign to stop people from eating shark fin soup is motivated by anti-chinese passions.

in other  words, environmental activists have the luxury of sleeping in trees and not  owning a home, a car, or recreational vehicles.
the fact is that  there are many chinese who are speaking out against shark finning.
