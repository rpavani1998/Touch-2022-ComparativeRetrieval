enter michael moore, a man whose aerophobia kept him close to his southwestern home base, and who loved to get in his truck and drive to remote areas of the west to learn, teach and harvest herbs for his homemade potions.
the compromise, which is the financial advantage, is probably more the reason as i can"t imagine that someone has not discussed these other matters with him.
the reasons that these methods continue to be resorted to is because conventional western medicine based on expensive technological procedures and synthetic drugs, for various reasons is not always the best approach for all conditions, in much the same ways that exclusive reliance on fossil fuels is unsatisfactory for all of our energy needs.
few of us can fathom the threat posed by these companies.
originally coordinated to help raise funds for michael's medical expenses, now it will be not only a fine educational event but also a celebration of this great herbalist's life and legacy.
i refer you to an article by dr. jonathan wright published in january 2004, reporting that dr. henry mcintosh, a highly respected cardiologist at baylor university, observing the results of heart bypass surgery over the course of 15 years, said, “despite a low operative mortality and rate of graft closure, available data in the literature do not indicate that myocardial infarctions, arrhythmias or congestive heart failure will be prevented, or that life will be prolonged in the vast majority of patients.
(i suggest that any statements that are made pro or con be checked with an impartial web organization such as http://www.politifact.com/. ) when you receive bogus emails like the one mentioned above, consider how powerful the insurance and for-profit medical lobbies are, how they have congresspeople in their pockets, and how willing they are to spend millions on negative propaganda to prevent universal health care from happening in the united states.
personally i think this says volumes about the kind of man michael moore was: at the core of his being, he was a man of genius, deep caring and generosity.
failure to address the underlying cause of disease results in the widespread use and abuse of stronger synthetic alternatives.
you see, back in the ‘70s (and even continuing up to the present day somewhat,) the extent of our knowledge of north american herbs might have been summed up with ginseng, goldenseal, sassafras and sarsaparilla, which grow east of the rockies.
it's certainly not news that some people die from the flu.
michael mainly wanted to sell enough so he could continue his passion, which was to go either alone or with a small number of adventurous students on his herbal forays through the mountains, deserts, forests and canyons west of the rocky mountains.
glaxosmithkline, the maker of the anti-flu drug relenza, is also an investor boom with a steep increase of its stock prices.

he published his own herbal,the english physitian (1652), arguing that "no man deserved to starve to pay an insulting, insolent physician," when he could obtain his herbs from the nearby countryside.
(in other words,) we"d get together to exclude non registered or unqualified practitioners and agree on what herbs could and could not be used, etcetera).
the bountiful alliance is a 501 c-3 non-profit organization and is able to issue receipts for tax purposes.
i never understood why until years later, when michael explained that he remembered my wandering into his booth and that he was sure i had pilfered one of his herbal extracts.
it's obscene, the service is usually barely adequate -- ask anyone who has had a medical emergency.
michael leaves us a rich legacy of herbal knowledge and wisdom, the fruit of over 40 years of his passionate explorations of the fundamental healing relationship between plants, the earth and humankind.
in this way, they are able to benefit from lower operational costs and can bypass national regulations because international regulations, are weaker and more difficult to enforce.
i'm happy for him, but it doesn't go unnoticed by me thatbecause a few nurses must receive such a generous pay and benefits, the hospitals are understaffed and a patient's single overnight stay could cost from $15,000 to $20,000!
most of us are not likely to find the kind of healing we deserve and need from mainstream medicine.
no herbal reference library should be considered complete without michael moore's three major books, medicinal plants of the mountain west, medicinal plants of the desert and canyon west, and medicinal plants of the pacific west.
through this path, i think i received a wonderful education.
the new laws also stipulate that the only herbal medicines that will be sold over the counter will be ones used to treat "'mild and self-limiting' conditions - basically meaning nothing worse than a cold.
while there are no immediate signs that such regulations will extend to the united states, there is reason for concern that with the heightened atmosphere toward increased regulation generally, it could become a concern for those who rely on herbal supplements in the united states.
last may, i took a trip to italy with my grandson.
the reason for the plethora of drug side effects is precisely because of their concentration and the focus being largely directed to muffling symptoms rather than promoting rejuvenation and cure.

in a similar way, michael moore's three books on the medicinal uses of herbs west of the rocky mountains will remain as the quintessential source reference for this area for many years to come.
true to his nature as one attracted to the more esoteric fringe aspect of any endeavor, michael was not content to simply occupy a life chair in a symphony.
at the same time it supports an already established free socialized medicine of a particular state-supported brand, administered only by licensed medical doctors.
a recent study based on 1162 patients found acupuncture to be more effective for treating lower back pain, from which 85% of all people will suffer at some point in their life, than conventional treatments.[ii] this is only one of many conditions that are better treated with traditional alternative medicine but the fact remains that these time honored methods represent relatively non-invasive treatments that continues to be the legacy of all traditional peoples throughout the world.
while the new law requires registration and licensing of individual herbal products and does not directly regulate the practice of herbal medicine, it will certainly affect herbalists in the eu.
of course this includes conventional western medicine but also the practioners of newer recognized alternative medicine professions, such as acupuncturists, herbalists, naturopaths, and ayurvedic and chinese healers who have been struggling over recent years with various degrees of success to gain recognition.
however, even with the more extensive training in herbal medicine that german medical doctors evidently receive, it is questionable that they are skilled in the finer aspects of herbal prescribing that is an essential part of the art of traditional herbal systems throughout the world.
i must confess, herbs and herbal medicine had not even occurred to me when i happened into a quaint herb stall at the fair.
when we went to be admitted for examination, few questions were asked.

we shared the look of the ‘beat outlaw,' and as such we should have been kindred spirits, so to speak; yet, his eyes were fixed menacingly on me.
bickering factions among individual herbalists and herbal organizations have crippled their ability to self-regulate, resulting in regulations imposed by governmental agencies.
few could follow him and still come out the other side; i know i couldn't.
i do know that despite his gruff appearance, michael was a true gentleman.
her doctor prescribed an antibiotic, but it had no effect; in fact, the infection worsened.
i do know that despite his gruff appearance, michael was a true gentleman.
the fact that this reason is given for the regulations reflects not only issues with herb safety but also the herbal community’s inability to unilaterally effectively address these concerns.
with the popularity of these traditional healing systems, we are at the place in time where at least a third of the people of america have recognized the value of these traditional systems not only for developing countries but as being of great benefit for certain conditions in our own country.
despite the limitations of this approach i learned that plants do work and found common weeds such as plantain, comfrey, mullein, goldenseal, and later echinacea to be amazingly effective.
he lays the problem out clearly, pointing out that the initial cost of $50 million is what it takes to bring a drug to market, meaning that no less than a million people a day have to take the new drug to justify its cost.
to restrict the sale of such common herbs as cascara sagrada, an herbal laxative; skullcap, an herbal sedative; and ashwagandha, a whole body tonic that increases health and libido which are only a few of the 100s of herbs that will be banned from sale starting in may shows flagrant disregard to the public’s reliance on these and other safe herbal products and discourages people from finding alternatives to the high cost of conventional medical care.
as it stands, americans are flocking to other countries such as thailand or tahiti, where they know they will get superior health care for a fraction of the cost presently in the united states.
we encounter this when we try to decipher the diagnostic assessments and prescriptions of medical doctors as well as the metaphorical jargon used by traditional chinese medicine or ayurvedic doctors.
to wit, their out-of-control protectionism and tendency to play ‘big brother’ causes them to side with the ill-informed majority against the natural health movement.
for example, years ago, my mother was in serious need of health care.
i remember how much michael and stuart resembled each other in stature but also in the incongruity of their appearance as healers.
butthe fact remains that we need to get in step with all other advanced western countries and provide universal health careto everyone in america -- and i mean everyone.

these are universally regarded as classics by the majority of herbalists throughout the world, not only for their practical descriptions of in-the-field, hands-on use of the herbs michael selected, but also for his inimitable ‘kerouacian' witty writing style that makes his herb books a very special experience to read (a talent of which the rest of us who have written herb books can only be envious).here is a link to all of his published books and clinical manuals.

for some strange reason i was drawn into this medieval-looking tableau and was taken a little aback to see a large man with a shaggy beard sitting behind a counter, looking more like an la biker than ye olde herbalist of yore.
being so closely involved with american health care for the last 35 years of my career, i have had plenty of opportunities to speak with people, friends and patients from the uk, canada, france, and italy who seem quite happy with their health care system and have come to take for granted that this is something that a wealthy country should provide to its citizens.
i also distinctly remember that michael was eager to tell people the then-revolutionary idea that herbs could heal body and soul, but few believed him, and it didn't appear that he did much business.

i was honored when at a symposium he presented me with a gift of two cds which were the recordings of his beautiful orchestral works.
without such a protected category in place these herbs may one day be banned not only from the public but also from practitioners.
multiply that by 25 or 40 papers for every patient, and you can see why health care givers are mostly standing behind a desk or nursing station when you visit a hospital rather than assisting the large number of patients supposedly under their care!

uva ursi (arctostaphylos uva ursi, pictured at left) is not as strong as pharmaceutical-grade antibiotics and does not cause the same side effects.

in a similar way, michael moore's three books on the medicinal uses of herbs west of the rocky mountains will remain as the quintessential source reference for this area for many years to come.
the poet's perspective of life, the musician's sense of harmony, the artist's eye of proportion and relationships - these are all shared by healers, especially the herbal healer who works with plants, which are the pure creative expression of nature and the healing process.

education, not regulation many will still argue that the unrestricted use of herbs and self treatment is dangerous, but the fact remains thatstatistics of adverse events and deaths from herbal treatments are infinitesimal compared to the estimated 400,000 people who die annually from pharmaceuticals alone, or who are otherwise injured or made sick from conventional medicine and drugs.
michael educated himself from whatever scientific literature was available, usually from "journals, sources and research outside the united states," as he states in the introduction to hismedicinal plants of the desert and canyon west.

it works locally, purely with the body fluids, as a urinary antiseptic.
we need to move health care out of profit-driven profession to a true enterprise founded on compassion, for all -- and in case "for all" doesn't say it, let me spell it out: i mean this to include the less fortunate amongst us.
so many gps have retired because of the astronomical price of liability insurance they must pay to stay in practice, along with the mounting sheaves of paperwork they are required to maintain -- not to mention the expensive staff they must keep to deal with it.
