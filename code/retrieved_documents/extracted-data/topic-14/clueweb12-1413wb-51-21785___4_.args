from the point of view of a shark, the violation is extremist and violent, and the perpetrators (those who slaughter and consume the shark) have displayed an arrogant insensitivity to their welfare and survival both as individual sentient creatures and as species.it really does make you stronger, more virile, and gives you a more adaptable immune system.there is not a shred of scientific evidence to demonstrate any medicinal benefits of shark fins or shark cartilage.we are asking people to be ecologically responsible and sensitive to the fact that shark species have been diminished in all species from 60% up to 95%.it is a fact that over 100 million sharks are being slaughtered each year and a great majority of this slaughter is to provide shark fins for tasteless, non-nutritive, expensive, superstitious soup meant to impress family and friends as a status symbol.the chinese tradition of binding the feet of women has been abandoned because the rights of women take precedence over the tradition of foot-binding.it is hominid imperialism and the culture of the sharks is being torn apart as these incredible animals are massacred for vanity purposes.the chinese may very well have eaten shark fin for centuries, but there are now more chinese people than there are sharks in the sea and we are killing them at a rate of a hundred million a year.ninety percent of shark fins come from sharks where the body has been wastefully discarded.i have interviewed reputable chinese medical practioneers who have told me that there is no validity to these claims.the campaign against shark finning has nothing to do with race and culture and everything to do with the conservation of important species that fulfill valuable niches within oceanic ecological systems.you see, when you work without pay because you feel that the entire future of the planet is at stake, this is viewed as a luxury.the thrill of seeing them in the wild, of swimming with them, is a far more stimulating and exciting experience than slurping down their boiled fins in a broth at some wedding banquet.as far as i am concerned, there is only one race and that is the human race, and ecologically speaking the entire race is predominantly ignorant, destructive, and suicidal.it appears that loggers who make four times the average income of an environmental activist are working-class and the lower-paid activists are viewed as wealthy.
